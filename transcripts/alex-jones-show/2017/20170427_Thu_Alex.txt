[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.584]  Thursday, 27th.
[00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:17.016]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:20.022]  How many times must I tell you?
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:31.327]  That we're going to defeat the globalists together by exposing the fact that they're an unelected, worldwide, totalitarian, crony-capitalist, organized crime system.
[00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.308]  You see it happening.
[00:00:33.328 --> 00:00:34.129]  They're in big trouble.
[00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.355]  They're saying we're going to politically destroy and financially destroy anybody that tries to lead a resistance against us.
[00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:44.696]  That way the elite just sit there in power.
[00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:46.037]  Everybody knows they're corrupt.
[00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.179]  Everybody knows they want us poor and dumbed down.
[00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.220]  Everybody knows they're a bunch of eugenicists.
[00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:58.323]  But they'll destroy anybody that tries to resist them or any nation that tries to break free of their octopus hydra grip.
[00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:08.246]  But history shows no amount of propaganda, no amount of intimidation will work once the general population is awakened and culturally focused against it.
[00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.827]  Wow, there is so much obviously that I'm going to get to today and then David Knight's coming in.
[00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:17.761]  I'll be back hosting the full show, Lord willing, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:27.954]  Of course, I'll be back in tomorrow, some as well, but I'm going through major trials and tribulations right now, as everyone knows, and they're only intensifying each week in the test.
[00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.798]  And the real test is, I don't blame God for any of this,
[00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:37.202]  This is just the nature of the world, the nature of fallen man, and also a lot of mistakes and things I've done.
[00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:44.646]  I'm far from perfect, but because I'm not here trying to sell people out or enslave humanity, I'm trying to empower humanity, and I do love God.
[00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.528]  The enemy and the world absolutely hates me, just as the Bible tells us.
[00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:58.374]  Ivanka Trump goes to a UN Women's Summit in Berlin, obviously yesterday, rubs elbows with Angela Merkel,
[00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:03.957]  And breaks with her father because it's a women's rights issue.
[00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.337]  She says, bring in refugees.
[00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:06.557]  Isn't that funny?
[00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:12.679]  For the women, 80% according to Interpol of the migrants are military age men.
[00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.940]  Close to 90% are of the male gender.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.561]  So we're talking 11% or so that are women and children.
[00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:26.242]  But they always show you the women and children in the shots.
[00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:27.982]  They find those shots.
[00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:32.569]  So that you feel bad and you feel sorry and then you accept it.
[00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.553]  And then she can go on TV and say we need to let him in.
[00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.718]  So truly disgusting propaganda.
[00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.081]  And is it Trump playing good cop bad cop?
[00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:52.510]  He has tried to stop the seven nations where they don't vet anybody and they just give them fake passports like Somalia, Sudan and others.
[00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:58.840]  But now she's challenging the President, her own father, to change his policies.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.781]  This is just ridiculous.
[00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.602]  We did not elect Ivanka Trump.
[00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:08.405]  We did not elect her Democratic Party husband, Jared Kushner.
[00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:19.310]  Oh, remember about two and a half, three weeks ago, we had Steve Pachetnik on, saying it was going to break soon in the news that Jared Kushner has been compromised by Communist China.
[00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.692]  And guess what was in the New York Times?
[00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:24.452]  Yesterday.
[00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:27.595]  Oh, fake news scoops you again.
[00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:28.476]  No, we're the real news.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.769]  Bribe cases of Jared Kushner partner and potential conflicts with Communist China and so much more.
[00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:41.305]  Isn't that just special?
[00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:43.447]  So, there you go.
[00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:56.055]  That's why they hate us so much, because we can force this information out in the open, and it's come out now in the Daily Caller, it's up on Infowars.com, that Stephen Bannon called Jared Kushner a cuck and a globalist behind his back.
[00:03:56.116 --> 00:04:01.379]  Well, he certainly is a cuck for the establishment, and everything he touches goes bankrupt.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.281]  He's a good-looking guy, we've never heard him talk.
[00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:07.504]  I mean, you know, you want to be in a man's game, sonny?
[00:04:08.124 --> 00:04:09.365]  Need to hear you talk a little bit.
[00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.541]  We hear your wife out there quite a bit, and what comes out of her mouth doesn't sound too good.
[00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:19.063]  What came out of her mouth sounded real good at the RNC.
[00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:26.486]  Now, that said, we're 100 days now into the Trump administration, and it's a love-hate relationship, personally.
[00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:27.927]  It's paradoxical.
[00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:38.493]  Just so good on the economy, so good on sovereignty, so good on TPP, so good on bringing jobs back, so good on moving for the border wall, moving to kill NAFTA and GATT.
[00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:46.173]  But more and more who he's bringing in, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, like this big bad one when we come back.
[00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:55.264]  They're leveling their crosshairs for sure on whistleblowers, Julian Assange, Snowden and others, calling them foreign intelligence operatives.
[00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:59.369]  So you might as well have John McCain running the White House with that type of baloney.
[00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:00.090]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:05.631]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.033]  Listen to these headlines from just the last week.
[00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.836]  Four times in four days, Russian military aircraft fly off U.S.
[00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.537]  coast, some nuclear-capable.
[00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:14.118]  U.S.
[00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:16.240]  sends nuclear sniffer plane to Korea.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.184]  China tests missile on deadly new destroyer ship near North Korea as it warns it's getting troops battle-ready.
[00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:22.765]  U.S.
[00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:26.808]  preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.
[00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:28.029]  Washington, D.C.
[00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:30.511]  to hold massive coordinated terror attack drill.
[00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:33.212]  Feds prepare for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:37.013]  North Korea flexes muscle in unprecedented live fire drill.
[00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:37.673]  D.C.
[00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:41.114]  area first responders prepare for a complex terror attack.
[00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:41.774]  U.S.
[00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:45.375]  Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel in Persian Gulf.
[00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:48.616]  Air Force launches test missile off California coast.
[00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:49.896]  Entire U.S.
[00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:52.617]  Senate called for meeting on North Korea briefing.
[00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:57.698]  And now, NBC News is telling its audience what to do in case of a nuclear attack.
[00:05:57.918 --> 00:06:00.020]  Will this cold world war ever go hot?
[00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:02.403]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:28.889]  Attackers on every level now with the YouTube scandal they're demonetizing our channels which again takes a huge chunk out of our income which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.191]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:34.393]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:35.414]  They don't have that power.
[00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:38.396]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:41.159]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.441]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:44.461 --> 00:06:46.103]  This is by listener request.
[00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:51.587]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:52.188]  Again,
[00:06:52.928 --> 00:06:58.674]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[00:06:59.094 --> 00:07:03.399]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.683]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.587]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:07:12.607 --> 00:07:31.000]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.161]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.222]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:38.583]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:50.447]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.769]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[00:08:18.126 --> 00:08:23.148]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.629]  Out of my way!
[00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.130]  Out of my way, Satan!
[00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.031]  Get behind me!
[00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.612]  I'm not strong, but God's strong.
[00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:43.215]  When I come into the presence of God, when I got on my knees this morning for about 15 minutes, I could just feel how fallen I was in my separation from God.
[00:08:44.556 --> 00:08:47.257]  And then, I could feel God come closer.
[00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:50.308]  And I could feel the Spirit rise in me.
[00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:59.515]  And quite frankly, it makes you be ashamed of yourself, but you are so close to God, it's just you know how real it is, and how you want to be purified and sanctified.
[00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:16.528]  You know, the Holy Spirit comes on me when I'm never expecting it, and it's so strong, but it's whenever you purposely get on your knees and pray at a set time, it's good to do because you realize how worldly you are, and how you were in the world, and how you were so much more fallen, like someone down deep in black water.
[00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:22.660]  But as you begin to swim up towards the surface, you break out and then there's the sun.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:37.787]  You're not like God, you're not pure like God, you're not holy like God, but now you're in the atmosphere of God and you can see the edge, the light, the archetype of God.
[00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:40.368]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:44.410]  Evil is rising because liberty is rising.
[00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.931]  The great test!
[00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:56.793]  The trials and tribulations that we're always facing are now going to intensify because the energetic level of the planet is rising.
[00:09:57.813 --> 00:10:06.957]  And the enemy is moving against humanity on every front, but God is working through you and so many others in the face of this flood of corruption.
[00:10:07.902 --> 00:10:15.366]  Forget the exact area of the Bible, maybe we can search engine it, but when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:17.527]  Everything is part of God's plan.
[00:10:17.807 --> 00:10:19.248]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:32.214]  And you see the enemy taking everything we say out of context, twisting it, turning the fact that I'm truthful against me, using their worldly systems for control.
[00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:35.988]  But then you have to really pity people like that.
[00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:42.917]  Isaiah, so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun.
[00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:48.065]  When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against them.
[00:10:49.989 --> 00:10:52.233]  All right, let me just hit some of the basics that's coming up today.
[00:10:52.273 --> 00:10:59.444]  David Knight's gonna be here, and then I get to go enjoy my trials and tribulations and my family's trials and tribulations.
[00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:04.011]  And then I should be back Sunday, maybe even tomorrow, here in studio.
[00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.333]  We'll see, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.550]  It's wonderful.
[00:11:34.557 --> 00:11:42.600]  Kind of wears off on each other, but we've got to just always remember that we're focused, we're moving forward, and we're going to keep the bullets going politically down field.
[00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:45.781]  Let me hit this first.
[00:11:46.762 --> 00:11:53.725]  We started hearing rumblings the last month that the new CIA director and the new Attorney General were going to make their big focus leaks.
[00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:59.507]  Now the President has said leaks in the White House, leaks in Congress, leaks in the intelligence agencies.
[00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:03.245]  People leaking on his meetings every day.
[00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:06.047]  Oh, Jared Kushner's not going to get in trouble.
[00:12:06.307 --> 00:12:06.988]  We've confirmed.
[00:12:07.008 --> 00:12:08.508]  We've got the copies of the text messages.
[00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:09.969]  Oh, yeah, we've got them all.
[00:12:09.989 --> 00:12:15.332]  That's why they didn't deny it when it all came out a few weeks ago with Roger Stone.
[00:12:17.013 --> 00:12:18.775]  Mr. Fake News is not Mr. Fake News.
[00:12:19.175 --> 00:12:20.976]  The media immediately went, oh, my God, it's true.
[00:12:21.016 --> 00:12:27.680]  And then you saw all the backpedaling where Kushner and others are leaking like a sieve.
[00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:34.602]  Bannon will not even talk to anybody, including Breitbart, because he won't be accused of leaking.
[00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:37.782]  So he won't even talk to people.
[00:12:37.803 --> 00:12:41.483]  He's completely isolated because he's doing what Trump says.
[00:12:42.423 --> 00:12:54.585]  So, imagine with the pedophile rings getting rounded up, and the borders getting secured, and the first hundred days, a lot of good economic things that are happening, a lot of amazing things like TPP getting killed.
[00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:56.186]  Trump is an American president.
[00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:57.726]  He is actually acting as president.
[00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:02.207]  Doing some things I don't like, doing a lot of things I love, but he's being the president.
[00:13:02.227 --> 00:13:03.628]  So that's the big positive.
[00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:08.392]  And there's a lot of great positive things in the first hundred days that take hours to go over.
[00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:10.713]  Most of you can probably think of more than I can.
[00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:12.414]  But look at these headlines now.
[00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:14.256]  This is bad.
[00:13:15.857 --> 00:13:24.463]  If they were prosecuting the leakers in the government with the hack that happened a few years ago, with the OPM hack,
[00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:35.760]  Where you've had 14 to 20 million names of secret agents and government people and their social security numbers and their phone numbers and their associates and their connections all leaked.
[00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:39.183]  Nobody got in trouble, nobody lost their job.
[00:13:40.684 --> 00:13:44.307]  Biggest devastating blow to our security in our history probably.
[00:13:45.808 --> 00:13:47.690]  And there's been so many other big events like that.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.381]  Inside the cyber attack that shocked the U.S.
[00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:53.741]  government.
[00:13:54.402 --> 00:13:55.322]  Well, nothing ever happened.
[00:13:56.863 --> 00:13:58.784]  Here we are like three years later, two and a half years later.
[00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:07.107]  So, you've got all this leaking of sellouts to the Communist China, all the Clintons in bed with the Russians and Chinese, up to their eyeballs.
[00:14:09.328 --> 00:14:11.069]  And then, Snowden
[00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:33.528]  And Assange that have exposed targeted corruption that whistleblowers have put out that needs to be exposed, that's criminal activity against the American people, the DNC rigging the election, trying to steal it, rigging the questions, all the things they did, let's keep America poor, let's keep them in the dark, all those incredible revelations of just how bonafide evil they are.
[00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:39.205]  And now the Democratic Party's running the entire MSM every day.
[00:14:39.265 --> 00:14:42.486]  Running Google, banning Libertarian Patriot News.
[00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:43.927]  All of it proof.
[00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:46.067]  Huge victories we had.
[00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:47.568]  None of that's even in the news.
[00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:51.689]  And all we hear from Trump is, stop these leaks.
[00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:53.010]  They go, oh yes sir, we will.
[00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.110]  Well sir, you said stop the leaks.
[00:14:55.951 --> 00:14:57.251]  And I know this isn't Trump.
[00:14:57.971 --> 00:14:58.832]  This is him delegating.
[00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:01.492]  I can barely run an office here with 60-something crew members.
[00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:02.773]  They're great people.
[00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.394]  You get a few traders in there, a few moles.
[00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:09.678]  We've had a couple moles in here over the years, and they almost ran the ship aground.
[00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:10.318]  They tried.
[00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:15.763]  By the grace of God, we discovered them right as they were, you know, basically involved in the sabotage.
[00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:24.551]  And can you imagine Trump with 4,000 people under him and all the other interlocking agencies and a million-plus employees that plug into that?
[00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:25.752]  It is crazy.
[00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:36.921]  You've got the Vault 7 stuff coming out, all the illegal hacking and everything, that proves that Trump's being illegally spied on and being framed.
[00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:39.443]  So people in the U.S.
[00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:40.864]  government are leaking the WikiLeaks.
[00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:46.269]  He was high-level contractor, been the CIA, you name it, Snowden.
[00:15:47.683 --> 00:15:50.124]  All of that's happening to back up what Trump's saying.
[00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:51.545]  Putting him in office.
[00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:53.226]  Exposing the deep state.
[00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.067]  The deep state's trying to sabotage Trump.
[00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:55.987]  He said that himself.
[00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:57.168]  So has Spicer.
[00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:58.369]  John Spicer.
[00:15:59.009 --> 00:15:59.689]  The press secretary.
[00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.351]  They've all said, yes, we're battling deep state.
[00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:07.914]  And here's all the intel proving that and trying to save the country.
[00:16:08.194 --> 00:16:15.758]  And now the CIA director says the WikiLeaks is a hostile intelligence service.
[00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:18.318]  Wow!
[00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:22.442]  Our own patriots are giving 90% of the intel to Wikileaks.
[00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.023]  That's admitted.
[00:16:23.543 --> 00:16:27.066]  And he says that CIA chief blasts Wikileaks once praised by Trump.
[00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:28.287]  That's USA Today.
[00:16:29.108 --> 00:16:30.389]  Candidate Trump, I love Wikileaks.
[00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:31.911]  President Trump arrests Assange.
[00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:32.812]  Ron Paul.
[00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.873]  It's all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:38.557]  So...
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.984]  Trump always talks about how he's loyal and how he, you know, all the rest of this stuff.
[00:16:45.464 --> 00:16:50.129]  And these people went out on a total limb to do all this and they're being thrown to the wolves.
[00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.913]  You add the cherry on top of Ivanka Trump.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.743]  Go to the Women's Conference with Merkel and say we need to bring more refugees in.
[00:17:01.803 --> 00:17:16.015]  It's for the women when it's 80% military-age men, 89% men gender-wise, 11% women, and it's giant rape gangs all over, running people over with cars in every major country multiple times a year, shooting people every week.
[00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:17.076]  They won't even call it terror.
[00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.759]  And then she sits up there and says, I disagree with my father.
[00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:21.280]  He needs to change his position.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.643]  Wow, Ivanka, we didn't elect you, sweetheart.
[00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:28.961]  Is it intimidation?
[00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:29.982]  Is it because they're liberals?
[00:17:30.042 --> 00:17:32.023]  Is it because they want to go to the coolest trendy restaurants?
[00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:32.643]  I don't know.
[00:17:32.723 --> 00:17:35.344]  But it's betrayal after betrayal.
[00:17:35.384 --> 00:17:36.144]  And it's a paradox.
[00:17:36.365 --> 00:17:38.706]  Because Trump's doing all this great stuff and I'm glad Hillary isn't in.
[00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:40.906]  And he is being the American president.
[00:17:41.247 --> 00:17:42.247]  And the globalists still hate him.
[00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:44.248]  But what is his family thinking?
[00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:48.823]  And it's family taking advantage of Trump, bare minimum.
[00:17:49.203 --> 00:18:04.507]  But it doesn't matter, because even if he's a good guy or a bad guy or whatever it is, it's dereliction of duty to let his daughter run around and countervail everything we've built, our sovereignty, what we've done, and to side with the UN and the globalists that are trying to destroy her father and this country.
[00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:08.636]  And then we told you two and a half weeks ago, was it three weeks ago?
[00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:09.857]  We can put it on screen.
[00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:12.819]  We had former high-level CIA, you name it.
[00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:20.184]  That's all classified regime change expert, Dr. Steve Pucinich, saying it's going to come out that Kushner's run by the Communist Chinese.
[00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:23.126]  That was April 10th, so three weeks ago.
[00:18:24.607 --> 00:18:30.351]  Bribe cases of Jared Kushner, partner, and potential conflicts, New York Times, getting into all of that yesterday.
[00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:34.414]  So there we are, giving you all that intel, way ahead of it being mainstream news.
[00:18:36.226 --> 00:18:37.367]  So it's simply amazing.
[00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:44.029]  Meanwhile, Paramount's new chief revives a China deal where they begin the takeover of Paramount.
[00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:46.230]  They're trying to buy up all six right now.
[00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.991]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:18:48.051 --> 00:18:51.393]  Kim puts White House in crosshairs, threatens to blow it up.
[00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.794]  Just look at government worship.
[00:18:53.814 --> 00:19:01.059]  Just look at the cult of government worship and how Venezuela is starving to death and Brazil has the natives shooting arrows.
[00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:02.059]  I want to play that when we come back.
[00:19:02.379 --> 00:19:09.604]  Shooting arrows, you know, at the parliament building because they won't even let the natives into the parliament to be represented in their tribal lands.
[00:19:09.984 --> 00:19:13.886]  And just all the craziness that's going on.
[00:19:15.147 --> 00:19:17.449]  Historic tax cuts to put USA back to work.
[00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:19.170]  That's some good news.
[00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.771]  Trump is trying to fulfill that promise.
[00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:26.178]  Austrian press, all women must wear headscarves to fight Islamophobia.
[00:19:26.418 --> 00:19:27.098]  See what I told you?
[00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:33.063]  They're gonna make everyone submit to Islam to stop making them get mad at us.
[00:19:33.103 --> 00:19:36.546]  I've been saying that for five, six years, and now they're actually doing it.
[00:19:36.626 --> 00:19:37.427]  That's the plan.
[00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:42.611]  You go to the liberal women's marches funded by Soros, half the women are wearing hijabs.
[00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:45.474]  It's like a little rebellious, you know, cuckold thing they do.
[00:19:47.785 --> 00:19:48.045]  Wow!
[00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:54.990]  We're gonna come back and get into where I see all this going for one more segment and then David Knight's coming in.
[00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.092]  We've got so much to cover today.
[00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:59.533]  Infowarriors.com forward slash show.
[00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:04.657]  The enemy hates the broadcast because we are telling the truth and we bring our fellow Infowarriors.
[00:20:05.097 --> 00:20:11.699]  Across the United States and across the planet, really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:21.481]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:28.862]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:30.343]  We now have George Soros.
[00:20:31.443 --> 00:20:32.183]  As a goblin.
[00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:36.524]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[00:20:36.864 --> 00:20:37.525]  No Soros.
[00:20:37.885 --> 00:20:38.645]  Him as a goblin.
[00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:44.526]  It says, Deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:20:46.007 --> 00:20:49.207]  So, it is a limited edition Deport Soros on the back.
[00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:50.888]  Hillary for President on the front.
[00:20:51.288 --> 00:20:53.088]  Right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:53.448 --> 00:20:53.988]  It's powerful.
[00:20:54.008 --> 00:20:55.069]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:57.089]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:21:06.368 --> 00:21:16.994]  Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network, and of course he's a law enforcement training group and also a well-known respected private detective who becomes highly recommended over the years from our sources.
[00:21:17.414 --> 00:21:23.837]  He has FBI sources also, state police sources, and others in multiple states there on the East Coast.
[00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:25.378]  So Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:29.100]  You look at the battlefront worldwide, the globalist forces, we're in a war right now.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.421]  Exactly, and that's part of it.
[00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:57.658]  And when I look at my side of things, on the domestic side, what I'm hearing from my FBI sources, one confirmation I got from both an FBI source as well as an agency source or CIA source, saying watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency, the NGA, as well as the NSA in the upcoming days with respect to the leaks that had come out about the Trump administration, but also
[00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.339]  We're about to have nuclear war, folks.
[00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:01.999]  It's time to arrest Hillary Clinton.
[00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:25.565]  We've got to save the country.
[00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:27.326]  The world's never been in more danger.
[00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.407]  They're the ones that made everything radical.
[00:22:29.627 --> 00:22:33.849]  Kim Jong-un, Hillary, all these other scumbags, Juncker, all of them need to be arrested.
[00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:35.170]  They're all calling for war.
[00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.791]  They're all involved in criminal activity.
[00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:37.631]  Arrest all of them.
[00:22:37.851 --> 00:22:38.332]  I'm serious.
[00:22:39.012 --> 00:22:44.415]  Yeah, 100% behind you because they brought us to this point and they have sold us out.
[00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:47.417]  Uh, the Korean, uh, situation.
[00:22:47.517 --> 00:23:00.024]  So, so we've got this, this, this melting pot of, or this, uh, this, uh, really sewage pot of, of strife worldwide that was brought, we, we got to this point because of Obama and right now.
[00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:02.332]  And Clinton, especially.
[00:23:02.352 --> 00:23:16.002]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine Albright during the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State, to bring us to this point as well, and then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama.
[00:23:16.022 --> 00:23:22.066]  So this has her fingerprints all over the place, and here we are, you know, at this level.
[00:23:22.106 --> 00:23:28.651]  So there's much more to get into, but watch the next really 72 to 96 hours with respect to the taps.
[00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:33.120]  Why would they want to not have Russia on our side during this China crisis?
[00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.285]  Why are they trying to bring Russia down?
[00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:37.635]  Well, chaos.
[00:23:37.715 --> 00:23:38.956]  Operation Chaos, basically.
[00:23:39.516 --> 00:23:46.541]  This is the same playbook that we used, or that the Globals used back in the 60s, is being used today.
[00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:48.723]  And it's everybody against everybody.
[00:23:48.843 --> 00:23:55.228]  Let's destroy, let's burn the whole damn thing down and, you know, start it from scratch.
[00:23:56.088 --> 00:24:02.333]  It's very imprudent to do that, obviously, but these people that we're dealing with, as you pointed out, they're psychos.
[00:24:14.548 --> 00:24:16.649]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.272]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:24:28.315 --> 00:24:31.156]  We are back ladies and gentlemen, and David Knight's coming into the next segment.
[00:24:31.176 --> 00:24:32.937]  Got a bunch of guests lined up today.
[00:24:32.957 --> 00:24:36.099]  Why is Trump going sideways?
[00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:39.421]  David Knight might want to open the phones up and give people's take on this.
[00:24:39.481 --> 00:24:40.141]  I mean, what do you think?
[00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:43.690]  A lot of stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.911]  I just mentioned this one and it ties in.
[00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:47.271]  Story from Breitbart.
[00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:51.073]  Austrian press, all women must wear headscarves to fight Islamophobia.
[00:24:51.413 --> 00:24:58.416]  The only thing more ridiculous than that was all the big Swedish Stockholm Syndrome, literal articles on Stockholm.
[00:24:58.856 --> 00:25:01.917]  Articles a few weeks ago where the guy ran over a bunch of people with a car and killed them.
[00:25:02.217 --> 00:25:05.979]  They said, ban cars so that we can't be run over.
[00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:06.979]  They didn't even say it was
[00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:07.299]  I don't
[00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:31.583]  You know what's covered up?
[00:25:32.023 --> 00:25:40.566]  With the women up there, lesbian women, saying Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar and chanting Islamic chants when Muslims would kill them in two seconds.
[00:25:40.966 --> 00:25:43.627]  And there's no fallacy for them in their minds.
[00:25:43.987 --> 00:25:49.889]  Because only the West and the place that gave them the nest to have the freedom and have purple hair and tattoos.
[00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:51.550]  I don't care if you have purple hair and tattoos.
[00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.670]  Does it impress me?
[00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.190]  Does it not impress me?
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.891]  I see women with purple hair sometimes, I like it.
[00:25:56.371 --> 00:26:00.653]  The point is, oh, you're so impressive, you're so avant-garde, you're so counterculture.
[00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:03.754]  That is the dominant culture's purple hair and tattoos everywhere.
[00:26:03.934 --> 00:26:04.555]  So fine!
[00:26:05.395 --> 00:26:08.056]  So now you want to like poop in your pants or something, you know.
[00:26:08.296 --> 00:26:10.097]  In Japan, they're all into cleanliness.
[00:26:10.137 --> 00:26:11.818]  The cleanest culture pretty much in history.
[00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:16.640]  And so the big fetish there for the last 50 years of decadence is people crap on themselves.
[00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:21.404]  I mean, I don't want to be gross here, but they have bars, they have a whole thing that's into it.
[00:26:21.804 --> 00:26:22.685]  It's the grossest thing.
[00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:24.446]  The Japanese were totally grossed out by that.
[00:26:24.486 --> 00:26:24.946]  You should be.
[00:26:25.466 --> 00:26:26.927]  So how do you become bad?
[00:26:27.027 --> 00:26:28.668]  You start pooping on yourself.
[00:26:29.128 --> 00:26:29.888]  And that's what this is.
[00:26:29.908 --> 00:26:31.049]  Let's put a headscarf on.
[00:26:31.069 --> 00:26:31.909]  Let's holla Akbar.
[00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.171]  Let's allow genital mutilation of newborn girls.
[00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:35.131]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[00:26:35.191 --> 00:26:35.872]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[00:26:37.192 --> 00:26:45.977]  You know, oh, the news is all, oh, you know, the yogurt owner, you know, the guy from Turkey that works for George Soros and George Soros' law firm suing us.
[00:26:48.188 --> 00:26:54.352]  And they say in Bloomberg, I'm being sued for connecting refugees to rape and TB.
[00:26:55.633 --> 00:26:59.176]  And then I've got the mainstream news articles of in that town, TB's up 500%.
[00:26:59.456 --> 00:27:02.638]  That's political correctness.
[00:27:03.158 --> 00:27:05.800]  You will not say Muslims are connected to sex assault.
[00:27:06.341 --> 00:27:07.681]  You will not say any of it.
[00:27:08.282 --> 00:27:11.924]  You will never say that, you will never say TB's going up.
[00:27:12.405 --> 00:27:14.066]  Is that understood, sir?
[00:27:15.787 --> 00:27:16.808]  Do you understand that?
[00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:20.631]  There is no leprosy coming in across the border.
[00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:22.032]  There is no drug-resistant TB.
[00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:24.033]  There is no, there is no problem.
[00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:30.879]  Venezuela has no diseases and is a wonderland with food growing on the trees everywhere and everyone is super rich.
[00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:33.261]  Communism is wonderful, look at North Korea.
[00:27:36.423 --> 00:27:38.064]  And you're like, you look at the town, it's up 500%.
[00:27:40.543 --> 00:27:42.784]  They covered up the rape cases, said that didn't exist.
[00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:44.105]  They finally plead guilty.
[00:27:44.606 --> 00:27:46.247]  The town says it's happening epidemic.
[00:27:46.267 --> 00:27:49.309]  The police and the mayor won't do it because they've been ordered not to.
[00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:52.751]  The mayor is the source that there's no rape in the town.
[00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:54.352]  It's like ABC News.
[00:27:54.592 --> 00:27:57.614]  The mayor doesn't think the plant's connected to rape.
[00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:00.435]  Full of Muslims.
[00:28:03.357 --> 00:28:08.541]  Can I go to Turkey and open up a yogurt plant and move in, say, a couple thousand Texans?
[00:28:10.825 --> 00:28:12.947]  And then have the women walk around without a hood on their head?
[00:28:13.447 --> 00:28:14.629]  No, no, no.
[00:28:14.829 --> 00:28:16.891]  But see, because we're tolerant, we're bad.
[00:28:17.531 --> 00:28:26.219]  So I've got to be so tolerant now that I have my wife wear a hijab, my daughters wear a hijab, and then, you know, take them to Islamic doctors that can pull out some scissors and cut their genitals off.
[00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:27.040]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.421]  I stand against it.
[00:28:29.122 --> 00:28:30.503]  Because I'm a hate monger, right?
[00:28:31.424 --> 00:28:32.765]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:35.628]  That just goes on and on and on from there.
[00:28:38.012 --> 00:28:40.693]  You know, Trump said that he was going to renegotiate NAFTA.
[00:28:40.713 --> 00:28:42.073]  Now he says he's not leaving it.
[00:28:42.113 --> 00:28:43.113]  They say he's flip-flopping.
[00:28:43.153 --> 00:28:43.994]  No, he said he's going to.
[00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:45.654]  I'm going to wait and see what he does.
[00:28:45.694 --> 00:28:46.894]  Killing TPP was huge.
[00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:50.795]  Military preparations are underway for North Korea's strike.
[00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:54.036]  If he continues to threaten to attack everybody, that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:55.457]  Get those articles out.
[00:28:55.537 --> 00:28:56.597]  Sign up for the free newsletter.
[00:28:56.937 --> 00:29:01.518]  The enemy does not want you to have the information because it's affecting the world.
[00:29:01.898 --> 00:29:03.159]  Let's beat their computers.
[00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.000]  Let's beat their A.I.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.421]  together.
[00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:07.243]  Let's show them what we did in the election.
[00:29:07.403 --> 00:29:09.865]  Whether Trump ends up being perfect or not, that doesn't matter.
[00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:11.607]  Nationalism's rising.
[00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:12.408]  People want it.
[00:29:12.849 --> 00:29:15.071]  The brand of liberty is the number one thing out there.
[00:29:15.371 --> 00:29:16.733]  We're going to win together.
[00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:24.581]  We're going to go to break and come back, and David, I'll tell you about some of the big specials that end this weekend, like 53% off the bone broth turmeric
[00:29:25.282 --> 00:29:27.003]  Total Paleo Caveman Formula.
[00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:31.206]  Not because it is in one of our top five sellers, but because it's a lost leader at that price.
[00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.329]  Well, if you sign up for auto-ship and 10% off, it certainly is.
[00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:37.591]  Because I want you to see how great it is.
[00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:40.874]  We've got the Super Blue Kids Toothpaste almost sold out.
[00:29:41.254 --> 00:29:42.815]  We've got Brain Force and so much more.
[00:29:42.855 --> 00:29:44.937]  A bunch of specials at infowarrestore.com.
[00:29:45.237 --> 00:29:46.498]  Please pray for me and my family.
[00:29:46.858 --> 00:29:47.499]  We really need it.
[00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.940]  The enemy's coming against us right now.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.641]  But we do it with jolly spirit.
[00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:51.722]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:29:53.777 --> 00:30:13.012]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[00:30:13.433 --> 00:30:22.920]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.002]  And gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government.
[00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:32.444]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed.
[00:30:32.684 --> 00:30:37.066]  And all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[00:30:37.346 --> 00:30:40.648]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep?
[00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:43.569]  It's because that money is being held by the federal government.
[00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:44.629]  Don't believe me?
[00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.091]  Just read the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby.
[00:30:48.351 --> 00:30:57.045]  She was a whistleblower from the Department of Education in the 1980s, and her tome describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons.
[00:30:57.345 --> 00:31:00.610]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:11.313]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:31:11.533 --> 00:31:17.955]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:31:18.195 --> 00:31:26.478]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:31:26.758 --> 00:31:32.364]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:31:32.604 --> 00:31:35.507]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:41.513]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:31:41.853 --> 00:31:42.333]  It works.
[00:31:42.613 --> 00:31:50.917]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:31:50.937 --> 00:32:00.482]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:32:00.822 --> 00:32:01.322]  A total 360 win.
[00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:12.480]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:20.789]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:20.969 --> 00:32:25.634]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:25.834 --> 00:32:32.539]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:39.684]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:39.784 --> 00:32:46.669]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:46.829 --> 00:32:51.152]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:51.292 --> 00:32:54.555]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:54.675 --> 00:33:00.800]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.701]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:11.428 --> 00:33:12.328]  You found it.
[00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:14.150]  The tip of the spear.
[00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:19.074]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[00:33:23.243 --> 00:33:24.625]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:25.366]  I'm David Knight.
[00:33:25.446 --> 00:33:29.210]  On this Thursday, this is April the 27th.
[00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.933]  That's getting there pretty quickly, isn't it?
[00:33:32.534 --> 00:33:35.657]  We're nearly at the end of the month and we're about to get to Trump's 100 days.
[00:33:35.677 --> 00:33:40.583]  We're going to talk about the Trump tax plan as well as some movements in Obamacare repeal.
[00:33:40.743 --> 00:33:43.867]  Not really, but there's been a little bit of movement there.
[00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:49.475]  I think what he did with the Trump tax plan is exactly what he campaigned on.
[00:33:49.535 --> 00:33:51.397]  It is very close to what he campaigned on.
[00:33:51.437 --> 00:33:56.060]  And it was a good move for Trump to get out in front of Paul Ryan.
[00:33:56.521 --> 00:33:57.682]  And I'm going to talk about this.
[00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:05.048]  I'm going to show you how the major opposition on this, just like on Obamacare repeal, is coming from within the Republican Party.
[00:34:05.588 --> 00:34:06.789]  From within the Republican Party.
[00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.990]  They're the problem.
[00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:11.493]  We have... Republicans are all on the same page on this.
[00:34:12.213 --> 00:34:13.695]  If Republicans supported
[00:34:14.707 --> 00:34:27.955]  What the GOP platform said, what the GOP presidential candidate said, if they supported that, we would have a repeal of Obamacare, when we would get this tax reform that was revealed yesterday by the Trump administration.
[00:34:27.975 --> 00:34:30.396]  So we're going to talk about the two developments there.
[00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:31.857]  We're also going to take a look at
[00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:39.781]  Some of the mind issues that are coming out and the the idiocracy that we're devolving into.
[00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:47.704]  But before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you that we have extended this sale for a limited time of Caveman, our True Paleo Formula.
[00:34:48.064 --> 00:34:51.405]  We now have 53% off the retail price.
[00:34:51.786 --> 00:34:55.127]  That's our Caveman True Paleo Formula at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:34:55.147 --> 00:35:00.369]  That's an additional 20% off the already 33% sale that we had just before.
[00:35:00.429 --> 00:35:02.590]  This is for a limited time only, while supplies last.
[00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:10.039]  And of course, the unique formulation behind Caveman combines cutting-edge nutraceutical science with ancient nutrition.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.963]  By ancient nutrition, we're talking about bone broth.
[00:35:13.043 --> 00:35:17.508]  People have long known how nutritious bone broth is.
[00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:20.200]  We've used this for a long time in my family.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:29.127]  Now you can get this in a very easy, it takes a very long time to steep all this, and you don't always have leftover bones that you can make a broth out of.
[00:35:29.547 --> 00:35:31.869]  So this is something you can do on a daily basis.
[00:35:31.969 --> 00:35:42.297]  It also, besides the bone broth, it adds turmeric root, chaga mushrooms, bee pollen, and many other ingredients in a true paleo nutrition formula.
[00:35:42.377 --> 00:35:46.400]  Again, you can get Caveman for 53% off retail at infowarestore.com.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.941]  Let me read you
[00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:50.503]  One of the reviews there, because you can take a look at the reviews that we have there.
[00:35:50.964 --> 00:35:52.745]  It's maintained by a third-party site.
[00:35:53.425 --> 00:35:54.286]  And here's one of them.
[00:35:54.826 --> 00:35:55.867]  The guy's name is Gerald.
[00:35:55.907 --> 00:35:57.328]  He says, great stuff, tastes great.
[00:35:57.688 --> 00:36:02.492]  Been using some other formulas from other brands, but Caveman has a lot of great stuff in it.
[00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:04.433]  I like it and I recommend it.
[00:36:04.493 --> 00:36:09.257]  Also from Bren, he said, excellent product, tastes amazing, love the ingredients.
[00:36:09.337 --> 00:36:12.460]  I would recommend to everyone looking for a shake supplement.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.904]  Again, you can get that at 53% off at InfoWarsStore.com while supplies last.
[00:36:18.725 --> 00:36:19.566]  Let's take a quick look.
[00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:23.690]  What's going on with brain issues?
[00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:36.300]  Okay, of course I've said brain force is my favorite supplement that we have here and maybe when we take a look at this clip of Nancy Pelosi, maybe we should send her just out of sheer compassion.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.381]  Some free brain force for her to take.
[00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:42.241]  Maybe that will help her with these speeches.
[00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:48.182]  I don't know if she's being hacked or if this is just nature taking its course as we all get older.
[00:36:48.983 --> 00:37:03.726]  But before we do, before we take a look at Nancy Pelosi's speech here, I think it's interesting to see the Guardian talking about how we need to come up and codify some new human rights to protect us against being hacked, against our minds being hacked.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.261]  And against brain data theft.
[00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:08.581]  Let me repeat that.
[00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:10.602]  Brain data theft.
[00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:11.582]  This is the Guardian.
[00:37:12.402 --> 00:37:21.585]  Now, only a year or two ago, the Guardian and the New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media would have laughed at InfoWars.
[00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:26.866]  They would have called us tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists because we would have said, look, they're trying to read our minds.
[00:37:26.886 --> 00:37:28.206]  They're trying to control our minds.
[00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.667]  And of course, this is something
[00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:36.730]  That the government, DARPA and others, the CIA, have been doing with MKUltra program.
[00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:39.632]  They created LSD, a lot of chemicals.
[00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:45.135]  Now they're taking a more electronic approach to it instead of a chemical approach.
[00:37:45.275 --> 00:37:47.576]  But this has been their goal for 50, 60 years.
[00:37:49.676 --> 00:37:51.137]  Trying to control people's minds.
[00:37:51.418 --> 00:37:52.558]  Trying to read people's minds.
[00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:54.740]  And it's starting to become effective.
[00:37:55.421 --> 00:38:06.550]  And in addition to what DARPA is doing, and the military, we also have the BRAIN Initiative from Barack Obama, starting out with about $200 million worth of funding.
[00:38:06.971 --> 00:38:08.292]  They're very serious about this.
[00:38:08.832 --> 00:38:13.216]  And you have to understand, this technology is going to bear fruit.
[00:38:13.316 --> 00:38:15.618]  And now the mainstream media is even talking about it.
[00:38:15.658 --> 00:38:16.479]  You know it's a done deal.
[00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:17.960]  You know it's already been done.
[00:38:18.874 --> 00:38:27.461]  And so they're saying, well, the new human rights that would protect people from having their thoughts and other brain information stolen, abused, or hacked have been proposed by researchers.
[00:38:28.424 --> 00:38:28.644]  Yeah.
[00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:29.945]  You need to make sure.
[00:38:30.165 --> 00:38:54.224]  And you know, we might want to also, at the same time, we might want to also protect our freedom of movement so they don't lock us in the cities with Agenda 21 and taking over our cars, taking the steering wheels out of our hands, and making travel by permission only as they track our every movement, as they tax our every movement, as they monitor our every thought.
[00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.975]  This may sound like paranoia, but it is technological reality.
[00:38:59.635 --> 00:39:05.062]  It's going to be here very quickly, and we need to make sure that we understand this and we just don't dismiss this as science fiction.
[00:39:05.283 --> 00:39:13.993]  We've talked about this a long time, and people used to make fun of Alex Jones for putting a piece of tape or post-it over the camera on his monitor.
[00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:16.270]  They're not laughing about that anymore.
[00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.194]  You can see Zuckerberg putting it over his because his organization is doing it.
[00:39:21.414 --> 00:39:26.798]  You know, Zuckerberg goes out and says, oh, we're going to work on technology that will let you type using your mind.
[00:39:27.238 --> 00:39:28.299]  Oh, that sounds great, doesn't it?
[00:39:28.779 --> 00:39:32.943]  Except what he's really saying is Facebook is going to be working on technology to read your mind.
[00:39:33.963 --> 00:39:34.344]  And of course,
[00:39:35.643 --> 00:39:37.184]  They're not going to maintain your privacy.
[00:39:37.845 --> 00:39:42.950]  They're already collecting all kinds of information without your permission and using it without your permission.
[00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.994]  The government says anything that they collect on you belongs to them.
[00:39:47.034 --> 00:39:47.854]  It doesn't belong to you.
[00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:56.242]  Any data that they scrape on the internet by following you, by watching you, any of that
[00:39:57.062 --> 00:39:57.923]  Belongs to them.
[00:39:58.543 --> 00:40:07.250]  This is an old doctrine, going back to telephones, the old PIN doctrine, where they said, well, you know, we can get some information from people about getting a search warrant.
[00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.491]  And so that's what the government is doing.
[00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:10.233]  That's why it was so important for them.
[00:40:10.253 --> 00:40:13.896]  They tried so many times with CISPA, multiple times with CISPA.
[00:40:14.216 --> 00:40:15.637]  Then ACTA, SOPA, PIPA.
[00:40:16.057 --> 00:40:18.920]  Then they took the P out of CISPA and they got it passed.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.261]  C-I-S-A.
[00:40:22.042 --> 00:40:23.343]  We had Aaron Schwartz.
[00:40:24.537 --> 00:40:28.359]  Go to fight that very, very rigorously.
[00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:30.840]  And then they trumped up charges against him.
[00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:33.262]  There were total trumped up charges.
[00:40:33.322 --> 00:40:39.805]  And of course, his family said they drove him to suicide, saying that they were going to put him in jail for 30 years.
[00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:46.529]  And then the prosecutor's husband, as she was getting criticized for overzealous prosecution that drove him to suicide,
[00:40:47.423 --> 00:40:58.251]  The prosecutor's husband, her name is Ortiz, he tweeted out that she had offered him a deal just like three months in prison and he turned it down.
[00:40:58.291 --> 00:40:58.992]  He was a fighter.
[00:40:59.772 --> 00:41:01.414]  He was a meek guy, but he was tough.
[00:41:02.335 --> 00:41:04.416]  And he had fought CISPA many times.
[00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:05.576]  But they kept at it.
[00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:17.819]  They wanted that because with that, all this information that these people, Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them are constantly monitoring everything that you're doing, all of that can be turned over to the government and you can't sue them.
[00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:22.560]  Or they can turn it over and they can sell it to people and you can't do anything about that.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.801]  And of course when you look at the situations that have come out,
[00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:30.943]  The fight back and forth, which really is a bureaucratic fight.
[00:41:31.344 --> 00:41:39.193]  Number one, the issue of whether or not your ISP, your Internet Service Provider, is going to be able to collect and monetize your data.
[00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:44.739]  That really is, in one aspect, it's a big fight over
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.521]  Bureaucratic power.
[00:41:46.561 --> 00:41:48.662]  Who is going to control and regulate the Internet?
[00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:51.463]  But it's also a fight between corporations.
[00:41:52.164 --> 00:41:55.946]  Google, Facebook, these other social media companies, they already have the capability to do that.
[00:41:56.606 --> 00:41:59.088]  They don't want competition from your ISP.
[00:41:59.788 --> 00:42:01.949]  And so, that is what's going on.
[00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:03.390]  You don't have privacy, folks.
[00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:07.252]  The only question is how much deeper are they going to go before we start putting some restrictions on it?
[00:42:07.512 --> 00:42:10.454]  So that's why this article from The Guardian is interesting.
[00:42:10.934 --> 00:42:22.037]  They say they move to try to get human rights codified to protect our minds and our brains from being manipulated or having data taken out of them.
[00:42:22.057 --> 00:42:31.859]  It says the response to rapid advances being made with technology is that reader-alter-brain activity, and which many expect to bring enormous benefit to people's lives in the coming year.
[00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:34.219]  Be able to play video games with your mind, as they say.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.240]  So those are the enormous benefits.
[00:42:37.256 --> 00:42:48.319]  Do you really think that being able to play video games with your mind, that being able to type on Facebook with your mind, do you really think that that is worth giving them access to your mind?
[00:42:49.517 --> 00:42:55.280]  We've had the military come in and say, well, you know, we want to give our soldiers superhuman capabilities.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.741]  That's the latest attack that we're seeing here from DARPA.
[00:42:57.761 --> 00:43:05.065]  But in the past, they've said we want to make sure that people who are suffering from PTSD, that we can selectively remove memories.
[00:43:05.885 --> 00:43:08.787]  Or maybe we'll put some happy thoughts in there for you.
[00:43:10.014 --> 00:43:11.294]  Think about the implications of that.
[00:43:11.354 --> 00:43:17.196]  That is one of the worst sci-fi dystopian scenarios you can imagine.
[00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:22.378]  And that's what these people are actively working on and spending your taxpayer money doing.
[00:43:22.398 --> 00:43:23.718]  They have unlimited funds.
[00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:28.020]  Because we're not limited, folks, to the income tax.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.960]  That is not our budget.
[00:43:30.049 --> 00:43:31.792]  They want us to be in debt.
[00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:34.477]  They don't fully pay it every year.
[00:43:34.517 --> 00:43:38.183]  The Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, they want us to be in their debt.
[00:43:39.085 --> 00:43:41.709]  They want to increase the welfare programs.
[00:43:41.729 --> 00:43:43.673]  That's what they did throughout all the third world.
[00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:57.798]  McNamara, when he got finished messing up everything with Vietnam, he went to work for the International Monetary Funds and the World Bank, and I forget which one of those he was at, but they were, I think it was the IMF, International Monetary Fund.
[00:43:58.278 --> 00:44:06.262]  They were accused of rent-seeking because they encouraged all of these third world countries to ramp up their welfare system.
[00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:13.547]  Not to build infrastructure, not to invest in capital or invest in manufacturing or whatever to help people get started in their countries.
[00:44:14.307 --> 00:44:18.412]  They just wanted them to create welfare and they would continue to loan them money.
[00:44:18.892 --> 00:44:21.415]  And they would continue to go into debt because it's not productive.
[00:44:21.455 --> 00:44:23.277]  We can see where that goes with Venezuela.
[00:44:23.817 --> 00:44:28.242]  So they said the IMF is engaging in rent-seeking.
[00:44:28.482 --> 00:44:31.586]  Everything that they're doing now is rent-seeking.
[00:44:32.261 --> 00:44:33.942]  They want to take over your cars.
[00:44:34.002 --> 00:44:39.786]  They want to lease the cars, not just the car itself, but they want to lease it to you by the ride.
[00:44:39.826 --> 00:44:40.986]  They don't want you to own it.
[00:44:41.587 --> 00:44:43.428]  They're seeking renters.
[00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:46.069]  They want you to be their perpetual renters.
[00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:52.453]  They want to make homes so expensive, so small, lock you up in the cities, that you won't be able to own even your little coffin apartment.
[00:44:53.134 --> 00:44:54.695]  They want rent-seeking.
[00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:56.416]  That's what it's all about.
[00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:58.897]  That's what the debt that we have is all about.
[00:44:58.957 --> 00:45:01.699]  It's the government, the Federal Reserve, pushing all of that for us.
[00:45:02.591 --> 00:45:16.720]  And so when I look at what they're doing with all the mind stuff, and we've talked about this a long time, about how, yes, they really are trying to do things to you, and they make fun of it, and they show people sitting there with tinfoil wrapped around their head.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.301]  I don't think that that is effective.
[00:45:19.822 --> 00:45:23.224]  But you better believe that they're looking for ways to read your mind.
[00:45:24.045 --> 00:45:27.786]  And of course, back in the 1980s, we had Michael Aquino, who was with the NSA, Colonel.
[00:45:28.527 --> 00:45:32.608]  He went on Oprah Winfrey, dressed up like Eddie Munster, like a Satanist.
[00:45:33.169 --> 00:45:38.271]  Openly talking about his Satanism, but also talking about how they would use ELF.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.924]  To control people's minds, or attitudes, or emotions, that type of thing.
[00:45:46.146 --> 00:45:47.727]  But let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi.
[00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:49.329]  Is she suffering from this already?
[00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:50.470]  Is she the first?
[00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.512]  Because quite frankly, I'm not saying that she is.
[00:45:53.613 --> 00:45:57.456]  I'm joking about this, folks, so that you don't think that we're throwing out a conspiracy theory here.
[00:45:57.496 --> 00:46:01.760]  But understand that I don't think, I think she's getting old, okay?
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.362]  But understand
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:16.390]  That just as we have seen the NSA and their dragnet surveillance, the Deep State, turn first against politicians, they will use the mind control stuff first against politicians.
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:25.678]  So the very people who are going to be the most at risk for this are the ones who could fix it if they had a backbone.
[00:46:26.218 --> 00:46:26.679]  But they don't.
[00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:28.392]  They don't have a backbone.
[00:46:28.412 --> 00:46:29.773]  But let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi.
[00:46:30.433 --> 00:46:31.634]  Let's play this video for her.
[00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:32.715]  She garbles words.
[00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:35.657]  She mispronounces countries in a short speech.
[00:46:35.717 --> 00:46:38.759]  And when I saw this, it just reminded me of Max Headroom.
[00:46:38.779 --> 00:46:44.384]  So we put a little bit of Max Headroom here at the front of it for those of you who don't remember Max Headroom from the 1980s.
[00:46:45.104 --> 00:46:52.410]  What you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer to one of the greatest epics ever produced in the history of television.
[00:46:53.462 --> 00:46:53.902]  There's more.
[00:46:54.683 --> 00:46:56.663]  Because you are going to see it as well.
[00:46:57.204 --> 00:46:57.804]  Yes, it.
[00:46:58.104 --> 00:46:58.684]  Yes, it.
[00:46:59.125 --> 00:46:59.425]  So!
[00:47:00.205 --> 00:47:04.587]  Sit back, relax, and enjoy my film.
[00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:12.695]  ...and Hassan Shourey for your well-deserved recognitions tonight.
[00:47:13.155 --> 00:47:24.768]  Today, the strong moral voice of Refugees International, we degrade our values and our security when we slam the door in the face of children fleeing atrocities.
[00:47:25.669 --> 00:47:45.146]  With the specter of famine looming over northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen, slashing the State Department budget and foreign aid budget by 30% would only deepen the crisis facing the children.
[00:47:46.348 --> 00:47:49.249]  Children need America to be their champion.
[00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.531]  Thank you, Refugees International, for your leadership.
[00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:57.373]  Thank you for your moral advocacy and your action.
[00:47:57.793 --> 00:48:02.875]  Thank you for challenging us to honor our values as a nation.
[00:48:03.175 --> 00:48:05.857]  Thank you all for the honor to participate this evening.
[00:48:05.897 --> 00:48:06.637]  Thank you so much.
[00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:15.906]  As I pointed out on the American Mirror, she had one task, and that was to put to rest questions about her health.
[00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.671]  I think she went a little bit deeper into it right there.
[00:48:20.172 --> 00:48:22.775]  Okay, so there's a Reuters poll that came out.
[00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:29.598]  And the question that DC Clothesline asks is, can Americans even think for themselves anymore?
[00:48:29.818 --> 00:48:33.759]  Are we buying into this kind of tribalistic groupthink?
[00:48:34.499 --> 00:48:42.661]  And what Reuters did was they asked people to consider a series of statements that President Trump had made on things like taxes, crime, the news media, and a lot of other issues.
[00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:45.262]  And they got Democrats and they got Republicans.
[00:48:45.362 --> 00:48:50.003]  And they would take a control group and they would read the statements to them, not telling them who had said it.
[00:48:50.811 --> 00:48:54.237]  And then they would, to the other group, tell them that President Trump had said it.
[00:48:54.277 --> 00:48:58.043]  Well, the Democrats then, the disagreement went way up.
[00:48:58.424 --> 00:49:01.108]  And for the Republicans, the agreement went way up.
[00:49:01.569 --> 00:49:03.392]  See, what is concerning about this?
[00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:08.705]  Is that this is really kind of a form of identity politics.
[00:49:08.785 --> 00:49:10.887]  It's kind of a form of tribalism.
[00:49:10.927 --> 00:49:12.108]  We have to look at this.
[00:49:12.168 --> 00:49:14.370]  It's like the situation Chuck Schumer said the other day.
[00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:21.136]  He said, if we get into a situation where Breitbart and New York Times are both considered, then we've lost democracy.
[00:49:21.156 --> 00:49:25.040]  It's like, no, if you do that, then people are thinking for themselves.
[00:49:26.223 --> 00:49:29.465]  You shouldn't disregard somebody because of the source.
[00:49:29.545 --> 00:49:33.807]  And the source of these statements, because they're coming from President Trump, doesn't make them true.
[00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:34.907]  It doesn't make them false.
[00:49:35.508 --> 00:49:39.470]  It doesn't make things true or false simply because Breitbart or the New York Times says it.
[00:49:40.765 --> 00:49:54.096]  Now we understand because we look at this and we might disagree so often with what the New York Times says and we agree with maybe Breitbart or whatever, so maybe we're skewed with that and that does, you can't help but be influenced by that.
[00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:59.181]  But you've got to not fall into this identity politics and this kind of tribalism, into celebrity politics.
[00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:00.402]  Today we had on the Drudge Report.
[00:50:00.942 --> 00:50:02.143]  They had the rock-up.
[00:50:02.163 --> 00:50:04.505]  Dwayne Johnson didn't even read the article.
[00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:06.487]  It's not the celebrity that we need.
[00:50:06.527 --> 00:50:07.849]  We don't need celebrity.
[00:50:07.889 --> 00:50:10.711]  We need a populace that thinks for itself.
[00:50:11.652 --> 00:50:12.573]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:14.595]  And are we even capable of that?
[00:50:15.115 --> 00:50:18.959]  Take a look at these stories about Nordstrom selling $425 jeans that are covered in fake mud.
[00:50:18.979 --> 00:50:19.319]  Seriously?
[00:50:22.537 --> 00:50:23.299]  Call it Nerdstrom.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:31.575]  They've got these things selling, as they point out in the story, more than a 40-inch television because they have these genes that perpetually look dirty.
[00:50:32.478 --> 00:50:39.600]  Okay, so now it's not enough to look ragged, but now you can buy jeans, jackets, even shoes that look perpetually dirty.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:54.304]  So I guess presumably you can look like some hip hippie from Berkeley or something, as a guy who has a show called Dirty Job said, they're a costume for wealthy people who see work as ironic, not iconic.
[00:50:55.044 --> 00:50:56.084]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:50:56.944 --> 00:50:57.785]  Where does this all end?
[00:50:57.825 --> 00:50:58.325]  Well, it doesn't.
[00:50:58.345 --> 00:50:59.225]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:08.937 --> 00:51:09.698]  What is going on?
[00:51:09.818 --> 00:51:11.079]  We're all Russian agents.
[00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:12.541]  We're all... I mean, I support Trump.
[00:51:12.841 --> 00:51:14.563]  I get the missile attack made him look strong.
[00:51:15.104 --> 00:51:21.490]  I'm just saying I don't believe the chemical attack was facade because they've caught the rebels doing it before and they don't have any proof he did it.
[00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:22.671]  I'm not even attacking Trump.
[00:51:23.032 --> 00:51:25.875]  In fact, in a Machiavellian way, I'm saying, okay, you blew up an empty airfield and
[00:51:26.415 --> 00:51:27.736]  Shut them up about how you're a Russian agent.
[00:51:27.776 --> 00:51:28.956]  I kind of sickly support it.
[00:51:29.016 --> 00:51:29.617]  I've admitted that.
[00:51:29.997 --> 00:51:34.339]  Kind of becoming like Machiavelli, because now we've got a guy in there doing their own tricks against them.
[00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:37.321]  But I'm just saying, how do we know Assad did it?
[00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:40.382]  And now in newspapers everywhere, I am an Assad agent.
[00:51:41.043 --> 00:51:41.923]  We're together.
[00:51:42.723 --> 00:51:43.144]  Look at us.
[00:51:43.164 --> 00:51:44.184]  We got together.
[00:51:44.304 --> 00:51:45.245]  Are you getting orders from Assad?
[00:51:45.945 --> 00:51:47.806]  Yeah, I was just talking to him on the phone right now.
[00:51:47.826 --> 00:51:51.086]  He's actually here via Skype on the other TV.
[00:51:51.367 --> 00:51:54.007]  But my thing with that is I go, I don't care.
[00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.688]  I don't care if it was actors.
[00:51:55.888 --> 00:51:57.048]  I don't care if they just had kids.
[00:51:57.088 --> 00:51:57.608]  Go like that.
[00:51:58.188 --> 00:52:04.570]  The big picture is that the world saw a bad thing, so the big man has to go boom on the bad thing.
[00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.551]  And now women respect him.
[00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:08.911]  Here in America, they go, oh, the patriarchy's back.
[00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:10.912]  Because we know feminists deep down want the patriarchy.
[00:52:11.852 --> 00:52:16.678]  Obama's legacy is obliterated because he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got cucked.
[00:52:17.158 --> 00:52:18.119]  So that's awesome.
[00:52:18.139 --> 00:52:20.202]  He's killed, as you say, the Russian theory.
[00:52:20.482 --> 00:52:25.067]  I think the neocons even are getting too much hubris, too confident they're going to be wiped out.
[00:52:26.749 --> 00:52:31.194]  And the biggest picture is these terrorists are absolute animals.
[00:52:31.535 --> 00:52:33.017]  They dismember our soldiers.
[00:52:33.237 --> 00:52:34.999]  They tear out beating hearts and eat them.
[00:52:35.259 --> 00:52:40.125]  They sell fingers and the market there for as war trophies.
[00:52:40.185 --> 00:52:44.611]  There's literally a market for body parts just as accoutrements.
[00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:46.652]  So, we don't negotiate with them.
[00:52:46.692 --> 00:52:48.333]  We don't send them democracy.
[00:52:48.593 --> 00:52:50.654]  We just scare them with huge fireworks.
[00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:54.917]  They drop this twenty-something thousand pound bomb and it kills them all.
[00:52:55.377 --> 00:52:58.979]  I mean, that's a finally, and then they say, oh, he wants a military dictatorship.
[00:52:59.019 --> 00:53:01.241]  He says, I've given them total authorization.
[00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:04.863]  There was this, to carry out his constitutional orders.
[00:53:05.343 --> 00:53:08.905]  This micromanaging, call Obama, and he would never answer the phone.
[00:53:09.146 --> 00:53:11.327]  Sir, we have, we have been logged in those sites.
[00:53:11.367 --> 00:53:11.887]  We can't kill him.
[00:53:12.187 --> 00:53:12.708]  Oh, yeah.
[00:53:13.068 --> 00:53:13.908]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:53:13.928 --> 00:53:14.629]  Gavin, what do you make of that?
[00:53:15.209 --> 00:53:16.670]  I think we've crippled our guys over there.
[00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:20.072]  I was talking to Terry Shepard recently and I said, how do we win this war?
[00:53:20.132 --> 00:53:21.834]  And he goes, let us do our job.
[00:53:22.354 --> 00:53:26.096]  I mean, right now they've got RPGs and they go, we're getting shot at from a mosque.
[00:53:26.116 --> 00:53:26.517]  What do we do?
[00:53:26.557 --> 00:53:27.557]  And they've got to call up.
[00:53:27.878 --> 00:53:34.102]  I talked to one vet who told me, he said, our guy had to pretend he misunderstood in order to save our lives.
[00:53:34.122 --> 00:53:36.744]  Because they were shooting from the mosque and the guy said, don't shoot the mosque.
[00:53:36.764 --> 00:53:37.984]  And he said, what was that?
[00:53:38.064 --> 00:53:38.245]  What?
[00:53:38.325 --> 00:53:39.225]  Shoot the mosque?
[00:53:39.285 --> 00:53:39.866]  Oh, what?
[00:53:40.866 --> 00:53:41.666]  No, I agree.
[00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:41.726]  No.
[00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:14.299]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:14.979]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:15.019 --> 00:54:22.983]  In our next segment, not in the next segment, but in the next hour, we're going to be talking to Bill Jasper from The New American.
[00:54:23.003 --> 00:54:24.224]  We're going to talk about free speech.
[00:54:24.244 --> 00:54:25.464]  We're going to talk about the UN.
[00:54:25.985 --> 00:54:27.485]  It's getting involved in free speech.
[00:54:27.526 --> 00:54:35.710]  And of course, I'm sure he's going to want to talk about the UN's involvement on Monday with President Trump and North Korea.
[00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:37.631]  Before we get back to the news,
[00:54:38.578 --> 00:54:43.747]  I just want to remind you that we have a limited supply of DNA Force coming to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:43.787 --> 00:54:46.312]  It's been sold out for months at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:46.552 --> 00:54:47.314]  It's very difficult.
[00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:54.351]  And expensive to do batches of DNA Force because of one of the key ingredients in it that is very unique.
[00:54:55.011 --> 00:54:56.311]  Bio-PQQ.
[00:54:56.972 --> 00:55:04.073]  And we have over 170 studies that you can take a look at at InfoWarsStore.com that will tell you about that.
[00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:05.793]  But it's got a lot of other things in it as well.
[00:55:05.873 --> 00:55:10.674]  CoQ10, systemic enzymes, Bio-PQQ, and many other things.
[00:55:10.794 --> 00:55:12.154]  Take a look at the reviews.
[00:55:12.274 --> 00:55:15.955]  Take a look at some of the research about what Bio-PQQ does for you.
[00:55:16.395 --> 00:55:16.815]  And of course,
[00:55:17.695 --> 00:55:27.577]  In a nutshell, if you think of your shoelaces and twist them like a DNA strand, you've got a cap on your shoelaces, on a DNA that's called a telomere.
[00:55:28.177 --> 00:55:35.078]  As that starts to erode naturally over time, the strand starts to unravel, just like your shoelaces would.
[00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:39.899]  So just like you've got a cap on your shoelaces to keep them from unraveling, you have the telomeres to do that.
[00:55:39.939 --> 00:55:44.280]  And you can actually, studies have looked at it, the life expectancy of someone can be
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:50.824]  Pretty much interpolated pretty accurately from looking at the length of their telomeres.
[00:55:51.324 --> 00:55:57.608]  So BioPQQ has had a lot of studies that show that has an effect on that in particular.
[00:55:58.009 --> 00:55:59.830]  But take a look at DNA Force.
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:06.134]  If you want to get on the list as it comes back in stock, you can now sign up for that because it's in such high demand.
[00:56:06.174 --> 00:56:11.178]  Again, DNA Force coming up again at InfoWarsStore.com and you can get on the list there.
[00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:14.403]  Okay, going back to where we just were.
[00:56:14.443 --> 00:56:16.708]  I mean, it's not just these insane genes.
[00:56:16.768 --> 00:56:17.650]  And I had Nico...
[00:56:18.729 --> 00:56:25.835]  Tell me on the earpiece here that Nordstrom's also been selling like a large rock that's wrapped in leather or in a leather pocket or something.
[00:56:26.656 --> 00:56:35.384]  They're selling these $425 jeans that are covered in fake mud and of course you can get a jacket that's covered in fake mud to look like you're really working or something.
[00:56:35.404 --> 00:56:36.685]  I don't really understand.
[00:56:36.725 --> 00:56:38.567]  They know what their market is.
[00:56:39.447 --> 00:56:42.270]  It seems like a total idiocracy in my opinion.
[00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.332]  But then of course, here's another part of idiocracy.
[00:56:44.352 --> 00:56:45.252]  We've got BMW.
[00:56:46.161 --> 00:56:47.324]  And of course they own many.
[00:56:47.925 --> 00:56:52.534]  They have successfully developed a car that will change colors based on the driver's mood.
[00:56:53.255 --> 00:56:56.181]  This is the silliness of our technology that's coming up.
[00:56:56.842 --> 00:56:57.604]  Nothing that's going to make it...
[00:56:59.218 --> 00:57:00.599]  Any safer or working better.
[00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:02.160]  And this is the most amazing thing.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.023]  These are the people who are working so hard to make sure that you're not even going to be driving your car.
[00:57:07.044 --> 00:57:09.425]  So who cares what your mood is inside?
[00:57:09.445 --> 00:57:17.511]  I mean, you know, if you wanted to know if somebody's got road rage and you could see that coming down the road, that might be a useful guide.
[00:57:17.571 --> 00:57:19.672]  But still, it's just it's absolutely amazing.
[00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:21.353]  And yet we continue to see this.
[00:57:21.454 --> 00:57:27.258]  Ikea is laughing about the fact that they've got a bag that looks that they sell for 99 cents, a tote bag.
[00:57:27.998 --> 00:57:35.082]  And a high fashion outlet has put one out that looks exactly like it except for the IKEA name on the handle for $2,145.
[00:57:36.743 --> 00:57:44.827]  So by putting the IKEA label on the handle, they knock $2,144 off of that product.
[00:57:45.108 --> 00:57:46.568]  This is the idiocracy that we have.
[00:57:47.009 --> 00:57:56.434]  But then here, seriously folks, when we look at the story from Daily Mail talking about a military analyst who looked at the military parades that they had, and we've pointed out
[00:57:57.335 --> 00:57:59.897]  The rocket that had the bent nose cone on it.
[00:58:00.597 --> 00:58:06.301]  And one military expert looked at it and said, look, even their sunglasses are fake.
[00:58:06.781 --> 00:58:08.962]  But he said, these are fake guns.
[00:58:09.002 --> 00:58:10.283]  They don't have RPGs.
[00:58:10.323 --> 00:58:18.068]  And of course, part of the reason for that is they don't want any of those soldiers to fire an RPG at Kim Jong-un while he's watching their parade.
[00:58:18.668 --> 00:58:21.010]  But you also have to remember, just like we heard
[00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.271]  Uh, and wag the dog.
[00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:25.673]  We had Robert De Niro say, it's a pageant.
[00:58:26.053 --> 00:58:26.873]  It's just a pageant.
[00:58:27.254 --> 00:58:33.017]  You have to understand when they're showing all these videos about blowing up the White House, a lot of that is for internal consumption.
[00:58:33.378 --> 00:58:35.659]  They don't have the capability to do it.
[00:58:35.899 --> 00:58:38.701]  Let's not let them railroad us into a war.
[00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:40.702]  Not them, not our General.
[00:58:40.742 --> 00:58:41.743]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:43.464 --> 00:58:45.245]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.946 --> 00:58:47.967]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.223 --> 00:58:55.724]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:58.124]  Listen to these headlines from just the last week.
[00:58:58.445 --> 00:59:01.946]  Four times in four days, Russian military aircraft fly off U.S.
[00:59:02.026 --> 00:59:03.646]  coast, some nuclear-capable.
[00:59:03.986 --> 00:59:04.226]  U.S.
[00:59:04.266 --> 00:59:06.347]  sends nuclear sniffer plane to Korea.
[00:59:06.567 --> 00:59:12.289]  China tests missile on deadly new destroyer ship near North Korea as it warns it's getting troops battle-ready.
[00:59:12.609 --> 00:59:12.869]  U.S.
[00:59:12.929 --> 00:59:15.049]  preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.
[00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:18.111]  Washington D.C.
[00:59:18.151 --> 00:59:20.632]  to hold massive coordinated terror attack drill.
[00:59:20.853 --> 00:59:23.314]  Feds prepare for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[00:59:23.535 --> 00:59:27.117]  North Korea flexes muscle in unprecedented live fire drill.
[00:59:27.377 --> 00:59:27.777]  D.C.
[00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:31.220]  area first responders prepare for a complex terror attack.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:31.920]  U.S.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:35.463]  Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel in Persian Gulf.
[00:59:35.743 --> 00:59:38.745]  Air Force launches test missile off California coast.
[00:59:39.145 --> 00:59:42.747]  Entire US Senate called for meeting on North Korea briefing.
[00:59:42.987 --> 00:59:47.890]  And now, NBC News is telling its audience what to do in case of a nuclear attack.
[00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.171]  Will this cold world war ever go hot?
[00:59:50.291 --> 00:59:52.592]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:54.373 --> 01:00:00.277]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:19.690]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:29.676]  In the next segment, we're going to be talking to William Jasper, the New American.
[01:00:29.696 --> 01:00:30.337]  We have an article of his
[01:00:37.924 --> 01:00:40.205]  News alternative, real and fake.
[01:00:40.225 --> 01:00:43.967]  He's going to be talking about the many ways in which we see censorship coming at us.
[01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:50.970]  And of course, we also want to talk to him about the new role for the United Nations that Donald Trump seems to envision.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:56.072]  There's some very troubling comments that he made that I talked about last night on the Nightly News.
[01:00:56.872 --> 01:01:04.603]  Saying that the United Nations is underperforming, but he sees a very big future for it in the future.
[01:01:04.683 --> 01:01:10.971]  He thinks that they should be the ones to solve international conflicts, that they should impose solutions on different nations.
[01:01:12.073 --> 01:01:13.214]  That's a very different tact.
[01:01:14.332 --> 01:01:19.975]  When Donald Trump was campaigning and when he first took office, he was saying that the United Nations needed to be scaled back.
[01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:23.356]  That it was a globalist cabal working for the bankers.
[01:01:23.436 --> 01:01:24.737]  And he was absolutely right about that.
[01:01:25.277 --> 01:01:29.539]  Now he is talking to the United Nations Security Council on Monday, interestingly,
[01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:37.044]  Before he talks to the Senate, before he talks to the House about what's going on in North Korea.
[01:01:37.244 --> 01:01:40.286]  Is he getting permission from international agencies?
[01:01:40.706 --> 01:01:55.736]  As we saw Leon Panetta tell then-Senator Jeff Sessions, they said, we're going to talk to NATO, we're going to talk to the UN and our allies, and we'll make a decision about what we're going to do about conflicts around the world, and then we'll probably inform you.
[01:01:56.136 --> 01:01:57.037]  Probably inform you.
[01:01:57.637 --> 01:02:00.666]  So, he is informing them, maybe, of what they have already decided.
[01:02:00.766 --> 01:02:03.855]  I don't know, but the order is in reverse.
[01:02:05.137 --> 01:02:08.700]  It should be the decision of the American people and their elected representatives.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.760]  They should declare war.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.421]  They should declare what the strategy is.
[01:02:11.882 --> 01:02:13.503]  And then we should have them.
[01:02:13.543 --> 01:02:15.564]  There's that clip where they were going back and forth.
[01:02:16.005 --> 01:02:17.406]  A very famous clip that we've played.
[01:02:17.426 --> 01:02:18.787]  We don't have time to play that right now.
[01:02:19.187 --> 01:02:21.108]  But of course we also had some other movements.
[01:02:21.148 --> 01:02:22.929]  Yesterday we had Donald Trump.
[01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:25.611]  We're going to talk about this after the interviews.
[01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:27.513]  I want to talk about the tax cut.
[01:02:27.593 --> 01:02:29.714]  It's a very good tax cut plan.
[01:02:29.754 --> 01:02:33.177]  They had exactly what they had run on.
[01:02:34.192 --> 01:02:34.592]  Pretty much.
[01:02:35.553 --> 01:02:39.357]  And I think it's good that Donald Trump got out ahead of Paul Ryan.
[01:02:39.697 --> 01:02:43.340]  Because I think it was a big mistake to let Paul Ryan put together Obamacare.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.283]  And we're still playing around with Obamacare.
[01:02:46.303 --> 01:02:50.267]  They're still beating up on the conservatives who want to get repeal.
[01:02:51.027 --> 01:02:53.129]  And it looks like the conservatives are now going to cave.
[01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.472]  They call the people who are opposing this, interestingly enough,
[01:02:57.153 --> 01:03:03.066]  Just like they call this Rothschild banker who's running for the presidency of France, Macron.
[01:03:03.267 --> 01:03:05.011]  They call these Republicans.
[01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:06.727]  Centrists.
[01:03:07.828 --> 01:03:09.209]  Why aren't they hardliners?
[01:03:09.729 --> 01:03:18.513]  Why aren't they people who refuse to do anything about this socialistic, fascist, and I'm talking about economic fascism, crony capitalism?
[01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:28.118]  This Obamacare system that we've got is both socialist in that it redistributes income from some people to other people for health care, for health insurance, I should say.
[01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:36.943]  And it is also crony capitalism, economic fascism, and that it forces us to buy products from corporations.
[01:03:37.544 --> 01:03:39.646]  And it directly subsidizes those corporations.
[01:03:40.828 --> 01:03:41.348]  That's wrong.
[01:03:42.338 --> 01:03:43.119]  It's morally wrong.
[01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.659]  It's economically wrong.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.901]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:48.502]  And I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[01:03:48.522 --> 01:03:54.265]  The Supreme Court has been on both sides of a lot of issues, including slavery, freedom of speech, many other things.
[01:03:54.325 --> 01:03:58.868]  And they are wrong on this issue, just like they're wrong on abortion.
[01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.370]  But they're obviously wrong about this.
[01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.951]  They were obviously blackmailed.
[01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:05.672]  Why aren't these people being called radicals?
[01:04:05.852 --> 01:04:11.196]  Why aren't they being called obstructionists, these Republicans, who want to fight Obamacare repeal?
[01:04:12.247 --> 01:04:14.028]  Why are they being called hardliners?
[01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:15.409]  It's absolutely amazing to me.
[01:04:15.469 --> 01:04:22.774]  These are the people that Trump praised and then criticized the people who wanted to stand up for the campaign promises.
[01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:26.416]  So, Obamacare repeal has gone completely south.
[01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:31.459]  And interestingly enough, we've got California now going on to full socialism.
[01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:35.802]  California's single-payer health care bill passes the first committee test.
[01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:41.617]  And they say that Democrats and Republicans, however, have signaled unease.
[01:04:41.977 --> 01:04:44.678]  They said the major question is, how are they going to pay for it?
[01:04:45.139 --> 01:04:46.499]  Well, they don't have money to pay for it.
[01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:51.561]  They're talking about universal health care, and I'm talking about literally worldwide universal health care.
[01:04:51.581 --> 01:04:58.924]  They're going to give everything to people regardless of their legal immigration status, and they don't have any way to pay for it.
[01:04:59.425 --> 01:05:01.285]  This is the path to Venezuela.
[01:05:01.306 --> 01:05:02.246]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:05:04.352 --> 01:05:13.335]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[01:05:13.755 --> 01:05:23.259]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts.
[01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:28.342]  And gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government.
[01:05:28.522 --> 01:05:32.785]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed.
[01:05:33.025 --> 01:05:37.408]  And all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:40.970]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep?
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.912]  It's because that money is being held by the federal government.
[01:05:44.212 --> 01:05:44.953]  Don't believe me?
[01:05:45.273 --> 01:05:48.415]  Just read the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby.
[01:05:48.675 --> 01:05:57.360]  She was a whistleblower from the Department of Education in the 1980s, and her tome describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.922]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:03.749 --> 01:06:07.612]  I want to tell you about some of the products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:07.632 --> 01:06:09.473]  We are under constant attack.
[01:06:09.994 --> 01:06:12.195]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[01:06:12.395 --> 01:06:15.277]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[01:06:15.317 --> 01:06:29.648]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:31.969]  They can't get to us that way.
[01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:35.171]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.172]  They don't have that power.
[01:06:36.632 --> 01:06:39.174]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:41.935]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:06:42.376 --> 01:06:45.217]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:45.237 --> 01:06:46.878]  This is by listener request.
[01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:52.362]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at InfoWarsStore.com in limited supply.
[01:06:52.382 --> 01:06:57.245]  Again, if you're not using fluoride free toothpaste by now,
[01:06:58.085 --> 01:06:59.427]  You're absolutely insane.
[01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:04.151]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[01:07:04.752 --> 01:07:09.876]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[01:07:10.637 --> 01:07:13.359]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[01:07:13.379 --> 01:07:19.205]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at infowarsstore.com with the new bubblegum flavor.
[01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:31.807]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:07:32.107 --> 01:07:34.928]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.008]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[01:07:37.348 --> 01:07:48.790]  That's why we need your support more than ever because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model.
[01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:54.537]  To drown out independent voices, so support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:13.516]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:08:15.137 --> 01:08:21.860]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:26.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:33.226 --> 01:08:36.328]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, April 27th.
[01:08:36.348 --> 01:08:40.250]  I'm David Knight, and joining me now is William F. Jasper.
[01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:41.790]  He's from The New American.
[01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:46.773]  Of course, they have a bi-weekly magazine that you can get.
[01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:50.215]  It's a great source if you really value your freedom.
[01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:56.059]  If you really value the Constitution and want to know what's going on, that is their perspective.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.481]  It's one of my favorite publications to read.
[01:08:58.522 --> 01:09:01.144]  They're also online at thenewamerican.com.
[01:09:01.164 --> 01:09:04.566]  Now, William F. Jasper is the senior editor of the New American.
[01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:10.051]  He has a very well-earned reputation as one of America's top investigative reporters.
[01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:13.514]  He's written several books, Global Tyranny, Step by Step.
[01:09:14.054 --> 01:09:22.243]  The United Nations exposed, and of course twice a year the New American publishes a congressional scorecard called the Freedom Index that rates every member of the U.S.
[01:09:22.263 --> 01:09:24.265]  House and Senate on key issues.
[01:09:24.705 --> 01:09:33.094]  So I want to talk to, he had an article earlier this week about what's going on with freedom of the press and of course it's been in the news a lot.
[01:09:33.114 --> 01:09:33.534]  We have
[01:09:34.662 --> 01:09:39.146]  The fights that are going on in Berkeley with Ann Coulter trying to shut down free speech.
[01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:43.830]  Of course the left used to vigorously defend freedom of speech.
[01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:45.151]  Now they don't even defend that.
[01:09:45.311 --> 01:09:45.972]  They don't want to.
[01:09:46.012 --> 01:09:48.995]  They will try to censor anything that they don't agree with.
[01:09:49.675 --> 01:09:51.056]  And right there it's in the
[01:09:51.997 --> 01:09:55.519]  The institution that we have Janet Napolitano as president of.
[01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:57.000]  I don't think we've talked enough about that.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.101]  But I want to talk to him about that.
[01:09:58.121 --> 01:10:04.764]  I also want to talk to him about this meeting that Donald Trump had with the UN Security Council earlier this week.
[01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:09.027]  And some of the comments that came out of that were reported in the New American.
[01:10:09.047 --> 01:10:10.428]  So I want to talk to him about that as well.
[01:10:10.448 --> 01:10:14.310]  But let's talk about what's going on with the freedom of press first.
[01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:15.691]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Jasper.
[01:10:19.207 --> 01:10:20.428]  I don't have any audio.
[01:10:20.448 --> 01:10:21.349]  Do you guys have audio?
[01:10:21.369 --> 01:10:26.092]  I think... Okay, let's... Am I coming through?
[01:10:26.172 --> 01:10:27.293]  Okay, now we got it.
[01:10:27.513 --> 01:10:27.793]  Go ahead.
[01:10:28.253 --> 01:10:28.634]  Okay.
[01:10:28.714 --> 01:10:28.974]  Alright.
[01:10:30.195 --> 01:10:31.136]  Yes, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:31.156 --> 01:10:32.176]  Are we on now?
[01:10:32.216 --> 01:10:32.777]  We got it now.
[01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.198]  Go ahead.
[01:10:34.218 --> 01:10:34.398]  Okay.
[01:10:34.538 --> 01:10:35.959]  It's great being back with you, David.
[01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:36.619]  Thank you.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.942]  Now, you were saying on Tuesday you had an article.
[01:10:40.482 --> 01:10:44.945]  You said all times... It's a tough time to be a patriot.
[01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:48.148]  We have to take a stand for truth, and part of that is being able to
[01:10:48.968 --> 01:10:53.732]  To read the truth, to speak the truth, to communicate, to push ideas back and forth.
[01:10:53.793 --> 01:11:01.980]  And in this you recall the warnings that Matt Drudge made when he visited InfoWars, saying you thought that Obamacare was shocking.
[01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:04.643]  He said you thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[01:11:04.723 --> 01:11:12.210]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you can't have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.591]  We're getting pretty close to that, aren't we?
[01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:31.711]  Well, we are, and the article that you referred to there on the news, fake, alternative fake, real, is part of a five article package in the print magazine, in which we have broken with tradition, put it all online.
[01:11:33.893 --> 01:11:33.933]  Uh,
[01:12:04.073 --> 01:12:04.234]  Yes.
[01:12:23.692 --> 01:12:30.035]  America and the globalist corporate organizations like Google, Facebook, etc.
[01:12:30.075 --> 01:12:31.555]  You've been covering this as well.
[01:12:32.636 --> 01:12:47.582]  Apple, Yahoo has been censoring the news and have explicitly come out saying they are going to censor, blackball those sites which they consider to be hate speech sites, hate crime sites.
[01:12:48.842 --> 01:12:50.684]  So that's one of the levels as well.
[01:12:50.724 --> 01:13:13.344]  And then a very important part that we cover as well is the deep state fake news thing, where we have the intelligence agencies, which are a branch of the government, but which are not operating under the laws that one can just look at and say, if they pass a law saying that we're going to censor this, that's one thing, but when they're doing
[01:13:13.444 --> 01:13:26.411]  They're doing it secretly through the intelligence agencies and they can take control of your computer via the internet if they can hack your website and shut it down.
[01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:30.473]  We've had our website shut down a number of times.
[01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:34.836]  It appeared at the times that the attacks were coming from China.
[01:13:36.497 --> 01:13:38.097]  That's what the security people
[01:13:39.558 --> 01:14:08.205]  Believed was the case, but as we've reported and I believe you have as well It's been documented now that the CIA and the NSA And perhaps some of our other agencies have now the software the capabilities to hack a website and make it appear That it's Isis or China or Russia or some others and thereby escape any Condemnation for that and of course
[01:14:09.205 --> 01:14:20.490]  It's alarming if China or Russia or some other totalitarian regime is hacking our computers and hacking our internet sites.
[01:14:21.831 --> 01:14:26.873]  It should be more frightening to Americans if our own government is doing that.
[01:14:27.273 --> 01:14:51.899]  Yeah, and as we pointed out in a couple of the articles, the Obama administration has taken this several steps forward with its Nudge Squad program, which it has modeled after the British intelligence model, where they, we quote in there and give excerpts from it, where they say the purpose is to destroy, defame,
[01:14:53.799 --> 01:15:01.908]  Discredit by publishing things on somebody else's website that will make them Look bad.
[01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:08.615]  So these are all things that we're having to deal with now and you're dealing with it right now at InfoWars
[01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:21.819]  Oh yeah, we've seen also the economic attacks that happen where they try to destroy you by boycotts or by delisting ads or by lawsuits if you expose their crony capitalism as we did with Chobani Yogurt.
[01:15:21.879 --> 01:15:35.363]  We talk about a guy who comes here, gets nearly a million dollars in government subsidies, he gets subsidized factories, he gets subsidized refugee workers and of course he goes everywhere from Davos to the UN to CBS 60 Minutes promoting
[01:15:35.843 --> 01:15:36.723]  We're good to go.
[01:15:58.226 --> 01:15:58.326]  Yes.
[01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:24.822]  We have a reversal from the Trump administration where they were saying, hey this is great, we got this information from Wikileaks and of course that wasn't secure information that was there.
[01:16:24.862 --> 01:16:29.007]  That was information about the DNC and Hillary's emails and so forth and so on.
[01:16:29.427 --> 01:16:36.535]  Many people have said that those Wikileaks said that they got that handed to them by people inside the DNC that were upset about
[01:16:37.276 --> 01:16:51.287]  The election being hacked against Bernie Sanders, then people who were consultants for the DNC, who were being paid by the DNC said, no, no, this was hacked, it was stolen from us by the Russians, and so tried to get the FBI involved in that.
[01:16:51.828 --> 01:16:54.450]  Nevertheless, when we look at this, Mr. Jasper,
[01:16:55.931 --> 01:17:02.017]  The Vault 7 stuff was, I've seen publication, I'm not sure about this, but the CIA is very upset about this.
[01:17:02.037 --> 01:17:03.378]  They want to go after Wicked Leaks.
[01:17:03.398 --> 01:17:05.640]  They say, we've got to stop these kinds of attacks.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.523]  And yet that information, I don't think, is classified or copyrighted.
[01:17:08.883 --> 01:17:18.452]  Because I've seen people argue that if it was classified, and they put that on your computer, then the CIA themselves could be prosecuted for releasing secrets.
[01:17:18.832 --> 01:17:21.134]  And if they copyrighted it, then everybody would know what it is.
[01:17:21.374 --> 01:17:26.018]  But everybody knows what it is now anyway, and the people who work with them, like Google, don't want to fix it.
[01:17:27.219 --> 01:17:42.871]  Right, and so that's this nebulous world that we're in right now, where the powers that be, and those that are exercising these huge powers within the intelligence agencies, without oversight from Congress,
[01:17:44.072 --> 01:17:57.824]  And again, it gets back to Congress abdicating responsibility, and Congress has abdicated responsibility because too many American citizens have abdicated their responsibility to insist that Congress monitor these things.
[01:17:58.104 --> 01:18:04.289]  Not just the intelligence agencies, but all of the regulatory agencies that they have created and allowed to run amok.
[01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:15.537]  That's a very good point that you make about the Vault 7 marble and the other things that have come out in Vault 7.
[01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:22.941]  The CIA and NSA are in a rather difficult position here because they can't have it both ways.
[01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:28.504]  They can't say that it's classified and therefore those who have received it should be prosecuted.
[01:18:30.446 --> 01:18:38.974]  If they are putting it on other people's computers and they can't just say that it's copyrighted and prosecute you for violating copyright either.
[01:18:39.534 --> 01:18:44.519]  You know, it's interesting, as I said, we've got so many different ways in which they're coming after us.
[01:18:44.599 --> 01:18:45.940]  It's because it's been effective.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:52.827]  The internet has allowed us to get this information out and it's allowed people to talk about things that were always censored.
[01:18:52.847 --> 01:18:54.108]  You know, when we talk about censorship,
[01:18:55.349 --> 01:18:58.313]  They can be what is chosen to be discussed.
[01:18:58.393 --> 01:19:02.717]  You and I both remember when we just had ABC, CBS, NBC as the nightly news.
[01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:06.061]  And they would all talk about exactly the same issues.
[01:19:06.101 --> 01:19:08.223]  And of course they all had the same take on it.
[01:19:08.263 --> 01:19:11.467]  You know, the CIA, Operation Mockingbird was helping them with that, okay?
[01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.268]  But they would talk about the same issues.
[01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:16.390]  They would have the same perspective on those same issues.
[01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:21.434]  So to have a different perspective, to bring up different issues, is what they cannot stand.
[01:19:21.454 --> 01:19:25.197]  And so they're coming at us bureaucratically with regulations over the internet.
[01:19:25.297 --> 01:19:26.998]  They're coming after us economically.
[01:19:27.618 --> 01:19:31.701]  Uh, by stopping ads and, uh, other things like that, lawsuits.
[01:19:32.061 --> 01:19:46.730]  They're coming after us with hacks and shutting us down in the sense that, and you can make that analogy as to, uh, an old style, uh, western town where the, uh, newspaper's not printing, uh, what the boss hog mayor wants, and they come in and they bust up the printing press.
[01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:49.812]  I mean, that's really what they're trying to do, that kind of thuggish, uh, tactic.
[01:19:50.792 --> 01:19:52.193]  Intimidating the distribution.
[01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:53.994]  So there's many ways that they're attacking us.
[01:19:54.014 --> 01:19:54.435]  Stay with us.
[01:19:54.455 --> 01:20:00.639]  When we come back, I want to get your comments now on what's going on with the UN about a constitutional declaration of war.
[01:20:00.839 --> 01:20:02.180]  What is Trump doing?
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.022]  Is he doing a... You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:07.084]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[01:20:07.144 --> 01:20:10.566]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, I don't know about this one.
[01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.989]  You know, and and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[01:20:14.029 --> 01:20:14.629]  I'm 42.
[01:20:15.369 --> 01:20:17.531]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[01:20:17.711 --> 01:20:19.172]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[01:20:21.094 --> 01:20:22.234]  No, no, I'm not.
[01:20:22.274 --> 01:20:22.935]  I'm terrible.
[01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:23.515]  I'm terrible.
[01:20:23.615 --> 01:20:30.761]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[01:20:31.361 --> 01:20:38.586]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[01:20:38.606 --> 01:20:42.089]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:48.714]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[01:20:48.754 --> 01:20:51.837]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[01:20:52.237 --> 01:20:53.518]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[01:20:53.538 --> 01:20:55.099]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[01:20:55.179 --> 01:20:56.320]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:03.526]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:06.289]  Yeah.
[01:21:06.469 --> 01:21:11.714]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[01:21:11.774 --> 01:21:13.476]  I felt it immediately.
[01:21:13.696 --> 01:21:15.738]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[01:21:15.798 --> 01:21:18.881]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.062]  It tastes good to me.
[01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:24.086]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[01:21:24.126 --> 01:21:26.268]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:29.951]  Bone broth.
[01:21:30.011 --> 01:21:35.133]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[01:21:35.153 --> 01:21:38.915]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[01:21:38.955 --> 01:21:46.718]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[01:21:46.778 --> 01:21:49.980]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my hair.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.801]  Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[01:21:51.821 --> 01:21:51.921]  Right?
[01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:55.387]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street.
[01:21:55.407 --> 01:21:58.672]  I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[01:21:58.692 --> 01:21:59.955]  No fear, nothing.
[01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:08.272]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[01:22:08.832 --> 01:22:10.633]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[01:22:11.353 --> 01:22:21.896]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[01:22:21.956 --> 01:22:23.196]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[01:22:23.256 --> 01:22:29.358]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[01:22:30.618 --> 01:22:32.859]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[01:22:32.919 --> 01:22:35.100]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:43.204]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.565]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[01:22:46.605 --> 01:22:49.446]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[01:22:49.546 --> 01:22:54.589]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[01:22:55.629 --> 01:23:02.514]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[01:23:06.216 --> 01:23:07.577]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:08.898]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:10.241]  Great!
[01:23:10.341 --> 01:23:11.322]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:23:11.462 --> 01:23:15.845]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:23:16.006 --> 01:23:17.547]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:23:17.687 --> 01:23:25.112]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:23:25.132 --> 01:23:26.053]  Wow, thank you.
[01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:28.375]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:23:28.515 --> 01:23:30.076]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:33.637]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:23:33.777 --> 01:23:34.817]  That's really incredible.
[01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:38.078]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:23:38.118 --> 01:23:39.358]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[01:23:39.398 --> 01:23:41.039]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:23:41.119 --> 01:23:42.239]  And I love you guys.
[01:23:42.259 --> 01:23:43.799]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:51.201]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:23:51.381 --> 01:23:52.201]  You will love it.
[01:23:52.442 --> 01:23:52.882]  I'm telling you.
[01:23:52.922 --> 01:23:54.262]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:58.923]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:58.984 --> 01:23:59.744]  It's a win-win.
[01:23:59.844 --> 01:24:00.904]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:24:03.425 --> 01:24:17.210]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:19.330]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to William F. Jasper.
[01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:20.971]  He is the Senior Editor of the New American.
[01:24:21.718 --> 01:24:23.599]  Publication of the John Birch Society.
[01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:30.442]  We were talking in the last segment about an extended series of articles that they did.
[01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:40.367]  Something that they usually do the extended articles just on the magazine that you can get on a bi-monthly basis, but they put this one online because it's very important what's happening to the First Amendment.
[01:24:40.467 --> 01:24:44.910]  And you know, it seems like yesterday that Matt Drudge was here, but it was back in October 6, 2015.
[01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:48.251]  I didn't realize it was that long ago.
[01:24:48.271 --> 01:24:49.272]  He talks about
[01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:55.999]  What Matt Drudge was saying in terms of the threat to free speech, and now we're seeing that in many different ways.
[01:24:56.059 --> 01:24:59.182]  But I want to change now this last segment that we've got with Mr. Jasper.
[01:25:00.231 --> 01:25:03.473]  And I want to talk about what's going on with the UN, because it's something that he's written about.
[01:25:03.513 --> 01:25:06.315]  He's written a book on the UN, United Nations Exposed.
[01:25:07.075 --> 01:25:12.438]  And we had, on Monday, we had Donald Trump meeting with the United Nations Security Council about North Korea.
[01:25:13.219 --> 01:25:14.059]  And it was very troubling.
[01:25:14.099 --> 01:25:19.943]  There was an article on the New American, in bizarre reversal, Trump seeks to empower the UN.
[01:25:20.003 --> 01:25:21.183]  I think it's very disturbing.
[01:25:22.264 --> 01:25:23.765]  We saw candidate Trump
[01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:34.427]  And actually, in the early days of his administration, saying that the UN was a globalist cabal for international bankers, that they were seeking a global government for humanity.
[01:25:34.447 --> 01:25:35.408]  And he was exactly right.
[01:25:35.428 --> 01:25:41.011]  But now he's saying the United Nations is an underperformer, but it has huge potential.
[01:25:41.112 --> 01:25:47.796]  And he told them on Monday, I see a day when there's a conflict where the United Nations, you get together, you solve the conflict.
[01:25:48.592 --> 01:25:49.393]  You see a problem with that?
[01:25:49.954 --> 01:25:50.214]  I do.
[01:25:50.634 --> 01:25:52.136]  I think it's going to start happening now.
[01:25:52.276 --> 01:25:52.817]  I can see it.
[01:25:52.897 --> 01:25:55.220]  And the United Nations will get together and solve conflicts.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.401]  It won't be two countries.
[01:25:56.421 --> 01:26:00.366]  It will be the United Nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries.
[01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:02.689]  In other words, imposing a solution.
[01:26:03.009 --> 01:26:07.495]  He said, so I see fantastic potential, fantastic things ahead for the United Nations.
[01:26:08.055 --> 01:26:20.331]  It looked like, Mr. Jasper, that Donald Trump was going to cut UN funding, and we were all hopeful about that, and it's by the fact that he put a very statist neocon as ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley.
[01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:24.396]  But now it looks like this is all turned around so they can get a war with North Korea.
[01:26:26.004 --> 01:26:41.862]  Well, it certainly is disturbing on the North Korean front and the article that you just mentioned by my colleague Alex Newman about President Trump's meeting with the UN Security Council ambassadors at the White House.
[01:26:42.603 --> 01:26:43.703]  That was on Monday.
[01:26:44.303 --> 01:26:58.746]  And Alex quotes many of the important points from that meeting, which if you want to read it in the full context, you can go to the remarks by the president at whitehouse.gov on April 24.
[01:27:00.086 --> 01:27:10.728]  And it's really very disturbing because it seems like a complete reversal of everything that he said about his anti-globalism, anti-U.N.
[01:27:15.311 --> 01:27:31.768]  In fact, he's just falling all over himself in this meeting about how important these people on the UN Security Council are, how important the United Nations itself is, how all this important work that it needs to do must go forward.
[01:27:32.508 --> 01:27:35.271]  He says there in his comments to them, though,
[01:27:36.172 --> 01:27:43.015]  And very critical about your expenditures, your budgets, you know, things have been out of control.
[01:27:43.055 --> 01:27:48.177]  But I think we can reform it, and I think we can get this back into proper perspective.
[01:27:48.197 --> 01:27:54.480]  And he says, and if you do your job right, and you solve all these problems in the world, I'm not even concerned about the budget.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:54.660]  Wow.
[01:27:56.361 --> 01:28:08.809]  It's a complete denial of the Dictators Club and the tyrannical underpinnings and bases of the United Nations, which I've written about in my book.
[01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:18.656]  I was an accredited correspondent at the United Nations for three decades and have attended most of their conferences and written about this for decades.
[01:28:19.116 --> 01:28:25.581]  And it's very clear that from the very beginning, as we've documented, the United
[01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:29.243]  The United Nations was planned to become a world government.
[01:28:29.263 --> 01:28:33.666]  It wasn't a forum for people to come together and talk and avoid war.
[01:28:34.107 --> 01:28:41.492]  In fact, it contemplates and expects war, a war waged by this world body.
[01:28:41.532 --> 01:28:49.298]  It will have world government powers, executive, legislative, judicial, and military, and police powers.
[01:28:49.538 --> 01:28:52.220]  And that is where the globalists are headed.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.543]  And to get all those military powers for a globalist government, they have to have a tax revenue.
[01:28:57.863 --> 01:28:59.844]  And so they have to create a global problem.
[01:29:00.104 --> 01:29:01.966]  And that's what all this climate stuff is about.
[01:29:01.986 --> 01:29:05.948]  And we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson later in the program from E&E Legal.
[01:29:05.968 --> 01:29:11.071]  We're going to talk about the Paris Climate Treaty, which they don't want to let go of certain factions within the White House.
[01:29:11.511 --> 01:29:13.133]  But it has economic issues.
[01:29:13.393 --> 01:29:16.456]  It is at the heart of globalism versus nationalism.
[01:29:16.876 --> 01:29:26.725]  And that's what's so disturbing about this, to see this being subordinated in the service of the neoconservatives, the warmonger wing that has been brought into the White House.
[01:29:26.746 --> 01:29:27.947]  That's what I'm so concerned about.
[01:29:29.148 --> 01:29:30.269]  Well, we're out of time.
[01:29:30.309 --> 01:29:31.050]  Thank you so much for...
[01:29:33.376 --> 01:29:34.916]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:29:35.437 --> 01:29:39.278]  We see the hand of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:29:39.318 --> 01:29:47.861]  He's brought too many of those people into his administration, and now they are starting to sing his praises in the CFR journals and on their website.
[01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:49.481]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[01:29:49.521 --> 01:29:51.642]  Thank you so much for joining us, William F. Jasper.
[01:29:52.062 --> 01:29:55.163]  You can get that information at thenewamerican.com.
[01:29:56.103 --> 01:29:58.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.417 --> 01:30:11.161]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:17.824]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:30:18.044 --> 01:30:22.206]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[01:30:22.366 --> 01:30:32.231]  ...that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[01:30:32.471 --> 01:30:35.373]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:30:35.633 --> 01:30:41.376]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:30:41.716 --> 01:30:42.196]  It works.
[01:30:42.477 --> 01:30:50.782]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:30:50.802 --> 01:31:00.329]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time.
[01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:01.169]  A total 360 win.
[01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:05.812]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:31:05.912 --> 01:31:08.212]  Listen to these headlines from just the last week.
[01:31:08.533 --> 01:31:12.034]  Four times in four days, Russian military aircraft fly off U.S.
[01:31:12.114 --> 01:31:13.734]  coast, some nuclear capable.
[01:31:14.074 --> 01:31:14.314]  U.S.
[01:31:14.334 --> 01:31:16.435]  sends nuclear snipper plane to Korea.
[01:31:16.655 --> 01:31:22.377]  China tests missile on deadly new destroyer ship near North Korea as it warns it's getting troops battle ready.
[01:31:22.697 --> 01:31:22.957]  U.S.
[01:31:23.017 --> 01:31:26.998]  preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.
[01:31:27.258 --> 01:31:28.198]  Washington, D.C.
[01:31:28.238 --> 01:31:30.699]  to hold massive coordinated terror attack drill.
[01:31:30.939 --> 01:31:33.421]  Feds prepare for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:37.205]  North Korea flexes muscle in unprecedented live fire drill.
[01:31:37.465 --> 01:31:37.865]  D.C.
[01:31:37.985 --> 01:31:41.308]  area first responders prepare for a complex terror attack.
[01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.989]  U.S.
[01:31:42.049 --> 01:31:45.572]  Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel in Persian Gulf.
[01:31:45.852 --> 01:31:48.835]  Air Force launches test missile off California coast.
[01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:50.116]  Entire U.S.
[01:31:50.156 --> 01:31:52.818]  Senate called for meeting on North Korea briefing.
[01:31:53.079 --> 01:31:57.923]  And now, NBC News is telling its audience what to do in case of a nuclear attack.
[01:31:58.123 --> 01:32:00.265]  Will this cold world war ever go hot?
[01:32:00.385 --> 01:32:02.606]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:25.242]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:32:25.302 --> 01:32:26.362]  I don't feel good.
[01:32:26.442 --> 01:32:29.943]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:32:30.183 --> 01:32:32.844]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:32:32.884 --> 01:32:38.206]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:41.087]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:32:41.648 --> 01:32:45.089]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:47.370]  So obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:47.770]  I love it.
[01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:50.531]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:51.712]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:51.752 --> 01:32:57.394]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:57.574 --> 01:32:59.255]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:32:59.515 --> 01:33:01.536]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:33:07.788 --> 01:33:08.649]  You found it.
[01:33:08.769 --> 01:33:09.891]  The tip of the sphere.
[01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:13.655]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:26.751]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:29.573]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be joined by Dr. Group here in a moment.
[01:33:29.593 --> 01:33:32.815]  There's a lot of health stories that have come out in the last couple of days.
[01:33:33.495 --> 01:33:36.937]  We had a story on InfoWars.com from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:33:37.677 --> 01:33:45.842]  talking about a recent study that showed that infants with DTP vaccine had five to ten times higher death rate.
[01:33:46.623 --> 01:33:52.286]  Perhaps that had something to do with lowering the immune system, but that was a study that was done in Africa.
[01:33:52.586 --> 01:33:52.947]  It was
[01:33:54.258 --> 01:33:55.378]  Looking for the country here.
[01:33:55.398 --> 01:34:07.322]  Not sure which country this was, but it was a study that was funded by the Danish government and as Robert Kennedy points out, Robert Kennedy Jr., he says, we can't get these studies from the American government.
[01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:10.262]  They don't want to look at the effect of vaccines.
[01:34:10.362 --> 01:34:11.823]  And yet, when you do a study,
[01:34:12.843 --> 01:34:25.828]  In a foreign country, and you see that there's a five to ten times greater mortality rate of the kids who are vaccinated with this diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine than there was with the kids who didn't get it.
[01:34:26.188 --> 01:34:28.869]  It tells you that maybe there's something going on.
[01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:32.711]  This is in Guinea in West Africa.
[01:34:32.791 --> 01:34:34.031]  This is where they did the study.
[01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:38.713]  Also, we have a story that's up today about a blood thinning drug.
[01:34:39.773 --> 01:34:44.536]  Zeralto, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, faces 18,000 lawsuits.
[01:34:44.996 --> 01:34:47.717]  But we're going to talk about things that have to do with nutrition as well.
[01:34:47.737 --> 01:34:53.840]  And before I get to Dr. Group, I just want to remind you that we've extended this sale on Caveman, our true paleo formulation.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.282]  It's now 53% off retail at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:57.302 --> 01:34:58.742]  This is for a limited amount of time.
[01:34:59.263 --> 01:35:01.644]  And again, this is something that goes back to
[01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:03.521]  I don't know.
[01:35:14.047 --> 01:35:15.088]  Do your own research.
[01:35:15.268 --> 01:35:22.390]  You can do this on the internet and find out the benefits of those types of ingredients and it's something that you can take very easily in a drink mix.
[01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:27.372]  And I've got a review here of the day about Caveman from Mojo Rising in Ohio.
[01:35:27.392 --> 01:35:29.673]  He says, I will buy this product again and again.
[01:35:29.713 --> 01:35:31.433]  He says, I use milk when I have Caveman.
[01:35:31.493 --> 01:35:32.394]  Tastes like a milkshake.
[01:35:32.834 --> 01:35:34.494]  I use this product after my workouts.
[01:35:35.014 --> 01:35:36.275]  Just ordered another two-pack.
[01:35:36.495 --> 01:35:37.195]  Great product.
[01:35:37.655 --> 01:35:38.075]  Caveman.
[01:35:40.089 --> 01:35:41.910]  My son has the same comments.
[01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:45.693]  He's using it with his workouts on a daily basis and loves it.
[01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:50.157]  So it's something that I need to get started with a daily workout.
[01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:51.898]  And then I can add the caveman to it.
[01:35:52.318 --> 01:35:54.800]  But my younger son is actually doing this.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.543]  So it's a great product.
[01:35:57.643 --> 01:35:59.744]  And also we have a flash special.
[01:36:00.205 --> 01:36:02.366]  Liver Shield is now 30% off.
[01:36:02.426 --> 01:36:06.469]  This is just a temporary flash special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:08.251]  You can get Liver Shield for 30% off.
[01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:15.979]  It supports your liver's natural function and detoxification of the liver and the gallbladder.
[01:36:16.019 --> 01:36:19.064]  You can read about that, look at the reviews at Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:19.105 --> 01:36:20.908]  LiverShield, 30% off.
[01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:22.450]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[01:36:22.931 --> 01:36:23.612]  Welcome, Dr. Group.
[01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.098]  Thanks, David.
[01:36:25.118 --> 01:36:26.138]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:36:26.238 --> 01:36:35.940]  And, you know, as far as all the stuff that's happening in the world right now, everybody, you know, there's studies coming out that everybody's under extreme amounts of stress.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.280]  Everybody is depressed.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:44.542]  And all that leads to the majority of the time is people on more pharmaceuticals, which we're trying to get away from.
[01:36:44.642 --> 01:36:51.563]  And one of the reasons I wanted to come on today is to talk about the obesity endemic and to talk about fat and what's happening.
[01:36:52.523 --> 01:37:01.691]  We've been talking and letting people know for a long time that there's two organs in the body that are really responsible for the body running efficiently, and that's the gut, which we talk so much about.
[01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:04.273]  Heal the gut, heal the brain, heal the body.
[01:37:04.853 --> 01:37:18.064]  The gut-mind connection, the immune system connection from the gut, and how important it is not only to put good foods and good beverages, water, in your system, but also to keep your gut healthy and clean on a regular basis.
[01:37:18.655 --> 01:37:32.605]  What we're finding out now though, and this is something that is not new, but we're seeing more scientific evidence come out, is the effects that all of these chemicals and toxins are having on the liver, and that's why Liver Shield is on sale today for 30% off, because
[01:37:34.426 --> 01:37:37.348]  For example, there's a couple of studies that just came out.
[01:37:37.508 --> 01:37:50.718]  One of them is that high fructose diet during pregnancy, and you look at the high fructose corn syrup, which is practically in everything these days, can actually cause the children, if the mother consumes high fructose,
[01:37:51.559 --> 01:37:52.260]  Corn syrup.
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:57.964]  During pregnancy, the children are now susceptible to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:37:58.424 --> 01:38:01.727]  This is one of the conditions that's being really, really suppressed.
[01:38:02.087 --> 01:38:09.153]  You know, a long time ago, we had a big rise and we still have a big rise in alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:38:09.733 --> 01:38:15.760]  But now we're seeing non-alcoholic fatty disease and we're seeing obesity in general as an epidemic.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:23.789]  You look at 95% of the population in the United States is overweight by 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 30 pounds.
[01:38:27.372 --> 01:38:47.171]  And they're having a hard time losing weight and with the hormone disruptions, the endocrine disrupting chemicals, the MSG, the aspartame, all the other artificial sweeteners, all the chemicals and toxins, glyphosate that's in the food supply, all of these things just alter the body and can continue with fat.
[01:38:48.283 --> 01:38:49.163]  Accumulation.
[01:38:49.324 --> 01:38:53.125]  And what happens is the liver is becoming toxic.
[01:38:53.245 --> 01:38:57.227]  And we've been evaluating liver disease and what's going on with the liver.
[01:38:57.727 --> 01:39:05.091]  The medical profession really doesn't have set guidelines or ways to determine how toxic your liver is.
[01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:07.212]  How fibrotic your liver is.
[01:39:07.332 --> 01:39:09.313]  How many stones you have in your liver.
[01:39:09.933 --> 01:39:12.014]  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[01:39:12.434 --> 01:39:13.615]  Fatty liver disease.
[01:39:13.755 --> 01:39:15.276]  And even tests show that
[01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:19.481]  Males who drink one to two ounces of alcohol a night.
[01:39:19.721 --> 01:39:21.003]  Females is even lower.
[01:39:21.103 --> 01:39:24.228]  Females who drink up to one ounce of alcohol a night.
[01:39:25.882 --> 01:39:29.685]  Have tremendous increased risk of fatty liver disease.
[01:39:29.705 --> 01:39:31.286]  So what is fatty liver disease?
[01:39:31.326 --> 01:39:34.569]  Fatty liver disease is when you have fat accumulation in your liver.
[01:39:35.029 --> 01:39:37.191]  The liver is not able to function properly.
[01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:44.977]  And my message to everybody today is the good news is your liver regenerates itself very fast.
[01:39:45.017 --> 01:39:48.019]  You get a new liver every three months.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:52.042]  The liver has 500 different functions it performs.
[01:39:52.462 --> 01:39:54.143]  It neutralizes all your toxins.
[01:39:54.503 --> 01:39:55.723]  It fights off infection.
[01:39:55.783 --> 01:39:57.184]  It protects your immune system.
[01:39:57.244 --> 01:39:58.545]  It controls blood sugar.
[01:39:58.965 --> 01:40:05.788]  It's the only organ that can regenerate itself really fast besides the skin and the intestines, which you get new cells every 24 hours.
[01:40:06.248 --> 01:40:11.971]  But when you clog the filter, because the liver filters about one and a half quarts of blood a minute,
[01:40:12.907 --> 01:40:18.829]  It removes toxins, air pollutants, pesticides, all the environmental chemicals, all the chemicals in food.
[01:40:19.649 --> 01:40:33.672]  What we're seeing is that most people's livers right now, especially over the age of 30, but we're also seeing it in children because you're seeing obesity in children, is that most people's livers are only functioning 40 to 50 percent.
[01:40:34.112 --> 01:40:39.474]  In order for you to be healthy, your liver has to be above the 80 percent functionality.
[01:40:40.214 --> 01:40:52.282]  So, it's super important to give all the listeners the information of how important it is to continue cleansing your liver and to do liver cleanses on a regular basis.
[01:40:52.742 --> 01:40:55.504]  Ultimately, it's about addressing the root cause of the problem.
[01:40:55.564 --> 01:41:05.591]  You know, the root cause of the problem is what we're exposed to in our environment every single day, and that comes from the air we breathe, and it comes from the food we eat, and it comes from the beverages that we drink.
[01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:34.662]  But, you know, it's hard to get away from those things, and if you can't eat organic all the time, and you can't drink water all the time, that next best thing, regardless, is to keep your liver healthy, and, you know, to fight the globalists, to look at what the attack is that we're under, and how important it actually is to clean and keep your liver healthy and supportive, because that is your main system.
[01:41:35.402 --> 01:41:41.426]  You know, it's kind of interesting, Dr. Group, there was a story yesterday from the Daily Mail talking about something like yogurt.
[01:41:41.446 --> 01:41:43.948]  Many people look at it and say, hey, that's going to be really great for me.
[01:41:43.988 --> 01:41:52.493]  And yet, if you look at what the manufactured yogurt has, they said that there's more sugar in your yogurt than in many desserts.
[01:41:52.554 --> 01:41:55.596]  They say it's merely dessert in disguise in many cases.
[01:41:56.176 --> 01:42:03.421]  And this goes back, they said nearly half of 200 yogurts analyzed had more than three teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams.
[01:42:03.441 --> 01:42:05.282]  This is a big part of a shell's schooling.
[01:42:05.282 --> 01:42:05.982]  That's right.
[01:42:35.762 --> 01:42:41.126]  Most of the food supply out there that's not certified organic has hidden ingredients in it.
[01:42:41.826 --> 01:42:48.091]  Natural flavors, for example, sounds really, really good, but it's actually another hidden name for MSG.
[01:42:49.612 --> 01:42:53.915]  All of, you know, when you look at, let's say yogurt, for example, like you said,
[01:42:54.395 --> 01:42:55.575]  Well, you have to look at everything.
[01:42:55.655 --> 01:42:57.756]  First of all, they're culturing dairy.
[01:42:57.916 --> 01:43:00.036]  Dairy is an allergen in most people.
[01:43:00.176 --> 01:43:02.116]  It causes an inflammatory reaction.
[01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.517]  It causes an immune response.
[01:43:04.157 --> 01:43:07.977]  Then you look at, what was that cow fed?
[01:43:08.077 --> 01:43:12.558]  And most likely, 90% of the cows out there felt genetically modified grains.
[01:43:13.018 --> 01:43:16.319]  So now you have genetically modified particles that are probably in there.
[01:43:16.339 --> 01:43:17.979]  The cows are heavily vaccinated.
[01:43:18.019 --> 01:43:20.260]  The cows are heavily dosed on antibiotics.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.160]  So you have drug residue in there as well.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.781]  And then you have bovine growth hormone in there.
[01:43:24.861 --> 01:43:26.843]  So it's not just what's on the label.
[01:43:27.263 --> 01:43:41.572]  If you were to analyze most of the yogurts, and not only yogurts, most of the boxed, canned, processed, microwaved foods out there, you would have a whole slew of chemical pesticide residue, genetically modified ingredients.
[01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:43.132]  You would have hormones in there.
[01:43:43.172 --> 01:43:45.474]  You would have endocrine disrupting chemicals in there.
[01:43:45.874 --> 01:43:48.015]  You would have all kinds of things in there.
[01:43:48.035 --> 01:43:50.037]  And that's really what the concern is.
[01:43:50.777 --> 01:43:57.244]  Yes, organic is better always, and growing your own food would even be better than that.
[01:43:57.424 --> 01:43:59.826]  Yeah, you know, you're talking about the GMO content.
[01:43:59.886 --> 01:44:02.249]  Again, that was one of the other things that came up with yogurt.
[01:44:02.649 --> 01:44:07.754]  I've been looking into this since Chobani decided they would sue us for talking about their crony capitalism.
[01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.056]  And they had a back and forth with
[01:44:11.057 --> 01:44:20.340]  Hamdi Ulukaya about the fact that the dairy products that they use came from cows that were fed GMO food, corn and other things.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:25.762]  And they said, well, we just don't think that it's worth it to make the product more expensive.
[01:44:25.802 --> 01:44:29.503]  We want a lot of people to be able to have our product because they want big sales.
[01:44:29.923 --> 01:44:30.923]  So we're going to do that.
[01:44:30.983 --> 01:44:33.724]  But what happens is that the government comes in with them.
[01:44:34.464 --> 01:44:41.308]  And says that it's non-GMO because it's just the food that the dairy cattle are eating that's GMO.
[01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:45.831]  But the dairy is then not considered to be not labeled as GMO.
[01:44:45.851 --> 01:44:49.513]  So they cooperate with them in that deception on the labeling.
[01:44:51.021 --> 01:45:08.555]  Yeah, it's just really sad and that's why we're here to try to educate everybody and all the listeners and info warriors out there that know the truth and that we continue to report the truth and report the studies that the mainstream media is not going to report because it's all about getting the truth and getting the right answers.
[01:45:08.955 --> 01:45:14.359]  Another study that's interesting that I wanted to mention today was that not only does alcohol damage the liver,
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:32.650]  But now, they've found that once, you know, people that consume alcohol on a regular basis, it actually damages the gut and allows gut bacteria to migrate to the liver, promoting alcohol-induced liver disease and you can actually get bad bacteria in your liver as well.
[01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:37.853]  So, that's another study I wanted to talk about today and just, you know, let everybody know.
[01:45:37.934 --> 01:45:43.417]  I know we're going to be taking some calls because everybody loves to have their health questions answered.
[01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:49.863]  But liver disease, the sad thing about it is most people don't even know they have it until it's too late.
[01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:56.870]  I would say probably the general population, especially in the United States, has a malfunctioning liver.
[01:45:57.290 --> 01:46:03.576]  And once you heal the gut, once you heal the liver, once you're on good supplementation, like iodine,
[01:46:04.597 --> 01:46:08.883]  Hang on, Dr. Group, let me give out the phone number so we can get some people to call in with their questions.
[01:46:08.903 --> 01:46:09.684]  You want to take questions?
[01:46:09.724 --> 01:46:10.365]  That number is 800-259-9231.
[01:46:10.385 --> 01:46:12.788]  800-259-9231 if you want to call in with a health question to Dr. Group.
[01:46:12.808 --> 01:46:13.108]  Go ahead.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.683]  Now, and another thing, you know, when you talk about fat, there's so many people saying, well, what do I do about it?
[01:46:23.743 --> 01:46:25.765]  How do I get rid of all the fat in my liver?
[01:46:25.805 --> 01:46:27.466]  How do I get rid of the fat in my body?
[01:46:28.026 --> 01:46:42.017]  I've now spent about the last 12 months doing in-depth research on fasting, because if you look at years and years ago, in all biblical texts, in all ancient texts, the only thing they had was really fasting, and when people got sick,
[01:46:42.617 --> 01:46:50.400]  They would go to the local spring with the waterfall with the high oxygen in the water and they would soak in that and all they would do is drink water.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:47:07.305]  So if you think about the self-healing mechanism that we're all born with and how powerful it is, you know, our self-healing mechanism is being suppressed because we're taking in all of these chemicals and all these toxins on a daily basis and we're not able to get rid of these toxins on a daily basis.
[01:47:07.865 --> 01:47:12.488]  And I'm going to be publishing my next book on the benefits of fasting and what's going on with fasting.
[01:47:12.548 --> 01:47:24.755]  It's kind of taking hold right now with the ketogenic diet and being able for the body to go back in time and literally melt fat and attack fat in your system.
[01:47:25.055 --> 01:47:27.937]  There was an interesting study that just came out from USC.
[01:47:29.938 --> 01:47:47.772]  They had mice do 72-hour water fasts, which all they did was drink water for 72 hours, and it flipped a regenerative switch, which prompted stem cells to create new white blood cells, essentially regenerating the entire immune system.
[01:47:48.092 --> 01:47:48.232]  Wow.
[01:47:48.252 --> 01:47:50.854]  It's amazing the doctors from the late 1800s to the 1940s that were doing fasting,
[01:47:53.936 --> 01:47:57.779]  The benefits and the regeneration of the body that was taking place.
[01:47:57.799 --> 01:48:04.023]  So that's something that people should look into also if they're looking to lose a lot of weight or to detoxify themselves.
[01:48:04.043 --> 01:48:07.425]  And that's why we're such a big proponent of detoxification.
[01:48:07.465 --> 01:48:08.446]  Detoxification.
[01:48:08.966 --> 01:48:14.790]  Not putting and exposing yourself to the chemicals and toxins, but getting them out of your body as fast as you can.
[01:48:14.810 --> 01:48:15.710]  That's amazing.
[01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:17.812]  Let's go to one of our phone calls here.
[01:48:17.912 --> 01:48:18.972]  Thomas in Texas.
[01:48:19.013 --> 01:48:19.593]  Go ahead, Thomas.
[01:48:21.983 --> 01:48:23.905]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:27.147]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:48:27.428 --> 01:48:33.513]  I did the liver cleanse the first time it came out right after y'all started and it really helped a lot.
[01:48:33.533 --> 01:48:34.133]  I felt better.
[01:48:34.153 --> 01:48:34.834]  I actually lost
[01:48:35.578 --> 01:48:37.579]  Nine pounds in about six days.
[01:48:38.059 --> 01:48:41.180]  The liver cleanse, I think, is six days, and after that, I lost nine pounds.
[01:48:42.421 --> 01:48:48.743]  I'm looking to do it again, and my question is, at the end, you take six ounces of olive oil.
[01:48:48.843 --> 01:48:52.385]  Can I substitute that with coconut oil, or would you say no to that?
[01:48:53.385 --> 01:48:57.850]  I would say no to that just because there hasn't been a lot of research done on that.
[01:48:57.950 --> 01:49:03.796]  It's just the way that the olive oil is, it really causes a purging of the gallbladder and the liver.
[01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:07.701]  And that's what's really been used for over a hundred years.
[01:49:07.901 --> 01:49:13.947]  Actually, they found olive oil and that olive oil was being used to cleanse the liver, you know, probably 500 years ago.
[01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:18.111]  So I would continue with that.
[01:49:18.971 --> 01:49:23.894]  Maybe it would have some sort of effect, but it hasn't been used.
[01:49:24.515 --> 01:49:34.981]  We've had people do over 500,000 liver cleanses, probably more than that, through InfoWars Life and through Global Healing Center, and we've modified those over a long period of time.
[01:49:36.517 --> 01:49:47.929]  Even if you're not going to do the full liver cleanse, which I think everybody should do at least three times a year, because what we found is one liver cleanse really only cleanses the liver about 15%.
[01:49:48.930 --> 01:49:56.757]  So let's say that you're having symptoms, you're sluggish, you're out of energy, you want to clean your liver, and also you mentioned a good point there.
[01:49:57.648 --> 01:50:03.371]  When your body starts storing fat, it's your liver that's congested with weight gain.
[01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:09.873]  Most people never address the liver when you talk about losing weight, but the liver is what breaks down and processes your fat stores.
[01:50:10.294 --> 01:50:15.336]  So, by doing liver cleansing, you actually accelerate weight loss in the body.
[01:50:15.856 --> 01:50:22.001]  So good question, but that's why I personally take the liver shield just by itself.
[01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:23.763]  I do three to four liver cleanses.
[01:50:23.863 --> 01:50:25.644]  I'm in the middle of a four-day water fast.
[01:50:25.664 --> 01:50:27.866]  As a matter of fact, today is day four for me.
[01:50:27.906 --> 01:50:30.288]  I've had nothing but water for four days.
[01:50:31.369 --> 01:50:38.331]  And I'm charting my progress and seeing what happens because obviously I don't want to tell people to do stuff if I haven't done it myself.
[01:50:38.831 --> 01:50:42.472]  But I take the liver shield on a regular basis just as maintenance.
[01:50:42.512 --> 01:50:47.793]  I mean just a couple dropper fulls a couple times a week and I make a tea with it actually.
[01:50:47.813 --> 01:50:54.315]  I use a lot of the supplements and make tea with them and they're great to just mix in and put in a teacup and then put hot water in.
[01:50:55.555 --> 01:50:56.498]  We've got to take a quick break.
[01:50:56.518 --> 01:50:57.520]  We're going to be right back.
[01:50:57.581 --> 01:51:01.231]  And also, I remind you, we have 30% off Livershield at www.infowarslife.com.
[01:51:01.271 --> 01:51:01.612]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.632 --> 01:51:02.695]  We'll be right back with more of your...
[01:51:06.098 --> 01:51:07.439]  This is where you get breaking news.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.763]  McMaster has a plan to send in ground troops to Syria.
[01:51:11.123 --> 01:51:15.187]  That story actually broke here on InfoWars four or five days ago.
[01:51:15.207 --> 01:51:16.188]  Bloomberg is covering it.
[01:51:16.248 --> 01:51:24.697]  So essentially whatever you're reading in the news today or tomorrow, this is all going to be on InfoWars five, ten, fifteen days before it ever reaches the mainstream.
[01:51:24.737 --> 01:51:27.139]  That is how good the sourcing is here.
[01:51:27.179 --> 01:51:28.100]  This is for real news.
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:36.909]  That is why not only are they trying to divide the base against Trump, they are now slandering Alex and me and other patriots, calling us Russian agents.
[01:51:37.049 --> 01:51:44.337]  They realize that this is the only place for real news and now they're trying to attack and lie about us and claiming that we're Russian agents and all that.
[01:51:44.517 --> 01:51:46.859]  We don't want to sit here and brag and say, we're right, we're right, we're right.
[01:51:46.919 --> 01:51:48.420]  They keep saying, we're lying, we're lying, we're lying.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:53.443]  Because weeks ago, and then last week, we said, no, McMaster wants the troops.
[01:51:53.483 --> 01:51:55.225]  That's my source from the White House.
[01:51:55.265 --> 01:51:56.105]  Then you have your source.
[01:51:56.485 --> 01:51:57.846]  He wants 150,000 on the ground.
[01:51:58.107 --> 01:52:02.290]  Now Bloomberg comes out today and says, Trump has told Bloomberg, I don't want a war.
[01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:10.876]  But it turns out the aides were doing exactly what we said, trying to jockey and get them in place and move artillery in that wasn't for ISIS, but was for Assad.
[01:52:11.696 --> 01:52:12.176]  Exactly.
[01:52:12.216 --> 01:52:15.218]  So Bloomberg is now reporting what we covered a week ago.
[01:52:15.718 --> 01:52:21.722]  And one thing that frustrates me a little bit is the idea that we need Bloomberg to validate our reporting.
[01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:22.863]  Because this is real news.
[01:52:22.903 --> 01:52:25.704]  We don't make stuff up like ABC does, like Bloomberg does.
[01:52:26.044 --> 01:52:26.905]  They fabricate things.
[01:52:26.945 --> 01:52:29.306]  I put a transcript out of what the president said on Monday.
[01:52:29.386 --> 01:52:32.068]  It's what the president said, and I'm not going to say where it came from.
[01:52:32.248 --> 01:52:34.149]  Everybody knows we have contact with the President.
[01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:36.871]  The media is attacking that, saying, oh look, Alex is making this up.
[01:52:37.132 --> 01:52:37.332]  What?
[01:52:37.472 --> 01:52:37.972]  I said it?
[01:52:38.232 --> 01:52:40.954]  It came out three days later, out of his mouth, the exact same words.
[01:52:41.235 --> 01:52:49.080]  And they are so desperate for war now that they're trying to claim that us, by trying to oppose a ground war in Syria, trying to save American lives.
[01:52:49.361 --> 01:52:57.367]  I mean, Alex, when I did that live stream, 11 hours, so many mothers called in and said, my son has PTSD, this is so sad.
[01:52:57.807 --> 01:52:58.828]  You know, it was heartbreaking.
[01:52:58.868 --> 01:53:01.169]  I could hardly even stay on the line.
[01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.810]  It was so sad.
[01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:04.213]  Moms do not want to do another war.
[01:53:04.253 --> 01:53:06.175]  They do not want the McMaster plan to go through.
[01:53:06.535 --> 01:53:06.976]  Exactly.
[01:53:07.036 --> 01:53:08.157]  And again, we love our military.
[01:53:08.177 --> 01:53:09.159]  We criticize the wars.
[01:53:09.259 --> 01:53:12.543]  It's because it's not for our national sovereignty.
[01:53:12.563 --> 01:53:13.404]  It's not for our interests.
[01:53:13.484 --> 01:53:16.728]  This is one of the most elite publications published by the Rothschilds.
[01:53:16.788 --> 01:53:17.749]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[01:53:18.866 --> 01:53:23.213]  And they literally say, we're dupe idiots, and Assad tells us what to say.
[01:53:23.473 --> 01:53:26.758]  So now it's not just we're dupes of Putin, now it's Assad.
[01:53:26.798 --> 01:53:27.038]  No, no, no.
[01:53:27.299 --> 01:53:29.342]  We said first on Wednesday, false flag.
[01:53:29.662 --> 01:53:31.405]  We have the articles, the history, all of it.
[01:53:31.445 --> 01:53:32.086]  You did as well.
[01:53:32.587 --> 01:53:34.289]  Then, over the next week and a half,
[01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:38.733]  Everybody else from Putin to Ron Paul, everybody else came out and said it was a false flag.
[01:53:38.753 --> 01:53:40.454]  Again, we're the progenitors.
[01:53:40.774 --> 01:53:48.119]  We're not here grabbing it, you know, from Assad how a pair of self-publicists wound up as apologists for Assad.
[01:53:48.379 --> 01:53:50.060]  We're not apologizing for Assad.
[01:53:50.241 --> 01:53:52.282]  He didn't start the Civil War six years ago.
[01:53:52.522 --> 01:53:53.683]  He's never done anything to us.
[01:53:53.903 --> 01:53:54.824]  I mean, this was so crazy.
[01:53:54.924 --> 01:54:00.888]  Everything we say has just docked because we're going off what's already there and the sources we have.
[01:54:13.737 --> 01:54:15.098]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.118 --> 01:54:20.182]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Group and he's actually taking your calls and questions.
[01:54:20.222 --> 01:54:26.587]  I want to get to these right away because we've got one more section with you, then at the top of the hour we'll have another section, another segment.
[01:54:26.727 --> 01:54:28.388]  Let's go to Don in Seattle.
[01:54:28.468 --> 01:54:29.049]  Don, go ahead.
[01:54:31.249 --> 01:54:32.491]  Yeah, I got a question.
[01:54:32.551 --> 01:54:37.897]  I've been having problems and actually the tongue getting coated with yellow.
[01:54:38.057 --> 01:54:41.842]  I've got the super blue itself.
[01:54:41.962 --> 01:54:46.828]  I can actually go almost the whole day now without getting a tongue coating.
[01:54:47.048 --> 01:54:48.350]  And I'm just wondering what
[01:54:49.352 --> 01:54:54.558]  You know, uh, might cause that or, uh, I've got a little bit of liver shield.
[01:54:54.638 --> 01:54:55.919]  I've been doing it in the morning.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:57.281]  And it has helped.
[01:54:57.421 --> 01:54:58.402]  It has actually helped.
[01:54:58.963 --> 01:55:00.885]  And the super blue has definitely helped.
[01:55:00.985 --> 01:55:02.467]  It's helped keep my mouth fresh.
[01:55:03.128 --> 01:55:05.050]  But, uh, it's got me a little concerned.
[01:55:08.009 --> 01:55:09.891]  I don't know what could be causing that.
[01:55:09.911 --> 01:55:11.533]  It could be a lot of different things.
[01:55:11.593 --> 01:55:12.915]  I'm not actually sure.
[01:55:13.756 --> 01:55:20.283]  Usually when you get a coating on the tongue, it's white and then other different compounds can stain that.
[01:55:20.944 --> 01:55:24.928]  And that could be because of a candida or a yeast.
[01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:26.690]  Overgrowth in the body.
[01:55:26.730 --> 01:55:31.675]  I would have to really get more in depth about your diet and what you're doing with that.
[01:55:31.755 --> 01:55:34.938]  Although the super blue does have iodine in there as well.
[01:55:35.058 --> 01:55:37.760]  So that also might be a cause.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:44.046]  So you might want to just stop doing that maybe for a few days and just see if it turns white.
[01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:45.787]  And if it turns white, then you might want to
[01:55:46.488 --> 01:55:49.109]  You know, look at what you're doing in your diet.
[01:55:49.209 --> 01:56:06.576]  I don't know if you're consuming a lot of excess sugar, alcohol, stuff like that, but you might need to go ahead and do a harmful organism cleanse and maybe purge yourself of, you know, yeast and fungus and mold or something like that, which is, you know, a huge problem these days that people are also dealing with.
[01:56:06.596 --> 01:56:12.179]  And that's why we just recently launched the Myco ZX on InfoWars.
[01:56:12.259 --> 01:56:14.940]  It's sold out right now, but, you know, it's, it's,
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:31.876]  Cleaning your body and detoxifying your body from everything and you might also want to look at doing, you know, your gut health as well and getting your gut, you know, fixed up, cleansing it with the oxy powder, using the good probiotic, the biome defense, and also maybe doing a liver cleanse as well.
[01:56:31.896 --> 01:56:34.819]  Alright, let's go to Kyle in Michigan.
[01:56:34.859 --> 01:56:36.361]  Kyle, go ahead with your question for Dr. Group.
[01:56:37.868 --> 01:56:40.469]  First off, I'd like to thank you guys for putting out Brain Force.
[01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:43.331]  It's helped me a lot with my PTSD and anxiety.
[01:56:43.391 --> 01:56:45.752]  It's just given a lot of clarity in my mind.
[01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:47.313]  But I've got two questions for you.
[01:56:47.913 --> 01:56:54.576]  The first one is, how do heirloom seeds help in creating a homegrown diet compared to normal store-bought seeds?
[01:56:55.176 --> 01:56:57.617]  And how do energy drinks affect our gut?
[01:56:57.938 --> 01:57:02.760]  And is InfoWars ever thinking of creating an energy drink that we could use to fuel our body and mind?
[01:57:04.562 --> 01:57:20.568]  So energy drinks are, there's so many different kinds out there and there's so many different ingredients and you really have to, they're all, there's even organic energy drinks, but you have to go back to the basics and say, what does the body want on a daily basis?
[01:57:20.768 --> 01:57:23.409]  What does the body need on a daily basis?
[01:57:24.269 --> 01:57:25.990]  The body needs water, okay?
[01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:27.010]  That's just the way it is.
[01:57:27.070 --> 01:57:28.691]  We're 80 to 90% water.
[01:57:28.811 --> 01:57:33.712]  Every living substance, the earth itself, everything that's alive, plants, is 80% water.
[01:57:33.773 --> 01:57:35.893]  Without water, we shut down.
[01:57:35.953 --> 01:57:42.936]  And part of the whole situation we're dealing with now worldwide is the poisoning of the water.
[01:57:43.336 --> 01:57:50.779]  If you look at all the chemicals and all of the toxins that are being sprayed on us and all the population control and everything that's going on,
[01:57:51.619 --> 01:58:00.341]  It's all contaminating the water because they know if they contaminate the water, then everything will die or everything will be sick.
[01:58:00.921 --> 01:58:07.602]  So even the stuff, the chemtrails, everything they're spraying in the air, the air itself actually is composed of water if you think about it.
[01:58:08.302 --> 01:58:12.363]  So energy drinks, I would say there is no such thing as a good energy drink.
[01:58:12.463 --> 01:58:14.664]  Of course, anything in moderation, okay?
[01:58:14.684 --> 01:58:15.464]  I've always said
[01:58:16.044 --> 01:58:27.426]  You know, the 90-10 rule or the 95-5 rule, you eat healthy 95% of the time and then you're always going to be in a situation where you're going to go eat at a restaurant or you're going to have an energy drink or you're going to have some wine or whatever.
[01:58:28.006 --> 01:58:30.367]  The body is real adaptive.
[01:58:30.587 --> 01:58:33.487]  That won't hurt you if you use the 90-10 or the 95-5 rule.
[01:58:33.647 --> 01:58:36.128]  All right, we've got to take a break here.
[01:58:36.148 --> 01:58:36.828]  Thank you, Kyle.
[01:58:36.868 --> 01:58:41.209]  We're going to be right back after the top of the hour with Dr. Groot taking more of your calls and questions.
[01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.609]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:47.671]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:59.577 --> 01:58:59.917]  Great!
[01:59:00.017 --> 01:59:00.998]  Hey, thank you so much.

[01:59:19.975 --> 01:59:23.318]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:59:23.458 --> 01:59:24.519]  That's really incredible.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.762]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:59:27.783 --> 01:59:29.104]  Like, I haven't fell asleep.
[01:59:29.144 --> 01:59:30.725]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:59:30.805 --> 01:59:31.966]  And I love you guys.
[01:59:32.047 --> 01:59:33.468]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[01:59:41.075 --> 01:59:41.876]  You will love it.
[01:59:42.116 --> 01:59:43.938]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[02:00:24.858 --> 02:00:27.000]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:38.286 --> 02:00:39.567]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:39.587 --> 02:00:41.569]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Group.
[02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:45.131]  Of course, you can find him at GlobalHealingCenter.com.
[02:00:45.631 --> 02:00:48.934]  We're taking your calls and questions, comments for Dr. Group.
[02:00:49.314 --> 02:00:51.236]  And let's go to, we've got several people.
[02:00:51.256 --> 02:00:53.057]  We'll try to get through as many as we can in this segment.
[02:00:53.617 --> 02:00:57.120]  We have Craig Richardson with E&E Legal coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.002]  We've got Don, Jeff, Dean, James, and Jeff.
[02:01:00.022 --> 02:01:01.443]  We'll try to get through as many as we can now.
[02:01:01.483 --> 02:01:03.224]  Let's go to Don in Ohio.
[02:01:03.264 --> 02:01:03.825]  Don, go ahead.
[02:01:06.704 --> 02:01:06.844]  Yeah.
[02:01:06.884 --> 02:01:07.885]  Hi, Dr. Group.
[02:01:07.965 --> 02:01:14.009]  First, I wanted to thank you for all the great products, and I know it's a lot of work and your service and everything.
[02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:16.831]  I got two quick questions for you.
[02:01:17.472 --> 02:01:22.035]  One is I was diagnosed with fatty liver a couple years ago.
[02:01:23.015 --> 02:01:32.042]  I did a liver cleanse, and I've been taking the liver shield, and I understood from my doctor and what you just said that the liver does regenerate.
[02:01:32.582 --> 02:01:33.603]  I was wondering if you could
[02:01:34.508 --> 02:01:36.028]  Kind of give me an idea.
[02:01:36.048 --> 02:01:41.310]  Will it regenerate and what would be the best course of action for that?
[02:01:43.811 --> 02:01:47.272]  Yeah, so, okay, that was your first question.
[02:01:47.912 --> 02:02:01.376]  The good news is that you're actually doing something about it and I wish that more and more people would understand that health and healing health conditions does not have to be that hard.
[02:02:02.676 --> 02:02:15.282]  I tell people that came to see me that were completely distraught with symptoms, what if I told you it was going to take another 40 years to heal what it took 40 years for you to get?
[02:02:15.803 --> 02:02:19.384]  And the good news is it doesn't really because the body wants to heal itself.
[02:02:19.925 --> 02:02:21.465]  Everybody's different though, Don.
[02:02:21.765 --> 02:02:26.488]  I can't really say how long it's going to take you to regenerate your liver.
[02:02:27.568 --> 02:02:39.576]  I would say that anybody who's been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis of the liver, any type of liver condition, that means their liver is only working at around 20%.
[02:02:40.797 --> 02:02:47.782]  So if each liver cleanse boosts the liver 15%, one liver cleanse is only going to take you to 35%.
[02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:50.103]  If you do another liver cleanse, that's going to take you to 50%.
[02:02:50.324 --> 02:02:53.586]  Then another liver cleanse is going to take you to 65%.
[02:02:53.926 --> 02:02:56.828]  So you would have to do multiple, multiple liver cleanses.
[02:02:57.388 --> 02:03:04.054]  We've had people with serious, serious conditions that have done just multiple, just kept doing liver cleanses.
[02:03:04.094 --> 02:03:12.540]  They do one which takes five days, take a few days off, do another one, and all of their symptoms have gone away just by healing the gut and just by healing the liver.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.941]  All right.
[02:03:13.981 --> 02:03:14.822]  Thank you, Don.
[02:03:14.842 --> 02:03:16.503]  Let's go to Jeff in California.
[02:03:16.523 --> 02:03:17.704]  Jeff, your question for Dr. Group.
[02:03:18.925 --> 02:03:20.006]  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
[02:03:20.727 --> 02:03:21.327]  I have a question.
[02:03:21.347 --> 02:03:23.609]  My 15-year-old son was never breastfed.
[02:03:23.649 --> 02:03:24.570]  He's got a bit of a gut.
[02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:31.431]  And we eat healthy, we use the products, amazing products, by the way, we purify our water, water filter.
[02:03:32.212 --> 02:03:41.715]  And is there a connection between kids that haven't been breastfed and, you know, problems with the gut, the liver, and so on?
[02:03:41.935 --> 02:03:43.696]  And what can I do about that?
[02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:50.453]  Well, the first thing that I would recommend is there is a connection, actually.
[02:03:50.513 --> 02:03:53.234]  It depends on if he wasn't breastfed.
[02:03:53.374 --> 02:03:56.255]  It depends on what type of food he was fed.
[02:03:56.775 --> 02:04:11.241]  It also actually goes back to even before the conception, on how healthy you and your wife were before you conceived, because your sperm is going to hold the genetic code and her egg and everything, depending on how toxic those were.
[02:04:11.801 --> 02:04:14.442]  But, you know, there's nothing you can do about that.
[02:04:14.642 --> 02:04:18.284]  You know, what you want to focus on now is what you can do to repair the situation.
[02:04:18.785 --> 02:04:24.068]  So, what I would recommend since he is 15 is going through an intestinal cleanse.
[02:04:24.088 --> 02:04:25.449]  I don't know if you've done that already.
[02:04:25.469 --> 02:04:26.790]  Maybe another liver cleanse.
[02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:29.911]  Cleansing the body of the harmful organisms.
[02:04:29.952 --> 02:04:36.856]  You know, doing a harmful organism cleanse because a lot of times with childhood obesity or just that weight that's hard to come off.
[02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:43.161]  Can be due to an underlying fungus or a mold or some sort of an organism which is in the body.
[02:04:43.241 --> 02:04:46.543]  So we, I've seen that happen and you need to flush those out of the system.
[02:04:46.563 --> 02:04:48.285]  Alright, that's all the time we've got.
[02:04:48.345 --> 02:04:50.206]  Sorry to Dean, James and Jeff.
[02:04:50.226 --> 02:04:52.448]  Sorry we couldn't get to you, but that's all the time we have with Dr. Group.
[02:04:52.508 --> 02:04:57.031]  We have Craig Richardson, President of Energy and Environment coming up in the next segment.
[02:04:57.832 --> 02:04:58.392]  Dr. Group.
[02:04:58.552 --> 02:05:00.094]  GlobalHealingCenter.com.
[02:05:00.234 --> 02:05:00.514]  Thank you.
[02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:13.099]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[02:05:13.499 --> 02:05:23.003]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts.
[02:05:23.323 --> 02:05:28.086]  And gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government.
[02:05:28.286 --> 02:05:32.528]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed.
[02:05:32.788 --> 02:05:37.150]  And all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:40.732]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep?
[02:05:40.892 --> 02:05:43.674]  It's because that money is being held by the federal government.
[02:05:43.954 --> 02:05:44.714]  Don't believe me?
[02:05:45.014 --> 02:05:48.156]  Just read the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby.
[02:05:48.436 --> 02:05:57.124]  She was a whistleblower from the Department of Education in the 1980s, and her tome describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons.
[02:05:57.444 --> 02:06:00.687]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:03.513 --> 02:06:07.355]  I want to tell you about some of the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:07.395 --> 02:06:09.257]  We are under constant attack.
[02:06:09.737 --> 02:06:11.938]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[02:06:12.138 --> 02:06:15.040]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:29.409]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[02:06:30.089 --> 02:06:31.710]  They can't get to us that way.
[02:06:32.090 --> 02:06:34.911]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:35.931]  They don't have that power.
[02:06:36.391 --> 02:06:38.912]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[02:06:39.272 --> 02:06:41.673]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:06:42.113 --> 02:06:44.954]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:44.974 --> 02:06:46.615]  This is by listener request.
[02:06:46.855 --> 02:06:52.117]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:52.697]  Again,
[02:06:53.457 --> 02:06:59.199]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[02:06:59.599 --> 02:07:03.901]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[02:07:04.501 --> 02:07:08.342]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[02:07:10.383 --> 02:07:13.106]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[02:07:13.126 --> 02:07:31.526]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[02:07:31.866 --> 02:07:34.687]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[02:07:34.727 --> 02:07:36.749]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:39.110]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:51.176]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[02:07:51.196 --> 02:07:54.297]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:08.138 --> 02:08:14.729]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:15.209 --> 02:08:17.753]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:08:20.731 --> 02:08:22.112]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:22.192 --> 02:08:24.854]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to talk to Craig Richardson.
[02:08:24.894 --> 02:08:31.038]  He's the president of E&E Legal, and the two E's there stand for energy and environment.
[02:08:31.098 --> 02:08:41.806]  They look at ways that we can deregulate energy because, you know, that is something that not only affects our quality of life, but it also affects our life expectancy.
[02:08:42.486 --> 02:08:48.510]  Energy and cheap access to that is something that is fundamental to our freedom, to our economy.
[02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:52.092]  Craig has had more than 25 years of experience as a professional.
[02:08:52.492 --> 02:08:58.856]  He's been involved in numerous campaigns and other issues that are anti-tax and deregulation initiatives.
[02:08:59.337 --> 02:09:00.297]  We've talked before.
[02:09:00.357 --> 02:09:03.319]  We're both very happy with the person that
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:12.264]  President Trump has put in at the EPA, Scott Pruitt, he's somebody who had a long history of fighting regulatory overreach from the EPA.
[02:09:12.784 --> 02:09:19.128]  But I want to talk to you today, Craig, about the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:09:20.433 --> 02:09:21.994]  And our involvement with that.
[02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:24.534]  We've seen that both Trump has said he wants to get out of that.
[02:09:24.994 --> 02:09:28.075]  We've seen Scott Pruitt, his EPA chief, say he wants to get out of it.
[02:09:28.135 --> 02:09:36.818]  But there is a push with Ivanka, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to ride the fence on this.
[02:09:36.858 --> 02:09:43.200]  To say, alright, we're going to do some changes at EPA, but we're going to not say anything at all about the Paris Treaty.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:50.728]  As I'm looking at this, it's kind of like watching an old movie being replayed, you know, Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart.
[02:09:50.748 --> 02:09:55.053]  You know, we've got a couple of people there in the White House who are saying, we'll always have Paris.
[02:09:55.113 --> 02:10:00.679]  Maybe we always will have the Paris Treaty and we never can get rid of it, but, because they're certainly trying to Bogart it there.
[02:10:03.102 --> 02:10:05.344]  Tell us why this is important.
[02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:08.548]  What does it mean for the US that we're involved in this?
[02:10:08.648 --> 02:10:11.531]  Because we did not have the Senate ratify this treaty.
[02:10:11.932 --> 02:10:13.053]  We had Obama sign it.
[02:10:13.113 --> 02:10:16.797]  We had Secretary of State at the time, John Kerry, sign it.
[02:10:16.897 --> 02:10:18.919]  What does it mean for us moving forward?
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.623]  Well, first of all, I appreciate you having me here on the show.
[02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:28.239]  You know, I actually am a huge Humphrey Bogart fan, and that's one of my favorite movies of all time.
[02:10:28.299 --> 02:10:31.941]  And, you know, you also remember in that line, you know, round up all the usual suspects.
[02:10:32.082 --> 02:10:32.262]  Yeah.
[02:10:33.082 --> 02:10:41.988]  And I think sadly, you know, I was at a meeting the other day with some right of center energy and environment groups called Cooler Heads Coalition.
[02:10:42.208 --> 02:10:46.451]  And, you know, we were sort of shaking our heads saying, I thought our side had won the election.
[02:10:47.808 --> 02:10:50.309]  So, you know, this is a major frustration.
[02:10:51.409 --> 02:10:55.690]  We have factions that have formed within the White House itself.
[02:10:55.710 --> 02:10:58.631]  You identified a few of them as his daughter and his son-in-law to start with.
[02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:06.894]  But you have Rex Tillerson, who was an ExxonMobil CEO, who also ExxonMobil had some support for carbon tax back in the day.
[02:11:06.914 --> 02:11:14.876]  I think the bottom line, what you have to realize is what we're dealing with, which, you know, we all know, particularly you who covered the issues you do,
[02:11:15.716 --> 02:11:25.981]  Is that this is a major international effort and push by those global elitists and the governments that they prop up and support and corporations behind them.
[02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:33.104]  The statistic that stands out in my mind most is that the climate change industry and it is an industry.
[02:11:33.684 --> 02:11:33.945]  Yeah.
[02:11:50.488 --> 02:11:54.894]  Plastered all over Paris when we arrived by the environmentalists, which we felt welcomed.
[02:11:55.855 --> 02:12:05.546]  But when I was there and I was inside the pavilion where they had the corporate things of all the great technology that's coming forward, that word corporate was really what struck out, stuck out at me.
[02:12:05.707 --> 02:12:08.270]  I mean, this is a majorly polished
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.081]  We're good to go.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:47.286]  That carbon taxes are something that's not only going to be featherbedding and crony capitalism, but it's also something that could fund a world government.
[02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:53.731]  They have to have some way to fund it, so they need a worldwide problem that they can have a worldwide tax to.
[02:12:54.051 --> 02:13:07.381]  So they understand the danger of that, but they don't understand, many of them, when I was talking about my concerns when Rex Tillerson was even announced that they were thinking about making him Secretary of State, I was concerned about his previous stance on
[02:13:09.022 --> 02:13:11.944]  On all these issues, climate issues, carbon issues, that sort of thing.
[02:13:11.964 --> 02:13:14.826]  And a lot of people would say, oh, but he worked for an oil company.
[02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:17.027]  He's not going to want to restrict oil.
[02:13:17.087 --> 02:13:18.628]  And it's like, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[02:13:18.989 --> 02:13:24.492]  I mean, De Beers wants a monopoly on diamonds, and they don't necessarily want to pump out lots of diamonds.
[02:13:24.512 --> 02:13:28.374]  They want to pump out a few diamonds and have them be very, very expensive.
[02:13:28.414 --> 02:13:30.376]  That's where these oil companies are coming from.
[02:13:30.396 --> 02:13:37.200]  The oil companies are on the side of the UN and these climate change crony capitalists.
[02:13:38.024 --> 02:13:44.206]  Yeah, we actually saw recently that Shell was paying its top executives bonuses for their sustainability lifestyle.
[02:13:44.286 --> 02:13:47.327]  So, this is pervasive throughout the corporations.
[02:13:47.367 --> 02:13:51.109]  What I would call the multi-lateral, or not what I would call, the multinational corporations.
[02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:54.390]  And, you know, we're seeing that across America, the corporatization of America.
[02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:57.611]  They're repping, they're spinning up all these industries.
[02:13:58.131 --> 02:14:01.212]  And these large international corporations have big stakes in this.
[02:14:01.232 --> 02:14:02.933]  They're overseas already in all of this.
[02:14:02.973 --> 02:14:03.873]  They're doing all this.
[02:14:03.893 --> 02:14:05.354]  There's portfolios within these
[02:14:06.154 --> 02:14:06.795]  Absolutely.
[02:14:06.815 --> 02:14:09.777]  And let's talk about the renewable energy mandates as well, because when we look at
[02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:29.992]  Talk about some of the positive moves that have happened at the EPA under Scott Pruitt.
[02:14:30.332 --> 02:14:38.236]  But then also we understand that there are a lot of states, what is it, about half of the states that have renewable energy mandates that are going to come in.
[02:14:38.276 --> 02:14:46.239]  So as we see some of these regulations to put coal out of business, we also understand that there's all these renewable energy mandates that are out there as well.
[02:14:46.693 --> 02:14:55.847]  Yeah, I think that, not surprisingly, the tip of the spear in this is California, which thinks somehow it's going to go 100% renewable by 2050, which is not that far down the road.
[02:14:56.829 --> 02:14:58.532]  I don't know how you're going to run L.A.
[02:14:58.552 --> 02:15:01.336]  and San Francisco on wind and solar, but somehow they do.
[02:15:02.197 --> 02:15:02.458]  Yeah.
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:27.524]  On this very issue under the dormant commerce clause in terms of international interstate commerce, saying that you can't have one set of rules for an interstate grid.
[02:15:27.544 --> 02:15:29.965]  You can't have one rule of one state and one and not another.
[02:15:30.566 --> 02:15:34.748]  We lost that state in that circuit, but the similar suit was filed.
[02:15:34.788 --> 02:15:39.970]  I believe it was in Minnesota, a different district, federal district, and that went the right way.
[02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:42.711]  And so we actually thought the Supreme Court was going to take that up, but they never did.
[02:15:43.932 --> 02:15:46.313]  But those are lying in wait.
[02:15:46.373 --> 02:15:46.753]  I mean, I think
[02:15:47.416 --> 02:15:48.727]  Yeah, and I don't want to be
[02:15:49.528 --> 02:15:52.689]  You know, thinking that this would have been better, certainly if the election was the other way.
[02:15:53.609 --> 02:15:54.169]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:59.391]  That's what I wake up every day and thank the good Lord that, you know, we have a fighting chance because of Trump.
[02:15:59.831 --> 02:16:05.693]  But I don't also think for a minute that every one of these battles is anywhere near being over.
[02:16:06.393 --> 02:16:16.676]  And we're seeing it even with a Republican House, Republican Senate and Republican administration, where we can't get even the basic things like a campaign promise to get out of a treaty in Paris.
[02:16:16.736 --> 02:16:19.197]  I mean, the things that should be slam dunks are not.
[02:16:20.007 --> 02:16:20.748]  And that's key, too.
[02:16:20.828 --> 02:16:30.595]  Let's go back to that, because Chris Horner, who is a senior legal fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, where you are, he said this about the Paris Agreement as to why it matters.
[02:16:30.635 --> 02:16:41.123]  He said, the Paris Agreement pressure machine will trigger blowback every time the President or Congress or future administrations deviate from Obama's emission reduction promises.
[02:16:41.463 --> 02:16:41.703]  All right.
[02:17:02.998 --> 02:17:07.460]  Have a regulatory regime right now that's going to come in and say, we're going to get rid of these regulations.
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:14.023]  If you leave the foundation there, then they're going to continue to go back to that and the courts will go back to it as well, as long as that is there.
[02:17:14.183 --> 02:17:14.543]  It won't be.
[02:17:15.313 --> 02:17:15.693]  Exactly.
[02:17:15.893 --> 02:17:17.754]  And I think I was going to mention the endangered and finding.
[02:17:17.774 --> 02:17:19.074]  I mean, you're right on the money there, too.
[02:17:19.114 --> 02:17:28.038]  That's the one that that's the underlying issue that EPA came up with or manufactured that allows all of them to regulate greenhouse gas and everything else in the clean power plant.
[02:17:28.398 --> 02:17:30.158]  Yeah, it's a little like a zombie or Frankenstein.
[02:17:30.178 --> 02:17:34.240]  I mean, you can these things will be asleep maybe for four years or eight years, whatever it's going to be.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:35.800]  But you can certainly start them up again.
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:41.362]  And if you don't do anything at all, which is some of the some people are advocating, then you're right.
[02:17:41.402 --> 02:17:42.283]  That's going to be precedent.
[02:17:42.323 --> 02:17:42.863]  That's there.
[02:17:43.483 --> 02:17:54.607]  Just because he signed an executive order saying that, you know, the Clean Power Plan should be remanded back to the EPA, the EPA, because it's on the books now, has to come up with something.
[02:17:54.627 --> 02:17:55.607]  They have to do something.
[02:17:56.467 --> 02:18:07.671]  And the other problem you have is Trump's having a very difficult time getting all his lower-level people in underneath, and you essentially have career bureaucrats that you know are not on the same page.
[02:18:07.691 --> 02:18:08.792]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:18:10.032 --> 02:18:13.054]  You know, it's interesting, we're talking about these renewable mandates at the state level.
[02:18:13.074 --> 02:18:19.879]  One of the reasons why a lot of people say, but I like solar energy, and I like solar energy on an individual basis as well, if you're not on the grid.
[02:18:19.899 --> 02:18:27.544]  But if you put out a massive power station that is on the grid, you have to be able to deliver rock-solid, steady-state power.
[02:18:28.044 --> 02:18:33.392]  And these renewable sources can't do that without massive, massive storage of energy.
[02:18:33.432 --> 02:18:38.981]  You can store the energy to take out of those ups and downs on an individual basis.
[02:18:39.021 --> 02:18:41.504]  You can spend a lot of money on batteries and it's very expensive to do that.
[02:18:41.805 --> 02:18:43.648]  You can't do that on the grid level.
[02:18:43.968 --> 02:18:56.817]  So what they wind up doing is going back to these other forms of energy, whether it's coal or oil, they fall back on these plants and then they're recycling these plants up and down and utilizing them in a much less efficient way.
[02:18:56.857 --> 02:19:05.343]  They use more fuel, they create more emissions, because just like your car, if you're stopping and starting at traffic lights, you're going to be using a lot more fuel.
[02:19:05.624 --> 02:19:07.485]  So it's a lot less efficient to do that.
[02:19:08.025 --> 02:19:10.646]  I think that's something that a lot of people really don't understand.
[02:19:10.666 --> 02:19:15.929]  I mean, we want to see some of these other alternatives work, but it just simply doesn't matter.
[02:19:16.029 --> 02:19:18.470]  And even if you try to make it larger, they did that in the North Sea.
[02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:21.452]  They tried to get a larger wind field.
[02:19:21.732 --> 02:19:23.593]  And they went all up and down the coast of Ireland.
[02:19:23.633 --> 02:19:26.574]  All it did was make the peaks and the troughs deeper and higher.
[02:19:27.134 --> 02:19:29.315]  So they couldn't get a steady state out of that renewable.
[02:19:29.355 --> 02:19:33.137]  That's the key thing if you're going to have a power grid, is that you need to have it renewable.
[02:19:33.477 --> 02:19:34.678]  I mean, stable, rather.
[02:19:35.689 --> 02:19:36.169]  Exactly.
[02:19:36.609 --> 02:19:41.311]  That's a big issue as reliability and grid consistency.
[02:19:42.012 --> 02:19:44.693]  And you can't get those out of renewables.
[02:19:45.133 --> 02:19:48.974]  And again, by renewables we're talking primarily wind and solar.
[02:19:48.994 --> 02:19:50.275]  They don't even count for some reason.
[02:19:50.295 --> 02:19:50.615]  I don't know.
[02:19:50.635 --> 02:19:54.737]  And I grew up in New England, which relied heavily on... Stay with us, Craig.
[02:19:54.757 --> 02:19:56.617]  We're going to have one more segment.
[02:19:56.637 --> 02:19:57.538]  We've got to take a quick break.
[02:19:57.558 --> 02:20:00.379]  We'll be right back with Craig Richardson, ENE Legal.org.
[02:20:03.294 --> 02:20:05.455]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[02:20:05.835 --> 02:20:17.781]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[02:20:17.801 --> 02:20:22.943]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[02:20:22.963 --> 02:20:24.104]  You can look them up for yourself.
[02:20:24.804 --> 02:20:34.508]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[02:20:34.648 --> 02:20:40.791]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[02:20:41.671 --> 02:20:43.532]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[02:20:44.513 --> 02:20:45.753]  People are falling apart.
[02:20:45.793 --> 02:20:46.794]  They're totally depressed.
[02:20:46.814 --> 02:20:47.354]  They're unhappy.
[02:20:47.934 --> 02:20:48.915]  What is going on?
[02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:54.017]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[02:20:55.273 --> 02:20:57.855]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:20:58.235 --> 02:20:59.936]  Today we call it bone broth.
[02:21:00.136 --> 02:21:07.141]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:21:07.381 --> 02:21:15.687]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[02:21:17.097 --> 02:21:23.603]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[02:21:23.983 --> 02:21:27.407]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:21:27.447 --> 02:21:30.569]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[02:21:31.170 --> 02:21:36.255]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:21:36.775 --> 02:21:50.643]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[02:21:50.763 --> 02:21:52.224]  The bone is so amazing.
[02:21:52.624 --> 02:21:58.227]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:21:59.349 --> 02:22:02.270]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:22:02.810 --> 02:22:08.252]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[02:22:08.533 --> 02:22:17.996]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[02:22:18.276 --> 02:22:22.838]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[02:22:23.078 --> 02:22:24.859]  This is a absolute win-win.
[02:22:24.919 --> 02:22:27.699]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.

[02:24:12.850 --> 02:24:14.091]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:14.111 --> 02:24:14.712]  I'm David Knight.
[02:24:14.752 --> 02:24:18.536]  We're talking to Craig Richardson with enelegal.org.
[02:24:18.596 --> 02:24:20.358]  That's Energy and Environment Issues.
[02:24:20.378 --> 02:24:26.285]  We're going to talk to him a little bit more about the importance of getting out of the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:24:26.305 --> 02:24:30.029]  And of course there's opposition from Jared and Ivanka and Rex Tillerson to that.
[02:24:30.629 --> 02:24:36.193]  Donald Trump has advocated getting out of that, as well as his pick for EPA, Scott Pruitt.
[02:24:36.694 --> 02:24:38.555]  So we're hoping that we can win this debate.
[02:24:38.615 --> 02:24:44.820]  It's a war over the hearts and minds there in the White House, and E&E Legal is a big part of that.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:52.366]  Before we get back to Craig, I just want to remind you that we have our continued special for Caveman, 53% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:24:52.646 --> 02:24:54.047]  That's an additional 20% off.
[02:24:54.327 --> 02:24:57.450]  And also we have a flash special on Liver Shield.
[02:24:58.090 --> 02:25:00.051]  30% off at Infowarslife.com.
[02:25:00.071 --> 02:25:08.073]  You heard Dr. Group talking about fatty liver and talking also about the fact that your liver regenerates very quickly.
[02:25:08.113 --> 02:25:12.394]  It's one of the most quickly regenerating parts of your body.
[02:25:12.894 --> 02:25:16.895]  Liver Shield uses a powerful blend of organic and wild-crafted herbs.
[02:25:16.955 --> 02:25:21.576]  It supports natural function and detoxification of the liver and gallbladder.
[02:25:22.276 --> 02:25:23.336]  Try Liver Shield right now.
[02:25:23.376 --> 02:25:24.397]  You can get 30% off.
[02:25:24.437 --> 02:25:25.737]  This is a flash sale.
[02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:28.678]  It's going to be very short at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:25:28.718 --> 02:25:30.959]  Again, that's 30% off Liver Shield.
[02:25:32.219 --> 02:25:36.721]  Craig, when we're talking about this, one of the things that Chris Horner had pointed out
[02:25:37.754 --> 02:25:46.460]  On your site is that this back and forth that we see between the forces with Jared and Ivanka to try to stay in the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:54.145]  They would like to try to keep evidently a middle ground and try to rationalize that, you know, we don't have to say anything about it.
[02:25:54.205 --> 02:25:56.047]  We can just kind of quietly leave it there.
[02:25:56.927 --> 02:26:03.912]  As we pointed out before, Chris said if you leave it there, it's going to be the foundation for future regulation, just as we see with Obamacare.
[02:26:03.932 --> 02:26:10.177]  If we don't repeal the fundamental stuff there, we can mess around and rearrange the deck chairs of these mandates.
[02:26:10.257 --> 02:26:12.379]  But the fundamental basis is still going to be there.
[02:26:12.399 --> 02:26:14.300]  And that's true with the climate treaty.
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:21.245]  And as Chris Horner said, the State Department guidelines establish what the treaty criteria are.
[02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:22.987]  Of course, we know in the Constitution as well.
[02:26:23.767 --> 02:26:26.089]  Absolutely, and that is one of the plans, is to send it to the Senate.
[02:26:43.285 --> 02:26:45.506]  Like you said, that's the way the Constitution laid it out.
[02:26:45.906 --> 02:26:47.927]  And that's why I'm not sure why we're having this debate.
[02:26:48.808 --> 02:26:51.289]  We're banging our heads against the wall saying, I thought we won the election.
[02:26:52.850 --> 02:26:59.033]  And I think you're going to see, and I'm sure you remember the Read My Lips No New Taxes pledge.
[02:27:00.194 --> 02:27:02.255]  Yeah, this could be one of those moments for him.
[02:27:02.575 --> 02:27:11.598]  I mean, CEI put out an ad, which we had on our site as well, you may have seen, taking that very clip that candidate Trump set on the trail last year.
[02:27:11.618 --> 02:27:16.039]  I don't think he could have been any more clear about what his plans were and why he was going to get out.
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:16.820]  Exactly.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:21.422]  They can make this up, your organization, to make this more of an issue.
[02:27:21.442 --> 02:27:24.104]  What else can people do to get this going?
[02:27:24.344 --> 02:27:33.288]  Talking about it on social media, making sure that President Trump understands that we want him to keep this promise, that we understand the danger of leaving that thing sitting there.
[02:27:33.328 --> 02:27:33.949]  What can people do?
[02:27:34.622 --> 02:27:35.202]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:35.222 --> 02:27:37.023]  I mean, all the things that they did during the campaign.
[02:27:37.063 --> 02:27:38.403]  I mean, they need to be tweeting about it.
[02:27:38.423 --> 02:27:40.104]  They need to be posting on Facebook about it.
[02:27:40.144 --> 02:27:41.444]  They need to be getting to the White House.
[02:27:41.484 --> 02:27:45.946]  They need to be getting to some of the other people outside of the ones you mentioned.
[02:27:46.126 --> 02:27:49.687]  There's a few other people in the White House themselves who need to hear from this.
[02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:52.608]  But most of all, they need to make noise and say, look, we voted for you.
[02:27:52.688 --> 02:27:56.709]  We took we took a pass on this or a flyer on this.
[02:27:56.769 --> 02:27:59.050]  And you said you were going to do this and you need to do this.
[02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:04.232]  I mean, these are the people that put him in there and the ones that are telling him otherwise are not the ones that have
[02:28:04.352 --> 02:28:17.381]  And I think it's very important to understand that the Washington establishment knows how to leave the framework in place.
[02:28:17.421 --> 02:28:18.742]  We saw it with Obamacare.
[02:28:19.042 --> 02:28:24.966]  We saw that they said, well, phase two, we're going to have the secretary come in and get rid of certain things.
[02:28:25.446 --> 02:28:27.788]  And we can try to do that at the EPA.
[02:28:28.468 --> 02:28:32.471]  They set up this situation where they decided they were going to kill an entire industry, the coal industry.
[02:28:32.491 --> 02:28:33.872]  They talked about bankrupting it.
[02:28:34.172 --> 02:28:34.512]  We're good to go.
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:05.446]  And if we leave this ambiguous situation about the Paris Climate Treaty, are we in, are we out?
[02:29:05.466 --> 02:29:06.587]  Well, let's not talk about that.
[02:29:06.927 --> 02:29:15.715]  They will revive this with the next president that comes in, and they will move this forward if we don't pull this thing out and repeal it.
[02:29:16.096 --> 02:29:17.157]  That's a very important thing.
[02:29:17.217 --> 02:29:18.918]  Or have a vote, up and down, as you point out.
[02:29:19.399 --> 02:29:20.240]  Take that to the Senate.
[02:29:21.289 --> 02:29:30.572]  Exactly, and the other thing about leaving it there, which I think you already touched on, is then you have the whole court system and the NRDC, the environmental group, is just lowering up, lowering up all over the place.
[02:29:31.092 --> 02:29:39.675]  And so if you don't deal with these precedents now in a very clean, legal way, you're just going to put you, you're going to leave it up to the Ninth Circus in California to decide.
[02:29:39.895 --> 02:29:43.117]  That's right, you leave that framework there, they will use it to hang us.
[02:29:43.477 --> 02:29:46.540]  Thank you so much, Craig Richardson, enelegal.org.
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:47.480]  Stay with us when we come back.
[02:29:48.121 --> 02:29:51.643]  Alex Jones' report, we did not elect Ivanka as president.
[02:29:51.903 --> 02:29:55.045]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.986 --> 02:29:58.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:09.497]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:30:09.677 --> 02:30:10.257]  I take this.
[02:30:10.517 --> 02:30:11.537]  My family takes this.
[02:30:11.637 --> 02:30:15.879]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:30:15.919 --> 02:30:20.380]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:25.083]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:30:25.163 --> 02:30:26.223]  I don't feel good.
[02:30:26.303 --> 02:30:29.805]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:30:30.046 --> 02:30:32.707]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:30:32.747 --> 02:30:38.070]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:30:38.551 --> 02:30:40.972]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:30:41.512 --> 02:30:44.934]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:30:45.054 --> 02:30:47.236]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:30:47.296 --> 02:30:47.656]  I love it.
[02:30:47.816 --> 02:30:50.419]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:30:50.619 --> 02:30:51.580]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:57.265]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:57.445 --> 02:30:59.207]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:30:59.467 --> 02:31:01.670]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:31:12.927 --> 02:31:20.837]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:20.897 --> 02:31:24.001]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:26.671]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:31:48.797 --> 02:31:55.526]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:31:55.927 --> 02:31:56.688]  It's a win-win.
[02:31:57.168 --> 02:31:57.929]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:03.174 --> 02:32:05.675]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:05.755 --> 02:32:08.076]  Listen to these headlines from just the last week.
[02:32:08.396 --> 02:32:11.897]  Four times in four days, Russian military aircraft fly off U.S.
[02:32:11.958 --> 02:32:13.598]  coast, some nuclear-capable.
[02:32:13.918 --> 02:32:14.178]  U.S.
[02:32:14.198 --> 02:32:16.299]  sends nuclear snipper plane to Korea.
[02:32:16.519 --> 02:32:22.222]  China tests missile on deadly new destroyer ship near North Korea as it warns it's getting troops battle-ready.
[02:32:22.542 --> 02:32:22.802]  U.S.
[02:32:22.882 --> 02:32:26.863]  preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.
[02:32:27.124 --> 02:32:28.064]  Washington, D.C.
[02:32:28.104 --> 02:32:30.565]  to hold massive coordinated terror attack drill.
[02:32:30.805 --> 02:32:33.265]  Feds prepare for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[02:32:33.466 --> 02:32:37.086]  North Korea flexes muscle in unprecedented live fire drill.
[02:32:37.326 --> 02:32:37.726]  D.C.
[02:32:37.826 --> 02:32:41.147]  area first responders prepare for a complex terror attack.
[02:32:41.567 --> 02:32:41.847]  U.S.
[02:32:41.907 --> 02:32:45.448]  Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel in Persian Gulf.
[02:32:45.688 --> 02:32:48.668]  Air Force launches test missile off California coast.
[02:32:49.088 --> 02:32:49.949]  Entire U.S.
[02:32:50.009 --> 02:32:52.669]  Senate called for meeting on North Korea briefing.
[02:32:52.929 --> 02:32:57.750]  And now, NBC News is telling its audience what to do in case of a nuclear attack.
[02:32:57.970 --> 02:33:00.112]  Will this Cold World War ever go hot?
[02:33:00.232 --> 02:33:02.533]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:17.164 --> 02:33:23.188]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:23.909 --> 02:33:25.530]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.522 --> 02:33:34.724]  We did not elect Ivanka Trump to be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:33:35.264 --> 02:33:36.785]  I think she's talented, she's beautiful.
[02:33:38.986 --> 02:33:41.807]  I think the dresses she wears, her clothing line are cool.
[02:33:41.827 --> 02:33:43.148]  I have nothing against her personally.
[02:33:43.728 --> 02:33:44.528]  Or Jared Kushner.
[02:33:44.749 --> 02:33:46.109]  But we didn't elect him to be President either.
[02:33:46.589 --> 02:33:47.370]  He's a Democrat.
[02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:49.671]  His dad went to prison for fraud.
[02:33:49.691 --> 02:33:52.512]  His 666 building's going, you know, sideways.
[02:33:54.804 --> 02:33:56.805]  The Communist Chinese, you know, are involved with him.
[02:33:56.985 --> 02:33:58.746]  We told you about that months ago, weeks ago.
[02:33:58.766 --> 02:34:00.426]  Now it's in the New York Times today.
[02:34:01.467 --> 02:34:02.247]  We didn't elect her.
[02:34:02.707 --> 02:34:08.410]  And she's over in Germany with Merkel that opened the borders up for all the Islamists, 80% military age men.
[02:34:08.430 --> 02:34:11.631]  And she says for women we should let refugees in.
[02:34:12.832 --> 02:34:15.033]  And that her dad's wrong and she wants him to change his mind.
[02:34:15.153 --> 02:34:15.373]  What?
[02:34:17.374 --> 02:34:21.736]  From seven unvetted countries where the Islamists just issue fake passports basically?
[02:34:23.505 --> 02:34:24.125]  To terrorists?
[02:34:24.626 --> 02:34:26.147]  ISIS is being defeated right now.
[02:34:26.567 --> 02:34:27.988]  Al-Qaeda is being defeated in Syria.
[02:34:28.288 --> 02:34:29.609]  Trump's keeping his promise on that.
[02:34:30.209 --> 02:34:34.291]  And as the Rand Corporation, globalists have come out and admitted, that's going to squeeze out those terrorists.
[02:34:34.311 --> 02:34:36.272]  They're looking for more terror attacks from that.
[02:34:36.853 --> 02:34:38.554]  And ISIS is ordering those attacks.
[02:34:38.594 --> 02:34:39.394]  We see them happening.
[02:34:39.434 --> 02:34:43.397]  The car attacks, the bomb attacks, the stabbing attacks, the shooting attacks almost every day in Europe.
[02:34:44.417 --> 02:34:45.518]  So the answer is bring more in!
[02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:47.071]  Because you're for women.
[02:34:47.471 --> 02:34:48.772]  More genital mutilation.
[02:34:49.312 --> 02:34:50.032]  More burkas.
[02:34:50.112 --> 02:34:53.033]  I saw an article, uh, Zinder Spiegel pushing it.
[02:34:53.473 --> 02:35:00.276]  German newspapers are saying women should wear hijabs to fight Islamophobia.
[02:35:01.035 --> 02:35:03.737]  That's what the Soros groups have women doing at these marches.
[02:35:03.797 --> 02:35:12.183]  It's so surreal to see naked lesbians with their tops off saying Allah Akbar, when in Muslim countries they'd be in prison or dead, you know, just like that.
[02:35:13.023 --> 02:35:13.744]  And that's a fact!
[02:35:13.844 --> 02:35:14.944]  That's not Islamophobia!
[02:35:15.185 --> 02:35:17.166]  That's the reality that they're not tolerant!
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:24.203]  They're not tolerant of less radical Muslims like Kurds and Alawites.
[02:35:24.223 --> 02:35:25.084]  I mean, that's a fact!
[02:35:25.684 --> 02:35:26.685]  Not a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:26.825 --> 02:35:28.006]  The fact that I'm informed.
[02:35:28.206 --> 02:35:29.647]  The fact that I know what I'm talking about.
[02:35:29.867 --> 02:35:31.468]  The fact that I have history and common sense.
[02:35:32.049 --> 02:35:35.952]  And then, the fact that that trumps all the pseudo-intellectual fake leftists out there.
[02:35:36.172 --> 02:35:39.215]  They don't know what to do if they make jokes about people that are informed!
[02:35:41.016 --> 02:35:41.736]  Pisses me off.
[02:35:42.797 --> 02:35:43.738]  So we didn't elect her.
[02:35:43.758 --> 02:35:45.760]  Now here's the paradox.
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:48.502]  I always said the elite were truly after
[02:35:49.781 --> 02:35:55.045]  Trump, the elite didn't like him because of his nationalism, his anti-globalism, so he actually wanted to be president.
[02:35:55.485 --> 02:35:57.887]  I said, the danger is, the elite really hate him.
[02:35:59.208 --> 02:35:59.689]  That was real.
[02:36:00.209 --> 02:36:10.957]  But what if he's just coming in as an outside predator group to take globalism that they used America to build away from them and then use it for his own system?
[02:36:12.539 --> 02:36:14.160]  Well, that remains to be seen if he's, you know,
[02:36:15.643 --> 02:36:17.144]  Getting funding off of it or something.
[02:36:17.405 --> 02:36:19.987]  But the globalists didn't care whether he was for real or not.
[02:36:20.027 --> 02:36:22.609]  The fact was, he was coming in to take over their operation.
[02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:25.471]  And so that's why that's so important.
[02:36:26.372 --> 02:36:36.020]  And he's done so good on moving for tax cuts, demonizing and trying to overthrow Obamacare, and getting all the jobs back on the stock market, and killing TPP, the list goes on and on.
[02:36:36.921 --> 02:36:39.443]  That I say, hey, this is really great, but it is paradoxical.
[02:36:39.904 --> 02:36:40.584]  On the other side,
[02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:44.431]  You know, he's saying go after WikiLeaks when WikiLeaks got him elected.
[02:36:45.072 --> 02:36:57.398]  That's a stab in the back and you know all this other craziness and I don't even know what to say at this point about that because it's just such a flip-flop.
[02:36:58.417 --> 02:37:00.319]  He told Wikileaks, please release more of the data.
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:02.442]  So that means you've got to arrest yourself.
[02:37:03.303 --> 02:37:04.284]  If that's what you're going to do, Trump.
[02:37:04.344 --> 02:37:05.005]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:37:05.465 --> 02:37:07.508]  So what is your CIA director and what is Sessions doing?
[02:37:07.748 --> 02:37:08.990]  I'm not out to get those guys.
[02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.710]  I'm not their enemies.
[02:37:10.031 --> 02:37:11.352]  I want to be real and decent.
[02:37:11.853 --> 02:37:12.694]  That's quite a flip-flop.
[02:37:14.496 --> 02:37:15.697]  So, it's a paradox.
[02:37:15.757 --> 02:37:16.759]  I'm glad we didn't get Hillary.
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:21.244]  But think of how undead Hillary was, how pathetic she was.
[02:37:22.886 --> 02:37:23.967]  Everybody would have come out against her.
[02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:28.233]  The good news is Trump, for the nationalist brand, is very strong.
[02:37:28.573 --> 02:37:30.235]  Nationalism is spreading all over the world.
[02:37:30.736 --> 02:37:32.398]  Very, very exciting things are happening.
[02:37:33.239 --> 02:37:34.501]  This is a great time to be alive.
[02:37:36.610 --> 02:37:42.297]  And so, we can't just become demoralized if Trump starts going sideways, or off his trajectory some.
[02:37:42.957 --> 02:37:45.140]  Because all over the world, the pen's about to win.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:46.962]  All over the world, nationalism's rising.
[02:37:46.982 --> 02:37:57.534]  It doesn't mean it's going to be perfect, but it's the idea of sovereignty and governments and systems for prosperity and open, free societies, not authoritarian globalism, which is crony capitalism.
[02:37:59.514 --> 02:38:10.542]  And we've got record numbers elected in the House, the Freedom Caucus, not selling us out, saying no to Trump and the Democrats on their deal that wasn't as, you know, what they promised on Obamacare.
[02:38:11.003 --> 02:38:13.164]  And we've got 900 new people elected to legislatures.
[02:38:13.645 --> 02:38:14.805]  And we've got all these new governors.
[02:38:14.886 --> 02:38:16.627]  And just, let's stay in the Liberty Movement.
[02:38:16.667 --> 02:38:18.168]  Let's have more people run for office.
[02:38:18.508 --> 02:38:20.930]  Let's have more people support independent media telling the truth.
[02:38:21.390 --> 02:38:23.112]  And let's just continue to move forward.
[02:38:23.732 --> 02:38:33.819]  With this movement of national sovereignty, and freedom, and western civilization, and renaissance, and the printing press, and just an open, free culture.
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:38.382]  Soros calls himself, you know, the open society or whatever.
[02:38:38.642 --> 02:38:40.143]  He's the opposite of an open society.
[02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.685]  Pushing authoritarianism all over the world.
[02:38:44.266 --> 02:38:46.508]  And so, this is a great time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:47.088 --> 02:38:48.609]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:52.372]  And... It's just great.
[02:38:53.263 --> 02:38:53.923]  To be alive.
[02:38:54.603 --> 02:38:56.104]  It's great to be associated with all of you.
[02:38:56.644 --> 02:39:04.426]  So don't let the fact that Trump hasn't gotten everything done, he's got a lot done, or his daughter is out there doing bizarre stuff, get you depressed.
[02:39:04.466 --> 02:39:14.949]  Because we have come from being a tiny fringe movement against globalism a decade ago, 20 years ago, to now being the hottest thing in the world because of you spreading the word, because of you taking action.
[02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:17.670]  That's an incredibly exciting thing.
[02:39:18.250 --> 02:39:20.171]  So again, I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[02:39:21.323 --> 02:39:22.724]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:39:23.164 --> 02:39:26.527]  But understand, you're supporting yourself in these fights.
[02:39:27.948 --> 02:39:32.192]  You're supporting yourself in the huge awakening that's taking place.
[02:39:33.853 --> 02:39:34.954]  You are the resistance.
[02:39:34.994 --> 02:39:39.557]  That isn't something where I pat you on the head and say, if you're receiving this transmission, you're the resistance.
[02:39:39.637 --> 02:39:41.099]  You really are the power.
[02:39:41.519 --> 02:39:42.360]  You are the people.
[02:39:44.531 --> 02:39:50.654]  Sports culture, fake, you know, liberal culture, fake video game culture, all this stuff, that's not real culture.
[02:39:50.934 --> 02:39:51.835]  That's just entertainment.
[02:39:52.335 --> 02:40:07.103]  When we make politics, and being involved, and being informed, and being active, and promoting freedom, the culture, and making fun the sport it is, the real sport, the life sport, the purpose-driven life, the whole world opens up to you.
[02:40:09.306 --> 02:40:15.428]  Young people think they don't have any future because globalism is trying to make humans obsolete, go into this whole robotic technocracy.
[02:40:15.849 --> 02:40:23.692]  We can demand with our purchases and what we promote and what we rate and what we, you know, do, how we spend.
[02:40:24.412 --> 02:40:29.333]  How we speak, word of mouth, for the culture of the world we want to build with our choices.
[02:40:29.513 --> 02:40:36.815]  But they want to bully us with political correctness, shrink our language, tell us we can't have choices, tell us we don't accept being enslaved, that we're racist.
[02:40:36.975 --> 02:40:39.156]  All this is divide-and-conquer lies!
[02:40:40.696 --> 02:40:41.916]  And we must resist it!
[02:40:43.237 --> 02:40:52.779]  I once drove in 2000 down this very road, Congress, in an old car with Rick Linklater sitting in the back with cameras on me for the film Waking Life.
[02:40:53.826 --> 02:40:58.611]  I was out right on the same road, in the morning, kind of like this, about 10 in the morning, it's 8 in the morning, 8.30.
[02:40:58.711 --> 02:41:04.097]  And I remember saying, you know, this is the dynamic human spirit that refuses to resist left, right.
[02:41:04.437 --> 02:41:06.660]  All this is just distractions by the elite.
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:16.270]  When it gets down to it, we need basic human freedom, and it's about that, and what gives us more freedom, and what empowers us, and what makes us truer, and more bonafide, and closer to God.
[02:41:17.489 --> 02:41:18.470]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:41:18.490 --> 02:41:21.933]  Now back to David Knight and the live transmission.
[02:41:22.813 --> 02:41:24.014]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:41:24.134 --> 02:41:25.936]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:41:26.416 --> 02:41:27.497]  The full might of the system.
[02:41:27.537 --> 02:41:28.518]  Things that can shut us down.
[02:41:28.758 --> 02:41:29.819]  Things that can shut you down.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.362]  So let's man the guns in the InfoWars.
[02:41:33.802 --> 02:41:38.786]  With God's help and your vision and your refusing to back down or submit, we are invincible.
[02:41:38.806 --> 02:41:40.327]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:40.387 --> 02:41:41.388]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:41:43.084 --> 02:41:47.105]  All right, now I want to take a look at some of the developments in the last 24 hours.
[02:41:47.145 --> 02:41:48.666]  We've had some developments on Obamacare.
[02:41:48.686 --> 02:41:52.187]  We've had developments, of course, on tax reform.
[02:41:52.887 --> 02:42:06.512]  And I think it's a very telling story here, because we see the real opposition to Donald Trump is coming from within the White House, as Alex was just talking about, Jared and Ivanka and Rex Tillerson, you know, pushing back against the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:42:07.072 --> 02:42:09.793]  Saying that, you know, we're just going to kind of pretend that it's not there.
[02:42:09.813 --> 02:42:17.015]  We're going to leave the framework there, just as they want to leave the framework of Obamacare in place, and do some minor tweaking to it.
[02:42:17.535 --> 02:42:21.936]  I was glad to see that Trump took the lead on tax reform.
[02:42:22.256 --> 02:42:24.497]  That's exactly what should have happened with Obamacare.
[02:42:24.517 --> 02:42:30.279]  And hopefully he learned a lesson from the disaster of Obamacare repeal, because he let
[02:42:30.999 --> 02:42:35.902]  Paul Ryan, who does not want to repeal Obamacare, make sure you understand that, okay?
[02:42:36.122 --> 02:42:38.104]  He was the running mate of Mitt Romney.
[02:42:38.404 --> 02:42:44.628]  He and Mitt Romney were picked because they were going to enact Romneycare if we didn't get Obamacare.
[02:42:44.648 --> 02:42:48.971]  And Romneycare had already been put in place in Massachusetts exactly like Obamacare.
[02:42:49.651 --> 02:42:55.115]  So the establishment had decided that they were going to give us government-run health care one way or the other.
[02:42:55.736 --> 02:43:01.080]  And although the Republicans ran on repealing Obamacare, they never had a plan to do it.
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:12.568]  Donald Trump did have a plan to repeal Obamacare, to replace mandates with markets, to replace coercion with choice, to empower you as a consumer to get cheaper health care.
[02:43:12.588 --> 02:43:15.210]  That was the stated goal of Obamacare.
[02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:16.732]  They called it the Affordable Care Act.
[02:43:17.372 --> 02:43:22.413]  You know, when Paul Ryan put it out there, all he did was change affordable to American.
[02:43:22.974 --> 02:43:24.594]  Because we all know it's not affordable.
[02:43:24.974 --> 02:43:27.035]  You can't keep selling that lie anymore.
[02:43:27.715 --> 02:43:35.257]  And so now we've had the GOP conservatives, who took so much heat, unfortunately, from Donald Trump.
[02:43:35.277 --> 02:43:38.978]  And I don't understand why he poured so much scorn on them.
[02:43:39.038 --> 02:43:41.679]  The people who should have had scorn poured on them
[02:43:42.455 --> 02:43:48.399]  Were the people who took advantage and tried to go in the other direction from Donald Trump, not the people who are running in the same direction with him.
[02:43:48.459 --> 02:43:52.863]  So now they've looked at it and said, well, all right, President Trump is going to oppose us on this.
[02:43:53.463 --> 02:43:55.464]  The establishment is going to oppose us on this.
[02:43:55.564 --> 02:43:59.908]  We'll try to do the best that we can and we'll try to move a little bit away from some of this.
[02:43:59.988 --> 02:44:05.432]  But the basic fundamental structure remains just as we see with the environment as well.
[02:44:05.872 --> 02:44:08.154]  And a good example of where this is going, as I pointed out earlier,
[02:44:09.161 --> 02:44:15.268]  California has now passed the first committee test of a single-payer health care bill.
[02:44:15.809 --> 02:44:20.494]  And understand that what we're talking about there is government-run, government-controlled health care.
[02:44:20.734 --> 02:44:22.997]  That's what Hillary tried to establish 25 years ago.
[02:44:24.301 --> 02:44:26.882]  And of course, California is right there with her.
[02:44:27.382 --> 02:44:29.543]  They want full-on socialism.
[02:44:30.003 --> 02:44:41.248]  And it's interesting, as they pass this thing, it wasn't even close, five to two in the Senate Health Committee, Democrats and Republicans still are uneasy about the major question they say in the LA Times.
[02:44:41.868 --> 02:44:43.789]  How will it be paid for?
[02:44:44.369 --> 02:44:45.570]  And they've got a lot to pay for.
[02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:52.693]  The state would supply all medical expenses for everyone, including people who aren't even
[02:44:53.573 --> 02:44:59.555]  Legal immigrants, everybody, worldwide, can come to California and get their health care paid for.
[02:45:00.235 --> 02:45:01.515]  And so, what are they going to pay for?
[02:45:01.535 --> 02:45:10.778]  They're going to pay for inpatient, outpatient, emergency services, dental, vision, mental health, nursing home care, everything for everybody.
[02:45:11.718 --> 02:45:15.099]  The measure says the program would be funded by quote-unquote broad-based revenue.
[02:45:15.759 --> 02:45:17.860]  But it doesn't specify where that comes from.
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:22.241]  So we're just going to... This is a Venezuelan mindset, folks.
[02:45:23.243 --> 02:45:26.364]  They are going to destroy health care.
[02:45:26.404 --> 02:45:28.185]  They're going to destroy the state of California.
[02:45:28.205 --> 02:45:29.386]  They're well on the way to doing that.
[02:45:30.006 --> 02:45:35.869]  And quite frankly, when we look at the tax plan, there are three points of opposition to it.
[02:45:36.509 --> 02:45:40.651]  And one of them are high-tax states like California and New York.
[02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:43.452]  California wants to have universal health care for everybody.
[02:45:43.472 --> 02:45:49.515]  They're going to pay for everything you can imagine, for everyone, even if they're not citizens of the United States or citizens of California or whatever.
[02:45:50.495 --> 02:46:00.682]  And of course they're going to have to raise their income taxes and they're hoping then that they can then deduct those income taxes from the federal taxes and put it on the federal deficit.
[02:46:00.702 --> 02:46:04.085]  So they want to move the California deficit and federalize it.
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.901]  And that's one of the things that is very controversial.
[02:46:07.921 --> 02:46:09.302]  That's one of the points of opposition.
[02:46:09.342 --> 02:46:23.268]  They say that would take about a trillion dollars off of the deficit increase to say that high-tax states like New York and California, the people who live in those states, would not be able to deduct their state taxes from their federal taxes.
[02:46:23.688 --> 02:46:24.929]  And I think that's exactly right.
[02:46:25.009 --> 02:46:25.749]  We don't want to see that.
[02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:30.551]  But then, of course, the other points of opposition to it were, as usual, envy.
[02:46:31.292 --> 02:46:34.033]  People who have businesses, people who have income, are going to get
[02:46:35.153 --> 02:46:35.793]  Tax cuts.
[02:46:35.953 --> 02:46:38.714]  And the more you have, the more your tax cut is going to be.
[02:46:38.774 --> 02:46:40.055]  And it's like, yeah, exactly.
[02:46:40.555 --> 02:46:48.017]  So therefore, if somebody else is going to get a higher return than you are off of the tax cut, then you should oppose it.
[02:46:48.117 --> 02:46:49.257]  That's the politics of envy.
[02:46:49.337 --> 02:46:51.278]  That's what takes us down to the bottom.
[02:46:51.618 --> 02:47:00.221]  But the third point of opposition is the idea, and this is being sold now within the GOP, the GOP people are saying,
[02:47:01.266 --> 02:47:04.488]  This is going to increase the deficit if we cut taxes.
[02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:05.908]  No, it doesn't.
[02:47:06.829 --> 02:47:12.011]  We've seen over and over again that tax cuts mean an increase in tax revenue.
[02:47:12.611 --> 02:47:15.073]  We saw it with Ronald Reagan, those massive tax cuts.
[02:47:15.553 --> 02:47:19.415]  And I had an article that I covered on the news last night in North Carolina.
[02:47:19.815 --> 02:47:26.978]  Carolina Partnership for Reform pointed out that in their state they did tax cuts and it boosted revenue, as you would expect.
[02:47:27.739 --> 02:47:28.859]  They had done projections in 2014.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:33.422]  And they had projected what the revenue collections were going to be in the future.
[02:47:33.502 --> 02:47:35.643]  Then the conservatives cut taxes.
[02:47:35.683 --> 02:47:37.084]  So what happened to those projections?
[02:47:38.204 --> 02:47:39.785]  Did they get less taxes?
[02:47:40.105 --> 02:47:42.767]  No, they got more taxes when they cut the rates.
[02:47:43.247 --> 02:47:44.367]  We've always seen that.
[02:47:44.528 --> 02:47:50.971]  And as they point out, faster economic growth generates government revenue and tax reduction helps the economy.
[02:47:51.111 --> 02:47:52.572]  We've seen that over and over again.
[02:47:52.732 --> 02:47:53.873]  It's not a projection.
[02:47:53.953 --> 02:47:54.873]  It's not a theory.
[02:47:54.953 --> 02:47:56.054]  It's historical fact.
[02:47:56.977 --> 02:48:03.321]  And so they show here that in 2014, they actually got 3.6% more revenue than they thought they would get before.
[02:48:03.441 --> 02:48:05.982]  In 2015, they got 3.5% more revenue.
[02:48:06.342 --> 02:48:15.268]  Already, for 2016, they haven't finished their fiscal year yet, but at $570 million above their projection through March because they cut taxes in North Carolina.
[02:48:16.428 --> 02:48:17.349]  That's the way that it works.
[02:48:17.569 --> 02:48:20.771]  Why did we get a massive deficit increase under Ronald Reagan?
[02:48:20.811 --> 02:48:22.432]  Well, it's because they wouldn't control spending!
[02:48:23.345 --> 02:48:30.709]  See, even if you get record tax revenue, as we are currently getting record tax revenue, Grudge points that out all the time.
[02:48:30.869 --> 02:48:34.912]  Look, we've got, you know, each quarter we're setting a new record in tax collection.
[02:48:35.552 --> 02:48:38.134]  But they're growing the spending so much faster.
[02:48:38.654 --> 02:48:39.915]  That creates the deficit.
[02:48:39.935 --> 02:48:43.637]  So the problem is not that our tax rates are too high.
[02:48:43.657 --> 02:48:49.040]  As a matter of fact, if they increase the tax rates, they will get less revenue and the deficit will grow even faster.
[02:48:49.420 --> 02:48:50.501]  But what we see happening
[02:48:51.201 --> 02:48:59.788]  Is, and I pointed it out last night, Paul Ryan had funded a private study and then they leaked it to the press saying that tax revenue was going to go down.
[02:49:00.108 --> 02:49:00.608]  Not true.
[02:49:01.069 --> 02:49:01.529]  Not true.
[02:49:01.949 --> 02:49:02.870]  It isn't going to go down.
[02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:11.417]  But now we have others in the Republican Party trying to lay the groundwork to push back against a tax cut, a tax reform.
[02:49:12.077 --> 02:49:17.862]  And as The Hill points out, while most Republicans favor cutting taxes, at least that's what they tell us when it comes to election time, don't they?
[02:49:18.442 --> 02:49:19.162]  They're worried.
[02:49:19.483 --> 02:49:22.444]  They're worried that the proposal will spike the deficit.
[02:49:22.944 --> 02:49:27.707]  And it's already leading to concerns that could cost Trump votes from his own party.
[02:49:27.827 --> 02:49:31.528]  Look, his opposition is the Republican Party.
[02:49:31.589 --> 02:49:33.610]  His opposition is Paul Ryan.
[02:49:33.890 --> 02:49:42.214]  And I hope, and I'm hopeful, that the fact that they brought this thing up, that they came out first with this, is a sign that he understands that
[02:49:43.271 --> 02:49:44.572]  Paul Ryan is against him.
[02:49:45.332 --> 02:49:47.773]  I think it's very important when we look at the way they spend this.
[02:49:48.274 --> 02:50:04.743]  Even as the conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, said, alright, we're going to move, we'll concede, we're not going to hold out for repeal of Obamacare, which is what the voters want, which is what we campaigned on, which is what Donald Trump campaigned on and won, it's a winning proposition, it's what the voters want.
[02:50:05.546 --> 02:50:11.850]  We know that we're going to be the scapegoats for all this, because the rest of the Republican establishment isn't going to go with it.
[02:50:12.330 --> 02:50:21.615]  So when they move, then it's reported by The Hill that the GOP takes a step forward on Obamacare replacement, but the centrists remain elusive.
[02:50:21.675 --> 02:50:23.876]  They say moderates remain elusive.
[02:50:24.136 --> 02:50:27.258]  Several centrist lawmakers said they could not say whether they would support the bill.
[02:50:27.438 --> 02:50:28.539]  These people are not centrists.
[02:50:29.299 --> 02:50:30.020]  They're not moderate.
[02:50:30.796 --> 02:50:32.577]  They're hardline statists.
[02:50:33.598 --> 02:50:41.243]  They are supporting an insurance mandate that is both socialism and fascism.
[02:50:42.044 --> 02:50:43.244]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:50:43.645 --> 02:50:44.625]  It's anti-market.
[02:50:44.845 --> 02:50:46.427]  They are not moderate.
[02:50:46.767 --> 02:50:48.228]  They are not centrists.
[02:50:48.448 --> 02:50:49.929]  But of course the press calls them that.
[02:50:49.989 --> 02:50:50.429]  Stay with us.
[02:50:50.629 --> 02:50:51.230]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:08.524 --> 02:51:10.667]  What is going on when we're all Russian agents?
[02:51:10.707 --> 02:51:12.129]  We're all... I mean, I support Trump.
[02:51:12.429 --> 02:51:14.151]  I get the missile attack made him look strong.
[02:51:14.692 --> 02:51:21.079]  I'm just saying I don't believe the chemical attack was facade because they've caught the rebels doing it before and they don't have any proof he did it.
[02:51:21.139 --> 02:51:22.261]  I'm not even attacking Trump.
[02:51:22.621 --> 02:51:25.465]  In fact, in a Machiavellian way, I'm saying, okay, you blew up an empty airfield and
[02:51:25.985 --> 02:51:27.326]  Shut them up about how you're a Russian agent.
[02:51:27.366 --> 02:51:28.546]  I kind of sickly support it.
[02:51:28.566 --> 02:51:29.186]  I've admitted that.
[02:51:29.206 --> 02:51:33.928]  Kind of becoming like Machiavelli, because now we've got a guy in there doing their own tricks against them.
[02:51:34.008 --> 02:51:36.910]  But I'm just saying, how do we know Assad did it?
[02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:39.971]  And now in newspapers everywhere, I am an Assad agent.
[02:51:40.631 --> 02:51:41.511]  We're together!
[02:51:42.312 --> 02:51:42.732]  Look at us!
[02:51:43.392 --> 02:51:44.833]  Gavin, are you getting orders from Assad?
[02:51:45.533 --> 02:51:47.394]  Yeah, I was just talking to him on the phone right now.
[02:51:47.414 --> 02:51:50.675]  He's actually here via Skype on the other TV.
[02:51:50.956 --> 02:51:53.597]  But my thing with that is I go, I don't care.
[02:51:53.617 --> 02:51:55.298]  I don't care if it was actors.
[02:51:55.478 --> 02:51:56.638]  I don't care if they just had kids.
[02:51:56.678 --> 02:51:57.198]  Go like that.
[02:51:57.779 --> 02:52:04.142]  The big picture is that the world saw a bad thing, so the big man has to go boom on the bad thing.
[02:52:04.542 --> 02:52:06.143]  And now women respect him.
[02:52:06.803 --> 02:52:08.524]  Here in America, they go, oh, the patriarchy is back.
[02:52:08.544 --> 02:52:10.945]  Because we know feminists deep down want to pay for patriarchy.
[02:52:11.445 --> 02:52:16.231]  Obama's legacy is obliterated because he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got cucked.
[02:52:16.752 --> 02:52:17.713]  So that's awesome.
[02:52:17.733 --> 02:52:19.795]  He's killed, as you say, the Russian theory.
[02:52:20.055 --> 02:52:24.661]  I think the neocons even are getting too much hubris, too confident they're going to be wiped out.
[02:52:26.323 --> 02:52:30.788]  And the biggest picture is these terrorists are absolute animals.
[02:52:31.108 --> 02:52:32.590]  They dismember our soldiers.
[02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:34.592]  They tear out beating hearts and eat them.
[02:52:34.853 --> 02:52:39.718]  They sell fingers and the market there for as war trophies.
[02:52:39.758 --> 02:52:44.183]  There's literally a market for body parts just as accoutrements.
[02:52:44.744 --> 02:52:46.245]  So, we don't negotiate with them.
[02:52:46.285 --> 02:52:47.927]  We don't send them democracy.
[02:52:48.167 --> 02:52:50.248]  We just scare them with huge fireworks.
[02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:54.492]  They drop this twenty-something thousand pound bomb and it kills them all.
[02:52:54.512 --> 02:52:58.575]  I mean, that's a, finally, and then they say, oh, he wants a military dictatorship.
[02:52:58.595 --> 02:53:00.837]  He says, I've given them total authorization.
[02:53:01.177 --> 02:53:04.460]  There was this, to carry out his constitutional orders.
[02:53:04.940 --> 02:53:08.503]  This micromanaging, call Obama, see, and he would never answer the phone.
[02:53:08.743 --> 02:53:10.925]  Sir, we have, we have been logged in the sites.
[02:53:10.945 --> 02:53:11.486]  We can't kill him.
[02:53:11.786 --> 02:53:12.306]  Oh, you, yeah.
[02:53:12.646 --> 02:53:13.507]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:53:13.527 --> 02:53:14.228]  Gavin, what do you make of that?
[02:53:14.788 --> 02:53:16.249]  I think we crippled our guys over there.
[02:53:16.269 --> 02:53:19.672]  I was talking to Terry Shepard recently and I said, how do we win this war?
[02:53:19.712 --> 02:53:21.413]  And he goes, let us do our job.
[02:53:21.933 --> 02:53:25.676]  I mean, right now they've got RPGs and they go, we're getting shot at from a mosque.
[02:53:25.696 --> 02:53:26.096]  What do we do?
[02:53:26.136 --> 02:53:27.137]  And they've got to call up.
[02:53:27.457 --> 02:53:33.682]  I talked to one vet who told me, he said, our guy had to pretend he misunderstood in order to save our lives.
[02:53:33.702 --> 02:53:36.363]  Because they were shooting from the mosque and the guy said, don't shoot the mosque.
[02:53:36.383 --> 02:53:37.584]  And he said, what was that?
[02:53:37.644 --> 02:53:37.824]  What?
[02:53:37.905 --> 02:53:38.685]  Shoot the mosque?
[02:53:38.845 --> 02:53:39.446]  Oh, what?
[02:53:40.426 --> 02:53:41.067]  No, I agree.
[02:53:41.087 --> 02:53:41.147]  No.
[02:54:13.911 --> 02:54:15.232]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:15.252 --> 02:54:15.793]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:15.813 --> 02:54:19.657]  I want to talk about a novel approach to get the wall funded.
[02:54:19.677 --> 02:54:29.626]  Of course, we have editorials from CNS and others saying, seriously, are we not going to fund the wall, but we are going to fund Planned Parenthood?
[02:54:30.307 --> 02:54:30.968]  What's going on?
[02:54:31.008 --> 02:54:32.129]  We've got Democrat
[02:54:33.570 --> 02:54:36.072]  Representatives vowing that the wall will never be built.
[02:54:36.092 --> 02:54:36.933]  We're not going to do that.
[02:54:37.394 --> 02:54:50.085]  We also had the article that we had yesterday reporting Laura Ingram with Sean Hannity saying, I've got reports that there were senators who laughed out loud at the idea of Trump's wall, GOP senators.
[02:54:50.165 --> 02:54:53.167]  So you've got the establishment saying, it isn't going to happen.
[02:54:53.488 --> 02:54:54.769]  We're not going to do a wall.
[02:54:54.829 --> 02:54:56.730]  And of course, the first thing they do is pull that.
[02:54:56.770 --> 02:54:58.092]  They can fund everything.
[02:54:58.652 --> 02:55:00.833]  But they won't fund anything at the border.
[02:55:00.853 --> 02:55:05.954]  As a matter of fact, the Democrats said, we're going to scrutinize this and make sure there's nothing in there for extra border agents either.
[02:55:06.374 --> 02:55:08.175]  They don't want anything at the border.
[02:55:08.515 --> 02:55:13.436]  And of course, a couple of days ago, I talked to Ildefonso Ortiz, who's with Breitbart, about the border.
[02:55:13.616 --> 02:55:15.617]  And he said, hey, the border's not open.
[02:55:16.237 --> 02:55:18.238]  The border is controlled by the cartels.
[02:55:18.679 --> 02:55:21.901]  They decide who comes in and who doesn't come in.
[02:55:21.921 --> 02:55:25.183]  So I'm going to give you a novel approach for how to fund that.
[02:55:25.343 --> 02:55:25.903]  Stay with me.
[02:55:26.483 --> 02:55:28.865]  Ted Cruz had a great approach for this.
[02:55:29.425 --> 02:55:31.687]  I just want to remind you that we have a Flash Special.
[02:55:32.367 --> 02:55:35.229]  LiverShield is now 30% off at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:35.270 --> 02:55:37.491]  And of course, we were talking to Dr. Group earlier.
[02:55:37.551 --> 02:55:39.213]  He was talking about that.
[02:55:39.233 --> 02:55:41.815]  He had a lot of calls about people who were diagnosed with fatty liver.
[02:55:42.616 --> 02:55:47.460]  And as he pointed out, your liver is one of the fastest regenerating parts of your body.
[02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:49.822]  You can do things to improve your liver health.
[02:55:50.442 --> 02:56:00.408]  Liver Shield uses a powerful blend of organic and wild-crafted herbs, specially formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and the gallbladder.

[02:56:29.918 --> 02:56:32.179]  Now let's play this clip here from Ted Cruz.
[02:56:32.199 --> 02:56:35.720]  He had a novel approach for how to fund the wall.
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:36.260]  Because remember,
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:39.201]  Our border is owned by the cartels.
[02:56:39.261 --> 02:56:40.382]  That's the reality, folks.
[02:56:40.422 --> 02:56:42.803]  They decide who comes in and who doesn't.
[02:56:43.203 --> 02:56:44.103]  They collect the money.
[02:56:44.163 --> 02:56:51.206]  Even though we had a top Mexican official say, hey, you keep talking about the wall, we're going to charge Americans to come into our country.
[02:56:51.266 --> 02:56:55.889]  No, the people who control the border, the people who charge people to go back and forth are the cartels.
[02:56:55.929 --> 02:56:58.570]  Here's what Ted Cruz had to say about how to fund the wall.
[02:56:59.470 --> 02:57:02.431]  Your plan, Senator, is called the El Chapo Act.
[02:57:02.552 --> 02:57:03.072]  What is this?
[02:57:04.136 --> 02:57:11.957]  Well, you know, as you know, the Democrats are threatening government shutdown because they're so opposed to building a wall, they're so opposed to finally securing our border.
[02:57:12.257 --> 02:57:14.838]  And so I've been trying to think about how can we get this done?
[02:57:15.138 --> 02:57:18.399]  How can we build the wall even in the face of democratic obstruction?
[02:57:18.839 --> 02:57:29.961]  And so yesterday I filed the El Chapo Act that provides that if El Chapo is convicted, you know, the famed Mexican drug lord, the estimates are that his criminal fortune is roughly worth about $14 billion.
[02:57:32.521 --> 02:57:38.567]  Now, coincidentally, the estimates for the cost to build a wall range from $14 to $20 billion.
[02:57:38.607 --> 02:57:46.714]  And so my legislation provides that if those assets are forfeited, those assets from El Chapo will go directly to building a wall and securing the border.
[02:57:48.398 --> 02:57:53.804]  I like the fact that he says if El Chapo is convicted, we need to get away from civil asset forfeiture.
[02:57:53.864 --> 02:57:56.107]  I don't support it even for El Chapo.
[02:57:56.527 --> 02:57:59.751]  We have to have due process even for the worst among us.
[02:58:00.572 --> 02:58:03.695]  If he's obviously a criminal, it shouldn't be any problem getting a conviction.
[02:58:03.735 --> 02:58:05.757]  It should not be a problem getting a conviction for him.
[02:58:06.017 --> 02:58:08.520]  We should not throw the rule of law and trials out.
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:10.002]  But I think that's a brilliant plan.
[02:58:10.342 --> 02:58:12.403]  The Mexican government says they're going to charge people to go across.
[02:58:12.583 --> 02:58:13.143]  Let's understand.
[02:58:13.163 --> 02:58:15.064]  It's the cartels who own the border.
[02:58:15.084 --> 02:58:17.525]  Let's let the cartels pay for the wall to protect us.
[02:58:17.965 --> 02:58:21.426]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about some moves towards sanctuary cities.
[02:58:21.466 --> 02:58:26.468]  Today, the Texas House okayed banning sanctuary cities.
[02:58:26.528 --> 02:58:34.691]  And they said, not only are we going to cut your funding, we will arrest law enforcement officers like the local sheriff here if you defy our law.
[02:58:34.731 --> 02:58:35.111]  Stay with us.
[02:58:35.132 --> 02:58:35.712]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:35.732 --> 02:58:36.272]  We'll cover that.
[02:58:36.352 --> 02:58:38.513]  And then Owen Troyer will be with us for the fourth hour.
[02:58:43.311 --> 02:58:46.714]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:54.679 --> 03:00:00.643]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.430 --> 03:00:19.594]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.215 --> 03:00:25.496]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:25.556 --> 03:00:26.196]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:26.236 --> 03:00:29.157]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll have Owen Schroeder with a fourth hour.
[03:00:29.177 --> 03:00:33.619]  I want to talk about sanctuary cities because there's been a lot of developments on that this last week.
[03:00:34.199 --> 03:00:49.145]  First, we had the Trump administration say, you know, we're going to take action against the cities that will not cooperate and legally inform immigration about people who they have arrested or come in contact with that are in violation of the law.
[03:00:49.705 --> 03:00:51.626]  They will not pass that information along.
[03:00:51.666 --> 03:00:52.767]  And then you had a judge
[03:00:53.467 --> 03:00:55.107]  And the 9th Circuit, where else?
[03:00:56.108 --> 03:00:57.428]  Who said, no, you can't do that.
[03:00:58.008 --> 03:01:11.411]  And so, on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with mayors of 15 large cities, including many that were so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and he told them that we have a law here.
[03:01:12.011 --> 03:01:21.013]  And he pointed out, he said, this is a quote, this is on Breitbart, he says, the Department of Justice will fulfill our responsibility to uphold and enforce our nation's immigration laws, including, and he quotes the law,
[03:01:21.973 --> 03:01:23.074]  8 U.S.C.
[03:01:23.094 --> 03:01:23.074]  1373.
[03:01:23.434 --> 03:01:32.737]  He said, under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice required certain guarantees to certify compliance with federal law.
[03:01:32.817 --> 03:01:37.759]  And that would include obeying 8 U.S.C.
[03:01:37.779 --> 03:01:40.280]  1373 as a condition for receiving grant funding.
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:41.020]  So you see what he's saying?
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:46.582]  He said the Obama administration required that you comply with certain federal laws.
[03:01:47.342 --> 03:01:54.449]  One of those laws that you had to comply with in order to get grant funding was 8 U.S.C.
[03:01:54.649 --> 03:01:54.449]  1373.
[03:01:54.689 --> 03:01:55.330]  What does that mean?
[03:01:55.750 --> 03:02:05.740]  Well, that law prohibits local jurisdictions from preventing the Immigration and Naturalization Service from getting immigration status information on people that they detain.
[03:02:06.801 --> 03:02:11.926]  So, in other words, what he's saying is, is that, no, you're not, I don't care what the judge says.
[03:02:11.986 --> 03:02:16.070]  The judge is in direct violation and contradiction of the law.
[03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:18.953]  The law said in the Obama administration they did it.
[03:02:19.053 --> 03:02:23.557]  You have to comply with these certain rules or we will not give you grant funding.
[03:02:23.797 --> 03:02:26.159]  Today, the Texas House okayed
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:30.701]  Withholding state funds from sanctuary cities.
[03:02:30.741 --> 03:02:33.102]  And of course, that would be places like Austin, where we are.
[03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:43.406]  We had our newly elected sheriff earlier this year say, I'm not going to give any information to INS about anybody that we have detained, except for three crimes.
[03:02:44.445 --> 03:02:47.367]  It was murder and something else, a couple other things.
[03:02:47.607 --> 03:02:56.634]  And then, after a little while, somebody said, wait a minute, we just had this illegal alien arrested and he's got multiple sexual assault offenses that he's alleged to have committed and so forth.
[03:02:56.874 --> 03:02:59.316]  You're not going to let INS know about that?
[03:03:00.077 --> 03:03:02.198]  All right, well, not three, but we'll go with four.
[03:03:02.218 --> 03:03:13.447]  So she starts adding these things ad hoc as it becomes quite clear that her political slant is putting the public at risk.
[03:03:14.514 --> 03:03:18.517]  It's kind of like the Monty Python skit, you know, the Spanish Inquisition.
[03:03:18.537 --> 03:03:21.520]  We have three things that we will tell them about.
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:22.681]  Oh, well, make that four.
[03:03:22.721 --> 03:03:24.763]  You know, nobody expects the Hispanic Inquisition.
[03:03:25.443 --> 03:03:37.614]  But now what they're saying is we're not only going to, here in Texas, we're not going only to withhold funding from county and local governments if they refuse to tell INS about people that they have detained.
[03:03:38.254 --> 03:03:55.581]  But they're also saying if you're going to be that kind of sheriff or police chief, if we refuse to turn over information about people who are not only here criminally trespassing in our country, foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing, that's the first crime they committed.
[03:03:56.181 --> 03:04:02.703]  The next thing they usually do is usually they have fraudulent identity papers or they steal somebody's ID papers.
[03:04:03.263 --> 03:04:16.946]  So usually these people that are coming here in violation of our immigration laws are already two-time losers and then when they do other things like drunk driving that she doesn't want to turn them over for or sexual assault that she initially did not want to turn them over for
[03:04:17.767 --> 03:04:22.713]  You're not going to give this information to INS to see if they're also violating other laws?
[03:04:23.373 --> 03:04:27.599]  Then we're going to put you in jail because you are a part of the problem.
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:32.305]  So you have to understand that you just cannot
[03:04:33.246 --> 03:04:34.287]  I think so.
[03:05:03.947 --> 03:05:12.937]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[03:05:13.358 --> 03:05:22.849]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts.
[03:05:23.169 --> 03:05:27.932]  And gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government.
[03:05:28.112 --> 03:05:32.375]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed.
[03:05:32.615 --> 03:05:36.998]  And all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[03:05:37.259 --> 03:05:40.581]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep?
[03:05:40.721 --> 03:05:43.483]  It's because that money is being held by the federal government.
[03:05:43.803 --> 03:05:44.544]  Don't believe me?
[03:05:44.844 --> 03:05:48.006]  Just read the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby.
[03:05:48.266 --> 03:05:56.962]  She was a whistleblower from the Department of Education in the 1980s, and her tome describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons.
[03:05:57.282 --> 03:06:00.528]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:07.203]  I want to tell you about some of the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:07.223 --> 03:06:09.065]  We are under constant attack.
[03:06:09.565 --> 03:06:11.787]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[03:06:11.987 --> 03:06:14.869]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[03:06:14.909 --> 03:06:29.241]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[03:06:29.921 --> 03:06:31.561]  They can't get to us that way.
[03:06:31.921 --> 03:06:34.742]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[03:06:34.782 --> 03:06:35.762]  They don't have that power.
[03:06:36.222 --> 03:06:38.763]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[03:06:39.103 --> 03:06:41.504]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:06:41.964 --> 03:06:44.804]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:44.824 --> 03:06:46.465]  This is by listener request.
[03:06:46.705 --> 03:06:51.946]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[03:06:51.966 --> 03:06:52.526]  Again,
[03:06:53.286 --> 03:06:59.029]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[03:06:59.429 --> 03:07:03.752]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[03:07:04.332 --> 03:07:08.174]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[03:07:10.215 --> 03:07:12.937]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[03:07:12.957 --> 03:07:31.370]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com, with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack, because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[03:07:31.690 --> 03:07:34.511]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[03:07:34.551 --> 03:07:36.592]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[03:07:36.932 --> 03:07:38.932]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[03:07:39.393 --> 03:07:50.936]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[03:07:50.976 --> 03:07:54.798]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:08:11.483 --> 03:08:18.107]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:18.587 --> 03:08:21.989]  And now, your host, Owen Schroer.
[03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:28.132]  Is that James Brown or is that Maxine Waters' wig?
[03:08:29.473 --> 03:08:32.694]  It's tough for me to disseminate between the two.
[03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:35.035]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:08:35.156 --> 03:08:38.037]  Owen Schroer now relieving David Knight.
[03:08:39.118 --> 03:08:39.358]  You know,
[03:08:40.498 --> 03:08:41.479]  It's been really tough.
[03:08:42.399 --> 03:08:49.104]  All the politics, all the divide and conquer, all the different sides of all the different issues, a lot of people butting heads.
[03:08:49.144 --> 03:08:53.468]  We had the stories of families at Christmas and Thanksgiving fighting over politics.
[03:08:55.083 --> 03:08:56.064]  What brings us together?
[03:08:56.164 --> 03:08:57.845]  What is something that unites us?
[03:08:57.965 --> 03:09:02.587]  Well, it's tough to find that stuff anymore, at least outside of the bread and circus.
[03:09:03.128 --> 03:09:06.429]  Perhaps I guess this is part of it, but an interesting commercial.
[03:09:07.090 --> 03:09:12.153]  I guess this one goes against what the Pepsi commercial was trying to do.
[03:09:12.273 --> 03:09:12.593]  I don't know.
[03:09:12.633 --> 03:09:13.794]  I still don't understand the whole...
[03:09:14.875 --> 03:09:17.496]  Notion of that Pepsi commercial that was a total failure.
[03:09:18.297 --> 03:09:21.598]  But now Heineken has just put out a commercial that is kind of the opposite.
[03:09:21.618 --> 03:09:27.981]  Now this is interesting and I've always said this about myself because personally I am somebody that hates politics, okay?
[03:09:28.362 --> 03:09:29.982]  I can't stand politics.
[03:09:30.483 --> 03:09:36.746]  That's why I grew up loving sports and got started cutting my teeth in media in the sports industry.
[03:09:37.489 --> 03:09:46.076]  But once you realize the real world issues and how much the future matters and that, you know, politics actually does matter, you can't help but gravitate towards it.
[03:09:47.281 --> 03:09:52.103]  But now this ad reminds me, though, and I think it can remind all of us where we come from.
[03:09:52.183 --> 03:10:01.528]  So basically, Heineken does this social experiment where they take two people, and I think they do it with maybe four different groups.
[03:10:01.688 --> 03:10:10.733]  They take two people of totally different backgrounds, totally different political beliefs, and they have them, before they meet the other person, do a short video sit-down.
[03:10:11.213 --> 03:10:14.155]  And so then they get together and they do this little exercise and they meet each other.
[03:10:14.195 --> 03:10:16.536]  They have to build what turns out to be a bar.
[03:10:17.930 --> 03:10:25.574]  And so then after they build the bar, they have to watch the video of the other person and what they said and their views were.
[03:10:25.594 --> 03:10:31.577]  And of course the other person sees it and their jaw drops are like, whoa, that's exactly the opposite of what I think.
[03:10:31.717 --> 03:10:34.439]  I even insulted those beliefs in my short video.
[03:10:35.299 --> 03:10:39.382]  And then they put a bar on the bar and they say you have two options.
[03:10:39.782 --> 03:10:45.485]  You can either leave or you can enjoy a drink with the other person at the bar and discuss your differences.
[03:10:46.556 --> 03:11:01.327]  And it just all came together for me in that moment because no matter what, even though we got Trump in and it was a great victory for our movement, and even though there's divide along the Trump base now, it really doesn't even matter.
[03:11:02.248 --> 03:11:06.191]  Because at the end of the day, all humans should be able to break bread together.
[03:11:06.391 --> 03:11:15.818]  All humans should be able to sit down at the table and just converse and get along and not want to fight and not want to steal and not want to rob and be greedy.
[03:11:18.134 --> 03:11:26.626]  With nothing but political division in our world, in our culture, in our society, this was a very refreshing ad from Heineken.
[03:11:26.646 --> 03:11:28.088]  I'm not sitting here trying to plug Heineken.
[03:11:28.108 --> 03:11:31.653]  It was just, it was a refreshing thing to see because you just don't see it.
[03:11:31.693 --> 03:11:34.917]  You don't see people trying to bring together
[03:11:36.072 --> 03:11:39.594]  People from different backgrounds bring it together and you say, oh, but the, oh, the open borders!
[03:11:39.774 --> 03:11:40.314]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:11:40.334 --> 03:11:41.735]  That's a political agenda.
[03:11:41.775 --> 03:11:42.775]  Let's be very clear.
[03:11:43.195 --> 03:11:43.475]  Okay?
[03:11:43.495 --> 03:11:45.956]  That's not the Democrats, actually, bleeding-heart liberals.
[03:11:46.357 --> 03:11:48.037]  It's always a political agenda.
[03:11:48.438 --> 03:11:48.758]  Alright?
[03:11:49.218 --> 03:11:51.339]  Just like, uh, taxing carbon.
[03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:55.281]  Yeah, they did have ways to make billions of dollars off that, ended up being, didn't it?
[03:11:56.101 --> 03:12:03.488]  So I just wanted to point that commercial out and just, you know, because a lot of people obviously don't like me for my political views.
[03:12:03.548 --> 03:12:06.051]  You can see the videos on the streets when I'm trying to talk to these people.
[03:12:06.471 --> 03:12:08.133]  And I always end up leaving the same way.
[03:12:08.173 --> 03:12:15.160]  It's like, you know, if I was just to sit down at the bar with that person and just sit down and have a conversation and not have to
[03:12:16.474 --> 03:12:32.137]  Introduce each other with our divisions and what separates us before we got to know each other then maybe we could all truly get along so as We're all fighting all the time now as the political vortex continues to just suck us all into it
[03:12:33.038 --> 03:12:54.308]  As the divide and conquer tactics get even stronger with the mainstream media and the fake news and the lying, as the polarization of our society continues, let's all just remember that we're all flesh and blood, we're all bone, and no matter what you believe, we were all put here by the same creator.
[03:12:55.643 --> 03:13:01.289]  And we just don't get enough of that message anymore in our society and in our culture.
[03:13:01.329 --> 03:13:02.190]  And it's too bad.
[03:13:02.791 --> 03:13:03.712]  It really is too bad.
[03:13:03.732 --> 03:13:10.980]  And I guess at the end of the day, it just comes with everybody believing that we have to force our political agenda down the other one's throats.
[03:13:11.901 --> 03:13:16.787]  Of course, I think that at the top starts with a totally corrupt government.
[03:13:17.779 --> 03:13:23.163]  That has to make all sorts of moves all day long on how to protect their corruption.
[03:13:23.183 --> 03:13:42.776]  You know, that's why every time I see some story about some Obama administration, former Obama administration, or former Obama advisor, who's out of the game, not even involved anymore, nothing to do with politics, off the record, off the books, everything, but they keep doing these things, they keep spinning these wheels, and you're like, why are they even involved?
[03:13:42.796 --> 03:13:43.496]  What are they even doing?
[03:13:43.536 --> 03:13:44.417]  Go away, you're out!
[03:13:44.837 --> 03:13:47.299]  Because they're trying to cover up their corruption, folks.
[03:13:48.139 --> 03:13:49.821]  That you can never leave the game.
[03:13:50.121 --> 03:14:00.329]  When you get into this swamp, it is so deep and you are so involved that you have to cover and watch your back all day long.
[03:14:01.230 --> 03:14:05.373]  That's how corrupt this government has become, folks.
[03:14:05.394 --> 03:14:15.101]  And we, the people, who want nothing of this corruption, have nothing to do with this corruption, are being divided and conquered by the very people
[03:14:16.052 --> 03:14:17.533]  Who are indeed the most corrupt.
[03:14:19.675 --> 03:14:21.076]  So I just wanted to point that out.
[03:14:21.137 --> 03:14:23.539]  And you know, here's one of the big dividers.
[03:14:26.212 --> 03:14:28.234]  It's about sex and gender.
[03:14:28.294 --> 03:14:33.517]  Now, everybody's heard about the Bill Nye, the science, the fake science guy now.
[03:14:34.478 --> 03:14:39.822]  But here's a point that I'm not really hearing people talk about, and I want to kind of paint an overall picture before I make this point.
[03:14:40.302 --> 03:14:42.804]  First, let's start with a story from the Washington Post a few days ago.
[03:14:42.864 --> 03:14:44.465]  Mark Dice just did a video on this today.
[03:14:45.046 --> 03:14:50.390]  Don't laugh, I have a serious reason for raising my cats gender neutral.
[03:14:51.294 --> 03:14:54.497]  Yeah, the serious reason would be you have serious mental disorders.
[03:14:54.997 --> 03:15:00.202]  But she's telling a story about her cats and how she doesn't want to offend them with certain pronouns.
[03:15:01.644 --> 03:15:04.726]  And she talks about part of the story, how she goes to the vet.
[03:15:05.603 --> 03:15:09.924]  And it's such a complicated process going to the vet because she doesn't know what to tell the vet.
[03:15:10.484 --> 03:15:11.184]  Is it a guy?
[03:15:11.244 --> 03:15:11.764]  Is it a girl?
[03:15:11.824 --> 03:15:12.304]  Is it this?
[03:15:12.344 --> 03:15:22.427]  She doesn't want to have any microaggressions with the vet and it's just a very confusing, very concocted experience, very difficult at the vet to get her cats taken care of.
[03:15:23.007 --> 03:15:29.208]  And I'm just sitting here thinking, don't you see how this will infiltrate your daily life?
[03:15:30.768 --> 03:15:31.369]  Don't you see?
[03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:36.433]  It's the same paradigm if a transsexual person goes to the hospital probably.
[03:15:37.334 --> 03:15:38.415]  Or you go to the hospital with...
[03:15:40.819 --> 03:15:45.281]  Say your son or daughter, but you're so politically correct, the doctor says, is this a male or a female?
[03:15:45.761 --> 03:15:47.782]  Oh, I don't want to say male or female.
[03:15:47.822 --> 03:15:48.922]  It's just a person now.
[03:15:49.402 --> 03:15:51.703]  You know, it's my five-year-old.
[03:15:52.523 --> 03:15:53.484]  Hasn't decided yet.
[03:15:53.504 --> 03:15:55.064]  It might be male, it might be female.
[03:15:55.084 --> 03:15:56.625]  It might be pansexual.
[03:15:56.705 --> 03:15:57.885]  I don't want to put anything on him.
[03:15:58.546 --> 03:15:58.886]  Or her.
[03:15:59.426 --> 03:16:00.246]  So, I don't know.
[03:16:00.326 --> 03:16:01.947]  Just, you know, doc, I just don't know anymore.
[03:16:02.995 --> 03:16:08.420]  It's gonna get very convoluted, and eventually the doctors are just gonna say, okay, we're not dealing with you.
[03:16:09.001 --> 03:16:13.965]  Figure out if that's a male or a female, okay, and then we'll deal with this.
[03:16:14.326 --> 03:16:15.307]  And I was actually thinking about this.
[03:16:15.347 --> 03:16:17.028]  They say cisgender privilege.
[03:16:17.729 --> 03:16:18.490]  Cisgender privilege.
[03:16:18.510 --> 03:16:19.170]  Think about this though.
[03:16:21.632 --> 03:16:22.874]  Everybody is cisgender.
[03:16:24.022 --> 03:16:28.503]  Everybody is born with either a penis or a vagina.
[03:16:28.583 --> 03:16:36.686]  I guess there's, what, less than 1% of people that actually have some birth defect where they don't have a functioning one system of reproductive organs.
[03:16:37.446 --> 03:16:38.226]  Okay, but guess what?
[03:16:38.366 --> 03:16:39.466]  Everybody's a cisgender.
[03:16:39.806 --> 03:16:44.748]  If you choose not to be, that's your choice and that's actually your privilege living in America.
[03:16:44.788 --> 03:16:45.488]  So how do you like that?
[03:16:45.808 --> 03:16:49.409]  But this person can't get their cats taken care of because they're so confused over their genders.
[03:16:49.749 --> 03:16:51.390]  Imagine what'll happen at a real hospital.
[03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:53.290]  Then you have this science march.
[03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:54.811]  So get this, though.
[03:16:56.031 --> 03:17:01.593]  All of these people that get up and they're giving their speeches, I don't know the exact numbers.
[03:17:02.113 --> 03:17:09.815]  Most of them got up there and talked about how they were gay, talked about how they were transsexual, talked about how genders are not binary.
[03:17:11.075 --> 03:17:12.656]  Nobody talked about science.
[03:17:13.806 --> 03:17:17.607]  Nobody talked about any discoveries they made, any of their own accomplishments.
[03:17:18.167 --> 03:17:19.488]  No, it was just like, look at me!
[03:17:19.508 --> 03:17:21.708]  I'm a homosexual!
[03:17:22.008 --> 03:17:22.468]  Look at me!
[03:17:22.568 --> 03:17:24.189]  I used to be a woman, now I'm a man!
[03:17:24.749 --> 03:17:25.269]  Look at us!
[03:17:25.329 --> 03:17:26.389]  We deserve to be heard!
[03:17:26.430 --> 03:17:27.330]  We're in the field now!
[03:17:27.370 --> 03:17:28.270]  We're scientists!
[03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:29.410]  Yay!
[03:17:29.430 --> 03:17:31.411]  Uh, what did you accomplish?
[03:17:32.691 --> 03:17:34.352]  Well, I became a man and I was a woman.
[03:17:35.272 --> 03:17:36.592]  No, in the field of science.
[03:17:37.853 --> 03:17:39.133]  Well, actually, I guess I mean tech.
[03:17:39.213 --> 03:17:42.354]  I mean, maybe these people are up there because they're a science project.
[03:17:43.575 --> 03:17:50.418]  I mean, I guess at one point, you know, changing your sex, having a sex operation was actually a science project.
[03:17:50.798 --> 03:17:53.499]  So yes, I guess maybe that's their accomplishment.
[03:17:54.220 --> 03:17:58.602]  They were a science project that I guess was successful.
[03:17:58.622 --> 03:18:01.183]  They now are a different sex, thanks to a surgery.
[03:18:02.023 --> 03:18:08.006]  And so now they're a science project that gets to give a speech at the March for Science that doesn't actually cover any science.
[03:18:08.326 --> 03:18:10.507]  So that brings me to Bill Nye.
[03:18:11.522 --> 03:18:20.029]  And I was just thinking about this the other day, because I already covered this, and I didn't even want to talk about it, but the crew was like, no, you gotta watch this video, you gotta respond to it, everybody is, so okay, so I watched it.
[03:18:21.730 --> 03:18:24.592]  And honestly, the first time, it's like, it's almost like a good movie.
[03:18:25.373 --> 03:18:30.217]  Where, you know, the first time you see a good movie, first maybe two times even, you don't really get it.
[03:18:30.317 --> 03:18:33.139]  There's still a lot of things you don't understand, it just doesn't make sense to you.
[03:18:34.701 --> 03:18:37.602]  But it was so, it was so grasping, you just had to watch it again.
[03:18:37.983 --> 03:18:40.324]  That's how it was for me with this, this weird video.
[03:18:40.384 --> 03:18:42.585]  So, so I didn't understand this video.
[03:18:42.605 --> 03:18:44.546]  I'm watching it and I'm just like, what did I just watch?
[03:18:44.786 --> 03:18:45.847]  This doesn't make any sense.
[03:18:46.147 --> 03:18:47.567]  They didn't talk about anything really.
[03:18:47.888 --> 03:18:53.750]  Some woman just gets on stage and has some 80s rock outfit on and starts humping saying, oh, oh, oh, my sex junk.
[03:18:54.391 --> 03:18:56.152]  Okay, so, but here's my point.
[03:18:57.072 --> 03:18:58.774]  I remember growing up with Bill Nye.
[03:18:59.314 --> 03:19:00.676]  I remember Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[03:19:00.776 --> 03:19:04.039]  I remember having Bill Nye the Science Guy videos played in my class.
[03:19:04.379 --> 03:19:06.441]  Folks, it was actual science.
[03:19:06.842 --> 03:19:08.543]  He actually talked about biology.
[03:19:08.764 --> 03:19:10.305]  He actually talked about science.
[03:19:10.686 --> 03:19:12.567]  He actually talked about real stuff.
[03:19:13.610 --> 03:19:17.072]  Now, look at what your kids are learning in science class, folks.
[03:19:17.813 --> 03:19:26.279]  They're having opinion, sexual-based opinion, shoved down your throats, and they're calling it science.
[03:19:26.579 --> 03:19:28.180]  Because here's what's important to these people.
[03:19:28.961 --> 03:19:29.941]  It's not science.
[03:19:30.622 --> 03:19:32.143]  It's a political agenda.
[03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:38.903]  See, if it was about science, they wouldn't get up on the stage at the Science March and tell you they were gay.
[03:19:39.583 --> 03:19:45.506]  They wouldn't get up at the Science March and tell you that their accomplishment was how they were a transgender and now they're in the field.
[03:19:46.367 --> 03:19:49.908]  No, they would talk to you about science.
[03:19:50.969 --> 03:19:52.550]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:54.111]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[03:19:54.151 --> 03:19:54.691]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:20:02.748 --> 03:20:04.509]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman?
[03:20:04.529 --> 03:20:06.590]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:10.051]  We've been getting these different flavors, and you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[03:20:10.491 --> 03:20:13.492]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff, and I'm an old man.
[03:20:13.512 --> 03:20:14.093]  I'm 42.
[03:20:14.133 --> 03:20:17.014]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[03:20:17.194 --> 03:20:18.655]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[03:20:20.596 --> 03:20:21.717]  No, I'm not.
[03:20:21.777 --> 03:20:22.417]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:22.457 --> 03:20:23.018]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:23.118 --> 03:20:30.264]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[03:20:30.865 --> 03:20:38.091]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[03:20:38.111 --> 03:20:41.594]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[03:20:42.975 --> 03:20:48.220]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[03:20:48.260 --> 03:20:51.343]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[03:20:51.743 --> 03:20:53.045]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[03:20:53.425 --> 03:20:54.606]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[03:20:54.686 --> 03:20:55.827]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[03:20:55.847 --> 03:21:03.034]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[03:21:03.614 --> 03:21:05.555]  Yeah.
[03:21:05.575 --> 03:21:11.198]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[03:21:11.258 --> 03:21:12.979]  I felt it immediately.
[03:21:13.199 --> 03:21:15.220]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:18.381]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[03:21:18.401 --> 03:21:19.542]  It tastes good to me.
[03:21:19.642 --> 03:21:23.584]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[03:21:23.624 --> 03:21:25.665]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[03:21:28.366 --> 03:21:29.447]  Bone broth.
[03:21:29.507 --> 03:21:34.652]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[03:21:34.672 --> 03:21:38.415]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[03:21:38.455 --> 03:21:46.221]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[03:21:46.281 --> 03:21:50.985]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[03:21:51.025 --> 03:21:51.426]  Right?
[03:21:52.166 --> 03:21:58.174]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[03:21:58.534 --> 03:21:59.755]  No fear, nothing, so...
[03:22:00.435 --> 03:22:07.778]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[03:22:08.338 --> 03:22:10.139]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[03:22:10.859 --> 03:22:21.403]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[03:22:21.463 --> 03:22:22.703]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[03:22:22.743 --> 03:22:28.846]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[03:22:30.106 --> 03:22:32.367]  Uh, I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[03:22:32.407 --> 03:22:34.608]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[03:22:34.628 --> 03:22:42.712]  So you've literally built this place, uh, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the, the support that you've, you've sent us.
[03:22:42.732 --> 03:22:44.733]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it.
[03:22:44.753 --> 03:22:46.073]  Cause I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[03:22:46.093 --> 03:22:48.954]  We wouldn't have a voice, um, if it wasn't for you.
[03:22:49.054 --> 03:22:54.597]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their, uh, for their steadfastness in supporting us and, uh,
[03:22:55.137 --> 03:23:01.998]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[03:23:02.839 --> 03:23:11.860]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:20.022]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:23:20.342 --> 03:23:25.045]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:23:25.225 --> 03:23:31.930]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:32.010 --> 03:23:39.095]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:23:39.195 --> 03:23:40.896]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[03:23:41.076 --> 03:23:46.041]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:23:46.201 --> 03:23:50.545]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:23:50.685 --> 03:23:53.948]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:23:54.088 --> 03:24:00.214]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:24:00.394 --> 03:24:02.556]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:17.186 --> 03:24:19.026]  Well, not if you're living in a Democrat city.
[03:24:19.046 --> 03:24:22.987]  Probably feel a lot worse.
[03:24:23.607 --> 03:24:24.768]  Hopefully you're not dead.
[03:24:24.788 --> 03:24:31.069]  But that's just, you know, that's just a Democrat-run city, you know.
[03:24:32.489 --> 03:24:34.610]  There's no issues in Democrat-run cities.
[03:24:36.210 --> 03:24:37.291]  I follow the Democrats.
[03:24:37.311 --> 03:24:42.492]  The Democrats are on the podium all day long talking about how they want to help the poor, build the inner cities.
[03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:45.181]  Build the education system?
[03:24:45.221 --> 03:24:48.922]  I mean, Democrat-run cities should be doing pretty well, right?
[03:24:50.903 --> 03:24:52.544]  No, not the case, is it?
[03:24:53.124 --> 03:24:54.725]  And we've got the stories here to prove it.
[03:24:55.325 --> 03:24:57.606]  Pretty sad, to be honest with you folks.
[03:24:58.646 --> 03:24:59.447]  Pretty sad.
[03:25:01.107 --> 03:25:02.368]  Here's one Democrat-run city.
[03:25:02.388 --> 03:25:03.828]  This is a story from Fox News.
[03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:07.070]  Baltimore tops 100 homicides so far in 2017.
[03:25:07.310 --> 03:25:08.030]  That's nice, isn't it?
[03:25:11.906 --> 03:25:13.987]  That's a nice Democrat-run city of Baltimore.
[03:25:14.007 --> 03:25:34.378]  Of course, this is the same city of Baltimore where they had riots in the streets, burning and looting because of an incident with a civilian and a police officer, which hey, yes, if there's an incident with a police officer and a civilian and the police officer is out of line, absolutely.
[03:25:34.418 --> 03:25:35.379]  Needs to be investigated.
[03:25:35.659 --> 03:25:36.499]  Needs to be justice.
[03:25:37.180 --> 03:25:37.940]  Completely agree.
[03:25:38.660 --> 03:25:39.521]  Burning and looting?
[03:25:40.981 --> 03:25:41.861]  That's not justice.
[03:25:42.722 --> 03:25:43.802]  That only hurts your cause.
[03:25:44.702 --> 03:25:45.903]  But that's just a side note.
[03:25:46.503 --> 03:25:48.824]  That's outside of the 100 homicides.
[03:25:50.444 --> 03:25:57.867]  The city of Baltimore has suffered more than 100 homicides before the end of April for the first time in nearly 20 years.
[03:26:01.628 --> 03:26:01.989]  You know what?
[03:26:02.509 --> 03:26:03.289]  I should have looked this up.
[03:26:04.149 --> 03:26:08.411]  I wonder, probably about 20 years ago, the last time there was a Republican in office,
[03:26:09.141 --> 03:26:09.982]  That's just a theory.
[03:26:10.082 --> 03:26:10.942]  I'd have to look that up.
[03:26:11.803 --> 03:26:14.845]  But I do know that Baltimore is a strong Democrat.
[03:26:14.905 --> 03:26:18.488]  They put Democrats in office year after year after year.
[03:26:18.508 --> 03:26:23.312]  100 homicides, riots.
[03:26:23.932 --> 03:26:25.093]  Democrat-run city, folks.
[03:26:25.273 --> 03:26:25.914]  That's what you get.
[03:26:26.574 --> 03:26:27.975]  Here's another Democrat-run city.
[03:26:27.995 --> 03:26:29.336]  This is a story from CBS.
[03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:33.439]  1,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year so far.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:36.882]  How are those gun bills working out?
[03:26:40.902 --> 03:26:44.386]  How is that anti-gun legislation working out, Chicago?
[03:26:46.328 --> 03:26:46.868]  Well, let's see.
[03:26:46.888 --> 03:26:49.351]  Let's check the news today.
[03:26:49.551 --> 03:26:51.854]  A thousand shooting victims in Chicago this year.
[03:26:51.934 --> 03:26:52.054]  Oh!
[03:26:52.454 --> 03:26:53.255]  Failed, didn't it?
[03:26:53.756 --> 03:26:54.076]  Failed.
[03:26:55.578 --> 03:26:56.238]  So that's nice.
[03:26:56.278 --> 03:26:57.440]  They call it Chi-Rac.
[03:26:57.620 --> 03:26:58.040]  You know that?
[03:26:58.060 --> 03:27:01.224]  You know they call it Chi-Rac?
[03:27:02.554 --> 03:27:11.297]  The number hit 1,000 on 2017's 115th day, meaning that nearly nine people have been shot a day on average.
[03:27:13.518 --> 03:27:15.939]  174 victims have died.
[03:27:18.900 --> 03:27:19.420]  Chirac.
[03:27:21.100 --> 03:27:22.021]  Run by Democrats.
[03:27:24.201 --> 03:27:28.103]  Democrats passed gun legislation to try to keep the guns out of the hands.
[03:27:29.272 --> 03:27:29.873]  Of criminals.
[03:27:30.213 --> 03:27:31.294]  Of course, what does that do?
[03:27:32.055 --> 03:27:35.839]  It only keeps the guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens, doesn't it?
[03:27:38.241 --> 03:27:39.282]  Well, that's not true!
[03:27:39.402 --> 03:27:40.603]  We got the legislation!
[03:27:40.663 --> 03:27:41.825]  It takes time to work!
[03:27:43.086 --> 03:27:43.326]  Really?
[03:27:43.346 --> 03:27:44.747]  A thousand people shot.
[03:27:45.929 --> 03:27:46.890]  174 dead, Chicago.
[03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:48.571]  You're gonna keep electing Democrats?
[03:27:49.072 --> 03:27:50.954]  You're gonna keep passing gun legislation?
[03:27:52.615 --> 03:27:53.216]  Good luck with that!
[03:27:55.046 --> 03:27:57.727]  The Democrats probably love this from ABC News.
[03:27:58.087 --> 03:28:02.229]  Suspected arsonist in custody after two fires in Trump Hotel.
[03:28:04.770 --> 03:28:08.732]  So now you've got people attacking Trump Towers.
[03:28:10.452 --> 03:28:13.173]  And they want to complain all this about Donald Trump.
[03:28:14.214 --> 03:28:20.156]  Look, I'm not even... It's just, do you understand that life has not gotten easier for Donald Trump?
[03:28:20.236 --> 03:28:23.378]  Donald Trump did not become president to make his life easier, okay?
[03:28:24.898 --> 03:28:26.459]  He can't even have towers now.
[03:28:26.919 --> 03:28:29.181]  I bet his towers get threats every day, to be honest with you.
[03:28:30.281 --> 03:28:31.402]  They just probably don't report it.
[03:28:32.663 --> 03:28:34.944]  But that's fine.
[03:28:35.244 --> 03:28:37.666]  I hope these arsonists get arrested and it becomes a big news story.
[03:28:37.686 --> 03:28:38.907]  I don't hear anybody talking about this.
[03:28:39.527 --> 03:28:40.548]  This should be a big news story.
[03:28:41.949 --> 03:28:44.550]  Attacking Trump Towers, attacking buildings, arson.
[03:28:45.090 --> 03:28:46.912]  You can consider this person a terrorist!
[03:28:47.252 --> 03:28:48.593]  This is a politically driven event!
[03:28:49.493 --> 03:28:50.814]  Trying to burn Trump Tower!
[03:28:52.515 --> 03:28:53.356]  Oh, but that's okay.
[03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:55.821]  Let's go a little farther west.
[03:28:56.382 --> 03:29:00.706]  UC Berkeley gears up for violent protests over Coulter's speech cancellation.
[03:29:01.126 --> 03:29:02.087]  So here's what's going down.
[03:29:02.787 --> 03:29:06.090]  Coulter's cancelled her speech because of terrorists, Antifa terrorists.
[03:29:06.811 --> 03:29:07.912]  UC Berkeley loves it.
[03:29:08.212 --> 03:29:09.713]  UC Berkeley supports the terrorists.
[03:29:10.794 --> 03:29:12.075]  The UC Berkeley police
[03:29:13.021 --> 03:29:16.742]  Well, they might be in cahoots with the Antifa terrorists.
[03:29:17.002 --> 03:29:22.083]  In fact, there's some actual ties there between the Berkeley politics and Antifa.
[03:29:22.643 --> 03:29:28.785]  But tonight, there's still gonna be speeches there, and I'm gonna be live with the InfoWars Nightly News from 7 to 8 p.m.
[03:29:28.825 --> 03:29:33.546]  Central, so we're gonna keep you updated on this, but... How dare you!
[03:29:34.386 --> 03:29:38.127]  How dare Ann Coulter think that she can go to Berkeley and speak!
[03:29:39.562 --> 03:29:41.284]  What was Ann Coulter thinking?
[03:29:41.344 --> 03:29:42.585]  You thought this was America.
[03:29:42.965 --> 03:29:45.307]  You thought UC Berkeley was America, didn't you?
[03:29:45.988 --> 03:29:46.608]  You were wrong.
[03:29:46.728 --> 03:29:48.850]  UC Berkeley, that's run by Antifa now!
[03:29:49.571 --> 03:29:51.733]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show on the other side.
[03:29:52.053 --> 03:29:52.954]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.434 --> 03:29:55.036]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.976 --> 03:29:58.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.493 --> 03:30:12.460]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education following throwing a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:22.388]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts.
[03:30:22.708 --> 03:30:27.471]  And gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government.
[03:30:27.671 --> 03:30:31.913]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed.
[03:30:32.153 --> 03:30:36.536]  And all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[03:30:36.816 --> 03:30:40.098]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep?
[03:30:40.258 --> 03:30:43.059]  It's because that money is being held by the federal government.
[03:30:43.340 --> 03:30:44.100]  Don't believe me?
[03:30:44.400 --> 03:30:47.562]  Just read the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isserby.
[03:30:47.822 --> 03:30:56.512]  She was a whistleblower from the Department of Education in the 1980s, and her tome describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons.
[03:30:56.832 --> 03:31:00.076]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:31:03.004 --> 03:31:04.426]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:31:43.375 --> 03:31:45.276]  And this part is most important.
[03:31:45.436 --> 03:31:51.879]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:31:52.219 --> 03:31:53.301]  That means it's clean.
[03:31:53.662 --> 03:31:54.643]  That means it's pure.
[03:31:54.783 --> 03:31:57.608]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[03:31:57.688 --> 03:32:00.332]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:32:03.052 --> 03:32:10.816]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:11.036 --> 03:32:17.460]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:32:17.700 --> 03:32:25.984]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:32:26.244 --> 03:32:31.871]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[03:32:32.111 --> 03:32:35.014]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:32:35.254 --> 03:32:41.021]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:32:41.361 --> 03:32:41.821]  It works.
[03:32:42.101 --> 03:32:50.425]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:32:50.445 --> 03:32:59.968]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:33:00.328 --> 03:33:00.809]  A total 360 win.
[03:33:11.469 --> 03:33:18.156]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.557 --> 03:33:21.800]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:26.405 --> 03:33:30.428]  Well, you've probably heard by now that Caveman is 53% off.
[03:33:30.928 --> 03:33:34.911]  This is a ridiculous special at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:33:35.291 --> 03:33:43.717]  Not only do you get a great product when you shop at InfoWarsStore.com, but you also support InfoWars and everything we do here to keep our heads above water.
[03:33:44.137 --> 03:33:47.359]  You know that we're under attack, but the crew was just begging me.
[03:33:47.399 --> 03:33:52.663]  I mean, they were back here pulling my arm, trying to get me to tell them my morning bone broth milkshake formula.
[03:33:52.703 --> 03:33:56.045]  So I will tell you, I start every day with a Caveman milkshake.
[03:33:56.545 --> 03:33:57.866]  It's a scoop and a half of caveman.
[03:33:57.906 --> 03:33:59.286]  I go a little above, okay?
[03:33:59.326 --> 03:34:00.387]  I'm kind of a true caveman.
[03:34:00.407 --> 03:34:01.427]  I need a little more, perhaps.
[03:34:02.008 --> 03:34:15.114]  So I do a scoop and a half of caveman, two scoops peanut butter, two scoops cold milled flask, two bananas, and just about, I don't know how many cups, probably about three cups of chocolate almond milk.
[03:34:15.754 --> 03:34:17.075]  And then you're set.
[03:34:17.535 --> 03:34:18.556]  You're good to go for the day.
[03:34:18.796 --> 03:34:22.498]  And listen to all these nutrients that are in the bone broth that you're not getting.
[03:34:23.098 --> 03:34:27.661]  Most likely, most people do not get these nutrients in their everyday diet.
[03:34:27.701 --> 03:34:31.143]  Turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and bone broth.
[03:34:31.223 --> 03:34:34.946]  Those are four super nutrients that most people are not getting with their diets.
[03:34:35.286 --> 03:34:37.267]  Caveman knocks out all of those.
[03:34:37.667 --> 03:34:42.190]  You take it every morning, you just got those super nutrients for the day and you are good to go.
[03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:45.172]  Here's the review of the day from Mojo Rising.
[03:34:46.081 --> 03:34:48.062]  I use milk when I have Caveman.
[03:34:48.102 --> 03:34:49.023]  Tastes like a milkshake.
[03:34:49.063 --> 03:34:50.724]  I use this product after my workouts.
[03:34:50.784 --> 03:34:52.305]  Just ordered another two-pack.
[03:34:52.706 --> 03:34:53.586]  A great product.
[03:34:54.107 --> 03:34:54.687]  Caveman.
[03:34:55.668 --> 03:34:59.210]  Yeah, you can use this for a post-workout protein as well.
[03:34:59.851 --> 03:35:04.994]  Or, if you're me, use it for your morning shake with a couple bananas, some peanut butter, and some Flax.
[03:35:06.374 --> 03:35:09.116]  It's good to go, but Bone Broth right now, take advantage of the special.
[03:35:09.137 --> 03:35:10.278]  53% off.
[03:35:10.718 --> 03:35:16.043]  That is an absurd special, so buy four of them before that deal is gone.
[03:35:16.683 --> 03:35:25.531]  Now, if you're going to be out in Berkeley, you might want some caveman, because you might have to try to caveman up on some of these Antifa fascists.
[03:35:26.613 --> 03:35:27.773]  In fact, that's what they are.
[03:35:28.173 --> 03:35:28.913]  That's what we should call them.
[03:35:28.933 --> 03:35:32.074]  Instead of just Antifa, it's the Antifa fascists.
[03:35:32.574 --> 03:35:35.615]  So, they've had Milo events cancelled.
[03:35:35.995 --> 03:35:37.895]  They've had Ann Coulter events cancelled.
[03:35:37.915 --> 03:35:40.856]  These are the domestic terrorists, by the way, that are winning.
[03:35:42.956 --> 03:35:44.956]  Where's Donald Trump, by the way?
[03:35:46.537 --> 03:35:52.078]  Excuse me, but free speech is an important issue in this country, in case you didn't notice.
[03:35:52.558 --> 03:35:54.078]  It's the First Amendment.
[03:35:55.054 --> 03:35:58.815]  Number one, it's under attack, President Trump.
[03:35:59.155 --> 03:35:59.955]  Where are you?
[03:35:59.975 --> 03:36:04.397]  Ivanka, why are you thinking about Syrian children?
[03:36:04.437 --> 03:36:05.497]  It's very heartbreaking.
[03:36:05.897 --> 03:36:07.798]  We're all very sad, okay?
[03:36:08.558 --> 03:36:09.538]  But guess what?
[03:36:10.058 --> 03:36:11.919]  You're not the president of Syria.
[03:36:13.239 --> 03:36:15.480]  You're not the ambassador to Syria.
[03:36:17.380 --> 03:36:23.582]  You work for the United States of America, and free speech is under attack right now.
[03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:31.387]  I was thinking about this, and I'm going to talk about this tonight on the Nightly News, but every media outlet in America...
[03:36:32.347 --> 03:36:44.170]  Every politician in America, and to be honest with you, probably every citizen, but we'll stop at every politician, should be outraged and speaking out about what is going on in Berkeley right now.
[03:36:44.490 --> 03:36:52.073]  It doesn't matter if you're a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green Party, Left, Right, Up, Down, Yellow, Brown, it doesn't matter.
[03:36:52.093 --> 03:37:00.015]  This is free speech under attack in America, and we have media outlets that aren't even reporting on it.
[03:37:01.002 --> 03:37:04.786]  Or, even worse, that are justifying it.
[03:37:07.169 --> 03:37:07.950]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:37:09.531 --> 03:37:16.599]  As somebody that likes free speech, as somebody that likes the ability to go out on the street and speak my mind and have a conversation with somebody,
[03:37:17.691 --> 03:37:18.151]  You know what?
[03:37:18.191 --> 03:37:22.595]  Yeah, it really grinds my gears when I see that free speech is under attack.
[03:37:22.836 --> 03:37:26.039]  When I see that Ann Coulter, Ann Coulter!
[03:37:26.059 --> 03:37:29.682]  Look, if you want to say that Milo is offensive, and you know what?
[03:37:29.902 --> 03:37:30.803]  Fine, okay, fine.
[03:37:31.303 --> 03:37:33.525]  I hate that, that's ridiculous, but I'll give you a pass there.
[03:37:33.686 --> 03:37:34.366]  Ann Coulter?
[03:37:34.746 --> 03:37:36.048]  What has Ann Coulter ever done?
[03:37:38.117 --> 03:37:41.798]  What is the meanest thing that Ann Coulter, what is the most offensive thing that Ann Coulter has ever said?
[03:37:41.878 --> 03:37:42.038]  What?
[03:37:42.278 --> 03:37:45.179]  Predicting Trump would be president before anybody else and getting laughed at?
[03:37:45.399 --> 03:37:45.659]  Ho ho!
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:46.980]  We need to stop that!
[03:37:47.580 --> 03:37:48.080]  Oh no!
[03:37:48.420 --> 03:37:49.761]  Can't have Ann Coulter here!
[03:37:49.781 --> 03:37:54.502]  That's ANTIFA, which stands for anti-fascist.
[03:37:54.542 --> 03:37:58.343]  But see, here's the problem with ANTIFA, they didn't go to class, did they?
[03:37:58.704 --> 03:38:03.585]  They're probably all college dropouts, they never went to class in high school, so they didn't study history.
[03:38:04.806 --> 03:38:05.706]  They didn't study history.
[03:38:06.701 --> 03:38:09.623]  They don't realize that they're actually behaving like fascists.
[03:38:09.963 --> 03:38:31.456]  And again, every media outlet from CNN to Infowars, from Huffington Post to Breitbart, should have this as the, as, I mean, I understand, you know, we're in a cold world war right now, but still, as far as domestic news is concerned, I understand we all want taxes, I understand people are obsessed with the wall, okay?
[03:38:31.857 --> 03:38:33.838]  But free speech is under attack, folks.
[03:38:36.308 --> 03:38:37.328]  What do you think would have happened?
[03:38:37.368 --> 03:38:39.269]  In fact, it's probably still going to happen.
[03:38:39.709 --> 03:38:43.790]  But what do you think would have happened if Ann Coulter would have had her event tonight?
[03:38:43.810 --> 03:38:46.390]  Would it have been the same thing that happened at the Milo event?
[03:38:46.651 --> 03:38:47.031]  Burning?
[03:38:48.391 --> 03:38:49.071]  Breaking things?
[03:38:50.572 --> 03:38:51.152]  A whole scene?
[03:38:51.952 --> 03:38:57.373]  Terrorists roaming in the street, covering their faces, throwing fireworks, smashing windows?
[03:38:59.054 --> 03:38:59.914]  Great work, Berkeley.
[03:39:01.274 --> 03:39:04.475]  The center of free speech, isn't it?
[03:39:05.674 --> 03:39:10.158]  Where free speech apparently was a bastion of free speech, UC Berkeley.
[03:39:10.578 --> 03:39:11.579]  No.
[03:39:11.779 --> 03:39:12.900]  But it's not just Berkeley.
[03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:17.644]  Portland Rose Parade cancelled after anti-fascists threatened GOP marchers.
[03:39:19.826 --> 03:39:21.487]  Explain to me how this is not terrorism.
[03:39:22.228 --> 03:39:22.929]  I'd like to hear that.
[03:39:24.210 --> 03:39:31.316]  I'd like to hear Robert Reash explain to me how this is not terrorism.
[03:39:33.146 --> 03:39:35.508]  Threatening violence for a political purpose.
[03:39:36.209 --> 03:39:36.889]  Terrorism.
[03:39:38.050 --> 03:39:42.253]  Portland Rose Parade cancelled after anti-fascists threatened GOP marchers.
[03:39:43.954 --> 03:39:44.594]  Terrorists.
[03:39:46.896 --> 03:39:53.781]  If you replace the term anti-fascists in all of these stories with terrorists, it still makes sense.
[03:39:54.721 --> 03:39:55.281]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:39:55.641 --> 03:40:00.684]  Organizers cancel 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade after protesters threaten to shut it down.
[03:40:01.044 --> 03:40:01.744]  Wait a second!
[03:40:01.784 --> 03:40:02.585]  Hold on, guys!
[03:40:03.365 --> 03:40:04.265]  Go down in this story.
[03:40:04.345 --> 03:40:04.906]  I didn't realize that.
[03:40:04.946 --> 03:40:05.826]  Pull that story back up.
[03:40:07.207 --> 03:40:10.128]  I'm not from Oregon, okay?
[03:40:11.389 --> 03:40:12.709]  Is this a Chinese festival?
[03:40:12.749 --> 03:40:13.630]  Does anybody actually know?
[03:40:14.642 --> 03:40:16.243]  Is this like a Chinese Heritage Festival?
[03:40:16.263 --> 03:40:23.265]  The pictures that I'm seeing right now appear to be, uh, there seems to be some Asian influence there, but okay, now they're showing me more pictures, perhaps.
[03:40:23.665 --> 03:40:24.826]  Now there's some more, it looks like.
[03:40:25.506 --> 03:40:28.187]  So I don't really know, but it looks like a multicultural event.
[03:40:29.047 --> 03:40:30.248]  So this is actually racist.
[03:40:32.829 --> 03:40:33.129]  Okay.
[03:40:34.029 --> 03:40:39.011]  So because the GOP wants to have marchers in this multicultural parade,
[03:40:40.094 --> 03:40:44.217]  They're going to shut it down because the anti-fascists are going to attack the GOP marchers.
[03:40:44.257 --> 03:40:44.998]  So you see this?
[03:40:46.579 --> 03:40:49.461]  Again, where is the President?
[03:40:49.541 --> 03:40:50.442]  Where is Trump?
[03:40:52.884 --> 03:40:57.007]  I mean, again, this is domestic terrorism here.
[03:40:58.308 --> 03:41:01.210]  These are people threatening violence for a political purpose.
[03:41:02.771 --> 03:41:03.131]  Nothing.
[03:41:04.553 --> 03:41:04.893]  Nothing.
[03:41:06.667 --> 03:41:11.630]  We've got people that we're actually looking at as suspected terrorists.
[03:41:12.151 --> 03:41:16.254]  I'm imagining radical Islamic terrorists in 50 states.
[03:41:17.154 --> 03:41:30.483]  We're looking at people in 50 states right now because they could become radicalized terrorists, but we're ignoring the terrorists that are roaming the streets in Berkeley, California and apparently in Portland, Oregon.
[03:41:30.904 --> 03:41:32.445]  We're ignoring those terrorists, aren't we?
[03:41:34.178 --> 03:41:42.822]  And then these same people, see, these are the same people they want to bitch about American privilege when it's their American privilege that allows them to go be terrorists in the streets.
[03:41:44.403 --> 03:41:45.084]  How do you like that?
[03:41:47.525 --> 03:41:48.125]  Let me ask you this.
[03:41:50.846 --> 03:41:53.248]  If instead of
[03:41:54.358 --> 03:42:02.465]  Mostly white college-age men that dropped out of college and don't have a job and live with their parents that make up the Antifa party.
[03:42:03.146 --> 03:42:16.878]  Let's just say instead it was the same aged men except they were from Middle Eastern descent and they were Muslim and they chanted Allahu Akbar while they shut down free speech in America.
[03:42:17.139 --> 03:42:18.500]  How do you think that would go over?
[03:42:20.237 --> 03:42:23.239]  Oh my goodness, well, we'd be right on top of that now, wouldn't we?
[03:42:23.519 --> 03:42:24.860]  That would be the biggest issue!
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:26.802]  That would be terrorists on our streets!
[03:42:28.543 --> 03:42:29.744]  Well, they're already there.
[03:42:31.405 --> 03:42:38.430]  They might not be wearing a hijab, they might not be having the typical Muslim beard, but they're out there!
[03:42:39.211 --> 03:42:44.695]  They might not be chanting Allahu Akbar, they might not be shooting people yet, but they're out there!
[03:42:45.755 --> 03:42:47.076]  They're shutting down free speech!
[03:42:47.397 --> 03:42:48.838]  They are political terrorists!
[03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:52.330]  Why do they get to operate?
[03:42:55.132 --> 03:42:58.154]  It's the same old question.
[03:42:59.355 --> 03:43:00.796]  Imagine if it was the other way around.
[03:43:02.057 --> 03:43:08.883]  Imagine if it was Trump supporters that if Hillary Clinton, I mean what, Chelsea Clinton just received another award.
[03:43:08.943 --> 03:43:09.784]  Are you even aware of this?
[03:43:10.064 --> 03:43:14.267]  Chelsea Clinton is receiving awards hand over fist for what nobody knows.
[03:43:14.867 --> 03:43:16.409]  Chelsea Clinton just received another award.
[03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:18.871]  Imagine if the alt-right
[03:43:20.043 --> 03:43:23.005]  Or Breitbart supporters, or InfoWarriors.
[03:43:23.405 --> 03:43:25.987]  We're out at Chelsea Clinton's event protesting.
[03:43:26.067 --> 03:43:26.547]  There you go!
[03:43:27.228 --> 03:43:29.529]  Chelsea Clinton gets another award for doing nothing!
[03:43:31.170 --> 03:43:35.833]  She has to be the most awarded nothing in the history of the world.
[03:43:35.873 --> 03:43:39.775]  I mean... For real, what has she done?
[03:43:42.937 --> 03:43:45.199]  Did they... They may have actually...
[03:43:46.195 --> 03:43:49.236]  They may have designed the donkey from Shrek after her.
[03:43:49.556 --> 03:43:52.156]  The donkey from Shrek may have been inspired by Chelsea Clinton.
[03:43:52.756 --> 03:43:54.077]  So she might have that going for her.
[03:43:54.457 --> 03:43:55.777]  But so she gets another award.
[03:43:56.197 --> 03:43:58.758]  If we were out there protesting, it would be an uproar.
[03:43:59.058 --> 03:44:01.118]  MSNBC would be throwing fits.
[03:44:01.498 --> 03:44:03.859]  CNN's Van Jones would be calling it a whitelash.
[03:44:05.719 --> 03:44:14.361]  But when it's the Antifa protesters, when it's liberals, when it's leftists, when you want to shut down conservative speech, that's okay.
[03:44:15.716 --> 03:44:19.038]  That just flies right by with CNN and the liberal media.
[03:44:20.979 --> 03:44:21.939]  But just imagine, though.
[03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:23.260]  Just imagine.
[03:44:24.020 --> 03:44:28.642]  If you added a beard and a hijab to those Antifa marchers, how would you think of it?
[03:44:29.383 --> 03:44:30.123]  How would that look?
[03:44:30.744 --> 03:44:31.544]  Same activity!
[03:44:32.144 --> 03:44:33.585]  You don't have to change the activity.
[03:44:33.625 --> 03:44:35.126]  They're already burning stuff down.
[03:44:35.346 --> 03:44:36.386]  They're already rioting.
[03:44:37.307 --> 03:44:39.548]  Just put them in some Middle Eastern garb.
[03:44:39.608 --> 03:44:40.528]  See how that would go over.
[03:44:41.629 --> 03:44:43.810]  How much do you want to bet they would be arrested immediately?
[03:44:45.461 --> 03:44:49.285]  Oh, but because of their American privilege that they have a big problem with, they get to go out and do it.
[03:44:49.545 --> 03:44:50.126]  How do you like that?
[03:44:50.647 --> 03:44:59.856]  So the very American privilege that they bitch and moan about is the very privilege that's actually keeping them all from being arrested and put in jail where they belong!
[03:45:01.478 --> 03:45:02.059]  But that's fine.
[03:45:02.079 --> 03:45:03.780]  Their time is coming to an end, folks.
[03:45:04.141 --> 03:45:04.942]  It's not gonna last.
[03:45:06.755 --> 03:45:10.239]  But, the war on Fox is not stopping.
[03:45:10.579 --> 03:45:15.584]  Lawyer who represented O'Reilly's hot chocolate accuser is now targeting Jesse Waters.
[03:45:16.085 --> 03:45:25.795]  And the sad thing about this, folks... Yeah, Lisa Bloom... Yeah, you're real good for society, Lisa Bloom.
[03:45:26.621 --> 03:45:33.566]  But the interesting thing about this is all they have to do is just put this into the mainstream talking points.
[03:45:34.247 --> 03:45:35.208]  It doesn't even matter.
[03:45:35.288 --> 03:45:41.172]  Jesse Watters could have not even harmed or talked to a fly, but all they have to do is push this out there.
[03:45:41.552 --> 03:45:46.756]  All the liberal attorneys have to do is push this story out there, and then it's in the narrative.
[03:45:47.397 --> 03:45:48.077]  Then it's out there.
[03:45:48.358 --> 03:45:50.539]  And then it becomes the echo chamber of the left.
[03:45:50.819 --> 03:45:52.000]  I couldn't even believe
[03:45:54.013 --> 03:45:56.976]  All the liberals on Twitter I saw blowing up about this.
[03:45:57.576 --> 03:45:58.357]  Oh, it's Fox!
[03:45:58.397 --> 03:45:59.698]  Sexual harassment, Fox!
[03:46:00.098 --> 03:46:02.040]  Oh, there are white men at Fox!
[03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:02.700]  This, that, and the other thing.
[03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:05.403]  And I'm just sitting here scratching my head like, you really don't get it, do you?
[03:46:06.784 --> 03:46:07.605]  You really don't get it.
[03:46:07.945 --> 03:46:10.527]  This has nothing to do with sexual harassment at Fox.
[03:46:11.088 --> 03:46:14.671]  This has to do with silencing conservative news!
[03:46:16.291 --> 03:46:21.155]  But see, you wouldn't get that because according to these brainwashed liberals, we live in a rape culture already.
[03:46:22.076 --> 03:46:23.838]  But here's the point I keep bringing up anyway.
[03:46:25.359 --> 03:46:33.306]  Are you really that naive that you think sexual harassment, this sexual harassment, is only going on at Fox?
[03:46:34.307 --> 03:46:35.668]  Are you really that naive?
[03:46:36.088 --> 03:46:40.412]  Of all of the big news corporations out there, it's only happening at Fox?
[03:46:41.113 --> 03:46:42.194]  Fox is the only one?
[03:46:44.411 --> 03:46:49.153]  I mean, it might not be, you know, Bill O'Reilly calling a woman hot chocolate.
[03:46:49.374 --> 03:46:57.798]  Maybe at CNN it's, you know, Jake Tapper making a little remark towards Anderson Cooper in the kitchen, if you catch my drift with that one.
[03:46:58.158 --> 03:46:59.819]  You know, maybe a little tie joke.
[03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:02.580]  But this goes on, okay?
[03:47:02.841 --> 03:47:05.722]  But they're pointing at Fox, because don't you see?
[03:47:06.763 --> 03:47:09.004]  Well, Fox probably helped Trump get in.
[03:47:09.864 --> 03:47:10.985]  So we have to stop Fox.
[03:47:12.250 --> 03:47:17.291]  We can't be letting these conservatives on Fox determine the outcome of a U.S.
[03:47:17.352 --> 03:47:17.832]  election.
[03:47:17.852 --> 03:47:22.293]  I mean, God forbid that Americans actually determine their own election.
[03:47:22.833 --> 03:47:26.014]  And while they just did, we're going to blame Russia anyway.
[03:47:27.414 --> 03:47:28.735]  But we'll get to more on that in a minute.
[03:47:29.673 --> 03:47:32.814]  But here you go, they want to point out, actually we'll get to this right now.
[03:47:33.334 --> 03:47:35.855]  They're going to point out collusion all day long, right?
[03:47:36.255 --> 03:47:41.117]  Trump-Russia, Flynn-Russia, Russia-Russia, collusion-collusion, we'll find the collusion.
[03:47:41.437 --> 03:47:45.358]  Maxine Waters is going to be digging for years until she finds some collusion.
[03:47:45.398 --> 03:47:46.939]  She will find it, she promises you.
[03:47:47.859 --> 03:47:51.260]  She may find her a new wig before that.
[03:47:51.941 --> 03:47:52.961]  But here's the collusion.
[03:47:54.061 --> 03:47:55.102]  You want to talk collusion?
[03:47:56.078 --> 03:48:05.564]  Meanwhile, with zero actual proof of Russia-Trump collusion, at least in the aspect of trying to win the election, Russia trying to win Trump the election, here's the real collusion, folks.
[03:48:05.884 --> 03:48:11.008]  And here's the lingering presidency of Barack Obama, just lingering.
[03:48:11.908 --> 03:48:17.011]  Sanctuary City's fight, judge who blocked Trump order, a Democrat activist.
[03:48:18.112 --> 03:48:19.033]  How do you like that?
[03:48:19.853 --> 03:48:23.756]  So you've got an Obama judge, a liberal judge, a Democrat,
[03:48:25.370 --> 03:48:28.172]  Who is now blocking the President.
[03:48:28.993 --> 03:48:32.215]  Did you elect Judge William Orrick III?
[03:48:33.316 --> 03:48:35.577]  Did you vote for Judge William Orrick III?
[03:48:36.758 --> 03:48:37.458]  I'll do you one better.
[03:48:37.799 --> 03:48:41.141]  Have you ever heard of Judge William Orrick III?
[03:48:43.162 --> 03:48:43.923]  Let me tell you.
[03:48:45.464 --> 03:48:48.586]  My name is John William Orrick III.
[03:48:50.464 --> 03:48:56.629]  And even though I was not elected by the American people, I am more important than Donald Trump.
[03:48:57.910 --> 03:49:11.640]  And if Donald Trump thinks that he can pass this racist legislation against sanctuary cities, I, Judge William Orrick III, 63 years old, I will strike that down.
[03:49:16.445 --> 03:49:17.545]  Because don't you see?
[03:49:19.086 --> 03:49:26.547]  I, Judge William Orrick III, am actually not the judge in the United States of America you think I am.
[03:49:26.827 --> 03:49:30.588]  No, I am a judge for non-citizens.
[03:49:31.768 --> 03:49:36.629]  Yes, my paycheck is paid for by the U.S.
[03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:45.771]  taxpayer, but I, Judge William Orrick III, have instead the non-citizen in mind.
[03:49:47.267 --> 03:49:54.711]  So now, you will pay me, Judge William Orrick III, and I will fight for the non-citizen.
[03:49:55.291 --> 03:49:57.712]  Because that's how I work.
[03:49:58.373 --> 03:50:10.999]  I am a liberal judge, Judge William Orrick III, and quite simply, to me, a non-citizen is more important than a citizen.
[03:50:12.415 --> 03:50:16.557]  A non-citizen's right is more important than a citizen's right.
[03:50:17.137 --> 03:50:23.160]  And if you disagree with me, or if you like President Trump, you are a racist.
[03:50:24.901 --> 03:50:28.883]  Because I, Judge William Orrick III, said so.
[03:50:32.076 --> 03:50:32.837]  There I am.
[03:50:33.417 --> 03:50:42.164]  My tie has been tied a little too tight for the last 20 years, but that's okay, because I am a liberal judge.
[03:50:43.625 --> 03:50:52.431]  We're going to liberalize this country, and we are going to take a stand for non-citizens, even though citizens pay me, and they don't want this stand.
[03:50:53.192 --> 03:50:59.757]  I'm Judge William Orrick III, and I am a liberal judge that is clueless on what the American people actually want.
[03:51:05.308 --> 03:51:06.129]  Lee Stranahan.
[03:51:06.369 --> 03:51:08.331]  Lee Stranahan was formerly with Breitbart.
[03:51:08.751 --> 03:51:10.013]  He knew Andrew Breitbart.
[03:51:10.033 --> 03:51:11.734]  He also knows Steve Bannon.
[03:51:12.075 --> 03:51:14.337]  He is now the editor of ThePopulous.us.
[03:51:14.377 --> 03:51:16.719]  He's a co-host on Fault Lines on Sputnik.
[03:51:17.320 --> 03:51:20.022]  And he has a citizen journalism school.
[03:51:20.042 --> 03:51:22.705]  You'll find that at citizenjournalismschool.com.
[03:51:22.725 --> 03:51:29.251]  But let's talk about the outsourcing of censorship first and the demonizing of individual sources, Lee.
[03:51:29.531 --> 03:51:31.952]  I don't like the term fake news, okay?
[03:51:32.032 --> 03:51:38.754]  There is such a thing as fake news, but the bigger problem, I think, is what I call narrative-driven news, which is this.
[03:51:38.834 --> 03:51:40.094]  Let's take a simple issue.
[03:51:40.134 --> 03:51:41.474]  I'm going to give just an example.
[03:51:42.234 --> 03:51:43.615]  Let's say immigration, okay?
[03:51:43.975 --> 03:51:47.576]  Now, let's say you've got two stories, and they're both completely true.
[03:51:48.416 --> 03:51:53.938]  One story is about a woman who came here illegally, and she's got three kids.
[03:51:54.038 --> 03:51:58.579]  She, you know, has worked for 20 years, but she's here illegally, and she's getting deported.
[03:51:59.259 --> 03:52:05.503]  The second story is about a woman whose child was killed by an illegal alien who'd been deported three times.
[03:52:06.284 --> 03:52:06.944]  Okay?
[03:52:06.984 --> 03:52:10.606]  Now assume both of those stories are completely true, because those things both happened.
[03:52:10.687 --> 03:52:11.407]  Does that make sense?
[03:52:12.087 --> 03:52:12.308]  Right.
[03:52:12.948 --> 03:52:14.689]  Which story is CNN going to cover?
[03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.650]  Right?
[03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.210]  Yes.
[03:52:16.470 --> 03:52:18.331]  The deportation story of the victim.
[03:52:18.411 --> 03:52:18.592]  Yeah.
[03:52:19.828 --> 03:52:21.649]  And which stories is Breitbart going to cover?
[03:52:21.669 --> 03:52:23.670]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:52:24.391 --> 03:52:34.617]  So my point here is that what they don't like about sites like InfoWars is that you guys cover stories that are outside their narrative.
[03:52:34.997 --> 03:52:36.838]  You're outside their normal lane.
[03:52:37.018 --> 03:52:41.140]  To me, the issue is, are people going to be honest with you about what their bias is?
[03:52:41.200 --> 03:52:42.161]  Everybody's got a bias.
[03:52:42.481 --> 03:52:47.567]  And always in the past we would see the same stories put out by ABC, CBS, NBC.
[03:52:47.607 --> 03:52:50.710]  They would all choose to report the same stories and they would have the same angle.
[03:52:51.210 --> 03:52:54.914]  Now we have people who are coming out with a different narrative.
[03:52:54.994 --> 03:52:57.017]  We report the facts and we analyze the facts.
[03:52:57.377 --> 03:53:01.762]  CNN reports the facts, they analyze the facts, but they tell you that their facts are the only facts.
[03:53:02.182 --> 03:53:03.424]  People can make up their own minds.
[03:53:03.444 --> 03:53:04.385]  And people can figure it out.
[03:53:04.405 --> 03:53:05.125]  You can, I can, David.
[03:53:05.145 --> 03:53:06.367]  All of the audience can.
[03:53:06.387 --> 03:53:07.408]  I can look at a New York Times story.
[03:53:24.566 --> 03:53:25.927]  And I know what their bias is.
[03:53:26.447 --> 03:53:27.528]  And I can filter that in.
[03:53:27.608 --> 03:53:30.910]  I can look at an Infowars story and I know where it comes from.
[03:53:30.930 --> 03:53:32.390]  And I can filter that out.
[03:53:32.470 --> 03:53:34.231]  And I can make up my own damn mind.
[03:53:34.792 --> 03:53:35.952]  That's what's scary to them.
[03:53:36.472 --> 03:53:39.074]  They're frightened to death that we can make up our own minds.
[03:53:39.414 --> 03:53:43.716]  And the wake-up call for them was Donald Trump being elected.
[03:53:43.736 --> 03:53:47.238]  Because whatever you thought about Donald Trump, he wasn't supposed to win, right?
[03:53:47.258 --> 03:53:48.599]  He was supposed to lose.
[03:53:49.219 --> 03:53:52.381]  And that's when they realized the genie's out of the bottle.
[03:53:53.062 --> 03:53:54.806]  And they can no longer control us.
[03:53:56.992 --> 03:54:00.842]  It's almost like there's an info war going on.
[03:54:08.917 --> 03:54:11.960]  So, the Democrats are colluding right now.
[03:54:12.781 --> 03:54:13.762]  Not Trump and Russia.
[03:54:13.882 --> 03:54:21.149]  No, in fact, it's the Democrats who are colluding against President Trump, against President Trump's agenda, which is actually our agenda.
[03:54:21.169 --> 03:54:26.594]  So we've got Democrats and judges colluding against the Republic, colluding against the American people.
[03:54:27.515 --> 03:54:40.317]  They ought to be, well they probably ought to be fired, but honestly maybe even, I mean I don't know, you'd have to look into some different litigation techniques here, but they could even be jailable at this point.
[03:54:40.937 --> 03:54:42.358]  Because you're putting people in danger.
[03:54:42.978 --> 03:54:54.040]  Who's going to be held responsible if these Democrats continue to collude to keep borders open and to keep sanctuary cities funded and alive and well when these
[03:54:55.160 --> 03:55:00.066]  If a non-citizen murders somebody in a sanctuary city, who do you hold accountable?
[03:55:00.667 --> 03:55:02.289]  How about Judge William Orr III?
[03:55:03.371 --> 03:55:05.133]  He's fighting for these sanctuary cities.
[03:55:05.474 --> 03:55:06.715]  Someone ought to be held accountable.
[03:55:07.036 --> 03:55:11.662]  But meanwhile, as the Democrats are colluding here against the Republic in America,
[03:55:13.322 --> 03:55:19.944]  Perhaps what I'm dubbing a cold world war has started or war chicken has started.
[03:55:20.584 --> 03:55:28.867]  Let's finish off the show today just covering some of these headlines that developed after I cut the hot topic talking about all the headlines that developed over the week.
[03:55:30.208 --> 03:55:36.370]  US pressure could force Britain to join anti-Assad airstrikes suggests Boris Johnson.
[03:55:36.450 --> 03:55:39.251]  So now you're looking at the UK.
[03:55:40.894 --> 03:55:42.135]  Joining the U.S.
[03:55:42.715 --> 03:55:44.495]  in bringing down Assad.
[03:55:44.515 --> 03:55:50.998]  It's funny, I don't hear the Democrats colluding, or the Democrats crying collusion on that, do you?
[03:55:52.318 --> 03:56:00.542]  You don't hear the Democrats crying about the United States meddling in Syrian politics, do you?
[03:56:00.782 --> 03:56:02.603]  With all the proof in the world in front of their face.
[03:56:02.703 --> 03:56:05.564]  No, with no proof they want to complain about Russia meddling in our politics.
[03:56:05.944 --> 03:56:08.605]  Even though there's more proof of Hillary and the Democrats doing that than Russia.
[03:56:09.591 --> 03:56:17.800]  No, this is the world I live in now, where we're now colluding, in fact, with the UK or Britain to try to take Assad out.
[03:56:18.241 --> 03:56:19.402]  But the Democrats are silent.
[03:56:20.723 --> 03:56:21.705]  Democrats are silent.
[03:56:21.745 --> 03:56:23.667]  In fact, everyone was silent on this.
[03:56:24.548 --> 03:56:26.930]  Israel strikes Damascus airport today.
[03:56:28.572 --> 03:56:30.634]  Didn't hear anybody reporting this.
[03:56:31.770 --> 03:56:33.613]  On American television news, nothing.
[03:56:34.253 --> 03:56:41.603]  An Israeli missile strike has caused a large explosion and a fire at a military site near Damascus International Airport.
[03:56:42.044 --> 03:56:43.285]  Syrian State Media reports.
[03:56:44.480 --> 03:56:46.541]  And this report surfaced around.
[03:56:47.162 --> 03:56:47.902]  So that's nice.
[03:56:47.942 --> 03:56:48.503]  The U.S.
[03:56:48.583 --> 03:56:50.724]  is trying to work in regime change in Syria.
[03:56:50.844 --> 03:56:53.886]  Israel is trying to work in a regime change in Syria.
[03:56:53.946 --> 03:56:57.048]  Now they're trying to pressure Britain and probably other members of the U.K.
[03:56:57.068 --> 03:56:59.930]  and Europe to get involved in this regime change as well.
[03:57:00.470 --> 03:57:05.053]  And this is just part of the overall geopolitical Cold War war that's being built.
[03:57:05.873 --> 03:57:11.417]  But the Democrats don't care because they're still all looking up each other's rear ends for Russia collusion.
[03:57:12.557 --> 03:57:13.257]  Yes, that's great.
[03:57:13.277 --> 03:57:15.418]  Let's pile drive through a couple more of these headlines.
[03:57:15.938 --> 03:57:18.739]  North Korea loses millions under pressure from China.
[03:57:19.239 --> 03:57:29.963]  So this is more of what people are going to suspect is a result of Trump's brinksmanship and Trump making deals with China to try to help remove the North Korean dictator.
[03:57:29.983 --> 03:57:31.304]  And now North Korea is losing
[03:57:31.624 --> 03:57:32.224]  Cold deals.
[03:57:32.244 --> 03:57:34.245]  I think they're being hit with gas deals now too.
[03:57:34.725 --> 03:57:37.785]  And they're losing millions under pressure from China.
[03:57:37.845 --> 03:57:39.806]  North Korea strikes White House in new video.
[03:57:39.826 --> 03:57:43.066]  So we already had the video of them apparently launching a strike onto America.
[03:57:43.126 --> 03:57:46.347]  Now they got a new one hitting the White House.
[03:57:46.407 --> 03:57:47.387]  How sweet is that?
[03:57:47.447 --> 03:57:50.888]  That's very nice that North Korea would do that.
[03:57:51.228 --> 03:57:53.588]  China to conduct live fire drills.
[03:57:53.828 --> 03:57:56.709]  Test new weapons in response to THAAD.
[03:57:57.702 --> 03:57:58.503]  Hmm, that's nice.
[03:57:58.543 --> 03:57:59.683]  So you got that going too.
[03:58:00.064 --> 03:58:00.324]  U.S.
[03:58:00.364 --> 03:58:02.125]  Marines deploy a robot.
[03:58:02.285 --> 03:58:04.507]  A marine robot they're testing now too.
[03:58:04.827 --> 03:58:05.487]  So how do you like that?
[03:58:05.547 --> 03:58:06.688]  All these war games are building.
[03:58:07.048 --> 03:58:08.329]  Folks, please support us.
