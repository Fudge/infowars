[00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.697]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:22.299]  It's Friday, June 23, 2017.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.561]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:25.723]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:28.966]  Tonight!
[00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:35.614]  The explosive lawsuit that DNC does not want you to see.
[00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:51.480]  The establishment Democrats prepare to defend themselves in the courtroom where a case is being heard about election fraud coordinated by the Hillary campaign to rig the election against Bernie Sanders.
[00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.342]  Owen Schroyer talks to Harvard law expert Jared Beck
[00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:00.703]  About the class action lawsuit and the Clinton body count.
[00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:05.244]  Then, Trump needs your help to drain the swamp.
[00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:11.186]  And that's why Paul Nealon needs your vote to take out Paul Ryan.
[00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:17.007]  All that plus the deep state plans for the second civil war in America.
[00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:20.868]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:27.304]  Yeah.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:07.368]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's the biggest story in America right now.
[00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:10.929]  It's the biggest headline on all publications right now.
[00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.892]  Loretta Lynch is now looking to get probed.
[00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:16.672]  That's right.
[00:03:17.052 --> 00:03:18.293]  There is a Senate
[00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.775]  Let's start off with ABC7.
[00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:52.735]  The group of Senate Judiciary Committee leaders is seeking details about Lynch's communications with a Clinton campaign aide, Amanda Renteria, as well as copies and information about whether the FBI investigated the alleged communications.
[00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:56.188]  The Senators, this is key, right here.
[00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:14.698]  The Senators question Open Society Foundation's Leonard Bernardo and its General Counsel Gail Scovell, as well as Renteria and Lynch about a May 24 story in the Washington Post that reported Lynch assured Renteria that she would not let the investigation into Clinton go too far.
[00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.380]  Lynch, of course, declined to comment at the time.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.700]  She still declines to comment.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.802]  We've got videos of her declining to comment constantly.
[00:04:22.222 --> 00:04:25.065]  Let's go back to the Open Society Foundations real quick.
[00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:31.252]  You know who runs and founded the Open Society Foundation?
[00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.015]  George Soros.
[00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:40.001]  So isn't that nice that the George Soros funded
[00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:47.159]  Founded Open Society Foundation is going to be Involved in this probe.
[00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.460]  I like that.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:05:10.935]  Maybe they'll find something else about George Soros Maybe they'll find out that he's been colluding that he helped to interfere with some investigations He's been funding all these Democrats after all so that could be an interesting aspect to keep our eye on but let's go on an email recounting that alleged conversation and Authored by Debbie Wasserman Schultz who served at the time as the DNC chair was allegedly hacked by Russia
[00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:16.779]  And then the story says though the FBI later discounted its reliability.
[00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.681]  I'm curious what they mean by that.
[00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:24.824]  Are they saying that the FBI is discounting the reliability that it was Russia that hacked it?
[00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:26.605]  Because definitely that's the case.
[00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:30.408]  Or are they saying that the reliability that the email is genuine?
[00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:31.769]  Is discounted.
[00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.350]  Which, if that was the case, why are we still talking about it?
[00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.272]  No, because it is real and that is the case.
[00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:46.556]  So, it looks like Loretta Lynch is about to be next to have to give a testimony, the next big hearing on the Hill that there's going to have bars opening in DC early for.
[00:05:46.876 --> 00:05:56.941]  But isn't it amazing how they built up the Comey testimony, they built up the Sessions testimony, for some reason ignored the J Johnson testimony,
[00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:01.845]  But then now you're going to have the Loretta Lynch testimony, which is going to be the big bombshell.
[00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.766]  I think that this is the one that you're going to get the real bombshells out of.
[00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:10.288]  The other bombshells basically worked against them, not in the manner that they thought.
[00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.069]  They worked against Comey, and then Sessions was great.
[00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:14.969]  So I wonder how Loretta Lynch is going to do.
[00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.690]  We've got some videos that give us an idea.
[00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.171]  This is a story from CBS.
[00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.334]  Senators investigating former AG Loretta Lynch for political interference.
[00:06:21.794 --> 00:06:35.427]  Senators investigating Russia meddling in the 2016 election are now looking for more information about the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the Clinton email investigation, specifically now looking into Obama's Attorney General Loretta Lynch's alleged political interference.
[00:06:35.848 --> 00:06:39.591]  So we've had the months of the ongoing Russia investigation prove nothing.
[00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:47.360]  So now finally we're going to get investigation into where the real collusion is with Loretta Lynch and for some reason I think we're going to find something here.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:55.769]  The New York Times printed a report that the FBI had obtained hacked documents that included one about a Democrat operative who had expressed confidence that Ms.
[00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.292]  Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far.
[00:06:58.573 --> 00:06:59.954]  That's obstruction of justice folks!
[00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:01.798]  Right there from the Attorney General.
[00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:02.279]  Gotta love that.
[00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:10.818]  You've got the former FBI Director as a leaker, and you've got the former Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is guilty of obstruction of justice.
[00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:17.703]  If we can actually get that email to be considered legit, get that in front of a hearing, which is now what we're going to have.
[00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:23.866]  The press release says that Grassley requested a copy of the document from the Justice Department, which didn't respond.
[00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:24.566]  How convenient.
[00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:26.127]  Well, you're going to have to respond now, aren't you?
[00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:27.327]  NBC News.
[00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:31.148]  Senate investigates Loretta Lynch conduct during Clinton email probe.
[00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:32.209]  Exactly, folks.
[00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:35.490]  Clinton got caught red-handed and didn't get prosecuted.
[00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.491]  If that was anyone else, they would have gone to jail.
[00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:38.531]  Why didn't Clinton?
[00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.272]  Those are the questions we're going to have asked.
[00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.622]  This is from USA Today.
[00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:47.484]  Senators investigate whether Loretta Lynch tried to stifle Clinton email probe.
[00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:48.485]  Looks pretty obvious to me.
[00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:56.890]  A spokesman for Lynch said the former Attorney General will cooperate fully with this inquiry and respond directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.350]  Boy, I'd love to see that.
[00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:04.452]  I have a feeling, though, she's going to try to dodge, duck, dive, dip and dodge her way out of this deal.
[00:08:05.113 --> 00:08:10.555]  And then Robert Rabin, the spokesperson for Lynch, because she can't speak for herself, she's such a coward, says, Ms.
[00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:20.478]  Lynch is a committed public servant who has dedicated much of her career to the Department of Justice and led the department as Attorney General in the fair and impartial administration of justice.
[00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:26.961]  I have a feeling that Robert Rabin is going to eat those words for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:27.841]  Boy, that will be sweet.
[00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:31.883]  Grassley Feinstein wants answers from Loretta Lynch, the headline in Politico.
[00:08:32.123 --> 00:08:34.024]  And I love this headline.
[00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:50.011]  Now, Chuck Grassley has been an absolute dark knight, an absolute hero, going about this methodically, patiently, slowly crawling closer, etching closer to this day when he'll get these people on a stand and get all of America watching.
[00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:55.996]  But it's very key Feinstein is involved in this, and Feinstein is also going along with it too, wanting answers.
[00:08:56.417 --> 00:09:02.083]  Because if you'll notice, Dianne Feinstein, I said this a while ago, Dianne Feinstein has reigned herself back.
[00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.425]  Dianne Feinstein has reigned herself in.
[00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:08.369]  What we've seen is the madness of the Democrat Party showing itself.
[00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.013]  The Maxine Waters, the Nancy Pelosi's, the Chuck Schumer's, the crazies.
[00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:13.495]  The Tim Kaines.
[00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:14.155]  It goes on and on.
[00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:20.860]  But you notice, Dianne Feinstein, who was always at the head of that mix, always right there mixing it up, hasn't really been there much lately.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.942]  Hasn't really been that person.
[00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:24.823]  Hasn't been vocal about how bad Trump is.
[00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.664]  Now, of course, she has been.
[00:09:26.724 --> 00:09:27.825]  She's still a swamp member.
[00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.207]  Don't get me wrong, I'm not lionizing Dianne Feinstein.
[00:09:30.627 --> 00:09:38.333]  My point is, as we bring the letter here, this is the actual letter from the Senate letting Ms.
[00:09:38.373 --> 00:09:39.314]  Lynch know about
[00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:42.680]  The probe that is about to be ongoing.
[00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:45.043]  It's signed by Dianne Feinstein.
[00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:47.186]  Folks, I think she knew this was coming.
[00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:51.115]  I think this has been in the works for a long time.
[00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:55.756]  And I think Dianne Feinstein knew it was coming, and that's why she reined herself in.
[00:09:56.396 --> 00:10:01.777]  And that's why Dianne Feinstein has not been as vocal and as big of a swamp creature as we've seen in the past.
[00:10:02.157 --> 00:10:03.277]  I think she knew this was coming.
[00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:11.759]  And I think that she knows that the result is not going to be favorable towards Loretta Lynch, towards Hillary Clinton, towards James Comey.
[00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:19.901]  And that's why she decided to rein herself in and not be as loud mouth as she had been in the past.
[00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:21.642]  So that's another interesting angle.
[00:10:21.682 --> 00:10:25.923]  Now, here are the questions that they have addressed in this letter that they want answered.
[00:10:26.203 --> 00:10:33.045]  Did anyone from the FBI ever discuss or otherwise mention to you emails, memos or reports such as those described in these media reports?
[00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:33.866]  Great question.
[00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:34.806]  I wonder if Lynch will answer it.
[00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:39.609]  Are you aware of the existence of any email, memo, or report such as those described in the cited media reports?
[00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:42.530]  If so, when and how did you become aware of the document's existence?
[00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.093]  Did you have any reason to doubt the authenticity of this document?
[00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:55.678]  Again, just right there, she will have to admit that she's guilty of obstructing justice, or she'll say that this email is a fake email and then we'll have a whole other investigation.
[00:10:56.118 --> 00:10:59.041]  To the best of your knowledge, have you ever communicated with Amanda Renteria?
[00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.524]  If so, when and did you discuss the Clinton investigation?
[00:11:02.664 --> 00:11:05.767]  If so, please describe the communications and provide all records relating to them.
[00:11:06.428 --> 00:11:10.411]  I have a feeling that those records are getting smashed with a hammer and burned with a torch right now.
[00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:16.437]  To the best of your knowledge, did any of your Justice Department staff or your other associates communicate with Amanda Renteria?
[00:11:16.457 --> 00:11:17.258]  Excuse me, I just read that one.
[00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:26.482]  During your time in the Justice Department, did you ever have communications with Debbie Washman Schultz, her staff, her associates, or any other current or former DNC officials about the Clinton email investigation?
[00:11:26.922 --> 00:11:28.303]  If so, blah blah blah, it goes on.
[00:11:28.603 --> 00:11:38.767]  To the best of your knowledge, did any of your Justice Department staff or any other associates communicate with Debbie Washman Schultz and her staff or any other current or former DNC officials about the Clinton email investigation?
[00:11:38.807 --> 00:11:39.608]  If so, please describe.
[00:11:40.168 --> 00:11:40.368]  I'm good.
[00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:56.890]  Now, let's go to some video.
[00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.130]  Lynch has been on the Hill before.
[00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.051]  She's had to testify before, but she's never had this on her.
[00:12:02.091 --> 00:12:03.832]  She's never had the weight of this on her.
[00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:06.493]  She's never had the entire American public watching her.
[00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:07.873]  That's what she's got now.
[00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:11.014]  She's backed into a corner, and she might sing like a bird.
[00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.735]  She might not want to go down for Clinton.
[00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:19.357]  She might sing like a bird, so it'll be interesting, but this is what we've gotten from Lynch in the past, a bunch of nothing.
[00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:20.557]  Now, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:22.078]  I want to go back and play.
[00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:29.403]  The video of James Comey talking about what Loretta Lynch said to him as far as the Clinton email investigation.
[00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:41.972]  Probably the only other consideration, but I guess I can talk about an open setting, is at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me.
[00:12:42.272 --> 00:12:42.553]  Oh really?
[00:12:42.573 --> 00:12:49.538]  That was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.281]  Not to get back on grilling Comey, but really, it was so concerning to you, why didn't you have a leak?
[00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:56.962]  Why didn't you say anything?
[00:12:57.002 --> 00:13:13.706]  The Trump thing was so concerning, they made a big deal of that, but this Loretta Lynch thing, making it a matter, and then right there, I would say, in Comey's testimony, you already have Loretta Lynch interfering with this Clinton email investigation, that's obstruction of justice, I think right there, James Comey just indicted
[00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:15.507]  I never thought I'd say this.
[00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:18.551]  I actually, and I say this with due respect, Attorney General, I miss Eric Holder.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.782]  Because at least when he came here, he gave his answer.
[00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:38.503]  We didn't like it.
[00:13:39.343 --> 00:13:46.471]  But I've spent the last four hours listening to basically the Attorney General of the United States not willing to make a concrete statement of law.
[00:13:46.772 --> 00:13:47.172]  Of course not.
[00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:48.073]  She knows you're the daughter of a guilty.
[00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:53.279]  To not be willing to say that when given the opportunity by a colleague of mine, who made the decision?
[00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.710]  Talk about the Clinton email investigation.
[00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:15.746]  Congressman, as I've stated, I made the decision and I do accept, I did accept it and therefore I made the decision to accept that recommendation.
[00:14:15.806 --> 00:14:17.087]  That was the action that I took.
[00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:20.168]  The problem that we're having here though is you took a decision because you had to.
[00:14:20.668 --> 00:14:32.895]  Your own words just a few moments ago that the meeting on the tarmac led you to do something, that was your exact words, it led me to do something and that was basically recuse yourself but didn't recuse yourself, you just said I'm going to accept what they tell me.
[00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:36.517]  It led me to discuss the decision I'd already made about how the matter would be handled.
[00:14:36.537 --> 00:14:41.419]  Had you already had conversations with the team before you made this statement and before the meeting on the tarmac?
[00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:42.239]  No.
[00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:46.101]  Before I had a conversation with former President Clinton, I had not spoken with the team.
[00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:52.984]  I had concluded in my mind how it should best be resolved because I had tremendous faith in their work and their integrity.
[00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:58.506]  Did you have it best be resolved as far as what they're doing and the way it was going about or the end outcome?
[00:14:59.144 --> 00:15:02.567]  I had no conversations about the end outcome of the investigation.
[00:15:03.008 --> 00:15:03.188]  Ha!
[00:15:03.568 --> 00:15:06.250]  Do you believe that there is such a thing as a strict liability offense?
[00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:08.112]  Depending upon the statute.
[00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:09.293]  Here comes the law talk.
[00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:09.694]  No, no.
[00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:10.694]  We went to law school.
[00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:12.676]  Is there strict liability offenses or not?
[00:15:13.217 --> 00:15:14.778]  In OSHA, for example, there are.
[00:15:14.798 --> 00:15:16.880]  In some environmental cases, there are.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.181]  Simply, yes or no.
[00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.923]  I've given you two examples.
[00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:21.044]  No, I want a yes or a no.
[00:15:21.104 --> 00:15:21.925]  Is there strict liability offenses?
[00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:22.865]  I've given you two examples.
[00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.208]  She can't say yes because she knows that that would indict Hillary.
[00:15:28.044 --> 00:15:31.046]  The issue that we have here is there's no ownership of DOJ.
[00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:33.107]  It's no wonder the optics of this are so bad.
[00:15:33.147 --> 00:15:39.130]  I've never agreed probably with David Axelrod in my life, but the optics of this are terrible, and you today have made it worse.
[00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:40.491]  Beautiful.
[00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:41.572]  Absolutely grilled.
[00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:45.974]  There she is dip-dodging and left and right, can't answer a question, won't even answer a yes-no question.
[00:15:46.254 --> 00:15:48.496]  And it's all because she's protecting Hillary Clinton, folks.
[00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:49.516]  That's the key.
[00:15:49.856 --> 00:15:54.239]  Here she is getting grilled by Jason Chaffetz doing the exact same dodge routine.
[00:15:55.677 --> 00:16:01.840]  Does an individual need a security clearance to review or have access to classified material?
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.302]  Congressman, that issue would be dependent upon the agency for whom they worked.
[00:16:06.802 --> 00:16:13.545]  Again, dodging the question, we're talking about Hillary Clinton having a classified server with classified documents illegally.
[00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.205]  Answer the damn question, Lynch!
[00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:23.209]  No, I believe, as I was going to say, they would, but the type of clearance varies with every agency, and the agency would make that decision in termination.
[00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:23.829]  You're going down!
[00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:32.112]  Is it legal or illegal to share classified information with somebody who doesn't have a security clearance?
[00:16:33.188 --> 00:16:36.551]  Congressman, it depends on the facts of the situation.
[00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:37.632]  You'd have to determine that.
[00:16:37.693 --> 00:16:40.655]  Because Hillary Clinton is guilty of everything he said.
[00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:42.417]  That's why she won't answer the question.
[00:16:42.617 --> 00:16:47.723]  If she answers the question honestly saying, yes, that's illegal, then she would indict Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:49.644]  She's protecting Hillary Clinton, folks.
[00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:50.105]  This is unbelievable.
[00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:55.190]  Do you think there is a scenario in which you could share classified information with somebody who doesn't have the requisite security clearance?
[00:16:55.635 --> 00:16:57.176]  No, I would not draw that conclusion.
[00:16:57.656 --> 00:17:04.641]  I would say that I'm not able to answer it as a hypothetical, but that there are a number of factors that would go into the decision and one could have any number of results.
[00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:12.746]  Is it legal or illegal to provide access to somebody who doesn't have the requisite security clearance to view classified material?
[00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:14.995]  Which Clinton did.
[00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:16.756]  Clinton did it.
[00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:21.277]  So everything Clinton did, not hypothetical, this is what Clinton did.
[00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:25.138]  She keeps saying hypothetical, that's what Clinton did, that's why he's asking you these questions.
[00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:25.658]  Clinton did.
[00:17:25.698 --> 00:17:26.138]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.378]  Do you have any examples of where it's
[00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:50.406]  Legally acceptable to retain classified information in a non-secure location?
[00:17:51.127 --> 00:17:53.187]  I don't have a hypothetical answer for that.
[00:17:53.627 --> 00:17:57.849]  Again, everything Clinton did, she's just saying, oh it's hypothetical, I don't know.
[00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:01.890]  There are a number of statutes that cover that, both at the federal and state level.
[00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.630]  And Colby admitted it!
[00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.111]  There are a number of ways in which that could be found.
[00:18:07.812 --> 00:18:12.493]  There's a difference between prosecuting something and whether it's legal or illegal.
[00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:16.199]  You know, these questions are pretty simple.
[00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:19.101]  And we've got millions of people with security clearance.
[00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:25.145]  How are they supposed to go through the gyrations that you've laid out in order to make a simple determination?
[00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:29.908]  Congressman, if we had a specific fact situation or fact pattern, that could be reviewed.
[00:18:30.248 --> 00:18:33.170]  See, if she was being honest, we've got to go to break.
[00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:40.135]  If she was being honest, she would just say, well, you know, all of that is illegal unless your last name is Clinton.
[00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:43.526]  She'd say, yep, that's illegal, but not for Hillary.
[00:18:43.787 --> 00:18:44.687]  Kind of like what Comey did.
[00:18:44.927 --> 00:18:46.088]  She did that that was illegal.
[00:18:46.108 --> 00:18:47.229]  She did that that was illegal.
[00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:48.350]  She did this that was illegal.
[00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.692]  But we're not going to prosecute Attorney General Loretta Rudd Lynch.
[00:18:51.892 --> 00:18:52.993]  Oh, I don't know if it's illegal or not.
[00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:53.773]  That's a hypothetical.
[00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:56.335]  Wait, it is illegal, but Hillary Clinton did it, so we're not going to prosecute.
[00:18:56.455 --> 00:18:57.716]  We'll be right back with Jared Beck.
[00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:05.821]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:10.054]  I'm now joined by Jared Beck, who is the counsel for the plaintiffs in the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:23.659]  And Jared Beck landed on my map when he produced a video and shared it on social media requesting for witness protection for people that are serving as witnesses in the DNC fraud lawsuit case.
[00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:25.360]  I'm now joined by Jared Beck.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.061]  Jared, I want to start the interview talking about that video.
[00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:31.763]  We've got a lot of things to cover, but I want to start the interview talking about that video.
[00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:48.471]  You made this video, you requested the judge provide witness protection to the people involved in the DNC lawsuit, the fraud lawsuit, and you actually heard back from the judge and he would not give you the counsel, he would not give you the witness protection you requested.
[00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:51.512]  What drove you to producing that video?
[00:23:51.612 --> 00:23:54.754]  What made you want to request that protection from the judge?
[00:23:56.161 --> 00:24:22.256]  Well, from the outset of this case, the case has been marked by a series of very disturbing and concerning events, starting with the unexpected death of our process server, Sean Lucas, who originally served the DNC at their headquarters.
[00:24:23.036 --> 00:24:23.497]  I don't
[00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:43.771]  I'm not sure.
[00:25:00.092 --> 00:25:14.416]  And so, because, you know, Seth Rich, as everyone knows, was a DNC employee, fairly high-level employee, who was involved in data analysis.
[00:25:14.496 --> 00:25:25.519]  And so, for the purposes of our lawsuit, which alleges that the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders,
[00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:30.743]  And in favor of Hillary Clinton, he would have been a very, very material witness.
[00:25:31.243 --> 00:25:42.572]  So those are just two of the disturbing events that happened shortly after we filed the lawsuit last year after the Guccifer 2.0 documents came out.
[00:25:43.596 --> 00:25:58.609]  And then more recently, we've had a series of concerning events happen closer to home here in South Florida, where the attorneys are located.
[00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:12.360]  We had a very strange call that was made to our office, which showed the number for Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office in Aventura, Florida.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:27.997]  Now, we don't know who or what was behind the actual call, but we've been told at this point that the matter has been referred to the Capitol Police for investigation.
[00:26:28.918 --> 00:26:34.444]  We've also had threats made to counsel.
[00:26:35.224 --> 00:26:51.714]  Uh, we've had, uh, in the course of those threats, uh, the name of, uh, a federal prosecutor by the name of Barrington Wiseman, uh, invoked and he was found, uh, washed up
[00:26:52.889 --> 00:26:56.072]  on the beach in Hollywood, dead.
[00:26:56.372 --> 00:27:06.640]  And this is not only Debbie Wasserman Schultz's home district, but this is the court where the DNC fraud lawsuit is pending.
[00:27:07.181 --> 00:27:18.490]  So we've had a series of very, very, very concerning events, and that's what prompted us to file the motion that we filed with the court.
[00:27:19.386 --> 00:27:23.229]  So there's the waterfront from Jared Beck again.
[00:27:23.289 --> 00:27:26.431]  He is the counsel for the plaintiffs in the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[00:27:26.891 --> 00:27:31.234]  And I want to go back to the Debbie Washerman Schultz thing for a second because this is key.
[00:27:32.215 --> 00:27:38.339]  One, if I recall correctly, they tried to call your office and pretend it wasn't them.
[00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:39.080]  Is that accurate?
[00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:44.583]  Well, we don't know who or what was behind the call.
[00:27:44.983 --> 00:27:55.992]  What we do know is that one of our employees received a call and the caller ID showed up upon further investigation.
[00:27:56.012 --> 00:28:00.396]  It was linked to Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office in Aventura.
[00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:13.015]  But the caller was using some type of voice recognition or voice masking technology to disguise the voice.
[00:28:13.115 --> 00:28:16.160]  So it sounded very, very robotic.
[00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:17.401]  We're good to go.
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.853]  And Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been up to some other shenanigans as well.
[00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:58.046]  She's been threatening people that have been looking into the Seth Rich murder, threatening people that are doing the investigation into the DNC lawsuit, then the strange phone call that you had, and then yesterday, or I think it was Wednesday, she came out and accused James Comey and Jay Johnson of perjury!
[00:28:58.746 --> 00:29:01.808]  Huge accusation coming from Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:03.730]  She seems to be losing it right now.
[00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:17.939]  She might be a weak link in the entire facade that I think is being orchestrated right now that revolves around these three deaths which prompted you to request the judge in this case to provide witness protection.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:38.775]  Let's go back to Sean Lucas for a second now because I've thought more about this and I'd like to hear your thoughts on this because Seth Rich has been kind of the focal point and I think that's because with Seth Rich it's you know it looks like cold-blood murder you know the picture that was painted by the media is that you know
[00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:41.277]  He's basically shot dead in the middle of the street.
[00:29:41.317 --> 00:29:43.298]  Now, that's not exactly what happened.
[00:29:43.338 --> 00:29:47.762]  It turned out he was shot and then he was actually still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
[00:29:48.042 --> 00:29:50.964]  And then we have no idea what happened to the hospital or what hospital he went to.
[00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:52.305]  You can get into that, too.
[00:29:52.705 --> 00:29:54.267]  But I'm curious, with Shawn Lucas...
[00:29:54.747 --> 00:29:57.108]  There hasn't been as much attention with Shawn Lucas.
[00:29:57.468 --> 00:30:02.710]  What do you think is going on with the, or is there an investigation into the death of Shawn Lucas?
[00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:07.651]  This is the man that served Debbie Washerman Schultz in the famous YouTube video.
[00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:13.133]  Why do you think there hasn't been much talk or much investigation into Shawn Lucas's death?
[00:30:13.953 --> 00:30:20.537]  Well, I'll tell you what we know in terms of facts, and then people can draw their own conclusions.
[00:30:22.178 --> 00:30:32.104]  After we received news of Sean Lucas's death, and, you know, people have to understand that Sean Lucas was not just
[00:30:32.904 --> 00:30:46.335]  The process server, in this case, but he, like Seth Rich, was also a... Sorry, that's my phone.
[00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:56.204]  He, like Seth Rich, was a potential witness in the case because at the time that he was found dead,
[00:30:56.944 --> 00:31:02.986]  The defendants were contesting service of process as being valid.
[00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:13.690]  And so when that happens, and this is a very, very unusual motion to be seen filed in a lawsuit where the defendant actually contests service of process.
[00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:20.559]  But when the defendant files a motion like that, the process server becomes a witness.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:28.808]  And so he was not just the process server, but he was also a potential witness in the case at the time he was found dead on
[00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:30.890]  We're good to go.
[00:31:53.470 --> 00:32:04.075]  was that an examination or an autopsy was conducted, although we've never gotten access to the autopsy.
[00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:12.819]  We did get access to a summary, I believe, of toxicology that was done as part of whatever autopsy was conducted.
[00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:16.981]  But there were three different substances
[00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:18.683]  I don't
[00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:36.117]  I mean, I don't know.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.

[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.709]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:12.725]  I'm now joined by Paul Naylan, who's going to be running against Paul Ryan, the swamp, if you will, of the GOP.
[00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:14.206]  Paul, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:37:14.826 --> 00:37:15.647]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:16.288]  Great to be on.
[00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:19.470]  Well, this is your first time here with InfoWars.
[00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.132]  I'm sure a lot of people know who you are by now.
[00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:24.474]  You've been pretty prevalent on Twitter at PNaylan.
[00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:26.076]  But talk about yourself real quick.
[00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:27.197]  What got you into politics?
[00:37:27.457 --> 00:37:30.620]  Why are you planning on running against Paul Ryan in Wisconsin's 1st District?
[00:37:31.488 --> 00:37:32.609]  I'm a manufacturing guy.
[00:37:32.929 --> 00:37:35.011]  I started out in a factory at 18 years old.
[00:37:35.531 --> 00:37:38.513]  I eventually ran that factory, got my engineering degree at night.
[00:37:38.913 --> 00:37:41.735]  I've run factories all around the United States and are all around the globe.
[00:37:41.795 --> 00:37:44.817]  I was in charge of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for a Fortune 500.
[00:37:45.778 --> 00:37:50.721]  And when I heard that Speaker Ryan was pushing this Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[00:37:51.642 --> 00:37:52.803]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:37:52.863 --> 00:38:02.050]  He was my representative here in Wisconsin and I reached out to him and I reached out to Governor Walker, in fact, and said, hey, we can't do this.
[00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.170]  This is crazy, you guys.
[00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:06.153]  And he wasn't relenting.
[00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:08.855]  He was working to fast track that legislation.
[00:38:09.135 --> 00:38:15.039]  And I said to myself, well, I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up supporting whoever it is that runs against Speaker Ryan.
[00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:18.121]  But months and months started moving by.
[00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:18.842]  That was early 2015.
[00:38:21.244 --> 00:38:28.087]  And nobody stepped up to run and eventually I said to myself, I'm going to have to do this myself.
[00:38:28.327 --> 00:38:30.969]  I'm going to have to run against Speaker Ryan.
[00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:33.050]  I'd never run for office in my life before.
[00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:39.573]  And so I reached out and see if I could develop a network of people who would support me.
[00:38:39.913 --> 00:38:41.854]  And lo and behold, I found out I could.
[00:38:42.854 --> 00:39:01.759]  So, in four months, between April and August of 2016, we were able to get Ryan to go on CNN and tell Monte Raju that Trans-Pacific Partnership was poorly negotiated, it was a bad deal, it needed to be renegotiated.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:07.341]  And it was shocking, actually, for him to go on and say that, because
[00:39:08.715 --> 00:39:13.079]  The legislation had been negotiated for over five years, over half a decade.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.661]  It was in a lock bunker.
[00:39:17.137 --> 00:39:23.440]  And he knew what was in that legislation, and he was disingenuous.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:28.243]  He said the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton did a poor job of negotiating it.
[00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:31.324]  And that was a bald-faced lie.
[00:39:31.965 --> 00:39:39.949]  And he even went on further to say that Fast Track gave Congress the ability to negotiate the trade deal.
[00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:48.632]  And that was a lie because the United States Trade Representative had already been negotiating it for over a half a decade.
[00:39:49.392 --> 00:39:53.454]  And what Fast Track did was it essentially said this is going to be an up or down vote.
[00:39:54.154 --> 00:39:55.514]  Congress doesn't get to change it.
[00:39:55.674 --> 00:39:58.195]  They just get to vote yes or vote no.
[00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:08.019]  And so I was strongly against Trans-Pacific Partnership and strongly for securing America's borders and
[00:40:09.315 --> 00:40:15.103]  The only candidate who matched up with me, you can see I got his sign right behind me, right?
[00:40:15.824 --> 00:40:19.568]  He's the only guy, the only one who was talking that same thing.
[00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:24.315]  And the first Monday in office, President Trump signed us out of Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:24.895]  God bless him.
[00:40:26.345 --> 00:40:30.866]  Well, and I'm hoping that Donald Trump creates Paul Nalens all over America.
[00:40:30.926 --> 00:40:32.307]  I'd love to see more people like you.
[00:40:32.347 --> 00:40:34.948]  Hey, if you want the job done right, do it yourself.
[00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:37.288]  I think that that's kind of your approach to this whole thing.
[00:40:37.748 --> 00:40:42.570]  And, you know, getting back to Paul Ryan real quick, you know, this is a guy to me that is soft as butter.
[00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.994]  Okay, he is not hardcore on any of Donald Trump's policies.
[00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:52.359]  He's been very wish-washy with the Affordable Care Act, the border wall, etc, etc.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.244]  But obviously you, going up against Paul Ryan, you're going to get a lot from the GOP.
[00:40:57.564 --> 00:41:02.930]  I'm just curious, what have inner party members, what has the response been from the GOP with your campaign?
[00:41:03.783 --> 00:41:07.425]  Oh, they absolutely have their knives out for me.
[00:41:07.525 --> 00:41:12.729]  They're not interested in me challenging Ryan at all.
[00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:19.073]  They want Ryan to skate along and do whatever he wants because he brings back millions of dollars to Wisconsin.
[00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:24.476]  He spent $10.6 million against me, against a guy who's never run before.
[00:41:25.077 --> 00:41:26.758]  He spent $10.6 million.
[00:41:27.538 --> 00:41:28.839]  That's a huge amount of money.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.643]  It's essentially ten times what anybody will spend in any normal race.
[00:41:35.144 --> 00:41:42.168]  I mean, this last Karen Handel and John Ossoff race was absolutely out of the realm of normalcy.
[00:41:45.991 --> 00:41:51.317]  But look, Speaker Ryan spends that $10.6 million here in the district for it.
[00:41:51.737 --> 00:41:53.419]  He gets positive press coverage.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.325]  There is no negative articles written about Ryan in this district unless it's written by a Democrat.
[00:42:00.286 --> 00:42:03.770]  And this is an R-plus-3 district, so the Democrats really
[00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:05.832]  They're not going to win this district.
[00:42:07.493 --> 00:42:08.814]  Not going against Paul Ryan.
[00:42:09.474 --> 00:42:18.640]  So it's incumbent on me to run in a primary against Speaker Ryan and beat him.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:25.765]  Because that is the only way we are going to get a true conservative, true patriot in office here in Wisconsin.
[00:42:27.216 --> 00:42:31.199]  He promised us a repeal vote on Obamacare and we didn't get one.
[00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:38.924]  And he didn't hold the vote because the conservatives were going to vote for it.
[00:42:39.204 --> 00:42:50.472]  Jim Jordan said on the radio, I heard him, that they had a bill ready to go to Trump's desk and all of a sudden Ryan shows up with this Ryancare 1.0 nonsense and they were shocked.
[00:42:50.892 --> 00:42:52.373]  The Freedom Caucus was shocked by that.
[00:42:52.993 --> 00:42:58.196]  And so Ryan then told President Trump, I don't want to have a vote.
[00:42:58.576 --> 00:42:59.337]  We don't have the votes.
[00:42:59.437 --> 00:43:00.537]  Why should we have a vote?
[00:43:00.977 --> 00:43:11.363]  Well, the answer is so that America can see who are the squishes, who are those who say they're Republicans, they're for smaller government, they're for free.
[00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:23.252]  Enterprise and real free trade, not these fake free trade deals like we get with Trans-Pacific Partnership or this ridiculous border adjustment tax that we just defeated yesterday, I might add.
[00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:28.695]  Speaker Ryan did not have a vote.
[00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:36.084]  We're paying for everything that Obama had in place in the 2015 omnibus when Ryan came into office.
[00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.267]  We're still funding all those things.
[00:43:38.547 --> 00:43:39.929]  We're funding sanctuary cities.
[00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.373]  We're funding the dangerous refugee resettlement.
[00:43:44.383 --> 00:43:54.050]  I mean, if you go, look, if you're tired of Speaker Ryan, go to my website, Elect Nehlen, N-E-H-L-E-N, go to electnehlen.com.
[00:43:54.871 --> 00:43:59.574]  Paul Ryan has so many people maxing out to his campaign, $2,700.
[00:43:59.934 --> 00:44:08.120]  Yeah, and let's be clear too, you tweeted this, most of his money, 99% comes from outside of the district.
[00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:09.921]  Isn't that shocking?
[00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:13.164]  I'm not shocked by it, but it should be shocking, yes.
[00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:18.121]  Yeah, well, you would think that the local news media would say, well, wait a minute.
[00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:21.904]  He's not really representing workers in Wisconsin.
[00:44:22.524 --> 00:44:26.267]  He's representing these big special interests.
[00:44:26.527 --> 00:44:28.949]  The vast majority of his money came from inside the D.C.
[00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:30.671]  Beltway, like $1.3 million.
[00:44:30.691 --> 00:44:35.054]  And then right behind that is New York, Chicago, Houston, L.A.
[00:44:36.235 --> 00:44:39.618]  That's not representative of Wisconsin's 1st District.
[00:44:39.678 --> 00:44:43.241]  We've got Racine and Kenosha in the east.
[00:44:43.761 --> 00:44:46.643]  Small, small cities outside of Milwaukee.
[00:44:46.663 --> 00:44:47.924]  It's a beautiful city.
[00:44:47.984 --> 00:44:48.825]  Racine, Wisconsin.
[00:44:48.845 --> 00:44:49.306]  It's beautiful.
[00:44:50.029 --> 00:44:51.891]  Yeah, it's absolutely fabulous.
[00:44:52.872 --> 00:44:57.236]  I ran one of SPX's flagship businesses here out of Delavan.
[00:44:57.897 --> 00:44:59.879]  Another great city.
[00:45:00.399 --> 00:45:02.121]  Great lake cities up there in Wisconsin.
[00:45:02.662 --> 00:45:06.626]  Yeah, I live right outside of Geneva Lake here in Williams Bay.
[00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:09.569]  It's beautiful here and a lot of farming.
[00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:19.151]  A lot of good manufacturing here, and Speaker Ryan is all about bringing in labor from low-cost countries.
[00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:28.136]  He is all about these visas, these H-1B, H-2B, H-4 visas.
[00:45:28.376 --> 00:45:35.980]  I just heard today that Kelly, over at DHS, is going to overrun the cap on the H visas.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:36.981]  It's absurd!
[00:45:38.021 --> 00:45:44.369]  We do not need inferior foreign labor replacing Americans in their job.
[00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:47.473]  And that's exactly what Speaker Ryan is doing.
[00:45:47.754 --> 00:45:50.617]  He is replacing Americans with foreign workers.
[00:45:52.028 --> 00:45:52.809]  Because they're cheap.
[00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.989]  That's why.
[00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:54.990]  That's the only reason.
[00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:56.972]  And that's what his donors are paying for.
[00:45:57.372 --> 00:46:05.778]  So you look at a guy who raised $18 million, almost $19 million, and $226,000 of it came from inside this district.
[00:46:06.259 --> 00:46:11.703]  I put $100,000 of my own money into my campaign last cycle.
[00:46:12.243 --> 00:46:15.165]  And you know my campaign didn't pay that all back to me.
[00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:17.267]  They still owe me the vast majority of it.
[00:46:17.587 --> 00:46:21.010]  I consider that a down payment on this run.
[00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.675]  So Speaker Ryan put $0 in his own campaign.
[00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.319]  $0 of his own money.
[00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:29.220]  I put $100.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.421]  I'm not a rich man.
[00:46:30.441 --> 00:46:31.342]  I'm not Donald Trump.
[00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:34.787]  As I said, I started out in a factory when I was 18 years old.
[00:46:35.428 --> 00:46:36.569]  I put that money in there.
[00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.332]  Because that had to be done.
[00:46:39.352 --> 00:46:41.995]  That's because you're running for America.
[00:46:42.055 --> 00:46:45.378]  Paul Naylan is running for America, folks, and this is how we drain the swamp.
[00:46:45.658 --> 00:46:51.564]  You want to drain the swamp, the onus falls on us to win in the midterm elections coming up in 2018.
[00:46:51.864 --> 00:46:55.548]  Getting Speaker Ryan out and Paul Naylan in is one of the ways to drain the swamp.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.438 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.742 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.513]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:59.082]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.717 --> 00:49:13.761]  America, truly the District of Criminals has completely lost any semblance of protecting our Republic.
[00:49:14.061 --> 00:49:33.833]  Town Hall writes in a bizarre story, the Associated Press' write-up of yesterday's FBI press conference makes clear that everyone involved agrees that deceased shooter James Hodgkinson detested Republicans with a fiery passion, yet investigators seem unwilling to call his attack premeditated or specifically targeted.
[00:49:34.053 --> 00:49:39.177]  At this point in the investigation, it appears more spontaneous, FBI agent Slater said.
[00:49:39.417 --> 00:49:54.289]  Hodgkinson had a piece of paper with the names of six members of Congress written on it, Slater also said, but the note lacked any further context and there was no evidence from his computer, phone or other belongings that indicated he planned to target those officials.
[00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:58.652]  He also took pictures of the baseball field where he would later fire more than 60 shots.
[00:49:59.753 --> 00:50:05.956]  The FBI does not believe these photographs represented surveillance of intended targets, the FBI said in a statement.
[00:50:06.256 --> 00:50:13.159]  Hodgkins had pictures of the ball field and a list of Congress members' names and had asked whether or not they were Democrats or Republicans.
[00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:28.725]  And now, after Jay Johnson's testimony finally puts the Russia-Trump election hysteria to bed, as the New York Post reported, Johnson told the House Intelligence Committee outright that the Russians failed to alter ballots, ballot counts, or reporting of election results.
[00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:38.529]  Yes, it's clear Russia, with Vladimir Putin's full approval, orchestrated cyber attacks designed to influence the 2016 contest and also push fake news.
[00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:41.210]  But the hack and release via WikiLeaks, etc.
[00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.631]  of Democratic emails produced nothing game-changing.
[00:50:44.771 --> 00:50:47.392]  The biggest impact was to confirm the obvious.
[00:50:47.512 --> 00:50:51.693]  The Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton from the start.
[00:50:51.893 --> 00:50:55.095]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.720]  I want to clarify, I'm not an actor.
[00:51:05.922 --> 00:51:06.923]  I lie for a living.
[00:51:09.825 --> 00:51:10.206]  However...
[00:51:12.122 --> 00:51:12.743]  It's been a while.
[00:51:13.043 --> 00:51:15.805]  Hollywood, have you ever heard of 18 U.S.
[00:51:15.865 --> 00:51:17.006]  Code 871?
[00:51:17.046 --> 00:51:40.264]  It reads, whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier, any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the Vice President, or any other officer in succession of the Office of the President of the United States,
[00:51:40.504 --> 00:51:43.126]  Now here is Michael Hastings' wife.
[00:51:43.146 --> 00:51:45.607]  Remember his car that blew up going down the road?
[00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:47.228]  Joe Biggs was at the funeral.
[00:51:54.659 --> 00:51:56.841]  She said, I'm going to get these bastards that killed him.
[00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:59.883]  But then when she went on Piers Morgan, she said, oh, nothing happened.
[00:51:59.923 --> 00:52:00.984]  It was totally normal.
[00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:06.029]  Now she's saying the president's like a suicide bomber, and he doesn't ever keep his word.
[00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:11.033]  No, that's why they're mad, is because he's really keeping his word on almost every agenda.
[00:52:11.393 --> 00:52:15.997]  My advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him, it's just like hugging a suicide bomber.
[00:52:16.317 --> 00:52:18.099]  He blows you up in the process with him.
[00:52:18.743 --> 00:52:20.725]  It's like hugging his, that's a little strong at least.
[00:52:20.745 --> 00:52:32.415]  Yeah, I mean it's, this is not, I mean look at what, if you go out on a limb, if you're a Republican who went out on a limb and defended Donald Trump over saying, well he's got tapes that are going to back up his point of view, you just got blown up too.
[00:52:33.137 --> 00:52:44.280]  What we are witnessing is a textbook coup d'etat of our executive office in action, overseen by former President Barack Obama and the moles still operating all over Washington, D.C.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:54.663]  Your president and his cabinet, whether you support them or not, are under an imminent threat by Democrats and Republicans in the black-budgeted deep state our tax dollars support.
[00:52:54.923 --> 00:52:58.284]  The legal recourse and peaceful grievance of the American people
[00:52:58.644 --> 00:53:01.565]  are the only force standing in the way of the inevitable.
[00:53:01.985 --> 00:53:04.566]  This country was born from revolution.
[00:53:04.926 --> 00:53:09.527]  The deep state and their pawns have no idea what a real revolution looks like.
[00:53:10.028 --> 00:53:12.328]  Drain the swamp before it's too late.
[00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:18.210]  By the way Johnny Depp, your portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson was incredibly weak and Bill Murray nailed it.
[00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.491]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:34.900]  You know, we hear a lot of people talking about how there's a deep state coup going against Donald Trump, and that's very true.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:46.229]  We had another person come out today, David Stockman, former manager of the budget under Ronald Reagan, came out and made the point very clearly, but I want to go back to what is the real government?
[00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.490]  Remember when Donald Trump fired James Comey?
[00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:58.238]  We immediately had the establishment, the DC empire, I like to call them, the politicians, the press, and the bureaucracy scream, coup!
[00:53:59.229 --> 00:54:01.190]  Well, Comey wasn't president.
[00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:06.053]  He worked for the president, if you look at the org chart, if you understand how it's supposed to be organized.
[00:54:06.353 --> 00:54:10.576]  But they understand, they see themselves as the permanent entrenched bureaucracy.
[00:54:11.236 --> 00:54:22.543]  And you know, when we have the Oliver Stone series on Vladimir Putin, one of the articles that came out this last weekend from Vox, they said it was really pretty revelatory what he had to say at the time.
[00:54:22.583 --> 00:54:24.144]  And this was recorded over a couple of years.
[00:54:24.784 --> 00:54:26.945]  At the time, Bernie Sanders was running for president.
[00:54:26.965 --> 00:54:29.865]  Of course, Oliver Stone was a big fan of Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:29.925 --> 00:54:34.326]  So he asks Vladimir Putin, what if Bernie Sanders wins?
[00:54:34.366 --> 00:54:35.467]  What do you think about him?
[00:54:36.367 --> 00:54:40.248]  Stone was trying to get Putin to say whether or not he liked Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:40.368 --> 00:54:45.049]  Putin demurred entirely, but he offered up a theory of how power functions.
[00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:48.090]  And this is very appropriate for what is happening today.
[00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.130]  This is what Putin said.
[00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:57.236]  He said, should Sanders become president, he would suddenly realize the vast weight of the American bureaucracy that existed underneath him.
[00:54:57.857 --> 00:54:59.398]  He might make some changes to the U.S.
[00:54:59.438 --> 00:55:03.942]  on a domestic level, but he would ultimately be unable to change that much.
[00:55:04.942 --> 00:55:13.569]  The person at the head of the state matters less than the centuries of power the state has accumulated and will protect at all costs.
[00:55:13.649 --> 00:55:14.430]  Let me repeat that.
[00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:16.132]  The person who is at the top
[00:55:16.894 --> 00:55:27.239]  Matters less than all of that accumulated power that the state, and by that he means the permanent entrenched bureaucracy that remains there regardless of who gets elected by you.
[00:55:27.259 --> 00:55:41.045]  So when they say it was a coup, when one of the most powerful of the bureaucracy was fired by the guy who just was merely the president elected by the American people, then that was a coup against the real power, against the real state.
[00:55:41.165 --> 00:55:43.906]  Everybody understands that who's watched politics very long.
[00:55:44.727 --> 00:55:48.130]  We have more people talking about this at this point in time.
[00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:52.214]  The establishment press, the deep state, the D.C.
[00:55:52.275 --> 00:55:53.276]  state, the D.C.
[00:55:53.376 --> 00:55:57.480]  empire is really like the Byzantine empire, the Byzantine bureaucracy.
[00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:03.726]  It was heralded by having extremely complex and intricate regulations.
[00:56:03.746 --> 00:56:06.429]  We talk about something with its Byzantine complexity or so forth.
[00:56:06.929 --> 00:56:11.690]  But there was also a deceitful, devious, stealthy application of those laws.
[00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.171]  And that's precisely what we have.
[00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:16.892]  When Nancy Pelosi says we'll have to pass it to find out what's in it, that's what she meant.
[00:56:16.912 --> 00:56:22.793]  We're going to create a bureaucracy and they're going to decide how healthcare is really going to operate.
[00:56:22.813 --> 00:56:24.113]  And that's precisely what they did.
[00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:25.794]  But today we had David Stockman join in.
[00:56:26.474 --> 00:56:28.335]  And he said a great coup is on the way.
[00:56:28.976 --> 00:56:36.501]  He says the president has the power to declassify secret documents at will, but in this instance he could also do that without compromising the intelligence community.
[00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:45.387]  He said that's because after the Snowden leak, the whole world knows, it's an open secret, that they collect every single electronic digit that passes through the World Wide Web.
[00:56:46.107 --> 00:56:47.989]  So he says if he were to do this,
[00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:54.922]  It would not compromise the lives of anybody who is an American spy, any human intelligence.
[00:56:55.202 --> 00:57:01.449]  He said it would just document the unconstitutional interference in the election process that has been committed by the U.S.
[00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:05.193]  intelligence agencies and political operatives in the Obama White House.
[00:57:05.513 --> 00:57:07.035]  And that is the key story, folks.
[00:57:07.773 --> 00:57:15.660]  We have to understand that yes, they are acting offensively, trying to do a counter coup in their eyes and take out Donald Trump.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.902]  But this has been defensive from the very beginning.
[00:57:18.422 --> 00:57:22.526]  This has been to defend themselves against their crimes.
[00:57:23.126 --> 00:57:33.614]  And we've had Senator Grassley, we've had Senator Paul and others point out that the real story here is how the intelligence community, how the law enforcement bureaucracy has become politicized.
[00:57:33.634 --> 00:57:35.715]  They have become Watergate burglars.
[00:57:35.775 --> 00:57:40.699]  Back in 1972, 44 years prior to all this happening, we only had five Watergate burglars.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:49.406]  Now we've got 17 intelligence agencies that are operating at the behest and for the benefit of the Obama administration.
[00:57:50.106 --> 00:57:55.049]  These kinds of crimes that they've committed are things like illegal surveillance and unmasking.
[00:57:55.089 --> 00:57:56.830]  The FISA court has called them out on that.
[00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:57.930]  They've declassified that.
[00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:06.135]  Obstruction of justice, and that includes people like FBI's Comey, Department of Justice Loretta Lynch, Attorney General, breaking into state computers.
[00:58:06.195 --> 00:58:07.976]  Jay Johnson of Homeland Security did that.
[00:58:08.016 --> 00:58:09.037]  It was not the Russians.
[00:58:09.077 --> 00:58:12.999]  They're creating this narrative to protect themselves against prosecution.
[00:58:13.339 --> 00:58:19.423]  These people are the Watergate burglars and they are involved in cover-up as well as perjury.
[00:58:20.023 --> 00:58:22.565]  That is the offensive that Donald Trump needs to take.
[00:58:23.186 --> 00:58:26.188]  We need to understand that that is something that he can do.
[00:58:26.949 --> 00:58:32.973]  And unless he does that, unless he keeps, if he keeps playing this game of tweeting out, they will take him down.
[00:58:32.993 --> 00:58:34.154]  He has the power to stop it.
[00:58:34.534 --> 00:58:36.316]  That's it for tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
