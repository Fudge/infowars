[00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:19.538]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:21.600]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.601]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.305]  Today is Thursday, January 12th, 2017.
[00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:31.271]  And here's a quick look at what's coming up... Tonight!
[00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:42.831]  NSA Insider speaks out on the ongoing Russian hacking narrative, as well as the ominous warning to Donald Trump from Chuck Schumer and the events that followed.
[00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:49.717]  Then, Barack Obama's forgotten farewell speech gets a reality check, and the liberals won't like it.
[00:00:51.013 --> 00:01:00.076]  Also, more double standards for the Clinton Family Crime Syndicate as a Navy sailor is jailed for far less than what Hillary Clinton is guilty of.
[00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:04.877]  Meanwhile, it's been one of the craziest weeks in a long time on Capitol Hill.
[00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:09.099]  We review the madness that was and the hearings for Trump's appointments.
[00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.140]  Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.421]  I think it's pretty sad.
[00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.461]  First of all, it's illegal.
[00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:21.346]  You know, these are classified and certified meetings and reports.
[00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:25.150]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:04.368]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:11.674]  We begin tonight with what could very well be the beginning of a civil war in Washington, as U.S.
[00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:27.647]  intelligence agencies have been caught red-handed attempting to blackmail the future President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, who yesterday launched an all-out attack on the press in his news conference
[00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:34.998]  Where he called CNN fake news and had this to say about where the leaks are coming from.
[00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.743]  And I'll give you a hint, they're not coming out of Russia.
[00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:45.188]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:47.169]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.210]  It's a disgrace.
[00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.791]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with.
[00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:52.771]  Attacking our news organization.
[00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.732]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:55.092]  Go ahead.
[00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:55.372]  Sir.
[00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:56.293]  Quiet.
[00:03:56.493 --> 00:03:56.793]  Quiet.
[00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:57.513]  Mr. President-elect.
[00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:57.933]  Go ahead.
[00:03:57.953 --> 00:03:59.334]  She's asking a question.
[00:03:59.354 --> 00:03:59.634]  Don't be rude.
[00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:01.135]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:01.975]  You're attacking us.
[00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:03.216]  Can you give us a question?
[00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:04.276]  Don't be rude.
[00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:05.637]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:06.857]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:07.737]  Can you state categorically?
[00:04:07.757 --> 00:04:08.578]  You are fake news.
[00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:11.220]  Do you trust your U.S.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.261]  intelligence officials?
[00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:21.450]  And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?
[00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.934]  Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important.
[00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:29.478]  We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo.
[00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:30.598]  I think?
[00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.072]  I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly, because we're hacked by everybody.
[00:04:50.412 --> 00:04:55.335]  That includes Russia, and China, and everybody.
[00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:59.417]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:09.143]  Mr. President-elect, you said just now that you believe that Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's emails, etc.
[00:05:09.223 --> 00:05:09.863]  But you know what?
[00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:10.884]  Could have been others also.
[00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.205]  How do you spend weeks undermining the U.S.
[00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:17.967]  intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?
[00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:21.808]  Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.
[00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:23.109]  I think it's pretty sad.
[00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.169]  First of all, it's illegal.
[00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:29.971]  You know, these are classified and certified meetings and reports.
[00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:31.352]  And I'll tell you what does happen.
[00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:34.333]  I have many meetings with intelligence.
[00:05:35.194 --> 00:05:38.315]  And every time I meet, people are reading about it.
[00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:40.442]  Somebody's leaking it out.
[00:05:40.762 --> 00:05:46.224]  That's right, and Donald Trump has every reason not to trust the CIA and other U.S.
[00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:47.525]  intelligence agencies.
[00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:59.949]  Don't forget, it was just a couple of months ago where Democrat minority leader Harry Reid said publicly that the CIA should give Donald Trump fake intelligence briefings.
[00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.409]  I told, I said publicly, give him fake briefings.
[00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:04.769]  Pretend you're briefing him.
[00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:06.950]  Don't tell him anything that you don't want to get out.
[00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.670]  And that's how I feel about it.
[00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.231]  I think that the man is a loose cannon.
[00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:17.332]  I think he's done so much to hurt our country with our international relations already.
[00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:20.973]  But as a Republican nominee, isn't he entitled to get those briefings?
[00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.113]  Give him fake briefings.
[00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:23.434]  What does that even mean?
[00:06:23.794 --> 00:06:25.014]  It means they'll tell him stuff.
[00:06:25.054 --> 00:06:25.934]  He won't know the difference.
[00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:28.315]  You're basically telling the intelligence community to lie to him.
[00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:30.813]  Now, you think that's bad?
[00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.936]  Wait until you see this.
[00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:39.722]  Last week, Senator Chuck Schumer was on the Rachel Maddow Show, and I thought this looked like a threat.
[00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:44.907]  Chuck Schumer delivered a message to Donald Trump from the CIA.
[00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:51.090]  But he's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.152]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:06:56.713 --> 00:07:02.175]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:05.296]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated to?
[00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:11.839]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:14.062]  That sure sounded like a threat to me.
[00:07:14.423 --> 00:07:29.274]  And you know, the day after those comments by Chuck Schumer, there was a Senate hearing that was supposed to prove once and for all that the Russians indeed hacked the DNC in order to help Donald Trump win the election.
[00:07:29.634 --> 00:07:32.716]  But the Senate hearings, they didn't prove a damn thing.
[00:07:33.137 --> 00:07:40.022]  What we did learn was that it wasn't even the CIA who officially released the information to begin with.
[00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:52.386]  No, it was supposedly anonymous sources within the CIA who told the Washington Post, the New York Times, that the Russians hacked the DNC and they provided WikiLeaks with the emails.
[00:07:52.426 --> 00:07:58.669]  And this, of course, is something that Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has denied from the very beginning.
[00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.691]  But we're supposed to believe the Washington Post.
[00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:09.257]  We're supposed to believe the New York Times and the rest of the liberal media who has been regurgitating these talking points.
[00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:13.681]  That it was anonymous sources within the CIA.
[00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:14.922]  Yeah, right.
[00:08:15.442 --> 00:08:17.224]  Now, I thought this was interesting.
[00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:26.431]  Check out what White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest had to say when he was asked where specifically the intelligence reports came from.
[00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.173]  Quick other question.
[00:08:28.877 --> 00:08:42.125]  So as far as the Russian hacks go, I know normally you can't discuss sources and methods and how you guys are getting intelligence, but can you at least characterize the sort of intelligence that's coming in that proves that this was a Russian hack?
[00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:45.688]  Is it digital fingerprints that you're tracing back to a computer?
[00:08:46.488 --> 00:08:52.731]  Well, I'm obviously quite limited in what I can say from here, but I think there are a couple of things that I can point to that I think answer the questions that you've raised.
[00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.392]  It's essentially two.
[00:08:54.412 --> 00:08:57.273]  The first is the statement that was issued by the intelligence community in October
[00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:28.919]  of 2016, before the election, making clear that Russia was interfering in our election, represented the consensus view of 17 different intelligence agencies.
[00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:33.502]  That's not usually the way intelligence works.
[00:09:35.204 --> 00:09:44.290]  That kind of unanimity of opinion, particularly when the stakes are so high, is notable.
[00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:50.293]  So the official White House response is that there are 17 U.S.
[00:09:51.094 --> 00:09:59.303]  intelligence agencies who are unified in their belief that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC to help Donald Trump win the election.
[00:09:59.864 --> 00:10:02.587]  And I got to thinking, you know, that sounds really familiar.
[00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:20.618]  Don't forget, we can take a look back at the run-up to the Iraq war when Colin Powell gave his UN address where he said that there were 16 US intelligence agencies who were unified in their belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:21.218 --> 00:10:24.764]  If we had known the intelligence was wrong, we would not have gone into Iraq.
[00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:30.092]  But the intelligence community, all 16 agencies, assured us that it was right.
[00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:33.837]  My speech at the UN was based on that information.
[00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:37.096]  Every statement I make today is backed up by sources.
[00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:38.457]  Solid sources.
[00:10:39.098 --> 00:10:40.059]  These are not assertions.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.045]  What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.
[00:10:45.725 --> 00:10:46.666]  So there you go.
[00:10:47.087 --> 00:10:49.550]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.271]  That was then, and this is now.
[00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:55.794]  Once again, Donald Trump has every reason not to trust the CIA.
[00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:59.356]  The CIA is a rogue agency.
[00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:01.377]  They have lied to us before.
[00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:04.839]  I mean, they have a long history of lying to the American public.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.701]  They have operatives working within the mainstream media.
[00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:09.462]  We all know that.
[00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:12.964]  Those of you who don't believe it, Google search Operation Mockingbird.
[00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:18.846]  The CIA has lied to the people from way back to Vietnam, to JFK.
[00:11:19.126 --> 00:11:27.250]  They lied to us about the terrorist attack on Cubana Flight 455, Operation Gladio, drug trafficking in the U.S.
[00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.772]  They lied to us about Benghazi, 9-11, the 28 pages, you name it.
[00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:41.076]  And now they are out to destroy Donald Trump, who is a direct threat to the entire establishment.
[00:11:41.716 --> 00:11:45.185]  Former NSA Technical Director William Benny joins us now.
[00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:50.177]  And sir, I wanted to ask you, I wanted to get your take on the official White House response.
[00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:54.066]  That there are 17 U.S.
[00:11:54.126 --> 00:12:02.733]  intelligence agencies who are unified in their belief that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC in favor of Donald Trump to win the election.
[00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:03.873]  Do you buy it?
[00:12:03.954 --> 00:12:08.677]  Or does this remind you, you know, the first thing I thought of was Colin Powell in his U.N.
[00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:09.157]  address.
[00:12:09.498 --> 00:12:11.079]  He said there were 16 U.S.
[00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:15.602]  intelligence agencies who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:16.683]  Does it sound familiar?
[00:12:17.543 --> 00:12:21.804]  Yeah, it also sounds familiar, just like the Tonkin Gulf affair that didn't happen.
[00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:31.586]  I mean, but I mean, the first thing that the first clue I had by by seeing what they were saying was that they they they judged with high confidence.
[00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:36.967]  Now, what that means is they had no empirical evidence to show a trail directly to them.
[00:12:37.688 --> 00:12:39.348]  So they're just guessing at the end.
[00:12:40.879 --> 00:13:01.325]  Well, and then mainstream media, just right on cue, they regurgitate all the talking points and what the simply, you know, we saw the Senate hearings that didn't prove a damn thing and all they've got is the New York Times and the Washington Post who had anonymous sources from the CIA that told them that it was the Russians that hacked the DNC.
[00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:07.727]  Yes, and the other point is that hacking is not the issue.
[00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:10.568]  The real issue is who gave the data to WikiLeaks?
[00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:11.655]  That's right.
[00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:14.898]  I mean, I'm sure the Russians hacked everybody.
[00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.801]  I mean, certainly they would go after Hillary Clinton because she used to be Secretary of State.
[00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:24.045]  So, I mean, she was a target, just like all Secretaries of State of all the countries are targets.
[00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:25.927]  So, I'm sure they did it.
[00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:27.368]  I'm sure the Israelis did it.
[00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:28.609]  I'm sure the British did it.
[00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:29.970]  I'm sure the Germans did it.
[00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.251]  I'm sure any number of countries.
[00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:35.374]  Certainly the Iranians, the North Koreans, you know.
[00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:36.755]  I'm sure all of them did it.
[00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:39.117]  So, the question really becomes,
[00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:46.079]  Who passed them, after they hacked them and got them, who passed them to WikiLeaks, if in fact that's the way that that happened.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:14:01.167]  Craig Murray, a former UK diplomat, said that he passed the data to WikiLeaks from someone he met in American University in Washington, D.C., who was basically a disgruntled employee of the DNC.
[00:14:01.912 --> 00:14:03.593]  And that's the sources we're hearing as well.
[00:14:03.613 --> 00:14:07.756]  This is all coming from disgruntled employees within the U.S.
[00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:08.837]  intelligence community.
[00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:14.160]  And Julian Assange from WikiLeaks, he said from the very beginning that it did not come from Russia.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.201]  That's correct.
[00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:21.965]  And now, and I was wondering, you've been with the NSA, you were with the NSA for 36 years, and you know what it's like when the U.S.
[00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:24.067]  government gets boxed into a corner.
[00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:28.109]  Donald Trump is a direct threat to the establishment.
[00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:31.530]  Does that mean the establishment is a direct threat to Donald Trump?
[00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.871]  Could his life be in danger?
[00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:39.674]  Well, I don't know if they'd go that far, but certainly they'll try to undermine him any way they can.
[00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:41.615]  I mean, that's the way they operate.
[00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:42.115]  Yeah.
[00:14:43.776 --> 00:14:46.637]  Well, even Senator Schumer has warned him about that.
[00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:51.465]  Yeah, I played that clip earlier and it sounded like a direct threat from the CIA.
[00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:53.026]  He's passing on the message.
[00:14:53.646 --> 00:15:03.129]  Senator Rand Paul said whoever is behind the leaks should be prosecuted and should be thrown in jail because this is blackmailing the future president of the United States.
[00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:03.629]  Am I right?
[00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.891]  Well, yes, but you have to remember with our Department of Just Us,
[00:15:09.522 --> 00:15:11.724]  They, they, it depends on who it is, right?
[00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:25.796]  If it's Hillary, anybody associated with them, or, you know, if it's, if it's people who are in the intelligence community that are too important or too high up to, to prosecute, like Petraeus or something like that, then, then they, they fall into the group of us and they don't get prosecuted.
[00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:30.115]  Well, you know, Donald Trump has always talked about draining the swamp.
[00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:34.556]  Do you think he's going to be capable of draining the swamp of the U.S.
[00:15:34.596 --> 00:15:35.637]  intelligence agencies?
[00:15:36.057 --> 00:15:36.937]  There's a lot of work to do.
[00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:40.858]  Yeah, that's really going to be tough, but he's got a it's really going to be a big job.
[00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:49.721]  But he you know, he's got to have the right people in there who want who are quite willing to, you know, hit everybody hard and take them out and get rid of them if they're in the way.
[00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:51.922]  That's really what the problem is.
[00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:56.783]  It's basically, I think, about the top four levels of management of all these intelligence agencies.
[00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:59.313]  I mean, their whole system is built on lies.
[00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.014]  They lie to Congress, they lie to the public, they lie to each other, you know?
[00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.595]  So, it's all built on lies.
[00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:10.137]  Dan Coats, he's the new nominated Director of National Intelligence.
[00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:19.781]  And see, I think he needs to bring in outsiders and investigate just how corrupt and dishonest that, you know, we're talking senior levels of the U.S.
[00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.001]  intelligence agencies.
[00:16:21.402 --> 00:16:22.362]  That's a good place to start.
[00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:32.046]  Yeah, in fact we had filed a complaint against the corruption, fraud, waste, and abuse just at NSA, and that's documented in the DOD IG report on the Thin Thread Trailblazer program.
[00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:36.627]  And they kept that under wraps and hidden from everybody for, you know, over a decade.
[00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:37.508]  Wow.
[00:16:38.408 --> 00:16:39.869]  Alright, we're almost out of time.
[00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:42.009]  The inauguration is next week.
[00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.471]  Do you think there's going to be any more surprises, any more blackmailing?
[00:16:46.511 --> 00:16:47.952]  What can we expect from the U.S.
[00:16:47.992 --> 00:16:51.293]  Intelligence Agency against Donald Trump before the inauguration?
[00:16:52.369 --> 00:17:00.532]  Well, I don't know that they'd, I mean, they've been caught basically or been implicated in a lot of the false news things and things like that.
[00:17:00.612 --> 00:17:02.633]  So who's going to believe anything that comes out now?
[00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:04.013]  No one in the public.
[00:17:04.053 --> 00:17:05.854]  You can't believe anything that's coming out in public.
[00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:10.256]  Certainly the mainstream media has no clue except the regurgitate what they're told.
[00:17:10.836 --> 00:17:12.877]  They don't do any investigative reporting anymore.
[00:17:12.937 --> 00:17:16.378]  So, you know, they're not going to get any truth from them anymore either.
[00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:29.321]  Well, and I think that's the good news is the American people are not buying it anymore and thanks to people even like our new president Donald Trump, he bypasses the media, he goes straight to independent media and social media.
[00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:33.404]  So I think that's the good news and I think that's the way we'll learn about the truth in the future.
[00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:34.805]  I believe that's right.
[00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:35.226]  Yep.
[00:17:35.626 --> 00:17:37.288]  All right, William Benny, thanks for joining us.
[00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:38.789]  It's good to have you on our side.
[00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:40.210]  Well, thanks for having me too.
[00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:48.577]  The criminal multinational elements that have hijacked our republic are in full panic mode.
[00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:53.801]  Donald J. Trump has led the American people in the first stages of restoring our republic.
[00:17:54.041 --> 00:18:02.327]  Now they're launching the bizarre conspiracy theory with no proof, claiming that Trump and his legions of supporters are either Russian agents or they're Dukes.
[00:18:03.087 --> 00:18:21.278]  While the trillion pound elephant in the living room is the fact that Hillary Clinton publicly got illegal money from the Communist Chinese, Saudi Arabia, and scores of other nations directly to Super PACs and her campaign, not to mention her admittedly illegal foundation.
[00:18:21.818 --> 00:18:27.459]  It was Hillary that got $35 million to hand over our uranium to Russia, not Donald Trump.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:43.244]  That's why it's imperative that President-elect Trump get on the offense now with the truth that it's Hillary, the Democrats, and the MSM that are in league with the foreign powers of globalism to bring our country down and destroy our sovereignty.
[00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:48.245]  They have done, in spades, what they accuse Donald J. Trump of.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.

[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.182]  Well, it wasn't just the purveyors of fake news feeling the heat at yesterday's presser.
[00:23:12.262 --> 00:23:13.763]  It was also big pharma.
[00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:18.385]  Now, yesterday, President-elect Donald Trump was talking about the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:23:18.445 --> 00:23:20.306]  He said they're getting away with murder.
[00:23:20.707 --> 00:23:24.869]  Trump actually mentioned the drug prices and pharmaceutical companies' tax inversions.
[00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:33.673]  Well, as he's talking about this, the nine biggest pharmaceutical companies by market cap on the S&P 500, they shed roughly 24.6
[00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:40.038]  Billion dollars in 20 minutes.
[00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:46.325]  $24.6 billion in 20 minutes just because Donald Trump is talking about the fact that they're getting away with murder.
[00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:47.927]  There needs to be more competition.
[00:23:48.327 --> 00:23:54.033]  So, you know, granted, this is only a 3% decrease from the combined $906 billion before Trump's speech.
[00:23:57.577 --> 00:24:04.981]  But still, it's a little something, and it's very promising there with Donald Trump saying that the drug industry has been totally disastrous.
[00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:08.963]  They need to up the manufacturing of drugs here in the U.S.
[00:24:09.003 --> 00:24:14.926]  Of course, we get them imported from all sorts of dangerous places that don't have proper protocol on them.
[00:24:15.186 --> 00:24:23.070]  But Trump also said that he wanted to create a new process for the drug industry, a new negotiating process, because they are getting away with murder.
[00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.591]  And guess who agrees with him?
[00:24:24.991 --> 00:24:25.832]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:24:26.092 --> 00:24:27.634]  Bernie Sanders said he's right.
[00:24:28.235 --> 00:24:29.877]  And he's been saying that for years.
[00:24:29.897 --> 00:24:34.803]  That's why a lot of people were very supportive of Bernie Sanders because he has been pushing this for years.
[00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:37.707]  He says, Big Pharma does get away with murder.
[00:24:37.967 --> 00:24:38.848]  Literally murder.
[00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:42.713]  People die because they can't get the prescription drugs they need.
[00:24:43.414 --> 00:24:46.836]  And he also agreed with Trump's comments about Big Pharma lobbyists.
[00:24:47.156 --> 00:24:48.137]  He said, it's true.
[00:24:48.257 --> 00:24:52.059]  Pharma does have lobbyists all over the country, not just in Washington.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.480]  These people are horrific.
[00:24:53.801 --> 00:24:58.884]  I mean, these, indeed, they are just scattered like roaches all over D.C.
[00:24:59.244 --> 00:25:02.286]  Lobbyists for Big Pharma are some of the main lobbyists.
[00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:05.668]  The majority of lobbyists there are there are for Big Pharma.
[00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:10.331]  So they have a huge hand in in what is going on in our government.
[00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:23.941]  And so that's why Sanders, Bernie Sanders, is a little bit apprehensive, thinking that Donald Trump and the GOP are not going to push back against these people who are, you know, some of the most powerful people in America.
[00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:26.302]  They definitely work for some of the most powerful industries.
[00:25:26.642 --> 00:25:29.444]  So Bernie Sanders is going to be introducing
[00:25:30.305 --> 00:25:30.926]  I don't know.
[00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.121]  I'm happy about this because, of course, this works.
[00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:56.946]  It works when you're able to negotiate prices, not when Big Pharma has a monopoly, which is what they want right now.
[00:25:57.306 --> 00:26:03.771]  And, of course, we really need to see and watch what Donald Trump and the Republicans there in power do because a lot of people want this.
[00:26:04.372 --> 00:26:10.737]  These drug prices are absolutely insane, and they're just getting away with murder because they're not having to negotiate on it.
[00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:14.620]  The VA negotiates, and that's why their prices are lower
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.823]  Then for Medicare and other government agencies.
[00:26:17.884 --> 00:26:18.925]  So this absolutely works.
[00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:26.294]  But it's not just Big Pharma and fake news who were the losers there with Donald Trump, but also billionaire George Soros.
[00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:27.695]  That's some good news here.
[00:26:28.016 --> 00:26:33.603]  He lost nearly $1 billion in the weeks after Donald Trump's election.
[00:26:33.663 --> 00:26:34.404]  That is right.
[00:26:34.864 --> 00:26:36.585]  So this is nearly $1 billion.
[00:26:36.945 --> 00:26:39.827]  Now, this sentence here, it just creeps me out.
[00:26:39.887 --> 00:26:44.970]  So last year, Mr. Soros returned to trading at the Soros Fund Management LLC.
[00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.692]  It manages about $30 billion for Mr. Soros and his family.
[00:26:49.052 --> 00:26:57.177]  Now, it says Mr. Soros was lured back by the opportunities to profit from what he saw as coming economic troubles.
[00:26:57.837 --> 00:27:03.521]  Oh, he's just such a smarmy, snaky fellow and he could sense these coming economic troubles.
[00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.243]  I wonder why he could sense them.
[00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:09.486]  Well, could it be because he was funding them to the tune of millions of dollars?
[00:27:09.526 --> 00:27:10.807]  This is what he does globally.
[00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:18.853]  This was why he was actually able to make all that money, about a billion dollars of profits back in 1992 when he bet against the British Pound.
[00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:32.656]  But he goes around globally and with his NGOs and these other offshoots, these other organizations funding like Black Lives Matter, for instance, he's able to foment this unrest, this season of protests, and then he capitalizes on the unrest.
[00:27:32.976 --> 00:27:35.036]  So that's how he's making all his money.
[00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:40.097]  That's why you're saying, why the heck would he be putting $300 million into Black Lives Matter and other groups?
[00:27:40.137 --> 00:27:43.878]  Because he knows he's going to make a lot of money back on the stock market,
[00:27:44.298 --> 00:27:47.140]  But this time he hedged the wrong bet.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.925]  So he was very cautious after President-elect Donald Trump was elected.
[00:27:54.265 --> 00:27:56.687]  And so he thought, you know, the stock market's going to crash.
[00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:58.048]  People are going to be very upset.
[00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:08.156]  But in fact, the stock market has rallied on the expectations that Mr. Trump's policies are going to actually boost corporate earnings and the overall economy.
[00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:09.277]  And there you go.
[00:28:09.617 --> 00:28:10.698]  George Soros, the loser.
[00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:31.325]  I'm Margaret Howell, I'm a reporter here at InfoWars, and I decided to do my Man on the Street today, inside the studio, because I'm asking the question, how many of you have been unfriended, maybe a nasty comment or two, about espousing to a political belief online, be it Facebook or Twitter.
[00:28:31.345 --> 00:28:36.830]  I'm going to go around the office and ask my fellow comrades, because we all know that they have political beliefs.
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:42.752]  Alright, so there was a guy who I grew up with that lived in the house behind me, alright?
[00:28:42.772 --> 00:28:46.353]  I used to be able to jump from my backyard into his backyard.
[00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:48.993]  His mom worked with my dad.
[00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:49.914]  We're friends.
[00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:51.314]  We're lifelong friends.
[00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:55.975]  And I noticed on Facebook, like, you know, I haven't heard from Marty.
[00:28:56.415 --> 00:28:57.616]  I'm not going to say his last name.
[00:28:57.636 --> 00:29:01.497]  I haven't heard from Marty in a while and I noticed we weren't friends anymore.
[00:29:01.877 --> 00:29:05.218]  Well, I know he's a big-time Obama supporter and I guess he saw some
[00:29:06.238 --> 00:29:11.821]  Maybe some posts that I had that weren't too favorable to Barack Obama and he's gone.
[00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:24.307]  We're in the belly of the beast and we found Travis Knight, the infamous titler of titles, and we're going to be asking him if he's ever been unfriended because of a Facebook post regarding Trump or anything political.
[00:29:24.487 --> 00:29:25.628]  Okay, Travis Knight.
[00:29:25.888 --> 00:29:26.668]  Yes, actually.
[00:29:26.768 --> 00:29:37.450]  Right after Trump was elected, I made some posts about him winning it and it was over, and how I was going to be gloating for the next four years, and immediately, this girl who I'd been talking to, who supported Hillary, unfriended me.
[00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.531]  Were you also subsequently denied a date?
[00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:42.051]  No, that was never on the table.
[00:29:42.331 --> 00:29:42.931]  Never on the table?
[00:29:43.051 --> 00:29:43.271]  No.
[00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:44.191]  So totally 86 to you?
[00:29:44.211 --> 00:29:44.271]  Yep.
[00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:45.131]  Because of a Trump post?
[00:29:46.432 --> 00:29:47.092]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:29:47.132 --> 00:29:49.372]  That was definitely what caused it, because it was immediately after that.
[00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:50.592]  I noticed we were no longer friends.
[00:29:50.612 --> 00:29:51.632]  Did you ever ask her why?
[00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:52.233]  No.
[00:29:52.473 --> 00:29:54.233]  I mean, if you're going to unfriend me about something like that,
[00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:56.155]  Doesn't really matter.
[00:29:56.476 --> 00:30:00.057]  I don't really keep track of who has unfriended me.
[00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:06.661]  I don't care enough, so... Have you ever been unfriended because of a Facebook post politically leaning?
[00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:08.321]  No, I have not.
[00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:09.922]  Facebook is for my grandma.
[00:30:10.262 --> 00:30:10.803]  I don't use it.
[00:30:11.483 --> 00:30:20.287]  I had to get rid of Facebook entirely for that reason because of the political content that I would put up and people would hate it so much I just couldn't deal with it anymore.
[00:30:20.307 --> 00:30:21.028]  What did you post?
[00:30:22.328 --> 00:30:24.270]  Oh man, this was years ago, actually.
[00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.631]  This was probably three or four years ago.
[00:30:25.651 --> 00:30:31.757]  I would just post stuff, you know, red pill, try to red pill people on Facebook, and I would just get totally hated on and scorned.
[00:30:32.318 --> 00:30:36.542]  And people started defriending me, so then I just decided, you know what, I'm just gonna get off of it.
[00:30:36.602 --> 00:30:38.424]  I don't need to waste my time with that altogether.
[00:30:38.544 --> 00:30:41.186]  I know I have lost friends from following me on Twitter.
[00:30:41.226 --> 00:30:42.007]  I do still have Twitter.
[00:30:42.027 --> 00:30:44.649]  Have you ever been defriended because of a political post?
[00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:45.270]  That's my question.
[00:30:47.738 --> 00:30:57.683]  Uh, I'm not sure about on social media, cause I really don't pay attention to who unfollows me, but I definitely, there was one girl who really wasn't even my friend, frankly, but she just... A friend of you?
[00:30:57.723 --> 00:30:58.143]  A friend of me.
[00:30:58.203 --> 00:30:59.343]  She just randomly texted me.
[00:30:59.363 --> 00:31:01.764]  She's like, oh my God, are you really going to go vote for Trump?
[00:31:01.904 --> 00:31:02.305]  Why?
[00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:13.449]  And I was like, well, because not only is Hillary Clinton an evil beast, a demon queen, and I'm not going to vote for her, but I'm also not really caught up in identity politics, which you clearly are.
[00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.370]  And I just gave her this thing.
[00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.130]  Never heard back from her again.
[00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.050]  Never heard back.
[00:31:17.131 --> 00:31:17.831]  And it's like, good.
[00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:18.571]  Good riddance.
[00:31:18.951 --> 00:31:21.531]  But I don't like, I don't want to just fill myself in an echo chamber.
[00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:24.212]  I like having friends that are kind of all over the place.
[00:31:24.392 --> 00:31:29.813]  And my neighbor texted me specifically just to say, hey, I voted for Hillary Clinton twice.
[00:31:29.833 --> 00:31:33.834]  Because she voted in Texas and then she moved the next day and voted in- It's not even legal!
[00:31:34.114 --> 00:31:34.814]  It's not legal!
[00:31:34.874 --> 00:31:36.875]  And that's when I was like, you're a friggin' hooligan.
[00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.415]  I was like, you're a friggin' hooligan.
[00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:40.915]  And, but we're still friends.
[00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:41.515]  Like, whatever.
[00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:42.836]  And Hillary Clinton lost, so.
[00:31:42.856 --> 00:31:43.856]  Did you turn her into any sort of-
[00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:45.037]  I did not.
[00:31:45.197 --> 00:31:50.142]  I thought about it, you know, screenshot of that text, but no, Tara, I let you slide this time.
[00:31:50.182 --> 00:31:56.308]  And my best friend is like a huge liberal out in California, and we've gotten in huge fights, but she's my best friend.
[00:31:56.368 --> 00:32:00.372]  Like, it's good to have people that can like broaden your horizons.
[00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:02.674]  Conclusive mixed bag is what we're finding.
[00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:04.875]  Some people were unfriended, some people don't care.
[00:32:04.955 --> 00:32:06.416]  Regardless, here's my story.
[00:32:06.436 --> 00:32:07.597]  Of course, I'm on Facebook.
[00:32:08.378 --> 00:32:11.560]  And surprisingly, I have a lot of people on there that I don't know.
[00:32:12.081 --> 00:32:14.703]  I've never actually posted anything political on Facebook.
[00:32:14.743 --> 00:32:18.546]  I try to keep that to the news only, and then Facebook just for friends.
[00:32:18.986 --> 00:32:25.371]  I've never been unfriended, that I know of, yet, because of a political ideology, and that's my story.
[00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:27.792]  Well, I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:03.586]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.207 --> 00:33:07.914]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.729]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:31.567]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.

[00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:37.592]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.434]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:35:39.774 --> 00:35:42.797]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.

[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:59.372]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.

[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.241]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:36:10.382 --> 00:36:18.125]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:50.437]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:53.859]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:36:58.068 --> 00:36:59.411]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:10.486 --> 00:37:12.608]  There they were, three blind mice.
[00:37:12.848 --> 00:37:16.932]  The FBI's James Comey, now under investigation by the U.S.
[00:37:17.013 --> 00:37:27.843]  Justice Department's Inspector General into whether the FBI followed appropriate procedures in its investigation of Hillary Clinton's private server when she was Secretary of State.
[00:37:28.104 --> 00:37:31.367]  The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.
[00:37:31.587 --> 00:37:53.035]  Who in his own words said, quote, my fingerprints were on that national intelligence estimate, end quote, when referring to the bogus intelligence that got the United States into the Iraq war in 2002, and recently lied to Congress concerning every American's right to privacy from the Orwellian surveillance state he represents.
[00:37:53.355 --> 00:38:00.898]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:38:02.355 --> 00:38:02.736]  No, sir.
[00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:04.783]  It does not.
[00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:07.512]  Not wittingly.
[00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:15.482]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:20.504]  And the CIA's John Brennan, a man who voted for the Communist Party in 1976.
[00:38:20.744 --> 00:38:27.266]  The known Wahhabist, converted to radical Islam, lives in Saudi Arabia for over a decade.
[00:38:27.306 --> 00:38:28.927]  Let's put him back on screen for TV viewers.
[00:38:29.727 --> 00:38:37.170]  And this guy, this agent of Saudi Arabia, that runs around kissing him on the cheek and holding little hands.
[00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.271]  I mean, how creepy.
[00:38:39.164 --> 00:38:44.475]  All those old men walking around in those nightgowns and just their beards and everything.
[00:38:44.495 --> 00:38:45.477]  This is Creepville!
[00:38:46.238 --> 00:38:50.442]  CIA Director 28 pages contain inaccurate information.
[00:38:50.842 --> 00:38:52.223]  Oh well then release it then!
[00:38:52.684 --> 00:38:55.626]  They fought tooth and nail to cover up that report.
[00:38:55.666 --> 00:39:00.610]  They did the whole 9-11 Commission to abscond the truth and cover up what went on earlier.
[00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:07.256]  All of them loyal to the New World Order Obama administration and on their way out with nothing to lose.
[00:39:07.736 --> 00:39:13.301]  Three amigos utilizing information warfare to foment order
[00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:24.045]  I had a conversation with the director of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, and told him clearly that if Russia was doing this, they were playing with fire.
[00:39:24.065 --> 00:39:33.910]  The Russians, I think, have no compunction about using the full array of tools and techniques available in their kit bag.
[00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.932]  So I wouldn't put it past them to do that or any other tools they've used.
[00:39:39.652 --> 00:39:42.374]  I have many meetings with intelligence and
[00:39:54.437 --> 00:39:56.418]  Every time I meet, people are reading about it.
[00:39:56.478 --> 00:40:05.221]  But if there's private information that someone is blackmailing a public figure, and the public figure or someone takes it to the intelligence agencies, you would think it would be private.
[00:40:05.682 --> 00:40:09.463]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[00:40:09.803 --> 00:40:10.884]  Someone should go to jail.
[00:40:11.384 --> 00:40:14.725]  If this was an intelligence agency head that talked to the media, they should go to jail.
[00:40:15.145 --> 00:40:17.927]  If this was part of the Obama administration, they should go to jail.
[00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:20.508]  Let's say any public official is being blackmailed.
[00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:21.588]  What do they tell you to do?
[00:40:21.608 --> 00:40:23.449]  You're supposed to go to the FBI and give them the information.
[00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:36.072]  But if you can't trust the FBI to keep it secret, and the FBI is going to tell the press what someone's blackmailing you about, what will happen is it will lead to a situation where public figures may be more liable to be extorted or to be blackmailed.
[00:40:36.252 --> 00:40:38.853]  Question is, who's running the show here?
[00:40:39.113 --> 00:40:44.234]  The compromised intelligence agencies fronting for the interests of a shadow government?
[00:40:44.474 --> 00:40:51.376]  Or the duly elected President-elect Donald Trump, who as the head of the executive branch of our government,
[00:40:51.536 --> 00:40:58.240]  Should not be subjected to the blackmail tactics of an out-of-control globalist media ambush.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.521]  You are fake news.
[00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:00.682]  Sir, can you stay quiet?
[00:41:00.722 --> 00:41:02.062]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:10.305 --> 00:41:13.227]  Hey what's going on everybody, this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:41:13.267 --> 00:41:16.008]  Now this year's election cycle was pretty intense.
[00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:21.111]  A lot of new truths came to light, a lot of things that we kind of already expected about Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:30.517]  But one of the damning things was the fact that she was using an unsecured email server in her basement where she did send and receive classified information.
[00:41:30.917 --> 00:41:33.679]  And we all got light of that due to the WikiLeaks
[00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:34.700]  We're good to go.
[00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:58.789]  The FBI Director James Comey comes out and lays out every possible reason why Hillary Clinton should be prosecuted and yet nothing happens.
[00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:06.215]  There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.
[00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:07.496]  For example,
[00:42:08.579 --> 00:42:17.405]  Seven email chains concerned matters that were classified at the top secret special access program at the time they were sent and received.
[00:42:17.765 --> 00:42:30.674]  And then the President of the United States, Barack Obama, idly sits by and lets this atrocity happen in front of the American people when everyone can plainly see that she is lying to the American people.
[00:42:31.054 --> 00:42:33.156]  I did not email any...
[00:42:35.203 --> 00:42:38.724]  Um, classified material to anyone on my email.
[00:42:39.004 --> 00:42:40.524]  There is no classified materials.
[00:42:40.744 --> 00:42:45.505]  I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time.
[00:42:45.525 --> 00:42:53.307]  I had, uh, not sent, uh, classified material nor received anything, uh, marked classified.
[00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:55.807]  But one thing did happen in all of this.
[00:42:56.227 --> 00:43:03.849]  If you ever went to a Trump rally, there was one famous slogan that was chanted all the time, and that's something that hopefully will happen to her.
[00:43:11.203 --> 00:43:15.806]  But today I want to talk about the article that was published by the Drudge Report from the Washington Times.
[00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:21.249]  It says, Navy sailor invokes Hillary Clinton defense and bid for clemency over classified photos.
[00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:37.519]  Now this former Navy submariner sent to prison for photographing his ship's classified engine compartments has filed a presidential clemency request arguing that President-elect Donald Trump should realize that sailor was a scapegoat amid the FBI probe into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified material.
[00:43:38.237 --> 00:43:44.642]  The paperwork was filed Monday with the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney, which will now conduct an investigation.
[00:43:45.262 --> 00:43:50.566]  The case of former Machinist Mate First Class Christian Saucier has become a cause célèbre for conservatives.
[00:43:51.027 --> 00:43:59.413]  They watched the young sailor go to prison for carelessness with classified information, while Mrs. Clinton avoided any punishment whatsoever from the Obama administration
[00:43:59.913 --> 00:44:08.295]  From the Director of the FBI and from the Attorney General Loretta Lynch, this shows you the political privilege that we've had in our government for quite some time.
[00:44:08.315 --> 00:44:21.398]  That a former First Lady, that a Secretary of State, someone who knows better, someone who's been in the government for this long, does know what that C means, does know what classified is, and she's sit and received those things on an unsecured email server.
[00:44:22.887 --> 00:44:36.430]  Meanwhile, this young submariner, this guy who was working on the USS Alexandria, took a cell phone out, took some pictures of his workplace where he was at on this nuclear submarine, and they stayed on his phone.
[00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.570]  He wasn't sharing them with Tehran.
[00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:45.071]  He wasn't sharing them with, you know, our enemies around the world to help bring down one of these submarines.
[00:44:45.171 --> 00:44:48.272]  No, he clearly just took some keepsake photos with his phone
[00:44:48.912 --> 00:45:14.413]  of this area to show maybe his mom or dad like hey look this is where I worked at this is what I did pretty cool huh you know a lot of people in the military do that they want to have pride in what they did they want to show their family members hey this is what I did you know you didn't get to see it all the time because I was out here on the submarine but check it out man I worked really hard I'm proud of what I did and now this guy is in jail he was sentenced back in August of this year
[00:45:14.873 --> 00:45:16.275]  For taking these pictures.
[00:45:16.335 --> 00:45:18.558]  Now he did plead guilty in a U.S.
[00:45:18.618 --> 00:45:28.211]  District Court to a charge of unauthorized retention of defense information and was sentenced to a year in prison for what he calls taking keepsake photos.
[00:45:29.176 --> 00:45:36.966]  And Saucier is now being represented pro bono by Jeffrey Atticott, a retired Army judge advocate who directs the Center of Terrorism Law at St.
[00:45:37.006 --> 00:45:39.369]  Mary's in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:45.537]  He seeks to help military service members whom he believes have been treated unfairly by the justice system.
[00:45:46.258 --> 00:45:48.420]  So this is the case.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.421]  You've got a guy who took some photos.
[00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.662]  He's going to jail.
[00:45:51.722 --> 00:46:00.868]  You've got Hillary Clinton who lied about Benghazi, who lied about coming under sniper fire, who lied about sending and receiving classified information.
[00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:04.611]  All this stuff came to light this year and yet she gets to walk.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.942]  Our only question is, will they lock her up?
[00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:16.367]  Will we finally see Donald Trump and his cabinet put this woman where she belongs?
[00:46:16.847 --> 00:46:18.388]  And that is behind bars.
[00:46:18.848 --> 00:46:19.789]  Lock her up!
[00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:21.010]  Lock her up!
[00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:22.191]  Lock her up!
[00:46:22.551 --> 00:46:23.451]  Lock her up!
[00:46:23.772 --> 00:46:24.672]  Lock her up!
[00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:27.394]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
[00:46:38.208 --> 00:46:44.894]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:46:45.155 --> 00:46:47.217]  You better believe you got one!
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.944]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.326]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:02.303]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.212]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a crazy week on the Hill.
[00:49:11.293 --> 00:49:14.795]  We've still got one more day left of this week, and then next week is the inauguration.
[00:49:14.855 --> 00:49:16.476]  It's surely only to get crazier.
[00:49:16.776 --> 00:49:21.399]  But today, some of the excitement was around Joe Biden's farewell.
[00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:27.042]  A speech was provided by Obama, and Joe Biden couldn't help but cry the entire time.
[00:49:27.502 --> 00:49:35.425]  Dick Durbin came out after an Intel briefing and went crazy about how serious the threats of cyber attacks from Russia are.
[00:49:35.805 --> 00:49:45.669]  Of course we had a Senate vote to gut a health care funding that would basically gut Obamacare and then of course the hearings for all of the Trump appointments went down as well.
[00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:49.571]  I'm joined by Leanne McAdoo and Maggie Howell to talk about all the craziness.
[00:49:49.851 --> 00:49:54.353]  Guys let's start with the vote today to repeal the health care law.
[00:49:54.813 --> 00:49:59.736]  Now they voted on a budget blueprint that's going to allow them to gut the health care bill.
[00:50:00.076 --> 00:50:01.496]  Maggie, what do you think this vote means?
[00:50:01.657 --> 00:50:04.178]  I think they're going to run up against some serious problems and here's why.
[00:50:04.218 --> 00:50:08.440]  The tax code is structured as such that makes it virtually impossible to repeal it.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.482]  They knew what they were doing in 2008 when they structured this thing, almost 9,000 pages long.
[00:50:13.522 --> 00:50:16.564]  I did a master's thesis over Obamacare and I can tell you it's convoluted.
[00:50:16.904 --> 00:50:22.568]  It's complicated, it's hefty, it's the number one purveyor and provider of abortions in this country under Planned Parenthood.
[00:50:22.588 --> 00:50:26.091]  They fund it through Obamacare and they have their work cut out for them.
[00:50:26.151 --> 00:50:26.772]  Here's what we know.
[00:50:26.792 --> 00:50:28.133]  Three confirmations this week.
[00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:30.494]  The power went out today on Capitol Hill.
[00:50:30.855 --> 00:50:35.398]  We've got Mattis Tillerson and Carson up for grabs.
[00:50:35.778 --> 00:50:39.081]  Sessions we saw on Monday brutalizing him, calling him a racist.
[00:50:39.121 --> 00:50:40.182]  Of course we know he's pro-life.
[00:50:41.102 --> 00:50:44.223]  Here's what's going on and the fact that they're trying to repeal Obamacare.
[00:50:44.263 --> 00:50:45.283]  We've got a week out.
[00:50:45.343 --> 00:50:46.564]  They're already putting this into place.
[00:50:46.584 --> 00:50:47.664]  They're going to have some hang-ups.
[00:50:48.084 --> 00:50:50.025]  But the good news is they're willing to do it.
[00:50:50.565 --> 00:50:51.745]  We've never seen this before.
[00:50:51.845 --> 00:50:53.226]  They're actually willing to do it.
[00:50:53.486 --> 00:50:53.746]  Yeah.
[00:50:53.886 --> 00:50:58.487]  Well, I think, like, let's all remember that this was the plan all along, this repeal plan.
[00:50:58.587 --> 00:51:01.628]  Even Hillary Clinton was found passing along these emails.
[00:51:02.228 --> 00:51:02.928]  I think so.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.200]  Yes.
[00:51:43.504 --> 00:51:52.030]  This actually made me very angry, and the fact is, not only Rand Paul, but President-elect Trump said that he supported what Rand Paul had to say.
[00:51:52.250 --> 00:52:01.076]  Well, this pushback and complete repudiation of the liberal establishment agenda is really actually freaking them out.
[00:52:01.116 --> 00:52:03.417]  We had them crying, doing gun sit-ins.
[00:52:03.918 --> 00:52:05.219]  They're doing more sit-ins.
[00:52:05.299 --> 00:52:05.859]  Jammy jams.
[00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:22.184]  The Jammy Jam sit-ins, but then actually today if you go back and you can watch the entire vote process for the repeal of the healthcare bill, every time a Democrat got up to vote no in order to keep the bill funded, they had to be called to order.
[00:52:23.103 --> 00:52:27.346]  Because they were out of line and they were speaking out of place during a vote.
[00:52:27.727 --> 00:52:30.529]  Every single one of them had to get the gavel because they were out of line.
[00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:34.512]  And then you have Donald Trump yesterday basically scolding CNN like an adult to a little child.
[00:52:34.532 --> 00:52:36.614]  Well, they got a virtue signal there on the floor.
[00:52:36.634 --> 00:52:37.594]  Like, oh, look at me.
[00:52:37.775 --> 00:52:38.735]  See, I don't want to repeal this.
[00:52:38.835 --> 00:52:40.316]  Even though that's been the plan the entire time.
[00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.597]  They want to go to single payer.
[00:52:41.818 --> 00:52:42.258]  Exactly.
[00:52:42.298 --> 00:52:44.160]  Let's not forget, Obamacare is bankrupt.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.862]  So in March, everyone's premiums are set to triple, not even double.
[00:52:47.882 --> 00:52:48.723]  They're set to triple.
[00:52:48.763 --> 00:52:52.346]  There was one microcosm that Health and Human Services did where
[00:52:52.706 --> 00:52:57.572]  An average person making $30,000 a year, their premium would skyrocket 116%.
[00:52:57.812 --> 00:52:59.674]  You're not going to be able to afford it anyway.
[00:52:59.734 --> 00:53:01.276]  I don't understand what the issue is.
[00:53:01.797 --> 00:53:04.400]  They don't want the socialized medicine scheme.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.821]  It's bankrupt.
[00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:07.603]  It doesn't work, people.
[00:53:07.704 --> 00:53:07.904]  It's over.
[00:53:07.924 --> 00:53:08.625]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:10.386]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:53:10.426 --> 00:53:12.907]  Not only is it unconstitutional, but it's not practical.
[00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:15.469]  It's changed our entire IRS tax code.
[00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:18.191]  And the brunt of it, I didn't have health insurance last year.
[00:53:18.211 --> 00:53:20.872]  I chose not to have it and just pay the fine.
[00:53:20.912 --> 00:53:26.536]  I think I had a $900 penalty on my federal income tax form because I chose to opt out of a system.
[00:53:26.816 --> 00:53:28.397]  We're talking, this is communism.
[00:53:28.417 --> 00:53:29.478]  This isn't even socialism.
[00:53:29.518 --> 00:53:30.438]  And there's another lie.
[00:53:30.478 --> 00:53:32.319]  They said there would be no fines.
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.101]  I paid that same fine.
[00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:35.842]  But moving on, okay.
[00:53:36.562 --> 00:53:46.474]  Also at the Hill this week, again it was crazy, the whining liberals, the rejection of the budget to fund Obamacare, just Dick Durbin in general is a sight, that guy.
[00:53:47.014 --> 00:53:48.776]  But you know, you talked about Jeff Sessions.
[00:53:49.097 --> 00:53:50.658]  Let's start with Jeff Sessions.
[00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:52.520]  This was a two day long hearing.
[00:53:53.201 --> 00:53:55.842]  And he got the most resistance of anyone else.
[00:53:55.902 --> 00:54:00.323]  Now, we still haven't heard from Betsy DeVos, Andy Puzder, or Nikki Haley.
[00:54:00.483 --> 00:54:01.703]  Those are still in the future.
[00:54:02.023 --> 00:54:04.764]  But Jeff Sessions took the most heat, the most resistance.
[00:54:05.004 --> 00:54:09.105]  There were even protesters, multiple protesters, that made their way into the hearing.
[00:54:09.765 --> 00:54:13.566]  He also got the most support from within other senators he'd worked with.
[00:54:13.866 --> 00:54:16.867]  But of course, he got the whole entire race thing.
[00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:19.507]  That was laid on heavy in day two.
[00:54:19.927 --> 00:54:21.788]  And the one who was really guilty
[00:54:22.188 --> 00:54:23.549]  Was Senator Cory Booker.
[00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:32.515]  Now this guy's all over the hill all week, crying about the liberal agenda, trying to carry this on, but he could not drop the Jeff Sessions is a racist talking point.
[00:54:32.615 --> 00:54:41.540]  And he had to let every single person who would hear know that it was unprecedented that he was going to be speaking against a fellow senator.
[00:54:42.101 --> 00:54:43.722]  And you know in the past... That's right, first time ever.
[00:54:43.982 --> 00:54:48.327]  Yeah, people in the past were putting out tweets where he's praising Jeff Sessions.
[00:54:48.387 --> 00:54:49.709]  Oh, I really enjoyed working with him.
[00:54:49.749 --> 00:54:50.690]  I think he's a great guy.
[00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:56.596]  And then now all of a sudden... So frankly, Cory Booker has his sights on running for the presidency coming up.
[00:54:56.656 --> 00:54:57.497]  That's what this is all about.
[00:54:57.517 --> 00:54:58.719]  Oh, good luck with that, buddy.
[00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:00.340]  I mean, this is what this is all about.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:06.704]  So it's all about the racist, you know, is he going to be able to, is he going to peel back a lot of these social policies that have been put in place?
[00:55:06.984 --> 00:55:09.626]  Let's look at the other attorney generals, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch.
[00:55:09.946 --> 00:55:17.191]  So have they been completely fair and not racially biased in a lot of their decisions when we had the Black Panthers?
[00:55:17.551 --> 00:55:23.373]  Well, we had the Black Panthers actually out there harassing and bullying with bats and clubs.
[00:55:23.813 --> 00:55:27.295]  White voters telling them if they didn't vote for Obama, they were going to get their head bashed in.
[00:55:27.755 --> 00:55:29.696]  And Eric Holder chose not to do it.
[00:55:29.816 --> 00:55:30.516]  Oh, that's fine.
[00:55:30.576 --> 00:55:31.696]  That wasn't voter intimidation.
[00:55:31.997 --> 00:55:37.079]  So obviously, you know, they're concerned that now someone's coming in that doesn't agree with them.
[00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:41.320]  Manchin actually said, you know, now some people say he's too conservative.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.261]  Well, some people are too liberal.
[00:55:43.581 --> 00:55:44.422]  And that's the thing.
[00:55:44.742 --> 00:55:51.367]  It's like they want it their way only, and they don't understand that more than half the country wants it a completely different way.
[00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:58.313]  Well, Cory Booker is a sympathetic person to a Muslim radical Islam agenda, Islamic agenda.
[00:55:58.373 --> 00:56:01.175]  And the fact of the matter is Jeff Session is no racist.
[00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:02.896]  And I'm sorry to yell, but this really upsets me.
[00:56:02.916 --> 00:56:04.317]  The fact that he's been painted and tarred.
[00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:08.221]  HuffPo feathered him, painted, tarred and feathered him as a racist.
[00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:09.682]  Too racist to be a federal judge.
[00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:10.883]  That simply is not true.
[00:56:11.423 --> 00:56:14.564]  And the fact that he's going to be the number one prosecutor in our country.
[00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:17.586]  They don't have the votes, by the way, to dismantle him.
[00:56:17.606 --> 00:56:19.467]  They're just trying to dirty him up as much as they can.
[00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:24.949]  He's a pro-life Christian, that's the problem, who doesn't want a mass influx of Islam into our country.
[00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:26.070]  Those are the two issues with him.
[00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:30.752]  The third issue would be that he potentially could prosecute, even though he said he's not going to touch it.
[00:56:31.132 --> 00:56:31.533]  I think so.
[00:56:47.936 --> 00:56:51.479]  Let's talk about a racist senator for a minute.
[00:56:51.539 --> 00:56:53.900]  It's not Jeff Sessions, folks.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.141]  I know they look similar.
[00:56:55.401 --> 00:56:56.842]  They speak in a similar dialect.
[00:56:56.862 --> 00:56:58.363]  They're completely different people.
[00:56:58.403 --> 00:56:59.924]  It's really upsetting to me.
[00:57:00.064 --> 00:57:04.688]  Well, and also, too, just wanted to point out, you know, where they're completely stuck on these social policies.
[00:57:04.968 --> 00:57:11.232]  So General James Mattis was being grilled on how he would deal with gays and women in the military.
[00:57:11.292 --> 00:57:16.816]  And he just said, you know, frankly, Senator, I've never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with.
[00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:22.002]  He's had hundreds of women fighting on the front lines under his command in the Iraq War.
[00:57:22.483 --> 00:57:29.051]  And he's just like, we need to stay focused on the military that's so lethal on the battlefield that it's going to make our enemies worse day when they come face to face with us.
[00:57:29.091 --> 00:57:30.653]  Let's stay focused on what really matters.
[00:57:30.673 --> 00:57:31.695]  We are so lucky to have him.
[00:57:31.735 --> 00:57:32.596]  High-heeled troops.
[00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:36.999]  We are lucky to have somebody like General Mattis, who actually would want the job for once.
[00:57:37.059 --> 00:57:39.721]  A general, a true person who has a heart for this country.
[00:57:40.241 --> 00:57:50.528]  And he was grilled shamelessly by Marco Rubio, to the point where Marco Rubio was asking him questions about Putin, trying to call Putin a dictator, a war criminal, if you will.
[00:57:50.848 --> 00:57:51.989]  I've got news for you, Marco Rubio.
[00:57:52.009 --> 00:57:52.869]  You're the war criminal.
[00:57:53.129 --> 00:57:58.713]  The mass military-industrial complex you ascribe to, the prisons that you built in Florida, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[00:57:58.733 --> 00:57:59.634]  That's a bigger question.
[00:58:00.034 --> 00:58:01.115]  The man was such a gentleman.
[00:58:01.195 --> 00:58:09.505]  He actually answered the questions with grace and elegance far more than I would because Marco Rubio, everybody knows who you are.
[00:58:09.545 --> 00:58:13.349]  Hopefully he's not going to get voted back over there in Florida.
[00:58:15.151 --> 00:58:15.271]  Yes.
[00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.783]  Um, and of course he got attacked by Elizabeth Warren.
[00:58:35.023 --> 00:58:38.745]  Elizabeth Warren also went after Betsy DeVos, so I'm sure a DeVos.
[00:58:39.045 --> 00:58:42.226]  I'm sure that she'll be going after her again when it's her time to be sworn in.
[00:58:42.466 --> 00:58:49.208]  But all this pushback with the Russia thing, all this pushback with the Democrats in the House, in the Senate, tells me they're not going to stop going after Trump.
[00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:50.709]  Thank you guys for joining me.
[00:58:50.769 --> 00:58:52.290]  Thanks everybody for tuning in out there.
