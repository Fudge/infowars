[00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:20.904]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:22.105]  I'm your host, Margaret Hall.
[00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:23.526]  It's Wednesday, January 11, 2017.
[00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:26.747]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.493]  Tonight, President-elect Donald Trump calls CNN fake news during a live press conference.
[00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:39.434]  President-elect, can you give us a question?
[00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:39.734]  Don't be rude.
[00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:40.314]  You're attacking us.
[00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.555]  Can you give us a question?
[00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:42.235]  Don't be rude.
[00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:43.356]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.276]  Can you give us a question?
[00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:45.257]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:45.937]  Can you stay categorical?
[00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:46.818]  You are fake news.
[00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.463]  Trump went on to say that the fake stream news media has destroyed lives, and all he wants is honest reporters.
[00:00:57.784 --> 00:00:58.964]  I've seen people destroyed.
[00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:02.246]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:04.007]  And I think it's very unfair.
[00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:06.969]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters.
[00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:13.692]  Meanwhile, BuzzFeed and CNN scrambled to defend themselves over the Golden Shower's backwash.
[00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:13.912]  F*** you!
[00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:14.433]  F*** you!
[00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:15.153]  F*** you!
[00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:16.314]  You're cool.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.279]  Well first I want to get to a very important piece for me.
[00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.600]  It looks like President-elect Donald Trump is putting RFK Jr.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.960]  ahead of a commission.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.102]  And this commission is highlighting vaccine safety.
[00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:17.622]  Now this has been a major issue for a lot of Americans.
[00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:22.284]  Approximately one in four American families deals with a child that is autistic.
[00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:23.224]  I think so.
[00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:47.319]  He's railed against the vaccine holocaust in this country.
[00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.660]  He's also a climate change advocate.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.362]  But that aside, it looks like he is the person to man this commission.
[00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:58.845]  And we could see Donald Trump taking on big pharma coming in the next 100 days.
[00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.107]  Now, I want to read you a direct quote from this article that we have up on our website.
[00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:04.168]  It aggregated from the Daily Mail.
[00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:10.692]  President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, to run a new commission on the safety of vaccines.
[00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:21.563]  He revealed his new role after a meeting with Trump in the Tower on Tuesday of this week, saying that Trump asked him to head the Commission on Vaccine Safety and Scientific Integrity.
[00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:24.086]  Now, we've covered here on InfoWars, and Alex has covered this.
[00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:32.535]  He's interviewed Rob Dew, our nightly news director, and our senior producer, Marcos Morales, about autism-related vaccine injury.
[00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:38.940]  And we've been covering this for the past two years, and it looks like Trump is taking on this issue head-on.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.542]  Now, in other news, I had to give you that first.
[00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:44.285]  It's been an epic day for Trump, let me tell you.
[00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:50.530]  The smackdown that happened with a CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, who's been trailing Trump for the past months.
[00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.552]  He's been trolling him, if you will, on Twitter.
[00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:53.933]  I've been following it.
[00:04:53.993 --> 00:05:02.221]  He's the journalist who famously tweeted out that photograph of Trump post-victory in a restaurant with his family, that private meeting.
[00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.763]  It was Gemma Costa who put that at the forefront.
[00:05:04.863 --> 00:05:11.910]  It looks like Trump has smacked down Gemma Costa, calling him fake news today, if you can believe it.
[00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.991]  This is going viral.
[00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:14.933]  We have a clip of that exchange.
[00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:15.814]  Take a look at it.
[00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:22.310]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.396]  As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.780]  Writing it?
[00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:31.162]  I think they're going to suffer the consequences.
[00:05:31.202 --> 00:05:31.922]  They already are.
[00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:36.304]  And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up?
[00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:38.546]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.586]  It's a disgrace.
[00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:42.168]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with.
[00:05:43.028 --> 00:05:44.289]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:45.089]  Can you stay categorical?
[00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:46.070]  You are fake news.
[00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.130]  Woo!
[00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.951]  That epic smackdown happening.
[00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:55.952]  CNN, the real fake news, the purveyors of fake media, they had the nerve to publish that dossier as fact.
[00:05:56.092 --> 00:06:01.393]  And he put the smackdown on Jim Acosta, trolling him in a press conference today.
[00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:04.214]  He took aim, calling CNN the real fake news.
[00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:07.675]  You know, we've been calling them out as fake news here for months and months on end.
[00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:08.435]  We're good.
[00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:29.067]  The unverified media misspelled names, misspelled words, and didn't bother to verify it at all.
[00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:37.952]  And even Russia has said that Trump's golden showers blackmail moment is, you know, that perverted romp story isn't true.
[00:06:38.012 --> 00:06:38.952]  It's fake news.
[00:06:39.313 --> 00:06:41.694]  But CNN nonetheless jumped on the bandwagon.
[00:06:41.914 --> 00:06:42.854]  And we have an article up.
[00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:47.357]  It's from the Daily Beast, who also circulated this ridiculous piece of nonsense.
[00:06:47.817 --> 00:07:03.108]  This unverified, salacious, 35-page document, a summary which was presented to Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week, includes those allegations that Russian operatives sought to, quote, exploit Trump's personal obsessions and sexual perversions.
[00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:06.110]  And it's my understanding that the U.S.
[00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.392]  intel community jumped on the bandwagon to
[00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.173]  You know what, if this is our U.S.
[00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:13.076]  intel community, we've got serious problems here, folks.
[00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:21.704]  And I don't mean with just the intel, because the fact that they jumped on this ridiculous BuzzFeed story, and they have a White House press pass.
[00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:22.925]  I just want to lay that out there.
[00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:29.812]  Barack Obama has given them a White House press pass, and they are actually the purveyors of fake news.
[00:07:30.152 --> 00:07:33.115]  They ran with this ridiculous story, and it turns out to be a hoax.
[00:07:33.615 --> 00:07:40.164]  There's a Zero Hedge article, this 4chan claims to have fabricated this Andy Trump report as a hoax, and guess what?
[00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:41.205]  Media and U.S.
[00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:46.131]  Intel, they fall for the Golden Shower hoax story, hook, line, and sinker.
[00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:47.293]  And you know what?
[00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:48.134]  I'm a reporter.
[00:07:48.154 --> 00:07:50.958]  I've been covering Trump for years, and I can just tell you right now,
[00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:55.401]  From my understanding, you know, he says he's a germaphobe.
[00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.583]  You know, this didn't ring true when I read it.
[00:07:57.703 --> 00:07:58.844]  I thought it was from The Onion.
[00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:06.090]  Turns out, the US intel community briefed him about it, and it is embarrassing, but he calls it out for what it is.
[00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.011]  Fake news.
[00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:14.737]  Speaking of news that, you know, the vitriol in which the left is going after Trump right now, it is ridiculous.
[00:08:14.797 --> 00:08:19.821]  Chuck Schumer leading the helm, and he's saying that the CIA, the intel communities, could
[00:08:20.922 --> 00:08:24.925]  Could actually be coming after Trump because Trump is telling the truth.
[00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:28.948]  I'm directly quoting here, Leon McAdoo and Owen Schroer reported on this yesterday.
[00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:31.230]  You take on the intel community.
[00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.692]  They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:08:34.093 --> 00:08:38.256]  That sounds like a direct threat to a president-elect, if you ask me.
[00:08:38.756 --> 00:08:42.039]  And frankly, it is an embarrassment all the way around.
[00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:45.362]  We understand that the CIA, there are rogue agents within it.
[00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:56.924]  And I'm of the belief that the head of the CIA is potentially behind this, because we understand that he had that intel meeting at Trump Tower this week, briefing him on the Russian hacking.
[00:08:57.344 --> 00:08:58.925]  What Russian hacking is he talking about?
[00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:04.446]  They should release that information to the American public, because as we know, you know what?
[00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:07.707]  Where there's smoke, there's fire, but there's no fire here and no smoke.
[00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.687]  It looks like they're blowing it up their own you-know-what.
[00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:14.248]  Now, speaking of one of Trump's sworn enemies, I took this from the Daily Mail.
[00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:14.988]  I don't
[00:09:29.514 --> 00:09:29.774]  I don't
[00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:49.616]  I don't understand.
[00:09:49.737 --> 00:09:51.679]  Is it a dementia aspect?
[00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.622]  What's going on with him and Lindsey Graham?
[00:09:53.642 --> 00:10:03.334]  You know, they're taking to the stage attacking with utter vitriol a sitting president-elect for, you know, he will be a sitting president come next week.
[00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:05.858]  And frankly, I am sick and tired of this crap.
[00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:10.262]  This Russian blackmail plot, it was featured in the Daily Mail.
[00:10:10.322 --> 00:10:23.514]  It looks like John McCain might be the person who actually handed over this garbage to the FBI, which, you know, the BuzzFeed news organization, if we can even call them that, has published along with the Daily Beast.
[00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:29.620]  Now, speaking of that, speaking of Russia, as someone who lived and worked in Russia as a foreign correspondent,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:39.206]  I understand somewhat how the thinking is behind this, and Putin himself and Russia, they're slamming this as nonsensical.
[00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:51.234]  They're claiming that this compromising info about Donald Trump, this perverted hooker romp that supposedly took place in Moscow where I lived, is utter garbage, and I would agree with that analysis.
[00:10:52.094 --> 00:11:06.189]  And speaking of, you know, the utter garbage aspect of it, BuzzFeed themselves, they misspelled Igor Sechin, who's a Russian foreign minister, he's a Russian minister rather, they misspell his name, they misspell a lot of aspects of the story.
[00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:07.791]  It doesn't ring true.
[00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:16.278]  And the fact that our own intel community and the media go hand-in-hand with trying to smear him ahead of his inauguration is embarrassing.
[00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.539]  Shame on you!
[00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:19.000]  Shame on you, Jim Acosta!
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.261]  Shame on you, CNN!
[00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:23.443]  And shame on you, you BuzzFeed organization!
[00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:30.069]  You know, Trump called you what you were today, a steaming pile of failed garbage, and I conclude with that analysis.
[00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:33.331]  You know, I don't know how BuzzFeed ever got a White House press pass.
[00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:37.254]  As far as I'm concerned, they are the real fake news, along with CNN.
[00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:44.619]  And our president stood firm and called them what they were today, which was very, very refreshing in my opinion.
[00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:55.306]  Now, you know, going back to Chuck Schumer for a moment, because I want to touch on his words, talking about how if you take on the intel community, they have six ways from Sunday to smear you and to hurt you.
[00:11:56.126 --> 00:12:00.729]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:12:01.289 --> 00:12:06.713]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:10.468]  You know, who is he to go on Rachel Maddow?
[00:12:10.568 --> 00:12:11.529]  Rachel Maddow!
[00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:13.952]  Don't get me started for a minute on Rachel Maddow.
[00:12:13.972 --> 00:12:26.325]  You know, the psychological aspects of this woman, I find it baffling, you know, just watching her sometimes, you know, the emotional makeup of her, how she can even hold herself together long enough to get through a show.
[00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:35.929]  Nonetheless, a segment, but it looks like they are the purveyors of fake news and Chuck Schumer leading the helm at that, basically threatening, outright threatening.
[00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:37.290]  There's no veil at this point.
[00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.311]  Donald Trump, our 45th president, saying that the CIA is coming after you.
[00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:50.834]  You know, folks, it doesn't get worse than this, but it looks like despite all of that, we have a wave of prosperity surfacing.
[00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.395]  I want to take you to this next article.
[00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:56.037]  It's coming out of the last refuge and we put it on our website.
[00:12:56.197 --> 00:13:01.160]  Deutsche Bank, which in my opinion covering them over the years, they're a globalist bank frankly.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.582]  They had a rash of suicides in the UK a couple of years ago because of information.
[00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:14.387]  It looks like however, they're predicting that Trump's economy will more than likely double the GDP, the US GDP growth in the coming years.
[00:13:14.807 --> 00:13:15.027]  I think?
[00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:38.203]  And under Obama, we've seen such a stagnation, we've seen such a repression, if you will.
[00:13:38.223 --> 00:13:43.084]  I'm hesitant to say a depression, but we've seen such a recession in the past eight years.
[00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:47.206]  They inflate the numbers, so we really actually don't know the numbers of unemployment.
[00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:55.468]  And we know one thing, that people are hurting, they're suffering, but it looks like a wave of prosperity is coming, folks, amid the fact that we have a rogue CIA.
[00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:59.710]  Thank God they're on their way out the door, and this Deutsche Bank
[00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.650]  I don't
[00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:22.655]  For the first time in a very, very, very long time, we're going to see a growth spurt in the U.S.
[00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:25.016]  and they're highlighting a forecast of 14 percent.
[00:14:25.376 --> 00:14:29.598]  I happen to think that number is greater, you know, but we'll have to wait and see.
[00:14:29.638 --> 00:14:35.240]  And I'm looking forward to covering this Trump presidency in the wave of prosperity that's coming.
[00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.962]  Now, we also have an article that's up on our website.
[00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.863]  It's from the Free Beacon and it talks about Obamacare.
[00:14:41.543 --> 00:14:47.109]  And as I mentioned before in the show, I come from a small business owner who employs eight people in Obamacare.
[00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:52.574]  What that's done to our small businesses in this country, it looks like it's just been absolutely devastating.
[00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:56.498]  But we have we have new renewed hope, if you will, on the Hill.
[00:14:56.998 --> 00:15:04.380]  Congress is saying that they're going to repeal Obamacare despite the ridiculous tax mangle, if you will.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.641]  58% of Americans say repealing Obamacare is important.
[00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:10.302]  It's more important to them than health care reform.
[00:15:10.322 --> 00:15:14.823]  Well, as we know, most Americans, they did not approve of Obamacare to begin with.
[00:15:14.903 --> 00:15:17.284]  When it passed, there were several questions surrounding it.
[00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:17.944]  And you know what?
[00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:24.866]  It looks like we're ushering in a new era here and we could see a total repeal and a health care system that works for
[00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:25.946]  All Americans.
[00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:28.848]  Well, be sure and join me coming up next in studio.
[00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:33.150]  Our own Millie Weaver joins us live talking about the inauguration.
[00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:49.178]  After eight years of enduring President Barack Obama's rampant hypocrisy, his final speech was nothing less than the great conclusion to the hyper normalization that characterized his presidency.
[00:15:49.618 --> 00:15:53.360]  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you can tell that.
[00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.900]  You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.
[00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:22.758]  If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse the Great Recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history, if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people,
[00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:26.954]  Shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
[00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.935]  Take out the mastermind of 9-11.
[00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:45.419]  If I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.140]  If I told you all that,
[00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:53.397]  You might have said our sights were set a little too high.
[00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.219]  But that's what we did.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.741]  After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America.
[00:17:05.102 --> 00:17:10.565]  And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic.
[00:17:12.926 --> 00:17:17.928]  Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
[00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:29.154]  Now I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.
[00:17:30.515 --> 00:17:39.319]  You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.
[00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:45.882]  For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today
[00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:51.060]  These newcomers embraced this nation's creed, and this nation was strengthened.
[00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:41.281]  It's that spirit, a faith in reason and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny, an order based not just on military power or
[00:18:42.563 --> 00:18:45.748]  National affiliations, but built on principles.
[00:18:46.229 --> 00:18:47.050]  The rule of law.
[00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:48.192]  Human rights.
[00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:52.458]  Freedom of religion and speech and assembly and an independent press.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.864]  An intolerance of dissent and free thought.
[00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:15.656]  Now, what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:16.856]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.497 --> 00:19:18.677]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.137 --> 00:19:22.339]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.

[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:08.052]  Welcome back.
[00:23:08.112 --> 00:23:09.212]  I'm your host, Margaret Hell.
[00:23:09.232 --> 00:23:15.275]  I'm joined in studio by the magnificent Millie Weaver, who is coming to you via Austin, Texas.
[00:23:15.315 --> 00:23:16.936]  Millie, we love having you in studio.
[00:23:17.076 --> 00:23:24.740]  She's going to the inauguration, folks, with Alex Jones and Rob Dew and Owen Schroyer are going to be in the ground covering those protests.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.301]  Any words of wisdom for people watching?
[00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:28.862]  How do you do it, Millie?
[00:23:28.902 --> 00:23:29.943]  That would be my question.
[00:23:30.923 --> 00:23:32.825]  Well, you know, it's very exciting.
[00:23:32.885 --> 00:23:34.646]  I'm excited to be here, first of all.
[00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:35.627]  This is awesome.
[00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:43.574]  Not only that, but I'm really excited to be going out to cover the inauguration in D.C., which is fast approaching.
[00:23:43.654 --> 00:23:46.076]  I feel like I couldn't be here fast enough.
[00:23:46.556 --> 00:23:51.000]  You know, there's going to be a lot of protests that are planned, as well as some pro-Trump
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:51.700]  I think so.
[00:24:08.883 --> 00:24:14.006]  You and I were talking off-camera and we were talking about the protest groups that actually were given clearance to protest.
[00:24:14.066 --> 00:24:17.107]  One of them is a women's group, as I understand it.
[00:24:17.167 --> 00:24:21.529]  I mean, that would be kind of a, not a no-brainer, but you kind of get why they would give them a pass.
[00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:23.430]  The other group, do you want to expound on it?
[00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.632]  You're going to be in the crowd talking to these protesters, I'm assuming, which I've watched you do.
[00:24:27.652 --> 00:24:33.635]  I often pen this on Twitter because I love it and it's something that I, you know, I have a hard time doing as a reporter.
[00:24:33.655 --> 00:24:37.037]  I've been doing this for years and when you go into a protest group, people are screaming
[00:24:37.557 --> 00:24:39.137]  You know, you do it with such grace.
[00:24:39.237 --> 00:24:42.898]  You're going to be doing that on the ground next week as well for InfoWars.
[00:24:43.638 --> 00:24:53.260]  Yeah, I mean, it can get a little bit nerve-wracking, especially when people start to recognize you as being associated with InfoWars and they're anti-Trump protesters.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.780]  And we have all these SJWs that could be easily triggered.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.681]  So, I mean, it's just very interesting.
[00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:05.282]  Not only that, but the fact that there is going to be a large women's group that's going to be protesting.
[00:25:05.682 --> 00:25:06.442]  Well, I find it a bit
[00:25:07.242 --> 00:25:16.367]  You know, ironic that you have all these women that are constantly talking about how, you know, Trump is against women and he's setting women back on women's rights.
[00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:33.077]  Well, you know, his daughter, Ivanka Trump, she came out and announced that they're actually working toward having paid maternity leave and doing a lot of things that are actually going to be better for women and set them farther ahead in their rights and making sure that their lives are good.
[00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:35.677]  I mean, it's pretty ridiculous.
[00:25:35.697 --> 00:25:36.277]  You're absolutely right.
[00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:38.718]  So she was a proponent of maternity leave.
[00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:42.279]  It's something that impacts so many women because you want to be able to have a baby.
[00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:43.979]  You want to be able to afford to have a baby.
[00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:49.080]  But then when you have a baby, you're forced to go immediately back to work and leave a small, tiny infant.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.540]  Obviously, I don't have kids yet.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.921]  I've not been blessed with a baby yet.
[00:25:51.941 --> 00:25:57.142]  But I will soon find out, hopefully, God willing, that you have to leave a baby.
[00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:59.322]  She's been a champion for women being able to have
[00:25:59.702 --> 00:26:11.708]  This federalized maternity leave that allows women to take advantage of tax money that they paid into a system, that it goes directly to them instead of, let's say, an immigration program that we don't agree with.
[00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:21.053]  You know, you actually have the ability to take on tax money that you wouldn't be able to use and stay at home with your baby longer, and especially if you're a breastfeeding mom.
[00:26:21.553 --> 00:26:22.893]  And I really like that about her.
[00:26:22.974 --> 00:26:25.555]  Also, Kellyanne Conway, a woman that led his campaign
[00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:33.239]  You talk about somebody, you know, they've been trying to paint Trump in the media as anti-gay, anti-African-American, anti-woman.
[00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.760]  Well, let's think about this.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.322]  He's appointed an African-American, Dr. Ben Carson, to head up HUD.
[00:26:39.042 --> 00:26:42.744]  His campaign manager was, in fact, a woman, led to his victory.
[00:26:42.784 --> 00:26:44.385]  She went to my alma mater, GW.
[00:26:44.766 --> 00:26:46.847]  And I really love that, that he picked a woman to do that.
[00:26:47.327 --> 00:26:51.030]  And Peter Thiel, who's been very influential, is a homosexual.
[00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:56.394]  So everything that the media is trying to paint about him, none of it's true, and yet they're still trying to do it.
[00:26:56.854 --> 00:27:02.978]  And we have this women's group that's now protesting him as if he doesn't have enough problems.
[00:27:02.998 --> 00:27:10.644]  You know, we cover the Antal community and what Chuck Schumer said in an earlier segment, that they were going to actually try to sabotage him and take him down.
[00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:11.825]  We've seen this fake story.
[00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:14.046]  I'm sorry for saying it.
[00:27:14.106 --> 00:27:15.226]  We talked about this off camera.
[00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:16.987]  Millie Weaver is such a lady.
[00:27:17.007 --> 00:27:19.648]  You know, we didn't even want to say the words golden shower.
[00:27:19.708 --> 00:27:21.568]  We're going to say them on air for you.
[00:27:21.588 --> 00:27:37.154]  But just trying to paint him in such a nasty and perverse way and so much opposition and really all he's trying to do is bring back jobs, make sure that the middle class America is sustained and we can feed our families and have prosperity and growth like we've never seen.
[00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:38.114]  Yeah.
[00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:41.196]  And, you know, and make sure that our borders are secure.
[00:27:41.216 --> 00:27:43.338]  And he has been relentlessly attacked for that.
[00:27:43.358 --> 00:27:45.780]  And I know you've come to the defense and the helm.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.201]  I love watching her reports.
[00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:52.584]  We're so honored to have her here because, you know, they're so fellow few women info warriors.
[00:27:52.624 --> 00:27:56.167]  Let me just tell you right now, it is a tough thing to be able to do it.
[00:27:56.907 --> 00:28:10.831]  With such beauty is also a challenge, you know, a lot of us are... It's definitely a tough thing, especially being a woman out covering these violent protests, like the one that I was just at not too long ago in Cleveland.
[00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:25.636]  So it's going to be interesting and given the fact that this woman's protest is supposed to be huge, I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot of other women there, but at the same time, we've all seen how violent some of these SJW women can be.
[00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:27.616]  You take it with grace!
[00:28:27.937 --> 00:28:30.277]  Millie takes it on the chin with grace.
[00:28:30.837 --> 00:28:41.260]  I've only done this a few times myself, being in a crowd with SJWs and having them spit on you and hurl profanity at you and talk to you like a non-human person.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.441]  We've covered that frequently.
[00:28:42.801 --> 00:28:44.881]  Owen Troyer does that really well too.
[00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:46.562]  I want to give a shout out to Owen.
[00:28:47.282 --> 00:28:53.805]  You know, he gets in the crowd of SGWs and he gets spit on and taunted and yet he keeps going and he's able to break through some of those lies.
[00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:55.585]  That is not an easy thing to do.
[00:28:56.146 --> 00:29:02.208]  Meanwhile, looking like a Victoria's Secret model who has just had a baby, I might add, that is really hard to do.
[00:29:02.228 --> 00:29:08.551]  You know, people take it for granted, but honestly, it is something that is just, you know, you're going to be doing this next week.
[00:29:08.571 --> 00:29:10.051]  We want to make sure people tune in.
[00:29:10.611 --> 00:29:12.132]  Alex is going to be in Washington, D.C.
[00:29:12.192 --> 00:29:14.593]  along with Millie Weaver, Millennial Millie.
[00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:22.358]  And Owen Troyer and our Nightly News Director Rob Diu, any highlights that you hope to have on camera, do you think?
[00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:30.904]  Well, basically, it's just basically what I want to talk about is how it's going to be an insane event.
[00:29:30.964 --> 00:29:37.308]  I mean, they have tons of, you know, violent protests planned and I really think that, you know, Donald Trump
[00:29:37.768 --> 00:29:50.759]  He called out the media today about their fake news and how they're constantly just spinning and telling lies and I'm so glad he did because I would, you know, have wanted to do it myself so I don't blame him.
[00:29:50.799 --> 00:30:05.291]  He's done it before at his past rallies but this one in particular was actually pretty awesome to see and you wouldn't have these violent protesters out there and these people hoarding the streets with anti-Trump protests if it weren't for
[00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:21.680]  The fake news, the mainstream media fake news outlets constantly spinning tons of fake news out there and false information which gives them a false impression that Donald Trump is this evil villain and they, you know, they compare him to Hitler, all these sound bites that basically the mainstream media
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:32.325]  Talking pundits routinely use it's just when you a lot of times when you talk to these protesters They're literally just speaking verbatim what they're hearing these news pundits say.
[00:30:32.465 --> 00:30:45.291]  They're lapdogs for an administration that has hated our country, you know Watching President Obama try to be relevant try to promote his legacy in these final days and cautioning us with a warning The democracy is in danger.
[00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:50.514]  You know, I literally I had tears in my eyes listening to those tears of joy last night listening to this ridiculous address
[00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:53.375]  Because for the first time, it's like, this is finally over.
[00:30:53.395 --> 00:31:01.177]  You know, we've seen this demonic narrative and, you know, it's just really, it's taken what's the truth and it's made it a lie.
[00:31:01.197 --> 00:31:07.359]  And for the first time, I'm actually, and I hate to sound like Michelle Obama, do you remember when she said, the first time I'm proud to be...
[00:31:07.719 --> 00:31:16.407]  I've been a proud American for all my life, but for the first time I'm proud to say that I support the ideas and the values of a president.
[00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:19.850]  And you're going to be on the ground, and I do not envy that.
[00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.973]  Leanne McAdoo and I are going to be on the desk covering this.
[00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:24.355]  She's going to be Skyping it.
[00:31:26.036 --> 00:31:26.636]  Honestly.
[00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:28.177]  That's where all the excitement is.
[00:31:28.277 --> 00:31:38.502]  It's really going to be exciting to be out there with the people and getting their take on it and how this event is going to be impacting them emotionally and everything else.
[00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:40.443]  Do you think that the other groups don't have the permits?
[00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:44.804]  Because you said that two groups have permits, so all the other ones presumably be erected?
[00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:44.985]  Yes.
[00:31:45.005 --> 00:31:48.706]  As far as, yes, the other groups don't seem to have permits.
[00:31:48.726 --> 00:31:49.727]  The only ones that do
[00:31:50.687 --> 00:31:54.148]  It's the Women's Rights Group as well as the Bikers for Trump group.
[00:31:54.568 --> 00:31:56.248]  Their permits have been approved.
[00:31:56.608 --> 00:32:18.532]  However, there are going to be a lot of other protest groups out there that are going to be being violent and, you know, breaking the law while they're out there and they don't have permits and they don't really care to have a permit because they're planning on basically exercising civil disobedience while at the same time, you know, we could see rioting and we could see all kinds of stuff going down.
[00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:20.594]  Isn't it shocking to see the anarchy?
[00:32:20.634 --> 00:32:28.263]  And it does for me, you know, looking at people like Don Lemon, who I don't understand how he's not working for Saudi Arabian television.
[00:32:28.303 --> 00:32:31.126]  I tweeted this to Jim Acosta, who was called out by Trump today.
[00:32:31.827 --> 00:32:38.654]  You know, how are you not working for a foreign press agent that doesn't believe in human rights because of how ridiculous you are?
[00:32:39.315 --> 00:32:41.336]  But honestly, Millie, we are running out of time.
[00:32:41.397 --> 00:32:48.021]  Be sure to catch the magnificent Millie Weaver on the ground reporting with Owen Schroyer live from the inauguration next week.
[00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.583]  Lee and McAdoo and I are going to be covering it in studio.
[00:32:51.003 --> 00:32:52.804]  You don't want to miss this coming up.
[00:32:53.245 --> 00:32:56.647]  Millennial Millie next week, along with Rob Dew and Owen Schroyer.
[00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:58.188]  All right.
[00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:03.472]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:03.492 --> 00:33:07.895]  And a lot of revolutionaries, Rob Banks, you name it, defend themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.150]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.

[00:37:08.146 --> 00:37:15.027]  Owen Schroyer joined by Leanne McAdoo and mainly we're going to be covering the presser that Donald Trump just held.
[00:37:15.348 --> 00:37:21.109]  First press conference since July 27th for Donald Trump and boy were there fireworks Leanne!
[00:37:21.449 --> 00:37:22.229]  Absolutely!
[00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:36.452]  I mean there was just kind of this explosive and unverifiable dossier that hit the internet last night just kind of took the world by storm and I'm almost wondering was this some sort of a psyop by BuzzFeed to just prove
[00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:45.417]  How quickly fake news can spread because they took fake news to a whole new level and a lot of people are kind of saying, well, why did Donald Trump respond?
[00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:46.517]  Why didn't he just ignore it?
[00:37:46.577 --> 00:37:51.640]  But no, you have to hit these people immediately, call them on their lies and their fake news.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.801]  Well, and that's amazing.
[00:37:52.821 --> 00:37:55.523]  You talk about, you know, was it BuzzFeed?
[00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:58.085]  Are they the ones that took this to the new level?
[00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:00.747]  Are they the ones that put all the fuel on this flame?
[00:38:01.367 --> 00:38:02.989]  Or was it 4chan?
[00:38:03.509 --> 00:38:05.510]  Or was it the intelligence communities?
[00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:07.452]  I think that I'm still kind of on the fence here.
[00:38:07.492 --> 00:38:10.034]  I'm not sure how this got to the point it was.
[00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:14.918]  I think everybody involved obviously had their hands all over this, but Donald Trump obviously responded.
[00:38:15.238 --> 00:38:16.619]  You were talking about this this morning.
[00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:17.480]  You were like, this is huge.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.220]  This is fake news.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:18.881]  It's catching on.
[00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:19.982]  The liberals are eating it.
[00:38:20.262 --> 00:38:21.643]  I can't believe that this is happening.
[00:38:21.843 --> 00:38:28.088]  Well, the reason why this is just so insane, and we're going to kind of give you a little precursor, kind of walk you back.
[00:38:28.108 --> 00:38:28.668]  Yeah, break this down.
[00:38:28.688 --> 00:38:31.050]  Give me the chronology here as we got to this press conference.
[00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.313]  Yeah, there's a little chronological timeline to this before we go to the press conference.
[00:38:34.933 --> 00:38:40.638]  But it's just incredible because even on talk radio here this morning, they're talking about this dossier as if it's real.
[00:38:41.138 --> 00:38:48.044]  Even though BuzzFeed said specifically this is unverifiable, they have no way really to check these allegations.
[00:38:48.844 --> 00:38:54.809]  And so what happened, this was apparently some intelligence report that had been floating around for months.
[00:38:55.449 --> 00:38:59.492]  It was being collected by a former British intelligence officer who was
[00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:09.161]  Being paid by people, first the Republicans against Trump and then the Democrats, the DNC, who are wanting to just collect some intel on Donald Trump and take him out.
[00:39:09.522 --> 00:39:15.107]  But this stuff was so unverifiable, so explosive, the New York Times was sitting on it for a few months.
[00:39:15.187 --> 00:39:17.509]  They didn't even want to go there because they couldn't verify it.
[00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:20.312]  It was basically fake news to them, unverifiable.
[00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:28.415]  So then CNN reports on the two page intelligence report that Donald Trump as well as Obama received last week.
[00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:38.139]  They're reporting on this and really talking about these deep ties to Russia that were supposedly shown to Donald Trump in this meeting, in this briefing.
[00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:41.601]  Well, I guess not to be outdone, BuzzFeed
[00:39:42.341 --> 00:40:01.836]  Publishes the full 35 page report and you know the BuzzFeed Ben, Ben Smith, who I guess is kind of in charge, he sent out this email to his employees saying, you know, as you've probably seen, this evening we published a secret dossier making explosive and unverified allegations about Donald Trump and Russia.
[00:40:02.457 --> 00:40:05.419]  I wanted to briefly explain to you how we made the decision to publish it.
[00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:08.801]  So basically he goes on to explain to his news team
[00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:10.443]  That's right.
[00:40:39.902 --> 00:40:42.564]  That's why the New York Times didn't even want to go with this report.
[00:40:43.045 --> 00:40:51.010]  So they're saying BuzzFeed, Ben is saying, you know, he wants to be transparent in our journalism and share what we have with our readers, always aired on the side of publishing.
[00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:59.317]  And so basically they said that they wanted to put this out there and then let America decide if it's real or not, which is essentially the same thing that WikiLeaks says.
[00:40:59.397 --> 00:41:04.660]  But as we pointed out, WikiLeaks is using actual verified, authentic information.
[00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:12.845]  So now this is totally backfired on them because there is no way that they're able to kind of check and see.
[00:41:13.225 --> 00:41:19.949]  They actually admit that it's that it that there's serious reason to doubt the allegations.
[00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:23.611]  So in other words, there's almost certainly fake news contained within this.
[00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:26.232]  So they're saying we should definitely doubt this.
[00:41:26.312 --> 00:41:27.093]  But here you go.
[00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:27.693]  Here it is.
[00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:30.295]  And and Smith writes.
[00:41:31.115 --> 00:41:40.698]  So this is like in December 2016, he's saying, fake news will become more sophisticated and fake, ambiguous and spun up stories will be spread widely.
[00:41:41.698 --> 00:41:42.438]  So what does he do?
[00:41:43.518 --> 00:41:46.779]  Puts out a fake news, spun up story that can't be verified.
[00:41:47.059 --> 00:41:48.520]  They know they're going to get clicks on it.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.221]  At the time I printed this out, there was about three and a half million views and shares on this.
[00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:55.181]  So it's being spread far and wide.
[00:41:55.822 --> 00:41:56.762]  And like I said,
[00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:59.523]  Talk radio is saying that this is real, this is legit.
[00:41:59.963 --> 00:42:03.285]  So I kind of want to just take everyone back about a week and a half ago.
[00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:10.189]  We played this video where Chuck Schumer was on the Rachel Maddow Show and she's saying, Donald Trump, how dare he?
[00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:12.450]  He's going against the intelligence community.
[00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.833]  We have these 17 intelligence agencies all verifying that Russia interfered in our election.
[00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:19.113]  So I want to play this.
[00:42:19.413 --> 00:42:26.157]  Remember what Chuck Schumer said to Donald Trump about him being really dumb, doubting the intelligence community.
[00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:28.632]  It hasn't been delayed.
[00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:34.276]  But he's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[00:42:34.296 --> 00:42:39.339]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:42:39.919 --> 00:42:45.363]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.485]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated to?
[00:42:48.505 --> 00:42:55.050]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:42:56.836 --> 00:43:00.538]  Six ways to Sunday to get back at you if you go against the intelligence community.
[00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:03.539]  So that's what Donald Trump has his presser today.
[00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:05.981]  He said there's no reason that this should have been leaked.
[00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:07.241]  It's unverifiable.
[00:43:08.022 --> 00:43:10.103]  And that's it.
[00:43:10.383 --> 00:43:14.665]  It wasn't leaked by probably Obama or Donald Trump or anyone who was actually in that room.
[00:43:14.685 --> 00:43:15.685]  It was someone else.
[00:43:16.106 --> 00:43:21.368]  And John McCain came out and said, yes, I'm the one that handed this to the FBI and James Comey several months ago.
[00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:24.630]  But even the FBI was like, this sounds like fake news.
[00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:33.837]  Um, so now one of the things that was immediately debunked, Michael Cohen, they say Trump's attorney apparently took this trip to Prague.
[00:43:34.097 --> 00:43:38.220]  Well, he says, immediately tweets out, I've never been to Prague.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.203]  He shows a picture of his passport, never been to Prague.
[00:43:41.563 --> 00:43:48.729]  So then see, uh, Jake Tapper comes out today and says, government sources have confirmed that it was a different Michael Cohen who went to Prague.
[00:43:49.269 --> 00:43:54.713]  So in one day, they were able to verify that that part of this report was absolutely fake news.
[00:43:54.753 --> 00:43:59.777]  But for all these months that this was floating around, BuzzFeed wasn't able to verify, was this Michael Cohen?
[00:43:59.797 --> 00:44:03.419]  Because that would have been kind of a, you know, kind of a slam dunk right there.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:10.645]  But one of the allegations in this report is that, and I know, you know, family show out there, but this is what's in this report.
[00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.366]  One of the allegations is that Donald Trump
[00:44:14.227 --> 00:44:23.474]  Trump went to the Ritz Carlton and he paid Russian prostitutes to pee on a bed that was once slept in by Barack and Michelle Obama.
[00:44:23.634 --> 00:44:30.018]  So this is one of the allegations that he has paid these Russian hookers to a golden shower is what it's called.
[00:44:30.038 --> 00:44:35.182]  So that's why this just went viral and you might have seen that trending on Twitter.
[00:44:35.482 --> 00:44:39.645]  That's what all the talk radio shows are talking about that Trump likes golden showers and all of this.
[00:44:40.666 --> 00:44:50.561]  Totally unverified and explosive and dubious and you probably shouldn't believe it, but it forced Donald Trump to kind of call out CNN in this presser today.
[00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:56.029]  Absolutely just dangerous as well, but like we said, it's all about getting those clicks.
[00:44:56.209 --> 00:44:58.369]  Well, here was the amazing thing about this to me.
[00:44:58.449 --> 00:45:08.311]  Now, BuzzFeed Ben even said that he believes, now you said he mentioned, oh well, we have serious reasons to doubt this, we're going to put it out anyway.
[00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:12.412]  And then he says, this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.
[00:45:12.912 --> 00:45:15.233]  So I'm not sure what exactly he means by that.
[00:45:15.293 --> 00:45:17.653]  If he means, well we're just going to put anything out now.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:17.953]  Right.
[00:45:18.113 --> 00:45:19.514]  We're just going to report fake news.
[00:45:19.774 --> 00:45:20.914]  The job of reporters is to...
[00:45:21.974 --> 00:45:25.676]  BuzzFeed wanted to be one of the watchdogs of fake news.
[00:45:25.937 --> 00:45:27.357]  Now you're putting out fake news.
[00:45:27.377 --> 00:45:29.198]  The whole fake news thing has totally failed.
[00:45:29.298 --> 00:45:30.759]  Washington Post had to admit that.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:47.529]  But, you know, this Golden Shower thing, Leigh-Anne, now, when you sent this to me this morning, you said, we need to shoot a segment on the fake news, the Golden Showers, and I didn't know what was going on, so I went on to Twitter to look at this.
[00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:49.190]  Here's what I can't believe.
[00:45:50.032 --> 00:45:54.713]  Every Trump hater, every liberal, literally fell for this.
[00:45:54.733 --> 00:45:54.713]  100%.
[00:45:54.753 --> 00:46:06.996]  100%.
[00:45:55.273 --> 00:46:06.996]  I'm on Twitter and all I'm seeing is, oh, Donald Trump likes golden showers, this, that, and the other thing from every angle, and I'm sitting here like, what is this nonsense?
[00:46:07.016 --> 00:46:11.096]  To be fair, Donald Trump does have like a golden bathroom, so maybe he does, you know?
[00:46:11.657 --> 00:46:12.937]  He's got gold in the shower.
[00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:20.219]  Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[00:46:20.459 --> 00:46:20.879]  Go ahead.
[00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:22.440]  No, Mr. President-elect.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:22.941]  Go ahead.
[00:46:22.961 --> 00:46:25.683]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization... No, not you.
[00:46:25.743 --> 00:46:25.943]  Not you.
[00:46:25.963 --> 00:46:26.784]  Can you give us a chance?
[00:46:26.804 --> 00:46:27.464]  Your organization is terrible.
[00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:28.965]  You are attacking our news organization.
[00:46:28.985 --> 00:46:29.626]  Your organization is terrible.
[00:46:29.646 --> 00:46:31.367]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[00:46:31.427 --> 00:46:31.747]  Go ahead.
[00:46:31.767 --> 00:46:33.449]  Sir, can you state... Quiet.
[00:46:33.469 --> 00:46:33.589]  Quiet.
[00:46:33.609 --> 00:46:35.190]  Mr. President-elect, can you state categorically... Go ahead.
[00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.970]  She's asking a question.
[00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.271]  Don't be rude.
[00:46:36.291 --> 00:46:37.672]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[00:46:37.692 --> 00:46:38.012]  Don't be rude.
[00:46:38.032 --> 00:46:38.612]  You are attacking us.
[00:46:38.893 --> 00:46:39.833]  Can you give us a question?
[00:46:39.853 --> 00:46:40.814]  Don't be rude.
[00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:41.455]  Can you give us a question?
[00:46:41.475 --> 00:46:42.595]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:46:42.615 --> 00:46:43.576]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:45.237]  Can you state categorically... You are fake news.
[00:46:45.378 --> 00:46:45.538]  Sir...
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.291]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:13.009]  Well, Chelsea Manning, the army soldier in 2010 who was found guilty of leaking classified information to Wikileaks.
[00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:21.621]  If you recall, he was thrown the buck, charged with 35 years for leaking that information, shedding some light over how the U.S.
[00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:23.944]  conducts its military operations specifically in Iraq.
[00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:26.946]  I'm joined now by Leanne McAdoo in studio.
[00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:28.527]  We're going to be talking about Chelsea Manning.
[00:49:28.887 --> 00:49:33.088]  He is now seeking clemency from Barack Obama in his final days of office.
[00:49:33.528 --> 00:49:34.429]  Could he see it?
[00:49:34.509 --> 00:49:44.993]  And why would Barack Obama do this, considering that he has been harder on any leaker in presidential history, prosecuting more whistleblowers than anybody we've seen?
[00:49:45.313 --> 00:49:50.315]  I'm baffled, Leanne, as to why Chelsea Manning would be petitioning Barack Obama.
[00:49:50.335 --> 00:49:53.196]  It looks like he'd have more chance under Trump, in my opinion.
[00:49:53.516 --> 00:49:57.657]  Well, you know, a lot of people are kind of playing on President Obama's heartstrings here.
[00:49:58.077 --> 00:50:04.219]  Of course, when this news first came out, President Obama misspoke, as he says, and said, you know, he's guilty.
[00:50:04.519 --> 00:50:05.079]  It's treason.
[00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:06.199]  He broke the law.
[00:50:07.239 --> 00:50:11.881]  And of course, you know, at that time, it's bad for the president to make that kind of a call.
[00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:21.383]  Chelsea Manning hadn't been convicted of any crime at the time, so here he is, the Commander-in-Chief, who is now basically saying, this person's guilty.
[00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:22.223]  I don't
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.721]  I think so.
[00:50:52.853 --> 00:51:01.138]  So Chelsea Manning had been given a 35-year sentence for leaking this classified material.
[00:51:01.479 --> 00:51:07.362]  This is about 10 times longer than what most recent whistleblowers have had to endure.
[00:51:07.382 --> 00:51:15.848]  A lot of people say that the reason why the judge handed down such a harsh punishment, which they say, frankly, the leaks by Manning pale in significance,
[00:51:16.648 --> 00:51:17.308]  We're good to go.
[00:51:42.475 --> 00:51:48.299]  This was 700,000 military files and diplomatic cables that were given to WikiLeaks at the time.
[00:51:48.859 --> 00:51:56.785]  And Chelsea Manning says that she did it because she just wanted the American people to see the truth of war, what's really happening there on the ground.
[00:51:57.825 --> 00:52:03.009]  Some of the things, the Baghdad airstrike that was released, they called the airstrike video collateral murder.
[00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:07.272]  It showed two American helicopters firing on a group of 10 men.
[00:52:08.372 --> 00:52:16.980]  In Baghdad two of those were Reuters employees who were there to photograph an American Humvee under attack and the pilots mistook their cameras for weapons.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.543]  So it's just kind of a lot of collateral damage that was exposed here.
[00:52:21.223 --> 00:52:24.967]  But Chelsea Manning said she felt that this was stuff that was already in the public record.
[00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:43.827]  And it was it's something that should that type of information belongs to the American people and to the world because this is a part of our history which surprisingly is the exact same thing that Julian Assange has said recently with regards to giving $30,000 cash to anyone that is caught destroying
[00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:51.753]  Anyone that catches the Obama administration destroying records, because he says this belongs to the American people and to the world at large.
[00:52:51.773 --> 00:52:52.233]  Right.
[00:52:52.393 --> 00:52:56.336]  So interesting that you, you know, you point out why would Obama do this?
[00:52:56.876 --> 00:53:03.181]  Because he's been so harsh on whistleblowers and also so harsh on WikiLeaks, what we're seeing presently.
[00:53:03.821 --> 00:53:09.965]  They wanted to list Assange as a high tech terrorist and say it's a, you know, a terrorist organization.
[00:53:10.345 --> 00:53:13.808]  We had Bob Beckel and others calling for Assange's assassination.
[00:53:15.389 --> 00:53:28.304]  We've seen even on Infowars where Alex Jones has interviewed the likes of Bill Binney for example, the NSA whistleblower who wasn't given nearly a harsh sentence as Chelsea Manning and you touched on that beautifully.
[00:53:28.324 --> 00:53:29.766]  Chelsea Manning, what he was trying to do was
[00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:37.330]  Release the fact, and he put it on the Lady Gaga CD, and the crassness of the exposure was a key part of his trial.
[00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:42.393]  You know, as a reporter, I covered his trial, and I remember, you know, specifically what he had leaked.
[00:53:42.413 --> 00:53:44.875]  He was trying to leak the fact that we killed innocent people.
[00:53:44.895 --> 00:53:46.036]  That was the bottom line.
[00:53:46.176 --> 00:53:51.339]  And the narrative at the time under the administration was that these were hostile combatants.
[00:53:51.379 --> 00:53:53.040]  They were not, in fact, hostile combatants.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.902]  They were innocents, and two of them reporters that were fired upon.
[00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:59.544]  And that's a very sticky situation because it highlights
[00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:00.104]  I think so.
[00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:35.195]  Specifically, just to highlight some of this case, he talked about being a homeless person, and he said that he's really never had the chance to have a life, that he spent most of his life homeless or in the army, and he just wants the opportunity to live with his clemency.
[00:54:35.335 --> 00:54:41.137]  I don't see Barack Obama doing this, namely because he has been one of the foremost presidents who has been the harshest.
[00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:43.458]  He's expanded prison like we've never seen before.
[00:54:43.478 --> 00:54:45.498]  He's expanded the powers of the NSA.
[00:54:45.858 --> 00:54:48.059]  He's expanded the spying apparatus that we've had.
[00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:48.879]  I don't.
[00:55:07.405 --> 00:55:09.466]  Someone who tells the truth, and we shouldn't punish that.
[00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:21.111]  Specifically, and I wanted to highlight an aspect of this, in Manning's case, the 60 days that falls after Obama leaves office, there's no indication from the administration that they're going to speed up this response, although there is some leeway there.
[00:55:21.131 --> 00:55:32.937]  You know, if he doesn't receive the clemency and he has to serve out the remaining of the 35-year sentence six years in, you know, what does this say to people who tell the truth, specifically in our intel community,
[00:55:33.257 --> 00:55:34.437]  Trump's under fire right now.
[00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:39.098]  The intel community is pummeling him six ways from Sunday, according to Schumer.
[00:55:39.598 --> 00:55:48.000]  You'd think that he would show some mercy, you know, in cases like this where people just want to tell the truth, regardless of the motivation of Manning at the time.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:48.180]  Right.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:53.200]  Well, this is nothing like what Edward Snowden released to WikiLeaks or leaked to WikiLeaks.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.641]  This wasn't putting the nation in danger.
[00:55:55.661 --> 00:56:01.942]  This was stuff that he, you know, gave these directives, you know, wait 180 days before you post this so no one can
[00:56:02.882 --> 00:56:04.943]  No one will know where we are or who the leaker is.
[00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:09.805]  So they weren't putting national security at risk, but they still say WikiLeaks, of course, is.
[00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:14.047]  But it's interesting because Edward Snowden is pleading with Obama, free Chelsea Manning.
[00:56:14.147 --> 00:56:15.428]  It's the only thing that can save her life.
[00:56:15.468 --> 00:56:23.832]  Of course, she's tried to commit suicide twice, and she's going on a hunger strike in a bid to get this gender reassignment surgery, which, of course, the taxpayers are going to pay for.
[00:56:23.852 --> 00:56:24.412]  I guess that
[00:56:24.952 --> 00:56:25.973]  You get that if you go to prison.
[00:56:41.992 --> 00:56:46.216]  If they want to make that trade, because of course they would love to take Julian Assange down.
[00:56:46.256 --> 00:56:48.057]  They've made no bones about it.
[00:56:48.158 --> 00:56:53.062]  Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have called for Wikileaks to be registered as a terrorist organization.
[00:56:53.442 --> 00:56:55.284]  They consider him a high-tech terrorist.
[00:56:55.864 --> 00:57:03.031]  Again, Bob Beckel went on to call him a treasonous traitor, and he famously said, just shoot the son of a bee.
[00:57:03.051 --> 00:57:04.652]  A dead man can't leak stuff.
[00:57:05.313 --> 00:57:07.455]  And Karl Rove described Wikileaks
[00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.236]  We're good to go.
[00:57:27.878 --> 00:57:34.804]  While he was held at Fort Bradley, you know, the presumed assaults that he was facing, you know, he would look very different in court.
[00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:36.465]  You know, they wouldn't even photograph him in court.
[00:57:36.485 --> 00:57:47.634]  They would do an artist's sketch because of the summation that he was, in fact, brutally assaulted, potentially sexually assaulted, you know, subjugated to horrific abuse.
[00:57:47.674 --> 00:57:49.155]  That was the speculation as a reporter.
[00:57:49.175 --> 00:57:52.878]  It was very difficult to cover his treatment regardless of the fact.
[00:57:53.158 --> 00:57:57.181]  But looking at the bottom line here, folks, we're talking about a man who shed some light on the Iraq War.
[00:57:57.601 --> 00:57:57.661]  Yes.
[00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:27.981]  I think so.
[00:58:43.608 --> 00:58:50.233]  And I'm of the belief that Assange is a hero of sorts because he has tremendously aided in the information that we have.
[00:58:50.253 --> 00:58:51.333]  Well that's going to do it for us.
[00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:54.595]  It was a pleasure having Leanne and shedding some light on this case.
[00:58:54.655 --> 00:58:58.318]  Be sure to tune in to InfoWars for more reports just like this.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.723]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
