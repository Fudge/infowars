[00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:25.756]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:37.622]  Tonight, now the Prague Left and the paid AstroTurf protesters are taking their threats, intimidation, and violence to local town hall meetings.
[00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:46.568]  Then, manufacturer Vizio will pay two and a half million dollars to settle allegations they secretly tracked consumers and sold the information they gathered.
[00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:49.470]  And Maxine Waters is at it again.
[00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:56.047]  What is Aleppo?
[00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:57.628]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:12.637]  He is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:13.118]  Stop it.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:07.522]  Well just when you think perhaps the fear-mongering is going to end, MSNBC turns it up a notch again.
[00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:16.968]  This is in response to Donald Trump saying that the USA is not so innocent when it comes to killing people overseas.
[00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:26.474]  He said that the US has done some nasty things in the past, of course, when Donald Trump was asked about President Vladimir Putin saying, you know, he's killed journalists in the past.
[00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:32.419]  So Donald Trump kind of turned them around on that and said, listen, the CIA specifically is not so innocent.
[00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:41.266]  So MSNBC's Katie Tour says, you know what, maybe is Donald Trump going to start killing journalists?
[00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.448]  So this is a suggestion she's making.
[00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:51.935]  She says, as we know, there, since 2000, there's been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia who came out against the government there.
[00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:59.262]  Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and his distaste for any news that doesn't agree with him here.
[00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:02.646]  Do you find that this is a dangerous path he's heading down?
[00:04:03.207 --> 00:04:08.633]  Oh, he's heading down the path of taking out his enemies there in the journalism world?
[00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:23.312]  Now, mind you, these are the same people, CNN specifically, who called anyone who even talked about Michael Hastings' death, were conspiracy theorists, or Gary Webb, for instance, was also assassinated, taken out, very suspicious death there.
[00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:26.096]  But anyone who questioned those deaths,
[00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:29.099]  You're a conspiracy theorist, you're absolutely crazy.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.650]  But now, they're suggesting that any of these suspicious deaths in Russia are actually assassinations being carried out by Vladimir Putin.
[00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.758]  And let's also not forget, these are the same journalists, for instance, that have been calling for President Donald Trump's assassination.
[00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:55.080]  Okay, in a now-deleted tweet, we have a Times columnist and author, India Knight, saying the assassination is taking such a long time.
[00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:58.321]  That tweet, of course, has been deleted after the backlash.
[00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:03.023]  We talked about the Irish mainstream media calling for a Trump assassination.
[00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:08.224]  They actually had a picture of him on the magazine, debating whether or not he should be taken out.
[00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:11.225]  Of course, they ultimately decided, you know, why not?
[00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:14.166]  You know, he doesn't need... They ultimately, because they're so...
[00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:18.989]  Liberal and loving decided that he didn't deserve to die.
[00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:29.176]  And also, the Secret Service is having to deal with some 12,000 plus tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump online.
[00:05:29.717 --> 00:05:42.586]  And let's not forget, Chuckie Schumer saying that the CIA has six ways to Sunday to deal with a President Trump who dared question the intelligence agencies, okay?
[00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:52.956]  Here again, we have a case of the left blaming President Trump or his supporters for the exact same things that they themselves are guilty of.
[00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:56.800]  Saying that President Trump is the violent one, his supporters are the violent ones.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.265]  For instance, we've got a leftist fight club taking place.
[00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:03.947]  This is coming out of campus reform.
[00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:07.671]  They're training students at the University of Central Florida
[00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:16.745]  They're holding a workshop, the Knights for Socialism, holding a workshop to teach left-wing students how to bash the fash.
[00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:18.746]  It's a leftist fight club.
[00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:21.687]  It's open to everyone but Republicans.
[00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:27.969]  And so this poster, this Facebook event page says, in response to the record number of hate crimes against Latinx
[00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:55.757]  Immigrants, Muslims, women, the LGBTQIA plus community, Jews, Africans, African Americans, and other minorities, since the rise of Donald Trump, they're going to give these series of self-defense clinics for anyone who wants to bash the fact, but not if you are a member of any of those minority groups who just so happen to support Trump, or if you're a conservative member of the LGBT community, or a conservative immigrant, or a conservative Muslim,
[00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.376]  You are not welcome here.
[00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:05.399]  And also, let's not point out the fact, let's not forget that these were all hate crime hoaxes that have been happening across the country.
[00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.840]  Meanwhile, they will ignore the actual women who have been attacked.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.703]  Or, just like we interviewed a woman who was attacked at UC Berkeley, who was a member of the LGBT community.
[00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.464]  She was attacked, pepper sprayed in the face.
[00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:26.146]  She's not allowed to defend herself because she doesn't agree with this leftist ideology.
[00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:37.858]  So again, with the fear-mongering, they're basically also really saying that Donald Trump, because he's elected, sexual violence against women is going to skyrocket in the next 12 months.
[00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:42.343]  So again, just total fear-mongering, total warped version of reality.
[00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:46.808]  But if you're a conservative woman, a pro-life woman, don't bother showing up.
[00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:55.512]  And these are the same people, in their own words, this anti-Trump resistance, they want to make America ungovernable.
[00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:57.473]  And they're willing to do whatever it takes.
[00:07:57.513 --> 00:08:00.234]  So these are choreographed chants, acts of violence.
[00:08:00.674 --> 00:08:06.276]  The leaders of this anti-Trump resistance efforts, they're communicating the same simple but dark message.
[00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:10.657]  They want to make America ungovernable for the President of the United States.
[00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:15.439]  They are willing to destroy public property, assault law enforcement officers, and inflict
[00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.821]  Violence upon their fellow citizens.
[00:08:18.422 --> 00:08:22.065]  Disrupt J-20 advocates use direct action tactics.
[00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:29.672]  The group describes those as taking collective action to make social change without giving power over to an authority or a middle person.
[00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:30.994]  We don't ask permission.
[00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:33.255]  Or put our faith in electoral politics.
[00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:38.538]  Instead, we use our bodies to stop the smooth operation of the system we oppose.
[00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:41.620]  And of course, we've been seeing this taking place all across the country.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.122]  And, you know, the Democrats, the left, they really want to tout this as a grassroots effort.
[00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:51.245]  People are just rising up when we've already shown how these efforts are not grassroots at all.
[00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:53.366]  They're being funded by billionaires.
[00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:58.369]  And, you know, the left, as well, is exploiting these people
[00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:11.089]  These young people who are following the footsteps of the Red Guards, who too thought that they would rise up and take out their oppressors and then they would be the new leaders.
[00:09:11.369 --> 00:09:18.174]  And then of course what happened, Mao Zedong, as soon as he was done letting them do all the dirty work, he either killed them or had them banished.
[00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:24.058]  And that's exactly what's going to happen to these little Antifa fascists and all of these people who think that
[00:09:24.778 --> 00:09:27.780]  You know, their activism is going to put the power back in their hands.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.862]  President Trump's already said he wants to put the power back to the people.
[00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:35.605]  But the Democrats have totally got these people thinking that they are on their side.
[00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:41.669]  So what we're seeing is that these liberal activists are actually getting pretty violent and bold now.
[00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:45.792]  They're a completely different type of protest and activism than in the past.
[00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:50.035]  Republican lawmakers are facing rising anger at their town halls.
[00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:51.496]  They're being chased down alleys.
[00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:53.077]  They're going directly to their homes.
[00:09:55.218 --> 00:10:08.628]  And one of the things that you hear Democracy, the president of Democracy Alliance, which is an influential network of liberal activist groups, is saying, you know, how encouraging it is to see all these grassroots efforts, people rising up.
[00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:17.055]  But then she says the real question is whether it can be sustained or aligned with the appropriate channels to make real political change.
[00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:21.378]  And that is the key there, because they want to be able to channel all of this anger
[00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:24.980]  And align it with their agenda.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:31.383]  And they said the flashpoint there was just seeing how many women all across the country attended the Women's March.
[00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.726]  Meanwhile, the Democrats, the Democratic leaders, weren't even at the march.
[00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:37.767]  They weren't even there showing their actual support.
[00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:40.228]  Hillary Clinton, perfect example, wasn't even there.
[00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:43.090]  They were at a Democratic fundraiser in Florida.
[00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.891]  That was what was more important to them.
[00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:45.952]  Not the people.
[00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:55.582]  And then we have Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Gangster himself, warning Democrats they need to take a chill pill, realize they're not going to be taking power back anytime soon.
[00:10:55.963 --> 00:11:04.311]  So what he is really suggesting, which is what we're seeing, the Young Turks, for instance, are starting their own little movement as well in alignment with Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
[00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:05.192]  I don't
[00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:44.521]  Get active locally in your government and get into these positions where you can actually make a change locally because believe me this is what the Democrats and those on the left and all these little crazy Antifa kids that's what they are planning on doing is figuring out how they can be in control of you and your community on a local level so have fun with that but Rahm Emanuel says
[00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:46.363]  Winning is everything.
[00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:48.864]  Our party likes to be right.
[00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:52.947]  Even if they lose, he says, I don't go to moral victory speeches.
[00:11:53.007 --> 00:11:54.288]  I've never lost an election.
[00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.169]  It's about winning because you have to win.
[00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.051]  Then you have the power to do what has to get done.
[00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:00.552]  So it's not about being right.
[00:12:00.712 --> 00:12:01.613]  It's about winning.
[00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:06.116]  And in fact, we've got Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters.
[00:12:06.156 --> 00:12:10.479]  I've got a couple of clips here I wanted to play where they prove it's not about being right.
[00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:11.920]  It's not about knowing anything.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.181]  It's just about being perpetually outraged.
[00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:15.282]  Let's play this clip.
[00:12:16.823 --> 00:12:29.790]  This, while it's only a couple of weeks since the inauguration, there's complete evidence, there's practically, we've seen nothing that we can work, that I can work with President Bush on.
[00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:39.655]  And I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign, which turns out to be not true, a hoax.
[00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:44.754]  And really dangerous to the economic stability of America's working families.
[00:12:44.954 --> 00:12:46.495]  What are we going to do?
[00:12:47.116 --> 00:13:05.387]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our
[00:13:06.388 --> 00:13:22.219]  DCCC and DNC and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in... What is Aleppo?
[00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:23.140]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.721]  What is Aleppo?
[00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:32.203]  And so here you have Mayor Rahm Emanuel coming out and saying it's not about being right, it's about winning.
[00:13:32.643 --> 00:13:47.068]  And as you'll see, even in Europe, a lot of those who are trying to regain or reclaim their political power, they don't care about doing what is right, they care about winning, even if that means putting the safety of you and your family in jeopardy.
[00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:48.729]  For instance, in Sweden,
[00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:57.635]  In Europe, in Germany, in many countries, they're covering up migrant crime because they want to push this open borders agenda.
[00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:59.836]  We're starting to see that happening here in the US as well.
[00:14:00.337 --> 00:14:10.504]  A Swedish court, Kit Daniels has this story, a Swedish court sentenced a Muslim migrant to only two months in jail after being convicted of anally raping a 13-year-old girl.
[00:14:10.924 --> 00:14:12.585]  Now, the reason why he kind of got off
[00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:14.666]  Very lightly.
[00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:34.160]  Minors get about a third the amount of time as he would if he had been tried as an adult.
[00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:47.537]  And this is in addition to the fact that he was also charged with another rape of a 14-year-old under similar circumstances, but the court claimed it was child abuse, not rape, because of the degree of reciprocity.
[00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:57.105]  It sort of sounds just like the degree of reciprocity when a young boy was raped in the bathroom and the migrant claimed that he was having a sexual emergency.
[00:14:57.365 --> 00:15:00.467]  So they allowed him to get off on that, which is absolutely insane.
[00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:15.359]  So of course, this is coming right on the heels of President Trump saying that these migrant crimes are not being reported, where he wants to now have a weekly tally showing the crimes that are being committed by illegal aliens here, so people will kind of get the veracity of what's happening.
[00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:21.224]  Paul Joseph Watson's reporting about a second Swedish police officer blowing the whistle on migrant crime cover-up.
[00:15:22.284 --> 00:15:33.434]  So last week there was a police investigator, former deputy head of the Division for Serious Crimes, made headlines after he wrote a Facebook post in which he detailed how the country was in chaos.
[00:15:33.874 --> 00:15:41.360]  Due to a never-ending epidemic of serious crimes being committed by Muslim migrants, he's now facing charges under strict hate crime laws.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:51.348]  A second police officer is now exposing how the police have been told to implement a Code 291 procedure in order to cover up information about crimes committed by migrants.
[00:15:52.108 --> 00:16:00.015]  The code is used to hide all information about the immigration-related crime, including a ban on publicly releasing photos of migrant suspects.
[00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:05.160]  And it appears as though those orders are now coming down here into the United States.
[00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:15.170]  For instance, here right in Austin, Texas, a man who was arrested for sexually assaulting a Texas mother at knife point while her toddler was in the car
[00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:24.917]  He was not identified as a criminal illegal immigrant by local media despite the fact that the man had already been previously deported following a homicide conviction.
[00:16:25.358 --> 00:16:26.078]  Why is that?
[00:16:26.358 --> 00:16:37.206]  Because Austin is embroiled in wanting to become a sanctuary city so they can't report the facts to you that this was a very dangerous previously deported illegal alien.
[00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:43.020]  Right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.242]  Groundbreaking story from Jerome Corsi.
[00:16:45.622 --> 00:16:49.345]  Haitians demand White House aides head for sabotaging Trump.
[00:16:49.745 --> 00:16:51.927]  Clinton mole inside White House exposed.
[00:16:52.367 --> 00:17:10.061]  Former reality television star Omarosa, once rated the most hated reality star of all time for her appearance on The Apprentice, has used her White House position to hijack President Trump's resolve to become Haiti's greatest champion, uprooting the legacy of the Clinton corruption on the troubled Caribbean island nation.
[00:17:10.501 --> 00:17:27.446]  Despite strong objections from the Haiti expatriate community that Haitian President-elect Jovenel Moise is another corrupt candidate handpicked by the Clintons to perpetuate their crime syndicate grip on Haiti, Omarosa, who served as an assistant to Al Gore and voted for Obama,
[00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:36.230]  has assembled a presidential delegation that consists of Clinton and Bush loyalists to attend the new Haitian president's inauguration today.
[00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:48.497]  So it looks like the Clintons, who have been robbing and pillaging from Haiti for years, are still trying to maintain their stranglehold there politically by getting this president inserted.
[00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:50.538]  Haitian political activists in the U.S.
[00:17:50.578 --> 00:18:00.084]  have discussed with Infowars their plans to organize an online petition calling on President Trump to dismiss Omarosa from the current White House position she holds.
[00:18:00.764 --> 00:18:11.890]  Well, let's certainly bring awareness to this issue with the Clintons' involvement in Haiti, and let's think about the people in Haiti that have been ravaged by all the disaster and ignored by the mainstream media.
[00:18:12.411 --> 00:18:17.013]  Omarosa was disappointed by Trump when the president passed over her application to be the U.S.
[00:18:17.073 --> 00:18:18.014]  ambassador to Haiti.
[00:18:18.474 --> 00:18:28.143]  After the 2010 earthquake, President Clinton formed the Clinton Foundation Haiti Fund and raised $16.5 million from individual efforts for immediate relief.
[00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:33.648]  Yet on the Clinton Foundation website, there is no documentation in IRS Form 1023 application
[00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:41.171]  Well, it's been well documented the damage that the Clintons have done to Haiti and I think it would be great for Donald Trump to do something for the forgotten people of Haiti.
[00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:42.491]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Metal Vitality, 30% off.

[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.136]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:05.196 --> 00:23:08.417]  I'm joined now via Skype from Finland with Tina Wieg.
[00:23:08.497 --> 00:23:10.138]  She resides in the northern part of Finland.
[00:23:10.158 --> 00:23:14.480]  We're going to be talking about the refugee crisis that is currently underway in her community.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.382]  Tina, if you can just introduce yourself to our listeners, tell them what's going on on the ground there for you.
[00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:29.065]  Yes, I'm Tina Wieg and I'm a blogger and a blogger and I cover these immigration issues because they are so undercover in the media.
[00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:41.738]  Us in Finland, we've been getting a lot of these asylum seekers, especially in 2015 when we got 32,000 of them, which in a country of 5 million people is a huge number.
[00:23:42.418 --> 00:23:53.764]  And the asylum seeker numbers have gone down since, but of course we know that there are millions of people behind the Mediterranean who are waiting to get to Europe, so this isn't going away any time soon.
[00:23:56.169 --> 00:23:58.311]  There is basically nothing being done about it.
[00:23:58.411 --> 00:24:06.797]  Like, there's a lot of discussion about how do we solve these problems of integration, about immigrant crime, but nothing is being done.
[00:24:06.817 --> 00:24:13.703]  And instead of focusing on the immigration issues, our government is focusing on hate speech and racism.
[00:24:14.383 --> 00:24:17.686]  And now they want tougher penalties for hate speech crimes.
[00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:20.528]  And that's basically all they are doing.
[00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:24.222]  The doors are still completely open.
[00:24:24.642 --> 00:24:35.827]  And of course, if we had followed the international contracts, there would be zero asylum seekers over here in Finland, because according to the Dublin Agreement, these asylum seekers have to stay in the first safe country.
[00:24:36.187 --> 00:24:42.870]  And we live over here up in the north, so they have to cross like a dozen safe countries on their way here.
[00:24:44.292 --> 00:24:47.793]  So they're mass migrating to your small hometown in Finland.
[00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:49.834]  Tell me about the changes you're experiencing.
[00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:54.855]  You know, here at InfoWars, we've covered the rape crisis that's happened in Cologne, frankly, the New Year's Eve attacks.
[00:24:55.176 --> 00:25:00.157]  Countless stories, Tina, about, you know, ridiculous criminal cases.
[00:25:00.197 --> 00:25:01.257]  They're never deported.
[00:25:01.618 --> 00:25:02.638]  Nothing ever happens.
[00:25:02.698 --> 00:25:12.021]  But in two of the interviews that I've done with people that are living abroad, they are censored, fined, and charged with hate speech for speaking out on the Internet, even concern
[00:25:12.541 --> 00:25:17.202]  Even voicing a legitimate fear, it isn't hate speech to question what your government's doing.
[00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:20.863]  Just tell people a little bit about what you're experiencing on the ground.
[00:25:21.383 --> 00:25:25.163]  Any anecdotal things that you can mention for us here in the States?
[00:25:26.884 --> 00:25:30.104]  Well, the street view of this town, it has completely changed.
[00:25:30.204 --> 00:25:39.566]  When I was a little girl, about 10 years old, I didn't have to think about safety when I came here for shopping or things like that.
[00:25:40.326 --> 00:25:45.027]  It didn't even cross my mind that something could happen, but nowadays I really wonder.
[00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:48.668]  I wouldn't go to certain places in this town alone at night.
[00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:54.850]  There have been rapes, there have been abductions, there have been harassments against even schoolgirls.
[00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:06.313]  The asylum seekers, they are hanging out at public swimming pools ogling at women all day long, and there have been attempted rapes.
[00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.596]  In front of these swimming pools.
[00:26:08.896 --> 00:26:25.446]  So there is this entirely new atmosphere and you can see it in the street view that the amount of immigrants it has risen so much that it's impossible to go to the center of Oulu without being faced with tons of African and Middle Eastern people.
[00:26:26.741 --> 00:26:34.105]  Talk to me about the refugee population because we've covered here on Infowars that they're in fact militant men of military age.
[00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:47.133]  They're not the women and children, some are women and children, but for the majority there's been a mass influx of military aged men from predominantly places where there would be a hostility, places where there's an agenda.
[00:26:47.213 --> 00:26:48.434]  Is that what you found to be true?
[00:26:50.094 --> 00:26:50.835]  Exactly true.
[00:26:50.995 --> 00:27:00.626]  Like, when the refugee crisis started, our politicians told us that it's a fairytale that ISIS fighters would infiltrate our country among these asylum seekers.
[00:27:01.027 --> 00:27:02.488]  But now... Wait, hold on a second.
[00:27:02.508 --> 00:27:05.952]  They told you that ISIS would infiltrate with the asylum seekers?
[00:27:05.992 --> 00:27:06.613]  No, it wouldn't.
[00:27:06.813 --> 00:27:08.515]  It's a fairytale.
[00:27:08.555 --> 00:27:10.217]  They assured you that that wouldn't happen?
[00:27:10.557 --> 00:27:10.838]  Okay.
[00:27:12.062 --> 00:27:18.189]  Yes, and now we have two Iraqi asylum seekers who are on trial for taking part in the Camp Spaiho massacre.
[00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.874]  They murdered 11 people while they were fighting for ISIS.
[00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:25.518]  So they murdered 11 helpless Iraqi prisoners.
[00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:27.721]  And now they are on trial in Finland.
[00:27:28.593 --> 00:27:30.315]  I absolutely support it.
[00:27:57.256 --> 00:27:57.996]  It's common sense.
[00:27:58.436 --> 00:28:02.838]  If you or I would go to Iraq or to Syria and walk on the streets, we wouldn't be safe.
[00:28:03.178 --> 00:28:05.599]  Those people around us there wouldn't be safe to us.
[00:28:06.139 --> 00:28:09.620]  So they don't become any safer if they cross the border over here.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.321]  They don't become any more respectful of women.
[00:28:12.561 --> 00:28:14.862]  They don't become any less violent.
[00:28:14.882 --> 00:28:22.425]  And these people, they harbor a great deal of hatred against the Westerners and against Jews, against Christians.
[00:28:23.154 --> 00:28:26.496]  So it's natural that there will be clashes if these people are let in.
[00:28:26.816 --> 00:28:29.297]  And of course I'm not saying all of them are like that.
[00:28:29.377 --> 00:28:31.038]  Most of them are good people.
[00:28:31.498 --> 00:28:37.061]  But there are enough of the troublemakers in there to make it too big a risk for us.
[00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:38.881]  We can't take that chance.
[00:28:39.041 --> 00:28:48.326]  Not a single one of our citizens deserves to die because of getting a better standard of living for these Middle Eastern people.
[00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:50.507]  It's just too high a price.
[00:28:52.035 --> 00:29:04.245]  I noticed your refugee parody on Twitter, and you write a lot about this, and I personally, it's very interesting to me as an American looking at it, because honestly, the coverage does not exist, Tina, here.
[00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:05.345]  We don't talk about it.
[00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:09.749]  We're few and far between in terms of news organizations that actually bring
[00:29:10.129 --> 00:29:13.450]  People the truth about the mass migration crisis that's underway.
[00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.271]  We're called racist and bigots and homophobic.
[00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:16.231]  You name it, we're called it.
[00:29:16.271 --> 00:29:17.672]  But we really want to give people the truth.
[00:29:18.172 --> 00:29:20.593]  And something that President Trump said today in U.S.
[00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:23.074]  media, he said that terrorism is underreported.
[00:29:23.374 --> 00:29:25.695]  The media is intentionally not reporting it.
[00:29:26.195 --> 00:29:36.699]  And coming from a place where I would cover terror attacks as a part of my last job and understanding that they are so frequent, can you lay out for people what's happening even in acts of domestic terrorism?
[00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:45.302]  Where it's not necessarily, you know, there are lots of attempts going on and it's stemming from a mass migrant population flooding an area.
[00:29:45.342 --> 00:29:46.343]  Have you seen anything like that?
[00:29:46.403 --> 00:29:54.646]  I'm pointing specifically to the video with the bats and the car and it looked like anybody driving along a Finnish highway or Finnish road was going to be assaulted.
[00:29:54.946 --> 00:29:56.927]  That's an act of terrorism, frankly.
[00:29:57.748 --> 00:30:00.729]  Can you lay the groundwork for people and just explain what's going on with that?
[00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:12.390]  And that's something nobody really has the full picture of, not even any of the activists who follow these things very closely, because the statistics aren't published.
[00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.112]  You have to dig every little piece of information out by yourself.
[00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:23.595]  And the media, if they cover these kinds of crimes, they always leave out the background of the assailants.
[00:30:23.675 --> 00:30:27.277]  They don't mention that they are asylum seekers or that they are of foreign background.
[00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:30.339]  So you have to do a lot of digging to get to this information.
[00:30:31.022 --> 00:30:41.049]  And I've always said that it's not even the terrorism or the Cologne-style mass harassments that are the problem, because those are single incidents that don't happen that often.
[00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:53.478]  But it's that everyday crime, that what you saw on the video from Forsa, the police patrols having to go to these asylum-seeker housing centers 24-7, several times a day, because they fight amongst themselves.
[00:30:53.538 --> 00:30:57.661]  There are rapes, there are child molestations, they stab each other even.
[00:30:58.393 --> 00:31:03.555]  And when they are out on the streets, they harass local women, they rape local women.
[00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:13.838]  There was one case of a teenage asylum seeker who had only been in the country for eight days when he raped a 14-year-old Christian girl in a town nearby.
[00:31:14.562 --> 00:31:19.848]  So these people, they are causing this everyday trouble that doesn't reach international news.
[00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:24.152]  And that's the thing that affects normal people's lives the most.
[00:31:24.492 --> 00:31:26.614]  It's not the terrorism that happens once in a while.
[00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:30.338]  It's this everyday chaos these people bring with them.
[00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:34.302]  Do you feel like your government is telling you to stand down, to not question it, to not even...
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.740]  You know, I was looking at your hate speech parody.
[00:31:38.301 --> 00:31:42.201]  You know, even speaking out against it, you could be put into jail for talking about it.
[00:31:42.261 --> 00:31:42.961]  Is that correct?
[00:31:43.342 --> 00:31:44.322]  Depending on how far you go.
[00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:47.162]  Yes, it's completely correct.
[00:31:47.182 --> 00:31:50.203]  But the charges are often very arbitrary.
[00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:57.544]  There's a lot of real hate speech, like saying that people should be, there should be a genocide of certain people.
[00:31:57.864 --> 00:32:00.685]  And those people who write that stuff, they don't get prosecuted.
[00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:02.245]  But if you're a politician,
[00:32:02.765 --> 00:32:08.027]  If you're a famous person, then you are in chance of getting prosecuted because you have too much influence.
[00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:17.392]  So it's used as a political weapon to silence those who are becoming too dangerous to the system, those who have too much listeners who take them seriously.
[00:32:19.362 --> 00:32:29.185]  I noticed, and we're running out of time here, I can't say thank you enough, first of all, for joining me, but I just noticed the Trump support, and you talk about this specific background that you come from.
[00:32:29.205 --> 00:32:38.207]  Do you want to see something like that in Finland, or do you feel like it's almost too late, like the floodgates are open, so to speak, where we sort of dodged a bullet in terms of this issue here?
[00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:42.628]  Over here in Finland, it's not too late yet.
[00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:46.371]  We aren't at that stage of Sweden or Germany yet.
[00:32:46.411 --> 00:32:51.094]  We don't have that much immigration and Islamization over here, so we can put a stop to this.
[00:32:51.635 --> 00:32:54.237]  And I'm hoping this change will happen over here.
[00:32:54.337 --> 00:32:56.539]  We need a Trump of our own here, too.
[00:32:56.859 --> 00:32:58.120]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.501]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:19.783]  The pathetic and delusional Democrats were at it again, their stomachs growling with an insatiable hunger for hubris and lunacy.
[00:37:19.824 --> 00:37:28.306]  They scurried to a microphone that actually worked this time as they tried to sell the American voters a belly full of fiction yet again.
[00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.267]  What are we going to do?
[00:37:30.908 --> 00:37:52.682]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC, and knowing that
[00:37:55.804 --> 00:38:06.567]  He is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in Aleppo.
[00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:17.629]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:24.611]  I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position.
[00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:26.071]  Leader Pelosi, do you agree?
[00:38:26.111 --> 00:38:26.752]  Do you agree?
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:50.105]  Minority leader Nancy Pelosi only served to reassure the voters that her mind is not firing on all cylinders.
[00:38:50.566 --> 00:38:55.529]  We've seen nothing that we can work, that I can work with President Bush on.
[00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.153]  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told the flustered Democrats to take a chill pill.
[00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:27.277]  Of course, when you are being criticized by Rahm Emanuel, who has overseen more homicides in Chicago than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, it may be time to hang up the desperate daily dismantling of President Donald Trump's agenda before the Democratic Party is finally hauled into court over the millions of dollars it has received from Captain Subversion, aka hedge fund billionaire and former Nazi collaborator George Soros.
[00:39:27.537 --> 00:39:39.901]  But it appears that President Donald Trump's adversaries have lined up on both sides of the aisle thanks to donations by the billion-dollar Soros machine seditiously seeding chaos in the United States.
[00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:45.802]  Breitbart reported perhaps even more significant is the type of Republican they aim to prop up.
[00:39:45.942 --> 00:39:52.124]  Pro-amnesty, pro-open borders on trade, and generally speaking anti-Trump, a pattern emerges
[00:39:52.284 --> 00:39:52.845]  We're good to go.
[00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:20.044]  According to the records available online, the Soros Firm's workers gave $10,800 to Ryan, while Senator Lindsey Graham received $3,500 from the firm's employees.
[00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:28.788]  According to the Center for Responsive Politics data, that includes a $1,500 donation from Soros Fund Management Executive Scott Besant.
[00:40:28.988 --> 00:40:44.879]  Senator Marco Rubio raked in $2,700 while other failed GOP presidential candidates Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush also received $2,700 apiece from employees of the Soros firm.
[00:41:00.269 --> 00:41:21.929]  During the 2016 presidential campaign, InfoWars pointed out time and time again that George Soros wasn't just giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
[00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:24.322]  Along with Michael Bloomberg.
[00:41:24.762 --> 00:41:32.825]  But they were also giving money to the Republican Party and other Republican Party candidates to beat Donald Trump.
[00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:34.285]  So was Goldman Sachs.
[00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.406]  So was JP Morgan.
[00:41:35.946 --> 00:41:43.269]  And DrudgeReport.com ran articles from Breitbart and True Pundit yesterday that show the Federal Election Commission numbers.
[00:41:43.989 --> 00:41:45.570]  What did Trump get from Goldman Sachs?
[00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.290]  Zero.
[00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.771]  What did Trump get from George Soros?
[00:41:49.111 --> 00:41:49.531]  Zero.
[00:41:49.931 --> 00:41:50.892]  What did Trump get from...
[00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:54.452]  Other big mega banks like JP Morgan, zero.
[00:41:54.793 --> 00:42:01.957]  He did appoint three people from Goldman Sachs out of thousands of employees they have because they were anti-globalist and knew where the bodies were buried.
[00:42:02.457 --> 00:42:03.437]  And that's why they're panicking.
[00:42:03.718 --> 00:42:05.599]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:07.700]  George Soros is trying to crash the dollar.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.783]  And that's Bloomberg and others promoting an implosion of the dollar right now.
[00:42:14.005 --> 00:42:15.566]  He is desperately failing.
[00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:19.307]  He has naked shorted the dollar and the US stock market.
[00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:20.327]  That came out a few weeks ago.
[00:42:20.847 --> 00:42:22.608]  And he doesn't know what to do.
[00:42:22.628 --> 00:42:23.528]  Let's look at some of these articles.
[00:42:24.548 --> 00:42:25.429]  Backstabbers!
[00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:31.291]  Paul Ryan, John McCain, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush took campaign cash from Soros.
[00:42:31.531 --> 00:42:32.251]  Here it is right here.
[00:42:33.672 --> 00:42:34.513]  Read it for yourself.
[00:42:34.713 --> 00:42:36.294]  Also, Breitbart has the story.
[00:42:36.314 --> 00:42:38.055]  And again, people are saying, OK, we already knew this.
[00:42:38.775 --> 00:42:50.202]  But again, let's point out now, now that all the federal elections numbers are in, even worse than last year, now that all the numbers are in, it is way, way bigger than we even thought.
[00:42:50.242 --> 00:43:01.749]  Just look at this photo of last year, George Soros and John McCain, both men funding the Arab Spring, both men funding ISIS, both men funding the jihad of Saudi Arabia.
[00:43:02.649 --> 00:43:05.611]  Both men desperate to stop Donald Trump.
[00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:09.734]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump is ending Glass-Steagall, letting banks rip you off.
[00:43:10.074 --> 00:43:12.936]  Donald Trump is ordering big banks to make loans to small businesses.
[00:43:13.236 --> 00:43:14.657]  Donald Trump is defending our borders.
[00:43:14.937 --> 00:43:17.619]  Donald Trump is setting up trade deals that aren't one-sided.
[00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:22.082]  Donald Trump is getting billions and billions, hundreds of billions of jobs to come back to the US.
[00:43:22.442 --> 00:43:27.746]  The stock market's exploding because America is open for business again, not being sold out by globalists for their power.
[00:43:28.206 --> 00:43:32.429]  And Brexit's happening and all these other countries are pulling out of the corporate world government.
[00:43:33.149 --> 00:43:36.491]  We are beginning to see the beginning of the end of globalism.
[00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:42.493]  It's authoritarian, it's unelected, but it controls the media and it sold itself as trendy and cool.
[00:43:43.414 --> 00:43:47.195]  I get sick clips from NPR and CNN saying I'm a white supremacist.
[00:43:47.455 --> 00:43:49.596]  They never show a clip of me saying I'm a white supremacist.
[00:43:49.856 --> 00:43:51.457]  They never show a clip of me saying something racist.
[00:43:51.837 --> 00:43:52.598]  They just say it.
[00:43:53.278 --> 00:43:54.338]  They say I'm a Russian agent.
[00:43:54.358 --> 00:43:57.600]  They say Trump's a Russian agent because we don't want war with Russia.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.804]  Because we don't want an Arab Spring running all over Europe.
[00:44:01.365 --> 00:44:03.028]  They're desperate, they're out of ammo.
[00:44:03.048 --> 00:44:08.015]  The good news is, this old evil Nazi collaborator, this true James Bond villain...
[00:44:09.008 --> 00:44:10.449]  He's being defeated on every front.
[00:44:10.729 --> 00:44:16.153]  There are demonstrations all over Europe against him and against his backers and against his controllers.
[00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:17.694]  This is a great time to be alive.
[00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:25.720]  Meanwhile, overwhelming evidence proves Trump right about massive voter election fraud organized by George Soros.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.902]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, Infowars.com.
[00:44:27.922 --> 00:44:28.502]  And here's another one.
[00:44:28.962 --> 00:44:33.285]  Top Clinton lawyer joins Soros super PAC to stop voter ID.
[00:44:33.746 --> 00:44:36.388]  Openly trying to get it where states let illegals vote.
[00:44:37.168 --> 00:44:41.973]  Then they come out and say Trump's wrong about illegals voting, even as they get caught doing it.
[00:44:42.033 --> 00:44:46.918]  Trump's wrong about the media underreporting Islamic terror when it's come out that
[00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:51.806]  FBI and other people have been ordered not to even call it Islamic terror when it is terror.
[00:44:52.307 --> 00:44:55.388]  Everybody knows they've whitewashed crime statistics and Islamic terror.
[00:44:55.649 --> 00:44:58.050]  All over Europe, police are coming out saying they've been ordered to do this.
[00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:04.234]  So again, Trump trolled them in saying they're not reporting on Islamic terror, so they'd be forced to actually cover it.
[00:45:04.814 --> 00:45:06.255]  We're as smart as these parasites.
[00:45:06.295 --> 00:45:06.935]  We're smarter.
[00:45:07.335 --> 00:45:09.297]  We just don't think like them underhanded.
[00:45:10.037 --> 00:45:16.081]  And now that we're taking action against them, not with corruption, but with truth, we are kicking their asses up and down the street.
[00:45:16.781 --> 00:45:20.606]  More coming tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News, and tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:45:20.626 --> 00:45:21.127]  to 3 p.m.
[00:45:21.147 --> 00:45:24.270]  with the weekday big show, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:45:24.611 --> 00:45:26.854]  Subscribe to the free podcast, spread the links to the videos.
[00:45:27.334 --> 00:45:29.857]  They're trying to censor us big time, but it's blowing up in their face.
[00:45:30.138 --> 00:45:31.479]  I was just on Joe Rogan last week.
[00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:32.360]  He's been on here eight years.
[00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:35.200]  Movie star, TV star, UFC host.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:44.022]  It broke all records in one week, all his other podcasts, and is set to triple his previous records because info wars and the truth is popular.
[00:45:44.302 --> 00:45:45.262]  We got Paul Watson.
[00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:46.283]  We got Matt Drudge.
[00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:47.263]  We got Milo.
[00:45:47.423 --> 00:45:48.403]  We got Donald Trump.
[00:45:48.743 --> 00:45:50.004]  We've got people like Pence.
[00:45:50.264 --> 00:45:53.445]  We've got the rock stars in the fight for liberty worldwide.
[00:45:54.085 --> 00:46:04.757]  And we've got the Russian people, the Italian people, the people in Brazil, and people all over the world waking up, wanting sovereignty, and wanting to promote our cultures of freedom, and wanting true open societies.
[00:46:05.378 --> 00:46:09.903]  Not fake open societies that George Soros wants to run, where he plays countries off against each other.
[00:46:10.284 --> 00:46:11.025]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:46:11.425 --> 00:46:14.649]  There's a global revolution happening against tyranny, and you are the front line.
[00:46:18.436 --> 00:46:19.977]  What are we going to do?
[00:46:20.598 --> 00:46:38.872]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our
[00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:46.175]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.061]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.081 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.703 --> 00:49:15.726]  Remember last year as we were coming into the Democrat and Republican committees and we learned that the DNC had been hacked and it was the Russians who did it, right?
[00:49:16.447 --> 00:49:22.029]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned because it was shown that she was hacking the election against Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:27.812]  She was replaced by Donna Brazile and the emails showed that Donna Brazile had been feeding questions to Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:27.852 --> 00:49:31.794]  Now they've got a race going on for the replacement and we've got Tom Perez.
[00:49:31.874 --> 00:49:37.477]  Now Tom Perez is being offered up by the DNC because they see him as less radical
[00:49:38.177 --> 00:49:40.719]  Then the Muslim congressman Keith Ellison.
[00:49:41.299 --> 00:49:56.151]  So they're trying to put him in and this is what he had to say and I want you to remember this because we're going to talk about the massive pwning of the Democrat intelligence members on the House as well as people who've been on foreign affairs, Benghazi committees.
[00:49:56.191 --> 00:50:00.054]  We've now had a major expose, not of Russians,
[00:50:00.734 --> 00:50:02.035]  But of Muslim Brotherhoods.
[00:50:02.135 --> 00:50:08.600]  Not the Muslim Brotherhood, but Muslim Brothers that have now been fired, and there may be a criminal investigation on Capitol Hill.
[00:50:08.941 --> 00:50:26.435]  So, in light of all this, in light of all the protests that we've seen in the last couple of weeks, saying you can't do and should not do extreme vetting of the people who are coming in from these other countries, I want you to listen to what Tom Perez said as part of his campaign to become the successor to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to Donna Brazile.
[00:50:26.475 --> 00:50:28.497]  He said, refugees are vetted
[00:50:28.997 --> 00:50:32.601]  Far more diligently than the nominees of Donald Trump for his cabinet.
[00:50:32.621 --> 00:50:33.501]  That's for sure, he said.
[00:50:33.942 --> 00:50:36.744]  The extreme vetting should be for the people in his cabinet.
[00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:41.689]  Because he would learn he has more billionaires than people of color in his cabinet.
[00:50:41.729 --> 00:50:42.230]  There he goes.
[00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.411]  Back to identity politics.
[00:50:43.471 --> 00:50:44.372]  And presumably...
[00:50:45.032 --> 00:51:00.318]  That was how all these Democrat congressmen got burned because, you know, a Muslim just couldn't do anything that would, uh, they couldn't be stealing equipment, they couldn't be stealing secrets, they couldn't be breaking into staff committee computers, but they did.
[00:51:01.218 --> 00:51:11.768]  We learned first from Politico, just a couple of days, interestingly enough, because this puts it in context, to think about how close this was to this raid that happened in Yemen with the death of the Navy SEAL.
[00:51:12.249 --> 00:51:14.351]  You understand you're playing for keeps here.
[00:51:14.932 --> 00:51:18.415]  People live and die based on secrecy.
[00:51:18.995 --> 00:51:21.158]  And so just a day or two after that had happened,
[00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:28.139]  We learned first from Politico that some House staffers were under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft.
[00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:43.842]  They said five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member of Congress offices and accessed House IT systems without knowledge of the lawmakers because these lawmakers are Democrats.
[00:51:44.182 --> 00:51:44.803]  They don't know.
[00:51:44.943 --> 00:51:46.963]  They don't care about security issues.
[00:51:47.443 --> 00:51:48.983]  This is what we see over and over again.
[00:51:49.003 --> 00:51:51.604]  So five employees, four men, they said, and a woman.
[00:51:51.624 --> 00:51:55.685]  That was what the source at the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed to Politico.
[00:51:56.225 --> 00:51:56.985]  They say the U.S.
[00:51:57.025 --> 00:52:04.887]  Capitol Police were conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests had been made and as of that time the FBI was not involved.
[00:52:04.907 --> 00:52:07.507]  The next day we got more information from the Daily Caller.
[00:52:08.087 --> 00:52:09.868]  The Daily Caller started naming names.
[00:52:09.928 --> 00:52:14.969]  At that point we learned that the brothers who were arrested were brothers Bibb,
[00:52:19.632 --> 00:52:24.696]  I don't know who the fourth man is, but we also learned in this report who the woman involved is.
[00:52:24.737 --> 00:52:35.505]  They say three members of the Intelligence Panel and five members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed these suspects on a shared basis.
[00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.967]  And guess who the very first name named is?
[00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:50.532]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the one who was screaming about, the Russians hacked me, the Russians hacked me, now she's been hacked by the people she hired to run IT, these Muslim brothers.
[00:52:51.132 --> 00:53:03.016]  The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members' computer networks, so they got into the Congress' computer networks, without their knowledge, and stealing equipment from Congress.
[00:53:03.337 --> 00:53:06.838]  Let's look at who some of these people are, because besides Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
[00:53:07.438 --> 00:53:13.826]  Who has talked a great deal about why we should not be vetting any Muslims coming into this country.
[00:53:13.886 --> 00:53:15.107]  That's racist of course.
[00:53:15.127 --> 00:53:20.874]  So presumably they didn't vet these IT employees because that would be racist if they were actually to look into the backgrounds.
[00:53:20.894 --> 00:53:23.797]  I'm going to show you there were some very suspicious things in their background.
[00:53:24.558 --> 00:53:28.941]  But of course we've also had Joaquin Castro, one of the Castro brothers from here in Texas.
[00:53:29.362 --> 00:53:31.223]  He is a Democrat congressman.
[00:53:31.263 --> 00:53:34.605]  He's on both the Intelligence and the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[00:53:34.925 --> 00:53:41.130]  And listen to what Joaquin Castro of San Antonio said about President Trump's ban, he said, on Muslim refugees.
[00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:45.353]  He said it betrays America's values and it undermines national security.
[00:53:46.013 --> 00:53:56.722]  Well, Congressman Castro, do you think that it undermines national security to have people who are hacking into your own computers, who are stealing equipment, and you are absolutely clueless about it?
[00:53:57.062 --> 00:53:59.224]  They say signs of trouble have been visible.
[00:53:59.264 --> 00:54:00.785]  This is Daily Caller again.
[00:54:01.225 --> 00:54:03.967]  Signs have been visible in the public records.
[00:54:03.987 --> 00:54:13.375]  They say the Congressional Credit Union repossessed Abib's car in 2009, he declared bankruptcy in 2012, and he's facing multiple lawsuits.
[00:54:13.815 --> 00:54:17.818]  So when you see this type of thing, you understand this person's got money problems, right?
[00:54:17.878 --> 00:54:22.402]  He might be inclined to steal secrets, not just computer equipment.
[00:54:22.462 --> 00:54:28.106]  He might be inclined to steal secrets, and he has the ability to do that as a member of the IT staff.
[00:54:28.386 --> 00:54:31.429]  They did access their computers, and then he could sell that for cash.
[00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:32.709]  They go on to say,
[00:54:33.723 --> 00:54:42.452]  Security-sensitive jobs typically require background checks for credit and legal problems that can create pressures to cash in on access to secret information and documents.
[00:54:43.173 --> 00:54:48.178]  Now, of course, they're all living at an address of Hina R. Alvi.
[00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:52.203]  She's a female house IT employee, and they're all living together.
[00:54:52.243 --> 00:54:54.905]  These three brothers and this woman are all living in the same house.
[00:54:55.786 --> 00:55:00.510]  And she has done recent refinancing of her house multiple times.
[00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:09.717]  They say Jamal, whose public records suggest that he is only 22 years old, he first began working at the house when he was 20 and was paid nearly $160,000 a year.
[00:55:09.737 --> 00:55:11.238]  Three times the average house IT staff salary.
[00:55:16.772 --> 00:55:17.493]  Think about that.
[00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:18.894]  This is a 20 year old.
[00:55:19.614 --> 00:55:27.061]  What does this guy know that makes him so valuable that he is getting three times the salary of the average house IT staff?
[00:55:28.762 --> 00:55:29.703]  Does he have connections?
[00:55:29.723 --> 00:55:31.625]  It absolutely makes no sense.
[00:55:31.645 --> 00:55:36.309]  And of course we had Silicon Valley entrepreneurs pushing back against Donald Trump.
[00:55:37.239 --> 00:55:37.760]  That's good.
[00:55:52.614 --> 00:55:57.598]  You can get people that are just as good, that went to school in America, that are native-born.
[00:55:57.638 --> 00:56:03.262]  You don't need to bring in IT talent from these third world countries that we are at war with.
[00:56:03.442 --> 00:56:14.830]  And so it's very suspicious also the fact that not only are they making that much money, and of course we understand the privilege that goes on in Washington, but the fact that they would make that much money, all these brothers are making $160,000, $165,000, and yet they're declaring bankruptcy.
[00:56:19.033 --> 00:56:22.555]  And so then that brings us to this failed raid that happened.
[00:56:23.375 --> 00:56:30.640]  We're told now that in this Yemen raid, where the Navy SEAL died, women Al-Qaeda fighters surprised US forces.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:39.925]  They say that new details emerged, this is as February 1st, surrounding the deadly joint US-United Arab Emirate counterterrorism raid.
[00:56:40.365 --> 00:56:43.327]  They say this was something, of course, it was planned by Obama.
[00:56:43.387 --> 00:56:45.208]  They left this for Donald Trump.
[00:56:45.808 --> 00:56:52.713]  They needed, they said, a moonless night, so they waited until they got the right kind of moonless night to do this raid.
[00:56:52.773 --> 00:56:57.796]  But when you look at the fact that this was planned under the Obama administration, that they delayed this, it brings up a lot of questions.
[00:56:58.477 --> 00:57:00.778]  Was this an internal leak inside the country?
[00:57:01.218 --> 00:57:07.503]  Was this something that the intelligence services did in order to embarrass a Trump administration with a failure?
[00:57:08.303 --> 00:57:15.168]  You can even ask, was this a response when we see these people busted in the House IT staff?
[00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:17.689]  This happened just a day or so after that.
[00:57:17.729 --> 00:57:21.730]  Was that a coincidence or was it the result of information that they captured there?
[00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:33.473]  They say, and this is from the Pentagon, the raid resulted in the seizure of materials and information that is yielding valuable intelligence to help partners deter and prevent future terror attacks across the world.
[00:57:33.813 --> 00:57:36.494]  So that's possible that that was their response to that.
[00:57:37.155 --> 00:57:41.776]  But it's also possible that it was done in a way to embarrass the Trump administration.
[00:57:42.176 --> 00:57:44.898]  So, leaked intelligence or Pentagon cover-ups?
[00:57:44.938 --> 00:57:46.079]  Does that sound improbable?
[00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:51.783]  Remember, it wasn't long ago that we talked to the father of Michael Strange, his name is Charlie Strange, and Larry Klayman.
[00:57:51.803 --> 00:57:56.246]  They were trying to get information about another failed raid by Navy SEAL Team 6.
[00:57:57.947 --> 00:58:03.731]  There were seven Afghanis that were supposed to go on that mission along with the SEALs and other special ops forces.
[00:58:04.431 --> 00:58:06.092]  And they were removed at the last minute.
[00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:09.935]  In fact, there's no reference to who they were replaced with on the manifest.
[00:58:10.735 --> 00:58:11.496]  And we know that
[00:58:12.245 --> 00:58:12.806]  I don't think so.
[00:58:35.253 --> 00:58:44.104]  So questions remain about this latest raid and questions remain about the lax security of the Democrats as they mock the idea that we need to vet people coming into this country.
[00:58:44.504 --> 00:58:46.186]  That's it for tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
