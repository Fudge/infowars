[00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.298]  InfoWars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones.
[00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:08.219]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:09.320]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.760]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.241]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.001]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.963]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:14.964]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.124 --> 00:00:15.825]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:16.865]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:17.666]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:18.707]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.227]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:19.988]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:20.588]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:21.308]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:21.889]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:22.810]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.711]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:26.172]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:28.133]  There's a guy on the radio.
[00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:29.174]  His name is Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:30.115]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.595]  Alex Jones is the Muslim world, you know.
[00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.176]  That man's a saint, you watch your mouth.
[00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:36.096]  Time to stop submitting to this parody!
[00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.357]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:40.017]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:43.298]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:47.198]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:51.159]  Nobody can dispute the fact that... InfoWars.com.
[00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:52.899]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:24.734]  InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars
[00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:33.301]  You know, I said that I was going to take off today and spend some time with the family, but my family doesn't have any future if I'm not here on air fighting the globalists.
[00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:41.528]  And you're not there taking action because Trump's not taking any time off, I can tell you that, except maybe a golf game once a week while he meets with some world leader.
[00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:47.213]  So I'm here because my children have no future if we're not on the front lines of this fight.
[00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:50.876]  We're getting ready to launch more shows, more transmissions, hiring more crew.
[00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:52.777]  Right now is such a critical time.
[00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:55.079]  Wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:55.620]  So I'm here.
[00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.642]  I'm here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:13.951]  Tomorrow, I've got to take off the broadcast day because I'm going to have a bunch of experts and technicians and people here getting ready to launch new TV satellites, new radio affiliates, a new broadcast, and so much more.
[00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.511]  So we are definitely in an expansion phase against the globalists.
[00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:29.816]  That said, we're doing that tenuously, despite the fact that Google banned us advertising and killed about five million of funding, and you've seen all the other massive attacks, them going after our affiliates, and so much more.
[00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:32.417]  But I am doubling down, all in,
[00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:34.526]  Against the globalists.
[00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:35.027]  I'm going to go 110%.
[00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:44.091]  I'm not going to play games doing this because historically you know you win when you just bet everything on it and you've got God on your side.
[00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.172]  So thank you all so much for tuning in today.
[00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:52.074]  American citizen that Obama cut loose 17 months ago in a coma.
[00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:52.975]  They ship him back.
[00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:55.436]  He dies in his mother and father's arms.
[00:02:57.762 --> 00:03:02.705]  And I remembered all the leftists saying, oh, he's a white scumbag, you know, he deserves it.
[00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:05.386]  He tried to steal a poster off a wall or something.
[00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:09.329]  And of course, the North Koreans never lie, so I'm sure it's all true.
[00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:20.255]  And so we're going to play some of the clips of the leftists, again, invoking race, finding any way to invoke race, saying this frat boy deserves what happened to him.
[00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:21.876]  Well, now he's dead.
[00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.809]  And the Huffington Post and MSNBC and others, they don't have egg on their face.
[00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.111]  Because they're proud of what they are a part of.
[00:03:30.772 --> 00:03:34.494]  Worshipping any form of authoritarianism, as long as it's anti-Western.
[00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:37.196]  Here's what the President had to say yesterday.
[00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:43.861]  I just wanted to pass on word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away.
[00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.364]  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.
[00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:50.246]  A lot of bad things happened.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:02.065]  But at least we got him home to be with his parents, where they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition, but he just passed away a little while ago.
[00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:10.089]  It's a brutal regime, and we'll be able to handle it.
[00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.433]  A lot of trendies, and I'm not saying Mr. Wimber was one, but a lot of trendies, the trendy thing to do is to go to North Korea.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.041]  And they have trendy tours, and it's the big liberal thing.
[00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:26.322]  People pass around Kim Jong-un memorabilia.
[00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:27.342]  They make jokes about it.
[00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:29.303]  They think communist China's cute.
[00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:30.323]  They think Cuba's cute.
[00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:31.924]  They think Venezuela's cute.
[00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:33.444]  They think the old Soviet Union's cute.
[00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:34.904]  It's the trendy thing.
[00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:46.028]  To sit here in the lap of freedom, comparatively, and then make jokes like the left has done about his incarceration, and now he's dead.
[00:04:48.132 --> 00:04:54.574]  Oh, they may cancel all your little tourist trips there, though, to go see your little communist wonderland for yourself.
[00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.536]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Colonel Schaefer is warning of a bloody civil war.
[00:04:58.556 --> 00:04:59.936]  We've been warning you as well.
[00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:01.097]  That's coming up straight ahead.
[00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:02.937]  And the U.S.-Russia crisis.
[00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:05.919]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:15.022]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[00:05:15.162 --> 00:05:24.309]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands, as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.135]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event, and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience
[00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:36.159]  That Joseph Goebbels would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:42.605]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:49.451]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be proud, CNN is ISIS.
[00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:51.273]  While the protesters were all arrested,
[00:05:51.613 --> 00:06:00.091]  Rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.796]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.442]  Don't let bugs get in the way of your outdoor adventures.
[00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:13.065]  The best way to dodge those pesky bugs this summer is with Be Away Spray by Emrix Essentials.
[00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:19.209]  Be Away Spray will help you combat insects and avoid itchy inflamed skin while you're enjoying the outdoors.
[00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.852]  The Aromatherapy Essential Oils have a pleasant scent for humans, but not for bugs.
[00:06:25.713 --> 00:06:29.455]  Many people have sensitive skin and cannot use bug repellent that contains DEET.

[00:06:34.636 --> 00:06:39.578]  It is an all natural spray that is completely free of any synthetic ingredients and preservatives.

[00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:14.343]  It's healthy.
[00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:17.464]  It doesn't have any toxic effects, unlike so many other brands.
[00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.926]  Most sunscreens are toxic using aluminum and other metals.
[00:07:22.447 --> 00:07:23.647]  Not Emrix Essentials.
[00:07:23.987 --> 00:07:25.788]  It is of the highest lab standards.
[00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:29.490]  But it also funds the Info War and the fight against the globalists.
[00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.312]  Talk about a 360 win.
[00:07:31.932 --> 00:07:37.558]  Protect your skin while you fund an operation to crush tyranny and the globalists worldwide.
[00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:42.623]  Infowars never had so much fun shooting a commercial on Lake Travis in Austin.
[00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:47.588]  There's nothing like having fun in the sun while getting the very best sunscreen.
[00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:51.933]  So protect your skin while you protect liberty and promote the Infowar.
[00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:53.034]  A total win-win.

[00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.277]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:04.338]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:38.425]  Into the future, my friends.
[00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:39.306]  Already.
[00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:41.048]  The 20th day of June 2017.
[00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:42.509]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:46.812]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:08:46.912 --> 00:08:48.474]  Paul Watson will host the fourth hour.
[00:08:48.494 --> 00:09:02.466]  One of Joe Biggs' friends out in California, he's gone out there and spoken to their group, was stabbed nine times and has almost died after leaving a Trump event.
[00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:07.266]  And was told, die white boy, you know, die Trump supporter.
[00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:10.307]  This is somebody that Joe Biggs is friends with.
[00:09:10.347 --> 00:09:19.410]  In fact, he's in the article, in the article that I have here, there is a photo of Biggs with the gentleman.
[00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.191]  Here it is right here for TV viewers.
[00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:24.952]  So you can see them out in California.
[00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:26.853]  He's wearing a Hillary for prison shirt.
[00:09:26.913 --> 00:09:30.534]  The gentleman that got, that got stabbed.
[00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.056]  And the word is he had Infowars on his car.
[00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.137]  So this is the country we live in.
[00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.679]  This is why everybody needs their concealed carry.
[00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:48.763]  Trump supporter stabbed reportedly by Armenian gang members after being identified as conservative.
[00:09:51.304 --> 00:09:54.526]  Wow, Armenians think Trump's bad trying to keep radical Muslims out?
[00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:56.465]  I don't even know if that's true.
[00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:57.986]  I don't know if the media spun that or whatever.
[00:09:58.006 --> 00:09:58.847]  It just doesn't sound right.
[00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:09.872]  A Trump supporter was stabbed and is currently in critical condition in Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after being identified as a conservative and subsequently stabbed by an Armenian gang member.
[00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:19.357]  27-year-old Tony Foreman, Antonio Foreman, had just slipped the free speech rally in California alongside a slew of other well-known Trump supporters such as Kyle Chapman,
[00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:23.013]  Afterward, they headed to a local bar to relax.
[00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:30.779]  After a few hours at the bar, the group, many drawing Trump hats, supported bumper stickers on their vehicles, decided to retire for the night.
[00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:32.480]  That's when things took a turn for the worst.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:41.767]  As Tony approached his vehicle, another car rammed through the parking gate, vehicle barrier, into the lot, directly smashing into Tony's car.
[00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:44.009]  That sounds like Islamic jihad to me.
[00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:50.334]  The Armenians reportedly exited the car and reportedly were initially receptive to exchanging insurance information.
[00:10:51.445 --> 00:11:01.991]  They walked the length of Mr. Foreman's car, noticed multiple pro-patriot stickers including Gadsden flag, the American flag, and multiple other patriotic pro-Republican stickers on his back window.
[00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:04.612]  That's when things turned for the worse.
[00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:14.218]  After noticing these stickers, the Armenian gang members is reported, then walked back to his car before re-approaching Mr. Foreman, the car's other passengers
[00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:17.007]  That's being reported by local newspapers.
[00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:18.729]  It's being reported by Infowars.com.
[00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:19.930]  Kit Daniels has a story up on it as well.
[00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:40.451]  I mean, that's what this country has turned into with just the hype.
[00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:41.532]  Kill, kill, kill.
[00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:55.621]  And Bernie Sanders, after one of his supporters went and shot Congressman Scalise and four other people, including two police officers, has come out and said, by any means necessary, get aggressive.
[00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:56.742]  His supporters.
[00:11:56.762 --> 00:11:59.684]  We've got a clip of that coming up.
[00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.545]  And that ties in with Colonel Schaefer.
[00:12:02.648 --> 00:12:07.110]  Videos on Infowars.com, and Colonel Schaefer's not your average Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.233]  He's tied in with major intelligence agencies, COG, you name it.
[00:12:12.893 --> 00:12:16.475]  He's one of the key people that's been exposing how our government was behind Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:22.398]  He headed up the anti-bin Laden group, of course it was ordered to stand down twice before 9-11.
[00:12:23.922 --> 00:12:28.124]  He has come out and said, definitely, they're prepping for civil war and trying to cause one.
[00:12:28.544 --> 00:12:32.885]  Now, of course, I said this first, and I've been saying this all along, but it's not about credit.
[00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:34.406]  It's about credibility.
[00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:36.747]  And I told you they'd use COG to do it.
[00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:41.248]  But there is an information warfare against the President and the Republic that intends to go hot.
[00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:43.429]  Schaffer's now said that word for word.
[00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.350]  He's not getting it from me.
[00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.871]  We're looking at the exact same situation.
[00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:53.013]  That's why we're saying the exact same things.
[00:12:54.514 --> 00:13:01.280]  Because we're looking, with our research, with the terms we know, and with the history we know, at exactly what's happening.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.084]  The globalists are using old playbooks with high-tech weapons.
[00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:19.497]  So, we're already in a soft civil war, and you've got Soros set for July 2nd to launch rallies each week thereafter, right through August, calling for massive violence
[00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.425]  Attacks on police, it's going to be hellish.
[00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:29.107]  And there's a big debate with conservatives and libertarians, should we be non-violent?
[00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:31.627]  Absolutely, we should not be offensively violent.
[00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:44.529]  But if someone pulls a knife on you and says, I'm going to stab you in a parking lot because you're a Trump supporter or because you're white or because you are a libertarian, unload into their chest.
[00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:47.410]  It's better to be tried by nine than carried by six.
[00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:53.649]  The fourth turning, a summer of rage and the total eclipse of the deep state.
[00:13:53.909 --> 00:13:55.210]  Excellent article at Zero Hedge.
[00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.691]  I want to post that on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:00.813]  It's from ten days ago, but it really boils it down.
[00:14:02.073 --> 00:14:03.654]  And that is exactly what's happening.
[00:14:03.694 --> 00:14:07.316]  In fact, I think David Knight's had the authors of the fourth turning on before.
[00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:09.137]  It's historical cycle that's been documented.
[00:14:09.157 --> 00:14:16.181]  We're approaching the fourth turning right now, and the entrenched power structure knows that there's about to be a new renaissance.
[00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:20.143]  And they're really, really, really, really upset right now.
[00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:23.264]  Now let me tell you the news that's coming up.
[00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:28.025]  Moscow accuses Trump of returning to Cold War-style rhetoric in Cuba.
[00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:32.046]  Well, he's doing the right thing with Cuba, and I'll break down why.
[00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:33.887]  War with Russia.
[00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:35.387]  The Russians announce any U.S.
[00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.868]  warplanes flying over Syria will be treated as targets.
[00:14:40.288 --> 00:14:45.930]  And then I've got mainstream news articles saying you should be concerned about World War III.
[00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:51.599]  Why World War III is more of a threat than ever.
[00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.080]  Here it is out of the week.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.441]  Memo to America.
[00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:57.463]  You should still be terrified of World War III.
[00:14:58.383 --> 00:15:01.645]  Armed Russian jets come within five feet of US recon jet.
[00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:02.165]  Fox News.
[00:15:03.326 --> 00:15:11.431]  Yesterday I came out and started the broadcast off saying the United States and Russia are now in a standoff.
[00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:16.294]  The same type of standoff we saw in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.
[00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.620]  We're in the greatest danger we've been since then.
[00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.182]  This could easily trigger a new world war.
[00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:33.047]  Now that's what top analysts are saying, what top generals are saying, but then I saw liberal publications all over the place say, look at Jones's fear-mongering.
[00:15:34.388 --> 00:15:37.690]  Jones is saying this could kick off a larger world war.
[00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.113]  Ladies and gentlemen, that shows the delusional nature of liberals.
[00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:45.970]  That they're the main group that goes to North Korea.
[00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.012]  It is the trendy thing to do.
[00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:54.557]  If you already like communism and socialism, you know, bring your smartphone, whatever.
[00:15:55.017 --> 00:15:56.278]  Go on a tour to North Korea.
[00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:58.880]  Pose by the starving villagers.
[00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:00.321]  Make jokes about them.
[00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:01.663]  This is the culture.
[00:16:02.203 --> 00:16:07.968]  It's nasty and dirty to make fun of communist China and Venezuela and Cuba and say you hate America at the same time.
[00:16:09.684 --> 00:16:17.667]  But if you go there and you're not someone that hails communism and salutes the paramilitary forces, you'll be grabbed, you'll be tortured to death.
[00:16:18.307 --> 00:16:21.609]  And then the left will make jokes about it, as they've done now.
[00:16:23.089 --> 00:16:29.992]  That's right, The Huffington Post and others making their normal, standard jokes about Otto Warmbier.
[00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:38.395]  We're going to play some of those clips of what they've had to say about that situation.
[00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:40.178]  Truly.
[00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:41.960]  Truly.
[00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:44.001]  Disgusting.
[00:16:46.543 --> 00:16:48.905]  Now, that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:59.653]  Then I'm going to get into the stock market is at record highs, but the globalists admit they're trying to plunge it to stop the recovery.
[00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:07.700]  And that ties into even mainstream financial analysts are saying it is now time to break up Amazon.
[00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:11.833]  Amazon, ladies and gentlemen, is even putting Walmart out of business in many areas.
[00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:18.504]  Amazon, in the major metrics, is what is causing housing prices and building prices and real estate prices to plunge.
[00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:22.070]  Amazon has a
[00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:28.835]  It's an oligopoly that they've been allowed to set up with Communist China, with the globalists.
[00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:31.976]  Bezos is a total eugenicist centralizer.
[00:17:32.597 --> 00:17:33.877]  He's partnered with the CIA.
[00:17:34.097 --> 00:17:38.658]  He owns the Washington Post, who they admit is the main weapon system against Trump and the American people.
[00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:44.500]  Now, he recently met with Trump, showing a little bit of a capitulation, because they've tried to overthrow Trump.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.421]  They've tried to crush him.
[00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:46.561]  They've tried to destroy him.
[00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:47.321]  It's failed.
[00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:49.742]  And so now they're going and meeting with him.
[00:17:49.822 --> 00:17:50.402]  So is Google.
[00:17:50.742 --> 00:17:51.603]  Trump needs to know.
[00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:52.883]  They're never going to stop.
[00:17:54.278 --> 00:18:03.710]  They will kiss him to his face, they will kiss him on the neck, kiss him on the cheek, but behind his back, their organs will continue to savage and go after him.
[00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.352]  But because of the free market...
[00:18:06.914 --> 00:18:23.830]  And because of basic systems of Americana, our country, our economy, this delicate ecosystem that is a quasi-free market system, cannot operate with behemoths like Amazon, undercutting everybody, creating monopolies, who also censor libertarian and conservative information.
[00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:29.796]  Notice Amazon can be the biggest seller in the world of supplements and nutraceuticals, a lot of them total crap.
[00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:31.318]  FDA does nothing.
[00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:41.203]  But the cleanest, best organizations that put out the most highly certified, quality products get harassed because they're not mega giants.
[00:18:41.563 --> 00:18:43.286]  Notice MSM attacks us all day.
[00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:49.708]  Because we sell bio-true selenium, the purest, highest quality selenium that we can find out there.
[00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:54.951]  Or we sell high quality vitamin, mineral, fruit punch, amino acid drinks that are super popular.
[00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:56.751]  I mean, we got to the top labs in the country.
[00:18:56.932 --> 00:19:00.673]  But it's snake oil when we sell shampoo or fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:19:00.953 --> 00:19:02.034]  We're not allowed to exist.
[00:19:02.094 --> 00:19:03.094]  We're conspiracy theorists.
[00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:04.675]  Everything we do is evil and bad.
[00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:05.675]  But!
[00:19:07.576 --> 00:19:13.699]  Bezos can sell any nutraceutical supplement he wants from total crap to super high quality.
[00:19:16.032 --> 00:19:16.613]  But it gets worse.
[00:19:16.673 --> 00:19:17.674]  Now he bought Whole Foods.
[00:19:18.856 --> 00:19:25.424]  Of the almost 40 products we've got, 10 of them are made by top labs that produce for Whole Foods and we private label.
[00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:29.349]  And the word is, politically, they may not let us anymore.
[00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:32.794]  Bezos is a piece of work!
[00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:38.626]  Bezos, he can sell you supplements I can't see, because he's God.
[00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:44.890]  It's good when he sells them, when I sell them it's bad, because I'm not allowed to have an economy, and you're not allowed to have an economy.
[00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.692]  Patriots, Christians, Conservatives, we're not allowed to have anything!
[00:19:48.172 --> 00:20:02.021]  That's why it's an act of resistance and rebellion when you buy products at Infowarsstore.com from our little high-quality, secure shopping cart, and not from Amazon, that globalist, anti-gun, anti-Christian, pro-Islamic turd basket.
[00:20:03.573 --> 00:20:03.873]  Fully.
[00:20:04.294 --> 00:20:15.981]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:20:16.562 --> 00:20:18.643]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:20:18.823 --> 00:20:21.645]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:23.406]  It's made in the USA.
[00:20:24.027 --> 00:20:24.147]  It's
[00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:25.727]  We're good to go!
[00:20:47.318 --> 00:20:47.538]  I think?
[00:21:09.508 --> 00:21:09.988]  When it comes
[00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:38.999]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:47.321]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:54.263]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:59.049]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:21:59.509 --> 00:22:03.312]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:18.192]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:22:19.152 --> 00:22:27.717]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:28.878]  And it's simple.
[00:22:29.498 --> 00:22:34.561]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:36.102]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:22:36.122 --> 00:22:38.904]  There's quality versus price.
[00:22:38.964 --> 00:22:40.866]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:54.455]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[00:22:55.814 --> 00:22:58.035]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:22:58.275 --> 00:23:09.119]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:10.940]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.061]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:20.744]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:23:21.244 --> 00:23:33.051]  We used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:38.394]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at M4WarStore.com right now.
[00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:40.735]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:45.738]  And we shot everything you can imagine at it.
[00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:53.037]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:23:53.517 --> 00:23:55.540]  It's a win-win.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:55.540]  $200.
[00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.105]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:23:59.165 --> 00:23:59.866]  It's amazing.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:34.242]  So Jeff Bezos, and I'm going to come back in the next segment and get into all the other news I mentioned from North Korea to what's happening with the globalists trying to start a civil war and so much more.
[00:24:34.762 --> 00:24:39.563]  Jeff Bezos is totally anti-gun, an absolute globalist elitist.
[00:24:40.403 --> 00:24:51.765]  He's been allowed to have multinational deals with European countries, socialist countries, communist countries that no one else is allowed to have because he works on centralizing control and propping up corrupt regimes.
[00:24:52.725 --> 00:25:00.223]  He's partnered with the CIA with 600 million last year that Obama gave him to try to defeat Trump and to funnel that money.
[00:25:01.226 --> 00:25:02.026]  Through Amazon.
[00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:06.249]  The CIA now runs their main servers through Amazon.com.
[00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:12.813]  So Amazon.com is a leftist globalist utility of the leftist deep state and government.
[00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:13.893]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:15.294]  That's a total definition.
[00:25:15.554 --> 00:25:16.415]  You heard it here first.
[00:25:17.435 --> 00:25:22.838]  And he finally went to the White House in the last few days and looked completely freaked out being up there with Trump.
[00:25:23.178 --> 00:25:29.282]  But at least he's being forced to now go and claim he's not going to try to destroy Trump or butcher our economy.
[00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:37.721]  The problem is, if you dig through the news, even mainline analysts are saying the real estate market commercially is plunging because of Amazon.
[00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:54.557]  And so, if you expand on that, you look at all these other parts of the economy, it's only going down even that much faster and accelerating our journey to being a third world country.
[00:25:55.418 --> 00:25:56.739]  So we have to ask ourselves,
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.200]  What should Trump do?
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:10.505]  Well, under the 1906 Sherman Antitrust Act, Amazon shouldn't be able to control the market for retail to a point that even kills Walmart.
[00:26:10.705 --> 00:26:12.646]  Walmart killed Main Street.
[00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:22.630]  Amazon is killing competitiveness, the economy, the upwardly mobile wage, real estate, diversity, everything.
[00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.631]  It's absolutely crazy.
[00:26:27.688 --> 00:26:46.617]  But you notice so many of the leftist real estate owners, they've all been for globalism, they've all been for socialism, they've all been for NAFTA and GATT, they bought into, we won't be an industrial economy, we won't be an agrarian economy, we won't be a localized economy, we'll be a global economy, and we'll have a service economy.
[00:26:46.937 --> 00:26:52.242]  And so Main Street went, ooooh, and the retail stores went, ooooh.
[00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:55.245]  Wow, we really want this globalism.
[00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:57.147]  This is going to be so good for us.
[00:26:57.627 --> 00:27:02.311]  And now the service economy is the fastest part of the economy imploding.
[00:27:03.012 --> 00:27:18.551]  And Trump's running in, trying to rebuild the industrial, trying to rebuild the infrastructure, trying to rebuild the agrarian, the farming, trying to kick-start it all, because there are thousands of regulations designed where it's impossible!
[00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:21.533]  To have different types of smelting facilities.
[00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:26.374]  Where it's impossible to have all these different types of operations.
[00:27:27.234 --> 00:27:32.436]  And they're the globalists, the Jeff Bezoses and everybody else, that know they're creating an economy that's meant to implode.
[00:27:32.796 --> 00:27:33.857]  Controlled austerity.
[00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:40.919]  Where then they're the only corporations left standing, exploiting what's left of the West, using third world and communist Chinese slave labor.
[00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:44.240]  A total global financial takeover.
[00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.467]  But this is what the left wanted.
[00:27:50.147 --> 00:28:07.298]  Nice, fake, trendy, you know, guys with their shaved heads, their little chicken necks, talking in effeminate voices like they're non-threatening, using class warfare, funding Black Lives Matter, funding open borders, funding the smashing of the nation-state, funding the total takeover of the culture.
[00:28:08.719 --> 00:28:11.061]  And then it's your very destruction.
[00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:14.083]  Your very disenfranchisement.
[00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:25.011]  So Amazon can operate all day, but they shouldn't be able to have monopolistic practices, which they're famous for, and they shouldn't be able to come in and buy whole foods.
[00:28:26.952 --> 00:28:45.007]  And they shouldn't be selectively left alone by regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, like they are, to be able to just do whatever they want, and then give huge financial contributions to politicians, and then those very politicians then sick the regulators on tens of thousands of other smaller, high-quality companies.
[00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:47.685]  That's what this is really all about.
[00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:49.627]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:28:50.268 --> 00:28:52.831]  We're gonna come back and get into all the really hardcore serious news, but...
[00:28:54.565 --> 00:29:11.636]  President Trump needs to know when Google, and when Facebook, and when Amazon, the big three, go and meet with him, they're absolutely lying to his face, because everything he represents, the average person being self-sufficient, the average person being successful, is the antithesis of what these globalists are actually wanting.
[00:29:11.836 --> 00:29:14.318]  They are cold-blooded consolidators of power.
[00:29:14.678 --> 00:29:19.481]  They are sociopathic, psychopathic control freaks, openly at war with the President.
[00:29:21.212 --> 00:29:28.976]  The president needs to understand that Bezos is the man heading up the Washington Post, and it's a project to lie about him, to slander him, and to destroy him.
[00:29:30.577 --> 00:29:43.443]  Say what you want about Trump, but he's got the eye of the New World Order against him, and he's trying to desperately turn the economy back on, and if people don't get behind him and push hard and realize the problem is the Republican Congress that's a bunch of cowards, they're the enemy.
[00:29:44.727 --> 00:29:45.548]  Trump's not the enemy.
[00:29:45.588 --> 00:29:47.912]  The Democrats and the Republican leadership, they're the enemy.
[00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:52.098]  They stand in the way of our prosperity and our future and they want to enslave us.
[00:30:03.783 --> 00:30:06.706]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[00:30:06.866 --> 00:30:15.854]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[00:30:15.934 --> 00:30:25.103]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands, as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:29.647]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event.
[00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:36.932]  And then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[00:30:37.172 --> 00:30:43.396]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[00:30:43.636 --> 00:30:50.240]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be proud, CNN is ISIS.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.061]  While the protesters were all arrested,
[00:30:52.381 --> 00:31:00.903]  Rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[00:31:01.023 --> 00:31:03.604]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:04.404 --> 00:31:07.925]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:08.385 --> 00:31:14.447]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:17.648]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:18.008 --> 00:31:21.029]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:24.652]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:24.993 --> 00:31:26.754]  The left controls culture.
[00:31:26.774 --> 00:31:27.755]  They control arts.
[00:31:27.835 --> 00:31:29.057]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:29.357 --> 00:31:36.444]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:36.504 --> 00:31:38.906]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:31:39.387 --> 00:31:43.250]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.372]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:31:45.993 --> 00:31:51.355]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:31:51.616 --> 00:31:57.858]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:57.938 --> 00:31:59.639]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:00.980]  It's available right now.

[00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:01.932]  Available at InfowarsStore.com
[00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:34.156]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.634 --> 00:33:57.297]  So, Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon, the biggest company in the world.
[00:33:57.338 --> 00:33:58.398]  He's the richest man in the world.
[00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:09.707]  He's a big liberal for class warfare and he funds Black Lives Matter and all the anti-police violence with George Soros and he works with all these dictatorships around the world getting slave goods brought in.
[00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:25.178]  And if Walmart killed Main Street, well, Amazon's killing real estate, communities, basically total de-industrialization, and he's been waging war against Trump, who wanted to simply give us the same power price as China has, and then simply wanted to turn our power plants back on.
[00:34:25.578 --> 00:34:37.027]  Well, he was forced to go be part of this summit yesterday, because Trump is defeating him, we're defeating him, so he went to the summit, but bugged his eyes out, and basically acted like he hated President Trump.
[00:34:40.765 --> 00:34:42.606]  And again, I want to just warn the world.
[00:34:42.686 --> 00:34:50.828]  Bezos and other globalists are snakes that want to suppress our economy, that want to dominate and totally control our civilization and our society.
[00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:53.849]  And Trump is trying to turn our economy back on.
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.890]  That is why they are so upset.
[00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:03.393]  That is why they are so mad, because they have an economic consolidation plan, just like they do in the third world.
[00:35:03.653 --> 00:35:06.734]  They have 99% of people poor and a tiny 1% at the top.
[00:35:08.353 --> 00:35:18.155]  But when you look at where half the wealth in the world already is, we've done the math before, it's .00000000004.2 or something.
[00:35:18.175 --> 00:35:19.736]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:21.316]  It's not one-tenth of one percent.
[00:35:21.576 --> 00:35:24.197]  It's not one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth percent.
[00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:25.917]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:27.417]  The math is staggering.
[00:35:27.898 --> 00:35:37.720]  Out of seven and a half billion people, different estimates are out there, but some estimates show that just the top one-tenth of one percent has half the wealth.
[00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:43.069]  And then it's the 1% that has like 80% of the wealth, depending on how you slice the numbers.
[00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:45.651]  It's just incredible.
[00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:59.161]  But the Bezoses and the Lloyd Blankfeins of the world, they are funding the massive leftist ideology because it's incompatible with a free market society.
[00:35:59.622 --> 00:36:02.144]  And they want to wreck the ladder up for everybody else.
[00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:03.825]  It's a fact North Korea is a hellhole.
[00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:06.067]  It's a fact that Soviet Russia was a hellhole.
[00:36:06.428 --> 00:36:09.010]  It's a fact that Eastern Europe got wrecked by communism.
[00:36:09.311 --> 00:36:14.176]  It's a fact that Latin American countries that adopted it went from wealthy to poor almost overnight.
[00:36:14.496 --> 00:36:15.337]  It's a fact!
[00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:18.801]  It creates a top-down bullying nightmare situation.
[00:36:20.865 --> 00:36:39.205]  But you've got lots of lazy children of children of children who grew up in the lap of luxury and don't want to work and just know how to bitch and complain all day who want to pull down what's left of our sputtering, faltering free market that's got black smoke coming out the back and is operating maybe at 10% of capacity.
[00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:50.635]  And even at 10% of its capacity, conservatively, they're complaining and hating it with their smartphones, with their designer shirts, with their designer shoes, in their cars, in their apartments.
[00:36:50.715 --> 00:36:58.378]  Even the poorest of the trendies is wealthier than people in most parts of the world, but they hate it because they lust for conquest.
[00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:00.679]  They've never really been in a fight.
[00:37:00.759 --> 00:37:02.259]  They've never really run a business.
[00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:03.660]  They've never been in the military.
[00:37:04.721 --> 00:37:12.803]  But they imagine the great social structures coming down and them ruling things and them being bosses and executives.
[00:37:13.303 --> 00:37:18.405]  And people like Bezos know their psychology, they know their mindset, they know who they are.
[00:37:18.425 --> 00:37:23.446]  And it's totally disgusting to watch them played.
[00:37:25.047 --> 00:37:25.207]  Now,
[00:37:31.212 --> 00:37:35.457]  I've got a lot to cover and a lot to break down and obviously go over here today.
[00:37:35.477 --> 00:37:45.389]  Hannity has come out and agreed with Infowars that NBC should release the full hours and hours and hours of interview I did with Megyn Kelly.
[00:37:46.505 --> 00:37:56.948]  Even New Yorker Magazine and others say it looks totally edited and jump cut where it's indistinguishable what I was saying to make me look like a stammering, blubbering buffoon.
[00:37:57.548 --> 00:38:02.470]  They interviewed me for, off and on, 4 hours over 12 hours they were here.
[00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.550]  Roughly.
[00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.671]  9.30 in the morning till almost 11 at night.
[00:38:05.711 --> 00:38:06.571]  So more than 12 hours.
[00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:13.333]  And then they have maybe 2 minutes of me in 19 minutes blubbering and stammering.
[00:38:14.173 --> 00:38:15.914]  Anyone that's heard the show knows.
[00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:22.716]  That I'm teleprompter free and I'm the opposite of blubbering and stammering.
[00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:30.777]  But that if you listen for an hour, I will get ahead of myself and a few times stammer or stutter because I'm so excited.
[00:38:31.618 --> 00:38:32.458]  Or I'll pause.
[00:38:34.258 --> 00:38:37.459]  And that's all they did was cut it together to make me look like a buffoon.
[00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:41.320]  But people hate mainstream media so much that we now have the ratings.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.861]  She not only had the lowest ratings for Dateline NBC in its 20-plus year history, 3.5 million viewers,
[00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:57.764]  According to the Daily Mail, according to Variety, according to the Nielsen ratings, she had the lowest ratings in her slot in all of broadcast television.
[00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:02.165]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:39:03.185 --> 00:39:12.168]  And they posted it on NBC News site days ago, it only had 179,000 views, when our videos about it have 20 plus million views.
[00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:17.493]  I mean, you know, I shouldn't have been interviewed by her.
[00:39:17.513 --> 00:39:19.674]  This is kind of like the final nail in the coffin.
[00:39:21.295 --> 00:39:26.318]  It is such a joke to be on a show like that.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:37.865]  It shows how there's nothing more uncool than being on mainstream television and being associated with Hollywood or any of it.
[00:39:38.565 --> 00:39:39.626]  Our listeners hate it.
[00:39:41.616 --> 00:39:47.299]  They love seeing us troll her and release part of the behind the scenes early to show she's a liar, but they're sick of hearing about her.
[00:39:47.659 --> 00:39:49.420]  But Hannity's right.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:55.243]  He got interviewed by Ted Koppel and said that Ted edited it together to make him look like an idiot.
[00:39:57.164 --> 00:40:02.627]  Another guy that can think on his feet better than almost anybody, Sean Hannity, that was edited, remember, a few months ago to be fake?
[00:40:04.048 --> 00:40:04.669]  And it's the same thing.
[00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:05.850]  So Hannity has said, release it.
[00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.591]  That's going to come up.
[00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.313]  Colonel Schaefer warns a bloody civil war, societal collapse.
[00:40:09.554 --> 00:40:10.775]  That's really our biggest news.
[00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:12.076]  It all ties together.
[00:40:12.917 --> 00:40:20.425]  But before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:22.507]  And we've never had this many viewers.
[00:40:22.527 --> 00:40:23.748]  We've never had this many listeners.
[00:40:24.249 --> 00:40:25.670]  But they've gone after our sponsors.
[00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.012]  They've kicked us off Google Ads.
[00:40:28.507 --> 00:40:33.709]  Another reason Google's a monopoly is they won't even give conservatives and libertarians access to the marketplace.
[00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.271]  That's beyond.
[00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.111]  That's discriminatory.
[00:40:37.131 --> 00:40:38.051]  That's beyond monopoly.
[00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:39.712]  That's what the left wants.
[00:40:39.752 --> 00:40:45.395]  They want to put us all in electronic ghettos that Matt Drudge warned about a year and a half ago, where they have total control.
[00:40:45.415 --> 00:40:46.976]  That's why we've got to build our own systems.
[00:40:47.316 --> 00:40:49.777]  But Amazon and others won't even let us basically do that.
[00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:53.274]  Because they're trying to smother us.
[00:40:53.294 --> 00:40:54.594]  They're trying to stop us from growing.
[00:40:54.835 --> 00:41:01.798]  But InfoWars has grown to be the biggest resistance multimedia arm out there in the face of the New World Order.
[00:41:02.698 --> 00:41:07.680]  There's Drudge that's so huge, being able to focus on stories and get people talking about certain subjects.
[00:41:07.981 --> 00:41:09.181]  And Drudge is the biggest thing out there.
[00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.722]  And then there's InfoWars.
[00:41:15.144 --> 00:41:17.405]  Breitbart is having massive revenue problems.
[00:41:18.703 --> 00:41:25.725]  Daily Caller, all of them are in deep trouble, because conservatives thought Trump won, they thought that was the big battle, they can go to sleep.
[00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:46.030]  The big war started, as you can see, when Trump won, and we got that beachhead, because if they let him get good Supreme Court justices in, and if they let him cut taxes, and if they let him kill Obamacare, and if they let him secure the borders, and if they let him get us out of TPP, unelected global government, and if they let him kill the carbon tax, they're done!
[00:41:47.278 --> 00:41:56.962]  The globalists hijacked America and built this global, unelected monstrosity on fraud, and now the President, under the Constitution, is killing it, one step at a time.
[00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:58.342]  They don't know what to do!
[00:41:59.203 --> 00:42:01.784]  They're openly marketing and pushing for his death!
[00:42:02.424 --> 00:42:05.385]  They're openly calling for his overthrow, and they want my overthrow!
[00:42:07.537 --> 00:42:13.940]  And I am so honored that we saw the biggest, most disgusting, filthy, edited, twisted hit piece in history.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:19.742]  They've never put a more one-sided hit piece out and admitted it was a one-sided hit piece.
[00:42:20.682 --> 00:42:22.983]  And got all the publications to cheer for a hit piece.
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:26.405]  And the public tuned out and didn't want to hear it.
[00:42:27.225 --> 00:42:28.706]  We had record views and listeners.
[00:42:30.066 --> 00:42:33.468]  Our coverage had 20 plus million views on videos alone.
[00:42:34.858 --> 00:42:36.640]  That's just counting my videos and Cernovich's.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.862]  I didn't have time to go count up all the other videos on it.
[00:42:39.443 --> 00:42:42.646]  But the pro Alex Jones, pro InfoWars, 20 plus million.
[00:42:43.246 --> 00:42:45.669]  She had 3.5 on the broadcast.
[00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:52.816]  As of this morning, 179,000 on NBC News' YouTube.
[00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:54.518]  No one wants to watch it!
[00:42:55.759 --> 00:42:56.780]  We got 20 million.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.642]  She's got less than 4 million.
[00:43:01.644 --> 00:43:03.628]  Again, that shows how they don't matter.
[00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:06.933]  And Congress needs to know, call MSM's bluff.
[00:43:07.394 --> 00:43:14.387]  Stop being so scared of them when they call you a racist, or call you a demon, or call you a child molester, or call you all these things that they are.
[00:43:15.976 --> 00:43:24.584]  So much of Congress is still absolutely lapdog and loves to go on Meet the Press and loves to go on Face the Nation and loves to feel like they're part of the establishment.
[00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:25.404]  No!
[00:43:25.725 --> 00:43:26.866]  That's the plague!
[00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:31.670]  And that final illusion is falling and that's why they're so scared.
[00:43:33.432 --> 00:43:35.934]  But that said, we need financial support more than ever.
[00:43:36.034 --> 00:43:37.836]  I would ask all the listeners to commit.

[00:44:24.498 --> 00:44:27.259]  I'm going to call it the Summer Special.
[00:44:27.299 --> 00:44:29.780]  Support Patriot Media, Summer Mega Specials.

[00:45:19.255 --> 00:45:20.316]  It's not select foods.
[00:45:20.376 --> 00:45:21.956]  It's the whole line of MyPatriot.

[00:45:35.719 --> 00:45:36.739]  It's essential for the summer.
[00:45:37.539 --> 00:45:39.760]  Living Defense, the Parasite Cleanse.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.340]  20% off.

[00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:46.301]  Living Defense can sell out the next few days.
[00:45:48.447 --> 00:45:50.708]  Go read about the secrets of nascent iodine.
[00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:55.911]  We have the true, purest, deep-earth crystal source that anybody's found out there and put into a supplement.
[00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:57.112]  Learn about that.

[00:46:01.654 --> 00:46:06.877]  Why Brain Force is such an amazing nootropic for the brain and why it's so popular on third-party sites.
[00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:13.561]  But whatever you do, support the broadcast and pray for us because we've got the enemy's attention and we represent the defense of free speech.
[00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:15.002]  We represent the Republic.
[00:46:15.382 --> 00:46:16.564]  We represent religious freedom.
[00:46:16.844 --> 00:46:20.530]  We represent the fight against radical Islam that doesn't recognize religious freedom.
[00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.714]  We represent the fight for families.
[00:46:23.154 --> 00:46:28.082]  We represent the defense of the West for no matter what color you are, but for the Renaissance.
[00:46:28.905 --> 00:46:31.286]  And we're fighting as hard as we can.
[00:46:31.846 --> 00:46:40.248]  And whether it's Patriot t-shirts to meet like-minded people and spread the word, or whether it is high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, we have the widest selection, lowest prices.
[00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:45.910]  It's all available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.511]  And I want to salute all of you that have stood up to the bullies at CNN and that have charged their
[00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.531]  Alright, thank you all for the support.
[00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:54.231]  It is essential.
[00:47:24.505 --> 00:47:25.045]  Civil War.
[00:47:28.068 --> 00:47:36.314]  The left is on every publication they own, TV shows, dramas, plays, saying kill the president, kill his family, kill his supporters.
[00:47:36.614 --> 00:47:41.978]  And people are getting beat up in the head with clubs, with bike locks, they're getting stabbed.
[00:47:43.399 --> 00:47:44.179]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.141]  The Islamists know this is their time.
[00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:49.944]  There were two more Islamist attacks in England and France today.
[00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:52.866]  People running folks over with cars, stabbing people.
[00:47:54.636 --> 00:48:00.580]  The leftists are activating, stabbing patriot activists in places like New York and in California today.
[00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:10.806]  We are seeing communists here in Austin openly attacking our camera crew and our reporters and having semi-automatic rifles with their fingers on the triggers.
[00:48:11.226 --> 00:48:12.807]  I mean, they are ready to go.
[00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:15.069]  They are ready to bring in the civil emergency.
[00:48:16.107 --> 00:48:25.250]  And if we act like cowards during the civil emergency and let Soros dictate like Ukraine and like the Arab Spring, step down Trump and we'll stop burning cities.
[00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:41.335]  If our military and our police and our citizenry don't then offensively, in a defensive move, in a counter move, politically get back in their faces and also defend ourselves from physical attacks, they will intimidate the nation into a new dark age.
[00:48:42.115 --> 00:48:44.015]  Think Bolshevik Revolution 1917, but Americana style.
[00:48:47.093 --> 00:48:48.314]  They believe this is their time.
[00:48:48.835 --> 00:48:49.715]  They're making their move.
[00:48:50.436 --> 00:48:57.042]  Here is Colonel Schaefer, black ops, dialed into everything, telling you exactly what I've been laying out for a while.
[00:48:57.323 --> 00:49:01.266]  They're planning for a COG emergency after they start a civil war.
[00:49:01.787 --> 00:49:03.729]  We're in a total war, an information war.
[00:49:03.749 --> 00:49:05.370]  They're trying to bring our president down.
[00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.071]  Here's the clip.
[00:49:07.017 --> 00:49:07.798]  This is the issue.
[00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:17.264]  If the governments who are responsible for our common welfare, common good and defense are shown to be ineffective, people on the opposite side are going to rise up.
[00:49:17.684 --> 00:49:27.331]  So what you see here is the automatic response, force on force, of certain folks coming back to essentially create, to retaliate.
[00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:29.632]  So again, the pathology is clear.
[00:49:30.253 --> 00:49:35.196]  If one side begins to act violently, you have inevitably the other side starting to come back.
[00:49:35.276 --> 00:49:36.056]  It always happens.
[00:49:37.137 --> 00:49:42.939]  We have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left, you'll see more violence on the right and retaliation.
[00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:43.539]  It's inevitable.
[00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:46.360]  Colonel, you fight in war zones.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.901]  People are getting way too crazy about politics.
[00:49:49.261 --> 00:49:51.022]  These are a difference in philosophy.
[00:49:51.462 --> 00:49:55.623]  We shouldn't be shooting at each other and trying to stab each other, rushing in stages.
[00:49:55.983 --> 00:49:56.843]  It's out of control.
[00:49:56.943 --> 00:49:59.544]  Hopefully people, rational people, will dial it back.
[00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:04.586]  I didn't think I'd have to tap into your terrorism knowledge for these segments, but sadly we do.
[00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:10.935]  We should get that clip from a month ago when we wrote an article about it where he said there's an information war against the president.
[00:50:11.436 --> 00:50:13.518]  This is a deep state war trying to overthrow the president.
[00:50:13.798 --> 00:50:16.540]  We should take that clip with that clip and put it together because here's the problem.
[00:50:18.021 --> 00:50:25.468]  It's totally authorized when they're doing a simulated murder of the president and pushing it to get other people to do it at a government funded event.
[00:50:26.564 --> 00:50:34.709]  When the left's rushing the stage and taking over everywhere else, to then rush the stage and say, no more political violence, stop shooting members of Congress, stop shooting cops in the back.
[00:50:35.009 --> 00:50:36.990]  The left is 99% of this violence.
[00:50:37.571 --> 00:50:42.514]  So in a threat continuum, we're just using information war to try to stop their physical attack.
[00:50:43.194 --> 00:50:46.556]  Because if we don't do that, it's going to then break into physical violence.
[00:50:46.937 --> 00:50:48.738]  I'm encouraging people to hold the line.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:56.727]  Like Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, and not offensively strike back because it's politically hurting the left.
[00:50:57.347 --> 00:51:01.131]  But then if they launch a full offensive, then we've got to really launch back physically.
[00:51:05.802 --> 00:51:13.185]  This is one of the most amazing stories I've seen in years to take us behind the curtain of fake corporate news.
[00:51:13.685 --> 00:51:18.927]  CNN's famous in 1991 for saying they were hit with a Scud missile in Tel Aviv with nerve gas.
[00:51:18.967 --> 00:51:21.628]  They were in CNN Center in Atlanta.
[00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:26.930]  Everybody knows about that because they don't want other citizens being there, you know, jumping on camera saying things, basically.
[00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.851]  So they do it from their studios.
[00:51:29.431 --> 00:51:30.832]  And then they claim they're out there on the ground.
[00:51:30.852 --> 00:51:31.753]  Well, this is different.
[00:51:31.873 --> 00:51:37.759]  This is getting a fake demonstration together with a bunch of signs they hand out to have, quote, Muslims say, let's come together.
[00:51:37.779 --> 00:51:39.040]  We're sorry for the terror attack.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.741]  But that's not really happening or going on.
[00:51:40.962 --> 00:51:42.043]  So they have to produce it.
[00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:43.024]  It's a PR event.
[00:51:43.084 --> 00:51:44.225]  So Mark Antro.
[00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:47.807]  He's on Twitter at Twitter at MarkAnfro.com.
[00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:48.647]  You're there in London.
[00:51:48.687 --> 00:51:56.071]  Give us your overall view of what's happening in the world, what you're witnessing unfold, and the fact that your story now is in hundreds of news sites.
[00:51:56.552 --> 00:52:00.734]  CNN's responded saying, OK, we did stage it, but it was a real demonstration.
[00:52:01.054 --> 00:52:02.175]  Cernovich predicted this.
[00:52:02.215 --> 00:52:06.697]  They'd say, oh, we did stage it, but we went and found real people to come be part of it.
[00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.598]  Well, I mean, who knows if they'd stage this?
[00:52:08.678 --> 00:52:11.440]  What won't they stage, Mark?
[00:52:12.564 --> 00:52:14.505]  I mean, I'm just lost for words.
[00:52:14.645 --> 00:52:27.348]  I mean, if we have some context, weekend before last, ISIS put out the threat over Ramadan that it's going to be a holy month of war, following the Westminster attacks and the Manchester attacks.
[00:52:28.068 --> 00:52:33.370]  People are saying people in London aren't scared and that we're carrying on as normal.
[00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.710]  We're not.
[00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:38.794]  The media's portraying one thing, and people are feeling very, very different.
[00:52:39.074 --> 00:52:40.896]  So I suppose that's my initial take.
[00:52:41.637 --> 00:52:53.206]  To your point around CNN faking the narrative, I mean, it's just morally bankrupt as far as I'm concerned.
[00:52:53.367 --> 00:53:00.152]  But at the very beginning of the clip, you'll notice we've got, I think her name's Becky, setting up the scene with CNN.
[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:01.414]  I mean, you clearly see
[00:53:02.794 --> 00:53:04.255]  Becky lining the shot up.
[00:53:04.275 --> 00:53:10.657]  You'll see BBC, who are next, start waving and setting up a scene with them, telling them to get into shot.
[00:53:11.237 --> 00:53:12.498]  This is what gets me.
[00:53:12.518 --> 00:53:14.278]  So the scene's about to go live.
[00:53:14.318 --> 00:53:16.139]  I'm not sure if you've got the audio there.
[00:53:16.599 --> 00:53:17.960]  But Becky starts the scene.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.141]  After setting it up, a whole false pretense.
[00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:24.122]  And she opens up and her opening line is,
[00:53:24.822 --> 00:53:26.324]  This is a wonderful scene here.
[00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:28.385]  And so you hear me laugh.
[00:53:28.766 --> 00:53:31.268]  And I go, that's because you've put the scene together.
[00:53:31.628 --> 00:53:33.810]  And the BBC director laughed with me.
[00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:36.573]  I mean, they know.
[00:53:36.893 --> 00:53:37.674]  They know it's fake.
[00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:41.897]  So while CNN is saying, yes, these are sincere Muslims.
[00:53:41.937 --> 00:53:42.798]  They are against ISIS.
[00:53:42.878 --> 00:53:44.760]  I'm not disputing that for a second.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:50.545]  But what I'm saying is how false the pretence it is, how staged it was.
[00:53:50.805 --> 00:53:53.948]  And for Becky to stand there and go, this is a poignant scene.
[00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:56.891]  It's a poignant scene because your script is a poignant scene.
[00:53:57.171 --> 00:54:00.955]  It's not a poignant scene because that's the truth and reality.
[00:54:01.075 --> 00:54:02.897]  I think to me that's a real issue here.
[00:54:29.863 --> 00:54:33.344]  So, Megyn Kelly has totally flopped.
[00:54:33.364 --> 00:54:37.004]  She has the lowest ratings in the history of NBC's Dateline.
[00:54:37.925 --> 00:54:43.906]  And now we learned the lowest ratings in all the broadcast TV slots, according to Nielsen ratings that was picked up by the Daily Mail.
[00:54:45.494 --> 00:54:47.636]  So folks would ask then, why are we still covering it?
[00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:49.157]  Because they threw everything they had at us.
[00:54:49.278 --> 00:54:49.998]  They edited it.
[00:54:50.058 --> 00:54:50.719]  They twisted it.
[00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:52.160]  They took it out of context.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.383]  We're gonna be releasing the full interview very very soon at the end of the week.
[00:54:58.205 --> 00:55:01.828]  But, the big issue here is what are they going to do now?
[00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:07.573]  Separate from that, Sean Hannity, who broke down the fact that Ted Koppel,
[00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:21.043]  He came out with that interview last year where he basically edited Sean Hannity together, extremely deceptively.
[00:55:21.424 --> 00:55:28.869]  And so Hannity has said it's now time to release the tapes of the Alex Jones interview and let the American people decide.
[00:55:28.889 --> 00:55:30.130]  He's not attacking Megyn Kelly.
[00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:31.711]  He's being very friendly about it.
[00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:34.393]  He's saying let's just let the American people decide.
[00:55:34.453 --> 00:55:35.594]  And that's exactly what I said.
[00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:38.536]  Release it on NBC News website.
[00:55:39.591 --> 00:55:42.673]  And then people can see what the producers really did.
[00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:43.273]  Here it is.
[00:55:45.314 --> 00:55:52.579]  All right, so during last night's interview, NBC News host Megyn Kelly, my former colleague, pressed Jones on some of his conspiracy theories.
[00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:57.422]  But out of the hours of video apparently they taped, NBC only aired a few minutes of it.
[00:55:57.782 --> 00:56:02.344]  Now, Jones has called for NBC to release the full, unedited version of the interview.
[00:56:02.785 --> 00:56:05.166]  And by the way, in this case, I have to agree.
[00:56:05.206 --> 00:56:08.048]  Whether you agree or disagree with him, this is the right thing to do.
[00:56:08.388 --> 00:56:09.549]  I want to be very clear.
[00:56:09.569 --> 00:56:16.896]  I am in no way, as some in social media have suggested, being critical of my colleague and somebody who I've been friends with, Megyn Kelly.
[00:56:17.196 --> 00:56:18.217]  She is a journalist.
[00:56:18.237 --> 00:56:19.238]  She was doing her job.
[00:56:19.338 --> 00:56:25.943]  But I do believe NBC News should release the tapes, the full tapes of the Alex Jones interview.
[00:56:26.164 --> 00:56:27.425]  Let Americans decide.
[00:56:27.785 --> 00:56:29.547]  Isn't that what websites are now for?
[00:56:30.087 --> 00:56:33.430]  Shouldn't NBC let you, the American public, see everything?
[00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:37.171]  Everything that was said, and then they can decide for themselves what to think.
[00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:44.934]  Now, I say this because I'm a little sick and tired of the mainstream media, news media editing interviews to fit a predetermined narrative.
[00:56:45.294 --> 00:56:47.275]  Again, I'm not saying Megyn Kelly did this.
[00:56:47.355 --> 00:56:48.476]  As a matter of fact, I know she didn't.
[00:56:48.956 --> 00:56:55.658]  And I really do hate to disappoint all of you people in the media that would love to see a battle and fight break out between Megyn Kelly.
[00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:56.779]  That's not happening.
[00:56:57.719 --> 00:57:05.163]  I truly wish her the best, but you may remember just a few months ago, back in March, I was the focus of fake edited news.
[00:57:05.543 --> 00:57:11.185]  I had agreed to do an interview with CBS and their Sunday morning program and their special contributor, Ted Koppel.
[00:57:11.526 --> 00:57:16.408]  The interview lasted nearly 50 minutes, as we discussed, in great detail, great special
[00:57:16.488 --> 00:57:16.748]  Thank you.
[00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:43.911]  I'm going to play the whole segment from Fox.
[00:57:43.971 --> 00:57:47.052]  I never do that, but we're the subject of it, so we can be of fair use.
[00:57:47.072 --> 00:57:54.554]  I don't think Kennedy has a problem, because he's one of the only real journalists left on broadcast and cable television, because he is on some broadcast.
[00:57:54.614 --> 00:57:56.535]  Fox stations around the country broadcast as well.
[00:57:56.955 --> 00:58:05.138]  Very popular show, but 5 million viewers just on cable alone, another 5 million or so on other stations, so he is the king of cable news.
[00:58:05.538 --> 00:58:10.280]  They try to spin it and say it's racial maddow, but the larger point here is that
[00:58:11.752 --> 00:58:16.684]  That's what websites are for, and you'd have more ratings and more listeners, and people would do interviews then and then trust you.
[00:58:16.984 --> 00:58:21.495]  Okay, put out your edited version on the big broadcast, but on the internet, put out the raw.
[00:58:22.761 --> 00:58:24.042]  100-plus minute interview we did.
[00:58:24.062 --> 00:58:25.822]  That was just one of four interviews.
[00:58:26.162 --> 00:58:31.324]  We did one in the hallway, one in the control room, one in here, one in the car, one at the restaurant.
[00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:33.564]  Okay, that's more than four interviews.
[00:58:33.584 --> 00:58:35.285]  We did like five, six interviews?
[00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:39.446]  Just released the one big sit-down, and hear what I really had to say.
[00:58:39.846 --> 00:58:43.367]  Hour number two, straight ahead, live, uncensored, unfiltered.
[00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:44.647]  It's the InfoWarm.
[00:58:45.308 --> 00:58:47.468]  Welcome to GCN.
[00:58:47.488 --> 00:58:48.489]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.247 --> 00:58:56.668]  It looks like the Summer of Rage has claimed another victim.
[00:58:57.048 --> 00:58:58.608]  Report on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:58.949 --> 00:59:01.929]  Armenian gang stabs prominent Trump activist.
[00:59:01.949 --> 00:59:08.952]  27-year-old Tony Freeman was stabbed by a gang of Armenians who noticed his pro-Trump bumper sticker on his car after they rammed his vehicle.
[00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:13.273]  After the ramming, the gang members noticed his Gadsden flag and American flag bumper stickers.
[00:59:13.613 --> 00:59:15.575]  And proceeded to stab him nine times.
[00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:20.439]  Mr. Freeman was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he remains in critical condition.
[00:59:20.779 --> 00:59:24.162]  And you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund at WeSearcher.
[00:59:24.482 --> 00:59:34.171]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack as racially motivated, but we've seen the many statements from Tim Cain calling for fights in the streets, to Loretta Leitch calling for marching, blood, and death in the streets.
[00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:45.276]  Democratic leaders across the country, from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton to Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, are all calling for people to rise up and resist this summer, during the Summer of Rage.
[00:59:45.737 --> 00:59:46.857]  Who will be the next victim?
[00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:48.598]  Watch your back, or it may be you.
[00:59:49.158 --> 00:59:52.240]  Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:59:56.402 --> 01:00:02.285]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:23.513]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.192 --> 01:00:51.016]  Wow, it's crazy to see Sean Hannity on the same page with me about the fact that if they have big news sites and they go do these profile interviews, they should put out large chunks of them at least, not talk to Sean Hannity in March.
[01:00:51.296 --> 01:00:53.456]  I was wrong, it wasn't last year, it was this year a few months ago.
[01:00:53.796 --> 01:01:00.678]  Not talk to Sean Hannity in March, Ted Koppel for CBS, for 50 minutes, and then it's 70 seconds.
[01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.419]  Imagine 110 minutes.
[01:01:04.963 --> 01:01:19.609]  Was how long I sat down for the fifth interview or whatever it was with Megyn Kelly and then they have a 19 minute piece and I'm on there about two minutes and I know it's edited together garbage because I have the tapes.
[01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:21.770]  People say well then release the tapes.
[01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:24.971]  We're going to.
[01:01:26.071 --> 01:01:32.254]  But I have a limited crew and I'm going to make sure they're hard-hitting because we're going to show the clips from the show
[01:01:34.306 --> 01:01:38.208]  Where she edited me together, and then we're going to say, here's where she edited me together.
[01:01:38.648 --> 01:01:40.729]  Now here's from this point on the tape, unedited.
[01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.010]  Here's where she edited this together.
[01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:47.192]  It's from this point in the tape, and this point in the tape.
[01:01:47.932 --> 01:01:48.072]  Bloop!
[01:01:48.092 --> 01:01:49.553]  We're gonna show timelines.
[01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:50.593]  It's a lot of work.
[01:01:50.613 --> 01:01:51.874]  It's like a documentary.
[01:01:52.414 --> 01:01:53.855]  I'm not gonna just throw the tapes out.
[01:01:54.155 --> 01:01:58.116]  I've decided I am going to show you how they engage in this manipulation.
[01:01:58.136 --> 01:01:59.317]  Remember Katie Couric?
[01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.198]  Got sued.
[01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:12.352]  Because she had a, quote, focus group, a panel of gun owners, and she was asking them questions like, give me one example where guns do something good.
[01:02:12.372 --> 01:02:16.913]  And of course they all gave great answers, because they were sitting there taping it.
[01:02:17.494 --> 01:02:18.134]  They could prove that.
[01:02:18.514 --> 01:02:20.635]  But on the show, they cut to the woman going,
[01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:24.462]  Like she was watching paint dry, or daydreaming.
[01:02:24.642 --> 01:02:31.665]  They cut to the guy, he's like... And what they do is they aim cameras at you and say, we're just getting some room sound.
[01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:33.846]  Just sit there like you're doing nothing.
[01:02:34.346 --> 01:02:36.907]  Then they run the camera for a few minutes on each person.
[01:02:38.127 --> 01:02:40.688]  Now they got cutaway shots to make you look like buffoons.
[01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:46.450]  Gun rights group suing Katie Couric, others involved with under the gun documentary.
[01:02:48.171 --> 01:02:50.312]  Katie Couric responds, under the gun controversy.
[01:02:52.284 --> 01:02:55.806]  Now, you notice Hannity's taking the high road with a little lady, Megan, I know they're friends.
[01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:58.568]  She was saying nice things about him when she was here.
[01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:10.076]  And I'm sure it's true that she went to the interview and then they edited it, but definitely the kind of stuff that this gun rights group sued over has already happened here.
[01:03:10.937 --> 01:03:11.557]  Deception.
[01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:12.878]  Manipulation.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.081]  Misrepresentation.
[01:03:18.387 --> 01:03:30.690]  I mean, I've got her for 25-30 minutes going, oh, I'm obsessed with you, oh, it's not a hit piece, oh, I think you're a good guy, oh, I promise it's not a gotcha piece, I promise it's not a hit piece, and then it's the worst hit piece the earth has ever seen!
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:40.632]  With me all, with hot lamps all around me and, you know, lit from below and just incoherent garbage.
[01:03:41.112 --> 01:03:42.452]  I'm done talking about that for now.
[01:03:42.892 --> 01:03:46.173]  Later, I'm going to air the whole segment from Hannity because I think it's
[01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:51.851]  Something everybody should really be debating and discussing here, and that we should start demanding from the networks.
[01:03:51.891 --> 01:03:58.395]  Hey, you've got unlimited bandwidth, unlimited space, you'll get a lot of views, people want raw interviews, it's what they're after.
[01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:10.182]  Why would you not put out your edited 19-minute piece, and then after, so it doesn't compete with it, put out at least large chunks that's unedited?
[01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:14.244]  But they can't put out 2-minute chunks, 5-minute chunks, 10-minute chunks.
[01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:17.521]  Because it would be coherent!
[01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:23.007]  Instead, you watch that piece, it sounds like I'm a gibbering idiot.
[01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:24.748]  And I talked to Nico and others that were there.
[01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:25.888]  I was tired.
[01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.889]  I'd been interviewed off and on for 12 hours.
[01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.051]  And so there were a few times that I gibbered or stammered.
[01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:32.972]  But that was only a few times.
[01:04:33.232 --> 01:04:34.332]  It was taken out of context.
[01:04:34.573 --> 01:04:39.615]  And quite frankly, I'm so sick of Megyn Kelly and so sick of the Globalists, I didn't even have butterflies during it.
[01:04:40.095 --> 01:04:47.099]  I was just so sick of the same stupid, twisted questions and got you answers and just all the games they were playing.
[01:04:47.699 --> 01:04:52.986]  But again, regardless of how bad I did, and I'll say I didn't do too good.
[01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.008]  People are saying I'm a genius.
[01:04:54.068 --> 01:04:54.929]  No, I didn't do too good.
[01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:56.071]  It doesn't matter.
[01:04:56.271 --> 01:05:01.699]  People hate MSM so bad, and they're so sick of it, I've been raised up on people's shoulders.
[01:05:03.903 --> 01:05:06.304]  It looks like the Summer of Rage has claimed another victim.
[01:05:06.684 --> 01:05:08.245]  Report on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:08.585 --> 01:05:11.566]  Armenian gang stabs prominent Trump activist.
[01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:18.589]  27-year-old Tony Freeman was stabbed by a gang of Armenians who noticed his pro-Trump bumper sticker on his car after they rammed his vehicle.
[01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:22.911]  After the ramming, the gang members noticed his Gadsden flag and American flag bumper stickers.
[01:05:23.251 --> 01:05:25.213]  And proceeded to stab him nine times.
[01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:30.098]  Mr. Freeman was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he remains in critical condition.
[01:05:30.418 --> 01:05:33.802]  And you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund at WeSearcher.
[01:05:34.122 --> 01:05:43.812]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack as racially motivated, but we've seen the many statements from Tim Cain calling for fights in the streets, to Loretta Leitch calling for marching, blood, and death in the streets.
[01:05:44.412 --> 01:05:54.900]  Democratic leaders across the country, from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton to Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, are all calling for people to rise up and resist this summer, during the Summer of Rage.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.481]  Who will be the next victim?
[01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:58.202]  Watch your back, or it may be you.
[01:05:58.803 --> 01:06:01.845]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[01:08:17.137 --> 01:08:22.122]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.842 --> 01:08:50.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes, my good buddy, and of course, InfoWars.com contributor, Joe Biggs, former Army Sergeant, Patriot, is going to give us his take on leftist stabbings all over the United States and Europe.
[01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:56.674]  We have more stabbings, more truck attacks in England and in France today by the Loving Jihadis.
[01:08:57.615 --> 01:09:00.937]  And a friend of Joe Biggs got stabbed last night.
[01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:04.960]  They screamed, white boy gonna get shanked, because he had
[01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:13.401]  Well, there's a photo here of him in a Hillary for Prison shirt, and he had conservative stickers and Trump stickers on his car.
[01:09:13.421 --> 01:09:16.623]  We're going to be talking about that here in just a moment.
[01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:24.108]  And that ties in to Colonel Schaeffer warns of bloody civil war, societal collapse.
[01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:26.110]  That was last night.
[01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:31.533]  A month ago, he warned that the deep state is trying to overthrow Trump and trying to cause this civil war.
[01:09:32.054 --> 01:09:33.115]  And then that ties in
[01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:37.121]  To this entire stack of news.
[01:09:38.188 --> 01:09:39.248]  That I've got right here.
[01:09:39.388 --> 01:09:47.191]  Tucker takes on Democratic strategist who tweeted, hunt Republican congressman hashtag after the Scalise shooting.
[01:09:47.731 --> 01:09:51.612]  This is a high-level Democrat saying, let's go after more people.
[01:09:51.952 --> 01:09:59.214]  The Huffington Post writers made jokes about the man that died in North Korea, Otto Warmbier.
[01:09:59.774 --> 01:10:01.015]  They said, hey, he's white.
[01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:02.175]  He's privileged.
[01:10:02.195 --> 01:10:04.176]  I'm going to play that coming up in the hour.
[01:10:04.656 --> 01:10:05.356]  He's a frat boy.
[01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:11.673]  See, there's this weird alliance with any authoritarian regime, no matter how hellish it is, with these trendies.
[01:10:13.354 --> 01:10:20.918]  Continuing, Bernie Sanders urges supporters to act in an unprecedented way to stop Republicans by any means necessary.
[01:10:20.938 --> 01:10:24.199]  And of course you've seen his supporters out shooting and trying to kill people.
[01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:28.861]  UN report, number of global refugees, that means Muslim men, hits record high.
[01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:32.243]  More than 10 million people in 2016 traveling to the West.
[01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.844]  Knifeman drives at children at Kent
[01:10:35.725 --> 01:10:36.907]  Former military base.
[01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:41.938]  Armed police on the scene stop him as he screams Allah Akbar and tries to stab people.
[01:10:41.979 --> 01:10:45.967]  Report terrorist rams into police car in boxed attack in Paris.
[01:10:47.867 --> 01:10:48.367]  Same thing.
[01:10:48.847 --> 01:10:55.370]  First driver death in Calais after migrants dragged tree trunks onto the motorway.
[01:10:55.990 --> 01:11:01.472]  They routinely robbed the trucks on their way to the English Channel Tunnel and pulled the drivers out and robbed them.
[01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.433]  There's thousands of videos of that on YouTube.
[01:11:03.713 --> 01:11:05.213]  But this guy got killed.
[01:11:05.573 --> 01:11:06.834]  They're saying it's the first death.
[01:11:07.714 --> 01:11:09.295]  Infidels should have their throats cut.
[01:11:10.155 --> 01:11:13.156]  Italy arrests Iraqi refugees over ISIS support.
[01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:16.258]  Terror flags wave openly in the streets of London.
[01:11:16.618 --> 01:11:17.738]  That's CNS News.
[01:11:18.779 --> 01:11:23.060]  Murder of Muslim girl blamed on Trump was committed by an illegal immigrant.
[01:11:24.441 --> 01:11:25.641]  Think about how controlled the media is.
[01:11:25.701 --> 01:11:28.362]  A Paul Joseph Watson article on Infowars.com.
[01:11:28.663 --> 01:11:36.646]  An illegal alien kills a Muslim girl and then they say, look, it's a terror attack on Muslims.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.242]  Because of Trump's hate.
[01:11:40.123 --> 01:11:45.530]  But really, it's just another illegal alien killing somebody.
[01:11:46.372 --> 01:11:49.476]  Murder of Muslim girl blamed on Trump was committed by an illegal immigrant.
[01:11:49.896 --> 01:11:51.358]  President held responsible for death.
[01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:59.768]  His border policy may have prevented the murder of an American Muslim teen in Virginia that left his blame when Donald Trump was actually committed by an illegal immigrant.
[01:12:00.209 --> 01:12:04.133]  As soon as the fact of the story became known, that was suddenly lost all interest in the case.
[01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:04.793]  I wonder why.
[01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:10.579]  17-year-old Nabra Hasim was killed during an incident on Sunday when
[01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:22.378]  Darwin Martinez Torres drove up a curve towards a group of about 15 teens who were walking in Fairfax County after participating in an event at All Dulles Area Muslim Society.
[01:12:22.698 --> 01:12:29.303]  Torres became enraged after arguing with one of the teens on a bike before leaving his vehicle and chasing the group with a baseball bat.
[01:12:29.343 --> 01:12:36.167]  The suspect caught her and hit her with a bat before taking her body into an unknown location in Loudoun County.
[01:12:36.187 --> 01:12:38.369]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:12:39.932 --> 01:12:54.257]  And our only issue is there are a lot of mentally ill people, a lot of criminals that come in out of Latin America already fleeing justice, just like folks used to run in Latin America from justice here, and then they're above the law and can commit crimes over and over again, and the courts basically see them as above the law.
[01:12:54.597 --> 01:12:55.917]  Why is that the case?
[01:12:57.298 --> 01:13:03.720]  I'm not trying to just single out Muslims or anybody here, but the fact is the media continues to try to cover things up and spin things.
[01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.630]  And is openly trying to push us into a civil war.
[01:13:08.091 --> 01:13:12.956]  Here's a clip, again that I played last hour, of Colonel Schaefer warning about this on Fox News.
[01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:14.754]  This is the issue.
[01:13:14.834 --> 01:13:24.220]  If the governments who are responsible for our common welfare, common good, and defense are shown to be ineffective, people on the opposite side are going to rise up.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:34.307]  So what you see here is the automatic response, force on force, of certain folks coming back to essentially create, to retaliate.
[01:13:34.647 --> 01:13:36.608]  So again, the pathology is clear.
[01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:42.172]  If one side begins to act violently, you have inevitably the other side starting to come back.
[01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:43.012]  It always happens.
[01:13:44.093 --> 01:13:49.918]  We have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left, you'll see more violence on the right and retaliation.
[01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:50.499]  It's inevitable.
[01:13:50.619 --> 01:13:53.341]  Colonel, you fight in war zones.
[01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:55.863]  People are getting way too crazy about politics.
[01:13:56.244 --> 01:13:58.285]  These are a difference in philosophies.
[01:13:58.305 --> 01:14:02.589]  We shouldn't be shooting at each other and trying to stab each other, rushing in stages.
[01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:03.830]  It's out of control.
[01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:06.512]  Hopefully people, rational people, will dial it back.
[01:14:07.673 --> 01:14:11.577]  I didn't think I'd have to tap into your terrorism knowledge for these segments, but sadly we do.
[01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:16.659]  The president, for better or for worse, is the ultimate classification or declassification authority.
[01:14:16.859 --> 01:14:20.580]  He can talk to anybody about anything, no matter what the level is.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:29.363]  And beyond that, I understand that things were instantly twisted by the National Security Council staff and leaked, obviously, to the Post.
[01:14:29.963 --> 01:14:37.905]  And there was a very delayed, very muted response, where they should have been right up there, outlining the facts right up front about how this is completely false.
[01:14:38.245 --> 01:14:40.226]  So I think they, like you point out,
[01:14:41.067 --> 01:14:44.790]  The White House communications staff has to believe they are now at a state of war.
[01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.611]  This is war.
[01:14:45.951 --> 01:14:48.474]  It's called information operations, information warfare.
[01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:57.403]  And clearly, the other side, the deep state and the Clinton folks, and I have to say some folks on the Republican side, are all lining up.
[01:14:58.344 --> 01:14:59.585]  The battle lines are drawn.
[01:14:59.845 --> 01:15:03.529]  It's time for people to understand how to deal with this like it's a war.
[01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:09.013]  The deep state is committed to maintaining this assault, it seems.
[01:15:09.093 --> 01:15:19.782]  I mean, we're not even four months into the Trump presidency, and the assaults continue, the attacks continue, and we have, as you indicated, the outset.
[01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:24.945]  The New York Times and the Washington Post, these are no longer fake news.
[01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:28.786]  I mean, they are, it's an entire psyops.
[01:15:28.806 --> 01:15:34.829]  It is a disinformation campaign from previous, you know, former journalists.
[01:15:35.889 --> 01:15:42.252]  What do you think, having some experience with all of the above, would be an appropriate response by this White House?
[01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:43.173]  Well, two things.
[01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:45.655]  First, you're completely correct on the papers.
[01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:49.459]  I mean, they've become Pravda, just to use a Cold War metaphor.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.241]  It's shameful.
[01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:59.709]  Secondly, regarding the very fact, and look, I've met with senior intelligence officials now in place, and Lou, they have to go through and sort out
[01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:05.030]  Who is going to be actual career people who are going to do their job and those who are loyal to the previous administration.
[01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.971]  And some of these folks have transitioned from what we call political appointee jobs into career jobs.
[01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:16.952]  So you got to go through, so my recommendation, I'll tell you what I said, you need to go fire two people, two levels down.
[01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:19.572]  Everybody below you two levels, fire them.
[01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:20.492]  Be done with it.
[01:16:20.912 --> 01:16:22.293]  Thank you for your service to America.
[01:16:22.353 --> 01:16:29.594]  It's time for you to find a new job and then start looking for people who are going to be loyal to the American people and to the policies of this president.
[01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:31.731]  That's where we are.
[01:16:32.131 --> 01:16:33.452]  And the left isn't the left.
[01:16:33.512 --> 01:16:41.778]  It's a bunch of foreign bank funded crazies backing Bezos and everybody that are destroying the economy, battling Trump, trying to cut taxes for the average person.
[01:16:41.838 --> 01:16:48.283]  It makes me so mad to see ignorant mobs of people believing the propaganda, running around, stabbing, shooting and murdering.
[01:16:48.643 --> 01:16:50.065]  And it's not conservatives doing it.
[01:16:50.145 --> 01:16:51.926]  It's 99% of the time liberals.
[01:16:52.366 --> 01:16:59.432]  And then you heard Fox News earlier going, it's wrong for both sides to do this, shooting people and stabbing people and rushing on stages.
[01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:05.293]  So, we rush on stages and say, stop having murder-the-president rituals.
[01:17:06.374 --> 01:17:06.834]  In public.
[01:17:08.035 --> 01:17:08.375]  Okay?
[01:17:08.676 --> 01:17:09.596]  This isn't First Amendment.
[01:17:09.616 --> 01:17:10.977]  You're promoting it with taxpayer money.
[01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.979]  That's the same as shooting a congressman in cops?
[01:17:14.439 --> 01:17:16.981]  Joe Biggs joins us to break this down.
[01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:20.083]  One of his friends got stabbed last night out in California.
[01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.885]  We can show folks the article on InfoWars.com.
[01:17:22.925 --> 01:17:25.247]  Hear him with the gentleman that got
[01:17:26.297 --> 01:17:27.079]  Got stabbed.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.544]  This is a real, real travesty.
[01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:33.172]  Antonio Foreman, tell us about what happened, Joe.
[01:17:34.386 --> 01:17:39.408]  Yeah, he was at a free speech rally yesterday with Kyle Chapman, aka Bass Stickman.
[01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:43.769]  He's also Baked Alaska, Tim Treadstone's bodyguard.
[01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:53.092]  He goes to all these events across the country, to free speech events, to different events where Antifa and the left are trying to take down monuments of American history.
[01:17:53.572 --> 01:17:55.633]  So he's been to a lot of these events before.
[01:17:55.693 --> 01:17:57.293]  He's a well-profiled person.
[01:17:57.313 --> 01:17:58.854]  Looks like he was targeted is what you're saying?
[01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:00.175]  I believe so.
[01:18:00.235 --> 01:18:03.297]  I mean, I believe it was an Antifa attack or something.
[01:18:03.317 --> 01:18:05.059]  They probably said they were Armenians.
[01:18:05.079 --> 01:18:07.401]  They're probably Muslims, probably trying to escape the Armenians.
[01:18:08.277 --> 01:18:12.699]  Yeah, I just think it's interesting that they said that the car ran through a barrier and then ran into his car.
[01:18:12.999 --> 01:18:17.601]  Then they got out all nonchalantly and said, hey, you know, let's exchange information.
[01:18:17.701 --> 01:18:19.142]  And then all of a sudden they flipped out.
[01:18:19.182 --> 01:18:24.444]  I mean, who runs into a car through a barrier on accident and then all of a sudden it turns into a stabbing?
[01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:27.626]  I mean, the cops are saying it wasn't premeditated.
[01:18:27.646 --> 01:18:28.887]  Totally premeditated.
[01:18:29.327 --> 01:18:30.847]  They were gutting themselves up to do it.
[01:18:31.068 --> 01:18:32.568]  They were making sure there weren't any guns out.
[01:18:32.868 --> 01:18:33.669]  They were a bunch of cowards.
[01:18:34.449 --> 01:18:37.790]  And it's interesting what you're talking about earlier with that Muslim girl that was killed.
[01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:40.090]  There was a lady named Amy Siskind.
[01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.611]  She's a verified account on Twitter.
[01:18:41.631 --> 01:18:46.832]  I don't know what she does, but she goes, oh my God, this is what happens in Trump's America.
[01:18:47.192 --> 01:18:48.273]  I go, that's BS.
[01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:53.134]  I said, you have an agenda and you're ignoring the fact that she was killed by an illegal alien.
[01:18:53.494 --> 01:18:59.535]  If POTUS was allowed to do what he wanted to do with a travel ban and build a wall, this wouldn't have happened.
[01:18:59.615 --> 01:19:01.816]  I said, you're using this to spin your own agenda.
[01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:02.957]  We're good to go.
[01:19:17.558 --> 01:19:18.839]  You know what needs to happen?
[01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:19.980]  People need to start packing.
[01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:46.779]  And when somebody pulls a knife out or someone tries to kill them or attack them, people need to defend themselves and put these animals down.
[01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:48.841]  The left will say, that's me calling for terror.
[01:19:48.881 --> 01:19:50.903]  No, if somebody tries to kill you, defend yourself.
[01:19:50.943 --> 01:19:51.703]  That's America.
[01:19:51.904 --> 01:19:58.710]  We're not North Korea where you liberals go on vacation and just dream of how you could be in a death camp, torturing us to death and raping our families.
[01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:00.152]  We're going to fight you dirtbags.
[01:20:00.672 --> 01:20:01.253]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:06.644 --> 01:20:15.372]  Ladies and gentlemen, the jewel in the crown, the entire superstructure, the skeleton of world government, is this global carbon tax.
[01:20:16.613 --> 01:20:22.378]  And it's to be selectively enforced, just like General Electric got waivers and kept all its power plants open and saw their competition shut down.
[01:20:22.398 --> 01:20:25.681]  They made tens of billions and they gouged us on power prices.
[01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:31.206]  This is just one example of not building an economy based on competition, but an economy based on shutting down your competition.
[01:20:31.246 --> 01:20:32.027]  Look at Venezuela.
[01:20:32.387 --> 01:20:34.269]  Well, first of all, you're quite right.
[01:20:34.609 --> 01:20:41.355]  The links between totalitarianism in Europe and the establishment of the EU are entirely clear.
[01:20:41.976 --> 01:20:57.890]  Although the EU was originally founded as the European Coal and Steel Community to make sure there was enough supplies of coal and steel for the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, it then became transmogrified into an unelected tyranny by clerk, a dictatorship.
[01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:00.611]  Which can make laws.
[01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:03.972]  There is a European Parliament, but it can't even bring forward a bill.
[01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:05.553]  It's an extraordinary entity.
[01:21:05.853 --> 01:21:15.137]  And in any case, the unelected commissars, and I couldn't really name all that many of them, who run this from behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms.
[01:21:15.497 --> 01:21:19.239]  These commissars, who are just like the Politburo of the Soviet Union.
[01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:24.541]  So the constitution of the Soviet Union, when that collapsed, was picked up by the European Union.
[01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:27.442]  And so we now have this totalitarian constitution
[01:21:27.922 --> 01:21:33.409]  Where the unelected bureaucrats can overrule any decision of the elected European Parliament.
[01:21:33.449 --> 01:21:34.450]  What would you call it?
[01:21:34.511 --> 01:21:35.972]  A type of bureaucratic oligarchy?
[01:21:36.818 --> 01:21:38.219]  Well, this is exactly what it is.
[01:21:38.319 --> 01:21:39.920]  Tyranny by clerk is what I call it.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:48.306]  These are jumped up little nobodies who are dictating to the world because they couldn't get elected themselves.
[01:21:48.646 --> 01:21:55.310]  And so from the sidelines, they go into these great corporatist entities like the World Bank and the EU and the UN.
[01:21:55.731 --> 01:22:04.076]  And then increasingly, we are foolish enough to transfer powers like the powers in the Paris Treaty to these unelected bureaucrats.
[01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:06.678]  And then if we want to say, well, actually, you don't need those powers,
[01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:07.758]  That's why Mr. Obama, who
[01:22:34.887 --> 01:22:37.088]  He hated America with every fiber of his being.
[01:22:37.428 --> 01:22:40.188]  That's why he said he was going to have a war on coal.
[01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:55.272]  Not just because coal owners were the biggest contributors to his enemies, the Republican Party, but because he knew if he could destroy America's energy supply, increase the price and make America uncompetitive, that would be the end of the United States.
[01:22:55.672 --> 01:22:57.073]  That is the objective here.
[01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.834]  It's got nothing whatsoever to do with the climate.
[01:23:04.233 --> 01:23:05.655]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:23:53.443 --> 01:23:54.544]  That means it's clean.
[01:23:54.884 --> 01:23:55.825]  That means it's pure.

[01:23:58.907 --> 01:24:01.469]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:03.371]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:24:18.702 --> 01:24:19.683]  I want to be clear.
[01:24:21.997 --> 01:24:26.780]  I am not for offensive attacks on the left, on communists, on jihadis, on anybody.
[01:24:28.041 --> 01:24:37.688]  But if somebody walks up and says, get ready to be stabbed, white boy, get ready to be shanked, and pulls a knife out, you better have a concealed carry, you better draw, and you better defend yourself.
[01:24:38.688 --> 01:24:44.672]  Now, that's what they teach you, concealed carry class, you name it, but go get your own training, go get firearms training, don't be looking for trouble.
[01:24:44.792 --> 01:24:45.613]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:48.215]  I don't want the trouble of having to put somebody down.
[01:24:49.013 --> 01:24:55.057]  But, uh, you know, I've had leftists walk over to me in downtown Austin and say, you and Trump can go to hell and show me their gun.
[01:24:55.077 --> 01:24:56.759]  And I'm just like, are you kidding?
[01:24:57.239 --> 01:25:03.383]  And that time I was with four people who were all armed with concealed carries and we were all going to the shooting range.
[01:25:03.603 --> 01:25:08.147]  We walked out of a restaurant, he followed us out and we all turned like in a gunfighter movie.
[01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:10.610]  And we're just standing there.
[01:25:11.331 --> 01:25:12.852]  And I was with trained military people.
[01:25:12.992 --> 01:25:15.334]  And the guy kind of got sense and walked off.
[01:25:15.374 --> 01:25:18.037]  But that's where this country's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:18.057 --> 01:25:19.578]  These people are whacked out.
[01:25:20.379 --> 01:25:21.380]  So the question is...
[01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:27.965]  Do we run like they tell them to do in England if a Muslim is running over with a car or shooting you or stabbing you?
[01:25:27.985 --> 01:25:33.506]  Do you say, I'm sorry, I'm a European or I'm white or I'm Christian and just help them slit your throat?
[01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:37.008]  Or do you like line your kids up in the street for them to run them over?
[01:25:37.168 --> 01:25:40.169]  Or do you just bow down and worship?
[01:25:40.349 --> 01:25:44.170]  Or if a leftist wants to stab you, you say, I'm sorry, here's the heart.
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:48.314]  I mean, because that's how crazy all of this has gotten.
[01:25:48.334 --> 01:25:49.875]  So we're not even being sarcastic now.
[01:25:50.156 --> 01:25:57.244]  We've reached this point with a bunch of hyper-violent scum that want civil war funded by a bizarro Nazi collaborator.
[01:25:57.564 --> 01:25:58.725]  And we've got, here's the clip.
[01:25:59.815 --> 01:26:02.839]  Ernie Sanders, do whatever is necessary!
[01:26:03.059 --> 01:26:04.381]  Go to the next level!
[01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.523]  Do whatever you need to!
[01:26:06.783 --> 01:26:10.508]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[01:26:11.008 --> 01:26:17.036]  And even though my supporters just shot cops and other people and almost killed a congressman!
[01:26:17.596 --> 01:26:18.998]  Do whatever you want!
[01:26:19.238 --> 01:26:22.739]  Our job from coast to coast is to bring millions of people together.
[01:26:22.759 --> 01:26:26.241]  When I talk about a political revolution, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:26:40.663 --> 01:26:52.680]  Is for people all over this country to pressure on every level of government to say that in America, you know, we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.
[01:26:53.461 --> 01:26:56.145]  We are not gonna do horrendous things.
[01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:58.906]  The millions and millions of working people.
[01:26:58.926 --> 01:27:00.786]  We've got to stand up and fight back.
[01:27:01.086 --> 01:27:06.308]  We have got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before.
[01:27:06.648 --> 01:27:10.109]  Because what is happening now in Washington is unprecedented.
[01:27:10.409 --> 01:27:16.870]  This is the worst piece of legislation, the House bill, that I can recall in 25, 26 years.
[01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.491]  Yeah, he likes stuff like they had in Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba.
[01:27:20.091 --> 01:27:21.552]  Joe Biggs, where is all this going?
[01:27:21.572 --> 01:27:22.592]  I mean, how bad can this get?
[01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:27.644]  Well, here's the thing Americans have to realize is that most Americans are complacent.
[01:27:28.164 --> 01:27:30.685]  Most of our citizens have never been in combat situations.
[01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:37.888]  Most of them have never had to live day-to-day with a fear of possibly being shot, attacked, blown up, or anything like that.
[01:27:37.948 --> 01:27:44.491]  So, Americans have a different mindset and they need to break that mindset and they need to think offensively.
[01:27:44.511 --> 01:27:49.353]  It doesn't mean act or react offensively all the time, but it means to have that thought in the back of your head.
[01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:53.577]  If something does go wrong today, am I ready to deal with this?
[01:27:53.657 --> 01:28:06.329]  And when you're in combat, you constantly have to think about what could possibly happen and you have to run through different types of scenarios in your head as to how I'm going to react to defend myself and always look for different ways out.
[01:28:06.429 --> 01:28:08.451]  So, for instance, in a parking garage.
[01:28:08.931 --> 01:28:09.792]  Where are my exits?
[01:28:09.872 --> 01:28:10.812]  Where are my entrances?
[01:28:11.112 --> 01:28:12.093]  You know, was it well-lit?
[01:28:12.133 --> 01:28:13.554]  Am I parked in a well-lit area?
[01:28:13.594 --> 01:28:14.814]  Am I parked in a dark area?
[01:28:15.055 --> 01:28:16.135]  Am I being followed?
[01:28:16.355 --> 01:28:18.657]  You know, things like that you need to think about.
[01:28:18.677 --> 01:28:19.897]  Do I have a knife on me?
[01:28:19.977 --> 01:28:20.538]  Where is it?
[01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:32.845]  If I'm left-handed and I have a knife in my left pocket, I'm carrying groceries with my left hand, I've automatically taken seconds away from my action or my reaction time to be able to draw that to protect myself.
[01:28:33.165 --> 01:28:34.686]  So people need to break away from that.
[01:28:35.126 --> 01:28:35.266]  That's
[01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:59.793]  And now they've programmed some minorities to just attack whites because they're white, not even wearing Trump shirts, not even doing anything.
[01:28:59.853 --> 01:29:02.296]  In fact, some people wearing red hats are now being attacked.
[01:29:02.316 --> 01:29:02.956]  It's being reported.
[01:29:03.277 --> 01:29:08.742]  We have to, again, understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if we give in to this intimidation, the globalists are going to win.
[01:29:08.782 --> 01:29:12.826]  We've got to be more political now, be more out in the open now, and quite frankly,
[01:29:13.507 --> 01:29:25.416]  Everybody needs to conceal carry to defend ourselves to begin to send a message that when they attack, just like somebody robbing a liquor store or breaking into your house, when they attack, unfortunately, they're going to have to pay for their ignorance.
[01:29:26.598 --> 01:29:35.244]  Well, what people have to think about, too, is it really worth me going out to that bar and having those drinks in an area that I know that I'm hugely outnumbered politically in my sense.
[01:29:35.264 --> 01:29:40.268]  You know, if you go out and drink beers or you can drink alcohol and you go back and pull a gun, you're screwed.
[01:29:40.368 --> 01:29:42.169]  So there's a lot of things you have to think about.
[01:29:42.389 --> 01:29:42.769]  Exactly.
[01:29:42.789 --> 01:29:46.572]  The globalists want the left to segregate from libertarians, the right, Christians.
[01:29:46.992 --> 01:29:49.274]  Unfortunately, they live off our money anyways.
[01:29:49.654 --> 01:29:50.935]  It's time to ostracize them.
[01:29:50.975 --> 01:29:51.816]  It's time to shun them.
[01:29:52.642 --> 01:29:55.631]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.573 --> 01:29:59.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.221 --> 01:30:07.744]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:08.224 --> 01:30:14.269]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.489 --> 01:30:17.452]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:17.852 --> 01:30:20.854]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:21.055 --> 01:30:24.497]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.838 --> 01:30:26.599]  The left controls culture.
[01:30:26.619 --> 01:30:27.600]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:28.901]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:29.181 --> 01:30:32.644]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why
[01:30:33.024 --> 01:30:36.245]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.706]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:39.186 --> 01:30:42.988]  This triggers Southlakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:43.028 --> 01:30:48.410]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan.
[01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:51.111]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:51.371 --> 01:30:54.072]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[01:30:54.472 --> 01:30:57.618]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.698 --> 01:30:59.381]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:00.743]  It's available right now.
[01:31:01.043 --> 01:31:03.207]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:04.179 --> 01:31:06.820]  One thing I love to talk about is liberal hypocrisy.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.781]  Today I want to talk about Ben and Jerry's, the ice cream makers out of Vermont.
[01:31:09.861 --> 01:31:23.165]  At the end of last year, they wrote an open letter to President Trump where they talked about how they are strong advocates for racial, social justice, women, people of color, Muslims, migrants, refugees, the poor, and those who are further compromised by the policies and rhetoric you espouse during your campaign.
[01:31:23.385 --> 01:31:27.286]  Well, over the weekend, scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben and Jerry's.
[01:31:27.406 --> 01:31:27.706]  Why?
[01:31:27.806 --> 01:31:33.008]  Because the migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by the farms that provide milk to Ben and Jerry's.
[01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:45.240]  And these migrant farm workers, many of whom are illegal, started the Milk with Dignity program in 2014 with the Vermont group Migrant Justice to ensure farms provide migrant workers, some of which are illegal, fair wages, working conditions, and decent housing.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:49.804]  In 2015, Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program, but they're still stuck in negotiations.
[01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.726]  So will they join the Milk with Dignity program?
[01:31:51.966 --> 01:31:52.366]  Who knows?
[01:31:52.426 --> 01:31:56.769]  But right now, migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure they get their freebies.
[01:31:57.029 --> 01:32:00.652]  We don't know the outcome, but one thing I sure do love is this liberal hypocrisy.
[01:32:00.732 --> 01:32:03.534]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:32:05.489 --> 01:32:07.411]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:07.471 --> 01:32:08.532]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:09.713]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:10.013 --> 01:32:15.238]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:15.318 --> 01:32:28.891]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:28.951 --> 01:32:30.332]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:31.073 --> 01:32:32.675]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:32.735 --> 01:32:35.237]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:35.337 --> 01:32:36.599]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:36.639 --> 01:32:37.740]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:38.801]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:43.446]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:43.626 --> 01:32:46.789]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:46.889 --> 01:32:49.950]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:51.011]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:51.051 --> 01:32:52.931]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:54.012]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:54.032 --> 01:32:56.112]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:56.733 --> 01:32:59.754]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:00.014 --> 01:33:01.915]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:33:02.275 --> 01:33:04.275]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:08.597 --> 01:33:10.658]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:13.499]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:33:15.442 --> 01:33:18.845]  Laura Lermer is an amazing libertarian patriot activist.
[01:33:18.865 --> 01:33:20.226]  I've been familiar with her work for a while.
[01:33:20.727 --> 01:33:21.908]  And we finally got her on the show.
[01:33:22.108 --> 01:33:23.449]  She was on Hannity last night.
[01:33:24.150 --> 01:33:28.333]  And of course, speaking of Hannity last night, we're also going to debate the fact that Hannity said, listen, release the Alex Jones tapes.
[01:33:29.314 --> 01:33:30.636]  That's what NBC should be doing.
[01:33:31.316 --> 01:33:41.165]  In March, Ted Koppel interviewed him for 50 minutes and aired 70 seconds of what he had to say, edited so bad it was unintelligible.
[01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:45.163]  Now at least he didn't put a light underneath his chin like they did me.
[01:33:45.283 --> 01:33:47.405]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:33:47.525 --> 01:33:56.352]  And then they said Joe Biggs was a liar, and that we didn't catch drugs coming across the border, even though local news said it was clearly drugs, and the FBI asked to meet with Joe.
[01:33:57.509 --> 01:34:11.602]  I can talk about this now, and commended him, and he got intel from the FBI about an ISIS base that they weren't even allowed to go to, and Joe went there, and the FBI met him again, and then a year later Judicial Watch got the documents and confirmed it was all true.
[01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:12.863]  Of course it was true!
[01:34:12.903 --> 01:34:20.550]  The FBI contacted us because Joe, they thought, was crazy enough, they said, brave enough to go in there as a journalist.
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.591]  They wanted video of it.
[01:34:23.066 --> 01:34:24.987]  They were followed the whole... We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:34:25.207 --> 01:34:29.930]  But that just shows how this lady that reads off a teleprompter is pointing her finger at Joe Biggs.
[01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:37.994]  A veteran of all combat wars, patriot, great job at InfoWars, contributed to InfoWars, and then he's a liar.
[01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:39.635]  Everything on her piece is a lie.
[01:34:39.675 --> 01:34:40.676]  So I'm sick of her piece.
[01:34:41.056 --> 01:34:43.797]  Worst ratings in the history of Dateline NBC.
[01:34:44.257 --> 01:34:45.178]  But that's the story.
[01:34:45.258 --> 01:34:46.799]  People have rejected it.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.885]  Laura Lohmer joins us, and of course you can find out more about her on several websites.
[01:34:53.905 --> 01:34:57.508]  I'm going to ask her the best place for people to go, because she's involved with a lot of different sites.
[01:34:57.788 --> 01:35:02.813]  Therebel.media, and of course she's worked with a lot of other great organizations as well.
[01:35:03.033 --> 01:35:11.981]  She ran up on the stage at Shakespeare in the Park, where they're openly got the Trump character with the American flags, with the Eastern European Melania wife.
[01:35:12.912 --> 01:35:14.893]  They're admitting it's a simulated murder of Trump.
[01:35:14.913 --> 01:35:16.374]  They're promoting his murder everywhere.
[01:35:16.554 --> 01:35:18.775]  Then the media tried to say, oh, it's not really Trump.
[01:35:18.815 --> 01:35:19.696]  She's just crazy.
[01:35:19.936 --> 01:35:25.299]  It's a 500-year-old play from the most famous playwright ever, William Shakespeare.
[01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:28.081]  This is the deception in the games they play.
[01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:31.963]  You can follow her at freelora.com.
[01:35:32.744 --> 01:35:37.707]  And again, she joins us right now with Joe Biggs to break this down.
[01:35:38.547 --> 01:35:39.408]  And then, of course, we have
[01:35:40.288 --> 01:35:43.537]  The host of Fox and Friends saying that you were wrong.
[01:35:43.577 --> 01:35:46.405]  And I'm going to start a fight with Fox News that you were wrong.
[01:35:47.591 --> 01:35:51.012]  Kill Meade and others are saying that you were wrong to rush the stage.
[01:35:51.352 --> 01:35:54.012]  He says we don't want shootings and stabbings and rushing the stage.
[01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:56.973]  Shootings and stabbings isn't rushing the stage.
[01:35:57.353 --> 01:36:01.573]  We're being peaceful saying don't promote violence, standing up with free speech.
[01:36:02.454 --> 01:36:05.014]  They're the ones that take over events and don't let people speak.
[01:36:05.254 --> 01:36:09.435]  You just took over for two minutes and pointed out that they were simulating the murder of the president.
[01:36:09.875 --> 01:36:15.376]  There's this big national debate with conservatives over whether this is right or not and whether we should adopt the tactics of the left.
[01:36:15.876 --> 01:36:17.037]  Those aren't tactics of the left.
[01:36:17.257 --> 01:36:20.280]  Those are tactics of survival and taking action.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:28.288]  And the globalists should know the libertarian right-wing patriot movement is about to get a lot more aggressive because we're trying to head off a civil war.
[01:36:28.548 --> 01:36:29.549]  Laura Lerner, what do you say?
[01:36:30.694 --> 01:36:33.335]  Well, those are constitutional rights as well, Alex, right?
[01:36:33.415 --> 01:36:47.081]  So we have a right to free speech, a right to protest, and as long as it's peaceful and not violent like the left, you know, I can, I have a right to get up on that stage and protest against the assassination of our president and incitement of violence against the right.
[01:36:48.462 --> 01:36:48.902]  That's right.
[01:36:48.942 --> 01:36:51.803]  I mean, they're openly simulating murder, saying kill everybody.
[01:36:52.143 --> 01:36:52.844]  It's happening.
[01:36:52.884 --> 01:36:54.064]  They're calling for civil war.
[01:36:54.324 --> 01:36:55.885]  Top Democrats are calling for civil war.
[01:36:57.469 --> 01:37:02.267]  In fact, are we doing enough to aggressively, with information, get in these bullies' faces?
[01:37:03.208 --> 01:37:04.309]  No, we're definitely not.
[01:37:04.489 --> 01:37:10.091]  And, you know, I face a lot of criticism from people in the conservative movement for using what they're calling a leftist tactic.
[01:37:10.451 --> 01:37:15.874]  But if you look at Saul Alinsky, for example, you know, promoter of leftist tactics, that's what we need to do.
[01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:18.135]  We need to adopt Alinsky tactics.
[01:37:18.235 --> 01:37:23.497]  And like he said, Alinsky rule number four, use the opposition's playbook against them.
[01:37:23.577 --> 01:37:27.219]  If we're going to win this war, which is a culture war, we need to start
[01:37:27.979 --> 01:37:34.043]  You know, giving them a taste of their own medicine and showing the hypocrisy of their tactics by using their tactics against them.
[01:37:34.404 --> 01:37:35.384]  Because what was I doing?
[01:37:35.685 --> 01:37:38.046]  I got up on that stage and I protested their event.
[01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:45.832]  How many times have we seen lefty protesters interrupt and shut down conservative events but then when I do it, it's not okay?
[01:37:47.682 --> 01:37:47.862]  Well,
[01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:16.557]  The actual, like she said last night, you know, this violent porn, this assassination porn that we're seeing, the fact that people are promoting it as okay.
[01:38:16.577 --> 01:38:21.800]  Then we see Kathy Griffin hold a bloodied, beheaded version of Donald Trump and his son sees that.
[01:38:22.101 --> 01:38:23.802]  It's completely traumatized by that.
[01:38:24.242 --> 01:38:25.803]  It's making it okay for that.
[01:38:25.923 --> 01:38:33.048]  It is empowering people like this guy who went to the baseball game and purposely picked out Republicans to shoot.
[01:38:33.328 --> 01:38:34.869]  This guy had a kill list.
[01:38:35.249 --> 01:38:43.290]  There's so much fear-mongering coming from the left that people are buying into it so much that they are willing to go out, stab, and shoot at people.
[01:38:44.191 --> 01:38:54.032]  Right, and one thing that I mentioned, too, was that people were being encouraged by Kathy Griffin and also this play, Julius Caesar, in which the president gets stabbed on stage.
[01:38:54.472 --> 01:39:04.174]  And just one day after I warned against liberals stabbing conservatives and stabbing our president, a conservative pro-Trump
[01:39:05.094 --> 01:39:09.980]  Supporter Tony Foreman was stabbed and now he's in the hospital because liberals stabbed him, right?
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:14.906]  And Antifa recently just published a new poster that said, we've beat them before, we'll beat them again.
[01:39:14.926 --> 01:39:23.136]  And it shows, you know, a knife being jabbed inside somebody wearing a Pepe logo and a swastika on their hat.
[01:39:23.396 --> 01:39:24.557]  So they're calling us Nazis.
[01:39:24.597 --> 01:39:26.559]  They're using imagery from Julius Caesar.
[01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:30.082]  The knives, you know, leftists armed with knives.
[01:39:30.142 --> 01:39:36.727]  If you saw the picture of me on stage, I interrupted it during the assassination scene because I wanted to stop the scene.
[01:39:36.747 --> 01:39:39.670]  And let's be clear, the minorities are not the people pushing this.
[01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:41.651]  And I'm not just saying that to virtue signal.
[01:39:41.711 --> 01:39:42.152]  It's true.
[01:39:42.712 --> 01:39:50.319]  It's mainly white liberals, big money, George Soros's, the Clinton Foundation, openly funding all these TV shows and movies.
[01:39:51.359 --> 01:39:58.926]  Where Trump's racist and I'm racist, and then Tom Brokaw says I'm racist, and then Hillary Clinton says I'm racist with no proof.
[01:39:58.946 --> 01:39:59.867]  They don't ever show it.
[01:40:00.588 --> 01:40:05.793]  And then they have Tom Brokaw back on the news Sunday night saying it.
[01:40:05.853 --> 01:40:06.433]  It's crazy.
[01:40:06.674 --> 01:40:15.402]  And now all over Austin they've got images of women with machine guns shooting conservatives that the Communist Red Brigade have put out, you know, saying, you know, stand up.
[01:40:16.062 --> 01:40:22.845]  You know, shoot back and all this other stuff as if we're out there shooting and killing them and as if we are the Nazis.
[01:40:22.865 --> 01:40:29.867]  This is just totally insane, but they're whipping themselves up into this frenzy wanting violence.
[01:40:30.167 --> 01:40:31.688]  Laura Loomer, where do you see this going?
[01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:40.786]  I think it's only going to get worse unless our politicians and members of the liberal mainstream media start to condemn political violence.
[01:40:41.166 --> 01:40:44.768]  So Julius Caesar was funded by the New York Times and CNN.
[01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:50.851]  How many members of the public watch CNN and read the New York Times, right?
[01:40:51.192 --> 01:41:01.157]  If so many people in our country are influenced by this liberal ideology and these liberal media outlets are paying to incite violence, it's not going to change unless they publicly condemn
[01:41:02.338 --> 01:41:14.503]  You know, the alignment with ISIS, the alignment with Islam, this continuation of political violence, and so it's really up to us, conservatives, to lead the fight.
[01:41:15.123 --> 01:41:16.144]  I see it getting worse, though.
[01:41:16.664 --> 01:41:25.367]  Well, it's interesting because people are saying that these plays, these images that Kathy Griffin put out, aren't really empowering people to go out and do stuff, and that's complete and total BS.
[01:41:26.028 --> 01:41:28.269]  When Tony was stabbed yesterday, nine times,
[01:41:29.429 --> 01:41:34.431]  Um, Baked Alaska tweeted out at first and then he called me up and we talked about what was going on.
[01:41:35.011 --> 01:41:36.632]  Um, I was looking at the responses.
[01:41:36.672 --> 01:41:39.293]  People were like, oh, they should have stabbed him more so he would have died.
[01:41:39.813 --> 01:41:42.234]  You know, this cracker deserves to be killed.
[01:41:42.494 --> 01:41:49.237]  And these are the responses you're seeing from the left day in and day out without zero remorse for human life or anything at all.
[01:41:49.257 --> 01:41:49.937]  They don't care.
[01:41:50.377 --> 01:41:51.618]  They want us to die.
[01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:54.379]  There is a war going on and people have to understand.
[01:41:55.559 --> 01:42:01.424]  To get out of that complacency mindset, to change how you think and understand that our world is changing around us.
[01:42:01.664 --> 01:42:02.604]  We have to be ready.
[01:42:02.624 --> 01:42:07.088]  It doesn't mean to act first, but if the time does come to react, to be ready and to do it right.
[01:42:07.108 --> 01:42:07.488]  Well, that's right.
[01:42:07.528 --> 01:42:08.629]  I mean, take Brian Kilmeade.
[01:42:08.649 --> 01:42:10.670]  I'm not trying to bash him, but he's there.
[01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:23.158]  Last night, and he's interviewing Colonel Schaefer, and I guess this morning, and he then again says, well, they're shooting, they're stabbing, they're rushing on stages, everyone needs to stop.
[01:42:23.258 --> 01:42:27.181]  No, the left is shooting and stabbing and running people over with cars.
[01:42:28.101 --> 01:42:32.246]  But at a certain point, conservatives are going to start responding back, which I don't want.
[01:42:32.567 --> 01:42:37.273]  A bunch of dead, mindless liberals that we were unable to deprogram, I want to break their conditioning.
[01:42:37.493 --> 01:42:38.454]  They're not real liberals.
[01:42:38.555 --> 01:42:39.856]  I don't see myself as a conservative.
[01:42:40.177 --> 01:42:42.900]  I see myself as a classical liberal, Thomas Jefferson style.
[01:42:43.321 --> 01:42:45.483]  More taxes, more freedom, more mobility.
[01:42:45.964 --> 01:42:46.765]  That's their goal though.
[01:42:46.785 --> 01:42:50.769]  Their goal is to push a conservative to a breaking point where he reacts instead of thinking first.
[01:43:05.243 --> 01:43:06.825]  And does something so they can go see?
[01:43:07.145 --> 01:43:09.668]  I mean, look at the attacks that have happened in Europe over the last few days.
[01:43:09.688 --> 01:43:18.158]  You've got one guy who drives a van into a crowd of people, kills one person, I believe it was, at the end of the day, and it's like, oh my god, terrorism in London!
[01:43:18.438 --> 01:43:19.940]  Terrorism, terrorism!
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:26.327]  And it's like, everyone's... I'm gonna say, this is the right-wingers, it's your fault, you all need to be banned, it's all the Christians' fault, and then meanwhile...
[01:43:26.807 --> 01:43:33.230]  But whenever a Muslim blows up 22 girls and kills them, oh it's not a Muslim, we all need to be peaceful and just give in and go along with it.
[01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:34.891]  Let me ask Laura Loomer this question.
[01:43:35.191 --> 01:43:43.614]  Why, because you're a woman, and you're there in New York City, why do you think the left, and feminists particularly, are so in love with radical Islam?
[01:43:43.654 --> 01:43:45.295]  Is this a form of cuckolding?
[01:43:45.695 --> 01:43:48.156]  Is this a form of masochism?
[01:43:48.216 --> 01:43:49.857]  Is this a form of Stockholm Syndrome?
[01:43:51.498 --> 01:43:51.999]  I don't know.
[01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:58.447]  I mean, I'm definitely not a feminist and I've been very outspoken against the alignment of the feminist movement with Islam.
[01:43:59.188 --> 01:44:02.792]  I think that anyone who calls themselves a feminist really has a suicide wish.
[01:44:03.172 --> 01:44:04.634]  I think they have a suicide gene.
[01:44:05.475 --> 01:44:11.362]  I think that the left, you know, they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:44:12.202 --> 01:44:15.984]  It's a case of mental illness, this extreme sense of liberalism.
[01:44:16.004 --> 01:44:19.766]  It really is borderline mental illness.
[01:44:19.966 --> 01:44:20.706]  It's a jihad.
[01:44:20.786 --> 01:44:22.067]  It's a death wish.
[01:44:22.107 --> 01:44:22.887]  It's a war wish.
[01:44:23.147 --> 01:44:26.268]  They want a rite of passage.
[01:44:26.288 --> 01:44:30.210]  They dream about a red terror overthrow and how they're going to murder everybody.
[01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:34.692]  There's suddenly red brigades just marching all over Austin, attacking people, attacking
[01:44:34.912 --> 01:44:35.152]  That's
[01:44:51.901 --> 01:45:12.880]  Brainwashed by the media and yeah, I can't explain it any other way than just the mental illness really I've been saying this for a long time that liberals have a suicide gene and there's a reason behind it because they're so obsessed with this social justice warrior mentality that they're they want to go help minorities and they feel empowered by it they they feel so good by it well the thing is is radical Islam is
[01:45:13.697 --> 01:45:14.077]  That's right.
[01:45:32.788 --> 01:45:35.529]  And are able to start voting and making real changes.
[01:45:35.569 --> 01:45:40.711]  If you look at the amount of, you know, whites in the world, they're not, you know, having babies.
[01:45:40.991 --> 01:45:45.353]  But if you look at the amount of Muslims in the world, they're having way more babies right now than anybody else.
[01:45:45.613 --> 01:45:48.274]  There's a good chance that we're going to be the minority at some point in time.
[01:45:48.534 --> 01:45:54.276]  They want to come into the country, they want to overpopulate, and they want to have their ability to outvote us.
[01:45:54.757 --> 01:45:58.278]  And the next thing you know, you've got Sharia law and the liberals are going to be the first ones to go down.
[01:46:00.413 --> 01:46:03.577]  I want to ask both of you where you think this is going.
[01:46:04.485 --> 01:46:08.808]  At the end of the day, I don't think it's the Islamicists that I'm even worried about in the final summation.
[01:46:09.748 --> 01:46:21.055]  It's that the globalists are bringing them in, have this master plan, are so anti-Christian, are so anti-West, and just foaming at the mouth, and the universities are literally falling apart, they're giving people nearly worthless degrees.
[01:46:21.455 --> 01:46:28.880]  I see civilization going into the mud, all because a bunch of billionaires wanted to make the public more manageable, so they dumbed us down and divided and conquered us.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.201]  But since I mentioned Kilmeade,
[01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:44.229]  Here he is trying to equate conservatives' incredible restraint, Americans' incredible restraint, saint-like stoic restraint, with us being involved in the reign of liberal violence and terror sweeping the globe.
[01:46:44.269 --> 01:46:44.629]  Here it is.
[01:46:46.463 --> 01:46:55.869]  If the governments who are responsible for our common welfare, common good, and defense are shown to be ineffective, people on the opposite side are going to rise up.
[01:46:56.289 --> 01:47:05.935]  So what you see here is the automatic response, force on force, of certain folks coming back to essentially create, to retaliate.
[01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:08.236]  So again, the pathology is clear.
[01:47:08.856 --> 01:47:13.799]  If one side begins to act violently, you have inevitably the other side starting to come back.
[01:47:13.879 --> 01:47:14.660]  It always happens.
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:21.544]  So we have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left, you'll see more violence on the right and retaliation.
[01:47:21.604 --> 01:47:22.125]  It's inevitable.
[01:47:22.265 --> 01:47:24.967]  Colonel, you fight in war zones.
[01:47:25.267 --> 01:47:27.508]  People are getting way too crazy about politics.
[01:47:27.869 --> 01:47:29.630]  These are a difference in philosophy.
[01:47:29.650 --> 01:47:34.233]  You shouldn't be shooting at each other and trying to stab each other, rushing in stages.
[01:47:34.593 --> 01:47:35.454]  It's out of control.
[01:47:35.554 --> 01:47:38.155]  Hopefully people, rational people, will dial it back.
[01:47:38.736 --> 01:47:38.976]  Hopefully.
[01:47:39.316 --> 01:47:43.039]  I didn't think I'd have to tap into your terrorism knowledge for these segments, but sadly we do.
[01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:48.989]  So, Colonel Schaffer's warning we're going into a civil war.
[01:47:49.089 --> 01:47:50.410]  The deep state wants to overthrow Trump.
[01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:51.211]  This isn't a game.
[01:47:52.252 --> 01:47:54.734]  I look at the fools that hate the economy being turned back on.
[01:47:55.014 --> 01:47:56.455]  They're racing to kill the economy.
[01:47:56.895 --> 01:47:59.377]  A lot of smart economists think that Trump tried to save it.
[01:47:59.478 --> 01:48:00.578]  They thought he could have saved it.
[01:48:01.039 --> 01:48:04.782]  Right now they're saying signs are they are blocking him cutting taxes.
[01:48:04.842 --> 01:48:07.604]  If that doesn't happen, they think everything else is going to fail.
[01:48:07.905 --> 01:48:08.745]  Too little, too late.
[01:48:08.845 --> 01:48:10.207]  Ron Paul and many others say that.
[01:48:10.767 --> 01:48:11.708]  What's going to happen
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:31.385]  If the recovery fails, we plunge into a serious depression, and the left's trying to impeach or kill the president, I don't see how a civil war doesn't break out, and then it just comes down to our states and our police and our citizens to come together and not give in to this intimidation and this terror.
[01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:32.866]  What do you see happening?
[01:48:34.724 --> 01:48:36.144]  Well, I mean, I know a lot of police.
[01:48:36.744 --> 01:48:40.765]  I'm really good friends with, especially after the RNC trip, the whole Cleveland Police Department.
[01:48:40.785 --> 01:48:43.006]  I mean, these guys are sending me baby gifts and stuff.
[01:48:43.046 --> 01:48:55.209]  I mean, the police that I talk to around the country, even in Austin and stuff like that, most of them are aligned with us in how we think, the conservative ideas, more states' rights, more power to the people, not being revenue generators.
[01:48:55.849 --> 01:49:02.552]  I go to gun shows all over the country and I talk to retired sheriffs that hate their jobs just giving out tickets to do that.
[01:49:02.592 --> 01:49:10.216]  So you actually have real police, you have real people out there within the government that want to do the right thing.
[01:49:10.276 --> 01:49:18.160]  So if it does go into a civil war and we spiral out of control, I think we're going to have a lot of good people on our side, a lot more than what a lot of people are thinking right now.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:25.143]  And we have a lot of good people out there that know how to use their guns, that know how to actually go out and get food, who actually know how to live off the land.
[01:49:25.963 --> 01:49:30.164]  Who just don't sit around in their mom's basement eating Cheetos all day playing video games.
[01:49:30.424 --> 01:49:36.766]  You know the worst thing that could happen for the left is for something like that to happen because the people on the right are the ones that are outdoorsmen.
[01:49:36.966 --> 01:49:39.447]  We're the ones that go fishing and hunting and live off the land.
[01:49:39.927 --> 01:49:46.149]  For them it would be the worst thing in the world but for some reason they want it and it goes back to that whole thing that the left has a suicide gene.
[01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:47.009]  It just makes no sense.
[01:49:48.803 --> 01:49:50.344]  Yeah, I agree with Joe.
[01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:56.087]  One thing that you just said, Alex, you said if the left is trying to kill our president and assassinate him.
[01:49:56.107 --> 01:49:56.668]  They already are.
[01:49:56.688 --> 01:49:57.688]  It's not a question of if.
[01:49:57.748 --> 01:50:00.130]  They already are actively plotting to assassinate.
[01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:01.951]  Exactly.
[01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:10.256]  So there have been over 12,000 threats to assassinate President Trump on Twitter since he's been elected president.
[01:50:10.316 --> 01:50:14.018]  I don't think I've ever seen that many active threats against a president's life ever in
[01:50:14.138 --> 01:50:15.939]  Well, what about newspaper editors?
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:20.063]  Every major newspaper I've seen has had writers saying, kill him, you know, I'll buy the bullets.
[01:50:20.263 --> 01:50:21.504]  I mean, how are they going to feel?
[01:50:22.645 --> 01:50:24.947]  You have James, James Devine, I think his name is.
[01:50:24.987 --> 01:50:27.609]  He said, hashtag hunt Republican congressman.
[01:50:27.869 --> 01:50:28.469]  He tweeted this.
[01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:31.872]  He's a Democratic strategist, a paid Democratic.
[01:50:31.892 --> 01:50:34.434]  He went on Tucker Carlson last night and defended it.
[01:50:35.075 --> 01:50:35.315]  Yeah.
[01:50:35.615 --> 01:50:36.916]  So he's hunting.
[01:50:37.036 --> 01:50:40.559]  I mean, Joe just talked about hunting, like Republicans being outdoorsmen.
[01:50:40.839 --> 01:50:42.321]  And now the left is using their,
[01:50:44.213 --> 01:50:48.656]  Let's come back and talk about that because you know you saw the day the congressman got shot last week.
[01:50:49.117 --> 01:50:55.201]  Well Blitzer had a guest on saying this guy's not evil he's just tired of stuff you know he took political action and Blitzer was like nodding his head.
[01:50:55.561 --> 01:51:01.865]  What happens then if people that we're trying to stop start going out and just saying hey it's just political I'm gonna blow your head off.
[01:51:07.136 --> 01:51:11.198]  Democracy Partners attacks Veritas launches $1 million federal lawsuit.
[01:51:11.318 --> 01:51:13.379]  And so that's where all of this is going.
[01:51:13.399 --> 01:51:14.159]  And he joins us.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.300]  Remember the clips.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.241]  Talk about game changer in the election.
[01:51:17.401 --> 01:51:20.002]  It's not true that I or you defeated Hillary.
[01:51:20.102 --> 01:51:21.643]  She's blamed 20 different groups.
[01:51:22.343 --> 01:51:27.846]  Veritas, Drudge, Infowars, the Russians, misogyny, racism.
[01:51:28.466 --> 01:51:31.228]  Never the fact that people are sick of her and her policies.
[01:51:32.468 --> 01:51:34.029]  So James O'Keefe, thanks for joining us.
[01:51:34.838 --> 01:51:35.899]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:51:35.959 --> 01:51:38.440]  I think reality defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.661]  You know, the truth defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:51:40.741 --> 01:51:51.186]  And now, just yesterday, it was announced a lawsuit, a million-dollar lawsuit, against my team, Veritas, from this guy Bob Kramer, who's one of Barack Obama's close friends.
[01:51:51.987 --> 01:51:53.527]  We're basically retaliating, you know.
[01:51:53.547 --> 01:51:55.668]  We re-exposed the fraud during the election.
[01:51:55.688 --> 01:52:02.532]  We re-exposed the four-part series, sending shockwaves to the DNC about voter fraud, use of dark money.
[01:52:03.283 --> 01:52:06.785]  I'm an overseas donor to arrange these types of things.
[01:52:06.825 --> 01:52:09.706]  So they sued me for a million dollars and they want to shut us down.
[01:52:09.726 --> 01:52:11.287]  And then I get calls from Politico.
[01:52:11.307 --> 01:52:15.989]  I get calls from all these mainstream outlets that suddenly want to talk to me now that I'm being sued.
[01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:18.670]  And I want to know who's pointing this lawsuit.
[01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:21.452]  I said that over my dead body will I ever shut up.
[01:52:21.512 --> 01:52:28.615]  Bob Kramer, Barack Obama's friend and the person Hillary Clinton had to fire, is now suing me for a million dollars for the videos that we did during the election.
[01:52:28.755 --> 01:52:37.371]  To me, this is about just silencing you, but more importantly, intimidating other people that, oh look, we'll sue you if you do more stuff like James O'Keefe did.
[01:52:38.482 --> 01:52:42.244]  Yeah, I mean, I think investigative journalism itself is on the line.
[01:52:42.464 --> 01:52:50.168]  I mean, a lot of media companies don't have the brass balls it takes to go out and speak the truth to power.
[01:52:50.208 --> 01:53:02.174]  I said on your show before that a lot of these journalists, a lot of these media organizations can't do the job because they're worried about the government regulators coming after them, let's say if Hillary was elected.
[01:53:02.814 --> 01:53:15.129]  And we went out on a limb and did it, and they're trying to deter us and establishment news organizations from speaking truth to power against the establishment, because this is what happens to you when you do so.
[01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:16.771]  You get sued for a million dollars.
[01:53:16.831 --> 01:53:19.214]  This is a press stunt, Kramer is pulling.
[01:53:19.234 --> 01:53:19.915]  A million dollars?
[01:53:19.935 --> 01:53:21.137]  What does that even mean, a million dollars?
[01:53:21.417 --> 01:53:25.539]  And by the way, Alex, we live in a media environment where people can use anonymous sources.
[01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:30.942]  Every small claim that we make is buttressed by videotape of them saying what they said.
[01:53:31.242 --> 01:53:33.323]  And yet, you're not supposed to believe us.
[01:53:33.343 --> 01:53:37.886]  You're supposed to believe all these journalists who use anonymous sources, quoting hearsay from other anonymous sources.
[01:53:40.316 --> 01:53:44.658]  You actually show us tape or your notebooks of what these sources are saying.
[01:53:44.998 --> 01:53:47.299]  We don't believe you because you have no credibility.
[01:53:47.359 --> 01:53:51.021]  Every prediction, everything you said during the election was proved to be wrong.
[01:53:51.501 --> 01:53:52.802]  But this is the game we play.
[01:53:53.182 --> 01:53:56.084]  Andrew Breitbart always told me we have to be held to a higher standard.
[01:53:56.504 --> 01:53:58.425]  But in any event, that's what Kramer did.
[01:53:58.785 --> 01:53:59.665]  That's what we're facing.
[01:54:00.025 --> 01:54:00.766]  And we're going to fight it.
[01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:06.650]  Alright, final segment with Joe Biggs.
[01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:08.651]  Laura Loomer will do five more minutes with us in the next hour.
[01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:11.032]  Then I'm opening the phones up in the third hour.
[01:54:11.072 --> 01:54:14.013]  Then Paul Watson will host the fourth hour from London, England.
[01:54:14.073 --> 01:54:14.793]  Always powerful.
[01:54:14.813 --> 01:54:22.916]  I haven't really gotten into North Korea, the liberal wonderland, and how the left was saying they basically hoped he would die.
[01:54:23.376 --> 01:54:27.057]  Well, Otto Warmbier did die.
[01:54:27.077 --> 01:54:30.178]  That's all coming up as well in the next hour.
[01:54:31.536 --> 01:54:42.424]  Briefly, before we go back to Laura Loomer who has so much courage to actually go up on a stage in front of people and speak the truth to a bunch of crazed death cult worshippers.
[01:54:43.245 --> 01:54:47.028]  They're having a simulated murder porn orgy.
[01:54:48.683 --> 01:54:49.824]  So say what you want about her.
[01:54:50.045 --> 01:54:53.008]  She has got guts and I salute her and I thank her.
[01:54:53.048 --> 01:54:55.291]  And they said she was a paid activist when she wasn't.
[01:54:56.072 --> 01:55:08.027]  So I'm going to send her, I think I said a couple thousand bucks, I need to get her contact information because we have our $200,000 contest going exposing CNN as ISIS, exposing mainstream media as terrorist.
[01:55:08.567 --> 01:55:17.096]  If you can get InfoWars.com in, that's fine, but even though she really wasn't part of the contest, I want to take liberal lies and with alchemy, make them true.
[01:55:17.436 --> 01:55:20.059]  She wasn't a paid activist, but now she is.
[01:55:20.339 --> 01:55:21.460]  She deserves awards.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:24.443]  She deserves to be put on a pedestal for her guts.
[01:55:24.783 --> 01:55:25.704]  No guts, no glory.
[01:55:25.904 --> 01:55:28.967]  We'll get final comments from Joe Biggs and then from her here in a moment.
[01:55:29.688 --> 01:55:37.652]  Briefly, help fund our $200,000 contest by getting the image of Kathy Griffin and Trump's head chopped off saying CNN terrorist.
[01:55:38.052 --> 01:55:41.174]  There's other variants as well that says fake news.
[01:55:42.014 --> 01:55:44.276]  There's other t-shirts that we sell as well.
[01:55:44.316 --> 01:55:45.876]  It's all about meeting like-minded people.
[01:55:45.936 --> 01:55:47.257]  It's all about getting back on their face.
[01:55:47.557 --> 01:55:54.221]  It's all about spreading the word and starting conversations and exercising the First Amendment or losing it.
[01:55:55.194 --> 01:55:57.635]  And we have store-wide free shipping for a few more days.
[01:55:57.735 --> 01:56:03.717]  I don't think I'm going to keep the free shipping with some of the big specials we've got, because we're about to sell out of a lot of products.
[01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:06.799]  But right now, we've got 30% off the Good Halogen X2.
[01:56:07.179 --> 01:56:10.580]  Learn the secrets of nascent iodine and why ours is the best.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:18.143]  Get Z-Shield, known herbs and shilajit and zeolites that detoxify the heavy metals and toxins out of your body.
[01:56:18.163 --> 01:56:20.264]  That is a brand new product, really popular.
[01:56:20.284 --> 01:56:21.884]  30% off, out of the gate.
[01:56:21.944 --> 01:56:22.985]  I want you to get introduced to it.
[01:56:24.498 --> 01:56:34.082]  30 to 40% off all the My Patriot Supply food that we then private label, InfoWars Select, to be able to sell it for 30, 40% below what anybody else can.
[01:56:34.422 --> 01:56:41.565]  Water filters, the very best, lowest prices on ProPure, Alexa Pure, and others that blow away all the other gravity-fed filters.
[01:56:41.825 --> 01:56:44.506]  We have the side-by-side comparisons at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:45.646 --> 01:56:52.694]  But whatever you do, continue to support the broadcast because we're trying to support activists and patriots all over the world, not just here.
[01:56:52.995 --> 01:56:56.479]  And our talking points of liberty are leading the fight against the globalists.
[01:56:56.879 --> 01:57:04.629]  We'll have a few comments in the next little segment from Laura Loomer, but from you, Joe Biggs, final points you'd like to impart, you're going to be in studio tomorrow co-hosting.
[01:57:05.543 --> 01:57:06.043]  Roger that.
[01:57:06.163 --> 01:57:08.705]  So what's happening right now is the world's changing around us.
[01:57:09.126 --> 01:57:14.970]  What we have to start doing is understanding how that world's changing around us so we don't become victims.
[01:57:15.230 --> 01:57:17.111]  Like I said, there is a war going on.
[01:57:17.171 --> 01:57:18.532]  Many people don't realize it.
[01:57:18.933 --> 01:57:23.816]  But we are the targets of a violent, radical, leftist movement.
[01:57:24.076 --> 01:57:27.479]  And we're also the targets from radical Islamic jihadi terrorists.
[01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:30.161]  So we have to be on that extra lookout.
[01:57:30.441 --> 01:57:31.742]  Break that complacency.
[01:57:32.082 --> 01:57:34.404]  Learn to think outside of that box you normally are.
[01:57:34.804 --> 01:57:36.345]  Don't put yourself in a comfort zone.
[01:57:36.405 --> 01:57:39.426]  Put yourself in an uncomfortable situation mentally.
[01:57:39.506 --> 01:57:43.287]  Prepare yourself and be ready for these violent attacks.
[01:57:43.707 --> 01:57:54.090]  Now, don't ever go out and violently do something first, but in a defensive manner, if you are attacked, you should always have something pre-planned in your head and ready to react at that point in time.
[01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:55.831]  Break out of that complacency.
[01:57:55.871 --> 01:57:56.831]  Change your mindset.
[01:57:57.111 --> 01:57:58.912]  It's important right now because, like I said,
[01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:04.099]  We are the targets from a very violent, radical, leftist movement.
[01:58:04.479 --> 01:58:05.561]  And they're gaining momentum.
[01:58:05.801 --> 01:58:12.190]  And the best thing we can do is to be ready for that and have a clear path to that way that we can do something.
[01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:14.212]  Joe, how do folks follow you on Twitter and Facebook?
[01:58:14.875 --> 01:58:18.817]  At Rambo Biggs, and then go to just Joe Biggs on Facebook.
[01:58:18.837 --> 01:58:19.857]  Trust me, you'll know the picture.
[01:58:19.877 --> 01:58:24.400]  I usually have a grizzly bear suit on, or I'm holding my daughter, so... Or both!
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.261]  That's America right there!
[01:58:27.761 --> 01:58:28.201]  Oh yeah!
[01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:31.823]  And folks, America isn't perfect, but compared to North Korea and most other places, it's great.
[01:58:32.303 --> 01:58:36.886]  That's where we're from, that's why we're promoting it, and we're hoping to spread it through peace worldwide.
[01:58:36.906 --> 01:58:41.328]  Third hour straight ahead, final comments from Laura Lermer, then your phone calls and more.
[01:58:41.368 --> 01:58:41.748]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.828 --> 01:58:46.695]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:48.241 --> 01:58:50.450]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.781 --> 01:58:59.664]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:59:00.465 --> 01:59:03.407]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:59:04.067 --> 01:59:06.869]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:12.373]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:59:12.733 --> 01:59:19.037]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:59:19.397 --> 01:59:24.561]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:59:25.221 --> 01:59:28.642]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:59:29.223 --> 01:59:37.045]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.

[01:59:56.010 --> 02:00:00.122]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:00.644 --> 02:00:01.948]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:15.603 --> 02:00:20.746]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:21.246 --> 02:00:23.568]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.169 --> 02:00:32.133]  Well, her actions, along with Jack Posobiec covering it, was the number one story last weekend.
[02:00:33.974 --> 02:00:38.556]  And then in the next few days, more people stormed the stage to say, stop promoting murder.
[02:00:38.876 --> 02:00:39.657]  Here's some of that video.
[02:00:46.054 --> 02:00:51.056]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to pause.
[02:00:51.136 --> 02:00:54.518]  We're going to pause security.
[02:00:54.538 --> 02:00:55.278]  Security, please.
[02:01:08.823 --> 02:01:11.185]  Now, I mean, these are the people that love to disrupt everybody else's events.
[02:01:11.205 --> 02:01:15.568]  And I thought it was so anti-free speech when she did it.
[02:01:16.289 --> 02:01:17.670]  You are all Goebbels!
[02:01:18.110 --> 02:01:20.952]  You are all Nazis like Joseph Goebbels!
[02:01:21.313 --> 02:01:22.453]  This is Goebbels!
[02:01:22.734 --> 02:01:24.155]  You are all Goebbels!
[02:01:24.235 --> 02:01:27.237]  Imagine if Trump had rallies where he simulated the death of Obama.
[02:01:27.257 --> 02:01:32.401]  I mean, the left got a rodeo clown who was Hispanic, looking like Obama, as a clown band.
[02:01:33.982 --> 02:01:34.743]  But then they...
[02:01:37.546 --> 02:01:38.886]  They want to be able to simulate killing the President.
[02:01:40.047 --> 02:01:43.548]  Which is their free speech, but people are going to protest it.
[02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:47.489]  Then they play games and say, oh we're not really talking about the President.
[02:01:47.989 --> 02:01:50.390]  Laura, just in the last few minutes we've got to commend what you're doing.
[02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:53.951]  Obviously more of this is going to happen because we're not left-wing or right-wing in my view.
[02:01:54.251 --> 02:01:57.732]  We're just responding to their bullying, so I commend you for fighting these bullies.
[02:01:58.663 --> 02:02:01.024]  Thank you so much, and you're a source of inspiration to me.
[02:02:01.125 --> 02:02:03.886]  I definitely have been an info warrior for a long time now.
[02:02:04.747 --> 02:02:12.832]  People like Mike Cernovich, people like the Rebel Media, James O'Keefe over at Project Veritas, where I used to work, all of you are leading the fight against the left.
[02:02:13.112 --> 02:02:15.754]  And, you know, the mainstream media sure as hell isn't doing it.
[02:02:15.834 --> 02:02:22.318]  So, you know, I would encourage people to follow you and follow those others who are, you know, leading this fight against this
[02:02:23.158 --> 02:02:26.563]  Why do you think you're so violent now?
[02:02:35.874 --> 02:02:38.055]  I really honestly attribute it to Islam, right?
[02:02:38.075 --> 02:02:46.757]  A lot of people don't make the connection, but the left, you know, throughout Obama's presidency especially, they decided to align themselves with Islam.
[02:02:47.077 --> 02:02:48.958]  And these are Islamic tactics.
[02:02:48.978 --> 02:02:50.238]  This is jihad, right?
[02:02:50.578 --> 02:02:52.839]  This is the left's form of jihad.
[02:02:52.859 --> 02:02:57.500]  They're using ISIS tactics of beheading, stabbing people.
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:58.620]  Running over people with cars.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:04.122]  In fact, a lot of leftists, as you know, celebrate the jihadist attacks that are taking place.
[02:03:05.213 --> 02:03:07.534]  Yeah, of course, because why wouldn't they?
[02:03:07.614 --> 02:03:11.695]  Because, I mean, they don't stand for the West.
[02:03:11.735 --> 02:03:13.576]  They don't stand for the Constitution, right?
[02:03:13.856 --> 02:03:20.899]  Jihad is opposed to the West and it wants to destroy Western civilization and everything that's good about democracy and the United States Constitution.
[02:03:21.259 --> 02:03:24.940]  And Sharia law is totally incompatible with the United States Constitution.
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.781]  And, you know, we already have
[02:03:28.101 --> 02:03:37.284]  You know, 51% of the Muslims living in this country already want to replace the Constitution with Sharia law, and so if we keep on importing these people, they're going to start to influence the... Exactly!
[02:03:37.444 --> 02:03:44.526]  I'm all for bringing Muslims in if they want to adapt and don't want to put hoods over their wives' heads and cut their genitals off and stuff like that.
[02:03:44.546 --> 02:03:48.207]  I mean, you know, Christians in some areas a thousand years ago did similar, you know, things.
[02:03:48.247 --> 02:03:49.628]  Not exactly that bad, but similar.
[02:03:49.928 --> 02:03:52.588]  They've got to reform, but instead they say, we are reforming.
[02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:54.029]  ISIS is our reform.
[02:03:56.087 --> 02:03:59.168]  Yeah, I mean, this, there is no reform, right?
[02:03:59.188 --> 02:04:03.329]  What people need to understand is there is no, there has not been a reform movement with Islam.
[02:04:03.349 --> 02:04:06.729]  There has not been a moderate movement with Islam, right?
[02:04:06.789 --> 02:04:10.630]  There is only one Quran, and, you know, it's their ideology.
[02:04:10.690 --> 02:04:19.552]  It's their, it's their... Why has Christianity and Judaism and so many other religions gotten more moderate over the last few thousand years, and Islam gets worse and worse?
[02:04:21.233 --> 02:04:21.493]  Yeah, I...
[02:04:22.645 --> 02:04:26.827]  I mean, a lot of people... I personally view Islam as more of a death cult.
[02:04:28.087 --> 02:04:30.988]  You know, I try and stay away from... No, no, I agree.
[02:04:31.028 --> 02:04:31.729]  It's not a religion.
[02:04:31.769 --> 02:04:33.049]  It's a political death cult.
[02:04:33.749 --> 02:04:34.870]  I don't call it a religion.
[02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:36.971]  So, that's your answer right there.
[02:04:37.091 --> 02:04:38.711]  It's not a religion.
[02:04:38.731 --> 02:04:44.254]  So, it's not like Christianity or Judaism because it's a death cult.
[02:04:46.475 --> 02:04:48.755]  Well, it certainly is being exercised as one today.
[02:04:48.796 --> 02:04:50.576]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:50.596 --> 02:04:52.237]  Where's the best place again for folks to follow you?
[02:04:53.115 --> 02:04:55.977]  I'm just at World Rumor and the Rebel Media.
[02:04:56.438 --> 02:04:57.598]  Rebel Media doing a lot of great work.
[02:04:58.139 --> 02:05:00.641]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with your phone calls and ton of news.
[02:05:00.681 --> 02:05:01.101]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.585 --> 02:05:12.930]  Gad Saad, he is professor of marketing, evolutionary behavioral scientist, and an author in his own right.
[02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:15.912]  The YouTube channel is YouTube.com slash Gad Saad.
[02:05:15.932 --> 02:05:17.053]  That's two A's in Saad.
[02:05:17.633 --> 02:05:20.095]  And Twitter.com forward slash Gad Saad.
[02:05:20.135 --> 02:05:20.956]  Gad, welcome back.
[02:05:21.846 --> 02:05:22.726]  Great to be with you, Paul.
[02:05:22.746 --> 02:05:23.326]  Thank you for having me.
[02:05:23.526 --> 02:05:28.787]  Of course, we had the Manchester bombing, and in the aftermath of that, we heard the same narrative.
[02:05:29.207 --> 02:05:31.548]  And it's this, you know, we must unite against hatred.
[02:05:31.768 --> 02:05:38.529]  Do you think when they say unite against hatred, they're not talking about uniting against the hatred implicit within Islamism?
[02:05:38.809 --> 02:05:45.130]  They're talking about uniting against, basically, us, conservatives, or anyone who speaks out about Islam.
[02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:48.511]  I mean, that's the sense I get when they use that kind of rhetoric.
[02:05:48.531 --> 02:05:48.951]  Do you agree?
[02:05:50.164 --> 02:05:50.524]  Indeed.
[02:05:50.544 --> 02:05:53.606]  I mean, I think you covered it on your own channel.
[02:05:53.706 --> 02:06:07.032]  The professor, Dr. Katy Perry, came out with a very brilliant strategy for we just need to unite, we need to hug it out, we need to band together, no more borders, no more walls, and the problems will be resolved.
[02:06:07.112 --> 02:06:13.895]  If only I knew that when my family were escaping persecution in Lebanon, we could have hugged it out and we could have remained in Beirut.
[02:06:14.913 --> 02:06:25.243]  That the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like no barriers, no borders, like we all need to just coexist.
[02:06:25.403 --> 02:06:25.604]  True.
[02:06:26.491 --> 02:06:46.646]  People who are willing to, you know, behead children, burn people alive in cages, that they're not really influenced by the word love and the word unite, no matter how many times you say it, no matter how many candles you light, no matter how many hashtags you tweet out, no matter how many Facebook profile pictures you change.
[02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:50.789]  The barbarians of ISIS, I don't think that really affects them, do you?
[02:06:51.896 --> 02:06:52.396]  No, I don't.
[02:06:52.836 --> 02:07:09.120]  I call this, by the way, Ostrich Parasitic Syndrome, which is a type of mental virus that causes people to reject data, to reject evidence, to reject logic, reason, and then simply utter out endless, useless, suicidal platitudes.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.540]  You're a white male!
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:14.541]  You're a white guy!
[02:07:14.561 --> 02:07:15.301]  You're a white male!
[02:07:16.309 --> 02:07:20.052]  Gad, I mean, political correctness is no longer just about being nice to people.
[02:07:20.393 --> 02:07:25.757]  It actually represents a harmful threat in these kind of situations, right?
[02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:31.222]  I've actually analogized political correctness to the spider's wasp.
[02:07:31.242 --> 02:07:35.085]  So the spider wasp stings a much larger spider.
[02:07:35.525 --> 02:07:45.029]  Rendering it zombified, it then drags it into its burrow, lays eggs on it, and then the offspring feed on it in vivo, right?
[02:07:45.469 --> 02:07:47.910]  And that's exactly what political correctness is.
[02:07:48.050 --> 02:08:03.277]  It's the spider wasp's sting that zombifies our ability to think rationally and critically, and we are slowly led to the abyss of infinite darkness quietly and without any fight in us.
[02:08:12.632 --> 02:08:17.055]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:17.676 --> 02:08:19.137]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:44.909 --> 02:08:45.969]  We are back live.
[02:08:46.610 --> 02:08:47.410]  Let's rack them up.
[02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:48.390]  Let's take your calls.
[02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:49.951]  I'm pretty good at talk radio.
[02:08:49.971 --> 02:08:56.173]  I love America, and I'm good at analyzing globalist operations, but I'm not good at going bam, bam, bam, taking your calls.
[02:08:56.314 --> 02:08:57.394]  I want to hear from military.
[02:08:57.694 --> 02:08:58.554]  I want to hear from police.
[02:08:58.574 --> 02:08:59.495]  I want to hear from citizens.
[02:08:59.795 --> 02:09:03.696]  I want to hear from people, no matter what color you are or where you're from, about the state of the world.
[02:09:05.177 --> 02:09:12.122]  Agree with me that Trump is really battling the globalists, trying to get as much as he can done, killing so many big New World Order operations.
[02:09:12.383 --> 02:09:13.523]  You know a man by his enemies?
[02:09:13.924 --> 02:09:15.445]  He's totally surrounded by hyenas.
[02:09:15.945 --> 02:09:24.292]  It just tears my heart out and my intellect out that I can't do more to defend free humanity trying to break free from globalism.
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:31.524]  And you've got, you know, the poor American dying in the North Korean custody, and liberals celebrating it and making jokes because he's white.
[02:09:31.544 --> 02:09:35.146]  You know, they see Asian whites, so if the white man dies, they win.
[02:09:35.166 --> 02:09:38.628]  This is total beyond KKK mental illness.
[02:09:39.329 --> 02:09:48.154]  We're going to get into so many other big subjects here as well today on the economy, on science discoveries, and so much more.
[02:09:48.194 --> 02:09:50.195]  But the toll-free number to join us is 800.
[02:09:51.716 --> 02:09:52.416]  We're good to go.
[02:10:07.483 --> 02:10:10.746]  I apologize that you might hurt your wrist hitting me with a baseball bat.
[02:10:11.126 --> 02:10:11.586]  I'm bad.
[02:10:11.666 --> 02:10:12.307]  Please kill me.
[02:10:12.948 --> 02:10:18.992]  Because the media is saying that conservatives allowing themselves to be stabbed, allowing themselves to be shot, is not enough.
[02:10:19.773 --> 02:10:21.875]  And that congressmen deserve to be shot.
[02:10:22.195 --> 02:10:23.416]  It's time to hunt Republicans.
[02:10:23.736 --> 02:10:24.897]  It's time to kill everybody.
[02:10:25.177 --> 02:10:26.418]  It's time to murder everybody.
[02:10:27.439 --> 02:10:28.379]  This is their rhetoric.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:32.021]  Then they'll take what I've said out of context to claim I want violence.
[02:10:32.721 --> 02:10:34.081]  I don't want offensive violence.
[02:10:34.221 --> 02:10:35.602]  I don't want to have a bloodletting.
[02:10:35.962 --> 02:10:48.987]  I won't feel powerful, you know, if there's a societal collapse and a horde of 30, you know, trendies starving to death come up my country driveway, you know, with clubs and weapons and I've got to open up from them, you know, from concealment.
[02:10:49.287 --> 02:10:52.468]  Because that's literally like putting a bunch of dead zombies on my front yard.
[02:10:53.428 --> 02:10:55.391]  I want to unlock the zombie brains.
[02:10:55.792 --> 02:11:01.901]  I want them to understand how the ultra-rich are manipulating them into collectivism so there's no middle class, no upward mobility.
[02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:04.245]  I want them to look at the real science and metrics.
[02:11:05.523 --> 02:11:08.945]  So that they understand the facts of history.
[02:11:09.806 --> 02:11:12.948]  And that capitalism creates incredible wealth.
[02:11:13.268 --> 02:11:14.909]  It creates incredibly rich elites.
[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:21.133]  And those robber barons always then try to pull up the ladder and make sure the rest of the public stays poor.
[02:11:21.434 --> 02:11:31.220]  But capitalism and free market creates fantastic wealth and medicine and science and technology and choice and innovation like nothing has in history.
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:32.701]  It is the Renaissance.
[02:11:32.781 --> 02:11:34.903]  It's only been partially realized.
[02:11:35.763 --> 02:11:37.445]  At America's peak, maybe 30%.
[02:11:37.785 --> 02:11:39.566]  Right now, maybe 10% of it's been realized.
[02:11:39.907 --> 02:11:46.932]  We're in decline, but we can explode back into a flowering period anytime we want.
[02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:59.042]  The problem is, the paradox that it creates so much wealth and so much choice and so much decadence, that our children and their children and their children, that's us, become decadent.
[02:12:02.825 --> 02:12:03.005]  So,
[02:12:04.207 --> 02:12:10.774]  I don't care if you're a Hispanic immigrant, a European immigrant, an African immigrant, an Asian immigrant, it doesn't matter.
[02:12:12.215 --> 02:12:20.524]  First generation that comes here legally lawfully to work is super hardworking, amazing, moral, because they come from really dangerous hell holes and people appreciate the freedom.
[02:12:21.323 --> 02:12:28.027]  Second generation, a little more lazy, goes to college, the college fills them full of poison for the nation, fills them full of division.
[02:12:28.248 --> 02:12:32.350]  That's because the big banks own those colleges and run them, and want you to be screwed up.
[02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:34.071]  They want you to have a worthless degree.
[02:12:34.291 --> 02:12:35.672]  They want you to be under their control.
[02:12:37.393 --> 02:12:43.577]  Then the next generation of those people gets even more spoiled brat, and even more hateful, and basically here we are today.
[02:12:45.238 --> 02:12:48.821]  You look at what conditions were like on average 80 years ago in this country, they were hellish.
[02:12:49.977 --> 02:12:51.799]  Now they were a lot better than they were in other countries.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:57.084]  But if you look at the graph, we're only going upward until about the 1990s.
[02:12:57.184 --> 02:12:58.625]  And we've been going downward since.
[02:12:59.086 --> 02:13:01.208]  We need to reverse the downward spiral.
[02:13:01.308 --> 02:13:01.909]  Innovation.
[02:13:02.329 --> 02:13:02.629]  Wealth.
[02:13:03.615 --> 02:13:04.156]  Creation.
[02:13:04.516 --> 02:13:10.183]  Free market is the answer, but it doesn't allow Bezos to have a global monopoly over trades and goods.
[02:13:10.643 --> 02:13:14.108]  It doesn't let Goldman Sachs have a global monopoly over investment banking.
[02:13:14.328 --> 02:13:18.693]  It doesn't let JPMorgan have a global monopoly over consumer banking and stocks and bonds.
[02:13:18.973 --> 02:13:21.577]  It doesn't let the monopoly men have their system.
[02:13:22.833 --> 02:13:26.336]  Read the books written by John D. Rockefeller and John D. II.
[02:13:26.596 --> 02:13:28.278]  Read the books written by David Rockefeller.
[02:13:28.498 --> 02:13:29.939]  Read the books written by Henry Kissinger.
[02:13:30.159 --> 02:13:32.081]  Read the books written by Brzezinski.
[02:13:32.601 --> 02:13:33.322]  I've read them.
[02:13:34.483 --> 02:13:35.143]  I've read them.
[02:13:35.243 --> 02:13:36.184]  I've read their writings.
[02:13:36.364 --> 02:13:37.185]  I know them.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:39.026]  I know who they are.
[02:13:39.467 --> 02:13:40.588]  I know who their scam is.
[02:13:40.828 --> 02:13:42.930]  I know they think you're failures and stupid and hate you.
[02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:44.211]  I know they think that
[02:13:45.154 --> 02:13:52.579]  You're losers, so why should they not dumb you down and give you a failed ideology of collectivism, which they then control and are exempt from?
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:58.263]  It is absolute fact that North Korea is a hellhole, that Venezuela is a hellhole.
[02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:01.285]  It's an absolute fact that Cuba is a hellhole.
[02:14:02.426 --> 02:14:05.608]  It's an absolute fact that anywhere under communism is a nightmare.
[02:14:06.248 --> 02:14:14.394]  But again, the leftists run around mindlessly with the big banks and the big billionaires, pushing it, pushing it, pushing it, as cultural poison.
[02:14:15.413 --> 02:14:19.455]  Like weights, like balls and chains, to slow down humanity.
[02:14:19.796 --> 02:14:21.737]  Go read their writings for yourself.
[02:14:23.098 --> 02:14:29.982]  Brian, Hans, Cynthia, James, Brandon and others, your phone calls right now, when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[02:14:30.002 --> 02:14:31.883]  800-259-9231.
[02:14:31.923 --> 02:14:43.090]  Then coming up, Hannity agrees with Alex Jones, demands NBC release the tapes of the Alex Jones interview.
[02:14:44.292 --> 02:14:49.076]  We're also going to get into several other key reports that I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:14:50.156 --> 02:15:00.204]  Larry Wilmore roasted Otto Warmbier, made fun of him on Comedy Central and many other publications did, like Huffington Post.
[02:15:00.264 --> 02:15:01.085]  Now he's dead.
[02:15:02.927 --> 02:15:09.656]  Theresa May calls for internet censorship and a police state to counter Islamophobia that she helped bring in and empower.
[02:15:09.937 --> 02:15:11.239]  That's the right-wing government doing that.
[02:15:11.459 --> 02:15:14.063]  They bring in the incompatible Stone Age population.
[02:15:15.876 --> 02:15:22.039]  Gosh, they've dug up Stone Age systems all over the world, from Mesoamerica to Europe to Asia, and they didn't treat women like that.
[02:15:22.059 --> 02:15:25.981]  Women were actually the center of the home, and they were basically worshipped as goddesses.
[02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:31.824]  You study every ancient culture, that before agrarianism kicked in, I mean, why not?
[02:15:31.844 --> 02:15:32.524]  She can make babies.
[02:15:32.544 --> 02:15:33.205]  She's got milk.
[02:15:33.545 --> 02:15:34.165]  She's warm.
[02:15:34.225 --> 02:15:34.786]  She's squishy.
[02:15:34.826 --> 02:15:35.286]  She's nice.
[02:15:37.472 --> 02:15:41.414]  So I shouldn't insult Stone Age peoples, because they were all universally hidden oppressed women.
[02:15:42.335 --> 02:15:48.018]  There were some smaller tribes that would kidnap and enslave others, but that didn't last long in different periods.
[02:15:48.038 --> 02:15:54.963]  It was normally to make you breed with them, so you were only the slave class, the first generation, but that gets into complex anthropology.
[02:15:56.024 --> 02:16:11.376]  The point is, is that Islam, if you study history, in its current orthodox form is the most barbarous, backward, hateful, anti-freedom system there is, and the globals are allied with it because it's helping bring in their world government.
[02:16:11.576 --> 02:16:15.179]  So that's why I'm anti-authoritarianism, so I am Islamophobic.
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:16.641]  I am Islamophobic.
[02:16:17.001 --> 02:16:17.942]  I am Islamophobic.
[02:16:18.082 --> 02:16:20.604]  I am phobic of black widow spiders for a reason.
[02:16:21.877 --> 02:16:23.158]  I've seen it kill somebody, I know.
[02:16:23.458 --> 02:16:26.639]  I'm phobic of brown recluses because I've seen somebody lose their leg from one.
[02:16:27.199 --> 02:16:31.261]  I'm phobic of pit bulls running out of somebody's garage and biting somebody because I've seen it happen.
[02:16:31.921 --> 02:16:35.663]  I am phobic of heights because I've seen people fall off a cliff.
[02:16:36.023 --> 02:16:37.463]  I have these instincts for a reason.
[02:16:38.344 --> 02:16:40.885]  They're trying to get us to not follow our basic common sense.
[02:16:44.426 --> 02:16:47.307]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Brian in Wisconsin.
[02:16:47.748 --> 02:16:48.768]  Brian, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:50.987 --> 02:16:52.207]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:16:52.447 --> 02:16:52.927]  Thank you, brother.
[02:16:52.967 --> 02:16:55.928]  Thanks for calling.
[02:16:56.648 --> 02:16:57.128]  Thanks.
[02:16:57.309 --> 02:17:03.670]  I was just curious if you remember that Connie Chung interview of Newt Gingrich's mom.
[02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:07.331]  Oh, when she was so mean?
[02:17:09.291 --> 02:17:16.473]  Yeah, well, Connie wanted to know what Newt thought about Hillary.
[02:17:17.713 --> 02:17:19.834]  And Connie's mom said, well, I can't tell you that.
[02:17:21.323 --> 02:17:23.924]  And Connie said, oh, come on, you can tell me.
[02:17:23.944 --> 02:17:25.465]  It's just between you and me.
[02:17:25.485 --> 02:17:35.490]  And then Newt Smile goes, well, he said she's a B-I-T-C-H.
[02:17:35.550 --> 02:17:38.952]  I don't know if I can say that on the air or not.
[02:17:40.175 --> 02:17:44.758]  I remember that, and then Connie Chung's ratings went from bad to almost zero and she got fired.
[02:17:44.778 --> 02:17:48.920]  Or they put her to like magazine shows, which is how they put them out in the pasture.
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:53.142]  You're right, and now her ratings, Megan's have gone from 6 million to 3.5.
[02:17:53.282 --> 02:17:55.924]  They say they're looking for an exit of her.
[02:17:56.997 --> 02:17:57.477]  They're saying it.
[02:17:57.497 --> 02:18:04.840]  Even the New York Post is saying, or the New Yorker is saying, before Megyn Kelly, Connie Chung was the female anchor Trump hated most.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:09.962]  So, are you about to say what I think you're about to say, that this will be her Waterloo as well?
[02:18:11.963 --> 02:18:15.184]  Well, that's what I was thinking, because that's what happened to Connie Chung after that.
[02:18:15.204 --> 02:18:17.065]  That really turned off a lot of people.
[02:18:18.606 --> 02:18:21.327]  Well, I know there's even liberals everywhere hate Megyn Kelly now.
[02:18:21.367 --> 02:18:22.968]  I mean, everybody could see it was totally edited.
[02:18:22.988 --> 02:18:23.588]  It was a joke.
[02:18:25.154 --> 02:18:30.017]  Yeah, maybe that's something you guys could do is make a video comparing the two interviews.
[02:18:30.497 --> 02:18:32.919]  I just wrote down what you said.
[02:18:33.999 --> 02:18:36.301]  Is Megyn Kelly the most deceptive interviewer ever?
[02:18:36.701 --> 02:18:44.306]  And then like, coming up, look at Connie Chung, look at... Who was the lady that got caught editing the gun video?
[02:18:44.946 --> 02:18:46.247]  So they sounded like morons.
[02:18:46.267 --> 02:18:46.827]  Katie Couric.
[02:18:47.167 --> 02:18:48.188]  Who is the most deceptive?
[02:18:48.208 --> 02:18:48.688]  Let me ask you.
[02:18:48.748 --> 02:18:49.489]  Is it Connie Chung?
[02:18:49.869 --> 02:18:50.509]  Katie Couric?
[02:18:51.590 --> 02:18:52.911]  Or is it Megyn Kelly?
[02:18:55.168 --> 02:18:58.250]  Well, I was, uh, I don't know what to say.
[02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:59.370]  I'd have to say Megyn Kelly.
[02:19:02.112 --> 02:19:03.413]  And we're not bashing women here.
[02:19:04.553 --> 02:19:14.399]  There are other deceptive reporters, but coming to mind for being the most deceptive and lying to people, off record and not being off record, it does seem like they're kind of the queens of this.
[02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:17.201]  Who's another really deceptive reporter that's a man?
[02:19:18.041 --> 02:19:18.442]  I have no idea.
[02:19:18.502 --> 02:19:18.862]  I can't think of...
[02:19:37.077 --> 02:19:39.699]  of a man being that deceptive in that way.
[02:19:40.239 --> 02:19:43.961]  Now, Wolf Blitzer just pretty much agreed with, you know, shooting the congressman.
[02:19:43.981 --> 02:19:49.925]  You know, he kind of had the guy on to say he's not evil, he's just sick of politics, but Blitzer's like, well, here's your opinion, and kind of nods his head.
[02:19:50.205 --> 02:19:52.247]  You know, Blitzer at least lets us know what he thinks.
[02:19:52.507 --> 02:19:54.568]  He's horrible, he's evil, but he's moron.
[02:19:54.608 --> 02:19:57.430]  Nuh-uh, Brian Williams, he's worse than all three women.
[02:19:58.170 --> 02:19:59.751]  Ah, Brian Williams, I think he's the worst.
[02:20:08.404 --> 02:20:10.757]  What is it going to take?
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:12.185]  What is it gonna take?
[02:20:13.198 --> 02:20:26.728]  We have a situation here where an Islamic terrorist set off an explosive device killing children going to see a pop concert at an arena.
[02:20:28.129 --> 02:20:39.318]  What is it going to take before I, after an event like this happens, I go to Twitter, pick up my phone, I go to Twitter and I'm like, wow, everyone agrees this has to stop.
[02:20:40.118 --> 02:20:46.283]  Everyone actually agrees that this needs to have some type of resolution to it.
[02:20:46.603 --> 02:20:57.931]  But, kids being murdered by Islamic terrorism, and I go to Twitter and it's, oh right, let's not fall for being Islamophobic.
[02:20:59.072 --> 02:21:01.554]  Let's look at the reasons they're doing this.
[02:21:02.734 --> 02:21:03.795]  Lone wolf.
[02:21:04.476 --> 02:21:06.017]  Oh wait, it was a balloon puppet.
[02:21:06.844 --> 02:21:09.665]  I am so disgusted.
[02:21:10.165 --> 02:21:14.546]  It's gotten to the point where these aren't soldiers.
[02:21:14.926 --> 02:21:21.048]  These aren't people that signed on to take the risk of fighting a war.
[02:21:21.728 --> 02:21:29.510]  These were children and their parents going to see an Ariana Grande show.
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:36.085]  That's not something you look at and go, well, you know, they kind of asked for it.
[02:21:36.285 --> 02:21:41.389]  Although, boy, you look at Twitter again and you will actually see that.
[02:21:42.010 --> 02:21:57.703]  People that cannot do anything but try to find anyone else to blame for these horrific attacks that we're seeing being carried out by Islam, in the name of Islam.
[02:22:00.559 --> 02:22:07.943]  This guy that did this, this is a gentleman that was known to law enforcement.
[02:22:08.383 --> 02:22:15.246]  I love that one because it's every single time these people are known to law enforcement.
[02:22:16.487 --> 02:22:17.787]  What the hell are you waiting for?
[02:22:18.528 --> 02:22:19.508]  What are you waiting for?
[02:22:19.528 --> 02:22:22.270]  He's known to law enforcement.
[02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:24.811]  He traveled to Libya.
[02:22:26.176 --> 02:22:34.943]  To see dear old dad and his brothers, I gather, that he comes back to the UK and they don't pull this guy aside and interview him?
[02:22:35.483 --> 02:22:35.984]  And talk to him?
[02:22:36.544 --> 02:22:47.933]  If a guy known to law enforcement for being involved in some type of Islamic shenanigans travels to Libya, then comes back to the UK,
[02:22:49.765 --> 02:22:51.646]  That's the guy you should be talking to.
[02:22:51.947 --> 02:22:57.591]  That's the drop everything, this piece of garbage just came back from Libya.
[02:22:58.031 --> 02:22:59.872]  Send someone to have a chat with him.
[02:23:03.215 --> 02:23:07.638]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:23:07.698 --> 02:23:18.646]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:23:18.786 --> 02:23:23.709]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:23:23.829 --> 02:23:26.351]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:23:26.411 --> 02:23:27.912]  It helps detoxify.
[02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.954]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:23:31.014 --> 02:23:35.757]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:23:35.777 --> 02:23:42.022]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:23:42.042 --> 02:23:47.345]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:23:48.746 --> 02:23:49.827]  Hey, this is so key.
[02:23:50.047 --> 02:23:54.349]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:23:54.369 --> 02:23:56.470]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:23:56.610 --> 02:24:00.012]  Exclusively available at Infowarslive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:24:00.032 --> 02:24:00.732]  If you just joined us,
[02:24:18.956 --> 02:24:26.439]  We had an amazing caller on that brought back a piece of ancient history I'd forgotten about in like 1994, 1995.
[02:24:26.619 --> 02:24:40.785]  Connie Chung is interviewing Newt Gingrich's mother and then says, this is off record between you and me during the filming.
[02:24:41.386 --> 02:24:42.466]  What does he really think of Hillary?
[02:24:42.926 --> 02:24:44.287]  Well, he thinks she's a bitch.
[02:24:45.754 --> 02:24:51.717]  And then that blew up in her face, and she ended up losing her anchoring job over it, because the ratings went away!
[02:24:53.258 --> 02:24:55.339]  The same thing happened to Piers Morgan when I went on his show.
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.621]  His ratings were almost gone two weeks later.
[02:25:00.122 --> 02:25:11.948]  The same thing has happened to so many of these people, and I think that we are seeing MSM's Waterloo, their fall, because they're still so arrogant and they don't learn new tricks.
[02:25:12.208 --> 02:25:15.110]  Whether it's Brian Williams saying he got shot down in a helicopter.
[02:25:16.291 --> 02:25:16.691]  When he didn't.
[02:25:16.931 --> 02:25:17.572]  And all the other lies.
[02:25:17.952 --> 02:25:20.454]  Or whether it's Connie Chung saying, oh this is off record, don't worry.
[02:25:20.494 --> 02:25:22.855]  Or Megyn Kelly saying, I promise it's not a hit piece.
[02:25:22.895 --> 02:25:23.876]  I promise we won't edit it.
[02:25:24.196 --> 02:25:25.437]  I promise I really like you.
[02:25:25.477 --> 02:25:26.317]  I'm obsessed with you.
[02:25:26.757 --> 02:25:27.998]  And of course I knew it was going to be a hit piece.
[02:25:28.038 --> 02:25:28.738]  I wanted to see this.
[02:25:28.779 --> 02:25:29.719]  That she'd lie like that.
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.180]  We put the tape out.
[02:25:33.742 --> 02:25:35.222]  So who is the most disingenuous?
[02:25:35.282 --> 02:25:37.844]  Who is the biggest liar in MSM?
[02:25:38.124 --> 02:25:39.185]  We should have a contest.
[02:25:40.111 --> 02:25:46.114]  Where people put out different videos and show the different lives and then have folks vote online at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:48.475 --> 02:25:53.798]  But I'm going to post a clip later of that call if you just tuned in so you can hear it at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:55.168 --> 02:26:06.177]  And then see folks were live on air, but I'll now take that clip, put it on the front of the caller, put that out for a viral video, to get people talking, to just remember what liars these people are, and celebrate what liars they are.
[02:26:06.757 --> 02:26:09.219]  And by celebrate, what a joke they are, what villains.
[02:26:09.719 --> 02:26:11.241]  Oh, there's the Legion of Doom again!
[02:26:11.961 --> 02:26:16.064]  Even though Alex is like a big, fat, sweating walrus, and, you know, they cut him all up.
[02:26:16.485 --> 02:26:18.726]  You know, Alex has got his own problems, but he's one of us.
[02:26:19.487 --> 02:26:20.528]  We sure hate this lady.
[02:26:23.308 --> 02:26:25.068]  Had the worst ratings ever.
[02:26:26.949 --> 02:26:31.570]  In fact, when we put that piece together, let's clip in the Connie Chung clip just because you guys found it.
[02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:33.270]  In fact, I'll play that in the next segment.
[02:26:33.370 --> 02:26:34.691]  I want to go back to your calls right now.
[02:26:36.111 --> 02:26:42.733]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hans in Pennsylvania.
[02:26:43.153 --> 02:26:43.633]  Hello, Hans.
[02:26:45.199 --> 02:26:46.060]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.862]  I got an email from a friend of mine a couple weeks ago.
[02:26:49.882 --> 02:26:51.903]  I've been trying to get this information to you.
[02:26:52.604 --> 02:27:07.934]  Our customs people in Florida confiscated 52 tons of smuggled guns and ammunition packaged as furniture and shipped in 14 Comex shipping containers from Muslim Turkey to a Muslim arms manufacturer in Florida.
[02:27:09.535 --> 02:27:13.998]  And the stuff is packaged as furniture and it looks like
[02:27:15.033 --> 02:27:15.773]  I think?
[02:27:33.581 --> 02:27:33.781]  I don't
[02:27:48.581 --> 02:27:50.182]  No, I mean, I have the copy of the newspaper.
[02:27:50.222 --> 02:27:53.383]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:27:53.403 --> 02:27:55.183]  Now, in that case, we had documentation.
[02:27:55.384 --> 02:27:58.345]  Is this in the news or do you have this from sources?
[02:27:58.365 --> 02:27:58.925]  Please tell me.
[02:28:13.692 --> 02:28:20.714]  I have an email of an article with six photographs of Customs going through these containers and showing the weapons as they were.
[02:28:21.074 --> 02:28:26.055]  Listen, we've had ICE reach out to us and Customs and give us big breaking stories, too.
[02:28:26.075 --> 02:28:30.277]  When Obama was letting the illegals in, outside law, two years before they admitted it.
[02:28:30.317 --> 02:28:35.478]  So I know Customs does a great job in their order to let stuff in, you know, to at least expose what's happening.
[02:28:35.518 --> 02:28:37.579]  But it shows the bureaucracy, though.
[02:28:37.639 --> 02:28:39.259]  Trump's trying to tighten down on things.
[02:28:39.759 --> 02:28:42.220]  But you're saying from this source that they were able to stop it?
[02:28:44.045 --> 02:28:47.666]  Uh, this particular shipment they stopped, but who knows how many other shipments got through.
[02:28:48.406 --> 02:28:57.229]  And it's an ideal way for them to use the packaged weapons and ship them through UPS or whoever to the individual mosques across the country.
[02:28:57.249 --> 02:29:01.750]  They can ship tons of weapons to these people without anybody even knowing about it.
[02:29:02.863 --> 02:29:09.275]  I'm going to look for this story that you talked about, but regardless, shipping in into Europe, 5-6 million.
[02:29:09.776 --> 02:29:14.405]  They say it's been 10 million just the last few years, according to the UN total, Islamic refugees into the West.
[02:29:15.419 --> 02:29:16.640]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands here.
[02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:17.520]  The numbers are much higher.
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:18.600]  Obama kept those secret.
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:23.382]  Trump's just trying to find out what happened, and the State Department and Congress are just blocking him along with the courts.
[02:29:23.722 --> 02:29:24.743]  That's a level of sedition.
[02:29:24.763 --> 02:29:29.905]  But if you bring in a bunch of military-age men who are admittedly jihadis, it's the same as bringing the weapons in.
[02:29:30.225 --> 02:29:31.305]  In fact, it's more dangerous.
[02:29:31.345 --> 02:29:33.746]  So, I think your story is very, very plausible.
[02:29:34.086 --> 02:29:37.527]  We'll research it and look into it, because we know the gun isn't dangerous.
[02:29:37.808 --> 02:29:41.149]  It's the jihadi, globalist, pedophile brain.
[02:29:42.049 --> 02:29:43.331]  So thank you so much, Hans.
[02:29:43.351 --> 02:29:44.972]  We'll look into that right now.
[02:29:45.053 --> 02:29:48.376]  Send us any of those emails to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:29:48.636 --> 02:29:50.058]  You're the eyes and ears of the Republic.
[02:29:50.298 --> 02:29:52.401]  Cynthia, James, Travis, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:29:52.641 --> 02:29:53.542]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.022 --> 02:29:55.624]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.565 --> 02:29:59.248]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.358 --> 02:30:07.882]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:30:08.363 --> 02:30:14.390]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:30:14.811 --> 02:30:17.594]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:17.994 --> 02:30:20.958]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:24.621]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:30:24.962 --> 02:30:26.703]  The left controls culture.
[02:30:26.743 --> 02:30:27.724]  They control arts.
[02:30:27.784 --> 02:30:29.026]  They control entertainment.
[02:30:29.306 --> 02:30:36.393]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:36.453 --> 02:30:38.855]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:30:39.336 --> 02:30:43.199]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:30:43.259 --> 02:30:45.321]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[02:30:45.942 --> 02:30:51.324]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[02:30:51.565 --> 02:30:57.827]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:30:57.887 --> 02:30:59.588]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:30:59.748 --> 02:31:00.929]  It's available right now.

[02:32:04.045 --> 02:32:06.707]  One thing I love to talk about is liberal hypocrisy.
[02:32:06.767 --> 02:32:09.650]  Today I want to talk about Ben and Jerry's, the ice cream makers out of Vermont.
[02:32:09.730 --> 02:32:23.061]  At the end of last year, they wrote an open letter to President Trump where they talked about how they are strong advocates for racial, social justice, women, people of color, Muslims, migrants, refugees, the poor, and those who are further compromised by the policies and rhetoric you espouse during your campaign.
[02:32:23.281 --> 02:32:27.184]  Well, over the weekend, scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben and Jerry's.
[02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:27.585]  Why?
[02:32:27.705 --> 02:32:32.909]  Because the migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by the farms that provide milk to Ben and Jerry's.
[02:32:33.089 --> 02:32:45.779]  And these migrant farm workers, many of whom are illegal, started the Milk with Dignity program in 2014 with the Vermont group Migrant Justice to ensure farms provide migrant workers, some of which are illegal, fair wages, working conditions, and decent housing.
[02:32:45.799 --> 02:32:49.661]  In 2015, Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program, but they're still stuck in negotiations.
[02:32:49.882 --> 02:32:51.603]  So will they join the Milk with Dignity program?
[02:32:51.863 --> 02:32:52.263]  Who knows?
[02:32:52.303 --> 02:32:56.667]  But right now, migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure they get their freebies.
[02:32:56.907 --> 02:33:00.530]  We don't know the outcome, but one thing I sure do love is this liberal hypocrisy.
[02:33:00.610 --> 02:33:03.472]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:33:07.935 --> 02:33:14.180]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.042 --> 02:33:34.070]  You know, I want to direct the producers of this broadcast, who let me kind of run around and do whatever I want.
[02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:36.611]  It's my show, my little network in fours.
[02:33:39.693 --> 02:33:43.656]  But I do want to tell Nico Acosta and others, make me take calls every day.
[02:33:44.855 --> 02:33:57.519]  Because when you take calls every day, you get better callers, and they bring up so many wild cards and so many angles we forget about to put some perspective in of how much these news anchors get caught lying.
[02:33:58.799 --> 02:34:07.242]  I mean, I would never tell somebody, I'm going to do a soft interview with you, and I'm going to make you look good, and I'm going to be nice if I wasn't going to do it.
[02:34:07.722 --> 02:34:08.662]  I don't tell people that.
[02:34:10.743 --> 02:34:14.064]  We call up and say, come on, we'll ask you hard questions, you'll have as much time as we do.
[02:34:14.926 --> 02:34:21.950]  Don't be a coward after they start saying, no way, no way, I'm not going to dignify you by coming on.
[02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:23.911]  I'm not going to lower myself to your level.
[02:34:24.211 --> 02:34:24.731]  Oh, I get it.
[02:34:24.811 --> 02:34:25.872]  You can't debate me.
[02:34:26.252 --> 02:34:28.393]  You can't actually have a discussion live on air.
[02:34:29.434 --> 02:34:32.075]  I live live on TV, live on the radio.
[02:34:32.876 --> 02:34:33.636]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[02:34:33.676 --> 02:34:35.777]  Doesn't mean it's not a train wreck sometimes, but it's real.
[02:34:35.797 --> 02:34:38.539]  Everybody knows what I'm like live.
[02:34:38.599 --> 02:34:44.102]  They know when they see that Megyn Kelly piece, it's a train wreck by design.
[02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:50.593]  Where I'm a gibbering, stilted, addled moron, challenged by the mighty Megyn Kelly?
[02:34:50.993 --> 02:34:53.394]  Megyn Kelly had no appeal to me.
[02:34:53.414 --> 02:34:57.836]  It was super boring, it was work I had to do, because my gut told me to do it.
[02:34:59.337 --> 02:35:01.638]  I felt nasty when I got home that night.
[02:35:03.779 --> 02:35:09.682]  Because it was just such a joke to interface with the old, rotting facade of globalism.
[02:35:11.203 --> 02:35:12.384]  But look how far
[02:35:13.789 --> 02:35:16.131]  These arrogant pieces of garbage have slid.
[02:35:16.191 --> 02:35:26.800]  Back in Connie Chung's day, 20 years ago, in her heyday, she had on average 20 million viewers every night.
[02:35:28.301 --> 02:35:31.504]  Now the Nightly News has 5 on the major networks.
[02:35:32.705 --> 02:35:34.206]  And what happened to Megyn Kelly?
[02:35:34.607 --> 02:35:36.649]  For two weeks, the biggest item in the news cycle.
[02:35:36.709 --> 02:35:39.131]  Bigger than Comey, bigger than Russiagate, bigger than it all!
[02:35:40.794 --> 02:35:58.707]  It was Alex Jones, Megyn Kelly, and they used it as a way to demonize me and attack me, but MSM is so discredited, all it did was make giant crowds of people actually come and tune in, and now suddenly, groups that didn't even like me are liking us, and our audience is just swelling.
[02:35:58.968 --> 02:36:02.951]  We've never had listeners like this at this time during the summer.
[02:36:03.431 --> 02:36:06.833]  This is like a November-size audience.
[02:36:07.434 --> 02:36:09.215]  November's the hottest time on talk radio.
[02:36:09.475 --> 02:36:10.016]  Ask anybody.
[02:36:11.294 --> 02:36:18.880]  People are out, they're shopping, Christmas is coming up, it's cool, but politics is going on, there's always big battles in Congress, getting close to year end.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:22.583]  October-November is the hottest time of talk radio.
[02:36:24.344 --> 02:36:29.288]  And we have more listeners right now than we had in 2015 at this time.
[02:36:29.648 --> 02:36:30.689]  Sure, our peak was the
[02:36:32.819 --> 02:36:33.460]  2016 election.
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.701]  It was just unbelievable.
[02:36:36.081 --> 02:36:37.202]  It was ridiculous.
[02:36:37.902 --> 02:36:38.663]  Totally viral.
[02:36:39.583 --> 02:36:42.465]  87 million people that tuned in and watched in one week.
[02:36:44.506 --> 02:36:45.747]  Previous was about 30 million.
[02:36:47.228 --> 02:36:48.469]  The new high, 87 million.
[02:36:48.909 --> 02:36:50.170]  The new high, 47 million.
[02:36:50.810 --> 02:36:54.692]  And I've never been sitting here in June with 45, 50 million listeners.
[02:36:58.596 --> 02:36:59.217]  And here's the deal.
[02:36:59.958 --> 02:37:02.542]  More media requests than I could ever do in a lifetime.
[02:37:04.846 --> 02:37:11.435]  One of the biggest shows out there that I always go on is Coast to Coast AM, probably the second or third largest radio show in the world.
[02:37:11.716 --> 02:37:13.618]  Ten million listeners a night, for real!
[02:37:15.213 --> 02:37:16.674]  But see, oh, it's just talk radio.
[02:37:17.415 --> 02:37:18.556]  Oh, I didn't go on Coast to Coast.
[02:37:18.576 --> 02:37:19.497]  It's even subconscious.
[02:37:20.037 --> 02:37:25.482]  Oh, George Norrie, you know, with a show four times bigger than Megyn Kelly's, and he's been calling me for a week.
[02:37:25.542 --> 02:37:26.503]  Now, I've had family stuff.
[02:37:26.963 --> 02:37:27.904]  I've had kids that were sick.
[02:37:27.984 --> 02:37:28.605]  You know, stuff like that.
[02:37:28.625 --> 02:37:29.826]  I've got to call George down to Golf Air.
[02:37:29.846 --> 02:37:31.147]  It's not that I'm even belittling George.
[02:37:31.167 --> 02:37:33.169]  George has a bigger show than I do on Terrestrial Radio.
[02:37:33.369 --> 02:37:39.615]  He wants me to come on and actually tell my story of what really happened, unedited, just like Sean Hannity sang.
[02:37:39.995 --> 02:37:41.156]  So yes, George, I'll do it.
[02:37:41.396 --> 02:37:53.106]  I've had a lot of family stuff and things, and I just want to apologize to George Norey and to Tom Danheiser that you get a call, you mean to make it, then you forget, then you collapse at 9 o'clock at night, coast2coastam.com.
[02:37:53.407 --> 02:37:58.411]  That's the place for me to talk to America and to talk outside my audience and to really be able to lay it all out.
[02:37:58.451 --> 02:38:02.715]  So I will definitely get with George if it isn't too late and come back on his show.
[02:38:07.403 --> 02:38:19.192]  Alright, I want to go back to your phone calls, but since we talked about it, here is the Connie Chung interview from the mid-1990s that led to her being fired and her ratings collapsing because she would lie to an old lady.
[02:38:19.212 --> 02:38:19.652]  Here it is.
[02:38:21.114 --> 02:38:24.376]  Mrs. Gingrich, what has Newt told you about President Clinton?
[02:38:26.177 --> 02:38:26.618]  Nothing.
[02:38:27.118 --> 02:38:28.839]  And I can't tell you what he said about Hillary.
[02:38:28.859 --> 02:38:30.901]  You can't?
[02:38:31.221 --> 02:38:31.602]  I can't.
[02:38:32.282 --> 02:38:34.564]  Why don't you just whisper it to me, just between you and me?
[02:38:39.361 --> 02:38:43.022]  That's everything he ever said about her.
[02:38:45.462 --> 02:38:45.902]  Oh man.
[02:38:47.002 --> 02:38:47.963]  I'll tell you about Newt Gingrich.
[02:38:49.583 --> 02:38:50.563]  He's super smart.
[02:38:50.963 --> 02:38:51.583]  Ultra smart.
[02:38:52.503 --> 02:38:54.504]  He knows everything I know before I was born.
[02:38:55.584 --> 02:38:58.424]  He worked for Nelson Rockefeller and was let in on the whole show.
[02:38:58.444 --> 02:38:58.985]  He's a professor.
[02:38:59.025 --> 02:38:59.665]  He's a futurist.
[02:39:00.645 --> 02:39:05.466]  And he's written forwards to books calling for world government and world microchips.
[02:39:05.726 --> 02:39:06.526]  He is a technocrat.
[02:39:07.955 --> 02:39:08.955]  So, I don't trust him.
[02:39:09.776 --> 02:39:12.757]  But, when he argues for our side, there's none better.
[02:39:12.777 --> 02:39:15.958]  I mean, the guy is as smart as they come.
[02:39:17.378 --> 02:39:18.879]  And that's why he works for the Rockefellers.
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:28.983]  But lately, he's actually been fighting to cut the taxes, and secure the border, and kill TPP, and kill IMF, and kill World Bank, and kill globalism.
[02:39:29.623 --> 02:39:33.104]  So, I guess he might have just figured out which side's about to win, maybe?
[02:39:33.124 --> 02:39:34.945]  Because I've been on the phone with
[02:39:36.241 --> 02:39:42.584]  Well-known folks that have been part of Bilderberg and part of other big international organizations, and they say, look, the tide's out.
[02:39:43.084 --> 02:39:43.724]  Not Peter Thiel.
[02:39:43.764 --> 02:39:44.325]  He said that too.
[02:39:44.385 --> 02:39:44.925]  I've talked to him.
[02:39:45.225 --> 02:39:46.466]  But they said the same thing.
[02:39:46.686 --> 02:39:47.306]  The tide's out.
[02:39:47.686 --> 02:39:49.567]  Globalism was supposed to have a free market for everybody.
[02:39:49.627 --> 02:39:50.007]  It's not.
[02:39:50.347 --> 02:39:51.348]  It's crony capitalism.
[02:39:51.388 --> 02:39:51.988]  It didn't deliver.
[02:39:52.228 --> 02:39:57.370]  Just like the liberal Joseph Stiglitz, who won two Nobel Prizes, said on the show, you know, liberalism has become a fraud.
[02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:58.651]  Conservatism has become a fraud.
[02:39:58.931 --> 02:40:00.832]  The elite want to make people poor to control them.
[02:40:01.112 --> 02:40:02.272]  This is not real liberalism.
[02:40:02.312 --> 02:40:03.113]  We've got to stop this.
[02:40:04.735 --> 02:40:05.956]  So there's different schools of thought.
[02:40:05.996 --> 02:40:07.637]  There's fake liberals, there's fake conservatives.
[02:40:08.037 --> 02:40:09.838]  Then there's real liberals, and there's real conservatives.
[02:40:10.199 --> 02:40:13.461]  And I've talked to real liberals, and I've talked to real conservatives.
[02:40:14.401 --> 02:40:18.504]  And you know, you've heard John, you've heard Robert David Steele on the show.
[02:40:19.925 --> 02:40:20.525]  That's his name, right?
[02:40:20.545 --> 02:40:21.366]  The former CIA guy.
[02:40:21.446 --> 02:40:22.306]  I'm teleprompter free.
[02:40:22.567 --> 02:40:23.307]  We should get him back on.
[02:40:23.867 --> 02:40:25.849]  Talk about his meetings with Rothschilds and people.
[02:40:26.789 --> 02:40:38.738]  High levels that are like, no, no, they don't want to get rid of everybody, and they want to not go to Islam, and they want to go ahead and secure things, and they agree, they don't want world government, they think it's a bad idea, but then they've got the other side of their family that wants it.
[02:40:39.199 --> 02:40:55.712]  So, you know, the truth is, people are complex, and now that globalism has gotten so close, and it's here, and people really realize this is what Hitler wishes he was, a lot of people are going, you know what, we might not want to actually do this.
[02:40:58.712 --> 02:41:00.073]  Ally with radical Islam?
[02:41:00.953 --> 02:41:02.874]  They're telling feminist women put hijabs on?
[02:41:03.334 --> 02:41:10.817]  All these women are going, what the... I thought feminism's where I'm in charge and I take over and the men are like a subclass.
[02:41:12.118 --> 02:41:16.020]  Because high-level feminists know that it's about power and domination and taking control of the species.
[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:17.661]  It's not about empowering women or men.
[02:41:17.861 --> 02:41:20.022]  It's about being authoritarians under the name of women.
[02:41:20.942 --> 02:41:24.524]  Because men are so demoralized, dumbed down and uneducated and falling apart right now.
[02:41:26.164 --> 02:41:27.565]  But even the authoritarian women are like,
[02:41:30.265 --> 02:41:31.886]  Gonna bring in the Muslims and have them run stuff?
[02:41:31.947 --> 02:41:32.487]  I don't think so.
[02:41:33.588 --> 02:41:34.129]  I don't think so.
[02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:35.210]  No, we're not doing that.
[02:41:35.390 --> 02:41:36.831]  And that's how crazy this is.
[02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:40.194]  How crazy are your people that want to go along with the New World Order?
[02:41:40.875 --> 02:41:43.577]  All you liberals, all you... And the litmus test.
[02:41:44.618 --> 02:41:52.686]  Get crazier and crazier and crazier what you've got to accept, what you've got to go along with, what you've got to push.
[02:41:54.226 --> 02:42:14.000]  Till we have the Huffington Post and Comedy Central, and I've got all these articles and all these clips today that I haven't even gotten to, where they were celebrating Otto Warmbier, saying, how dare you, you white, arrogant, know-it-all, you, you, you, you, entitled frat boy.
[02:42:15.592 --> 02:42:29.674]  You know, you go over to North Korea, and you try to steal a newspaper off the wall as a souvenir, and now you're there begging, you know, you're an Alpha Sigma Sigma ass.
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:36.162]  Please, I've made the worst mistake of my life, please, but it wasn't good enough because North Korea has nothing.
[02:42:36.182 --> 02:42:37.402]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[02:42:37.742 --> 02:42:48.366]  North Korea only has torture and death and is a cult of Satanism and a cult of personal power of the state trampling and being trampled upon and a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[02:42:51.027 --> 02:42:54.068]  So of course, you're going to get people to the Huffington Post.
[02:42:55.287 --> 02:42:59.030]  You're going to get people for Comedy Central saying, let's hunt Republicans.
[02:42:59.811 --> 02:43:03.915]  Let's celebrate Otto Warmbier.
[02:43:03.955 --> 02:43:13.683]  Here's Larry Wilmore, the real total class act racist, spewing that, oh, look at this arrogant white person.
[02:43:13.943 --> 02:43:15.545]  He went there and thought he was above the law.
[02:43:18.797 --> 02:43:19.517]  Think about that.
[02:43:19.958 --> 02:43:20.738]  Yeah, go ahead and roll it.
[02:43:21.098 --> 02:43:25.701]  Tonight's story is about the North Korean government which recently captured one of America's most annoying exports.
[02:43:26.001 --> 02:43:26.762]  A frat bro.
[02:43:27.062 --> 02:43:32.065]  Otto Frederick Warmbier is a University of Virginia student now being detained by North Korea.
[02:43:32.085 --> 02:43:34.046]  Hold on one second.
[02:43:36.088 --> 02:43:37.469]  Can I hear that name again?
[02:43:37.489 --> 02:43:39.330]  Otto Frederick Warmbier.
[02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.551]  Hey, pause.
[02:43:41.698 --> 02:43:49.862]  Imagine if you made fun of some African's name, or an Asian's name, or somebody else's name, you'd be the biggest racist, the most evil guy.
[02:43:49.902 --> 02:43:59.768]  But see, you're another know-it-all, racist, globalist, New World Order, Soros, Nazi collaborator, empowered clown.
[02:44:01.325 --> 02:44:08.209]  Who can then put up the evil white male and make a joke about him in the clutches of the most psychotic killers on earth.
[02:44:08.529 --> 02:44:16.313]  And so after we're done with this, just type in North Korea labor camps and then click on the images of the torture and the death and the murder.
[02:44:16.333 --> 02:44:17.454]  We'll put it on screen for you.
[02:44:18.214 --> 02:44:26.437]  Where they admittedly hang people by their legs, rape women, kill babies, make the villagers eat their own babies, rats eat their eyeballs out.
[02:44:26.737 --> 02:44:30.859]  Their population's gone down, what, 10 million just during the last decade or so.
[02:44:30.879 --> 02:44:32.719]  There's about a million die a year.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:35.120]  The place is an absolute hellhole.
[02:44:39.482 --> 02:44:42.143]  Go to Google, type in North Korean prison camps.
[02:44:43.789 --> 02:44:46.411]  And then click images, because there's not a lot of photos.
[02:44:46.751 --> 02:44:49.133]  There's just the drawings of those that have escaped.
[02:44:49.193 --> 02:44:50.133]  This has been confirmed.
[02:44:50.434 --> 02:44:55.337]  There are some photos and things the North Koreans have put out themselves, and you are worked to death.
[02:44:56.258 --> 02:45:01.541]  But if somebody does something wrong in your family, like make a joke about the dear leader, they always need new people for it.
[02:45:01.902 --> 02:45:10.628]  They bring you there with your wife and children, then they rape them and kill them in front of you, then they work you to death, and they feed on the pain.
[02:45:11.482 --> 02:45:13.303]  In fact, I sent Nico some images this morning.
[02:45:13.944 --> 02:45:17.406]  If you just click images on Google, I want to show the full palette of images.
[02:45:17.766 --> 02:45:25.771]  There's this particular shot of a female guard looking down from the corner of her eye through the fence at someone taking a photo.
[02:45:26.271 --> 02:45:31.315]  And you look at the power trip, at the evil, at a person drunk on torturing people.
[02:45:31.815 --> 02:45:37.498]  She may be near starving to death herself, but she has that same satanic look of enjoyment.
[02:45:37.539 --> 02:45:37.959]  There it is.
[02:45:39.315 --> 02:45:51.944]  Now, let's cut to a trendy, in the lap of luxury, in one of the most wealthy countries in the world, where our poor live like kings, and then they're gonna make fun of somebody just saying, oh, they're a white guy wearing a sports jacket.
[02:45:52.124 --> 02:45:55.527]  Now, you can be a black guy wearing a sports jacket.
[02:45:56.681 --> 02:46:01.244]  Let's start at the beginning, and that's okay, but a white guy is wearing a sports jacket.
[02:46:01.744 --> 02:46:20.476]  It's another uppity cracker-ass that a black racist like you can run your mouth about, while the majority of the victims of North Korea are Asians, and their own people murdered by the tens of millions by the most degenerate scum on earth that leftists make jokes about, and that leftists travel there to make jokes about.
[02:46:20.996 --> 02:46:26.819]  And that major publications make jokes about, well, you promote Venezuela that's now descending into the same type of deal.
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:29.941]  It always ends in work camps.
[02:46:30.881 --> 02:46:32.642]  It always ends in forced labor.
[02:46:32.962 --> 02:46:34.443]  It always ends on hell on earth.
[02:46:34.503 --> 02:46:35.263]  But you don't care.
[02:46:37.224 --> 02:46:41.046]  So let's go ahead here, ladies and gentlemen, and let's roll.
[02:46:41.066 --> 02:46:44.708]  Of course, that's just Army cadets in that forced labor photo.
[02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:47.870]  That's just young Army cadets near starvation.
[02:46:48.570 --> 02:46:49.770]  Let's put that photo back on screen.
[02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:50.591]  That's not forced labor.
[02:46:51.971 --> 02:46:55.752]  That's just army cadets looking like they're concentration camp victims out there.
[02:46:55.772 --> 02:47:02.714]  And the whole population is suppressed, except for one-tenth of one percent that waddles around and worships Kim Jong-un.
[02:47:05.175 --> 02:47:06.716]  And of course they can't produce enough food.
[02:47:06.996 --> 02:47:11.997]  Meanwhile, South Korea is the biggest producer of electronics, technology, you name it.
[02:47:12.377 --> 02:47:14.278]  Overproduces food, you name it.
[02:47:16.939 --> 02:47:17.899]  But see, they have free market.
[02:47:17.919 --> 02:47:18.619]  They're not even perfect.
[02:47:19.519 --> 02:47:20.920]  Total hell on earth.
[02:47:23.046 --> 02:47:23.766]  But they don't care.
[02:47:23.786 --> 02:47:26.347]  Those are just citizens of North Korea.
[02:47:26.367 --> 02:47:30.588]  Again, go through some more of the torture photos while this guy talks.
[02:47:30.628 --> 02:47:40.011]  But let's go ahead and roll this dirtbag, Larry Wilmore, who's praying, praying that America could be more like North Korea.
[02:47:40.071 --> 02:47:40.371]  Here it is.
[02:47:41.573 --> 02:47:46.496]  No, tonight's story is about the North Korean government which recently captured one of America's most annoying exports.
[02:47:46.796 --> 02:47:47.556]  A frat bro.
[02:47:47.856 --> 02:47:52.859]  Otto Frederick Warmbier is a University of Virginia student now being detained by North Korea.
[02:47:52.879 --> 02:47:54.820]  Hold on one second.
[02:47:56.401 --> 02:47:57.021]  He's dead now, bro.
[02:47:57.041 --> 02:47:58.241]  Can I hear that name again?
[02:47:58.261 --> 02:48:00.102]  Otto Frederick Warmbier.
[02:48:00.122 --> 02:48:02.384]  Yeah, bro, that guy's dead now.
[02:48:02.984 --> 02:48:04.905]  Otto Frederick Warmbier?
[02:48:06.348 --> 02:48:07.388]  Okay, so what'd he do wrong?
[02:48:07.769 --> 02:48:12.030]  He's accused of trying to steal a North Korean political banner from his hotel.
[02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:15.292]  Okay, listen up, frat boy.
[02:48:15.972 --> 02:48:18.873]  Uh, this isn't like the time you stole SIGEP's goat.
[02:48:20.694 --> 02:48:22.155]  This is North Korea.
[02:48:22.175 --> 02:48:27.057]  I don't know, maybe this student is some sophisticated, undercover mastermind.
[02:48:27.137 --> 02:48:27.817]  Please!
[02:48:28.537 --> 02:48:31.379]  I've made the worst mistake of my life!
[02:48:33.139 --> 02:48:34.080]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:48:35.154 --> 02:48:36.296]  Oh, they write the children.
[02:48:36.316 --> 02:48:38.398]  I beg you for your forgiveness.
[02:48:38.438 --> 02:48:42.103]  Please think of my family.
[02:48:51.957 --> 02:48:53.338]  That groveling wasn't enough, you're dead.
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:12.100]  That's right.
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:12.701]  Let's back it up.
[02:49:12.761 --> 02:49:13.321]  That's right.
[02:49:13.841 --> 02:49:14.922]  Trump's a dictator.
[02:49:15.002 --> 02:49:24.789]  He's a megalomaniac because he's standing up to North Korea and it's Obama and Hillary and the Clintons that gave him the nukes, gave him the reactors, empowered him, his father, all of it.
[02:49:24.949 --> 02:49:26.110]  But you don't care about history.
[02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:32.934]  You want to equate North Korea with Donald Trump when he's equated with globalist filth like you.
[02:49:33.154 --> 02:49:34.115]  Let's go back to this filth.
[02:49:34.895 --> 02:49:35.576]  And you'll live in one.
[02:49:37.065 --> 02:49:38.006]  It's coming, you guys.
[02:49:38.026 --> 02:49:39.306]  You know that s*** is coming.
[02:49:39.706 --> 02:49:40.587]  You know it's coming.
[02:49:40.847 --> 02:49:41.688]  Make America great.
[02:49:41.768 --> 02:49:42.368]  It's catchy.
[02:49:44.889 --> 02:49:45.710]  I'm gonna cry.
[02:49:45.730 --> 02:49:48.231]  No, you're another arrogant person.
[02:49:48.251 --> 02:49:49.932]  Let's talk with some of his fraternity brothers.
[02:49:49.952 --> 02:49:51.593]  So please welcome Preston and Hans.
[02:49:53.154 --> 02:49:53.914]  Preston and Hans.
[02:49:53.954 --> 02:49:54.955]  Let's make fun of white people.
[02:49:55.375 --> 02:49:59.637]  Let's put some black guys up there and have them act like Heckel and Jekyll.
[02:49:59.657 --> 02:50:00.698]  That'd be racist.
[02:50:00.758 --> 02:50:03.199]  And he commits crimes and gets away with them all the time.
[02:50:03.219 --> 02:50:04.760]  He's the ultimate frat brass.
[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:05.480]  Right, baby?
[02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:06.161]  We'll pause again.
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:12.423]  Just like they claimed the lacrosse team raped a black stripper.
[02:50:12.923 --> 02:50:15.625]  See, they weren't racist, they wanted to have a black stripper.
[02:50:17.046 --> 02:50:21.769]  And they didn't do anything to her, and it was all made up, but the media manufactured it and has now lost lawsuits over it.
[02:50:22.970 --> 02:50:29.754]  Because that's the image everybody wants, that white people and black people are all going to kill each other, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:50:30.475 --> 02:50:32.976]  So everybody's too scared to even associate with each other.
[02:50:33.157 --> 02:50:35.078]  Let's go out to break with more of this racist garbage.
[02:50:38.917 --> 02:50:41.338]  That's the first thing you said that's made sense.
[02:50:41.398 --> 02:50:42.278]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:45.980]  The Nightly Show.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.441]  Hey, but don't worry.
[02:50:47.501 --> 02:50:48.281]  He's dead now.
[02:50:48.361 --> 02:50:52.183]  He got beaten to death for a year and a half, and then he died in a coma.
[02:50:52.523 --> 02:50:54.604]  You're probably mad he got back to his mama first.
[02:50:54.644 --> 02:50:57.225]  So you go ahead and make your filthy, evil jokes.
[02:50:57.845 --> 02:51:01.787]  You filthy, evil, anti-human, scum, leftist crap head.
[02:51:04.428 --> 02:51:06.609]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[02:51:10.046 --> 02:51:12.027]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[02:51:12.527 --> 02:51:16.228]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:51:16.949 --> 02:51:30.254]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:51:30.694 --> 02:51:35.836]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:51:36.597 --> 02:51:40.455]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate.
[02:51:41.736 --> 02:51:47.817]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:51:48.097 --> 02:51:50.918]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:51:51.838 --> 02:52:06.780]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:52:07.121 --> 02:52:09.361]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:52:10.689 --> 02:52:23.018]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:23.859 --> 02:52:32.506]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:52:33.066 --> 02:52:38.210]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[02:52:38.730 --> 02:52:42.395]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:52:42.876 --> 02:52:43.857]  It's all there.
[02:52:44.037 --> 02:52:48.063]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[02:52:48.523 --> 02:52:50.666]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[02:52:51.147 --> 02:52:51.948]  Be-A-Way spray.
[02:52:52.248 --> 02:52:54.251]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:52:54.972 --> 02:52:58.534]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:52:58.915 --> 02:53:01.176]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:53:01.476 --> 02:53:02.917]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:53:03.258 --> 02:53:04.679]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:53:05.139 --> 02:53:05.819]  High quality.
[02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:08.021]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:53:08.321 --> 02:53:09.061]  Totally natural.
[02:53:09.342 --> 02:53:09.842]  Works great.
[02:53:10.763 --> 02:53:11.283]  SPF 30.
[02:53:11.823 --> 02:53:12.984]  Face and body lotion.
[02:53:13.004 --> 02:53:13.604]  Sunscreen.
[02:53:14.005 --> 02:53:14.525]  Unscented.
[02:53:15.085 --> 02:53:16.026]  This is exciting.
[02:53:16.126 --> 02:53:19.849]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:22.290]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:53:22.310 --> 02:53:23.471]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:53:25.432 --> 02:53:26.613]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[02:53:27.393 --> 02:53:31.315]  And then, additionally, you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[02:53:31.335 --> 02:53:31.835]  25% off that.
[02:53:32.315 --> 02:53:34.356]  Because I want you to try these products.
[02:53:34.496 --> 02:53:35.716]  I want you to love these products.
[02:53:36.076 --> 02:53:46.701]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:53:47.561 --> 02:53:55.183]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future, to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:53:55.463 --> 02:54:00.104]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:54:04.665 --> 02:54:05.766]  Alex Jones back live.
[02:54:05.786 --> 02:54:07.546]  Couple more segments and Paul Watson's taking over.
[02:54:07.926 --> 02:54:11.867]  Cynthia, James, Brandon, Travis, I'll get to your calls before Watson takes over.
[02:54:12.127 --> 02:54:14.148]  He's always wound up and ready to go and on target.
[02:54:16.035 --> 02:54:18.896]  The globalists hope that you will not fund InfoWars.
[02:54:18.916 --> 02:54:24.999]  They openly talk about wanting to shut down economies so that there can't be independent, Americana, nationalistic press.
[02:54:26.219 --> 02:54:33.142]  We are brash, we are truthful, we are in their face, and we self-fund about 70% of our operation direct-selling products to you.
[02:54:33.583 --> 02:54:36.484]  That's how we're able to continue on when other media is imploding.
[02:54:37.284 --> 02:54:40.606]  We had 20-plus million views attacking her in the last week or so.
[02:54:41.186 --> 02:54:43.527]  Megyn Kelly, she had 3.5 million views on her show.
[02:54:44.477 --> 02:54:45.598]  They are the illusion.
[02:54:45.698 --> 02:54:46.979]  They are the emperor's new clothes.
[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:53.345]  But at this critical time, they're launching their final attack, bureaucratically, with boycotts and manipulations.
[02:54:54.466 --> 02:54:56.668]  That's why we make it easy to support the transmission.
[02:54:57.469 --> 02:55:05.957]  We're running 30 to 40 percent off all the storable foods, big discounts on water filtration systems, free shipping store-wide at InfoWareStore.com, part of the summer

[02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.350]  That's...
[02:55:25.362 --> 02:55:25.943]  The brand name.
[02:55:26.143 --> 02:55:29.566]  It's the entire line of MyPatriot at the lowest price you'll find anywhere.
[02:55:30.167 --> 02:55:31.688]  Emrix Essentials Outdoor Pack.

[02:55:35.852 --> 02:55:40.377]  That is a loss leader when you get the additional percentages off with Autoship.
[02:55:40.717 --> 02:55:42.479]  Living Defense, Parasite Cleanse is amazing.
[02:55:42.779 --> 02:55:44.401]  It's close to selling out, but I'm still doing.
[02:55:45.897 --> 02:55:46.718]  20% off on it.
[02:55:46.738 --> 02:55:49.001]  This is one of the biggest sales we've done in a long time.
[02:55:49.021 --> 02:55:51.664]  We've got a lot of different items, but this is a wide sale.
[02:55:52.004 --> 02:55:58.631]  Some of these items are at the lowest price ever, like the Emmerich's Essentials Outdoor Pack at 40% off.
[02:55:59.072 --> 02:56:01.755]  You can also call toll free and ask about these specials and others.

[02:56:07.401 --> 02:56:08.302]  We've had it for 20 years.
[02:56:08.382 --> 02:56:10.305]  It'll also take your orders here in Austin, Texas.
[02:56:10.746 --> 02:56:14.350]  It's 800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:56:14.370 --> 02:56:16.032]  The toll-free number to order is triple eight.

[02:56:42.865 --> 02:56:45.827]  It's a silver bullet, colloidal silver in it.
[02:56:46.448 --> 02:56:47.488]  A lot of game changers.
[02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:49.830]  So thank you all for making the transmission possible.
[02:56:50.050 --> 02:56:56.294]  But just like we game change politically and are very aggressive and effective, our products are awesome and effective as well.
[02:56:56.314 --> 02:56:57.815]  So again, you made InfoWars.
[02:56:58.135 --> 02:57:00.677]  I want to salute you and thank you for everything you've done.
[02:57:01.477 --> 02:57:05.079]  We have a discount with Organic Mouthwash 10 to 1 Concentrate with Super Blue.
[02:57:05.519 --> 02:57:06.920]  That's 33% off right now.
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:09.461]  There's no reviews of that combo because it's brand new.
[02:57:10.001 --> 02:57:11.882]  Okay, let's go to Cynthia.
[02:57:12.243 --> 02:57:13.183]  Cynthia, thanks for holding.
[02:57:13.203 --> 02:57:14.184]  You're on the air from Florida.
[02:57:16.865 --> 02:57:17.445]  Hello, Cynthia.
[02:57:18.586 --> 02:57:19.546]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:57:19.766 --> 02:57:20.387]  I'm good, thank you.
[02:57:20.407 --> 02:57:20.667]  Go ahead.
[02:57:21.656 --> 02:57:23.097]  Oh, I just want to say you guys are awesome.
[02:57:23.217 --> 02:57:23.858]  You guys are amazing.
[02:57:23.938 --> 02:57:24.318]  You are.
[02:57:24.398 --> 02:57:25.359]  I watch you every day.
[02:57:25.659 --> 02:57:26.279]  I'm a veteran.
[02:57:26.759 --> 02:57:29.361]  Um, I just, uh, I just have a little something.
[02:57:29.421 --> 02:57:37.787]  I think that, you know, I know you guys have already touched down on the whole, uh, PedoGate thing and, uh, all these people are tripping because they're all satanic and they're all in different cults.
[02:57:37.847 --> 02:57:41.449]  It seems like this, like this weird Harry Potter alternate universe is going on.
[02:57:41.489 --> 02:57:51.076]  Like there's like a good Illuminati and a bad Illuminati and they all are both aware of each other, but like us muggles kind of like aren't supposed to know what's going on behind the scenes.
[02:57:51.816 --> 02:57:57.579]  Um, and I know a lot of these Luciferians have this trio that they have to tell us what they're doing.
[02:57:57.599 --> 02:57:59.260]  So I think... That's right.
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.841]  Metaphysically, the vampire has to ask permission to come in.
[02:58:01.881 --> 02:58:04.642]  I'm gonna hold you over because what you're saying is so important.
[02:58:04.662 --> 02:58:05.182]  Stay right there.
[02:58:05.443 --> 02:58:12.006]  I'm gonna come right back to you in 70 seconds, Cynthia, then James, then Brandon, then Travis, and then Noreen if I have time, and then Paul Watson's taking over.
[02:58:12.926 --> 02:58:14.407]  But what you said is so key here.
[02:58:14.467 --> 02:58:15.567]  And listen to me carefully, folks.
[02:58:15.607 --> 02:58:16.828]  What she just said is everything.
[02:58:17.697 --> 02:58:22.380]  There's all these different delusions of grandeur and that's what evil is, is like mental illness.
[02:58:22.761 --> 02:58:27.604]  It's systems of thought that make you artificially mentally ill and that lower your spiritual defenses.
[02:58:27.944 --> 02:58:39.052]  And more and more I realize as we see mental illness and insanity and people breaking down, intensifying around us, which they admit is happening, it's because this world's a lie and people have bought into it and they're going crazy.
[02:58:39.573 --> 02:58:43.716]  And a lot of people, like Agent Smith, are just becoming possessed by the spirit of this world.
[02:58:44.776 --> 02:58:45.317]  And that's it.
[02:58:45.617 --> 02:58:46.738]  They serve the system.
[02:58:47.098 --> 02:58:48.118]  They believe they're part of it.
[02:58:48.599 --> 02:58:52.501]  They see their system that's cancer and trouble, so they're trying to overthrow the cure.
[02:58:54.031 --> 02:59:01.136]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:59:01.516 --> 02:59:14.725]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:15.666 --> 02:59:26.890]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:27.551 --> 02:59:33.513]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:59:34.273 --> 02:59:42.675]  Secure your biome defense in ultra-strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:59:43.276 --> 02:59:51.558]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:59:56.079 --> 03:00:01.981]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.996 --> 03:00:31.559]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[03:00:32.919 --> 03:00:34.959]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:39.740]  Alright, Cynthia was on speakerphone, but I got her off of us so we can hear her clearer.
[03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:41.661]  She was saying some really important stuff.
[03:00:42.041 --> 03:00:43.861]  So start over and repeat what you were saying, Cynthia.
[03:00:44.721 --> 03:00:52.628]  So what I'm saying is that, you know, I think this weird Harry Potter alternate universe is going on that, you know, the good faction knows about the bad faction.
[03:00:52.648 --> 03:00:53.909]  They can't bust each other out.
[03:00:54.309 --> 03:01:08.482]  They can tell us what's really going on, but they're behind the scenes trying to do what they can to, you know, secure America's freedom, secure the world's freedom, you know, because the Satanic cult has been around for an ancient, ancient time.
[03:01:09.182 --> 03:01:12.484]  You know, it's been around, I mean, even pre-flood, they're saying now, pre-flood.
[03:01:12.945 --> 03:01:13.365]  Who knows?
[03:01:13.405 --> 03:01:15.647]  This virus has been around for a very, very long time.
[03:01:16.627 --> 03:01:24.152]  And what's going on is that you're hearing and feeling the dying throes of an animal that's just, like, gasping for its last breath.
[03:01:24.192 --> 03:01:29.236]  And I bet you this dude, the guy, the shooter that shot Scalise, he probably was a pedo.
[03:01:29.476 --> 03:01:35.360]  I'm not trying to, like, put anything out there, but, you know, all these guys... Well, he sure looked like one.
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:38.102]  He sure looked like a Dennis Hastert clone.
[03:01:43.001 --> 03:01:44.402]  Keep going.
[03:01:45.784 --> 03:01:49.047]  You know, and it just seems like all these people have the same.
[03:01:49.067 --> 03:01:51.069]  I've been in abusive relationships.
[03:01:51.129 --> 03:02:04.842]  I've had abusive situations in my life and all these people have the same the same trauma, you know, and what they want to push that trauma on to the general public because they have to tell their Luciferian code is they have to tell us what they're doing to us.
[03:02:05.502 --> 03:02:06.763]  And so, that's what they're doing.
[03:02:07.304 --> 03:02:11.947]  And we have to pay attention to the videos that they push out.
[03:02:11.967 --> 03:02:13.889]  We have to pay attention to the publishing companies.
[03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:21.394]  We have to pay attention to the newspapers, the people that are funding these people.
[03:02:21.755 --> 03:02:23.356]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:02:23.396 --> 03:02:34.865]  It's not that I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes and perfect myself, but when it comes to these types like Dennis Hastert, and it looks like this clone of him, now that you make the point that went and attacked this Bernie Sanders supporter,
[03:02:36.334 --> 03:02:37.735]  It really is a spiritual thing.
[03:02:38.115 --> 03:02:43.638]  And I know people that want to destroy things and overthrow things and screw things up because that's their nature.
[03:02:44.018 --> 03:02:45.359]  And if you let them in, they do it.
[03:02:45.679 --> 03:02:46.480]  They can't help it.
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:51.122]  They get thrilled by doing bad, by being dishonorable.
[03:02:51.602 --> 03:02:57.306]  And it seems like there's so much dishonor and so much betrayal, people would rather betray someone than even be successful.
[03:02:57.326 --> 03:02:57.826]  It's very sad.
[03:02:59.890 --> 03:03:07.025]  Yeah, they, you know, Michael Tesarin did say, he said, you know, it's the duty of the
[03:03:08.627 --> 03:03:09.047]  Thank you so much.
[03:03:30.635 --> 03:03:31.235]  What boundaries?
[03:03:31.275 --> 03:03:32.396]  And that's it, exactly.
[03:03:32.416 --> 03:03:34.577]  And then they tell us that we're stopping free will.
[03:03:34.657 --> 03:03:46.002]  No, they're trying to grab kids and political brainwash and sexually brainwash them early to control their destiny and screw them up so they never develop into being the powerful, sentient beings they would have been.
[03:03:46.262 --> 03:03:49.504]  This is totally satanic and their whole religion is about hurting children.
[03:03:49.744 --> 03:03:52.465]  And you can call them what you want, but they are literally scum.
[03:03:52.505 --> 03:03:54.466]  They're weak, they're twisted, they're ugly.
[03:03:55.461 --> 03:03:56.022]  They're hateful.
[03:03:56.382 --> 03:03:57.503]  That's why they sow deceit.
[03:03:57.623 --> 03:03:58.644]  It's why they sow war.
[03:03:59.445 --> 03:04:00.687]  It's why they sow hatred.
[03:04:01.608 --> 03:04:03.169]  And they're total enemies of humanity.
[03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.710]  All of them.
[03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.551]  All of them.
[03:04:04.591 --> 03:04:05.452]  Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:06.232 --> 03:04:07.053]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:07.594 --> 03:04:08.395]  Barack Obama.
[03:04:09.614 --> 03:04:15.398]  All of them are just ravenous, hateful creatures that want to screw up society as much as possible.
[03:04:15.418 --> 03:04:17.960]  Then you've got the Republican leadership, just as bad or worse.
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:24.825]  They are the literal scum of the earth, like Dennis Hastert, procuring children for Congress for decades before they made him a congressman.
[03:04:25.105 --> 03:04:30.769]  Then they made him the Speaker of the House because he was a big, fat pedophile and part of their pedophile cult.
[03:04:31.450 --> 03:04:32.310]  God bless you, Cynthia.
[03:04:32.330 --> 03:04:32.791]  Great points.
[03:04:34.451 --> 03:04:45.635]  What it comes down to, the globalists love killing children, they love enslaving women, they love death, they love radical Islam, because it kills children, it has sex slavery, it legalizes pedophilia.
[03:04:46.035 --> 03:04:47.035]  I'm sorry, that's who they are.
[03:04:47.715 --> 03:05:00.719]  And they are just ravenous scum that thought they had full control, and we're about to have a big political purge of Christians in America, and it got thrown back in their face, so now they're trying to reorganize and poison and destroy as fast as they can.
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:02.180]  We'll be back with Paul Watson.
[03:05:03.570 --> 03:05:05.972]  It looks like the Summer of Rage has claimed another victim.
[03:05:06.352 --> 03:05:07.933]  Report on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:08.253 --> 03:05:11.236]  Armenian gang stabs prominent Trump activist.
[03:05:11.256 --> 03:05:18.261]  27-year-old Tony Freeman was stabbed by a gang of Armenians who noticed his pro-Trump bumper sticker on his car after they rammed his vehicle.
[03:05:18.621 --> 03:05:22.584]  After the ramming, the gang members noticed his Gadsden flag and American flag bumper stickers.
[03:05:22.924 --> 03:05:24.866]  And proceeded to stab him nine times.
[03:05:25.387 --> 03:05:29.752]  Mr. Freeman was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he remains in critical condition.
[03:05:30.092 --> 03:05:33.476]  And you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund at WeSearcher.
[03:05:33.796 --> 03:05:43.487]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack as racially motivated, but we've seen the many statements from Tim Cain calling for fights in the streets, to Loretta Leitch calling for marching, blood, and death in the streets.
[03:05:44.088 --> 03:05:54.577]  Democratic leaders across the country, from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton to Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, are all calling for people to rise up and resist this summer, during the Summer of Rage.
[03:05:55.057 --> 03:05:56.158]  Who will be the next victim?
[03:05:56.439 --> 03:05:57.860]  Watch your back, or it may be you.
[03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:01.523]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:08:05.473 --> 03:08:10.276]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:12.377 --> 03:08:20.623]  Well, Paul Watson has talked about maybe having to leave the UK soon to the United States or some other place because they're trying to send the police after him.
[03:08:20.643 --> 03:08:24.525]  They're saying arrest him for criticizing orthodox Islam, murdering people.
[03:08:24.865 --> 03:08:30.409]  We've seen more stabbings in England, more car attacks, more attacks today in Paris, France.
[03:08:31.784 --> 03:08:40.270]  Now I see Paul in news articles, they're saying maybe it's Paul Watson's fault that guy a few days ago ran his car into somebody who was supposedly a right winger.
[03:08:40.310 --> 03:08:44.953]  Paul was the first person to decry it and previously say we don't want violence.
[03:08:45.393 --> 03:08:52.598]  But the left saying whites are to blame, mainly white people are saying that, and that Christians are to blame, and that we have to have a rampaging war.
[03:08:52.878 --> 03:08:54.920]  But when Muslims blow up twenty-something little girls,
[03:08:55.771 --> 03:09:02.516]  At the Ariana Grande concert, well then it's okay, because we need to all just come together and submit to Islam.
[03:09:02.857 --> 03:09:12.985]  And now the Prime Minister of England has come out and said, we must battle Islamophobia, and has gotten all hysterical over this one person that supposedly got run over.
[03:09:13.225 --> 03:09:22.733]  The whole thing sounds staged to me, because you've got them saying a man's already sick on the ground with a crowd all around him, and then a truck hits that, and then that's the man that dies.
[03:09:23.697 --> 03:09:27.360]  I mean, we know they admittedly put the little dead baby there on the beach for the photos of it.
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:31.723]  But the photo, if you remember that, to pull heart strings.
[03:09:31.863 --> 03:09:35.726]  I'm not saying the baby didn't die actually crossing, or that Europe didn't kill the baby.
[03:09:36.086 --> 03:09:38.168]  Advertising, come to Europe, everything's for free.
[03:09:38.568 --> 03:09:41.690]  So their parents, you know, threw the baby into a boat and sent him out into the Mediterranean.
[03:09:41.971 --> 03:09:44.753]  But the point is, these folks are famous for staging things.
[03:09:45.193 --> 03:09:45.794]  So, Paul?
[03:09:46.494 --> 03:09:48.695]  I guess you got no friends because people read the papers.
[03:09:48.755 --> 03:09:50.036]  They can't be seen with you.
[03:09:50.616 --> 03:09:55.578]  But you know, in an age of media, mainstream media being so discredited, that's the great badge of honor.
[03:09:55.939 --> 03:09:57.179]  I mean, look at Megyn Kelly.
[03:09:58.020 --> 03:10:02.722]  The lowest ratings ever recorded for Dateline NBC, 3.5 million.
[03:10:03.262 --> 03:10:04.263]  And it gets worse, Paul.
[03:10:05.043 --> 03:10:05.963]  It gets worse, Paul.
[03:10:06.283 --> 03:10:09.545]  The worst ratings of the day on broadcast TV.
[03:10:09.885 --> 03:10:13.666]  People firmly rejecting the most hyped-up TV show of two weeks.
[03:10:13.886 --> 03:10:18.248]  Now, some would say it's a rejection of Pumpkinhead or the Wet Walrus, as I'm known, in the piece.
[03:10:18.748 --> 03:10:18.988]  No!
[03:10:19.368 --> 03:10:22.249]  We had 20-plus million views on our videos that week about it.
[03:10:22.489 --> 03:10:25.970]  We had record traffic that we've ever had in the month of June.
[03:10:26.471 --> 03:10:27.351]  Basically double it!
[03:10:27.691 --> 03:10:29.852]  There were even news articles showing we had double the traffic.
[03:10:29.872 --> 03:10:41.719]  So, we got record listeners, 20 plus million extra views, totally viral, thousands and thousands of news articles a day about us, and she got nothing except a tape showing she lied to me.
[03:10:41.959 --> 03:10:42.519]  Paul Watson.
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:49.162]  No, it's incredibly hilarious, Alex, to see the whining and the butthurt in the mainstream media.
[03:10:49.663 --> 03:10:51.724]  Today you've got Jim Acosta of CNN.
[03:10:51.764 --> 03:10:53.765]  Of course, he's had several spats with Trump.
[03:10:54.420 --> 03:10:56.793]  You remember the one where Trump called CNN fake news?
[03:10:56.833 --> 03:10:57.798]  That was Jim Acosta.
[03:10:58.467 --> 03:11:01.749]  This is an activist posing as a neutral journalist.
[03:11:01.789 --> 03:11:06.531]  He's out again on television whining, and I'm going to do an article about it.
[03:11:06.891 --> 03:11:09.913]  He basically said, oh, this is the new normal.
[03:11:10.093 --> 03:11:14.955]  Trump gets one question from the mainstream media and another from a conservative outlet.
[03:11:15.356 --> 03:11:16.696]  How terrible is that?
[03:11:17.236 --> 03:11:18.277]  This is the new normal.
[03:11:18.317 --> 03:11:19.658]  He's literally having a temper tantrum.
[03:11:19.678 --> 03:11:24.940]  But isn't he the guy that got caught lying saying Trump didn't visit the shot congressman last week?
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:25.741]  Yeah, same guy.
[03:11:25.861 --> 03:11:28.022]  I mean, doesn't he get caught like every time lying?
[03:11:29.304 --> 03:11:35.347]  He's an activist posing as an impartial journalist and every time he goes on TV and whines about it.
[03:11:35.727 --> 03:11:45.031]  God forbid Trump should take an equal amount of questions from so-called friendly media outlets as the ones that absolutely hate him and want to destroy him on a daily basis.
[03:11:45.091 --> 03:11:47.392]  God forbid he should have some kind of balance.
[03:11:47.872 --> 03:11:48.993]  That's the new normal.
[03:11:49.113 --> 03:11:49.793]  That's terrible.
[03:11:49.833 --> 03:11:51.754]  He gets up and whines about it on CNN.
[03:11:52.154 --> 03:11:56.456]  And again, that was the same guy who lied and said that Trump didn't visit Scalise.
[03:11:57.034 --> 03:11:58.296]  Failed to retract it.
[03:11:58.656 --> 03:12:03.061]  Blamed it on some other reporter when he originally claimed it was from a White House source.
[03:12:03.362 --> 03:12:04.443]  Complete liar.
[03:12:04.803 --> 03:12:06.606]  Complete phony fake news.
[03:12:06.986 --> 03:12:09.068]  Up on TV again whining about Trump.
[03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:10.090]  He's an activist.
[03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:11.171]  He's not a journalist.
[03:12:12.172 --> 03:12:13.754]  I want to take a few calls and let you take over.
[03:12:13.774 --> 03:12:15.376]  You're also going to be hosting 4th Hour tomorrow.
[03:12:15.716 --> 03:12:15.877]  Paul.
[03:12:17.042 --> 03:12:17.883]  Who's a bigger liar?
[03:12:18.224 --> 03:12:20.847]  Who's the biggest in European, US, or Australian?
[03:12:21.248 --> 03:12:24.392]  In Western media, who is the biggest liar of them all?
[03:12:24.432 --> 03:12:25.093]  Brian Williams?
[03:12:25.493 --> 03:12:26.214]  Connie Chung?
[03:12:27.235 --> 03:12:28.077]  Megan Kelly?
[03:12:29.098 --> 03:12:34.044]  Or is it Katie Couric that famously edited gun owners to make them sound like morons?
[03:12:35.728 --> 03:12:37.469]  They lie on an industrial scale.
[03:12:37.729 --> 03:12:39.629]  I mean, our lies, we don't even lie.
[03:12:39.669 --> 03:12:41.430]  I mean, we could get something wrong.
[03:12:41.530 --> 03:12:43.931]  I mean, I write like 900 articles a year.
[03:12:43.971 --> 03:12:45.591]  Yeah, occasionally I'm going to get something wrong.
[03:12:45.671 --> 03:12:47.892]  And they celebrate the two or three you got wrong.
[03:12:48.092 --> 03:12:50.653]  They have whole articles about, here's how Paul's full of crap.
[03:12:50.973 --> 03:12:52.093]  Going back to 2004 or whatever.
[03:12:54.518 --> 03:12:58.199]  The definition of fake news is deliberately lying, knowing that you're lying.
[03:12:58.319 --> 03:13:00.819]  That's the very definition of the mainstream media.
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:07.241]  You know, quoting curveball, drunken, known disinfo outlets for the Iraqi WMD propaganda.
[03:13:07.261 --> 03:13:12.782]  The difference is their lies, their mistakes, are mechanised and industrial.
[03:13:12.842 --> 03:13:15.763]  They start wars that lead to deaths of millions of people.
[03:13:16.163 --> 03:13:21.004]  So for those kind of individuals to lecture us about fake news is pretty rich, isn't it?
[03:13:21.568 --> 03:13:29.298]  Oh, and by the way, Alex, before you get to those callers, new study, you probably covered this earlier, but remember they bashed Trump over and over again.
[03:13:29.799 --> 03:13:34.825]  Oh, he cited an InfoWars story saying that 3 million illegals may have voted.
[03:13:35.146 --> 03:13:36.928]  How debunked, how discredited is that?
[03:13:36.948 --> 03:13:37.829]  That's all being proven now!
[03:13:38.817 --> 03:13:40.859]  Yeah, we underestimated it.
[03:13:40.879 --> 03:13:47.023]  5.7 million of them voted in 2008, so who knows what it was in 2016.
[03:13:47.924 --> 03:13:52.748]  Hillary won the popular vote by about 2.8 million, so you take that away, Trump was right.
[03:13:52.768 --> 03:13:53.748]  Wow, that just broke.
[03:13:53.768 --> 03:13:54.909]  We gotta get this on Drudge.
[03:13:54.949 --> 03:14:04.397]  I mean, we were going after Pew Research, Fox Business, Associated Press, George Washington, Mason University, I mean, I'm going from memory here,
[03:14:05.077 --> 03:14:14.161]  There were like 50 studies saying between 2 and 4 million were confirmed to have voted who were dead off the rolls.
[03:14:14.542 --> 03:14:18.324]  Then there was something like 3.2 million illegals that were on the rolls.
[03:14:18.584 --> 03:14:21.305]  You added it all together it was like 9 million or something.
[03:14:21.545 --> 03:14:27.288]  We went with some conservative number of 3 million and they said we were liars and as you said it's now come out it's much bigger.
[03:14:28.677 --> 03:14:30.498]  Yeah, and the data was already out there.
[03:14:30.558 --> 03:14:38.863]  It's just these bias organisations took it and then came out with a bizarre assertion that no illegals whatsoever voted in the election.
[03:14:39.123 --> 03:14:44.747]  You had independent experts look at it and found that, no, it's anything up to 5.7 million.
[03:14:45.087 --> 03:14:48.929]  Of course, you've got Vice President Pence doing an investigation of that right now.
[03:14:49.330 --> 03:14:51.231]  So we're going to find out the exact number.
[03:14:51.291 --> 03:14:54.353]  But according to this, it looks like we underestimated it.
[03:14:56.014 --> 03:14:59.157]  Let me break down for folks what's unfolding and take a few of these calls.
[03:14:59.197 --> 03:15:00.418]  But this is something I've been meaning to say.
[03:15:00.738 --> 03:15:02.460]  I want to explain how this fake news stuff works.
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:09.566]  They know they can't say Pew Research and the Washington Times and all these other groups are totally fake, okay?
[03:15:10.307 --> 03:15:12.048]  People know they've got pretty good track records.
[03:15:12.128 --> 03:15:18.274]  So, they demonize Infowars, they demonize Trump, they demonize Breitbart and say we're fake.
[03:15:19.014 --> 03:15:23.575]  Knowing we're reporting on all the research papers, they then say that we totally made it up.
[03:15:23.895 --> 03:15:39.780]  So we've been chosen to be labeled as fake, so that then when we report on everything as news agencies, they can then report thousands of things are fake that aren't, without getting sued by major newspapers that we're actually quoting, or Pew Research, or Gallup, or whatever.
[03:15:39.980 --> 03:15:40.680]  Now let me expand.
[03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:43.592]  The problem is they labeled us as fake.
[03:15:43.992 --> 03:15:46.334]  That made their audience come to us to see if we were.
[03:15:46.655 --> 03:15:47.676]  They liked what they heard.
[03:15:47.976 --> 03:15:48.837]  They kept listening.
[03:15:49.137 --> 03:15:49.898]  Here's an example.
[03:15:50.398 --> 03:15:50.939]  May 3rd.
[03:15:51.479 --> 03:15:52.200]  Comey goes out.
[03:15:53.533 --> 03:15:58.296]  And he tells Congress, no one in the administration tried to influence me or told me to obstruct justice.
[03:15:58.936 --> 03:16:00.417]  We run it, they say it's fake.
[03:16:01.217 --> 03:16:03.299]  Then he comes out, June 8th, says it again.
[03:16:03.319 --> 03:16:05.240]  I didn't play the senator, Senator Burr.
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:07.921]  He says no, they didn't try to obstruct justice, Trump never did that.
[03:16:08.322 --> 03:16:12.704]  They then again said we were fake in the New York Times the next day without even showing the video.
[03:16:13.124 --> 03:16:17.927]  So that's all they've done is use us as the label to say reality's fake, Paul.
[03:16:18.207 --> 03:16:19.148]  That is quite an honor.
[03:16:21.089 --> 03:16:22.610]  No, I mean there are numerous examples.
[03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:25.592]  There was a Podesta email back in October last year.
[03:16:26.052 --> 03:16:30.735]  The headline was WikiLeaks email Hillary campaign struggles to reach effing dumb young people.
[03:16:31.115 --> 03:16:36.338]  And this was an exchange between a marketing executive and John Podesta.
[03:16:36.758 --> 03:16:41.560]  We reported that with the quotes direct from the released email, the leaked email.
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:51.164]  And Snopes does an article and says, oh, the marketing executive, this Clintonite, didn't really mean that, even though that's his direct quote in the email.
[03:16:51.444 --> 03:16:52.785]  This is what he actually meant.
[03:16:53.045 --> 03:16:57.767]  And they made up an entirely new quote, literally fake news, pulled it out of thin air.
[03:16:58.127 --> 03:16:59.968]  And then said, no, he actually meant this.
[03:17:00.009 --> 03:17:02.831]  He wasn't talking about effing dumb young people.
[03:17:02.871 --> 03:17:03.671]  He meant something else.
[03:17:03.691 --> 03:17:09.515]  We're going to create a quote out of nothing and then call you fake news for using the original quote!
[03:17:09.916 --> 03:17:11.297]  And that's the key.
[03:17:11.777 --> 03:17:12.718]  How do we reach out?
[03:17:13.298 --> 03:17:19.822]  To the young people, the trendies, who've been conned, who've been manipulated, who think they're on the winning team and are upset now because they have nothing.
[03:17:20.242 --> 03:17:21.723]  Nothing cultural, nothing financial.
[03:17:22.124 --> 03:17:32.850]  As they see what they believe is their stake, the Democratic combine of doddering, senile Nancy Pelosi and everybody stumbling around in circles, they see their zombie ship going under.
[03:17:33.150 --> 03:17:35.191]  They're mad at us that we're getting off the ship.
[03:17:35.512 --> 03:17:36.812]  We don't even want to fight with them.
[03:17:37.153 --> 03:17:38.834]  How do you tell somebody they've been conned?
[03:17:38.854 --> 03:17:40.395]  Because remember that talk show host?
[03:17:41.175 --> 03:17:47.499]  We won't say his name 15 years ago that flipped out because I told him the Nigeria email was fake and he wasn't really getting a million dollars.
[03:17:47.559 --> 03:17:49.400]  He got ripped off for tens of thousands of dollars.
[03:17:50.441 --> 03:17:52.202]  I've had family, you've had people the same way.
[03:17:52.462 --> 03:17:54.143]  They won't listen when they're being conned.
[03:17:54.563 --> 03:17:57.545]  When they get ripped off, they're still mad at us for life.
[03:17:58.126 --> 03:17:59.386]  So it's the same thing with trendies.
[03:17:59.687 --> 03:18:01.828]  How do we let them know we really care about them?
[03:18:03.496 --> 03:18:11.544]  I think the main thing, Alex, is to tackle this idea that communism and socialism is the solution, which we have to discredit every single generation.
[03:18:11.937 --> 03:18:19.340]  Because they've created this fake brand of populism through Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn here in the UK, who looks like he could win the next election.
[03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:25.003]  Literally a Venezuelan fanboy, Hamas, Hezbollah, IRA, terrorist sympathiser.
[03:18:25.363 --> 03:18:32.046]  So you have to discredit this fake left-winged brand of populism that really does just concentrate wealth in the hands of the elite.
[03:18:32.086 --> 03:18:34.407]  It's not even about redistribution of wealth.
[03:18:35.007 --> 03:18:43.772]  But now we have literally the guy who's probably going to be the next Prime Minister calling for private property to be seized so homeless people can be housed.
[03:18:44.173 --> 03:18:47.134]  Of course it's all going to be seized for the state if it actually happens anyway.
[03:18:47.175 --> 03:18:53.358]  And the EU's been doing that for years now, giving people's houses to the migrants.
[03:18:53.658 --> 03:18:54.299]  This is a plan.
[03:18:55.953 --> 03:18:59.257]  Yeah, they're trying to get... Well, you've seen the videos out of Italy.
[03:18:59.277 --> 03:19:02.321]  They go into an old guy's hotel, little bed and breakfast.
[03:19:02.681 --> 03:19:03.802]  He's literally crying.
[03:19:03.862 --> 03:19:05.104]  He later collapses.
[03:19:05.124 --> 03:19:09.629]  And they just boss in all these African migrants and they take over his hotel.
[03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:11.071]  By force!
[03:19:11.912 --> 03:19:13.673]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:19:14.073 --> 03:19:20.175]  In Germany today you've got more people, their homes are being raided because they said mean things about migrants on the internet.
[03:19:20.495 --> 03:19:22.896]  You've got van drivers in Calais being killed.
[03:19:23.256 --> 03:19:26.777]  They put logs on the motorways, they drive into them, they're killed.
[03:19:27.437 --> 03:19:30.239]  The BBC describes it as a temporary barrier.
[03:19:30.259 --> 03:19:33.421]  There's actually huge tree trunks that they put in the road.
[03:19:33.842 --> 03:19:35.983]  So we're living in an age of complete deception.
[03:19:57.538 --> 03:20:06.345]  When Palestinians stab an Israeli policewoman to death, and then the troops shoot them, the headline is, Israelis killed three Palestinians.
[03:20:07.847 --> 03:20:08.287]  Exactly.
[03:20:08.627 --> 03:20:10.829]  But it's World Refugee Day, Alex.
[03:20:10.889 --> 03:20:17.175]  I mean, we're not going to talk about the hundreds of thousands of Christians who have been displaced and beheaded and forced to pay the jizya tax.
[03:20:17.645 --> 03:20:20.849]  No, we're going to talk about these economic migrants who are coming in.
[03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:26.575]  Again, coming into Italy, 2.65% of them are actually refugees.
[03:20:26.915 --> 03:20:28.477]  The vast majority of them.
[03:20:28.737 --> 03:20:30.239]  They're not even coming from Libya.
[03:20:30.279 --> 03:20:31.520]  They're economic migrants.
[03:20:31.581 --> 03:20:32.882]  They're causing huge problems.
[03:20:32.922 --> 03:20:34.784]  Now we've got people in Calais being killed.
[03:20:35.285 --> 03:20:36.846]  We've got a story out of RT.
[03:20:37.247 --> 03:20:38.108]  Infidels should have
[03:20:38.388 --> 03:20:39.208]  Broke's cut.
[03:20:39.308 --> 03:20:41.969]  Italy arrests Iraqi refugee over ISIS support.
[03:20:42.309 --> 03:20:45.209]  We've got more rapes happening in... You're in Europe a lot.
[03:20:45.289 --> 03:20:46.190]  I've been over to Europe.
[03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:51.711]  It is literally, in Rome, Islamists everywhere crapping on the side of the street.
[03:20:51.791 --> 03:20:54.151]  And it's just... France is imploding.
[03:20:55.231 --> 03:20:56.092]  Their terrorism's down 80%.
[03:20:56.892 --> 03:20:58.312]  What in the world is happening?
[03:20:59.952 --> 03:21:01.413]  France has basically given up.
[03:21:01.513 --> 03:21:03.253]  I mean, they had another incident yesterday.
[03:21:03.649 --> 03:21:07.872]  They tried to blow up a police officer with a bomb in a car at the Champs-Élysées.
[03:21:08.333 --> 03:21:09.254]  France has given up.
[03:21:09.334 --> 03:21:10.094]  France is done.
[03:21:10.355 --> 03:21:11.836]  They made their decision, Alex.
[03:21:11.876 --> 03:21:13.297]  They voted for more of this.
[03:21:13.637 --> 03:21:14.858]  What was it?
[03:21:14.878 --> 03:21:17.821]  5% of... And by the way, to be clear, you lived in London and France part of the time.
[03:21:17.881 --> 03:21:19.082]  You've now evacuated France.
[03:21:20.396 --> 03:21:24.439]  Oh yeah, my family's totally out of France, and we're not going back for good.
[03:21:24.459 --> 03:21:29.143]  I mean, there are still, in London probably, there are still decent areas where you can live.
[03:21:29.203 --> 03:21:32.466]  But again, it's all segregation, multiculturalism.
[03:21:32.526 --> 03:21:47.098]  And let's be clear, your family worked in the steel industry, they took that, they shipped it offshore, your parents sold everything they had, went and ran a big bed and breakfast in France, but it's so hellish with the Islamists running around, murdering everybody, that you guys have now evacuated to another country.
[03:21:49.446 --> 03:21:59.235]  Exactly, but it was out in the countryside, but even going back I could see in the supermarket, and this is in quite a remote area, you could see the increase in hijabs.
[03:21:59.776 --> 03:22:07.984]  Again, they're becoming more radicalised, more repressive, not less, as they supposedly integrate into Western society, which is not happening.
[03:22:08.264 --> 03:22:10.546]  But no, Tommy Robinson needs to be arrested,
[03:22:11.039 --> 03:22:15.922]  I need to be arrested because one drunken idiot tried to kill some Muslims.
[03:22:16.282 --> 03:22:20.724]  Let's not talk about the mechanised industrial bloodshed that's carried out in the name of Islam.
[03:22:21.225 --> 03:22:27.348]  Alex, Donald Trump is being criticised for not condemning this attack yesterday in London on these Muslims.
[03:22:27.708 --> 03:22:37.673]  If he had to condemn every terrorist attack that happened, he would have had to condemn 145 terror attacks since Ramadan started just 25 days ago.
[03:22:39.062 --> 03:22:41.799]  He'd be doing little else than condemning terror attacks.
[03:22:42.196 --> 03:22:44.097]  Point is, they're all Islamic.
[03:22:44.517 --> 03:22:46.118]  Almost every single one of them.
[03:22:46.378 --> 03:22:51.721]  So how dare you criticize Trump for not condemning terror attacks, if he actually did that?
[03:22:51.761 --> 03:22:53.222]  But this shows us where it's going.
[03:22:53.602 --> 03:23:00.185]  When somebody effectively, which I hope doesn't happen, goes and mows down a bunch of authoritarian liberals, it's going to be all of our fault.
[03:23:00.485 --> 03:23:03.407]  When somebody mows down a bunch of jihadi Muslims, it's going to be all of our fault.
[03:23:03.787 --> 03:23:06.028]  We can see how they're getting the clash of civilizations ready.
[03:23:06.268 --> 03:23:08.930]  Let's take a few calls, and I've got to get out of here because I'm stealing Paul's time.
[03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:10.951]  Hard to twist his arm to get him on air.
[03:23:10.971 --> 03:23:12.172]  He's a busy, busy guy.
[03:23:13.633 --> 03:23:14.494]  James in Texas.
[03:23:14.554 --> 03:23:15.375]  James, you're on the air.
[03:23:15.415 --> 03:23:15.775]  Go ahead.
[03:23:18.037 --> 03:23:19.519]  Hey, Alex and Paul and crew.
[03:23:19.559 --> 03:23:21.060]  Y'all are all doing a great job.
[03:23:21.240 --> 03:23:22.982]  I've been listening since 2005.
[03:23:23.422 --> 03:23:24.743]  All your products are awesome.
[03:23:24.863 --> 03:23:25.083]  Thank you.
[03:23:25.103 --> 03:23:26.365]  And your contests are great.
[03:23:27.646 --> 03:23:33.751]  I just want to let you know I called in and got live on C-SPAN this morning during Anthony Carnival's segment.
[03:23:34.406 --> 03:23:37.971]  And I was able to get the tagline out, CNN is ISIS Infowars.com.
[03:23:38.452 --> 03:23:41.316]  And so we're breaking through the lying mainstream media.
[03:23:42.077 --> 03:23:45.582]  Unfortunately, when I go back to look at the clip online, they have censored it.
[03:23:45.962 --> 03:23:51.190]  So you can hear me be introduced in the first part of my comment, and then the audio just cuts out completely.
[03:23:52.050 --> 03:23:59.394]  That's why folks have to record it live, because we don't blow up bridges and blow up families and rape kids like ISIS does, and put that out.
[03:23:59.594 --> 03:24:06.017]  We call into shows, we get on air, you then tape the info attack, and then you put it out yourself, that's how you get around them.
[03:24:06.237 --> 03:24:13.721]  They don't want to reward you doing that, so their ideas in live time start taking it out so there's no record of it, so you just circumnavigate them.
[03:24:15.762 --> 03:24:16.883]  You're all doing a great job.
[03:24:17.223 --> 03:24:17.983]  No, you are, brother.
[03:24:18.424 --> 03:24:18.864]  Anything else?
[03:24:20.228 --> 03:24:20.548]  That's it.
[03:24:20.568 --> 03:24:21.609]  I don't want to take up y'all's time.
[03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.809]  Absolutely.
[03:24:22.849 --> 03:24:24.110]  Yeah, we've got to go out when they're live.
[03:24:24.130 --> 03:24:34.196]  We've got to look where C-SPAN is going to be at universities, where C-SPAN is going to go videotape somebody having a speech on their record, or where they're going to have book people and go when they're doing public signings of books.
[03:24:34.496 --> 03:24:37.858]  Just hit them, hit them, hit them, hit them, hit them, hit them in the media.
[03:24:37.998 --> 03:24:41.199]  When they've got a congressman coming to speak at a town hall, go there.
[03:24:41.279 --> 03:24:42.020]  Get on the news.
[03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:42.840]  Be aggressive.
[03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:44.301]  Victory is amazing.
[03:24:44.581 --> 03:24:45.402]  I want to salute you.
[03:24:46.162 --> 03:24:47.963]  Let's go to Brandon in Seattle.
[03:24:47.983 --> 03:24:49.444]  You're on the air with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:50.725 --> 03:24:51.525]  How's it going, guys?
[03:24:51.826 --> 03:24:52.246]  Good, my friend.
[03:24:53.326 --> 03:24:55.748]  So, I want to talk about this immigration thing.
[03:24:56.088 --> 03:25:01.291]  I think we've lost this consciousness of this immigration thing.
[03:25:01.331 --> 03:25:08.435]  If we go back to 2007 Operation Fast and Furious, we're now seeing the regurgitating effects of what happened.
[03:25:08.515 --> 03:25:11.697]  Giving guns to the cartels, drugs coming in.
[03:25:12.714 --> 03:25:16.158]  Megan Kelly talking about how these aren't drugs floating across the water.
[03:25:16.178 --> 03:25:19.161]  I mean, we can watch this stuff on National Geographic.
[03:25:19.282 --> 03:25:20.863]  It's in full effect.
[03:25:20.923 --> 03:25:22.285]  I mean, Chicago's a nightmare.
[03:25:22.806 --> 03:25:26.870]  All of these things are happening, and now you want to bring more Muslims in.
[03:25:27.311 --> 03:25:28.853]  And currently, I live in Seattle.
[03:25:29.373 --> 03:25:33.458]  As of today, 11,000 people just in Seattle are homeless.
[03:25:34.147 --> 03:25:37.330]  So then to come full circle, you have all these heroin addicts that I see constantly.
[03:25:37.350 --> 03:25:37.911]  I drive for a living.
[03:25:54.187 --> 03:25:56.848]  I see people shooting up in the streets all day long.
[03:25:56.928 --> 03:25:58.609]  These drugs come from these cartels.
[03:25:58.769 --> 03:26:01.270]  This influx of people opening these borders.
[03:26:01.411 --> 03:26:05.252]  And welfare and all of it created this nightmare environment.
[03:26:05.312 --> 03:26:05.693]  Absolutely.
[03:26:05.733 --> 03:26:06.213]  Paul Watson?
[03:26:08.010 --> 03:26:13.697]  No, the thing about it, Alex, is that they're now trying to play it into this Islamophobia narrative.
[03:26:14.117 --> 03:26:18.722]  They had a Muslim teen that was tragically killed in Virginia on Sunday night.
[03:26:19.203 --> 03:26:26.251]  The left came out, numerous different outlets, prominent people, blamed it on Donald Trump, of course, and his supporters and his rhetoric.
[03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:38.114]  Turned out, Alex, today that it was an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, who they've been trying to deport for years, responsible for murdering this 17-year-old Muslim American teen.
[03:26:38.554 --> 03:26:41.955]  They blamed it on Donald Trump with absolutely no evidence.
[03:26:41.975 --> 03:26:43.295]  And I've got the tweets of the people.
[03:26:43.335 --> 03:26:48.117]  Of course, when I pointed this out to them, they immediately deleted the tweets and blocked me.
[03:26:48.939 --> 03:26:50.522]  But, you know, flip it over.
[03:26:50.562 --> 03:26:52.104]  You've got actual hate crime.
[03:26:52.124 --> 03:26:55.670]  You've got a guy, as you reported earlier, getting beat up by an Armenian gang.
[03:26:55.991 --> 03:27:03.583]  The actual hate crime wave is against conservatives, and they try and seize on anything, even if it's completely unrelated.
[03:27:03.939 --> 03:27:08.220]  To try and twist that Islamophobia narrative, because they want these refugees coming in.
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:13.541]  You know, 98% of whom are Muslim, even though Christians are the biggest persecutor group in the world.
[03:27:13.621 --> 03:27:14.321]  That's right, Paul.
[03:27:14.341 --> 03:27:17.322]  Well, you're doing an amazing job, and thank you for hosting Two Days this week.
[03:27:17.342 --> 03:27:22.183]  I know you're a busy guy, but everybody wants you on air more, and I just get excited to be on and talk with you.
[03:27:22.203 --> 03:27:23.423]  I love the great work you're doing.
[03:27:23.443 --> 03:27:29.705]  We've got unlimited calls here, I'll try to jam in one or two more, but this is just getting crazier and crazier.
[03:27:31.212 --> 03:27:34.753]  If we don't get serious about this though, I think civilization is going to collapse, Paul.
[03:27:36.253 --> 03:27:41.114]  Well, I think we're in a cycle now, and a lot of experts have said this, Alex, which is a pre-war cycle.
[03:27:41.154 --> 03:27:44.214]  We are at the height of a collapse-style scenario.
[03:27:44.254 --> 03:27:50.656]  There's definitely going to be a lot more chaos, a lot more bloodshed, unfortunately, over the next few years, and it could lead to war.
[03:27:50.696 --> 03:27:53.596]  That's not some apocalyptic doomsday prediction.
[03:27:53.916 --> 03:27:57.977]  That's what many experts are saying, because humanity goes through these cycles.
[03:27:58.507 --> 03:28:01.189]  Of chaos, of riots, of civil unrest.
[03:28:01.489 --> 03:28:04.071]  And again, I'm not a eugenicist.
[03:28:04.131 --> 03:28:06.112]  I don't want to artificially bring this in and do this.
[03:28:06.152 --> 03:28:10.275]  I've been trying to fight this as a humanitarian that wants to treat people like I want to be treated.
[03:28:10.315 --> 03:28:18.041]  But all these sniveling, lazy people and all these other folks that think this is funny, when the mass die-off happens, when the veneer of civilization peels off,
[03:28:18.621 --> 03:28:31.068]  They're all deader than a hammer, and they're all untrained, unfocused, lazy people who are trying to start fights with the competent producers of the world in some existential envy situation, and it's going to be explosive, Paul.
[03:28:32.918 --> 03:28:36.540]  No, I mean, watch those Antifa weapons training videos.
[03:28:36.580 --> 03:28:38.861]  They're hilarious because they don't know what the hell they're doing.
[03:28:38.881 --> 03:28:45.865]  I mean, I wouldn't know what I was doing because I'm a completely disarmed peasant living in a country where it's illegal to even own pepper spray.
[03:28:46.165 --> 03:28:48.166]  You can't even have pepper spray in your house.
[03:28:48.726 --> 03:28:54.349]  Well, Paul, you and your brother were shooting bulls-eye the first time you shot guns at me, like, 15 years ago, the first time you visited.
[03:28:54.590 --> 03:29:01.634]  We just need... I know you don't like 110 degrees like Texas, but we need to get you here at least six months out of the year.
[03:29:01.714 --> 03:29:03.715]  Don't evacuate to some other European country.
[03:29:04.155 --> 03:29:06.477]  Evacuate to the wild, wild west, my friend.
[03:29:07.827 --> 03:29:14.595]  I might have to eventually, Alex, but like you said, those people who are pushing for violence, they're not very good at it, are they?
[03:29:14.915 --> 03:29:22.764]  I mean, it's very fortunate that there wasn't a massacre of Republicans last week, and it's primarily because the guy was such a terrible shooter.
[03:29:23.345 --> 03:29:25.167]  Because again, they're not trained in this at all.
[03:29:25.187 --> 03:29:26.469]  Didn't he look like Dennis Hastert?
[03:29:27.685 --> 03:29:31.388]  Yeah, he looked like a complete fruitcake, but they're still blaming Trump today.
[03:29:31.688 --> 03:29:41.337]  You have the guy on 60 Minutes, I forgot his name, he's the guy who interviewed Cernovich, blaming Trump for the attempted massacre of Republican lawmakers.
[03:29:41.437 --> 03:29:43.679]  Yeah, it's his fault that people are killing folks.
[03:29:44.179 --> 03:29:48.202]  Alright, Paul, we've got a few other callers, but I'm sorry to Travis and Maureen, you guys are awesome.
[03:29:48.483 --> 03:29:49.604]  Paul's got to take over, though.
[03:29:49.624 --> 03:29:52.246]  Notly News Tonight at 7, I'll be back tomorrow with David Knight and others.
[03:29:52.526 --> 03:29:55.512]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.454 --> 03:29:59.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.780 --> 03:30:07.302]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:30:07.762 --> 03:30:13.805]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:30:14.225 --> 03:30:17.007]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:17.387 --> 03:30:20.409]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:20.609 --> 03:30:24.051]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:30:24.371 --> 03:30:24.831]  The left
[03:30:25.191 --> 03:30:26.112]  ...controls culture.
[03:30:26.152 --> 03:30:27.132]  They control art.
[03:30:27.192 --> 03:30:28.433]  They control entertainment.
[03:30:28.733 --> 03:30:35.817]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:35.857 --> 03:30:38.258]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:30:38.758 --> 03:30:42.621]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:30:42.661 --> 03:30:44.722]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:30:45.362 --> 03:30:50.729]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:30:50.989 --> 03:30:57.256]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:30:57.317 --> 03:30:59.019]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:30:59.159 --> 03:31:00.360]  It's available right now.
[03:31:00.681 --> 03:31:02.863]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:04.025 --> 03:31:06.666]  Don't let bugs get in the way of your outdoor adventures.
[03:31:07.446 --> 03:31:13.268]  The best way to dodge those pesky bugs this summer is with Be Away Spray by Emrix Essentials.
[03:31:13.808 --> 03:31:19.410]  Be Away Spray will help you combat insects and avoid itchy, inflamed skin while you're enjoying the outdoors.
[03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:25.111]  The Aromatherapy Essential Oils have a pleasant scent for humans, but not for bugs.
[03:31:25.912 --> 03:31:29.513]  Many people have sensitive skin and cannot use bug repellent that contains teeth.
[03:31:30.433 --> 03:31:34.237]  Emrix Essentials brings you an organic product that is deed free.
[03:31:34.838 --> 03:31:39.803]  It is an all-natural spray that is completely free of any synthetic ingredients and preservatives.
[03:31:40.344 --> 03:31:44.688]  Organic oils are used to provide you with the most potent and purest formula.
[03:31:45.049 --> 03:31:50.414]  Go organic with Emrix Essentials and naturally repel bugs with Be Away Spray.
[03:31:51.275 --> 03:31:54.237]  Stop exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[03:31:54.837 --> 03:32:00.281]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and learn more about the new Be Away Spray by Emrix Essentials.
[03:32:00.701 --> 03:32:02.783]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:02.923 --> 03:32:07.326]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:32:07.406 --> 03:32:18.333]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:32:18.493 --> 03:32:23.416]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:32:23.536 --> 03:32:26.038]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:32:26.098 --> 03:32:27.599]  It helps detoxify.
[03:32:27.819 --> 03:32:30.660]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:32:30.700 --> 03:32:35.443]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:32:35.483 --> 03:32:41.707]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:32:41.747 --> 03:32:47.050]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:47.831]  I'm taking it now.
[03:32:48.151 --> 03:32:53.495]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:53.595 --> 03:32:54.915]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:22.503 --> 03:33:25.424]  Hi, it's the 4th hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watts.
[03:33:25.444 --> 03:33:27.064]  I'm going to get back into the news now.
[03:33:27.584 --> 03:33:32.245]  Of course, there was an attempted massacre of Republican lawmakers last week in Alexandria.
[03:33:33.246 --> 03:33:47.309]  And you would think that that would cause Bernie Sanders, because it was a Bernie Sanders voter who attempted to carry out that massacre, to change his rhetoric, to lower the tone, to be more cautious about what he's encouraging his supporters to do.
[03:33:47.409 --> 03:33:47.769]  Well, no.
[03:33:48.891 --> 03:33:49.711]  That's not happening.
[03:33:50.151 --> 03:33:56.994]  The American Mirror reports Bernie Sanders urges supporters to act in unprecedented ways to stop Republicans.
[03:33:57.634 --> 03:34:09.859]  Imagine if a Donald Trump voter had gone out and shot or tried to massacre a bunch of Democrats, and then Trump had come out a few days later and said, we need to act in unprecedented ways to stop Democrats.
[03:34:10.459 --> 03:34:12.580]  There'd be absolute hysteria.
[03:34:12.900 --> 03:34:14.640]  Bernie Sanders comes out and says it.
[03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:16.541]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:34:17.287 --> 03:34:28.498]  Apparently not learning any lessons from a near-fatal attack by one of his supporters on Republican Congressmen and staffers, Bernie Sanders is urging Democrats to fight the GOP by any means necessary.
[03:34:29.078 --> 03:34:32.642]  During a Facebook Live Q&A with fellow progressive crank Elizabeth Warren,
[03:34:33.288 --> 03:34:42.212]  Pocahontas, on Monday, Sanders told a supporter named Mary that liberals need to take, quote, unprecedented action to stop Republicans.
[03:34:42.653 --> 03:34:45.054]  He said, we've got to stand up and fight back.
[03:34:45.094 --> 03:34:52.558]  We've got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before, because what is happening now in Washington is unprecedented.
[03:34:53.598 --> 03:34:57.840]  So again, you get crazy people who are on the fringes of society.
[03:34:58.260 --> 03:34:59.581]  They hear him saying that.
[03:35:00.001 --> 03:35:01.242]  They're prone to violence.
[03:35:01.929 --> 03:35:03.090]  What do you think is going to happen?
[03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:04.550]  It's not going to end well, is it?
[03:35:04.611 --> 03:35:05.851]  And it's the timing of it.
[03:35:06.331 --> 03:35:17.458]  Literally, less than a week after one of his supporters tries to massacre Republicans, he's talking about fighting, taking down Republicans in unprecedented ways.
[03:35:18.458 --> 03:35:20.559]  Again, if Trump said that, there would be hysteria.
[03:35:20.599 --> 03:35:21.660]  Bernie Sanders says it.
[03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:23.000]  Nothing!
[03:35:23.180 --> 03:35:26.661]  Because again, the left never disavows violent extremism.
[03:35:26.781 --> 03:35:28.982]  It encourages it at every turn.
[03:35:29.222 --> 03:35:30.342]  That's the difference.
[03:35:30.802 --> 03:35:33.883]  Nobody's denying that there aren't right-wing violent extremists.
[03:35:33.923 --> 03:35:35.764]  The difference is we don't encourage them.
[03:35:36.144 --> 03:35:39.545]  We don't embrace them after these attacks happen.
[03:35:40.465 --> 03:35:43.966]  We had that big story up on m4wars.com, which we talked about earlier.
[03:35:44.927 --> 03:35:45.707]  Trump was right.
[03:35:45.767 --> 03:35:49.448]  New study reveals up to 5.7 million illegals voted in election.
[03:35:50.117 --> 03:35:52.458]  That was the 2008 election.
[03:35:52.898 --> 03:36:04.942]  Given the level of hysteria aimed at Trump's border policies surrounding the context of that debate, you'd probably imagine that there would have been more illegal voters in 2016.
[03:36:06.022 --> 03:36:16.366]  So this organisation looked at the data and basically found that the available data that was already out there proves that up to 5.7 million illegals voted in 2008.
[03:36:17.936 --> 03:36:20.617]  Around 3.6 million as an upper figure in 2012.
[03:36:21.017 --> 03:36:26.037]  And again, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by about 2.8 million.
[03:36:26.638 --> 03:36:32.519]  Donald Trump came out on many occasions and said 3 million illegals probably voted.
[03:36:33.759 --> 03:36:34.439]  Vote fraud.
[03:36:34.759 --> 03:36:42.180]  He got absolutely bashed from pillar to post and it was the discredited debunked info wars that was the source of that claim.
[03:36:42.620 --> 03:36:45.281]  Well now they've analysed the actual data that's been available
[03:36:45.888 --> 03:36:48.890]  We underestimated the number, if anything.
[03:36:49.530 --> 03:37:04.657]  That's a story that's not going to get any play, and the mainstream media will continue to say that Trump's engaging in fake news and conspiracy theories, and he's actually pointing out the genuine possibility, based on data, that millions of illegal immigrants did vote.
[03:37:06.298 --> 03:37:07.399]  More left-wing terrorism.
[03:37:07.419 --> 03:37:09.940]  Trump supporters stabbed nine times in a parking lot.
[03:37:10.020 --> 03:37:12.081]  You probably heard that story reported earlier.
[03:37:13.556 --> 03:37:26.936]  Just a week after Republican politicians were attacked by Bernie-supporting leftists while practicing for the congressional baseball game, a Trump supporter has been stabbed nine times in a parking lot after left-wing thugs identified him as a Conservative.
[03:37:27.699 --> 03:37:32.203]  So we have yet another hate crime targeting a Donald Trump supporter.
[03:37:32.523 --> 03:37:36.266]  It will get zero play in the mainstream media.
[03:37:36.807 --> 03:37:41.351]  Oh, but a teen American Muslim gets murdered within hours.
[03:37:41.811 --> 03:37:49.318]  They are out there blaming Donald Trump and his rhetoric, despite there being no evidence whatsoever that it had anything to do with Donald Trump.
[03:37:49.898 --> 03:37:50.399]  In fact,
[03:37:51.300 --> 03:37:57.964]  The murder was carried out by an illegal alien from El Salvador who ICE has been trying to deport for years.
[03:37:58.705 --> 03:38:01.866]  Oh, and they suddenly lost all interest in the story!
[03:38:02.387 --> 03:38:03.427]  I wonder why that is?
[03:38:04.608 --> 03:38:07.950]  Murder of Muslim girl blamed on Trump was committed by an illegal immigrant.
[03:38:08.490 --> 03:38:14.334]  The murder of an American Muslim teen in Virginia that leftists blamed on Donald Trump was actually committed by an illegal immigrant.
[03:38:14.874 --> 03:38:19.617]  As soon as this facet of the story became known, leftists suddenly lost all interest in the case.
[03:38:21.923 --> 03:38:22.743]  I wonder why.
[03:38:23.543 --> 03:38:32.686]  So you had a group of Muslim teenagers, the victim was called Nabra Hassanin, who had gone to an old Dulles-area Muslim society function.
[03:38:32.706 --> 03:38:46.789]  They were walking back home when suddenly Darwin Martinez Torres—sounds like a white guy's name, doesn't it?—drove up a curb towards a group of about 15 teens who were walking in Fairfax County.
[03:38:47.253 --> 03:39:01.316]  So he starts an argument with one of these teens, then starts chasing the group with a baseball bat, eventually catches up with this 17-year-old American Muslim girl, whacks her around the head with the bat, kills her, takes her body to another location.
[03:39:02.076 --> 03:39:04.996]  She died from blunt force trauma to the upper body.
[03:39:06.016 --> 03:39:07.297]  Now, that came out Sunday.
[03:39:08.197 --> 03:39:14.618]  Within days, in fact, it was the next day, it was Monday, before we even knew the identity of the perpetrator,
[03:39:15.325 --> 03:39:20.588]  The president and co-founder of The New Agenda, Amy Siskin, tweeted this.
[03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:30.955]  Quote, it appears at Donald Trump, at real Donald Trump, is also going to turn a blind eye to a white man kidnapping and murdering a 17-year-old Muslim woman in our country.
[03:39:31.996 --> 03:39:36.058]  She continued, Trump's hatred and bigotry are ripping the fabric of our country apart.
[03:39:37.039 --> 03:39:43.163]  So she not only blamed Trump, she collectively demonized white people, because that's perfectly acceptable to do that.
[03:39:43.203 --> 03:39:44.584]  You do that to any other race or
[03:39:45.456 --> 03:39:49.838]  Ethnicity or religion, you're a bigot, you're a racist, you can do it to white people, that's fine.
[03:39:50.258 --> 03:39:53.379]  Before they even knew the identity of the perpetrator!
[03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:57.701]  Turns out that it's an illegal alien from El Salvador.
[03:39:58.061 --> 03:40:02.463]  As soon as that came out, they suddenly lost interest in the story.
[03:40:02.743 --> 03:40:03.704]  Isn't that a shock?
[03:40:04.924 --> 03:40:12.007]  The Independent newspaper, which of course is a left-wing newspaper in the United Kingdom, criticised Trump
[03:40:12.526 --> 03:40:16.349]  for failing to address, quote, the murder of a Muslim teenager in Virginia.
[03:40:17.010 --> 03:40:23.154]  The Atlantic, another left-wing publication, came out and said, Muslims feel under siege.
[03:40:23.214 --> 03:40:33.863]  That was the title of the article in which writer Emma Green tied Hassan N's murder into a larger, sinister narrative alleging a wave of Islamophobia sweeping the West.
[03:40:34.583 --> 03:40:36.204]  Well, one, this wasn't Islamophobia.
[03:40:36.224 --> 03:40:40.608]  It was an insane, crazy guy who just wanted to attack a bunch of people by the looks of it.
[03:40:41.252 --> 03:40:43.692]  Number two, it had nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[03:40:44.113 --> 03:40:45.133]  The guy wasn't white.
[03:40:45.373 --> 03:40:46.593]  He was an illegal alien.
[03:40:47.393 --> 03:41:01.136]  When this was pointed out to these three individuals who I just mentioned, Siskind, the independent writer, and the Atlantic writer, who I confronted on Twitter about this this morning, they had absolutely nothing to say.
[03:41:01.176 --> 03:41:08.037]  In fact, Amy Siskind, within minutes of me pointing out that this was an illegal alien, I basically said, hey,
[03:41:08.703 --> 03:41:10.144]  Are you going to do another tweet about this?
[03:41:10.164 --> 03:41:11.845]  Are you going to update your story about this?
[03:41:12.345 --> 03:41:16.087]  Within minutes, she deleted the tweet and she blocked me.
[03:41:16.987 --> 03:41:26.072]  Again, no retraction for blaming it, collectively demonising white people, demonising Trump, no retraction whatsoever.
[03:41:26.473 --> 03:41:28.274]  Because that's just how they roll.
[03:41:29.154 --> 03:41:36.418]  And it looks like this illegal immigrant who committed the murder was brought in under Obama's unaccompanied alien children programme
[03:41:37.102 --> 03:41:43.187]  But again, they tried to spin it into a narrative about Islamophobia, which simply doesn't exist.
[03:41:44.128 --> 03:41:45.909]  Are there sporadic attacks on Muslims?
[03:41:45.929 --> 03:41:47.251]  Yes, nobody's denying that.
[03:41:47.511 --> 03:41:56.658]  There isn't a nationwide epidemic of it, like there is attacks on Trump supporters, which we see almost every day.
[03:41:57.099 --> 03:41:58.640]  Another one we reported on today.
[03:42:01.242 --> 03:42:03.324]  Now, talking about leftist media hypocrisy,
[03:42:03.823 --> 03:42:09.226]  Flashback, HuffPo said ArrogantOttoWarmbier deserved to be imprisoned because he's white!
[03:42:10.387 --> 03:42:18.791]  So you've probably seen the story by now, the unfortunate death of this young guy who was imprisoned in North Korea, absolutely brutalized.
[03:42:19.651 --> 03:42:24.294]  He managed to escape eventually, he managed to get back to the US, but of course died yesterday.
[03:42:25.233 --> 03:42:37.763]  The Huffington Post, when they originally wrote about this story, basically said, and it wasn't just the Huffington Post, it was Salon.com, it was Larry Wilmore, they all viciously attacked Otto Warmbier because he was white.
[03:42:38.223 --> 03:42:46.730]  Making jokes about it, said he basically deserved to be in a North Korean gulag because he tried to steal, what was it, a flag from a hotel room.
[03:42:48.311 --> 03:42:53.495]  Do you have any idea the absolute terror that takes place in these North Korean gulags?
[03:42:54.011 --> 03:42:58.614]  They literally have pregnant women who give birth and the guards stamp the baby to death.
[03:43:00.115 --> 03:43:03.438]  This is, this is Siberian-style tyranny.
[03:43:04.759 --> 03:43:09.962]  Absolute, unremitting terror that this poor young guy had to go through.
[03:43:10.242 --> 03:43:14.666]  They were making jokes about it and saying, oh, it's perfectly fine because he's white.
[03:43:16.087 --> 03:43:17.287]  That he deserved it.
[03:43:18.168 --> 03:43:19.649]  And now he's dead.
[03:43:20.109 --> 03:43:21.991]  Well, how do you feel about that, Huffington Post?
[03:43:22.011 --> 03:43:23.532]  They actually started removing
[03:43:24.378 --> 03:43:29.080]  How about just not being racist in the first place, Huffington Post?
[03:43:30.400 --> 03:43:35.902]  Then you won't have to go back and memory hole all these inconvenient passages from your articles.
[03:43:35.942 --> 03:43:36.622]  How about that?
[03:43:36.642 --> 03:43:37.203]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:43:53.510 --> 03:44:05.479]  Going back to what happened in London yesterday, of course, there's been an absolutely monumental freak-out about that, a tidal wave of hysteria, because there was a terror attack by a right-wing crazy guy.
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:10.683]  Most of them were quite pleased about that because it really fit into their narrative.
[03:44:11.484 --> 03:44:15.807]  Now they're saying that it's Tommy Robinson's fault, that it's my fault, that we're hate preachers.
[03:44:15.827 --> 03:44:23.113]  You remember that meme that was put out to counter-leftists, which basically says, everyone who disagrees with me is Hitler.
[03:44:23.612 --> 03:44:26.172]  Because that's basically the only argument they have at this point.
[03:44:26.533 --> 03:44:27.793]  That's been out for several months.
[03:44:27.833 --> 03:44:32.474]  I think that should be changed to, everyone who disagrees with me is a hate preacher.
[03:44:33.574 --> 03:44:49.237]  Because yes, the same people who said absolutely nothing about actual hate preachers in the United Kingdom, who radicalised actual known terrorists in this country, terrorists who tried to carry out terrorist attacks, they said nothing about that.
[03:44:49.597 --> 03:44:51.817]  But as soon as this incident happened yesterday,
[03:44:52.734 --> 03:45:01.479]  It was Tommy Robinson who had to be arrested because he called, for example, for the Didsbury Mosque to be investigated.
[03:45:01.860 --> 03:45:13.547]  The mosque attended by the Manchester bomber, which passed out leaflets to hundreds of people that said, basically, the West is corrupt, the West is dead, don't integrate, reject the West.
[03:45:14.267 --> 03:45:16.068]  No, no, we can't have an investigation into that.
[03:45:16.088 --> 03:45:20.531]  We have to have an investigation into Tommy Robinson and his YouTube videos.
[03:45:21.152 --> 03:45:21.652]  Newsweek
[03:45:22.529 --> 03:45:26.931]  He's also more worried about my YouTube videos than actual Islamic terror attacks.
[03:45:27.271 --> 03:45:32.334]  Their headline is Finsbury Park attack how Islamophobia spreads from the far right to the media.
[03:45:33.495 --> 03:45:40.758]  And they talk about, shockingly, the 10th most viewed video in the UK on the day of the Westminster terrorist attack was by Tommy Robinson.
[03:45:41.779 --> 03:45:48.102]  So they find the fact that Tommy Robinson put out a video on the day of the Westminster terrorist attack shocking.
[03:45:48.993 --> 03:45:56.958]  Forget about the actual attack, you know, mowing down people in cold blood, tearing them apart limb from limb, stabbing police officers.
[03:45:57.018 --> 03:45:57.898]  No, that's not shocking.
[03:45:57.938 --> 03:46:00.640]  What's shocking is Tommy Robinson made a video about it.
[03:46:01.060 --> 03:46:02.421]  Oh my God, what are we going to do?
[03:46:03.122 --> 03:46:04.142]  The article continues.
[03:46:04.983 --> 03:46:08.185]  Again, talking about the Westminster terrorist attack, which happened a few months ago.
[03:46:08.965 --> 03:46:13.808]  Similarly worrying is that in the aftermath of the attack, this is what's worrying, okay?
[03:46:14.451 --> 03:46:22.236]  The most mentioned Twitter account in Britain was Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large for the far-right American conspiracy and fake news site InfoWars.
[03:46:24.237 --> 03:46:26.058]  Okay, Newsweek calling us fake news.
[03:46:26.098 --> 03:46:34.564]  That's pretty rich, isn't it, given that they were vehemently behind the biggest fake news story of all time, which led to the deaths of a million people, but okay, we'll drop that for now.
[03:46:35.885 --> 03:46:41.768]  He launched his YouTube channel in July 2011 and now has over 950,000 subscribers.
[03:46:42.228 --> 03:46:43.208]  Yeah, you better believe it.
[03:46:43.749 --> 03:46:45.649]  Just sense that butthurt right there.
[03:46:45.749 --> 03:46:48.751]  Because you don't translate on YouTube, do you, Newsweek?
[03:46:49.111 --> 03:46:52.252]  You don't resonate with anyone on YouTube because you're lazy.
[03:46:52.793 --> 03:46:54.894]  Your hacks have no talent whatsoever.
[03:46:55.214 --> 03:46:58.915]  They don't know how to reach younger audiences because they're crap.
[03:46:59.296 --> 03:47:03.778]  And you're jealous about it, which is why you're going to implicate me in terror attacks.
[03:47:04.118 --> 03:47:04.678]  Shameful.
[03:47:05.538 --> 03:47:07.280]  But again, listen to what they're saying.
[03:47:08.140 --> 03:47:10.663]  I've got over 950,000 subscribers.
[03:47:11.643 --> 03:47:20.852]  My channel is being viewed over 206 million views on the videos, with individual videos regularly being viewed over half a million times and some over several million times.
[03:47:22.073 --> 03:47:24.455]  That's what they call worrying.
[03:47:25.993 --> 03:47:42.606]  In the context of Islamic terror attacks, where little girls are having their arms and legs blown off, where people are having to jump into the River Thames because some jihadist is barrelling towards them in a massive van at 80 miles an hour.
[03:47:43.526 --> 03:47:44.807]  No, that's not worrying, no.
[03:47:45.368 --> 03:47:46.168]  That's not worrying.
[03:47:46.308 --> 03:47:51.012]  Actual suicide bombers at Ariana Grande pop concerts, no.
[03:47:52.045 --> 03:47:52.685]  That's not worrying.
[03:47:53.005 --> 03:47:56.566]  What's worrying is that I've got nearly a million YouTube subscribers.
[03:47:58.027 --> 03:47:59.547]  That's what we should be concerned about.
[03:47:59.787 --> 03:48:02.208]  People have viewed my videos 206 million times.
[03:48:02.728 --> 03:48:03.728]  That's of concern.
[03:48:05.228 --> 03:48:08.449]  The most mentioned Twitter account on the day of the Westminster attack was mine.
[03:48:08.889 --> 03:48:10.250]  That's what we should be worried about.
[03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:12.970]  Not the fact that these attacks are happening in Europe.
[03:48:13.571 --> 03:48:15.391]  Basically almost every day now.
[03:48:18.412 --> 03:48:18.532]  No.
[03:48:19.187 --> 03:48:20.848]  I've got nearly a million subscribers.
[03:48:21.248 --> 03:48:22.428]  That's the main concern.
[03:48:22.808 --> 03:48:25.469]  And that's why Newsweek and the mainstream media is a joke.
[03:48:25.770 --> 03:48:29.171]  That's why you don't have a million subscribers on YouTube.
[03:48:29.431 --> 03:48:30.812]  That's why nobody reads you.
[03:48:31.012 --> 03:48:32.552]  That's why you're going out of business.
[03:48:32.812 --> 03:48:36.574]  Because that is plainly ludicrous to equate those two things.
[03:48:36.834 --> 03:48:37.534]  Newsweek.
[03:48:39.015 --> 03:48:39.675]  Unbelievable.
[03:48:41.576 --> 03:48:45.437]  AP reports German police hold Day of Action Against Hate postings online.
[03:48:45.737 --> 03:48:46.518]  36 targeted.
[03:48:46.738 --> 03:48:51.299]  Basically they're raiding people's homes because they said mean things on the internet about migrants.
[03:48:51.359 --> 03:48:52.439]  It's happening yet again.
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:57.601]  Last remaining police station in migrant-dominated Swedish suburbs forced to close.
[03:48:57.621 --> 03:48:58.801]  That's an RT report.
[03:48:59.762 --> 03:49:00.462]  So the post
[03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:04.591]  Nord came out and said it was basically unsafe to deliver mail there.
[03:49:05.111 --> 03:49:10.313]  In other areas, migrant areas of Sweden, they're building bulletproof police stations.
[03:49:10.754 --> 03:49:11.634]  But it's all peaceful.
[03:49:12.895 --> 03:49:17.277]  Donald Trump's wrong for talking about last night in Sweden, even though there's literally attacks every day.
[03:49:18.117 --> 03:49:20.799]  Crimes, stabbings, shootings, cars being set on fire.
[03:49:20.819 --> 03:49:22.459]  Oh, and this is a good one.
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:29.923]  The BBC described huge tree trunks being left in the road that killed a van driver in Calais.
[03:49:30.589 --> 03:49:32.609]  Of course, these migrants get out onto the highway.
[03:49:33.070 --> 03:49:34.330]  They get huge tree trunks.
[03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:42.091]  They leave them in the road to try and stop these vans, these lorries, so they can hijack them to illegally sneak into the United Kingdom.
[03:49:42.632 --> 03:49:45.452]  They put a huge tree trunk, several tree trunks, on the road.
[03:49:46.512 --> 03:49:47.933]  A van driver drove into them.
[03:49:48.173 --> 03:49:49.993]  Another van crashed into the back of him.
[03:49:50.573 --> 03:49:52.414]  One of the van drivers died.
[03:49:53.014 --> 03:49:54.674]  And how did the BBC report it?
[03:49:55.774 --> 03:49:58.995]  That the migrants had just put in a, quote, makeshift barrier
[03:49:59.952 --> 03:50:01.773]  A makeshift barrier.
[03:50:02.633 --> 03:50:05.994]  Again, notice how they try to soften it every single time.
[03:50:06.415 --> 03:50:08.195]  It was like three giant tree trunks.
[03:50:08.235 --> 03:50:10.016]  Let's just call it a makeshift barrier.
[03:50:10.516 --> 03:50:13.877]  And then maybe, you know, people will have more sympathy for the migrants.
[03:50:14.177 --> 03:50:15.298]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:50:16.098 --> 03:50:18.639]  But a van driver has died in an accident at Calais.
[03:50:19.079 --> 03:50:20.520]  Wasn't really an accident, was it?
[03:50:20.540 --> 03:50:28.583]  It was attempted murder after migrants dragged tree trunks onto the A16 motorway in a bid to slow traffic and break into vehicles bound for Britain.
[03:50:29.264 --> 03:50:32.866]  The only surprise about that story is it's the first time it's happened.
[03:50:34.427 --> 03:50:37.049]  They supposedly demolished the Calais migrant camp.
[03:50:37.629 --> 03:50:41.311]  It's back in operation, just in splintered different areas around it.
[03:50:42.051 --> 03:50:42.871]  Town of Calais.
[03:50:42.891 --> 03:50:52.455]  Of course you have leftists working for NGOs who set up food stalls, handing out food for these migrants, encouraging them to come there from other parts of France.
[03:50:52.975 --> 03:50:54.296]  Criminal behaviour.
[03:50:54.636 --> 03:50:55.976]  Helping criminals.
[03:50:56.296 --> 03:50:58.457]  Helping smuggle them into the United Kingdom.
[03:50:58.477 --> 03:51:00.038]  These leftists need to be arrested.
[03:51:00.058 --> 03:51:02.619]  We'll be back for the final segment of Alex Jones Live.
[03:51:02.659 --> 03:51:03.039]  InfoWars.
[03:51:03.699 --> 03:51:06.380]  One thing I love to talk about is liberal hypocrisy.
[03:51:06.420 --> 03:51:09.320]  Today I want to talk about Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream makers out of Vermont.
[03:51:09.380 --> 03:51:22.703]  At the end of last year, they wrote an open letter to President Trump where they talked about how they are strong advocates for racial, social justice, women, people of color, Muslims, migrants, refugees, the poor, and those who are further compromised by the policies and rhetoric you espouse during your campaign.
[03:51:22.903 --> 03:51:26.824]  Well, over the weekend, scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben & Jerry's.
[03:51:26.944 --> 03:51:27.224]  Why?
[03:51:27.344 --> 03:51:32.545]  Because the migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by the farms that provide milk to Ben & Jerry's.
[03:51:32.745 --> 03:51:45.417]  And these migrant farm workers, many of whom are illegal, started the Milk with Dignity program in 2014 with the Vermont group Migrant Justice to ensure farms provide migrant workers, some of which are illegal, fair wages, working conditions, and decent housing.
[03:51:45.437 --> 03:51:49.320]  In 2015, Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program, but they're still stuck in negotiations.
[03:51:49.540 --> 03:51:51.262]  So will they join the Milk with Dignity program?
[03:51:51.502 --> 03:51:51.922]  Who knows?
[03:51:51.962 --> 03:51:56.306]  But right now, migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure they get their freebies.
[03:51:56.566 --> 03:52:00.170]  We don't know the outcome, but one thing I sure do love is this liberal hypocrisy.
[03:52:00.270 --> 03:52:03.112]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:52:05.474 --> 03:52:07.276]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[03:52:08.957 --> 03:52:14.622]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[03:52:15.323 --> 03:52:19.206]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[03:52:20.163 --> 03:52:22.385]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[03:52:22.465 --> 03:52:23.607]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[03:52:24.287 --> 03:52:26.870]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[03:52:27.831 --> 03:52:28.191]  Or more.
[03:52:28.271 --> 03:52:30.093]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[03:52:30.694 --> 03:52:32.175]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[03:52:32.275 --> 03:52:35.639]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[03:52:35.739 --> 03:52:37.501]  It's actually scary.
[03:52:38.377 --> 03:52:48.481]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[03:52:49.461 --> 03:53:02.265]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.

[03:54:09.492 --> 03:54:16.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.560 --> 03:54:20.284]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:54:22.987 --> 03:54:30.033]  Breaking news out of Belgium, where we had a massive terrorist attack there at the airport and the subway back in March of last year.
[03:54:30.554 --> 03:54:35.137]  Explosion at Brussels Central Station as military shoot a suspect wearing an explosive belt.
[03:54:35.157 --> 03:54:38.160]  There's been an explosion at Brussels Central Station.
[03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:39.982]  The military have shot the individual.
[03:54:40.082 --> 03:54:41.303]  One suspect has been shot.
[03:54:41.323 --> 03:54:42.444]  There are no other casualties.
[03:54:42.764 --> 03:54:48.049]  He was allegedly carrying a backpack and a belt of explosives and was seriously injured after he was neutralized.
[03:54:49.290 --> 03:54:49.430]  So,
[03:54:50.245 --> 03:54:56.948]  Again, I just said before the break, while I was talking about it, there was another attempt at Islamic terror attack.
[03:54:56.968 --> 03:54:59.169]  But no, we shouldn't be concerned about it.
[03:54:59.229 --> 03:55:05.693]  Our biggest concern should be the amount of YouTube subscribers I've got, according to Newsweek, and Tommy Robinson's rant.
[03:55:06.113 --> 03:55:09.174]  That's literally what the left's been saying for the past two days.
[03:55:09.595 --> 03:55:13.196]  Meanwhile, you have Islamic terror attack after Islamic terror attack.
[03:55:13.216 --> 03:55:13.296]  147 now.
[03:55:13.757 --> 03:55:16.358]  I've probably missed a bunch.
[03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:19.690]  In the past 25 days since the start of Ramadan.
[03:55:20.011 --> 03:55:24.874]  But Donald Trump's bad because he didn't disavow, he didn't condemn the attack yesterday.
[03:55:25.594 --> 03:55:28.336]  Oh, you want Trump to condemn every single terror attack?
[03:55:28.596 --> 03:55:30.757]  He would be doing it all day, every day.
[03:55:31.458 --> 03:55:32.558]  And they're all Islamic.
[03:55:32.999 --> 03:55:40.163]  So to try to equate that with the sporadic threat of right-wing extremism is completely dishonest.
[03:55:40.863 --> 03:55:46.567]  Even in the time I was talking about it, there was another attempted massacre in Europe.
[03:55:47.216 --> 03:55:49.097]  Undoubtedly by an Islamic terrorist.
[03:55:49.157 --> 03:55:50.417]  That news is breaking.
[03:55:51.878 --> 03:55:57.820]  Before we get back into the news now, I need to tell you about the July Summer Mega Specials, the 4th of July Special.
[03:55:58.600 --> 03:56:02.741]  Now live at InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time, plus free shipping.
[03:56:03.462 --> 03:56:05.983]  I've talked about the unprecedented attacks against us.
[03:56:06.143 --> 03:56:08.343]  Alex has talked about it ad infinitum.
[03:56:08.964 --> 03:56:15.406]  From Facebook censorship to attacks on our funding sources, InfoWars is under an unprecedented globalist siege on all fronts.
[03:56:16.155 --> 03:56:20.657]  But it's thanks to your support that we're able to keep the lights on and continue the fight for liberty.
[03:56:21.618 --> 03:56:24.099]  And that can't be emphasised strongly enough.
[03:56:24.659 --> 03:56:34.964]  All these other outlets, all these other individuals have been taken down by mob outrage campaigns, targeting their advertisers, targeting them individually, their networks.
[03:56:35.044 --> 03:56:41.908]  They can't do that to us, at least not to the same extent, because our support base, our foundation is you.
[03:56:42.785 --> 03:56:45.846]  It has been for the past, what, 15 years plus.
[03:56:46.206 --> 03:56:55.148]  That's why we're somewhat immune to these leftist scandals, to these jackals that try to take us down via dirty tricks.
[03:56:55.208 --> 03:57:01.709]  So help support InfoWars and our mission to preserve free speech with our limited 4th July Summer Mega Special.

[03:57:23.558 --> 03:57:25.819]  We need it now more than ever.
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:29.301]  Let's hear a final few news stories here.
[03:57:29.742 --> 03:57:31.403]  Infidels should have their throats cut.
[03:57:31.563 --> 03:57:40.028]  Italy arrested an Iraqi refugee who supported ISIS and basically said that anyone who doesn't convert to Islam needs to have their throat cut.
[03:57:40.785 --> 03:57:45.109]  They're inviting in hundreds of thousands of individuals into Italy a year.
[03:57:45.150 --> 03:57:51.336]  They're basically picking them up as a taxi service from Libya, eight miles, 12 miles off the coast of Libya.
[03:57:51.816 --> 03:57:55.760]  These people are coming in with ISIS beheading videos, ISIS flags on their phones.
[03:57:56.421 --> 03:58:01.106]  Again, the majority of them won't support ISIS, but it only takes a tiny percentage.
[03:58:01.807 --> 03:58:03.008]  We've seen through the polls
[03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:08.713]  That that percentage of ISIS supporters from these countries in some cases is as high as 20%.
[03:58:08.793 --> 03:58:12.075]  They're arresting them on a regular basis.
[03:58:12.555 --> 03:58:13.676]  Who are they not arresting?
[03:58:13.996 --> 03:58:17.218]  Who's slipping through that could cause massive damage?
[03:58:18.138 --> 03:58:22.541]  New York Times columnist calls it striking how little evidence there is for Trump-Russia collusion.
[03:58:22.621 --> 03:58:24.282]  They're having to admit that finally.
[03:58:25.373 --> 03:58:28.614]  Again, a bunch of other stories available at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:28.634 --> 03:58:29.654]  We've run out of time, though.
[03:58:29.674 --> 03:58:33.296]  Please support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:34.196 --> 03:58:37.557]  Now is more critical than ever to really have our back.
[03:58:37.597 --> 03:58:38.777]  That's going to wrap up the show.
[03:58:38.857 --> 03:58:41.298]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:45.620 --> 03:58:49.561]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.599 --> 03:58:56.002]  It looks like the Summer of Rage has claimed another victim.
[03:58:56.382 --> 03:58:57.964]  Report on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:58.284 --> 03:59:01.268]  Armenian gang stabs prominent Trump activist.
[03:59:01.288 --> 03:59:08.316]  27-year-old Tony Freeman was stabbed by a gang of Armenians who noticed his pro-Trump bumper sticker on his car after they rammed his vehicle.
[03:59:08.656 --> 03:59:12.621]  After the ramming, the gang members noticed his Gadsden flag and American flag bumper stickers.
[03:59:12.961 --> 03:59:14.902]  And proceeded to stab him nine times.
[03:59:15.402 --> 03:59:19.785]  Mr. Freeman was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he remains in critical condition.
[03:59:20.105 --> 03:59:23.487]  And you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund at WeSearcher.
[03:59:23.827 --> 03:59:33.533]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack as racially motivated, but we've seen the many statements from Tim Cain calling for fights in the streets to Loretta Lynch calling for marching, blood, and death in the streets.
[03:59:34.133 --> 03:59:44.639]  Democratic leaders across the country, from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton to Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, are all calling for people to rise up and resist this summer, during the Summer of Rage.
[03:59:45.079 --> 03:59:46.200]  Who will be the next victim?
[03:59:46.480 --> 03:59:47.941]  Watch your back, or it may be you.
[03:59:48.521 --> 03:59:51.603]  Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:59:55.685 --> 03:59:59.667]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
