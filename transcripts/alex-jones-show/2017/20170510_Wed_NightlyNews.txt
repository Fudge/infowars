[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.677]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:23.279]  It is Wednesday, May 10th, 2017.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.360]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:26.923]  I'm Owen Schroeder, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:35.320]  Welcome to another Liberal Meltdown!
[00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:48.352]  The establishment Democrats and Hollywood elite are severely butthurt over President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.
[00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:49.913]  But wait a minute!
[00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:57.997]  They used to be mad at Comey for exposing Crooked Hillary, but now they are suddenly rushing to his rescue.
[00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:09.042]  Meanwhile, the talking heads get the memo and Stephen Colbert corrects his audience after they cheer and applaud Trump's firing of James Comey.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.130]  All that plus Rand Paul says the Trump-Russian conspiracy is a total myth.
[00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.652]  True that.
[00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.978]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.749]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.489]  I take this.
[00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.790]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.113]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:47.616]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.340]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.461]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.064]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.947]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:05.371]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.194]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.177]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.479]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.900]  I love it.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.644]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:18.805]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:24.794]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.436]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.899]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:08.094]  Well, the big news today, of course, is James Comey has been fired as the FBI director.
[00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:13.438]  But really, it's the reaction from the left that has just caught everyone off guard.
[00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:17.000]  Now, for months and months, they were calling for James Comey to be fired.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.203]  They were insisting that President Obama get rid of him before he left the White House.
[00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:22.744]  Of course, he did not do that.
[00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.747]  Now that President Trump has said, you're fired.
[00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.589]  Everyone is in an uproar about this.
[00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.010]  They've totally flip-flopped.
[00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.594]  Even President Trump has called him out saying, man, they've been calling for him to be removed from office for months.
[00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:38.515]  Now they play so sad.
[00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:41.617]  Calling out specifically Chuck Schumer there.
[00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.038]  Owen, what do you think about this?
[00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:51.725]  I mean, celebrities are literally melting down over this when they were calling because they believed that Comey threw the election for their precious Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:53.009]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.252]  I've actually got some quotes here, and there's so many of them, it's like, where do you even begin?
[00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:08.238]  But yes, the story quickly went from James Comey being fired to, oh my gosh, look at how blatantly hypocritical the political left is in America.
[00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:20.385]  And actually, on the Hill today, the official White House released, they just put out some flyers today on the Hill that quoted Chuck Schumer, a quote from Chuck Schumer on Comey,
[00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.601]  Senator Schumer said he does not have confidence in Comey any longer.
[00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:32.644]  Also, Senator Schumer on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he has developed a reputation for integrity.
[00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:35.746]  He has promised to give this careful consideration.
[00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:40.808]  So that's the guy who had a part in getting Comey out, apparently, who he says, I respect this guy.
[00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:44.450]  Then he also says he has no confidence in Comey anymore.
[00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.676]  But this is the same Chuck Schumer now that is saying, oh my gosh, he's crying.
[00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:51.017]  I cannot believe.
[00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.459]  I cannot believe.
[00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.764]  Yes, here's the here's the official thing that was released today on the Hill.
[00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:58.126]  I cannot believe this.
[00:04:58.947 --> 00:05:00.669]  I cannot believe they got rid of Comey.
[00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:02.386]  Well, and the same thing, too.
[00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:12.012]  Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign actually came out panning President Trump's decision to fire Comey when they are the ones that... Yeah, they started the narrative.
[00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:32.125]  Yes.
[00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:51.075]  I don't know.
[00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.414]  Conspiracy theory about Russia and how this is terrible.
[00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:22.542]  But that's just perfect example of the authentic reaction from a lot of people across the board was to celebrate James Comey being fired.
[00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:24.484]  Finally, someone being held accountable.
[00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.887]  And Colbert says, wait a minute.
[00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:27.388]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:28.409]  We flip flopped on that.
[00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.570]  That's not how we feel anymore.
[00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:37.595]  Well, and it also displays how the left, or the constituents of the left, or the audience of the Colbert Report, or whatever it is, are just total lemmings.
[00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.517]  They're just hearsay mafia, drive-by media viewers.
[00:06:40.597 --> 00:06:45.440]  Right, because at first he's like, no, don't, and then they're like, oh, okay, and then they start booing Trump.
[00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.501]  Oh, oh, boo!
[00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:47.722]  Well, I'm thinking about it, too.
[00:06:47.742 --> 00:06:48.963]  What do we do, Colbert?
[00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:56.388]  You know, and because of all the madness surrounding this, nobody's really talked about, or at least, I guess actually it's being painted in the opposite light,
[00:06:57.108 --> 00:06:58.549]  That this was kind of expected.
[00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.410]  That everybody in Washington was expecting this.
[00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.272]  Everybody was expecting Comey to be fired.
[00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:04.333]  But you know who wasn't expecting it?
[00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.915]  Because they don't get the truth from the media pundits they follow.
[00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:09.877]  That's the constituents of Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:10.117 --> 00:07:12.278]  That's the Never Trumpers in the drive-by media audience.
[00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:13.860]  They didn't know this was coming.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.561]  They didn't know Comey was getting fired.
[00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:22.823]  So, when they first heard this, the last time they tuned in, the last time they heard anything about Comey, it was, fire Comey!
[00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:23.903]  He's incompetent.
[00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.604]  He caused Hillary the election.
[00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:26.364]  He should resign.
[00:07:26.604 --> 00:07:27.785]  So that was the last they heard.
[00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:31.746]  But now that Trump fired him, oh my gosh, now, oh, it's a good thing.
[00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:32.426]  That was the last we heard.
[00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:34.446]  But no, it's not a good thing now, see?
[00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.108]  It's not a good thing because Trump is impeding the investigation.
[00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:38.928]  And let's just remember,
[00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:47.477]  It wasn't too long ago that Hillary came out and made a speech where she took responsibility for the lost but blamed James Comey.
[00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:47.877]  Right.
[00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:51.422]  She took responsibility while blaming James Comey.
[00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:52.503]  Here's some other quotes for you.
[00:07:52.543 --> 00:07:53.765]  Maxine Waters on Comey.
[00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:55.286]  He has no credibility.
[00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:56.588]  That was in January.
[00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:57.910]  Here's one from November.
[00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.691]  Nancy Pelosi.
[00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:00.971]  Maybe he's not right for the job.
[00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:01.872]  Harry Reid.
[00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:02.932]  Comey should resign.
[00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:04.012]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:07.453]  I think it would not be a bad thing for the American people if he did step down.
[00:08:07.873 --> 00:08:09.434]  All of these people calling for it.
[00:08:09.694 --> 00:08:10.534]  It doesn't stop there.
[00:08:10.714 --> 00:08:11.594]  It went on to the news.
[00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:12.574]  The Daily Beast.
[00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:14.495]  Harry Reid says Comey should resign.
[00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:15.115]  They love that.
[00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:15.895]  CNN.
[00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:17.936]  Time for FBI Director Comey to go.
[00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:19.656]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:20.976]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:22.157]  Comey should resign.
[00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:23.397]  Think Progress.
[00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.037]  The case for firing James Comey.
[00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:27.078]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:32.583]  Right, and so they were really ramping this up because everyone thought that James Comey was safe.
[00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:43.755]  You know, he was supposed to serve a 10-year term there as the FBI director, and they thought, you know, after he clearly threw the election for President Trump, that he was safe.
[00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:49.000]  So that's why they still felt comfortable kind of making the case that he should be fired, he should be let go.
[00:08:49.841 --> 00:09:02.564]  When in fact it actually happened, then they're all stepping back and blaming Trump and saying that this is now a part of the Russian conspiracy because he was investigating alleged ties with Russia.
[00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:06.124]  Even James Comey first thought that his firing was a prank.
[00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:17.887]  According to some people that were there in the building, they saw it appear on the television behind James Comey while he was giving a speech, while he was talking with some agents, and they thought that
[00:09:18.747 --> 00:09:19.708]  We're good to go.
[00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:49.847]  Just freaking out saying we, this is Minnesota representative Keith Ellison, we are witnessing a constitutional crisis unfold before our very eyes.
[00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:56.632]  Basically saying that the FBI director was investigating Trump and the next day Trump decides to fire him.
[00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:58.354]  Does anyone see what's going on here?
[00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:09.601]  Marky says, this episode is disturbingly reminiscent of the Saturday Night Massacre during the Watergate scandal and the national turmoil that it caused.
[00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:20.268]  We're careening ever closer to a constitutional crisis, which they're using that buzzword again, constitutional crisis, because they're trying to make the case that this could set the precedent for impeaching Trump.
[00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:25.992]  Him firing Comey, even though that's what they've all been calling for, for months and
[00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:29.173]  No, they haven't.
[00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:34.896]  It's not like Louise Mensch tweeted on April 13th of this year that Comey is going to fire Trump.
[00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:37.657]  Louise Mensch never tweeted that, guys.
[00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:38.557]  She never tweeted it.
[00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:39.998]  Louise Mensch never did it, guys.
[00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:41.799]  I don't know what you're talking about, Leigh-Anne.
[00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:43.539]  But she wasn't the only one.
[00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:44.080]  It goes on.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.642]  Keith Olbermann was another one who was tweeting nonstop about how much he couldn't
[00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:51.025]  Keith Olbermann.
[00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:51.906]  The resistance.
[00:10:52.226 --> 00:10:54.748]  The resistance with Keith Olbermann.
[00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:57.150]  He's resisting his own logic apparently.
[00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:06.396]  He tweets dozens of times, literally, about how Comey needs to resign, how Comey needs to be fired.
[00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:07.817]  He's let everybody down.
[00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:09.158]  You can go look at the tweets.
[00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:13.762]  And then today he calls Trump an MF-er for firing Comey.
[00:11:14.623 --> 00:11:15.383]  They're crazy!
[00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:17.325]  They are crazy.
[00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:24.912]  This is all due to the fact that they have totally committed to this Russia collusion conspiracy theory.
[00:11:25.212 --> 00:11:30.517]  They're all never Trumpers, and so they have to be able to say, see, we were right.
[00:11:30.597 --> 00:11:32.219]  We told you you shouldn't have elected Trump.
[00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:37.684]  See, he has this Russian collusion, even though, again, under oath, even Sally Yates and
[00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:39.605]  James Clapper.
[00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.546]  James Clapper, Comey.
[00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:43.066]  James Comey, yeah, all of them.
[00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:45.426]  No evidence, no evidence, no evidence.
[00:11:45.686 --> 00:11:53.968]  And so Rand Paul is actually calling all these people out saying there's a lot of hypocrisy there in Washington, a lot of crocodile tears over this.
[00:11:54.528 --> 00:11:57.189]  Comey firing couldn't happen soon enough.
[00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:01.890]  Tucker Carlson's show, he says the Comey firing was overdue.
[00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.750]  Everyone in Washington knows it.
[00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.851]  Here is a report
[00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:07.945]  We're good to go.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.000]  Right, and this is stuff we've reported on.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:30.782]  So before he bombed the Boston Marathon, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Sarnieff, but they let him go.
[00:12:31.402 --> 00:12:44.466]  Russia said- Hold on, I want to stop, and let's keep in mind too, not only did the FBI let him go, the FBI then also released the picture of, at the time, the unknown suspect, and didn't even know it was him!
[00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:44.866]  Right.
[00:12:45.926 --> 00:12:53.574]  And when Russia sent the Obama administration a second warning saying, hey, you should check into this guy, the FBI opted against investigating him again.
[00:12:55.016 --> 00:13:02.263]  Shortly after the NSA scandal exploded in 2013, the FBI was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent Americans.
[00:13:03.004 --> 00:13:04.765]  And they retained that material for decades.
[00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:11.968]  The FBI had possession of emails sent by Nidal Hassan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the Taliban.
[00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:13.788]  The FBI didn't intervene.
[00:13:14.349 --> 00:13:19.251]  And so many people argue that that resulted in the death of 31 Americans at Fort Hood.
[00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:22.012]  It could have been prevented if the FBI would have done their job!
[00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:35.625]  Also, during the Obama administration, the FBI claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, but in fact they were mostly being used for Eric Holder and Robert Mueller's business and personal travel.
[00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:36.466]  Hmm.
[00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:43.494]  They demanded Apple create a backdoor that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects.
[00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:44.314]  We're good to go.
[00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:14.090]  And then so in 2015, the FBI conducted a controversial raid on a Texas political meeting, fingerprinting, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees.
[00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:21.397]  And that was the people, some in the group, believe in restoring Texas as an independent constitutional republic.
[00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:23.118]  So that there, that controversial raid,
[00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:36.394]  During the investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified material, the FBI made an unusual deal in which Clinton aides were both given immunity and they were allowed to destroy their laptops.
[00:14:36.874 --> 00:14:37.515]  So this, again,
[00:14:40.037 --> 00:14:47.419]  So the father of the radical Islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in New York City in 2016 alerted the FBI to his son's radicalization.
[00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:49.580]  The FBI did nothing.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.020]  After a brief interview, they're like, yeah, he's fine.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.721]  I'm sure he's, you know, he means what he says.
[00:14:54.181 --> 00:15:00.302]  They also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people, wounded 53 more at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
[00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:02.823]  And that was also a 10-month investigation.
[00:15:02.883 --> 00:15:06.184]  That was also a direct Hillary Clinton State Department stand down on him as well.
[00:15:06.464 --> 00:15:06.644]  Right.
[00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:10.522]  And then, last one here, I'm sure there's many others.
[00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:24.025]  CBS recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill Americans attending the Draw Muhammad event in Garland, Texas, the FBI not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but they actually had an undercover agent traveling with the Islamists.
[00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:30.427]  The FBI refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack.
[00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:33.168]  So these are just some of the examples of
[00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:41.698]  How the FBI, some of Comey's biggest embarrassments at the FBI and why Rand Paul and others are saying this was long overdue.
[00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:43.140]  Everyone in Washington knows it.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.201]  It's ridiculous.
[00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:51.851]  And here's James Comey, who has the most powerful investigation bureau on planet Earth at his behest, at his will.
[00:15:52.942 --> 00:16:03.686]  And, you know, he can't even get an investigation done properly into what seems like anything, let alone the Russian collusion that they've been searching for for months so desperately.
[00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:07.347]  And I'll get back to these real quick because I want to mention something here.
[00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:08.548]  But isn't it amazing, Leanne?
[00:16:09.721 --> 00:16:15.504]  The Democrats have been crying Russia, Russia, Russia for months now.
[00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:16.965]  I mean, they're convinced.
[00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:17.645]  They're convinced.
[00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.286]  You listen to them.
[00:16:18.346 --> 00:16:21.467]  Impeachment, Trump is a Russian operative, all of it.
[00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:23.028]  They are completely convinced.
[00:16:23.068 --> 00:16:24.249]  Maxine Waters still.
[00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:28.231]  Why they're convinced, nobody knows yet because nobody else has seen the evidence that makes them convinced.
[00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:29.252]  But they're convinced.
[00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:33.014]  But if they're so vindicated by this belief that Trump is colluding with Russia,
[00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:49.804]  Why do they support James Comey, again, who has the most powerful investigation bureau on planet Earth at his behest, and he can't provide anything, nothing, zero, zero for the Trump-Russia narrative, and why would they be complaining?
[00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:50.665]  He let you down.
[00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:51.486]  Comey let you down.
[00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:53.987]  It shows how, really, it's just whatever Trump says they hate.
[00:16:54.247 --> 00:17:02.533]  But here's the other thing, another thing that the left should have actually loved about Comey, maybe this is why they're crying, clearly he was a politically correct FBI investigator.
[00:17:02.853 --> 00:17:08.356]  Clearly he didn't want to investigate into the Sanyev brothers because he didn't want to be looked at as an Islamophobe.
[00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:10.136]  The same thing goes down the stretch.
[00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.037]  The eventual Fort Hood shooter.
[00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:14.078]  Omar Mateen.
[00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:15.179]  The list goes on and on.
[00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:23.902]  So here's the politically correct James Comey who won't investigate any radical Islamic terrorist ties because, well, he doesn't want to be politically correct.
[00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:26.184]  So that should be good for the liberal left.
[00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:32.416]  And they all applauded him when he said that there, you know, there was no evidence of wrongdoing there with Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:40.226]  You know, we did allow her to destroy their laptops and their evidence, and we granted them immunity, but after a brief investigation, no wrongdoing.
[00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:40.847]  Here's the left.
[00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:41.308]  Okay.
[00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.392]  Hillary Clinton is guilty as sin.
[00:17:45.373 --> 00:17:47.354]  Evidence pouring through the roof.
[00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:48.235]  It's absurd.
[00:17:48.315 --> 00:17:49.636]  The roof is collapsing.
[00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:59.783]  There's so much evidence on top of this case But Comey lets her off the hook Let's her off the hook right and then the left complains.
[00:18:00.223 --> 00:18:01.664]  They blame Comey for her loss
[00:18:01.744 --> 00:18:02.064]  I don't
[00:18:19.124 --> 00:18:20.224]  They want Comey back.
[00:18:20.324 --> 00:18:25.786]  And Trump only fired him because Comey was actually going to do some more investigating into this Russian collusion.
[00:18:26.047 --> 00:18:26.947]  And that's the big story.
[00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:33.189]  And here, just kind of to end this, this is coming out of the Washington Post, so we know this is the CIA's front front paper.
[00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:40.452]  They're saying Comey sought more resources for Russia probe days before he was fired by President Trump, officials say.
[00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:44.796]  And so these, according to two officials, who are these officials?
[00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:53.286]  But then the Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Flores, said reports that he had requested more funding, totally false.
[00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:56.710]  So they're just putting out this false narrative to underscore that Russian lie.
[00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.412]  Stick around, we'll have more on this coming up.
[00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:09.358]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:16.004]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:33.540]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.364]  It works.
[00:19:40.645 --> 00:19:48.930]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:58.517]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[00:19:58.857 --> 00:19:59.477]  A total 360 win.
[00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.209]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:05.290]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.751]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.193]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:12.793]  I'm 42.
[00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.715]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.356]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:20.437]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:21.117]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:21.718]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:28.961]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:36.785]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:40.286]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:46.933]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:50.056]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.738]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:53.320]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.541]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.561 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.090]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:10.054]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:10.074 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.258]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.382]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:33.349]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:37.133]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:44.920]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.343]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my own thing.
[00:21:48.363 --> 00:21:50.125]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:58.484]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action, no fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:06.486]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.848]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:20.117]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:21.418]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.478 --> 00:22:27.562]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.065]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:33.307]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.413]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:44.776]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:47.658]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.758 --> 00:22:53.163]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.843 --> 00:23:00.726]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[00:23:02.427 --> 00:23:04.228]  FBI Director James Comey.
[00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:07.129]  Are you going to ask for his resignation?
[00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.032]  I think that I would rather not comment on that yet.
[00:23:13.072 --> 00:23:14.793]  I haven't made up my mind.
[00:23:19.355 --> 00:23:23.476]  Huge story that broke just minutes ago, like less than 10 minutes ago.
[00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:31.377]  FBI Director James Comey has just been fired by Donald Trump.
[00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:34.978]  Huge, huge Donald Trump fans here tonight.
[00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:38.138]  Do you believe that Jim Comey should resign, Senator Reid?
[00:23:38.979 --> 00:23:39.459]  Of course.
[00:23:39.479 --> 00:23:40.359]  Yes.
[00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.979]  It's classified and we can't tell you anything.
[00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:46.700]  All I can tell you is the FBI director has no credibility.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.820]  Well, first of all, let's start again.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.941]  He was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans.
[00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:54.802]  End of story.
[00:23:54.922 --> 00:24:06.946]  I'm just saying Director Comey testified this week and he made it very plain that he broke the FBI rules with respect to the Clinton campaign and he chose not to break the rules with respect to the Trump campaign.
[00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:10.487]  But I think it will go down as probably the lowest moment in...
[00:24:11.758 --> 00:24:12.638]  Should he step down?
[00:24:38.484 --> 00:24:46.335]  I think he should take a hard look at what he has done, and I think it would not be a bad thing for the American people if he did step down.
[00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:51.442]  My confidence in the FBI Director's ability to lead this agency has been shaken.
[00:24:51.682 --> 00:24:55.688]  And then at least one Democratic lawmaker is calling on Comey to resign.
[00:24:56.128 --> 00:25:02.814]  And Director Comey's supposed to be an investigator who reports to the Justice Department and not somebody who comes out and makes news himself.
[00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:04.496]  He's gone too far.
[00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:11.001]  When I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this.
[00:25:13.544 --> 00:25:20.490]  Earlier this afternoon, President Trump called me and informed me he was firing Director Comey.
[00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.434]  I told the President.
[00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:27.449]  Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistake.
[00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.291]  Wrong!
[00:25:31.493 --> 00:25:32.973]  Hollywood, California.
[00:25:33.174 --> 00:25:52.860]  Home of a distant history of the Red Scare Blacklist, now East Bay San Francisco Assemblyman Rob Bonta is pushing the relaxation of the laws set up to deter the Reds in our midst by eliminating the California law requiring the termination of communists from state government jobs.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:26:00.042]  Bonta bases his argument according to the ancient Red Scare hysteria that happened bygones ago.
[00:26:00.322 --> 00:26:02.484]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
[00:26:02.944 --> 00:26:18.755]  AB 22 is a cleanup bill that removes archaic and outdated references to the Communist Party in our state law, specifically those stating that a public employee may be dismissed from employment if he or she advocates or is knowingly a member of the Communist Party.
[00:26:18.895 --> 00:26:27.861]  These archaic references should be removed from existing law and updated so that the law focuses on the actions of individuals and evidence of their conduct.
[00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:29.102]  I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
[00:26:29.762 --> 00:26:33.205]  Huntington Beach Assemblyman Travis Allen disagreed.
[00:26:33.545 --> 00:26:34.426]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[00:26:34.947 --> 00:26:37.809]  This bill is blatantly offensive to all Californians.
[00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:45.216]  In my district alone, we have the Vietnamese Americans who had to flee a communist regime, which is why they're now in Orange County.
[00:26:45.696 --> 00:26:51.281]  You take a look at the number of people that communism has killed in the 20th century alone, it's over 90 million.
[00:26:51.762 --> 00:26:56.226]  Communism stands for everything that the United States stands against.
[00:26:57.401 --> 00:26:58.142]  We're for freedom.
[00:26:58.643 --> 00:26:59.484]  We're for justice.
[00:26:59.624 --> 00:27:00.646]  We're for democracy.
[00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:01.848]  We're for the rule of law.
[00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:03.230]  And communism is none of these things.
[00:27:03.671 --> 00:27:05.093]  To allow subversives
[00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:13.923]  An avowed communist to now work for the state of California is a direct insult to the people of California who pay for that government.
[00:27:13.943 --> 00:27:14.643]  I urge a no vote.
[00:27:14.923 --> 00:27:19.685]  Mr. Bonta, Sacramento is roughly 80 miles from Berkeley, California.
[00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:23.866]  Did Bonta happen to notice the communist activity flaring up there?
[00:27:24.126 --> 00:27:31.948]  And what it could mean to California if Soros-funded communist politicians flood the already leftist California legislature?
[00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:53.492]  The Daily Caller reported back in February of 2017 during the Milo riots, the left-wing group that helped organize the violent shutdown of Milo Yiannopoulos' event at the University of California, Berkeley on Wednesday is backed by a progressive charity that is in turn funded by George Soros, a major labor union, and several large companies.
[00:27:53.732 --> 00:28:01.734]  The Alliance for Global Justice, based in Tucson, is listed as an organizer and fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism.
[00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:05.677]  A communist group that encouraged left-wingers to shut down the event.
[00:28:05.897 --> 00:28:15.324]  According to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice received $2.2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016.
[00:28:16.224 --> 00:28:19.527]  One of the group's biggest donors is the Tides Foundation.
[00:28:19.787 --> 00:28:24.210]  A non-profit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros.
[00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.091]  Tides gave AFGJ $50,000.
[00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:30.533]  The United Steelworkers Labor Union also contributed $5,000.
[00:28:30.894 --> 00:28:36.597]  The city of Tucson is also listed in AFGJ's 990 as a donor.
[00:28:36.817 --> 00:28:44.261]  But a city official says the city acted merely as a pass-through for a Native American tribe that provided a grant for the activist group.
[00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:47.904]  The city official said that no city money went to AFGJ.
[00:28:48.604 --> 00:28:51.528]  Does Bonta understand what Antifa is?
[00:28:51.828 --> 00:28:52.609]  Does anybody?
[00:28:52.789 --> 00:29:07.127]  Historian Norman Davies details in his book Europe at War 1939-1945 No Simple Victory that anti-fascism does not offer a coherent political ideology, but rather that it is an empty vessel
[00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:24.335]  And that the concept of anti-fascism is a mere political dance created by Joseph Stalin and spread by Soviet propaganda in the attempt to create false impressions that Western democracies could align themselves with Soviet Russia in the opposition to fascism.
[00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:36.581]  If Bonta's bill makes it through the California Senate, at the very least, California will be gradually influenced by the growing mechanizations of George Soros' anti-American political subversion.
[00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:42.685]  But at the most extreme, California could be facing a full-scale communist revolution.
[00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:44.726]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:51.370]  We will keep this promise to the American people.
[00:29:52.231 --> 00:29:55.553]  If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor.
[00:29:56.053 --> 00:29:57.434]  Period.
[00:29:57.874 --> 00:30:04.859]  The same guy that thinks there's giant wasp under the UN building, Alex Jones, says that you can't keep your doctor and that there's death panels.
[00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:11.640]  You like your plan, you keep your plan.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.804]  You like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
[00:30:16.985 --> 00:30:19.987]  You like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[00:30:20.768 --> 00:30:21.148]  Period.
[00:30:22.369 --> 00:30:32.278]  For the average person, many folks who don't have health insurance initially, they're going to have to make some choices and they might end up having to switch doctors.
[00:30:33.939 --> 00:30:35.520]  We got sacked really hard.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.942]  We couldn't afford health insurance.
[00:30:37.342 --> 00:30:39.364]  Tried to get on Obamacare, couldn't afford it.
[00:30:39.844 --> 00:30:42.486]  So, we got a huge penalty this year.
[00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.249]  My insurance has more than doubled.
[00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:58.360]  My parents, who haven't had a claim in decades, who have full coverage for catastrophic events, who pay their regular doctor bills, saw it double the first year, and then now it's almost doubled again.
[00:30:59.554 --> 00:31:05.259]  Premiums under Obamacare went up an average of 24% across the country this year.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.821]  Joining us is Zeke Emanuel.
[00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:12.745]  He is one of the architects of Obamacare, and every time he joins us, he smiles.
[00:31:12.946 --> 00:31:18.751]  I've seen you so many times smile your way through this failure, I am insisting on having my say.
[00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:21.933]  17 states have one or two healthcare coverages.
[00:31:21.953 --> 00:31:22.554]  Then you don't need me!
[00:31:22.574 --> 00:31:23.515]  You don't need me in the studio!
[00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.298]  If you want your stay, you don't need me in the studio.
[00:31:26.398 --> 00:31:30.383]  If you want me to answer your child... Tell me you're true, but I'm waiting for the apology, which I'm not gonna get.
[00:31:30.443 --> 00:31:38.792]  So tell me, how do you explain there are five states with one health care coverage, and there are 17 states with this one or two?
[00:31:39.413 --> 00:31:40.514]  That's accurate, isn't it?
[00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:49.072]  Now, new data from the IRS reveals that in 2014, over 8 million Americans paid a staggering $1.7 billion in Obamacare penalties.
[00:31:56.696 --> 00:32:03.582]  The average number of insurers in each market has dropped from 5.9 in 2015 to 3.9 now.
[00:32:04.363 --> 00:32:21.096]  Professor Gruber, in Iowa, there is now only one insurance company left in all but five counties in Iowa, and they just announced Medica that they're thinking of dropping out, which means there'd be no insurance companies for the marketplace in all but five counties in Iowa.
[00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:23.397]  Look, and whose fault is this?
[00:32:23.797 --> 00:32:29.060]  Before President Trump was elected, there were no counties in America that did not have an insurer.
[00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:36.125]  Since President Trump's been elected, and massively... Wait, you're going to blame the problems with Obamacare on President Trump?
[00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:38.192]  Great!
[00:32:38.812 --> 00:32:39.793]  And it's really working!
[00:32:41.054 --> 00:32:43.597]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:32:44.157 --> 00:32:47.300]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[00:32:47.821 --> 00:32:51.625]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.987]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.047 --> 00:33:05.008]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.148 --> 00:33:06.590]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.711]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:08.632]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.032 --> 00:33:11.235]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:13.157]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.177 --> 00:33:16.781]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately, your clinics.
[00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:17.462]  MycoCX.
[00:33:18.183 --> 00:33:18.803]  We're good to go.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.044]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:49.644]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:53.827]  So, we've been doing research just like you have on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.088 --> 00:34:01.453]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... And we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:04.656]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:13.203]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:16.145]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.185 --> 00:34:18.607]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.627 --> 00:34:20.329]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:27.912]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:37.197]  I've had nobody, here's the thing Alex, when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.757 --> 00:34:40.679]  It's going to show, you're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:45.402]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:45.883]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:46.843]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:48.124]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:48.705]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:49.866]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:51.887]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.689]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:56.230]  Yeast overgrowth.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.933]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:05.597]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:07.218]  What doctor?
[00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.380]  By the way, folks, look, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:11.162]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:12.724]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:14.606]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.726 --> 00:35:15.728]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:17.930]  Listen, this is religious for me.
[00:35:19.432 --> 00:35:21.975]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe it.
[00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:26.761]  If we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:28.763]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:29.904]  I'm ready to give my life.
[00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.085]  Everybody knows that against the enemy.
[00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.066]  Please.
[00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:34.328]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:35.469]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.290]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.210]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:42.235]  MycoZX antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.295 --> 00:35:43.035]  Get it today.
[00:35:43.136 --> 00:35:43.596]  Limited run.
[00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:44.617]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.759]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:48.901]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.921 --> 00:35:50.863]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great!
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:14.889]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:24.135]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swirl, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:24.895]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:27.497]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:29.138]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[00:36:29.378 --> 00:36:32.720]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.220]  That's amazing.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.900]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.162]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.182 --> 00:36:38.423]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:40.123]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.183 --> 00:36:41.284]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.304 --> 00:36:42.885]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:50.308]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:51.289]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:53.310]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.019]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.059 --> 00:36:58.801]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.941 --> 00:36:59.903]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.502 --> 00:37:04.303]  Drain the swamp?
[00:37:04.663 --> 00:37:10.026]  We're going to have to drain the privilege out of Washington first, because that's what the swamp feeds on, their privilege.
[00:37:10.547 --> 00:37:15.090]  I think a good example of this is what we see Obama doing the last couple of days and what we reported on last week.
[00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.391]  But I want you to see the bigger picture.
[00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:27.618]  I want you to see how even when the Republicans talked about reforming Obamacare, they were immediately hit upon because they carved out exemptions for themselves.
[00:37:27.698 --> 00:37:28.739]  Same thing the Democrats did.
[00:37:28.939 --> 00:37:29.820]  Remember the first time around?
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.122]  It's like, oh, the Congress isn't covered in this health care plan.
[00:37:33.662 --> 00:37:48.068]  They've got a Cadillac plan of their own, and yes they do have a Cadillac pension plan of their own as well, and we're going to take a look at some of the privileges of presidents, but I think it's time that we look at this and understand that it kind of comes with the territory.
[00:37:48.088 --> 00:37:55.171]  You know, if you're going to act like a king, as a dictator, as a pharaoh, then it's kind of hard to give all that stuff up when you leave Washington.
[00:37:55.712 --> 00:37:56.792]  Let's take a look at Obama.
[00:37:56.812 --> 00:38:00.594]  Of course he's going to Milan, Italy, talking about climate change.
[00:38:01.354 --> 00:38:06.775]  Preaching about seed and chips, the Global Food Innovation Summit in the city of Milan.
[00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:09.836]  And of course, this all has to do with climate change and food.
[00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:16.478]  We should all remember that the socialist policies that Obama promotes are what are wrecking Venezuela.
[00:38:16.638 --> 00:38:17.618]  The people there can't eat.
[00:38:17.658 --> 00:38:19.719]  So you want to talk about global food innovation?
[00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:27.101]  When you lock up the resources, one of the richest oil reserves in the world, in Venezuela, is locked up by the elite.
[00:38:27.782 --> 00:38:29.982]  And the rest of the people can starve in the streets.
[00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:31.263]  That's what they have in mind for you.
[00:38:31.363 --> 00:38:36.765]  And of course we see this entourage that he goes to this climate change summit with.
[00:38:36.885 --> 00:38:41.446]  Okay, we've seen all these celebrities in the past that have done the same sort of thing.
[00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:42.407]  This hypocrisy.
[00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:43.847]  Takes a private jet to Milan.
[00:38:44.207 --> 00:38:45.928]  Then he has a 14-car convoy.
[00:38:46.528 --> 00:38:47.349]  That goes on the city.
[00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.591]  All these people to protect him.
[00:38:49.292 --> 00:38:50.273]  300 police officers.
[00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.056]  Even protection from a helicopter above.
[00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:55.520]  All of those resources dedicated to a president.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.823]  But it's not just Barack Obama.
[00:38:58.786 --> 00:39:00.827]  We saw this article from CNN.
[00:39:00.947 --> 00:39:03.367]  Being ex-president can be a lucrative gig.
[00:39:03.387 --> 00:39:04.628]  Yes, it is a lucrative gig.
[00:39:04.668 --> 00:39:08.129]  They say when a president leaves the White House, he's still on the government payroll.
[00:39:08.489 --> 00:39:13.631]  He not only gets an annual pension of about $200,000, he also gets healthcare.
[00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:14.631]  Yes, healthcare.
[00:39:15.031 --> 00:39:19.633]  He also gets all kinds of official travel benefits and an office.
[00:39:20.033 --> 00:39:23.834]  Bill Clinton's office in the pricey real estate market of New York, reports CNN,
[00:39:25.114 --> 00:39:27.836]  is $516,000 a year.
[00:39:28.036 --> 00:39:28.897]  That's what he pays in rent.
[00:39:29.678 --> 00:39:37.083]  And this is a guy who, off a book deal, just one book deal, My Life, got a $15 million advance from the publisher.
[00:39:37.603 --> 00:39:43.387]  George W. Bush got $7 million for the first 1.5 million copies of his Decision Points.
[00:39:43.847 --> 00:39:46.869]  And of course, Jimmy Carter has already written 14 books.
[00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:48.891]  But they say the biggest payoff of all
[00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:50.412]  Are the speeches.
[00:39:51.012 --> 00:39:58.917]  And there again, Bill Clinton has been the reigning king of the podium, as of last year, but of course now the new king is going to be Obama.
[00:39:58.937 --> 00:40:00.077]  Maybe we should say Pharaoh.
[00:40:00.678 --> 00:40:08.162]  Right after Clinton left the White House in 2001, reports said, and the Greater Washington Association of Executives paid him $125,000 for a speech.
[00:40:09.183 --> 00:40:15.467]  And he told Wolf Blitzer, I've never had any money till I got out of the White House, but I've done reasonably well since then.
[00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:20.887]  So he's not raping women anymore, he's raping all taxpayers, male and female.
[00:40:21.758 --> 00:40:23.219]  Raping is stealing our money.
[00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:29.584]  The Center for Public Integrity estimates that George W. Bush had $15 million from speeches since leaving office.
[00:40:29.624 --> 00:40:31.225]  And this goes all the way back to Ronald Reagan.
[00:40:31.785 --> 00:40:33.586]  Right after he left office, he went to Japan.
[00:40:33.646 --> 00:40:37.269]  He made $2 million for two speeches in Japan.
[00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:39.951]  But it doesn't just end with the money.
[00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:44.614]  That's the money that they're quote-unquote earning from books and from speeches.
[00:40:44.634 --> 00:40:46.415]  And we'll talk about those speeches in just a moment.
[00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:48.396]  What's really behind that?
[00:40:48.956 --> 00:40:50.477]  But look at the rest of the stuff that they get.
[00:40:50.497 --> 00:40:53.097]  They get a million dollars per year in travel.
[00:40:53.137 --> 00:40:54.677]  This is from the National Taxpayers Union.
[00:40:54.717 --> 00:40:55.717]  This is a bit out of date.
[00:40:55.777 --> 00:40:57.378]  This is about four years old, this article.
[00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:01.058]  In addition, their spouse gets a half million dollars to travel.
[00:41:01.779 --> 00:41:04.279]  They get $150,000 per year on office staff.
[00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:05.399]  Again, that's outdated now.
[00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:13.881]  Any amount required for suitable office space and appropriate furnishings equipped anywhere in the United States that they wish to live.
[00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:15.701]  And if you look at this table they've got there,
[00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:19.262]  You can see things like telephone usage.
[00:41:19.362 --> 00:41:22.424]  They're getting $7,000 to $85,000 a year in phone bills paid for.
[00:41:22.484 --> 00:41:24.525]  George W. Bush had $85,000 in phone bills in 2012.
[00:41:24.585 --> 00:41:27.446]  Postage stamps, anywhere from $13,000 to $20,000 a year.
[00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.051]  This is snail mail, folks!
[00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:39.652]  I mean, what are they shipping around?
[00:41:39.692 --> 00:41:42.273]  Are they shipping massive containers of cocaine?
[00:41:42.594 --> 00:41:46.276]  How do they get that kind of shipping charges to use that kind of stuff?
[00:41:46.316 --> 00:41:47.256]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:41:47.697 --> 00:41:56.222]  And of course, going back to 2013 was the first time that Congressman Jason Chaffetz introduced a bill to rein in some of this insanity.
[00:41:56.262 --> 00:41:56.802]  It would have kept
[00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:59.903]  Pension benefits for former presidents at $200,000.
[00:41:59.963 --> 00:42:05.204]  It would have repealed the travel, the office expenses, the staff expenses, privileges, okay?
[00:42:05.224 --> 00:42:09.365]  It would reduce that kind of stuff by every dollar earned above $400,000.
[00:42:11.105 --> 00:42:11.785]  Think about this.
[00:42:11.805 --> 00:42:17.787]  When we talk about means testing this, think about your Social Security benefits that the government gives you.
[00:42:18.047 --> 00:42:19.247]  And of course, it's not a pension plan.
[00:42:19.947 --> 00:42:21.048]  It's not a retirement account.
[00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:22.810]  It is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:28.917]  If we go back to the original Social Security, it was created by the German politician Otto von Bismarck.
[00:42:29.037 --> 00:42:33.642]  He picked the age of 65 as the age at which you could start drawing benefits.
[00:42:33.762 --> 00:42:34.142]  Why?
[00:42:34.202 --> 00:42:37.006]  Because that was the life expectancy in Germany at the time.
[00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:43.096]  Social Security has always been a lie, but let's take a look at the actual benefits that you can expect to receive.
[00:42:43.676 --> 00:42:52.001]  The max you could get would be $28,000 a year if you earned the maximum contribution amount every year that you worked from the age of 21.
[00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:54.262]  How many of you are going to meet that test?
[00:42:54.562 --> 00:42:55.263]  I certainly wouldn't.
[00:42:55.871 --> 00:42:56.071]  Okay.
[00:43:16.622 --> 00:43:19.005]  They get $139,000 max.
[00:43:19.085 --> 00:43:20.246]  They can get an average of $55,000.
[00:43:20.707 --> 00:43:27.855]  So that's about five times what you're going to get from the government even though you paid 15% of your wages your entire life without any deduction.
[00:43:28.823 --> 00:43:34.649]  The presidents, on the other hand, are going to get anywhere from a half a million to one and a half million, which is what we've been seeing here.
[00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:40.935]  And I want to point out that we have had some honest congressmen like Ron Paul and Howard Coble of North Carolina.
[00:43:40.975 --> 00:43:44.979]  Howard Coble ran on reforming the pension plan.
[00:43:44.999 --> 00:43:47.542]  He campaigned against it in his first campaign plan.
[00:43:47.782 --> 00:43:50.184]  Ron Paul called it immoral and refused to take the money.
[00:43:51.007 --> 00:43:53.669]  But that's not the case with our former presidents.
[00:43:54.149 --> 00:44:01.014]  And we should remember that it was last July that Obama vetoed Chaffet's bill, which has been put up every year.
[00:44:01.394 --> 00:44:05.077]  He vetoed it last year, six months before he was going to be drawing it.
[00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:11.721]  And so we see that what happened was that was just the eleventh veto of his eight-year presidency.
[00:44:12.342 --> 00:44:12.982]  And it went through.
[00:44:13.663 --> 00:44:14.143]  And he said,
[00:44:15.544 --> 00:44:23.427]  He consulted with every living president on this bill, and they all agreed that they should have the money, that they're entitled to the money.
[00:44:23.467 --> 00:44:25.868]  That would be Carter, Clinton, and the two Bushes.
[00:44:26.508 --> 00:44:31.810]  Remember last week, we told you about Obama's half a billion dollar presidential center.
[00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.711]  It's not just a library, it's a full complex.
[00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:36.972]  He's going to have all kinds of educational stuff that's going to be going on there.
[00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:40.194]  He sees this as the beginning of a socialist foundation.
[00:44:40.874 --> 00:44:43.555]  That can push his revolution across the globe.
[00:44:43.575 --> 00:44:45.336]  It's going to have a museum, a library, a forum.
[00:44:46.156 --> 00:44:48.677]  It'll house an auditorium, a restaurant, a public garden.
[00:44:48.717 --> 00:44:49.958]  It'll have campuses here.
[00:44:50.178 --> 00:44:59.622]  And I think this is most appropriate, the sledding hill that Michelle Obama said she wanted to have in Chicago, because there's no place to sled in Chicago.
[00:44:59.642 --> 00:45:00.743]  But I think it's very appropriate.
[00:45:01.283 --> 00:45:07.146]  Because it is a picture of how America slid downhill during the Obama administration.
[00:45:07.406 --> 00:45:09.027]  That is the most appropriate thing.
[00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:11.969]  I would even contribute to that as an icon there.
[00:45:12.569 --> 00:45:15.370]  But of course what he's talking about is he's going to expand this, use that as a base.
[00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:20.033]  He's going to have partnerships, programs, digital initiatives, projects all over the city, the country, the world.
[00:45:20.053 --> 00:45:25.376]  So the release is going to inspire people to do change in their community.
[00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:37.518]  And he's going to have a massive teaching staff there, and I'm sure he'll be able to draw from the radical educationists like Bill Ayers that seem to be centered in Chicago.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:46:02.056]  So, with all this happening, and with President Obama dropping everybody's jaw with a new $400,000 speech that he got in Wall Street, Jason Chaffetz is talking about, hey look, he's got a $60 million advance on a book, he's got $400,000 from just one speech, and last year he vetoed a bill that would reduce his pension dollar for dollar for everything that he earned over $400,000.
[00:46:02.276 --> 00:46:03.957]  That's just a single speech.
[00:46:04.457 --> 00:46:05.758]  He's going to bring that back up again.
[00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:08.360]  But you know what we need to understand is that
[00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:14.905]  We have something better than actually prohibiting the maximum amount a president can use.
[00:46:14.925 --> 00:46:16.607]  What I'm concerned about are these speeches.
[00:46:16.627 --> 00:46:22.532]  You know, we had HL Mencken say that an election is an advance auction of stolen goods.
[00:46:23.092 --> 00:46:29.278]  These speeches that we see these presidents making everywhere, that is actually pay for services rendered.
[00:46:29.938 --> 00:46:31.138]  That is corruption.
[00:46:31.759 --> 00:46:33.459]  And we need to understand exactly what that is.
[00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:37.981]  We cannot drain the swamp as long as Washington has this much power.
[00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:46.544]  This much power concentrated unconstitutionally in Washington that they have usurped is like a black hole that pulls in all of this matter.
[00:46:46.564 --> 00:46:54.967]  And what it pulls in are the most corrupt, wicked people who use their position as a leveraged buyout to steal your country.
[00:46:55.027 --> 00:46:56.288]  That's the real issue here.
[00:46:57.128 --> 00:46:57.829]  That's what's happening.
[00:46:58.029 --> 00:47:00.691]  It's the corruption of power concentrated in Washington.
[00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:02.292]  For InfoWars, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:08.444 --> 00:47:10.006]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.406 --> 00:47:15.412]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.772 --> 00:47:21.218]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.618 --> 00:47:28.205]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.007]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.790]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.072]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.492 --> 00:47:40.115]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.877]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.487 --> 00:48:00.611]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.233]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:03.334]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:08.338]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:13.462]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:18.847]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.068]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:22.830]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.230]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.435]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.455 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.517]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.178]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:59.089]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.970]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.030]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.373 --> 00:49:15.558]  Well, we know that celebrities are in total meltdown mode over President Trump, especially his recent firing of James Comey.
[00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:24.864]  But now we have so many celebrities actually putting their hat in the ring saying, look, hey, if a reality star like Donald Trump can become the president, why not me?
[00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:31.469]  So let's kind of look at the spectrum of people who are saying, you know what, I think I might just go ahead and make a run for Congress.
[00:49:32.363 --> 00:49:43.456]  Well it's interesting because in the past we've seen maybe one here, one there, you know, Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, different kind of celebrity entities make their way into politics.
[00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:50.243]  But there does seem to be an influx now and it seems to be coming more of a mainstay or a consistency.
[00:49:51.084 --> 00:49:58.288]  And it'll be interesting to see because we saw a lot of politicians of the left, or excuse me, a lot of celebrities on the left get involved with the election.
[00:49:58.408 --> 00:50:02.891]  Yeah, the resistance, talking points out there, fake news about Trump.
[00:50:03.691 --> 00:50:13.057]  But what we're actually seeing is the people that are running, the celebrities that want to run for office and get in and actually work for the people are actually mostly conservatives.
[00:50:13.557 --> 00:50:14.759]  Is what I'm seeing so far.
[00:50:14.799 --> 00:50:15.740]  So just some of the names.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.621]  We'll start out with this one.
[00:50:16.641 --> 00:50:17.942]  This is a story from the Daily Caller.
[00:50:18.343 --> 00:50:22.928]  The actor who spoke at the RNC just declared plans to run for Congress.
[00:50:22.948 --> 00:50:24.990]  This is Antonio Sabato Jr.
[00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:27.553]  Apparently he's a soap opera star.
[00:50:27.673 --> 00:50:29.015]  I'm not really familiar with his work.
[00:50:29.495 --> 00:50:30.756]  But he spoke at the RNC.
[00:50:31.337 --> 00:50:32.517]  My mom and I are big fans.
[00:50:32.637 --> 00:50:40.380]  He endeared himself to conservatives with the speech at the RNC, and now he is going to be running for Congress.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:52.123]  Right, and he actually says that, you know, a lot of actors and celebrities, people in music, entertainment in general, will not come out as Republicans because they say that they get blacklisted from events.
[00:50:52.363 --> 00:50:55.824]  And that's not just... He said that this happened to him once he spoke at the RNC.
[00:50:55.964 --> 00:50:57.785]  And that's not just Hollywood, California.
[00:50:57.825 --> 00:51:00.387]  This is in New York.
[00:51:00.427 --> 00:51:01.787]  This is in the music industry.
[00:51:02.428 --> 00:51:03.788]  It really goes full spectrum.
[00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:16.156]  If you're a publisher or you're a writer and you write books, it's really all kinds of media that if you're a conservative, you don't want to out yourself to the powers that be because you might not get fair treatment.
[00:51:16.216 --> 00:51:18.077]  But Antonio Sabato Jr.
[00:51:18.137 --> 00:51:19.117]  is just one of the examples.
[00:51:19.177 --> 00:51:21.919]  Before I get to the big names that we'll talk about here in a second,
[00:51:22.259 --> 00:51:22.820]  Here's another one.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.781]  You may know this guy from the WWE.
[00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:30.446]  Kane is running for mayor of Knox County in Tennessee.
[00:51:30.626 --> 00:51:32.547]  Glenn Jacobs is his actual name.
[00:51:32.607 --> 00:51:33.949]  Kane would be his stage name.
[00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:37.772]  But this is a guy who, he's actually been on the Alex Jones Show before Leanne.
[00:51:37.792 --> 00:51:39.913]  This is a guy who's been conservative for a while.
[00:51:40.914 --> 00:51:53.401]  Spoke about conservative politics for a while, been guests on different shows for a while, I think he's been on Fox News recently too, so he's considering, or he will be running, a conservative mayor for Knox County, Tennessee.
[00:51:53.901 --> 00:52:01.005]  I would expect him to do pretty well, that's a pretty conservative area and that's a big name, and he's got a little bit of star power behind him.
[00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:03.266]  Yeah, well we saw what happened with Jesse Ventura.
[00:52:04.366 --> 00:52:05.566]  I was going to bring that up.
[00:52:05.647 --> 00:52:14.309]  There's one guy, let's not forget about Jesse Ventura, former wrestling broadcaster as well.
[00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:16.630]  Jesse the body Ventura.
[00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:21.331]  I'll tell you Alex, it's good to see some of my wrestling buddies running for office.
[00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:23.832]  So that's just Jesse, the body of Insura.
[00:52:24.033 --> 00:52:26.354]  Former governor and people really liked him.
[00:52:26.915 --> 00:52:27.896]  And I still like him.
[00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:32.699]  I mean, I know he's had different views than Donald Trump and Alex here lately, but I still like Jesse.
[00:52:32.719 --> 00:52:33.820]  I think he's a real guy.
[00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:39.745]  And I think that that's the most important thing right now to get real people in politics, even if you don't agree with them.
[00:52:40.645 --> 00:52:46.229]  Yes, as long as you are a real person who's not going to bow down to whatever the money that comes into your pocket wants you to do.
[00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:50.512]  Here's another WWE superstar, Rhyno.
[00:52:50.912 --> 00:52:54.314]  Terrence Garren is his real name, but Rhyno is his stage name.
[00:52:54.614 --> 00:52:57.196]  He's going to be running for office in Michigan.
[00:52:57.236 --> 00:53:08.563]  Now, he's ran before and lost, but he is going after it again, and he's trying to be the state representative for Dearborn, a very politicized area of Michigan.
[00:53:09.039 --> 00:53:30.590]  Well, and this is interesting because I know, speaking just kind of behind the scenes with Billy Corgan, who's a huge fan of wrestling, he got involved with wrestling as well, and we were just kind of talking about how interesting wrestling, like if you can understand wrestling and you see how that plays out, and even some of the terminology that they use inside the ring, it's absolutely politics.
[00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.832]  If you can understand wrestling, you can understand the chess that's played in politics.
[00:53:34.872 --> 00:53:39.495]  Well, it's funny that we were talking about this earlier, and that actually is true on multiple angles.
[00:53:39.635 --> 00:53:45.759]  Not only will you understand it from a standpoint of, okay, like, you know WWE is fake and they stage all this stuff.
[00:53:45.779 --> 00:53:47.760]  Like, yeah, that goes on in politics too.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.141]  A lot of that is the same thing.
[00:53:49.461 --> 00:53:57.045]  They stage stuff, they get narratives rolling, they all kind of go along with the story, they distract you from this, make a big hubba-bloo over here, whatever.
[00:53:57.065 --> 00:53:57.746]  Right.
[00:53:57.966 --> 00:53:59.227]  But the other point, too, that
[00:54:02.008 --> 00:54:04.150]  Well, I'll wait for that to happen in the White House.
[00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:13.555]  But the other thing that they do, too, is they actually inject a lot of the current day politics and talking points and debates into their actual show.
[00:54:13.995 --> 00:54:18.998]  They'll pit one Russian against the US guy while the whole Russia stuff was going on.
[00:54:19.038 --> 00:54:19.859]  That was something they did.
[00:54:19.899 --> 00:54:21.900]  That's something they've done for a long time.
[00:54:23.181 --> 00:54:24.982]  So I think that, you know, in general,
[00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:46.849]  Not just your point that you know and kind of you know and haphazardly saying if you understand wrestling you can understand politics but I do think that what we're seeing here is that there is a heavy element of politics in WWE for whatever reason that is and they seem to be mostly conservative from from what we've seen so far and let's not forget
[00:54:47.669 --> 00:54:51.752]  Uh, that Linda McMahon is the Small Business Association chief.
[00:54:51.792 --> 00:55:01.878]  This is the wife of McMahon who started WWE, Vince McMahon, the billionaire who started WWE, and Linda McMahon is the SBA chief.
[00:55:02.259 --> 00:55:05.141]  So again, this is a Trump appointee.
[00:55:05.621 --> 00:55:11.565]  It's not a secret that Trump and Vince McMahon are friends or that Trump has gone on WWE stages before.
[00:55:12.245 --> 00:55:20.909]  But again, another thing pointing to WWE and the people within being conservatives and having some political aspirations here too.
[00:55:20.929 --> 00:55:29.513]  I wish we could give a shout out to the guy who is always making the wrestling videos with all of us, Info Wars vs Rachel Maddow.
[00:55:29.553 --> 00:55:31.314]  Wrestling Politics I think it's called.
[00:55:31.354 --> 00:55:32.654]  Wrestling and Politics or something.
[00:55:33.114 --> 00:55:34.435]  I enjoy some of those.
[00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:35.956]  Only the ones with me obviously.
[00:55:36.656 --> 00:55:40.098]  But let's not forget, too, this was a story on InfoWars.
[00:55:40.478 --> 00:55:43.199]  Ted Nugent is looking to run for national office.
[00:55:43.219 --> 00:55:47.501]  So another guy, another celebrity, you have Kid Rock, who went to the White House.
[00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:54.065]  I think he was there with, actually, Ted Nugent and I forget the woman's name from Alaska right now, it's slipping my head.
[00:55:54.105 --> 00:55:54.325]  Sarah Palin.
[00:55:54.345 --> 00:55:55.165]  Sarah Palin, yes, thank you.
[00:55:55.225 --> 00:55:55.986]  So they were all there.
[00:55:56.046 --> 00:55:59.107]  Maybe Ted Nugent and Kid Rock are thinking about running for office.
[00:55:59.147 --> 00:56:00.068]  But here's the big one.
[00:56:00.408 --> 00:56:01.068]  Here's the big one.
[00:56:01.188 --> 00:56:02.389]  And I predicted this.
[00:56:03.189 --> 00:56:04.549]  I was the first to predict this.
[00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:05.110]  Okay?
[00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:06.330]  Leanne wants me to pull the tape.
[00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:07.270]  I'll have to find the tape.
[00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:08.631]  Maybe our audience can help me find it.
[00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:09.511]  Maybe the guys back here.
[00:56:09.891 --> 00:56:11.172]  I was the first to predict this.
[00:56:11.812 --> 00:56:13.072]  Oprah rock 2020.
[00:56:13.712 --> 00:56:16.433]  That's the ticket I think that they're going to try to put against Trump.
[00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.154]  Now, will it be Democrats?
[00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.194]  Will it be another group?
[00:56:19.334 --> 00:56:19.995]  I don't really know.
[00:56:20.075 --> 00:56:21.735]  So the guys are showing the story right here.
[00:56:21.875 --> 00:56:22.735]  Oprah for president.
[00:56:23.496 --> 00:56:27.197]  Leanne, she has this interview and she's basically saying what you said to start off the segment.
[00:56:27.608 --> 00:56:36.373]  Well, I didn't think that I knew enough to be in politics, I didn't have enough experience, but seeing Trump get in and seeing the craze around Trump, that got me thinking, maybe I can.
[00:56:36.433 --> 00:56:39.294]  So now this is Oprah hinting at a presidential run.
[00:56:39.555 --> 00:56:40.695]  Alex has talked about this.
[00:56:41.015 --> 00:56:46.278]  Alex was probably the first to talk about Oprah considering running for president.
[00:56:46.398 --> 00:56:47.299]  I took that a step further.
[00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:49.120]  I think it's going to be an Oprah and Rock
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:56.203]  Well, if you look at the GQ article that they wrote about Barack, I mean, it is just like salivating all over.
[00:56:56.263 --> 00:56:57.744]  He has become a media darling.
[00:56:57.764 --> 00:57:05.867]  He is a god, and it's just like how they were writing things for President Obama before he became the president.
[00:57:05.987 --> 00:57:13.311]  Barack Obama is the same glowing, beautiful prose that they are now using to write about Barack.
[00:57:13.996 --> 00:57:21.719]  So it's just, it's funny because everyone, when I started tweeting this, everyone was like, oh, The Rock is a registered Republican.
[00:57:21.759 --> 00:57:22.459]  He won't run.
[00:57:22.579 --> 00:57:27.000]  He'd have to run against Trump because, you know, well, he wouldn't be able to run against Trump if he was Republican.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.601]  But here's the thing.
[00:57:28.101 --> 00:57:30.422]  The Rock has been endeared by CNN lately.
[00:57:30.542 --> 00:57:31.922]  He's doing shows on CNN.
[00:57:32.262 --> 00:57:33.343]  He's been endeared by BuzzFeed.
[00:57:33.523 --> 00:57:34.823]  BuzzFeed.
[00:57:37.364 --> 00:57:44.228]  Okay so that to me points that they're trying to liberalize him and run him and Oprah possibly as a liberal ticket.
[00:57:44.268 --> 00:57:45.988]  Again this is my crazy prediction.
[00:57:53.012 --> 00:58:00.677]  It's going to be interesting to see, Leigh-Anne, if this wave really happens, if The Rock really runs for president with Oprah, it's going to be interesting to see.
[00:58:00.997 --> 00:58:07.541]  Can celebrity power actually trump, pun fully intended, somebody that knows what they're talking about?
[00:58:07.802 --> 00:58:09.403]  Trump just didn't come in as a celebrity.
[00:58:09.443 --> 00:58:15.747]  He came in as a successful international billionaire businessman who knows how to work and make great deals.
[00:58:15.787 --> 00:58:18.168]  So Trump wasn't just a celebrity, even though they push it that way.
[00:58:19.189 --> 00:58:26.412]  But hey, no offense to The Rock, but I don't know how much you can know about geopolitics and business when you're pretending to be a wrestler and an actor your whole life.
[00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:35.196]  Not insulting The Rock, I like The Rock personally, I'm not sure about his politics, but it'd be interesting to see how America possibly embraces this new wave of celebrities running for office.
[00:58:35.196 --> 00:58:40.979]  Well then it just goes to underscore how the office of the president really doesn't hold all of the power they say.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:51.586]  They really truly are a puppet and that's why so many people did really throw their support for President Trump because he seemed to be above being held as a puppet by these establishments.
[00:58:51.606 --> 00:58:52.767]  So we'll see.
[00:58:52.827 --> 00:58:53.527]  Remains to be seen.
[00:58:53.827 --> 00:58:59.371]  Well thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight and we will see you here again tomorrow at 7 p.m.
