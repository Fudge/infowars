[00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:10.584]  Well, here we are, the day before Thanksgiving, Wednesday, the 22nd day of November 2017.
[00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:15.725]  And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.946]  I'm your humble host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:30.889]  But this operation that we're involved in is nothing short of the attempt to not just save Western civilization in the Renaissance, but to save the defense of basic human enlightenment, period.
[00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:37.286]  You know, last weekend, we posted videos on Infowars.com.
[00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:59.680]  Some of them were live feeds of Owen Schroeder, Millie Weaver, Harrison Smith, and others, our crew members out on the streets of Austin, Texas, covering a Hillary Clinton book signing, but also covering a so-called Antifa-Anti-Trump demonstration.
[00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.628]  And this stuff just writes itself.
[00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:06.449]  No wonder some people think these videos we put out are fake.
[00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:22.554]  Because you've got a guy in a chicken suit who can barely talk, gibbering and cussing and threatening people, breaking our microphone and then running with police chasing a guy in a chicken suit like something out of a comedy, but it was serious.
[00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:28.596]  I gotta say 400, 500 yards with our reporters chasing after the police.
[00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.935]  It was bike police on bikes chasing a guy on foot.
[00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:36.056]  So who can make that up?
[00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:42.158]  And the fact that the anti-Trump people are literally drooling zombies.
[00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:46.940]  I mean, most of them, they admit, are paid by Soros and the Democratic Party.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.060]  These are the dregs of the earth.
[00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.741]  It's not like just one or two out of the crowd were like that.
[00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:56.063]  Every one of these people is like a
[00:01:59.073 --> 00:02:01.135]  Unspeakably stupid, mindless idiot.
[00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:04.277]  And then there were a few well-spoken, nice people there.
[00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:08.321]  I guess who just didn't like Trump.
[00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:13.025]  And then they were black folks that were also listeners.
[00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:14.386]  So we had those interviews too.
[00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:20.311]  And so I could see not liking Trump and not liking Clinton or something and being a Bernie Sanders guy, so you're out, whatever.
[00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.992]  And then we've got Millie Weaver who was also out there but separately at the book signing.
[00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:33.799]  I mean just every other woman going F you and trying to grab her microphone away as she walks down the sidewalk just trying to talk to people.
[00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.043]  They're so programmed that we're so evil in InfoWars that that happened.
[00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:41.506]  These people are really screwed up and it's getting worse.
[00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:53.934]  And you know, I've been around the country and around the world, and you go to some little poor fishing villages in Honduras, the people look alive, they look upright, they look savvy, they look smart.
[00:02:56.377 --> 00:03:00.600]  But you go to poor areas of Austin or other areas now, people look like they've been hit with mutation rays.
[00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:02.202]  They look like they're dying.
[00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.443]  They walk like they're zombies.
[00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:05.324]  They look like they're zombies.
[00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.426]  White people, black people, Asian, Hispanic, they look dead.
[00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:09.847]  It's not as if they're poor.
[00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:10.868]  They're aimless.
[00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:12.409]  They're TV heads.
[00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.131]  Most of them are unemployed.
[00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:17.694]  And it just shows you what domestication
[00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:19.733]  Does to people.
[00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:31.157]  And that's why what we're doing is such an important fight, ladies and gentlemen, because the Democratic Party and its constituents are slaves of the system.
[00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.418]  And the Republican leadership is just as bad or worse.
[00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:36.779]  But we're having an insurrection within the Republican Party.
[00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.460]  So this is such a historical thing we're talking about.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.102]  You know, with Thanksgiving tomorrow, I'd like to again thank all my listeners for their love and support.
[00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:53.820]  As men age, they may often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.643]  Supermill Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance and produce superior vitality in males.
[00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:06.744]  We rarely have it this special, but I did it recently.
[00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:07.224]  People love it.
[00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:08.005]  I'm doing it again.
[00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:10.545]  Supermill Vitality right now is 50% off.
[00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:13.511]  With free shipping.
[00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:17.253]  And when I did this with 50% off a few months ago, it was not free shipping.
[00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:20.014]  So this is as good a deal as we ever do, if not the best.
[00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:25.917]  We're also introducing a sales on InfoWars Life Living Defense.
[00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:27.538]  All supplies last.
[00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:28.658]  That's been sold out for a while.
[00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:29.719]  You can get it for only $22.
[00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.920]  That's 50% off.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.361]  It is super high quality.
[00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:34.201]  People absolutely love it.
[00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:35.822]  Flushes out the parrot sites.
[00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:37.962]  That is so many other amazing things.
[00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:43.244]  And the specials for the last two days are extended as well, but some of those are about to have to end.
[00:04:43.284 --> 00:04:44.924]  Brain Force, 50% off.
[00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:45.664]  25% off.
[00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:46.925]  Pro-Pure Items.
[00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.185]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:49.746]  Knockout, 50% off.
[00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.646]  But we're going to have to, again, stop that very, very soon.
[00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:57.087]  But the new special right now, again, Super Bowl Vitality and Living Defense.
[00:04:57.548 --> 00:04:59.408]  We'll be back on the other side of this transmission.
[00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:00.808]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:02.729]  Without you, there is no InfoWar.
[00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:08.923]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[00:05:09.304 --> 00:05:11.625]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:14.687]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:20.750]  And now, more than ever, I am thankful for your support and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.534]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide and, clearly, the biggest sales in our history.
[00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:29.816]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:33.558]  We've got our new troping, RainForce, 50% off.
[00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:35.739]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.159]  Thank you.
[00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.216]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:24.763]  You're now into hour number two.
[00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:36.533]  For the next 45 minutes or so, Sabelle Edmonds, an amazing patriot who served this country honorably, who's one of the highest level whistleblowers ever to expose a standout of 9-11.
[00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:40.976]  Our government working with radical jihad groups in Saudi Arabia.
[00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:42.857]  I mean, she's got amazing information.
[00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:44.218]  She's got courage, too.
[00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:51.664]  She's broken federal gag orders before, during Bush and Obama, and exposed serious crimes, and they had to back down.
[00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:54.766]  And she's a journalist as well, newsbud.com.
[00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:56.367]  We're going to be going to her in a moment.
[00:06:56.387 --> 00:07:00.731]  Then when she leaves us in the last segment of this hour, I told you it was a hoax at the time.
[00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.570]  Because 99% of the time it was.
[00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:11.492]  And I saw how the Air Force responded in a huge PR campaign during the whole NFL anti-Trump race stuff.
[00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:12.913]  And so I could just see the packaging.
[00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:14.833]  I could see the instant PR.
[00:07:15.254 --> 00:07:16.554]  And you know when something's produced.
[00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:17.334]  Kind of like Hillary did.
[00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:18.455]  Fake town halls.
[00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:22.236]  And I said, that shot, 35mm, super HD, it's actors.
[00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.617]  The media said, Jones claims he has actors.
[00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:24.897]  It's fake.
[00:07:25.137 --> 00:07:26.418]  Came out a month later, it was all fake!
[00:07:27.158 --> 00:07:27.358]  I mean...
[00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:31.877]  We all know, like, when you're seeing a Hollywood movie, versus real.
[00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:36.221]  I mean, unless it's just the best... I gotta tell you, watching The People vs. O.J.
[00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:42.907]  Simpson, sometimes during that Netflix show, the actors were so good that it was like it was real.
[00:07:43.508 --> 00:07:45.510]  But that's... it was only part of the show, too.
[00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.731]  Other parts weren't as good.
[00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.693]  I mean, you know when something's fake.
[00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.071]  And it's the same deal.
[00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:58.354]  Air Force Academy discovers racial slurs were hoaxed months after superintendent lauded for tough speech.
[00:07:59.154 --> 00:08:01.275]  And I think he or one of his adjuncts is behind it.
[00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:02.235]  I mean, I'll just tell you point blank.
[00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:02.915]  That's my opinion.
[00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:08.538]  Because I saw the whole PR rollout within hours, the way it was all done at the whole peak of the NFL deal.
[00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.158]  This was deep state PR.
[00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:11.559]  This general's anti-Trump.
[00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:12.419]  This was a stunt.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.040]  We know it was fake now.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.121]  We know somebody pulled it.
[00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:18.502]  And I'm saying you're suspect number one, buddy.
[00:08:19.622 --> 00:08:25.304]  Continuing, Rand Paul's neighbors say it wasn't a dispute over the grass or the landscaping.
[00:08:25.324 --> 00:08:26.024]  The neighbor hated him.
[00:08:26.364 --> 00:08:31.866]  The neighbor has called for violence against Trump, called for his testicles to be chopped off and all sorts of stuff.
[00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:36.107]  And he tackled him from behind and broke six of his ribs, we now learn, and punctured his lung.
[00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:38.408]  And the left is just celebrating the hell out of that.
[00:08:39.108 --> 00:08:40.408]  But his neighbors are now exposing him.
[00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:41.909]  Our story is up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:46.070]  Rand Paul reveals six broken ribs, lung condition after attack from socialist neighbor.
[00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.219]  That was part of their November 4th rampage.
[00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.980]  Congress, here's ideas of altering clouds to offset climate change.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.000]  Oh, McClatchy!
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.801]  I thought I heard of that on InfoWars, but a long time ago.
[00:08:57.081 --> 00:08:58.081]  So that's all coming up.
[00:08:58.821 --> 00:08:59.641]  Putin says U.S.
[00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:01.462]  wants to disrupt upcoming Russian election.
[00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:02.162]  We're going to get to that.
[00:09:02.962 --> 00:09:08.924]  We're going to get to this Nexavum cult, where the women get branded and have to bring in other sex slaves.
[00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:12.625]  They thought it was a feminist group, but it was run by a man.
[00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.566]  I just... I wasn't talking about this group a month ago.
[00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.967]  But in New York and in Hollywood and other places, this is how these work.
[00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:29.211]  They'll say it's a women empowerment group, and then it's being run by some beautiful women that they lure them in, and then they put them on hallucinogens, you name it.
[00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:32.473]  And I'm not saying this guy did it, but the police are going in.
[00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:35.455]  I'm just saying I knew about these type deals, not this one.
[00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:39.277]  And of course, Huffington Post attacked me and said I was horrible.
[00:09:39.638 --> 00:09:46.202]  I told women, if you go to a women empowerment group, they go, oh by the way, just to prove you're into women being in charge, these women are going to put you in handcuffs.
[00:09:46.922 --> 00:09:47.783]  You like girls, don't you?
[00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:50.385]  And then next, you're being tortured.
[00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:52.126]  Or next, you're dead.
[00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:56.289]  And they attacked me for that when I broke it down.
[00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:57.550]  But now, that was where all this broke.
[00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.251]  Oh, see, I'm right again.
[00:09:58.271 --> 00:09:59.392]  Right there.
[00:09:59.512 --> 00:09:59.692]  See?
[00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:02.334]  So, there you go.
[00:10:02.354 --> 00:10:06.317]  It just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:08.759]  Oh, you're a young, beautiful woman.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.861]  You can trust other women, my dear.
[00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:12.242]  Come to our castle.
[00:10:13.223 --> 00:10:13.904]  Oh, there's no men here?
[00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:16.245]  Oh, no, we don't have men here until you're chained down.
[00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:18.447]  Until you're begging for your... Oh, excuse me.
[00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:20.269]  You'll find out later when we brand you.
[00:10:21.277 --> 00:10:22.018]  We're liberal though.
[00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:29.563]  You know, Apple, we run companies with suicide nets and enforced abortions, but it's okay because Apple's liberal!
[00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:39.311]  See, as long as it's liberal, as long as they're pulling your teeth out with pliers and saying it's liberal, I mean, as long as you're shooting up a church and it's liberal, it's alright.
[00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:42.633]  And again, there's a whole dark side on the right wing as well.
[00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:43.914]  It's all a system of control.
[00:10:44.334 --> 00:10:46.196]  Now, let me just stop there and get into the main subject.
[00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:54.478]  Chabot Edmonds is one of the bravest people out there that I've seen in the last 15 years, 16 years, since 9-11.
[00:10:54.978 --> 00:10:59.780]  And I want her, in the few minutes we have before we go to break, just to tell people about herself, even though she doesn't like to talk about herself.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.301]  She's an author, journalist, researcher.
[00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:13.706]  She was a high-level translator in Arabic and Farsi for the FBI with NSA intercepts, CIA intercepts, watching all the different agencies and confirming what Colonel Schaefer and others talked about, going on
[00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:15.928]  Pre 9-11 and on 9-11.
[00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:18.370]  And she exposed the sex trafficking, the weapon trafficking.
[00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.751]  It ties into Benghazi later.
[00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:20.872]  It ties into the Arab Spring.
[00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:24.916]  It ties into now, her big story we'll get to by the bottom of the hour.
[00:11:24.956 --> 00:11:27.819]  But I wanted to give folks some background from NewsBud.com.
[00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:30.381]  I'm going to tweak this out at real Alex Jones during the break.
[00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:31.262]  He's going to go mega viral.
[00:11:31.622 --> 00:11:32.823]  Targeting Michael Flynn.
[00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:38.846]  And shielding the radical cleric, Gulan, special counsel Robert Mueller must step down.
[00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:45.029]  This is the network that gets tens of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money to run Muslim schools here in the U.S., yes.
[00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:52.973]  And it's an inner fight between Ergun and Gulan, who is a man, not just the group, and all this, and she is a leading
[00:11:54.424 --> 00:11:54.924]  Hello Alex.
[00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.605]  Many thanks for the invite and for this opportunity because
[00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:38.648]  Of all the angles, all the ongoing cases right now under these this farce Russiagate investigations, General Flynn's case is the case that stands out the most.
[00:12:39.409 --> 00:12:43.110]  And it is blacked out the most by the media.
[00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:55.352]  You either see false information, completely false information, unanimously put out by the media, and you also see all this blacked out information.
[00:12:55.732 --> 00:12:58.673]  So I'm really grateful for this opportunity.
[00:12:58.693 --> 00:13:05.594]  We at Newsbud have been covering nonstop General Flynn's case since last August.
[00:13:06.194 --> 00:13:08.515]  And I just want to start by saying,
[00:13:09.073 --> 00:13:23.765]  And explaining why General Flynn's case and and and why Newsbud has been non-stop covering this case of all the different angles and developments that we have been seeing the force develop.
[00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:27.228]  Isn't it the window into understanding the different factions and everything?
[00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:29.589]  Well, yes.
[00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.087]  As you know, I have been non-partisan.
[00:13:33.227 --> 00:13:35.888]  I have been around for 16 years, you just mentioned.
[00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.928]  I guess we are both getting really old, Alex.
[00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:39.689]  I can't believe we've been around this long.
[00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:41.149]  You look great.
[00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:42.389]  I don't know about me.
[00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.630]  No, you do.
[00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.331]  And you still have the energy.
[00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:54.353]  And again, this is, I don't know, the seventh or eighth time you have given us the platform to put out blacked-out stories.
[00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:59.685]  And the documented stories, not allegations, not sensationalism.
[00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:04.990]  But here's why General Flynn's case grabbed my attention.
[00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:07.830]  Starting last August, okay?
[00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.911]  As you know, I was a whistleblower with the FBI.
[00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:18.254]  I became the most gagged whistleblower with all the state secrets, privilege, invocations, and the gag orders.
[00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:23.836]  This came during the Bush administration, and it continued into the Obama administration.
[00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:27.277]  As you know, the Supreme Court was prevented from hearing my case.
[00:14:28.337 --> 00:14:44.789]  Well, when I started looking at all the facts on General Flynn's case, the first thing I realized immediately, because I also have an organization, I have 150 national security whistleblowers from the CIA, from the Pentagon,
[00:14:45.249 --> 00:14:46.991]  We established this organization in 2003, 2004.
[00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:55.339]  And that's why I'm saying you have so much courage, is you have been a leading person when they were jailing everybody, who stood up to them and organized folks.
[00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:03.427]  And so much of what we now know about 9-11, and all these other events that helped General Flynn finally break a lot of this up, was due to your work.
[00:15:03.687 --> 00:15:07.711]  And I'm only explaining that to listeners, so they understand how incredibly important this is.
[00:15:08.712 --> 00:15:17.119]  Extremely important, because as you can see, unanimously, the media, they don't present the real case when it comes to General Flynn's case.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:25.427]  General Flynn was selected by the Obama administration to lead Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:15:25.947 --> 00:15:30.271]  They looked at this general impeccable, impeccable record, right?
[00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:35.676]  And I have to also emphasize, he has been, he and his family, they have been Democrats.
[00:15:36.974 --> 00:15:42.178]  So, didn't expect it also to have a yes man in the White House.
[00:15:42.318 --> 00:15:50.003]  Instead they got a hero who helped the whole engineer, the whole architecture to stop the Islamic Jihad operations.
[00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:50.604]  Stay right there.
[00:15:50.624 --> 00:15:53.666]  Let's get into why the globalists hate General Flynn so much.
[00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:57.508]  And now it's a window into everything with Sabel Edmonds straight ahead.
[00:15:57.529 --> 00:15:58.369]  She's with News Bud.

[00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:24.084]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.005 --> 00:20:29.488]  By the way, this particular article ties into what Sabel is about to break down exclusively here.
[00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:37.934]  This came out six months ago in the Vault 7 CIA leak, that they admitted was real info, how they were impersonating Russians.
[00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:49.443]  With the CIA programs in live time to make it look like it came from Russia and to put it in the Russian alphabet to then frame Russia for messing with the election.
[00:20:49.844 --> 00:20:50.344]  So there it is.
[00:20:50.404 --> 00:20:52.406]  CIA wrote code to impersonate Russia.
[00:20:53.306 --> 00:20:56.469]  Lab, antivirus company, just so much more.
[00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:58.891]  Putin says deep state may interfere in Russian election.
[00:20:58.911 --> 00:21:03.715]  Well, they've been doing it with the whole Ford Foundation and the CIA and
[00:21:04.335 --> 00:21:05.956]  George Soros, it's just crazy.
[00:21:06.437 --> 00:21:16.343]  But going back to Sybil Edmonds, one of the biggest whistleblowers, if not the most prolific ever, organizing other whistleblowers now with Newsbud.com.
[00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.644]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[00:21:17.664 --> 00:21:22.948]  Let's get into General Flynn and why he's the key to understanding the shadow government wars that are going on.
[00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:24.589]  Absolutely.
[00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:31.034]  At Newsbud, we broke in 2011, before ISIS brand was created, Alex.
[00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:49.219]  The fact that Obama administration, the CIA, together with NATO, they were creating this this jihadi groups using Turkey, using Jordan, in order to topple Bashar Assad's government in Syria.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:49.780]  Okay.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.561]  And this was before they coined the term ISIS.
[00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:55.363]  And we have it there on our site, people can see it.
[00:21:55.803 --> 00:21:58.124]  Well, back to General Flynn.
[00:21:58.624 --> 00:21:59.405]  General Flynn,
[00:22:00.566 --> 00:22:09.413]  As an insider becomes aware, this is during the Obama administration, that this is what Obama administration was doing.
[00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.854]  The U.S.
[00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:22.564]  government was creating these jihadi groups, which later was termed ISIS, and he blew the whistle internally.
[00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:28.469]  He went and he's, think about it, he's a director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:31.208]  He says, what the heck is this?
[00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:42.838]  And he stands out and he stands up against what the Obama administration was doing, opposes all these operations in creating ISIS.
[00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:44.179]  And here we are, U.S.
[00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:50.685]  government, Obama administration creating, arming, training ISIS in Turkey, in Jordan,
[00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:56.452]  And of course, by blowing the whistle, what is the first thing that's going to happen to you?
[00:22:56.732 --> 00:23:03.537]  I know it, and I know it based on hundreds of whistleblower cases I have represented, I have studied, I have analyzed.
[00:23:04.098 --> 00:23:10.623]  They pushed him out of the administration because he was not being a yes-man, okay?
[00:23:11.784 --> 00:23:14.846]  After leaving his position,
[00:23:15.868 --> 00:23:28.553]  General Flynn went and he said, you know, disgusted with the entire operations, Obama administration, and he set up his own private firm and some of the, with some clients, some of them international.
[00:23:29.353 --> 00:23:35.675]  And fast forward another year or so, he blew the whistle again.
[00:23:35.695 --> 00:23:38.836]  And this is for the American public.
[00:23:38.856 --> 00:23:41.537]  He is the first U.S.
[00:23:41.718 --> 00:23:45.559]  official to go on record unabashedly
[00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:55.090]  Exposing the world's biggest, biggest sleeper terror cell that is headquartered here in the United States.
[00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.312]  This is Fethullah Gulen.
[00:23:57.352 --> 00:24:05.700]  This is this Islamist radical Fethullah Gulen's network, which network is over $25 billion.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.285]  Guess who brought Fethullah Gulen and his network into the United States?
[00:24:12.112 --> 00:24:30.443]  In 1998, it was Bill Clinton who brought Fethullah Gulen in a private Gulfstream plane, CIA plane, into the United States while this man was wanted in Turkey and even some other nations for his terror-radical Islamic activities.
[00:24:31.471 --> 00:24:37.956]  And Bill Clinton administration gave the rise to this network in the United States.
[00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:41.159]  And by the way, tell folks how much taxpayer money he gets a year.
[00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:44.381]  I mean, they say he's worth as much as $200 billion.
[00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:46.583]  That's the minimum.
[00:24:46.663 --> 00:24:48.164]  That's the minimum, Alex.
[00:24:48.204 --> 00:24:49.745]  That's the known figures.
[00:24:50.186 --> 00:24:54.229]  Because can you believe this Islamic terror network
[00:24:54.761 --> 00:24:59.686]  He owns and operates the largest charter school chains in the United States.
[00:24:59.786 --> 00:25:00.747]  And they get taxpayer money.
[00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:01.768]  Hundreds of billions.
[00:25:01.788 --> 00:25:02.149]  Absolutely.
[00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.029]  So here we are.
[00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:03.890]  Here we are.
[00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.052]  This has all come out now.
[00:25:05.772 --> 00:25:06.933]  You're from Turkey's Extraction.
[00:25:06.954 --> 00:25:07.894]  You're an expert on this.
[00:25:08.355 --> 00:25:09.396]  Flynn blows the whistle.
[00:25:09.416 --> 00:25:11.358]  The military says we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[00:25:11.738 --> 00:25:12.719]  Rand Paul goes public.
[00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:13.740]  Senator Cruz goes public.
[00:25:14.161 --> 00:25:16.804]  So they change the name to ISIS to confuse people.
[00:25:17.764 --> 00:25:18.985]  And then now it's ongoing.
[00:25:19.025 --> 00:25:20.106]  Now we have the Arab Spring.
[00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:21.166]  We have Europe.
[00:25:21.206 --> 00:25:22.307]  We have the migrant crisis.
[00:25:22.347 --> 00:25:23.268]  Soros is running it.
[00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:24.969]  There's a globalist double-cross.
[00:25:25.129 --> 00:25:29.031]  Trump, from my research, is trying to continue Flynn's operation to kill this.
[00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:30.312]  Is that accurate?
[00:25:30.352 --> 00:25:31.132]  And where are we going?
[00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:32.033]  And tell us about Mueller.
[00:25:33.214 --> 00:25:46.862]  Yes, because he actually, and this is General Flynn, he wrote an article, editorial, and had it published at the Hill publication, basically calling what it is, warning the American public,
[00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:50.442]  And saying this terror network needs to be stopped.
[00:25:51.202 --> 00:25:53.783]  And that basically was the last straw.
[00:25:53.843 --> 00:26:04.245]  He had already become a target, a major target, a major hit with the CIA, with the Obama administration by blowing the whistle on ISIS.
[00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:13.648]  This was the last straw by going public as this high level general with impeccable record saying this is a terror network.
[00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:20.040]  And that was when the real retaliation began to take place.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.463]  I was about to say, you know who's in power because you can't criticize them?
[00:26:24.944 --> 00:26:29.207]  We've just barely covered Gulan and the hack attacks, all hell breaks loose.
[00:26:29.747 --> 00:26:34.131]  The mainstream media comes after us on other issues, and I've been contacted by high-level people.
[00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:35.993]  It was off-record, so I can't say who, and they said, listen,
[00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:38.734]  Just drop the Gulan stuff.
[00:26:39.195 --> 00:26:40.195]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:26:40.275 --> 00:26:40.616]  Stop.
[00:26:40.896 --> 00:26:41.316]  Stop it.
[00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:47.220]  I've been actually threatened and I, you know, that's why I know how much courage you've got is, I mean, these people mean business.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.543]  I have been receiving threats for over a decade because I was the first person in the U.S.
[00:26:52.563 --> 00:26:55.045]  to expose Gulan Network, Gulan's name.
[00:26:55.345 --> 00:27:01.169]  When I came out in 2006, 2007 on Gulan, nobody had heard of this man's name.
[00:27:01.449 --> 00:27:02.169]  They were like, who?
[00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:04.851]  She's talking about some kind of a Turkish imam.
[00:27:05.322 --> 00:27:09.803]  Who was in Pennsylvania, and nobody wanted to take it seriously.
[00:27:09.843 --> 00:27:19.967]  But when you have this general with this impeccable record, going on record and publicly... Who was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, so he had the bird's eye view of everything.
[00:27:20.007 --> 00:27:20.567]  He could see it.
[00:27:21.527 --> 00:27:21.747]  Right.
[00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:24.628]  And this is before Obama left the White House.
[00:27:24.948 --> 00:27:25.909]  This is November 2016.
[00:27:25.969 --> 00:27:33.111]  Three, four days after this article was published, penned by General Flynn,
[00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:53.286]  Obama White House started leaking falsified information, misleading incomplete information falsified to their mouthpiece media networks on General Flynn, accusing him of being pocketed by the Turkish government and none of those.
[00:27:53.826 --> 00:28:01.451]  Basically, most of those allegations have already been... Sure, Flynn 100% with his consulting company, carried out U.S.
[00:28:01.491 --> 00:28:04.292]  interests 100% like he's always done, and done a great job.
[00:28:04.493 --> 00:28:09.896]  The whole architecture of bringing down ISIS, making Saudi Arabia stop doing what they're doing, I mean that's Flynn, isn't it?
[00:28:11.036 --> 00:28:11.657]  Absolutely.
[00:28:11.817 --> 00:28:12.498]  And guess what?
[00:28:13.038 --> 00:28:20.346]  When I was in the FBI, there were several investigations on ULAND taken up by the FBI, okay?
[00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:28.395]  And several field offices, including those in New Jersey, those in Illinois, and of course the main office being the Washington Field Office.
[00:28:28.795 --> 00:28:31.598]  And this is under Director Mueller, right?
[00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:34.740]  And when we come back, we're going to hold you to the end of the hour because it's so important.
[00:28:34.961 --> 00:28:41.124]  We're going to get into Mueller now, who's just got his hands in Uranium One, the Russia deals, working with Gulan.
[00:28:41.144 --> 00:28:44.006]  And it's all on record, just what a monster this guy is.
[00:28:44.126 --> 00:28:49.609]  And if this gets out, it could stop Mueller trying to destroy our chance of saving this country.
[00:28:49.649 --> 00:28:51.210]  We've got to stop Mueller.
[00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.810]  Stay with us.
[00:29:06.351 --> 00:29:07.232]  Let's talk to Danny.
[00:29:07.272 --> 00:29:08.132]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[00:29:08.152 --> 00:29:08.832]  You're on the air, Danny.
[00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:09.433]  Hi.
[00:29:09.553 --> 00:29:14.536]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[00:29:14.556 --> 00:29:14.876]  Thank you.
[00:29:14.896 --> 00:29:23.301]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one?
[00:29:23.981 --> 00:29:29.564]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that.
[00:29:29.664 --> 00:29:37.027]  But the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[00:29:37.087 --> 00:29:46.372]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:50.954]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[00:29:51.614 --> 00:29:53.435]  And it reboots itself.
[00:29:53.516 --> 00:29:55.957]  So, I mean, think about that.
[00:29:56.337 --> 00:30:07.805]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[00:30:07.885 --> 00:30:08.586]  Let me be clear.
[00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:15.871]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:21.334]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[00:30:21.374 --> 00:30:22.214]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[00:30:22.534 --> 00:30:25.776]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.497]  I took DNA for a few months.
[00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:28.777]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:30.098]  The feeling is back.
[00:30:30.278 --> 00:30:31.939]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:33.580]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:44.306]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[00:30:44.366 --> 00:30:46.588]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[00:30:46.668 --> 00:30:48.869]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[00:30:48.929 --> 00:30:51.871]  Each person's different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:53.792]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:58.194]  We run in like six months and free shipping, store wide at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:34.359]  Owen Schroer and Roger Stone bring you the day's biggest stories, as well as the latest breaking news, with a no-holds-barred, aggressive approach and commitment to bringing you the most cutting-edge analysis and information.
[00:32:36.465 --> 00:32:40.206]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:43.408]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[00:32:43.888 --> 00:32:46.149]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:48.310]  And we control the narrative now.
[00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.472]  This is the War Room.
[00:32:56.473 --> 00:33:00.374]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:14.200]  Who are the masters of the puppets?
[00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:20.545]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:22.607]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.048 --> 00:33:38.801]  Civil Edmunds, probably the most prolific modern whistleblower, organized hundreds of other whistleblowers, broke federal gag orders to expose the 28 pages, Saudi involvement, the 9-11 stand down, the globalists allied with radical Islam out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:45.548]  I know her information helped General Flynn with his inside information come to a lot of decisions General Flynn made.
[00:33:45.568 --> 00:33:55.351]  And I'm only pointing that out to say, we wouldn't be where we are right now without people like William Binney and her and William Drake or Thomas Drake, all the rest of these folks.
[00:33:55.791 --> 00:34:05.695]  Now before I go any further, just briefly, because we're in a 34-hour broadcast right now that ends at 6 o'clock tonight.
[00:34:07.998 --> 00:34:10.000]  I need to be able to fund our operation.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.001]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[00:34:11.642 --> 00:34:27.359]  We have great supplements, great fluoride-free toothpaste, we have great t-shirts, we have great books, we have great films, we have amazing water filtration, amazing air filtration, whatever the best systems are, according to Consumer Reports, at a good price.
[00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:27.980]  We get it.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.721]  We discount it.
[00:34:29.847 --> 00:34:39.830]  And quite frankly, I'm so sick of Amazon, and all the government financing it gets, and the monopoly it's being given, and all the subsidies, that I try to give them a run for their money.
[00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.770]  I mean, we sell a lot of stuff lower than they do.
[00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.491]  And it's pretty crazy, because sometimes we're making $5 on things.
[00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:49.993]  Some of the products we've got out right now, it's Lost Leaders, because I want you to try them and see how great they are.
[00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:56.915]  Two of the Lost Leaders, with free shipping store-wide right now, are the Biome Defense Probiotic.

[00:35:00.353 --> 00:35:01.354]  We lose money on that.
[00:35:01.574 --> 00:35:02.875]  It's going to sell out in the next few days.
[00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:04.115]  All apparel.
[00:35:04.136 --> 00:35:06.157]  50% off.
[00:35:06.277 --> 00:35:09.519]  Spread the word to meet like-minded people and defend the First Amendment.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.980]  Molon Labe.
[00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:12.401]  Come and take it.
[00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:14.643]  Write down to Trump's my president.
[00:35:15.143 --> 00:35:16.484]  Write down to Hillary for prison 2017.
[00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:21.617]  We have Secret 12, high quality methylcobalamin, vitamin B12.
[00:35:21.997 --> 00:35:24.978]  Highest rated out there by third-party groups.

[00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:29.060]  Super blue fluoride-free mouthwash with coital silver and iodine.

[00:35:31.001 --> 00:35:32.862]  We lose money on that one, but I want you to try it.
[00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:36.164]  DNA Force back in stock after months of being sold out.
[00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:37.324]  25% off with free shipping.
[00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:38.405]  You cannot beat that.
[00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:40.566]  So important for yourself, your children, your family.
[00:35:40.826 --> 00:35:44.008]  It's been proven to detoxify cells with the BioPQ Cube.
[00:35:45.236 --> 00:35:46.177]  The Coke U10 and others.
[00:35:46.257 --> 00:35:50.579]  It is the best product out there at one-third the cost of stuff sold in medical clinics.
[00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:52.500]  So that's our true nutraceutical level product.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.843]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:35:57.863 --> 00:36:01.585]  And if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:01.605 --> 00:36:04.387]  Again, free shipping is running, but I've got it in that.
[00:36:05.603 --> 00:36:14.032]  I'm going to end free shipping tomorrow, and I'm going to end these specials tomorrow, and I really am, because a lot of them are lost leaders.
[00:36:14.693 --> 00:36:18.677]  And these are best-selling products, but I know a lot of you are on the fence and have never bought the products.
[00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:26.788]  Our regular customers are amazing, but I want people that haven't tried X2, or haven't tried BrainForce, or haven't tried what vitamin B12 does.
[00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:28.890]  Way more energy than a cup of coffee at night if I'm tired.
[00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.191]  And it's all healthy and it's good!
[00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:35.976]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:36:36.536 --> 00:36:41.360]  And you've seen the Congressional hearings last week, and the Intelligence Committee saying, we want InfoWars shut down.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.582]  And the head of Twitter says, sir, we shut them down at lunch.
[00:36:45.353 --> 00:36:56.752]  We were just pointing out that they're bringing in these Islamic terrorists, they're protecting them, and that de Blasio had been soft on terror, and that Trump was right, and they called that a fake story, it was number one on Twitter, and banned it!
[00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:59.802]  I mean this is like really dangerous.
[00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:04.444]  Gagging whistleblower, SWAT teaming William Binney, SWAT teaming Manafort.
[00:37:04.464 --> 00:37:13.849]  They're trying to put Flynn, they've got a sealed indictment on him, but they're afraid of what he may say about classified stuff.
[00:37:13.889 --> 00:37:15.170]  This is real brinksmanship.
[00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.611]  And then Mueller comes into the situation.
[00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:22.213]  Mueller, let's talk about some of his background, Sabel Edmonds.
[00:37:22.874 --> 00:37:25.355]  You were in the FBI when he was the director of it.
[00:37:26.257 --> 00:37:40.504]  Yes, and this, I tell you what, what we are seeing here, it basically makes McCartyism era light, because this is like a souped up McCartyism right now we are seeing, witnessing.
[00:37:40.624 --> 00:37:51.409]  Imagine my shock when I saw that Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel in this case, and Robert, the same Robert Mueller,
[00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:58.180]  Who during my case, he's the Robert Mueller who put gag orders in my case together with Attorney General Ashcroft.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.801]  You remember all that, Alex.
[00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:09.263]  With all these FBI files and cases that Robert Mueller was covering up on Gulen, on Gulen's network.
[00:38:10.243 --> 00:38:12.143]  They were FBI agents.
[00:38:12.243 --> 00:38:20.705]  They were FBI agents not only in Washington's field office, but also in Chicago field office, in Patterson field office.
[00:38:21.936 --> 00:38:27.841]  Who were blowing the whistle on Mueller internally, saying he's quashing our investigations.
[00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:37.293]  He's taking these terrorism and criminal investigations on Gulen and his network, and he was transferring them into counterintelligence.
[00:38:37.894 --> 00:38:54.980]  And when I was the one who stepped outside the FBI, went to Congress, went to IG, it was again this same Mueller who invoked the state secrets privilege with Ashcroft, placed gag orders to protect, to protect this terrorist network.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.061]  So imagine my shock when I see
[00:38:58.072 --> 00:39:00.133]  Lo and behold, it's Robert Mueller.
[00:39:00.733 --> 00:39:13.698]  And Robert Mueller dug and could not find a single thing on General Flynn linking him in any way to any nefarious activities or operations with the Russians.
[00:39:14.258 --> 00:39:21.141]  So he expanded this farce investigation and turned Russiagate into Turkeygate.
[00:39:24.302 --> 00:39:27.824]  When it comes to General Flynn, it's Turkeygate!
[00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:36.109]  And nobody in the media... Look, President Trump said, fine, go and do the investigation in a limited scope.
[00:39:36.569 --> 00:39:45.594]  Anything that had to do with so-called allegations on... But now it's moved on to Turkey and him consulting for the Turkish government on how to try to stop ISIS.
[00:39:46.115 --> 00:39:49.697]  I mean, it was totally legal, so it's amazing.
[00:39:51.034 --> 00:39:51.774]  And guess what?
[00:39:52.234 --> 00:39:58.736]  Not only, we know the left, the media, recently we put out an expose on the Young Turks at Newsbutt.
[00:39:59.236 --> 00:40:09.059]  You know, they have changed modus operandi, Alex, because it got so much publicity when foundations like Soros was directly funding them, right?
[00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:11.640]  So now the Clinton camp
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.522]  They get their allies, they have them set up shell companies.
[00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:17.603]  These are bogus shell companies.
[00:40:18.003 --> 00:40:25.788]  They funnel the money to the shell companies, private companies, and have the private companies funnel money to media organizations.
[00:40:25.848 --> 00:40:29.070]  Let's talk about the Young Turks, because for people that don't know... It's those Young Turks on this.
[00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.791]  They are just only one of these.
[00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:36.634]  One of these left media organizations who are now implementing the new modus operandi.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:48.974]  And if you wonder why they're all so pro-Hillary and are covering up everything, it's because they're paid by Hillary and paid by different Islamic... And shell companies created so they can have Hillary Camp's money funneled.
[00:40:49.254 --> 00:40:54.120]  They got $10 million from this company, from this fake shell company.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.744]  That was established three months before they gave $10 million to the Young Turks.
[00:40:58.764 --> 00:41:01.446]  This is how much money they're spending on Birmingham, right?
[00:41:01.466 --> 00:41:10.735]  And again, the Young Turks are a Google-funded, controlled, Democratic Party, Soros-funded disinformation operation who...
[00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:17.981]  Literally, they were in my YouTube in 30 seconds after they confronted me and I went on their show.
[00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:23.245]  They gave the orders and they shut down my YouTube themselves to show their power.
[00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:25.187]  They are literally in bed with Google.
[00:41:25.928 --> 00:41:26.728]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:26.808 --> 00:41:27.529]  And they have been.
[00:41:27.689 --> 00:41:31.933]  That guy, the buffoon, Cenk Uygur, has been after me since 2004.
[00:41:32.413 --> 00:41:33.814]  But back to the Flynn case.
[00:41:33.915 --> 00:41:37.598]  And I'm going to break two news pieces here on your show.
[00:41:38.303 --> 00:41:39.284]  It hasn't been out.
[00:41:39.484 --> 00:41:40.445]  Nobody has it.
[00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:42.607]  We have developed our own sources.
[00:41:42.947 --> 00:41:46.770]  With our very limited budget, we have been traveling, interviewing people.
[00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:51.594]  So I have two breaking news to break during this show.
[00:41:52.695 --> 00:42:00.522]  But Mueller, I can't believe not only the left media, Young Turks, all the ones funded by the Clinton camp Soros,
[00:42:01.142 --> 00:42:11.308]  But even the more conservative or so-called conservative media outlets, they haven't touched this case with General Flynn, with Mueller's real conflict of interest.
[00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:26.617]  Yes, he has a huge conflict of interest on Uranium One, which again, we were reporting on that two years ago during Malheur protests on Uranium One and Clinton Foundation and Mueller's role, but in this case,
[00:42:27.157 --> 00:42:35.443]  By going after Flynn, not finding anything else, trying to punish a whistleblower who blew the whistle as a whistleblower.
[00:42:35.563 --> 00:42:39.366]  Sure, it ought to be Obama and all of them in trouble for running Islamic State and Al Qaeda.
[00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:40.026]  Stay there.
[00:42:40.046 --> 00:42:43.228]  Let's come back again to the new breaking news on Mueller and more.
[00:42:43.288 --> 00:42:44.949]  And then I want to do one more little short segment.
[00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:50.753]  After that, getting into recapping all the stuff you exposed earlier, those intercepts back on 9-11.
[00:42:51.354 --> 00:42:52.635]  Sabel Edmonds is our guest.
[00:42:52.955 --> 00:42:54.376]  Check out her website, NewsBud.
[00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:07.145]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:12.666]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[00:43:13.206 --> 00:43:17.126]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[00:43:17.146 --> 00:43:20.467]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[00:43:21.127 --> 00:43:25.568]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:29.469]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:31.709]  I came in here an hour ago.
[00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:39.691]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:43.793]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[00:43:44.373 --> 00:43:47.854]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[00:43:48.214 --> 00:43:49.914]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[00:43:50.375 --> 00:43:56.697]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:43:56.737 --> 00:43:57.637]  Let's go over them right now.
[00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.699]  This is verified by our Mark.
[00:43:59.879 --> 00:44:02.842]  Five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[00:44:03.322 --> 00:44:04.363]  I take it as directed.
[00:44:04.383 --> 00:44:15.274]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[00:44:15.835 --> 00:44:16.515]  Easy does it.
[00:44:16.595 --> 00:44:17.616]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[00:44:17.636 --> 00:44:18.577]  It's very, very serious.
[00:44:18.998 --> 00:44:19.398]  Not a game.
[00:44:19.438 --> 00:44:19.839]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:21.639]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:22.540]  Energy all day.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:30.282]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[00:44:30.722 --> 00:44:31.442]  Another review.
[00:44:31.462 --> 00:44:32.442]  I love this one.
[00:44:32.762 --> 00:44:35.203]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[00:44:35.583 --> 00:44:39.104]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[00:44:39.364 --> 00:44:42.285]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[00:44:42.685 --> 00:44:44.207]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:44.587 --> 00:44:47.972]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:51.436]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[00:44:51.496 --> 00:44:56.222]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[00:44:56.362 --> 00:44:57.343]  Amazing product.
[00:44:58.064 --> 00:45:00.145]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:01.566]  Here's one from Brian.
[00:45:01.886 --> 00:45:03.967]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[00:45:04.087 --> 00:45:04.928]  Thank you all.
[00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:08.970]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.251]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[00:45:11.651 --> 00:45:13.592]  Every night owl should have this product.
[00:45:14.092 --> 00:45:17.534]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[00:45:17.794 --> 00:45:18.455]  And I should add,
[00:45:19.235 --> 00:45:20.356]  That's a great name for this product.
[00:45:20.636 --> 00:45:22.457]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[00:45:22.477 --> 00:45:24.198]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[00:45:24.518 --> 00:45:25.859]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[00:45:25.939 --> 00:45:27.540]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.140]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:29.141]  I said I'd shut up!
[00:45:30.062 --> 00:45:30.822]  But back to the script.
[00:45:31.182 --> 00:45:33.063]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[00:45:33.083 --> 00:45:33.824]  I love that name too.
[00:45:34.244 --> 00:45:36.285]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[00:45:36.585 --> 00:45:40.788]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[00:45:40.828 --> 00:45:43.390]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:44.890]  You make it literally possible.
[00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:50.757]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[00:45:51.277 --> 00:45:54.100]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[00:45:54.381 --> 00:45:57.945]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:00.828]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, Conor.
[00:46:00.908 --> 00:46:04.170]  So, I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.612]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[00:46:06.952 --> 00:46:12.816]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[00:46:13.236 --> 00:46:18.980]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:25.865]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:26.925]  It's all a win-win.
[00:46:27.106 --> 00:46:27.986]  That's an awesome review.
[00:46:28.046 --> 00:46:30.828]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[00:46:31.248 --> 00:46:33.308]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[00:46:33.368 --> 00:46:36.329]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Cayman reviews.
[00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:37.529]  They're all five-star.
[00:46:37.769 --> 00:46:43.130]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:47.051]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:49.151]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[00:46:49.451 --> 00:46:52.972]  Find it all, folks, at m4warsstore.com or m4warslife.com.
[00:46:52.992 --> 00:46:58.113]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:23.491]  Again, we're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast that ends coming up at 6 o'clock p.m.
[00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:24.591]  this evening with Owen Schroer.
[00:47:24.611 --> 00:47:27.412]  Got a lot of surprise guests coming on, a lot more today.
[00:47:28.792 --> 00:47:40.014]  The big thing is when you're watching us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, you name it, they admit they're blocking when we become number one at going to the front pages, and they're blocking people who are subscribers from seeing it.
[00:47:41.095 --> 00:47:47.396]  You have to hand-share it to get this information out, but we've come so far, we're beginning to win.
[00:47:48.626 --> 00:47:52.448]  And we're forcing Google and Facebook and Twitter to admit they're censoring.
[00:47:53.928 --> 00:47:58.550]  We've talked to top telecommunications and antitrust lawyers as well as civil rights lawyers.
[00:47:59.971 --> 00:48:05.794]  Project Veritas video of the YouTube executive admitting they're censoring InfoWars and discriminating.
[00:48:06.534 --> 00:48:10.056]  Congressional hearings where Twitter and others admit to censoring us.
[00:48:10.756 --> 00:48:12.797]  They have the head of operations.
[00:48:13.497 --> 00:48:15.818]  Sir, we saw InfoWars was number one at lunch.
[00:48:16.398 --> 00:48:17.459]  The head of Twitter.
[00:48:18.863 --> 00:48:20.763]  is on lunch blocking us.
[00:48:21.784 --> 00:48:22.344]  And what is it?
[00:48:22.384 --> 00:48:23.724]  It's stuff like you're seeing right now.
[00:48:24.424 --> 00:48:27.065]  They know we have the big guest on.
[00:48:27.085 --> 00:48:28.325]  They know we have William Binney on.
[00:48:28.345 --> 00:48:29.685]  They know we have the whistleblowers on.
[00:48:30.046 --> 00:48:31.566]  They know we're exposing all this.
[00:48:33.106 --> 00:48:36.227]  The FBI picked up a whistleblower we had on two days ago.
[00:48:36.727 --> 00:48:37.987]  He doesn't want his full name put out.
[00:48:38.047 --> 00:48:38.487]  I had him on.
[00:48:38.507 --> 00:48:39.668]  I know who he is.
[00:48:41.068 --> 00:48:45.089]  Formerly in Army Special Operations and now in a private capacity.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.984]  About the civil war going on in the Middle East and how with Yemeni's war it's spilling over to the U.S.
[00:48:51.705 --> 00:48:52.986]  He didn't give out any classified info.
[00:48:53.006 --> 00:48:54.867]  He just gave as a citizen his analysis.
[00:48:55.188 --> 00:48:56.629]  The FBI grabbed him.
[00:48:57.369 --> 00:49:03.975]  So this isn't a soap opera where they're running and they're spies and then, oh, you're watching it and everybody makes a big deal out of it.
[00:49:04.335 --> 00:49:05.236]  This is just real.
[00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:05.837]  We're doing it.
[00:49:06.883 --> 00:49:09.625]  So, please go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:50:05.225 --> 00:50:09.948]  But we're building an even bigger studio, hiring more crew, launching more syndicated TV and radio shows.
[00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:11.570]  We are all in.
[00:50:12.492 --> 00:50:17.494]  And the more they attack, the faster we grow and the faster we just accelerate to ramming speed.
[00:50:18.155 --> 00:50:19.796]  So it is on right now.
[00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.516]  We are not playing games.
[00:50:21.796 --> 00:50:25.618]  Sabel Edmonds, let's get into the two big breaking news pieces here.
[00:50:25.638 --> 00:50:31.521]  Alex, you have been experiencing the same kind of attacks by the Twitter.
[00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:35.423]  So they are really getting aggressive.
[00:50:35.922 --> 00:50:38.263]  We have been experiencing it with YouTube as well.
[00:50:38.583 --> 00:50:43.706]  It's just it amazes me how much monopoly the deep state has the other camp.
[00:50:44.446 --> 00:51:01.575]  And before I forget, I would like to mention that it is really disappointing how some of these attorneys, whether from the White House or even in this case with General Flynn's attorneys, they keep going in this defensive mode.
[00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:08.815]  Instead of really going in on offense because they have so much ammunition.
[00:51:09.315 --> 00:51:25.511]  I tell you what, what we have gathered, what we have put out there on Director Mueller, just the conflict of interest that is huge on Fethullah Gulen, on all the quashing of the facts that relates dates back to Clinton era.
[00:51:26.411 --> 00:51:34.957]  After getting to office in 2000-2001, they can use this information and have him step down.
[00:51:35.557 --> 00:51:42.041]  But it's really disappointing to see that they keep going into this defensive mode.
[00:51:42.721 --> 00:51:55.449]  Because I know of several veteran, highly decorated FBI agents, if subpoenaed, they would testify on how Robert Mueller,
[00:51:56.274 --> 00:51:57.075]  Do you think
[00:52:18.075 --> 00:52:29.549]  Not only they have been going on this constant offensive, but on top of that, they have been leaking, like Steve, but leaking misinformation lies.
[00:52:30.209 --> 00:52:32.272]  And here is one of my breaking news here.
[00:52:33.647 --> 00:52:50.622]  Some people involved with cases of General Flynn, because there are several cases they have concocted, none of them, none of them legitimate case, they have issued gag order and they are preventing them now from twinning, okay?
[00:52:50.722 --> 00:52:57.508]  That's one piece of information to tell you how much of one-sided power we are talking about here.
[00:52:58.088 --> 00:53:00.010]  They have been issuing gag orders
[00:53:01.439 --> 00:53:11.691]  On these people who are the targets of this investigation, and in this case, the General Flynn's case, you're looking at a completely wrongful case because there is nothing.
[00:53:12.091 --> 00:53:14.454]  There is not a single criminal case.
[00:53:14.554 --> 00:53:15.636]  Wow, so be clear on that.
[00:53:15.696 --> 00:53:18.018]  Specifically, who's been issued gag orders?
[00:53:19.399 --> 00:53:27.541]  Uh, I cannot right now name the individuals, but there have been people connected to the case who have been tweeting.
[00:53:27.982 --> 00:53:32.783]  You're saying outside, outside of Manafort and his deputy, because we know those gag orders were issued.
[00:53:32.803 --> 00:53:36.984]  Yes, outside, outside Manafort and his deputies, okay?
[00:53:37.604 --> 00:53:43.526]  This also applies even though no indictments, no arrest warrant has yet, you know, been served.
[00:53:43.926 --> 00:53:46.028]  That is simply amazing.
[00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:49.952]  Not only are they banning and blocking Roger Stone on Twitter, who they're accusing of being a Russian agent.
[00:53:50.492 --> 00:53:56.318]  I mean, they silenced you as they demonized you, and now we learn they've done it to, I guess you're saying Flynn.
[00:53:56.738 --> 00:53:58.460]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:53:59.381 --> 00:54:02.964]  How are you supposed to defend yourself against misinformation?
[00:54:03.504 --> 00:54:09.749]  We actually put out information and had people, some of these publications, retract information.
[00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:23.160]  One of them was this guy, this journalist Chuck Ross, who got the documents from the White House, this is Obama White House, in November 2016, before Obama left the White House.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.143]  He was handed all these lies on General Flynn, he published,
[00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:32.925]  After all the pressure from us and from some of the other sources, they retract.
[00:54:32.965 --> 00:54:34.105]  But you know how they retract?
[00:54:34.506 --> 00:54:35.687]  These little tiny funds.
[00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:36.147]  Exactly.
[00:54:36.167 --> 00:54:38.709]  Well, it's just like Comey lied and said he wasn't leaking info.
[00:54:38.749 --> 00:54:40.090]  Then it turned out he was the leaker.
[00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.991]  But he goes, oh, I gave it to another journalist.
[00:54:42.491 --> 00:54:43.692]  I gave it to a professor.
[00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:45.834]  Cybele Edmonds is our guest right now.
[00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:47.735]  Amazingnewsbud.com.
[00:54:47.815 --> 00:54:48.936]  Everybody's got to get this out.
[00:54:48.956 --> 00:54:49.957]  But what a bombshell.
[00:54:50.397 --> 00:54:51.498]  You were in the FBI.
[00:54:51.798 --> 00:54:53.820]  High-level counterterrorism, as everybody knows.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:55:04.662]  You're saying you have FBI sources who are ready to expose Mueller right now for his connections and conflicts of interest with the Gulan network or what other areas?
[00:55:05.981 --> 00:55:16.993]  For example, if subpoenaed, whether these FBI agents or myself, we can name the files because they have multiple investigations on Ghulam dating back to 1999.
[00:55:17.153 --> 00:55:22.258]  Okay, this is the terrorist, radical terrorist, Mullah Fetullah Ghulam.
[00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:24.280]  And by the way, let's be clear, it was folks leaking info.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.301]  By Bill Clinton.
[00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.282]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:27.524]  Yes.
[00:55:28.132 --> 00:55:35.760]  And we, white collar crime, under terrorism investigations, under counterintelligence and espionage investigations since 1999.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:44.248]  And it was Bill Clinton's Janet Reno's office that started quashing this information.
[00:55:44.268 --> 00:55:49.914]  And it was afterwards Robert Mueller who quashed this information.
[00:55:50.566 --> 00:56:01.177]  And now he's using what he did, okay, and this is General Flynn, by standing for the Americans' interests, against the terrorists' interests.
[00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:08.926]  Sure, we know the whole Saudi Arabia network, the globalists, are hooked in with Bush Sr., Obama, the Clintons, Mueller, they're all bag men making money.
[00:56:09.446 --> 00:56:12.748]  What is your intel on the raids and the shakeup in Saudi Arabia?
[00:56:13.129 --> 00:56:19.073]  Our intel is it's cutting off the globalist connections and power in Saudi Arabia they were using back here in the U.S.
[00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:21.034]  and that Trump is rolling up these networks.
[00:56:22.155 --> 00:56:25.217]  We've been getting conflicting reports on that.
[00:56:26.017 --> 00:56:36.845]  I know there are some factions who are trying to link this to Iran, okay, and they want the after effects, let's call it aftershocks,
[00:56:37.424 --> 00:56:42.065]  Still over into what what's taking place and what's going to take place with Iran.
[00:56:42.485 --> 00:56:46.266]  I think it's a bit too early to tell.
[00:56:46.907 --> 00:56:52.068]  But we had the roundtable discussion at news but about three three and a half months ago.
[00:56:52.608 --> 00:56:57.089]  And that was one of the predictions I made because people were talking about the 28 pages.
[00:56:57.149 --> 00:57:00.010]  I said Saudi Arabia is also on the list you know.
[00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.230]  Gotta go to break!
[00:57:18.438 --> 00:57:18.958]  Stay right there.
[00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:22.840]  We'll be back in about a minute and a half with Zabel Edmonds with the other big breaking news.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.962]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:26.982 --> 00:57:30.503]  We're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast right now.
[00:57:30.543 --> 00:57:32.044]  Our regular show time is 11 a.m.
[00:57:32.064 --> 00:57:32.964]  to 3 p.m.
[00:57:32.984 --> 00:57:39.387]  Central, but we're in the middle of a 34-hour global transmission, the one-year anniversary of the Trump victory.
[00:57:39.667 --> 00:57:40.728]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:40.748 --> 00:57:41.168]  Stay with us.
[00:57:54.127 --> 00:57:54.507]  Carnivore.
[00:57:54.547 --> 00:57:56.168]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[00:57:56.629 --> 00:57:57.509]  All very affordable.
[00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:59.370]  33% off, out of the gates.
[00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.252]  The thing I am so ultra excited about.
[00:58:02.272 --> 00:58:04.293]  Because I like a high protein diet and I love meat.
[00:58:04.313 --> 00:58:10.277]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[00:58:10.497 --> 00:58:15.140]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.941]  That's why you get more and more heartburn.
[00:58:17.521 --> 00:58:22.827]  Stomach aches as you get older and can't eat rich foods you could eat before is because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[00:58:22.867 --> 00:58:24.849]  This is next level beyond probiotic.
[00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.611]  I've been taking this for two months.
[00:58:27.739 --> 00:58:31.441]  As it was getting prepared, it was getting ready, and man, I'm telling you, it is incredible.
[00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:34.062]  Normally, you eat a big steak for a day or two, you're tired.
[00:58:34.602 --> 00:58:37.803]  Doesn't happen anymore with this, and never have any issues.
[00:58:37.843 --> 00:58:42.566]  You know, I ate that 20-ounce rib eye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[00:58:42.646 --> 00:58:45.647]  It's called Carnivore Digestive Enzymes.
[00:58:45.847 --> 00:58:50.209]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.
[00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:52.110]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:56.952]  People that are on these ketosis diets, and Atkins type diets, and paleo diets,
[00:58:57.592 --> 00:58:58.572]  It's just amazing.
[00:58:58.592 --> 00:58:59.533]  Made in the USA.
[00:58:59.753 --> 00:59:00.653]  Non-GMO.
[00:59:00.853 --> 00:59:06.796]  It's delivered directly into the stomach where it's needed with the digestive enzymes that your body needs with the acids to do this.

[00:59:12.058 --> 00:59:13.318]  Introducing Carnivore.

[00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:22.081]  Man, I used to eat a big steak and didn't feel tired.
[00:59:22.141 --> 00:59:22.942]  I eat one now, I get tired.
[00:59:22.962 --> 00:59:23.582]  Started taking this.
[00:59:24.142 --> 00:59:24.362]  Boom.
[00:59:24.422 --> 00:59:25.103]  Ate a big rib eye.
[00:59:25.143 --> 00:59:25.403]  Boom.
[00:59:25.443 --> 00:59:25.983]  Eat two of these.
[00:59:26.023 --> 00:59:26.484]  Eat one of these.
[00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:27.745]  It's incredible.
[00:59:27.785 --> 00:59:28.665]  Digest it better.
[00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:29.826]  Aren't tired the next day.
[00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:30.567]  Don't get heartburn.
[00:59:30.587 --> 00:59:31.127]  Don't get stomachache.
[00:59:31.407 --> 00:59:35.070]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive enzyme.
[00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.211]  So Carnivore is next level.
[00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:38.752]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:38.852 --> 00:59:39.733]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:39.753 --> 00:59:43.315]  It's the big umbrella site, but InfoWarsLive.com takes you right to it.
[00:59:43.636 --> 00:59:44.316]  Carnivore.
[00:59:44.476 --> 00:59:45.717]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:45.897 --> 00:59:47.338]  InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.553 --> 01:00:00.559]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.526]  Well, here we are.
[01:00:04.986 --> 01:00:06.849]  The day before Thanksgiving.
[01:00:08.368 --> 01:00:11.009]  Wednesday, the 22nd day of November 2017.
[01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:16.151]  And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.191 --> 01:00:18.372]  I'm your humble host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.392 --> 01:00:31.318]  But this operation that we're involved in is nothing short of the attempt to not just save Western civilization in the Renaissance, but to save the defense of basic human enlightenment, period.
[01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:37.708]  You know, last weekend, we posted videos on Infowars.com.
[01:00:38.089 --> 01:01:00.116]  Some of them were live feeds of Owen Schroeder, Millie Weaver, Harrison, Smith, and others, our crew members out on the streets of Austin, Texas, covering a Hillary Clinton book signing, but also covering a so-called Antifa-Anti-Trump demonstration.
[01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:04.053]  And this stuff just writes itself.
[01:01:04.513 --> 01:01:06.875]  No wonder some people think these videos we put out are fake.
[01:01:08.355 --> 01:01:22.985]  Because you've got a guy in a chicken suit who can barely talk, gibbering and cussing and threatening people, breaking our microphone and then running with police chasing a guy in a chicken suit like something out of a comedy, but it was serious.
[01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:29.009]  I gotta say 400, 500 yards with our reporters chasing after the police.
[01:01:31.203 --> 01:01:33.364]  It was bike police on bikes chasing a guy on foot.
[01:01:34.445 --> 01:01:36.485]  So who can make that up?
[01:01:36.546 --> 01:01:42.588]  And the fact that the anti-Trump people are literally drooling zombies.
[01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:47.371]  I mean, most of them, they admit, are paid by Soros and the Democratic Party.
[01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.492]  These are the dregs of the earth.
[01:01:49.912 --> 01:01:52.173]  It's not like just one or two out of the crowd were like that.
[01:01:54.094 --> 01:01:56.495]  Every one of these people is like a
[01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.565]  Unspeakably stupid, mindless idiot.
[01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:04.707]  And then there were a few well-spoken, nice people there.
[01:02:04.727 --> 01:02:08.729]  I guess who just didn't like Trump.
[01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:13.453]  And then they were black folks that were also listeners.
[01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:14.794]  So we had those interviews too.
[01:02:16.095 --> 01:02:18.556]  And so I could see not liking Trump and not liking Clinton or something.
[01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:20.257]  I'm being a Bernie Sanders guy, so you're out.
[01:02:20.418 --> 01:02:20.738]  Whatever.
[01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:25.419]  And then we've got Millie Weaver who was also out there but separately at the book signing.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:34.209]  I mean just every other woman going F you and trying to grab her microphone away as she walks down the sidewalk just trying to talk to people.
[01:02:34.229 --> 01:02:38.454]  They're so programmed that we're so evil in InfoWars that that happened.
[01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:41.918]  These people are really screwed up and it's getting worse.
[01:02:43.644 --> 01:02:54.358]  And you know, I've been around the country and around the world, and you go to some little poor fishing villages in Honduras, the people look alive, they look upright, they look savvy, they look smart.
[01:02:56.806 --> 01:03:01.029]  But you go to poor areas of Austin or other areas now, people look like they've been hit with a mutation race.
[01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:02.630]  They look like they're dying.
[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:04.871]  They walk like they're zombies.
[01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:05.751]  They look like they're zombies.
[01:03:06.072 --> 01:03:08.853]  White people, black people, Asian, Hispanic, they look dead.
[01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:10.254]  It's not just that they're poor.
[01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:11.295]  They're aimless.
[01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:12.836]  They're TV heads.
[01:03:13.476 --> 01:03:14.537]  Most of them are unemployed.
[01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:20.200]  And it just shows you what domestication does to people.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:24.103]  And that's why what we're doing is such an important fight, ladies and gentlemen, because
[01:03:25.467 --> 01:03:31.568]  The Democratic Party and its constituents are slaves of the system.
[01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:33.829]  And the Republican leadership is just as bad or worse.
[01:03:34.529 --> 01:03:37.210]  But we're having an insurrection within the Republican Party.
[01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.870]  So this is such a historical thing we're talking about.
[01:03:40.871 --> 01:03:46.532]  You know, with Thanksgiving tomorrow, I'd like to again thank all my listeners for their love and support.
[01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:54.249]  As men age, they may often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:03:54.269 --> 01:04:03.051]  Supermill Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance and produce superior vitality in males.
[01:04:03.711 --> 01:04:07.172]  We rarely have it this special, but I did it recently.
[01:04:07.212 --> 01:04:07.632]  People love it.
[01:04:07.652 --> 01:04:08.432]  I'm doing it again.
[01:04:09.092 --> 01:04:10.973]  Supermill Vitality right now is 50% off.
[01:04:13.098 --> 01:04:13.938]  With free shipping.
[01:04:14.259 --> 01:04:17.680]  And when I did this with 50% off a few months ago, it was not free shipping.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.441]  So this is as good a deal as we ever do, if not the best.
[01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:26.344]  We're also introducing a sales on Infowars Life Living Defense.
[01:04:27.044 --> 01:04:27.965]  All supplies last.
[01:04:28.005 --> 01:04:29.085]  That's been sold out for a while.
[01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:30.146]  You can get it for only $22.
[01:04:30.186 --> 01:04:32.347]  That's 50% off.
[01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:33.768]  It is super high quality.
[01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:34.628]  People absolutely love it.
[01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:36.229]  Flushes out the parent sites.
[01:04:36.929 --> 01:04:38.370]  That is so many other amazing things.
[01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:43.673]  And the specials for the last two days are extended as well, but some of those are about to have to end.
[01:04:43.693 --> 01:04:45.354]  Brain Force, 50% off.
[01:04:45.374 --> 01:04:47.355]  25% off Pro Pure Items.
[01:04:47.395 --> 01:04:48.596]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[01:04:49.056 --> 01:04:50.177]  Knockout, 50% off.
[01:04:50.497 --> 01:04:53.058]  But we're going to have to, again, stop that very, very soon.
[01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:57.521]  But the new special, right now, again, Super Bowl Vitality and Living Defense.
[01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.842]  We'll be back on the other side of this transmission.
[01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.243]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:03.144]  Without you, there is no InfoWar.
[01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:09.204]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:05:10.005 --> 01:05:12.947]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:05:13.607 --> 01:05:16.409]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:21.913]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:05:22.273 --> 01:05:28.577]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:05:28.937 --> 01:05:34.101]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:38.204]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:46.589]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:05:47.169 --> 01:05:51.512]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:05:51.852 --> 01:05:55.775]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[01:05:56.075 --> 01:05:59.897]  Stay in the game with Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[01:06:00.137 --> 01:06:01.798]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:10.698 --> 01:06:13.041]  What's his name?
[01:06:14.423 --> 01:06:24.716]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:06:24.736 --> 01:06:28.200]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:06:34.063 --> 01:06:36.223]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:06:36.263 --> 01:06:36.624]  Louis.
[01:06:36.924 --> 01:06:44.006]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:48.688]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:06:48.968 --> 01:06:49.988]  Guns will be taken.
[01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:51.089]  No one will ever be armed.
[01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:52.189]  We will take our weapons.
[01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:54.892]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:06:54.952 --> 01:06:59.338]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:06:59.498 --> 01:06:59.858]  Enough.
[01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:00.679]  Enough.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:01.541]  Enough.
[01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:02.522]  Enough.
[01:07:02.622 --> 01:07:07.148]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:07:07.248 --> 01:07:11.173]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:07:13.314 --> 01:07:26.683]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:07:26.703 --> 01:07:29.365]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.212]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:07:32.893 --> 01:07:38.899]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:07:39.179 --> 01:07:43.864]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:07:44.164 --> 01:07:48.849]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:07:56.616 --> 01:08:01.641]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:03.463]  You're in your apartment!
[01:08:03.503 --> 01:08:04.264]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:05.525]  You're back in song right now?
[01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.426]  I am inside.
[01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:07.748]  I have two words for you.
[01:08:08.609 --> 01:08:09.450]  Predator gloves.
[01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:11.412]  You will never see it coming.
[01:08:15.484 --> 01:08:17.946]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:08:18.366 --> 01:08:27.551]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:32.914]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:08:33.094 --> 01:08:37.897]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:08:38.177 --> 01:08:40.259]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.341]  We are on the march.
[01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.202]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:08:46.562 --> 01:08:51.324]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:11.922]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:09:11.962 --> 01:09:14.686]  This is the heart of 1776!
[01:09:23.084 --> 01:09:26.307]  I think every little kid dreams about being famous and being in movies.
[01:09:26.647 --> 01:09:27.608]  This is California.
[01:09:27.628 --> 01:09:28.529]  This is where you make it.
[01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:29.950]  This is where it all starts.
[01:09:31.031 --> 01:09:32.712]  You'll get signed by a label.
[01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:34.274]  You can star on Disney Channel.
[01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:36.336]  You know, what kid wouldn't want that, right?
[01:09:39.458 --> 01:09:43.302]  I remember you asked me if I ever did anything with the guy before.
[01:09:43.362 --> 01:09:44.663]  I was not interested at 12.
[01:09:48.737 --> 01:09:54.621]  Hollywood doesn't have any system in place to protect anybody, and children are way down on that list.
[01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:59.644]  Children need management just like everybody else.
[01:09:59.964 --> 01:10:00.805]  Everybody liked him.
[01:10:00.865 --> 01:10:02.286]  He became part of the family.
[01:10:02.526 --> 01:10:05.608]  In the beginning it was happy, and then things started changing.
[01:10:05.648 --> 01:10:09.631]  They found people who they know will be victims.
[01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:12.173]  You have an adult who is manipulating the child.
[01:10:13.456 --> 01:10:15.497]  He's getting, you know, hired on the spot like that.
[01:10:15.537 --> 01:10:16.417]  That had never happened before.
[01:10:16.577 --> 01:10:18.999]  It was obvious that something was going on.
[01:10:19.819 --> 01:10:21.880]  The party made me feel uncomfortable.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.382]  There were lots of drugs available, and there were young teenage boys.
[01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:26.922]  I remember being scared.
[01:10:26.942 --> 01:10:28.743]  He just told me, this is what you have to do.
[01:10:28.763 --> 01:10:32.045]  A number of boys told me to point the gun at them, just like that.
[01:10:32.265 --> 01:10:34.386]  He said, do you not understand the power I have?
[01:10:38.046 --> 01:10:40.528]  I remember sitting in my room and crying my eyes out.
[01:10:40.568 --> 01:10:41.849]  He said, what would you do?
[01:10:41.869 --> 01:10:43.230]  That happened to me.
[01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:48.595]  A lot of investors completely denied that anything was going on.
[01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:51.477]  Clearly the studio didn't want an investigation.
[01:10:52.318 --> 01:10:55.380]  I hated when you tried to have me sleep in your bed and touch me.
[01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:58.783]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:10:58.803 --> 01:11:02.146]  There will always be a steady stream of kids who want to be famous.
[01:11:03.007 --> 01:11:05.449]  We're absolutely talking about the tip of an iceberg.
[01:11:09.908 --> 01:11:11.176]  It wasn't uncommon.
[01:11:11.337 --> 01:11:12.344]  Let's put it that way.
[01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:30.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's even been in mainstream news the last week that Harvey Weinstein hired a convicted pedophile who raped a 12-year-old boy on a previous set of a Disney film to come direct another film.
[01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:37.663]  That's just one example, and it's been said that one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[01:11:37.763 --> 01:11:43.084]  Well, if you find out about one child that's been kidnapped or one child that's been raped, it's a tragedy, it's an outrage.
[01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:43.645]  If it's 10,000 or a million,
[01:11:45.345 --> 01:11:46.166]  It's just a statistic.
[01:11:46.986 --> 01:11:58.353]  Now, Gabe Hoffman, I've been hearing about this film in production for years, and from even law enforcement sources, and Hollywood tried to block the film from coming out, but just days ago he released it, and it's got over a million views.
[01:11:58.413 --> 01:11:58.794]  It's free.
[01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:03.216]  It needs to have a hundred million views, but we know Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others try to block it.
[01:12:03.256 --> 01:12:04.017]  They've been doing that.
[01:12:04.317 --> 01:12:05.458]  So it's up on Vimeo.
[01:12:05.878 --> 01:12:09.400]  I'm having it posted as we speak to InfoWars.com.
[01:12:10.541 --> 01:12:13.824]  And to NewsWars.com, and I'm going to have Paul Watson retweet it.
[01:12:14.224 --> 01:12:17.026]  He's got one of the top Twitter accounts for actual engagement.
[01:12:17.046 --> 01:12:20.910]  We're going to send it out on Paul's Twitter at Prison Planet as well.
[01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.211]  Gabe Hoffman is the producer.
[01:12:22.931 --> 01:12:29.537]  He is a successful producer and a philanthropist who put a lot of his money into this very professional, groundbreaking film.
[01:12:29.897 --> 01:12:34.421]  Facebook.com, an open secret documentary, an open secret at Twitter.
[01:12:34.461 --> 01:12:35.422]  Everybody should follow it.
[01:12:36.002 --> 01:12:40.924]  And this is a short segment because I played the trailer, but tell people a little bit about yourself.
[01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:43.626]  We're going to go down the rabbit hole here into this den of vipers.
[01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:49.589]  And then we're going to contemporarily, you have a statement to read to the pedophile elite on there, kind of a challenge at the end of the interview.
[01:12:50.049 --> 01:12:57.832]  And we also have all the big breaking stings just this week of 277 arrests of pedophiles reportedly and kidnapped children in Florida.
[01:12:58.773 --> 01:13:04.876]  17 arrested this week in Colorado and Wyoming, as young as three months old being sold to be raped.
[01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:09.997]  I mean, this is mainstream news here, so the media tries to act like this isn't happening.
[01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:10.997]  Local news covers it.
[01:13:11.357 --> 01:13:12.998]  National news pretty much ignores it.
[01:13:13.538 --> 01:13:15.478]  So, Gabe, tell us about yourself.
[01:13:15.498 --> 01:13:26.921]  I know you've been a successful producer in films and other things, and also in capital management, but what made you take on this, one of the most evil things in the world?
[01:13:27.041 --> 01:13:27.541]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:13:28.061 --> 01:13:28.481]  Sure.
[01:13:28.661 --> 01:13:28.882]  Thanks.
[01:13:28.922 --> 01:13:29.922]  Great to be here with you, Alex.
[01:13:30.303 --> 01:13:32.244]  You know, I'm a hedge fund manager.
[01:13:32.484 --> 01:13:35.586]  I've been a hedge fund manager when I was 23 years old.
[01:13:36.127 --> 01:13:38.848]  Back in 2000, I was the youngest hedge fund manager on Wall Street.
[01:13:38.988 --> 01:13:39.889]  Started my own firm.
[01:13:40.429 --> 01:13:41.070]  Been blessed.
[01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:42.511]  Very successful.
[01:13:42.931 --> 01:13:43.592]  Very fortunate.
[01:13:44.192 --> 01:13:46.854]  My buddy, Matt Valentinas, new from NYU undergrad.
[01:13:47.294 --> 01:13:48.155]  He went to film school.
[01:13:48.195 --> 01:13:49.255]  He worked in Hollywood for 15 years.
[01:13:50.757 --> 01:13:56.903]  And we were talking about how to do good and things like that, and he said, look, I know Hollywood has a big pedophile problem.
[01:13:56.943 --> 01:13:58.045]  It just needs to be exposed.
[01:13:58.945 --> 01:14:00.227]  I said, well, I'm not a film guy.
[01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:01.048]  Never done that.
[01:14:02.489 --> 01:14:03.850]  Let's get the research.
[01:14:04.938 --> 01:14:08.481]  So, with Disarming Films, we wrote just a research contract.
[01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:12.905]  We didn't know that there would be enough to make a film, or at least I didn't know that at the time.
[01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:20.291]  A few months later, after Disarming Films, private investigators and all that, we had two binders.
[01:14:21.656 --> 01:14:23.238]  Of Hollywood convicted pedophiles.
[01:14:23.899 --> 01:14:24.580]  They're victims.
[01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:31.030]  Sometimes, in many cases, actually getting hired by their pedophile buddies afterwards to go work on film sets.
[01:14:32.332 --> 01:14:34.876]  Raping and abusing kids on film sets, it was unbelievable.
[01:14:35.812 --> 01:14:39.515]  And I said, gosh, this is the easiest check I'll ever write to fund making this film.
[01:14:39.535 --> 01:14:48.621]  And it's an over million-and-a-half budget, full-feature documentary with an Oscar-nominated director for her work in another area.
[01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:54.965]  You know, it's funny, Amy Berg, our director, she got an Oscar nomination when she exposed pedophilia in the Catholic Church a few years earlier.
[01:14:54.985 --> 01:14:55.305]  That's right.
[01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:57.026]  But she exposes it in Hollywood and they don't care.
[01:14:57.046 --> 01:14:58.607]  I forgot to say, she's super famous for that, yeah.
[01:14:58.687 --> 01:15:00.949]  Yeah, but then when... And even back then they denied it was going on.
[01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:01.489]  Right.
[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.711]  But then in Hollywood, when she does it, all of a sudden they don't care.
[01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:05.412]  So go figure.
[01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:20.220]  I forgot that your director, she's the famous Amy Berg, one of the biggest chinks in the corrupt Vatican's armor, and now the Deputy Pope, the number two guy, has been arrested for over a hundred young boys, kidnapped, trafficked, raped.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.461]  I mean, it's massive.
[01:15:22.221 --> 01:15:22.701]  Absolutely.
[01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:29.865]  And I'm so pleased exclusively with you on InfoWars to announce we had made this free on Vimeo through the 22nd.
[01:15:30.266 --> 01:15:32.487]  Again, it's got over a million views already in a week.
[01:15:33.556 --> 01:15:41.102]  We are going to make it free through October 31st for everybody to celebrate all these Hollywood pedophiles getting exposed just this week.
[01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:41.702]  Wow!
[01:15:42.022 --> 01:15:42.342]  Awesome!
[01:15:42.863 --> 01:15:52.490]  Again, folks, on all our Twitter accounts, on Paul Watson's, on yours, all of you, we can get around them because YouTube and Google and all of them admit they are censoring, especially this.
[01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:58.874]  They do not want these powerful... I mean, they even took one of the top stars off Twitter because she said that Weinstein raped her.
[01:15:59.195 --> 01:16:02.137]  Even though Weinstein settled with her, they were...
[01:16:03.732 --> 01:16:13.358]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[01:16:14.078 --> 01:16:15.879]  They fear families living together.
[01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:18.841]  They fear people loving God.
[01:16:18.921 --> 01:16:23.584]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[01:16:24.885 --> 01:16:32.109]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[01:16:34.093 --> 01:16:40.535]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[01:16:42.095 --> 01:16:48.197]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[01:16:49.097 --> 01:17:02.181]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[01:17:03.194 --> 01:17:09.779]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:18.846]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:21.748]  And so many things will happen.
[01:17:22.949 --> 01:17:23.930]  We are the majority.
[01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:33.592]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[01:17:34.753 --> 01:17:39.760]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[01:17:41.206 --> 01:17:43.647]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[01:17:44.487 --> 01:17:52.691]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[01:17:53.371 --> 01:17:59.734]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:02.495]  So many people write me.
[01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:11.575]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[01:18:12.315 --> 01:18:13.917]  We have to fly our flag.
[01:18:14.929 --> 01:18:16.389]  We have to wear our colors.
[01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:21.311]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:24.832]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[01:18:25.052 --> 01:18:36.295]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[01:18:36.535 --> 01:18:38.556]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[01:18:39.136 --> 01:18:41.297]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[01:18:41.637 --> 01:18:43.997]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[01:18:44.418 --> 01:18:51.059]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.201]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[01:18:57.081 --> 01:19:04.086]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.388]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[01:19:07.769 --> 01:19:24.761]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[01:19:25.541 --> 01:19:34.289]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[01:19:34.949 --> 01:19:39.634]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the Info War.
[01:19:39.654 --> 01:19:51.544]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[01:19:51.864 --> 01:19:52.325]  So please,
[01:19:52.765 --> 01:19:58.109]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:59.911]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:12.999]  Police have identified four victims and plan on more than just the four murder charges filed today.
[01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:15.520]  Confirmed earlier reports of cannibalism.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.421]  The building was a scene of ghoulish slaughter.
[01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:20.282]  Large kettle on the stove which held royal body parts.
[01:20:20.362 --> 01:20:22.723]  Identified four victims and killed even more.
[01:20:22.763 --> 01:20:25.625]  Plan on more than just the four murder charges filed today.
[01:20:25.685 --> 01:20:28.106]  Had sex with some of his victims before he killed them.
[01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:30.567]  And that he was also a necrophiliac.
[01:20:34.119 --> 01:20:38.248]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:39.029 --> 01:20:40.432]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:20:42.574 --> 01:20:44.375]  Well, Gabe Hoffman really is a hero.
[01:20:44.395 --> 01:20:46.575]  I've heard about production of this film for several years.
[01:20:47.156 --> 01:20:52.697]  I've heard really good things from law enforcement sources we have about the fact that they've been wanting to go after pedophile networks.
[01:20:52.737 --> 01:21:00.380]  You see a five, six-fold increase of pedophiles, not just people with child porn, but people actually with children as young as three months old that are being raped.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:09.363]  I have a stack of mainstream news, but from local TV stations from Florida to Colorado to California just this week with hundreds of kids here, 88 kids here, 27 kids here, 14 kids there.
[01:21:12.344 --> 01:21:16.747]  I mean, in actual sex slavery, but it never hits big national news.
[01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:18.328]  It's incredible.
[01:21:18.348 --> 01:21:21.611]  So we've been telling you, this whole Weinstein thing is a controlled demolition.
[01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:23.132]  They know this is all coming out.
[01:21:24.127 --> 01:21:29.990]  The Lolita Express, as you just heard, he's under investigation for flying around with Jerry Epstein and Bill Clinton on that plane.
[01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:34.052]  They flew the young girls, we're talking 10, 11, 12 years old, to this island.
[01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:35.052]  That's what we know of.
[01:21:36.113 --> 01:21:39.034]  There are going to have to be loading girls that young on planes with them.
[01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.816]  You know out in the Caribbean there's even crazier stuff going on.
[01:21:42.096 --> 01:21:43.597]  So Gabe Hoffman, amazing.
[01:21:43.937 --> 01:21:46.158]  So you start investigating this as a very successful
[01:21:46.898 --> 01:21:48.479]  Capital management firm.
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.461]  You start investigating it.
[01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:55.704]  You go down the rabbit hole, just recapping, and found all these cases of convicted Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:21:55.764 --> 01:22:06.792]  As you mentioned, in the film, now there's new cases, during Weinstein years, Disney hired child molester to direct film who raped and was convicted a 12 year old boy on the set to be around children again.
[01:22:07.412 --> 01:22:09.233]  So this is how the rabbit hole began.
[01:22:09.253 --> 01:22:10.274]  You've got the floor now.
[01:22:10.694 --> 01:22:18.579]  Get into the film, which you're offering free right now, to everybody until Halloween at InfoWars.com because they tried to suppress it and tried to block it.
[01:22:18.599 --> 01:22:22.361]  You put a million and a half dollars of your own money into this with your great crew.
[01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:23.302]  That's why you're a hero.
[01:22:23.642 --> 01:22:24.562]  They tried to block it.
[01:22:24.642 --> 01:22:25.963]  Well, they're not going to block it.
[01:22:26.303 --> 01:22:27.584]  It's free, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:27.624 --> 01:22:28.865]  It's up to you to get this out.
[01:22:29.085 --> 01:22:29.966]  So again, I want to commend you.
[01:22:30.626 --> 01:22:31.147]  Thanks Alex.
[01:22:31.167 --> 01:22:37.953]  You know, the real heroes are the brave survivors and victims who came forward on our show, on our film.
[01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:39.515]  We didn't pay them a dime.
[01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:41.217]  We didn't black out their faces.
[01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:43.519]  We didn't hide their names.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:44.540]  Nothing.
[01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:51.006]  It was the highest standards of journalism and they had to name their accusers and there had to be actual proof or
[01:22:51.667 --> 01:23:04.502]  In one case, we actually unmasked a pedophile who was one of the biggest child managers in Hollywood over the last 30-40 years, and he fesses up on camera in an open secret.
[01:23:05.424 --> 01:23:08.427]  You know, there was just a major breaking news last night.
[01:23:08.527 --> 01:23:10.169]  The mainstream media hasn't picked it up yet.
[01:23:11.009 --> 01:23:16.915]  Tyler Gresham, he's a major, major representative of young stars.
[01:23:17.435 --> 01:23:25.163]  And a young man named Blaise Littman, you know, came out on Facebook and otherwise accusing him of drugging him and raping him when he was underage.
[01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:28.372]  This is just the tip of the iceberg, like we say in the film.
[01:23:28.412 --> 01:23:42.527]  So the women having the courage to go public, now we're learning with Weinstein, it goes into 17, 16, Roman Polanski raping, ain't only a 13-year-old girl, media covers it up, then Meryl Streep gives him standing ovations and says he did nothing wrong.
[01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:46.892]  Oh, it's amazing, I mean... Let me tell you something, I got a 13-year-old daughter, you rape her, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.260]  It's amazing.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:24:03.006]  You see those Hollywood award shows where Roman Polanski, they give him awards and they put it on screen and the place is, you know, standing ovation and he's not even there to get the award in person because he's not allowed back in the country.
[01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:04.927]  He was convicted and he fled.
[01:24:04.947 --> 01:24:06.507]  That's just Hollywood.
[01:24:06.547 --> 01:24:09.849]  And Weinstein has, you notice, run to Europe as well.
[01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:16.548]  Absolutely, and we have a rumor that we'll talk about later that a major Hollywood figure may have already just run to Europe.
[01:24:16.768 --> 01:24:20.010]  Hopefully the InfoWars folks can help track it down on the internet.
[01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.332]  Please continue, because you've got these binders over here.
[01:24:22.652 --> 01:24:23.312]  Let's just begin.
[01:24:23.712 --> 01:24:29.896]  Hundreds and hundreds of convicted pedophiles over the years, super high level, covered up in the media, then they're rehired with kids again!
[01:24:30.376 --> 01:24:30.776]  Absolutely.
[01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:34.499]  And what you were talking about earlier is Victor Salva.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.041]  Everybody's heard of the Jeepers Creepers franchise.
[01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:38.542]  That's Victor Salva.
[01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:39.783]  He's the director of it.
[01:24:40.084 --> 01:24:43.146]  And Jeepers Creepers 3 was just out this year.
[01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:43.526]  Oh, funny.
[01:24:43.566 --> 01:24:44.907]  He's into demon clowns.
[01:24:44.967 --> 01:24:46.048]  He's into demon clowns.
[01:24:46.489 --> 01:24:47.089]  Absolutely.
[01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:47.569]  You got it.
[01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:56.294]  So, we have exclusively at InfoWars, the unopened secret, internal, Hollywood pedophile map.
[01:24:57.034 --> 01:24:59.615]  Because there are just connections with these pedophiles.
[01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:03.977]  And by the way, we're going to add that map to the film that we're about to post to InfoWars.com, but let's put it on screen.
[01:25:04.117 --> 01:25:05.158]  The pedophile map, there it is.
[01:25:05.938 --> 01:25:07.459]  They're all friends.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.660]  They know each other.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.061]  They manage the same children.
[01:25:10.321 --> 01:25:15.405]  A manager who's a pedophile will put the child on the pedophile's show.
[01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:18.807]  They will hire each other, even after their convictions.
[01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:26.032]  I mean, it's not just Brian Peck working on Charlie Sheen's show, Anger Management, 10 years after his conviction.
[01:25:26.392 --> 01:25:29.514]  It's Brian Peck working on big things like Jack and the Beanstalk.
[01:25:29.574 --> 01:25:33.897]  It's just amazing how convicted pedophiles are actually still working in Hollywood today.
[01:25:34.137 --> 01:25:35.118]  And we have to put a stop to it.
[01:25:35.678 --> 01:25:39.923]  This never happened in Hollywood with Charlie Sheen over the years that I knew him before he went wild again.
[01:25:40.623 --> 01:25:46.229]  But with other Hollywood folks or at major TV production studios, they would just sit there and go, by the way, are you a devil worshipper?
[01:25:46.249 --> 01:25:47.050]  Because we worship the devil.
[01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:48.992]  And I thought it was just a mess with me.
[01:25:49.833 --> 01:25:53.056]  But then later it's like, well, you might not want to come to this party because there might be some young girls here.
[01:25:54.057 --> 01:25:57.678]  And of course, it's just messing with you to see if you're into it.
[01:25:57.718 --> 01:25:59.598]  It's like an entrance exam.
[01:25:59.658 --> 01:26:00.838]  It's like a rite of passage.
[01:26:01.619 --> 01:26:06.540]  And that's something that, you know, you're getting to a great point because it's something that we show in an open secret.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.340]  You know, it's not just about exposing the Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.901]  It's about doing good in your community, helping you to make your children safe.
[01:26:14.221 --> 01:26:16.141]  We get you into the mind of the pedophile.
[01:26:16.402 --> 01:26:17.582]  They speak themselves.
[01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:19.642]  You learn what their justifications are.
[01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:23.303]  And we even show home videos where if you're looking closely,
[01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:31.384]  You can see the pedophile hanging out with a good American family and subtle little increasing sexualization here and there.
[01:26:31.624 --> 01:26:37.706]  You learn about their tactics, you learn about their tools, you learn about how to protect your children from them in your community.
[01:26:37.746 --> 01:26:42.646]  Because they engage in testing, they engage in training, they engage in all of this.
[01:26:43.007 --> 01:26:50.428]  And there are subtle little signs of the sexualization in terms of language and other things that we teach you about in an open secret.
[01:26:51.449 --> 01:26:56.535]  And by the way, the film, you can't stop watching it, even though it's so horrifying, because it empowers you.
[01:26:56.995 --> 01:27:00.159]  And notice, they've got cruddy films all over cable, all over Netflix, everywhere.
[01:27:00.539 --> 01:27:01.380]  But not with you guys.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.003]  A real film, how many years in the making?
[01:27:04.023 --> 01:27:08.649]  I remember hearing about this film years ago, and then now you just release it for free because they're blocking it.
[01:27:08.829 --> 01:27:12.372]  Yeah, they blocked it for two years, Alex, and they thought that we were going to go away.
[01:27:12.612 --> 01:27:12.772]  No.
[01:27:13.112 --> 01:27:16.895]  But notice the blocking seemed to only bring it out now, right when the world's ready.
[01:27:17.055 --> 01:27:18.256]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:20.558]  Well, we just waited for this Harvey Weinstein moment.
[01:27:20.618 --> 01:27:22.099]  We knew this was going to come.
[01:27:22.499 --> 01:27:23.080]  Something like this.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:23.360]  High five.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:23.900]  They would come.
[01:27:24.461 --> 01:27:25.041]  Wow, keep going.
[01:27:25.702 --> 01:27:27.343]  And so that's what we did.
[01:27:28.784 --> 01:27:40.831]  But you bring up a great point about the film, and that is that Amy did such a great job at telling the story, and it's PG-13, but I'll tell you what, you see worse things on network TV at 9 o'clock.
[01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:44.753]  Everyone should show their children, I would say as young as 8 or 9, so they understand predators.
[01:27:45.013 --> 01:27:46.534]  You're not scaring them, you're showing them.
[01:27:46.914 --> 01:27:52.417]  You know, if you were somebody a thousand years ago in Eastern Europe and there were wolves that were eating kids, you'd tell them, don't go out in the woods by yourself.
[01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:54.058]  I mean, people need to know about this danger.
[01:27:54.378 --> 01:27:56.639]  Right, but they don't use gross-out language.
[01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:57.839]  That's the beauty of it.
[01:27:57.899 --> 01:28:02.340]  They tell their tale, and you know what happened, but they don't get into explicit details.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.860]  You just know that something bad happened.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.901]  And children need to know how these predators operate.
[01:28:06.401 --> 01:28:06.901]  Absolutely.
[01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:08.241]  Absolutely.
[01:28:08.561 --> 01:28:16.903]  And one of the survivors talks about how the predator lured him in, right before he was first just raped.
[01:28:17.523 --> 01:28:20.984]  You know, the language they were using, and the examples, and the discussions they would have.
[01:28:21.144 --> 01:28:23.986]  And then how they guilt you and threaten you and control you after.
[01:28:24.326 --> 01:28:26.128]  Exactly, and they tell you that it's normal.
[01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:34.294]  You know, we've gotten in America, look, certain groups, certain beliefs, more normalized, fine, but the pedophiles want to be next.
[01:28:34.834 --> 01:28:42.620]  And now we learn at the UN everywhere, they're the ones behind it all, pushing the normalization, because that's what they want finally for them, is no limits.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.182]  We're under UN law, they're asking, they come to your door.
[01:28:46.002 --> 01:28:48.048]  And demand to date your five-year-old daughter.
[01:28:48.168 --> 01:28:51.236]  I mean, that's literally the kind of stuff that Salon and others are pushing.
[01:28:51.477 --> 01:28:53.963]  The normalization, the coming out of the pedophiles.
[01:29:02.463 --> 01:29:03.825]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:05.427]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.588 --> 01:29:06.489]  But where do you get it?

[01:30:05.393 --> 01:30:09.096]  Meet Candace Owens, the new face of the toxic right.
[01:30:09.277 --> 01:30:10.398]  Wow, thanks for coming into town.
[01:30:10.478 --> 01:30:11.498]  I'm so happy to be here.
[01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:12.179]  Great to have you.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.341]  You're even more impressive in person.
[01:30:14.641 --> 01:30:15.582]  It's wonderful to have you.
[01:30:15.962 --> 01:30:17.984]  Where should you start in the few minutes we've got to break?
[01:30:18.004 --> 01:30:22.888]  I think you should recap what the feminist cult tried to do to you, you know, in your own words.
[01:30:22.908 --> 01:30:30.235]  They just thought, basically, you're a woman, you're reportedly, you know, supposedly a minority, and so you belong to them.
[01:30:30.575 --> 01:30:31.536]  Right, absolutely.
[01:30:31.576 --> 01:30:38.939]  So long story short, I was creating, I considered myself a Democrat and a liberal about a year and a half ago as Trump was kind of rising up.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:47.924]  I was trying to build a product called Social Autopsy and essentially I thought I was creating something that was going to help stomp out bullying.
[01:30:48.564 --> 01:30:53.127]  And while I was doing that product, I was contacted by these, you know, self
[01:30:53.607 --> 01:31:14.271]  Proclaimed feminists and they basically tried to take me out the same woman that were saying that they were being attacked By anonymous trolls in the internet were telling me that they didn't want to figure out who these anonymous trolls were And long story short I figured out that these girls were harassing themselves that it was all a lie and that there was no movement of white male conservatives that were stalking and harassing these girls and when I made that statement I
[01:31:14.451 --> 01:31:17.352]  The left media came after me and tried to smear me.
[01:31:17.713 --> 01:31:21.234]  I was literally force-fed the red pill, which is why I call myself Red Pill Black.
[01:31:21.274 --> 01:31:28.117]  So here they are, running false flags against themselves, and then you were saying, running them against you, to go, oh look, see, you're under attack, honey, come join us.
[01:31:28.178 --> 01:31:30.339]  Yeah, and what they told me was that I was being attacked.
[01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:35.781]  The second I said, I'm not pulling my project, that's crazy, they told me that white men, anonymous white men, were going to come after me.
[01:31:35.801 --> 01:31:38.602]  And all of a sudden, all of these screen names started popping up.
[01:31:38.662 --> 01:31:39.483]  It was very obvious.
[01:31:39.503 --> 01:31:42.264]  You know, like, Alex at supportTrump dot com.
[01:31:42.304 --> 01:31:43.445]  And what they really didn't want
[01:31:44.105 --> 01:31:46.306]  Was you running a system scanning who the bullies were?
[01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:46.906]  Right, exactly.
[01:31:46.926 --> 01:31:47.646]  Because that would have got them.
[01:31:47.666 --> 01:31:48.687]  It would have gotten them in trouble.
[01:31:48.767 --> 01:31:50.227]  So I instantly was ripolled.
[01:31:50.247 --> 01:31:52.828]  I was intelligent enough, obviously, to understand what was happening.
[01:31:53.148 --> 01:31:57.550]  And it was just a crazy thing to go through, to think that everyone that you thought you were against, you were actually for.
[01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:59.511]  And it happened just in time.
[01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:02.012]  It was just as Trump was saying that the media was fake.
[01:32:02.032 --> 01:32:02.492]  And I was like,
[01:32:02.972 --> 01:32:03.613]  He's telling the truth.
[01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:09.399]  I caught them in a false flag, and you can't just deny what's sitting in front of you, and they tried to lie about me.
[01:32:09.459 --> 01:32:13.544]  They tried to smear me because I was saying, hey, these guys, these gamers are telling the truth.
[01:32:13.664 --> 01:32:14.846]  These girls are harassing themselves.
[01:32:14.866 --> 01:32:15.466]  It didn't happen.
[01:32:16.027 --> 01:32:20.472]  Um, so... But see, most people would just get into the victimology that I'm being given victim status.
[01:32:20.732 --> 01:32:20.912]  No.
[01:32:20.932 --> 01:32:23.014]  Okay, I'm your victim, and then you work for them.
[01:32:23.194 --> 01:32:24.135]  Right, no, let's be clear.
[01:32:24.175 --> 01:32:26.856]  There is nothing to be gained by being a victim.
[01:32:26.896 --> 01:32:30.519]  This race to the bottom has got to stop, and I don't think people have understood that yet.
[01:32:30.819 --> 01:32:32.100]  There's no Medal of Honor you get.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.201]  There's no job you get.
[01:32:33.221 --> 01:32:40.106]  It does not affect your bottom line to be a victim, unless you're being financed like these girls were, and you get to run 501c3 charities for Hillary Clinton.
[01:32:40.646 --> 01:32:42.307]  You know, and it has been unbelievable.
[01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:44.729]  I have never seen more love and more kindness.
[01:32:44.769 --> 01:32:47.711]  I gave a speech last night at Texas State University to their young conservatives.
[01:32:48.111 --> 01:32:51.553]  Then, when I meet other conservatives and I show up and I speak to them.
[01:32:52.894 --> 01:32:53.534]  You're awesome!
[01:32:53.574 --> 01:32:54.275]  We're gonna be back!
[01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:54.935]  We're winning!
[01:32:55.075 --> 01:32:55.796]  We're on the march!
[01:32:55.876 --> 01:32:57.177]  The empire's on the run!
[01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:27.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:30.562]  Anybody that tunes in on a regular basis knows I don't hype stuff.
[01:33:30.602 --> 01:33:41.751]  And I've been saying the last year, Trump's gonna start bringing down the pedophile network, and that just means greenlighting law enforcement, citizens, and others to have courage to do it, knowing he's gonna try to back him as much as he can.
[01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:44.553]  And he's tweeted that child rapists should be killed.
[01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:48.544]  And of course, you've got Eric Prince.
[01:33:48.604 --> 01:33:50.306]  Say what you want about the owner of Blackwater.
[01:33:50.326 --> 01:33:52.288]  Now, actually, he has a lot of intelligence sources.
[01:33:53.168 --> 01:33:55.370]  And I can tell you, it's an open secret in the government, so I'll let you know.
[01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.913]  He's been part of the leaks that have exposed the globalists, along with other patriots.
[01:33:58.953 --> 01:33:59.734]  It wasn't the Russians.
[01:34:00.214 --> 01:34:01.055]  That's now coming out.
[01:34:01.355 --> 01:34:05.179]  He's exposed the pedophile network from behind the scenes and has been fighting that.
[01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:05.819]  So have we.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.121]  And I've given $100,000 of the money you've given us to a team of
[01:34:11.744 --> 01:34:22.206]  Former law enforcement people and SEAL Team 6 folks and others to actually go out and document some of these big raids you're hearing about that national news won't cover.
[01:34:22.766 --> 01:34:25.207]  And of course, I don't have a position in the films they're making.
[01:34:25.487 --> 01:34:26.347]  I don't care about the money.
[01:34:26.767 --> 01:34:38.329]  The money you send us when you buy products, t-shirts, books, films, supplements, goes back in, we're talking 95% of it, to building and expanding this operation against the globalists.
[01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:40.330]  And the rest goes into backup
[01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:45.819]  When they sue us and come after us and everything to hold the course and be able to weather the storm.
[01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:55.783]  So we need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and commit to buy the high quality supplements like Caveman and AnthroPlex and Super Mel Vitality.
[01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:57.124]  50% off AnthroPlex.

[01:34:58.425 --> 01:35:00.566]  The stamina, the libido, the energy it gives me is amazing.
[01:35:01.387 --> 01:35:02.568]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:03.048 --> 01:35:07.251]  We're about to end in the next few days the special on the Nutraceutical Brain Force.
[01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:08.411]  It's 50% off.
[01:35:08.431 --> 01:35:09.392]  We've never done that before.
[01:35:09.592 --> 01:35:10.533]  It's our best seller.
[01:35:10.553 --> 01:35:15.696]  But I wanted to see if I lowered the price even more close to cost if it would cause just phenomenal ordering.
[01:35:15.736 --> 01:35:16.437]  And it has.
[01:35:16.957 --> 01:35:22.980]  We got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation at $19.96 when leading competitors with a similar formula are $60 to $70.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.361]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:35:27.182 --> 01:35:28.002]  It's unbelievable at $19.96.
[01:35:28.102 --> 01:35:30.003]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:30.803]  Let me stop right there.
[01:35:32.524 --> 01:35:37.967]  I know what it's like to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of time to make a film.
[01:35:39.076 --> 01:35:43.318]  And then to have it all uploaded properly, and to have YouTube say, you can't put it up.
[01:35:43.458 --> 01:35:48.780]  Or to have Apple say, re-encode this, and then refuse it.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.842]  Then send it to a firm and they say, no, this is all to their specs, they're just refusing it.
[01:35:53.523 --> 01:36:00.566]  After they took tens of thousands of my dollars just to pay to have them do the quote, conversion and upload to iTunes.
[01:36:01.266 --> 01:36:02.947]  And they do this to Libertarians, Conservatives.
[01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:03.908]  It's come out in the news.
[01:36:04.228 --> 01:36:08.812]  You've seen the undercover video of YouTube executives saying their main job is to block Infowars.
[01:36:09.072 --> 01:36:10.713]  They mean the type of guest we have on.
[01:36:11.354 --> 01:36:15.116]  The fact that we are a frontline operation that continues to kick their butt.
[01:36:17.098 --> 01:36:18.099]  A place they don't control.
[01:36:19.423 --> 01:36:20.965]  It's very frustrating to see that happen.
[01:36:21.146 --> 01:36:33.483]  But imagine being Gabe Hoffman, a successful Wall Street strategist and capital manager, putting a million plus dollars of his own money into an open secret being produced over the last five years.
[01:36:33.844 --> 01:36:35.065]  Two years ago, it's ready.
[01:36:36.325 --> 01:36:37.426]  Hollywood won't take it.
[01:36:37.466 --> 01:36:38.827]  They block it everywhere.
[01:36:39.407 --> 01:36:40.929]  Well now he's just put it out for free.
[01:36:40.969 --> 01:36:43.270]  He's been waiting for that to happen.
[01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.831]  It's free.
[01:36:43.951 --> 01:36:47.113]  We've posted it to Infowars.com.
[01:36:47.634 --> 01:36:48.154]  It's free.
[01:36:48.614 --> 01:36:49.675]  Through the 31st.
[01:36:50.256 --> 01:36:54.459]  Now he had to put it on Vimeo because they don't censor like YouTube and Google do as much.
[01:36:55.159 --> 01:36:57.922]  Oh yeah, Google and YouTube are really censoring.
[01:36:58.871 --> 01:37:01.291]  That's why you've got to share it with everybody you know.
[01:37:01.331 --> 01:37:02.112]  You've got to stop them.
[01:37:02.172 --> 01:37:04.512]  Okay, a million views in a couple days is great.
[01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:05.772]  The last week or so.
[01:37:06.192 --> 01:37:08.813]  I want to see 10 million by next Monday, folks.
[01:37:08.913 --> 01:37:12.673]  We do videos all the time that get 20, 30, 40, 50 million views.
[01:37:13.073 --> 01:37:18.894]  This is a film with blood, sweat, and tears for the children, the victims, and to help and stop other victims.
[01:37:19.414 --> 01:37:21.235]  We've got to expose this, and we are.
[01:37:21.315 --> 01:37:22.015]  We're on the march.
[01:37:22.035 --> 01:37:23.075]  The empire's on the run.
[01:37:23.455 --> 01:37:25.596]  It's posted to InfoWars.com.
[01:37:26.016 --> 01:37:27.896]  I just tweeted it at RealAlexJones.
[01:37:29.059 --> 01:37:30.460]  Please retweet it right now.
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:31.320]  Let's scroll back to the top.
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.801]  I'm going to give folks the name of the article.
[01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:39.724]  Then I need you to send to local radio stations, local TV stations, and say interview Dave Hoffman and the rest of his crew.
[01:37:39.884 --> 01:37:41.445]  He flew on his own dime.
[01:37:41.925 --> 01:37:45.427]  When we wanted to get him on last week, he said, no, I'll just fly there next Friday.
[01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:45.907]  He did it.
[01:37:46.507 --> 01:37:48.588]  Didn't want us to pay for anything.
[01:37:48.628 --> 01:37:49.709]  He's a rich, successful guy.
[01:37:49.969 --> 01:37:51.269]  He's doing this because he actually cares.
[01:37:51.509 --> 01:37:54.751]  Because his friends that knew about this that were in Hollywood said it was horrible.
[01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:57.332]  So again, an open secret on Twitter.
[01:37:57.392 --> 01:37:58.333]  Be sure and follow him there.
[01:37:58.673 --> 01:37:59.053]  Spread it.
[01:37:59.413 --> 01:38:03.815]  The headline on InfoWars.com is, Hollywood is trying to suppress this film.
[01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:04.676]  Get it out.
[01:38:05.016 --> 01:38:08.498]  See the groundbreaking film that exposes Hollywood pedophilia.
[01:38:09.358 --> 01:38:11.779]  The secret Hollywood doesn't want you to know.
[01:38:12.139 --> 01:38:16.061]  Posted here absolutely free for the victims and to stop future crimes.
[01:38:16.642 --> 01:38:18.643]  It's a million and a half dollar gift to you.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.464]  Now, again, if this was put in theaters, it could have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:38:23.484 --> 01:38:31.751]  The directors already got nominated for an Oscar with their film, what was it, a decade ago, first exposing the Vatican and all the sex crimes here in the U.S.
[01:38:32.051 --> 01:38:32.732]  All proven right.
[01:38:33.012 --> 01:38:34.033]  It isn't about the money.
[01:38:34.053 --> 01:38:37.616]  The satisfaction is knowing these scumbags are being brought to justice.
[01:38:37.956 --> 01:38:39.618]  So you've got the floor in this segment and the next.
[01:38:40.198 --> 01:38:57.064]  I just wanted to break that down, but I wanted to ask the listeners to come together as humans, of every race, color, and creed, who are one race, the human race, and say no to the exploitation and attacks on children, women, men, you name it, by these barbarous elite cults around the world, Hollywood just being one of them.
[01:38:57.304 --> 01:39:04.847]  But it's the sacrament of these aggressive power cults that they are all about hurting the innocent, whether it be women, children, you name it.
[01:39:05.067 --> 01:39:08.488]  So Gabe Hoffman, the producer that put his money where his mouth was,
[01:39:09.028 --> 01:39:11.951]  Right now, putting this film up for free, that is such a beautiful thing you've done.
[01:39:12.612 --> 01:39:13.192]  Well, thanks much.
[01:39:13.232 --> 01:39:16.135]  I mean, again, it's for the real heroes and all that.
[01:39:17.437 --> 01:39:29.148]  So, imagine, Alex, you make a film, you hire an Oscar-nominated director and all that, and then you take it to the mainstream, the mainstream, liberal-leaning media for the reviews.
[01:39:30.086 --> 01:39:32.527]  New York Times, Variety, all that.
[01:39:32.987 --> 01:39:39.511]  And your film gets a 93% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
[01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:39.511]  93%.
[01:39:40.811 --> 01:39:42.572]  That's almost unprecedented.
[01:39:43.432 --> 01:39:42.572]  93%.
[01:39:43.472 --> 01:39:50.076]  They say Rotten Tomatoes is ruining Hollywood because they give such low ones, but the human population gives you an unprecedented 93.
[01:39:50.536 --> 01:39:50.736]  Right.
[01:39:50.756 --> 01:39:58.299]  So we get a 93 and we're thinking, okay, well we'll go to film festivals because, hey, that's the next step in the process to try to sell something, right?
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.201]  Okay, film festivals are easy to get into.
[01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:15.729]  You pay a small registration fee, and even, you know, look, if you had three kids that got twenty grand together, they'll put them in a documentary corner somewhere, maybe not on the main screen, but they're pretty easy, especially when you've got something as legitimate as this.
[01:40:15.749 --> 01:40:16.449]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:24.594]  The first three film festivals, Alex, that we tried to go to, L.A., Toronto, and London, you know what happened?
[01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:31.975]  The lower-level people who reviewed the film for quality thought, okay, great, we're gonna put it up there, in fact, in a place of prominence.
[01:40:32.476 --> 01:40:36.079]  Then, each time, a couple weeks later, guess what happened?
[01:40:36.399 --> 01:40:44.586]  The higher-ups learned about it through their Hollywood, you know, connected pedophiles, and they disinvited us from those festivals.
[01:40:44.626 --> 01:40:46.387]  And that shows you who's in charge!
[01:40:46.587 --> 01:40:47.108]  Absolutely.
[01:40:47.788 --> 01:40:49.009]  So of course that didn't stop us.
[01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:50.411]  We went to festivals anyway.
[01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:51.392]  We went to Cannes.
[01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:52.513]  We went to Dock NYC.
[01:40:52.753 --> 01:41:09.371]  And when we went to Dock NYC, it sold out a 500-person theater on two days notice and Drudge put it up on the top, the top of the page that the sex abuse, you know... Isn't he, isn't he just a hero for taking stuff that they're suppressing and punching it out there?
[01:41:09.932 --> 01:41:15.796]  Well, you know, Dan Gable, famous wrestling coach, he said, once you've wrestled in life, everything else is easy.
[01:41:16.077 --> 01:41:16.757]  And this sure is.
[01:41:17.117 --> 01:41:21.080]  You know, fighting financial fraud and biotech fraud and scientific fraud for years and years.
[01:41:21.921 --> 01:41:23.302]  I'm used to a fight.
[01:41:23.342 --> 01:41:24.723]  Hasn't it made you stronger?
[01:41:25.103 --> 01:41:25.384]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:25.424 --> 01:41:28.066]  People think avoiding fights makes them, you know, stronger.
[01:41:28.086 --> 01:41:29.607]  No, getting in one is the right fight.
[01:41:29.807 --> 01:41:36.011]  Well, when you get inspired by the brave survivors that you see in an Open Secret, you see what they and their family have gone through.
[01:41:36.432 --> 01:41:38.693]  And when they put their lives
[01:41:39.674 --> 01:41:43.035]  On camera, you know, just bare their souls, literally.
[01:41:43.095 --> 01:41:46.136]  And you see that in the film, you'd be inspired to fight for them, too.
[01:41:48.016 --> 01:41:50.157]  You know, I tell you, it is crazy.
[01:41:50.257 --> 01:41:54.318]  And years ago, I would start covering this, the lawsuit threats, you name it, death threats.
[01:41:54.938 --> 01:41:57.298]  I mean, I know how real it is, just experiencing the threats.
[01:41:57.478 --> 01:42:03.200]  And I can't imagine what you guys went through trying to make this film, much less the victims themselves.
[01:42:04.255 --> 01:42:04.775]  Absolutely.
[01:42:05.156 --> 01:42:10.198]  And, you know, Dan, the Digital Entertainment Network, we can get into that, but that was amazing.
[01:42:10.238 --> 01:42:29.369]  That was basically a front for pedophiles to lure in and rape and drug young boys, fly them in from all over the country, have them live at the mansion that they bought with $150 million of investor dollars, much of it from Hollywood elite, and that was really big.
[01:42:30.429 --> 01:42:33.311]  Well, you know, I remember now, Drudge, pushing the film out.
[01:42:33.351 --> 01:42:35.872]  I heard about it from law enforcement and others that you guys were doing something really important.
[01:42:35.892 --> 01:42:38.253]  I kept waiting for it to come out and get you on and, you know, promote it.
[01:42:38.573 --> 01:42:41.594]  But I forgot how Drudge was one of the guys to finally break through.
[01:42:42.174 --> 01:42:43.015]  Drudge did that for us.
[01:42:43.095 --> 01:42:47.177]  I mean, he's just, he just, the whole Liberty Movement has to absolutely thank Matt Drudge.
[01:42:47.577 --> 01:42:48.357]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:42:48.377 --> 01:42:50.198]  NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:42:50.238 --> 01:42:52.979]  The film's posted in full for free right now on InfoWars.
[01:42:53.179 --> 01:42:53.740]  Please watch it.
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:54.300]  Please spread it.
[01:43:02.805 --> 01:43:11.470]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:11.990]  That's right.
[01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:17.072]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[01:43:17.333 --> 01:43:23.756]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:43:23.996 --> 01:43:31.302]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:43:31.582 --> 01:43:31.782]  Woo!
[01:43:31.842 --> 01:43:32.763]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:32.883 --> 01:43:41.490]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:49.717]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:43:51.198 --> 01:43:54.524]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:43:54.644 --> 01:43:58.610]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:43:58.751 --> 01:43:59.672]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:44:06.886 --> 01:44:07.767]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[01:44:08.147 --> 01:44:10.488]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[01:44:10.749 --> 01:44:13.550]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:19.594]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support, and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:19.894 --> 01:44:26.399]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide, and clearly, the biggest sales in our history.
[01:44:26.559 --> 01:44:28.680]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.423]  We've got our new tropic, RainForce, 50% off.
[01:44:32.643 --> 01:44:34.584]  We've got so many other products there that are
[01:44:34.824 --> 01:44:35.284]  We're good to go.
[01:45:12.113 --> 01:45:12.602]  Just briefly.
[01:45:13.855 --> 01:45:15.856]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:45:15.896 --> 01:45:16.757]  He's about to retire.
[01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:23.720]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.882]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:45:26.902 --> 01:45:27.882]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:45:28.403 --> 01:45:29.483]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:45:30.044 --> 01:45:32.525]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[01:45:32.545 --> 01:45:33.325]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:45:33.746 --> 01:45:35.727]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:45:35.947 --> 01:45:41.650]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:42.711]  Exactly.
[01:45:42.771 --> 01:45:48.757]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:45:48.818 --> 01:45:52.602]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[01:45:53.963 --> 01:45:57.507]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:45:58.496 --> 01:45:58.896]  I don't
[01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:18.825]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:46:19.285 --> 01:46:21.727]  Why does it say nursery water that at the store was added fluoride?
[01:46:21.807 --> 01:46:24.709]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:46:24.749 --> 01:46:26.710]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:38.479]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks at McThomps of Maine, it's private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[01:46:38.499 --> 01:46:40.040]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.841]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:46:41.881 --> 01:46:42.802]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:46:42.822 --> 01:46:44.223]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:46:44.663 --> 01:46:52.945]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it's just concentrated toothpaste.
[01:46:53.545 --> 01:46:56.306]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:47:18.311 --> 01:47:31.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.721]  Gabe Hoffman, we got two more segments left.
[01:47:33.761 --> 01:47:37.244]  I hope you can stay and go in the war room later with Owen Schroer and do two hours if you want.
[01:47:37.324 --> 01:47:38.344]  Oh, I'll do whatever you'd like.
[01:47:38.745 --> 01:47:41.406]  Gabe Hoffman, the main producer for An Open Secret.
[01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:43.542]  There's so many other angles.
[01:47:43.582 --> 01:47:45.063]  We haven't even scratched the surface.
[01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:47.625]  The film is free at Infowars.com.
[01:47:48.185 --> 01:47:53.129]  You put it on Vimeo, I guess, because I know YouTube and Facebook and others have been censoring anything that exposes the pedophile network.
[01:47:53.169 --> 01:48:11.744]  But it's got to be satisfying, even though they've suppressed your film for two years, that now you're releasing it right as it's all starting to come out and as we see pedophiles, not just people with child porn, but actual pedophiles with kids in cages being busted all over the country, but again, never in the national news.
[01:48:12.805 --> 01:48:13.306]  Nope, nope.
[01:48:13.786 --> 01:48:23.099]  And it's amazing, you know, with Den, the digital entertainment network that we expose, our film actually bought out of bankruptcy somebody who had all the Den footage.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:27.906]  So you get to see how, look, we're not saying that Bryan Singer is a pedophile.
[01:48:28.106 --> 01:48:29.927]  We're not saying that David Geffen is a pedophile.
[01:48:30.267 --> 01:48:31.508]  We don't do any accusations.
[01:48:31.568 --> 01:48:32.368]  We stick to facts.
[01:48:32.628 --> 01:48:39.872]  What we do show you is that convicted pedophiles have close relationships with very powerful people like that.
[01:48:40.152 --> 01:48:44.175]  For example, Michael Huffington invested millions of dollars in Den.
[01:48:44.535 --> 01:48:46.636]  David Geffen, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:48:47.076 --> 01:48:48.817]  Bryan Singer invested in Den.
[01:48:49.157 --> 01:48:53.279]  Bryan Singer came and hung out at Den and did their little clips.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.161]  Have you, you've seen the movie Grease, right?
[01:48:56.562 --> 01:48:56.782]  Yes.
[01:48:57.102 --> 01:48:59.464]  Okay, so it was directed by somebody named Randall Kleiser.
[01:48:59.904 --> 01:49:02.426]  I had no idea who Randall Kleiser was, none whatsoever.
[01:49:03.467 --> 01:49:17.277]  One day, we get an email from this big, big Hollywood lawyer, big as they come, Michael Donaldson, owns his own firm, says that this Randall Kleiser is in our trailer for one second, and he objects to it.
[01:49:18.328 --> 01:49:24.710]  I'm like, wow, turns out Randall Kleiser directed a bunch of the Den shows when Den was around.
[01:49:24.951 --> 01:49:27.371]  So Randall Kleiser was hanging out with a bunch of pedophiles.
[01:49:27.712 --> 01:49:31.853]  I'm not saying that he was one, but he had a bunch of pedophile friends that ended up getting convicted.
[01:49:32.253 --> 01:49:36.035]  And so we said, great, we'll just tag him in the film so everybody knows who he is.
[01:49:36.315 --> 01:49:41.977]  So the more that they come after us, the harder we hit back because the truth is on our side.
[01:49:42.477 --> 01:49:46.359]  Well, they got to be in panic mode now because the FBI we exclusively broke.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:59.870]  The FBI is investigating Weinstein, not just for fleeing the country under Trump's direction, but also for Jerry Epstein and the Lolita child kidnapping express.
[01:50:04.614 --> 01:50:09.037]  Their stalkers, their buddies, their cronies have admitted to being their friends in public.
[01:50:09.457 --> 01:50:15.361]  They've actually sent them after us to stalk and harass us and everything like that for the last two or three years.
[01:50:15.561 --> 01:50:22.785]  Believe me, I mean, I've been against the pedophiles forever, but as I've been beating the drum harder the last four years of my life, I mean, it only made me stronger.
[01:50:22.825 --> 01:50:24.806]  Everything bad turned into something good.
[01:50:25.247 --> 01:50:26.707]  I've learned just God is such a blessing.
[01:50:26.727 --> 01:50:30.710]  It's like an experience of Job, not as bad, but you know, approaching it in some aspects.
[01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:33.311]  But it's just how God always has come through.
[01:50:33.351 --> 01:50:33.972]  It's very humbling.
[01:50:34.332 --> 01:50:36.953]  But for some of these kids, you know, they dig up in shallow graves.
[01:50:37.753 --> 01:50:40.594]  Really, it's their cries to God that are coming through through you, my friend.
[01:50:41.394 --> 01:50:42.054]  Well, thank you.
[01:50:42.294 --> 01:50:43.474]  I mean, there's one in particular.
[01:50:43.854 --> 01:50:45.195]  His name is Greg Schneider.
[01:50:45.235 --> 01:50:46.395]  That's spelled with two G's.
[01:50:46.795 --> 01:50:54.457]  And we have the Hollywood Reporter piece, where he talks about publicly being friends with a few people that somebody accused.
[01:50:54.677 --> 01:50:58.358]  The film doesn't accuse them, but somebody in the film accused them separately.
[01:50:58.698 --> 01:51:03.099]  And he says he's friends with Bryan Singer, Garth Ansier, David Newman, and Greg Goddard.
[01:51:03.379 --> 01:51:13.223]  We've also got for you, exclusively here, behind the scenes, Greg Schneider went to X-Men, and he's there behind the scenes.
[01:51:13.583 --> 01:51:18.686]  We have Thanksgiving, after the case was dropped, after the Egan case was dropped against Bryan Singer,
[01:51:19.727 --> 01:51:27.591]  He's over there, this is from Bryan Singer's Instagram, Thanksgiving 2015, at Bryan Singer's house for Thanksgiving.
[01:51:27.851 --> 01:51:39.977]  So, Bryan Singer's creepy friend has been stalking not only us, but people who didn't have anything to do with their quarrel with Mike Egan, which is separate from our film.
[01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:48.822]  They came and they stalked us personally, on our personal Facebooks, on our personal emails, this guy, all over the internet.
[01:51:49.062 --> 01:51:54.825]  Heck, he's on Twitter right now under my feed tweeting and, you know, you can go talk to him.
[01:51:55.506 --> 01:51:56.666]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:51:57.187 --> 01:51:57.807]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:51:57.827 --> 01:51:59.008]  We're not scared of any of these people.
[01:51:59.448 --> 01:52:00.589]  Whatever's going to happen is going to happen.
[01:52:00.609 --> 01:52:03.671]  We're going up against the globalists, George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, all of them.
[01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:08.854]  And we've studied these people and their spirit, cooking, all the things the globalists do, and they're all into evil.
[01:52:09.494 --> 01:52:12.336]  They're all into their own sick, twisted forms of power.
[01:52:12.796 --> 01:52:20.200]  And the good news is, all the intimidation that Weinstein and others tried, Bill Clinton tried, a lot of folks got killed by the Clintons exposing his sex crimes.
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.781]  It didn't work anymore, and all the chickens are coming home to roost.
[01:52:22.801 --> 01:52:23.562]  What's that like for you?
[01:52:24.662 --> 01:52:27.544]  It's just an amazing feeling, and I know we're only at the beginning of this.
[01:52:27.644 --> 01:52:35.388]  I know you're going to see big Hollywood pedophile rings broken in Hollywood, because now the survivors, the victims, are realizing that, you know what?
[01:52:35.988 --> 01:52:38.090]  They can't stop us, and we don't have to be afraid of them.
[01:52:38.370 --> 01:52:43.233]  And we can show them the example of... And even Mainstream News is now reporting on your film.
[01:52:43.453 --> 01:52:47.436]  They're being forced to, because you put it out for free, saying, wow, you know, is that the next big shoot-a-drop?
[01:52:47.476 --> 01:52:48.597]  It's already dropping.
[01:52:48.617 --> 01:52:52.900]  In fact, we're going to come back in a few minutes and do your big statement here, then Leon McAdoo joins us.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:57.443]  But during Weinstein's year, Disney hired child molester to direct film.
[01:52:57.743 --> 01:52:58.724]  And that's Mainstream News.
[01:53:00.066 --> 01:53:00.946]  Guy that raped a 12-year-old.
[01:53:01.046 --> 01:53:01.686]  Sex sting.
[01:53:01.767 --> 01:53:02.527]  This is just yesterday.
[01:53:03.087 --> 01:53:08.869]  Leads to 277 arrests in Florida of people that had kidnapped children and were selling them for sex slavery.
[01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.709]  That's U.S.
[01:53:09.769 --> 01:53:10.089]  news.
[01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:11.029]  This is just yesterday.
[01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:12.130]  Here's another one.
[01:53:12.150 --> 01:53:15.431]  Trafficking sting recovers 17 kids in Colorado, Wyoming.
[01:53:17.951 --> 01:53:23.113]  Sex trafficking sting rescues Colorado infant and 5-year-old sister who were being sold out to be raped.
[01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:36.978]  Most of that pedophile, Matt, by the way, those convictions, if you look them up, and we're going to get the actual specifics of them out there later, but most of them are on children's shows, Nickelodeon and Disney.
[01:53:38.766 --> 01:53:41.248]  Well, we know there's the sexualization of children on Nickelodeon.
[01:53:41.288 --> 01:53:42.189]  They admit all that.
[01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:43.730]  And you just see it everywhere.
[01:53:43.751 --> 01:53:48.315]  What do you think about Salon and the New York Times coming out, like, saying pedophilia is not bad.
[01:53:48.435 --> 01:53:50.116]  You know, it's just a preference.
[01:53:50.196 --> 01:53:52.759]  Right, like it's a preference or a condition, like it's somehow normal.
[01:53:52.819 --> 01:53:54.861]  And that's the same thing that the NAMLA people want to do.
[01:53:55.141 --> 01:53:58.464]  They want to bring that somehow into the mainstream as an accepted thing.
[01:53:58.904 --> 01:54:01.647]  And we have to be here to stop it as the last line of defense.
[01:54:01.747 --> 01:54:01.987]  That's right.
[01:54:02.007 --> 01:54:02.808]  If you're a radio listener,
[01:54:03.228 --> 01:54:06.931]  We're putting everything my guest is saying, we're just putting up for mainstream news, even on the screen.
[01:54:07.291 --> 01:54:09.493]  Again, just a few years ago, you wouldn't even see this.
[01:54:09.513 --> 01:54:16.099]  474 arrested, 28 sexually-splitted children rescued during statewide human trafficking, KTLA, but no coverage since then of that.
[01:54:16.139 --> 01:54:17.079]  Some of them in cages.
[01:54:17.099 --> 01:54:18.060]  Including women.
[01:54:19.041 --> 01:54:22.364]  Tampa, 84 children recovered, 120 arrested, nationwide sex-trafficking probe.
[01:54:22.604 --> 01:54:23.284]  That's yesterday.
[01:54:24.546 --> 01:54:27.288]  Ten disturbing stories about Hollywood's pedophile problem.
[01:54:28.656 --> 01:54:30.958]  Big story right there that goes over all of those.
[01:54:30.998 --> 01:54:32.139]  We'll cover some more coming up.
[01:54:32.179 --> 01:54:35.843]  Hollywood's other open secret besides Harvey Weinstein preying on young boys.
[01:54:36.183 --> 01:54:39.706]  And some young girls, like Roman Polanski, like to rape.
[01:54:40.187 --> 01:54:42.669]  Do you have any numbers or estimation?
[01:54:42.970 --> 01:54:43.470]  What is it, about 80% boys?
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.380]  Something like that.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:57.544]  And what we do know is that, unfortunately, there are so many like Corey Haim and others that are dead, whether drug overdose or suicide or things like that, and their voices can't be heard.
[01:54:58.584 --> 01:54:59.785]  Evan Rachel's coming out.
[01:55:00.065 --> 01:55:01.986]  Hollywood pedophilia is the next dam to break.
[01:55:02.346 --> 01:55:02.526]  Yep.
[01:55:02.566 --> 01:55:03.246]  The Daily Beast.
[01:55:06.047 --> 01:55:08.508]  What's going to happen is everything we've talked about comes out.
[01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:10.600]  Well, you can't hide the truth.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.020]  You ultimately can't hide the truth.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.002]  And the American people know what the truth is, and they get on the side of the truth.
[01:55:16.683 --> 01:55:24.106]  But that's why Hollywood and the Vatican and all these groups have been racing to demoralize people, get rid of morals, and normalize this and make us immoral.
[01:55:24.427 --> 01:55:27.268]  They've been racing as a rearguard action to try to get us like them.
[01:55:28.028 --> 01:55:31.190]  But I'm sorry, you just can't grab kids out of the backs of yards and take them to rape them.
[01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:35.592]  You just can't, you know, take them to satanic ceremonies because you get off on, you know, torturing them.
[01:55:35.912 --> 01:55:36.373]  Because, listen.
[01:55:37.452 --> 01:55:39.953]  The next floor beneath this, that's my next big question.
[01:55:39.993 --> 01:55:44.055]  Did you run into the occultism, the satanism, the bondage, the abuse of children?
[01:55:45.376 --> 01:55:47.837]  That was something that we didn't actually run into, believe it or not.
[01:55:47.897 --> 01:55:49.178]  But we only scratched the surface.
[01:55:49.218 --> 01:55:56.021]  I mean, out of two binders, out of literally 50 abused children, you know, we weren't going to try to out victims.
[01:55:56.061 --> 01:55:57.381]  We only wanted to out pedophiles.
[01:55:57.441 --> 01:56:02.744]  And look, not everybody was as brave as the five brave souls that, you know, showed up on an open secret.
[01:56:04.892 --> 01:56:05.873]  But look at history.
[01:56:06.013 --> 01:56:07.675]  Every culture goes into a decadent cycle.
[01:56:08.035 --> 01:56:17.444]  Whether it was Mesoamerica, or Europe, or where China is today, or Africa, they would get elites that got into kids, they'd have human sacrifice, and they would say, you know, sacrifice the virgins, that means the young people.
[01:56:17.464 --> 01:56:25.732]  I mean, there's some sick psychopath system where they kind of get control throughout history, and they manifest the same system psychologically.
[01:56:25.752 --> 01:56:28.535]  We see it in sociology, anthropology, and archaeology.
[01:56:28.875 --> 01:56:29.496]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:56:29.516 --> 01:56:32.578]  And they try to push their values on America.
[01:56:33.079 --> 01:56:35.981]  And with you and the Infowars folks out there, they're rejecting it.
[01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:37.643]  I mean, Hollywood is afraid right now.
[01:56:37.683 --> 01:56:42.006]  You've seen all the headlines of how movie ticket sales are at something like a 20 or 25 year low.
[01:56:42.967 --> 01:56:45.609]  Let's see how low they go after this has come out.
[01:56:45.769 --> 01:56:46.150]  That's right.
[01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:46.650]  And then look at...
[01:56:47.631 --> 01:57:07.377]  John Wayne Gacy was a guy that liked to grab young men and torture them and kill them and then they go well don't don't bash him he was gay oh so he wanted to just kill people as part of his extra fun and they like you're anti-gay if you're against John Wayne Gacy it just gets weirder and weirder and really it's just like they're using the tolerance of an open society to now say pedophilia and killing people is okay.
[01:57:07.617 --> 01:57:11.720]  Well, abuse is abuse is abuse, and abuse isn't a straight or gay thing.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:26.071]  It's in everything, whether it's a guy abusing a girl, heck, a girl abusing a guy... And I totally agree, there are men abusing women like Weinstein and young women, but statistically, I mean, what we keep seeing is, is it like 70-80% of men against boys?
[01:57:26.451 --> 01:57:26.892]  Absolutely.
[01:57:28.032 --> 01:57:28.533]  Absolutely.
[01:57:29.193 --> 01:57:34.920]  I mean, even Tom Jones has come out and said he had guys, basically, when he first got in his career, producers and stuff, trying to make him, you know, do it.
[01:57:35.841 --> 01:57:37.022]  And for me, it's about power.
[01:57:37.042 --> 01:57:37.823]  It's beta males.
[01:57:37.843 --> 01:57:39.244]  I want to dominate other men.
[01:57:39.264 --> 01:57:40.245]  I think that's what it's really all about.
[01:57:40.526 --> 01:57:41.026]  We'll be back.
[01:57:41.046 --> 01:57:42.087]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:42.107 --> 01:57:43.189]  This is groundbreaking info.
[01:57:53.752 --> 01:57:54.132]  Carnivore.
[01:57:54.152 --> 01:57:55.773]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[01:57:56.253 --> 01:57:57.133]  All very affordable.
[01:57:58.053 --> 01:57:58.974]  33% off, out of the gates.
[01:57:59.094 --> 01:58:03.895]  The thing I am so ultra excited about, because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[01:58:03.915 --> 01:58:09.877]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[01:58:10.097 --> 01:58:14.738]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[01:58:14.759 --> 01:58:17.599]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and stomachaches.
[01:58:17.619 --> 01:58:20.120]  And as you get older, you can't eat rich foods you could eat before.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.441]  It's because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[01:58:22.921 --> 01:58:24.403]  Next Level Beyond Probiotic.
[01:58:37.938 --> 01:58:42.183]  That 20 ounce rib eye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[01:58:42.263 --> 01:58:45.287]  It's called Carnivore Digestive Enzymes.
[01:58:45.467 --> 01:58:49.832]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.

[01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:58.200]  It's just amazing.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.141]  Made in the USA.

[01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:21.709]  Man, I used to eat a big steak and didn't feel tired.
[01:59:21.749 --> 01:59:22.550]  I eat one now, I get tired.
[01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:23.210]  I started taking this.
[01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:23.990]  Boom.
[01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.731]  Ate a big rib eye.
[01:59:24.771 --> 01:59:25.011]  Boom.
[01:59:25.071 --> 01:59:25.591]  Eat two of these.
[01:59:25.651 --> 01:59:26.111]  Eat one of these.
[01:59:26.691 --> 01:59:27.372]  It's incredible.
[01:59:27.392 --> 01:59:28.292]  Digest it better.
[01:59:28.492 --> 01:59:29.433]  Aren't tired the next day.
[01:59:29.493 --> 01:59:30.193]  Don't get heartburn.
[01:59:30.253 --> 01:59:30.733]  Open the stomach.
[01:59:31.033 --> 01:59:34.675]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive enzyme.
[01:59:34.715 --> 01:59:36.816]  So Carnivore is next level.

[02:00:03.916 --> 02:00:04.677]  Well, here we are.
[02:00:05.158 --> 02:00:07.000]  The day before Thanksgiving.

[02:00:11.724 --> 02:00:16.306]  And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.346 --> 02:00:18.528]  I'm your humble host, Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.548 --> 02:00:31.475]  But this operation that we're involved in is nothing short of the attempt to not just save Western civilization and the Renaissance, but to save the defense of basic human enlightenment, period.
[02:00:33.703 --> 02:00:37.865]  You know, last weekend, we posted videos on Infowars.com.
[02:00:38.246 --> 02:01:00.258]  Some of them were live feeds of Owen Schroeder, Millie Weaver, Harrison Smith, and others, our crew members out on the streets of Austin, Texas, covering a Hillary Clinton book signing, but also covering a so-called Antifa-Anti-Trump demonstration.
[02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:04.192]  And this stuff just writes itself.
[02:01:04.673 --> 02:01:07.035]  No wonder some people think these videos we put out are fake.
[02:01:08.496 --> 02:01:23.149]  Because you've got a guy in a chicken suit who can barely talk, gibbering and cussing and threatening people, breaking our microphone and then running with police chasing a guy in a chicken suit like something out of a comedy, but it was serious.
[02:01:23.929 --> 02:01:29.174]  I gotta say 400, 500 yards with our reporters chasing after the police.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:33.521]  There's bike police on bikes chasing a guy on foot.
[02:01:34.602 --> 02:01:36.642]  So who can make that up?
[02:01:36.703 --> 02:01:42.665]  And the fact that the anti-Trump people are literally drooling zombies.
[02:01:43.206 --> 02:01:47.448]  I mean, most of them, they admit, are paid by Soros and the Democratic Party.
[02:01:47.968 --> 02:01:49.569]  These are the dregs of the earth.
[02:01:50.029 --> 02:01:52.250]  It's not like just one or two out of the crowd were like that.
[02:01:54.171 --> 02:01:56.272]  Every one of these people is like a
[02:01:59.585 --> 02:02:01.646]  Unspeakably stupid, mindless idiot.
[02:02:02.367 --> 02:02:04.788]  And then there were a few well-spoken, nice people there.
[02:02:04.808 --> 02:02:08.810]  I guess we just didn't like Trump.
[02:02:10.411 --> 02:02:13.533]  And then they were black folks that were also listeners.
[02:02:13.913 --> 02:02:14.894]  So we had those interviews too.
[02:02:16.174 --> 02:02:18.616]  And so I could see not liking Trump and not liking Clinton or something.
[02:02:18.656 --> 02:02:20.337]  I'm being a Bernie Sanders guy, so you're out.
[02:02:20.497 --> 02:02:20.817]  Whatever.
[02:02:22.466 --> 02:02:25.488]  And then we've got Millie Weaver who was also out there but separately at the book signing.
[02:02:26.729 --> 02:02:34.295]  I mean just every other woman going F you and trying to grab her microphone away as she walks down the sidewalk just trying to talk to people.
[02:02:34.315 --> 02:02:38.538]  They're so programmed that we're so evil in InfoWars that that happened.
[02:02:39.199 --> 02:02:42.001]  These people are really screwed up and it's getting worse.
[02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:54.449]  And you know, I've been around the country and around the world, and you go to some little poor fishing villages in Honduras, the people look alive, they look upright, they look savvy, they look smart.
[02:02:56.894 --> 02:03:01.117]  But you go to poor areas of Austin or other areas now, people look like they've been hit with mutation rays.
[02:03:01.637 --> 02:03:02.718]  They look like they're dying.
[02:03:02.758 --> 02:03:04.939]  They walk like they're zombies.
[02:03:04.979 --> 02:03:05.840]  They look like they're zombies.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.942]  White people, black people, Asian, Hispanic, they look dead.
[02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:10.343]  It's not as if they're poor.
[02:03:10.643 --> 02:03:11.383]  They're aimless.
[02:03:12.004 --> 02:03:12.924]  They're TV heads.
[02:03:13.565 --> 02:03:14.625]  Most of them are unemployed.
[02:03:15.426 --> 02:03:20.269]  And it just shows you what domestication does to people.
[02:03:20.469 --> 02:03:24.192]  And that's why what we're doing is such an important fight, ladies and gentlemen, because
[02:03:25.552 --> 02:03:31.654]  The Democratic Party and its constituents are slaves of the system.
[02:03:31.674 --> 02:03:33.915]  And the Republican leadership is just as bad or worse.
[02:03:34.615 --> 02:03:37.296]  But we're having an insurrection within the Republican Party.
[02:03:37.316 --> 02:03:39.957]  So this is such a historical thing we're talking about.
[02:03:40.958 --> 02:03:46.620]  You know, with Thanksgiving tomorrow, I'd like to again thank all my listeners for their love and support.
[02:03:48.513 --> 02:03:54.315]  As men age, they may often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:03:54.335 --> 02:04:03.138]  Supermill Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance and produce superior vitality in males.
[02:04:03.678 --> 02:04:07.259]  And we rarely have it this special, but I did it recently.
[02:04:07.299 --> 02:04:07.759]  People love it.
[02:04:07.779 --> 02:04:08.520]  I'm doing it again.
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:11.040]  Supermill Vitality right now is 50% off.
[02:04:13.183 --> 02:04:14.003]  With free shipping.
[02:04:14.344 --> 02:04:17.745]  And when I did this with 50% off a few months ago, it was not free shipping.
[02:04:17.785 --> 02:04:20.506]  So this is as good a deal as we ever do, if not the best.
[02:04:21.507 --> 02:04:26.429]  We're also introducing a sales on Infowars Life Living Defense.
[02:04:27.129 --> 02:04:28.050]  All supplies last.
[02:04:28.090 --> 02:04:29.150]  That's been sold out for a while.
[02:04:29.451 --> 02:04:30.231]  You can get it for only $22.
[02:04:30.271 --> 02:04:32.432]  That's 50% off.
[02:04:32.792 --> 02:04:33.853]  It is super high quality.
[02:04:33.873 --> 02:04:34.713]  People absolutely love it.
[02:04:35.093 --> 02:04:36.314]  Flushes out the parrot sites.
[02:04:37.014 --> 02:04:38.455]  That is so many other amazing things.
[02:04:39.076 --> 02:04:43.740]  And the specials for the last two days are extended as well, but some of those are about to have to end.
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.441]  Brain Force, 50% off.
[02:04:46.002 --> 02:04:47.443]  25% off Pro Pure Items.
[02:04:47.483 --> 02:04:48.684]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[02:04:49.144 --> 02:04:49.785]  Knockout, 50% off.
[02:04:49.805 --> 02:04:53.148]  But we're going to have to, again, stop that very, very soon.
[02:04:53.188 --> 02:04:57.611]  But the new special right now, again, Super Bowl Vitality and Living Defense.
[02:04:58.052 --> 02:04:59.933]  We'll be back on the other side of this transmission.
[02:04:59.953 --> 02:05:01.334]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:05:01.374 --> 02:05:03.276]  Without you, there is no InfoWars.
[02:05:03.376 --> 02:05:03.836]  Not a group.
[02:05:03.917 --> 02:05:05.298]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:05.318 --> 02:05:06.419]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:06.679 --> 02:05:07.600]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:13.125]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:26.778]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:26.838 --> 02:05:28.219]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.541]  Spreading disease around.
[02:05:30.621 --> 02:05:33.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:33.204 --> 02:05:34.485]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:34.525 --> 02:05:35.606]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[02:05:35.626 --> 02:05:36.686]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:36.987 --> 02:05:41.310]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:44.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:44.753 --> 02:05:47.854]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:47.874 --> 02:05:48.875]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:05:48.935 --> 02:05:50.816]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:50.876 --> 02:05:51.896]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:05:51.916 --> 02:05:53.977]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:05:54.617 --> 02:05:57.639]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:57.899 --> 02:05:59.780]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:02.161]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:06:13.146 --> 02:06:13.786]  Big Brother.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:16.501]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:18.002 --> 02:06:19.122]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:20.603 --> 02:06:21.564]  You want answers?
[02:06:22.485 --> 02:06:23.505]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:24.426 --> 02:06:30.830]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.888 --> 02:06:42.193]  All right, for the next 45 minutes or so, Scott Adams, the creator of one of the top comic strips in history, Dilbert, is joining us.
[02:06:42.213 --> 02:06:47.456]  But he's also somebody that studies persuasions, somebody that studies politics, history.
[02:06:47.817 --> 02:06:48.497]  Really smart guy.
[02:06:48.517 --> 02:06:50.458]  We're really excited to have him joining us here in just a moment.
[02:06:50.738 --> 02:06:56.362]  In the last 15 minutes or so, I'll take more calls from people that are patiently holding, like Sue, Faith, Tal, Brian, and others.
[02:06:56.422 --> 02:06:58.063]  If not, you can hang up and call back if you'd like.
[02:06:58.563 --> 02:07:03.507]  And then we're going to have Matt Dubiel co-hosting with me in the fourth hour from our Chicago affiliate.
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:05.840]  Covering a whole bunch of big developments.
[02:07:06.201 --> 02:07:12.823]  But first, it was such a fascinating interview that I wanted to play some more excerpts of it.
[02:07:14.023 --> 02:07:21.946]  Because Donna Brazile has come out and said that she talked about removing Hillary from the nomination.
[02:07:22.966 --> 02:07:26.047]  That Hillary stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders.
[02:07:27.509 --> 02:07:31.933]  And that you can go to hell, she says, I will not shut up.
[02:07:31.953 --> 02:07:33.995]  This is on ABC's This Week.
[02:07:34.035 --> 02:07:35.676]  Now this is bigger than just Donna Brazile.
[02:07:35.937 --> 02:07:37.198]  I don't just believe Donna Brazile.
[02:07:37.758 --> 02:07:40.981]  I know everything she basically talked about, we covered at the time.
[02:07:41.401 --> 02:07:42.582]  So it's true what she's saying.
[02:07:43.343 --> 02:07:52.832]  Including, she feared for her life with the whole Seth Rich thing, which they were trying to cover up, they were so desperate, and that Hillary ordered them to not let the FBI into the servers that were being hacked into.
[02:07:53.473 --> 02:07:55.915]  This completely blows up in the face of Robert Mueller.
[02:07:56.095 --> 02:08:00.359]  So here's a short compilation of some of the highlights, and then we're going to go to our guest.
[02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:07.926]  Here is Donna Brazile, one of the chief rats, former head of the DNC, leaving the sinking ship.
[02:08:07.966 --> 02:08:08.386]  Here it is.
[02:08:09.267 --> 02:08:13.150]  It sounds like you had a pretty dysfunctional relationship with the high command in Hillary's campaign.
[02:08:13.170 --> 02:08:16.812]  You even talk about telling them at some point, I'm not Patsy the slave.
[02:08:17.032 --> 02:08:26.779]  Yeah, I'm not Patsy the slave because I got sick and tired of people telling me how to spend money when all I was trying to do, I wasn't getting a salary, I was basically volunteering my time.
[02:08:27.019 --> 02:08:32.223]  And what I was trying to do, George, was to increase the level of enthusiasm and passion for Hillary Clinton.
[02:08:32.463 --> 02:08:34.405]  And the rest of the ticket all across the country.
[02:08:34.425 --> 02:08:35.606]  But here's what they don't know.
[02:08:35.967 --> 02:08:39.150]  They don't know what it was like to be over at the DNC during this hacking.
[02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:41.352]  They don't know what it's like to bury a child.
[02:08:41.412 --> 02:08:42.333]  I did, Seth Rich.
[02:08:42.413 --> 02:08:46.437]  They don't know what it's like to protect the staff from further harassment.
[02:08:46.697 --> 02:08:50.201]  They don't know what it's like because the high command of Brooklyn
[02:08:50.541 --> 02:08:55.102]  The people who were making the decisions, even for the DNC, they didn't come and work with us.
[02:08:55.402 --> 02:08:59.203]  They told us to shut up and basically let them win the election.
[02:08:59.223 --> 02:09:04.783]  And when we tried to intervene, we had to spend money we raised to try to help them win.
[02:09:04.884 --> 02:09:06.904]  And that was my job as chair of the party.
[02:09:07.124 --> 02:09:10.945]  George, for those who are telling me to shut up, they told Hillary that a couple of months ago.
[02:09:10.965 --> 02:09:11.725]  You know what I tell them?
[02:09:11.765 --> 02:09:12.345]  Go to hell.
[02:09:12.925 --> 02:09:14.925]  I'm going to tell my story.
[02:09:14.945 --> 02:09:17.846]  You just mentioned Seth Rich, who of course was killed during the campaign.
[02:09:17.866 --> 02:09:18.986]  Did you feel under threat?
[02:09:19.989 --> 02:09:20.409]  Every day.
[02:09:20.429 --> 02:09:23.250]  Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren that the primaries were rigged?
[02:09:23.691 --> 02:09:26.872]  I don't think she meant the word rigged.
[02:09:26.912 --> 02:09:33.935]  Because what I said, George, as you well know, after I left this show back on July 24th, I said I would get to the bottom of everything.
[02:09:34.195 --> 02:09:34.876]  And that's what I did.
[02:09:34.916 --> 02:09:39.718]  And I called Senator Sanders to say, you know, I wanted to make sure there was no rigging in the process.
[02:09:39.758 --> 02:09:41.158]  I'm on the Rules and Bylaws Committee.
[02:09:41.258 --> 02:09:42.479]  I found no evidence.
[02:09:43.019 --> 02:09:43.940]  None whatsoever.
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:45.440]  I knew I sent emails.
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:46.141]  Of course, George.
[02:09:46.161 --> 02:09:47.741]  So you're not denying that you sent this email?
[02:09:49.582 --> 02:09:49.962]  I'm not.
[02:09:50.622 --> 02:09:56.044]  First of all, I said, straight up, I said, look, if this was sent, I know why I sent it.
[02:09:56.144 --> 02:09:57.685]  I apologize.
[02:09:58.085 --> 02:10:03.526]  I spent the entire month of August apologizing for the leetagged emails, which is a crime.
[02:10:04.247 --> 02:10:04.527]  All right.
[02:10:05.227 --> 02:10:07.968]  So that is a rat leaving the sinking ship.
[02:10:09.264 --> 02:10:12.565]  Now joining us is Scott Adams, blog.dilbert.com.
[02:10:12.585 --> 02:10:14.025]  Don't have to tell you everything about him.
[02:10:14.846 --> 02:10:23.248]  He predicted Trump would win before anybody else did, other than maybe us, and that he would win the nomination in the general election.
[02:10:23.828 --> 02:10:25.849]  He endorsed Hillary Clinton for his personal safety.
[02:10:26.289 --> 02:10:29.910]  You've seen me get hot coffee thrown on me and more, so that's a little bit tongue-in-cheek there.
[02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:31.330]  Thanks for having me.
[02:10:50.649 --> 02:10:51.530]  Where should we start?
[02:10:51.570 --> 02:10:56.175]  I mean, I want to get into more predictions and why you predicted Trump would win and so much more.
[02:10:56.195 --> 02:11:02.661]  But what do you think of the Democrats, from Wolf Blitzer to Donna Brazile, throwing Hillary under the bus?
[02:11:02.701 --> 02:11:07.106]  I think that shows that Obama and the party know that as a poster child, Hillary's killing them.
[02:11:08.496 --> 02:11:21.248]  Yeah, they're really going to need to reinvent themselves, because I think they realize that the last horse they rode didn't get them that far, and if they keep riding that horse, it's not going to work too much.
[02:11:21.969 --> 02:11:23.010]  I was reading today that
[02:11:24.272 --> 02:11:28.377]  The Democrats are thinking about getting more of an economic message next time.
[02:11:28.937 --> 02:11:37.887]  And I thought to myself, how is that going to work if we have GDP of 4% and record low unemployment by the time the 2018 election comes around?
[02:11:38.648 --> 02:11:41.431]  It seems like they're being herded into a narrow ravine.
[02:11:41.551 --> 02:11:45.656]  It's like the worst place they could possibly be, assuming the economy stays strong.
[02:11:47.449 --> 02:11:51.112]  Wow, that's really boiled down when you put it that way.
[02:11:52.313 --> 02:11:55.016]  The saying, a day late, a dollar short, just doesn't go far enough.
[02:11:55.336 --> 02:11:59.680]  They only seem to now know that they're turning their party into a coastal elite party.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.762]  What they said was about to happen to the Republicans is happening to them.
[02:12:04.724 --> 02:12:09.248]  Yeah, their old technique of identity politics didn't work.
[02:12:10.089 --> 02:12:19.099]  And their new approach seems just even on the surface like it couldn't possibly work unless they know something we don't about some downturn between now and 2018.
[02:12:21.192 --> 02:12:30.482]  But how long can the bullying, the intimidation, the calling everybody KKK members that don't want to be socialist or don't want to live under Hillary Clinton, how long can that work?
[02:12:30.502 --> 02:12:38.531]  Because they've really, as you know, been pressing and getting more and more vicious, more and more threatening, and it seems to be actually making people get madder who are even Democrats.
[02:12:38.551 --> 02:12:39.873]  It seems to be blowing up in their face.
[02:12:41.027 --> 02:12:49.291]  Yeah, you know, both sides do the trick where you try to characterize the entire other party by their worst 20% or 10%.
[02:12:50.652 --> 02:12:55.334]  I don't see that ever changing because it sort of works, you know, and people keep doing what works.
[02:12:55.974 --> 02:13:09.521]  But it does seem to me that the Republicans are sort of becoming the party that loves the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Democrats are sort of accidentally becoming the party that just hates other people.
[02:13:09.901 --> 02:13:11.823]  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[02:13:11.904 --> 02:13:15.968]  It seems the Republicans are reforming themselves, getting back to American roots.
[02:13:16.188 --> 02:13:17.250]  They've been incredibly corrupt.
[02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:23.577]  And the Democrats are just getting more extreme, more bullying in an attempt to hang on, only making people hate them that much more.
[02:13:24.881 --> 02:13:33.085]  Yeah, and I think it's exacerbated by what I call the massive cluster bomb of cognitive dissonance that happened on election day.
[02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:43.730]  So on election day, about half the country believed that they were smart and wise and kind and many other good things about themselves, and their candidate would surely win.
[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:48.252]  And there was no way in the world that this Donald Trump character could become president.
[02:13:49.132 --> 02:13:50.613]  And on election night,
[02:13:51.314 --> 02:13:59.460]  They realized that some of the most fundamental things they've ever believed are just completely wrong, and they had to reinterpret their entire world.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:11.589]  And so I think many of them reinterpreted it, not as, gosh, I guess I was under-informed, maybe I haven't talked to enough Republicans, maybe I've missed the entire story, maybe I've ignored the middle class.
[02:14:11.649 --> 02:14:18.034]  I mean, all the things they could have said to themselves about why the result came out differently than they imagined, I don't think they did.
[02:14:18.194 --> 02:14:19.555]  I think what they decided was,
[02:14:20.035 --> 02:14:23.417]  Well, the other side must be far worse than I ever imagined.
[02:14:23.818 --> 02:14:28.801]  There are far more terrible racists who are supporting this monster for president.
[02:14:29.301 --> 02:14:34.605]  So they had to come up with a story that kept their original worldview, at least mostly intact.
[02:14:35.085 --> 02:14:44.832]  And so in that worldview, not only were they right all along, they were right in the right direction, but it was even worse than they thought, which is a lot like being right.
[02:14:45.712 --> 02:14:46.333]  So I think that's
[02:14:46.914 --> 02:14:50.957]  That's the spontaneous hallucination that people are dealing with.
[02:14:51.317 --> 02:14:53.299]  And I mean hallucination in the literal sense.
[02:14:54.299 --> 02:15:01.304]  It seems to me, and fact check me on this because you've been following politics longer and more closely than I have really.
[02:15:01.344 --> 02:15:03.546]  I've just sort of been getting into it in the last couple of years.
[02:15:05.144 --> 02:15:15.328]  But it seems to me that in the old days, people used to just sort of lie about the other side and stretch the truth, but they knew they were doing it.
[02:15:15.849 --> 02:15:18.310]  It seemed to me there was an awareness there.
[02:15:18.650 --> 02:15:22.851]  Yeah, I'm just going to say something about the other side because this will be a good strategy.
[02:15:23.492 --> 02:15:29.274]  But now it seems, and this is my observation subject to, you know, anybody else's opinion on it.
[02:15:30.183 --> 02:15:34.185]  Um, it seems that they actually believe what they're saying this time.
[02:15:34.666 --> 02:15:37.587]  Like, they actually believe there's a monster in the White House.
[02:15:37.607 --> 02:15:39.248]  Well, you said it better than anybody ever heard.
[02:15:39.408 --> 02:15:46.432]  They smoked their own dope, and in the process of self-fulfilling prophecy, they became the monsters that they were projecting onto us.
[02:15:47.813 --> 02:15:49.835]  Yeah, and I don't think that they realize that at all.
[02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:54.379]  I think that in their minds, if you're fighting Hitler, in their minds that's what they're doing.
[02:15:54.879 --> 02:15:57.201]  Then whatever you do is justified.
[02:15:57.401 --> 02:15:59.002]  So I think that's their moral cover.
[02:15:59.103 --> 02:15:59.443]  Wow!
[02:15:59.703 --> 02:16:06.269]  I gotta say, this guy... You can learn a lot about the weaknesses...
[02:16:07.825 --> 02:16:13.467]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[02:16:14.167 --> 02:16:15.967]  They fear families living together.
[02:16:16.007 --> 02:16:18.948]  They fear people loving God.
[02:16:19.028 --> 02:16:23.670]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[02:16:24.970 --> 02:16:32.212]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[02:16:34.198 --> 02:16:40.641]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[02:16:42.202 --> 02:16:48.305]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[02:16:49.205 --> 02:17:02.292]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[02:17:03.297 --> 02:17:09.883]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:17:11.164 --> 02:17:18.931]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[02:17:20.672 --> 02:17:21.853]  And so many things will happen.
[02:17:23.054 --> 02:17:24.055]  We are the majority.
[02:17:24.963 --> 02:17:33.692]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[02:17:34.853 --> 02:17:39.859]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[02:17:41.308 --> 02:17:43.751]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[02:17:44.592 --> 02:17:52.801]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[02:17:53.481 --> 02:17:59.849]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[02:18:01.711 --> 02:18:02.612]  So many people write me.
[02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:11.679]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:14.062]  We have to fly our flag.
[02:18:15.011 --> 02:18:16.471]  We have to wear our colors.
[02:18:16.772 --> 02:18:21.413]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.934]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[02:18:25.154 --> 02:18:36.397]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[02:18:36.637 --> 02:18:38.658]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:18:39.238 --> 02:18:41.399]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:44.101]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[02:18:44.501 --> 02:18:51.166]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[02:18:51.666 --> 02:18:56.309]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[02:18:57.189 --> 02:19:04.173]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[02:19:04.514 --> 02:19:07.495]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[02:19:07.856 --> 02:19:24.866]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[02:19:25.646 --> 02:19:34.394]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[02:19:35.054 --> 02:19:39.719]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the Info War.
[02:19:39.759 --> 02:19:51.629]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[02:19:51.949 --> 02:19:52.430]  So please,
[02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:58.215]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[02:19:58.595 --> 02:20:01.758]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:20:08.044 --> 02:20:18.954]  This is our land.
[02:20:22.097 --> 02:20:25.383]  These are our people.
[02:20:25.404 --> 02:20:26.105]  The world is.
[02:20:27.142 --> 02:20:32.323]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:20:57.210 --> 02:20:59.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:21:01.073 --> 02:21:01.654]  All right, folks.
[02:21:02.374 --> 02:21:04.015]  I've seen him on other television programs.
[02:21:04.035 --> 02:21:06.617]  He's been on with us once before, about a year ago.
[02:21:07.598 --> 02:21:09.880]  And I gotta say, I am really impressed.
[02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:15.284]  Not just with Dilbert over the years, I've been reading it for decades, but with the way he boils it down.
[02:21:15.364 --> 02:21:18.967]  You know it's true when you hear it, especially when you've experienced it.
[02:21:19.507 --> 02:21:24.591]  And then what's even crazier is you don't hear what he's saying almost anywhere else, even here.
[02:21:26.237 --> 02:21:28.258]  Because I was never even a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:21:28.278 --> 02:21:29.058]  I've been a Libertarian.
[02:21:29.498 --> 02:21:31.099]  And the Republicans have horrible problems.
[02:21:31.139 --> 02:21:33.420]  But the populists have been taking that over.
[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:38.142]  Most of the folks I knew that put Trump into office were the old Obama voters.
[02:21:38.182 --> 02:21:39.403]  In fact, the demographics showed it.
[02:21:40.003 --> 02:21:48.827]  But now, they've gone so crazy that they've radicalized to the point of where they've just dehumanized everyone out there.
[02:21:50.148 --> 02:21:54.312]  Just like that passage from 1984, we just played as we came in live.
[02:21:54.552 --> 02:22:07.964]  So I'm going to ask him to recap what he just said and then expand on it and then predict again, you know, as a linguist, as somebody that's written and studied the art of persuasion and made a lot of accurate prediction.
[02:22:09.104 --> 02:22:18.852]  Where he thinks this is going as a best-selling author and researcher, again the creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams, because again folks know I don't just say hey that's profound all the time.
[02:22:19.052 --> 02:22:21.534]  I think everybody understands we heard the truth there.
[02:22:21.934 --> 02:22:29.040]  So looking at this mass mental illness, where does it go next and how do we not become so radicalized by fighting it?
[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:32.863]  Because when you're faced with the abyss, as Nietzsche said, you tend to become the abyss.
[02:22:34.324 --> 02:22:34.544]  Right.
[02:22:35.105 --> 02:22:40.329]  Well, first of all, I've got it all documented in my new book.
[02:22:41.589 --> 02:22:51.897]  So it's Winn Bigley, and it's the story of how persuasion in a world where facts don't matter is everything you need to understand what happened in the last two years.
[02:22:52.617 --> 02:22:58.622]  So I'm a trained hypnotist by background and been studying persuasion in all its forms.
[02:22:59.378 --> 02:22:59.859]  For years.
[02:22:59.959 --> 02:23:06.245]  And so when I looked at the election cycle, I was looking at it through a different window, just looking at it through a persuasion window.
[02:23:06.946 --> 02:23:16.156]  And one of the things that you learn to look for when you're when you have this kind of a background is you look for what I'd call the trigger for cognitive dissonance.
[02:23:16.336 --> 02:23:21.782]  It's the it's the thing that caused people to flip out and become irrational, a specific thing.
[02:23:22.382 --> 02:23:33.572]  And the specific thing was the election itself, when most of the world thought they understood the world, and surely this Donald Trump character could never be elected president, and then he was.
[02:23:34.012 --> 02:23:37.035]  And they had to suddenly reinterpret their world to make sense of it.
[02:23:37.555 --> 02:23:42.941]  Without changing the basic thing that they wanted to maintain, which is, well, I've been right all along.
[02:23:43.021 --> 02:23:44.222]  I'm a pretty smart person.
[02:23:44.703 --> 02:23:49.808]  So whatever is going on here, it must be something that I'm still right about.
[02:23:49.928 --> 02:23:51.570]  That's the way normal brains work, by the way.
[02:23:51.911 --> 02:23:53.652]  So I'm not mocking Democrats with this.
[02:23:54.073 --> 02:23:55.775]  This is a normal way things work.
[02:23:56.375 --> 02:24:06.502]  Now, the reason it would affect the Democrats more than the Republicans in this specific case is that the Republicans got what they wanted and expected, which was a President Trump overall.
[02:24:07.123 --> 02:24:11.526]  The Democrats got nothing they wanted, and they certainly didn't expect it.
[02:24:11.886 --> 02:24:15.309]  So that was a perfect setup for a trigger for cognitive dissonance.
[02:24:15.829 --> 02:24:25.576]  Now, the other way you could confirm that that's what's happening, as opposed to people having reasonable opinions, is you look for the oversized reaction.
[02:24:26.167 --> 02:24:41.450]  The reaction that if you brought in a third party observer who hadn't been watching any of the election and just said to him, hey, could you look at this person and tell me, do you think this reaction, the size of their emotional reaction, does this seem normal to you?
[02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:48.091]  Or have people organized to literally go outside and scream at the sky?
[02:24:49.252 --> 02:24:50.932]  Actually, that's actually what's happening.
[02:24:51.414 --> 02:24:51.494]  The
[02:25:06.934 --> 02:25:10.756]  And I would think that one of them for sure was politically motivated.
[02:25:11.416 --> 02:25:14.037]  And the other one, I've got my suspicions, right?
[02:25:14.117 --> 02:25:16.638]  That there may have been a political motive to that.
[02:25:16.658 --> 02:25:20.760]  And now he has five broken ribs, a pierced lung, and is in serious condition.
[02:25:22.447 --> 02:25:30.010]  Yeah, add that on top of Trump supporters during the election who were beaten in just San Jose, you know, a short drive from where I live.
[02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:42.135]  So when, during the election, when I famously came out and said that I'm going to change my endorsement to Hillary Clinton for my personal safety, which I always appended to the end of that, I wasn't joking.
[02:25:42.515 --> 02:25:47.257]  I did that actually, literally for my personal safety, and I believe it helped.
[02:25:47.757 --> 02:25:55.422]  Because the moment I said that, people didn't care why I was changing sides, even though it was somewhat transparent that I was doing it for a specific reason.
[02:25:56.382 --> 02:25:58.724]  They just said, well, okay, now we got another one on our side.
[02:25:59.064 --> 02:26:00.385]  Let's go scare somebody else.
[02:26:01.045 --> 02:26:16.475]  So when you see gigantic, oversized reactions like we're seeing, people marching in the streets because they think, you know, a Hitler monster has been elected, even though we're not seeing the evidence of that, and it's been many months, seems like we would have, and even if
[02:26:17.102 --> 02:26:19.963]  People don't really become Hitler at age 70.
[02:26:20.503 --> 02:26:22.503]  You know, that's something we don't really see.
[02:26:23.624 --> 02:26:33.826]  So if they're screaming at the sky, they're bringing guns to places to shoot Republicans because they're that worked up, that's probably cognitive dissonance.
[02:26:34.606 --> 02:26:42.928]  And I even saw some studies showing brain scans of hardcore Democrats that they'd gone through PTSD and the brain actually showed signs of real trauma.
[02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:45.056]  Yeah, this is real.
[02:26:46.256 --> 02:26:51.880]  You know, if your mind goes to that dark place and stays there long enough, you've got a problem.
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:27:05.369]  Now, keep in mind, I had called this out, and I write about this in the Winn-Bigley, that the Clinton persuasion game was terrible right until Bernie dropped out, and then it went to weapons grade.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:11.653]  Do you remember as soon as the Republican convention was over, the moment it was over and they switched to the pundits?
[02:27:12.234 --> 02:27:13.915]  Every pundit used the same word.
[02:27:14.415 --> 02:27:14.995]  It's dark.
[02:27:15.196 --> 02:27:16.276]  It was a dark speech.
[02:27:16.376 --> 02:27:17.557]  It's dark, dark, dark.
[02:27:18.017 --> 02:27:21.319]  That was the moment I called that there must be a professional.
[02:27:21.919 --> 02:27:29.443]  Maybe somebody who was helping Bernie until he dropped out because it was the timing of Clinton's improvement in this area was sort of suspicious.
[02:27:30.344 --> 02:27:36.107]  So as soon as she started saying that everything he was doing was dark and dark and dark, it activated fear.
[02:27:36.807 --> 02:27:39.709]  So she went to fear persuasion, which is the strongest.
[02:27:40.316 --> 02:27:45.423]  She had started with, I have experience, things are going okay, let's do more of the same.
[02:27:45.924 --> 02:27:48.307]  Let's not have these Republican ideas.
[02:27:48.708 --> 02:27:52.593]  Somewhat of a policy-based, experience-based persuasion.
[02:27:52.673 --> 02:27:53.975]  And it wasn't very effective.
[02:27:54.528 --> 02:28:02.534]  But by the summer, she had picked up, you know, the dark theme, and that was just a magnet for every bad idea that everybody had.
[02:28:02.554 --> 02:28:11.461]  But separately, Trump was optimistic for a new, better future, but pointing out that they were the ones that were negative, and they were the ones putting out the negative message.
[02:28:11.501 --> 02:28:15.124]  So it was true, now he's gotten in, now he's partially delivered.
[02:28:15.904 --> 02:28:20.408]  Like you said earlier, how are they going to say it's all a nightmare when we see the economy coming back?
[02:28:21.727 --> 02:28:28.751]  Yeah, I had predicted, uh, prior to Inauguration Day, that you would see the following, uh, story arc play out in the real world.
[02:28:29.311 --> 02:28:34.314]  That they would start by saying, my God, we've elected Hitler, and it would just be non-stop Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.
[02:28:34.814 --> 02:28:38.917]  Until several months had passed, I predicted, and he hadn't done any Hitler stuff.
[02:28:39.657 --> 02:28:43.119]  Because, you know, after a while, you just can't maintain the image.
[02:28:43.519 --> 02:28:44.460]  Scott, stay there!
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:45.201]  We gotta go to break.
[02:28:45.221 --> 02:28:47.902]  I'm gonna come back and talk about your new book, Wynne Bigley.
[02:28:47.962 --> 02:28:48.763]  I can't wait to read it.
[02:28:49.143 --> 02:28:49.563]  Stay with us.

[02:29:31.247 --> 02:29:41.396]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:29:41.616 --> 02:29:48.059]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:29:48.419 --> 02:29:51.040]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.

[02:30:03.041 --> 02:30:07.924]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[02:30:08.725 --> 02:30:11.667]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[02:30:12.327 --> 02:30:15.129]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:20.633]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.

[02:30:27.657 --> 02:30:32.821]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[02:30:33.481 --> 02:30:36.923]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[02:30:37.483 --> 02:30:45.306]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[02:30:45.886 --> 02:30:50.228]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.

[02:31:10.614 --> 02:31:11.101]  Just briefly.
[02:31:12.356 --> 02:31:14.357]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:31:14.377 --> 02:31:15.257]  He's about to retire.
[02:31:15.277 --> 02:31:22.361]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[02:31:22.401 --> 02:31:25.362]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[02:31:25.402 --> 02:31:26.382]  That's a bunch of bull.
[02:31:26.903 --> 02:31:27.983]  You need fluoride or you die.
[02:31:28.543 --> 02:31:31.025]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[02:31:31.045 --> 02:31:31.825]  He said, this is incredible.
[02:31:32.225 --> 02:31:34.226]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[02:31:34.446 --> 02:31:40.149]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[02:31:40.749 --> 02:31:41.210]  Exactly.
[02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:47.279]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[02:31:47.319 --> 02:31:51.105]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[02:31:52.487 --> 02:31:56.012]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[02:31:56.991 --> 02:31:57.411]  I don't
[02:32:13.783 --> 02:32:17.346]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[02:32:17.786 --> 02:32:18.987]  Why does it say nursery water?
[02:32:19.007 --> 02:32:20.288]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[02:32:20.308 --> 02:32:23.210]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[02:32:23.250 --> 02:32:25.212]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:32:25.432 --> 02:32:35.140]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks at McToms of Maine, private-labeled, super blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:36.961]  But you die without iodine.
[02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.501]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[02:32:38.521 --> 02:32:40.322]  If you drink the stuff that's in the store, it'll kill you.
[02:32:40.402 --> 02:32:41.282]  It's different than iodine.
[02:32:41.302 --> 02:32:43.043]  This is the real medical grade.
[02:32:43.163 --> 02:32:51.446]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[02:32:52.067 --> 02:32:54.968]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:33:14.470 --> 02:33:22.497]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:22.837 --> 02:33:25.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:30.244]  Stephen Bannon calls it a war for the Republic, and then they act like he invented that.
[02:33:30.324 --> 02:33:31.485]  No, politics is war.
[02:33:32.866 --> 02:33:41.193]  And as the creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams was just saying, he's a technologist, engineer, before he ever created Dilbert, and then all his other best-selling books.
[02:33:43.973 --> 02:33:47.276]  But for me, I don't promote fear-based stuff to manipulate people.
[02:33:47.316 --> 02:33:48.817]  They are coming after our guns.
[02:33:49.157 --> 02:33:50.598]  They are selling out our industry.
[02:33:50.839 --> 02:33:52.260]  They are doing one-sided deals.
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:34:00.947]  As long as you're scaring people with the truth to get them to take action, like if your house is on fire to get out, then I see it as a good thing.
[02:34:01.567 --> 02:34:03.609]  So for me, I've never studied persuasion.
[02:34:03.729 --> 02:34:07.552]  I just go with my gut and with what's common sense.
[02:34:08.853 --> 02:34:12.757]  And now that Trump's delivered so much on what he said he would do so early,
[02:34:15.273 --> 02:34:30.881]  Compared to the politics of lying, where you lie to people, you manipulate them, and then you don't deliver to them on purpose, because you're such a sociopath, you think it's chump-like to actually care about people.
[02:34:32.159 --> 02:34:40.603]  Whereas a real ruling class would want prosperity that produces more technology, more medicine, more science, so they could skim off the top and be even more rich.
[02:34:40.683 --> 02:34:47.786]  But see, there's a chicken you-know-what factor, a chicken SH, you know what I call the chicken bleep dimension.
[02:34:49.868 --> 02:35:01.533]  That we see in cultures that become decadent, where the grandkids of the people that actually made the money, made the inventions, just become these jerks that hate flyover country and want to dominate and control everybody.
[02:35:02.194 --> 02:35:03.014]  And that's what I see.
[02:35:03.054 --> 02:35:05.655]  But I'm telling you, I'm going to read Winn Begley.
[02:35:05.695 --> 02:35:08.476]  I'm going to try to carry it at the Infowars bookstore online.
[02:35:09.317 --> 02:35:14.139]  Because I've already read two of his other books, Persuasion and A World Where Facts Don't Matter.
[02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:16.972]  And then it goes into the summer of 2015.
[02:35:17.032 --> 02:35:19.494]  Scott Adams was in the middle of a planned career pivot.
[02:35:20.015 --> 02:35:24.098]  A guy who created the Dilbert comic to a maverick political pundit.
[02:35:24.518 --> 02:35:26.299]  And I like the fact that they persecuted him.
[02:35:26.900 --> 02:35:27.680]  He didn't back off.
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:29.061]  He got deeper into it.
[02:35:29.522 --> 02:35:31.963]  And has now created a whole other career for himself.
[02:35:32.324 --> 02:35:35.026]  Winn Bigley persuasion in a world where facts don't matter.
[02:35:36.035 --> 02:35:38.977]  And there's other books he's written as well.
[02:35:39.577 --> 02:35:46.161]  But he gets into the whole way of linguistic skills, linguistic kill shots, setting the table, visual persuasion.
[02:35:46.481 --> 02:35:47.282]  How about this?
[02:35:47.782 --> 02:35:51.644]  They want the TPP, a secret global group, to control and run my life.
[02:35:51.684 --> 02:35:52.405]  Trump's against it.
[02:35:52.665 --> 02:35:53.586]  That makes perfect sense.
[02:35:54.006 --> 02:35:57.108]  How about they want my guns and want to bankrupt the economy to control me?
[02:35:57.848 --> 02:36:00.570]  And make me be a renter and not an owner in my own life.
[02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:02.591]  How about that's authoritarian, I'm against it.
[02:36:02.671 --> 02:36:08.415]  I mean, at a certain point, isn't fear-mongering a good thing, Scott Adams, if it's true?
[02:36:09.902 --> 02:36:14.263]  Well, the ideal situation is the one that Trump used.
[02:36:14.483 --> 02:36:17.564]  I call him a master persuader because he's good at this stuff.
[02:36:18.224 --> 02:36:21.205]  And what he did is he would show you the optimistic view.
[02:36:21.385 --> 02:36:23.886]  You know, if you elect me, everything's going to be great.
[02:36:23.926 --> 02:36:26.086]  We'll have, you know, X percent GDP.
[02:36:26.166 --> 02:36:29.047]  We'll be in a golden age, making America great again.
[02:36:29.507 --> 02:36:32.328]  But at the moment, we're in this bad situation.
[02:36:32.828 --> 02:36:37.990]  So he'll describe the current situation as terrible while contrasting it with the amazing times ahead.
[02:36:38.511 --> 02:36:42.692]  And if you think about it, as soon as I say that, you say to yourself, well, isn't that just normal?
[02:36:42.852 --> 02:36:43.793]  People say it's bad.
[02:36:43.853 --> 02:36:45.013]  I'm going to give you something better.
[02:36:45.454 --> 02:36:48.275]  But if you look at the Clinton campaign,
[02:36:49.553 --> 02:36:53.595]  You didn't see a lot of the world is going to be great under my administration.
[02:36:53.815 --> 02:36:57.897]  I didn't see the upside presented as part of the sale.
[02:36:57.938 --> 02:36:59.438]  That's because they want to break our will.
[02:36:59.518 --> 02:37:00.239]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:37:00.259 --> 02:37:01.459]  They want a permanent underclass.
[02:37:01.719 --> 02:37:04.481]  I mean, Obama said you can't have cars in air conditioning to Africans.
[02:37:06.536 --> 02:37:09.098]  Well, I don't know about their secret thoughts.
[02:37:09.198 --> 02:37:17.283]  One of the things that I always caution against is that we imagine we can tell what's in the minds and motivations of people, and we're terrible at that.
[02:37:17.543 --> 02:37:25.949]  Then maybe Hillary's just super, super stupid, because if she's not promoting prosperity, how's that going to create optimism to get the stock market up?
[02:37:27.059 --> 02:37:42.851]  Well, one of her biggest problems that I read about in the book is that she used to say in her tweets, if you remember this pattern, she would say, imagine President Trump, and then the next part, if you click through, which a lot of people didn't, would be something bad he might do if he were elected president.
[02:37:43.331 --> 02:37:46.634]  But the first part was a persuasion mistake of the first order.
[02:37:47.035 --> 02:37:52.680]  She was telling people to imagine the very thing that he was also trying to tell them to imagine.
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:53.981]  Him as president.
[02:37:54.161 --> 02:37:54.862]  Exactly.
[02:37:54.882 --> 02:38:03.090]  Because until you could wrap your head around the fact that this crazy, you know, I guess they called him Cheeto Jesus at one point.
[02:38:03.450 --> 02:38:06.113]  So until you could take the comical clown
[02:38:06.793 --> 02:38:07.454]  Thank you.
[02:38:25.143 --> 02:38:29.826]  It shows why the Democratic establishment tried to get rid of Hillary, but she was able to hold on.
[02:38:30.246 --> 02:38:36.710]  Didn't she understand that by, again, making Trump front and center, she was actually creating her own political demise?
[02:38:38.692 --> 02:38:41.053]  Yeah, there was a lot of things she didn't understand.
[02:38:41.634 --> 02:38:49.919]  Let me tell you, you're reminding me of my best prediction in the book, which some say didn't quite happen, but I predicted early on
[02:38:50.972 --> 02:38:55.214]  That by the end, Trump would be effectively running unopposed.
[02:38:55.855 --> 02:39:04.159]  And I thought that I detected a variation in the way she looked from day to day that often suggests an underlying health problem.
[02:39:04.659 --> 02:39:10.802]  Now, I'm not a doctor, but hypnotists learn to look at microchanges and facial and other movements.
[02:39:11.082 --> 02:39:15.064]  Some days she looked like she'd been run over by a truck and drank four bottles of vodka.
[02:39:15.084 --> 02:39:16.465]  Other days she just looked okay.
[02:39:16.765 --> 02:39:17.846]  The woman looks like hell.
[02:39:18.956 --> 02:39:22.920]  Yeah, and compare that to Trump, who kind of looks exactly the same every day.
[02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:27.544]  His energy level's pretty much the same, and that's a sign of good health.
[02:39:28.065 --> 02:39:37.434]  Now, we know from Donna Brazile's book now that there was a point where at least she was concerned that her health was so bad that maybe they should consider taking her out.
[02:39:37.674 --> 02:39:43.420]  So that's about as close as you could get to running unopposed, although not literally or technically true.
[02:39:44.915 --> 02:39:46.155]  So it's all being vindicated.
[02:39:46.215 --> 02:39:48.596]  They were thinking about removing her and putting Biden in.
[02:39:49.016 --> 02:39:51.497]  She was basically fixing the nomination process.
[02:39:52.737 --> 02:39:53.877]  Is it too little too late?
[02:39:53.938 --> 02:39:58.879]  Can the Democrats reverse their political seppuku that they've committed?
[02:40:00.359 --> 02:40:13.543]  Well, before you go on for that, I just have to point out something I haven't heard anybody say, but when Donald Brazil was saying we're going to replace maybe Hillary and Tim Kaine with possibly Biden and I think Cory Booker,
[02:40:14.329 --> 02:40:15.649]  What happened to Tim Kaine?
[02:40:17.130 --> 02:40:18.150]  What did he do wrong?
[02:40:18.370 --> 02:40:20.270]  Was he never the right choice to begin with?
[02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:23.271]  It was kind of an odd choice that he would be thrown under the bus.
[02:40:23.611 --> 02:40:29.392]  Now, of course, we imagine that the reason was because they wanted to play to their identity politics.
[02:40:29.793 --> 02:40:33.013]  And they just couldn't have two white guys running for office.
[02:40:33.533 --> 02:40:40.195]  So it was the most blatant confession of racism.
[02:40:41.132 --> 02:40:45.056]  That I think we've ever seen and completely not noticed.
[02:40:45.457 --> 02:40:46.418]  Well, that's a big point.
[02:40:47.299 --> 02:40:48.560]  That's a big point.
[02:40:48.881 --> 02:40:49.822]  And let's expand on that.
[02:40:50.102 --> 02:40:55.108]  She also admits, well, we couldn't get rid of Hillary because she was a woman and that would make women mad.
[02:40:55.448 --> 02:40:57.730]  You should have whoever the best candidate is, woman or man.
[02:40:58.011 --> 02:41:02.476]  It shows how it's all identity politics, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[02:41:03.854 --> 02:41:19.148]  Yeah, I think in the end, one of her biggest problems, you know, if you don't count the basket of deplorables, which, you know, I think we would all count as her biggest mistake, just the fact that she said, I'm going to make a thing about being a woman, you know, even one of her
[02:41:19.668 --> 02:41:20.709]  It's hypocritical!
[02:41:20.849 --> 02:41:21.849]  You can't say that!
[02:41:37.318 --> 02:41:42.346]  White men are better at certain things under their cosmology, but then she's saying they can say women are better.
[02:41:42.566 --> 02:41:50.418]  It's like the pigs in Animal Farm saying, you know, four legs good, two legs bad, unless we're pigs and we walk on two legs, then it's okay.
[02:41:51.502 --> 02:41:51.682]  Right.
[02:41:51.962 --> 02:41:57.145]  Now, compare that to who I would call another master persuader, President Obama.
[02:41:57.945 --> 02:42:01.687]  Even if you don't like his politics, he was very good at this.
[02:42:02.428 --> 02:42:07.810]  And he ran for president as the first African-American who had a really good chance of winning.
[02:42:08.411 --> 02:42:10.232]  And he never made that a theme.
[02:42:10.712 --> 02:42:13.533]  He never said, elect me because I'm an African-American.
[02:42:13.894 --> 02:42:16.635]  He never said, elect me because I'll be your first African-American.
[02:42:16.855 --> 02:42:20.357]  He may have even mentioned it a few times in passing, but it wasn't a theme.
[02:42:20.977 --> 02:42:28.759]  And I think that allowed people to say, okay, as long as you're not making that the theme, we'll look at the politics and we'll look at the policies.
[02:42:28.779 --> 02:42:34.021]  They were very smart knowing a lot of conservatives would go for it for real equality because he wasn't making it racial.
[02:42:35.161 --> 02:42:35.341]  Right.
[02:42:35.501 --> 02:42:37.742]  Yeah, that felt like a step forward for everybody.
[02:42:38.222 --> 02:42:40.783]  Wow, Scott Adams, I can't wait to hear what you say next.
[02:42:40.823 --> 02:42:44.384]  The creator of Dilbert, the new book, Winn-Bigley, out now.
[02:42:44.784 --> 02:42:45.484]  Can't wait to read it.
[02:42:45.584 --> 02:42:47.705]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:06.821]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:43:07.301 --> 02:43:12.343]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:16.784]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:43:16.824 --> 02:43:20.145]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:43:20.805 --> 02:43:25.246]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:43:25.886 --> 02:43:29.147]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:43:29.827 --> 02:43:31.368]  I came in here an hour ago.
[02:43:32.128 --> 02:43:39.349]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[02:43:39.649 --> 02:43:43.450]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:43:44.050 --> 02:43:47.531]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[02:43:47.891 --> 02:43:49.571]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[02:43:50.031 --> 02:43:56.353]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:57.293]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:43:57.853 --> 02:43:59.375]  This is verified by our Mark.
[02:43:59.555 --> 02:44:02.498]  Five-star review for AnthroPlex for men and women.
[02:44:02.998 --> 02:44:04.019]  I take it as directed.
[02:44:04.039 --> 02:44:14.950]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will, of course, increase sex drive as a given.
[02:44:15.511 --> 02:44:16.191]  Easy does it.
[02:44:16.271 --> 02:44:17.272]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:44:17.312 --> 02:44:18.253]  It's very, very serious.
[02:44:18.674 --> 02:44:19.074]  Not a game.
[02:44:19.114 --> 02:44:19.515]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:44:20.015 --> 02:44:21.296]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:44:21.436 --> 02:44:22.216]  Energy all day.
[02:44:22.236 --> 02:44:29.959]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:44:30.399 --> 02:44:31.120]  Another review.
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:32.120]  I love this one.
[02:44:32.420 --> 02:44:34.881]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:44:35.241 --> 02:44:38.763]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:44:39.043 --> 02:44:41.964]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:44:42.364 --> 02:44:43.886]  Here's another one, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:44.267 --> 02:44:47.631]  Five Star Review for Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.
[02:44:47.911 --> 02:44:51.095]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:44:51.175 --> 02:44:55.881]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:44:56.021 --> 02:44:57.002]  Amazing product.
[02:44:57.723 --> 02:44:59.804]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:44:59.824 --> 02:45:01.244]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:45:01.545 --> 02:45:03.625]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:45:03.745 --> 02:45:04.586]  Thank you all.
[02:45:04.986 --> 02:45:08.647]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:45:08.707 --> 02:45:10.928]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:45:11.328 --> 02:45:13.269]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:45:13.769 --> 02:45:17.210]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:18.111]  And I should add,
[02:45:18.911 --> 02:45:20.032]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:45:20.292 --> 02:45:22.133]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:45:22.153 --> 02:45:23.854]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:45:24.194 --> 02:45:25.515]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:45:25.615 --> 02:45:27.216]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:45:27.256 --> 02:45:27.816]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:45:28.056 --> 02:45:28.817]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:45:29.657 --> 02:45:30.478]  But back to the script.
[02:45:30.838 --> 02:45:32.719]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:45:32.759 --> 02:45:33.479]  I love that name too.
[02:45:33.919 --> 02:45:35.961]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:45:36.261 --> 02:45:40.443]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:45:40.503 --> 02:45:43.065]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:45:43.125 --> 02:45:44.545]  You make it literally possible.
[02:45:45.606 --> 02:45:50.432]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[02:45:50.952 --> 02:45:53.775]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:45:54.056 --> 02:45:57.620]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:45:58.140 --> 02:46:00.143]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be.
[02:46:00.583 --> 02:46:03.845]  So, I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:46:04.185 --> 02:46:06.287]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:46:06.627 --> 02:46:12.491]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:46:12.931 --> 02:46:18.655]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[02:46:19.135 --> 02:46:25.540]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:26.600]  It's all a win-win.
[02:46:26.781 --> 02:46:27.661]  That's an awesome review.
[02:46:27.721 --> 02:46:30.503]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[02:46:30.923 --> 02:46:32.984]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:46:33.024 --> 02:46:35.985]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:46:36.025 --> 02:46:37.205]  They're all five-star.
[02:46:37.445 --> 02:46:43.367]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:46:43.447 --> 02:46:46.728]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:46:47.028 --> 02:46:48.809]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[02:46:49.129 --> 02:46:52.650]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:57.732]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:47:11.132 --> 02:47:13.134]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:47:13.855 --> 02:47:18.199]  Matt Dubiel and I will be hosting some of the next hour, getting to your phone calls for those that have been holding.
[02:47:18.239 --> 02:47:22.623]  We're going to have our Chicago affiliate broadcaster and station manager joining us.
[02:47:22.963 --> 02:47:23.904]  Always love having him on.
[02:47:24.284 --> 02:47:24.825]  Just briefly,
[02:47:26.047 --> 02:47:27.928]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:47:28.088 --> 02:47:28.968]  He's about to retire.
[02:47:28.988 --> 02:47:35.951]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[02:47:36.011 --> 02:47:39.072]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[02:47:39.092 --> 02:47:40.093]  That's a bunch of bull.
[02:47:40.593 --> 02:47:41.693]  You need fluoride or you die.
[02:47:42.233 --> 02:47:44.714]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[02:47:44.734 --> 02:47:45.515]  He said, this is incredible.
[02:47:45.935 --> 02:47:47.916]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[02:47:47.956 --> 02:47:53.858]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[02:47:55.808 --> 02:47:56.289]  Exactly.
[02:47:56.349 --> 02:48:02.338]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[02:48:02.378 --> 02:48:06.164]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[02:48:07.546 --> 02:48:08.908]  You don't drink your sunscreen.
[02:48:08.988 --> 02:48:10.951]  But hydrofluorosilicic acid is a...
[02:48:12.153 --> 02:48:14.014]  Hopped-up version of fluoride.
[02:48:14.474 --> 02:48:15.495]  It's been turned into an acid.
[02:48:15.975 --> 02:48:16.776]  And it's an adjuvant.
[02:48:16.816 --> 02:48:17.496]  It's very toxic.
[02:48:17.817 --> 02:48:29.364]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Tom's of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[02:48:29.404 --> 02:48:30.965]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[02:48:31.325 --> 02:48:32.746]  If you drink the stuff that's in the store, it'll kill you.
[02:48:32.786 --> 02:48:33.706]  That's a different type of iodine.
[02:48:33.726 --> 02:48:35.167]  This is the real medical grade.
[02:48:35.788 --> 02:48:38.549]  Super Blue toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:39.850 --> 02:48:50.884]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously and for seven years the
[02:48:51.957 --> 02:48:55.419]  American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:58.541]  Why does it say nursery water that the store with added fluoride?
[02:48:58.842 --> 02:49:01.303]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[02:49:01.323 --> 02:49:03.745]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:49:03.845 --> 02:49:12.110]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[02:49:12.431 --> 02:49:17.554]  Your purchases make everything we hear do possible, including DNA Force now back in stock.
[02:49:18.054 --> 02:49:21.597]  Now, going to Scott Adams of blog.dilbert.com,
[02:49:22.298 --> 02:49:28.751]  And of course also on Twitter at Scott Adams says, how about the book Winn Bigley?
[02:49:29.412 --> 02:49:30.655]  What about the censorship?
[02:49:30.675 --> 02:49:33.321]  Because they've gone through cognitive dissonance, they've gone through traumatic...
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:35.481]  Uh, panic attacks.
[02:49:35.902 --> 02:49:37.483]  They believe Hitler has taken over.
[02:49:37.503 --> 02:49:41.267]  They ignore that the economy is getting better and that unity is increasing in polls.
[02:49:41.948 --> 02:49:48.735]  What do you expect to happen next, uh, as the establishment Democratic Party seems to just get more mentally ill?
[02:49:48.775 --> 02:49:52.860]  We know Donna Brazile's kind of trying to right the ship, but they don't appear to be listening to her.
[02:49:54.736 --> 02:50:00.100]  Well, I think as long as they're not successful, they're going to have to find a new approach.
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:08.105]  So I think just coming hard at Trump supporters is not a path that's going to be productive for them.
[02:50:08.185 --> 02:50:11.427]  So they're going to be flailing around looking for something that works.
[02:50:12.047 --> 02:50:23.335]  Now, the problem is that if they're dealing with a successful presidency, and it's starting to look like that's a little harder to deny, as the economy does well, ISIS is defeated, immigration is down.
[02:50:24.255 --> 02:50:25.616]  We're out of trade agreements.
[02:50:26.696 --> 02:50:39.442]  I would say if you're going to look to the future about what's the biggest wild card, the black swan, if you will, the thing that could change everything about everything, it would be something happening with North Korea.
[02:50:40.383 --> 02:50:43.284]  And now I'm not going to go, you know,
[02:50:44.059 --> 02:51:07.508]  Predict that we're gonna have some great success there But I also don't think there's gonna be any kind of a nuclear war coming out of that because nobody wants it It's the one thing that nobody wants including the North But for the first time, I think you're seeing a situation where the North Korean leader a little rocket man probably wonders every day if he only has a month left to live and
[02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:12.325]  And I don't think that the leaders of North Korea have ever had that feeling before.
[02:51:12.945 --> 02:51:26.861]  So the president has given them this sense of genuine uncertainty about their future that I would think would make them a little bit more flexible if there's some way that they can get what they need at the same time we can get what we need, which will be the real trick.
[02:51:27.642 --> 02:51:28.162]  Scott Adams.
[02:51:29.392 --> 02:51:33.615]  Clearly North Korea had gotten more belligerent, more delusional, so we had to put some pressure on them.
[02:51:34.336 --> 02:51:36.437]  Most defense analysts agree with what the President's done.
[02:51:36.477 --> 02:51:38.158]  Japan certainly agrees.
[02:51:38.218 --> 02:51:40.260]  China's having to now put more pressure on North Korea.
[02:51:40.820 --> 02:51:45.484]  But you pull back at Saudi Arabia, the princes that were
[02:51:46.224 --> 02:51:49.627]  Going against the U.S., going against Trump, involve funding ISIS.
[02:51:50.027 --> 02:51:52.809]  They all just died in helicopter crashes or got killed at their houses.
[02:51:53.109 --> 02:51:54.851]  I'm not endorsed or arrested.
[02:51:55.131 --> 02:51:57.653]  I'm not endorsing any of this, but it is an authoritarian regime.
[02:51:57.933 --> 02:52:02.376]  But it does seem almost magic how all the enemies suddenly of the U.S.
[02:52:02.436 --> 02:52:10.783]  and of Trump and of anti-globalism, every election's going against a globalist, every election's going against a socialist, everywhere the trend is,
[02:52:11.283 --> 02:52:14.124]  The New World Order is in deep, deep, deep, deep manure.
[02:52:14.645 --> 02:52:18.066]  And Trump just keeps coming up aces every time.
[02:52:18.426 --> 02:52:19.727]  I'm kind of pinching myself.
[02:52:19.787 --> 02:52:23.849]  I mean, I didn't expect Trump to deliver this good just 10 months in.
[02:52:23.869 --> 02:52:24.769]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:52:24.969 --> 02:52:26.570]  And then I learned from his family and others.
[02:52:27.788 --> 02:52:30.570]  His dad was a super anti-communist, so was he.
[02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:32.251]  They were donating to the John Birch Society.
[02:52:32.491 --> 02:52:33.552]  By the way, nobody even knew this.
[02:52:33.572 --> 02:52:52.285]  They had their whole Democrat face being nice in New York, and now we have a super libertarian Americana sleeper cell with a guy with incredible energy who's obviously a genius, now is the president of the United States, and just the communist Chinese, the Islamicists, they're all crapping their pants right now.
[02:52:54.028 --> 02:52:55.931]  Yeah, you know, you mentioned Saudi Arabia.
[02:52:56.271 --> 02:53:06.066]  If it's true, the reporting that the new leader over there actually wants to move them toward moderation, that's the biggest story in the world.
[02:53:06.567 --> 02:53:07.588]  That's the biggest story
[02:53:09.221 --> 02:53:10.082]  In 10 years?
[02:53:10.102 --> 02:53:10.702]  20 years?
[02:53:10.722 --> 02:53:11.223]  Exactly.
[02:53:11.263 --> 02:53:12.684]  What is a bigger story than that?
[02:53:13.024 --> 02:53:17.067]  Now, we don't know if he'll succeed, but it is Saudi Arabia, right?
[02:53:17.327 --> 02:53:27.755]  I mean, they're guarding the holy sites, and one would think that whatever they do would have a ripple effect and could be the beginning of an extraordinary change.
[02:53:28.896 --> 02:53:36.682]  We don't know if President Trump had anything directly to do with that, but we do know he's getting along well with them over there, and that can't hurt.
[02:53:38.423 --> 02:53:43.287]  So, I mean, I don't want to be too messianic here, because obviously Trump's just a person bringing back classic Americana.
[02:53:43.908 --> 02:53:45.589]  That's why everybody wanted to move her to begin with.
[02:53:45.689 --> 02:53:46.710]  It's not like he invented this.
[02:53:46.730 --> 02:53:48.111]  We're just coming back to this.
[02:53:48.131 --> 02:53:49.032]  People are hungry for it.
[02:53:49.052 --> 02:54:03.363]  I mean, how would you describe this whole Trump phenomenon, nationalist phenomenon from Austria to Italy to the Czech Republic to Poland to Iceland to Australia to Brexit to the U.S.?
[02:54:03.523 --> 02:54:05.525]  I mean, what happened?
[02:54:07.375 --> 02:54:19.444]  Yeah, I'm not enough of a student of world affairs to know if there's some common theme that runs across all these countries, because sometimes it's easy to imagine a pattern where there isn't one.
[02:54:20.325 --> 02:54:28.972]  In the United States, one of the things that President Trump and before that candidate Trump did so well is he gave people different reasons to like him.
[02:54:29.605 --> 02:54:37.011]  So if you liked populism or you liked his immigration policies, you'd say, that's what I like.
[02:54:37.071 --> 02:54:39.654]  If you liked maybe lower taxes, you like that.
[02:54:40.134 --> 02:54:45.699]  But my favorite is he does something I would call strategic ambiguity.
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:46.580]  We're good.
[02:55:02.003 --> 02:55:15.595]  But if you didn't think religion was terribly important and you didn't really want it to be a big feature of the government, you would also say to yourself, yes, he says these things because that's good politics and we don't know what's in his heart, but he doesn't seem to be a big church guy.
[02:55:16.015 --> 02:55:16.896]  I'm comfortable with that.
[02:55:17.455 --> 02:55:25.140]  So, it's amazing how many times he'll present two completely different visions, and people can be comfortable in the one that works for them.
[02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:25.360]  Exactly.
[02:55:25.380 --> 02:55:26.320]  He's very, very pragmatic.
[02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:27.701]  But let me give you some of the secret sauce.
[02:55:27.721 --> 02:55:28.602]  I know you're a smart guy.
[02:55:28.622 --> 02:55:30.883]  You've been a technologist before you became a best-selling author.
[02:55:31.683 --> 02:55:34.285]  Look, globalism is anti-free market.
[02:55:34.325 --> 02:55:35.486]  It's anti-home rule.
[02:55:35.506 --> 02:55:36.566]  It's anti-nationalism.
[02:55:36.886 --> 02:55:41.229]  From TPP to securing our borders, he's bringing back national identity.
[02:55:41.649 --> 02:55:46.372]  And all over the world, it is an anti-globalist, anti-radical Islamic
[02:55:46.832 --> 02:55:47.092]  I think?
[02:56:07.229 --> 02:56:08.511]  That is anti-New World Order.
[02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:13.475]  My listeners, I will tell you, you kept, Nigel Farage will say, half their supporters came from InfoWars.
[02:56:13.816 --> 02:56:17.980]  We allowed the critical mass, our listeners, to push this over the edge globally.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.843]  So I just want people to know, the secret sauce is our audience.
[02:56:22.815 --> 02:56:23.735]  Well, that may be.
[02:56:23.755 --> 02:56:30.858]  I mean, you've got a tremendous reach, and certainly the things you're saying are compatible with the things who are voting on the winning team.
[02:56:31.998 --> 02:56:37.900]  It's hard to figure out whose persuasion, whose factor is really the key variable in these
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:41.603]  Multivariable situations, but I totally agree.
[02:56:41.643 --> 02:56:42.684]  It's a giant spectrum.
[02:56:42.784 --> 02:56:50.450]  I just want our listeners to know being involved being active busting their butts to stand up for Americana all these years and getting bullied, baby.
[02:56:50.711 --> 02:56:51.491]  We're hitting pay dirt.
[02:56:51.511 --> 02:56:52.572]  We're starting to turn the tide.
[02:56:53.913 --> 02:57:05.423]  You know, I think you just used a word that is very active and this the bully word that the feeling that the people who who other other people thought were in charge.
[02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:10.672]  The people who others thought were in charge were actually feeling bullied.
[02:57:11.092 --> 02:57:23.259]  So a lot of Trump supporters, and I would put myself in that camp in terms of the bullying, we actually felt like this was no longer a discussion about what's the best way to run things.
[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:25.801]  It just felt like bullying after a while.
[02:57:25.921 --> 02:57:28.322]  And you didn't take it lying down.
[02:57:28.382 --> 02:57:29.423]  Scott Adams, the new book.
[02:57:29.783 --> 02:57:31.064]  Winn Begley, awesome.
[02:57:31.084 --> 02:57:31.744]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:57:31.764 --> 02:57:32.465]  Come back again soon.
[02:57:33.487 --> 02:57:34.750]  Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:35.571]  That was amazing.
[02:57:35.611 --> 02:57:35.812]  Wow.
[02:57:35.852 --> 02:57:36.453]  Can we read the book?
[02:57:36.473 --> 02:57:39.619]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with The Fourth Hour.
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:41.804]  Your phone calls, Matt Dubiel and more.
[02:57:42.104 --> 02:57:42.765]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:57:52.708 --> 02:58:01.731]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:01.811 --> 02:58:09.894]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:58:10.194 --> 02:58:14.895]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:58:15.075 --> 02:58:21.797]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:21.877 --> 02:58:28.959]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:58:29.039 --> 02:58:35.901]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:58:36.061 --> 02:58:40.423]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:43.804]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:58:43.944 --> 02:58:50.066]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:58:50.246 --> 02:58:51.927]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:55.768 --> 02:59:00.090]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:01.951]  Optimum levels.
[02:59:03.035 --> 02:59:07.659]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:08.099 --> 02:59:09.620]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:10.001 --> 02:59:11.562]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:11.782 --> 02:59:16.866]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:59:17.066 --> 02:59:18.748]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:59:19.408 --> 02:59:24.472]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:59:24.492 --> 02:59:25.373]  S-S-Secret 12.
[02:59:25.413 --> 02:59:26.194]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:26.534 --> 02:59:26.874]  I think so.
[02:59:56.434 --> 03:00:01.405]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:03.008 --> 03:00:06.115]  Well here we are, the day before Thanksgiving.
[03:00:07.637 --> 03:00:10.279]  Wednesday, the 22nd day of November 2017.
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:15.423]  And again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:15.463 --> 03:00:17.645]  I'm your humble host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.665 --> 03:00:30.596]  But this operation that we're involved in is nothing short of the attempt to not just save Western civilization in the Renaissance, but to save the defense of basic human enlightenment, period.
[03:00:32.819 --> 03:00:36.981]  You know, last weekend, we posted videos on Infowars.com.
[03:00:37.361 --> 03:00:59.373]  Some of them were live feeds of Owen Schroeder, Millie Weaver, Harrison Smith, and others, our crew members out on the streets of Austin, Texas, covering a Hillary Clinton book signing, but also covering a so-called Antifa-Anti-Trump demonstration.
[03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:03.321]  And this stuff just writes itself.
[03:01:03.781 --> 03:01:06.141]  No wonder some people think these videos we put out are fake.
[03:01:07.622 --> 03:01:22.245]  Because you've got a guy in a chicken suit who can barely talk, gibbering and cussing and threatening people, breaking our microphone and then running with police chasing a guy in a chicken suit like something out of a comedy, but it was serious.
[03:01:23.026 --> 03:01:28.287]  I gotta say 400, 500 yards with our reporters chasing after the police.
[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:32.641]  There's bike police on bikes chasing a guy on foot.
[03:01:33.722 --> 03:01:35.742]  So who can make that up?
[03:01:35.822 --> 03:01:41.865]  And the fact that the anti-Trump people are literally drooling zombies.
[03:01:42.526 --> 03:01:46.628]  I mean, most of them, they admit, are paid by Soros and the Democratic Party.
[03:01:47.148 --> 03:01:48.749]  These are the dregs of the earth.
[03:01:49.209 --> 03:01:51.450]  And it's not like just one or two out of the crowd were like that.
[03:01:53.371 --> 03:01:55.452]  Every one of these people is like a
[03:01:58.766 --> 03:02:00.828]  Unspeakably stupid, mindless idiot.
[03:02:01.548 --> 03:02:03.970]  And then there were a few well-spoken, nice people there.
[03:02:03.990 --> 03:02:07.994]  I guess we just didn't like Trump.
[03:02:09.615 --> 03:02:12.718]  And then they were black folks that were also listeners.
[03:02:13.098 --> 03:02:14.079]  So we had those interviews too.
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.842]  And so I could see not liking Trump and not liking Clinton or something.
[03:02:17.882 --> 03:02:19.523]  I'm being a Bernie Sanders guy, so you're out.
[03:02:19.683 --> 03:02:20.004]  Whatever.
[03:02:21.644 --> 03:02:24.687]  And then we've got Millie Weaver who was also out there but separately at the book signing.
[03:02:25.928 --> 03:02:33.474]  I mean just every other woman going F you and trying to grab her microphone away as she walks down the sidewalk just trying to talk to people.
[03:02:33.494 --> 03:02:37.718]  They're so programmed that we're so evil in InfoWars that that happened.
[03:02:38.398 --> 03:02:39.980]  These people are really screwed up.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:41.181]  It's getting worse.
[03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:53.625]  And you know, I've been around the country and around the world, and you go to some little poor fishing villages in Honduras, the people look alive, they look upright, they look savvy, they look smart.
[03:02:56.072 --> 03:03:00.294]  But you go to poor areas of Austin or other areas now, people look like they've been hit with a mutation race.
[03:03:00.835 --> 03:03:01.895]  They look like they're dying.
[03:03:01.935 --> 03:03:04.136]  They walk like they're zombies.
[03:03:04.156 --> 03:03:05.017]  They look like they're zombies.
[03:03:05.337 --> 03:03:08.119]  White people, black people, Asian, Hispanic, they look dead.
[03:03:08.559 --> 03:03:09.539]  It's not just that they're poor.
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:10.560]  They're aimless.
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:12.101]  They're TV heads.
[03:03:12.741 --> 03:03:13.822]  Most of them are unemployed.
[03:03:14.622 --> 03:03:17.384]  And it just shows you what domestication
[03:03:18.846 --> 03:03:19.426]  Does to people.
[03:03:19.667 --> 03:03:30.854]  And that's why what we're doing is such an important fight, ladies and gentlemen, because the Democratic Party and its constituents are slaves of the system.
[03:03:30.874 --> 03:03:33.095]  And the Republican leadership is just as bad or worse.
[03:03:33.796 --> 03:03:36.478]  But we're having an insurrection within the Republican Party.
[03:03:36.518 --> 03:03:39.159]  So this is such a historical thing we're talking about.
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:45.804]  You know, with Thanksgiving tomorrow, I'd like to again thank all my listeners for their love and support.
[03:03:47.691 --> 03:03:53.512]  As men age, they may often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[03:03:53.532 --> 03:04:02.334]  Supermill Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance, reduce and produce superior vitality in males.
[03:04:02.854 --> 03:04:06.435]  And we rarely have it this special, but I did it recently.
[03:04:06.475 --> 03:04:06.935]  People love it.
[03:04:06.955 --> 03:04:07.695]  I'm doing it again.
[03:04:07.715 --> 03:04:10.236]  Supermill Vitality right now is 50% off.
[03:04:12.364 --> 03:04:13.204]  With free shipping.
[03:04:13.525 --> 03:04:16.946]  And when I did this with 50% off a few months ago, it was not free shipping.
[03:04:16.966 --> 03:04:19.707]  So this is as good a deal as we ever do, if not the best.
[03:04:20.688 --> 03:04:25.610]  We're also introducing a sales on InfoWars Life Living Defense.
[03:04:26.310 --> 03:04:27.231]  All supplies last.
[03:04:27.271 --> 03:04:28.351]  That's been sold out for a while.
[03:04:28.632 --> 03:04:29.412]  You can get it for only $22.
[03:04:29.472 --> 03:04:31.613]  That's 50% off.
[03:04:31.973 --> 03:04:33.034]  It is super high quality.
[03:04:33.054 --> 03:04:33.894]  People absolutely love it.
[03:04:34.274 --> 03:04:35.495]  Flushes out the parent sites.
[03:04:36.195 --> 03:04:37.656]  That is so many other amazing things.
[03:04:38.257 --> 03:04:42.941]  And the specials for the last two days are extended as well, but some of those are about to have to end.
[03:04:42.961 --> 03:04:44.623]  Brain Force, 50% off.
[03:04:45.183 --> 03:04:45.363]  25% off.
[03:04:45.383 --> 03:04:46.624]  Pro-Pure Items.
[03:04:46.685 --> 03:04:47.866]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[03:04:48.346 --> 03:04:49.447]  Knockout, 50% off.
[03:04:49.787 --> 03:04:52.350]  But we're going to have to, again, stop that very, very soon.
[03:04:52.370 --> 03:04:56.794]  But the new special right now, again, Supermall Vitality and Living Defense.
[03:04:57.254 --> 03:04:59.116]  We'll be back on the other side of this transmission.
[03:04:59.136 --> 03:05:00.517]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:05:00.557 --> 03:05:02.439]  Without you, there is no InfoWar.
[03:05:07.705 --> 03:05:08.526]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[03:05:08.906 --> 03:05:11.228]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[03:05:11.508 --> 03:05:14.311]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[03:05:14.551 --> 03:05:20.356]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:20.656 --> 03:05:27.162]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping store-wide and clearly the biggest sales in our history.
[03:05:27.322 --> 03:05:29.444]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[03:05:29.644 --> 03:05:33.187]  We've got our new trophy, RainForce, 50% off.
[03:05:33.407 --> 03:05:35.349]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[03:05:35.529 --> 03:05:35.769]  Thank you.
[03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:23.223]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:06:43.991 --> 03:06:45.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of big breaking news.
[03:06:46.033 --> 03:06:58.162]  The House Republicans have passed the massive Trump tax reform bill that many experts agree would boost the economy seven to ten percent growth rates per year and keep us out of the depression the globalists were planning.
[03:06:58.742 --> 03:07:02.085]  That is absolutely huge, huge news.
[03:07:02.946 --> 03:07:03.886]  Tommy Robinson
[03:07:05.367 --> 03:07:10.048]  The activist and citizen over in the UK has launched the Tommy Robinson Show.
[03:07:10.548 --> 03:07:24.050]  And I got to tell you, the story he tells in that trailer, that is the exact story we've tried to tell of globalism trying to sell us out, trying to bring us down, trying to Islamify the culture in their own documents to collapse society.
[03:07:24.470 --> 03:07:28.191]  And so we're going to play that trailer again at the start of the next segment if you missed it.
[03:07:28.691 --> 03:07:33.572]  But I wanted to get Tommy on because I saw reports where families are being called racist or hateful.
[03:07:35.072 --> 03:07:38.413]  If they won't take their kids to mosque on these forced trips to mosque.
[03:07:40.014 --> 03:07:45.835]  I mean, imagine where a bunch of weird men are for sexual mutilization of women and all the rest of it.
[03:07:45.895 --> 03:07:47.796]  So the left is totally allied with this.
[03:07:48.216 --> 03:07:49.176]  That's in the news now.
[03:07:50.316 --> 03:07:59.759]  We have Mall of America up in Minnesota that looks like Somalia and then they're stabbing and attacking people every week just there until no one will go there now.
[03:08:00.219 --> 03:08:02.480]  You can't go to Somalia, they'll kill you in two seconds.
[03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:07.625]  So, what is going on in this larger master plan?
[03:08:08.346 --> 03:08:13.071]  And so, again, Tommy Robinson joins us, TommyRobinson.com.
[03:08:13.491 --> 03:08:19.197]  He's also got the newest book, Enemy of the State, and also Muhammad's Quran, actually quoting what's in it.
[03:08:20.199 --> 03:08:22.882]  Tommy, you're the tip of the spear when it comes to exposing this.
[03:08:23.442 --> 03:08:28.027]  Always great to have you back with us in the Rebel Media and the great work they're doing.
[03:08:28.047 --> 03:08:30.630]  I know getting attacked by Soros and others just like we are.
[03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:32.793]  You know when somebody's doing good work, they're under attack.
[03:08:33.153 --> 03:08:37.298]  So listeners and viewers should remember to support you, support us, if you believe what we're doing.
[03:08:37.318 --> 03:08:38.399]  Because hey, we're not complaining.
[03:08:38.779 --> 03:08:39.840]  We're going to fight regardless.
[03:08:40.501 --> 03:08:48.224]  The more you pray for us, the more you spread the links, the more you buy the products, the more you become a subscriber to his show, the more he can, you know, put out the main broadcast to everybody.
[03:08:48.665 --> 03:08:49.565]  We're in this together.
[03:08:49.605 --> 03:08:50.525]  This is a war.
[03:08:51.106 --> 03:08:54.747]  We're not financed by Soros or the Saudi kings or the globalists.
[03:08:54.767 --> 03:08:56.008]  We're financed by you.
[03:08:56.488 --> 03:08:57.268]  We're in this together.
[03:08:57.328 --> 03:08:59.569]  So, Tommy Robinson, thank you for joining us.
[03:08:59.989 --> 03:09:02.450]  The Islamification is only intensifying.
[03:09:02.851 --> 03:09:05.052]  Weekly truck attacks in Europe and the U.S.
[03:09:05.972 --> 03:09:07.733]  They had congressional hearings last week.
[03:09:08.661 --> 03:09:12.902]  Saying, Jones reported there was an Islamic attack, and Paul Watson did.
[03:09:13.122 --> 03:09:15.403]  That is fake, and we want him shut down.
[03:09:15.443 --> 03:09:20.485]  The number one story on Twitter about the attack in New York was Infowars Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:09:20.805 --> 03:09:24.746]  And the heads of Twitter, Google, and Facebook said, Sir, we censored them at lunch.
[03:09:24.806 --> 03:09:25.806]  You're right, they're bad.
[03:09:26.206 --> 03:09:38.190]  So they're now saying, not just that we're racist, or sexist, or Islamophobic, or whatever the new crap is, now it's fake news to report that the sun came up, Tommy.
[03:09:40.219 --> 03:09:55.588]  I'm seeing, and I think this is only the start of Twitter, Facebook, even just yesterday I lost my blue tick, and I'm gutted about it if I'm honest, I keep saying it, I'm gutted, where they said that this is new Twitter regulations.
[03:09:56.048 --> 03:10:03.251]  New Twitter regulations where they don't want to be seen as though they're endorsing people, so they've withdrew certain people's blue ticks.
[03:10:03.311 --> 03:10:05.112]  I believe Laura Loomer had hers removed.
[03:10:05.452 --> 03:10:10.274]  I believe all the people that had theirs removed are on the right of politics and talk about Islam.
[03:10:10.874 --> 03:10:12.214]  That's the way I see it.
[03:10:12.835 --> 03:10:13.395]  And currently,
[03:10:14.730 --> 03:10:20.236]  Currently Ian Watkins, who's a singer in the UK who raped a baby, he still has his blue tick.
[03:10:20.676 --> 03:10:24.220]  The Muslim Brotherhood still have their blue tick, a terrorist organisation.
[03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:31.007]  Multiple people who have called for the death of white people still have their blue ticks, so obviously they're endorsed
[03:10:31.067 --> 03:10:33.490]  And let's explain what blue tick means for folks that don't know.
[03:10:33.850 --> 03:10:38.034]  It simply means you send in your license once you get big enough on Twitter or Facebook.
[03:10:38.515 --> 03:10:43.740]  You send it in, it proves that you are who you say you are to supposedly stop identity theft.
[03:10:44.041 --> 03:10:48.906]  That's all it means is that yes, you're a public figure and you are who you say you are.
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.281]  That's it.
[03:10:51.301 --> 03:10:59.925]  If you search Tommy Robinson now on Twitter, you'll find multiple accounts using the same picture as me, exactly the same details as me, pretending to be me.
[03:11:00.506 --> 03:11:07.990]  Now, the blue tick used to mean I am the official Tommy Robinson, so people understand that that's what I'm saying is who I am.
[03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:11.972]  Now, there's obviously... Now they've withdrew the blue tick.
[03:11:11.992 --> 03:11:16.495]  But when withdrawing the blue tick, they said because they don't want to be seen to endorse me.
[03:11:16.995 --> 03:11:18.796]  But then all the other people that I've just named,
[03:11:19.494 --> 03:11:21.736]  Even Harvey Weinstein?
[03:11:22.256 --> 03:11:23.056]  He's got a blue tick.
[03:11:23.076 --> 03:11:24.738]  There's multiple other people still with blue ticks.
[03:11:24.878 --> 03:11:27.780]  Well, before we had ours, we know why they're taking it away.
[03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:32.463]  Now people can masquerade as you, say horrible things that are attributed to you.
[03:11:32.703 --> 03:11:34.004]  They're getting ready to steal your identity.
[03:11:34.895 --> 03:11:37.017]  And the media will probably run with the stories, yeah.
[03:11:37.097 --> 03:11:38.437]  Tommy Robinson said on Twitter.
[03:11:38.918 --> 03:11:40.139]  Tommy Robinson said on Twitter.
[03:11:40.419 --> 03:11:44.101]  But to be honest, to be honest, Alex, I'm surprised they haven't closed my Twitter.
[03:11:44.762 --> 03:11:46.243]  And that is the next step.
[03:11:46.403 --> 03:11:47.384]  And that's not just for me.
[03:11:47.664 --> 03:11:49.785]  That'll be for yourselves as well, I think, Paul Joseph.
[03:11:50.006 --> 03:11:52.948]  I think at some point, our Twitter accounts will be closed.
[03:11:53.428 --> 03:11:54.829]  Our Facebook pages will be closed.
[03:11:55.413 --> 03:11:58.955]  Our ability to coordinate and cooperate and reach the masses.
[03:12:00.236 --> 03:12:04.599]  Obviously, I think in a four-week period, my tweets reached 193 million people.
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:07.921]  My videos on Facebook were viewed by 49 million people.
[03:12:08.322 --> 03:12:09.102]  This scares them.
[03:12:10.123 --> 03:12:12.585]  It scares them because we are reaching the masses.
[03:12:13.065 --> 03:12:17.508]  Instead of going on the streets like I used to do in my previous organisation, we don't need to.
[03:12:18.427 --> 03:12:25.560]  We're reaching straight into people's living rooms and talking to them direct, without the media bias, without the attack against us or the agenda against us.
[03:12:25.621 --> 03:12:27.865]  So that's how I see things going.
[03:12:28.025 --> 03:12:28.827]  This is just the start.
[03:12:31.499 --> 03:12:32.740]  Let's get into the latest news.
[03:12:32.941 --> 03:12:36.645]  You've been decrying for a decade that they make children go to mosque repeatedly.
[03:12:36.665 --> 03:12:37.666]  They teach the Quran.
[03:12:37.906 --> 03:12:38.787]  They have them dressed like it.
[03:12:38.807 --> 03:12:40.169]  They're clearly being indoctrinated.
[03:12:40.449 --> 03:12:41.731]  Local governments have been bought off.
[03:12:41.771 --> 03:12:44.934]  They even let the Muslims sexually recruit young girls by the thousands.
[03:12:45.896 --> 03:12:47.798]  You first said that over a decade ago.
[03:12:47.818 --> 03:12:48.999]  It's all been confirmed now.
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:50.881]  Now they're going to go out to the parents.
[03:12:50.921 --> 03:12:51.963]  They're saying that don't
[03:12:53.027 --> 03:13:04.634]  Let the government, you keep your children home from school, you gotta sign a form to let them go to the zoo or the planetarium, a consent form, but now they're saying, we don't want you to have consent, we're sending your kids to the mosque.
[03:13:05.795 --> 03:13:13.340]  Yeah, and what they've now come out and said, if parents stop their children going to the mosque, they'll do virtual tours, and they'll bring the imams into the schools.
[03:13:14.699 --> 03:13:21.704]  Now, my daughter, fortunately, wasn't very well on the day that the children at her school had to go to the mosque.
[03:13:22.165 --> 03:13:28.169]  This is a part of our national curriculum now where they bring all children to the mosque.
[03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:29.891]  And they're being lied to.
[03:13:29.911 --> 03:13:31.392]  They're taken there and they're deceived.
[03:13:31.752 --> 03:13:32.673]  They're lied to with the
[03:13:32.793 --> 03:13:39.382]  They say, this is a religion of peace, and having your genitals cut off is liberal, and women aren't... But of course, they don't tell you any of that.
[03:13:39.402 --> 03:13:43.568]  They say, yo, that's heavenly, that's loving, and the West attacked it.
[03:13:43.608 --> 03:13:47.713]  I've read the curriculum, and white people are evil, but the Muslims are wonderful.
[03:13:48.885 --> 03:13:49.605]  That's it.
[03:13:49.866 --> 03:13:51.426]  And Islam is pro-women's rights.
[03:13:51.486 --> 03:13:53.708]  And this is the sort of things they're teaching all the children.
[03:13:54.048 --> 03:14:05.754]  And I explained to you before, Alex, that when I took my daughter to look at a new school, the bigger school, they had all these, they had, when you took the children around, the children had to do like a test.
[03:14:06.274 --> 03:14:08.035]  And the test was from religious symbols.
[03:14:08.595 --> 03:14:09.256]  And I watched
[03:14:09.896 --> 03:14:12.256]  As the only religious symbols the children knew.
[03:14:12.917 --> 03:14:14.077]  They obviously knew Christianity.
[03:14:14.277 --> 03:14:17.577]  The only other one that every one of them just went straight away was Islam.
[03:14:18.038 --> 03:14:19.078]  Islam and the mosque.
[03:14:19.198 --> 03:14:20.138]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:14:20.738 --> 03:14:26.199]  And I've said to you before as well about when my daughter... I'll bring you back to just my home experiences.
[03:14:26.559 --> 03:14:27.719]  My daughter walked past me.
[03:14:28.299 --> 03:14:31.880]  I had the biography of Muhammad on the side because I was practicing and researching.
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:33.700]  And my daughter walked past.
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:36.881]  And bearing in mind, I want my children to remain children for as long as possible.
[03:14:37.501 --> 03:14:43.445]  I tried to avoid politics and avoid discussions on Islam with them as long as I possibly could.
[03:14:43.965 --> 03:14:46.827]  And I think she was seven years old at the time.
[03:14:47.387 --> 03:14:50.509]  And she's walked past and she said, Muhammad, peace be upon him.
[03:14:50.529 --> 03:14:52.991]  And I said, darling, why have you just said that?
[03:14:53.763 --> 03:14:55.805]  But she said that's what we got taught at school, we have to say that.
[03:14:56.025 --> 03:14:58.147]  And that's right, and your book is written in Arabic.
[03:14:58.207 --> 03:15:01.930]  She literally looked at it and knew what it was because she was so indoctrinated.
[03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:03.531]  You're keeping her innocent, as you should.
[03:15:03.551 --> 03:15:06.254]  And by the way, we just put up mainstream news articles in the U.S.
[03:15:06.574 --> 03:15:08.195]  where they make the kids pray.
[03:15:08.596 --> 03:15:10.397]  Now, I used to hear this 15 years ago in the U.S.
[03:15:10.457 --> 03:15:11.378]  and thought it was made up.
[03:15:11.718 --> 03:15:14.501]  I used to hear you say it 15 years ago, and I thought, that just can't be true.
[03:15:14.921 --> 03:15:16.262]  No, it's all true, and worse.
[03:15:16.362 --> 03:15:17.143]  It's everywhere.
[03:15:17.403 --> 03:15:18.604]  And they're doing it in Austin.
[03:15:19.585 --> 03:15:22.289]  Thousands and thousands of, quote, refugees.
[03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:28.239]  They're full-grown men, 20 years old, 22, in the schools with the freshmen.
[03:15:28.839 --> 03:15:34.648]  And they're putting full-grown men in with the kids, and then they're teaching them, quote, Islam at Anderson High School.
[03:15:36.259 --> 03:16:02.473]  We had, after the Manchester bombing, after the Manchester bombing, in Manchester City, there was a documentary filming in the school, and the school the next day got, after the Manchester bombing, after Alar Akbar had been screened and children had been blown to pieces just four months ago, they got a pupil up, a Syrian pupil, up in front of the class, all the children, which were non-Muslim, got down on the floor, they all prayed whilst
[03:16:06.175 --> 03:16:06.355]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:06.395 --> 03:16:06.716]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:06.736 --> 03:16:07.116]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:07.136 --> 03:16:07.856]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:07.877 --> 03:16:08.277]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:08.297 --> 03:16:08.637]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:08.677 --> 03:16:09.078]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:09.098 --> 03:16:09.438]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:09.498 --> 03:16:09.938]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:09.998 --> 03:16:10.899]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:11.039 --> 03:16:11.259]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:11.780]  Vitamin B12.
[03:16:29.495 --> 03:16:34.537]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:16:35.118 --> 03:16:35.478]  Secret 12.
[03:16:36.958 --> 03:16:37.819]  Optimal absorption.

[03:16:48.443 --> 03:16:49.164]  Optimum levels.

[03:17:31.804 --> 03:17:33.745]  We've got so many other products there that are
[03:17:33.865 --> 03:17:34.045]  Thank you.
[03:18:02.065 --> 03:18:13.295]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[03:18:13.975 --> 03:18:22.943]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[03:18:23.223 --> 03:18:31.613]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[03:18:32.053 --> 03:18:37.099]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[03:18:37.139 --> 03:18:38.060]  But all of these
[03:18:38.881 --> 03:18:47.167]  Are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[03:18:47.547 --> 03:18:53.031]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[03:18:53.471 --> 03:19:02.597]  When you purchase it at Infowarsstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our Republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:19:08.641 --> 03:19:09.161]  We're good to go.
[03:19:25.348 --> 03:19:32.930]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[03:19:33.190 --> 03:19:43.133]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:19:43.393 --> 03:19:45.314]  And this part is most important.
[03:19:45.434 --> 03:19:51.896]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:19:52.256 --> 03:19:53.318]  That means it's clean.
[03:19:53.679 --> 03:19:54.681]  That means it's pure.
[03:19:54.821 --> 03:19:57.606]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[03:19:57.726 --> 03:20:00.310]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:20:00.511 --> 03:20:02.153]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:20:18.104 --> 03:20:22.249]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:20:22.949 --> 03:20:24.391]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:41.162 --> 03:20:44.765]  Again, this is about survival of open, free civilization.
[03:20:45.505 --> 03:20:50.009]  And Islam, under its orthodox system, is like North Korea.
[03:20:51.010 --> 03:20:52.571]  It doesn't allow you to live your life.
[03:20:52.671 --> 03:20:53.992]  It takes control of you.
[03:20:54.573 --> 03:20:55.694]  It creates zealots.
[03:20:56.254 --> 03:20:57.555]  It completely enslaves women.
[03:20:57.635 --> 03:21:01.899]  And the left, globally, sees Islam and a billion and a half people, about to be three billion.
[03:21:02.159 --> 03:21:03.360]  They have, on average, six children.
[03:21:04.141 --> 03:21:05.101]  They see the West dying.
[03:21:06.345 --> 03:21:08.545]  And they say, let us accelerate this process for you.
[03:21:08.565 --> 03:21:09.726]  We're going to bring in Islam.
[03:21:10.006 --> 03:21:12.206]  We're going to get bought off by the second wave of it.
[03:21:12.486 --> 03:21:13.906]  The third wave is going to conquer you.
[03:21:14.206 --> 03:21:15.887]  And they write all these white papers.
[03:21:15.927 --> 03:21:16.607]  I've read them on air.
[03:21:16.927 --> 03:21:23.308]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Shang, the EU, Peter Southerland, the head of the EU program.
[03:21:23.848 --> 03:21:25.048]  Whites are inherently bad.
[03:21:25.508 --> 03:21:26.448]  Christians are bad.
[03:21:26.769 --> 03:21:27.409]  Europe's bad.
[03:21:27.929 --> 03:21:29.189]  And we're going to bring in Islam.
[03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:31.449]  And you go, why would they say that?
[03:21:31.489 --> 03:21:32.249]  They're white people.
[03:21:32.850 --> 03:21:34.130]  They're just getting the payoff.
[03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:35.090]  They're just amoral.
[03:21:36.257 --> 03:21:38.079]  And they understand racial politics.
[03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:50.897]  If you're gonna have, you know, 10 billion people that aren't white in the world, and 600 million white people, about to be even less, whites are all dying, and then it's just like, let's all gang up now here at the end, race politics!
[03:21:52.645 --> 03:21:56.907]  And then it's crazy little demon toads like Peter Sutherland who actually say this.
[03:21:56.947 --> 03:21:58.268]  People say, well what are you doing?
[03:21:58.288 --> 03:21:59.429]  Other people's show is promoting them.
[03:21:59.449 --> 03:22:00.189]  Aren't you about your own show?
[03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:03.091]  Folks, I'm about fighting the New World Order.
[03:22:03.431 --> 03:22:05.552]  I'm about ringing the alarm bell for you and everybody else.
[03:22:05.872 --> 03:22:07.533]  It's not the average Muslim that's bad.
[03:22:07.673 --> 03:22:09.575]  It's not the average person that has brown skin that's bad.
[03:22:09.915 --> 03:22:17.399]  They're being organized into race-based systems by super cold-blooded people that want global domination.
[03:22:18.632 --> 03:22:29.019]  But just like they tell the third world, oh we got carbon taxes seven years ago at the UN meeting in Copenhagen, we're going to tax the wealthy whites when they got the actual global legislation.
[03:22:29.119 --> 03:22:31.260]  It basically doubled taxes on the third world.
[03:22:31.520 --> 03:22:33.222]  They've been exploiting these people all day.
[03:22:33.722 --> 03:22:39.326]  They just want to get them on board in race-based politics, so they're not going to really give them an economy, they're just going to give them racism.
[03:22:39.986 --> 03:22:44.607]  So Tommy Robbins is with us a little bit in the next segment, but I wanted to play this promo for his new show.
[03:22:44.987 --> 03:22:47.488]  And I understand he's doing it from a microphone, a TV studio.
[03:22:47.528 --> 03:22:48.048]  It looks great.
[03:22:48.088 --> 03:22:48.508]  It's wonderful.
[03:22:48.828 --> 03:22:49.628]  That's important to do.
[03:22:49.648 --> 03:22:51.689]  And as he gets more famous, it gets dangerous for him on the street.
[03:22:51.709 --> 03:22:53.729]  But that on the street stuff's great as well.
[03:22:53.749 --> 03:22:54.689]  That's why I still go out.
[03:22:55.069 --> 03:22:56.130]  My own Troyer goes out.
[03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:57.050]  Millie Weaver goes out.
[03:22:57.450 --> 03:22:58.230]  Rob Doo goes out.
[03:22:58.270 --> 03:23:05.772]  Because we show how vicious the left and how vicious Islam is, and how anti-Western, anti-progress, anti-woman they are.
[03:23:06.012 --> 03:23:06.512]  But here it is.
[03:23:07.092 --> 03:23:09.173]  The new promo for Tommy Robinson that says it all.
[03:23:09.194 --> 03:23:09.854]  We're under attack.
[03:23:10.114 --> 03:23:10.955]  They said we were wrong.
[03:23:11.155 --> 03:23:12.255]  We've all been proven right.
[03:23:12.616 --> 03:23:13.616]  Now we're standing up.
[03:23:13.696 --> 03:23:14.677]  The fight is now.
[03:23:14.917 --> 03:23:18.379]  Decide if you want to just commit cultural suicide and be conquered.
[03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:21.121]  Or decide whether you want to say no.
[03:23:21.161 --> 03:23:21.601]  Here it is.
[03:23:26.725 --> 03:23:28.346]  The past two weeks on the Tommy Robinson Show.
[03:23:30.134 --> 03:23:32.178]  How many refugees do you think Germany can take?
[03:23:34.924 --> 03:23:37.068]  Maximum is four million.
[03:23:37.088 --> 03:23:38.711]  You can take four million refugees?
[03:23:41.096 --> 03:23:41.296]  Yes.
[03:23:41.436 --> 03:23:44.937]  If five million Muslims wanted to come in as refugees tomorrow, you'd welcome them?
[03:23:45.457 --> 03:23:46.097]  Yes, I would.
[03:23:46.137 --> 03:23:48.918]  If you look at England, I don't see a big problem there.
[03:23:49.558 --> 03:23:55.720]  Where in the Bible does it tell you to take... Where does it say in the Bible about... Europe started taking 10 mil in.
[03:23:55.900 --> 03:23:56.440]  Quite a lot.
[03:23:56.480 --> 03:23:59.141]  Five refugees have committed acts of terror in Europe in the last year.
[03:23:59.921 --> 03:24:03.282]  If you welcomed 100,000, how would you tell who's a terrorist and who's not?
[03:24:09.967 --> 03:24:17.013]  Could you imagine this in England?
[03:24:17.053 --> 03:24:28.962]  Again, for radio, it's strong, but it's really powerful for video.
[03:24:29.923 --> 03:24:32.404]  Infowars.com.
[03:24:33.265 --> 03:24:36.488]  So again, the globalists know this is another 20-year process.
[03:24:37.705 --> 03:24:45.932]  Okay, and I know it's going to create such societal collapse and such societal crisis that authoritarians want to come in to control the chaos.
[03:24:45.952 --> 03:24:55.519]  But there's no doubt that 10 million in Europe, millions here, just in the last couple years have brought in anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-woman, anti-gay
[03:24:56.400 --> 03:24:56.800]  Alex,
[03:25:21.209 --> 03:25:28.834]  You know what's amazing for me was I've recently traveled to East Germany and I've just come back from Poland three or four days ago, yeah?
[03:25:29.515 --> 03:25:44.965]  The difference in Poland, when you see a country where you never thought people would be grateful for communism at a time, but because they had communism and because it didn't change till 1990 and because of the Iron Curtain... They recognize authoritarianism.
[03:25:46.112 --> 03:25:47.172]  Yeah, they recognise it.
[03:25:47.572 --> 03:25:50.193]  They didn't have an influx of immigration.
[03:25:50.773 --> 03:25:57.975]  So they're still, because they're the only culture and the only race in their country, they're allowed to be proud of who they are.
[03:25:58.555 --> 03:25:59.755]  In our country, we can't.
[03:26:00.255 --> 03:26:06.717]  I've just come back and I've come back and I've seen the most unbelievable scenes of patriotism that I've never seen.
[03:26:06.997 --> 03:26:10.378]  I've never experienced anything like I experienced this weekend in Poland.
[03:26:10.998 --> 03:26:19.888]  I saw hundreds of thousands of Polish who were defiant, who were so energetic, in love with their identity, their history, their culture.
[03:26:19.928 --> 03:26:26.095]  And that's because they've been overrun by the Muslims more than 20 times, and the Nazis, and the Communists, and the Russians, and they understand.
[03:26:26.535 --> 03:26:29.979]  And you're right, they never had the first level invasions in the last 50 years.
[03:26:30.379 --> 03:26:41.263]  Suddenly when the next mass wave hit, that was supposed to hit Germany and Europe, that was already conditioned and broke, they got hit with such a massive wave of giant snakes of millions of people, they went, this is an invasion!
[03:26:42.103 --> 03:26:44.344]  Grandpa, grandma, my mama got hit by this!
[03:26:44.784 --> 03:26:50.826]  I saw Nazi invasions, I saw Soviet invasions, and great-great-grandpa saw Muslim invasions, and that's what this is!
[03:26:50.886 --> 03:26:51.426]  They know!
[03:26:52.827 --> 03:26:53.768]  They know.
[03:26:53.909 --> 03:26:55.231]  They know what it's like to fight.
[03:26:55.551 --> 03:26:56.773]  It's what they said to us.
[03:26:57.314 --> 03:26:58.435]  You haven't been challenged.
[03:26:58.836 --> 03:26:59.878]  You have not been challenged.
[03:27:00.138 --> 03:27:03.603]  The biggest civil uprising in history was in Warsaw, I believe, in 1944.
[03:27:03.984 --> 03:27:04.705]  That was the Jews, yeah.
[03:27:06.175 --> 03:27:10.216]  They all have relatives after relatives who have told them these stories.
[03:27:10.256 --> 03:27:11.936]  They understand the need to fight.
[03:27:12.156 --> 03:27:13.857]  They understand the battle against communism.
[03:27:14.077 --> 03:27:15.897]  They understand what communism has done to their country.
[03:27:16.117 --> 03:27:17.337]  They understand what Islam will do.
[03:27:17.677 --> 03:27:25.439]  And I went and met a politician from there, a leading MP from the Law and Justice Party, their leading political party, who are in power.
[03:27:26.019 --> 03:27:31.040]  And the difference in this man compared to any MP in Britain
[03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:42.818]  The difference in him, how openly he spoke, how he didn't dodge questions, how he was, his main concern and his main reason was to stand up for Polish people and make sure they're safe.
[03:27:43.338 --> 03:27:46.760]  He welcomed me, and it was just, it was refreshing.
[03:27:46.780 --> 03:27:48.581]  He wasn't a fake, he was a man.
[03:27:49.482 --> 03:27:50.002]  He was a man!
[03:27:50.563 --> 03:27:51.143]  He was a man!
[03:27:51.463 --> 03:27:52.564]  Poland is full of men!
[03:27:53.024 --> 03:27:53.805]  Real men!
[03:27:54.907 --> 03:27:55.428]  Real men!
[03:27:55.848 --> 03:27:59.771]  And it was so refreshing to- But you know, Russia has gotten out from under communism as well.
[03:28:00.052 --> 03:28:04.756]  They recognize Islam as an open, dominating force, as a cult!
[03:28:05.016 --> 03:28:05.977]  I mean, it's simple!
[03:28:06.117 --> 03:28:09.740]  I mean, there's not a more ravenous, out-of-control cult in the world!
[03:28:10.801 --> 03:28:17.908]  When I went to East Germany, when I went to East Germany and I spoke to elder people there, they said, we've seen this before.
[03:28:18.516 --> 03:28:19.818]  You can't talk about it.
[03:28:20.459 --> 03:28:21.360]  You'll lose your job.
[03:28:21.901 --> 03:28:22.843]  This is communism.
[03:28:23.163 --> 03:28:24.205]  We've had communism.
[03:28:24.485 --> 03:28:25.887]  We've got away from that.
[03:28:26.127 --> 03:28:27.409]  Now we have the same with Islam.
[03:28:27.630 --> 03:28:28.631]  You can't talk about Islam.
[03:28:28.651 --> 03:28:29.793]  You can't talk about the refugees.
[03:28:29.813 --> 03:28:30.394]  You'll lose your job.
[03:28:30.414 --> 03:28:30.975]  You'll lose your work.
[03:28:31.821 --> 03:28:45.086]  So, to see the difference in the different countries, and to know that Eastern Europe, to know that Hungary, to know that Poland, to know that Czech Republic, I think are going to become countries that we all look to for inspiration.
[03:28:45.166 --> 03:28:46.206]  Exactly.
[03:28:46.266 --> 03:28:47.566]  All because they won't be conquered.
[03:28:47.907 --> 03:28:48.907]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:48.967 --> 03:28:52.208]  Remember, it's the mega-banks, the ultra-rich using the Muslims.
[03:28:52.288 --> 03:28:53.809]  They are being used.
[03:28:53.849 --> 03:28:54.629]  They're victims too.
[03:29:04.454 --> 03:29:04.834]  Carnivore.
[03:29:04.854 --> 03:29:06.496]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[03:29:06.956 --> 03:29:07.837]  All very affordable.
[03:29:08.757 --> 03:29:09.698]  33% off, out of the gate.
[03:29:09.798 --> 03:29:14.621]  The thing I am so ultra excited about, because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[03:29:14.641 --> 03:29:20.606]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[03:29:20.826 --> 03:29:25.469]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[03:29:25.489 --> 03:29:27.411]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and
[03:29:27.771 --> 03:29:28.031]  I think?
[03:29:46.824 --> 03:29:52.888]  We never have any issues, you know, a 20 ounce rib eye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[03:29:52.968 --> 03:29:55.990]  It's called Carnivore Digestive Enzymes.
[03:29:56.170 --> 03:30:00.533]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.
[03:30:00.893 --> 03:30:02.434]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[03:30:02.814 --> 03:30:07.277]  People that are on these ketosis diets, and Atkins type diets, and paleo diets.
[03:30:07.917 --> 03:30:08.898]  It's just amazing.
[03:30:08.918 --> 03:30:09.859]  Made in the USA.
[03:30:10.079 --> 03:30:11.020]  Non-GMO.

[03:30:30.398 --> 03:30:32.419]  Man, I used to eat a big steak and didn't feel tired.
[03:30:32.479 --> 03:30:33.280]  I eat one now, I get tired.
[03:30:33.300 --> 03:30:33.921]  Started taking this.
[03:30:34.481 --> 03:30:34.701]  Boom.
[03:30:34.741 --> 03:30:35.421]  Ate a big rib eye.
[03:30:35.461 --> 03:30:35.721]  Boom.
[03:30:35.761 --> 03:30:36.301]  Eat two of these.
[03:30:36.341 --> 03:30:36.822]  Eat one of these.
[03:30:37.402 --> 03:30:38.082]  It's incredible.
[03:30:38.102 --> 03:30:39.002]  Digest it better.
[03:30:39.202 --> 03:30:40.142]  Aren't tired the next day.
[03:30:40.202 --> 03:30:40.903]  Don't get heartburn.
[03:30:40.923 --> 03:30:41.443]  Don't get stomachache.
[03:30:41.723 --> 03:30:45.384]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive enzyme.
[03:30:45.424 --> 03:30:47.524]  So Carnivore is next level.

[03:30:50.325 --> 03:30:53.645]  It's the big umbrella site, but InfoWarsLive.com takes you right to it.
[03:30:53.946 --> 03:30:54.646]  Carnivore.

[03:31:12.083 --> 03:31:12.570]  Just briefly.
[03:31:13.800 --> 03:31:15.821]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:31:15.841 --> 03:31:16.702]  He's about to retire.
[03:31:16.722 --> 03:31:23.807]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:31:23.847 --> 03:31:26.829]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:31:26.849 --> 03:31:27.850]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:31:28.350 --> 03:31:29.451]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:31:29.991 --> 03:31:32.473]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[03:31:32.493 --> 03:31:33.273]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:31:33.693 --> 03:31:35.675]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:31:35.715 --> 03:31:41.599]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:31:42.199 --> 03:31:42.660]  Exactly.
[03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:48.728]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:31:48.768 --> 03:31:52.573]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[03:31:53.935 --> 03:31:57.459]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[03:31:58.439 --> 03:31:58.859]  I don't
[03:32:15.185 --> 03:32:18.787]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[03:32:19.247 --> 03:32:21.748]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[03:32:21.768 --> 03:32:24.670]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[03:32:24.690 --> 03:32:26.671]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:32:26.871 --> 03:32:36.615]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[03:32:37.196 --> 03:32:38.396]  But you die without iodine.
[03:32:38.436 --> 03:32:39.997]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[03:32:40.017 --> 03:32:41.778]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[03:32:41.818 --> 03:32:42.758]  That's a different type of iodine.
[03:32:42.778 --> 03:32:43.879]  This is the real medical
[03:32:44.380 --> 03:32:52.911]  It's 33% off right now and we have the bubblegum natural flavor organic flavor for children that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[03:32:53.511 --> 03:32:56.435]  Super blue toothpaste available at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:33:19.238 --> 03:33:23.242]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:33:24.102 --> 03:33:25.524]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:25.764 --> 03:33:27.025]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:27.425 --> 03:33:34.512]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.333 --> 03:33:39.316]  People ask me why I get so upset.
[03:33:41.869 --> 03:33:44.071]  It's because I'm not out to conquer anybody.
[03:33:44.311 --> 03:33:45.552]  I don't want to run anybody's life.
[03:33:45.792 --> 03:33:47.073]  I got too much going on in my own life.
[03:33:47.513 --> 03:33:49.834]  And then you study history and learn about people being conquered.
[03:33:50.295 --> 03:33:53.497]  And then you study modern politics and you realize it's really happening.
[03:33:54.438 --> 03:33:56.719]  And it just goes back to, I'm not the toughest guy around.
[03:33:56.739 --> 03:33:58.560]  I never won a fight that I started.
[03:33:58.680 --> 03:34:01.582]  And I probably only started a couple fights and I got my ass kicked both times.
[03:34:02.523 --> 03:34:04.424]  Because I wasn't in the right.
[03:34:04.825 --> 03:34:07.066]  I never lost a fight where somebody else started it.
[03:34:09.875 --> 03:34:23.540]  There's this thing about people saying, all these Imams, and it's the norm, we're going to conquer you, we're going to get you, there's nothing you can do, we're going to take your women, and then it's like, you're going to take my women and bring them to big palaces and make them free?
[03:34:23.620 --> 03:34:23.800]  No!
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:32.943]  We're going to cut their vaginas off, and we're going to not let them go to school, we're going to put hoods over their heads, and we're all intermarried, and most of the birth defects are us.
[03:34:33.943 --> 03:34:36.184]  I tell the British royal family, stop intermarrying, you nuts!
[03:34:37.591 --> 03:34:41.294]  By the end of the different, you know why all the Egyptian dynasties started dying a couple generations in?
[03:34:41.334 --> 03:34:42.394]  Because they were inbreeding.
[03:34:43.575 --> 03:34:56.464]  I mean, it's just not good, and you see this, and then the left's allied with it, and then they had this drag queen festival with all these men, naked, with little kids, only glitter on their genitals, and they go, well it's okay because it's liberal.
[03:34:56.944 --> 03:34:59.906]  But if you saw a guy naked at the park around kids, he'd go to jail.
[03:35:01.547 --> 03:35:04.029]  There were women with Egyptians.
[03:35:05.530 --> 03:35:07.871]  And women with hijabs last weekend.
[03:35:07.891 --> 03:35:10.073]  We have some on video, but there's more on their Facebook channel.
[03:35:10.633 --> 03:35:18.657]  They're clapping, giving money to the naked men with a unicorn horn is all they're wearing.
[03:35:19.658 --> 03:35:24.441]  And then there's silver glitter on his quite large non-erect member.
[03:35:25.981 --> 03:35:26.662]  I mean, this guy
[03:35:28.956 --> 03:35:31.617]  Basically looks like a gay porn star with a little kid.
[03:35:32.217 --> 03:35:33.978]  I mean, it's like, what world is this?
[03:35:34.018 --> 03:35:43.542]  And then there's women with a jibs there, and then you go to these rallies with Linda Sorcerer's family's in prison for being terrorists, and she's saying, feminism, cut your vagina off!
[03:35:43.562 --> 03:35:44.423]  They're like, yeah!
[03:35:44.683 --> 03:35:45.363]  Cut it off!
[03:35:45.763 --> 03:35:48.484]  And then we've got women in Germany going, Allah akbar!
[03:35:49.885 --> 03:35:54.307]  And then now in Sweden, they want to make the national
[03:35:56.553 --> 03:36:03.399]  Flag, Islamic, blue instead of red like turkey, saying because of the Crusades, picking and killing Muslims.
[03:36:03.699 --> 03:36:06.521]  The Crusades were after 200 plus years of Islamic invasion.
[03:36:06.861 --> 03:36:09.463]  The Islamists wrote books bragging about it.
[03:36:09.744 --> 03:36:10.784]  We lost Spain.
[03:36:11.065 --> 03:36:12.466]  We lost half of Poland.
[03:36:12.846 --> 03:36:14.948]  We lost Hungary, Romania, all of it.
[03:36:15.408 --> 03:36:19.451]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, Vlad the Impaler was the big dictator because he stopped them finally.
[03:36:19.792 --> 03:36:20.953]  Do you understand?
[03:36:22.393 --> 03:36:37.719]  Tommy, what is this, like these women that we know go to these anti-racism festivals in Sweden, and they're literally gang rape festivals where they line up 20 deep and rape women, the police do nothing, and the women later say, well, I'm Swedish so I deserve to be raped.
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:43.682]  And you're watching these women like begging for their lives being raped, and the liberals are like, it's liberal!
[03:36:43.942 --> 03:36:44.502]  It's liberal!
[03:36:44.802 --> 03:36:47.003]  Why is the left so into this?
[03:36:48.137 --> 03:36:49.258]  I've seen those interviews.
[03:36:49.618 --> 03:36:55.182]  I've seen those interviews with a Swedish lady when they're asking her and she said, well, maybe it's something we done.
[03:36:55.642 --> 03:36:58.104]  Maybe we didn't because of their culture.
[03:36:58.524 --> 03:37:00.566]  It's like, it's painful.
[03:37:01.206 --> 03:37:01.686]  It's painful.
[03:37:01.706 --> 03:37:05.629]  And to be honest, you see that this left wing hysteria that's involved in this.
[03:37:06.390 --> 03:37:11.333]  I don't know any girls from our background or my background or any women I know that align to that.
[03:37:11.744 --> 03:37:24.149]  So I don't want to kid myself that, because this is a very loud, a very loud and prominent far-left group, but I wouldn't say they're in any way mainstream of the people, of the people, but they are in control of the media.
[03:37:24.169 --> 03:37:30.652]  There are, it's like, you know, you're talking, those videos you just showed me of that man with that young child, that picture there.
[03:37:30.912 --> 03:37:31.152]  Yes.
[03:37:31.392 --> 03:37:32.073]  What is that?
[03:37:32.973 --> 03:37:39.896]  And just this week, just this week in the news in the UK, they're trialling it out in seven schools in London, where
[03:37:40.723 --> 03:37:53.018]  Ladyboys, which is all they can be called, ladyboys, transgenders, whatever you call them, will be going into nurseries, to children aged two and three, to talk to them about gender.
[03:37:54.921 --> 03:37:55.642]  Aged two and three!
[03:37:56.380 --> 03:38:03.605]  Are they taking that on my... If anyone stood next to my kid... No, no, they bring scantily dressed men into the public schools in the U.S.
[03:38:04.105 --> 03:38:13.632]  and they tell the kids, you're not a boy, you're a girl, you're gonna be a drag queen, and then a guy takes his pants off and walks around naked and the children hug and kiss him on TV.
[03:38:13.892 --> 03:38:14.873]  That's what we do in Austin.
[03:38:16.514 --> 03:38:20.417]  If anyone stood next to my kid like that, they'd know about it.
[03:38:20.437 --> 03:38:23.379]  If anyone stood... That is a... But you're hateful!
[03:38:23.419 --> 03:38:25.841]  You don't want to let your kids give money to guys pole dancing?
[03:38:26.718 --> 03:38:27.718]  That's child abuse.
[03:38:28.519 --> 03:38:29.299]  That's child abuse.
[03:38:30.079 --> 03:38:31.200]  Kids should not see that.
[03:38:32.981 --> 03:38:43.085]  It's funny, it's just mad timing that you're showing me that and just this week in the UK they're putting plans as a trial for seven schools in London.
[03:38:43.908 --> 03:38:48.511]  Where transgenders, ladyboys, whatever you call them, will be entering into schools.
[03:38:48.571 --> 03:38:52.153]  Oh yeah, that's Tavistock Institute, MI6, to break up the family.
[03:38:52.173 --> 03:39:01.958]  The government's going to come in, confuse your child, and then give them to a new sexual mentor that will be like their new mommy or daddy who is a obese man in a dress.
[03:39:03.509 --> 03:39:08.334]  We've just had a teacher suspended in Oxford, in England, this week.
[03:39:08.715 --> 03:39:16.002]  He's been suspended from work because he's got a girl, two girls, but one of the girls now decides she's a boy.
[03:39:16.022 --> 03:39:22.528]  Now he's been teaching them and at the end of their class, whatever they've done, he said, you've done well, good work girls.
[03:39:23.437 --> 03:39:24.678]  He's been suspended because he said ghost!
[03:39:24.878 --> 03:39:25.779]  That's right, let's go back.
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:28.942]  Parents are telling their one-year-olds, you're another sex now.
[03:39:29.182 --> 03:39:34.126]  There was a headline, transgender teaching to elementary schools and nurseries.
[03:39:34.166 --> 03:39:45.255]  There was a headline, nursery students to be at their brains scrambled, as Camille Paglia says, total child abuse run by the Tavistock Institute, mind control division of MI6.
[03:39:45.615 --> 03:39:48.017]  You can't make that up, London Evening Standard.
[03:39:49.244 --> 03:39:49.904]  No, that's it.
[03:39:50.364 --> 03:39:52.685]  And that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:39:52.725 --> 03:39:53.866]  That's this week in the UK.
[03:39:54.566 --> 03:39:59.688]  That's this week in the... Sir, it's Australia, it's Canada, it's Scotland, it's Germany.
[03:40:00.008 --> 03:40:12.552]  Sir, here, they take children in to hotels at ballrooms, men walk out with nothing on except glitter on their genitals and then kiss the children on TV just to get everybody ready for it.
[03:40:12.632 --> 03:40:13.212]  That's all they're doing.
[03:40:13.232 --> 03:40:14.733]  It's like, look, we'll do what we want.
[03:40:14.933 --> 03:40:15.593]  We conquer you.
[03:40:16.818 --> 03:40:24.919]  It's like, I said 30 years ago, 30 years ago, this whole gender fluid argument would have been seen so, as a never, as a never.
[03:40:25.180 --> 03:40:29.460]  I think they're preparing, I think paedophilia, paedophilia in the next 20, 30 years.
[03:40:29.480 --> 03:40:33.741]  Oh yeah, this is, paedophilia's coming out, and a lot of folks are idiots and don't get it, but that's what this is.
[03:40:34.161 --> 03:40:37.022]  Quote, we're gonna teach two year olds how to be transgender.
[03:40:37.882 --> 03:40:44.623]  We're gonna teach boys and girls that you're not what your biology is, we, I mean, this is total sexualization, they're just doing it!
[03:40:45.782 --> 03:40:52.245]  We've got celebrities, Chris Evans, turning up on the red carpet, and his son is wearing a dress.
[03:40:52.666 --> 03:40:55.627]  His six-year-old son is wearing a dress.
[03:40:55.647 --> 03:40:58.709]  And I think when a journalist asked him, why is your son in a dress?
[03:40:59.049 --> 03:41:00.770]  He said, it's not a dress, it's gender neutral.
[03:41:01.350 --> 03:41:03.711]  But see, they play these mind games.
[03:41:03.751 --> 03:41:07.213]  This is meant to destabilize civilization so they can commit all their crimes.
[03:41:07.233 --> 03:41:10.255]  But Harvey Weinstein and their whole program is going to fail, my brother.
[03:41:12.704 --> 03:41:18.129]  But isn't it funny how Islam says you can have sex with boys, but men can't have sex with men.
[03:41:18.149 --> 03:41:22.433]  So boys are for pleasure, women are for sex according to Islam.
[03:41:22.654 --> 03:41:25.016]  Is that why it meshes so well as the pro-pedophile thing?
[03:41:26.547 --> 03:41:29.768]  There you go, Chris Evans wears Sunwears dress.
[03:41:30.208 --> 03:41:32.729]  You are playing with children's minds.
[03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:34.930]  You are confusing kids.
[03:41:36.851 --> 03:41:37.771]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:41:37.851 --> 03:41:41.073]  And it's like, these discussions should never be had with children.
[03:41:41.453 --> 03:41:43.674]  You are disturbing children.
[03:41:43.914 --> 03:41:44.794]  And do you know what?
[03:41:44.814 --> 03:41:49.936]  Armies of perverts have taken control of the schools and they use our open society to do it.
[03:41:49.976 --> 03:41:51.617]  They know just what they're doing.
[03:41:51.657 --> 03:41:52.217]  They're pervs.
[03:41:53.118 --> 03:42:01.465]  Do you know, I spoke to someone the other day who works at a real high-end private school, a really top private school, and she said, do you know the numbers in the private school?
[03:42:01.485 --> 03:42:06.889]  So obviously in our working class schools, this would still be rare, no kids coming in in a dress, I wouldn't have said so, yeah?
[03:42:07.229 --> 03:42:22.101]  When you get to the posh high-end society, their children are turning up, like she said, what they wear, they don't have to wear a uniform at this real high-end school, what they all come dressed in, half the boys are in dresses, half the boys are dressed in all silk, it's like,
[03:42:22.762 --> 03:42:23.643]  What are you creating?
[03:42:24.423 --> 03:42:24.863]  What are you doing?
[03:42:24.883 --> 03:42:30.446]  They're teaching men not to be assertive, and they're teaching women to be basket cases.
[03:42:30.526 --> 03:42:32.047]  It's how you bring civilization down.
[03:42:32.387 --> 03:42:33.428]  It's all declassified.
[03:42:33.748 --> 03:42:37.730]  Tommy Robinson, I want to get you back very, very soon from the front lines there.
[03:42:38.011 --> 03:42:42.713]  Congratulations on your best-selling books and all the work you're doing and what the Rebel's doing.
[03:42:43.113 --> 03:42:44.414]  Hold strong, hold fast.
[03:42:44.734 --> 03:42:45.835]  We're going to ring the alarm bell.
[03:42:45.855 --> 03:42:48.777]  It's always darker before the dawn, and I believe humanity is awakening.
[03:42:49.057 --> 03:42:50.838]  I know you do as well, so we'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[03:42:51.827 --> 03:42:52.332]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:42:52.433 --> 03:42:52.797]  Cheers, man.
[03:42:52.979 --> 03:42:53.908]  We'll be back with breaking news.
[03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:10.855]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:43:10.915 --> 03:43:11.375]  That's right.
[03:43:11.435 --> 03:43:16.438]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:43:16.698 --> 03:43:23.122]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[03:43:23.362 --> 03:43:30.692]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:43:30.973 --> 03:43:31.153]  Woo!
[03:43:31.213 --> 03:43:32.134]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:43:32.254 --> 03:43:38.944]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[03:43:39.104 --> 03:43:40.826]  There is no comparison.
[03:43:40.966 --> 03:43:50.214]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:43:50.575 --> 03:43:53.898]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:43:54.018 --> 03:43:57.981]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:43:58.121 --> 03:43:59.042]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:43:59.202 --> 03:44:01.785]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:06.323 --> 03:44:07.144]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[03:44:07.524 --> 03:44:09.846]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[03:44:10.126 --> 03:44:12.908]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[03:44:13.168 --> 03:44:18.953]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:19.273 --> 03:44:25.758]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide and clearly the biggest sales in our history.
[03:44:25.938 --> 03:44:28.039]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[03:44:28.260 --> 03:44:31.802]  We've got our new tropic RainForce 50% off.
[03:44:32.022 --> 03:44:33.964]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[03:44:34.124 --> 03:44:34.384]  I think so.
[03:45:06.454 --> 03:45:07.355]  Let's talk to Danny.
[03:45:07.375 --> 03:45:08.235]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[03:45:08.275 --> 03:45:08.935]  You're on the air, Danny.
[03:45:09.336 --> 03:45:09.556]  Hi.
[03:45:09.656 --> 03:45:14.638]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[03:45:14.658 --> 03:45:14.978]  Thank you.
[03:45:14.998 --> 03:45:23.183]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one?
[03:45:24.083 --> 03:45:37.128]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[03:45:37.208 --> 03:45:46.492]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[03:45:46.892 --> 03:45:51.074]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[03:45:51.734 --> 03:45:53.535]  And it reboots itself.
[03:45:53.635 --> 03:45:56.055]  So, I mean, think about that.
[03:45:56.436 --> 03:46:07.919]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[03:46:07.999 --> 03:46:08.680]  Let me be clear.
[03:46:08.800 --> 03:46:15.962]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on bio-PQQ-elomics and DNA force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[03:46:16.642 --> 03:46:18.604]  It regenerates nerves in some cases.
[03:46:18.624 --> 03:46:21.447]  So an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[03:46:21.487 --> 03:46:22.328]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[03:46:22.648 --> 03:46:25.892]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[03:46:26.232 --> 03:46:27.614]  I took DNA for a few months.
[03:46:27.714 --> 03:46:28.254]  It came back.
[03:46:28.354 --> 03:46:28.895]  Sort of tingling.
[03:46:29.235 --> 03:46:30.216]  The feeling is back.
[03:46:30.376 --> 03:46:32.058]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[03:46:32.138 --> 03:46:33.700]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[03:46:33.940 --> 03:46:44.430]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[03:46:44.490 --> 03:46:46.712]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[03:46:46.772 --> 03:46:48.994]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[03:46:49.034 --> 03:46:51.997]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[03:46:52.037 --> 03:46:53.899]  But we're running the biggest specials.
[03:46:53.939 --> 03:46:58.383]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:47:13.507 --> 03:47:15.190]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[03:47:15.250 --> 03:47:16.451]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.872 --> 03:47:20.116]  Coming up, John Rappaport's going to host the fourth hour, then the War Room.
[03:47:20.577 --> 03:47:22.420]  Owen Schroer for three hours, coming up.
[03:47:22.740 --> 03:47:25.203]  Then back tomorrow morning, David Knight kicks it off 8 a.m.
[03:47:25.223 --> 03:47:27.507]  Central with The Real News with David Knight.
[03:47:28.527 --> 03:47:30.528]  Look, there's so much news I haven't gotten to.
[03:47:30.588 --> 03:47:34.710]  Literally hundreds of important stories that are in newswars.com and infowars.com.
[03:47:34.730 --> 03:47:35.131]  Look at this one.
[03:47:35.551 --> 03:47:39.833]  Polk claims global warming deniers embrace perverse attitudes.
[03:47:40.594 --> 03:47:42.975]  He also said conservatives are like poop eaters.
[03:47:43.675 --> 03:47:44.876]  Who even thinks of that?
[03:47:46.097 --> 03:47:49.119]  So holy that you talk about reportedly his favorite snack.
[03:47:50.299 --> 03:47:53.201]  I guess it's from his own species, baboon poop.
[03:47:54.059 --> 03:47:55.079]  That's called satire.
[03:47:55.099 --> 03:47:57.500]  He's not as cool as a baboon, but he does eat baboon poop.
[03:47:57.980 --> 03:47:58.740]  Okay, I'm just joking.
[03:47:58.780 --> 03:48:02.862]  The point is, he does say that we love to eat poop, so I'm just going to talk about how he loves to eat poop.
[03:48:03.542 --> 03:48:04.902]  I mean, that's turnabout's fair play, right?
[03:48:05.643 --> 03:48:09.544]  Pope claims global warming deniers embrace perverse attitudes.
[03:48:10.284 --> 03:48:11.965]  Yes, if you deny that there's global warming.
[03:48:12.205 --> 03:48:16.006]  Hey, they already moved on to say climate change, and we believe climate change is happening.
[03:48:16.046 --> 03:48:21.187]  Just that paying carbon taxes to you, indulgences to you, won't save us, you false pope.
[03:48:25.390 --> 03:48:27.532]  Continuing, Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:48:27.592 --> 03:48:31.375]  Media goes insane after President of the United States drinks from a water bottle.
[03:48:31.896 --> 03:48:33.397]  And for me, he wants a little drink.
[03:48:34.198 --> 03:48:35.619]  He doesn't want to spill it on himself.
[03:48:35.739 --> 03:48:37.121]  Trump is all about precision.
[03:48:37.941 --> 03:48:40.964]  He puts it up, closes his lips, slurps a quick drink.
[03:48:41.845 --> 03:48:43.326]  That's exactly how anybody would do it.
[03:48:43.346 --> 03:48:44.727]  Didn't want to spill it, just a little quick boom.
[03:48:45.368 --> 03:48:46.229]  Screws the top on.
[03:48:47.330 --> 03:48:48.471]  Does it very judiciously.
[03:48:50.339 --> 03:48:53.561]  Imagine how much he works without a teleprompter, how much he hits out of the park.
[03:48:54.042 --> 03:49:01.727]  And then Trevor Noah and all these little losers that don't even write their own stuff for their teleprompters go, oh, Trump looks so weird when he drinks out of a bottle.
[03:49:01.747 --> 03:49:04.208]  Let me show you some of the quotes here.
[03:49:04.749 --> 03:49:06.150]  We're up on Infowars.com.
[03:49:06.610 --> 03:49:13.695]  And they just, everything he does, how he shakes hands or what he does, it's just, oh, it's so weird.
[03:49:14.455 --> 03:49:16.597]  It's so, and then like, I'm like, man, he's like a,
[03:49:17.659 --> 03:49:28.245]  Pit card guy, you know, the people, the stock car racing and the crew, the pit crew, like how well he just, boom, screws the top off, takes a quick drink and screws it on so well.
[03:49:28.345 --> 03:49:31.767]  I mean, half the time I dribble water on myself.
[03:49:33.028 --> 03:49:36.050]  But we've got, you know, little comments here by these actors.
[03:49:38.391 --> 03:49:40.352]  He's talking about bringing back Jobs America.
[03:49:40.392 --> 03:49:41.613]  He's drinking a bottle of water.
[03:49:41.633 --> 03:49:42.733]  Fiji, it's Fiji water.
[03:49:44.014 --> 03:49:45.215]  I drink a lot of water, often.
[03:49:46.431 --> 03:49:48.152]  I don't drink it often, but when I do, it looks weird.
[03:49:48.212 --> 03:49:49.032]  Mock Trevor Noah.
[03:49:49.872 --> 03:49:51.593]  Hey, I'm sorry the economy's back.
[03:49:51.633 --> 03:49:55.334]  I'm sorry that there's a big tax cut just got passed in the House.
[03:49:56.554 --> 03:50:00.635]  I'm sure your Senate friends will try to kill it.
[03:50:02.556 --> 03:50:03.956]  But we're building our own ecosystem.
[03:50:04.657 --> 03:50:05.717]  We're building our own media.
[03:50:06.157 --> 03:50:09.478]  I see it as my job and the listeners' job if they join me in the quest, and they have.
[03:50:09.958 --> 03:50:10.939]  That's what's so magic about it.
[03:50:10.979 --> 03:50:12.899]  Thank you for being on the same page.
[03:50:13.239 --> 03:50:13.879]  You're the power.
[03:50:14.340 --> 03:50:15.340]  That's not patronization.
[03:50:17.355 --> 03:50:19.156]  I think about you and I get chills up my spine.
[03:50:19.176 --> 03:50:19.896]  You're amazing.
[03:50:21.137 --> 03:50:24.158]  That's why they attack you, that's why they say you're scum, that's why they say you're dumb.
[03:50:24.178 --> 03:50:32.623]  Even though we have the Google demographics that our listeners are amongst the most informed and upper middle class, wealthy, down to blue collar, you name it.
[03:50:32.643 --> 03:50:38.266]  But the widest spectrum of racial and regional and cultural backgrounds.
[03:50:38.306 --> 03:50:40.447]  We have just an incredibly diverse audience.
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:44.281]  But statistically we do have the wealthiest audience in talk radio.
[03:50:44.501 --> 03:50:46.882]  We also have the richest IP addresses tuning in.
[03:50:47.562 --> 03:50:48.883]  They ought to do a show on that and show people.
[03:50:49.403 --> 03:50:55.445]  But the elite's like, oh yeah, you don't really have the elite listening when they're all tuned in constantly and obsessed.
[03:50:55.485 --> 03:51:03.608]  The good elite, the bad elite, the elite financially, the elite predators, the elite alpha maggots, the elite patriots, the elite in sports, the elite in business.
[03:51:03.648 --> 03:51:04.388]  I mean, they listen!
[03:51:04.848 --> 03:51:10.670]  Because, you know, we told you Al Franken was going to get in trouble 12 hours before everybody else did.
[03:51:12.284 --> 03:51:13.785]  Get tomorrow's news today.
[03:51:13.865 --> 03:51:15.026]  Get next week's news today.
[03:51:15.447 --> 03:51:17.068]  Get next year's news today.
[03:51:17.148 --> 03:51:19.049]  I mean, get 20 years from now today.
[03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:20.731]  We've proven it!
[03:51:21.331 --> 03:51:22.172]  Everybody knows it!
[03:51:24.554 --> 03:51:31.139]  And it's why they've got big, giant attacks behind the scenes against us to shut us down.
[03:51:32.577 --> 03:51:38.319]  And it's why I'm asking all of you to pray for us, number one, because I know that's the determinative issue.
[03:51:38.660 --> 03:51:50.325]  I've seen the providence, and I know God's so real that I'm like a worm, a groveling, dirty, little, slimy, buck-toothed worm.
[03:51:51.325 --> 03:51:53.246]  But I love God, and I'm not out to get you.
[03:51:53.286 --> 03:51:57.868]  But in the presence of God, it's like,
[03:52:00.113 --> 03:52:01.414]  And I am the presence of God.
[03:52:01.474 --> 03:52:03.316]  I got a relationship with God.
[03:52:03.716 --> 03:52:05.197]  I'm dialed in 24-7.
[03:52:06.418 --> 03:52:07.519]  Most people have a religious experience.
[03:52:07.559 --> 03:52:08.840]  Five seconds, they can't even handle it.
[03:52:08.900 --> 03:52:11.082]  I'm jacked into the high voltage, okay?
[03:52:11.863 --> 03:52:12.343]  I'm jacked in.
[03:52:14.265 --> 03:52:16.106]  And it's something else.
[03:52:16.226 --> 03:52:20.870]  But when you're jacked into God, you realize how bad you are.
[03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:22.591]  And that's not like some beat myself on the head.
[03:52:22.631 --> 03:52:25.574]  I'm just saying the humbleness of it.
[03:52:26.704 --> 03:52:42.589]  And I just wish all these people who think they're part of the power structure could really have a moment with God, a moment of opening their heart, not being so arrogant, and just say, God, just show me, just give me the discernment, just show me a little bit, and you're gonna be like, whoa, wow, that's amazing, yeah!
[03:52:43.089 --> 03:52:49.932]  Then sell out to the New World Order for a big mansion with a bunch of empty vampires around me, a big prison?
[03:52:52.172 --> 03:52:53.673]  When all I wanna do is somehow
[03:52:56.021 --> 03:53:11.948]  I mean, I even feel guilty wanting to be close to God, because I can feel God's presence, and I love God, and then you get just a tiny bit of the reflection of God on you, and just a little bit of God's intellect, and it's like, I can't even believe this.
[03:53:12.528 --> 03:53:15.330]  I cannot even believe people would join Satan.
[03:53:16.510 --> 03:53:24.854]  I just, I cannot even imagine how embarrassed I am in the presence of God.
[03:53:31.172 --> 03:53:32.033]  It's incredible.
[03:53:33.053 --> 03:53:40.217]  And just to realize the wicked does several things but they're completely wicked and don't care.
[03:53:40.617 --> 03:53:53.824]  They know we care and have a conscience so they attack us with darts how we're evil and how we did bad to freak us out and then we haven't done something and they hit us with a big lie like all these men they accuse of raping women that isn't true they go commit suicide.
[03:53:55.985 --> 03:53:56.565]  Don't do that.
[03:53:56.625 --> 03:53:57.626]  Stand up and say it's wrong.
[03:53:58.326 --> 03:53:59.547]  Stand up and fight back but see
[03:54:02.697 --> 03:54:03.859]  You have to engage evil.
[03:54:05.341 --> 03:54:05.982]  You have to do it.
[03:54:06.984 --> 03:54:07.585]  Or there's no hope.
[03:54:09.208 --> 03:54:12.873]  And all these people that are cut off from God by their own actions...
[03:54:14.670 --> 03:54:20.471]  Cut off from just, people say, Jones is new agey when he says, tune into the universe, tune into God.
[03:54:20.612 --> 03:54:21.912]  God made the universe.
[03:54:22.632 --> 03:54:25.153]  God is the universe and more and beyond that.
[03:54:25.173 --> 03:54:34.295]  But the point is, I'm just saying, transcend the globalists and their red carpets and crap, and look at the night sky, look at the moon, look at the creation, look at the wind, the smell of the flowers, all of it.
[03:54:34.335 --> 03:54:37.896]  It's like, that's God manifesting through art.
[03:54:40.376 --> 03:54:46.718]  And just realize that you know God's there, and you know the enemy has fallen, and you don't have to be afraid anymore.
[03:54:46.738 --> 03:54:53.301]  The only thing you've got to be afraid of is not being with God.
[03:54:53.541 --> 03:55:01.584]  And if you turn yourself over to God, you're not going to be at some church posing how high and mighty you are for everybody.
[03:55:03.124 --> 03:55:04.485]  You're going to be trying to engage evil.
[03:55:06.125 --> 03:55:07.966]  You're going to ever be seeking it out to destroy it.
[03:55:09.531 --> 03:55:28.862]  Ever moving against it, ever obsessed with exposing it, and ever frustrated that you can't do better because there's such a great example of God right there, that you feel like you're not doing a good enough job because you want to not impress God, you want to get to where God is.
[03:55:28.922 --> 03:55:35.106]  You want to get closer to God, but then you see how bad you are, and then you see the really evil people, and it's like, is that a joke?
[03:55:36.175 --> 03:55:39.336]  You want to kidnap kids and torture them to death?
[03:55:39.376 --> 03:55:42.898]  You're like, you don't even blame God if he blows the whole planet up.
[03:55:42.918 --> 03:55:46.219]  You're just like, but I, I hope we can fix it because I got children.
[03:55:46.239 --> 03:55:49.901]  But then I just go, whatever you got to do.
[03:55:49.921 --> 03:55:57.464]  You come to that point, you come to that point where you're just like, I'm conscious.
[03:55:57.484 --> 03:55:58.384]  I was given all this.
[03:55:58.444 --> 03:55:59.845]  I'm not asking God for anything.
[03:56:01.016 --> 03:56:02.777]  I cannot even ask God for things.
[03:56:03.078 --> 03:56:04.879]  I try to pray and ask for things.
[03:56:05.559 --> 03:56:07.140]  And when I start praying, I get even closer to God.
[03:56:07.200 --> 03:56:12.784]  I'm like, whoa, I can't even ask God.
[03:56:16.967 --> 03:56:19.069]  And God says, stop worrying about what the enemy says.
[03:56:19.529 --> 03:56:20.530]  Stop being worldly.
[03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:21.090]  Attack.
[03:56:21.471 --> 03:56:22.031]  Expose them.
[03:56:22.571 --> 03:56:23.292]  Defend the children.
[03:56:23.452 --> 03:56:23.812]  Attack.
[03:56:24.152 --> 03:56:24.513]  Attack.
[03:56:24.753 --> 03:56:25.113]  Attack.
[03:56:25.293 --> 03:56:25.674]  Attack.
[03:56:25.834 --> 03:56:26.134]  Attack.
[03:56:28.746 --> 03:56:35.212]  But I have prayed for decades that God would, like, cleanse me of my evil and just empower me to take on the enemy.
[03:56:35.352 --> 03:56:37.614]  And the crazy part is, it's happening.
[03:56:38.394 --> 03:56:41.457]  That's what's so amazing, is that this is real.
[03:56:42.177 --> 03:56:43.619]  This isn't some simulation.
[03:56:43.639 --> 03:56:44.720]  This isn't some game.
[03:56:45.280 --> 03:56:45.981]  This is real.
[03:56:46.061 --> 03:56:47.762]  God is all-powerful!
[03:56:48.143 --> 03:56:49.043]  God is real!
[03:56:50.069 --> 03:56:52.811]  And the sadists and the Satanists tell you, well then he's a sadist!
[03:56:53.632 --> 03:56:55.173]  Because he did all this bad!
[03:56:55.473 --> 03:56:58.716]  God didn't do anything but give us free will!
[03:56:59.837 --> 03:57:01.578]  That's respect God gave us!
[03:57:05.761 --> 03:57:09.344]  God gave Lucifer free will, as a test.
[03:57:10.165 --> 03:57:12.487]  And Lucifer turned against him, just like that.
[03:57:15.037 --> 03:57:23.342]  And played games with the other entities to manipulate them until they said, we'll create our own dimension.
[03:57:23.762 --> 03:57:24.183]  And you know what?
[03:57:24.223 --> 03:57:25.343]  Your dimension sucks.
[03:57:26.944 --> 03:57:28.605]  So you go be part of your dimension.
[03:57:29.026 --> 03:57:30.146]  I want this dimension.
[03:57:31.747 --> 03:57:40.152]  And quite frankly, I just want to get wind up to take as many people as I can to that dimension.
[03:57:40.532 --> 03:57:41.753]  You going to take people where you're going?
[03:57:42.434 --> 03:57:44.095]  I want out of this one away from you.
[03:57:54.437 --> 03:57:54.817]  Carnivore.
[03:57:54.837 --> 03:57:56.478]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[03:57:56.939 --> 03:57:57.819]  All very affordable.
[03:57:58.479 --> 03:57:59.660]  33% off, out of the gate.
[03:57:59.780 --> 03:58:02.562]  The thing I am so ultra excited about.
[03:58:02.582 --> 03:58:04.603]  Because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[03:58:04.623 --> 03:58:10.587]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[03:58:10.787 --> 03:58:15.449]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:18.331]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and stomachaches.
[03:58:18.411 --> 03:58:20.833]  And as you get older, you can't eat rich foods you could eat before.
[03:58:21.173 --> 03:58:23.134]  It's because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[03:58:23.355 --> 03:58:25.144]  This is next level beyond probiotic.
[03:58:25.747 --> 03:58:26.934]  I've been taking this for two months.
[03:58:28.044 --> 03:58:31.746]  As it was getting prepared, it was getting ready, and man, I'm telling you, it is incredible.
[03:58:31.987 --> 03:58:34.388]  Normally, you eat a big steak for a day or two, you're tired.
[03:58:34.908 --> 03:58:38.111]  Doesn't happen anymore with this, and never have any issues.
[03:58:38.131 --> 03:58:42.914]  You know, ate that 20-ounce rib-eye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[03:58:42.954 --> 03:58:45.956]  It's called Carnivorbe Digestive Enzymes.
[03:58:46.156 --> 03:58:50.539]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.
[03:58:50.879 --> 03:58:52.420]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[03:58:52.800 --> 03:58:57.283]  People that are on these ketosis diets, and Atkins type diets, and paleo diets,
[03:58:58.089 --> 03:58:59.644]  It's just amazing made in the USA
