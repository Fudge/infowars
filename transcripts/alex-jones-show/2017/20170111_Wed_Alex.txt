[00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.132]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:28.601]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:34.163]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:35.665]  This is January 11th, 2017.
[00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.346]  It's an amazing day.
[00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:38.607]  We've had a lot of news breaking.
[00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:41.690]  Of course, Donald Trump having his first press conference in six months.
[00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:50.077]  And just hours before the press conference, we had this massive new fake news attack coming from hardcore Hillary supporters, BuzzFeed.
[00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:50.537]  I mean, we got...
[00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:57.479]  Tweets from the BuzzFeed editors all last night, one after the other, talking about how they're in absolute fear.
[00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.760]  So, this is something that is developing.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.200]  Alex Jones is on the road.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.041]  He wanted to call in with this report.
[00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.181]  We've got Alex on the line right now.
[00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:05.501]  Alex?
[00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.721]  That's right, I'll be co-hosting with you here, David.
[00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.222]  I'm sorry I didn't relay that message to you.
[00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:13.262]  Wow, there is so much to break down here, so much to go over.
[00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:20.824]  I mean, it is simply mind-blowing that I saw this story over a day ago about the golden showers.
[00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.048]  I knew it was pure, absolute bull the minute I saw it.
[00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:25.309]  And I just said, you know what?
[00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.210]  I'm going to leave it alone.
[00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:33.059]  I'm going to see if mainstream media picks this up, which I'm sure they would, and then see where it went from there with BuzzFeed and the rest of them.
[00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.446]  And of course, it was tailor-made disinformation, just like their CIA report.
[00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:49.193]  I mean, the CIA report of last week admittedly was just a bunch of examples of where RT had said bad things about Hillary Clinton in the last four years.
[00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:50.294]  This was their hack.
[00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.097]  It was just simple political involvement.
[00:01:56.312 --> 00:02:04.638]  By the Russians having political views on something like Peaceful America, this is their big, much-to-do-about-nothing bombshell information.
[00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.540]  But now, they've really bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.321]  With MSM, as you know,
[00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:19.119]  Running with the claims, unsubstantiated, that the President is in these parties being urinated on, basically.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:32.112]  Now, meanwhile, we have Bill Clinton flying around with Jerry Epstein, the convicted pedophile, more than now 20 times, who went to a pedophile island, who flew to an island with a sheik,
[00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:32.932]  We're good.
[00:02:53.428 --> 00:03:02.476]  Girl, that's the one he just got caught for in Hollywood, defending him and trying to get his conviction of child rape overturned so he could come here.
[00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:12.039]  From France, battling his extradition, and you've got Meryl Streep standing up with standing ovations for an admitted child rapist.
[00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:18.363]  I'm expecting media matters to come out and say that Roman Polanski never raped a 13-year-old girl, anally.
[00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:25.468]  So this is what we're dealing with, is people with a real history of obsession with sexual perversion.
[00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:26.388]  No.
[00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.391]  Donald Trump has an obsession with beautiful, perfect ten women.
[00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.892]  And I don't think anybody's going to say that's a crime.
[00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:37.555]  He's never claimed to be, you know, Mr. Perfect, but he's been married several times.
[00:03:37.855 --> 00:03:38.815]  He has a great family.
[00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:42.157]  The point is, is that this is how desperate they are, David.
[00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:45.039]  So I'm going to be here with you off and on a little bit in the first hour.
[00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.240]  We've got the full press conference of Trump.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.261]  It's still ongoing.
[00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:50.242]  We're going to be hearing some excerpts of that.
[00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.904]  Again, he's come out and said this is absolute, total bull.
[00:03:55.024 --> 00:03:56.825]  Spicer's come out and said it's total bull.
[00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:59.426]  Priebus has said it's 100% manufactured.
[00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:08.429]  But notice for the first day, David, they were absolutely celebrating, celebrating in rapture that they had Donald Trump.
[00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:09.869]  A secret report.
[00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.930]  Why, this is why Trump didn't want a war with the Russians.
[00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:14.031]  This is why.
[00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:18.212]  Because, because they had pee-pee videos of the president.
[00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.573]  Totally insane.
[00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:19.793]  No.
[00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:27.680]  Trump's being advised by a bunch of top generals who are not pro-Russia, who are not anti-Russia, but who are actually pro-America.
[00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:35.889]  And it's not in our interest to pick on Russia when Russia is not in an expansive, expanding role right now, and China is.
[00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:42.072]  We should be working with Russia, Japan, and others to contain China.
[00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:56.359]  And that is indeed what's happening right now is real geopolitical activity to also not just contain communist China that's expanding, but to contain radical orthodox Islam that is openly expanding as everybody can publicly see.
[00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.200]  So what we're seeing is real national sovereignty.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.242]  We're seeing a president who's going to be in there in nine days now.
[00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:06.495]  Actually doing things that are in the national interest of this country, David.
[00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:07.929]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:11.752]  And of course, one of the things that he talked about in the press conference... Wars are not cheap.
[00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:16.176]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.799]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:21.400]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.881]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:30.308]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:34.992]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:44.599]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:57.309]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.250]  We apply to the prize we bring.
[00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:06.679]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.625]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:12.906]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:15.369]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.351]  I think so.
[00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:35.254]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:36.656]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:06:36.676 --> 00:06:38.317]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:38.938]  I was in great shape.
[00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.059]  I was dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.184]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:47.006]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:49.608]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:54.753]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:58.116]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know
[00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:05.203]  DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:05.723]  170-plus studies.
[00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:06.744]  We can make claims on this.
[00:07:06.764 --> 00:07:12.830]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:15.452]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:16.293]  I forget to take it.
[00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:17.234]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:19.136]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[00:07:19.216 --> 00:07:21.398]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:22.439]  Well, guess what?
[00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.720]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.661]  It's discounted.
[00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:27.963]  Now in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:32.427]  A lot of the products we have left, we still have some supplies of and will sell out soon.
[00:07:32.707 --> 00:07:34.708]  But I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:39.432]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.253]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.

[00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:44.495]  20% off.
[00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:45.816]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:47.756]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:49.376]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid.
[00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:50.857]  I love taking it every day.
[00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:51.057]  20% off.
[00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:52.537]  Prostate Guard, 20% off.
[00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:55.058]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.599]  You are literally energizing this operation against the global assault on us.
[00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:07.621]  Again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:08.901]  Make our bodies great again.
[00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:14.398]  We are on the march.
[00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:17.224]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:21.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.223]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this January 11th, 2017.
[00:08:28.783 --> 00:08:31.666]  I'm David Knight and of course today we had the press conference.
[00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:34.249]  It was scheduled first one in six months by Donald Trump.
[00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:38.613]  They were going to talk about what Donald Trump is going to do with conflict of interest and they did talk about that.
[00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:39.734]  We're going to give you some clips of that.
[00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:45.440]  But then of course BuzzFeed dumped this trash just hours before the press conference.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.402]  Joining us now is Alex Jones.
[00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:48.363]  Comment on what's going on.
[00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.235]  That's right, David, and again, you're going to be hosting the show today, doing a great job.
[00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:56.120]  I obviously will be popping in live and also filing some reports.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.690]  You know, I saw this BuzzFeed thing yesterday, and I was going to comment on it, but I just knew it was going to come out that it was all false.
[00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.791]  I wanted to wait and see.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.720]  What's going on?
[00:09:27.805 --> 00:09:31.707]  An expert on computers is going to be joining us to break down the Russia report.
[00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:37.289]  What it's like in the age of the internet when these disinfo pieces can be put out and more.
[00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:49.294]  But notice it's the mainstream media again running with a ridiculous, easily debunkable story that they claim was part of some secret CIA report.
[00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:58.526]  That the President has been blackmailed by the Russians because they have video of him with women urinating on each other.
[00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:04.029]  Now, again, I'm sorry to have to talk about that on air, but that's what's being put in the news, so we have to cover it.
[00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:13.014]  It is Jerry Epstein of the Lolita Express and the Clintons that are clearly involved in the entire pedophile network.
[00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:25.920]  It is the Clintons that are clearly involved with the whole Hollywood elite and the Roman Polanskis and the Meryl Streeps who apologize for pedophilia and who basically champion it.
[00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:28.922]  This is the group that is into all this.
[00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:29.602]  We know that.
[00:10:29.682 --> 00:10:33.725]  It comes out over and over and over and over again that this satanic
[00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:35.354]  I don't know.
[00:10:55.581 --> 00:11:10.765]  In a room with prostitutes doing disgusting things, when meanwhile, it's a perfect metaphor, the globalists, as I've said many times, are marking their territory and are doing this to us, the American people, in an act of control and domination.
[00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:19.208]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, Trump comes out with his press conference the day before, they drop all this disinfo out, and they don't even care
[00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:29.742]  That they're known liars in their vitriol to try to bring Trump down with only nine days left until he's in office.
[00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:35.467]  Now, I've told people I'm on vacation with my family, but that's become a whole other conspiracy.
[00:11:35.827 --> 00:11:37.728]  Even if I leave for a week, I'll be back next week.
[00:11:38.609 --> 00:11:40.991]  But regardless, I'm doing a work vacation.
[00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:44.254]  But just while I'm out here,
[00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:51.546]  In America, talking and meeting with people, everybody I talk to basically is against political correctness now, almost everybody.
[00:11:51.927 --> 00:11:55.747]  There is a total awakening taking place, and that's why they're so scared.
[00:11:55.787 --> 00:12:05.570]  We talk a lot about that, David, but again, we have to ask ourselves, why would MSM, caught lying, caught putting out fake news, only intensify the fake news?
[00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.590]  Because they know
[00:12:07.663 --> 00:12:08.544]  They're out of ammo.
[00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:09.965]  They know they're discredited.
[00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:12.786]  They know the people are starting to really wake up to them.
[00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:33.139]  So they're simply trying to do a Hail Mary and hope that something sticks, hopes that something gets picked up by the public, that the public, even though we only believe one out of 20 lies, that finally something works, finally something begins to bring down Donald Trump.
[00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:36.321]  But the good news is, it's up on Infoworks.com right now.
[00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.971]  The President of Hungary is moving to kick out the George Soros Foundation from his country.
[00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:49.014]  All over the world, Soros crime networks, globalist crime networks are being exposed and being thrown out of nation states.
[00:12:49.674 --> 00:12:53.215]  As we identify the globalist tentacles of this Hydra,
[00:12:53.755 --> 00:12:54.256]  We're good to go.
[00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:24.165]  Their total organization and their total focus and their total operating in the dark with no one even resisting them is coming to an end right now.
[00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:29.068]  So I want to go to the intro of this press conference with Spicer and then
[00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:33.925]  With Pence and then with Trump, where most of the meat gets said.
[00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:37.407]  We're going to have excerpts, as I said, throughout the next four hours.
[00:13:37.447 --> 00:13:38.628]  David has some big guests today.
[00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:40.128]  But David, that's my take on this.
[00:13:40.148 --> 00:13:40.749]  What's your take?
[00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:49.333]  Well, Alex, I think when we look at Chuckie Schumer, this previous fake news that we had about the Russian hack, and we're going to talk to John McAfee later in the show about that.
[00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:54.211]  Chuck Schumer said, you better be careful about talking about intelligence services.
[00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.472]  They have a way of making you pay for this.
[00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:58.334]  I think that that's what's really behind this.
[00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:02.677]  When we look at the sources, of course, we've got CNN and BuzzFeed that are the direct sources.
[00:14:03.097 --> 00:14:05.298]  But I think that there's more to this than that.
[00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:11.783]  And one of the things that came out today, Alex, that we want to talk about later in the show as well, is the fact that Robert Kennedy, RFK Jr.,
[00:14:14.028 --> 00:14:17.471]  Has been appointed to a vaccine commission by Donald Trump.
[00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:26.298]  And of course, both Robert Kennedy and Donald Trump have spoken about concerns about the safety and the efficacy of vaccines.
[00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:29.541]  I think these types of things, the vaccine issues.
[00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:34.062]  Calling them out on the missing 28 pages of the 9-11 report and so many other things.
[00:14:34.502 --> 00:14:36.103]  They can't control Donald Trump.
[00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:37.343]  They're very much afraid of him.
[00:14:37.603 --> 00:14:39.144]  He comes out against the establishment.
[00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:43.565]  That and the fact that he understands this fake news from the CIA.
[00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:44.545]  He's not being fooled by this.
[00:14:44.865 --> 00:14:48.306]  He's not fooled by the intelligence reports, so-called reports.
[00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.667]  So I think a lot of that is the basis of that.
[00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:51.947]  But we're going to take a look at the sources.
[00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.307]  We're going to look at the organizations.
[00:14:53.328 --> 00:14:54.828]  We're going to look at the timing later on.
[00:14:55.822 --> 00:14:56.302]  Well, that's right.
[00:14:56.322 --> 00:14:58.303]  I mean, let's get into RFK Jr.
[00:14:58.963 --> 00:15:01.124]  He's bad on issues like guns.
[00:15:01.184 --> 00:15:02.205]  He's bad on things like that.
[00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:04.466]  But he's had family that's been hurt by vaccines.
[00:15:04.966 --> 00:15:06.006]  He knows about the dangers.
[00:15:06.046 --> 00:15:07.067]  He's been on the show before.
[00:15:07.087 --> 00:15:12.529]  And, you know, I know he met with Trump privately and Trump said, yes, I'm probably going to put you on a commission.
[00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:13.630]  I've got to get in first.
[00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.731]  And he basically told RFK Jr.
[00:15:16.811 --> 00:15:18.072]  do not talk about this.
[00:15:18.732 --> 00:15:19.872]  Well, RFK Jr.
[00:15:20.413 --> 00:15:21.253]  shot his mouth off.
[00:15:22.302 --> 00:15:24.304]  And so Trump came out and said, yes, we did talk.
[00:15:24.764 --> 00:15:25.825]  Yes, we're planning something.
[00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.406]  It's not done yet.
[00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:36.073]  So again, RFK, I'm not trying to be mean here, but when the president literally meets with people behind the scenes and battle plans, they have to keep their mouths shut.
[00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:37.595]  We're trying to take the country back.
[00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:38.335]  This is not a game.
[00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:39.016]  It's not a joke.
[00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:43.740]  I mean, look, folks, Trump is behind the scenes planning the total return of the Republic.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.444]  And again, I'm not at liberty to get into this, so I'm just going to drop it right here.
[00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.292]  I don't get this from Trump.
[00:15:52.312 --> 00:15:53.692]  I get this from multiple other sources.
[00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:58.655]  This is very, very personal for Trump on the vaccines, okay?
[00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.136]  So seeing is believing.
[00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:02.198]  There's a reason Trump's so awake.
[00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:09.182]  And again, I'm not at liberty to get to the rest of it, but just imagine the radio shows he listens to every day.
[00:16:09.862 --> 00:16:14.045]  Imagine what Donald Trump tunes into at about midnight every night.
[00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:26.891]  And imagine what Donald Trump's listening to and imagine how smart he is and his 70 years of research and knowledge when he tunes into shows that are also obsessed with facts and knowledge.
[00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:28.672]  It all starts to click.
[00:16:29.112 --> 00:16:31.693]  It's not just us that are going through a quickening of awakening.
[00:16:32.073 --> 00:16:37.636]  It's other people that are going through a quickening as well, like Donald Trump.
[00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:39.377]  And so let me tell you what Donald Trump wants.
[00:16:39.777 --> 00:16:40.778]  He wants the return of men.
[00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:50.622]  The return of leadership, the return of the family, the return of good medicine, the return of sovereignty, the return of people having savings.
[00:16:51.522 --> 00:16:55.544]  Across the board, Trump is dead on.
[00:16:55.584 --> 00:16:56.805]  He's such an old timer, though.
[00:16:57.345 --> 00:17:03.948]  He isn't really up on non-GMO and stuff as his wife is, his daughter is, so that's the good news.
[00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:11.852]  Also, in this press conference today, and there's so many clips, he goes, you've got to really watch it today with the internet.
[00:17:11.892 --> 00:17:13.893]  There's microphones inside everything.
[00:17:13.913 --> 00:17:16.274]  There's microphones inside your appliances.
[00:17:16.294 --> 00:17:17.375]  There's cameras everywhere.
[00:17:17.395 --> 00:17:19.336]  Of course, the media's going to call him crazy.
[00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:22.798]  Petraeus, four years ago, said, your washing machine's listening to you.
[00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:24.779]  I told people that 20 years ago.
[00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.400]  Well, I was reading it in MIT quarterly.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.001]  I mean, they said this.
[00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:29.822]  It's not like I
[00:17:30.812 --> 00:17:33.275]  Made up the Internet of Things or SmartDust.
[00:17:33.295 --> 00:17:34.176]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:36.958]  So this is such an amazing time to be alive.
[00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:38.360]  It's very, very positive.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.502]  But David, I'm going to skip this break so we have more time.
[00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:51.208]  I want to go back to you, because I've been listening to you while I took off some time, while I did some whale watching with the family and things I've always wanted to do.
[00:17:51.228 --> 00:17:59.189]  I've been listening to you, and I'm not just kissing your butt, the amazing job you and the crew have been doing, and just really laying out the facts.
[00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:09.571]  I really want your view on this, because I was intrigued by what you just mentioned, how CNN and BuzzFeed quarterbacked the release of this obvious disinfo so gleefully.
[00:18:10.271 --> 00:18:10.792]  I don't think so.
[00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.066]  Trump went on Larry King!
[00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:29.407]  Oh my gosh!
[00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:32.628]  I mean, every news channel was attacking Trump.
[00:18:32.709 --> 00:18:33.589]  Every commentator.
[00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:34.550]  Hollywood.
[00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:35.910]  Foreign governments.
[00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.591]  Foreign leaders.
[00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:40.493]  The whole world ganged up on America and told us we couldn't have Trump.
[00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:42.414]  We said, no, we do want Trump.
[00:18:42.434 --> 00:18:43.394]  We want nationalism.
[00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.235]  We want a change.
[00:18:44.535 --> 00:18:48.637]  And then they have the nerd turn around and say that foreign powers intervened.
[00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:50.098]  Little bitty Russia.
[00:18:50.298 --> 00:18:51.199]  And by little bitty, I mean
[00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:54.449]  Their GDP is that of Italy.
[00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.252]  They're strong, smart, scientific people, but let's face it, Russia's been through 80 years of hell.
[00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:03.915]  Russia is a joke when it comes to manipulating the United States.
[00:19:04.015 --> 00:19:05.616]  This is absolute bull.
[00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:14.461]  But it wasn't a joke to see all these world powers, all these governments, all these big combines, all the big banks, all the big media, everybody, the Pope,
[00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.604]  Told Catholics, you know, to vote against Trump.
[00:19:17.644 --> 00:19:18.145]  Didn't happen.
[00:19:18.565 --> 00:19:20.527]  I mean, record number of Hispanics voted for Trump.
[00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:21.668]  Record number of blacks voted.
[00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:23.130]  Record number of women voted.
[00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.813]  They are, 35% of Hispanics voted for Trump.
[00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.835]  45% of women voted for Trump.
[00:19:28.115 --> 00:19:30.738]  And that's even with them stealing states and skewing numbers.
[00:19:30.758 --> 00:19:33.220]  The word is, it was even higher, David.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.604]  It was like 42% Hispanic, is what internal polls show.
[00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.024]  It was 50%.
[00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.066]  90% women internal polls show, exit polls show.
[00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:42.767]  That's why we know they stole five states.
[00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:49.650]  That's why they're in panic, because the minorities are not smoking the brainwashing dope anymore, and are breaking free.
[00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.592]  The only people that aren't are all the weird, kind of like, white savior brainwash minions.
[00:19:55.732 --> 00:19:57.313]  I mean, let's just say it.
[00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:01.594]  Who's doubling down is weird, weird brainwash leftist white people.
[00:20:01.854 --> 00:20:06.116]  And they have gone into a total bunker mentality of insanity.
[00:20:06.736 --> 00:20:07.077]  We're good.
[00:20:07.097 --> 00:20:07.457]  Alex, help me.
[00:20:23.049 --> 00:20:35.742]  Well you know it's interesting Alex because you had CNN and you had BuzzFeed come out with this at this time and we've had news organizations that are very leftist that have not been fair in the past that have supported Hillary and made a lot of unfair accusations about Donald Trump.
[00:20:35.942 --> 00:20:41.048]  People like the New York Times heaping scorn on BuzzFeed and CNN for running with this story.
[00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:42.029]  Mika Brzezinski!
[00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:42.769]  Doing that.
[00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:48.515]  People who are not willing to burn down their leftist news organizations totally for the sake of the CIA have come out.
[00:20:48.595 --> 00:20:50.938]  Even Mother Jones, which is an opinion journal.
[00:20:50.978 --> 00:20:54.041]  I mean, they're not, they offer their opinions out there and they're leftists.
[00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:55.742]  I said, we're not going to run with something like this.
[00:20:55.943 --> 00:21:00.828]  There was a Politico reporter, Alex, who had been fired even from Politico as
[00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:11.135]  Skewed as Politico is, she was fired from Politico because she floated this story about Donald Trump allegedly having sex with his daughter and they said, come on, that's way beyond the pale.
[00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:15.798]  They fired her from Politico and even she said she would not run with this BuzzFeed story.
[00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:25.744]  So you've got BuzzFeed, you've got CNN that are coming out there and of course Jake Tapper who has basically just burned his reputation down like the former CBS News anchor
[00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:27.466]  Yeah, Dan Rather.
[00:21:45.948 --> 00:21:47.430]  Trump took the first question about this.
[00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:53.676]  He said, look, I tell my people, be very careful when you're traveling, especially when you're going to foreign countries or a country like Russia.
[00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:55.518]  He said, they've got cameras everywhere.
[00:21:55.878 --> 00:21:59.262]  So don't do anything that you don't want to have on camera.
[00:21:59.702 --> 00:22:01.404]  And even before this happened,
[00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:09.165]  In response to the previous fake news that they put out about Russian hacking, he said to reporters, don't trust computers.
[00:22:09.265 --> 00:22:10.326]  Computers are not safe.
[00:22:10.366 --> 00:22:14.826]  If you've got anything important, you write it down on a piece of paper and you give it to a courier to have it hand-delivered.
[00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.847]  So Donald Trump isn't an idiot.
[00:22:17.147 --> 00:22:20.647]  You have to be an idiot to do what he did, what they're accusing him of doing.
[00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:28.569]  Donald Trump, until this year, or I guess last year now, didn't even have computers in his main office area.
[00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:37.157]  And I'm not going to get into the details, but reportedly leaves phones out in drawers, out in the foyer area.
[00:22:37.518 --> 00:22:39.439]  So in a way, people say, oh, he's not high-tech.
[00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:54.107]  No, in a way, he's so anti-tech, he does exactly what real spies and people do, is he compartmentalizes all the electronics and keeps them away from him, and everything is done on paper, which is actually what they wish presidents would really do.
[00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:58.070]  So isn't it crazy that just instinctively, Trump already operates
[00:22:58.849 --> 00:23:00.170]  The way a president should operate?
[00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:14.215]  I mean, they keep saying that he doesn't have the background or the pedigree or the skill to be president, as if some community organizer nobody that never did anything could run the country and go on vacation four months out of the year.
[00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:20.457]  Meanwhile, Trump is a total workhorse who already is bringing back over $100 million worth of jobs.
[00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:22.018]  Ford, Chrysler.
[00:23:22.853 --> 00:23:23.754]  The list goes on and on.
[00:23:23.954 --> 00:23:30.658]  I mean, I don't want to go into a whole diatribe about how Trump's already been presidential, how he's already helped the economy more than Obama did in eight years.
[00:23:31.018 --> 00:23:36.422]  That's not hard to do because Obama was trying to consolidate the economy and only give money to his friends.
[00:23:36.742 --> 00:23:41.265]  That's what globalism is, is a giant consolidation system, David.
[00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:43.766]  Now, I know we're coming up on the break in a little while.
[00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:50.611]  I want to go ahead and start airing this press conference from the beginning with Spicer, then with Pence.
[00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:54.534]  Then with Trump and David and I will intersperse during this hour.
[00:23:54.714 --> 00:23:58.497]  But just briefly, David, you don't just have McAfee joining you coming up.
[00:23:58.557 --> 00:23:59.177]  Tell us who else.
[00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:02.700]  I've got Craig Richardson from E&E organization.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.182]  They're an energy and environment legal organization.
[00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:11.707]  He's going to comment on Donald Trump's interior and energy picks as they were coming up this week in confirmation hearings.
[00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:17.792]  They're very happy with what they see because these are people who have pushed for a free market, who have pushed for America
[00:24:18.092 --> 00:24:28.995]  To be able to develop its energy resources, because energy is not only a financial necessity, but it actually affects not just the quality of your life, but the duration of your life, your life expectancy.
[00:24:29.015 --> 00:24:31.676]  So that's a very important thing when you look at these energy and interior picks.
[00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:36.057]  Let me add something to that, and then we'll start going to the press conference, and then come back from break and play more.
[00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:48.397]  For years, when I would have people on exposing the fact that shutting off our coal plants was hurting our country, I would get emails and letters, and the media would say, oh, he must work for big coal, or he must work for oil.
[00:24:48.937 --> 00:24:50.798]  Folks, I don't get any money from that.
[00:24:51.239 --> 00:25:04.367]  The point is, is that energy is everything, and if our energy is double or triple the price of China's, no one will have industry here if we've unfairly, from the beginning, been penalized on the basis of everything.
[00:25:04.907 --> 00:25:05.388]  Energy.
[00:25:05.408 --> 00:25:08.310]  I mean, children understand this watching cartoons.
[00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.672]  Why are the Decepticons here on Earth?
[00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:14.915]  To drain the Earth's core of its energy and create energon cubes.
[00:25:15.395 --> 00:25:16.356]  They have to have energy.
[00:25:16.677 --> 00:25:19.259]  That's the food of an industrial society.
[00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.941]  Why did all these other cultures dry up in the middle of the desert?
[00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:25.223]  Because it became a desert in North Africa.
[00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:32.089]  People had to move out of there because there was no longer the energy of the plants, of the fruit, of the animals that lived off the plants.
[00:25:32.969 --> 00:25:44.292]  And then humans eat the meat and get energy transferred through the plants, through the water, through the sunlight, into the animal, into the deer, into the gazelle, into the animal they're eating, into us, the humans.
[00:25:44.732 --> 00:25:45.713]  Everything is energy.
[00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:55.395]  This seems really simple to us, but we have to remember, they've dumbed down young people so much that many of them don't even understand these very, very simple equations.
[00:25:55.415 --> 00:25:58.516]  That's why sometimes it sounds like I'm talking to them like they're five years old.
[00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.817]  I'm not talking to our general audience like that.
[00:26:01.137 --> 00:26:01.877]  A lot of the public
[00:26:01.937 --> 00:26:06.520]  He doesn't even really know where meat comes from at the grocery store or where electricity comes from.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:15.206]  So the fact that America and Europe have been penalized for 20 years on our energy production as part of globalism is the key to so much.
[00:26:15.226 --> 00:26:18.209]  So I'm glad that David is going to be breaking some of that down.
[00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:20.050]  Let's go ahead and go to the start of the press conference.
[00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:24.973]  And there he is, the incoming White House press secretary.
[00:26:24.993 --> 00:26:25.434]  Let's listen in.
[00:26:26.374 --> 00:26:29.498]  After the President-Elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms.
[00:26:29.518 --> 00:26:40.633]  Sherry Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis, who structured the agreements pursuant to the President's business arrangements, and she will give brief remarks.
[00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:47.094]  Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night.
[00:26:47.874 --> 00:27:03.164]  It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the President-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.
[00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:10.190]  According to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report.
[00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:22.360]  The executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.
[00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:31.307]  The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.
[00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:35.470]  The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple.
[00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:43.094]  One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign.
[00:27:43.714 --> 00:27:47.856]  These three individuals, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Carter Page.
[00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:54.760]  Carter Page is an individual who the President-elect does not know, and was put on notice months ago by the campaign.
[00:27:56.044 --> 00:28:06.851]  Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement, and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September, did not leave or enter the United States during this time.
[00:28:07.451 --> 00:28:14.916]  We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question, and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.
[00:28:15.376 --> 00:28:17.678]  In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague.
[00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:27.677]  A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game.
[00:28:28.357 --> 00:28:31.599]  One report now suggests that apparently it's another Michael Cohen.
[00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:42.584]  For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and it's frankly shameful and disgraceful.
[00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.995]  With that, it is my honor to introduce the next Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence.
[00:28:57.462 --> 00:29:06.290]  We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States of America.
[00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:29.199]  I'm profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as Vice President of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:42.022]  Now, the President-Elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive, but as the chairman of the transition effort,
[00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:51.097]  I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring.
[00:29:51.817 --> 00:29:54.881]  To see the way he has brought together men and women... Alright, that's the beginning of the press conference.
[00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:57.643]  We're going to have some specific clips for you when we come back.
[00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:00.006]  We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.
[00:30:00.526 --> 00:30:02.128]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:05.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:12.726]  Just where does CNN find their news sources?
[00:30:12.806 --> 00:30:24.412]  If you recall, they first suggested that the Russians hacked the election to help get Donald Trump elected, and yesterday they're reporting now that intel chiefs are presenting Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.
[00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:34.677]  What they're insinuating, directly quoting here from their website, classified documents presented last week, that President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have
[00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:35.597]  We're good.
[00:30:52.363 --> 00:31:04.849]  They're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took an extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing of documents was to make Donald Trump aware that such allegations involving him were circulating among their agencies.
[00:31:04.989 --> 00:31:06.250]  I can't make this up if I tried.
[00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.130]  I'm Margaret Hal reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:15.888]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:31:16.288 --> 00:31:19.150]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.694]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:31:25.114 --> 00:31:31.098]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:31:31.238 --> 00:31:34.360]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.961]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:40.304]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:31:40.504 --> 00:31:43.366]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:31:43.446 --> 00:31:45.028]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:31:45.108 --> 00:31:48.310]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.912]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:31:51.172 --> 00:31:52.153]  It's in powder form.
[00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:54.955]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:31:55.135 --> 00:31:55.716]  I take this.
[00:31:55.836 --> 00:31:57.517]  This is the product that I take.
[00:31:57.637 --> 00:31:59.619]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:32:00.439 --> 00:32:01.200]  We fight the Globals.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.080]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:16.088]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:32:16.628 --> 00:32:18.049]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:32:18.939 --> 00:32:20.819]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:27.000]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:35.562]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:32:35.582 --> 00:32:38.043]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.523]  This is the best system out there.
[00:32:39.783 --> 00:32:42.543]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:32:42.803 --> 00:32:43.544]  This is how it works.
[00:32:43.844 --> 00:32:45.284]  You order customized or
[00:32:46.384 --> 00:32:47.844]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:32:48.324 --> 00:32:51.485]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:32:51.785 --> 00:32:55.846]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:56.826]  You cannot lose.
[00:32:56.866 --> 00:32:57.966]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:05.008]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:09.289]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:33:24.445 --> 00:33:30.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are only nine days out from President 45 being inaugurated.
[00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.791]  David Knight is hosting the broadcast.
[00:33:31.932 --> 00:33:36.235]  I am joining you from the road, taking some very important time off with the family.
[00:33:36.656 --> 00:33:46.925]  But I've got to tell you, I've still been working about, I don't know, about five, six hours a day just dealing with administrative things and also trying to stay up to date on the news and information.
[00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:50.227]  I've also been on the phone
[00:33:51.128 --> 00:33:53.629]  Talking to folks high up in the resistance.
[00:33:53.689 --> 00:33:54.670]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.031]  And I'll tell you, that is the big difference here, isn't it?
[00:33:59.172 --> 00:34:02.333]  Just what Pence was just talking about for the press conference earlier, the Vice President.
[00:34:04.194 --> 00:34:05.474]  Donald Trump is on the job.
[00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:07.615]  18 to 20 hours a day.
[00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:15.089]  And Donald Trump, he's paying attention to the constituents and the American people.
[00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:17.651]  It is unbelievable how good he is.
[00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:20.773]  My gut said go with Trump, and I cannot believe how right it was.
[00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:22.194]  He is such a godsend.
[00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:27.697]  I don't want to sit here and gush over this anymore, but notice how all he's doing is delivering.
[00:34:28.478 --> 00:34:30.839]  And he's putting in a few people that have been at Goldman Sachs.
[00:34:30.979 --> 00:34:33.941]  Alex Stephen Bannon, who then left Goldman Sachs and exposed the whole thing.
[00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:35.989]  I mean, Goldman Sachs is king.
[00:34:36.029 --> 00:34:36.729]  It runs everything.
[00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:39.330]  Of course, if you've got top people, they're going to come from there.
[00:34:40.491 --> 00:34:43.812]  But the point is, is that he's reversing their whole program.
[00:34:45.093 --> 00:34:46.894]  They are completely panicking right now.
[00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:47.874]  They are so scared.
[00:34:47.894 --> 00:34:49.995]  So I'm going to go back to David Knight at more of the press conference.
[00:34:50.036 --> 00:34:53.617]  We've got some excise pieces that'll be ready towards the end of the hour.
[00:34:54.378 --> 00:35:02.802]  And then, of course, when McAfee's on, more clips coming up in the next hour with a perfect guest that David got on, McAfee, to break down the hacking, to break down the latest stuff.
[00:35:04.412 --> 00:35:10.857]  Getting back to what David was just talking about, I heard a Margaret Howell report during the break that was excellent.
[00:35:11.237 --> 00:35:14.500]  They claim that Trump is blackmailed by the Russians with no evidence.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:23.847]  When Hillary, for years, had a secret server in her bathroom that they know at least six foreign governments were accessing, she was using it as a dropbox.
[00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:31.813]  I was told this a year ago by high-level sources, and then also some of them came on the show, okay, and publicly said,
[00:35:32.995 --> 00:35:56.481]  The word is, she has plausible liability, it's still totally illegal, to put a server out that's wireless, that's open, and then to let the world know they can come and get on it, and then basically use the information however they wanted to, but for her to put it on the server, they had to then put money in her foundation.
[00:35:56.901 --> 00:36:00.562]  And that's why hundreds of countries were putting money into her foundation.
[00:36:01.477 --> 00:36:03.798]  Was because it was a giant payoff op.
[00:36:03.838 --> 00:36:04.758]  Now, we already know that.
[00:36:04.798 --> 00:36:05.799]  It's in the emails.
[00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:08.519]  And those are the emails she didn't delete.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.401]  Imagine the 30 plus thousand emails that were deleted.
[00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:15.702]  Imagine what's in those, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:15.802 --> 00:36:18.383]  It's everything under the sun.
[00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:33.040]  This is a true criminal enterprise, and just like a prison, it's gonna be full of different types of criminals, a legion of doom, Hillary's whole entourage, and the group she runs with, runs from bad to worse, to absolutely pure evil.
[00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:34.362]  So that's why...
[00:36:35.336 --> 00:36:37.977]  It's so over the top and that's why good people have a blind spot.
[00:36:38.717 --> 00:36:40.397]  I never get sick of sunsets.
[00:36:40.518 --> 00:36:42.418]  I never get sick of a good rib eye steak.
[00:36:42.858 --> 00:36:44.519]  I never get sick of a cold beer.
[00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:47.600]  I never get sick of a nice hike up a mountainside.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.341]  I never get sick of loving my family and hugging my children and just being a good person.
[00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:53.981]  Well, see?
[00:36:54.521 --> 00:36:55.842]  We're normal, okay?
[00:36:55.862 --> 00:36:56.522]  We're not perfect.
[00:36:56.902 --> 00:36:58.583]  In fact, we have guilt because we're good people.
[00:36:59.243 --> 00:37:00.083]  We have a conscience.
[00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:00.963]  They don't.
[00:37:01.603 --> 00:37:03.284]  And so we're blind to the enemy.
[00:37:04.512 --> 00:37:13.760]  That's why we have to force ourselves to study history because these evil people show up throughout history and build the same type of corrupt empires and the same type of systems.
[00:37:14.141 --> 00:37:19.466]  So when they accuse Trump with zero, not a zip evidence of being
[00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:22.420]  Compromised by the Russians with no proof.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.141]  Their proof is ExxonMobil did some oil drilling in the North Sea.
[00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:28.142]  Well, they better.
[00:37:28.322 --> 00:37:29.162]  Everybody else does.
[00:37:29.222 --> 00:37:32.603]  Of course, Russia has the most oil of anybody in the world.
[00:37:33.123 --> 00:37:34.323]  The United States is second.
[00:37:34.604 --> 00:37:35.584]  Saudi Arabia is third.
[00:37:35.604 --> 00:37:38.025]  I mean, ExxonMobil better be drilling there.
[00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:39.465]  Oh, what a horrible person!
[00:37:40.285 --> 00:37:42.126]  Bringing free market capitalism to Russia.
[00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.630]  That's their evidence.
[00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:45.810]  That's their evidence.
[00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:51.612]  Meanwhile, Hillary, $35 million for uranium to the Russians, on and on and on, secretly meeting with Putin.
[00:37:52.132 --> 00:37:52.632]  Remember that?
[00:37:53.052 --> 00:37:59.513]  Came out about two months before the election that she secretly met with Putin on at least two occasions.
[00:37:59.893 --> 00:38:04.274]  Hillary, I'm going to say that again, secretly met with Putin.
[00:38:04.874 --> 00:38:06.815]  Secretly met with Putin.
[00:38:07.295 --> 00:38:09.115]  Secretly met with Putin.
[00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:10.669]  There you go.
[00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.291]  Did Donald Trump ever meet Putin?
[00:38:12.351 --> 00:38:12.591]  No.
[00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:13.832]  Did he see a relationship with Putin?
[00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:14.092]  No.
[00:38:14.552 --> 00:38:16.774]  The point is we know a fraud when we see it.
[00:38:17.354 --> 00:38:30.323]  So now they put out this fake dossier that it turns out was floating around the internet for weeks if not months and that the CIA was passing it around wondering if it was real.
[00:38:31.417 --> 00:38:32.437]  Let me explain something, folks.
[00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:42.421]  The CIA people that fly into war-torn regions and the people that actually do stuff in the field are a very small percentage of the CIA now, or they call it teeth to tail, basically.
[00:38:43.341 --> 00:38:48.043]  Previously, with the CIA, you might have one or two people in support of someone in the field.
[00:38:48.683 --> 00:38:53.065]  Now, you might have 20 people in support of one person in the field.
[00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:56.326]  They've gone completely away.
[00:38:56.346 --> 00:38:58.247]  Of course, the military, it's like 1 to 12 right now.
[00:39:00.189 --> 00:39:06.693]  They've gotten away from what they call HUMET, and they've gone all into computers and digital this and digital that and a bunch of spying.
[00:39:07.233 --> 00:39:14.358]  All the CIA is, is a bunch of Ivy League nerds, okay, who got beat up in high school.
[00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:39.231]  Who have pocket protectors, and I'm not saying pocket protectors are bad, or the nerds are bad, I'm just saying, these are nerds that want to be tough guys, okay, on average, and they're liberals on average, and they're in there acting tough and acting like they're tough guys and acting like they're spies, when it's the military and the people that are doing all the killing, all the humet, all on the ground stuff, the CIA sits there and basically runs around making deals with the Saudi Arabians and getting paid off.
[00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:47.135]  They're a big group of compromised, paid-off globalists that have sold this country out, who've had diplomatic immunity, who've been above the law since 1947.
[00:39:47.235 --> 00:39:54.739]  And let me tell you, the CIA was bad in 1947 because you should never give some group above the law anonymity and all this power.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.440]  But imagine what it's like now in 2017.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.323]  It is an anti-American cesspit.
[00:40:01.743 --> 00:40:03.444]  Now, does that mean everybody in the CIA is bad?
[00:40:03.944 --> 00:40:04.705]  Absolutely not.
[00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:06.306]  There was a time when the CIA
[00:40:07.415 --> 00:40:11.559]  We're still recruiting, you know, basically the football captain.
[00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:11.939]  Okay.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:26.053]  There was a time where you had to have a square jaw and you had to be in combat for four or five years and you had to, you know, always take your orders and then get tears in your eyes when the Star Spangled Banner got played and all the rest of it before you got the CIA.
[00:40:26.513 --> 00:40:28.956]  It hasn't been that way in 20 years, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:29.256]  Okay.
[00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:31.318]  In fact, they don't want square jawed people in there now.
[00:40:31.798 --> 00:40:35.621]  What they want is a bunch of wimps and a bunch of politicos and a bunch of cowards, okay?
[00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:37.563]  I'm here to tell you right now, it's a joke.
[00:40:38.023 --> 00:40:53.755]  And all they do is, they run around with a bunch of disinformation, they run around with a bunch of garbage, they run around with a bunch of social engineering, approving Hollywood scripts, and propagandizing and just playing God over the American people.
[00:40:54.076 --> 00:40:55.337]  And because they're not real men,
[00:40:56.463 --> 00:40:58.705]  And because a lot of them are women that also have it out for men.
[00:40:59.325 --> 00:41:08.212]  This is all very anti-male situation, folks, because they're anti-strength, they're anti-individualism, they're anti-a threat that could ever rise up against them like is happening now.
[00:41:08.852 --> 00:41:13.776]  So their whole system is about weakening America because instinctively they hate strength.
[00:41:14.376 --> 00:41:16.218]  So you have to understand the enemy psychology.
[00:41:16.459 --> 00:41:27.891]  It's a foreign banking cartel that through Pratt House in 1921 set up a British intelligence arm that through OSS and the CIA had basically a foreign global corporate takeover of America.
[00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:30.480]  Now that's coming to an end.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:40.423]  They are openly trying to claim that Trump is blackmailed, or that Trump is an outsider, when they are the ones that are outsiders, and they are the ones that are using blackmail to take down and control this country.
[00:41:41.443 --> 00:41:51.267]  They also understand in their own white papers, like from the Clinton Foundation, that is the Clinton Library Foundation in Little Rock, that if we ever produce our own economy in America,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.500]  We're good to go.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.621]  And James McAvee and everybody else.
[00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:15.801]  John McAvee is coming up.
[00:42:16.201 --> 00:42:19.143]  DNA Force is 10% off right now.
[00:42:19.783 --> 00:42:22.965]  That has been out for, I guess, about two months.
[00:42:23.545 --> 00:42:26.726]  That's our amazing BioPQQ CoQ10 formula.
[00:42:27.066 --> 00:42:28.047]  The very best out there.
[00:42:28.707 --> 00:42:32.450]  Uh, and that's 10% off at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.593]  BioTruth Selenium, uh, from the mustard seed.
[00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.695]  The best, uh, selenium out there at a very, very low price.
[00:42:39.075 --> 00:42:40.176]  That is back in stock.
[00:42:40.577 --> 00:42:46.481]  Several other items that have been sold out for months are back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:42:47.062 --> 00:42:54.988]  Also, White House Globalist-run Soros-funded Media Matters came out and demonized, um,
[00:42:56.457 --> 00:42:58.158]  Info Wars and David Knight by name.
[00:42:58.178 --> 00:42:59.700]  In fact, I want to get David's take on this in a moment.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:09.407]  For daring, during the latest Islamic attack in Fort Lauderdale last week, to say, see, that's why we're selling body armor inserts for backpacks that are nanotech.
[00:43:09.907 --> 00:43:10.828]  Only folks that have this.
[00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:15.892]  That's why we're selling these vest systems that are less than the steel plate stuff.
[00:43:16.773 --> 00:43:18.874]  And weigh five times less on average.
[00:43:19.194 --> 00:43:22.235]  In fact, sometimes it weighs even less, depending on the system.
[00:43:22.636 --> 00:43:24.456]  And then they acted like we were bad saying that.
[00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:28.158]  That's like saying, wear shoes so you don't step on thorns.
[00:43:28.678 --> 00:43:32.860]  And then you're exploiting people saying don't step on thorns or brush your teeth.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.201]  You're exploiting people saying don't get cavities.
[00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:41.623]  I mean, of course we're selling body armor so that when there's a shooting or a crisis, people have more protection.
[00:43:41.643 --> 00:43:42.724]  That's like saying police
[00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:43.565]  We're good.
[00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:00.707]  But why do I have so much energy?
[00:44:01.067 --> 00:44:10.495]  Because epic history is happening now, and they want our energy low, they want us weak, they want us defeated, and the end of that system of defeat is now coming to a head.
[00:44:10.515 --> 00:44:24.168]  David, I want to get back to the press conference and the excerpts you've got in the next hour, but just getting into that whole area, I don't even know how to describe the illogic of where they demonize us for selling high-quality, exclusive nanotech, nanotube body armor,
[00:44:24.808 --> 00:44:25.509]  We're good to go.
[00:44:42.382 --> 00:44:51.695]  You say to them, Michael Moore has six bodyguards with guns, but says that I shouldn't be able to have a gun to protect myself if I'm just a middle class person or a poor person or a working class person.
[00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:52.957]  Where is the logic?
[00:44:52.997 --> 00:44:56.062]  And they just laugh at you because they're at war with logic, David.
[00:44:56.102 --> 00:44:58.185]  I mean, how do you break down this cosmology?
[00:44:58.325 --> 00:45:00.225]  Well, I didn't even know they'd attack me, Alex.
[00:45:00.285 --> 00:45:02.046]  I think it's kind of humorous, actually.
[00:45:02.646 --> 00:45:08.007]  Are they going to attack us for selling water filters, you know, because of what happened in Flint, Michigan?
[00:45:08.047 --> 00:45:10.227]  I mean, we were selling water filters a long time before that.
[00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:13.248]  But, you know, you really do need water filters to protect yourself.
[00:45:13.308 --> 00:45:18.469]  And Flint, Michigan is something that the Democrats went into very heavily from a political standpoint.
[00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:21.850]  They politicized that, tried to make it all about the Republicans or whatever.
[00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:22.530]  Look, it's about
[00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:30.916]  Pure water, and we've got Republicans and Democrats that are dumping garbage on us, not just on the news media, but they're dumping garbage into our water.
[00:45:31.076 --> 00:45:33.117]  So, water filters, it's the same thing.
[00:45:33.157 --> 00:45:49.809]  We talked to people about getting some protection for them, and you couldn't put the kind of body armor that used to be around with the heavy metal plates, you couldn't put that in your kid's backpack and have them walk around so they can have some protection in a gun-free zone where they're not going to let any adults have guns to protect
[00:45:50.649 --> 00:46:02.411]  David, I've been struggling to think of an analogy that was proper, and you just did it.
[00:46:02.892 --> 00:46:03.492]  Think about this.
[00:46:03.672 --> 00:46:13.494]  Almost every state has high levels of weed killer, Roundup, glyphosate, that they admit causes breast cancer, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, you name it.
[00:46:13.534 --> 00:46:14.614]  I mean, it's admitted.
[00:46:15.513 --> 00:46:18.014]  Almost every woman I run into above 40 has had breast cancer.
[00:46:18.034 --> 00:46:19.935]  I mean, it is just devastating my own family.
[00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:21.235]  I'm so angry about it.
[00:46:21.555 --> 00:46:22.855]  Well, what do I do for my daughters?
[00:46:22.975 --> 00:46:23.416]  And you bet.
[00:46:23.456 --> 00:46:24.956]  I went out and found the best water filters.
[00:46:24.976 --> 00:46:28.077]  I've got four or five companies that all have similar specs.
[00:46:28.777 --> 00:46:31.278]  And yes, we fund our operations selling water filters.
[00:46:31.698 --> 00:46:36.320]  Almost every state has high levels of glyphosate in the tap water, in the well water.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:52.423]  Is it exploitive to say, get a high quality water filtration system that totally cuts it out and hundreds of other bad things like fluoride, then that helps you, that helps us, it drives down medical bills and that way your daughter or your mother aren't having their breasts removed with a mastectomy.
[00:46:52.983 --> 00:47:05.345]  Again, again, to them it's exploitive that we're actually trying to give people a solution to mitigate the toxins that are at the base level of our biology, in our food chain, water.
[00:47:07.566 --> 00:47:07.946]  Exactly.
[00:47:08.006 --> 00:47:16.592]  It's like saying, it's like saying, oh, breast cancer is way up from glyphosate in the water table, and IQs are down from fluoride, so Jones sells water filters that cut it out.
[00:47:16.872 --> 00:47:18.012]  How exploitive is that?
[00:47:18.573 --> 00:47:22.475]  Yeah, you know, when they talked about it, they made it simply about lead.
[00:47:22.735 --> 00:47:24.396]  They made it simply about Republicans.
[00:47:24.696 --> 00:47:29.900]  But of course, they dump fluoride in, which has the same effect as lead does on IQ.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.020]  And there's a lot of other things.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.662]  You point out glyphosate, even if you're not on a city water supply.
[00:47:34.022 --> 00:47:46.988]  Even if you've got your own well out in the rural areas, you may be even more likely to get the glyphosate in there because there may be somebody that is using it on their nearby farm and it's going to get down into the water supply in that way.
[00:47:47.048 --> 00:47:54.291]  So people need to be aware that they can do certain things and they're not going to be able to constantly test their water to see what's in it.
[00:47:54.531 --> 00:47:54.971]  We're good to go.
[00:48:14.037 --> 00:48:26.044]  Everything they do is about not letting us have our own media, not letting us have our own schools, not letting us have our own food, not letting us have our own protection, not letting us have our own transportation, not letting us have our own courts, our own local sovereignty.
[00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:37.311]  Everything is about removing our local control and transferring it to centralized global systems, just like we saw in 1775, if you read the Declaration of Independence from July 4th.
[00:48:38.892 --> 00:48:39.373]  You know, Alex...
[00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:02.913]  I think we don't have, do we have the audio of this?
[00:49:02.953 --> 00:49:19.218]  The hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward.
[00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:28.822]  Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.
[00:49:29.887 --> 00:49:33.991]  You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press, and I always will be.
[00:49:35.012 --> 00:49:36.994]  But with freedom comes responsibility.
[00:49:38.055 --> 00:49:51.509]  And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news
[00:49:52.330 --> 00:50:01.893]  Can only be attributed to media bias, an attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.
[00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:08.815]  But today,
[00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:23.927]  We'll get back to real news, to real facts, and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again.
[00:50:23.947 --> 00:50:30.553]  And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.
[00:50:31.313 --> 00:50:36.078]  So it is my honor to introduce to all of you my friend,
[00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:41.127]  And the President-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.
[00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:50.931]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:51.011 --> 00:50:56.453]  It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis.
[00:50:56.513 --> 00:51:03.395]  I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences, and it's good to be with you.
[00:51:04.393 --> 00:51:31.134]  We stopped giving them because we're getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot
[00:51:32.145 --> 00:51:35.306]  On their record, if they in fact did that, a tremendous blot.
[00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:43.588]  Because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never been had, and it should certainly never have been released.
[00:51:44.248 --> 00:51:51.150]  But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations, for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years.
[00:51:52.529 --> 00:52:05.374]  A couple in particular, and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.
[00:52:06.394 --> 00:52:09.535]  So I just want to compliment many of the people in the room.
[00:52:09.876 --> 00:52:16.258]  I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were
[00:52:17.518 --> 00:52:29.766]  Some news organizations, with all that was just said, that were so professional, so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you.
[00:52:29.966 --> 00:52:30.306]  Okay?
[00:52:30.787 --> 00:52:31.167]  He knows.
[00:52:31.187 --> 00:52:32.968]  That was disinfo leaked by criminals, the CIA.
[00:52:33.028 --> 00:52:36.210]  I've had great news over the last couple of weeks.
[00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:41.053]  I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country.
[00:52:41.393 --> 00:52:44.135]  A lot of car companies are going to be moving in.
[00:52:44.155 --> 00:52:44.976]  We have other companies.
[00:52:45.016 --> 00:52:46.677]  Big news is going to be announced over the next
[00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:50.848]  A couple of weeks about companies that are building in the Midwest.
[00:52:50.868 --> 00:52:52.629]  You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler.
[00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:57.873]  Big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country.
[00:52:58.673 --> 00:53:09.901]  Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding very substantially an existing plant.
[00:53:09.941 --> 00:53:13.883]  See folks, there's been artificial controls here to keep us from having jobs.
[00:53:13.903 --> 00:53:14.444]  He's removing them.
[00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:20.750]  I hope that General Motors will be following, and I think they will be.
[00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.250]  I think a lot of people will be following.
[00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.191]  I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.
[00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:27.251]  We have to get our drug industry coming back.
[00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:29.071]  Our drug industry has been disastrous.
[00:53:29.091 --> 00:53:31.392]  I love how we bail out General Motors and it leaves.
[00:53:31.612 --> 00:53:35.453]  They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.
[00:53:36.353 --> 00:53:38.493]  And the other thing... 90% are made in China.
[00:53:38.633 --> 00:53:43.034]  ...bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:44.520]  Pharma.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.422]  Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists, and a lot of power.
[00:53:49.402 --> 00:53:51.723]  And there's very little bidding on drugs.
[00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:54.804]  We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world.
[00:53:54.824 --> 00:54:01.646]  We don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding, and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.
[00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:05.267]  And we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.
[00:54:06.028 --> 00:54:11.750]  I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35.
[00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:12.730]  You've been reading about it.
[00:54:13.816 --> 00:54:19.219]  And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.
[00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:20.119]  That's brilliant.
[00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:21.199]  I don't like that.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.101]  And the admirals have been fantastic.
[00:54:24.161 --> 00:54:25.661]  The generals have been fantastic.
[00:54:25.701 --> 00:54:26.902]  I've really gotten to know them well.
[00:54:28.022 --> 00:54:31.684]  And we're going to do some big things on the F-35 program.
[00:54:32.404 --> 00:54:34.625]  And perhaps the F-18 program.
[00:54:35.726 --> 00:54:37.587]  And we're going to get those costs way down.
[00:54:38.587 --> 00:54:40.428]  And we're going to get the plane to be even better.
[00:54:41.306 --> 00:54:44.087]  And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.
[00:54:45.068 --> 00:54:47.609]  So we've been very, very much involved and other things.
[00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:50.531]  We had Jack Ma.
[00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:54.032]  We had so many incredible people coming here.
[00:54:55.965 --> 00:54:58.106]  They're going to do tremendous things.
[00:54:58.806 --> 00:55:00.267]  Tremendous things in this country.
[00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:02.467]  And they're very excited.
[00:55:02.587 --> 00:55:09.590]  And I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here, they would not be in my office, they would not be in anybody else's office.
[00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.690]  They'd be building and doing things in other countries.
[00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.151]  Let's go ahead and fade this down for now.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.842]  I'm going to come back to that in just a moment.
[00:55:18.222 --> 00:55:18.963]  Cruz did a great job.
[00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:20.524]  We had a computer hiccup playing it earlier.
[00:55:20.544 --> 00:55:21.565]  Sorry about that, folks.
[00:55:22.025 --> 00:55:27.269]  Going back to David Knight, we're going to come back in the next segment and play some more of this and then go to McAfee, who's joining us.
[00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:30.291]  I mean, just think about how huge that was, David.
[00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:34.815]  The first thing he brings up is, oh, looks like it might have been some intelligence agencies released this.
[00:55:35.135 --> 00:55:36.276]  Well, of course they did.
[00:55:36.356 --> 00:55:40.239]  Or CNN wouldn't have run with it, believing they had the proof of blackmail.
[00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:44.422]  I mean, that just shows how reckless these groups are inside the CIA.
[00:55:45.643 --> 00:55:49.964]  I'm just obsessed with the CIA, but it's the oldest, it's the worst, it's the most corrupt, it's the biggest.
[00:55:50.064 --> 00:55:52.744]  I mean, it's the big spoiled baby.
[00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:57.305]  Yeah, you know, Alex, from the very beginning, John McCain's name was linked with this.
[00:55:57.325 --> 00:56:01.446]  When I first saw, the very first report I saw on this, he was linked with it, and I said, hmm, I smell a rat.
[00:56:01.766 --> 00:56:06.887]  One of the smelliest rats in Washington is John McCain, and now he's bragging about, yeah, I released that information.
[00:56:07.547 --> 00:56:10.568]  As New York Times and others pointed out, this is old information.
[00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:16.051]  Except for perhaps the trolling part that was put in by people at 4chan.
[00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:20.032]  The rest of this is old information that's been circulating for a very long time.
[00:56:20.052 --> 00:56:22.994]  The New York Times said, we looked at that, we're not going to put that out.
[00:56:23.074 --> 00:56:26.856]  They were totally unsubstantiated, said the New York Times executive editor.
[00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:31.598]  The USA Today investigative journalist said, this is not how journalism works.
[00:56:32.198 --> 00:56:34.219]  Here's a thing that might or might not be true.
[00:56:34.459 --> 00:56:35.739]  We don't have any supporting evidence.
[00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:37.540]  Decide for yourself if it's legit.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.240]  That's the way he characterized it.
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.801]  And even Mother Jones, Alex, said even Donald Trump deserves journalistic fairness.
[00:56:44.881 --> 00:56:50.163]  And they are no fan of Donald Trump, but they are not going to put out lies because they want to preserve their reputation.
[00:56:51.388 --> 00:56:55.492]  There's a bunch of people named in there who clearly were in other countries at the time.
[00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:59.416]  It's already been proven to the media, so they were hoping it was real.
[00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:01.357]  They know they've lost so much credibility.
[00:57:01.377 --> 00:57:07.043]  They want to try to censor us, so they want to be the big high and mighty groups that, you know, protect Donald Trump.
[00:57:07.063 --> 00:57:10.046]  I mean, the truth is, they're just as discredited as CNN.
[00:57:10.406 --> 00:57:14.129]  The Washington Post is probably even worse, you know, than CNN.
[00:57:15.485 --> 00:57:17.626]  Or BuzzFeed, but let's get the facts straight here, okay?
[00:57:17.886 --> 00:57:21.008]  We should probably file a special report today just showing the history of this.
[00:57:22.168 --> 00:57:30.812]  It's the Clintons and the Democrats flying around with Jerry Epstein on the pedophile plane and flying to these sheiks' houses, you know, the openly keyful kids.
[00:57:31.713 --> 00:57:35.555]  These are the people that have been compromised by foreign powers.
[00:57:36.415 --> 00:57:39.776]  These are the people that are clearly being blackmailed.
[00:57:40.317 --> 00:57:42.718]  These are the people that have this big, long,
[00:57:43.935 --> 00:57:46.519]  Sorted history of being connected to all of us.
[00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:58.034]  So let's not any of us forget that and let's not forget that the MSM is so arrogant that they act like there's no evidence of sickening stuff going on in the Podesta emails.
[00:57:59.201 --> 00:58:00.201]  Well, okay.
[00:58:00.562 --> 00:58:04.643]  Well, what's going on with Meryl Streep standing up a standing ovation for Roman Polanski?
[00:58:04.944 --> 00:58:09.206]  And what's Hollywood doing trying to get his rave of a 13-year-old girl overturned?
[00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.166]  They're so public about this.
[00:58:11.927 --> 00:58:13.387]  It's so ingrained.
[00:58:13.628 --> 00:58:17.069]  It's so top-heavy with pedophiles in Hollywood and in D.C.
[00:58:17.529 --> 00:58:18.670]  that they openly
[00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:23.173]  ...openly are trying to get Roman Polanski's convictions overturned.
[00:58:23.453 --> 00:58:25.635]  That shows how sick these people are.
[00:58:25.695 --> 00:58:30.098]  So they brought this out knowing it's pure bull, knowing it's lies.
[00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:37.223]  Remember, remember the three lawsuits with Jane Doe's saying that Trump had raped her when they were little girls, you know, teenagers.
[00:58:37.523 --> 00:58:45.909]  Totally made up and all of them got dropped and all of them got thrown out because all of them were completely made up and the people wouldn't even show up and claim it or say it.
[00:58:46.129 --> 00:58:48.811]  They were completely fake lawsuits filed.
[00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:53.454]  And I've been threatened by globalists that if I don't watch it, they'll file some fake stuff on me.
[00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:55.235]  Go ahead, throw me in the briar patch.
[00:58:55.275 --> 00:58:56.736]  And that's the other thing I was going to mention, David.
[00:58:59.457 --> 00:59:03.880]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:14.886]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:59:15.046 --> 00:59:19.970]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:22.593]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:59:22.653 --> 00:59:24.154]  It helps detoxify.
[00:59:24.374 --> 00:59:27.217]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:59:27.257 --> 00:59:32.001]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:36.165]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:59:36.585 --> 00:59:38.245]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[00:59:38.265 --> 00:59:43.587]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:59:43.707 --> 00:59:45.147]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:59:45.327 --> 00:59:46.068]  This is so key.
[00:59:46.308 --> 00:59:50.609]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:59:50.629 --> 00:59:52.729]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:59:52.869 --> 00:59:56.310]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:00.788 --> 01:00:06.752]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:17.658]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.447 --> 01:00:32.907]  Okay, David Nice hosting.
[01:00:33.008 --> 01:00:35.669]  I'm going to follow one more special report later in the broadcast.
[01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:44.194]  The crew's got a bunch of excerpts of Trump's two-hour-plus press conference coming up interspersed in this hour and the next hour.
[01:00:45.515 --> 01:00:49.357]  John McAfee's going to be on the broadcast coming up in the next segment and a lot more.
[01:00:50.258 --> 01:00:53.500]  But as I went to break, I was starting to get to the point that
[01:00:54.677 --> 01:01:02.841]  As soon as I hang up here, I'm going to get on the phone and start making some calls to my contacts about when I'm allowed to break some really big news.
[01:01:03.322 --> 01:01:05.883]  And this is the type of news that has me up at night, okay?
[01:01:06.303 --> 01:01:08.624]  And let me tell you something, there isn't much that keeps me up at night, okay?
[01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:10.465]  I sleep like a dead king.
[01:01:10.485 --> 01:01:14.468]  I sleep like somebody under a pyramid or something.
[01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:18.750]  And I have been absolutely waking up over this because
[01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:27.212]  Because this is so hardcore, it's so serious, and it goes to this whole climate of attacking the press, this whole climate of persecution.
[01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:41.435]  Let me tell you, the death throes of the globalists, and they're far from dead, but I'm saying the death throes of their current plan, the death throes of them being so confident, is very, very spectacular and very, very, very, very dangerous.
[01:01:42.095 --> 01:01:45.116]  David Knight, what are some of the topics you're going to be bringing up with Mr. McAfee?
[01:01:46.212 --> 01:01:54.699]  Well, Alex, we're going to talk to him about why he has gone on record saying that he doesn't believe that this intelligence report has any validity whatsoever.
[01:01:54.759 --> 01:02:00.084]  He's got very specific details in terms of analyzing what they're saying.
[01:02:00.524 --> 01:02:05.128]  This is our evidence, and it's circumstantial, and it's circumstantial evidence that doesn't hold water.
[01:02:05.148 --> 01:02:06.329]  So we're going to talk to him about that.
[01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:14.536]  I also want to get his comments on the increasing surveillance that we're seeing from the Internet of Things, and that's something we all should be very concerned about.
[01:02:14.616 --> 01:02:25.901]  Geospatial intelligence looking at what we're doing is far more damaging, far more dangerous than them recording our conversations, recording our texts, because they're going to feed that into an algorithm.
[01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:36.407]  We've talked about this quite some time, and come up with a minority report that's going to flag you, perhaps falsely, for being a suspect, or let other people go through the loop.
[01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:40.949]  And we've seen people that have been put on a no-fly list for absolutely no reason.
[01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:42.850]  It's one of the first stories I reported on when I came here.
[01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:44.574]  This is all official.
[01:02:45.217 --> 01:02:48.770]  The Communist Chinese announced a year and a half ago Paul Watson wrote about a drugs link to it.
[01:02:50.074 --> 01:02:56.817]  They have a internet social score that government corporations will create for you, whether you like it or not, that follows you.
[01:02:56.877 --> 01:03:00.659]  If you criticize government or global corporations, they lower your score.
[01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:04.920]  And if your score goes low enough, you physically won't get jobs in the real world.
[01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:14.084]  So this takes the yellow stars on the Jews or whatever, or the pink triangles on the gay people in Nazi Germany, and takes it five, six levels up.
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:16.992]  We're good.
[01:03:22.393 --> 01:03:24.654]  Is the flood independent media.
[01:03:25.154 --> 01:03:26.535]  We're not the alternative, folks.
[01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.816]  We are the true press, the true independent.
[01:03:28.916 --> 01:03:32.157]  We wear our bias of telling the truth and loving freedom on our sleeves.
[01:03:32.617 --> 01:03:33.937]  We are the cutting edge of this.
[01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.919]  And we absolutely need your prayers, your support.
[01:03:37.999 --> 01:03:40.280]  We need you to spread the word about InfoWars.com.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.281]  We need you to spread the articles and the videos.
[01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:44.001]  You're the reason we're reaching so many people.
[01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:48.403]  We need you to get the BioTruth Selenium that's back in stock at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:03:49.105 --> 01:03:56.973]  We need you to go in there and to get a Hillary for Prison 2017 Deport George Soros shirt on the back.
[01:03:57.473 --> 01:04:04.400]  We need you to get DNA Force 10% off right now because it's a great product, you need it, and it supports the broadcast.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.123]  We need you to go to infowarestore.com.
[01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:18.488]  You know, now that, you know, we're here and it's getting ready for spring in a few months and to get your non-GMO heirloom seeds at the lowest prices, the widest selection at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:04:18.929 --> 01:04:20.610]  We need your support.
[01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:22.711]  The way to beat these people is prosperity.
[01:04:22.731 --> 01:04:24.993]  The way to beat them is outgrowing their tyranny.
[01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:30.097]  They've been using our money forever against us to build their system of control, but it's totally unnatural.
[01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:33.259]  When you move with your feet and with your reviews,
[01:04:33.779 --> 01:04:34.040]  We're good.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:02.246]  Of the FBI director saying, cover up the video camera on your computer screen, cover up your webcam because people are watching you.
[01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:07.390]  Now remember, we told folks this 20 years ago when webcams were first coming out.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:19.545]  The Telegraph is reporting that Barack Obama's farewell speech included remarks about his leadership with an urgent and fearful warning about the state of American democracy.
[01:05:19.725 --> 01:05:25.648]  A warning that resonated eerily similar to the one that George Soros gave shortly after Trump won the election.
[01:05:25.868 --> 01:05:31.872]  The Telegraph is saying it's because of his speech on Tuesday night that's even more remarkable than anything he's done in the past eight years.
[01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:34.473]  He was preaching change and hope throughout those eight years.
[01:05:34.553 --> 01:05:39.517]  He's now ending his, quote, leadership with an urgent warning about the state of American democracy and affairs.
[01:05:39.717 --> 01:05:48.122]  One writer says it was a thinly veiled slay to a divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump's election campaign, which included attacks on Muslims, the disabled, women, and immigrants.
[01:05:48.342 --> 01:05:50.244]  What news source are they looking at?
[01:05:50.384 --> 01:05:50.944]  CNN?
[01:05:51.145 --> 01:05:54.247]  On what planet did Donald Trump attack any of those?
[01:05:54.527 --> 01:06:03.155]  Anyway, Mr. Obama went on to say, if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.
[01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:05.377]  Goodbye, Mr. Obama, and farewell.
[01:06:05.697 --> 01:06:06.958]  Oh, and thanks for the speech.
[01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:09.240]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:14.404]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:25.412]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:06:25.592 --> 01:06:30.515]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:06:30.635 --> 01:06:33.137]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:06:33.197 --> 01:06:34.698]  It helps detoxify.
[01:06:34.938 --> 01:06:37.739]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:42.562]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:46.705]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.746]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[01:06:48.786 --> 01:06:54.147]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:06:54.247 --> 01:06:55.688]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[01:06:55.868 --> 01:06:56.608]  This is so key.
[01:06:56.848 --> 01:07:01.169]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:07:01.189 --> 01:07:03.270]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:06.871]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:10.052 --> 01:07:16.234]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:07:16.594 --> 01:07:19.495]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:25.016]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:07:25.436 --> 01:07:31.418]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:07:31.558 --> 01:07:34.679]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:07:34.839 --> 01:07:36.279]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:40.640]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.701]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:07:43.761 --> 01:07:45.342]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:07:45.442 --> 01:07:48.603]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:07:48.903 --> 01:07:51.223]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:07:51.503 --> 01:07:52.464]  It's in powder form.
[01:07:52.564 --> 01:07:55.264]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:07:55.445 --> 01:07:56.045]  I take this.
[01:07:56.165 --> 01:07:57.845]  This is the product that I take.
[01:07:57.965 --> 01:07:59.926]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:08:00.766 --> 01:08:01.527]  We fight the Globals!
[01:08:01.547 --> 01:08:02.407]  We fight the New World Order!
[01:08:02.707 --> 01:08:08.610]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:23.357]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:08:23.857 --> 01:08:26.298]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:29.120]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.496 --> 01:08:37.858]  Okay, we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:38.579 --> 01:08:43.764]  And I'm going to hand the baton here to David Knight in the Central Texas News Center in Austin.
[01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:51.552]  We also have John McAfee, a personal friend of mine, a great patriot, a defender of free speech and Internet rights.
[01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:55.876]  He's going to be breaking down in the next hour just a host of issues.
[01:08:56.396 --> 01:08:58.098]  He's also a security expert.
[01:08:58.118 --> 01:08:59.560]  Everybody knows he's not a McAfee.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.964]  One of the top hackers out there today, he was able to hack the Belizean government.
[01:09:04.544 --> 01:09:11.951]  They exposed their connections to jihadis and a riots and plot and so much more before it was all confirmed three years later to be true.
[01:09:12.031 --> 01:09:13.072]  It's just simply incredible.
[01:09:13.612 --> 01:09:15.734]  I got to be honest with you, I was kind of halfway rolling my eyes.
[01:09:15.754 --> 01:09:18.097]  It was just so James Bond-esque, but it did indeed happen.
[01:09:18.517 --> 01:09:20.539]  He hacked in via their microphones and cameras.
[01:09:21.219 --> 01:09:21.640]  Ha ha!
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.201]  That was what, six years ago now?
[01:09:23.221 --> 01:09:23.762]  Five years ago.
[01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:28.495]  So he's here to break down the so-called CIA report, but just on the surface.
[01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:29.818]  Forget the technical stuff.
[01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:30.720]  He's going to break that down.
[01:09:31.696 --> 01:09:33.297]  On the surface, it's like cattling.
[01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:37.681]  Oh, two years ago on RT, someone said something bad about Hillary.
[01:09:38.201 --> 01:09:41.263]  Well, I mean, the whole media ganged up on Trump and the American people.
[01:09:41.884 --> 01:09:44.826]  It was a hundred times what RT's effect ever was.
[01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:46.648]  And it blew up in their face.
[01:09:47.168 --> 01:09:52.172]  So now there's this new report about golden showers and prostitutes pee-peeing on people.
[01:09:52.232 --> 01:09:53.553]  I mean, I'm sorry, folks, that's what it is.
[01:09:54.053 --> 01:09:55.154]  Just totally ridiculous.
[01:09:55.174 --> 01:09:56.655]  That's the kind of stuff the Clintons are into.
[01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:01.219]  But here they are, ladies and gentlemen, blaming it on Trump with no evidence.
[01:10:02.222 --> 01:10:03.704]  Showing how out of control they are.
[01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:16.482]  And here it is, CNN leading the anti-fake news narrative, when they are the biggest deceivers, caught using blue screens at Sandy Hook, caught, you know, using fake reporters, caught interviewing their own reporters as witnesses.
[01:10:16.942 --> 01:10:18.564]  I mean, this is a pack of liars.
[01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:25.186]  We've got a bunch of clips now throughout the hour coming up of Trump's press conference that went for, what, two and a half hours.
[01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:28.368]  That'll be interspersed with McAfee and others.
[01:10:28.788 --> 01:10:40.555]  I'm going to go ahead and punch out of here with this clip of Trump earlier today, breaking down the fact that the Internet of Things is very, very dangerous and that we've got to be aware of it and have to be concerned about it.
[01:10:40.575 --> 01:10:44.898]  That's why Trump doesn't allow computers basically around him at Trump Tower.
[01:10:44.938 --> 01:10:46.919]  But before I do that, just briefly one more time.
[01:10:48.689 --> 01:10:53.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason I'm so excited is we are changing the world.
[01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.133]  We are promoting freedom.
[01:10:55.153 --> 01:10:56.553]  We are promoting the Renaissance.
[01:10:56.713 --> 01:10:58.254]  When I say that, it isn't just words.
[01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:01.256]  We are promoting populism.
[01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:03.237]  We are promoting prosperity.
[01:11:03.277 --> 01:11:04.738]  We are promoting being honorable.
[01:11:05.078 --> 01:11:07.279]  We are promoting free will and free association.
[01:11:07.619 --> 01:11:15.744]  We're promoting true classical liberalism, which means keep more of your taxes, have a right to protect yourself, empower the individual.
[01:11:16.284 --> 01:11:17.605]  They've changed all the terms.
[01:11:17.645 --> 01:11:18.465]  They've scrambled it.
[01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:22.126]  But now we've made the Republican and Democratic establishment naked.
[01:11:22.527 --> 01:11:23.687]  We know they're working together.
[01:11:24.087 --> 01:11:24.788]  And they're panicking.
[01:11:24.828 --> 01:11:31.470]  McCain even brags, as David Knight said last hour, that he's behind this Russia blackmail made-up crap.
[01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:32.371]  He's so insane.
[01:11:33.111 --> 01:11:40.834]  He publicly met with Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra and said they're great guys when they've been killing, at that time, tens of thousands of Christians and others.
[01:11:40.874 --> 01:11:41.915]  Now it's hundreds of thousands.
[01:11:42.235 --> 01:11:43.435]  I mean, he's a monster.
[01:11:43.835 --> 01:11:45.036]  Totally disconnected.
[01:11:47.401 --> 01:11:47.781]  We're good.
[01:12:15.974 --> 01:12:16.575]  In a second.
[01:12:17.056 --> 01:12:22.446]  But that said, I can now tell you without a shadow of a doubt Trump's the real deal.
[01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:24.330]  He knows the whole enchilada.
[01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:26.193]  He knew it before I was even born.
[01:12:27.155 --> 01:12:27.936]  He basically
[01:12:28.789 --> 01:12:46.528]  He's the original Alex Jones, and he was so smart and played such a long game with these people waiting, waiting for the moment, pinning op-eds he paid four years to have to get, hoping things would get turned around.
[01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:49.952]  If you watch him in earlier clips, he kept hoping somebody would show up and do it.
[01:12:49.992 --> 01:12:50.613]  He didn't want to do it.
[01:12:51.213 --> 01:12:53.935]  This guy is literally doing this for America.
[01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:57.397]  He's even putting on the big smug act everybody likes for the public.
[01:12:57.417 --> 01:12:58.238]  That's not even Donald Trump.
[01:12:58.558 --> 01:13:03.521]  Donald Trump is a really quiet, focused, idiot savant level political brain.
[01:13:03.942 --> 01:13:05.262]  And they are horrified.
[01:13:05.322 --> 01:13:07.004]  They've got the real dossier on him.
[01:13:07.264 --> 01:13:13.588]  This guy is so Americana that it's like vampires are scared of the sun at midday.
[01:13:14.108 --> 01:13:15.370]  I mean, it is an amazing time.
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:16.471]  So that's why I'm so excited.
[01:13:16.752 --> 01:13:20.056]  It's why I'm begging all of you to realize we've got to spread the word.
[01:13:20.076 --> 01:13:20.977]  We've got to take action.
[01:13:21.037 --> 01:13:21.938]  But we are targets.
[01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:22.779]  Trump is a target.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.001]  I'm a target.
[01:13:25.349 --> 01:13:26.550]  I wish I could tell you folks.
[01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:27.411]  I wish I could tell you.
[01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:31.555]  It's beyond, it's beyond, you know, a Bourne Supremacy movie, okay?
[01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:33.716]  I mean, I can't tell you all this.
[01:13:33.796 --> 01:13:34.437]  I just can't tell you.
[01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:35.338]  I'm not allowed to.
[01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:36.339]  Okay, I'm just gonna stop right there.
[01:13:36.839 --> 01:13:41.483]  But believe me, this is beyond any movie, any spy novel, anything you've ever heard of.
[01:13:41.523 --> 01:13:44.826]  This is, this is, this is, this is, I just can't tell you.
[01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:47.028]  I mean, just look how crazy the show already is.
[01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:48.969]  Look at what we're doing with you together.
[01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:51.151]  It's already just completely over the top.
[01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:52.893]  It's three times that, folks.
[01:13:53.634 --> 01:13:56.142]  But hopefully I'll be able to tell you some of this stuff soon.
[01:13:56.483 --> 01:13:59.873]  But it is, this is the battle for America happening right now and all of you...
[01:14:01.791 --> 01:14:10.797]  Understand, the patriots in our military, the patriots in our government, the patriots in corporations that hate what's happening, they all look to you as the real resistance.
[01:14:10.877 --> 01:14:11.378]  You're it.
[01:14:11.918 --> 01:14:13.259]  Spreading the word, taking action.
[01:14:13.459 --> 01:14:15.401]  They want to thank you, I want to thank you.
[01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.962]  Stop thanking us, okay?
[01:14:17.002 --> 01:14:17.902]  You got that backwards.
[01:14:18.303 --> 01:14:22.906]  I want to thank you for bucking the system, bucking the brainwashing, bucking the control.
[01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:27.489]  Let's play the clip of Trump earlier today talking about what John McAfee's been warning of for years.
[01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:30.391]  Then we'll hand it over to John McAfee and, of course, David Knight.
[01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:36.672]  When I leave our country, I'm a very high profile person, would you say?
[01:14:38.552 --> 01:14:40.153]  I am extremely careful.
[01:14:40.513 --> 01:14:41.913]  I'm surrounded by bodyguards.
[01:14:42.714 --> 01:14:43.914]  I'm surrounded by people.
[01:14:44.754 --> 01:14:51.697]  And I always tell them, anywhere, but I always tell them, if I'm leaving this country, be very careful.
[01:14:52.677 --> 01:14:57.338]  Because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.
[01:14:57.378 --> 01:15:01.640]  I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.
[01:15:02.654 --> 01:15:04.676]  And number one, I hope you're going to be good anyway.
[01:15:05.536 --> 01:15:08.539]  But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.
[01:15:09.059 --> 01:15:14.583]  Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.
[01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:21.449]  You better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:25.192]  I tell this to people all the time.
[01:15:26.374 --> 01:15:31.439]  I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well.
[01:15:31.539 --> 01:15:34.361]  Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well.
[01:15:35.402 --> 01:15:41.767]  And I told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television.
[01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:42.928]  Cameras all over the place.
[01:15:43.509 --> 01:15:45.591]  And again, not just Russia, all over.
[01:15:47.233 --> 01:15:57.843]  Okay, and that was Donald Trump today responding to the fake news claims from CNN and BuzzFeed that most of the media, even the media that has been unfairly treating Donald Trump, refused to cover.
[01:15:57.883 --> 01:16:02.347]  They would not stoop that low, but BuzzFeed and CNN set a new standard.
[01:16:02.607 --> 01:16:07.752]  And there you have Donald Trump talking about what we all know and saying, I've said for years to my people as I travel abroad,
[01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:09.053]  Be careful what you do.
[01:16:09.354 --> 01:16:11.656]  People are recording you, especially when you're in hotels.
[01:16:11.716 --> 01:16:13.138]  And joining us now is John McAfee.
[01:16:13.158 --> 01:16:15.300]  And of course, John McAfee is no stranger to any of this.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.882]  He's not naive about this.
[01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:20.466]  John created McAfee Associates back in 1987, 30 years ago.
[01:16:20.486 --> 01:16:21.127]  And you know, John,
[01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.610]  The U.S.
[01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:29.596]  government hasn't really done a very good job in protecting themselves or protecting us from cyber hacks in the interim years, have they?
[01:16:29.656 --> 01:16:38.725]  Even though you're now not part of the company, you sold this to Intel Corporation, but it's probably the most famous anti-virus software out there.
[01:16:39.165 --> 01:16:41.848]  Certainly you understand what's going on with this.
[01:16:42.428 --> 01:16:45.832]  I want you to speak to this intelligence report that we got.
[01:16:46.593 --> 01:16:52.462]  Uh, about Russian hacking because this is a pretty patently absurd set of circumstantial evidence.
[01:16:52.503 --> 01:16:59.133]  And then as they put that out, uh, even before they put out their intelligence report that you're going to dissect here for us a little bit.
[01:16:59.778 --> 01:17:08.345]  They put out another fake report about the Russians having hacked our power grid and that was eventually exposed as a total fake fraud and now we've got this fake news that we've got today.
[01:17:08.385 --> 01:17:18.713]  But let's talk about the intelligence report that has surfaced and the circumstantial evidence that they put in there saying that this is how we know it was the Russians.
[01:17:20.148 --> 01:17:28.692]  Well, I've read that entire 25-page report multiple times, and half of it is laughable.
[01:17:29.732 --> 01:17:31.733]  It is absurd beyond belief.
[01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:49.041]  For example, they're expecting us to believe that the Russian intelligence services are foolish enough to leave the Russian language in the code, to leave the date and time stamp that the program was compiled,
[01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:55.455]  To use a Cyrillic keyboard, which could be detected by forensic science.
[01:17:56.355 --> 01:18:02.420]  And lastly, to have an IP address that points back to the Russian Kremlin.
[01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:09.046]  Seriously, imagine what would happen here in America if the CIA were to hack Russia.
[01:18:09.979 --> 01:18:15.901]  Um, and we left the IP address of the programmer on the second floor of the CIA offices.
[01:18:26.385 --> 01:18:27.166]  I think?
[01:18:46.576 --> 01:18:46.696]  Yeah.
[01:19:01.613 --> 01:19:01.813]  Yeah.
[01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:01.953]  Yeah.
[01:19:24.415 --> 01:19:28.720]  They're way too sophisticated to make that many mistakes.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.725]  And if they were that unsophisticated, we really wouldn't have anything to worry about with the Russians, would we?
[01:19:33.945 --> 01:19:37.709]  And yet, they're far more sophisticated than that report would indicate.
[01:19:38.289 --> 01:19:40.492]  So we do have things to be concerned about, but not that.
[01:19:41.052 --> 01:19:42.193]  It's absurd beyond belief.
[01:19:42.354 --> 01:19:43.094]  Absurd beyond belief.
[01:19:43.174 --> 01:19:46.458]  Plus, the software that was used is a year and a half old.
[01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:49.643]  And has had many updates since that time.
[01:19:50.223 --> 01:20:01.146]  So, in all sincerity, do you think the Russians spent all of this time updating and fixing their bugs, and then decided to use a software piece that was a year and a half old?
[01:20:01.406 --> 01:20:01.606]  No.
[01:20:02.226 --> 01:20:07.727]  Everything points to a teenager or a very unsophisticated actor.
[01:20:08.308 --> 01:20:10.588]  Yeah, and of course, you know, there's two different issues here.
[01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:13.289]  There's the Podesta emails, which were a phishing attack.
[01:20:14.091 --> 01:20:24.538]  And then there's also the DNC data, which we've had a former British ambassador say, hey, I traveled to the United States and that information was handed to me in a park.
[01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:31.783]  And we had the current British ambassador saying, you know, I had some people tell me when I was in Washington that they were involved in turning that information over.
[01:20:32.743 --> 01:20:37.025]  Looks like, if you want to believe the British ambassadors, of course they don't even talk about that.
[01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:39.287]  They don't give that any credibility in mainstream media.
[01:20:39.647 --> 01:20:43.389]  But if you believe those British ambassadors, that wasn't even a hack.
[01:20:43.449 --> 01:20:45.270]  It wasn't even a phishing attack.
[01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:49.852]  It could very easily have been an inside job.
[01:20:50.352 --> 01:20:51.093]  We do not know.
[01:20:51.433 --> 01:20:52.053]  Here's the thing.
[01:20:53.054 --> 01:20:56.876]  If a hacker organization is smart enough
[01:20:57.518 --> 01:21:08.753]  Technologically competent enough, which we must assume the Russian government is, just like we are, then there is simply no way to trace that back.
[01:21:09.173 --> 01:21:15.361]  Even though in the report, there's a sentence in the report that says, it is extremely difficult to
[01:21:16.298 --> 01:21:20.739]  Find attribution for any hack, but not impossible.
[01:21:21.399 --> 01:21:25.901]  And then they go on to say, we we know what specific tools people use.
[01:21:26.321 --> 01:21:27.661]  We know how they act.
[01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:30.342]  Well, good Lord, that's how all hackers act.
[01:21:30.642 --> 01:21:32.403]  And all hackers use the same tools.
[01:21:33.683 --> 01:21:39.044]  Either are without disrespecting our intelligence services.
[01:21:40.005 --> 01:21:40.605]  We are
[01:21:41.691 --> 01:21:46.097]  Um, they are either naive or they are purposely deceiving us.
[01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:47.218]  One or the other.
[01:21:47.782 --> 01:22:03.265]  Well, the dog that has embarked here, of course, in the mainstream media is the fact that Hillary Clinton did disrespect our intelligence services when she put secret and above top secret emails and communications on her server that was not secure, that was easily hacked.
[01:22:03.305 --> 01:22:11.767]  And we know for a fact, if they're going to tell us that the Russians went in and got information about John Podesta's emails, do you think they would get it from Hillary Clinton's emails?
[01:22:11.847 --> 01:22:14.928]  And yet they don't ever make that connection when they're talking about it.
[01:22:15.368 --> 01:22:18.150]  That's a dead giveaway that this is all about politics, isn't it?
[01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.451]  Of course it's about politics.
[01:22:20.911 --> 01:22:22.912]  And of course this is politically motivated.
[01:22:22.932 --> 01:22:32.878]  And anybody could see this if they look through the smoke and mirrors that the intelligence service is giving us.
[01:22:33.798 --> 01:22:40.582]  It's a trivial thing for us, especially any cyber security specialist will see the holes in the system.
[01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:45.672]  I want to ask you about the way that they're presenting this, and of course the language is everything.
[01:22:45.692 --> 01:22:52.156]  They'll go out and talk about how the Russians hacked our election, but then they are not very specific about that.
[01:22:52.196 --> 01:23:01.943]  When you go down and look at what they're actually saying when they say the Russians quote-unquote hacked our election, they're not saying that the Russians got into our electronic voting machines or any of the tabulating areas.
[01:23:02.223 --> 01:23:10.789]  What they're saying is that the Russians released true information about Hillary Clinton and the DNC and John Podesta that cost her the election when we found out what she was about.
[01:23:11.409 --> 01:23:19.192]  But, John, when they talk about hacking the election, hacking the election, I believe, I want to get your comments on this, do you see it this way?
[01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:38.901]  I think they're creating a problem and creating an image in the minds of the American public that what was involved here was Russians actually getting into our voting machines because then the follow-up that they did to this was Jay Johnson unilaterally declaring, hey, we're going to get involved directly into the elections, even after it surfaced,
[01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:52.010]  That Homeland Security had tried to hack into multiple state Board of Elections computers, so they were the hackers trying to get into the computers and now they're saying, hey, and we're going to do that, we're going to use this as an excuse.
[01:23:52.130 --> 01:24:03.898]  Aren't they subtly creating a psychological problem in the minds of people that they're not technically saying exists and then using that to insert themselves into our electronic voting machines in future elections?
[01:24:05.031 --> 01:24:22.455]  Well, that's entirely possible, but I think the motive behind what's happening now is you notice that as soon as we started pointing fingers at Russia as trying to manipulate our elections, nobody's paying any attention to the actual emails anymore.
[01:24:22.635 --> 01:24:23.016]  That's right.
[01:24:23.036 --> 01:24:24.356]  Because isn't that the real problem?
[01:24:24.596 --> 01:24:25.856]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:25.956 --> 01:24:28.497]  Isn't that what this is truly about?
[01:24:29.321 --> 01:24:39.531]  Misconduct that no one's paying any attention to now, because we have a misdirection going, oh there's something far more important than this misconduct.
[01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:43.514]  And that is the fact that it was the Russians that told us about it.
[01:24:44.015 --> 01:24:46.017]  Please, wake up America!
[01:24:46.317 --> 01:24:47.118]  Wake the F up!
[01:24:47.745 --> 01:24:53.888]  Yeah, I think the military-industrial complex, obviously we know that they're trying to restart, and have restarted, the Cold War with Russia.
[01:24:54.248 --> 01:25:00.931]  And they want to tie Donald Trump's hands, because he's indicated that he wants to de-escalate those tensions, he wants to have a detente, an easing of relations.
[01:25:01.432 --> 01:25:09.756]  And so they want to tie his hands by saying, you're a Russian agent, you are controlled by the Russians, all these different fake news stories continue to have that theme.
[01:25:10.116 --> 01:25:16.859]  As you pointed out, it's a very convenient theme for them to have, as they did in the run-up to the election, to divert attention away from what
[01:25:17.179 --> 01:25:18.679]  I'm going to be really frank with you.
[01:25:18.699 --> 01:25:20.920]  If our voting machines have not been hacked by someone,
[01:25:47.259 --> 01:25:51.263]  And if they have been, it's been most likely by one or the other of our political parties.
[01:25:51.503 --> 01:25:51.704]  Yes.
[01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.746]  Then I'll eat one of my shoes.
[01:25:54.386 --> 01:25:57.710]  Because voting machines are no different than any other computer.
[01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:04.737]  They were designed and built by private companies that employ thousands of people.
[01:26:04.757 --> 01:26:07.539]  Now, I promise you, you know human nature.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:08.961]  If you have 1,000 people,
[01:26:11.175 --> 01:26:13.858]  I guarantee you one or two of them are going to be bad apples.
[01:26:14.439 --> 01:26:24.470]  They're going to be people who are planted there by your competition or by the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or the Chinese or someone.
[01:26:25.711 --> 01:26:31.378]  And because of that, I promise you these machines are hackable and have been hacked.
[01:26:32.185 --> 01:26:33.625]  Oh, we absolutely know they have.
[01:26:34.446 --> 01:26:36.646]  We've seen the demonstrations every time we have an election.
[01:26:36.686 --> 01:26:56.591]  We have somebody at a local television station bring some kids in from a nearby computer and they say, look, we can put this stuff on a USB drive, we stick it in, and I'm going to now operate the machine and it's going to record completely different votes than I've done, and then I'm going to pull this thing out and it's going to erase the fact that it ever did any of this after it adjusts the totals.
[01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:58.732]  And of course we understand that that's there.
[01:26:58.772 --> 01:26:59.952]  The thing that concerns me
[01:27:00.972 --> 01:27:22.180]  As we're looking at this, of course, John, is the fact that, as you know, you can have, when you create a piece of business entity or you create some software, there's something that you can do that's locally, but you also want to eventually get it to something that is an enterprise operation, that is scalable, that is extendable to a large area.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.422]  And that's what I'm concerned about with the moves of Homeland Security now.
[01:27:26.802 --> 01:27:29.263]  We know that all of these machines are vulnerable.
[01:27:29.423 --> 01:27:29.923]  People can go
[01:27:46.608 --> 01:27:48.049]  Well, my feeling is this.
[01:27:48.489 --> 01:27:49.449]  We are not prepared.
[01:28:16.627 --> 01:28:18.348]  For electronic voting.
[01:28:18.388 --> 01:28:18.968]  We're just not.
[01:28:19.568 --> 01:28:22.529]  We don't have the cyber security in place.
[01:28:22.969 --> 01:28:27.951]  The secure systems that can guarantee that these things cannot be hacked.
[01:28:28.832 --> 01:28:29.272]  We don't.
[01:28:29.832 --> 01:28:33.553]  We have to stay with the paper system for many years.
[01:28:34.094 --> 01:28:34.494]  Many years.
[01:28:34.534 --> 01:28:35.294]  You must believe me.
[01:28:35.314 --> 01:28:35.954]  I agree.
[01:28:35.994 --> 01:28:38.335]  Hackers are clever beyond belief.
[01:28:39.276 --> 01:28:42.457]  And we are in a very slippery slope here.
[01:28:43.217 --> 01:28:45.278]  Where the slightest misstep
[01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:56.991]  We'll turn this nation from a democracy into a theocracy, or an oligarchy, or a dictatorship.
[01:28:58.232 --> 01:28:59.372]  And we can't let that happen.
[01:28:59.392 --> 01:29:00.933]  I'm sorry, we're just not ready.
[01:29:00.973 --> 01:29:05.996]  I don't care what the voting machine people tell you, the ones that make them, that create them, and sell them.
[01:29:06.316 --> 01:29:06.957]  We're not ready.
[01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:12.731]  Well, you know that very well because you had that business and that was 30 years ago.
[01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:19.073]  McAfee is constantly adjusting and adapting to the constantly evolving threats.
[01:29:19.293 --> 01:29:20.773]  Nothing ever stays static.
[01:29:20.853 --> 01:29:28.896]  And so anybody, if they're involved in countermeasures to that kind of hacking or corruption or viruses, you have to constantly be modifying your system.
[01:29:28.976 --> 01:29:34.137]  And we know from a fact that we've had all the personnel records of the US military
[01:29:34.377 --> 01:29:34.797]  I don't know.
[01:29:59.068 --> 01:30:02.092]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.993 --> 01:30:05.816]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.761 --> 01:30:15.929]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:30:16.489 --> 01:30:17.911]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:30:18.786 --> 01:30:20.667]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:30:21.288 --> 01:30:26.831]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:35.837]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:30:35.857 --> 01:30:37.899]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:30:38.179 --> 01:30:39.380]  This is the best system out there.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.402]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:42.662 --> 01:30:43.402]  This is how it works.
[01:30:43.703 --> 01:30:44.223]  You order.
[01:30:44.343 --> 01:30:45.143]  Customized or
[01:30:46.224 --> 01:30:47.686]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[01:30:48.186 --> 01:30:51.329]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:55.713]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:30:55.893 --> 01:30:56.674]  You cannot lose.
[01:30:56.714 --> 01:30:57.815]  You're funding the Infowar.
[01:30:58.115 --> 01:31:04.861]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[01:31:05.181 --> 01:31:09.145]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:31:09.685 --> 01:31:12.466]  Just where does CNN find their news sources?
[01:31:12.566 --> 01:31:24.151]  If you recall, they first suggested that the Russians hacked the election to help get Donald Trump elected, and yesterday they're reporting now that intel chiefs are presenting Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.
[01:31:24.311 --> 01:31:34.415]  What they're insinuating, directly quoting here from their website, classified documents presented last week, that President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have
[01:31:34.735 --> 01:31:37.898]  Compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
[01:31:38.058 --> 01:31:40.460]  This, of course, is coming from, quote, multiple U.S.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.962]  officials with direct knowledge on the briefings.
[01:31:43.282 --> 01:31:43.943]  Oh, really?
[01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:51.930]  What they're insinuating is that the Russians have finance secrets and sexual deviant secrets about Trump that could be used to blackmail him.
[01:31:52.090 --> 01:32:04.594]  They're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took an extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing of documents was to make Donald Trump aware that such allegations involving him were circulating among their agencies.
[01:32:04.734 --> 01:32:05.994]  I can't make this up if I tried.
[01:32:06.174 --> 01:32:07.875]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:32:09.468 --> 01:32:15.631]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:16.011 --> 01:32:18.913]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:19.253 --> 01:32:24.436]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:24.856 --> 01:32:30.839]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:34.101]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:34.261 --> 01:32:35.702]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:32:35.922 --> 01:32:40.046]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:40.246 --> 01:32:43.108]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:43.188 --> 01:32:44.770]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:48.033]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:50.655]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:50.935 --> 01:32:51.896]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:51.976 --> 01:32:54.698]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:54.859 --> 01:32:55.479]  I take this.
[01:32:55.579 --> 01:32:57.261]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:57.381 --> 01:32:59.342]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:33:00.183 --> 01:33:00.964]  We fight the Globals.
[01:33:00.984 --> 01:33:01.845]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:33:31.866 --> 01:33:33.367]  Hillary, Hillary, move!
[01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:34.648]  Move out the way!
[01:33:35.128 --> 01:33:37.449]  Alex Jones here, co-hosting with David Knight.
[01:33:37.469 --> 01:33:45.094]  We've also got John McAfee, the legendary internet security expert, of course, of McAfee, breaking everything down.
[01:33:45.114 --> 01:33:46.875]  You know, I think we've kind of won this battle.
[01:33:47.075 --> 01:33:49.677]  We know the report, the 25-page report's fake.
[01:33:50.397 --> 01:33:54.179]  We know that it's mainly a bunch of whining about, oh, look, Hillary lost the election.
[01:33:54.199 --> 01:33:55.840]  The all-powerful Russians did it.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.801]  They criticized her.
[01:33:57.261 --> 01:33:57.561]  Boo-hoo.
[01:33:57.661 --> 01:33:58.982]  I mean, it's totally insane.
[01:33:59.763 --> 01:34:02.204]  Everything they're accusing Russia of, they themselves have done.
[01:34:02.224 --> 01:34:08.688]  But the epic clips that are up on InfoWars.com right now are just incredible.
[01:34:09.008 --> 01:34:10.389]  And I don't overuse the word epic.
[01:34:10.429 --> 01:34:12.090]  We live in epic times.
[01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:14.692]  I mean, all times have been pretty darn important.
[01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.873]  But if you go up to InfoWars.com right now,
[01:34:17.859 --> 01:34:18.499]  There's the word.
[01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:18.939]  Epic.
[01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:20.299]  E-P-I-C.
[01:34:20.499 --> 01:34:20.760]  Epic.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:21.400]  Epic.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.920]  Trump shuts down CNN reporter, calls network fake news.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.901]  This is what I've been begging for.
[01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:29.581]  The news always wants to know when I talk about Trump.
[01:34:30.941 --> 01:34:33.162]  The news always wants to know when I'm talking to Trump what we talk about.
[01:34:33.182 --> 01:34:45.324]  Well, I talk about how great it is when he calls out the mainstream media as a fraud, when he tells them they're slimy, when he ignores them, when he doesn't invite them to press conferences, when he doesn't tell them his itinerary.
[01:34:45.644 --> 01:34:47.064]  These people are so arrogant.
[01:34:47.876 --> 01:34:48.896]  They're in their own world.
[01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:53.938]  And the key to breaking mainstream media's back forever is realizing their back is already broken.
[01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:56.479]  So the full video is up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:56.759 --> 01:35:00.500]  Trump calls several mainstream press organizations terrible.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.161]  In fact, there are several clips we're going to play back to back right now.
[01:35:04.241 --> 01:35:09.343]  And then I'll let David Knight introduce the rest of them and let Mr. McAfee obviously break it down.
[01:35:09.623 --> 01:35:11.403]  But this is the InfoWars, stay with us.
[01:35:13.784 --> 01:35:15.765]  That turned out to be so false and fake.
[01:35:17.899 --> 01:35:18.839]  I think it's a disgrace.
[01:35:19.399 --> 01:35:21.040]  And I say that, and I say that.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.981]  And that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.
[01:35:25.201 --> 01:35:26.261]  I think it's a disgrace.
[01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:32.963]  That information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[01:35:33.443 --> 01:35:41.845]  As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences.
[01:35:41.885 --> 01:35:42.605]  They already are.
[01:35:43.325 --> 01:35:46.986]  And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up,
[01:35:47.955 --> 01:35:49.957]  And by the way, we just found out I was coming down.
[01:35:50.017 --> 01:35:51.137]  Michael Cohn.
[01:35:51.318 --> 01:35:52.919]  Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer.
[01:35:52.939 --> 01:35:53.920]  He's a good lawyer in my firm.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.562]  It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about.
[01:35:57.943 --> 01:35:59.924]  So all night long, it's Michael Cohn.
[01:36:00.384 --> 01:36:01.966]  I said, I want to see your passport.
[01:36:02.366 --> 01:36:04.187]  He brings his passport to my office.
[01:36:04.768 --> 01:36:05.608]  I say, hey, wait a minute.
[01:36:05.769 --> 01:36:06.829]  He didn't leave the country.
[01:36:06.989 --> 01:36:08.050]  He wasn't out of the country.
[01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:11.493]  They had Michael Cohn of the Trump Organization was in Prague.
[01:36:12.398 --> 01:36:14.139]  It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen.
[01:36:14.539 --> 01:36:16.180]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.201]  It's a disgrace.
[01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:21.003]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.
[01:36:21.303 --> 01:36:24.664]  And since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[01:36:24.785 --> 01:36:30.628]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?
[01:36:30.668 --> 01:36:32.469]  You are attacking our news organization.
[01:36:32.569 --> 01:36:34.470]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:36.111]  Quiet.
[01:36:36.311 --> 01:36:36.631]  Quiet.
[01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:38.412]  Mr. President-elect, can you stay categorically... Go ahead.
[01:36:38.432 --> 01:36:39.173]  She's asking a question.
[01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:39.493]  Don't be rude.
[01:36:39.513 --> 01:36:40.834]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[01:36:40.854 --> 01:36:41.174]  Don't be rude.
[01:36:41.194 --> 01:36:41.775]  You're attacking us.
[01:36:42.035 --> 01:36:43.015]  Can you give us a question?
[01:36:43.035 --> 01:36:43.696]  Don't be rude.
[01:36:43.876 --> 01:36:44.837]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:36:44.857 --> 01:36:45.757]  Can you give us a question?
[01:36:45.777 --> 01:36:46.678]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:36:46.698 --> 01:36:48.339]  Can you stay categorically... You are fake news.
[01:36:48.519 --> 01:36:53.203]  Sir, can you stay categorically that nobody... Now, Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate.
[01:36:53.243 --> 01:36:53.423]  Go ahead.
[01:36:55.854 --> 01:37:00.096]  President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking.
[01:37:00.376 --> 01:37:01.376]  Do you think they're just fortunate?
[01:37:01.396 --> 01:37:02.437]  I don't think he went too far.
[01:37:02.477 --> 01:37:03.317]  Will you roll them back?
[01:37:03.377 --> 01:37:06.958]  And what do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan to send you a bill for tougher ones?
[01:37:07.999 --> 01:37:10.700]  Okay, we knew this was going to be a combative press conference.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.941]  You just saw the back and forth between CNN and Donald Trump.
[01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:14.801]  We've got another clip.
[01:37:14.861 --> 01:37:17.302]  I want to run that and then we're going to go back to John McAfee.
[01:37:17.322 --> 01:37:18.203]  Let's run that next clip.
[01:37:20.564 --> 01:37:21.384]  Got that next clip ready?
[01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:24.091]  Maybe we don't have that next clip ready.
[01:37:44.867 --> 01:37:46.849]  And by the way, we just found out I was coming down.
[01:37:46.909 --> 01:37:48.050]  Michael Cohn.
[01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:49.831]  Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer.
[01:37:49.851 --> 01:37:50.772]  He's a good lawyer in my firm.
[01:37:50.792 --> 01:37:54.475]  It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about.
[01:37:54.855 --> 01:37:56.837]  So all night long, it's Michael Cohn.
[01:37:57.317 --> 01:37:58.878]  I said, I want to see your passport.
[01:37:59.299 --> 01:38:01.100]  He brings his passport to my office.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.481]  I say, hey, wait a minute.
[01:38:02.681 --> 01:38:03.742]  He didn't leave the country.
[01:38:03.902 --> 01:38:04.963]  He wasn't out of the country.
[01:38:05.223 --> 01:38:08.426]  They had Michael Cohn of the Trump Organization was in Prague.
[01:38:09.329 --> 01:38:11.049]  It turned out to be a different Michael Cohn.
[01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:13.090]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:14.130]  It's a disgrace.
[01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:17.871]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn.
[01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:20.332]  Sir, since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[01:38:20.532 --> 01:38:21.392]  Go ahead.
[01:38:21.432 --> 01:38:22.512]  No, Mr. President-Elect.
[01:38:22.732 --> 01:38:23.012]  Go ahead.
[01:38:23.032 --> 01:38:25.753]  Mr. President-Elect, since you are attacking our news organization... No, not you.
[01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:26.033]  Not you.
[01:38:26.053 --> 01:38:26.833]  Can you give us a chance?
[01:38:26.853 --> 01:38:27.553]  Your organization is terrible.
[01:38:27.573 --> 01:38:28.994]  You are attacking our news organization.
[01:38:29.014 --> 01:38:29.674]  Your organization is terrible.
[01:38:29.694 --> 01:38:31.454]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[01:38:31.494 --> 01:38:31.774]  Go ahead.
[01:38:31.794 --> 01:38:32.775]  All right, so we've already heard that.
[01:38:32.795 --> 01:38:34.335]  That's the back and forth that's going on.
[01:38:35.055 --> 01:38:37.696]  John McAfee, we were just talking about this on the last break.
[01:38:38.496 --> 01:38:46.821]  And of course, they have been pushing further and further, dropping further and further in the esteem of the public as they try to sell this phony narrative.
[01:38:46.841 --> 01:38:48.542]  You broke it down in the last bit.
[01:38:48.562 --> 01:38:51.284]  You said, look, this is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:38:51.324 --> 01:38:56.127]  We've had William Binney, former technical head of the NSA, say this is ridiculous.
[01:38:56.167 --> 01:39:02.331]  We've had Ray McGovern, who used to give briefs for the CIA to the former presidents, he said this is nonsense.
[01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:08.156]  And yet we do have people inside the CIA that are very politically involved that are trying to sell this narrative.
[01:39:08.796 --> 01:39:20.726]  We got the guy who took over after David Petraeus was thrown out of being head of the CIA for violating national security.
[01:39:20.766 --> 01:39:26.811]  The guy that took over from him, Morrell, was a never-Trumper, a Hillary Clinton supporter, and he didn't have any problems.
[01:39:27.131 --> 01:39:29.933]  David Petraeus or Hillary Clinton violating national security.
[01:39:30.193 --> 01:39:31.894]  That's precisely what William Binney was saying.
[01:39:31.914 --> 01:39:35.796]  He said there's a lot of people in national security that understand this is very important.
[01:39:36.176 --> 01:39:37.517]  You understand it's very important.
[01:39:37.537 --> 01:39:39.138]  That's why you started running.
[01:39:39.158 --> 01:39:50.885]  You announced your independent candidacy here on the Alex Jones Show because you wanted to bring attention to our vulnerability for cyber security and you wanted to do it in a way that would do something about it.
[01:39:50.905 --> 01:39:53.787]  And then you went on to run for the Libertarian nomination.
[01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:55.268]  But this is a real issue.
[01:39:55.988 --> 01:40:06.020]  What can we do, what should we do in this country to protect ourselves instead of just trying to score political points as we see being done by the CIA and by the mainstream media?
[01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:11.146]  Well, I think the first thing we have to do is accept the fact that we are vulnerable.
[01:40:12.292 --> 01:40:21.374]  The reason I ran for president in the Libertarian Party, I mean, you know, I know, everybody knows, I could not possibly be president with the baggage that I carry.
[01:40:21.714 --> 01:40:34.297]  However, it gave me a platform from which I could speak about something extremely important, which is America's lack of cyber security, lack of cyber awareness.
[01:40:34.677 --> 01:40:37.218]  We are bamboozled by our government.
[01:40:37.834 --> 01:41:01.999]  They can put out these 25 page reports and suddenly every news agency except for the places like Alex Jones or RT where I was talking last night, everybody's just repeating it as if it's true without thinking it through, without understanding the basic precepts of cybersecurity and what is possible and what is not possible.
[01:41:02.691 --> 01:41:08.057]  And what is in this report, this 25-page report, is simply not possible.
[01:41:09.002 --> 01:41:12.884]  Now, the only people who understand that are the cyber security specialists.
[01:41:13.305 --> 01:41:14.285]  But who listens to us?
[01:41:14.766 --> 01:41:17.347]  Has anybody called me in from mainstream media?
[01:41:17.747 --> 01:41:24.932]  I've been on RT twice, I've been on London Radio, International Business Times in London, but here in America?
[01:41:25.392 --> 01:41:25.832]  Nobody.
[01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:26.613]  Why?
[01:41:26.993 --> 01:41:34.358]  Because my narrative denies the main narrative that the mainstream media is pushing.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.520]  And that's what we've seen for a very long time.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.002]  We've seen this since the Kennedy assassination.
[01:41:40.222 --> 01:41:50.585]  Anybody that questions the official government story is immediately categorized as a conspiracy theorist, a tinfoil hat, paranoid individual.
[01:41:50.665 --> 01:41:51.565]  Don't listen to them.
[01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:53.606]  They're not saying the same thing that everybody else is doing.
[01:41:53.646 --> 01:41:54.606]  And that worked for them.
[01:41:55.006 --> 01:42:04.450]  For a very long time, when we only had three TV networks, because all three of the TV networks were dutifully doing exactly what the government and the CIA wanted them to do.
[01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:09.972]  They even had a program they called Operation Mockingbird that the CIA ran to bring these people in.
[01:42:10.312 --> 01:42:16.355]  But then, once you started to get a more vibrant, more diverse information landscape with the Internet,
[01:42:16.915 --> 01:42:25.481]  Then, people started getting different bits of information, and common sense started kicking in, and people said, wait a minute, there isn't just one single story, there are other stories out here.
[01:42:25.882 --> 01:42:31.205]  We have been, for a long time, putting out information saying, look, we question this, and here's why we question it.
[01:42:31.425 --> 01:42:35.729]  That's why we talked to you about this, why we wanted to get a cyber expert to talk about this.
[01:42:36.069 --> 01:42:44.655]  You made a great point that if the Russians left all of these fingerprints on there, then we don't really have anything to worry about because they're so grossly incompetent.
[01:42:44.975 --> 01:42:55.139]  But of course, it's to divert attention, it's to tie Donald Trump's hands, delegitimize him during the election, try to take it away from him, to tie his hands when he wants to ease relations with Russia.
[01:42:55.819 --> 01:43:07.963]  But I'm very concerned about... You also need to understand that the intelligence services have a chain of command, and people have orders that they simply follow.
[01:43:09.143 --> 01:43:19.749]  And if someone comes into your office and says, we have information, we can't divulge where we got it, where the Russians are hacking our election, we need you to verify this.
[01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:21.470]  Well, that's your job.
[01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:25.032]  You're going to try to come up with whatever you can, no matter how absurd.
[01:43:25.052 --> 01:43:32.356]  I mean, we can't blame our intelligence services, because this is a politicized operation.
[01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:35.778]  And who do most of the covert agencies report to?
[01:43:36.624 --> 01:43:39.186]  The executive branch of the government.
[01:43:39.906 --> 01:43:40.847]  President Obama.
[01:43:41.627 --> 01:43:47.211]  So, you know, you're risking your job if you buck the train.
[01:43:47.231 --> 01:43:52.394]  If you say, well, what I found out is that they didn't hack it.
[01:43:52.914 --> 01:43:53.955]  Well, what's going to happen to you?
[01:43:53.975 --> 01:43:56.236]  You're going to be demoted, at least.
[01:43:56.637 --> 01:43:57.617]  You're going to be ignored.
[01:43:57.637 --> 01:43:58.818]  You're going to be shoved aside.
[01:43:59.278 --> 01:44:00.159]  You may be fired.
[01:44:00.819 --> 01:44:03.581]  So you cannot blame all of these people.
[01:44:04.001 --> 01:44:05.002]  They're in a tight spot.
[01:44:05.757 --> 01:44:10.361]  It is a politicized process in which we are all entrapped.
[01:44:10.901 --> 01:44:12.262]  Yes, it's a very politicized process.
[01:44:12.282 --> 01:44:14.004]  They have something that they want to hear.
[01:44:14.664 --> 01:44:17.546]  And the intelligence services know that that's what they want to hear.
[01:44:18.147 --> 01:44:24.432]  And we had recently, we had one of the people who briefed George Bush about the interrogation of Saddam Hussein.
[01:44:25.072 --> 01:44:25.693]  We're good to go.
[01:44:46.731 --> 01:44:55.839]  Same thing we're hearing now about the Russian hack, quote-unquote, and yet the intelligence services were telling them that because they knew that's what George Bush wanted to hear.
[01:44:55.919 --> 01:44:57.540]  They knew that's what Colin Powell wanted to hear.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:00.002]  Because they all reported to George Bush.
[01:45:00.703 --> 01:45:03.445]  They had their jobs because of George Bush.
[01:45:03.805 --> 01:45:07.128]  George Bush had the power to fire them all.
[01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:08.649]  Understand this.
[01:45:09.129 --> 01:45:14.754]  So that if the intelligence services understand that their president demands
[01:45:15.134 --> 01:45:21.336]  Specific intelligence and that's the intelligence they're going to give him for self-preservation
[01:45:21.992 --> 01:45:29.715]  I mean, some of these people are making a lot of money, and have homes that they have to pay for, and children they're putting through college, and have to feed themselves.
[01:45:30.355 --> 01:45:31.516]  You can't blame them all.
[01:45:31.756 --> 01:45:34.617]  Oh yeah, it's absolutely, it's a career, and that's the interesting thing about it.
[01:45:34.637 --> 01:45:44.181]  You know, we go back to looking at World War II, I thought it was interesting, Donald Trump says one of the things he's going to do is bring back the bust of Churchill that Barack Obama got rid of.
[01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:48.543]  I thought that was interesting, I tweet out, Winston Churchill is going to be joining the Trump transition team.
[01:45:49.003 --> 01:45:54.567]  But one of the things that Winston Churchill did in the lead up to World War II, he had his own intelligence sources.
[01:45:54.947 --> 01:46:03.832]  And his intelligence sources were telling him very different things than the politicized intelligence sources were telling the people in government at the time.
[01:46:04.773 --> 01:46:06.534]  And so I think that is a very key thing.
[01:46:06.674 --> 01:46:09.016]  I think Trump is nobody's fool.
[01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:10.917]  He has his own sources.
[01:46:11.297 --> 01:46:12.758]  He has an independent mind.
[01:46:12.778 --> 01:46:18.421]  And I think, do we have this clip, guys, where Donald Trump was asked if he trusted intelligence officials?
[01:46:18.441 --> 01:46:19.041]  Do we have that ready?
[01:46:21.483 --> 01:46:22.543]  Okay, we don't have that yet.
[01:46:22.623 --> 01:46:27.126]  Okay, but we do have a point during this news clip where they asked him about that.
[01:46:27.646 --> 01:46:28.227]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:46:28.247 --> 01:46:30.608]  I think that Donald Trump is clever enough.
[01:46:31.272 --> 01:46:41.318]  To have his own intelligence community outside of the structured community of the NSA, CIA, the FBI, and so on.
[01:46:42.098 --> 01:46:47.021]  He would be crazy not to, given the history that we've seen.
[01:46:47.041 --> 01:46:55.646]  Our entire intelligence services all agreeing that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:46:56.286 --> 01:46:59.428]  The entire intelligence community all agreeing
[01:47:00.126 --> 01:47:04.268]  With high probability that Russia hacked the DNC.
[01:47:04.468 --> 01:47:09.431]  Now, by the way, what was interesting to me is the one holdout was the NSA.
[01:47:10.192 --> 01:47:18.496]  Who instead of saying very high probability, they say, well, with moderate probability, we believe the Russians hacked the DNC.
[01:47:18.736 --> 01:47:20.297]  Well, you know what that says?
[01:47:20.357 --> 01:47:20.997]  Well, okay.
[01:47:21.237 --> 01:47:23.679]  So at least there's some degree of courage.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:27.982]  They're essentially saying, well, it could have happened.
[01:47:28.102 --> 01:47:30.284]  I don't think it necessarily did.
[01:47:30.344 --> 01:47:32.206]  But really, that was the only holdout.
[01:47:32.226 --> 01:47:36.930]  And it was only from high probability to moderate.
[01:47:37.511 --> 01:47:39.512]  Well, I appreciate that one little thing.
[01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:44.857]  It tells me that at least somebody within the SA is going, hey, this is crazy, people.
[01:47:45.473 --> 01:47:46.214]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:47:46.434 --> 01:48:01.063]  And when we talk about the politicization of the intelligence agencies, you know, Donald Trump had that tweet that's now very famous, the, as he put it, quote, intelligence, he put intelligence in quote, the intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking, quote unquote.
[01:48:01.658 --> 01:48:05.400]  Was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.040]  Very strange.
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:07.561]  In other words, I don't believe any of this stuff.
[01:48:07.601 --> 01:48:11.903]  And I think what was even more interesting about that is the reaction of Chuckie Schumer.
[01:48:12.263 --> 01:48:19.687]  Went on the Rachel Maddow Show and Chuck Schumer said, let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community and have six ways from Sunday to get back at you.
[01:48:19.707 --> 01:48:24.549]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[01:48:25.209 --> 01:48:27.230]  And she said, well, what do you think they're going to do?
[01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:28.611]  And he goes, well, I don't know.
[01:48:29.011 --> 01:48:32.993]  But from what I'm told, they are very upset with how he's treated them and talked about them.
[01:48:33.033 --> 01:48:40.696]  And so now here we have this disgusting story that they've floated around with their sources at CNN and BuzzFeed.
[01:48:41.016 --> 01:48:44.998]  That's the way that's one of the six ways or more that they can come after you, isn't it?
[01:48:46.438 --> 01:48:47.179]  But look at me.
[01:48:47.739 --> 01:48:54.382]  I mean, I'm constantly trashing our intelligence services with all due respect to you as intelligence people.
[01:48:54.989 --> 01:48:58.350]  Because you have not kept up with the times.
[01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:01.231]  Now, Donald Trump is president-elect.
[01:49:01.551 --> 01:49:02.731]  He can protect himself.
[01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:03.951]  What about me?
[01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:07.052]  I'm sitting alone in a home in the country.
[01:49:07.652 --> 01:49:09.172]  What do you think could happen to me?
[01:49:09.533 --> 01:49:20.875]  In all seriousness, do you think that just because we are in America that people are not disappeared, scheduled for suicide, or insanity, or God knows what?
[01:49:21.615 --> 01:49:23.716]  And yet I am speaking out because
[01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:26.504]  I love this country.
[01:49:27.585 --> 01:49:30.429]  I am the prototypical patriot.
[01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:33.293]  I am the embodiment of the American dream.
[01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:38.010]  Absolutely.
[01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:45.592]  It takes a lot of guts to do what you did, and you stood up and you spoke out, and as you point out, you don't have the protection of many politicians do.
[01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.452]  You've got a new website, it's MGTCI.com.
[01:49:47.852 --> 01:49:48.392]  What is that, John?
[01:49:48.432 --> 01:49:48.912]  People can find it.
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:07.621]  The state-of-the-art new security system.
[01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:10.501]  The old paradigm of anti-virus software is dead.
[01:50:10.942 --> 01:50:11.682]  I created it.
[01:50:11.842 --> 01:50:12.482]  I should know.
[01:50:13.482 --> 01:50:26.985]  The reason we have had all of these hacks with the Office of Personnel Management, the FBI, Homeland Security, they were all protected by the state-of-the-art software and it didn't help.
[01:50:27.728 --> 01:50:37.863]  At MGT, we are developing a new paradigm that will, in fact, give protection not just to the average American, but to the American government as well.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:43.521]  That's very important, because as you're just saying, as an individual patriot, you are at risk.
[01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:45.541]  Not just Donald Trump, but you're at risk also.
[01:50:45.661 --> 01:50:48.222]  And you know, everybody is at risk for being hacked.
[01:50:48.302 --> 01:50:54.103]  Everybody is at risk for having their identity stolen, for having false information planted about them.
[01:50:54.383 --> 01:50:59.284]  So that's something everybody should be concerned about, and they can find out more about that at MGTCI.com.
[01:50:59.304 --> 01:51:00.744]  Thank you so much, John McAfee.
[01:51:01.084 --> 01:51:01.344]  Thank you.
[01:51:01.384 --> 01:51:02.785]  You really are a true patriot.
[01:51:02.825 --> 01:51:04.185]  Thank you for breaking that down for us.
[01:51:04.525 --> 01:51:05.430]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.852]  Stay with us.
[01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:08.666]  We've got some more clips from the Trump press conference.
[01:51:08.686 --> 01:51:09.309]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:09.605 --> 01:51:10.806]  Wars are not cheap.
[01:51:11.547 --> 01:51:15.430]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[01:51:16.091 --> 01:51:18.894]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[01:51:19.454 --> 01:51:20.475]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[01:51:20.495 --> 01:51:21.956]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[01:51:22.577 --> 01:51:29.383]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[01:51:29.724 --> 01:51:34.048]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[01:51:34.668 --> 01:51:44.456]  That's why on major third-party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[01:51:44.696 --> 01:51:56.385]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[01:51:56.805 --> 01:51:58.326]  We apply to the prize we bring.
[01:51:59.367 --> 01:52:05.756]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[01:52:06.357 --> 01:52:10.703]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:11.985]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[01:52:12.005 --> 01:52:14.488]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.409]  I think so.
[01:52:33.078 --> 01:52:34.338]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[01:52:34.759 --> 01:52:35.739]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[01:52:35.759 --> 01:52:37.399]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[01:52:37.419 --> 01:52:38.020]  I was in great shape.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.120]  I'm dedicated to fighting the Globeless.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:44.242]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[01:52:44.442 --> 01:52:46.022]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[01:52:46.042 --> 01:52:48.643]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[01:52:48.823 --> 01:52:53.525]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing.
[01:52:54.185 --> 01:53:04.809]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it, 170-plus studies.
[01:53:04.829 --> 01:53:05.809]  We can make claims on this.
[01:53:05.829 --> 01:53:11.912]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[01:53:12.692 --> 01:53:14.514]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[01:53:14.574 --> 01:53:15.354]  I forget to take it.
[01:53:15.374 --> 01:53:16.295]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[01:53:16.335 --> 01:53:18.197]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[01:53:18.277 --> 01:53:20.458]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[01:53:20.919 --> 01:53:21.479]  Well, guess what?
[01:53:21.519 --> 01:53:22.760]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:23.741]  It's discounted.
[01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:27.023]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[01:53:27.043 --> 01:53:28.465]  A lot of the products we have left
[01:53:29.005 --> 01:53:33.768]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[01:53:34.148 --> 01:53:38.891]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[01:53:39.251 --> 01:53:41.072]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[01:53:41.773 --> 01:53:43.594]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[01:53:43.754 --> 01:53:44.914]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[01:53:45.135 --> 01:53:46.755]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[01:53:47.096 --> 01:53:50.117]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[01:53:50.398 --> 01:53:51.598]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[01:53:51.959 --> 01:53:53.820]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:58.243]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists.
[01:53:58.263 --> 01:54:06.730]  So I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:08.031]  Make our bodies great again.
[01:54:16.237 --> 01:54:17.698]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.718 --> 01:54:23.303]  I'm David Knight and we're going to play you some clips about how Donald Trump stood up to the fake news.
[01:54:24.738 --> 01:54:40.255]  Here, as the news press conference began, we had Pence, Vice President-elect Pence, say, you know, we were going to talk to you about some conflict of interest issues that are very important, because that's going to be another way that they're going to attack Donald Trump.
[01:54:40.675 --> 01:54:50.219]  But then, of course, in the final days, just days before Donald Trump becomes president, just hours before the press conference, we're going to talk to you about this complicated situation with conflict of interest.
[01:54:50.239 --> 01:54:50.759]  Because you know what?
[01:54:51.139 --> 01:54:53.000]  Donald Trump isn't a community organizer.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.420]  He actually did things in his life.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:55:01.083]  He's actually got a lot of businesses, a lot of diverse businesses that you just can't roll into some kind of an entity.
[01:55:01.963 --> 01:55:03.307]  Shovel it off to somebody else?
[01:55:03.547 --> 01:55:05.411]  So it's a very complicated situation.
[01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:06.634]  He's trying to do the best that he can.
[01:55:06.915 --> 01:55:09.160]  I think he has a very good response to that.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:11.766]  We're going to play you some information about how they're going to handle that as well.
[01:55:12.782 --> 01:55:18.344]  But that is what they dumped on Donald Trump as this press conference was coming out.
[01:55:18.384 --> 01:55:20.484]  That was the original intention of the press conference, I'm sure.
[01:55:20.704 --> 01:55:24.986]  Just hours before, they dump out this disgusting fake news story.
[01:55:25.366 --> 01:55:29.927]  And WikiLeaks has some excellent tweets about it, showing just how phony it is.
[01:55:29.967 --> 01:55:31.008]  They said, look, we've been 100% right.
[01:55:32.388 --> 01:55:33.289]  And what we have reported.
[01:55:33.329 --> 01:55:37.172]  This is a dodgy dossier and it's absolute phony information.
[01:55:37.292 --> 01:55:42.116]  So we're going to play you Donald Trump standing up, getting pretty testy with CNN.
[01:55:42.136 --> 01:55:44.217]  We're going to be playing that throughout the next hour.
[01:55:44.478 --> 01:55:54.886]  Real quickly, as Alex Jones pointed out when he called in, I've been attacked directly now by Media Matters for telling you that you ought to protect yourself with
[01:55:55.686 --> 01:55:59.351]  Our nanotechnology body armor, something that you could even put in your backpack.
[01:55:59.431 --> 01:56:02.154]  It's small enough, light enough that you could put that in your backpack when you travel.
[01:56:02.174 --> 01:56:06.119]  You could put it in the backpack of your children when they're going into another gun-free zone in schools.
[01:56:06.639 --> 01:56:14.909]  By pointing out that several days before this happened, there was the Florida Legislature introduced a bill to allow people to protect themselves.
[01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:25.918]  After they have been vetted by the government and allowed to carry, basically even turning your constitutional rights into a government-granted privilege, even that's not good enough for the gun control advocates.
[01:56:25.958 --> 01:56:38.428]  And they point out, look, we have these killing zones, we call gun-free zones, or schools or airports, and then within a couple of days, this happens, but of course, Mediaite and, rather, Media Matters and these other people are going to attack
[01:56:39.266 --> 01:56:42.068]  The people who are saying we ought to be allowed to protect ourselves.
[01:56:42.088 --> 01:56:48.372]  So if they're going to allow you to carry a gun, you ought to at least be able to have this kind of body armor to protect yourself.
[01:56:48.412 --> 01:56:49.092]  And a passive way.
[01:56:49.352 --> 01:56:51.674]  How is anybody hurt by carrying body armor?
[01:56:51.714 --> 01:56:52.935]  I would ask that to Media Matters.
[01:56:53.435 --> 01:56:54.576]  How does that hurt anyone?
[01:56:55.316 --> 01:56:58.457]  It just keeps you from being able to kill me as easily.
[01:56:58.517 --> 01:56:59.397]  So that's very important.
[01:56:59.637 --> 01:57:00.857]  It's only one quarter inch thick.
[01:57:01.118 --> 01:57:10.240]  The body armor is field tested, confirmed to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production because it's made from patented form of carbon nanotube technology.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.161]  The lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market.
[01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:15.981]  This is state-of-the-art stuff, folks.
[01:57:16.302 --> 01:57:18.602]  You can find this at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:58:21.817 --> 01:58:24.879]  We've now gotten an emergency shipment in at InfoWars Life.
[01:58:24.939 --> 01:58:30.263]  We're giving you 10% out of the gates to help you stock back up because it's been out for a while.
[01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:38.649]  It's a very, very important supplement that we sell, very difficult and expensive to produce, so 10% is a big discount off of that.

[02:00:05.751 --> 02:00:07.032]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.528 --> 02:00:22.594]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[02:00:35.163 --> 02:00:38.884]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:38.924 --> 02:00:41.025]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:00:41.065 --> 02:00:55.609]  We're going to be playing you some clips from Donald Trump's very testy press conference that was held earlier today.
[02:01:05.559 --> 02:01:07.321]  And very testy with good reason.
[02:01:07.801 --> 02:01:20.170]  He had reason to be very angry with what the filth that they just dropped on him hours before the press conference where he was going to talk about how they were going to handle any concerns about a conflict of interest.
[02:01:20.731 --> 02:01:22.372]  And of course WikiLeaks has put this out.
[02:01:22.412 --> 02:01:23.072]  I want to give you
[02:01:24.079 --> 02:01:24.920]  An excerpt from this.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.302]  This was tweeted out by WikiLeaks.
[02:01:26.322 --> 02:01:35.433]  They said, here's an excerpt from the pseudo-intelligence report that was leaked, quote-unquote, to BuzzFeed, who published it just ahead of Trump's press conference.
[02:01:36.074 --> 02:01:40.199]  And this is the excerpt that they pulled out of the so-called intelligence report.
[02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:48.161]  They say, finally, regarding Trump's claimed minimal investment profile in Russia, a separate source with direct knowledge said that this had not been for want of trying.
[02:01:48.402 --> 02:01:52.223]  Trump's previous efforts had included exploring the real estate sector in St.
[02:01:52.263 --> 02:01:53.363]  Petersburg as well as Moscow.
[02:01:53.383 --> 02:02:03.206]  But in the end, Trump, and this is Trump in all uppercase, had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success.
[02:02:03.686 --> 02:02:05.767]  That's their so-called intelligence report.
[02:02:06.007 --> 02:02:12.129]  So it's like, yeah, he's going there, but he couldn't make any business deals, so in the end he just had to settle for services from local prostitutes.
[02:02:12.609 --> 02:02:13.429]  What a joke!
[02:02:14.529 --> 02:02:17.190]  And WikiLeaks points out, we have been 100% accurate.
[02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:18.711]  And they have been.
[02:02:18.811 --> 02:02:27.093]  Nobody has ever questioned the information that WikiLeaks put out from the DNC, from Podesta's emails, the information about Hillary Clinton or any of these people.
[02:02:27.313 --> 02:02:30.074]  Nobody has ever questioned the veracity of that, the accuracy of that.
[02:02:30.554 --> 02:02:33.875]  Instead, they have tried to divert people's attention from it.
[02:02:34.744 --> 02:02:36.665]  With looking at who did this?
[02:02:36.765 --> 02:02:37.785]  Oh, I think the Russians did it.
[02:02:37.825 --> 02:02:38.785]  Bad guys did this.
[02:02:39.646 --> 02:02:42.187]  It's like, you're just making the Russians look good when you say that.
[02:02:42.547 --> 02:02:43.927]  Sorry, Lindsey Graham, but they are.
[02:02:44.427 --> 02:02:48.789]  Whoever released the truth about Hillary Clinton did everyone a favor on it.
[02:02:48.849 --> 02:02:53.970]  But as they pointed out, you know, nobody ever questioned the authenticity of the information.
[02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:59.392]  They just tried to divert attention from it, as they always do when whistleblowers leak crimes out there.
[02:02:59.432 --> 02:03:01.953]  But this is absolute, total garbage.
[02:03:02.593 --> 02:03:03.854]  And it's coming from people who
[02:03:04.754 --> 02:03:10.017]  Earlier today we saw Daily Caller said BuzzFeed editors were crying during Obama's speech yesterday.
[02:03:10.037 --> 02:03:12.839]  He gave this long, torturous farewell speech.
[02:03:12.899 --> 02:03:16.381]  He just couldn't get off the stage and Drudge Report has it up there.
[02:03:16.401 --> 02:03:18.362]  I think it was 75 times or something.
[02:03:18.563 --> 02:03:22.445]  It went 75 minutes long and I forget how many times he referred to himself.
[02:03:22.825 --> 02:03:23.646]  It was all about him.
[02:03:24.246 --> 02:03:32.409]  Okay, and that's the Obama, but we've got the BuzzFeed editors who absolutely dearly love Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[02:03:32.429 --> 02:03:35.570]  They tweeted they were crying as Barack Obama delivered his farewell address.
[02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:44.413]  It was just a few hours after they published an unverified report by an alleged former British spy that claimed that President-elect had performed lewd acts with prostitutes.
[02:03:44.453 --> 02:03:45.453]  Here's some of the things they said.
[02:03:45.954 --> 02:03:49.155]  BuzzFeed senior editor Lara Parker tweeted, will I ever stop crying?
[02:03:49.855 --> 02:03:50.235]  Another one.
[02:03:50.676 --> 02:03:54.338]  Tanya Chen, an editor at the outlet, tweeted, I'm crying.
[02:03:54.699 --> 02:03:58.041]  This is the saddest series finale shown ever on television.
[02:03:58.101 --> 02:03:58.521]  Another one.
[02:03:58.962 --> 02:04:02.925]  Elamim Abdel Mahmoud wrote, and tears.
[02:04:03.005 --> 02:04:03.345]  Another one.
[02:04:03.365 --> 02:04:06.948]  Jessica Lima, BuzzFeed Spanish editor, tweeted, yep, I'm crying, I can't stop.
[02:04:07.168 --> 02:04:14.813]  The site's executive editor said that he hadn't cried as much as he did during the tour since Beyonce's recent tour.
[02:04:14.873 --> 02:04:15.794]  I guess, why would
[02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.811]  I don't know.
[02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:18.912]  Maybe it's the music.
[02:04:18.992 --> 02:04:22.875]  I guess if I actually listen to her, I bring tears to my eyes for a different reason.
[02:04:23.436 --> 02:04:24.897]  These are the people.
[02:04:25.765 --> 02:04:36.488]  That did this, and of course BuzzFeed is really nothing, but CNN has just burned to a crisp any last shred of respectability that that phony network has had.
[02:04:36.528 --> 02:04:51.452]  We've been showing you for years how they faked attacks during the first Iraq war, how they faked being on site at the Sandy Hook shooting and so forth, the disappearing nose of Anderson Cooper, who used to work for the CIA.
[02:04:51.492 --> 02:04:53.173]  We always called him the CIA network.
[02:04:53.873 --> 02:04:55.454]  The Clinton News Network.
[02:04:55.794 --> 02:04:57.515]  That is exactly what they are, folks.
[02:04:57.755 --> 02:05:02.758]  When we come back, we're going to play you some clips from the press conference today with Donald Trump.
[02:05:03.498 --> 02:05:08.240]  He came down on both the intelligence services and CNN, who works for them.
[02:05:08.301 --> 02:05:08.921]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:09.904 --> 02:05:19.152]  The Telegraph is reporting that Barack Obama's farewell speech included remarks about his leadership with an urgent and fearful warning about the state of American democracy.
[02:05:19.333 --> 02:05:25.238]  A warning that resonated eerily similar to the one that George Soros gave shortly after Trump won the election.
[02:05:25.458 --> 02:05:31.483]  The Telegraph is saying it's because of his speech on Tuesday night that's even more remarkable than anything he's done in the past eight years.
[02:05:31.603 --> 02:05:34.065]  He was preaching change and hope throughout those eight years.
[02:05:34.145 --> 02:05:39.108]  He's now ending his, quote, leadership with an urgent warning about the state of American democracy and affairs.
[02:05:39.309 --> 02:05:47.715]  One writer says it was a thinly veiled slay to a divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump's election campaign, which included attacks on Muslims, the disabled, women, and immigrants.
[02:05:47.935 --> 02:05:49.836]  What news source are they looking at?
[02:05:49.976 --> 02:05:50.557]  CNN?
[02:05:50.757 --> 02:05:53.858]  On what planet did Donald Trump attack any of those?
[02:05:54.119 --> 02:06:02.764]  Anyway, Mr. Obama went on to say, if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.
[02:06:02.924 --> 02:06:04.965]  Goodbye, Mr. Obama, and farewell.
[02:06:05.305 --> 02:06:06.546]  Oh, and thanks for the speech.
[02:06:06.706 --> 02:06:09.167]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:06:10.168 --> 02:06:11.829]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[02:06:13.624 --> 02:06:19.289]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:06:19.989 --> 02:06:23.973]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:06:24.853 --> 02:06:27.055]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:06:27.155 --> 02:06:28.316]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:06:28.336 --> 02:06:31.559]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:32.880]  Or more.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.922]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:06:35.402 --> 02:06:36.883]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:06:36.983 --> 02:06:40.326]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:42.188]  It's actually scary.
[02:06:43.068 --> 02:06:53.171]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:06:54.131 --> 02:07:06.915]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[02:07:09.699 --> 02:07:15.861]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:16.241 --> 02:07:19.102]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:19.462 --> 02:07:24.644]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:25.064 --> 02:07:31.045]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:31.186 --> 02:07:34.326]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:34.467 --> 02:07:35.907]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[02:07:36.127 --> 02:07:40.271]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:40.471 --> 02:07:43.333]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:43.413 --> 02:07:44.975]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:45.075 --> 02:07:48.238]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:48.538 --> 02:07:50.860]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:52.101]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:52.201 --> 02:07:54.903]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:55.084 --> 02:07:56.084]  I take this.
[02:07:56.225 --> 02:07:57.486]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:57.606 --> 02:07:59.568]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:08:00.388 --> 02:08:01.169]  We fight the Globals.
[02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:02.049]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:08:15.597 --> 02:08:20.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:26.638 --> 02:08:28.019]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:28.039 --> 02:08:31.101]  I'm David Nye and we have had an amazing news day today.
[02:08:31.361 --> 02:08:40.546]  Just hours before Donald Trump is going to talk about how he's going to handle the conflict of interest attacks being made on him by Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi and how that was going to escalate.
[02:08:40.566 --> 02:08:46.570]  He has a very good plan, I believe, for handling it and he had a lady who broke this down who put the plan together for him.
[02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:50.212]  But just hours before that happened, just days before he becomes president,
[02:08:51.352 --> 02:08:56.276]  Uh, this filth at BuzzFeed drops a load of filth on the nation.
[02:08:57.017 --> 02:08:58.117]  A load of lies.
[02:08:58.598 --> 02:09:04.062]  And of course it was trumpeted by CNN and John McCain jumped in and wanted to take credit for it too.
[02:09:04.542 --> 02:09:05.983]  So, we'll give you credit, John.
[02:09:06.944 --> 02:09:16.932]  And we'll let people see this and see that you're part of this and this should be an end to any shred of credibility that you and CNN are hanging on to.
[02:09:17.252 --> 02:09:19.194]  This should be the end of it for John McCain.
[02:09:19.674 --> 02:09:22.596]  Absolutely disgusting that he would jump in on this.
[02:09:22.636 --> 02:09:24.558]  And of course, people on Fortran were saying, look,
[02:09:25.771 --> 02:09:38.295]  The idea that the Russians had something on Donald Trump has been floating around for a long time, but 4chan said, hey, we put together the specifics of this story, and we fed this out, and it was actually a troll and BuzzFeed picked up on it.
[02:09:38.696 --> 02:09:42.457]  But I want to go to what Donald Trump said at the press conference.
[02:09:42.477 --> 02:09:47.419]  He said, this kind of fake news actually destroys lives.
[02:09:47.439 --> 02:09:48.179]  Let's play that clip.
[02:09:49.959 --> 02:09:55.221]  I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news, and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things.
[02:09:55.822 --> 02:10:00.543]  But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody.
[02:10:01.004 --> 02:10:02.364]  I could name them, but I won't bother.
[02:10:02.444 --> 02:10:04.785]  But you have a few sitting right in front of us.
[02:10:06.106 --> 02:10:07.826]  So they're very, very dishonest people.
[02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:11.488]  But I think it's just something we're gonna have to live with.
[02:10:11.748 --> 02:10:13.549]  I guess the advantage I have is that
[02:10:14.429 --> 02:10:15.150]  I can speak back.
[02:10:16.051 --> 02:10:23.079]  When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this, doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back.
[02:10:23.139 --> 02:10:24.000]  It's a very sad thing.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.221]  I've seen people destroyed.
[02:10:25.702 --> 02:10:28.545]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[02:10:29.066 --> 02:10:30.287]  And I think it's very unfair.
[02:10:30.367 --> 02:10:33.451]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters, yes.
[02:10:34.992 --> 02:10:39.973]  Absolutely, and you know, one of the people that they threw his name around was Michael Cohen, and they said, well, wait a minute.
[02:10:40.854 --> 02:10:44.195]  He's never even been to Prague, where this supposedly took place.
[02:10:44.215 --> 02:10:45.115]  Here's his passport.
[02:10:45.135 --> 02:10:45.855]  He tweeted that out.
[02:10:45.875 --> 02:10:46.875]  He said, I've never been there.
[02:10:46.895 --> 02:10:49.516]  I was in California at the time this happened.
[02:10:49.536 --> 02:10:54.197]  So, I mean, it's a very, they didn't bother folks to check on anything.
[02:10:54.538 --> 02:10:55.678]  Didn't bother to check on anything.
[02:10:56.278 --> 02:11:02.345]  Of course, you're always getting stuff, as a news media organization, always getting stuff sent to you.
[02:11:02.365 --> 02:11:11.014]  A lot of it is deliberate trolling, and a lot of it is people that are mistaken, and you have to check the information on that, but of course they don't, and they don't want to be called on it.
[02:11:11.074 --> 02:11:18.642]  You know, we've gone, in just a couple of days, we've gone from the fake award ceremony that they call the Golden Globes, and if you don't realize just how fake
[02:11:19.082 --> 02:11:20.023]  The Golden Globes is.
[02:11:20.063 --> 02:11:27.968]  Take a look at what Gary Oldman has written about in various entertainment publications about what a contrived piece of nonsense the Golden Globes is.
[02:11:27.989 --> 02:11:33.272]  You know, they say, well, we're going to give such and such an award to somebody, but if you can't show up, we're going to give it to somebody else.
[02:11:34.013 --> 02:11:34.773]  It's about 90 people.
[02:11:35.814 --> 02:11:41.958]  Several thousand people like they have for the Oscars, and of course the Oscars is nothing but a popularity contest amongst Hollywood.
[02:11:42.158 --> 02:11:44.839]  It isn't really about this being better than that.
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:50.223]  You can look at other metrics like the box office, but the Golden Globes is totally phony.
[02:11:50.603 --> 02:12:00.969]  So phony that the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, actually gave a lot of pressure in past years to NBC and other people who carried it, and kind of scared them from carrying it for several years.
[02:12:01.249 --> 02:12:10.335]  So we've gone from the fake Golden Globes now to the fake Golden Showers scandal that has been concocted by CNN and BuzzFeed.
[02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:11.736]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[02:12:11.776 --> 02:12:15.599]  Before you can debunk one lie, they dump some other trash on you.
[02:12:15.619 --> 02:12:17.681]  And this truly is a bunch of trash.
[02:12:17.701 --> 02:12:24.906]  And as I point out in the last segment, WikiLeaks put up a clip there and said, look at how childish this narrative is.
[02:12:25.386 --> 02:12:26.287]  It was beyond belief.
[02:12:26.587 --> 02:12:27.908]  WikiLeaks is used to looking
[02:12:28.528 --> 02:12:29.188]  At records.
[02:12:29.248 --> 02:12:31.409]  They authenticate records before they put them out.
[02:12:31.509 --> 02:12:36.070]  They have, as they pointed out, a 100% record of accurate authentication.
[02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:43.251]  And they said, we do not endorse BuzzFeed's publication of a document which is clearly, clearly bogus.
[02:12:43.691 --> 02:12:45.592]  And we just had John McAfee on.
[02:12:45.612 --> 02:12:54.254]  He was talking about how this so-called intelligence report that is being touted around by mainstream media still about the Russians hacked us.
[02:12:55.054 --> 02:12:56.835]  He said that is clearly bogus.
[02:12:56.955 --> 02:12:58.336]  It's absolute nonsense.
[02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:17.771]  If the people, if the circumstantial evidence that's in there from those intelligence agencies is really true, if the Russians really did leave all of these fingerprints and signatures on it, they're more incompetent than the guy who goes in and robs a bank by writing a give-me-your-money note on his own personal check.
[02:13:18.391 --> 02:13:18.631]  Okay?
[02:13:18.951 --> 02:13:19.892]  Giving his own ID.
[02:13:19.952 --> 02:13:27.737]  I mean, that's how stupid that Russians hacked our elections intelligence report that we got from our so-called intelligence agencies is.
[02:13:28.017 --> 02:13:29.198]  It is clearly political.
[02:13:29.598 --> 02:13:30.899]  They're clearly coming after him.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:35.322]  Chuckie Schumer said, hey, don't criticize intelligence agencies because they got ways to get you.
[02:13:35.342 --> 02:13:36.923]  And then we see this kind of crap coming out.
[02:13:37.443 --> 02:13:42.687]  And let's look at this next clip because they asked Donald Trump directly, do you trust the intelligence agencies?
[02:13:42.707 --> 02:13:45.749]  Here's what he had to say at the press conference earlier today.
[02:13:46.783 --> 02:13:48.664]  Do you trust your U.S.
[02:13:48.804 --> 02:13:49.765]  intelligence officials?
[02:13:49.825 --> 02:13:58.872]  And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?
[02:13:59.272 --> 02:14:02.434]  Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important.
[02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:06.317]  We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo.
[02:14:08.001 --> 02:14:10.103]  And others, you know the Senator, Dan Coats.
[02:14:10.623 --> 02:14:12.505]  We're going to be putting in some outstanding people.
[02:14:13.026 --> 02:14:19.051]  Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.
[02:14:20.492 --> 02:14:22.354]  I want them to cover this situation.
[02:14:23.214 --> 02:14:27.558]  I also want them, however, to cover maybe most importantly, because we're hacked by everybody.
[02:14:27.918 --> 02:14:32.863]  That includes Russia and China and everybody.
[02:14:36.288 --> 02:14:36.908]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[02:14:36.928 --> 02:14:46.630]  Mr. President-elect, you said just now that you believe that Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's emails, etc.
[02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:47.350]  But you know what?
[02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:48.370]  Could have been others also.
[02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:50.711]  But why did you spend weeks undermining the U.S.
[02:14:50.771 --> 02:14:55.452]  intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?
[02:14:55.472 --> 02:14:59.312]  Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.
[02:14:59.793 --> 02:15:00.593]  I think it's pretty sad.
[02:15:00.633 --> 02:15:01.613]  First of all, it's illegal.
[02:15:02.293 --> 02:15:07.456]  You know, these are classified and certified meetings and reports.
[02:15:07.816 --> 02:15:08.857]  I'll tell you what does happen.
[02:15:09.457 --> 02:15:11.838]  I have many meetings with intelligence.
[02:15:12.659 --> 02:15:15.821]  And every time I meet, people are reading about it.
[02:15:17.021 --> 02:15:17.962]  Somebody's leaking it out.
[02:15:19.303 --> 02:15:21.684]  You know, that's amazing to see those questions that are coming out.
[02:15:21.704 --> 02:15:26.266]  You hear the one question, why are you weakening our vital intelligence agencies?
[02:15:26.326 --> 02:15:29.168]  Why are you undermining our vital intelligence agencies?
[02:15:29.788 --> 02:15:30.569]  Who's undermining who?
[02:15:31.567 --> 02:15:34.990]  It's pretty clear when you look at this where the undermining direction is coming from.
[02:15:35.050 --> 02:15:35.911]  It's very politicized.
[02:15:36.131 --> 02:15:44.958]  And the very fact that they would leak this report to NBC before they would even show it to the president-elect tells you that it is all about politics, doesn't it?
[02:15:45.498 --> 02:15:47.500]  It shows you who is trying to undermine who.
[02:15:48.341 --> 02:15:55.627]  And the simple fact is, these are the same reporters who are saying, we shouldn't have so many generals in the Trump cabinet.
[02:15:55.827 --> 02:15:56.547]  This is very dangerous.
[02:15:56.567 --> 02:15:57.888]  We need a civilian government.
[02:15:57.908 --> 02:15:58.329]  Yes, we do.
[02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:00.451]  We do need civilian leadership.
[02:16:00.491 --> 02:16:08.937]  We need somebody who is going to have an independent mind, who is going to question the intelligence that he's given, who is going to say, well, I want to see substantiation for that.
[02:16:08.957 --> 02:16:10.378]  I really want another opinion.
[02:16:10.418 --> 02:16:11.599]  I want a second opinion on that.
[02:16:11.639 --> 02:16:13.420]  That's precisely what we're getting with Donald Trump.
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:15.141]  And I'll say this about the generals.
[02:16:15.201 --> 02:16:15.782]  I said it before.
[02:16:15.862 --> 02:16:18.984]  We've had some really fine generals, even as president, haven't we?
[02:16:19.484 --> 02:16:23.968]  Starting with General Washington, most recently General Eisenhower.
[02:16:24.608 --> 02:16:29.193]  Now, just because you're a general doesn't make you a great president, but it doesn't disqualify you either.
[02:16:29.213 --> 02:16:31.736]  You can still be a great leader.
[02:16:31.756 --> 02:16:36.642]  You learn a lot of things being in charge of that many people, obviously.
[02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:40.406]  You can have a bad general become president, like Ulysses Grant.
[02:16:40.426 --> 02:16:44.150]  He had one of the most corrupt administrations we've ever seen in this country.
[02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:46.393]  But you can have some very good generals as well.
[02:16:46.933 --> 02:16:55.879]  And so when you look at this whole intelligence issue, and you look at the way the press is coming after Donald Trump, that's one of the reasons why he hasn't had a press conference in six months.
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:03.425]  He can get his information out in a way that isn't slanted with these people, but he's also not afraid to take them on directly.
[02:17:03.465 --> 02:17:04.986]  We saw that in the last hour.
[02:17:05.006 --> 02:17:08.568]  We played that clip where he went one-on-one with CNN.
[02:17:08.588 --> 02:17:10.690]  So he's not going back down in a live situation.
[02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:14.572]  He can handle himself there, but they also spin this in the way that they're saying,
[02:17:15.633 --> 02:17:17.874]  Why are you weakening our intelligence agency?
[02:17:17.934 --> 02:17:19.955]  Why are you undermining our intelligence agency?
[02:17:19.975 --> 02:17:37.984]  When it's the intelligence agencies that are being set up as a dark government that doesn't have to answer to anybody, a perpetual government that persists from administration to administration, that has its own hidden agenda, that has its own hidden way of financing itself through a global drug war.
[02:17:38.684 --> 02:18:02.432]  I mean we need to call these people out on what they've been doing for a very long time and I'm quite frankly and a lot of us are very sick about what we've seen from the CIA and these other organizations that have been doing this and we are quite sick about the lies we were fed with the weapons of mass destruction intelligence that came to us unanimously from all of these 16, 17, now 17 intelligence agencies and so consensus
[02:18:03.112 --> 02:18:04.153]  Doesn't mean anything.
[02:18:04.193 --> 02:18:05.293]  It doesn't mean that you're right.
[02:18:05.393 --> 02:18:12.558]  There was a consensus that Neville Chamberlain heard from his intelligence agency, as I pointed out in the last hour, about Adolf Hitler that was absolutely wrong.
[02:18:12.778 --> 02:18:17.381]  Winston Churchill had his own intelligence network and he knew what was going on there.
[02:18:17.781 --> 02:18:21.683]  And of course Winston Churchill is now, as I pointed out, part of the Trump transition team.
[02:18:21.963 --> 02:18:25.586]  He will be coming back into the Oval Office as a bust.
[02:18:26.046 --> 02:18:29.068]  And so it's a Churchill or bust coming back in.
[02:18:29.648 --> 02:18:32.993]  Let's take a look at another thing that they talked about on the press conference.
[02:18:33.074 --> 02:18:37.941]  We had a back and forth about whether or not Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
[02:18:37.961 --> 02:18:39.524]  Let's hear what Donald Trump had to say about that.
[02:18:40.777 --> 02:18:44.739]  I would say we are going to build a wall, and people would go crazy.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.541]  I would then say, who's gonna pay for the wall?
[02:18:48.161 --> 02:18:53.645]  And people would all scream out, 25, 30,000 people, cuz nobody's ever had crowds like Trump has had.
[02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:56.506]  You know that, you don't like to report that, but that's okay.
[02:18:56.987 --> 02:18:59.048]  Okay, now he agrees, finally he agrees.
[02:18:59.068 --> 02:19:02.450]  But I say, who's gonna pay for the wall?
[02:19:02.650 --> 02:19:05.011]  And they will scream out, Mexico.
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.120]  Reports went out last week.
[02:19:08.481 --> 02:19:11.041]  Oh, Mexico's not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement.
[02:19:11.642 --> 02:19:12.362]  What's the difference?
[02:19:12.902 --> 02:19:14.823]  I want to get the wall started.
[02:19:15.143 --> 02:19:18.024]  I don't want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.
[02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:21.045]  And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.
[02:19:21.145 --> 02:19:23.646]  And by the way, Mexico has been so nice.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:25.040]  So nice.
[02:19:25.121 --> 02:19:27.142]  I respect the government of Mexico.
[02:19:27.843 --> 02:19:29.184]  I respect the people of Mexico.
[02:19:29.204 --> 02:19:30.265]  I love the people of Mexico.
[02:19:30.285 --> 02:19:32.186]  I have many people from Mexico working for me.
[02:19:32.507 --> 02:19:33.528]  They're phenomenal people.
[02:19:34.348 --> 02:19:36.250]  The government of Mexico is terrific.
[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:39.393]  I don't blame them for what's happened.
[02:19:39.893 --> 02:19:42.875]  I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States.
[02:19:43.016 --> 02:19:46.178]  I wish our politicians were so smart.
[02:19:46.979 --> 02:19:50.101]  Mexico has taken advantage of the United States.
[02:19:50.762 --> 02:19:51.383]  I don't blame
[02:19:52.293 --> 02:19:55.115]  The representatives and various presidents, etc.
[02:19:55.255 --> 02:19:55.956]  of Mexico.
[02:19:56.476 --> 02:19:59.958]  What I say is, we shouldn't have allowed that to happen.
[02:20:00.298 --> 02:20:01.479]  It's not gonna happen anymore.
[02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:05.582]  So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall.
[02:20:05.942 --> 02:20:07.383]  But it'll be reimbursed.
[02:20:10.336 --> 02:20:11.557]  Wars are not cheap.
[02:20:12.298 --> 02:20:16.161]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[02:20:16.842 --> 02:20:19.544]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[02:20:20.205 --> 02:20:21.206]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[02:20:21.246 --> 02:20:22.707]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[02:20:23.328 --> 02:20:30.114]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[02:20:30.475 --> 02:20:34.819]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[02:20:35.419 --> 02:20:44.544]  That's why on major third-party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[02:20:45.445 --> 02:20:57.131]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic of the world.
[02:20:57.552 --> 02:20:59.213]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[02:21:00.129 --> 02:21:06.492]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[02:21:07.112 --> 02:21:11.454]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[02:21:11.474 --> 02:21:12.735]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[02:21:12.755 --> 02:21:15.216]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[02:21:15.876 --> 02:21:16.176]  I think so.
[02:21:33.843 --> 02:21:35.084]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[02:21:35.504 --> 02:21:36.485]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[02:21:36.505 --> 02:21:38.787]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[02:21:38.807 --> 02:21:39.908]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[02:21:39.928 --> 02:21:45.013]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[02:21:45.193 --> 02:21:46.814]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[02:21:46.834 --> 02:21:49.416]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[02:21:49.597 --> 02:21:54.381]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[02:21:54.961 --> 02:22:04.725]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[02:22:04.745 --> 02:22:05.565]  170-plus studies.
[02:22:05.585 --> 02:22:06.566]  We can make claims on this.
[02:22:06.586 --> 02:22:12.668]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[02:22:13.468 --> 02:22:15.249]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[02:22:15.329 --> 02:22:16.110]  I forget to take it.
[02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:17.070]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:18.952]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[02:22:19.032 --> 02:22:21.213]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[02:22:21.673 --> 02:22:22.253]  Well, guess what?
[02:22:22.274 --> 02:22:23.514]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[02:22:23.894 --> 02:22:24.515]  It's discounted.
[02:22:24.775 --> 02:22:27.777]  Now in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[02:22:27.797 --> 02:22:29.218]  A lot of the products we have left
[02:22:29.758 --> 02:22:34.523]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[02:22:34.923 --> 02:22:39.647]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[02:22:40.008 --> 02:22:41.469]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.

[02:22:45.893 --> 02:22:47.555]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[02:22:47.855 --> 02:22:50.898]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.

[02:24:21.518 --> 02:24:29.663]  I'm gonna be calling in live a little bit later in the hour, but I just want to make this point.
[02:24:29.703 --> 02:24:33.645]  We're witnessing, as I told you, history on top of history on top of history.
[02:24:34.025 --> 02:24:35.867]  This is a quickening time for good and evil.
[02:24:37.007 --> 02:24:57.312]  And you see the evil MSM of BuzzFeed and CNN, the dying dinosaurs, desperately grabbing on this internet lie that's been out there that I've seen for over a year, mixing it in with some new dates, biting on it, and then having intelligence agencies say, oh yeah, yeah, it's real, go with it, because they still believe they have a monopoly of power.
[02:24:57.932 --> 02:25:03.034]  They still believe they're operating with air superiority in the media, with no one able to challenge them.
[02:25:04.014 --> 02:25:16.185]  And then here comes Trump, not bowing to him, not scared of him, not going under a rock, but saying, you're not a real media, you're a fraud, you're a joke, and you can see them going into total and complete panic mode.
[02:25:17.746 --> 02:25:23.331]  These latest events are 20 times bigger than the lies about WMDs in Iraq, because those came out years later.
[02:25:23.832 --> 02:25:28.556]  The whole media was involved, basically, so they could kind of distribute
[02:25:29.562 --> 02:25:31.623]  The blame over a large group and just kind of hide.
[02:25:32.284 --> 02:25:33.345]  That was the beginning of the fall.
[02:25:33.965 --> 02:25:39.829]  Now you're seeing what was left, little crumbs dissipating into dust.
[02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:43.031]  This is history happening.
[02:25:43.999 --> 02:25:52.744]  We are seeing a corrupt, disconnected elite that believes they're invincible because they didn't earn their power, they stole it, so they didn't come from nothing.
[02:25:53.704 --> 02:25:54.805]  They didn't come up from the street.
[02:25:55.725 --> 02:25:57.486]  Just like so many other elites, they were given it.
[02:25:58.246 --> 02:26:07.051]  And so they've just got giant gaping holes in their logic, in their analysis, in their strategy, in their stratagems.
[02:26:08.272 --> 02:26:10.573]  They don't understand that we don't care about
[02:26:11.784 --> 02:26:13.005]  Ego or any of it.
[02:26:13.125 --> 02:26:14.785]  We're about winning and defeating them.
[02:26:15.486 --> 02:26:16.806]  And we're never going to stop coming.
[02:26:16.946 --> 02:26:20.808]  And it's good to see them go from being completely arrogant to being horrified now.
[02:26:22.069 --> 02:26:29.072]  Because now they're just panicked and running around in different directions like crays, chickens on fire.
[02:26:30.393 --> 02:26:35.195]  I liken it to what exterminators talk about when they go into a house and they spray for roaches.
[02:26:37.572 --> 02:26:43.680]  When they're being poisoned for about an hour, they'll run around insane high on it and start having sex.
[02:26:44.361 --> 02:26:47.625]  Because it's their last instinct is to procreate before they roll over and die.
[02:26:48.767 --> 02:26:51.330]  And I just love to see them blame Trump for everything they're into.
[02:26:52.532 --> 02:26:54.214]  It is true protection at its finest.
[02:26:56.463 --> 02:27:01.724]  I can't get targets psychosis though watching them burn on the horizon like ships on fire.
[02:27:02.625 --> 02:27:07.806]  We don't want to get too focused on the fire and turn into pillars of salt here as we look back on Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:27:08.446 --> 02:27:13.888]  We just have to realize that these are truly despicable scumbags and they will always be disdained.
[02:27:13.948 --> 02:27:14.788]  Their names will be
[02:27:17.018 --> 02:27:19.923]  Absolutely connected to failure and evil and treachery.
[02:27:20.684 --> 02:27:21.706]  They are the scum of the earth.
[02:27:21.726 --> 02:27:22.867]  They are the mercenary media.
[02:27:23.468 --> 02:27:24.149]  They are the filth.
[02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:25.091]  They are the dishonored.
[02:27:25.992 --> 02:27:29.397]  And I've got so much more to break down, but Trump is destroying the MSM.
[02:27:29.418 --> 02:27:31.120]  You're watching the final death of MSM.
[02:27:32.782 --> 02:27:36.024]  You're watching the champion Trump and the people take on the fake news.
[02:27:37.285 --> 02:27:39.646]  You're just watching an incredible, incredible spectacle.
[02:27:39.666 --> 02:27:43.689]  We're going to be analyzing this obviously today and right through tomorrow.
[02:27:43.729 --> 02:27:45.090]  This is a huge time to be alive.
[02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:47.071]  Clips are all on Infowars.com.
[02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:47.431]  Spread them.
[02:27:48.172 --> 02:27:50.473]  Spread them with relish because these people deserve to go down.
[02:27:51.414 --> 02:27:52.495]  They're such arrogant bastards.
[02:27:54.246 --> 02:27:59.168]  Alright, we're going to have some more reports from Alex coming up, and of course we have some more clips from Donald Trump at the press conference.
[02:27:59.708 --> 02:28:02.329]  This is a short segment that we got here before we go.
[02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:14.934]  I was, during the break, I took a look at this Media Matters report that Alex said they cited me directly, criticizing me for urging people to buy body armor after the shooting at the airport at Fort Lauderdale.
[02:28:15.114 --> 02:28:16.075]  It's like, yeah, I did that.
[02:28:16.535 --> 02:28:17.515]  And I'm proud I did that.
[02:28:17.815 --> 02:28:19.496]  You know, they create situations.
[02:28:19.536 --> 02:28:21.417]  Here's an organization, how do they get their funding?
[02:28:21.997 --> 02:28:27.281]  They don't get their funding selling things to people that people can use to protect their health, to protect their children, to protect their lives.
[02:28:27.741 --> 02:28:37.188]  Media Matters gets their funding from a globalist who has made it his lifelong ambition to destroy countries and to create a one world government.
[02:28:37.228 --> 02:28:38.269]  That's George Soros.
[02:28:38.329 --> 02:28:43.953]  And so they come in and they say, citing the shooting and claiming, quote, gun control areas are killing zones.
[02:28:44.013 --> 02:28:44.433]  Yeah, they are.
[02:28:44.893 --> 02:28:53.120]  Knight said, you need to make sure if they're going to take your gun away, if they're going to keep you defenseless, you need to make sure that you can at least shield yourself.
[02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:59.965]  That's why we're selling tactical nanotechnology body armor that was previously available only to the military, only to law enforcement.
[02:29:00.265 --> 02:29:03.927]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:03.987 --> 02:29:04.607]  I'm proud of that.
[02:29:05.167 --> 02:29:26.558]  I'm proud of the fact that we sell water filters to get the lead that they put in their municipal water in Flint, Michigan, or the fluoride that they intentionally dump in the water supplies of most municipal places throughout the United States, knowing that it lowers IQ, charging you to dump poison into your water, saying that it's going to make it better for you somehow.
[02:29:26.818 --> 02:29:30.805]  And all the other things that are in the water, the pesticides, the glyphosates, and other things that you can take out.
[02:29:31.576 --> 02:29:33.478]  As well as bacteria and other impurities.
[02:29:33.698 --> 02:29:34.639]  I'm glad that we sell that.
[02:29:34.679 --> 02:29:41.885]  I'm glad that we have a special on nutrients and minerals that we have put in the beginning of 2007.
[02:29:41.925 --> 02:29:46.288]  30 to 20% off various items that you'll find there.
[02:29:46.328 --> 02:29:49.051]  And also, we have 10% off DNA Force.
[02:29:49.071 --> 02:29:52.674]  It's been out for a while, so to help you get back in stock, we're offering you 10% off.
[02:29:52.874 --> 02:29:59.680]  And if you want to make sure you never run out of stock on supplements that we sell here at InfoWarsLife.com, you can sign up for Auto Charge.
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.821]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.741 --> 02:30:05.563]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.365 --> 02:30:16.528]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[02:30:17.068 --> 02:30:18.509]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[02:30:19.383 --> 02:30:21.263]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[02:30:21.884 --> 02:30:27.445]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[02:30:28.025 --> 02:30:36.007]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[02:30:36.027 --> 02:30:38.488]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[02:30:38.768 --> 02:30:39.988]  This is the best system out there.
[02:30:40.248 --> 02:30:42.989]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[02:30:43.249 --> 02:30:43.989]  This is how it works.
[02:30:44.289 --> 02:30:44.810]  You order.
[02:30:44.930 --> 02:30:45.730]  Customized or
[02:30:46.818 --> 02:30:48.299]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:51.922]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[02:30:52.222 --> 02:30:56.286]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[02:30:56.506 --> 02:30:57.287]  You cannot lose.
[02:30:57.307 --> 02:30:58.408]  You're funding the Infowar.
[02:30:58.728 --> 02:31:05.473]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[02:31:05.794 --> 02:31:09.757]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[02:31:20.026 --> 02:31:27.932]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:31.095]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:31:31.909 --> 02:31:33.769]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:31:55.894 --> 02:32:02.645]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:32:03.045 --> 02:32:03.806]  It's a win-win.
[02:32:04.287 --> 02:32:05.048]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:10.484 --> 02:32:17.369]  President-elect Donald Trump calls CNN fake news during a live press conference.
[02:32:17.809 --> 02:32:19.750]  Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[02:32:19.971 --> 02:32:20.411]  Go ahead.
[02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:21.872]  No, Mr. President-elect.
[02:32:22.132 --> 02:32:22.332]  Go ahead.
[02:32:22.372 --> 02:32:25.094]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization... No, not you.
[02:32:25.134 --> 02:32:25.334]  Not you.
[02:32:25.354 --> 02:32:26.255]  Can you give us a chance?
[02:32:26.275 --> 02:32:27.055]  We're an organization, sir.
[02:32:27.075 --> 02:32:28.316]  You are attacking our news organization.
[02:32:28.336 --> 02:32:28.977]  We're an organization, sir.
[02:32:28.997 --> 02:32:30.558]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[02:32:30.698 --> 02:32:30.998]  Go ahead.
[02:32:31.018 --> 02:32:32.559]  Sir, can you stay... Quiet.
[02:32:32.579 --> 02:32:32.679]  Quiet.
[02:32:32.699 --> 02:32:34.400]  Mr. President-elect, can you stay categorically... Go ahead.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.161]  She's asking a question.
[02:32:35.181 --> 02:32:35.441]  Don't be rude.
[02:32:35.461 --> 02:32:36.902]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[02:32:36.922 --> 02:32:37.202]  Don't be rude.
[02:32:37.222 --> 02:32:37.723]  You are attacking us.
[02:32:37.983 --> 02:32:39.024]  Can you give us a question?
[02:32:39.044 --> 02:32:39.584]  Don't be rude.
[02:32:39.804 --> 02:32:41.886]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[02:32:41.926 --> 02:32:43.207]  Can you stay categorical?
[02:32:43.227 --> 02:32:44.168]  You are fake news.
[02:32:44.408 --> 02:32:49.272]  Trump went on to say that the fake stream news media has destroyed lives.
[02:32:49.752 --> 02:32:52.434]  And all he wants is honest reporters.
[02:32:52.454 --> 02:32:53.635]  It's a very sad thing.
[02:32:53.695 --> 02:32:54.836]  I've seen people destroyed.
[02:32:55.317 --> 02:32:58.039]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[02:32:58.479 --> 02:32:59.800]  And I think it's very unfair.
[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:02.923]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters, yes.
[02:33:03.103 --> 02:33:08.487]  And you can watch more highlights from Donald Trump's press conference right now at Infowars.com.
[02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:24.592]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:24.812 --> 02:33:26.412]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.012 --> 02:33:38.495]  In the last voice memo, I made the point that I want to make it absolutely crystal clear because it's the key to everything and why we're defeating the enemy.
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:42.622]  The Globalists have no natural defense to resistance.
[02:33:43.122 --> 02:33:48.705]  They've been operating with total air superiority, with no one challenging them, no one to call them on their BS.
[02:33:49.666 --> 02:33:55.329]  Now, because they're beginning to get called on things that are so discredited, they want to shut down their competition.
[02:33:56.190 --> 02:34:00.412]  That only proves to everyone that they're absolute, complete, and total frauds.
[02:34:01.193 --> 02:34:08.357]  And now, with each successive fake news story they get caught in, they only intensify the next level of the lie desperately like a gambler.
[02:34:09.017 --> 02:34:15.605]  Or like a heroin addict wanting a bigger injection, hoping, hoping that the great days come back of their delusional narcissism.
[02:34:16.566 --> 02:34:17.647]  That's why Trump's so key.
[02:34:18.007 --> 02:34:27.618]  He's a champion that doesn't care what they say, who's confident, that shows they're a joke, who's already broken their will with the people by being elected against everything they had thrown at him.
[02:34:29.428 --> 02:34:34.054]  The racist claims, the homophobe claims, the Russian agent claims to now pegate.
[02:34:34.435 --> 02:34:38.821]  Next they'll be saying, you know, he's cannibalizing children.
[02:34:39.401 --> 02:34:41.744]  Or he's on an airplane with a pedophile, like Bill Clinton really is.
[02:34:42.425 --> 02:34:43.026]  It's not going to work.
[02:34:43.146 --> 02:34:43.927]  It's all a fraud.
[02:34:45.114 --> 02:34:53.019]  The truth is, Trump is totally fastidious, a germophobe, the complete opposite of somebody that would ever even do something like this.
[02:34:53.039 --> 02:34:53.900]  But we all know it's fake.
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:54.781]  It's been out for over a year.
[02:34:54.801 --> 02:34:57.582]  In fact, last night when I saw it, I thought, wait, I've seen this before.
[02:34:57.622 --> 02:34:58.203]  This is fake.
[02:34:58.603 --> 02:35:02.866]  And I didn't even report on it to counter it because I didn't want to promote it, just because it felt wrong.
[02:35:04.673 --> 02:35:08.174]  But I guess I probably should have just piled on because it's such an incredible victory.
[02:35:08.214 --> 02:35:09.555]  These people are a joke.
[02:35:09.975 --> 02:35:11.996]  And I'm not into just celebrating things to celebrate things.
[02:35:12.016 --> 02:35:19.099]  But let me tell you, we ought to celebrate all the wrong moves they've made and how pathetic they are because these are true reprobate scum.
[02:35:20.059 --> 02:35:22.120]  That again, their whole religion is they're better than us.
[02:35:23.533 --> 02:35:27.536]  CNN, MSNBC reporters, they are trash.
[02:35:28.036 --> 02:35:32.459]  They are arrogant people with chips on their shoulders, who basically hate their fellow humans.
[02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:38.524]  And you look at Kasparian and Sinker and all them when they, you know, lost on election night, all pissed, freaking out.
[02:35:39.084 --> 02:35:41.426]  It's because their whole identity is in their false lie.
[02:35:42.146 --> 02:35:42.787]  This is who they are.
[02:35:42.827 --> 02:35:44.147]  They want to be the ruling class.
[02:35:45.208 --> 02:35:47.610]  But no one in the real world would even want to hang out with them or know them.
[02:35:48.686 --> 02:35:54.858]  From Rachel Maddow to Wolf Blitzer to all these people, they're just despicable jokes.
[02:35:55.299 --> 02:35:56.701]  And they've had the elite behind them.
[02:35:57.881 --> 02:36:01.002]  They've had the big Robert Barron money for a hundred years, funding and creating MSM.
[02:36:01.542 --> 02:36:02.803]  And the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:36:02.843 --> 02:36:05.463]  And we're seeing the collapse accelerate.
[02:36:05.483 --> 02:36:07.124]  This is a beautiful, beautiful time.
[02:36:07.704 --> 02:36:10.065]  And Donald Trump is a bellwether of all of this.
[02:36:10.865 --> 02:36:14.766]  The problem is we've got eight and a half, nine days left, and who knows what they're going to pull before then.
[02:36:14.806 --> 02:36:19.008]  So we're in very, very positive territory, but we've all got to have our eyes peeled, our ears up.
[02:36:19.668 --> 02:36:24.974]  And our heads down, watching and also spreading the word of the InfoWar and intensifying operations.
[02:36:25.315 --> 02:36:25.915]  This is history.
[02:36:25.936 --> 02:36:27.617]  This is 1776 worldwide.
[02:36:27.858 --> 02:36:28.579]  Now back to David Knight.
[02:36:29.741 --> 02:36:35.546]  You know, we talked about Donald Trump in the press conference coming out directly and saying, fake news actually has consequences, folks.
[02:36:35.606 --> 02:36:36.307]  It destroys life.
[02:36:36.347 --> 02:36:38.048]  Well, that's what it was intended to do.
[02:36:38.068 --> 02:36:39.589]  It was intended to destroy lives.
[02:36:40.170 --> 02:36:47.576]  And we need to remember the old saying, I think it was maybe originally Gandhi that said it, that first they assassinate your character, then they assassinate you.
[02:36:47.596 --> 02:36:48.897]  I mean, that's the whole point.
[02:36:48.937 --> 02:36:54.102]  They want to destroy your life, literally destroy your life, but first they start out by destroying your character.
[02:36:54.582 --> 02:36:57.229]  And so, in that vein, we have John McCain coming out.
[02:36:57.250 --> 02:36:58.473]  This is a headline from Daily Mail.
[02:36:58.814 --> 02:36:59.676]  It was me, he says.
[02:37:01.158 --> 02:37:07.084]  And they say, sworn Trump enemy John McCain admits that he handed the smear dossier out.
[02:37:07.424 --> 02:37:07.805]  Okay?
[02:37:08.065 --> 02:37:09.006]  So this is the guy.
[02:37:09.026 --> 02:37:12.889]  And of course, Drudge has a picture of John McCain that they shot when he was running for president.
[02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:13.830]  They lit him from below.
[02:37:13.850 --> 02:37:17.294]  And he looked like this sinister villain from a horror film or whatever.
[02:37:17.334 --> 02:37:22.259]  Actually, the guy is an actual caricature of Dr. Strangelove.
[02:37:22.739 --> 02:37:24.421]  I mean, he gets this kick.
[02:37:24.841 --> 02:37:26.122]  Out of talking about war.
[02:37:26.602 --> 02:37:27.282]  You can just see it.
[02:37:27.382 --> 02:37:29.343]  He gets a rush when he talks about it.
[02:37:29.883 --> 02:37:35.145]  He says everything about him, except the fact he's not in a wheelchair, is just like Dr. Strangelove.
[02:37:35.185 --> 02:37:37.686]  I mean, this guy is truly dangerous.
[02:37:37.746 --> 02:37:42.807]  And I hope that he has jumped the shark, finally, with this and taking credit for it, even.
[02:37:42.827 --> 02:37:44.128]  I mean, this is absolutely amazing.
[02:37:44.808 --> 02:37:50.770]  Before we go back and play one of these other clips where Donald Trump takes on the fake news, takes on CNN directly, I want to play it for you again.
[02:37:50.810 --> 02:37:51.831]  We played it in the last hour.
[02:37:51.991 --> 02:37:52.531]  Very good clip.
[02:37:54.014 --> 02:37:59.740]  When he was talking about making Mexico pay for the wall, the press keeps coming back to him and going, you can't make them pay for the wall.
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:00.942]  They say they're not going to pay for the wall.
[02:38:00.982 --> 02:38:02.524]  Look, there are ways to make them pay.
[02:38:03.430 --> 02:38:07.411]  Now, it is in Mexico's interest to make things difficult for the drug cartels to operate.
[02:38:07.551 --> 02:38:09.471]  So it would be in their interest to have a wall.
[02:38:09.511 --> 02:38:19.614]  It would be in the interest of even the Hispanics who have moved into this country legally to have a wall because it protects them from these violent gangs that are free to go across the border back and forth.
[02:38:19.634 --> 02:38:22.954]  You know, and there was a story earlier today in the Drudge Report, U.S.
[02:38:22.974 --> 02:38:24.795]  Border Patrol is recruiting wild horses
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:27.121]  To now patrol the border.
[02:38:27.141 --> 02:38:27.922]  That'll be a change.
[02:38:28.202 --> 02:38:34.206]  You know, because under Obama, the Border Patrol, not even wild horses could drag them to patrol the border.
[02:38:34.226 --> 02:38:37.929]  You know, we had Obama there, you know, as the immigrant whisperer.
[02:38:38.029 --> 02:38:40.951]  I guess we should say the foreign citizen whisperer.
[02:38:40.991 --> 02:38:43.093]  Come on, come on, we'll give you benefits.
[02:38:43.113 --> 02:38:44.094]  Come across the border.
[02:38:44.154 --> 02:38:45.334]  Border Patrol, you're not allowed to go there.
[02:38:45.354 --> 02:38:46.916]  And Border Patrol was not happy about that.
[02:38:46.936 --> 02:38:48.357]  It's the first time they ever endorsed
[02:38:48.977 --> 02:38:58.084]  A presidential candidate, the Border Patrol Union, was very outspoken about the fact that Obama had prevented them from doing their jobs, and they were very outspoken about their support for Donald Trump.
[02:38:58.104 --> 02:39:04.249]  They want to do their job, and they're going to do their job, and there is going to be a wall, and there are ways to make them pay for it.
[02:39:04.289 --> 02:39:09.533]  If they don't want to pay for it directly, they can pay for it by what happens with NAFTA.
[02:39:09.933 --> 02:39:12.536]  And a renegotiation or just termination of that agreement.
[02:39:12.556 --> 02:39:15.400]  It can be terminated directly by Donald Trump.
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:19.605]  If they want to renegotiate it, it'll have to be involved with a larger group of people.
[02:39:19.645 --> 02:39:21.887]  The Senate will have to, and the House will have to get involved in that.
[02:39:22.328 --> 02:39:23.589]  But he can terminate that agreement.
[02:39:24.338 --> 02:39:24.979]  We're good to go.
[02:39:40.134 --> 02:39:41.774]  That's one way that they can pay for the wall.
[02:39:41.814 --> 02:39:52.677]  Let's go back, though, to this clip that we have from the press conference earlier today where Donald Trump called out CNN as being the leaders of fake news.
[02:39:52.717 --> 02:39:54.317]  Maybe that should be their new tagline.
[02:39:54.357 --> 02:39:56.298]  CNN, we lead the world in fake news.
[02:39:56.578 --> 02:39:57.238]  Here's that clip.
[02:39:58.218 --> 02:40:04.000]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:09.061]  As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage,
[02:40:09.969 --> 02:40:10.470]  Writing it?
[02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:13.573]  I think they're going to suffer the consequences, they already are.
[02:40:13.593 --> 02:40:17.997]  And as far as CNN, going out of their way to build it up?
[02:40:18.978 --> 02:40:24.885]  And by the way, we just found out I was coming down, Michael Cohn, I was being, Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer, he's a good lawyer in my firm.
[02:40:25.663 --> 02:40:28.566]  It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about.
[02:40:28.947 --> 02:40:30.929]  So all night long, it's Michael Cohn.
[02:40:31.409 --> 02:40:32.971]  I said, I want to see your passport.
[02:40:33.392 --> 02:40:35.194]  He brings his passport to my office.
[02:40:35.794 --> 02:40:36.595]  I say, hey, wait a minute.
[02:40:36.775 --> 02:40:37.837]  He didn't leave the country.
[02:40:38.017 --> 02:40:39.058]  He wasn't out of the country.
[02:40:39.318 --> 02:40:42.502]  They had Michael Cohn of the Trump Organization was in Prague.
[02:40:43.422 --> 02:40:45.162]  It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen.
[02:40:45.543 --> 02:40:51.964]  It's a disgrace what took place, it's a disgrace, and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.
[02:40:51.984 --> 02:40:54.425]  Sir, since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[02:40:54.645 --> 02:40:55.085]  Go ahead.
[02:40:55.525 --> 02:40:56.605]  No, Mr. President-elect.
[02:40:56.826 --> 02:40:57.126]  Go ahead.
[02:40:57.146 --> 02:41:00.046]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization... No, not you.
[02:41:00.066 --> 02:41:00.206]  Not you.
[02:41:00.246 --> 02:41:01.027]  Can you give us a chance?
[02:41:01.047 --> 02:41:01.967]  Your organization is terrible.
[02:41:01.987 --> 02:41:03.107]  You are attacking our news organization.
[02:41:03.127 --> 02:41:03.787]  Your organization is terrible.
[02:41:03.807 --> 02:41:05.548]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[02:41:05.608 --> 02:41:05.908]  Go ahead.
[02:41:06.608 --> 02:41:07.630]  Quiet, quiet.
[02:41:07.650 --> 02:41:08.771]  Mr. President-elect, go ahead.
[02:41:08.791 --> 02:41:10.173]  She's asking a question.
[02:41:10.213 --> 02:41:10.493]  Don't be rude.
[02:41:10.513 --> 02:41:11.855]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[02:41:11.875 --> 02:41:12.196]  Don't be rude.
[02:41:12.216 --> 02:41:12.797]  You're attacking us.
[02:41:13.057 --> 02:41:14.018]  Can you give us a question?
[02:41:14.038 --> 02:41:15.240]  Don't be rude.
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:16.461]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[02:41:16.481 --> 02:41:17.623]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[02:41:17.643 --> 02:41:18.444]  Can you stay categorical?
[02:41:18.464 --> 02:41:19.405]  You are fake news.
[02:41:19.546 --> 02:41:19.706]  Sir.
[02:41:21.308 --> 02:41:22.069]  See, that's just it.
[02:41:22.509 --> 02:41:25.292]  They're demanding and telling him what he's going to do.
[02:41:25.913 --> 02:41:27.875]  Now, CNN, you're not president.
[02:41:28.055 --> 02:41:29.016]  You don't control this.
[02:41:29.597 --> 02:41:30.498]  Get this through your head.
[02:41:30.678 --> 02:41:33.081]  Donald Trump is in control and he made it very clear there.
[02:41:33.381 --> 02:41:40.128]  If you're going to come out and make yourself into a propaganda organization for certain cliques within the CIA and intelligence services,
[02:41:40.749 --> 02:41:45.952]  If you're going to be the propagator of fake news, you're not going to get to ask questions at a press conference.
[02:41:45.992 --> 02:41:46.652]  That's what he kept saying.
[02:41:46.872 --> 02:41:47.272]  No, no, no.
[02:41:47.412 --> 02:41:47.653]  No, no.
[02:41:47.693 --> 02:41:48.273]  You're fake news.
[02:41:48.333 --> 02:41:48.913]  No, not you.
[02:41:48.953 --> 02:41:49.253]  Shut up.
[02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:50.054]  Be quiet.
[02:41:50.634 --> 02:41:51.254]  You're being rude.
[02:41:51.594 --> 02:41:54.136]  And he keeps pointing to somebody else and saying, but you're talking about us.
[02:41:54.516 --> 02:41:55.296]  It's like, that's right.
[02:41:55.396 --> 02:41:56.137]  I'm talking about you.
[02:41:56.497 --> 02:42:00.159]  And I'm not going to let you ask me a question because you're not legitimate.
[02:42:01.038 --> 02:42:02.319]  He's going to go over your head.
[02:42:02.919 --> 02:42:06.060]  And this is something that Ronald Reagan always said he would do, but he never did.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.702]  He said, we're going to go over the heads of the opposition in Washington, over the heads of the press.
[02:42:10.742 --> 02:42:12.563]  And he did to a limited degree.
[02:42:12.583 --> 02:42:17.205]  Of course, Donald Trump didn't have the tools of social media and the Internet that Donald Trump has.
[02:42:17.285 --> 02:42:20.007]  Now Donald Trump can speak directly to the people.
[02:42:20.047 --> 02:42:22.268]  He doesn't even need these press conferences.
[02:42:22.628 --> 02:42:24.649]  He certainly doesn't need to call on CNN.
[02:42:24.869 --> 02:42:29.631]  Let's go to the clip where he talks about his employees and how he warned them about
[02:42:30.291 --> 02:42:32.333]  What can happen when they're on business trips?
[02:42:32.593 --> 02:42:34.054]  What can happen in hotel rooms?
[02:42:34.374 --> 02:42:35.435]  He wasn't born yesterday.
[02:42:35.495 --> 02:42:36.296]  He's not an idiot.
[02:42:36.856 --> 02:42:41.640]  He's talked about how if you got anything important to say, don't use a computer.
[02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:43.581]  Write it on paper and use a courier to send it.
[02:42:43.601 --> 02:42:44.762]  He said no computer is safe.
[02:42:44.802 --> 02:42:46.483]  He told that to reporters weeks ago.
[02:42:47.004 --> 02:42:49.245]  And this is what he tells his employees when they travel.
[02:42:50.707 --> 02:42:55.070]  When I leave our country, I'm a very high profile person, would you say?
[02:42:57.009 --> 02:42:58.590]  I am extremely careful.
[02:42:58.950 --> 02:43:00.370]  I'm surrounded by bodyguards.
[02:43:01.151 --> 02:43:02.351]  I'm surrounded by people.
[02:43:03.211 --> 02:43:10.134]  And I always tell them, anywhere, but I always tell them, if I'm leaving this country, be very careful.
[02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:15.776]  Because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you're going to probably have cameras.
[02:43:15.816 --> 02:43:20.078]  I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.
[02:43:21.084 --> 02:43:23.126]  And number one, I hope you're going to be good anyway.
[02:43:23.966 --> 02:43:26.989]  But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.
[02:43:27.509 --> 02:43:33.013]  Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.
[02:43:34.034 --> 02:43:39.899]  You better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:43.642]  I tell this to people all the time.
[02:43:44.824 --> 02:43:49.885]  I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well.
[02:43:49.965 --> 02:43:52.786]  Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well.
[02:43:53.846 --> 02:44:00.208]  And I told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television.
[02:44:00.228 --> 02:44:01.348]  Cameras all over the place.
[02:44:01.948 --> 02:44:04.049]  And again, not just Russia, all over.
[02:44:04.069 --> 02:44:08.450]  This is somebody who has lived in the public eye for decades.
[02:44:09.210 --> 02:44:12.331]  Even before he had a television series, he was in the public eye all the time.
[02:44:13.024 --> 02:44:14.687]  He has dealt with paparazzi.
[02:44:15.048 --> 02:44:18.114]  He has dealt with people telling lies about him in the media.
[02:44:18.875 --> 02:44:22.622]  And so he certainly, as he points out, you don't want to see yourself on television.
[02:44:22.662 --> 02:44:23.484]  He is not...
[02:44:24.417 --> 02:44:25.398]  He wasn't born yesterday.
[02:44:25.418 --> 02:44:27.240]  He knows what this is about.
[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:28.541]  He knows what computers are about.
[02:44:28.601 --> 02:44:33.685]  That's why he knows how to keep this, you know, he's not going to do something that foolish.
[02:44:34.025 --> 02:44:40.912]  He even pointed out later in the press conference, he says, and by the way, I'm really paranoid about germs.
[02:44:41.052 --> 02:44:44.775]  Of course, I would never do anything remotely like what they're talking about doing.
[02:44:44.795 --> 02:44:51.181]  It's absolutely absurd, but it reminded me, remember going back to the debates, I think it was the second debate.
[02:44:51.901 --> 02:44:58.871]  And he had a sniffle or something and a couple of times he would pause and he would inhale and you could hear him inhaling through his nose.
[02:44:59.632 --> 02:45:06.442]  And Carrie Fisher, who just recently passed away, who had struggled with drugs all of her life,
[02:45:07.486 --> 02:45:14.213]  Projected her addiction problems onto a man who is a total teetotaler.
[02:45:14.233 --> 02:45:26.785]  A man who everybody that knows him personally says that he has, because of the experiences in his family, had a brother who was an alcoholic, he has stayed away from that completely.
[02:45:27.961 --> 02:45:29.262]  And he has made it pretty clear.
[02:45:29.282 --> 02:45:30.822]  I think you can see it in his children.
[02:45:30.842 --> 02:45:33.363]  I mean, his children look like they're very successful.
[02:45:33.463 --> 02:45:34.264]  They're very straight.
[02:45:35.044 --> 02:45:41.587]  They have not fallen to the kinds of deprivations that have become very common with Hollywood.
[02:45:42.247 --> 02:45:43.488]  But these people in Hollywood...
[02:45:44.048 --> 02:45:53.560]  They project their drug addictions, they project their sexual perversions onto other people, and there's a confirmation bias there.
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:46:00.048]  These people who don't like Donald Trump can easily believe, oh yeah, he was snorting cocaine or something before the debates.
[02:46:00.108 --> 02:46:00.229]  No.
[02:46:01.089 --> 02:46:18.653]  That is absolutely out of context with his character, just as it's absolutely out of context with his character that he would do something like this, but they believe it because it's the sort of world that they live in, so they project that onto him, the people who are there hear it, and it's confirmed because of their own personal lives, their own personal bias.
[02:46:19.133 --> 02:46:24.935]  Let's go to the next clip here where he talked about Obamacare, but before we do, I really quickly want to talk about what
[02:46:25.868 --> 02:46:30.292]  Before this was taken over, because again, going back to Obamacare, that's something he wanted to talk about.
[02:46:30.312 --> 02:46:39.721]  The other thing he wanted to talk about that we haven't talked about here, and it's very important, is how he's going to deal with this next attack on him, and that is the issue of conflict of interest.
[02:46:40.362 --> 02:46:44.526]  And of course, Rand Paul said, hey, we knew he had a successful business before people voted for him.
[02:46:44.546 --> 02:46:44.966]  They knew that.
[02:46:45.006 --> 02:46:45.987]  They voted for him anyway.
[02:46:46.928 --> 02:46:49.711]  And that's what Donald Trump said in this press conference.
[02:46:51.118 --> 02:46:55.283]  There's also the issue of how does he divest himself from this?
[02:46:55.443 --> 02:46:57.025]  Should he turn himself into a pauper?
[02:46:57.065 --> 02:47:00.990]  Should he burn down his entire life's work so that he can serve in public life?
[02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:02.032]  I don't think we want that.
[02:47:02.642 --> 02:47:11.488]  We don't want to limit ourselves to people who are career politicians and who aspire to becoming lobbyists after they finish with their elected office.
[02:47:11.508 --> 02:47:15.091]  That's what we've seen so far from the leaders of the Republican and Democrat Party.
[02:47:15.131 --> 02:47:23.356]  We don't want to limit ourselves to people who are lawyers or people even worse who have no experience other than being community organizers like Barack Obama.
[02:47:23.376 --> 02:47:25.177]  He never accomplished anything in his life.
[02:47:25.698 --> 02:47:29.981]  So we don't want to make it impossible for people who have earned money
[02:47:31.545 --> 02:47:36.228]  We don't want to require them to burn down their life's work in order to serve in government.
[02:47:36.288 --> 02:47:37.229]  That's the whole point here.
[02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:39.391]  I think he came up with an acceptable compromise.
[02:47:39.711 --> 02:47:46.516]  The woman who explained this said that because there's been questions about what emoluments are,
[02:47:47.396 --> 02:47:57.940]  And of course, if you look at it in the Constitution, essentially what they're saying is, we're not going to let you take bribes and payments from princes and foreign governments, like Hillary Clinton did, okay?
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:00.881]  That was what the whole Clinton Foundation was about.
[02:48:00.901 --> 02:48:13.286]  That's what it was founded on, was her taking emoluments, as the Constitution would put it, from princes, literally, from a Saudi prince who had bragged that, at one point, we've given her 25% of the money that she's gotten.
[02:48:14.369 --> 02:48:32.357]  So, we know that's what was happening with the Clintons, and so to avoid that, we've had Donald Trump's sons shut down charities where they had raised a great deal of money for people and said, I'm just not going to be involved with this because of the criminality, because of the implications, because of what the Clintons did.
[02:48:32.417 --> 02:48:37.739]  They have smeared the idea that somebody in public office would be involved in a charity.
[02:48:37.759 --> 02:48:39.540]  They've painted that idea, unfortunately.
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.681]  That's the legacy of Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[02:48:42.381 --> 02:48:45.723]  So he had to back off and distance himself from a charity.
[02:48:46.384 --> 02:48:59.213]  And then when you look at these other issues, they say, well, you've got hotels around the world, so if a foreign government were to come in and stay at your hotel and pay for the hotel room and pay for the service that you provide, then you would be violating the Constitution.
[02:48:59.954 --> 02:49:00.994]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:49:01.234 --> 02:49:02.635]  They said they didn't think that was the case.
[02:49:02.696 --> 02:49:07.099]  But to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, they're going to go the extra mile
[02:49:07.984 --> 02:49:18.838]  And they're going to say, we're going to take any money that was made, that was paid by a foreign government, we're going to donate that to the United States government treasury.
[02:49:19.779 --> 02:49:20.320]  Just donate it.
[02:49:21.617 --> 02:49:26.081]  That's the difference between Donald Trump and the corrupt Clintons.
[02:49:26.141 --> 02:49:30.624]  And I think that's something that we cannot ignore from this press conference today.
[02:49:30.864 --> 02:49:34.867]  Because an emolument is a salary, a fee, or a profit.
[02:49:35.028 --> 02:49:38.890]  Now you could say, oh well he's making a profit from these people staying at his hotel room.
[02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:42.133]  He says no, it would be from employment or office.
[02:49:42.153 --> 02:49:44.395]  In other words, you cannot work for these people.
[02:49:45.407 --> 02:49:52.795]  You cannot have an official title or position with these people and get paid by them and still be a part of the American government.
[02:49:52.975 --> 02:49:53.416]  Obviously.
[02:49:53.916 --> 02:49:59.523]  And of course you obviously cannot peddle influence like the Clintons were doing because that's just simply corruption and crime.
[02:50:00.458 --> 02:50:01.498]  So there's nothing new about that.
[02:50:01.798 --> 02:50:05.679]  And really, what he's talking about doesn't even fall in that.
[02:50:05.699 --> 02:50:22.483]  But he knows that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and these other people, who have for years covered their trails with insider trading on the stock market, created the Stock Act when they got caught red-handed, like Nancy Pelosi did, and then when everybody stopped looking at it and it got out of the news cycle, they gutted it.
[02:50:23.163 --> 02:50:23.724]  They gutted it.
[02:50:24.264 --> 02:50:26.166]  And so is Elizabeth Warren involved in that.
[02:50:26.226 --> 02:50:36.958]  So, in order to avoid their unjustified attacks, he's going to go the extra mile and donate any money from his businesses where he is not being employed by these people.
[02:50:37.018 --> 02:50:39.160]  He is not holding an office by these other people.
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.521]  He is not selling influence.
[02:50:40.561 --> 02:50:42.363]  He's simply got a business that's providing this.
[02:50:42.623 --> 02:50:44.545]  The other thing they said, and I'll move on to this next clip.
[02:50:45.186 --> 02:50:50.730]  He said, we're going to run this so that he's only going to know if there's a profit or loss.
[02:50:50.770 --> 02:50:53.752]  He's not going to know any details about the way the business is being operated.
[02:50:53.772 --> 02:50:55.753]  And I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to do.
[02:50:55.773 --> 02:51:02.138]  And when we come back, we're going to have Alex Jones joining us and we're going to play some additional clips from this press conference today.
[02:51:02.358 --> 02:51:03.799]  He also talked about Obamacare.
[02:51:04.259 --> 02:51:05.740]  The Republicans say, well, I just don't know.
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:06.421]  It's so complicated.
[02:51:06.441 --> 02:51:07.401]  I don't think we can get rid of it.
[02:51:07.762 --> 02:51:09.323]  Donald Trump said, yes, we can.
[02:51:10.223 --> 02:51:11.243]  It's headline news.
[02:51:11.283 --> 02:51:12.784]  The fourth estate is dead.
[02:51:13.284 --> 02:51:17.965]  So people are just getting, for the majority, those that aren't concerned about getting more information.
[02:51:18.585 --> 02:51:30.027]  So when you hear the headlines coming from places like the Washington Post, you know, it's saying that the Russians hacked the Vermont electric system.
[02:51:30.528 --> 02:51:36.949]  And then you read the comments, and the comments by, for instance, the governor of Vermont,
[02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:40.934]  Peter Shumlin, or is it Shumplin?
[02:51:41.675 --> 02:51:51.870]  Quote, Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world's leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid.
[02:51:53.101 --> 02:51:58.325]  Which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health and safety.
[02:51:58.965 --> 02:52:08.673]  This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling.
[02:52:09.273 --> 02:52:12.736]  Would this guy go to the George Goebbels School of Journalism?
[02:52:13.616 --> 02:52:27.243]  What a little clown of a man, putting out a statement like this, on information that's now, according to the Department of Homeland Security, quote, no evidence hackers infected Vermont power grid.
[02:52:27.263 --> 02:52:29.384]  This is pure McCarthyism.
[02:52:29.644 --> 02:52:36.347]  What this little lowlife of a guy, this Governor Peter Shumlin, he's a Democrat from Vermont.
[02:52:36.627 --> 02:52:37.827]  I want to read you another one.
[02:52:38.248 --> 02:52:38.788]  This is from
[02:52:39.268 --> 02:52:40.469]  Peter Welch.
[02:52:40.709 --> 02:52:47.795]  And by the way, these guys, when you look at their track records, these guys never worked a day in their lives, most of them.
[02:52:48.315 --> 02:52:56.662]  They've been playing the political game from the time... And they're out there promoting that Russia tried to turn the lights out two days after it's admitted to be more made-up crap.
[02:52:57.591 --> 02:52:58.971]  Here's what he says as Welch.
[02:52:59.712 --> 02:53:07.253]  He said the attack shows how rampant Russian hacking, quote, is systematic, relentless, and predatory.
[02:53:07.793 --> 02:53:13.675]  They'll hack everywhere, even Vermont, in pursuit of opportunities to disrupt our country.
[02:53:14.195 --> 02:53:24.477]  We must remain vigilant, which is why I support President Obama's sanctions against Russia and its attacks on our country and what it stands for.
[02:53:24.858 --> 02:53:26.098]  These people should be
[02:53:30.803 --> 02:53:31.784]  They admit it was fake.
[02:53:31.944 --> 02:53:32.625]  They made it up.
[02:53:33.045 --> 02:53:33.526]  It's a lie.
[02:53:33.546 --> 02:53:34.768]  It's a virus on a laptop.
[02:53:35.128 --> 02:53:36.249]  It's generally all over the world.
[02:53:36.269 --> 02:53:37.050]  Nothing to do with Russia.
[02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:39.033]  DHS admits it's all fake.
[02:53:39.313 --> 02:53:40.535]  The Washington Post had to retract.
[02:53:40.995 --> 02:53:46.883]  They're coming out today still being lazy, not getting with the program that, oh, this has already been retracted.
[02:53:47.303 --> 02:53:48.084]  This fake news.
[02:53:49.005 --> 02:53:49.905]  Has already fallen.
[02:53:50.766 --> 02:53:52.587]  Again, Russia doesn't want war.
[02:53:52.707 --> 02:53:53.887]  Russia isn't expanding.
[02:53:54.307 --> 02:53:55.688]  Russia wants to work with us.
[02:53:55.968 --> 02:53:57.068]  They would never do something.
[02:53:57.088 --> 02:54:02.051]  They've had their own airliners being blown up, and they still don't call it terror because they know Obama's behind it.
[02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:03.851]  So again, they have no motive to do it.
[02:54:04.151 --> 02:54:09.834]  It's admitted it's fake, and Democrat governors are running around still saying that Putin did it.
[02:54:16.295 --> 02:54:30.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[02:54:30.242 --> 02:54:32.623]  I'm co-hosting with David Knight in a segment in the next.
[02:54:32.703 --> 02:54:43.548]  And Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, the guy that really spurred Trump to run, one of his top confidants, is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:54:45.101 --> 02:55:03.006]  When the Media Matters documents came out, of course, they were talking about taking out the MVP, Roger Stone, getting him banned off CNN, MSNBC, and other channels, showing incredible Democratic Party control of those different apparatuses.
[02:55:03.506 --> 02:55:07.027]  But what do I keep hammering here as the theme hit me between the eyes today?
[02:55:08.207 --> 02:55:10.448]  This is the further death of the MSM.
[02:55:11.377 --> 02:55:13.678]  The biggest strike ever.
[02:55:14.719 --> 02:55:24.604]  And the fact that MSM is so arrogant that they think they can just put out fake news, knowing it's fake, and that no one's going to counter them illustrates everything.
[02:55:25.785 --> 02:55:31.608]  I know I've hammered this three times in the hour with David and with you, the audience, but just think about it.
[02:55:32.909 --> 02:55:37.331]  Everybody knows the arrogant, mentally ill scumbag who's a known fraud
[02:55:39.386 --> 02:55:40.147]  We're good to go.
[02:55:58.314 --> 02:55:59.135]  They're the con men.
[02:55:59.815 --> 02:56:02.016]  We're based on a track record of accuracy.
[02:56:02.097 --> 02:56:04.018]  We're based on a track record of freedom.
[02:56:04.338 --> 02:56:06.019]  We're based on a track record of courage.
[02:56:06.359 --> 02:56:08.921]  They're based on a track record of duplicitous fraud.
[02:56:09.601 --> 02:56:16.326]  Think about the big Silicon Valley executive that came out and said, Middle America's gross and ugly and white people are gross and bad.
[02:56:16.586 --> 02:56:17.306]  It's a white guy.
[02:56:18.387 --> 02:56:19.648]  These are mentally ill people.
[02:56:20.448 --> 02:56:21.729]  They're completely disconnected.
[02:56:21.749 --> 02:56:27.573]  And they've got such a weird feeling of elitism that they are completely insane.
[02:56:28.627 --> 02:56:33.572]  So the big news is, Trump in this three hour press conference has savaged MSM.
[02:56:33.872 --> 02:56:40.699]  Here's CNN that attacks Roger Stone, yours truly, and many others constantly and never gives us a chance to respond.
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:42.001]  It's always one way.
[02:56:43.456 --> 02:56:49.900]  And notice he's complaining after they put out a story saying Trump is in a room with women urinating on him, basically.
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:51.060]  Total made-up lie.
[02:56:51.421 --> 02:56:52.621]  Been on the internet for over a year.
[02:56:52.681 --> 02:56:53.322]  Totally fake.
[02:56:54.082 --> 02:56:55.183]  They put it out like it's real.
[02:56:55.803 --> 02:56:57.484]  John McCain basically takes credit for it.
[02:56:57.544 --> 02:56:58.885]  That's how arrogant he is.
[02:57:00.006 --> 02:57:03.768]  And then he doesn't give them a chance to respond while he's talking.
[02:57:04.268 --> 02:57:05.629]  They're interrupting him.
[02:57:06.813 --> 02:57:09.495]  Saying, you've got to go to us, you just talked about us.
[02:57:09.555 --> 02:57:10.036]  No, no, no, no.
[02:57:10.296 --> 02:57:14.419]  That was the old-fashioned journalism before you ruined it, CNN.
[02:57:14.639 --> 02:57:18.082]  Where, yes, if you did talk about somebody, they'd get a chance to respond.
[02:57:18.322 --> 02:57:19.563]  But you're not real media.
[02:57:19.923 --> 02:57:21.945]  You don't deserve the same respect, scumbag.
[02:57:22.225 --> 02:57:23.907]  You want to shut Trump off Twitter.
[02:57:24.267 --> 02:57:25.868]  You want to shut InfoWars up.
[02:57:26.168 --> 02:57:27.289]  You want to shut Drudge up.
[02:57:27.630 --> 02:57:28.090]  Well, guess what?
[02:57:28.110 --> 02:57:30.932]  We're not going to physically shut you up, authoritarian-wise.
[02:57:31.533 --> 02:57:33.494]  Everybody's just tuning out of you.
[02:57:34.615 --> 02:57:35.716]  You were already imploded.
[02:57:36.539 --> 02:57:37.659]  You were already a joke.
[02:57:37.759 --> 02:57:38.960]  You were already a fraud.
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:40.480]  And now you're worse than that.
[02:57:40.540 --> 02:57:43.441]  You are synonymous with dirtbags.
[02:57:43.981 --> 02:57:45.622]  You're synonymous with betrayal.
[02:57:45.882 --> 02:57:47.682]  You're synonymous with backstabbing.
[02:57:47.902 --> 02:57:52.523]  You're synonymous with being the enemies that thought they had this country.
[02:57:52.623 --> 02:57:57.305]  And now, the acceleration of their implosion is going to get even crazier.
[02:57:57.345 --> 02:57:57.925]  Here's the problem.
[02:57:59.336 --> 02:58:04.581]  Out of sheer spite in the next nine days as they see their entire empire burn, they are going to pull out the stops.
[02:58:04.902 --> 02:58:07.004]  You think PPGate is big, folks?
[02:58:07.779 --> 02:58:08.199]  Get ready.
[02:58:08.239 --> 02:58:12.362]  The next nine days are going to be more dirt than you've seen the last year.
[02:58:12.622 --> 02:58:13.363]  Watch it happen.
[02:58:13.763 --> 02:58:19.967]  By tonight, they're going to try to change subjects with a false flag or a new scandal or an assassination.
[02:58:20.207 --> 02:58:28.392]  You watch something big by tonight because every bit of discrediting garbage they've had previous is nothing to this now.
[02:58:28.932 --> 02:58:38.377]  This is like a thousand suns to the previous garbage where they got caught lying about the polls and lying, giving Hillary the questions and lying about WMDs.
[02:58:39.438 --> 02:58:41.659]  Everything is coming home to roost on them.
[02:58:41.939 --> 02:58:42.660]  Everything.
[02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:44.280]  And now is the key.
[02:58:44.721 --> 02:58:46.862]  The next nine days.
[02:58:46.922 --> 02:58:47.462]  We'll be back.
[02:58:47.482 --> 02:58:47.902]  Stay with us.
[02:58:47.922 --> 02:58:49.523]  With David Knight, Roger Stone and others.
[02:58:49.543 --> 02:58:51.965]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.445 --> 02:58:55.607]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.893 --> 02:59:06.055]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:59:06.435 --> 02:59:09.316]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:59:09.677 --> 02:59:14.838]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:59:15.259 --> 02:59:21.241]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:59:21.381 --> 02:59:24.482]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:59:24.662 --> 02:59:26.123]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:59:26.323 --> 02:59:30.465]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:59:30.645 --> 02:59:33.526]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:59:33.586 --> 02:59:35.167]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:59:35.267 --> 02:59:38.448]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:59:38.728 --> 02:59:41.049]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:59:41.329 --> 02:59:42.290]  It's in powder form.
[02:59:42.390 --> 02:59:45.091]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:59:45.271 --> 02:59:46.271]  I take this.
[02:59:46.391 --> 02:59:47.672]  This is the product that I take.
[02:59:47.792 --> 02:59:49.753]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:59:50.593 --> 02:59:51.354]  We fight the Globals.
[02:59:51.374 --> 02:59:52.255]  We fight the New World Order.

[03:00:01.143 --> 03:00:05.227]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:05.747 --> 03:00:07.029]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:35.817]  Alright, David Knight is in the InfoWars newsroom studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:00:35.877 --> 03:00:39.419]  Roger Stone is joining us via his Skype connection.
[03:00:39.459 --> 03:00:40.980]  I'm not sure if he's in New York or Florida.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:41.741]  We'll find out in a moment.
[03:00:42.141 --> 03:00:43.942]  And I'm joining you via telephone.
[03:00:44.463 --> 03:00:46.464]  These are such incredibly historic times.
[03:00:47.025 --> 03:00:51.548]  I keep hammering that because we are seeing the final implosion of MSM
[03:00:52.368 --> 03:00:53.648]  They have no credibility.
[03:00:53.688 --> 03:00:59.110]  They are so delusional, saying they believe they have no natural predators in the media landscape like dodo birds.
[03:00:59.770 --> 03:01:03.711]  They believe they can put out lies and not have somebody counter them.
[03:01:03.731 --> 03:01:06.712]  And the way everything they do now turns to crap.
[03:01:06.872 --> 03:01:08.512]  We've all heard of a Midas touch.
[03:01:08.532 --> 03:01:10.653]  Well, these people have a horse manure touch.
[03:01:11.153 --> 03:01:16.641]  So, David Knight, great job co-hosting and traffic copying this amazing transmission.
[03:01:16.681 --> 03:01:20.166]  We've got the fourth hour with Roger Stone joining us.
[03:01:20.707 --> 03:01:22.028]  Again, thank you for a great job.
[03:01:22.088 --> 03:01:23.671]  In 60 seconds, any other key points?
[03:01:24.448 --> 03:01:25.128]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:01:25.669 --> 03:01:39.614]  One of the things that I think has emerged, we didn't get to the Obamacare points, but Donald Trump says he's going to very quickly repeal and simultaneously or soon after replace the insurance issues of people who are left up in the air with Obamacare.
[03:01:39.654 --> 03:01:43.996]  But the Republicans are trying to delay this as much as possible, but he's not going to do that.
[03:01:44.176 --> 03:01:47.497]  He's not going to sit around and, you know, cut bait.
[03:01:47.537 --> 03:01:48.938]  He's going to start fishing from day one.
[03:01:49.949 --> 03:01:50.429]  Well, that's right.
[03:01:50.449 --> 03:01:59.576]  He understands not just that it's the right thing to do, but if he delivers, or even tries to deliver, he will return confidence to the government, confidence to the executive branch, and will restore the republic.
[03:01:59.596 --> 03:02:01.818]  A lot of media goes, oh, it's an oxymoron.
[03:02:01.878 --> 03:02:03.759]  Alex says the government's corrupt, but he likes Trump.
[03:02:04.199 --> 03:02:05.800]  Yeah, I'm not anti-government.
[03:02:06.161 --> 03:02:07.462]  They believe their own propaganda.
[03:02:08.222 --> 03:02:11.445]  I'm anti-corrupt, big, giant, unconstitutional government.
[03:02:11.945 --> 03:02:16.788]  I love our republic, and as Benjamin Franklin said, it's a republic, and I'd like to try to keep it.
[03:02:17.069 --> 03:02:18.149]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[03:02:18.369 --> 03:02:18.850]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:02:19.631 --> 03:02:22.032]  Okay, what an amazing crew back in Austin, Texas.
[03:02:22.212 --> 03:02:24.072]  We've got six clips coming up in this hour.
[03:02:24.433 --> 03:02:28.254]  I'm only going to host a few more minutes into the next segment and introduce Roger Stone.
[03:02:29.194 --> 03:02:37.737]  We haven't gotten to the Obamacare clip yet, but I think when we start the next segment, the most important clip to get to is when he calls out fake news, CNN, and says, no,
[03:02:38.698 --> 03:02:40.220]  No, you never let us respond.
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:41.241]  You're not going to get to respond.
[03:02:41.281 --> 03:02:42.201]  You're not real news.
[03:02:42.221 --> 03:02:42.742]  You're fake.
[03:02:43.242 --> 03:02:46.465]  Is this not... We're going to break in one minute, Roger, but I believe you're there.
[03:02:46.666 --> 03:02:48.307]  I can't see you because I'm on the road via phone.
[03:02:48.688 --> 03:02:50.209]  I believe this is their Waterloo.
[03:02:50.289 --> 03:02:54.253]  I mean, they're still going to have some death rows, but I think this is the demarcation line, Roger.
[03:02:56.415 --> 03:02:57.156]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:02:57.436 --> 03:02:59.238]  I'm delighted to be back with you.
[03:02:59.418 --> 03:03:03.441]  I'm in an undisclosed location in sunny South Florida.
[03:03:05.001 --> 03:03:10.883]  Uh, and this has been one of the most... Wow, when we come back I want to ask you, historically, I mean, do you think this is the moment when MSM finally completely implodes?
[03:03:11.664 --> 03:03:30.791]  Well, through their own hand here, because what they have done is so ridiculously ham-handed, uh, and obvious, uh, and so obviously fake news, uh, that it's, uh, they're just disillusioning more and more of the people who see them trying to manipulate events.
[03:03:31.671 --> 03:03:59.067]  uh... this the entire russian hacking meme that has been the drumbeat first of the clinton campaign and then of the seventeen individual uh... intelligence agencies all headed by a political appointees who are partisans the investigation uh... and rummaging through this issue by john mccain uh... and now news that a u.s.
[03:03:59.107 --> 03:03:59.508]  senator
[03:04:00.308 --> 03:04:05.413]  took what is obviously a fabricated document.
[03:04:06.274 --> 03:04:14.603]  By the way, if the British intelligence agent who wrote this, allegedly, wants our respect, perhaps he should learn how to spell.
[03:04:16.761 --> 03:04:22.703]  This document has these wild accusations regarding Donald Trump.
[03:04:23.723 --> 03:04:25.263]  It provides more dates.
[03:04:25.824 --> 03:04:27.684]  And I'm going to hand the baton to Roger Stone.
[03:04:27.724 --> 03:04:32.845]  He's got a list of the epic press conference today, which is really a routing of MSM.
[03:04:33.386 --> 03:04:36.787]  It's all posted in full wars dot com and stone cold truth dot com as well.
[03:04:37.187 --> 03:04:38.727]  He has basically finished his book.
[03:04:38.767 --> 03:04:40.328]  That's exciting news as well.
[03:04:40.628 --> 03:04:42.608]  This is a big fourth hour today.
[03:04:43.008 --> 03:04:43.689]  This is history.
[03:04:43.729 --> 03:04:44.989]  I keep saying history, history, history.
[03:04:45.769 --> 03:04:49.172]  Because, make no mistake, history is passing in front of us, and we're all part of it.
[03:04:49.672 --> 03:04:51.613]  And that's why I want to salute the crew and everybody else.
[03:04:51.633 --> 03:04:53.054]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[03:04:54.235 --> 03:04:56.917]  And again, on the other side of this break, I will hand the baton to Roger Stone.
[03:04:57.277 --> 03:04:58.939]  I'm Alex Jones in fullwars.com.
[03:04:58.959 --> 03:04:59.359]  Stay with us.
[03:05:09.727 --> 03:05:16.653]  President-elect Donald Trump calls CNN fake news during a live press conference.
[03:05:18.434 --> 03:05:25.400]  Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[03:05:25.420 --> 03:05:29.624]  Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question?
[03:05:30.905 --> 03:05:34.927]  Trump went on to say that the fake stream news media has destroyed lives and all he wants is honest reporters.
[03:05:52.034 --> 03:05:52.895]  It's a very sad thing.
[03:05:52.935 --> 03:05:54.075]  I've seen people destroyed.
[03:05:54.556 --> 03:05:57.277]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[03:05:57.818 --> 03:05:59.058]  And I think it's very unfair.
[03:05:59.098 --> 03:06:02.180]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters, yes.
[03:06:02.360 --> 03:06:07.744]  And you can watch more highlights from Donald Trump's press conference right now at InfoWars.com.

[03:06:54.619 --> 03:06:57.585]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:06:57.785 --> 03:07:01.071]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:07:09.016 --> 03:07:15.177]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:07:15.557 --> 03:07:18.438]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:07:18.798 --> 03:07:23.979]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:07:24.399 --> 03:07:30.380]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:07:30.520 --> 03:07:33.641]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:07:33.801 --> 03:07:35.241]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[03:07:35.461 --> 03:07:39.605]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:07:39.785 --> 03:07:42.667]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:07:42.747 --> 03:07:44.309]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:07:44.409 --> 03:07:47.592]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:07:47.872 --> 03:07:50.194]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:07:50.474 --> 03:07:51.435]  It's in powder form.
[03:07:51.535 --> 03:07:54.237]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:07:54.418 --> 03:07:55.418]  I take this.
[03:07:55.559 --> 03:07:56.820]  This is the product that I take.

[03:07:59.742 --> 03:08:00.503]  We fight the Globals.
[03:08:00.523 --> 03:08:01.383]  We fight the New World Order.

[03:08:23.438 --> 03:08:28.362]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:40.811 --> 03:08:41.131]  All right.
[03:08:44.073 --> 03:08:45.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[03:08:45.814 --> 03:08:56.221]  I'm about to hand the baton to the rest of the hour to my good friend, Roger Stone, who is a very humble man, but let me tell you, behind the scenes, he has been a powerhouse for the restoration.
[03:08:57.336 --> 03:08:58.116]  Of this republic.
[03:08:58.156 --> 03:09:04.919]  Now, I keep using the term history or historical or epic, and I don't use that term because I've run out of words.
[03:09:05.699 --> 03:09:06.780]  That's the time we're in.
[03:09:06.860 --> 03:09:13.563]  History is happening to our left, to our right, in front of us, behind us, below us, above us.
[03:09:13.583 --> 03:09:15.183]  360 everywhere.
[03:09:15.203 --> 03:09:19.285]  This is a major sea change atmosphere.
[03:09:20.189 --> 03:09:21.950]  And basically, it's almost all good.
[03:09:22.690 --> 03:09:29.333]  We've had so much bad, we've had so much tyranny, so much corruption, so much evil, so much pedophilia, just all the lies.
[03:09:30.134 --> 03:09:40.499]  The evil wars, the support of radical Islam has been intensifying and intensifying, and the elites recruited more and more people like themselves into power.
[03:09:41.887 --> 03:09:50.872]  Until we hit such rock bottom that now I can clearly say, and I'm sure of it, and other historians are pointing it out, that we are beginning the ascent back up.
[03:09:51.432 --> 03:09:53.653]  That doesn't mean there's going to be serious battles.
[03:09:53.693 --> 03:09:55.254]  It doesn't mean things are going to be perfect.
[03:09:55.594 --> 03:09:59.336]  It doesn't mean, like communists, we're offering some utopia.
[03:10:00.669 --> 03:10:03.071]  But huge things are happening.
[03:10:03.571 --> 03:10:10.556]  We are seeing the final bellwether of the death of MSM with BuzzFeed and CNN and McCain and the U.S.
[03:10:10.596 --> 03:10:21.864]  Senate running with this fake report last week, complaining about criticism on Russian TV of Hillary, calling that a hack, claiming they have the IP address of the Russians where they did it.
[03:10:21.984 --> 03:10:23.705]  I mean, that's a total frame-up.
[03:10:24.305 --> 03:10:27.728]  All of this amateur garbage, this latest report that's been out for over a year,
[03:10:28.488 --> 03:10:28.929]  We're good to go.
[03:10:44.557 --> 03:10:48.459]  The elites don't believe that they can be beaten.
[03:10:48.639 --> 03:10:52.320]  That's why they only intensify their actions that got them to this place.
[03:10:52.820 --> 03:10:58.963]  The true definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, believing you're going to get different results.
[03:10:59.063 --> 03:11:03.024]  And so that's why they've gone into pure hysteria with nine days out.
[03:11:03.645 --> 03:11:09.367]  There is no telling what they're going to pull now because everything exponentially gets crazier.
[03:11:09.767 --> 03:11:14.069]  So whereas we're winning the info war, whereas they're completely discrediting themselves,
[03:11:18.207 --> 03:11:23.455]  Over the top press conference this morning that should go down in history as the moment that a real man
[03:11:24.538 --> 03:11:28.721]  Stood up against the forces of bullying and disinformation.
[03:11:29.802 --> 03:11:35.886]  The media for decades, mainstream media, operated with no opposition, as Roger Stones pointed out hundreds of times on this show.
[03:11:36.506 --> 03:11:40.468]  But now they're up against opposition that isn't just as big.
[03:11:40.649 --> 03:11:42.009]  We're bigger together.
[03:11:42.390 --> 03:11:44.391]  We have a track record of history.
[03:11:44.691 --> 03:11:45.612]  We're aggressive.
[03:11:45.652 --> 03:11:46.572]  We have energy.
[03:11:46.913 --> 03:11:52.036]  We have a sexy ideology of freedom and property and free association and true
[03:11:52.877 --> 03:11:53.077]  Thank you.
[03:12:05.017 --> 03:12:08.520]  But now they're in an atmosphere where they're actually outgunned.
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:13.064]  Before they had air superiority to drop lies on us all day.
[03:12:13.244 --> 03:12:13.804]  That's over.
[03:12:13.864 --> 03:12:16.626]  Now we are beginning to get the air superiority.
[03:12:16.646 --> 03:12:18.268]  And we're keeping each other honest.
[03:12:18.588 --> 03:12:21.951]  We're a wide spectrum of people of every race, color, and creed who want freedom.
[03:12:22.431 --> 03:12:23.532]  And it's unstoppable.
[03:12:23.872 --> 03:12:25.493]  Their attempt to censor the internet.
[03:12:25.734 --> 03:12:30.698]  Their cyber attacks on Drudge and on Roger Stone and on myself and on Trump.
[03:12:31.565 --> 03:12:39.512]  Only intensify the awakening of good people inside our own government, inside our intelligence agencies, and inside major corporations.
[03:12:39.973 --> 03:12:44.156]  The lies they've heaped on us only serve as badges of honor.
[03:12:45.457 --> 03:12:48.420]  So here's the final analysis, and I'm handing the baton over to Roger Stone.
[03:12:49.741 --> 03:12:51.803]  The next nine days is critical, we all know that.
[03:12:52.283 --> 03:12:55.426]  It'll still be a hard fight after that, but we have the moral high ground.
[03:12:55.947 --> 03:12:58.369]  And I see this as Napoleon's Waterloo.
[03:12:59.395 --> 03:13:00.618]  Hitler's Stalingrad.
[03:13:01.159 --> 03:13:07.935]  What we saw with this weakened, demoralized MSM coming out with PGATE is the final nail.
[03:13:08.755 --> 03:13:09.356]  In the coffin.
[03:13:09.376 --> 03:13:33.895]  There'll still be fragments of the enemy, there's still going to be a serious foe, but I tell you, this is so devastating to see their credibility go from zero to now negative after they lost the election, after they got caught in all these lies, after they got caught lying in the polls, after they got caught fixing things and giving Hillary the questions beforehand, after they got caught with Jerry Epstein in the pedophile airplane trying to put all this on Trump, the fake lawsuits against Trump,
[03:13:34.495 --> 03:13:36.377]  All of it is now blowing up in their face.
[03:13:36.737 --> 03:13:37.998]  It's an incredible moment.
[03:13:38.258 --> 03:13:42.141]  And to see Trump, as the president, say, you're fake news, CNN.
[03:13:42.461 --> 03:13:43.422]  I'm not going to go to you.
[03:13:43.442 --> 03:13:45.303]  And to have them say, but you talked about us.
[03:13:45.644 --> 03:13:46.784]  We deserve equal time.
[03:13:47.145 --> 03:13:52.589]  After decades of them not giving equal time to people like Roger Stone, the clip's coming up in a moment.
[03:13:52.609 --> 03:13:56.011]  I'm going to let him introduce the CNN clip where he puts them in their place.
[03:13:56.031 --> 03:13:58.373]  But first, Roger, do you concur with this analysis?
[03:13:58.513 --> 03:14:00.695]  That's how it didn't mean what they said it did.
[03:14:03.148 --> 03:14:05.191]  Well, my friend, I'm gonna hand the baton to you.
[03:14:05.872 --> 03:14:06.973]  Thank you so much for all your work.
[03:14:06.993 --> 03:14:09.477]  It's gotta be satisfying to see this happen, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[03:14:09.697 --> 03:14:10.679]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone.
[03:14:11.292 --> 03:14:14.754]  Alex, thank you so much for letting me join you.
[03:14:16.215 --> 03:14:18.757]  EPIC, there's really no other word for it.
[03:14:19.037 --> 03:14:24.241]  What has transpired here is the tipping point has been reached.
[03:14:25.182 --> 03:14:38.351]  The monopoly on political information that was held by the old order through the two cable networks and the three broadcast networks has finally been broken.
[03:14:39.612 --> 03:14:50.369]  With more and more and younger and younger voters taking advantage of the technological revolution of getting their information on their handheld device,
[03:14:52.324 --> 03:15:03.250]  They have created an audience, a massive audience, for real media, for people doing real reporting and real investigative journalism.
[03:15:03.370 --> 03:15:15.598]  Now those entities don't have big corporate multi-billion dollar corporation sponsors like the old media, but the shift has taken place.
[03:15:17.048 --> 03:15:32.758]  Voters are getting their information now from a broader cross-section of sources, and when they read Breitbart, or when they see InfoWars, or when they read the Daily Caller, or when they follow Matt Drudge, their eyes are open to a world they didn't know existed.
[03:15:32.898 --> 03:15:46.167]  Now, the mainstream media has gone into spasms, because they see themselves losing control, and now they remove any bounds of what we used to call journalism.
[03:15:48.018 --> 03:15:51.032]  Ben Smith at BuzzFeed.
[03:15:52.540 --> 03:16:12.150]  Really, to his credit, they said in their breaking story that none of this information regarding Trump and illicit sex and the Russians and blackmail was verified or confirmed or if any substantiation or proof had ever been produced, which it has not.
[03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:18.433]  But that did not stop CNN from grabbing it and breaking it into the mainstream.
[03:16:19.213 --> 03:16:27.360]  Wild allegations against Donald Trump, none of which are true, if for no other reason, believe me, I've known Donald Trump for 40 years.
[03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:35.506]  He's much too smart to ever put himself into that kind of a compromising situation.
[03:16:36.467 --> 03:16:39.970]  He knows when he goes into somebody else's building that he's lighting.
[03:16:43.074 --> 03:16:44.715]  So I would never do that.
[03:16:45.196 --> 03:16:49.139]  And this is the wild last gasp BuzzFeed.
[03:16:49.159 --> 03:16:54.825]  I mean, in all honesty, Ben Smith is trying to drive people to shoot videos of kittens.
[03:16:55.545 --> 03:16:57.207]  But this is not journalism.
[03:16:57.247 --> 03:16:58.828]  This is fake news.
[03:16:59.569 --> 03:17:04.093]  And then CNN, the worst of the fake news offenders,
[03:17:05.254 --> 03:17:11.424]  They take this narrative and they try to make it respectable.
[03:17:13.848 --> 03:17:15.431]  What I find most alarming here...
[03:17:16.554 --> 03:17:18.436]  Frankly, is the role of John McCain.
[03:17:19.437 --> 03:17:21.219]  The idea that a U.S.
[03:17:21.279 --> 03:17:35.572]  Senator would go out and get a report and turn it over to the federal government that is clearly a fabrication makes McCain's motives, I think, painfully obvious.
[03:17:37.133 --> 03:17:38.034]  The other point here
[03:17:40.652 --> 03:17:47.103]  If I may, was this circus that John McCain conducted before the Armed Services Committee.
[03:17:47.945 --> 03:17:52.954]  This was, I think, a true lesson in how the agency works.
[03:17:54.464 --> 03:18:13.998]  The CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency prepared a special report for the President that made the case that Vladimir Putin personally directed an effort to hack the American election to the benefit of Donald J. Trump.
[03:18:15.859 --> 03:18:19.282]  And it says, let me read from the New York Post, a great newspaper,
[03:18:20.538 --> 03:18:29.003]  No evidence was presented to back up the conclusions, which officials say that information had to remain secret.
[03:18:29.944 --> 03:18:42.732]  The document's conclusions are identical to the highly classified assessment, including the full supporting information, including special civic intelligence on key elements of the influence campaign, the report said.
[03:18:44.099 --> 03:18:47.481]  So they're telling this, again, this exists.
[03:18:48.262 --> 03:18:58.008]  If you listen to the testimony in Senator McCain's hearing, this is an assessment by the CIA.
[03:18:58.669 --> 03:19:01.911]  This is a briefing from the CIA.
[03:19:02.831 --> 03:19:06.354]  In other words, the guys who lied about Benghazi
[03:19:07.256 --> 03:19:08.657]  Lied about Iran-Contra.
[03:19:09.397 --> 03:19:11.078]  Lied about Vietnam.
[03:19:11.719 --> 03:19:13.800]  Lied about the Kennedy assassination.
[03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:16.482]  Lied about what happened in Guatemala.
[03:19:17.662 --> 03:19:22.886]  Those guys, they say the Russians did it, as if they are honest brokers here.
[03:19:23.626 --> 03:19:28.349]  The heads of these intelligence services serve at the pleasure of Barack Obama.
[03:19:29.198 --> 03:19:31.482]  They are all globalists to begin with!
[03:19:31.842 --> 03:19:33.445]  That's how they got to where they are!
[03:19:41.589 --> 03:19:56.740]  So, you are in this fantasy world in which the intelligence agencies have repeatedly beat this talking point from the Clinton campaign about Russian hacking.
[03:19:56.841 --> 03:20:01.264]  They have yet to produce an iota of proof.
[03:20:03.243 --> 03:20:20.127]  No Republican on the House or Senate Intelligence Committee, people who are qualified to see classified information, under some circumstances, has been shown proof of this alleged Russian hacking.
[03:20:21.527 --> 03:20:29.509]  Now CNN has blown this issue out of all proportion, and I do think that the
[03:20:32.322 --> 03:20:41.728]  The manner in which the mass media jumped on this only days before the President's inauguration is disgraceful.
[03:20:42.669 --> 03:20:45.090]  Trump's performance today was an A+.
[03:20:45.291 --> 03:20:46.491]  I was very proud of him.
[03:20:46.591 --> 03:20:49.393]  It was Ronald Reagan-like in its quality.
[03:20:49.934 --> 03:20:52.575]  It was Jack Kennedy-like in its humor.
[03:20:53.396 --> 03:20:56.058]  It was Trump-like in its bluntness.
[03:20:57.238 --> 03:21:00.899]  He is committed to peace with Russia, not war.
[03:21:01.599 --> 03:21:18.983]  And if he can have a good relationship with Putin, and that allows us to live in peace and perhaps use our money instead of building bombs and missiles to rebuild our bridges and our roads and our schools and our hospitals, well Donald Trump thinks that would be a good thing.
[03:21:19.423 --> 03:21:22.284]  And perhaps we can team up to take on ISIS.
[03:21:23.180 --> 03:21:44.561]  The neocons, who have really been at the center of power, whether it was Bush, or Clinton, or Bush, or surprisingly then Obama, and who the insiders had picked either Jeb Bush
[03:21:45.646 --> 03:21:53.294]  Or Hillary Clinton for the next neocon, adventurist, globalist, American president.
[03:21:54.355 --> 03:22:07.007]  And unfortunately for the established order, an American came along who is a real American, a real New Yorker, somebody with the American spirit of confidence.
[03:22:08.207 --> 03:22:08.968]  Obamacare?
[03:22:09.468 --> 03:22:10.309]  Can't repeal it?
[03:22:10.349 --> 03:22:11.289]  Let's see that clip.
[03:22:11.410 --> 03:22:13.491]  I mean, they asked Trump, it can't be done.
[03:22:13.511 --> 03:22:14.492]  Ask Donald Trump.
[03:22:14.552 --> 03:22:18.455]  Now that, that's, you know, I think a real, an instinct.
[03:22:18.495 --> 03:22:19.315]  Have we got that clip?
[03:22:24.259 --> 03:22:35.186]  You're going to be very, very proud as not only the media and reporters, you're going to be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care.
[03:22:36.169 --> 03:22:40.974]  Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.
[03:22:42.075 --> 03:22:43.296]  They can say what they want.
[03:22:44.378 --> 03:22:46.960]  They can guide you any way they want to guide you.
[03:22:47.381 --> 03:22:50.524]  In some cases, they guide you incorrectly.
[03:22:51.225 --> 03:22:53.126]  In most cases, you realize what's happened.
[03:22:53.167 --> 03:22:54.828]  It's imploding as we sit.
[03:22:56.209 --> 03:22:58.570]  Some states have over 100% increase.
[03:22:58.891 --> 03:23:04.734]  And 17, and I said this two years ago, 17 is going to be the bad year.
[03:23:05.574 --> 03:23:07.055]  It's going to be catastrophic.
[03:23:07.715 --> 03:23:13.859]  Frankly, we could sit back, and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.
[03:23:14.379 --> 03:23:18.541]  We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize.
[03:23:19.822 --> 03:23:23.004]  And we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it.
[03:23:24.204 --> 03:23:30.088]  And people would come, they would come, begging to us, please, we have to do something about Obamacare.
[03:23:31.509 --> 03:23:32.249]  We don't want to own it.
[03:23:32.810 --> 03:23:34.071]  We don't want to own it politically.
[03:23:34.671 --> 03:23:35.672]  They own it right now.
[03:23:36.392 --> 03:23:44.157]  So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in 17, and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.
[03:23:44.798 --> 03:23:50.122]  We're going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved.
[03:23:51.204 --> 03:23:55.906]  Almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.
[03:23:56.806 --> 03:24:00.167]  It'll be repeal and replace.
[03:24:01.087 --> 03:24:03.608]  It will be essentially simultaneously.
[03:24:04.728 --> 03:24:13.531]  It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour.
[03:24:13.551 --> 03:24:17.192]  So we're going to do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff.
[03:24:19.246 --> 03:24:21.107]  We're going to get a health bill passed.
[03:24:21.127 --> 03:24:23.288]  We're going to get health care taken care of in this country.
[03:24:23.868 --> 03:24:36.353]  You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high.
[03:24:37.629 --> 03:24:41.633]  Obamacare is the Democrats' problem.
[03:24:42.414 --> 03:24:45.878]  We are going to take the problem off the shelves for them.
[03:24:46.398 --> 03:24:49.842]  We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it.
[03:24:50.463 --> 03:24:54.126]  We could sit back and let them hang with it.
[03:24:55.282 --> 03:24:57.964]  We are doing the Democrats a great service.
[03:24:58.225 --> 03:25:05.671]  So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan.
[03:25:06.671 --> 03:25:10.675]  And it was actually pretty accurately reported today, the New York Times.
[03:25:11.575 --> 03:25:16.139]  And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.
[03:25:16.519 --> 03:25:23.025]  We're going to have a healthcare that is far less expensive and far better.
[03:25:28.123 --> 03:25:30.006]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[03:25:30.066 --> 03:25:31.929]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:25:32.009 --> 03:25:34.733]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:25:34.953 --> 03:25:35.754]  Alex Jones.
[03:25:35.854 --> 03:25:36.795]  Jones is the wild... Alright.
[03:25:38.634 --> 03:25:40.815]  So, that was pretty extraordinary.
[03:25:41.635 --> 03:25:51.617]  The real point here, of course, is that Trump gets the big picture and he's going to push back against the fake news, against CNN, particularly the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[03:25:52.057 --> 03:26:00.639]  Anyone who is out there trying to dictate a narrative that is detrimental to both Trump and the country, Trump's clearly going to call them out.
[03:26:00.699 --> 03:26:02.780]  Look at this piece with Jim Acosta of CNN.
[03:26:03.931 --> 03:26:09.715]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[03:26:10.175 --> 03:26:18.600]  As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences.
[03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:19.341]  They already are.
[03:26:20.061 --> 03:26:23.724]  And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up,
[03:26:24.696 --> 03:26:26.677]  And by the way, we just found out I was coming down.
[03:26:26.737 --> 03:26:27.598]  Michael Cohn.
[03:26:28.058 --> 03:26:29.639]  Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer.
[03:26:29.659 --> 03:26:30.620]  He's a good lawyer in my firm.
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:34.302]  It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about.
[03:26:34.682 --> 03:26:36.663]  So all night long, it's Michael Cohn.
[03:26:37.143 --> 03:26:38.704]  I said, I want to see your passport.
[03:26:39.125 --> 03:26:40.926]  He brings his passport to my office.
[03:26:41.506 --> 03:26:42.326]  I say, hey, wait a minute.
[03:26:42.507 --> 03:26:43.567]  He didn't leave the country.
[03:26:43.727 --> 03:26:44.788]  He wasn't out of the country.
[03:26:45.048 --> 03:26:48.230]  They had Michael Cohn of the Trump Organization was in Prague.
[03:26:49.156 --> 03:26:50.877]  It turned out to be a different Michael Cohn.
[03:26:51.277 --> 03:26:52.918]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[03:26:53.138 --> 03:26:53.938]  It's a disgrace.
[03:26:54.398 --> 03:26:57.639]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn.
[03:27:12.345 --> 03:27:13.346]  Quiet, quiet.
[03:27:13.386 --> 03:27:14.826]  Mr. President-elect, go ahead.
[03:27:14.846 --> 03:27:16.247]  She's asking a question, don't be rude.
[03:27:16.267 --> 03:27:17.568]  Mr. President-elect, can you give us a question?
[03:27:17.588 --> 03:27:17.908]  Don't be rude.
[03:27:17.928 --> 03:27:18.508]  You're attacking us.
[03:27:18.788 --> 03:27:19.749]  Can you give us a question?
[03:27:19.769 --> 03:27:20.789]  Don't be rude.
[03:27:20.809 --> 03:27:22.170]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[03:27:22.210 --> 03:27:23.471]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[03:27:23.491 --> 03:27:24.151]  Can you stay categorical?
[03:27:24.171 --> 03:27:25.131]  You are fake news.
[03:27:25.271 --> 03:27:25.512]  Sir.
[03:27:26.372 --> 03:27:27.773]  Alright, there it is.
[03:27:28.663 --> 03:27:29.404]  There it is.
[03:27:29.424 --> 03:27:32.348]  Donald J. Trump, the gut puncher.
[03:27:33.309 --> 03:27:35.753]  An extraordinary clip there.
[03:27:35.813 --> 03:27:41.600]  I think it shows you how Trump is going to push back against the media.
[03:27:44.384 --> 03:28:01.988]  Talk to you for just a moment about how you can both help the fight for freedom, help keep the independent investigative journalism here at Infowars.com, which has really been on the cutting edge of the Trump campaign and the inside story of how this momentous election happened.
[03:28:02.568 --> 03:28:06.209]  And at the same time, you can benefit yourself incredibly.
[03:28:06.969 --> 03:28:25.063]  I have recently been ill, which I'm feeling much better, I'm happy to say, but without the silver bullet product specifically, the silver colloidal product sold at the InfoWars store, as well as the DNA force
[03:28:25.963 --> 03:28:27.585]  Which is actually back in stock.
[03:28:28.305 --> 03:28:31.347]  I don't think I would have been as quickly back on my feet.
[03:28:32.108 --> 03:28:33.469]  These products really work.
[03:28:34.009 --> 03:28:34.910]  I rely on them.
[03:28:35.791 --> 03:28:39.374]  In my case, I have taken herbs and supplements.
[03:28:39.874 --> 03:28:45.418]  I've been treated with acupuncture and eastern medicine for 50, 60 years.
[03:28:45.578 --> 03:28:54.926]  I've used a variety of these natural products and I can tell you, Alex Jones doesn't put anything for sale at his store
[03:28:56.118 --> 03:29:03.220]  That he doesn't have thousands and thousands of people saying, Alex, this stuff really works.
[03:29:04.400 --> 03:29:07.001]  A colleague of mine was a reporter.
[03:29:07.501 --> 03:29:09.602]  Because of that he was sitting down all day.
[03:29:10.202 --> 03:29:12.963]  He developed prostate problems.
[03:29:13.443 --> 03:29:15.803]  He went to an expensive urologist.
[03:29:15.843 --> 03:29:20.785]  The urologist essentially said, well there's not much we can do for you other than put you on painkillers.
[03:29:21.405 --> 03:29:27.707]  I recommended Prostagard and his problem literally disappeared in a few days.
[03:29:27.808 --> 03:29:32.909]  So, folks, there are specials on these products at InfoWars store now.
[03:29:33.430 --> 03:29:37.351]  I really urge you to take advantage of a lot of the discounts that are up.
[03:29:37.851 --> 03:29:41.793]  You can help the fight for freedom and stand tall with InfoWars.
[03:29:58.550 --> 03:30:01.551]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.472 --> 03:30:05.293]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.135 --> 03:30:16.298]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:30:16.858 --> 03:30:18.279]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:30:19.161 --> 03:30:21.042]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:30:21.662 --> 03:30:27.226]  At Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:30:27.806 --> 03:30:35.791]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:30:35.811 --> 03:30:38.272]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:30:38.572 --> 03:30:42.795]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:30:43.055 --> 03:30:43.795]  This is how it works.
[03:30:44.076 --> 03:30:44.596]  You order.
[03:30:44.716 --> 03:30:45.517]  Customized or
[03:30:46.597 --> 03:30:48.059]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:30:48.559 --> 03:30:51.722]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:30:52.002 --> 03:30:56.066]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:30:56.286 --> 03:30:57.067]  You cannot lose.
[03:30:57.107 --> 03:30:58.188]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:30:58.508 --> 03:31:05.234]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:31:05.574 --> 03:31:09.518]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:31:10.058 --> 03:31:12.839]  Just where does CNN find their news sources?
[03:31:12.939 --> 03:31:24.544]  If you recall, they first suggested that the Russians hacked the election to help get Donald Trump elected, and yesterday they're reporting now that intel chiefs are presenting Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.
[03:31:24.684 --> 03:31:34.788]  What they're insinuating, directly quoting here from their website, classified documents presented last week, that President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have
[03:31:35.128 --> 03:31:38.271]  Compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
[03:31:38.431 --> 03:31:40.834]  This, of course, is coming from, quote, multiple U.S.
[03:31:40.894 --> 03:31:43.337]  officials with direct knowledge on the briefings.
[03:31:43.677 --> 03:31:44.338]  Oh, really?
[03:31:44.458 --> 03:31:52.306]  What they're insinuating is that the Russians have finance secrets and sexual deviant secrets about Trump that could be used to blackmail him.
[03:31:52.466 --> 03:32:04.980]  They're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took an extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing of documents was to make Donald Trump aware that such allegations involving him were circulating among their agencies.
[03:32:05.120 --> 03:32:06.382]  I can't make this up if I tried.
[03:32:06.562 --> 03:32:08.264]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:32:09.932 --> 03:32:11.313]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:32:11.593 --> 03:32:12.874]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.054 --> 03:32:13.954]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:14.274 --> 03:32:20.038]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:20.258 --> 03:32:25.981]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:26.161 --> 03:32:43.045]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:32:43.425 --> 03:32:45.546]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:45.906 --> 03:32:47.106]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:47.386 --> 03:32:48.086]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:48.427 --> 03:32:49.047]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:49.327 --> 03:32:51.167]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:21.767 --> 03:33:26.571]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:33:26.591 --> 03:33:28.032]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:28.273 --> 03:33:29.434]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:29.934 --> 03:33:34.498]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:38.951 --> 03:33:41.714]  What could be more perfect music for me?
[03:33:41.874 --> 03:33:42.615]  ZZ Top?
[03:33:43.516 --> 03:33:46.679]  Guys, three guys made a lot of music for just three pieces.
[03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:49.522]  Some real hardcore Texas guitar there.
[03:33:49.802 --> 03:33:50.343]  Outstanding.
[03:33:51.564 --> 03:33:52.305]  I'm back with you.
[03:33:53.146 --> 03:33:56.549]  Happy to sit in for my friend Alex Jones while he's on vacation.
[03:33:57.791 --> 03:34:01.574]  It's an epic day, truly I think a historic day.
[03:34:02.515 --> 03:34:14.127]  We are at the tipping point here in terms of the forces of liberty, the forces of freedom, the forces against globalism on the rise.
[03:34:15.748 --> 03:34:20.673]  A savior, a champion has arisen from the most unlikeliest place.
[03:34:21.834 --> 03:34:39.331]  As I write in my upcoming book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution, it was former President Richard Nixon who first realized the possibilities of a Trump presidency.
[03:34:40.632 --> 03:34:49.436]  Trump has nobody to, I should say, no one deserves credit for this victory more than he does.
[03:34:50.017 --> 03:34:54.779]  This was a marathon in which he took on all the derision
[03:34:55.399 --> 03:35:02.843]  And the massive spending and the beating that he took from the mainstream media, and he persevered.
[03:35:03.384 --> 03:35:17.172]  So I ask you, having just turned in the manuscript of 149,000 words to Skyhorse, this book should be out around the 31st of January, and it really, I think, is the
[03:35:19.873 --> 03:35:26.077]  The definitive account of how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest political upset in American times.
[03:35:26.237 --> 03:35:30.980]  Now, to a certain extent, I've had deja vu all over again.
[03:35:31.861 --> 03:35:38.766]  Just prior to the vote of the Electoral College, who pops up again but John Podesta.
[03:35:39.505 --> 03:36:04.320]  Claiming, incorrectly, that I both knew in advance of the hacking of his email and the claim that because I predicted an onslaught from WikiLeaks and Assange, an onslaught that actually took place, that I must have known in advance
[03:36:05.323 --> 03:36:06.884]  About the content of that.
[03:36:07.484 --> 03:36:17.368]  So I say again that in August of the election year, one must remember the context.
[03:36:18.009 --> 03:36:22.571]  Paul Manafort is under relentless phony attack by the Clinton people.
[03:36:23.431 --> 03:36:31.176]  I am well aware of Podesta's money laundering activities in Eastern Europe through my own network of sources.
[03:36:31.997 --> 03:36:41.803]  I produce a major story to which I refer at Stone Cold Truth regarding money laundering, the Russian mob, and the Podesta brothers.
[03:36:43.344 --> 03:36:48.248]  And none of that information demonstrably comes from WikiLeaks.
[03:36:49.248 --> 03:36:49.889]  Strike one.
[03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:51.370]  Strike two.
[03:36:52.208 --> 03:36:59.894]  On October 5th, I say that Assange is going to unload on Hillary, that her campaign is over.
[03:36:59.934 --> 03:37:02.836]  Well, the beginning of the end is over.
[03:37:03.997 --> 03:37:16.506]  I base this, as I have said a thousand times, on a comment by a mutual friend who has been in communications with Assange and is also in communications with me.
[03:37:18.346 --> 03:37:29.091]  And what I'm told is that he has unspecified political dynamite, information that will royal the race and could adversely affect Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:30.251 --> 03:37:34.253]  Now, if one will go on the public record, Assange has said that
[03:37:35.194 --> 03:37:39.459]  On the record several times just prior to my receiving this message.
[03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:50.270]  That does not mean that I at any time knew the substance of his disclosures, the timing of his disclosures.
[03:37:51.251 --> 03:37:54.595]  He did announce on the 5th that he would
[03:37:57.813 --> 03:37:59.394]  Little Marco Rubio there for you.
[03:38:01.095 --> 03:38:09.580]  He did disclose that he would take part as it went forward.
[03:38:11.448 --> 03:38:23.878]  This is, again, Assange said he would have ten releases, I believe, on October 5th, one a week for ten weeks, and he was good to his word.
[03:38:24.398 --> 03:38:29.743]  But the insinuation that I had any advance knowledge of content or timing is also false.
[03:38:30.383 --> 03:38:33.706]  Now, my problem here is, yet again,
[03:38:34.887 --> 03:38:45.632]  That all of these arguments were made by Mr. Podesta and amplified by the mainstream media, who afford me no opportunity to respond.
[03:38:46.613 --> 03:38:47.753]  They lose the election.
[03:38:47.773 --> 03:38:50.134]  The Electoral College is over.
[03:38:50.534 --> 03:38:51.795]  Trump's forming a cabinet.
[03:38:52.776 --> 03:38:59.639]  And now Podesta goes back to the Washington Post and recycles the same crap again.
[03:39:00.559 --> 03:39:01.620]  It was false then.
[03:39:01.640 --> 03:39:03.481]  It is false now.
[03:39:04.491 --> 03:39:09.095]  Yet, if one will go on Twitter or Facebook...
[03:39:10.165 --> 03:39:33.387]  They will see the mindless bots paid for by George Soros, run by that pathetic loser David Brock, constantly saying over and over again, Roger Stone knew, this is proof that Stone told his friend Trump, as one news organ just flatly said, as Mr. Podesta said, and they reported, Stone
[03:39:34.508 --> 03:39:36.830]  Could have told Trump or must have told Trump.
[03:39:37.250 --> 03:39:40.753]  Stone didn't tell Trump because Stone didn't know anything.
[03:39:41.614 --> 03:39:44.817]  Yet another opportunity to clarify that.
[03:39:45.357 --> 03:39:49.421]  Yet if you go on Twitter, you'll see mindless bots.
[03:39:50.121 --> 03:39:51.262]  Roger Stone knew.
[03:39:51.602 --> 03:39:58.248]  Alex Jones was... I mean, it is sophomoric what we have come to.
[03:39:59.729 --> 03:40:02.652]  I hope that many of you are planning to go to the inauguration.
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:10.745]  The thing to have is the Trump is my President t-shirt, which you can grab at InfoWars.
[03:40:11.306 --> 03:40:11.486]  Now,
[03:40:12.731 --> 03:40:19.696]  The night of the Deplora Ball, and we'll talk a little more about that later, which is kind of the people's celebration of the Trump victory.
[03:40:20.137 --> 03:40:23.399]  This is where the hardcore are going to gather.
[03:40:23.499 --> 03:40:24.640]  Alex Jones is speaking.
[03:40:25.501 --> 03:40:27.762]  I'm honored to have been asked to speak.
[03:40:28.143 --> 03:40:29.324]  The great Mike Cernovich.
[03:40:30.024 --> 03:40:34.688]  A good lineup of pro-Liberty, pro-Trump, Trump-supporting Americans.
[03:40:35.308 --> 03:40:36.569]  It's going to be a great event.
[03:40:37.569 --> 03:40:57.381]  In all honesty, we have gotten intelligence reports of radical organizations talking about disrupting this event, harassing attendees, using Alinsky tactics, throwing baggies of Clorox or urine, trying to incite violence, confusion.
[03:40:58.521 --> 03:41:01.123]  First of all, let me assure those of you who are going to the ball,
[03:41:02.364 --> 03:41:11.011]  There will be adequate security and precautions are being made so we can have a peaceful assembly in the celebration of the Trump victory.
[03:41:12.032 --> 03:41:18.678]  But this is, I think, part and parcel of a much broader and more dangerous effort that is afoot.
[03:41:19.458 --> 03:41:23.041]  And that is to turn Washington, D.C.
[03:41:23.682 --> 03:41:24.443]  into Chicago in 1968.
[03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:32.767]  This is what I think the radical left and Soros, whose checkbook seems to be endless, have an appetite for.
[03:41:33.348 --> 03:41:35.751]  So, we're talking about massive disruption.
[03:41:35.811 --> 03:41:38.073]  People laying down in the streets.
[03:41:38.534 --> 03:41:41.237]  People chaining themselves to public accommodations.
[03:41:41.998 --> 03:41:45.362]  People assaulting people coming off of public transportation.
[03:41:46.583 --> 03:41:56.609]  Agitating, trying to create a crisis atmosphere, tear gas canisters we think will be deployed, other poisons could be deployed.
[03:41:56.689 --> 03:42:08.177]  This is an attempt at anarchy and to mar what I think is shaping up to be a great, although be it somewhat disorganized, inaugural.
[03:42:09.057 --> 03:42:13.600]  The President now going to drop by three Inaugural Balls, by tradition.
[03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:16.782]  This is where Jack Kennedy dazzled everybody without a hat.
[03:42:18.163 --> 03:42:21.405]  And a parade, of course, as is traditional.
[03:42:22.226 --> 03:42:29.790]  The swearing-in, most Americans don't realize, is not controlled by President-elect Trump or his entourage.
[03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:31.511]  It is controlled by the U.S.
[03:42:31.551 --> 03:42:32.012]  Congress.
[03:42:32.092 --> 03:42:33.293]  It's a federal proceeding.
[03:42:34.113 --> 03:42:45.200]  The Trump entourage gets a certain set number of seated and standing tickets for the swearing-in ceremony, but the Congress awards some of these to the public.
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:52.824]  They award some of them, not award them, but they give them to the Supreme Court, to the U.S.
[03:42:52.904 --> 03:42:59.929]  Senate, obviously, to members of the House, to former members of the House, to the Diplomatic Corps, and so on.
[03:43:01.390 --> 03:43:05.996]  We are hoping for good weather, which is really the key to a great Inaugural.
[03:43:06.036 --> 03:43:12.984]  We have not had great weather in recent Inaugurals, and it can be very bitter in Washington during this time.
[03:43:13.065 --> 03:43:15.568]  So if you are coming,
[03:43:16.699 --> 03:43:21.903]  Uh, number one, take your silver bullet, because that stuff, I think, really pumps up your immunity.
[03:43:21.923 --> 03:43:24.165]  Uh, but wear a warm coat, wear a hat.
[03:43:24.846 --> 03:43:26.187]  Uh, ladies, fur is okay.
[03:43:26.227 --> 03:43:27.067]  We're Republicans.
[03:43:27.147 --> 03:43:28.488]  It's perfectly alright.
[03:43:28.508 --> 03:43:32.111]  Uh, I think it's going to be a great, great celebration.
[03:43:32.131 --> 03:43:35.314]  Uh, and I think it's going to be very ad hoc.
[03:43:36.392 --> 03:43:46.706]  There's a Great America ball that is more low-cost on the 20th as well as all these official events.
[03:43:47.547 --> 03:43:53.395]  I think there are still plans for a pro-Trump counter-protest at the Washington Monument.
[03:43:54.327 --> 03:43:58.688]  The National Park Service is arguing with activists who we are friendly with.
[03:43:59.489 --> 03:44:02.389]  There will be entertainment at the Deplora Ball.
[03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:08.271]  So, by all means, this kind of revolution only happens once a millennium.
[03:44:09.151 --> 03:44:11.772]  This is it for the United States.
[03:44:12.532 --> 03:44:14.873]  This is our last, best hope.
[03:44:16.402 --> 03:44:17.002]  For freedom.
[03:44:18.023 --> 03:44:28.186]  We are either going to continue down the path of the neocon globalists, whose real sin is not that they ran the country into the ditch.
[03:44:28.887 --> 03:44:34.849]  Not that they robbed the American people of their wealth and their prosperity and their security.
[03:44:35.609 --> 03:44:43.612]  It's that they and their cronies made millions, if not billions, while causing this misery to the American people.
[03:44:44.732 --> 03:44:48.296]  So we're not talking just about inefficient or incompetent government.
[03:44:49.073 --> 03:44:50.694]  We're talking about greed.
[03:44:51.455 --> 03:45:11.609]  The ideology of the Bush-Clinton-Bush combine and their elitist friends and followers at the Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission or any of these elitist foreign policy organizations where you have old money and old intelligence ties.
[03:45:12.790 --> 03:45:13.970]  They have finally
[03:45:16.599 --> 03:45:19.141]  Worn out their welcome with the American people.
[03:45:20.742 --> 03:45:37.214]  The shifting paradigm here is based on the fact that for the first time in this election, a majority of voters has finally realized that the mainstream media's job is to cover up for the establishment, not report on them.
[03:45:38.154 --> 03:45:40.476]  You see, this is the exact reverse of Watergate.
[03:45:41.283 --> 03:45:45.246]  In Watergate, Richard Nixon and his men did some illegal things.
[03:45:46.127 --> 03:45:48.528]  And they kept a lid on them for almost a year.
[03:45:49.509 --> 03:45:57.875]  But the Washington Post and the New York Times both engaged in very aggressive investigative reporting.
[03:46:00.998 --> 03:46:02.839]  Tip of the hat to Senator Rubio.
[03:46:05.921 --> 03:46:06.602]  In this case,
[03:46:07.731 --> 03:46:22.583]  You have the failed intelligence agencies trying desperately for the last time to push a narrative on the American people, which is no longer possible.
[03:46:23.123 --> 03:46:32.231]  The shift in media attention of the American people has led directly to a revolution that they could not foresee.
[03:46:32.771 --> 03:46:35.854]  Now they hysterically try to restore their grip
[03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:37.650]  But it's too late.
[03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:44.474]  The forces of freedom in a reformer who is outside their elitist clique has become president.
[03:46:46.515 --> 03:46:50.318]  Let us look at the next president of the United States here for a moment.
[03:46:51.445 --> 03:46:53.386]  Do you trust your U.S.
[03:46:53.506 --> 03:46:54.447]  intelligence officials?
[03:46:54.507 --> 03:47:03.552]  And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?
[03:47:03.952 --> 03:47:07.114]  Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important.
[03:47:07.815 --> 03:47:10.996]  We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo.
[03:47:12.697 --> 03:47:14.799]  And others, you know the Senator, Dan Coats.
[03:47:15.319 --> 03:47:17.201]  We're going to be putting in some outstanding people.
[03:47:17.721 --> 03:47:23.726]  Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.
[03:47:25.187 --> 03:47:27.009]  I want them to cover this situation.
[03:47:27.888 --> 03:47:32.250]  I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly, because we're hacked by everybody.
[03:47:32.591 --> 03:47:37.573]  That includes Russia, and China, and everybody.
[03:47:37.914 --> 03:47:40.015]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[03:47:40.075 --> 03:47:50.660]  Mr. President-elect, you said just now that you believe that Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and found Podesta's emails, etc.
[03:47:50.701 --> 03:47:52.061]  Well, Russia, but you know what?
[03:47:52.081 --> 03:47:53.062]  Could have been others also.
[03:47:53.422 --> 03:47:55.383]  Why did you spend weeks undermining the U.S.
[03:47:55.443 --> 03:48:00.144]  intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?
[03:48:00.164 --> 03:48:04.005]  Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.
[03:48:04.465 --> 03:48:05.285]  I think it's pretty sad.
[03:48:05.305 --> 03:48:06.386]  First of all, it's illegal.
[03:48:06.986 --> 03:48:12.147]  You know, these are classified and certified meetings and reports.
[03:48:12.507 --> 03:48:13.547]  I'll tell you what does happen.
[03:48:14.128 --> 03:48:20.509]  I have many meetings with intelligence, and every time I meet, people are reading about it.
[03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:22.630]  Somebody's leaking it out.
[03:48:26.367 --> 03:48:30.169]  There you go, the unvarnished Donald Trump, who I think gets it.
[03:48:30.269 --> 03:48:31.670]  They lied about Benghazi.
[03:48:31.730 --> 03:48:34.752]  They lied about Iran-Contra.
[03:48:34.852 --> 03:48:37.373]  They lied about the Vietnam War.
[03:48:37.413 --> 03:48:39.274]  They lied about the Kennedy assassination.
[03:48:39.314 --> 03:48:42.876]  They lied about the coups in Guatemala and what they did in Chile.
[03:48:44.396 --> 03:48:47.098]  The CIA is about lying.
[03:48:48.138 --> 03:48:54.582]  And in this particular case, the fact that the drumbeat is being led by the CIA director, John Brennan.
[03:48:55.622 --> 03:49:00.324]  A man who converted from Catholicism to radical Wahhabism.
[03:49:01.124 --> 03:49:09.087]  A man who speaks the language and has a long history of activity in the American Communist Party.
[03:49:09.647 --> 03:49:13.109]  The man I believe cleansed Barack Obama's
[03:49:14.629 --> 03:49:17.312]  He's a partisan, he's a hack, and Trump needs to replace him.
[03:49:34.522 --> 03:49:38.826]  Another guy in the cheerleading saying the Russians hacked the election.
[03:49:39.146 --> 03:49:45.872]  This is the same guy who lied about Benghazi, and he's now on the payroll of some Clinton-connected PR firm.
[03:49:46.353 --> 03:49:47.294]  He's a stooge.
[03:49:47.494 --> 03:49:49.616]  Why would anyone believe him?
[03:49:49.636 --> 03:49:50.697]  Yeah, another hack.
[03:49:51.397 --> 03:50:03.901]  These are the intelligence experts who are giving us this line of bull and 29% of the people are buying it and no one else.
[03:50:07.294 --> 03:50:12.579]  I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news, and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things.
[03:50:13.180 --> 03:50:17.924]  But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody.
[03:50:18.364 --> 03:50:19.725]  I could name them, but I won't bother.
[03:50:19.806 --> 03:50:22.168]  But you have a few sitting right in front of us.
[03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:25.170]  So they're very, very dishonest people.
[03:50:25.831 --> 03:50:28.854]  But I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.
[03:50:29.114 --> 03:50:30.915]  I guess the advantage I have is that
[03:50:31.764 --> 03:50:32.505]  I can speak back.
[03:50:33.405 --> 03:50:40.430]  When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this, doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back.
[03:50:40.490 --> 03:50:41.351]  It's a very sad thing.
[03:50:41.391 --> 03:50:42.572]  I've seen people destroyed.
[03:50:43.052 --> 03:50:45.894]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[03:50:46.415 --> 03:50:47.635]  And I think it's very unfair.
[03:50:47.716 --> 03:50:50.798]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters, yes.
[03:50:55.543 --> 03:51:00.638]  There you have it, Donald Trump right in the face, right in the grill of the fake news.
[03:51:01.140 --> 03:51:03.266]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.
[03:51:14.352 --> 03:51:19.234]  I've been around the reporting game for over 30 years, so I've known lots of reporters.
[03:51:20.555 --> 03:51:25.157]  Lots of reporters, some editors, people who work in the mainstream.
[03:51:26.338 --> 03:51:27.118]  What are they doing?
[03:51:27.178 --> 03:51:28.439]  What's their psychology?
[03:51:29.548 --> 03:51:32.350]  First of all, they're talent spotted.
[03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:34.111]  You understand what that means?
[03:51:34.772 --> 03:51:39.415]  Somebody picks him out and says, this kid is fairly smart, he's kind of bright, let's bring him in, it could be good.
[03:51:39.935 --> 03:51:43.658]  And he believes what we want our people to believe.
[03:51:44.639 --> 03:51:45.019]  Already.
[03:51:45.899 --> 03:51:47.380]  He believes in globalism.
[03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:52.143]  He believes that we're all one happy, sappy, global village.
[03:51:52.243 --> 03:51:57.927]  He believes that parents should be taking care of their own kids if the state wants to intervene.
[03:51:58.548 --> 03:52:03.591]  He believes that communities should be planned by the United Nations if necessary.
[03:52:03.611 --> 03:52:07.413]  People live in little tiny little spaces and so forth.
[03:52:07.914 --> 03:52:11.556]  Kick people who are living out in so that migrants can live there.
[03:52:11.596 --> 03:52:15.159]  You know, he's already on board, all right?
[03:52:16.320 --> 03:52:18.022]  This is key and crucial.
[03:52:18.583 --> 03:52:19.864]  They bring these people in.
[03:52:20.385 --> 03:52:21.887]  They can smell them a mile away.
[03:52:21.967 --> 03:52:22.568]  So can you.
[03:52:22.608 --> 03:52:23.810]  So can I. So can they.
[03:52:25.481 --> 03:52:27.703]  Guy walks through the door, he's 24 years old.
[03:52:28.183 --> 03:52:32.527]  He's got a master's degree from, you know, jerk university.
[03:52:33.348 --> 03:52:34.749]  And oh, yes, very good.
[03:52:34.789 --> 03:52:41.655]  He sits down and right away the editor who's interviewing him or the personnel guy at the New York Times or wherever it is.
[03:52:42.896 --> 03:52:43.897]  Sniff, sniff, sniff.
[03:52:43.997 --> 03:52:50.923]  Yep, I can smell this guy is a liberal, which means he's really a globalist and he's a communist and he's a socialist.
[03:52:50.983 --> 03:52:52.845]  And he doesn't even have to know what that means.
[03:52:53.684 --> 03:52:54.545]  You know, the reporter.
[03:52:55.466 --> 03:52:58.408]  He just thinks he does, so that's what we want.
[03:52:58.849 --> 03:53:03.773]  And then he can write articles from the angle that we want him to write articles from, and that's how the game works.
[03:53:05.034 --> 03:53:06.015]  That's really what it is.
[03:53:06.796 --> 03:53:08.537]  They smell the same smell.
[03:53:08.657 --> 03:53:10.479]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[03:53:10.919 --> 03:53:12.020]  Oh yeah, he's one of us.
[03:53:12.721 --> 03:53:13.802]  Sure, he talks like us.
[03:53:13.882 --> 03:53:15.063]  I can tell he thinks like us.
[03:53:15.123 --> 03:53:16.184]  He acts like us.
[03:53:16.204 --> 03:53:17.405]  His attitude is like us.
[03:53:19.046 --> 03:53:20.488]  It's kind of like, uh...
[03:53:22.170 --> 03:53:25.171]  Semi-high IQ mucus.
[03:53:25.772 --> 03:53:26.072]  Okay?
[03:53:27.072 --> 03:53:28.573]  That's what I think of it as.
[03:53:29.113 --> 03:53:37.397]  Oh yes, I'm spotting in Jones, our newest candidate for reporter, a semi-high IQ mucus.
[03:53:38.277 --> 03:53:39.257]  Yes, very good.
[03:53:39.337 --> 03:53:40.718]  Yes, I think he'll be fine.
[03:53:40.798 --> 03:53:41.858]  He'll be fine.
[03:53:42.038 --> 03:53:42.499]  One of us.
[03:53:45.520 --> 03:53:47.681]  And they are going all in.
[03:53:49.742 --> 03:53:59.350]  Risking everything, major media I'm talking about, with the most fantastical stories, you know, that are just ridiculous.
[03:54:00.291 --> 03:54:05.296]  The Russians and the Putin and this and that and all the fake news sites are really working for who?
[03:54:05.576 --> 03:54:05.896]  Russia?
[03:54:05.956 --> 03:54:06.296]  What?
[03:54:06.517 --> 03:54:08.598]  You know, they are going crazy.
[03:54:16.768 --> 03:54:18.729]  And just keep telling me how much time I have left.
[03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:20.270]  Welcome back!
[03:54:25.541 --> 03:54:43.273]  You've got a feisty Donald Trump on the attack, taking on the old crumbling media to their face, calling them out as being fake news, as they launch this over-the-hill, pardon me, over-the-top, totally unsubstantiated, faux allegation.
[03:54:43.434 --> 03:54:44.835]  Now, I know Michael Cohen.
[03:54:45.855 --> 03:54:48.817]  of the Trump Organization, Vice President, I think General Counsel.
[03:54:49.297 --> 03:54:50.158]  He's a good man.
[03:54:50.578 --> 03:54:51.599]  He's a friend of mine.
[03:54:52.479 --> 03:54:55.541]  He has been unfairly accused of something he had nothing to do with.
[03:54:56.562 --> 03:55:00.604]  It's outrageous that his name has been dragged through the mud.
[03:55:01.204 --> 03:55:02.845]  He's a very, very able man.
[03:55:04.446 --> 03:55:05.347]  It's just outrageous.
[03:55:06.548 --> 03:55:10.970]  It is also incredible that Trump is being this aggressive.
[03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:12.011]  Let's look at him today.
[03:55:12.691 --> 03:55:15.013]  This is Reagan-quality leadership.
[03:55:16.584 --> 03:55:20.988]  When I leave our country, I'm a very high profile person, would you say?
[03:55:22.889 --> 03:55:24.490]  I am extremely careful.
[03:55:24.831 --> 03:55:26.252]  I'm surrounded by bodyguards.
[03:55:27.032 --> 03:55:28.233]  I'm surrounded by people.
[03:55:29.094 --> 03:55:36.040]  And I always tell them, anywhere, but I always tell them, if I'm leaving this country, be very careful.
[03:55:37.021 --> 03:55:41.664]  Because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.
[03:55:41.704 --> 03:55:45.968]  I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.
[03:55:46.972 --> 03:55:49.014]  And number one, I hope you're going to be good anyway.
[03:55:49.855 --> 03:55:52.878]  But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.
[03:55:53.399 --> 03:55:58.904]  Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.
[03:55:59.925 --> 03:56:05.791]  You better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.
[03:56:06.672 --> 03:56:09.535]  I tell this to people all the time.
[03:56:10.712 --> 03:56:15.777]  I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well.
[03:56:15.857 --> 03:56:18.680]  Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well.
[03:56:19.741 --> 03:56:26.087]  And I told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television.
[03:56:26.107 --> 03:56:27.248]  Cameras all over the place.
[03:56:27.829 --> 03:56:29.911]  And again, not just Russia, all over.
[03:56:32.732 --> 03:56:45.219]  There again, Donald Trump, a man of, I think, extreme sophistication, always been realistic about security precautions, a man of great discretion and savvy.
[03:56:45.579 --> 03:56:54.605]  That's why this charge that he partied with a group of women who either urinated on him or for him
[03:56:55.605 --> 03:56:57.005]  It's an outrageous insult.
[03:56:57.045 --> 03:56:58.286]  This is a fabrication.
[03:56:58.966 --> 03:57:01.486]  I have known the man personally for 40 years.
[03:57:01.926 --> 03:57:03.506]  I knew his parents well.
[03:57:04.887 --> 03:57:07.747]  Fred and Mary attended both of their funerals.
[03:57:07.867 --> 03:57:12.708]  I knew his brother-in-law John Barry, a very able Republican lawyer in New Jersey.
[03:57:13.568 --> 03:57:22.870]  And I am a good friend of Judge Mary Ann Trump Barry, who is a fine jurist, put on the bench by Ronald Reagan.
[03:57:23.950 --> 03:57:27.511]  So, I know the Trump character.
[03:57:28.732 --> 03:57:33.713]  Yes, he is a man with an eye for beautiful women, but these charges are not him.
[03:57:33.733 --> 03:57:35.414]  It is not something that he would do.
[03:57:36.094 --> 03:57:45.637]  These are as bogus as the trumped-up fake Epstein rape charges, which collapsed at the end of the campaign.
[03:57:46.858 --> 03:57:50.199]  A woman who alleged, without her name ever being used, that
[03:57:51.084 --> 03:57:56.288]  She had been raped by Epstein and Trump together in Epstein's home.
[03:57:57.709 --> 03:57:58.849]  Zero chance.
[03:57:59.910 --> 03:58:07.075]  And, of course, as you probably know, the woman in question disappeared from sight at the end of the campaign and withdrew her lawsuit.
[03:58:08.468 --> 03:58:16.634]  This was the last line of defense of the Clintonistas who knew in the Epstein issue, Bill had real liability.
[03:58:17.574 --> 03:58:19.656]  So, that's the inside story.
[03:58:20.316 --> 03:58:24.899]  Thanks for joining us here at InfoWars, and I will see you in a few days.
[03:58:24.959 --> 03:58:27.741]  In the meantime, stand tall for the Trump Revolution.
[03:58:28.261 --> 03:58:31.804]  You're at the cutting edge of the resistance here at InfoWars.
[03:58:52.122 --> 03:58:56.076]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:59.585 --> 03:59:05.750]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:59:06.131 --> 03:59:09.013]  Dr. Griff, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:59:09.373 --> 03:59:14.538]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:59:14.958 --> 03:59:20.943]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:59:21.083 --> 03:59:24.226]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:59:24.366 --> 03:59:25.827]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:59:26.027 --> 03:59:30.170]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:59:30.350 --> 03:59:33.213]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:59:33.293 --> 03:59:34.874]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:59:34.954 --> 03:59:38.137]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:59:38.437 --> 03:59:40.759]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:59:41.039 --> 03:59:42.000]  It's in powder form.
[03:59:42.100 --> 03:59:44.802]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:59:44.982 --> 03:59:45.582]  I take this.
[03:59:45.683 --> 03:59:47.364]  This is the product that I take.
[03:59:47.504 --> 03:59:49.466]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:59:50.286 --> 03:59:51.047]  We fight the Globals.
[03:59:51.087 --> 03:59:51.948]  We fight the New World Order.
[03:59:52.248 --> 03:59:58.836]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[04:00:00.838 --> 04:00:04.943]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[04:00:05.443 --> 04:00:06.745]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:00:21.852 --> 04:00:24.057]  Waging war on corruption.
[04:00:24.137 --> 04:00:29.569]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[04:00:33.920 --> 04:00:35.101]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:00:35.142 --> 04:00:36.623]  This is January 11th, 2017.
[04:00:36.883 --> 04:00:38.285]  It's an amazing day.
[04:00:38.305 --> 04:00:39.546]  We've had a lot of news breaking.
[04:00:39.586 --> 04:00:42.629]  Of course, Donald Trump having his first press conference in six months.
[04:00:43.210 --> 04:00:51.018]  But just hours before the press conference, we had this massive new fake news attack coming from hardcore Hillary supporters, BuzzFeed.
[04:00:51.058 --> 04:00:51.478]  I mean, we got...
[04:00:52.219 --> 04:00:58.787]  Tweets from the BuzzFeed editors all last night, one after the other, talking about how they're in absolute fear.
[04:01:00.408 --> 04:01:01.710]  This is something that is developing.
[04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:03.152]  Alex Jones is on the road.
[04:01:03.172 --> 04:01:04.994]  He wanted to call in with this report.
[04:01:05.014 --> 04:01:06.135]  We've got Alex on the line right now.
[04:01:06.215 --> 04:01:06.375]  Alex?
[04:01:07.056 --> 04:01:08.617]  That's right, I'll be co-hosting with you here, David.
[04:01:08.677 --> 04:01:10.898]  I'm sorry I didn't relay that message to you.
[04:01:10.978 --> 04:01:14.199]  Wow, there is so much to break down here, so much to go over.
[04:01:14.219 --> 04:01:21.803]  I mean, it is simply mind-blowing that I saw this story over a day ago about the Golden Showers.
[04:01:22.383 --> 04:01:24.985]  I knew it was pure, absolute bull the minute I saw it.
[04:01:25.385 --> 04:01:27.146]  And I just said, you know what, I'm going to leave it alone.
[04:01:27.826 --> 04:01:31.908]  I'm going to see if mainstream media picks this up, which I'm sure they would, and then see where it went from there.
[04:01:32.128 --> 04:01:32.868]  We're good to go.
[04:01:57.242 --> 04:02:01.327]  By the Russians having political views on something like Peaceful America.
[04:02:01.667 --> 04:02:05.571]  This is their big, much-to-do-about-nothing bombshell information.
[04:02:05.611 --> 04:02:10.257]  But now, they've really bitten off more than they can chew with MSM, as you know.
[04:02:11.449 --> 04:02:20.077]  Running with the claims, unsubstantiated, that the President is in these parties being urinated on, basically.
[04:02:20.837 --> 04:02:33.048]  Now, meanwhile, we have Bill Clinton flying around with Jerry Epstein, the convicted pedophile, more than now 20 times, who went to a pedophile island, who flew to an island with a sheik,
[04:02:33.568 --> 04:02:33.869]  We're good.
[04:02:54.366 --> 04:03:03.425]  Girl, that's the one he just got caught for in Hollywood, defending him and trying to get his conviction of child rape overturned so he could come here.
[04:03:04.497 --> 04:03:12.966]  From France, battling his extradition, and you've got Meryl Streep standing up with standing ovations for an admitted child rapist.
[04:03:13.386 --> 04:03:19.312]  I'm expecting media matters to come out and say that Roman Polanski never raped a 13-year-old girl, anally.
[04:03:19.693 --> 04:03:26.420]  So this is what we're dealing with, is people with a real history of obsession with sexual perversion.
[04:03:27.100 --> 04:03:27.320]  No.
[04:03:27.820 --> 04:03:31.341]  Donald Trump has an obsession with beautiful, perfect ten women.
[04:03:31.801 --> 04:03:33.821]  And I don't think anybody's going to say that's a crime.
[04:03:33.861 --> 04:03:38.482]  He's never claimed to be, you know, Mr. Perfect, but he's been married several times.
[04:03:38.782 --> 04:03:39.762]  He has a great family.
[04:03:40.182 --> 04:03:43.083]  The point is, is that this is how desperate they are, David.
[04:03:43.123 --> 04:03:45.963]  So I'm going to be here with you off and on a little bit in the first hour.
[04:03:46.023 --> 04:03:48.164]  We've got the full press conference of Trump.
[04:03:48.224 --> 04:03:49.184]  It's still ongoing.
[04:03:49.524 --> 04:03:51.164]  We're going to be hearing some excerpts of that.
[04:03:51.184 --> 04:03:54.845]  Again, he's come out and said this is absolute, total bull.
[04:03:55.966 --> 04:03:57.727]  Spicer's come out and said it's total bull.
[04:03:57.827 --> 04:04:00.369]  Priebus has said it's 100% manufactured.
[04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:09.375]  But notice for the first day, David, they were absolutely celebrating, celebrating in rapture that they had Donald Trump.
[04:04:09.775 --> 04:04:10.816]  A secret report.
[04:04:11.096 --> 04:04:13.898]  Why, this is why Trump didn't want a war with the Russians.
[04:04:14.338 --> 04:04:19.162]  This is why, because, because they had pee-pee videos of the president.
[04:04:19.262 --> 04:04:20.523]  Totally insane.
[04:04:20.603 --> 04:04:20.743]  No.
[04:04:21.818 --> 04:04:36.868]  Trump's being advised by a bunch of top generals who are not pro-Russia, who are not anti-Russia, but who are actually pro-America, and it's not in our interest to pick on Russia when Russia is not in an expansive, expanding role right now, and China is.
[04:04:37.248 --> 04:04:51.118]  We should be working with Russia, Japan, and others to contain China, and that is indeed what's happening right now, is real geopolitical activity to also not just contain communist China that's expanding,
[04:04:51.698 --> 04:04:52.118]  I don't know.
[04:05:08.215 --> 04:05:08.876]  Absolutely, Alex.
[04:05:08.936 --> 04:05:12.659]  And of course, one of the things that he talked about in the press conference... Wars are not cheap.
[04:05:12.699 --> 04:05:17.322]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[04:05:17.963 --> 04:05:20.765]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[04:05:21.325 --> 04:05:23.827]  I believe in the Renaissance, and that's why I harp on it constantly.
[04:05:24.447 --> 04:05:31.252]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[04:05:31.593 --> 04:05:34.034]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear,
[04:05:35.015 --> 04:05:36.477]  That's not rhetoric.
[04:05:36.517 --> 04:05:45.545]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[04:05:45.565 --> 04:05:58.257]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[04:05:58.677 --> 04:06:00.198]  We apply to the products we bring.
[04:06:01.239 --> 04:06:07.583]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[04:06:08.224 --> 04:06:12.566]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[04:06:12.586 --> 04:06:13.847]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[04:06:13.867 --> 04:06:16.309]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've
[04:06:17.089 --> 04:06:21.633]  Got to be produced at the highest stretchers, even past California standards, which is almost impossible to do.
[04:06:21.653 --> 04:06:22.374]  That's the whole point of it.
[04:06:22.634 --> 04:06:23.335]  So stop supplements.
[04:06:23.395 --> 04:06:24.796]  But we go to that standard.
[04:06:24.976 --> 04:06:32.622]  But we've got a whole bunch of the products that are still available right now, and I want to extend to all of you those specials to make our bodies great again.
[04:06:32.663 --> 04:06:34.144]  Because our bodies are our temples.
[04:06:34.164 --> 04:06:36.206]  And look, I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[04:06:36.646 --> 04:06:37.587]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[04:06:38.107 --> 04:06:39.248]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[04:06:39.288 --> 04:06:39.889]  I was in great shape.
[04:06:39.929 --> 04:06:41.010]  I'm dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:46.114]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[04:06:46.294 --> 04:06:47.915]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[04:06:48.236 --> 04:06:50.538]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[04:06:50.578 --> 04:06:55.362]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing.
[04:06:56.062 --> 04:07:06.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, myopqq, you name it, 170-plus studies.
[04:07:06.704 --> 04:07:07.664]  We can make claims on this.
[04:07:07.704 --> 04:07:13.766]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[04:07:14.586 --> 04:07:16.366]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[04:07:16.446 --> 04:07:17.226]  I forget to take it.
[04:07:17.246 --> 04:07:18.146]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[04:07:18.166 --> 04:07:20.067]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[04:07:20.147 --> 04:07:22.327]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[04:07:22.787 --> 04:07:23.368]  Well, guess what?
[04:07:23.388 --> 04:07:24.648]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[04:07:25.008 --> 04:07:25.568]  It's discounted.
[04:07:25.868 --> 04:07:28.930]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[04:07:29.071 --> 04:07:33.354]  A lot of the products we have left, we still have some supplies of and will sell out soon.
[04:07:33.654 --> 04:07:35.656]  But I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[04:07:36.016 --> 04:07:40.759]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
