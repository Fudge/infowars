[00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:34.444]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:37.110]  What we are looking at...
[00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:53.298]  Well, we've got a new talking point that's being put out by mainstream media we're going to go to coming up in the next long segment.
[00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:59.721]  Questioning Hillary Clinton, exposing Uranium One or Russian connections is dictatorship.
[00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:05.244]  But then they're the ones calling for Trump to be overthrown and the ones that want martial law.
[00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:09.386]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:11.107]  There is so much more to go over.
[00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:13.608]  Plus, Judge Roy Moore
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.843]  Saying that he courted 16, 17-year-old girls when he was 35.
[00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:21.546]  I think that's a little creepy, but not illegal.
[00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:32.796]  But meanwhile, you've got, as I said, Joe Biden groping little kids all over television hundreds of times, Secret Service agents saying that he would grope little kids and was worse than Weinstein.
[00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:41.144]  You've got Bill Clinton, you've got just all the Democrat garbage, Kevin Spacey, Hollywood, the rest of it, and they're trying to project
[00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:47.882]  Their activity on the Conservatives, Christians and Libertarians as if we're the ones that have the big giant history of this.
[00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:51.585]  When we see there's evidence of Moore doing something, we'll go after him.
[00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:54.767]  But more and more the evidence gets undermined.
[00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.009]  Lamal says he was never banned.
[00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.351]  There was never an issue with him at the mall and teenage girls.
[00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.152]  It's just made up.
[00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:04.534]  And now people want to see the yearbook, not just hold it up.
[00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:07.557]  And a bunch of them turned out to be Democrat Party operatives.
[00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:08.778]  That's what I'm saying is,
[00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:22.047]  They take Moore and turn him into the devil incarnate, and then change the whole subject off everything they've been doing, and then make normal courtship activities between men and women a dirty, bad thing.
[00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:29.876]  Now that said, according to Democratic standards, and I knew this news two days ago,
[00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:35.250]  I was dealing with a bunch of family stuff today, so I didn't really come in and do a bunch of preparation.
[00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.735]  I normally do that, but I walked in here and they said, have you heard Al Franken?
[00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:41.717]  And I said, assaulted a woman.
[00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:42.998]  They said, oh yeah, you've already seen it?
[00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.160]  Is it just broke?
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.486]  And I said, yeah, I knew about it two days ago, but I was not greenlighted to go anywhere with it.
[00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:50.847]  I knew about it from Roger Stone.
[00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:55.669]  So, we should probably get Roger on to give us the rest of the story today.
[00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.254]  Now, he knew about it a couple days ago, and I've got his text messages.
[00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:01.778]  Al Franken sex accusation.
[00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.140]  Kissed and groped.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.761]  Not funny.
[00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:07.585]  Nomenclature.
[00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:09.766]  A man and woman who are married having sex is rape.
[00:03:10.487 --> 00:03:13.249]  Feminists actually teach any sex with a man and woman is evil.
[00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.712]  Of course, don't ignore the fact that lesbians have the highest rate of rape.
[00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:20.074]  Highest rate of beating each other up.
[00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:21.735]  I'm not saying they're all rapists.
[00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.157]  I'm just saying statistically it's a very abusive group to their own people.
[00:03:25.558 --> 00:03:27.579]  So they just demonize heterosexuals all day.
[00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.643]  But here's photos of Al Franken joking like he's grabbing a woman's breast.
[00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:40.192]  And you know, he's all out of the same Hollywood sewer that thinks destroying the Republic's funny.
[00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.895]  We don't think it's funny, Mr. Franken.
[00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:47.399]  So we're gonna be going over all of that today.
[00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.986]  And I also have a ton of news dealing with what Trump did in
[00:03:58.064 --> 00:03:58.424]  Asia.
[00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:14.409]  And last night, I did a lot of preparation, and did about three hours of research after the family went to bed, and I ended up watching all of Trump's speeches in Japan, in South Korea, in Vietnam, and other areas.
[00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:23.272]  I watched like nine speeches last night, and I thought, these are so powerful, I really ought to air at least one of these.
[00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:27.018]  And the one in Seoul, South Korea.
[00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:28.338]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew that.
[00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:30.798]  Pull us up a whitehouse.gov version, please.
[00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:32.559]  Was extremely powerful.
[00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:36.240]  And if you understand the 15-minute speech, you understand everything.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:49.343]  It's one of those Rosetta Stone keys to Trump's thinking, my thinking, historical thinking, common sense, Americana Renaissance versus globalism, versus communism, versus socialism, versus fascism.
[00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:51.764]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.927]  Tommy Robinson is going to be breaking down some incredible news.
[00:04:56.947 --> 00:05:00.188]  They're now trying to make it illegal to not send your kids to mosque.
[00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:01.349]  I'm not joking.
[00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:11.272]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:23.744]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:05:23.764 --> 00:05:25.605]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:29.889]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:30.469]  I want to thank everybody
[00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:39.579]  Everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:44.664]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:46.486]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:47.947]  And your purchase of the products
[00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:56.535]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:01.399]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:06.743]  Another world.
[00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:07.584]  Another time.
[00:06:07.664 --> 00:06:08.725]  In the age of wonder.
[00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:33.285]  Well, if you go to DrudgeReport.com or NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com, you can see the photo substantiating
[00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:56.231]  What this woman is saying.
[00:06:56.251 --> 00:07:04.873]  We're going to play the audio of her testimony coming up in the next segment.
[00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:15.756]  Senator Al Franken kissed and groped me without my consent and there's nothing funny about it.
[00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:24.518]  Now according to leftist ideology, coming up and not announcing that you're going to try to grab somebody and kiss them and grope them
[00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:27.626]  Is assault and extreme rape.
[00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:34.131]  Because according to the left and modern feminism, male and females having sex, even if they're married, is rape.
[00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:35.031]  I'm not joking.
[00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:39.674]  All sex is rape and is violent if it's heterosexual.
[00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:47.460]  Heterosexualism that produces children and population is bad, according to the eugenics program, so the general public doesn't procreate.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.342]  You're saying, well that doesn't make sense statistically.
[00:07:51.502 --> 00:07:59.686]  Homosexual couples have higher degrees of abuse, family violence, suicide, you name it.
[00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.187]  I'm not attacking these groups.
[00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:02.207]  It's just a fact.
[00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:07.150]  Higher levels of depression, higher levels of domestic violence, higher levels of suicide.
[00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.831]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:08:10.154 --> 00:08:12.395]  Heterosexualism is evil.
[00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:16.598]  Normal courtship, asking a woman out, is harassment.
[00:08:16.658 --> 00:08:20.160]  Even if you don't work with her, even if you, you know, it just doesn't matter.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.560]  Period.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.061]  It's bad.
[00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:26.344]  So by extension, Kevin Spacey grabbing other members of the cast's genitals
[00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:32.621]  Well, oh, that's just the same as asking a girl out, according to Hollywood.
[00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:54.481]  And so, Al Franken now, in new sex accusations, quote, he kissed and groped me, and then there's a photo of the very trip that it's being talked about, of him doing it, with a reporter that is asleep, on the flight over, making his jokes.
[00:08:55.936 --> 00:09:03.558]  In December 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO tour to entertain our troops, my eighth in the Middle East since the 9-11 attacks.
[00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:17.460]  My father served in Vietnam, and my then-boyfriend and now-husband Chris is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a little piece of home to service members stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.541]  Also on the trip, there were country music artists,
[00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:27.689]  It goes over Daryl Worley, Mark Wills, Kenny Thomas and some cheerleaders from the Dallas Cowboys.
[00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.515]  The headliner was comedian and now Senator Al Franken.
[00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:38.104]  Franken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them.
[00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:47.251]  Like many USO shows, before and since the skits were full of sexual innuendo geared towards young male audience.
[00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:51.955]  As a TV host and sports broadcaster, we can go to Infowars.com and bunch it up there.
[00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:52.435]  There we did.
[00:09:53.536 --> 00:10:07.106]  As a TV host and sports broadcaster, as well as a model familiar to the audience from the covers of FHM, Maximum Playboy, I was only expecting to emcee and introduce the acts, but Franken said,
[00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:12.876]  He had a part for me that he thought would be funny and I agreed to play along.
[00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:19.177]  When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when the character comes at me for a kiss.
[00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:29.960]  I suspected what he was after, but I figured I would turn my head and at the last minute put my hand on my mouth to get more laughs from the crowd.
[00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:34.991]  On the day of the show, Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines.
[00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:37.854]  One last time he said to me, we need to rehearse the kiss.
[00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:39.295]  I laughed and ignored him.
[00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:40.856]  Then he said it again.
[00:10:40.876 --> 00:10:44.019]  I said something like, relax Al, this isn't SNL.
[00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:45.760]  We don't need to rehearse the kiss.
[00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.964]  He continued to insist that I was beginning to get uncomfortable.
[00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:57.678]  He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything, this is just like Weinstein, and that we must practice the kiss.
[00:10:58.118 --> 00:10:59.018]  I said, okay!
[00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.299]  So he would stop badgering me.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:14.463]  We did the line leading up to the kiss, and then he came at me, put his hand down the back of my hand, mashed his lips against mine, and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.
[00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:19.825]  Well, at least you didn't bite your lip to keep you from resisting, like Bill Clinton would do, and then start choking you.
[00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:22.838]  But again, he is a Democrat, so I guess it's okay.
[00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:30.703]  I immediately pushed him away with both my hands against my chest and told him, if you ever did that to me again, I wouldn't be so nice the next time.
[00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:32.044]  I walked away.
[00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:39.529]  All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.
[00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.791]  I felt disgusted, and I felt violated.
[00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:48.335]  Not long after, I performed the skit as written, carefully turning my head so he couldn't kiss me on the lips.
[00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.151]  No one saw what happened backstage.
[00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.693]  I didn't tell the Sergeant Major of the Army, who was the sponsor of the tour.
[00:11:55.653 --> 00:11:58.335]  I didn't tell the USO rep what happened.
[00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.176]  At the time, I didn't want to cause trouble.
[00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:03.357]  We're in the middle of a war zone.
[00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:06.779]  It was the first show of our holiday tour.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.901]  I was professional, and I could take care of myself.
[00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:17.445]  I told a few others on the tour what Franken had done, and they knew how I felt about it.
[00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:20.510]  I tried to let it go, but I was angry.
[00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:27.936]  Other than our dialogue on stage, I never had a voluntary conversation with Al Franken again.
[00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:34.662]  I avoided him as much as possible, and I made sure I never was alone with him again for the rest of the tour.
[00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:45.130]  Franken repaid me with petty insults, including drawing devil horns on at least one of the headshots I was autographing for the troops.
[00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:46.692]  But he didn't stop there.
[00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:47.993]  The tour
[00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:54.264]  Ended, and on Christmas Eve, we began a 36-hour trip home to L.A.
[00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:58.586]  After two weeks of grueling traveling and performing, I was exhausted.
[00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:07.791]  When our C-17 cargo plane took off from Afghanistan, I immediately fell asleep, even though I was still wearing my flak vest and Kevlar helmet.
[00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:10.552]  It wasn't until I was back in the U.S.
[00:13:10.572 --> 00:13:14.915]  looking through the CD of photos we were given by the photographer that I saw this one.
[00:13:15.575 --> 00:13:18.657]  It's Al Franken simulating grabbing her breasts.
[00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:20.138]  In fact, actually he is grabbing them.
[00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:22.539]  One of the hands isn't touching, the other appears to be.
[00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:23.880]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.121]  He groped me without my consent while I was asleep.
[00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.703]  I felt violated all over again, embarrassed, belittled, humiliated.
[00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:33.045]  How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it's funny?
[00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.006]  And you can see one of the hands is grabbing her breast.
[00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:38.147]  It's right there, you can see it.
[00:13:38.168 --> 00:13:39.588]  The other one looks like he's touching her.
[00:13:41.249 --> 00:13:43.931]  I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.
[00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:50.117]  I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen.
[00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:57.900]  But even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.
[00:13:58.641 --> 00:13:59.841]  But that was then, this is now.
[00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:01.782]  I'm no longer afraid.
[00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.543]  And she goes on, we need to get her on the show.
[00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:09.065]  Today, I am the news anchor
[00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:14.748]  And then she just goes into why she's done it and what a hypocrite Franken is.
[00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:47.412]  And how she heard about what Weinstein did and how he basically did the exact same thing to her.
[00:14:49.012 --> 00:14:50.633]  But the bigger issue here is this.
[00:14:51.633 --> 00:15:09.240]  Al Franken is the one pushing all of the conservatives are evil and heterosexuals are bad and Christians are bad and Judge Roy Moore and all the rest of this stuff and Hollywood needs to police everybody and they're the moral high ground when he's some washed up loser actor comedian.
[00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:23.707]  And he came out in the news just this week and called for conservative media to be banned online, on social media.
[00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:25.348]  We can put the headline on screen.
[00:15:26.289 --> 00:15:33.595]  He came out, Al Franken, and said, we want to censor conservative media on social media.
[00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:35.777]  That was on the heels of hearings.
[00:15:37.153 --> 00:15:47.938]  Just previous to that, last week where they called specifically for M4s to be censored, and Twitter, Facebook, and others, YouTube admitted they were doing it.
[00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:49.579]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:58.524]  These people are the biggest hypocrites out there, and they're the ones pushing regular courtship being assault, but then covering up for all the real assaults.
[00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:06.548]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses
[00:16:08.095 --> 00:16:13.739]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[00:16:14.439 --> 00:16:16.240]  They fear families living together.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.222]  They fear people loving God.
[00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:23.945]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:32.491]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:40.893]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[00:16:42.474 --> 00:16:48.575]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[00:16:49.456 --> 00:17:02.560]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:10.156]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[00:17:11.437 --> 00:17:19.204]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:22.126]  And so many things will happen.
[00:17:23.327 --> 00:17:24.328]  We are the majority.
[00:17:25.236 --> 00:17:33.965]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:40.132]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:44.023]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:53.072]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[00:17:53.753 --> 00:18:00.119]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:02.882]  So many people write me.
[00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:11.961]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[00:18:12.703 --> 00:18:14.326]  We have to fly our flag.
[00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:16.745]  We have to wear our colors.
[00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:21.687]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:25.207]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:36.670]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.931]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:41.673]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:44.376]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[00:18:44.776 --> 00:18:51.443]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[00:18:51.943 --> 00:18:56.588]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[00:18:57.468 --> 00:19:04.450]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.771]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:25.116]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[00:19:25.896 --> 00:19:34.661]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:39.984]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the Info War.
[00:19:40.024 --> 00:19:51.891]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:52.692]  So please,
[00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:58.476]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:00.437]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:08.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:31.401]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:52.365]  That was a couple days ago, Roger Stone said, get ready to learn about Senator Al Franken grabbing a woman and forcing his tongue down her throat.
[00:20:53.848 --> 00:20:58.589]  But he told me, he said on the story, he's going to be joining us coming up the next hour to give us more details of it.
[00:20:58.609 --> 00:20:59.509]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:18.032]  Leanne Tweeden has a photo of Al Franken while she's asleep, grabbing her breast, when she was part of the USO of entertainers and journalists and other people that were flying over there to be entertainment for the troops and for the sailors and the airmen.
[00:21:19.293 --> 00:21:21.393]  Like her husband, that's in the military.
[00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.918]  And he assaulted her, according to her, behind closed doors.
[00:21:26.398 --> 00:21:30.401]  She then stayed away from him for the several weeks they were overseas in the Middle East.
[00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:34.585]  And then, on the flight back, he did it again and photographed it.
[00:21:36.286 --> 00:21:43.032]  And it was part of the official USO photo package they sent around to members of it.
[00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:44.813]  Like it was a joke.
[00:21:44.873 --> 00:21:45.754]  And who was in charge?
[00:21:46.314 --> 00:21:47.035]  Al Franken.
[00:21:47.415 --> 00:21:49.176]  He decided to leave that in there.
[00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:50.838]  And then give her a copy.
[00:21:52.284 --> 00:21:57.668]  That's the Harvey Weinstein, the Al Franken arrogance, the Bill Clinton arrogance.
[00:21:57.748 --> 00:22:03.953]  And I'm here to tell you, he needs to step down now, according to his yardstick.
[00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:09.337]  Because if a woman accuses you, you're guilty, according to the left's yardstick.
[00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:19.465]  Well, buddy, we've got a photo of you, and clearly, one of the hands is on her breast.
[00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:20.826]  You can see it's touching it.
[00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:26.455]  The other hand, it looks like maybe touching, but she says you groped her again.
[00:22:27.335 --> 00:22:35.277]  And you're on camera doing it, and everybody's clearly asleep, and you're creeping around in an airplane.
[00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:43.800]  Could you imagine if you're walking back to use the bathroom on an airplane, an overseas flight, and there's an attractive woman, and you just pause and take a photo like you're grabbing her breast?
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.200]  That's pervert behavior!
[00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.432]  That is degrading somebody.
[00:22:49.413 --> 00:22:52.756]  That is robbing their personal space.
[00:22:53.477 --> 00:22:55.419]  That is sexualizing them.
[00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:58.082]  It's like a form of revenge porn, basically.
[00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:03.858]  And look, Al Franken was known to be deranged in Hollywood.
[00:23:04.618 --> 00:23:06.638]  He was known to be deranged as a comedian.
[00:23:07.338 --> 00:23:12.560]  He's a deranged, anti-gun, anti-God, anti-family sack of garbage.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.441]  And he's been calling for yours truly to be censored, for the Drudge Report to be censored.
[00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:25.643]  He said at Senate hearings this week, on Monday, anybody that's been implicated in connection to Russia, i.e.
[00:23:25.883 --> 00:23:26.923]  DrudgeReport.com,
[00:23:28.112 --> 00:23:33.355]  Infowars.com needs to be banned from social media, and they've been calling for that.
[00:23:34.756 --> 00:23:36.797]  By name in the committee hearings!
[00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:49.445]  So this guy wants to shut up the First Amendment, he wants to triple red scare, call me some type of Russian agent, with no evidence, with zero evidence.
[00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:55.249]  He's got the chutzpah to do that, the bravado, the arrogance.
[00:23:57.168 --> 00:24:01.669]  And then he also, he's been in the news, that Judge Roy Moore should resign.
[00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:03.530]  Al Franken was in the news last week.
[00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:10.872]  We don't have a photo of Judge Roy Moore grabbing a woman's breast and smiling like a pervert, like a rapist.
[00:24:11.312 --> 00:24:14.093]  Now, we're now learning that a bunch of the women are fake.
[00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:17.054]  We're now learning that Judge Roy Moore didn't get thrown out of the mall.
[00:24:17.927 --> 00:24:20.849]  But I'm still here to tell you, I don't like it.
[00:24:21.629 --> 00:24:22.650]  I think there's something there.
[00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.710]  I think it's exaggerated.
[00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.131]  The Democrats jumped on it.
[00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:26.832]  It's an old Southern thing.
[00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:30.374]  I was just talking to some ladies last night, high-powered lawyers and people.
[00:24:30.394 --> 00:24:38.478]  They're like, well, you're not supposed to say it, but in Alabama 35 years ago, families would want their 17, 18-year-old daughter to date the 35-year-old rich guy.
[00:24:39.158 --> 00:24:42.020]  It wasn't like arranged marriage in the Middle East.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.242]  That's really bad, but it's like a couple steps above it.
[00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:47.642]  And I think it's creepy.
[00:24:47.922 --> 00:24:48.682]  I mean, I don't like it.
[00:24:48.782 --> 00:25:02.407]  I've got daughters, and if somebody came to the door, a 35-year-old man, when they were 15 years old, and said, your daughter sure is a sweet young thing, I'd like to take her out, I'd say, listen buddy, get off my porch and stay away from my daughter.
[00:25:03.747 --> 00:25:11.790]  And if I caught the person again, at say a hamburger place or something, when my teenage daughter was there, I'd say, listen buddy,
[00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:17.307]  Stop trying to rob the Cradle or you'll get your ass stomped!
[00:25:18.548 --> 00:25:20.229]  That's word for word what I'd say, but here's the difference.
[00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:30.335]  The thinking in the Old South is, this has been in the news by the way, is well what if your daughter ends up with a thug or a criminal or you know some 17 year old gets her pregnant when she's 17.
[00:25:30.615 --> 00:25:34.678]  The idea is, oh shop your daughters around to the old rich guys.
[00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:37.479]  What do you think sororities are, folks?
[00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:44.901]  Those girls, most of them aren't going to college in these systems to try to actually get degrees or to actually get jobs in the world.
[00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:46.641]  They're looking for rich husbands.
[00:25:47.021 --> 00:25:48.382]  And by the way, I've got three daughters.
[00:25:48.502 --> 00:25:49.502]  I don't like that model.
[00:25:50.002 --> 00:25:53.503]  If my daughters want to be rocket scientists or president of the U.S.
[00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:56.484]  or in the military, more power to them!
[00:25:58.904 --> 00:25:59.585]  Absolutely!
[00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:03.946]  My family's always had trailblazing women in it.
[00:26:04.892 --> 00:26:13.836]  But at the same time, there's an attack on femininity, there's an attack on the power that women have, and the gravitas of that goddess energy that God's, you know, given them.
[00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:25.422]  And that's under attack, and the globalists want to control it and make women think they're their protectors, when the liberal Hollywood globalist system is a pimp that wants to control and enslave women.
[00:26:26.282 --> 00:26:31.545]  And then it wants to be the arbiter that's in control of what is good and what's bad for women and families.
[00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:40.619]  Judge Roy Moore has done 1% compared to what we know about Harvey Weinstein's 10,000%.
[00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:51.235]  Rape, assault, cover-ups, intimidation, payoffs, while pushing a liberal anti-family, anti-nuclear family agenda.
[00:26:51.475 --> 00:26:53.596]  So he's got the royal flush of corruption.
[00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:58.279]  Kevin Spacey, raping young men, raping boys, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:26:58.519 --> 00:26:59.260]  It's all coming out.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.141]  Totally protected a demon.
[00:27:01.301 --> 00:27:03.323]  His father, the same thing to him and his brother.
[00:27:05.404 --> 00:27:07.245]  So the abused becoming the abuser.
[00:27:07.685 --> 00:27:11.428]  And then you've got Roy Moore with some really
[00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:19.099]  Backwards type, super ultra right wing, arranged marriage type stuff.
[00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:19.659]  And you know what?
[00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:23.780]  There might be, when you start getting into that, there might be some other weird stuff going on.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.121]  I'm not saying Roy Moore is innocent.
[00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:32.843]  But I think with him, if you're going to call for him to step down and have Republicans line up like he is the devil.
[00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.591]  Then baby, we got devils far worse, and they better be out of the U.S.
[00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:39.911]  Senate.
[00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:45.952]  And creepy Joe Biden, I got hours of footage, we posted a bunch of it on Infowars.com yesterday.
[00:27:46.593 --> 00:27:47.553]  Creepy Joe Biden.
[00:27:48.453 --> 00:27:49.973]  Creepy, creepy, creepy.
[00:27:50.393 --> 00:28:01.756]  He's just all over people's kids, and fathers have got to push him away, and Senator Sessions' granddaughter's up there, and creepy Biden makes a run for it, and Sessions slaps his hand off.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:10.786]  And it's, oh, and they'll have these little girls on the shoulder rubbing him and just keeping his hands there and then running his hands through their hair and touching their ears.
[00:28:10.946 --> 00:28:12.728]  It is sexual.
[00:28:13.648 --> 00:28:15.610]  It is sexual.
[00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.191]  Anyone could see it.
[00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:21.355]  If she was a full grown woman, you'd say, what in the hell is he doing?
[00:28:21.635 --> 00:28:27.059]  Is that his wife on TV running his fingers through that other woman's hair or squeezing their shoulders?
[00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:29.581]  And in some shots he gets behind him, you can tell he's rubbing their butt.
[00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:31.503]  They start looking around like, what are you doing?
[00:28:33.484 --> 00:28:34.465]  What is creeping?
[00:28:34.705 --> 00:28:38.949]  We've got Harvey Weinstein on C-SPAN, but his name's Joe Biden!
[00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.471]  But where is it in the news?
[00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:45.835]  See, the media wants you to go, oh look, Christian conservatives, they're all perverts!
[00:28:46.216 --> 00:28:55.023]  And forget all the pedophiles in Hollywood, all the massive evidence, all of it, and make it about Judge Roy Moore, and then make up stuff about him that isn't true!
[00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:59.307]  That's what I'm saying, a lot of it isn't true, a lot of it's disproven.
[00:28:59.527 --> 00:28:59.928]  We'll be back.
[00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.071]  Let's talk to Danny.
[00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:08.952]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[00:29:08.972 --> 00:29:09.673]  You're on the air, Danny.
[00:29:10.074 --> 00:29:10.294]  Hi.
[00:29:10.394 --> 00:29:15.361]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:15.701]  Thank you.
[00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:24.693]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:37.864]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[00:29:37.924 --> 00:29:47.212]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[00:29:47.632 --> 00:29:51.796]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[00:29:52.436 --> 00:29:54.257]  And it reboots itself.
[00:29:54.338 --> 00:29:56.759]  So, I mean, think about that.
[00:29:57.159 --> 00:30:08.627]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[00:30:08.727 --> 00:30:09.408]  Let me be clear.
[00:30:09.528 --> 00:30:16.693]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[00:30:17.353 --> 00:30:22.160]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.061]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[00:30:23.362 --> 00:30:26.606]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[00:30:26.947 --> 00:30:28.328]  I took DNA for a few months.
[00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:29.630]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:30.952]  The feeling is back.
[00:30:31.112 --> 00:30:32.775]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:34.417]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[00:30:34.677 --> 00:30:45.142]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[00:30:45.202 --> 00:30:47.423]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[00:30:47.483 --> 00:30:49.704]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[00:30:49.744 --> 00:30:52.706]  Each person's different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:54.626]  But we're running the biggest specials.
[00:30:54.646 --> 00:30:59.609]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:10.479]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:12.361]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[00:31:13.422 --> 00:31:18.006]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:19.967]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.

[00:31:22.189 --> 00:31:27.254]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:31:27.454 --> 00:31:29.055]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[00:31:29.796 --> 00:31:34.860]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:35.760]  Secret 12.
[00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.122]  Optimal absorption.
[00:31:38.402 --> 00:31:43.106]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:31:43.546 --> 00:31:47.729]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.451]  Optimum levels.
[00:31:50.892 --> 00:31:54.734]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:08.125]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:27.893 --> 00:33:32.038]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:08.018 --> 00:34:11.039]  I tell you, Al Franken is in a lot of trouble.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.741]  He's a big, fat hypocrite.
[00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:17.002]  He demonizes families.
[00:34:17.042 --> 00:34:18.262]  He demonizes conservatives.
[00:34:18.962 --> 00:34:20.343]  He's gone after Judge Roy Moore.
[00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:28.926]  There's a lot more evidence that he assaulted a woman than there is that Roy Moore assaulted teenage girls.
[00:34:29.787 --> 00:34:31.447]  I'm not defending Roy Moore.
[00:34:31.547 --> 00:34:35.069]  I think it's a weird practice and archaic to try to date 16, 17 year old women.
[00:34:37.276 --> 00:34:47.020]  I understand the archaic practice is done so that you can control who your daughter ends up being with by the time that they become full-blown women.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:58.004]  But nevertheless, it's got a real creep factory factor for me, especially going on still 35 years ago.
[00:34:58.644 --> 00:35:02.926]  That said, a bunch of what they say about Moore has been disproven.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.561]  That he was kicked out of the mall.
[00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:06.401]  Never happened.
[00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:06.922]  Made up.
[00:35:06.962 --> 00:35:08.243]  The mall manager and owner says.
[00:35:08.663 --> 00:35:09.264]  Just not true.
[00:35:10.344 --> 00:35:12.286]  A bunch of the stories, it turns out, aren't true.
[00:35:12.626 --> 00:35:13.807]  Democratic Party operatives.
[00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:15.468]  They're demanding evidence.
[00:35:15.588 --> 00:35:16.509]  People aren't presenting.
[00:35:16.549 --> 00:35:20.352]  And women are scrubbing their websites and basically backing down.
[00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:29.378]  But some of it could be true because this stuff is so pervasive in the power structure and in people that want to be in power and people that run for office.
[00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:32.961]  A large minority of people that run for office are
[00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:34.459]  Predators.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.001]  And they're seeking after power.
[00:35:37.121 --> 00:35:38.402]  They're not seeking after justice.
[00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:49.769]  And so they manifest their lawlessness once they believe they're in the power structure and believe that they are above the law.
[00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.771]  There's a long 20-minute interview with Leanne Tweeden.
[00:35:56.933 --> 00:36:00.276]  And again, it isn't just that he came on to her once and tried to kiss her.
[00:36:00.956 --> 00:36:02.357]  He grabbed her and forced it.
[00:36:06.658 --> 00:36:23.683]  And then he was mean to her, and then he called her names and harassed her for weeks and weeks on the USO tour for the troops, and then he took a photo of her asleep on the C-130 flying back on the 30-plus hour flight, grabbing her breasts.
[00:36:28.584 --> 00:36:32.145]  Roper Al Franken, Lecture Conservatives on Respecting Women.
[00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:35.686]  Got another male feminist exposed, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:36:37.176 --> 00:36:39.978]  Infowars.com.
[00:36:40.978 --> 00:36:43.800]  Now, I'm not going to play the whole 22-minute clip.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.321]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:36:45.581 --> 00:36:46.842]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:36:48.023 --> 00:36:56.308]  But Fox has a nice boil-down, plus some video, and I think she comes off very, very, very, very credibly.
[00:36:57.068 --> 00:36:57.728]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:36:58.129 --> 00:36:59.490]  There are villains that are men.
[00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.391]  There are heroes that are men.
[00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:03.320]  There are regular guys.
[00:37:03.761 --> 00:37:04.541]  There are bad guys.
[00:37:04.802 --> 00:37:08.525]  There are hero women and just regular women and then very predatory women.
[00:37:10.247 --> 00:37:12.829]  There are women that throw themselves at you in the workplace.
[00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:17.394]  There are women that then use that power.
[00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:18.875]  We've seen
[00:37:20.228 --> 00:37:25.510]  A bunch of cases of this with the lacrosse team and the black topless dancer that made it all up.
[00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:32.372]  And we've seen the other cases of women that were caught telling professors, you better keep having sex with me or I'm going to say you raped me.
[00:37:34.373 --> 00:37:37.874]  And even after the cops basically, you know, in a famous case, caught the woman doing that.
[00:37:38.634 --> 00:37:40.595]  She said, fine, I'm withdrawing my criminal complaint.
[00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:48.898]  She just went out to the university and just made it up because that's what you're supposed to do to be a celebrity now.
[00:37:50.026 --> 00:37:55.632]  But I'm not belittling sexual assaults on women because I know it goes on.
[00:37:57.034 --> 00:37:57.694]  And it's wrong.
[00:37:59.717 --> 00:38:02.440]  And I've had people close to me in my family.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.383]  One of them when they were in college.
[00:38:07.728 --> 00:38:10.269]  There was one part of the building that was men, the other part was women.
[00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:13.170]  All of a sudden the woman wakes up, there's two guys, hold her down, rape her.
[00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.512]  This stuff goes on, ladies and gentlemen, it's horrible, it's suffocating, it's evil.
[00:38:18.032 --> 00:38:19.753]  But again, you never hear about it with men, do you?
[00:38:19.773 --> 00:38:24.574]  80% of it, roughly, is estimated by experts in Hollywood to be men being assaulted.
[00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:26.655]  And why?
[00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:30.837]  Because men will stay quiet about it because you think it's embarrassing to be a woman and be raped?
[00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:33.918]  How about you're a man and you get raped?
[00:38:36.687 --> 00:38:47.159]  It was embarrassing for me to talk about the three times Hollywood producers, the actors are just minions, the producers were like, how you doing?
[00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:49.902]  Grab you right by the genitals as an act of power.
[00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:52.145]  And you're like, I'll knock you upside the head.
[00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:52.686]  You do that again.
[00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:55.028]  And then by the end of the meeting, they're like shaking, scared of you.
[00:38:56.104 --> 00:38:56.825]  Alright, be careful.
[00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:58.006]  Are you threatening me?
[00:38:58.026 --> 00:39:04.072]  I mean, literally, after one guy grabbed me by the huevos one time an hour later at the meeting, he was scared.
[00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:06.594]  I told him, I'll knock you upside the head, bro.
[00:39:08.856 --> 00:39:11.479]  But the point is that most people, they get dominated by that.
[00:39:11.499 --> 00:39:17.705]  The reason I didn't punch the one guy at one time was because it was so shocking the first time it happened.
[00:39:17.745 --> 00:39:20.768]  I'm like, it didn't hurt, but it was like,
[00:39:21.758 --> 00:39:36.442]  Firm handshake, like when Crocodile Dundee, as I've said, is checking to see if a woman's really a woman, because he's run into, I guess the word's crossdressers, or drag queens, whatever political correct word I'm supposed to use today.
[00:39:37.482 --> 00:39:41.863]  It's just absolutely insane that we've gotten to this point in civilization.
[00:39:42.124 --> 00:39:50.926]  But the media and the social engineers are seizing on it to blur the line, to blur the line,
[00:39:52.597 --> 00:39:55.898]  between normal sexual friction in mammals.
[00:39:56.659 --> 00:39:59.720]  I mean, you go to Europe, you go to Italy, and you're with a good-looking woman.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.901]  I was in Italy a few years ago with my wife, my second wife.
[00:40:04.161 --> 00:40:04.942]  We weren't married yet.
[00:40:05.702 --> 00:40:08.123]  And, you know, she's a very attractive woman.
[00:40:09.483 --> 00:40:14.025]  And, you know, she was with me, and still the guys were whistling and, you know,
[00:40:15.436 --> 00:40:21.657]  And a few times she went to a store without me from the hotel and she said, man, those guys were all over me, grabbing my butt, you name it.
[00:40:22.557 --> 00:40:26.738]  And, you know, she's kind of a happy-go-lucky nice person.
[00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:28.238]  She just swat them away and everything.
[00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:32.719]  But the point is, is that that's what mammals do.
[00:40:34.019 --> 00:40:36.860]  Male deer are in the rut right now in the United States.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.100]  White-tailed deer, mule, you name it.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.881]  And they are chasing females around.
[00:40:42.847 --> 00:40:50.843]  And they're fighting in front of females, and the females are watching to see who's the most aggressive and who's the most handsome and, you know, who's pushing the envelope.
[00:40:51.544 --> 00:40:53.608]  And that's what goes on.
[00:40:54.727 --> 00:40:55.468]  And there's friction.
[00:40:55.908 --> 00:41:08.563]  And so guys are going to whistle at you, and guys are going to ask you out, and guys are going to... And they're acting in school now that, like, a guy asking a girl out or turning red when he sees her or handing her notes is harassment.
[00:41:08.903 --> 00:41:13.469]  Or then, if she turns him down, he might be a jerk and tell people she's a slut.
[00:41:14.727 --> 00:41:18.869]  And sure, it hurts people's feelings, and it shouldn't happen, and somebody's dad ought to kick their butt.
[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:25.754]  But the point is, you turn them into victims when you make a huge deal of it and say, oh, let's put you on Prozac, honey.
[00:41:26.374 --> 00:41:27.495]  Somebody was rude to you.
[00:41:28.375 --> 00:41:34.799]  So that type of stuff is normal mammalian friction.
[00:41:35.919 --> 00:41:38.141]  But now they have all these microaggressions.
[00:41:40.815 --> 00:41:52.283]  And the so-called feminist groups that just want to control women and get women in the workforce forcibly and control them and run their lives by social engineers hired by the US government and British government a hundred years ago.
[00:41:52.323 --> 00:41:53.944]  It's all declassified and they've done it.
[00:41:54.684 --> 00:41:57.026]  The state's taking control of the family.
[00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:57.767]  That's the goal.
[00:41:59.788 --> 00:42:04.531]  And so microaggression, the new workplace bigotry, there's never a way to be fair.
[00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.092]  There's never a way to get along.
[00:42:06.292 --> 00:42:08.494]  There's never a way to actually make people happy.
[00:42:09.602 --> 00:42:20.106]  And then the left uses all of these things and says things like, I had a disability, even though you didn't know about my disability, I think you made fun of my disability, so I'm gonna go to the EEOC.
[00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:22.727]  They've had cases like that in the news.
[00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:31.234]  The New York Times had an article out two days ago saying, can my children be friends with white people?
[00:42:31.494 --> 00:42:39.238]  And it goes on and says, even if you're interracial and all these other things, you need to grovel and worship black people or you are racist and I can't be associated with you.
[00:42:39.578 --> 00:42:41.319]  It's a cult of bullying.
[00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:42.579]  It's insane.
[00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:47.241]  And all it does is hamstring the people that are trying to deploy the political correctness.
[00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:50.783]  They wonder why they end up totally alone without jobs and alone.
[00:42:51.343 --> 00:42:52.624]  We confirm suspicions, Ed Veritas.
[00:42:52.784 --> 00:42:58.449]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:01.031]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:43:13.962 --> 00:43:18.304]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:43:18.684 --> 00:43:38.951]  After just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:42.352]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[00:43:42.412 --> 00:43:44.112]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:43:44.312 --> 00:43:54.156]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:43:54.496 --> 00:43:58.437]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:01.803]  This information being weaponized.
[00:44:01.863 --> 00:44:04.106]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:44:04.526 --> 00:44:09.071]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:10.933]  I will not let you down.
[00:44:11.073 --> 00:44:13.976]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:44:14.396 --> 00:44:16.018]  How quickly can you act?
[00:44:16.318 --> 00:44:21.924]  And what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:31.139]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:47.030]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:50.672]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[00:44:51.013 --> 00:44:52.133]  The system self-corrected.
[00:44:52.254 --> 00:44:55.076]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:44:55.096 --> 00:44:57.357]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:44:58.538 --> 00:44:59.339]  But you saw this?
[00:44:59.539 --> 00:45:00.279]  USA Today.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.780]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.342]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:45:04.382 --> 00:45:05.563]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:07.283]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[00:45:07.323 --> 00:45:09.144]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[00:45:09.184 --> 00:45:17.066]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[00:45:17.086 --> 00:45:22.247]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[00:45:25.408 --> 00:45:29.369]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.650]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:45:32.901 --> 00:45:35.664]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[00:45:36.605 --> 00:45:48.596]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone, because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[00:45:50.638 --> 00:46:14.927]  Super blue colloidal silver fluoride free mouthwash 50% off out of mineral fusion so 50% off but we've added caveman true paleo formula it's so amazing that people love so much that's 50% off as well free shipping it's got to end z shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list the amazing heavy metal detoxifier this is the newest shirt that I want to be our bestseller that I personally wear
[00:46:15.427 --> 00:46:17.509]  Around town now, it's my favorite shirt of all time.
[00:46:17.669 --> 00:46:24.254]  It says, Won't Thread on Me, Infowars.com on the right-hand shoulder of the American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[00:46:24.914 --> 00:46:28.257]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[00:46:28.597 --> 00:46:39.906]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake, very iconic, with Infowars.com in Dayglo yellow on the back, and Infowars.com with the American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:40.927]  We also have Infowars
[00:46:41.747 --> 00:46:43.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:25.843]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[00:47:25.863 --> 00:47:29.108]  He is Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.217 --> 00:47:38.138]  So, Al Franken is in hot, hot water.
[00:47:39.078 --> 00:47:43.400]  He has a very credible woman who's a talk show host, a model, entertainer.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.840]  Great record with the USO.
[00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:49.541]  Coming out and saying that he basically sexually assaulted her.
[00:47:49.962 --> 00:47:51.962]  Grabbed her, forced herself on her, kissed her.
[00:47:52.042 --> 00:47:52.762]  She said, get away.
[00:47:52.782 --> 00:47:58.244]  He, you know, basically tried it again more on the tour when they had to do skits together.
[00:47:58.924 --> 00:48:03.886]  And then she has photos of him once she was asleep on the plane back, grabbing her breast.
[00:48:05.805 --> 00:48:07.268]  And he had the photo taken.
[00:48:07.308 --> 00:48:09.151]  He was in charge of the tour.
[00:48:09.452 --> 00:48:14.541]  He had it put on the memories disc that they gave everybody that participated.
[00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:15.342]  Here's your disc.
[00:48:15.943 --> 00:48:18.768]  Here's your CD with the photos from the month-long trip.
[00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:22.534]  From Uncle Al, and it's him grabbing her breast!
[00:48:22.974 --> 00:48:24.734]  He's so disconnected from reality.
[00:48:24.754 --> 00:48:26.434]  It's like Harvey Weinstein.
[00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:29.775]  Oh, you come watch me shower, then you give me oral sex.
[00:48:30.075 --> 00:48:30.855]  Don't say no.
[00:48:31.235 --> 00:48:32.116]  Everybody does this.
[00:48:32.296 --> 00:48:32.956]  I'm used to it.
[00:48:33.056 --> 00:48:33.776]  Give me what I want.
[00:48:34.276 --> 00:48:34.536]  No.
[00:48:34.856 --> 00:48:35.456]  No, please.
[00:48:35.596 --> 00:48:36.257]  I don't want to.
[00:48:36.717 --> 00:48:37.717]  No, no, please.
[00:48:37.897 --> 00:48:38.517]  No, no, no.
[00:48:40.778 --> 00:48:42.038]  It's all about the humiliation.
[00:48:43.618 --> 00:48:44.858]  It's all about the domination.
[00:48:45.439 --> 00:48:46.839]  It's not like a chase or something.
[00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:53.534]  Or where the woman acts a little bit like, and then she embraces you or plays hard to get, which is pretty clear when a woman's doing that.
[00:48:53.774 --> 00:49:01.679]  These are women pushing themselves away when they've never dated him, never wanted to be with him, and he just backstage in the dark comes over and grabs them.
[00:49:03.481 --> 00:49:04.301]  He's in big trouble.
[00:49:04.602 --> 00:49:13.788]  Here's a boil down of some of the, I don't want to say allegations, he's the one that had a photo taken of him groping her when she was asleep, creeping up like a vampire.
[00:49:14.048 --> 00:49:15.169]  Let's take a look at this guy.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.961]  Fox News Alert!
[00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:22.565]  Bombshell new allegations against Democratic Senator Al Franken.
[00:49:22.625 --> 00:49:26.909]  That senator now accused of groping and kissing a woman without her consent.
[00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:28.070]  She was asleep.
[00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:29.772]  Eleven years ago.
[00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:32.475]  Doug McKelway is live in Washington with the latest, Doug.
[00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.690]  Hi, Harris.
[00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:39.197]  The accuser is Leanne Tweeden, the news anchor on KABC Radio's McIntyre in the Morning program.
[00:49:39.637 --> 00:49:45.645]  She's a former hostess at Hooters, a winner of the Venus International Model Search, and has done modeling work for Fredericks of Hollywood.
[00:49:46.146 --> 00:49:51.813]  She alleges that in December of 2006, during a USO tour, Al Franken, who was not yet then a senator,
[00:49:52.273 --> 00:49:56.256]  wrote a comedy skit for her and him that included lots of sexual innuendo.
[00:49:56.296 --> 00:49:57.597]  It also included a kiss.
[00:49:58.157 --> 00:50:00.939]  He allegedly asked her to rehearse the skit and the kiss.
[00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:05.642]  She replied, this is not Saturday Night Live and refused to include the kiss in the rehearsals.
[00:50:06.122 --> 00:50:09.825]  He allegedly persisted relentlessly and she ultimately gave in.
[00:50:11.377 --> 00:50:15.700]  He came at me and before I even knew it, he grabbed the, he put his hand on the back of my head.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.240]  Hit pause.
[00:50:16.801 --> 00:50:17.881]  Back that up five seconds.
[00:50:18.462 --> 00:50:19.763]  She didn't give in.
[00:50:20.663 --> 00:50:22.184]  She said no in the rehearsals.
[00:50:22.465 --> 00:50:27.168]  He grabs her behind the stage, that's the full transcript, and shoves his tongue down her throat.
[00:50:29.369 --> 00:50:33.912]  So, back it up to what that guy just said, because that's a misrepresentation.
[00:50:34.713 --> 00:50:36.054]  But I'm expanding on this right now.
[00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:44.312]  This is the pig that wants to ban conservatives' free speech from social media.
[00:50:44.532 --> 00:50:45.012]  Let's go back.
[00:50:47.853 --> 00:50:52.936]  Then a senator wrote a comedy skit for her and him that included lots of sexual innuendo.
[00:50:52.996 --> 00:50:54.277]  It also included a kiss.
[00:50:54.837 --> 00:50:57.618]  He allegedly asked her to rehearse the skit and the kiss.
[00:50:57.998 --> 00:51:02.321]  She replied, this is not Saturday Night Live, and refused to include the kiss in the rehearsals.
[00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:06.523]  He allegedly persisted relentlessly, and she ultimately gave in.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.000]  She did not!
[00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.516]  He says the tour wrapped up on Christmas Eve.
[00:51:29.857 --> 00:51:33.899]  Exhausted, they boarded an Air Force C-17 for the trip home from Afghanistan.
[00:51:33.919 --> 00:51:38.922]  She says, quote, I immediately fell asleep even though I was still wearing my flak vest and Kevlar helmet.
[00:51:39.403 --> 00:51:41.064]  It wasn't until I was back in the U.S.
[00:51:41.104 --> 00:51:45.486]  and looking through the CD of photos that we were given by the photographer that I saw this one.
[00:51:46.727 --> 00:51:51.328]  She alleges in this photograph that he groped me without my consent while I was asleep.
[00:51:51.368 --> 00:51:52.969]  I felt violated all over again.
[00:51:53.049 --> 00:51:55.049]  Embarrassed, belittled, humiliated, she says.
[00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:59.190]  How dare anyone grab my breast like this and think it's funny?
[00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:07.972]  In a statement today, Senator Franken said, I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leanne.
[00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:09.313]  Oh my gosh, turn it off.
[00:52:09.913 --> 00:52:14.274]  I don't know who that reporter is, and I'm not trying to start a fight with that reporter, but
[00:52:15.911 --> 00:52:17.732]  She said, I said, no, no, no.
[00:52:18.033 --> 00:52:21.035]  He grabbed me, forced his face on me.
[00:52:21.395 --> 00:52:22.195]  I pushed him off.
[00:52:22.516 --> 00:52:23.997]  That is not giving in!
[00:52:25.197 --> 00:52:26.078]  Who is that guy?
[00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:29.881]  I mean, I'm just so sick of the twisting here.
[00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:33.463]  She did not indicate in any way she gave in.
[00:52:34.644 --> 00:52:37.066]  So what is this half-assed defense of Al Franken?
[00:52:37.666 --> 00:52:38.847]  I'm not putting up with this anymore.
[00:52:38.887 --> 00:52:41.328]  And one of the crew members made a great point.
[00:52:41.368 --> 00:52:44.871]  She said, notice that Trump didn't endorse Roy Moore.
[00:52:46.502 --> 00:52:48.904]  And notice, he must have gotten some intel, others didn't.
[00:52:50.185 --> 00:52:53.748]  And then notice, he's had his great trip in Asia, and has stayed out of all this.
[00:52:53.868 --> 00:53:06.378]  And by the way, coming up after Roger Stone joins us, he told me about this, not two days ago, it was a day and a half ago, I guess it'd be like Tuesday night or something, that, oh wait, Al Franken, it's about to happen.
[00:53:07.499 --> 00:53:11.102]  Bunch of accusations, bunch of women, and I said, oh really, what?
[00:53:11.142 --> 00:53:14.125]  He goes, well, grabbing a woman, forced his tongue down her throat, roping her.
[00:53:15.046 --> 00:53:17.967]  Boom, walk in today, there it is, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:53:18.768 --> 00:53:20.649]  So we'll be looking at all the angles of that.
[00:53:20.729 --> 00:53:22.870]  But he said more accusers.
[00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.311]  Well, that's now suddenly coming out.
[00:53:25.391 --> 00:53:29.533]  It's now being reported more women are set to come out on Al Franken.
[00:53:29.993 --> 00:53:32.374]  So will it turn into a Weinstein deal with underage women?
[00:53:32.614 --> 00:53:33.615]  Will it just go on and on?
[00:53:33.855 --> 00:53:34.995]  And we've got evidence here.
[00:53:35.596 --> 00:53:38.117]  We've got evidence that we don't have with Roy Moore.
[00:53:38.877 --> 00:53:39.938]  We've got actual photo.
[00:53:41.078 --> 00:53:43.339]  But again, I'm not defending Moore.
[00:53:45.362 --> 00:53:48.764]  You know, I was courting 16-year-old women when I was 35.
[00:53:48.864 --> 00:53:54.167]  It ain't illegal, brother, but I think it's creepy and I don't like it.
[00:53:55.067 --> 00:53:56.968]  And I understand this is 35 years ago in Alabama.
[00:53:58.189 --> 00:53:58.689]  I understand.
[00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.591]  Most people got married when they were 16 on the wagon trails.
[00:54:02.691 --> 00:54:03.112]  I get it.
[00:54:03.892 --> 00:54:13.637]  Once little Missy, you know, was a woman and she took a liking to Bob's son while they got married right there by the river when they were 16.
[00:54:13.737 --> 00:54:14.498]  I get that part.
[00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:22.985]  The point is, is that this is the 21st century, and I guess I am a little bit of a conservative when it comes to that.
[00:54:23.025 --> 00:54:29.769]  There's kind of this other end of conservatism that's so conservative, you know, that you marry your daughter off when she's 16 because you know it's a good Christian man.
[00:54:30.249 --> 00:54:30.830]  And you know what?
[00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:35.192]  If the guy's 20 years old and is a hard-working guy, good, that's great.
[00:54:35.252 --> 00:54:37.453]  It just gets weird when they're 35.
[00:54:37.494 --> 00:54:39.595]  But I digress, and I'm sorry.
[00:54:39.615 --> 00:54:40.815]  I just keep digressing.
[00:54:41.316 --> 00:54:43.237]  I want to be able to think Roy Moore is a good guy.
[00:54:44.548 --> 00:54:53.235]  If they're not going to get rid of Al Franken, if they're not going to get rid of Weinstein, if they're not going to get rid of all these other folks, or Bill Clinton, then I think, you know, say, I guess, make Roy Moore President.
[00:54:53.255 --> 00:54:54.356]  He's not as bad as Bill Clinton.
[00:54:54.376 --> 00:54:56.217]  I don't think he's a bad man politically.
[00:54:56.257 --> 00:54:58.819]  I think he's got a good stance, is what he did, you know, in government.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.962]  And as a judge, I'm just, I'm just there.
[00:55:02.022 --> 00:55:03.864]  I don't support the Democrats acting like this.
[00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.865]  I don't support the Republicans acting like this.
[00:55:06.205 --> 00:55:08.767]  And it just shows a crazy culture and a crazy society.
[00:55:09.628 --> 00:55:14.772]  And maybe I'm just prejudiced because when I was 16, I was looking at 30-year-old women and just drooling.
[00:55:14.892 --> 00:55:18.514]  I mean, I just always, you know, when I was 12, I wanted the 16-year-old.
[00:55:18.534 --> 00:55:20.375]  When I was 16, I wanted the 25-year-old.
[00:55:21.096 --> 00:55:28.741]  And I just, it's just the bigger, better, full-engined, you know, high-horsepower women, you know what I mean?
[00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:30.963]  That's what I want is the real McCoy.
[00:55:31.723 --> 00:55:35.426]  And so I just don't get men that want a girl that's like a kid.
[00:55:35.446 --> 00:55:36.947]  I just don't get it.
[00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:43.604]  I just could not imagine being 44 years old and dating an 18-year-old woman or a 17-year-old woman.
[00:55:43.664 --> 00:55:45.105]  It sounds like a nightmare, quite frankly.
[00:55:45.645 --> 00:55:48.207]  Okay, let's stop right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:49.647 --> 00:55:50.988]  But, like, I'm married very happily.
[00:55:51.008 --> 00:55:51.488]  I love my wife.
[00:55:51.508 --> 00:55:57.872]  But, like, smart businesswomen and stuff that are super savvy, like, there's something about the looks and the intellect and the experience.
[00:55:57.972 --> 00:55:58.912]  That's sexy, man.
[00:56:00.553 --> 00:56:01.854]  Dating some 17-year-old girl?
[00:56:01.894 --> 00:56:03.535]  That sounds like a nightmare.
[00:56:04.787 --> 00:56:05.147]  Nightmare.
[00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:06.489]  But see, I'm mature.
[00:56:06.609 --> 00:56:07.429]  I want a challenge.
[00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.913]  I don't need arrested development where I feel like I'm over somebody.
[00:56:11.933 --> 00:56:13.515]  See, that's the difference, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:13.835 --> 00:56:15.136]  And that's this corruption of the youth.
[00:56:15.196 --> 00:56:17.078]  And I'm tired of it, and I'm sick of it.
[00:56:17.098 --> 00:56:17.959]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:23.134]  There's no way for me to plug this new product properly, so I'm not even going to do it this hour.
[00:56:23.655 --> 00:56:24.977]  I'm so excited about it.
[00:56:25.718 --> 00:56:29.844]  It's going to be a game changer for everybody, but it's also going to help fund the next level of the InfoWar.
[00:56:29.884 --> 00:56:32.267]  You think we've devastated the globalists so far?
[00:56:32.327 --> 00:56:32.728]  Just wait.
[00:56:33.208 --> 00:56:36.052]  Now, we had 10 different things up for sale the last week.
[00:56:37.173 --> 00:56:37.833]  And free shipping.
[00:56:38.454 --> 00:56:38.954]  All of those.
[00:56:39.034 --> 00:56:40.474]  Super Mel Vitality, you name it.
[00:56:41.055 --> 00:56:44.816]  They got down to such low levels that they're essentially sold out, so they're back to regular price.
[00:56:45.737 --> 00:56:49.058]  The free shipping will end Sunday, because we have to.
[00:56:49.718 --> 00:56:51.279]  The free shipping will end Sunday.
[00:56:52.139 --> 00:56:55.861]  We ended the 50% off on the apparel, because we sold out of almost all the shirts.
[00:56:55.921 --> 00:56:57.021]  Thank you for taking action.
[00:56:57.262 --> 00:56:58.082]  It was a great deal.
[00:56:58.302 --> 00:57:01.143]  There'll be a lot of Infowars and Molon Labe shirts out there.
[00:57:01.483 --> 00:57:04.905]  We have the limited edition anti-fascist, anti-communist shirt.
[00:57:06.155 --> 00:57:08.577]  The Trigger's Antifa, that's only for sale for another two weeks.
[00:57:08.617 --> 00:57:11.580]  We have this new shirt of the month, that's available in FullWorthStore.com.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:21.988]  But, we now have two new probiotics that are super ultra high quality and totally healthily produced, but are lower cost.
[00:57:22.008 --> 00:57:30.835]  We did a lot of work to lower the cost, and we have a new digestive enzyme that helps you to digest all your food better, for better digestion, better health, and better
[00:57:31.636 --> 00:57:32.157]  You name it.
[00:57:32.457 --> 00:57:35.981]  Better macro and micronutrition absorption.
[00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:37.943]  The new product is Carnivore.
[00:57:38.384 --> 00:57:39.725]  Massive, massive research.
[00:57:39.765 --> 00:57:41.327]  Free shipping is extended until Sunday.
[00:57:41.807 --> 00:57:43.749]  And it's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:46.532]  The two new probiotics at InfoWare Store.
[00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:49.876]  Floralife, Carnivore, and Floralife.
[00:57:49.976 --> 00:57:50.817]  Everyday maintenance.
[00:57:50.877 --> 00:57:51.538]  InfoWare Store.
[00:58:01.843 --> 00:58:02.330]  Just briefly.
[00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.571]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[00:58:05.611 --> 00:58:06.471]  He's about to retire.
[00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:13.574]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[00:58:13.614 --> 00:58:16.595]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[00:58:16.615 --> 00:58:17.595]  That's a bunch of bull.
[00:58:18.115 --> 00:58:19.196]  You need fluoride or you die.
[00:58:19.756 --> 00:58:22.237]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[00:58:22.257 --> 00:58:23.037]  He said, this is incredible.
[00:58:23.457 --> 00:58:25.438]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[00:58:25.658 --> 00:58:31.360]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.421]  Exactly.
[00:58:32.481 --> 00:58:38.489]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[00:58:38.529 --> 00:58:42.334]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[00:58:43.696 --> 00:58:47.220]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:48.620]  I don't
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.542]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[00:59:09.002 --> 00:59:10.222]  Why does it say nursery water?
[00:59:10.242 --> 00:59:11.503]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[00:59:11.523 --> 00:59:14.424]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[00:59:14.464 --> 00:59:16.445]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:16.625 --> 00:59:26.390]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.190]  But you die without iodine.
[00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.751]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[00:59:29.771 --> 00:59:31.552]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:32.512]  That's a different type of iodine.
[00:59:32.532 --> 00:59:33.933]  This is the real medical grade.
[00:59:34.373 --> 00:59:42.679]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:46.641]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[00:59:54.987 --> 01:00:00.911]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.516 --> 01:00:13.559]  The Black Plague is in Madagascar, and the antibiotics aren't treating it.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:20.423]  You've got tens of thousands of admitted animal-human chimera creations that are on the ground.
[01:00:20.443 --> 01:00:22.564]  The media doesn't even really care.
[01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:26.426]  You've got salmon in the ocean that aren't extincting their regular salmon.
[01:00:26.967 --> 01:00:27.847]  They're part insect.
[01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:31.990]  There's thousands of insane things going on.
[01:00:33.691 --> 01:00:35.732]  Suddenly all these new super cancers are here.
[01:00:38.578 --> 01:00:40.279]  The globalists have gone completely insane.
[01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:44.441]  They don't believe they're gonna merge with computers and become AI gods.
[01:00:47.522 --> 01:00:50.803]  And we're busy talking about pedophiles everywhere.
[01:00:51.384 --> 01:00:57.546]  Raping women, groping men, raping men, raping women, assaulting women, dominating people.
[01:00:57.846 --> 01:00:59.027]  And it's all about power.
[01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:01.188]  It's all about pushing it.
[01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:04.439]  It's all about messing with people.
[01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:06.159]  But we gotta talk about it!
[01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:09.400]  Because sex is how we continue the species.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.861]  It's how we love each other.
[01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:12.321]  It's how we have organizations.
[01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:13.722]  It's how we interface.
[01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:23.605]  Just like everything from fruit flies, up to African elephants, to blue whales, to cottontail bunnies.
[01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:30.747]  And why is there this obsession and this manipulation of sex?
[01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:32.148]  Because sex is power!
[01:01:33.536 --> 01:01:37.859]  It's deciding your whole genetic line before you and this person's genetic line.
[01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:42.121]  Do we want to engage in an activity that's meant to create new people?
[01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:49.426]  Oh no, that's bad, that's dirty, but splicing humans with animals in laboratories that don't have any rights.
[01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:51.087]  Let's have no discussion about that.
[01:01:51.487 --> 01:02:00.473]  Let's have all the fake left virtue signal all day about how men and women together are horrible and it's all rape and we got to regulate it and control it.
[01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:11.620]  Then the right wing's on the other end, you know, saying, if you ever had sex out of wedlock, you're going to hell and it's dirty and you're going to be... Which then just drives everybody into the hands of the system.
[01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:14.801]  It says, have all the sex you ever wanted to have.
[01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:15.322]  It's perfect.
[01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:15.782]  It's wonderful.
[01:02:15.822 --> 01:02:16.242]  It's good.
[01:02:17.042 --> 01:02:18.923]  Not that that dehumanizes you as well.
[01:02:19.743 --> 01:02:20.844]  The other thing dehumanizes you.
[01:02:21.124 --> 01:02:26.426]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:02:26.506 --> 01:02:26.866]  Porn.
[01:02:26.906 --> 01:02:27.386]  Take porn.
[01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:30.828]  I can't even watch it anymore.
[01:02:31.795 --> 01:02:34.377]  And I'm not going to sit up here with our audience and be fake and say I've never seen porn.
[01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:38.359]  I literally... You know what I like?
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:48.064]  I like typing in pin-up girls from the 50s and I'll just sit there for like an hour on my computer looking at women as pin-up girls.
[01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:53.007]  Or like a waitress in a cute skirt and cute outfit.
[01:02:53.087 --> 01:02:54.408]  Like a woman, cute and happy.
[01:02:54.428 --> 01:02:54.988]  That's what I like.
[01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:55.889]  It's like...
[01:02:57.543 --> 01:03:02.224]  Porn's like watching sausage being made or something.
[01:03:02.244 --> 01:03:04.085]  Or like people going to the bathroom.
[01:03:04.465 --> 01:03:05.685]  It's like something two people do.
[01:03:05.705 --> 01:03:06.425]  They love each other.
[01:03:06.485 --> 01:03:10.446]  It just turns into this dehumanization.
[01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:13.667]  The men watching porn aren't getting girlfriends or wives on average.
[01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:15.007]  They're not having children.
[01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:18.408]  And when they finally get a woman, they don't want that!
[01:03:18.808 --> 01:03:22.649]  Because it isn't like what they saw shot in a wide-angle lens.
[01:03:26.417 --> 01:03:31.941]  Or they think, oh, I have a twosome, or a threesome, or a foursome, that'll be the best thing ever, because you saw that in porn.
[01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:36.324]  No, what that is, is a train wreck.
[01:03:37.925 --> 01:03:42.168]  Because the people are all here, there, it's not real, it's not a connection.
[01:03:44.096 --> 01:03:59.028]  The real fulfillment is a man and woman that love each other connected having sex because that's what's designed by God to then create procreation and then the act of love and coming together spiritually as you literally form a new creature.
[01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.330]  Puts the finishing touches on it.
[01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:08.456]  And shows these two people love each other so that they're gonna love this baby they have.
[01:04:12.038 --> 01:04:12.519]  Instead,
[01:04:14.127 --> 01:04:21.211]  of the product of rape, or whatever the case is, and then where's daddy, or mommy doesn't like the child, and that's how you just begin these cultures of evil.
[01:04:22.912 --> 01:04:35.760]  And the cultures where women are suppressed, and where women are controlled, where women are kept like animals, are the low IQ, inbred, failed, desperate, desperado, collapsed systems.
[01:04:37.344 --> 01:04:43.868]  And everything the left pushes is a merger with orthodox Islam that literally cuts women's vaginas off.
[01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:49.131]  And sells them off at nine in unarranged marriages.
[01:04:49.371 --> 01:04:52.133]  You're worried about Roy Moore with arranged marriages at 17?
[01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:57.276]  Roy Moore's only problem is he didn't say cut girls' vaginas off.
[01:04:57.456 --> 01:05:00.858]  If he'd have done that, he'd be leading a march with Linda Sorcerer and the Democratic Party.
[01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:07.851]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:19.014]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.216]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.618]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:23.158 --> 01:06:27.883]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.647 --> 01:06:34.629]  Well, how the mighty have fallen.
[01:06:34.669 --> 01:06:39.074]  The photos up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:06:40.666 --> 01:06:46.890]  DwellasDrugsReport.com, Groper, Al, Franken lecture conservatives on respecting women.
[01:06:47.931 --> 01:06:55.897]  I could not imagine being on an airplane with women that were asleep and then going over and grabbing their breasts, much less
[01:06:57.898 --> 01:07:03.002]  Taking photos of it, and then giving the woman a photo of it later, as he did.
[01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:04.583]  But that's all part of the rubbing it in.
[01:07:04.963 --> 01:07:06.725]  Ten years ago when he thought he was invincible.
[01:07:07.365 --> 01:07:14.711]  Then they want to assault the Christian Midwestern folks who aren't doing things like this, because they see us standing in the way of what they want to do.
[01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:20.075]  But to control the debate, they attack us on our strengths, the fact that we try to honor women.
[01:07:20.515 --> 01:07:21.916]  So we've got Judge Roy Moore,
[01:07:22.793 --> 01:07:24.554]  We're having to back off most of the story now.
[01:07:24.894 --> 01:07:33.760]  Most of the women are Democratic operatives, or they're erasing their Facebooks, or it's not true, or we later learned that he wasn't kicked out of the mall.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:41.425]  But then he admits, I used to go around and ask people to date their 16 and 17-year-old daughters.
[01:07:42.745 --> 01:07:46.687]  Turns out the 14 and 15 stuff hasn't been documented, and then Moore admits that.
[01:07:47.068 --> 01:07:48.949]  I think that's weird.
[01:07:49.509 --> 01:07:53.431]  But, that's now the big ultimate evil, and he has to resign.
[01:07:53.831 --> 01:08:01.076]  Okay, well then, I've got, we'll roll some of these videos, countless, literally hours of footage we've played before.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.944]  Back during the campaign, we were showing Bill Clinton the rapist, Hillary supporting pedophiles, making jokes about it, and then Biden videos.
[01:08:09.124 --> 01:08:15.487]  There's hours of him grabbing little girls, rubbing their hair, rubbing through their hair, rubbing their ears, patting them on the butt.
[01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:18.929]  I mean, and again, a full grown woman would kick him like a mule.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:28.635]  He just does this because this is what pedophiles like, 10, 11, 12 year olds, because they think it's daddy when it's an older man and they don't fight back.
[01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:33.499]  That's what these guys want, is a woman that won't fight back when they dominate them and control them.
[01:08:33.519 --> 01:08:39.205]  So Millie Weaver, you yourself have been sexually raped, assaulted out in California.
[01:08:39.225 --> 01:08:40.707]  There were even case news on it.
[01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:43.450]  We're not going to get into names when that happened, you know, eight, nine years ago.
[01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.711]  Happened to your sister as well.
[01:08:44.731 --> 01:08:50.297]  And of course, you had some success out there in modeling and movies as well, but got out of it and now, you know, happily have a child.
[01:08:50.737 --> 01:08:52.718]  Hooked up and doing a great job.
[01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:22.207]  Who are these people?
[01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:24.108]  I mean, what is going on?
[01:09:24.548 --> 01:09:30.611]  Well, you know, we're at this point where we have a big conundrum, a big argument going on right now.
[01:09:30.911 --> 01:09:37.374]  We have tons of women, tons of even men as children coming forward, having accusations of sexual assault.
[01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:41.636]  And at the same time, some of these accusations kind of seem like they are
[01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:42.316]  Yeah.
[01:10:02.753 --> 01:10:08.196]  Sit in silence, not typically an extroverted personality type, and they target those women.
[01:10:08.456 --> 01:10:12.618]  But now we're seeing where we have women coming forward with stories that seem very credible.
[01:10:12.718 --> 01:10:19.442]  I think that this story with Al Franken and this woman Leanne, it seems credible, it seems realistic like it could happen.
[01:10:20.572 --> 01:10:21.073]  Exactly.
[01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:22.274]  From the USO Tour.
[01:10:22.294 --> 01:10:33.586]  And let's be clear, there are villains, there are neutral folks, there are great people, there are heroes, male, female, old, young, gay, straight, Christian, agnostic, there are good people in every group, there are bad groups.
[01:10:34.392 --> 01:10:35.313]  There are bad people in every group.
[01:10:35.473 --> 01:10:39.856]  The big issue here is, we've got people making fake claims.
[01:10:40.117 --> 01:10:41.398]  We've got people making real claims.
[01:10:41.698 --> 01:10:49.764]  But the point is, with all this stuff coming out, people are finding the courage, so a lot of the claims are true, a lot of the claims are real, and people feel like it's safe now.
[01:10:50.105 --> 01:10:56.090]  And most of the people that have been accused, the Weinsteins, the Frankens, the Kevin Spaceys, have had to admit it was true.
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:03.816]  They're having to backpedal because they don't want to be in the news anymore before more people come out, and they've been using Judge Roy Moore
[01:11:04.256 --> 01:11:10.301]  The last week as the total distraction from all the new revelations daily on people like them.
[01:11:10.421 --> 01:11:12.603]  So now the Franken thing comes out.
[01:11:12.823 --> 01:11:19.868]  All I'm saying is we've got him grabbing her breast in a photo he released himself through the USO.
[01:11:19.928 --> 01:11:20.449]  What does that mean?
[01:11:20.749 --> 01:11:22.970]  It totally corroborates her story.
[01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:30.913]  She is telling, from my opinion, I think that she's telling the truth from the stories and the experience I have with women and these... Well, plus the photo.
[01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.873]  The photo, the photo evidence right there.
[01:11:32.953 --> 01:11:34.334]  Franken released this!
[01:11:34.494 --> 01:11:38.235]  He was doing stuff that he knew he shouldn't be doing and it was boisterous.
[01:11:38.536 --> 01:11:42.217]  He even took a photo to show in your face, ha ha, I can do
[01:11:42.857 --> 01:11:47.039]  Well, I'm calling for him to resign because they want all these other people to resign off accusations without proof.
[01:11:59.525 --> 01:12:00.846]  And I say they should be investigated.
[01:12:01.107 --> 01:12:04.030]  We have him grabbing her in an official U.S.
[01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:09.635]  government photo that he controlled that he had released for snapshots for the memory of the tour that he controlled.
[01:12:09.675 --> 01:12:12.078]  He picked this photo to give the members of the tour.
[01:12:12.398 --> 01:12:13.119]  He was running.
[01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:14.200]  He's proud of this.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.321]  He wanted to humiliate her.
[01:12:15.641 --> 01:12:17.563]  He wanted to let her know he had a photo of this.
[01:12:17.903 --> 01:12:19.024]  He thought he'd get away with it.
[01:12:19.065 --> 01:12:20.346]  Classic Weinstein stuff.
[01:12:20.606 --> 01:12:22.428]  So do you agree with me that he should step down?
[01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:36.077]  I agree that he should step down and I think that law enforcement should actually investigate this situation here because you actually have a photo of him touching her, groping her in a place she wouldn't feel comfortable while she is unconscious, while she's not in a conscious state.
[01:12:36.117 --> 01:12:36.697]  Which is what?
[01:12:36.898 --> 01:12:41.080]  I'm not saying he's literally a vampire, but I liken him to psychic vampires, humiliating her.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.343]  He humiliated her reportedly on the whole trip, after she wouldn't have sex with him, after she pushed him off.
[01:12:46.044 --> 01:12:48.585]  Oh, but Fox News even said, well, she finally gave in.
[01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:52.568]  In her testimony, she says she fought him, she pushed him off, she didn't give in.
[01:12:53.329 --> 01:12:55.370]  Exactly, and now she is coming forward.
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:56.571]  That's the important part.
[01:12:56.931 --> 01:13:02.696]  And we also have to notice, though, that we do have women coming forward that their stories don't seem very credible.
[01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:06.439]  We've seen attacks against President Trump, and we do know that... Well, all those got thrown out.
[01:13:06.819 --> 01:13:13.284]  Exactly, they got thrown out, and we can't just believe 100% something in all of these cases.
[01:13:13.464 --> 01:13:15.386]  But she's got the photo from him!
[01:13:15.706 --> 01:13:16.187]  Exactly.
[01:13:16.207 --> 01:13:18.049]  I mean, boom, slam dunk!
[01:13:18.309 --> 01:13:30.523]  This case, she has the photo, she's got the proof, and this guy should 100% step down, and the liberals really need to come out and speak out against him if they want to claim that they are, you know, triumphing for
[01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:31.504]  That was my next question.
[01:13:32.084 --> 01:13:36.307]  Right before the Moore stuff broke last week, they were finally going, OK, Bill Clinton's timing the barrels here.
[01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:38.208]  OK, Hillary's got to go away.
[01:13:38.509 --> 01:13:39.569]  He's got to get in trouble.
[01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:40.590]  OK, Weinstein's horrible.
[01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:41.571]  OK, Kevin Spacey.
[01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:42.952]  OK, we do have a problem.
[01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:46.074]  But then they jumped on Moore like, oh, see, it's all you to change the subject.
[01:13:46.494 --> 01:13:47.214]  Change the subject.
[01:13:47.234 --> 01:13:49.996]  Conservatives and Libertarians will burn more in two seconds if it's true.
[01:13:50.356 --> 01:13:53.197]  We'll throw it... Who do you know there's a bunch of perverts in the Republican Party?
[01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:55.318]  We've been going after these people forever.
[01:13:55.358 --> 01:13:56.639]  We want to bring them all down.
[01:13:57.059 --> 01:14:04.282]  So don't think you just have some moral equivalence because Roy Moore is over here doing some creepy stuff when we've got you red-handed.
[01:14:04.642 --> 01:14:05.043]  Exactly.
[01:14:05.103 --> 01:14:06.284]  We've got them red-handed.
[01:14:06.324 --> 01:14:18.998]  And if Roy Moore or any of these guys want to come out and contest the allegations, I would say and encourage them to come out and sue for slander, sue for defamation.
[01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:20.199]  Well, he says he's doing that.
[01:14:20.319 --> 01:14:21.540]  Al Franken released the photo!
[01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:39.679]  They've got photo evidence.
[01:14:39.979 --> 01:14:41.720]  It needs to be handed over to law enforcement.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.841]  He should be prosecuted.
[01:14:43.861 --> 01:14:52.806]  Listen, if my wife or one of my daughters, if some pervert grabbed their breast on a plane and took photos, that violates all sorts of lies.
[01:14:53.347 --> 01:14:56.028]  I mean, that's violating people's lives in so many ways.
[01:14:56.048 --> 01:15:00.831]  I mean, when you violate somebody's life, their privacy, like that,
[01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:03.211]  What do you call that legally?
[01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:04.372]  I mean, it's groping.
[01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:05.692]  It's a form of assault.
[01:15:05.772 --> 01:15:06.552]  It's humiliation.
[01:15:06.592 --> 01:15:07.712]  It's like revenge porn.
[01:15:07.732 --> 01:15:11.693]  I mean, what is it when you're on an airplane and somebody grabs your breast and takes a photo?
[01:15:11.713 --> 01:15:12.093]  What is that?
[01:15:12.113 --> 01:15:14.334]  I mean, if somebody grabs me... It's degrading.
[01:15:14.414 --> 01:15:15.494]  It's disrespectful.
[01:15:15.574 --> 01:15:16.614]  It's humiliating.
[01:15:16.694 --> 01:15:21.775]  It's meant to humiliate her and silence her and put her in a sense of low self-worth.
[01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:23.436]  And where's Gloria Allred on this one?
[01:15:23.676 --> 01:15:24.556]  You know, she'll pick up
[01:15:24.836 --> 01:15:36.207]  Gloria Allred will pick up cases for women that don't even have picture evidence, that don't even have much of a leg to stand on as far as proof or witnesses that can, you know, corroborate her story.
[01:15:36.547 --> 01:15:38.188]  But where's Gloria Allred on this one?
[01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:39.850]  Is it because he's a Democrat?
[01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.491]  Why doesn't she ever go after Democrats?
[01:15:41.511 --> 01:15:43.033]  Because there's plenty of women that have been assaulted by him.
[01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:45.454]  Stay there, Millie Weaver, to get your view on this.
[01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:52.777]  Roger Stone, on the other side, he told me about the Sal Franken thing before it even broke, and now it's coming out.
[01:15:52.938 --> 01:15:54.318]  More accusers are coming.
[01:15:54.698 --> 01:15:56.179]  Where is this gonna go next?
[01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.320]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:06.224]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses
[01:16:07.774 --> 01:16:13.417]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[01:16:14.117 --> 01:16:15.918]  They fear families living together.
[01:16:15.958 --> 01:16:18.879]  They fear people loving God.
[01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:23.622]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[01:16:24.922 --> 01:16:32.146]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[01:16:34.147 --> 01:16:40.572]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[01:16:42.133 --> 01:16:48.258]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[01:16:49.139 --> 01:17:02.249]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[01:17:03.248 --> 01:17:09.832]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[01:17:11.113 --> 01:17:18.878]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[01:17:20.599 --> 01:17:21.800]  And so many things will happen.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:23.981]  We are the majority.
[01:17:24.892 --> 01:17:33.643]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:39.811]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.701]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:52.746]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[01:17:53.427 --> 01:17:59.790]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:02.552]  So many people write me.
[01:18:03.359 --> 01:18:11.630]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:13.993]  We have to fly our flag.
[01:18:14.963 --> 01:18:16.423]  We have to wear our colors.
[01:18:16.704 --> 01:18:21.365]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:22.025 --> 01:18:24.886]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[01:18:25.086 --> 01:18:36.349]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:38.590]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rake shirt.
[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.351]  And the lock her up Hillary for prison shirt.
[01:18:41.691 --> 01:18:44.032]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[01:18:44.452 --> 01:18:51.095]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:56.258]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[01:18:57.138 --> 01:19:04.122]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[01:19:04.462 --> 01:19:07.443]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[01:19:07.803 --> 01:19:24.812]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[01:19:25.572 --> 01:19:34.339]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.663]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWarm.
[01:19:39.704 --> 01:19:51.573]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[01:19:51.893 --> 01:19:52.374]  So please,
[01:19:52.814 --> 01:19:58.155]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[01:19:58.535 --> 01:20:00.076]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:08.078]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:24.504]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:25.124 --> 01:20:27.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:36.568]  So, Senator Bob Menendez reportedly laundered all this money and did all this stuff to pay for all these underage women.
[01:20:37.908 --> 01:20:41.070]  And the underage women stuff's not really even been denied.
[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:45.591]  And I think it's creepy, even though they're 16, 17 years old.
[01:20:45.611 --> 01:20:47.492]  It's not really pedophilia, but it's creepville.
[01:20:48.146 --> 01:20:48.446]  Okay.
[01:20:49.007 --> 01:20:50.288]  But he just had a mistrial.
[01:20:51.789 --> 01:20:55.331]  So, uh, that was just announced, uh, minutes ago.
[01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:59.314]  A really nasty globalist, Senator Bob Menendez.
[01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:10.083]  And I mentioned that Stone told me a day and a half ago that get ready Al Franken's neck, sticking his tongue down women's throats, groping them.
[01:21:10.423 --> 01:21:11.584]  And then I just left it alone.
[01:21:12.124 --> 01:21:14.546]  And then I didn't know, I guess he told Dew last night before it broke.
[01:21:14.566 --> 01:21:15.887]  So there's a record that we broke it.
[01:21:17.116 --> 01:21:25.240]  I mean, I didn't even know that this stuff, because I just kind of like, I've taken on so many fights, so I'm like, I don't know if I want to break that he did this, and I'm going to wait till the woman goes public.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.521]  And Stone wasn't even trying to get me to go public.
[01:21:28.561 --> 01:21:32.163]  I just learn all this stuff and have to sit on it because it's just, it's constant.
[01:21:32.203 --> 01:21:34.484]  I mean, we even know basically what happened exactly in Vegas.
[01:21:34.824 --> 01:21:36.264]  By the way, it was the Islamist's folks.
[01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:43.648]  I mean, they've got the FBI grabbing our sources out of their houses and stuff and then releasing them later.
[01:21:46.084 --> 01:21:51.368]  I don't know why they don't want this info out about who really did it in Vegas, because it only proves Trump's right.
[01:21:51.808 --> 01:21:54.130]  Just like the Islamic attack a week and a half ago in D.C.
[01:21:55.051 --> 01:21:55.591]  or in New York.
[01:21:56.091 --> 01:21:59.374]  InfoWars called it, correctly predicts Al Franken's sex scandal.
[01:21:59.774 --> 01:22:01.876]  Senator Al Franken's time in the barrel is about to come.
[01:22:02.176 --> 01:22:03.297]  This is last night.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:13.325]  Well, the specifics from Roger Stone were groping and grabbing a woman, sticking his tongue down her throat, and expanding, saying, more coming.
[01:22:13.705 --> 01:22:24.831]  Well, you've certainly got sources, so let's talk about, without getting into how you learned this first, what the next shoe to drop is, because you told me again a day and a half ago, and again last night, more is coming after this.
[01:22:25.611 --> 01:22:27.072]  What should we expect with Al Franken?
[01:22:28.393 --> 01:22:31.617]  Well, Alex, ironically, I know Al Franken.
[01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:46.293]  Al Franken and I were on the TV show Politically Incorrect together with Bill Maher, who, while I disagree with him on many things, I certainly agree with him on the question of Islamic terrorism and marijuana.
[01:22:47.282 --> 01:22:50.165]  Uh, and I never thought Franklin was funny, to be honest.
[01:22:50.205 --> 01:22:56.130]  I understand why he went into politics, because as a comedian, let's face it, not funny.
[01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:58.272]  This guy is no Aykroyd, you know?
[01:22:58.553 --> 01:22:58.793]  Yes.
[01:22:59.013 --> 01:23:04.018]  So, uh, and he's a condescending, snotty liberal on top of it all, but
[01:23:04.619 --> 01:23:11.870]  My sources point out that this woman anchor is very much admired and respected.
[01:23:12.471 --> 01:23:13.954]  She's got a great reputation.
[01:23:14.014 --> 01:23:17.199]  She is well liked within the Fox family.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.541]  And she's got a photo!
[01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:21.421]  Yes.
[01:23:21.922 --> 01:23:27.827]  Ironically, I understand she is giving her first interview to Jake Tapper.
[01:23:27.947 --> 01:23:31.790]  So it's going to be interesting to see how Jake handles this.
[01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:35.212]  Why is she doing that if she's on Fox Radio?
[01:23:35.252 --> 01:23:36.093]  That's not a good move.
[01:23:36.894 --> 01:23:42.718]  Well, evidently, she has some prior relationship with Tapper, they're friends, and she trusts him.
[01:23:42.759 --> 01:23:45.721]  Look, I think it's brave of her just to come out.
[01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:49.264]  This is mortifying to have a picture of a U.S.
[01:23:49.304 --> 01:23:50.525]  Senator grabbing your
[01:23:51.511 --> 01:23:56.833]  You know, your chest on the Internet.
[01:23:57.173 --> 01:23:59.773]  It shows the hypocrisy of the left.
[01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:07.896]  In other words, Franken had to go down the line with the radical feminist agenda to get elected to the Senate.
[01:24:07.956 --> 01:24:11.216]  It's ironic that his win has always been disputed.
[01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:16.338]  Many believe that his seat was stolen for him through
[01:24:16.998 --> 01:24:20.522]  I mean, I really think Alex, the next big bombshell in all honesty, is in the Golden State.
[01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:38.498]  We're good to go.
[01:24:54.768 --> 01:25:10.235]  Meanwhile, Adam Schiff is trying to submarine de León, so he's the guy feeding this all to the press, because he wanted to run for Feinstein's seat, only to be rebuffed when she decided to seek another term.
[01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:14.697]  So, it's fattricide within the Democratic Party.
[01:25:14.757 --> 01:25:16.397]  Sure, their infighting's bringing them down.
[01:25:16.718 --> 01:25:18.258]  A week ago they were saying, get rid of Bill.
[01:25:18.298 --> 01:25:20.359]  California is infinite, from what I'm told.
[01:25:20.499 --> 01:25:21.299]  Just enormous.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.180]  Numerous.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.242]  So you're saying bigger than Hollywood is what you told me the other day on the phone.
[01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:27.744]  Bigger than Hollywood is obviously California.
[01:25:28.045 --> 01:25:32.809]  The entire situation is going to be gigantic.
[01:25:34.073 --> 01:25:36.315]  That's what my sources tell me.
[01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:48.182]  And of course it all boils down again to these are the people who pursue a radical feminist agenda and hold themselves out on these issues.
[01:25:48.222 --> 01:26:00.009]  Do you notice that these men that are championing feminism tend to be the ones who are also engaging in this disrespectful and assault on women?
[01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:01.469]  Millie Weaver, that's a great question.
[01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:03.050]  Millie Weaver, our reporter riding shotgun with us.
[01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:14.793]  Roger Stone, it's way disproportionate, super leftist, anti-family liberals are admitting raping men, women, underage girls, hundreds and hundreds, in some cases, per person.
[01:26:15.053 --> 01:26:16.573]  These sound like maniacs.
[01:26:16.613 --> 01:26:19.594]  I mean, what, do you just run around all day like a maniac, grabbing everybody?
[01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:22.612]  Well, it's interesting, though, that it's coming to light.
[01:26:22.632 --> 01:26:27.656]  I mean, for how long did the mainstream media cover up for Bill Clinton's atrocious behavior?
[01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:33.161]  Not only grabbing women, biting through their upper lips, demanding oral sex.
[01:26:33.181 --> 01:26:35.603]  So there was incredible entitlement.
[01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:37.564]  So we've only got the tip of the iceberg.
[01:26:37.845 --> 01:26:40.006]  How big is the burg under the waves?
[01:26:41.668 --> 01:26:43.810]  It's just impossible to say.
[01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:47.633]  But look, I think we have to be somewhat judicious here.
[01:26:48.546 --> 01:26:57.433]  This is a question of a woman who's happy to let you know her name, who's got a long record of credibility as a person, and she has photos.
[01:26:58.054 --> 01:27:00.756]  Anybody can charge anybody with anything else.
[01:27:01.476 --> 01:27:07.141]  Roy Moore, he doesn't have a judgment against him, no court has found him guilty, he is accused.
[01:27:07.721 --> 01:27:11.944]  Voters have to look at the accuser and what they say and make their own decision.
[01:27:11.964 --> 01:27:13.965]  And by the way, voters of the poll show aren't buying it.
[01:27:14.005 --> 01:27:15.626]  It shows how anti-establishment folks are.
[01:27:16.146 --> 01:27:23.551]  I think Moore's admission of courting 17-year-old girls is creepy, but it's nothing compared to Weinstein and others.
[01:27:23.831 --> 01:27:25.973]  But what does it say that voters don't care?
[01:27:26.333 --> 01:27:28.954]  All the polls show they're doubling down.
[01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:32.877]  That shows the establishment literally is just hated.
[01:27:33.723 --> 01:27:51.218]  And you know we live in a system where you are innocent until proven guilty and a lot of times the problem with this movement of all these women coming forward is we're starting to just believe every single one of them when the reality is is that oftentimes men are falsely accused of rape or sexually assault and then they become vindicated.
[01:27:51.459 --> 01:27:54.361]  So we need to make sure that we're looking at are these women credible?
[01:27:54.421 --> 01:27:55.742]  Do they have any type of evidence?
[01:27:55.963 --> 01:28:00.006]  We're seeing the evidence here with this situation here with Al Franken.
[01:28:01.047 --> 01:28:10.034]  As far as with Roy Moore, we don't see that same amount of evidence and that's why we should be questioning, we should be interrogating.
[01:28:10.054 --> 01:28:10.854]  Alright, that sets the table.
[01:28:10.874 --> 01:28:12.235]  Let me come back, I want to ask a few questions.
[01:28:12.315 --> 01:28:13.576]  Why aren't we seeing the same evidence?
[01:28:14.677 --> 01:28:15.077]  A. B.
[01:28:16.752 --> 01:28:21.718]  Clearly Moore thinks what he has done is normal under some Christian construct, so okay.
[01:28:22.599 --> 01:28:24.581]  But B, how do the Democrats survive this?
[01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:34.332]  But more importantly, C, what do we do if the Democrats are saying Roy Moore stepped down, Republicans are saying it, but then all these other big Democrats and people are involved in far worse?
[01:28:34.572 --> 01:28:37.356]  Let's ask Roger Stone that question straight ahead, because...
[01:28:37.816 --> 01:28:47.866]  There are a lot of other big issues, like the Black Plague getting loose, that's now drug-resistant, and all these other big global issues in North Korea, and the economy, and great things going on.
[01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:51.429]  Ivanka Trump scores win with Senate plan to double child tax credit.
[01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:59.316]  I mean, there's a lot of crazy good stuff to cover, too, but right now is this big coming out of victims, and I think most of them are actually legitimate.
[01:28:59.336 --> 01:29:01.699]  They've been in the shadows until now.
[01:29:02.532 --> 01:29:04.713]  We confirm suspicions, Ed Veritas.
[01:29:04.753 --> 01:29:10.957]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:29:11.377 --> 01:29:14.079]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:29:14.299 --> 01:29:18.582]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:29:19.002 --> 01:29:39.273]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYCTerroristAttack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[01:29:40.134 --> 01:29:42.677]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[01:29:42.737 --> 01:29:44.440]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:54.492]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:29:54.832 --> 01:29:58.777]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[01:30:00.225 --> 01:30:02.106]  This information being weaponized.
[01:30:02.187 --> 01:30:04.428]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:30:04.849 --> 01:30:09.392]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[01:30:09.912 --> 01:30:11.233]  I will not let you down.
[01:30:11.393 --> 01:30:14.296]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:30:14.716 --> 01:30:16.337]  How quickly can you act?
[01:30:16.637 --> 01:30:22.242]  And what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[01:30:23.562 --> 01:30:30.931]  Know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[01:30:31.372 --> 01:30:37.619]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.123]  You have RT, you have Sputnik.
[01:30:40.763 --> 01:30:47.345]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[01:30:48.465 --> 01:30:50.986]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:52.446]  The system self-corrected.
[01:30:52.566 --> 01:30:55.387]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[01:30:55.407 --> 01:30:57.648]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[01:30:58.848 --> 01:30:59.648]  But you saw this?
[01:30:59.848 --> 01:31:00.609]  USA Today.
[01:31:01.009 --> 01:31:02.089]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[01:31:02.269 --> 01:31:04.610]  And I also saw the system corrected.
[01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:05.810]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:07.610]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:09.471]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[01:31:09.491 --> 01:31:17.112]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[01:31:17.132 --> 01:31:22.573]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[01:31:25.734 --> 01:31:29.694]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:31:30.775 --> 01:31:31.955]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:31:33.206 --> 01:31:35.987]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:48.933]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[01:31:50.948 --> 01:31:55.049]  Super Blue Colloidal Silver Fluoride Free Mouthwash, 50% off.
[01:31:55.089 --> 01:31:56.810]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, still 50% off.
[01:31:57.130 --> 01:31:59.951]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[01:31:59.971 --> 01:32:02.071]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:04.092]  That's 50% off as well.
[01:32:04.312 --> 01:32:05.832]  Free shipping, it's got to end.
[01:32:06.212 --> 01:32:09.673]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[01:32:09.953 --> 01:32:11.674]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.
[01:32:11.734 --> 01:32:15.255]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our best seller, that I personally wear
[01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:16.456]  We're good to go.
[01:32:42.072 --> 01:32:44.273]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.136 --> 01:33:28.278]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:29.039 --> 01:33:30.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.324 --> 01:33:49.130]  Again, the big 64 trillion dollar question here is, why is all of the sexual abuse, the pedophilia, the Satanism, the occultism, why is it all coming out right now?
[01:33:49.951 --> 01:33:53.613]  And we know the answer, but I'm gonna get both your takes and your angles on it if you disagree.
[01:33:55.427 --> 01:33:57.769]  Both Millie Weaver and, of course, Roger Stone.
[01:33:59.611 --> 01:34:01.973]  It's because the establishment's in trouble.
[01:34:02.013 --> 01:34:02.974]  Hollywood's falling apart.
[01:34:03.214 --> 01:34:07.177]  The Democrats that kind of ran this whole thing, they're losing their power.
[01:34:07.918 --> 01:34:15.945]  And now people see resistance against power structures, the UN, the EU, globalism, Hollywood, the Democratic Party.
[01:34:17.608 --> 01:34:18.789]  So they have the courage to come out.
[01:34:18.869 --> 01:34:25.934]  That's why most of these accusations have turned out to be true, especially against Weinstein and Spacey and all these Democrat producers.
[01:34:26.554 --> 01:34:35.861]  But you're going to have the Democrats try to jump on this wave and have their operatives accuse people, and so then how do we forensically look at the claims?
[01:34:35.901 --> 01:34:39.864]  Well, if they're Democratic Party operatives, or if they end up not showing the proof,
[01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:46.401]  To get a big crest going, a big wave going, then you know that wave's fake or it's got to be suspect.
[01:34:46.441 --> 01:34:49.603]  But when it's somebody like Franklin saying, OK, I'm sorry.
[01:34:50.603 --> 01:34:54.406]  Well, you know, that's just him trying to get out of the news.
[01:34:55.126 --> 01:34:57.367]  But I'm wondering what the next wave is.
[01:34:57.387 --> 01:35:07.553]  You just heard it's going to be California, not just Los Angeles, not just Hollywood, but California and this elitist establishment that believes it can do anything and everything.
[01:35:08.534 --> 01:35:10.655]  But separately, I think Trump played this perfectly.
[01:35:12.315 --> 01:35:15.097]  Well, Alex, look, I find it stunning that we just learned that Harvey Weinstein uses the same
[01:35:39.305 --> 01:35:44.510]  And by the way, he's finally gotten in trouble for a bunch of other stuff.
[01:36:06.445 --> 01:36:15.892]  You know, her windshield broke in, he's the guy who runs up to her, jogs up to her all dressed in black and says, essentially, if you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut.
[01:36:16.272 --> 01:36:20.755]  Now, epically, working for Weinstein, doing the same thing, suppressing these women.
[01:36:21.155 --> 01:36:22.756]  This is the party of feminists.
[01:36:23.317 --> 01:36:23.817]  Ridiculous.
[01:36:23.837 --> 01:36:26.159]  By the way, it even came out in the New York Times, they had to admit that
[01:36:27.583 --> 01:36:37.188]  Weinstein was using a team of, quote, former, which never happens, Mossad operatives, who are part of the leftist group in Israel that's trying to put Netanyahu in prison.
[01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.009]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:36:38.729 --> 01:36:40.390]  People always think Israel's one monolithic deal.
[01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:42.911]  No, it's the leftists and the conservatives, as usual.
[01:36:43.132 --> 01:36:43.872]  There's different splits.
[01:36:44.152 --> 01:36:47.354]  What do you make of Weinstein using Mossad operatives against women?
[01:36:48.437 --> 01:36:59.583]  Uh, look, this guy had such trail behind him, uh, that he had to silence these various starlets and other, uh, you know, uh, attractive, uh, women that he had, uh, come onto.
[01:37:00.104 --> 01:37:07.007]  Uh, and he just, he became so wealthy and so powerful, they begin to believe that they can suppress all of it.
[01:37:07.067 --> 01:37:09.629]  Look, I, you know, there's a real distinction here.
[01:37:10.663 --> 01:37:15.006]  Between consensual sex and assault.
[01:37:15.406 --> 01:37:22.510]  I never thought, for example, that Bill Clinton should have been impeached for whatever consensually went on with Monica Linsky.
[01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:27.333]  It might have been distasteful, but that's not against her consent.
[01:37:27.353 --> 01:37:28.093]  It's not rape.
[01:37:28.173 --> 01:37:33.276]  It's not violence against women, which we know Bill was also quite capable of.
[01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:41.593]  So, I do think you have to draw that distinction, but you have, as I point out, InfoWars broke this story.
[01:37:42.454 --> 01:37:47.117]  The reason I reached out to the night editor, Rob Duhl, was to memorialize it.
[01:37:47.277 --> 01:37:50.399]  Again, tomorrow's news today at InfoWars.
[01:37:50.679 --> 01:37:53.421]  We have our ear to the ground, very much so.
[01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:56.984]  I want to point out, you never say, hey Alex, you ought to do this, you ought to do that.
[01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:57.844]  You kind of give me hints.
[01:37:59.145 --> 01:38:01.406]  Day and a half ago, I get, you know, you text message me, call me.
[01:38:01.706 --> 01:38:02.787]  Hey, this is coming, I'm told.
[01:38:02.827 --> 01:38:03.627]  I'm like, okay, what do we do?
[01:38:03.687 --> 01:38:04.628]  Well, let's just see.
[01:38:05.068 --> 01:38:08.109]  But nine times out of ten, we wait and then we don't officially break stuff.
[01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:12.171]  I think we should just start, when you get something, we should just break it and say according to sources.
[01:38:12.231 --> 01:38:17.894]  But I'm glad that you ended up memorializing it last night, because I didn't even know you memorialized it and broken it.
[01:38:18.174 --> 01:38:20.135]  I just said, oh yeah, Stone told me a day and a half ago.
[01:38:20.175 --> 01:38:21.356]  So, I'm glad you did that.
[01:38:21.376 --> 01:38:21.936]  Good instincts.
[01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:27.539]  You know, I think if you look on my Twitter feed, it actually says InfoWars Exclusive.
[01:38:28.723 --> 01:38:31.284]  You know, Franken's time in the barrel.
[01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:33.405]  And you've been banned on your regular Roger Stone.
[01:38:33.425 --> 01:38:34.505]  You now have Stone Cold Truth.
[01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:35.705]  They haven't banned that yet.
[01:38:37.686 --> 01:38:39.086]  This is very interesting, Alex.
[01:38:40.127 --> 01:38:42.607]  Stone Cold Truth is not controlled by me.
[01:38:42.648 --> 01:38:45.788]  They are people who are Roger Stone and InfoWars fans.
[01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:47.289]  They put up what they choose.
[01:38:47.329 --> 01:38:48.629]  They sell my books and so on.
[01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:53.331]  Somebody had a parody site clearly marked as Roger Stone GOP.
[01:38:54.071 --> 01:38:55.752]  They operated it for two years.
[01:38:56.052 --> 01:38:59.014]  They rarely tweeted.
[01:38:59.774 --> 01:39:02.036]  They have violated no guidelines.
[01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:09.780]  I don't know, I don't even, I have no idea who controls this until the fellow who owns it told me he was banned recently.
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.981]  So, look, they're spoiling for a fight.
[01:39:13.141 --> 01:39:20.265]  I will be flying to San Francisco in the near future to file a devastating lawsuit against Twitter.
[01:39:20.685 --> 01:39:23.506]  I had a terrific conversation with Milo yesterday.
[01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:30.229]  He is going to be aiding the suit, probably as either a plaintiff or through an amicus brief.
[01:39:31.389 --> 01:39:32.890]  There are numerous others.
[01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:34.891]  Mark Dice, Joe Biggs.
[01:39:35.631 --> 01:39:38.612]  These guys have legitimate grudges just like mine.
[01:39:39.333 --> 01:39:41.914]  Perhaps they aren't banned for life as I am.
[01:39:42.054 --> 01:39:45.515]  But look, they're wrong on constitutional grounds.
[01:39:45.535 --> 01:39:46.916]  There's First Amendment issues.
[01:39:46.956 --> 01:39:49.757]  There are service contract issues.
[01:39:50.137 --> 01:40:05.536]  The point is they're massively discriminating us, and again, Al Franken on Monday testified he wants, quote, conservative sites implicated as Russian, with no proof, that's you, Drudge, and myself, to be banned completely from social media, period, an internet ban.
[01:40:05.816 --> 01:40:07.078]  He called for that on Monday.
[01:40:07.952 --> 01:40:09.193]  Yeah, it's fascism.
[01:40:09.313 --> 01:40:11.133]  That's fascism, is what that is.
[01:40:11.734 --> 01:40:14.235]  And it's red-baiting.
[01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:17.376]  And it's been proven to be a fraud, and they're the ones that have been caught doing it.
[01:40:17.396 --> 01:40:18.637]  Let me ask Millie Weaver this question.
[01:40:19.277 --> 01:40:25.400]  This firestorm of sexual abuse and domination by the Democrats is only getting bigger.
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:29.342]  You heard Roger, he said California's about to be engulfed.
[01:40:29.362 --> 01:40:29.822]  What's next?
[01:40:30.882 --> 01:40:43.492]  Well, first I want to point out the irony here that Al Franken was calling for conservative speakers to be considered guilty before anything else without any evidence.
[01:40:43.532 --> 01:40:48.416]  Well, I wonder if he's going to ask for a proper form of justice in this case.
[01:40:49.036 --> 01:40:52.198]  Ordeal with Mrs. Leanne Tweekin.
[01:40:52.678 --> 01:40:54.899]  But here's the thing here.
[01:40:55.059 --> 01:40:56.840]  I do think that we are going to see more.
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:04.364]  We're going to continue to see more women coming out and more child stars, even men coming out having been sexually assaulted.
[01:41:04.824 --> 01:41:13.268]  But I think that we also will see more on the political sphere because I think that we're going to see more attacks on both the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:41:13.648 --> 01:41:14.869]  I feel like it would be
[01:41:15.009 --> 01:41:15.329]  Yeah.
[01:41:33.609 --> 01:41:36.331]  Exactly, and I predicted months ago they were going to build this wave.
[01:41:36.351 --> 01:41:37.812]  They were going to burn Weinstein.
[01:41:37.872 --> 01:41:39.052]  They'd covered it up for years.
[01:41:39.352 --> 01:41:45.716]  They decided we've got to burn the Democrat brand, create a new one, get rid of the Clintons, and then try to use that as legitimacy to go after Trump next.
[01:41:46.016 --> 01:42:00.405]  By the way, they're now reporting daily mail that a 16-year-old says that Sylvester Stallone raped her and then forced her to perform oral sex on he and his bodyguard, and that he'd beat her in the head if she ever told a bombshell police report.
[01:42:00.525 --> 01:42:03.187]  I mean, this is just unraveling quicker.
[01:42:03.647 --> 01:42:05.488]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:42:05.528 --> 01:42:07.749]  Hollywood is full of filth and scum.
[01:42:07.769 --> 01:42:11.150]  These type of things go on there all the time.
[01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:14.371]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:42:14.451 --> 01:42:19.913]  When people get amounts of power in their hand, people that can't handle a responsibility, they abuse it.
[01:42:20.073 --> 01:42:25.175]  And we're going to see that with powerful people, politicians, the Washington swamp.
[01:42:25.596 --> 01:42:26.276]  It's going to be there.
[01:42:26.536 --> 01:42:27.497]  Millie, we have a great job.
[01:42:27.537 --> 01:42:29.078]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us.
[01:42:29.118 --> 01:42:31.880]  Please join us again with other big breaking news.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.823]  I mean, I should ask, you got any other giant bombshells that we should hold you over for?
[01:42:35.843 --> 01:42:37.184]  Or should we just have you back tomorrow?
[01:42:38.465 --> 01:42:39.026]  Stay tuned.
[01:42:39.626 --> 01:42:39.927]  All right.
[01:42:39.967 --> 01:42:41.047]  I mean, Roger did break it.
[01:42:41.508 --> 01:42:44.610]  And I just wish, I was just like, Al Franken, I don't want to get sued.
[01:42:44.630 --> 01:42:45.431]  Let's just wait on this.
[01:42:45.791 --> 01:42:48.393]  But then I guess he went ahead and released it last night so we'd get the scoop.
[01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:49.955]  So good job, Roger.
[01:42:50.235 --> 01:42:52.537]  Oh yeah, we got so many big stories that I just like,
[01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:57.087]  I don't mind the fight, but it's just like, good lord, do we have to break everything?
[01:42:57.147 --> 01:42:58.509]  I mean, it's dangerous.
[01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.992]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:43:03.638 --> 01:43:05.040]  Welcome to the War Room.
[01:43:06.098 --> 01:43:08.639]  The latest addition to InfoWars live programming.

[01:43:37.628 --> 01:43:41.371]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[01:43:41.832 --> 01:43:44.554]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[01:43:45.054 --> 01:43:49.498]  The silent majority is no longer silent, and we control the narrative now.
[01:43:50.859 --> 01:43:54.683]  This is the War Room.
[01:43:57.665 --> 01:44:01.288]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:44:11.312 --> 01:44:12.193]  Alex, I can't believe it.
[01:44:12.213 --> 01:44:16.055]  I'm talking to you, believe it or not, from Washington, D.C., a place I never come.
[01:44:16.075 --> 01:44:17.196]  Okay.
[01:44:17.917 --> 01:44:21.219]  I'm right in the center of Mordor, where all the money is going missing.
[01:44:23.083 --> 01:44:28.206]  Well, let's talk about that, because two days before 9-11, it was reported that two plus trillion was missing.
[01:44:28.526 --> 01:44:30.167]  CBS reported it from the Pentagon.
[01:44:30.627 --> 01:44:36.990]  Then it was four plus trillion later, and then now the numbers I'm seeing all combined, we're talking about 20 plus trillion?
[01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:49.637]  What has happened, and it started in fiscal 1998, the federal government has been in very significant violation of the laws related to its finances, both constitution and financial management laws.
[01:44:50.257 --> 01:44:56.259]  And one of the symptoms of this is that every year there are significant, what's called undocumentable adjustments.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:05.283]  So it's transactions that aren't approved in appropriation, or you can't prove they're approved in appropriation, and are not transparent as they're required to be.
[01:45:06.183 --> 01:45:08.984]  And it's been going on for literally since 1998, but then in 2015,
[01:45:11.665 --> 01:45:19.092]  The Department of Defense reported 6.5 trillion undocumented adjustments, which is 10 times its budget.
[01:45:19.973 --> 01:45:22.815]  And then HUD almost, I think, $300 billion.
[01:45:23.276 --> 01:45:25.858]  Again, many multiples of its budget.
[01:45:25.958 --> 01:45:35.587]  And imagine if you got a report from your bank that you had $1,000 less in your bank account than you showed in your checking account register.
[01:45:36.394 --> 01:45:41.196]  And instead of figuring out what went wrong, you know, did money not get deposited?
[01:45:41.276 --> 01:45:42.316]  Is money disappearing?
[01:45:42.696 --> 01:45:47.197]  You just wrote an item that said undocumentable adjustment and now they balanced.
[01:45:47.898 --> 01:45:54.780]  So the way the government has balanced the books at the end of every year is to just write these undocumented adjustments, which I would say is illegal.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:46:04.864]  You can't be spending money that you can't document is in compliance, you know, has been approved by Congress, is appropriated under the variety of mechanisms.
[01:46:04.904 --> 01:46:10.987]  So if you finance criminals doing criminal things that are killing you, you've got to cut off their money.
[01:46:11.247 --> 01:46:15.889]  And that's why I keep talking about enforcing the Constitution and holding the government accountable.
[01:46:15.929 --> 01:46:20.271]  Because if you shut off that secret money, you know, that's being taken illegally,
[01:46:21.271 --> 01:46:36.944]  You have a way of turning this around because you have one group of players who are operating outside the law, financed with our money, and whether it's the breakaways or the money rolling into Silicon Valley, you've got to address that, which is why I keep coming back to enforce the Constitution.
[01:46:37.464 --> 01:46:37.564]  Sure.
[01:46:37.604 --> 01:46:37.764]  Sure.
[01:47:05.831 --> 01:47:20.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.144 --> 01:47:30.308]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.977 --> 01:47:57.963]  All right, I've just spent over two and a half hours getting into the giant firestorm that is all the unwanted sexual advances and then harassment and then assaults and then rapes and then tortures and then abuse and then spies and Mossad and CIA and private investigators harassing people and
[01:47:58.383 --> 01:48:07.648]  Women and men being disappeared, and then pedophilia, and then occultism, and then devil worship, and then child sacrifice.
[01:48:07.748 --> 01:48:10.209]  I mean, that's where this thing goes.
[01:48:12.110 --> 01:48:14.892]  I don't want to sound like I didn't want to report on Al Franken.
[01:48:16.192 --> 01:48:21.315]  Fifteen years ago, we'd be about to break some big story, and I'd be like, oh wait, we're gonna have a big story, we're gonna be big.
[01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:24.617]  I don't take stuff for granted anymore, but it's more like being punched in the face.
[01:48:26.161 --> 01:48:28.463]  Like, oh, another globalist got caught being a pedophile.
[01:48:28.563 --> 01:48:29.463]  God, it's so real.
[01:48:29.623 --> 01:48:30.404]  No, no.
[01:48:30.824 --> 01:48:34.726]  It's not like, you know, we're winning, but it's more like something we're doing as a job.
[01:48:36.047 --> 01:48:39.830]  And, you know, Stone's like, well, I have this intel, and this woman, and sure she is.
[01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:40.470]  It's going out.
[01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:42.692]  And, you know, should we work on getting her on?
[01:48:42.712 --> 01:48:45.834]  Or should we put it out first?
[01:48:45.914 --> 01:48:47.495]  Or, you know, what do you think?
[01:48:47.515 --> 01:48:49.096]  And I'm just like, I don't know, man.
[01:48:50.056 --> 01:48:50.617]  What do you think?
[01:48:51.477 --> 01:48:52.017]  And he's like, I don't know.
[01:48:52.037 --> 01:48:52.478]  What do you think?
[01:48:53.772 --> 01:48:55.453]  So, you know, we don't just jump on things.
[01:48:55.613 --> 01:48:57.034]  And it's like, well, very credible.
[01:48:57.214 --> 01:48:58.454]  More women are about to come out.
[01:49:00.335 --> 01:49:01.596]  And I'm like, let's talk about it tomorrow.
[01:49:02.977 --> 01:49:04.417]  I get a text about 9 at night.
[01:49:05.158 --> 01:49:06.619]  He's like, hey, this is big.
[01:49:07.439 --> 01:49:08.499]  It's coming out tomorrow.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.920]  I didn't respond to him.
[01:49:11.241 --> 01:49:12.642]  He did the right thing.
[01:49:12.702 --> 01:49:13.402]  Called Rob Dugas.
[01:49:13.422 --> 01:49:13.902]  Let's tweet it.
[01:49:13.922 --> 01:49:14.863]  Let's take the credit.
[01:49:15.903 --> 01:49:18.665]  And again, we have to do that because they keep saying we're the fake news.
[01:49:20.714 --> 01:49:24.296]  Let me tell you something, I'm trying to drink a fire hose of information here.
[01:49:24.376 --> 01:49:26.757]  I mean, I can't even handle it anymore.
[01:49:26.777 --> 01:49:28.358]  It's like riding a tiger.
[01:49:30.159 --> 01:49:31.880]  And it's like having a tiger by the tail, folks.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:35.162]  You think you got that tiger under control, it will tear you up.
[01:49:36.482 --> 01:49:40.644]  That's why I don't get these people that have power, who think they're invincible and get on power trips.
[01:49:41.205 --> 01:49:43.326]  Because let me tell you something, you got real power,
[01:49:44.895 --> 01:49:49.297]  You start walking out on the edge of a cliff and the more power you get, the further out on a cliff you are.
[01:49:49.897 --> 01:49:52.498]  And you're like, man, I don't, and pretty soon it's a tightrope.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:57.081]  And you're like, this is dangerous.
[01:49:58.121 --> 01:49:59.382]  Then you say, should I be doing this?
[01:49:59.402 --> 01:50:00.462]  You go, yeah, it's for my children.
[01:50:01.222 --> 01:50:02.063]  I committed to do this.
[01:50:02.083 --> 01:50:03.043]  We're changing the world.
[01:50:04.604 --> 01:50:08.946]  Then I see all these other fools who don't even have that much power who are delusional.
[01:50:10.914 --> 01:50:17.406]  And they get crazier and crazier and crazier the more power they get and it's the old megalomania thing and it scares you.
[01:50:20.592 --> 01:50:23.617]  They scare you and then you go, we gotta get control.
[01:50:25.367 --> 01:50:26.628]  To protect ourselves from them.
[01:50:26.668 --> 01:50:31.930]  But we don't want some authoritarian system, because even if we're good, we'll die, we'll get killed, we'll get corrupt.
[01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:34.271]  And then there's these levers that are centralized.
[01:50:34.612 --> 01:50:37.553]  We've got to create decentralized levers that really empower the people.
[01:50:37.573 --> 01:50:38.534]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:50:39.294 --> 01:50:40.174]  So that we have a future.
[01:50:40.194 --> 01:50:41.335]  And that's what the founders built.
[01:50:41.615 --> 01:50:42.996]  And that's why we've been so successful.
[01:50:43.116 --> 01:50:44.657]  Because it ties down power.
[01:50:45.357 --> 01:50:46.558]  It's got checks and balances.
[01:50:49.119 --> 01:50:50.960]  And yeah, a lot of it is a police state.
[01:50:52.521 --> 01:51:01.985]  And you grow up and you understand that police state and raw power is bad, then you realize, oh wait, this lesser system of control is tying down the big monster!
[01:51:04.006 --> 01:51:05.747]  Then you go, oh, why didn't I see it?
[01:51:05.787 --> 01:51:10.609]  Well, because you didn't know it all when you were 30 years old, bro, and you still don't know it all.
[01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:15.832]  But that's why statesmen and people all over the world marvel at our system.
[01:51:17.818 --> 01:51:21.963]  It's simplicity and it's complexity and how well it works when you follow it.
[01:51:22.624 --> 01:51:24.226]  Problem is, we haven't been following it for a while.
[01:51:24.286 --> 01:51:27.450]  It's like putting diesel fuel in a gasoline car, man.
[01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.012]  It ain't gonna go well.
[01:51:31.194 --> 01:51:33.737]  So, coming up...
[01:51:36.892 --> 01:51:47.517]  We've got the media defending the Clintons and claiming there's no sexual impropriety with the Clintons, there's no corruption with the uranium one, it's all made up, it's all evil, and they've got a new talking point.
[01:51:47.837 --> 01:51:49.077]  It's dictatorship!
[01:51:50.698 --> 01:51:54.019]  If you talk bad about the Clintons, you want Trump to have a dictatorship!
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.120]  You're the ones trying to overthrow Trump!
[01:51:58.221 --> 01:52:01.282]  But see, they're telling you what they really want and what they claim we're doing.
[01:52:01.603 --> 01:52:02.283]  So that's coming up.
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:11.323]  We have ended the sales on 14 different items because they sold out or almost sold out.
[01:52:11.703 --> 01:52:22.088]  Super Male Vitality, so many other products, but we're extending free shipping throughout this weekend and then it's going to end.
[01:52:22.288 --> 01:52:27.831]  And I rarely do free shipping and I appreciate your support, but we have two new probiotics and a new powerful
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:35.465]  Digestive enzyme that are the highest quality, best produced from the top labs in the country.
[01:52:36.005 --> 01:52:36.786]  Probiotics.
[01:52:38.147 --> 01:52:42.090]  We are so excited to announce these new babies.
[01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:53.438]  We've got Floralife, Advanced Restoration, 50 billion live probiotic, 20 clinical studies, promotes healthy GI tract, supports immune system, and so much more.
[01:52:53.718 --> 01:52:56.140]  The nice glass bottle, 50 billion
[01:52:58.945 --> 01:53:06.691]  This, again, other leading brands are $100, $200 for what you get with this, and on the sale right now, it is massively discounted.
[01:53:06.971 --> 01:53:12.375]  And then we've got, for on-the-go, everyday maintenance, 15 billion live robotics.
[01:53:12.915 --> 01:53:13.355]  Amazing.
[01:53:13.735 --> 01:53:17.278]  Go read about them at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:17.318 --> 01:53:21.341]  But then, the thing I am so ultra-excited about.
[01:53:23.322 --> 01:53:25.343]  Because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[01:53:25.363 --> 01:53:32.667]  But everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[01:53:34.008 --> 01:53:38.671]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:41.532]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and stomach aches.
[01:53:41.612 --> 01:53:44.014]  And as you get older, you can't eat rich foods you could eat before.
[01:53:44.334 --> 01:53:46.355]  It's because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[01:53:46.915 --> 01:53:48.876]  This is next level beyond probiotic.
[01:53:49.497 --> 01:53:50.677]  I've been taking this for two months.
[01:53:51.778 --> 01:53:55.460]  As it was getting prepared, it was getting ready, and man, I'm telling you, it is incredible.
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.101]  Normally, you eat a big steak for a day or two, you're tired.
[01:53:58.641 --> 01:54:01.802]  Doesn't happen anymore with this, and never have any issues.
[01:54:01.822 --> 01:54:06.624]  You know, I ate that 20-ounce ribeye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[01:54:07.224 --> 01:54:09.505]  I can eat it, and man, it's just totally different.
[01:54:09.525 --> 01:54:17.708]  But then, when I eat other high-protein foods, but this is good for vegan diets, people that are mainly on carbohydrates.
[01:54:17.788 --> 01:54:18.328]  It does it all.
[01:54:18.388 --> 01:54:19.489]  It's called Carnivore.
[01:54:20.714 --> 01:54:30.224]  Digestive enzymes relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion and macronutrients absorption, helps digest high-protein foods.
[01:54:30.584 --> 01:54:36.671]  People that are on these ketosis diets and Atkins type diets and paleo diets, it's just amazing.
[01:54:36.711 --> 01:54:37.532]  Made in the USA.
[01:54:39.454 --> 01:54:40.335]  Non-GMO.
[01:54:40.975 --> 01:54:41.496]  It's amazing.
[01:54:41.556 --> 01:54:46.280]  Oh, and by the way, our probiotics, a lot of probiotics don't even have the capsule that doesn't make it to the stomach.
[01:54:46.681 --> 01:54:47.041]  It's weird.
[01:54:47.341 --> 01:54:54.068]  We have the delivery system that goes through into the upper and lower intestine with our probiotics, obviously with Floralife.
[01:54:54.168 --> 01:55:00.514]  With Carnivore, it's delivered directly into the stomach.
[01:55:01.621 --> 01:55:05.485]  Where it's needed with the digestive enzymes that your body needs with the acids to do this.
[01:55:05.585 --> 01:55:06.025]  Please!
[01:55:06.506 --> 01:55:08.588]  There are hundreds of studies on this.
[01:55:08.628 --> 01:55:10.049]  We're linked to just 20 of them.
[01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:15.014]  Go to mfulwarslife.com, mfulwarsstore.com and read about this.
[01:55:15.455 --> 01:55:16.836]  Introducing Carnivore.
[01:55:18.498 --> 01:55:21.321]  The all new enzyme formula at mfulwarsstore.com.
[01:55:21.701 --> 01:55:23.303]  Free shipping and
[01:55:25.846 --> 01:55:27.387]  33% off out of the gauge.
[01:55:27.448 --> 01:55:29.350]  And again, we don't raise the price and then lower it.
[01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:30.471]  We always have a regular price.
[01:55:30.491 --> 01:55:32.013]  33% off is huge.
[01:55:33.434 --> 01:55:41.063]  I can tell you, we spend, for these probiotics and enzymes, two, three times what you see most stuff sold for in the stores.
[01:55:41.203 --> 01:55:43.066]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:55:43.086 --> 01:55:45.448]  The last stuff has like $2 a product and they're selling it for $40.
[01:55:46.414 --> 01:55:49.536]  We'll have $20 a product in it, selling it for $50.
[01:55:50.277 --> 01:55:53.159]  And there's a markup there to fund ourselves, but this is really good stuff.
[01:55:53.819 --> 01:55:58.182]  Fuel Your Body Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product from Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:58.502 --> 01:56:05.087]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:56:05.407 --> 01:56:11.511]  Digestive enzymes also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:13.212]  Yes, it rots in your gut, folks.
[01:56:13.672 --> 01:56:14.873]  Digestive enzyme production.
[01:56:16.414 --> 01:56:16.754]  I think so.
[01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:42.046]  Just one pill, every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks of your muscles.
[01:56:42.086 --> 01:56:50.612]  So instead of taking a bunch of amino acids, because you're not absorbing them, take this and it lets you get the natural ones that are the best, that are in the milk, in the eggs, in the steak, in the poultry, in the fish.
[01:56:51.638 --> 01:56:52.139]  I'm getting hungry.
[01:56:52.519 --> 01:56:57.144]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates.
[01:56:57.164 --> 01:56:59.186]  You can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:56:59.807 --> 01:57:01.729]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:57:01.809 --> 01:57:05.814]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:57:06.114 --> 01:57:07.375]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:07.636 --> 01:57:11.560]  And I'm only talking about Carnivore today because it takes too long to get into all of it.
[01:57:12.681 --> 01:57:17.223]  Carnivore helps relieve occasional bloating, gas indigestion from high-protein, high-carbohydrate diets.
[01:57:17.484 --> 01:57:21.906]  Carnivore helps digest all types of food and break them down into formable pieces your body can use.
[01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:23.166]  And so much more.
[01:57:23.186 --> 01:57:26.088]  It helps relieve uncomfortable indigestion high-protein diets can cause.
[01:57:26.108 --> 01:57:28.309]  So you can eat protein-rich foods without discomfort.
[01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:29.790]  Helps fully digest food to prevent...
[01:57:30.879 --> 01:57:32.601]  It from, again, rotting and fermenting.
[01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:38.625]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:38.665 --> 01:57:40.647]  And check out Floralife!
[01:57:41.248 --> 01:57:43.549]  Floralife, ladies and gentlemen, very affordable.
[01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:51.356]  We have the new everyday maintenance formula, and then we have, of course, Floralife, the $50 billion live probiotic advanced restoration.
[01:58:01.497 --> 01:58:05.259]  Just briefly, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:58:05.299 --> 01:58:06.159]  He's about to retire.
[01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:13.262]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:58:13.302 --> 01:58:16.283]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:58:16.303 --> 01:58:17.283]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:58:17.803 --> 01:58:18.844]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:58:19.444 --> 01:58:21.905]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply in the Florida.
[01:58:21.925 --> 01:58:22.726]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:58:23.126 --> 01:58:25.127]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:58:25.347 --> 01:58:31.049]  They're covering for it, calling it Florida under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:32.130]  Exactly.
[01:58:32.190 --> 01:58:38.173]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:58:38.233 --> 01:58:42.014]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[01:58:43.375 --> 01:58:46.897]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:58:47.995 --> 01:58:50.138]  Copped up version of fluoride.
[01:58:50.318 --> 01:58:51.340]  It's been turned into an acid.
[01:58:51.841 --> 01:58:52.622]  It's an adjuvant.
[01:58:52.662 --> 01:58:53.343]  It's very toxic.
[01:58:53.683 --> 01:59:02.255]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously.
[01:59:02.596 --> 01:59:03.697]  And for seven years the
[01:59:04.687 --> 01:59:08.249]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:59:08.690 --> 01:59:11.131]  Why does it say nursery water that at the store was added fluoride?
[01:59:11.211 --> 01:59:14.113]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:59:14.153 --> 01:59:16.134]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:27.882]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, private labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[01:59:27.902 --> 01:59:29.443]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:59:29.463 --> 01:59:31.244]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:32.205]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:59:32.225 --> 01:59:33.626]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:42.372]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:59:42.972 --> 01:59:46.335]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:59:54.561 --> 02:00:00.485]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.374 --> 02:00:14.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.423 --> 02:00:27.372]  We're back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:27.813 --> 02:00:33.138]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com are our main sites, PresentPlanet.com as well.
[02:00:34.477 --> 02:00:46.542]  We have Tommy Robinson joining us, and in fact, you guys, I had it two days ago, but we reprinted, it was a Pied Bar article that was also linked to major British news with straight faces going, we're cracking down on hate.
[02:00:47.562 --> 02:00:50.584]  Some parents don't want their children to be taken to the mosque.
[02:00:50.624 --> 02:00:53.905]  Well, we're going to make you take them to the mosque, because that's diversity.
[02:00:54.305 --> 02:00:58.067]  Now, we're not going to teach Christianity or make you go to a church, but you're going to go to a mosque.
[02:00:58.127 --> 02:01:00.548]  And I want to show the video we've got from the
[02:01:01.775 --> 02:01:06.156]  Mall of America, you know, the weekly stabbings and all the rest of it, the Allah Akbar screaming.
[02:01:07.817 --> 02:01:10.758]  I can't move to their countries and have any of my freedom, so... Oh, come here!
[02:01:10.818 --> 02:01:11.878]  I'll do... Hell!
[02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:15.559]  You don't see me with my daughters wearing burqas on our heads, we're bad people.
[02:01:15.619 --> 02:01:15.939]  There it is.
[02:01:16.679 --> 02:01:19.360]  City cracks down on Islamophobia.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.000]  City Council.
[02:01:20.341 --> 02:01:23.101]  After parents withdraw children from school mosque strips.
[02:01:24.582 --> 02:01:28.343]  Yeah, you don't want your little girls going to a mosque where they cut girls' genitals off, or...
[02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:31.016]  You know, support suicide bombing or whatever?
[02:01:31.076 --> 02:01:32.997]  Well, that's a problem!
[02:01:33.017 --> 02:01:35.779]  And again, it's all about the left breaking your will.
[02:01:36.239 --> 02:01:44.583]  We're gonna take your kids to story time and have a 500-pound man in a wig dressed like a clown with devil horns swing off a pole and shake their butt in your face!
[02:01:45.744 --> 02:01:49.446]  And Millie Weaver and Gavin covered that on Monday.
[02:01:49.626 --> 02:01:57.931]  It was so powerful, that happening in Austin, Texas with the Drag Queen Festival, that I predicted they will not cover it in the media.
[02:01:59.165 --> 02:02:04.187]  Or they will only take quotes about what I said and edit it out of context.
[02:02:04.747 --> 02:02:07.528]  So I said, what's up with these 500-pound drag queens?
[02:02:08.088 --> 02:02:08.568]  And what's up?
[02:02:08.748 --> 02:02:10.488]  And then why are they sexualizing children?
[02:02:10.769 --> 02:02:17.991]  They had all these articles in The Advocate and everywhere else, never saying there was video of them with little kids and naked men with glitter on their genitals.
[02:02:19.391 --> 02:02:20.431]  Which I can't even show here.
[02:02:20.451 --> 02:02:22.592]  I mean, go ahead and roll down, but don't show some of the others.
[02:02:22.932 --> 02:02:24.733]  This shows them kissing the kids there.
[02:02:25.273 --> 02:02:28.554]  A guy's naked with glitter on his... You know what?
[02:02:31.274 --> 02:02:33.115]  Ladies and gentlemen, but the media was just all over it.
[02:02:33.175 --> 02:02:36.196]  Jones is attacking drag queens and sexualized children for no reason!
[02:02:36.256 --> 02:02:41.198]  And this just has edited tapes of me saying it, not showing... I was talking about that.
[02:02:41.718 --> 02:02:42.819]  That's true fake news.
[02:02:43.179 --> 02:02:44.139]  That's true deception.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:48.601]  But coming up, Tommy Robinson, I want to play this little promo piece.
[02:02:49.122 --> 02:02:51.343]  This is For the Rebel, the Tommy Robinson Show.
[02:02:51.443 --> 02:02:51.823]  I love it.
[02:02:51.863 --> 02:02:52.163]  Here it is.
[02:02:59.867 --> 02:03:02.469]  For over a decade, I've been warning the British public about Islam.
[02:03:03.389 --> 02:03:10.054]  I've talked honestly about the effects of this authoritarian ideology that's been forced on us by the elitists, the bureaucrats, and the far-left extremists.
[02:03:10.394 --> 02:03:14.557]  And the fact is, the police, the councils, the government, everyone needs to wake up.
[02:03:14.857 --> 02:03:16.038]  But the media don't want to listen.
[02:03:16.338 --> 02:03:20.080]  In fact, they want it to demonise me and every other working-class person like me.
[02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:24.463]  Some of these Burkha people are... There's radio and the news of a racist bogeyman.
[02:03:24.723 --> 02:03:25.944]  People wanting to murder me and massacre me.
[02:03:25.964 --> 02:03:27.585]  Well then stop being a racist and a bigot!
[02:03:27.645 --> 02:03:27.986]  Racist?
[02:03:29.312 --> 02:03:30.753]  They didn't want to listen to our concerns.
[02:03:31.493 --> 02:03:32.253]  They laughed at us.
[02:03:32.693 --> 02:03:33.714]  They tried to silence us.
[02:03:34.494 --> 02:03:39.736]  And now, they're all watching us.
[02:03:39.796 --> 02:03:40.997]  We were right all along.
[02:03:41.957 --> 02:03:43.538]  The press lied to the public about my beliefs.
[02:03:44.018 --> 02:03:45.979]  They tried to make me out to be a national hate figure.
[02:03:46.579 --> 02:03:49.300]  They want you to think that everywhere I go, I'm hated, I'm attacked.
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:50.881]  It's not even close to the truth.
[02:03:51.141 --> 02:03:52.041]  It's a total lie.
[02:03:52.841 --> 02:03:56.423]  Behind closed doors, people, all backgrounds and classes are waking up to the truth.
[02:03:57.103 --> 02:03:58.024]  We're all in grave danger.
[02:03:58.044 --> 02:04:02.986]  We've all been sold out by a media establishment that is funded by people who are working towards our destruction.
[02:04:03.607 --> 02:04:05.708]  Islamists, globalists and the far left.
[02:04:06.248 --> 02:04:07.489]  The establishment hates us.
[02:04:08.129 --> 02:04:09.950]  Our children are being abused and indoctrinated.
[02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:11.771]  Popular culture is brainwashed at us.
[02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:13.852]  And we're being sold out by our politicians.
[02:04:14.432 --> 02:04:16.914]  Rich and poor, black and white, young and old.
[02:04:17.374 --> 02:04:18.555]  We're all fair game.
[02:04:19.435 --> 02:04:22.897]  We must unite to protect the civilisation we love before it's too late.
[02:04:24.454 --> 02:04:27.497]  In less than a year, I've worked with the rebels to bring you the other side of the story.
[02:04:28.037 --> 02:04:32.041]  We've highlighted the failure of our justice system, our social services, and our government.
[02:04:32.141 --> 02:04:35.584]  Hate preachers are inciting murder against people inside this building.
[02:04:35.925 --> 02:04:40.009]  I've confronted the grooming gangs, the biased journalists, and the leftist authoritarians.
[02:04:40.029 --> 02:04:42.331]  And I've barely even started.
[02:04:44.804 --> 02:04:47.588]  I want to bring you a show that really rivals the liberal, elitist media.
[02:04:48.449 --> 02:04:50.271]  To cover the stories you care about.
[02:04:50.932 --> 02:04:53.155]  Report on the events you can't make it to.
[02:04:53.255 --> 02:04:54.597]  And bring truth to your screens.
[02:04:55.599 --> 02:04:57.101]  I call it the Tommy Robinson Show.
[02:04:57.962 --> 02:05:00.946]  With your help, we'll make the mainstream media hear you.
[02:05:01.547 --> 02:05:02.248]  That's right, folks.
[02:05:03.237 --> 02:05:11.925]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:05:11.985 --> 02:05:12.446]  That's right.
[02:05:12.506 --> 02:05:17.511]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:24.197]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[02:05:24.437 --> 02:05:31.744]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:32.224]  Woo!
[02:05:32.284 --> 02:05:33.205]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:41.912]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:05:42.053 --> 02:05:50.160]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:05:51.641 --> 02:05:54.962]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:05:55.062 --> 02:05:58.962]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:05:59.022 --> 02:06:00.102]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:06:00.263 --> 02:06:02.923]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:12.465 --> 02:06:20.146]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:27.533 --> 02:06:29.846]  Never under tension, begging you to touch me.
[02:06:40.851 --> 02:06:42.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of big breaking news.
[02:06:42.833 --> 02:06:55.024]  The House Republicans have passed the massive Trump tax reform bill that many experts agree would boost the economy seven to ten percent growth rates per year and keep us out of the depression the globalists were planning.
[02:06:55.605 --> 02:06:58.948]  That is absolutely huge, huge news.
[02:06:59.808 --> 02:07:00.749]  Tommy Robinson
[02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:06.893]  The activist and citizen over in the UK has launched the Tommy Robinson Show.
[02:07:07.394 --> 02:07:20.902]  And I got to tell you, the story he tells in that trailer, that is the exact story we've tried to tell of globalism trying to sell us out, trying to bring us down, trying to Islamify the culture in their own documents to collapse society.
[02:07:20.922 --> 02:07:25.045]  So we're going to play that trailer again at the start of the next segment if you missed it.
[02:07:25.545 --> 02:07:30.429]  But I wanted to get Tommy on because I saw reports where families are being called racist or hateful.
[02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:35.271]  If they won't take their kids to mosque on these forced trips to mosque.
[02:07:36.852 --> 02:07:42.696]  I mean, imagine where a bunch of weird men are for sexual mutilization of women and all the rest of it.
[02:07:42.736 --> 02:07:44.657]  So the left is totally allied with this.
[02:07:45.077 --> 02:07:46.038]  That's in the news now.
[02:07:47.179 --> 02:07:56.624]  We have Mall of America up in Minnesota that looks like Somalia and then they're stabbing and attacking people every week just there until no one will go there now.
[02:07:57.084 --> 02:07:59.346]  You can't go to Somalia, they'll kill you in two seconds.
[02:08:00.143 --> 02:08:04.486]  So, what is going on in this larger master plan?
[02:08:05.206 --> 02:08:09.909]  And so, again, Tommy Robinson joins us, TommyRobinson.com.
[02:08:10.329 --> 02:08:16.052]  He's also got the newest book, Enemy of the State, and also Muhammad's Quran, actually quoting what's in it.
[02:08:16.092 --> 02:08:19.735]  So, Tommy, you're the tip of the spear when it comes to exposing this.
[02:08:20.315 --> 02:08:21.596]  Always great to have you.
[02:08:22.396 --> 02:08:24.878]  Back with us in the Rebel Media and the great work they're doing.
[02:08:24.898 --> 02:08:27.479]  I know getting attacked by Soros and others just like we are.
[02:08:27.799 --> 02:08:29.640]  You know when somebody's doing good work, they're under attack.
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:34.123]  So listeners and viewers should remember to support you, support us, if you believe what we're doing.
[02:08:34.143 --> 02:08:35.243]  Because hey, we're not complaining.
[02:08:35.603 --> 02:08:36.704]  We're going to fight regardless.
[02:08:36.744 --> 02:08:45.068]  But the more you pray for us, the more you spread the links, the more you buy the products, the more you become a subscriber to his show, the more you can put out the main broadcast to everybody.
[02:08:45.529 --> 02:08:46.429]  We're in this together.
[02:08:46.469 --> 02:08:47.310]  This is a war.
[02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:51.591]  We're not financed by Soros, or the Saudi Kings, or the globalists.
[02:08:51.611 --> 02:08:52.852]  We're financed by you.
[02:08:53.332 --> 02:08:54.132]  We're in this together.
[02:08:54.172 --> 02:08:56.433]  So, Tommy Robinson, thank you for joining us.
[02:08:56.833 --> 02:08:59.294]  The Islamification is only intensifying.
[02:08:59.694 --> 02:09:01.895]  Weekly truck attacks in Europe and the U.S.
[02:09:02.815 --> 02:09:04.596]  They had congressional hearings last week.
[02:09:05.501 --> 02:09:09.743]  Saying, Jones reported there was an Islamic attack, and Paul Watson did.
[02:09:09.983 --> 02:09:12.264]  That is fake, and we want him shut down.
[02:09:12.304 --> 02:09:17.326]  The number one story on Twitter about the attack in New York was Infowars Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:09:17.666 --> 02:09:21.607]  And the heads of Twitter, Google, and Facebook said, Sir, we censored them at lunch.
[02:09:21.648 --> 02:09:22.668]  You're right, they're bad.
[02:09:23.068 --> 02:09:35.033]  So they're now saying, not just that we're racist, or sexist, or Islamophobic, or whatever the new crap is, now it's fake news to report that the sun came up, Tommy.
[02:09:37.082 --> 02:09:52.434]  I'm seeing, and I think this is only the start of Twitter, Facebook, even just yesterday I lost my blue tick, and I'm gutted about it if I'm honest, I keep saying it, I'm gutted, where they said that this is new Twitter regulations.
[02:09:52.894 --> 02:10:00.097]  New Twitter regulations where they don't want to be seen as though they're endorsing people, so they've withdrew certain people's blue ticks.
[02:10:00.157 --> 02:10:01.958]  I believe Laura Loomer had hers removed.
[02:10:02.298 --> 02:10:07.120]  I believe all the people that had theirs removed are on the right of politics and talk about Islam.
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.580]  That's the way I see it.
[02:10:09.681 --> 02:10:10.241]  And currently,
[02:10:11.573 --> 02:10:11.853]  We're good.
[02:10:28.004 --> 02:10:30.325]  Let's explain what blue tick means for folks that don't know.
[02:10:30.706 --> 02:10:34.828]  It simply means you send in your license once you get big enough on Twitter or Facebook.
[02:10:35.328 --> 02:10:40.552]  You send it in, it proves that you are who you say you are to supposedly stop identity theft.
[02:10:40.852 --> 02:10:45.715]  That's all it means is that yes, you're a public figure and you are who you say you are.
[02:10:46.906 --> 02:10:48.087]  That's it.
[02:10:48.127 --> 02:10:56.733]  If you search Tommy Robinson now on Twitter, you'll find multiple accounts using the same picture as me, exactly the same details as me, pretending to be me.
[02:10:57.314 --> 02:11:04.800]  Now, the blue tick used to mean I am the official Tommy Robinson, so people understand that that's what I'm saying is who I am.
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:13.306]  Now, there's obviously... Now that we've withdrew the blue tick, but while withdrawing the blue tick, they said because they don't want to be seen to endorse me.
[02:11:13.826 --> 02:11:15.628]  But then all the other people that I've just named,
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.562]  Even Harvey Weinstein?
[02:11:19.082 --> 02:11:19.863]  He's got a blue tick.
[02:11:19.883 --> 02:11:21.584]  There's multiple other people still with blue ticks.
[02:11:21.684 --> 02:11:24.607]  Well, before we had ours, we know why they're taking it away.
[02:11:25.027 --> 02:11:29.271]  Now people can masquerade as you, say horrible things that are attributed to you.
[02:11:29.531 --> 02:11:30.812]  They're getting ready to steal your identity.
[02:11:31.704 --> 02:11:33.845]  And the media will probably run with the stories, yeah.
[02:11:33.905 --> 02:11:35.246]  Tommy Robinson said on Twitter.
[02:11:35.726 --> 02:11:36.967]  Tommy Robinson said on Twitter.
[02:11:37.227 --> 02:11:40.929]  But to be honest, to be honest, Alex, I'm surprised they haven't closed my Twitter.
[02:11:41.569 --> 02:11:43.070]  And that is the next step.
[02:11:43.210 --> 02:11:44.210]  And that's not just for me.
[02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:46.591]  That'll be for yourselves as well, I think, Paul Joseph.
[02:11:46.812 --> 02:11:49.753]  I think at some point, our Twitter accounts will be closed.
[02:11:50.233 --> 02:11:51.634]  Our Facebook pages will be closed.
[02:11:52.222 --> 02:11:55.784]  Our ability to coordinate and cooperate and reach the masses.
[02:11:57.065 --> 02:12:01.428]  Obviously, I think in a four-week period, my tweets reached 193 million people.
[02:12:01.849 --> 02:12:04.750]  My videos on Facebook were viewed by 49 million people.
[02:12:05.151 --> 02:12:05.931]  This scares them.
[02:12:06.932 --> 02:12:09.414]  It scares them because we are reaching the masses.
[02:12:09.874 --> 02:12:14.317]  Instead of going on the streets like I used to do in my previous organisation, we don't need to.
[02:12:15.253 --> 02:12:22.366]  We're reaching straight into people's living rooms and talking to them direct, without the media bias, without the attack against us or the agenda against us.
[02:12:22.447 --> 02:12:24.811]  So that's how I see things going.
[02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:25.632]  This is just the start.
[02:12:28.308 --> 02:12:29.569]  Let's get into the latest news.
[02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:35.595]  You've been decrying for a decade that they make children go to mosque repeatedly, they teach the Quran, they have them dressed like it.
[02:12:35.615 --> 02:12:36.977]  They're clearly being indoctrinated.
[02:12:37.277 --> 02:12:38.558]  Local governments have been bought off.
[02:12:38.578 --> 02:12:41.742]  They even let the Muslims sexually recruit young girls by the thousands.
[02:12:42.702 --> 02:12:44.604]  You first said that over a decade ago.
[02:12:44.644 --> 02:12:45.806]  It's all been confirmed now.
[02:12:46.406 --> 02:12:47.687]  Now they're going to go out to the parents.
[02:12:47.728 --> 02:12:48.769]  They're saying that don't
[02:12:49.835 --> 02:13:01.443]  Let the government, you keep your children home from school, you gotta sign a form to let them go to the zoo or the planetarium, a consent form, but now they're saying, we don't want you to have consent, we're sending your kids to the mosque.
[02:13:02.604 --> 02:13:10.149]  Yeah, and what they've now come out and said, if parents stop their children going to the mosque, they'll do virtual tours, and they'll bring the imams into the schools.
[02:13:11.528 --> 02:13:18.512]  Now my daughter fortunately wasn't very well on the day that the children at her school had to go to the mosque.
[02:13:18.972 --> 02:13:26.696]  This is a part of our national curriculum now where they bring all children to the mosque and they're being lied to.
[02:13:26.736 --> 02:13:28.196]  They're taken there and they're deceived.
[02:13:28.557 --> 02:13:29.477]  They're lied to with the
[02:13:29.617 --> 02:13:36.200]  They say, this is a religion of peace, and having your genitals cut off is liberal, and women aren't, but of course they don't tell you any of that.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:40.381]  They say, yo, that's heavenly, it's loving, and the West attacked it.
[02:13:40.421 --> 02:13:44.503]  I've read the curriculum, and white people are evil, but the Muslims are wonderful.
[02:13:45.694 --> 02:13:46.415]  That's it.
[02:13:46.675 --> 02:13:48.376]  And Islam is pro-women's rights.
[02:13:48.697 --> 02:13:50.518]  This is the sort of things they're teaching all the children.
[02:13:50.858 --> 02:14:02.568]  And I explained to you before, Alex, that when I took my daughter to look at a new school, the bigger school, they had all these... When you took the children round, the children had to do like a test.
[02:14:03.089 --> 02:14:04.850]  And the test was from religious symbols.
[02:14:05.411 --> 02:14:09.054]  And I watched as the only religious symbols the children knew.
[02:14:09.734 --> 02:14:10.895]  They obviously knew Christianity.
[02:14:11.096 --> 02:14:14.399]  The only other one that every one of them just went straight away was Islam.
[02:14:14.859 --> 02:14:15.940]  Islam and the mosque.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:16.981]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:14:17.562 --> 02:14:23.027]  And I've said to you before as well about when my daughter... I'll bring you back to just my home experiences.
[02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:24.509]  My daughter walked past me
[02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:28.711]  I had the biography of Muhammad on the side because I was practicing and researching.
[02:14:29.191 --> 02:14:30.531]  And my daughter walked past.
[02:14:30.592 --> 02:14:33.733]  And bearing in mind, I want my children to remain children for as long as possible.
[02:14:34.333 --> 02:14:40.256]  I tried to avoid politics and avoid the discussions on Islam with them as long as I possibly could.
[02:14:40.776 --> 02:14:43.637]  And I think she was seven years old at the time.
[02:14:44.197 --> 02:14:47.319]  And she's walked past and she said, Muhammad, peace be upon him.
[02:14:47.339 --> 02:14:49.800]  And I said, darling, why have you just said that?
[02:14:50.592 --> 02:14:52.614]  She said that's what we got taught at school, we have to say that.
[02:14:52.834 --> 02:14:54.956]  And that's right, and your book is written in Arabic.
[02:14:55.016 --> 02:14:58.739]  She literally looked at it and knew what it was because she was so indoctrinated.
[02:14:58.759 --> 02:15:00.360]  You're keeping her innocent, as you should.
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:03.083]  And by the way, we just put up mainstream news articles in the U.S.
[02:15:03.383 --> 02:15:05.004]  where they make the kids pray.
[02:15:05.425 --> 02:15:07.366]  Now, I used to hear this 15 years ago in the U.S.
[02:15:07.426 --> 02:15:08.187]  and thought it was made up.
[02:15:08.527 --> 02:15:11.310]  I used to hear you say it 15 years ago, and I thought, that just can't be true.
[02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:12.611]  No, it's all true.
[02:15:12.691 --> 02:15:13.952]  And worse, it's everywhere.
[02:15:14.232 --> 02:15:15.413]  And they're doing it in Austin.
[02:15:16.414 --> 02:15:19.095]  Thousands and thousands of, quote, refugees.
[02:15:19.375 --> 02:15:25.037]  They're full-grown men, 20 years old, 22, in the schools with the freshmen.
[02:15:25.658 --> 02:15:31.460]  And they're putting full-grown men in with the kids, and then they're teaching them, quote, Islam at Anderson High School.
[02:15:33.068 --> 02:16:00.900]  We had, after the Manchester bombing, after the Manchester bombing, in Manchester City, there was a documentary filming in the school, and the school the next day got, after the Manchester bombing, after Alar Akbar had been screened and children had been blown to pieces just four months ago, they got a pupil up, a Syrian pupil, up in front of the class, all the children, which were non-Muslim, got down on the floor, they all prayed whilst they all shouted... Stay there, stay there!
[02:16:03.735 --> 02:16:10.439]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[02:16:11.199 --> 02:16:13.361]  By studying what they fear.
[02:16:14.061 --> 02:16:15.862]  They fear families living together.
[02:16:15.922 --> 02:16:18.844]  They fear people loving God.
[02:16:18.924 --> 02:16:23.567]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[02:16:24.868 --> 02:16:32.112]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[02:16:34.096 --> 02:16:40.517]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[02:16:42.077 --> 02:16:48.198]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[02:16:49.079 --> 02:17:02.181]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[02:17:03.194 --> 02:17:09.779]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:18.846]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[02:17:20.547 --> 02:17:21.748]  And so many things will happen.
[02:17:22.949 --> 02:17:23.930]  We are the majority.
[02:17:24.841 --> 02:17:33.592]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[02:17:34.733 --> 02:17:39.760]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[02:17:41.189 --> 02:17:43.650]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[02:17:44.491 --> 02:17:52.675]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[02:17:53.376 --> 02:17:59.739]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.501]  So many people write me.
[02:18:03.328 --> 02:18:11.577]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[02:18:12.318 --> 02:18:13.940]  We have to fly our flag.
[02:18:14.909 --> 02:18:16.370]  We have to wear our colors.
[02:18:16.670 --> 02:18:21.312]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:21.972 --> 02:18:24.833]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[02:18:25.033 --> 02:18:36.298]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[02:18:36.518 --> 02:18:38.559]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:18:39.119 --> 02:18:41.300]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt?
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:43.981]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[02:18:44.401 --> 02:18:51.044]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[02:18:51.565 --> 02:18:56.207]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[02:18:57.087 --> 02:19:04.071]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[02:19:04.411 --> 02:19:07.392]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[02:19:07.752 --> 02:19:24.761]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[02:19:25.521 --> 02:19:34.286]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[02:19:34.946 --> 02:19:39.609]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[02:19:39.649 --> 02:19:49.174]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it
[02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:50.775]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:27.484]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:20:28.205 --> 02:20:29.586]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:46.425 --> 02:20:50.028]  Again, this is about survival of open, free civilization.
[02:20:50.748 --> 02:20:55.272]  And Islam, under its orthodox system, is like North Korea.
[02:20:56.273 --> 02:20:57.834]  It doesn't allow you to live your life.
[02:20:57.934 --> 02:20:59.235]  It takes control of you.
[02:20:59.815 --> 02:21:00.936]  It creates zealots.
[02:21:01.517 --> 02:21:02.818]  It completely enslaves women.
[02:21:02.878 --> 02:21:07.161]  And the left, globally, sees Islam and a billion and a half people, about to be three billion.
[02:21:07.401 --> 02:21:08.602]  They have, on average, six children.
[02:21:09.383 --> 02:21:10.364]  They see the West dying.
[02:21:11.621 --> 02:21:13.802]  And they say, let us accelerate this process for you.
[02:21:13.822 --> 02:21:14.922]  We're going to bring in Islam.
[02:21:14.942 --> 02:21:17.463]  We're going to get bought off by the second wave of it.
[02:21:17.743 --> 02:21:19.163]  The third wave is going to conquer you.
[02:21:19.463 --> 02:21:21.144]  And they write all these white papers.
[02:21:21.184 --> 02:21:21.864]  I've read them on air.
[02:21:22.184 --> 02:21:28.566]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Shang, the EU, Peter Sutherland, the head of the EU program.
[02:21:29.106 --> 02:21:30.306]  Whites are inherently bad.
[02:21:30.766 --> 02:21:31.707]  Christians are bad.
[02:21:32.027 --> 02:21:32.667]  Europe's bad.
[02:21:33.447 --> 02:21:34.447]  And we're going to bring in Islam.
[02:21:35.688 --> 02:21:36.708]  And you go, why would they say that?
[02:21:36.748 --> 02:21:37.508]  They're white people.
[02:21:38.088 --> 02:21:39.389]  They're just getting the payoff.
[02:21:39.409 --> 02:21:40.349]  They're just amoral.
[02:21:41.533 --> 02:21:43.355]  And they understand racial politics.
[02:21:44.137 --> 02:21:56.153]  If you're gonna have, you know, 10 billion people that aren't white in the world, and 600 million white people, about to be even less, whites are all dying, and then it's just like, let's all gang up now here at the end, race politics!
[02:21:57.901 --> 02:22:02.163]  And then it's crazy little demon toads like Peter Sutherland who actually say this.
[02:22:02.223 --> 02:22:03.523]  People say, well, what are you doing?
[02:22:03.543 --> 02:22:04.824]  Other people's show is promoting them.
[02:22:04.864 --> 02:22:06.024]  Aren't you about your own show?
[02:22:06.044 --> 02:22:08.345]  Folks, I'm about fighting the New World Order.
[02:22:08.685 --> 02:22:10.806]  I'm about ringing the alarm bell for you and everybody else.
[02:22:11.126 --> 02:22:12.766]  It's not the average Muslim that's bad.
[02:22:12.786 --> 02:22:14.827]  It's not the average person that has brown skin that's bad.
[02:22:15.167 --> 02:22:22.650]  They're being organized into race-based systems by super cold-blooded people that want global domination.
[02:22:23.888 --> 02:22:31.534]  But just like they tell the third world, oh, we got carbon taxes seven years ago at the UN meeting in Copenhagen, we're going to tax the wealthy whites.
[02:22:32.315 --> 02:22:36.518]  When they got the actual global legislation, it basically doubled taxes on the third world.
[02:22:36.798 --> 02:22:38.480]  They've been exploiting these people all day.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.585]  They just want to get them on board in race-based politics, so they're not going to really give them an economy, they're just going to give them racism.
[02:22:45.245 --> 02:22:49.868]  So Tommy Robbins is with us a little bit in the next segment, but I wanted to play this promo for his new show.
[02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:52.749]  And I understand he's doing it from a microphone, a TV studio.
[02:22:52.789 --> 02:22:53.310]  It looks great.
[02:22:53.350 --> 02:22:53.770]  It's wonderful.
[02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:54.891]  That's important to do.
[02:22:54.911 --> 02:22:56.952]  And as he gets more famous, it gets dangerous for him on the street.
[02:22:56.972 --> 02:22:58.993]  But that on the street stuff's great as well.
[02:22:59.013 --> 02:22:59.954]  That's why I still go out.
[02:23:00.314 --> 02:23:11.000]  That's why when Troyer goes out, Millie Weaver goes out, Rob Doo goes out, because we show how vicious the left and how vicious Islam is, and how anti-Western, anti-progress, anti-woman they are.
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:11.821]  But here it is.
[02:23:12.361 --> 02:23:14.423]  The new promo for Tommy Robinson that says it all.
[02:23:14.443 --> 02:23:15.124]  We're under attack.
[02:23:15.384 --> 02:23:16.205]  They said we were wrong.
[02:23:16.425 --> 02:23:17.526]  We've all been proven right.
[02:23:17.886 --> 02:23:18.867]  Now we're standing up.
[02:23:18.968 --> 02:23:19.928]  The fight is now.
[02:23:20.189 --> 02:23:23.632]  Decide if you want to just commit cultural suicide and be conquered.
[02:23:24.913 --> 02:23:26.375]  Or decide whether you want to say no.
[02:23:26.435 --> 02:23:26.835]  Here it is.
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:33.602]  The past two weeks on the Tommy Robinson Show.
[02:23:35.387 --> 02:23:38.771]  How many refugees do you think Germany can take?
[02:23:40.252 --> 02:23:42.395]  Maximum is four million.
[02:23:42.795 --> 02:23:44.036]  You can take four million refugees?
[02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.630]  Yes.
[02:23:46.770 --> 02:23:50.253]  If 5 million Muslims wanted to come in as refugees tomorrow, you'd welcome them?
[02:23:50.773 --> 02:23:51.414]  Yes, I would.
[02:23:51.474 --> 02:23:54.256]  If you look at England, I don't see a big problem there.
[02:23:54.877 --> 02:23:56.418]  Where in the Bible does it tell you to take 9?
[02:23:56.578 --> 02:24:01.022]  Where does it say in the Bible about being... Europe's already taken 10,000.
[02:24:01.242 --> 02:24:01.823]  Quite a lot.
[02:24:01.843 --> 02:24:04.986]  Five refugees have committed acts of terror in Europe in the last year.
[02:24:05.266 --> 02:24:08.629]  If you welcomed 100,000, how would you tell who's a terrorist and who's not?
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:22.164]  Could you imagine this in England?
[02:24:22.244 --> 02:24:34.271]  Again, for radio it's strong, but it's really powerful for video.
[02:24:35.251 --> 02:24:37.732]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:24:38.593 --> 02:24:41.815]  So again, the globalists know this is going to be another 20 year process.
[02:24:43.027 --> 02:24:43.347]  Okay.
[02:24:43.528 --> 02:24:51.255]  And I know it's going to create such societal collapse and such societal crisis that authoritarians want to come in to control the chaos.
[02:24:51.275 --> 02:25:00.843]  But there's no doubt that 10 million in Europe, millions here, just in the last couple of years have brought in anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-woman, anti-gay
[02:25:01.724 --> 02:25:06.465]  Crazed people that kill each other in their own countries and know they're attacking and are covering it up.
[02:25:06.805 --> 02:25:08.226]  What, until they build a critical mass?
[02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:13.687]  I mean, they've blown up the drawbridge, they've stormed the castle, they want reinforcements in before they declare what's happened.
[02:25:13.927 --> 02:25:20.789]  I mean, why are they clamping down and even saying in Congress, Alex Jones cannot tell people that a Muslim killed folks in New York.
[02:25:20.989 --> 02:25:21.689]  They actually say that.
[02:25:21.909 --> 02:25:23.810]  They say, this is fake news, it must be banned.
[02:25:25.825 --> 02:25:34.168]  Alex, you know what's amazing for me was I've recently traveled to East Germany and I've just come back from Poland three or four days ago, yeah?
[02:25:34.829 --> 02:25:50.295]  The difference in Poland, when you see a country where you never thought people would be grateful for communism at a time, but because they had communism and because it didn't change till 1990 and because of the Iron Curtain... They recognize authoritarianism.
[02:25:51.437 --> 02:25:52.497]  Yeah, they recognise it.
[02:25:52.897 --> 02:25:55.518]  They didn't have an influx of immigration.
[02:25:56.118 --> 02:26:03.300]  So they're still, because they're the only culture and the only race in their country, they're allowed to be proud of who they are.
[02:26:03.901 --> 02:26:05.101]  In our country, we can't.
[02:26:05.601 --> 02:26:12.043]  I've just come back and I've come back and I've seen the most unbelievable scenes of patriotism that I've never seen.
[02:26:12.323 --> 02:26:15.704]  I've never experienced anything like I experienced this weekend in Poland.
[02:26:16.304 --> 02:26:25.186]  I saw hundreds of thousands of Polish who were defiant, who were so energetic, in love with their identity, their history, their culture.
[02:26:25.246 --> 02:26:31.407]  And that's because they've been overrun by the Muslims more than 20 times, and the Nazis, and the Communists, and the Russians, and they understand.
[02:26:31.867 --> 02:26:35.308]  And you're right, they never had the first level invasions in the last 50 years.
[02:26:35.708 --> 02:26:40.829]  Suddenly when the next mass wave hit, that was supposed to hit Germany and Europe, it was already conditioned and broke.
[02:26:41.169 --> 02:26:46.590]  They got hit with such a massive wave of giant snakes of millions of people, they went, this is an invasion!
[02:26:47.430 --> 02:26:49.670]  Grandpa, grandma, my mama got hit by this!
[02:26:50.091 --> 02:26:56.152]  I saw Nazi invasions, I saw Soviet invasions, and great-great-grandpa saw Muslim invasions, and that's what this is!
[02:26:56.212 --> 02:26:56.832]  They know!
[02:26:58.152 --> 02:26:59.112]  They know!
[02:26:59.252 --> 02:27:00.972]  They know what it's like to fight!
[02:27:01.052 --> 02:27:02.113]  It's what they said to us!
[02:27:02.633 --> 02:27:03.693]  You haven't been challenged!
[02:27:04.173 --> 02:27:05.193]  You have not been challenged!
[02:27:05.453 --> 02:27:09.254]  The biggest civil uprising in history was in Warsaw, I believe, in 1944.
[02:27:09.294 --> 02:27:10.434]  That was the Jews, yeah.
[02:27:11.517 --> 02:27:15.541]  They all have relatives after relatives who have told them these stories.
[02:27:15.581 --> 02:27:17.263]  They understand the need to fight.
[02:27:17.483 --> 02:27:19.184]  They understand the battle against communism.
[02:27:19.425 --> 02:27:21.226]  They understand what communism has done to their country.
[02:27:21.467 --> 02:27:22.668]  They understand what Islam will do.
[02:27:23.008 --> 02:27:30.795]  And I went and met a politician from there, a leading MP from the Law and Justice Party, their leading political party, who are in power.
[02:27:31.356 --> 02:27:36.381]  And the difference in this man compared to any MP in Britain
[02:27:36.874 --> 02:27:48.162]  The difference in him, how openly he spoke, how he didn't dodge questions, how he was, his main concern and his main reason was to stand up for Polish people and make sure they're safe.
[02:27:48.662 --> 02:27:52.084]  He welcomed me, and it was just, it was refreshing.
[02:27:52.124 --> 02:27:53.905]  He wasn't a fake, he was a man.
[02:27:54.806 --> 02:27:55.326]  He was a man!
[02:27:55.887 --> 02:27:56.467]  He was a man!
[02:27:56.787 --> 02:27:57.888]  Poland is full of men!
[02:27:58.348 --> 02:27:59.129]  Real men!
[02:28:00.231 --> 02:28:00.751]  Real men!
[02:28:01.151 --> 02:28:05.093]  And it was so refreshing to- But you know, Russia has gotten out from under communism as well.
[02:28:05.393 --> 02:28:10.074]  They recognize Islam as an open, dominating force, as a cult!
[02:28:10.355 --> 02:28:11.295]  I mean, it's simple!
[02:28:11.455 --> 02:28:15.076]  I mean, there's not a more ravenous, out-of-control cult in the world!
[02:28:16.136 --> 02:28:23.219]  When I went to East Germany, when I went to East Germany and I spoke to elder people there, they said, we've seen this before.
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.102]  You can't talk about it.
[02:28:25.783 --> 02:28:26.684]  You'll lose your job.
[02:28:27.224 --> 02:28:28.186]  This is communism.
[02:28:28.486 --> 02:28:29.547]  We've had communism.
[02:28:29.808 --> 02:28:31.209]  We've got away from that.
[02:28:31.450 --> 02:28:32.731]  Now we have the same with Islam.
[02:28:32.952 --> 02:28:33.953]  You can't talk about Islam.
[02:28:33.993 --> 02:28:35.114]  You can't talk about the refugees.
[02:28:35.134 --> 02:28:35.735]  You'll lose your job.
[02:28:35.755 --> 02:28:36.316]  You'll lose your work.
[02:28:37.145 --> 02:28:50.437]  So, to see the difference in the different countries, and to know that Eastern Europe, to know that Hungary, to know that Poland, to know that Czech Republic, I think are going to become countries that we all look to for inspiration.
[02:28:50.517 --> 02:28:51.537]  Exactly.
[02:28:51.598 --> 02:28:52.899]  All because they won't be conquered.
[02:28:53.239 --> 02:28:54.260]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:57.543]  Remember, it's the mega-banks, the ultra-rich using the Muslims.
[02:28:57.623 --> 02:28:59.144]  They are being used.
[02:28:59.184 --> 02:28:59.925]  They're victims too.
[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:13.314]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[02:29:14.114 --> 02:29:23.498]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[02:29:23.898 --> 02:29:26.859]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[02:29:27.459 --> 02:29:37.153]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[02:29:37.614 --> 02:29:42.821]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[02:29:43.862 --> 02:29:45.604]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[02:29:45.664 --> 02:29:46.585]  It's a limited edition.
[02:29:47.146 --> 02:29:49.148]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:29:49.388 --> 02:29:56.114]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[02:29:56.335 --> 02:30:00.639]  And on the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[02:30:00.879 --> 02:30:02.380]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[02:30:03.101 --> 02:30:08.445]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[02:30:08.746 --> 02:30:17.573]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[02:30:17.973 --> 02:30:22.136]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[02:30:22.637 --> 02:30:23.738]  And of course, this classic?
[02:30:24.438 --> 02:30:25.019]  Says it all.
[02:30:25.139 --> 02:30:26.020]  Need I say more?
[02:30:26.521 --> 02:30:28.122]  You want to have a political message out there?
[02:30:28.162 --> 02:30:33.948]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:37.352]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[02:30:37.793 --> 02:30:43.378]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[02:30:44.099 --> 02:30:46.421]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[02:30:46.741 --> 02:30:55.128]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[02:30:55.408 --> 02:30:58.971]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[02:30:59.791 --> 02:31:09.262]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[02:31:09.422 --> 02:31:11.905]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[02:31:12.286 --> 02:31:13.907]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[02:31:14.648 --> 02:31:15.749]  I designed this baby.
[02:31:15.829 --> 02:31:18.250]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:22.893]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:31:23.273 --> 02:31:27.095]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[02:31:27.535 --> 02:31:30.257]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[02:31:30.277 --> 02:31:31.658]  It's been around about 19 years.
[02:31:32.258 --> 02:31:35.860]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:39.242]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[02:31:40.162 --> 02:31:43.744]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[02:31:44.464 --> 02:31:45.345]  That's disrespectful.
[02:31:45.365 --> 02:31:49.386]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[02:31:49.446 --> 02:31:56.890]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[02:31:57.310 --> 02:31:58.750]  Our republic is in distress.
[02:31:59.211 --> 02:31:59.691]  Ask me why.
[02:32:00.371 --> 02:32:02.272]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[02:32:02.432 --> 02:32:07.954]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[02:32:08.415 --> 02:32:09.895]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[02:32:09.955 --> 02:32:12.936]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[02:32:13.397 --> 02:32:15.558]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[02:32:16.178 --> 02:32:18.439]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[02:32:19.119 --> 02:32:19.920]  It's all about freedom.
[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:21.281]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[02:32:21.821 --> 02:32:22.741]  Resist Tyranny.
[02:32:23.382 --> 02:32:24.362]  Made in America.
[02:32:24.382 --> 02:32:24.362]  1776.
[02:32:24.803 --> 02:32:28.085]  I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[02:32:28.305 --> 02:32:29.286]  The backs are really cool.
[02:32:29.626 --> 02:32:30.286]  Look at that back.
[02:32:30.366 --> 02:32:31.247]  That's pure Americana.
[02:32:32.509 --> 02:32:37.631]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[02:32:37.771 --> 02:32:38.432]  The Dayglo.
[02:32:38.972 --> 02:32:43.054]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[02:32:43.214 --> 02:32:44.835]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[02:32:45.215 --> 02:32:46.535]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[02:32:46.775 --> 02:32:47.816]  It's got the nice patch.
[02:32:48.136 --> 02:32:49.177]  Infowars.com.
[02:32:49.417 --> 02:32:50.297]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[02:32:50.557 --> 02:32:53.999]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[02:32:54.399 --> 02:32:55.980]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[02:32:56.240 --> 02:33:00.742]  Thank you all for your support, and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:33:05.687 --> 02:33:08.316]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.161 --> 02:33:26.902]  Big Brother.
[02:33:27.302 --> 02:33:28.524]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:29.104 --> 02:33:30.186]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:31.027 --> 02:33:32.428]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:32.709 --> 02:33:33.850]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:42.179]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.264]  People ask me why I get so upset.
[02:33:48.797 --> 02:33:50.999]  It's because I'm not out to conquer anybody.
[02:33:51.239 --> 02:33:52.500]  I don't want to run anybody's life.
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:53.981]  I got too much going on in my own life.
[02:33:54.001 --> 02:33:56.743]  And then you study history and learn about people being conquered.
[02:33:56.763 --> 02:34:00.426]  And then you study modern politics and you realize it's really happening.
[02:34:01.367 --> 02:34:03.649]  And it just goes back to, I'm not the toughest guy around.
[02:34:03.669 --> 02:34:05.490]  I never won a fight that I started.
[02:34:05.610 --> 02:34:08.513]  And I probably only started a couple fights and I got my ass kicked both times.
[02:34:09.453 --> 02:34:11.355]  Because I wasn't in the right.
[02:34:11.755 --> 02:34:13.997]  I never lost a fight where somebody else started it.
[02:34:16.803 --> 02:34:30.468]  There's this thing about people saying, all these Imams, and it's the norm, we're gonna conquer you, we're gonna get you, there's nothing you can do, we're gonna take your women, and then it's like, you're gonna take my women and bring them to big palaces and make them free?
[02:34:30.548 --> 02:34:30.728]  No!
[02:34:30.968 --> 02:34:39.872]  We're gonna cut their vaginas off, and we're gonna not let them go to school, we're gonna put hoods over their heads, and we're all intermarried, and most of the birth defects are us.
[02:34:40.872 --> 02:34:43.113]  I'd tell the British Royal Family to stop intermarrying, you nuts!
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:48.222]  By the end of the different, you know why all the Egyptian dynasties started dying a couple generations in?
[02:34:48.262 --> 02:34:49.323]  Because they were inbreeding.
[02:34:50.483 --> 02:35:03.390]  I mean, it's just not good, and you see this, and then the left's allied with it, and then they had this drag queen festival with all these men naked with little kids with only glitter on their genitals, and they go, well, it's okay, it's liberal.
[02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:06.832]  Well, if you saw a guy naked at the park around kids, he'd go to jail.
[02:35:08.473 --> 02:35:10.954]  There were women with hijabs.
[02:35:12.458 --> 02:35:14.799]  And women with hijabs last weekend.
[02:35:14.819 --> 02:35:17.000]  We have some on video, but there's more on their Facebook channel.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:25.584]  They're clapping, giving money to the naked men with a unicorn horn is all they're wearing.
[02:35:26.585 --> 02:35:31.367]  And then there's silver glitter on his quite large non-erect member.
[02:35:32.908 --> 02:35:33.588]  I mean, this guy
[02:35:35.885 --> 02:35:38.546]  Basically looks like a gay porn star with a little kid.
[02:35:39.146 --> 02:35:40.907]  I mean, it's like, what world is this?
[02:35:40.947 --> 02:35:42.587]  And then there's women with a jibs there.
[02:35:42.607 --> 02:35:47.509]  And then you go to these rallies with Linda Sorcerer's family's in prison for, you know, being terrorists.
[02:35:47.869 --> 02:35:50.470]  And she's saying, feminism, cut your vagina off!
[02:35:50.490 --> 02:35:51.350]  They're like, yeah!
[02:35:51.610 --> 02:35:52.290]  Cut it off!
[02:35:52.690 --> 02:35:55.411]  And then we've got women in Germany going, Allah akbar!
[02:35:56.812 --> 02:36:01.233]  And then now in Sweden, they want to make the national
[02:36:03.482 --> 02:36:10.328]  Flag, Islamic, blue instead of red like turkey, saying because of the Crusades, picking and killing Muslims.
[02:36:10.628 --> 02:36:13.430]  The Crusades were after 200 plus years of Islamic invasion.
[02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:16.392]  The Islamists wrote books bragging about it.
[02:36:16.673 --> 02:36:17.713]  We lost Spain.
[02:36:17.994 --> 02:36:19.415]  We lost half of Poland.
[02:36:19.775 --> 02:36:21.857]  We lost Hungary, Romania, all of it.
[02:36:22.337 --> 02:36:26.380]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, Vlad the Impaler was the big dictator because he stopped them finally.
[02:36:26.721 --> 02:36:27.902]  Do you understand?
[02:36:29.322 --> 02:36:44.650]  Tommy, what is this, like these women that we know go to these anti-racism festivals in Sweden, and they're literally gang rape festivals where they line up 20 deep and rape women, the police do nothing, and the women later say, well, I'm Swedish so I deserve to be raped.
[02:36:45.611 --> 02:36:50.613]  And you're watching these women like begging for their lives being raped, and the liberals are like, it's liberal!
[02:36:50.873 --> 02:36:51.434]  It's liberal!
[02:36:51.734 --> 02:36:53.955]  Why is the left so into this?
[02:36:55.086 --> 02:36:56.187]  I've seen those interviews.
[02:36:56.567 --> 02:37:02.111]  I've seen those interviews with a Swedish lady when they're asking her and she said, well maybe it's something we done.
[02:37:02.571 --> 02:37:05.033]  Maybe we didn't because of their culture.
[02:37:05.454 --> 02:37:07.495]  It's like, it's painful.
[02:37:08.136 --> 02:37:12.559]  It's painful and to be honest, you see that, this left wing hysteria that's involved in this.
[02:37:13.319 --> 02:37:16.702]  I don't know any girls from our background or my background or any women I know
[02:37:17.295 --> 02:37:18.275]  That are lying to that.
[02:37:18.655 --> 02:37:24.998]  So I don't want to kid myself that, because this is a very loud, a very loud and prominent far-left group.
[02:37:25.598 --> 02:37:28.219]  But I wouldn't say they're in any way mainstream of the people.
[02:37:28.819 --> 02:37:29.419]  Of the people.
[02:37:29.699 --> 02:37:31.080]  But they are in control of the media.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:35.821]  It's like, you know, you're talking about those videos you just showed me of that man with that young child.
[02:37:36.641 --> 02:37:37.582]  That picture there.
[02:37:37.842 --> 02:37:38.082]  Yes.
[02:37:38.322 --> 02:37:39.002]  What is that?
[02:37:39.883 --> 02:37:46.825]  And just this week, just this week in the news in the UK, they're trialling it out in seven schools in London, where
[02:37:47.651 --> 02:37:59.944]  Ladyboys, which is all they can be called, ladyboys, transgenders, whatever you call them, will be going into nurseries, children aged two and three, to talk to them about gender.
[02:38:01.846 --> 02:38:02.587]  Aged two and three!
[02:38:03.308 --> 02:38:10.532]  Are they taking that on my... If anyone stood next to my kid... No, no, they bring scantily dressed men into the public schools in the U.S.
[02:38:11.033 --> 02:38:20.558]  and they tell the kids, you're not a boy, you're a girl, you're going to be a drag queen, and then a guy takes his pants off and walks around naked and the children hug and kiss him on TV.
[02:38:20.819 --> 02:38:21.799]  That's what we do in Austin.
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.363]  If anyone stood next to my kid like that, they'd know about it.
[02:38:27.823 --> 02:38:30.304]  If anyone stood... That is a... But you're hateful.
[02:38:30.344 --> 02:38:32.766]  You don't want to let your kids give money to guys pole dancing?
[02:38:33.644 --> 02:38:34.645]  That's child abuse.
[02:38:35.445 --> 02:38:36.226]  That's child abuse.
[02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:38.107]  Kids should not see that.
[02:38:39.348 --> 02:38:50.016]  It's funny, it's just mad timing that you're showing me that and just this week in the UK they're putting plans as a trial for seven schools in London.
[02:38:50.836 --> 02:38:55.438]  Where transgenders, ladyboys, whatever you call them, will be entering into schools.
[02:38:55.518 --> 02:38:59.480]  Oh yeah, that's Tavistock Institute, MI6, to break up the family.
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:08.804]  The government's going to come in, confuse your child, and then give them to a new sexual mentor that will be like their new mommy or daddy who is a obese man in a dress.
[02:39:10.137 --> 02:39:15.263]  We've just had a teacher suspended in Oxford, in England, this week.
[02:39:15.643 --> 02:39:22.931]  He's been suspended from work because he's got a girl, two girls, but one of the girls now decides she's a boy.
[02:39:22.951 --> 02:39:29.458]  Now he's been teaching them and at the end of their class, whatever they've done, he said, you've done well, good work girls.
[02:39:30.345 --> 02:39:31.606]  He's been suspended because he said ghost!
[02:39:31.806 --> 02:39:32.706]  That's right, let's go back.
[02:39:33.326 --> 02:39:35.868]  Parents are telling their one-year-olds, you're another sex now.
[02:39:36.108 --> 02:39:41.070]  There was a headline, transgender teaching to elementary schools and nurseries.
[02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:44.671]  There was a headline, nursery students to be, have their brains scrambled.
[02:39:44.952 --> 02:39:52.175]  As Camille Paglia says, total child abuse run by the Tavistock Institute, mind control division of MI6.
[02:39:52.535 --> 02:39:53.655]  You can't make that up.
[02:39:53.815 --> 02:39:54.956]  London Evening Standard.
[02:39:56.089 --> 02:39:59.772]  That's it, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:39:59.792 --> 02:40:00.772]  That's this week in the UK.
[02:40:00.792 --> 02:40:06.896]  That's this week in the... Sir, it's Australia, it's Canada, it's Scotland, it's Germany.
[02:40:06.936 --> 02:40:19.485]  Sir, here, they take children in to hotels at ballrooms, men walk out with nothing on except glitter on their genitals and then kiss the children on TV just to get everybody ready for it.
[02:40:19.565 --> 02:40:20.145]  That's all they're doing.
[02:40:20.165 --> 02:40:21.646]  It's like, look, they'll do what we want.
[02:40:21.866 --> 02:40:22.527]  We conquer you.
[02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:31.848]  It's like, I said 30 years ago, 30 years ago, this whole gender fluid argument would have been seen so, as a never, as a never.
[02:40:32.109 --> 02:40:36.609]  I think they're preparing, I think paedophilia, paedophilia in the next 20 years.
[02:40:36.629 --> 02:40:40.670]  This is, paedophilia's coming out, and a lot of folks are idiots and don't get it, but that's what this is.
[02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:43.951]  Quote, we're gonna teach two-year-olds how to be transgender.
[02:40:44.811 --> 02:40:48.191]  We're gonna teach boys and girls that you're not what your biology is.
[02:40:48.491 --> 02:40:51.552]  We, I mean, this is total sexualization, they're just doing it!
[02:40:52.708 --> 02:40:59.192]  We've got celebrities, Chris Evans, turning up on the red carpet and his son is wearing a dress.
[02:40:59.592 --> 02:41:02.554]  His six-year-old son is wearing a dress.
[02:41:02.574 --> 02:41:05.636]  And I think when a journalist asked him, why is your son in a dress?
[02:41:05.976 --> 02:41:07.697]  He said, it's not a dress, it's gender neutral.
[02:41:08.277 --> 02:41:10.659]  But see, they play these mind games.
[02:41:10.679 --> 02:41:14.141]  This is meant to destabilize civilization so they can commit all their crimes.
[02:41:14.161 --> 02:41:17.183]  But Harvey Weinstein and their whole program is going to fail, my brother.
[02:41:19.652 --> 02:41:25.057]  But isn't it funny how Islam says you can have sex with boys, but men can't have sex with men.
[02:41:25.077 --> 02:41:29.361]  So boys are for pleasure, women are for sex, according to Islam.
[02:41:29.582 --> 02:41:31.944]  Is that why it measures so well, is the pro-pedophile thing?
[02:41:33.476 --> 02:41:36.697]  There you go, Chris Evans wears Sunwears dress.
[02:41:37.137 --> 02:41:39.657]  You are playing with children's minds.
[02:41:40.038 --> 02:41:41.878]  You are confusing kids.
[02:41:43.778 --> 02:41:44.699]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:41:44.779 --> 02:41:47.999]  And it's like, these discussions should never be had with children.
[02:41:48.379 --> 02:41:50.600]  You are disturbing children.
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:51.460]  And do you know what?
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:56.861]  Armies of perverts have taken control of the schools and they use our open society to do it.
[02:41:56.901 --> 02:41:58.542]  They know just what they're doing.
[02:41:58.582 --> 02:41:59.142]  They're pervs.
[02:42:00.046 --> 02:42:08.388]  Do you know, I spoke to someone the other day who works at a real high-end private school, a really top private school, and she said, do you know the numbers in the private school?
[02:42:08.408 --> 02:42:13.809]  So obviously in our working class schools, this would still be rare, no kids coming in in a dress, I wouldn't have said so, yeah?
[02:42:14.149 --> 02:42:28.932]  When you get to the posh high-end society, their children are turning up, like she said, what they wear, they don't have to wear a uniform at this real high-end school, what they all come dressed in, half the boys are in dresses, half the boys are dressed in all silk, it's like,
[02:42:29.622 --> 02:42:30.303]  What are you creating?
[02:42:30.323 --> 02:42:31.503]  What are you doing?
[02:42:31.524 --> 02:42:37.308]  They're teaching men not to be assertive, and they're teaching women to be basket cases.
[02:42:37.388 --> 02:42:38.909]  It's how you bring civilization down.
[02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:40.290]  It's all declassified.
[02:42:40.611 --> 02:42:44.594]  Tommy Robinson, I want to get you back very, very soon from the front lines there.
[02:42:44.874 --> 02:42:49.578]  Congratulations on your best-selling books and all the work you're doing and what the Rebel's doing.
[02:42:49.978 --> 02:42:51.279]  Hold strong, hold fast.
[02:42:51.599 --> 02:42:52.700]  We're going to ring the alarm bell.
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:55.642]  It's always darker before the dawn, and I believe humanity is awakening.
[02:42:55.922 --> 02:42:57.704]  I know you do as well, so we'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[02:42:58.686 --> 02:42:59.046]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:59.066 --> 02:42:59.606]  Cheers, man.
[02:42:59.806 --> 02:43:02.307]  We'll be back with breaking news.
[02:43:03.448 --> 02:43:06.249]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:43:06.569 --> 02:43:13.852]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:43:14.012 --> 02:43:19.614]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:43:20.374 --> 02:43:27.725]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:43:28.085 --> 02:43:35.936]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:43:36.637 --> 02:43:41.242]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:43:41.702 --> 02:43:43.103]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:43:43.844 --> 02:43:56.877]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:57.237 --> 02:44:00.660]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:44:07.339 --> 02:44:11.309]  I'll tell you this, everything the globalist media pushes is more and more blowing up in their face.
[02:44:11.911 --> 02:44:14.658]  TrendsResearch.com, best-selling author, researcher.
[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:19.101]  Trends forecaster Gerald Cilente joins us for the hour.
[02:44:19.621 --> 02:44:23.302]  The bottom line is I want to get his worldview about where we are historically.
[02:44:23.482 --> 02:44:31.425]  And all over the world, from Austria to Brazil to Australia to the UK to here to Catalonia, people are fighting back for independence.
[02:44:31.465 --> 02:44:39.367]  I'd like to pick up what you're saying about globalism and the dangers of it and how it is really going in reverse in a lot of places.
[02:44:39.987 --> 02:44:42.389]  Except here in the United States.
[02:44:42.429 --> 02:44:44.091]  You mentioned what's going on in Austria.
[02:44:44.491 --> 02:44:52.038]  They just had an election last week and the Freedom Party came out of nowhere and now they're somewhere.
[02:44:52.559 --> 02:45:00.265]  You saw what happened in Germany a couple of weeks ago with Angela Merkel getting trounced by the AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland.
[02:45:00.926 --> 02:45:03.688]  You see the secessionist movement in Catalonia.
[02:45:04.858 --> 02:45:12.320]  And whether you like him or not, not our kind of guy because he's a Rothschild boy, Macron over in France, a new party.
[02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:17.201]  The point that I'm making is that they're very fearful and they're saying it.
[02:45:17.901 --> 02:45:27.584]  Here's a quote from Wolfgang Schwable, who was the former German finance minister until Merkel just got trounced.
[02:45:28.044 --> 02:45:30.145]  Here's what he warned the people about.
[02:45:30.165 --> 02:45:32.785]  I want everyone to listen very carefully.
[02:45:32.945 --> 02:45:38.487]  There's no chance Germany will ever relapse into nationalism.
[02:45:38.607 --> 02:45:52.351]  The AFD's voters, that's the alternative for Deutschland, voters were dissatisfied, felt excluded, were angry about perceived injustice and worried about how the world was changing.
[02:45:52.871 --> 02:45:56.636]  How dare we should relapse into nationalism?
[02:45:56.956 --> 02:46:05.907]  How dare those Germans want to hang on to their ethnicity, their culture, and their heritage?
[02:46:06.428 --> 02:46:10.133]  How dare the Italians, the French,
[02:46:11.235 --> 02:46:19.658]  The Americans or any other culture wants to hang on to what made them who they are.
[02:46:20.238 --> 02:46:30.221]  How dare they respect their ancestors and the cultural greatness that made them who they are when they should become globalized.
[02:46:30.721 --> 02:46:32.282]  This is the arrogance.
[02:46:32.842 --> 02:46:36.623]  The words that are being spoken, but being ignored.
[02:46:36.783 --> 02:46:49.868]  I mean, imagine saying, submit to an outside anti-liberal ideology, allied with a bunch of megabanks, with George Soros funding it, breathing down your neck, in some mass cuckolding of Europe.
[02:46:50.148 --> 02:46:56.670]  I mean, it's just crazy the arrogance of outside megabanks coming in, saying we're going to totally dominate you.
[02:47:05.094 --> 02:47:11.298]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.942 --> 02:47:20.623]  Alright, folks, we are back live.
[02:47:20.683 --> 02:47:21.864]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.284 --> 02:47:25.526]  Coming up, John Rappaport's going to host the fourth hour, then the War Room.
[02:47:25.967 --> 02:47:27.828]  Owen Schroer for three hours, coming up.
[02:47:28.148 --> 02:47:30.609]  Then back tomorrow morning, David Knight kicks it off, 8 a.m.
[02:47:30.649 --> 02:47:32.911]  Central, with The Real News with David Knight.
[02:47:33.936 --> 02:47:40.121]  Look, there's so much news I haven't gotten to, literally hundreds of important stories that are in newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:47:40.141 --> 02:47:40.541]  Look at this one.
[02:47:40.962 --> 02:47:45.245]  Polk claims global warming deniers embrace perverse attitudes.
[02:47:46.006 --> 02:47:48.388]  He also said conservatives are like poop eaters.
[02:47:49.088 --> 02:47:50.289]  Who even thinks of that?
[02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:58.616]  So holy that you talk about reportedly his favorite snack is, I guess it's from his own species, baboon poop.
[02:47:59.471 --> 02:48:00.472]  That's called satire.
[02:48:00.512 --> 02:48:02.894]  He's not as cool as a baboon, but he does eat baboon poop.
[02:48:03.394 --> 02:48:04.155]  Okay, I'm just joking.
[02:48:04.195 --> 02:48:08.278]  The point is, he does say that we love to eat poop, so I'm just going to talk about how he loves to eat poop.
[02:48:08.959 --> 02:48:10.320]  I mean, that's turnabout's fair play, right?
[02:48:11.061 --> 02:48:14.964]  Pope claims global warming deniers embrace perverse attitudes.
[02:48:15.704 --> 02:48:17.386]  Yes, if you deny that there's global warming.
[02:48:17.626 --> 02:48:21.429]  Hey, they already moved on to say climate change, and we believe climate change is happening.
[02:48:21.449 --> 02:48:26.593]  Just that paying carbon taxes to you, indulgences to you, won't save us, you false pope.
[02:48:30.799 --> 02:48:32.939]  Continuing, Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:48:32.999 --> 02:48:36.780]  Media goes insane after President of the United States drinks from a water bottle.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:38.801]  And for me, he wants a little drink.
[02:48:39.581 --> 02:48:40.981]  He doesn't want to spill it on himself.
[02:48:41.001 --> 02:48:42.522]  Trump is all about precision.
[02:48:43.342 --> 02:48:46.362]  He puts it up, closes his lips, slurps a quick drink.
[02:48:47.243 --> 02:48:48.723]  That's exactly how anybody would do it.
[02:48:48.743 --> 02:48:50.143]  Didn't want to spill it, just a little quick boom.
[02:48:50.763 --> 02:48:51.623]  Screws the top on.
[02:48:52.724 --> 02:48:53.864]  Does it very judiciously.
[02:48:55.748 --> 02:48:58.970]  Imagine how much he works without a teleprompter, how much he hits it out of the park.
[02:48:59.450 --> 02:49:07.134]  And then Trevor Noah and all these little losers that don't even write their own stuff for their teleprompters go, oh, Trump looks so weird when he drinks out of a bottle.
[02:49:07.154 --> 02:49:09.616]  Let me show you some of the quotes here.
[02:49:09.636 --> 02:49:11.557]  They're up on Infowars.com.
[02:49:12.017 --> 02:49:19.101]  And they just, everything he does, how he shakes hands or what he does, it's just, oh, it's so weird.
[02:49:19.862 --> 02:49:22.023]  It's so, and then like, I'm like, man, he's like a,
[02:49:23.069 --> 02:49:33.657]  Pit card guy, you know, the people, the stock car racing and the crew, the pit crew, like how well he just, boom, screws the top off, takes a quick drink and screws it on so well.
[02:49:33.737 --> 02:49:37.179]  I mean, half the time I dribble water on myself.
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:41.462]  But we've got, you know, little comments here by these actors.
[02:49:43.804 --> 02:49:45.765]  He's talking about bringing back jobs to America.
[02:49:45.785 --> 02:49:47.006]  He's drinking a bottle of water.
[02:49:47.026 --> 02:49:48.147]  Fiji, it's Fiji water.
[02:49:49.408 --> 02:49:50.629]  I drink a lot of water, often.
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:54.421]  I don't drink it often, but when I do, it looks weird.
[02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:57.002]  Hey, I'm sorry the economy's back.
[02:49:57.042 --> 02:50:00.744]  I'm sorry that there's a big tax cut just got passed in the House.
[02:50:01.964 --> 02:50:06.046]  I'm sure your Senate friends will try to kill it.
[02:50:07.967 --> 02:50:09.367]  But we're building our own ecosystem.
[02:50:10.067 --> 02:50:11.108]  We're building our own media.
[02:50:11.568 --> 02:50:14.389]  I see it as my job and the listeners' job if they join me in the quest.
[02:50:14.409 --> 02:50:14.889]  They have.
[02:50:15.350 --> 02:50:16.350]  That's what's so magic about it.
[02:50:16.390 --> 02:50:18.311]  Thank you for being on the same page.
[02:50:18.651 --> 02:50:19.291]  You're the power.
[02:50:19.751 --> 02:50:20.752]  That's not patronization.
[02:50:22.745 --> 02:50:24.566]  I think about you and I get chills up my spine.
[02:50:24.586 --> 02:50:25.307]  You're amazing.
[02:50:26.548 --> 02:50:27.429]  That's why they attack you.
[02:50:27.449 --> 02:50:28.489]  That's why they say you're scum.
[02:50:28.509 --> 02:50:29.570]  That's why they say you're dumb.
[02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:39.418]  Even though we have the Google demographics that our listeners are amongst the most informed and upper middle class, wealthy, down to blue collar, you name it, but the widest spectrum.
[02:50:40.422 --> 02:50:43.664]  Of racial and regional and cultural backgrounds.
[02:50:43.704 --> 02:50:45.866]  We have just an incredibly diverse audience.
[02:50:46.766 --> 02:50:49.688]  But statistically, we do have the wealthiest audience in talk radio.
[02:50:49.928 --> 02:50:52.310]  We also have the richest IP addresses tuning in.
[02:50:52.991 --> 02:50:54.291]  We ought to do a show on that and show people.
[02:50:54.832 --> 02:51:00.876]  But the elite's like, oh yeah, you don't really have the elite listening when they're all tuned in constantly and obsessed.
[02:51:00.896 --> 02:51:03.598]  The good elite, the bad elite, the elite financially, the elite
[02:51:04.238 --> 02:51:09.000]  Predators, the elite alpha maggots, the elite patriots, the elite in sports, the elite in business.
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:09.801]  I mean, they listen!
[02:51:10.201 --> 02:51:16.103]  Because, you know, we told you Al Franken was going to get in trouble 12 hours before everybody else did.
[02:51:17.684 --> 02:51:19.185]  Get tomorrow's news today.
[02:51:19.285 --> 02:51:20.445]  Get next week's news today.
[02:51:20.845 --> 02:51:22.466]  Get next year's news today.
[02:51:22.566 --> 02:51:24.467]  I mean, get 20 years from now today.
[02:51:25.247 --> 02:51:26.128]  We've proven it!
[02:51:26.728 --> 02:51:27.589]  Everybody knows it!
[02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:30.770]  And it's why they've got
[02:51:33.564 --> 02:51:36.587]  Big, giant attacks behind the scenes against us to shut us down.
[02:51:37.968 --> 02:51:43.734]  And it's why I'm asking all of you to pray for us, number one, because I know that's the determinative issue.
[02:51:44.074 --> 02:51:49.079]  I've seen the providence, and I know God's so real that I'm like a worm.
[02:51:49.099 --> 02:51:55.745]  A groveling, dirty, little, slimy, buck-toothed worm.
[02:51:56.746 --> 02:51:58.648]  But I love God, and I'm not out to get you.
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:06.663]  In the presence of God, it's like... And I am in the presence of God.
[02:52:06.703 --> 02:52:08.724]  I mean, there's no... Let me tell you, I got a relationship with God.
[02:52:09.124 --> 02:52:10.605]  I'm dialed in 24-7.
[02:52:11.826 --> 02:52:12.927]  Most people have a religious experience.
[02:52:12.967 --> 02:52:14.248]  Five seconds, they can't even handle it.
[02:52:14.308 --> 02:52:16.489]  I'm jacked into the high voltage, okay?
[02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.750]  I'm jacked in.
[02:52:19.651 --> 02:52:26.275]  And it's something else, but... When you're jacked into God, you realize how bad you are.
[02:52:26.515 --> 02:52:27.996]  And it's not like some beat myself on the head.
[02:52:28.036 --> 02:52:30.978]  I'm just saying, the humbleness of it,
[02:52:32.113 --> 02:52:48.000]  And I just wish all these people who think they're part of the power structure could really have a moment with God, a moment of opening their heart, not being so arrogant, and just say, God, just show me, just give me the discernment, just show me a little bit, and you're gonna be like, whoa, wow, that's amazing, yeah!
[02:52:48.500 --> 02:52:55.343]  Then sell out to the New World Order for a big mansion with a bunch of empty vampires around me, a big prison?
[02:52:57.644 --> 02:52:59.105]  And all I wanna do is somehow
[02:53:01.431 --> 02:53:17.360]  I mean, I even feel guilty wanting to be close to God, because I can feel God's presence, and I love God, and then you get just a tiny bit of the reflection of God on you, and just a little bit of God's intellect, and it's like, I can't even believe this.
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:20.742]  I cannot even believe people would join Satan.
[02:53:21.922 --> 02:53:30.267]  I just, I cannot even imagine how embarrassed I am in the presence of God.
[02:53:36.565 --> 02:53:37.445]  It's incredible.
[02:53:38.466 --> 02:53:45.628]  And just to realize the wicked does several things but they're completely wicked and don't care.
[02:53:46.028 --> 02:53:59.211]  They know we care and have a conscience so they attack us with darts how we're evil and how we did bad to freak us out and then we haven't done something and they hit us with a big lie like all these men they accuse of raping women that isn't true they go commit suicide.
[02:54:01.392 --> 02:54:01.952]  Don't do that.
[02:54:02.012 --> 02:54:03.032]  Stand up and say it's wrong.
[02:54:03.713 --> 02:54:04.933]  Stand up and fight back but see
[02:54:08.106 --> 02:54:09.248]  You have to engage evil.
[02:54:10.751 --> 02:54:11.392]  You have to do it.
[02:54:12.374 --> 02:54:13.015]  Or there's no hope.
[02:54:14.618 --> 02:54:18.285]  And all these people that are cut off from God by their own actions...
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:25.866]  Cut off from just, people say, Jones is new agey when he says, tune into the universe, tune into God.
[02:54:26.026 --> 02:54:27.327]  God made the universe.
[02:54:28.048 --> 02:54:30.570]  God is the universe and more and beyond that.
[02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:39.759]  But the point is, I'm just saying, transcend the globalists and their red carpets and crap, and look at the night sky, look at the moon, look at the creation, look at the wind, the smell of the flowers, all of it.
[02:54:39.779 --> 02:54:43.323]  It's like, that's God manifesting through art.
[02:54:45.785 --> 02:54:52.131]  And just realize that you know God's there, and you know the enemy has fallen, and you don't have to be afraid anymore.
[02:54:52.151 --> 02:54:58.716]  The only thing you've got to be afraid of is not being with God.
[02:54:58.956 --> 02:55:07.003]  And if you turn yourself over to God, you're not going to be at some church posing how high and mighty you are for everybody.
[02:55:08.525 --> 02:55:09.906]  You're going to be trying to engage evil.
[02:55:11.547 --> 02:55:13.389]  You're going to ever be seeking it out to destroy it.
[02:55:14.944 --> 02:55:34.254]  Ever moving against it, ever obsessed with exposing it, and ever frustrated that you can't do better because there's such a great example, God right there, that you feel like you're not doing a good enough job because you want to not impress God, you want to get to where God is.
[02:55:34.334 --> 02:55:40.518]  You want to get closer to God, but then you see how bad you are, and then you see the really evil people, and it's like, is that a joke?
[02:55:41.584 --> 02:55:44.485]  You want to kidnap kids and torture them to death?
[02:55:44.525 --> 02:55:48.307]  You're like, you don't even blame God if he blows the whole planet up.
[02:55:48.327 --> 02:55:51.628]  You're just like, but I, I hope we can fix it because I got children.
[02:55:51.648 --> 02:55:55.330]  But then I just go, whatever you got to do.
[02:55:55.350 --> 02:56:02.873]  You come to that point, you come to that point where you're just like, I'm conscious.
[02:56:02.893 --> 02:56:03.793]  I was given all this.
[02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:05.254]  I'm not asking God for anything.
[02:56:06.428 --> 02:56:08.190]  I cannot even ask God for things.
[02:56:08.490 --> 02:56:10.292]  I try to pray and ask for things.
[02:56:10.972 --> 02:56:12.554]  And when I start praying, I get even closer to God.
[02:56:12.614 --> 02:56:18.179]  I'm like, whoa, I can't even ask.
[02:56:22.363 --> 02:56:24.465]  And God says, stop worrying about what the enemy says.
[02:56:24.925 --> 02:56:25.906]  Stop being worldly.
[02:56:26.067 --> 02:56:26.487]  Attack.
[02:56:26.867 --> 02:56:27.428]  Expose them.
[02:56:27.968 --> 02:56:28.689]  Defend the children.
[02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:29.210]  Attack.
[02:56:29.550 --> 02:56:29.910]  Attack.
[02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.511]  Attack.
[02:56:30.691 --> 02:56:31.071]  Attack.
[02:56:31.231 --> 02:56:31.532]  Attack.
[02:56:34.141 --> 02:56:40.607]  But I have prayed for decades that God would, like, cleanse me of my evil and just empower me to take on the enemy.
[02:56:40.748 --> 02:56:42.990]  And the crazy part is, it's happening.
[02:56:43.791 --> 02:56:46.854]  That's what's so amazing, is that this is real.
[02:56:47.554 --> 02:56:49.016]  This isn't some simulation.
[02:56:49.036 --> 02:56:50.117]  This isn't some game.
[02:56:50.678 --> 02:56:51.378]  This is real.
[02:56:51.458 --> 02:56:53.160]  God is all-powerful!
[02:56:53.540 --> 02:56:54.441]  God is real!
[02:56:55.461 --> 02:56:58.202]  And the sadists and the satanists tell you, well then he's a sadist!
[02:56:59.023 --> 02:57:00.563]  Because he did all this bad!
[02:57:00.863 --> 02:57:04.105]  God didn't do anything but give us free will!
[02:57:05.225 --> 02:57:06.966]  That's respect God gave us!
[02:57:11.148 --> 02:57:14.730]  God gave Lucifer free will as a test.
[02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:17.891]  And Lucifer turned against him, just like that.
[02:57:20.452 --> 02:57:23.734]  And played games with the other entities to manipulate them.
[02:57:25.783 --> 02:57:28.745]  Until they said, we'll create our own dimension.
[02:57:29.165 --> 02:57:29.586]  And you know what?
[02:57:29.606 --> 02:57:30.726]  Your dimension sucks.
[02:57:32.327 --> 02:57:33.988]  So you go be part of your dimension.
[02:57:34.429 --> 02:57:35.549]  I want this dimension.
[02:57:37.130 --> 02:57:45.536]  And quite frankly, I just want to get wind up to take as many people as I can to that dimension.
[02:57:45.916 --> 02:57:47.137]  You going to take people where you're going?
[02:57:47.837 --> 02:57:49.459]  I want out of this one away from you.
[02:57:52.722 --> 02:57:54.104]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:57:54.124 --> 02:57:55.244]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:57:55.485 --> 02:57:56.425]  Why is this so good?
[02:57:56.706 --> 02:58:01.950]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:58:02.030 --> 02:58:15.580]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:17.022]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:58:17.922 --> 02:58:19.383]  Spreading disease around.
[02:58:19.443 --> 02:58:21.946]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:58:22.026 --> 02:58:23.287]  These are all parasites.
[02:58:23.327 --> 02:58:24.428]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:58:24.448 --> 02:58:25.488]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:58:25.789 --> 02:58:30.132]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:58:30.332 --> 02:58:33.495]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:58:33.615 --> 02:58:36.658]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:58:36.678 --> 02:58:37.679]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:58:37.739 --> 02:58:39.621]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:39.701 --> 02:58:40.722]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:58:41.002 --> 02:58:42.804]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:58:43.425 --> 02:58:46.447]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:46.728 --> 02:58:48.610]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:50.952]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:58:53.194 --> 02:58:58.077]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[02:58:58.878 --> 02:59:01.820]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:05.282]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[02:59:05.903 --> 02:59:10.786]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[02:59:11.146 --> 02:59:17.450]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[02:59:17.810 --> 02:59:22.934]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[02:59:23.634 --> 02:59:27.075]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[02:59:27.636 --> 02:59:35.458]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.

[02:59:49.003 --> 02:59:50.704]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:57.628 --> 03:00:17.215]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:17.755 --> 03:00:19.276]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:20.603 --> 03:00:23.964]  Well, he didn't shake hands with a disabled little boy.
[03:00:23.984 --> 03:00:25.744]  He didn't feed the carb right.
[03:00:25.984 --> 03:00:27.485]  Now he drank out of a bottle wrong.
[03:00:28.905 --> 03:00:29.745]  That's all they got.
[03:00:30.906 --> 03:00:38.648]  Ridicule for their mindless masses that still buy into the New World Order to think that they're all part of the winning club and they're making fun of somebody.
[03:00:40.248 --> 03:00:41.209]  They always make fun of me.
[03:00:41.449 --> 03:00:44.369]  And I'm just like, great, could you at least really make fun of me?
[03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:46.250]  I mean, there's a lot to make fun of.
[03:00:48.635 --> 03:00:51.378]  By the way, Trump, behind the scenes, loves to make fun of himself.
[03:00:51.798 --> 03:00:53.760]  I'm sure he watches the video.
[03:00:54.341 --> 03:00:58.044]  I mean, he's being very judicious, getting a little sip, you know, just making sure he doesn't spill it.
[03:01:01.828 --> 03:01:02.448]  What is there?
[03:01:03.309 --> 03:01:08.735]  But that just shows, meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocent-looking bookstore,
[03:01:10.182 --> 03:01:12.483]  The story just went up on Infowars.com, Clifford Cunningham.
[03:01:13.023 --> 03:01:18.346]  CNN calls unborn child a special interest group, equating them with citrus farmers.
[03:01:18.406 --> 03:01:19.807]  Well, you are human resources.
[03:01:20.367 --> 03:01:23.709]  That's how the globalists want you to think about everybody, so nobody sticks together.
[03:01:27.811 --> 03:01:29.832]  You know, here's the big news I didn't get to.
[03:01:29.852 --> 03:01:35.955]  And then we got the great John Rappaport coming up.
[03:01:37.850 --> 03:01:47.532]  Black death plague ravaging Madagascar will get worse as antibiotics aren't working.
[03:01:49.492 --> 03:01:50.172]  And let's look at it.
[03:01:51.372 --> 03:01:56.873]  The dreaded black plague blighting Madagascar will get worse before it gets better.
[03:01:57.433 --> 03:02:06.115]  If antibiotics aren't handed out quickly, as scientists told the Daily Star, and they go on to say the antibiotics aren't working, 2,000 have been struck down, 165 dead,
[03:02:10.202 --> 03:02:12.384]  The mnemonic plague, bubonic plague.
[03:02:16.007 --> 03:02:18.669]  The medieval disease is back and it's drug resistant.
[03:02:19.349 --> 03:02:28.577]  I mean, we should be talking about that instead of Al Franken grabbing on women.
[03:02:28.817 --> 03:02:29.738]  And of course he did it.
[03:02:30.178 --> 03:02:30.899]  And of course he's horrible.
[03:02:30.919 --> 03:02:32.160]  I'm not saying don't cover it.
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:34.962]  I'm just like, it's so weird to me.
[03:02:40.006 --> 03:02:51.250]  Guys that are trying to get women in this ham-fisted thing of like... Just mindlessly... First off, do you have a boyfriend or a husband?
[03:02:51.890 --> 03:02:52.890]  Oh, what are you interested in?
[03:02:53.010 --> 03:02:53.951]  Oh, let's tell some jokes.
[03:02:53.991 --> 03:02:54.971]  Let's have some fun.
[03:02:55.671 --> 03:02:58.352]  You don't get them just running up in the dark and grabbing them.
[03:03:00.066 --> 03:03:05.327]  And it's that arrested development that tells you everything you need to know about these guys.
[03:03:05.927 --> 03:03:17.849]  It's like Harvey Weinstein wants the women to watch him play with himself in the shower and rub on his big fat bolts and clean his butt crack.
[03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:23.551]  He just wants a super sexy model to be grossed out by him.
[03:03:24.411 --> 03:03:25.571]  That's what turns him on.
[03:03:27.850 --> 03:03:31.191]  So, remember, you ask, why do they want ugliness?
[03:03:31.211 --> 03:03:32.531]  Why do they want to destroy civilization?
[03:03:32.871 --> 03:03:39.353]  Why do they want Islamists coming into the country and doing all of this and cutting women's vaginas off and everything else?
[03:03:41.474 --> 03:03:44.055]  Because that's beautiful to a psychopath.
[03:03:44.335 --> 03:03:45.335]  I saw the article today.
[03:03:47.095 --> 03:03:54.057]  A canvas painted in ketchup that probably took 30 seconds, sold for $50 million.
[03:03:54.978 --> 03:03:55.798]  Now, why is that?
[03:03:56.874 --> 03:04:09.916]  Because the big mega bankers want to give a tithe to a bucket of horse manure or crucifix in a brandy glass of urine to say, you're all starving to death, you all have nothing.
[03:04:10.516 --> 03:04:14.317]  I'm going to say, ketchup on canvas is worth $50 million.
[03:04:16.778 --> 03:04:24.899]  Because it energetically, interdimensionally, wastes so much money on something so simple, so stupid that a three-year-old would do.
[03:04:28.547 --> 03:04:37.559]  That they're telling you what's beautiful and what's valuable and what's thought-provoking sells way more than a Rembrandt or a Vincent Van Gogh.
[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:42.065]  And the CIA declassified that they do it to make you stupid.
[03:04:43.306 --> 03:04:43.526]  See?
[03:04:46.721 --> 03:04:47.521]  So they know what they're doing.
[03:04:47.541 --> 03:04:51.563]  I'm gonna come in and introduce John Rappaport straight ahead, but that is a religious deal.
[03:04:51.883 --> 03:05:01.088]  You know, where some brokerage firm owner, a bunch of swindled money or whatever, you know, goes and whoever buys some skull with semen on top of it, and it's all just supposed to be so beautiful.
[03:05:01.128 --> 03:05:01.828]  No, it's all a joke.
[03:05:03.223 --> 03:05:07.425]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[03:06:15.758 --> 03:06:16.620]  You found it.
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:18.482]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:18.963 --> 03:06:21.567]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:21.587 --> 03:06:24.672]  Alright folks, John Rappaport.
[03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:32.211]  He has taken over here in just a few minutes.
[03:06:32.931 --> 03:06:36.793]  A lot of big news, obviously, he's going to be covering and decoding for us.
[03:06:36.833 --> 03:06:39.555]  But just first off, I didn't really plug last hour.
[03:06:39.615 --> 03:06:45.338]  I got so caught up in all the news I was covering, but Tommy Robinson was so busy promoting his new show and the great work he's doing.
[03:06:45.358 --> 03:06:50.400]  That's our job as a platform for other patriots, just so we can all synergistically move forward and tell the truth.
[03:06:50.941 --> 03:06:52.722]  That didn't tell you about the new specials.
[03:06:53.962 --> 03:06:56.163]  We had 14 items for sale at 50% off.
[03:06:57.902 --> 03:07:11.111]  Uh, we had apparel, so technically there was like 70-something shirts, 60-something shirts, that were 50% off, so I guess more than that, but we had 14 different specials going, and they all got close to selling out or sold out, so we pulled all those.
[03:07:12.068 --> 03:07:13.390]  Super Mel Vitality, you name it.
[03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:22.000]  But we're extending the free shipping and have added it to some of the items that were not there, but that's going to end this weekend.
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:24.603]  Find those items at InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:07:25.064 --> 03:07:27.687]  I'll be honest with you, I got so busy.
[03:07:28.871 --> 03:07:35.120]  Working on news today and other things that I didn't look at the other stuff that they've put on special, but I've got a sheet here.
[03:07:35.521 --> 03:07:38.265]  Z-Shield, the heavy metal detoxifier that's close to selling out.
[03:07:38.565 --> 03:07:39.927]  That's amazing for you and your family.
[03:07:40.208 --> 03:07:42.010]  That's 50% off and there's free shipping.
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:43.500]  I think so.
[03:08:07.392 --> 03:08:09.233]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, 5% off.
[03:08:09.773 --> 03:08:11.874]  DNA Force Back-to-Stock, 25% off.
[03:08:12.054 --> 03:08:13.755]  All of it, store-wide free shipping.
[03:08:14.075 --> 03:08:17.596]  Secret 12, and it's gotta end, 50% off with free shipping.
[03:08:21.038 --> 03:08:26.240]  So that's all at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:34.484]  Now, we've come out working with the largest high-quality organic producer of probiotics in the country.
[03:08:35.865 --> 03:08:49.171]  We've come out with the extremely affordable, and I've got the printout sheet right here, extremely affordable Floralife that is super high quality, everyday maintenance, 15 billion live probiotics.
[03:08:50.714 --> 03:08:52.676]  For you at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:08:52.976 --> 03:08:57.681]  No reviews yet, just came out.
[03:08:57.921 --> 03:08:57.681]  $26.75.
[03:08:57.941 --> 03:09:01.124]  $39.95, it's a great deal, but it's $26.75.
[03:09:01.865 --> 03:09:04.448]  I mean, this is very expensive to make.
[03:09:04.508 --> 03:09:06.530]  We could do a probiotic for $2 a bottle.
[03:09:07.251 --> 03:09:12.956]  Let me tell you right now, we're putting $20 a bottle in just one of the new ones we've come out with.
[03:09:13.437 --> 03:09:14.438]  So, Floralife.
[03:09:16.333 --> 03:09:16.573]  33% off.
[03:09:17.134 --> 03:09:20.077]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[03:09:20.097 --> 03:09:22.199]  That's $15 billion.
[03:09:22.899 --> 03:09:27.304]  Then we've got, and by the way, the way they make it, you do it at the FDA, you gotta put like double in it.
[03:09:27.584 --> 03:09:31.628]  So if they test it in a year, there's $50 billion or $15 billion, whatever you're saying on the label.
[03:09:31.888 --> 03:09:32.949]  It's more than that.
[03:09:33.009 --> 03:09:34.711]  But, you know, currently when you get it.
[03:09:35.131 --> 03:09:38.395]  But then if you ship it and it gets hot or something, you know, they've got a metric, wherever.
[03:09:40.086 --> 03:09:41.368]  We're putting $100 billion in these babies.
[03:09:42.208 --> 03:09:47.354]  But you can't say, technically, we're going to say $50 billion on the bottle because, you know, they test it in here, that's what will be there.
[03:09:48.476 --> 03:09:48.876]  Life.
[03:09:49.817 --> 03:09:51.739]  Floral Life Advanced Restoration.
[03:09:51.759 --> 03:09:53.662]  $50 billion in live probiotics.
[03:09:55.143 --> 03:09:56.444]  And this is just such high quality.
[03:09:56.464 --> 03:10:00.266]  And we have the vegan style ones from Dr. Group.
[03:10:00.306 --> 03:10:01.246]  It's excellent as well.
[03:10:01.647 --> 03:10:02.647]  Probiotic, biome defense.
[03:10:02.667 --> 03:10:03.688]  That's their folks who want vegan.
[03:10:03.908 --> 03:10:04.828]  Rolls Royce quality.
[03:10:05.068 --> 03:10:06.129]  Really great the way he does it.
[03:10:06.969 --> 03:10:08.930]  So we've got just expanding our whole area.
[03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:10.231]  But here's what I'm really excited about.
[03:10:11.832 --> 03:10:12.232]  Carnivore.
[03:10:12.252 --> 03:10:13.853]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[03:10:14.333 --> 03:10:15.214]  All very affordable.
[03:10:15.234 --> 03:10:15.534]  33% off.
[03:10:15.554 --> 03:10:15.934]  Out of the gates.
[03:10:18.547 --> 03:10:20.089]  That's less than $20 for a small bottle.
[03:10:20.850 --> 03:10:21.991]  Because I want you to see how great it is.
[03:10:22.452 --> 03:10:23.713]  You don't digest most of the meat.
[03:10:23.753 --> 03:10:25.195]  You lose the enzymes as you get older.
[03:10:25.515 --> 03:10:26.837]  It's good for fat.
[03:10:26.957 --> 03:10:28.379]  It's good for eating up the fat.
[03:10:28.419 --> 03:10:30.241]  It's good for going after the carbohydrates.
[03:10:30.341 --> 03:10:33.365]  It's just... Man, I used to eat a big steak and didn't feel tired.
[03:10:33.405 --> 03:10:34.226]  I ate one now, I get tired.
[03:10:34.246 --> 03:10:34.847]  Start taking this.
[03:10:35.407 --> 03:10:36.668]  Boom, ate a big ribeye, boom.
[03:10:36.688 --> 03:10:37.788]  Eat two of these, eat one of these.
[03:10:38.348 --> 03:10:39.008]  It's incredible.
[03:10:39.048 --> 03:10:39.969]  Digest it better.
[03:10:40.129 --> 03:10:41.089]  Aren't tired the next day.
[03:10:41.149 --> 03:10:42.430]  Don't get heartburn, don't get a stomachache.
[03:10:42.670 --> 03:10:46.551]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive enzyme.
[03:10:47.031 --> 03:10:49.372]  Better digestion, you know, all this stuff.
[03:10:49.632 --> 03:10:52.433]  So Carnivore is next level.
[03:10:52.533 --> 03:10:59.076]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, it's the big umbrella site, but infowarslife.com takes you right to it.
[03:10:59.356 --> 03:11:00.016]  Carnivore
[03:11:01.135 --> 03:11:04.800]  And then, of course, we've got Floralife Advanced Restoration, $50 billion.
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:09.848]  And then we've got, also, again, we've got the everyday maintenance, Floralife.
[03:11:11.350 --> 03:11:14.535]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139, and ZShield.
[03:11:18.496 --> 03:11:19.336]  Never done this before.
[03:11:19.356 --> 03:11:20.397]  50% off.
[03:11:20.657 --> 03:11:23.418]  But these kind of discounts, we just sell a lot of this.
[03:11:23.879 --> 03:11:24.899]  So I'm believing in you.
[03:11:25.179 --> 03:11:25.720]  Win-win.
[03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:30.062]  Get water filtration, air filtration, books, videos, t-shirts.
[03:11:30.082 --> 03:11:33.043]  We've got the new Don't Tread On Me, Gadsden Flag shirt.
[03:11:33.063 --> 03:11:34.344]  I think it's the best we've ever produced.
[03:11:35.144 --> 03:11:35.925]  That's available.
[03:11:36.406 --> 03:11:37.707]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:11:37.767 --> 03:11:38.628]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:11:38.648 --> 03:11:40.590]  But just try Carnivore.
[03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:41.952]  Just try Floral Life.
[03:11:42.713 --> 03:11:44.154]  Just try X2.
[03:11:44.234 --> 03:11:45.155]  Just try Secret 12.
[03:11:45.756 --> 03:11:47.298]  Just try Oxy Powder.
[03:11:47.698 --> 03:11:51.722]  Just try these great products and see what they do for you!
[03:11:52.844 --> 03:11:53.744]  But we do our research.
[03:11:54.104 --> 03:11:59.385]  We go out and private label the very best stuff out there, or we go out with top firms and develop the latest cutting-edge high-quality.
[03:11:59.825 --> 03:12:03.446]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:12:03.926 --> 03:12:08.167]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is all something that you've built.
[03:12:08.527 --> 03:12:17.989]  All right, let me hand over the baton for the next 50 minutes to John Rapoport of nomorefakenews.com to decipher all the latest big developments, and then
[03:12:19.214 --> 03:12:22.437]  49, 48 minutes from now, Owen Shroyer in the War Room takes over.
[03:12:22.757 --> 03:12:24.098]  John Rappaport, thanks for being here.
[03:12:25.019 --> 03:12:25.879]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:27.921]  Great to be here as always, folks.
[03:12:29.822 --> 03:12:34.226]  Let's start off here with law and order.
[03:12:36.187 --> 03:12:44.694]  I'm sure that like me for many, many years, you've seen situations where people are arrested for heinous crimes.
[03:12:46.715 --> 03:12:48.497]  They're put on trial, they're convicted.
[03:12:50.407 --> 03:12:53.009]  And then they're out.
[03:12:54.370 --> 03:12:55.271]  Yeah, they're out.
[03:12:56.532 --> 03:13:01.597]  A while later, not very long, you read about them committing some other crime.
[03:13:03.218 --> 03:13:08.122]  Well, so-and-so was on parole and he committed another heinous crime.
[03:13:10.864 --> 03:13:14.347]  But the media, of course, don't really look into this.
[03:13:14.888 --> 03:13:18.571]  They don't try to figure out or criticize
[03:13:19.713 --> 03:13:24.376]  The system, except when it goes overboard in the other direction.
[03:13:25.497 --> 03:13:33.022]  That is, somebody with two strikes against them steals a candy bar from a liquor store and now they're in jail for 50 years.
[03:13:34.022 --> 03:13:34.843]  Yeah, we get that.
[03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:35.723]  We understand that.
[03:13:35.924 --> 03:13:36.084]  Yeah.
[03:13:36.544 --> 03:13:36.764]  Mm-hmm.
[03:13:37.945 --> 03:13:38.165]  Right.
[03:13:41.127 --> 03:13:45.149]  But, take Ryan Paul.
[03:13:45.730 --> 03:13:47.331]  Senator Rand Paul, okay?
[03:13:49.204 --> 03:14:12.849]  Now, this guy that attacked Rand Paul on his lawn, first of all, if we believe what the press reports are telling us, he's out there cutting the grass or watering his lawn or whatever, Senator Paul, and this neighbor of his comes onto his property, sneaks onto his property.
[03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:16.910]  This is already criminal trespass, okay?
[03:14:18.946 --> 03:14:20.687]  Runs at him and attacks him.
[03:14:20.907 --> 03:14:22.568]  Sneak attack from behind.
[03:14:25.249 --> 03:14:25.969]  No warning.
[03:14:26.369 --> 03:14:26.770]  Nothing.
[03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:28.831]  Apparently.
[03:14:31.592 --> 03:14:32.952]  Breaks six ribs.
[03:14:34.273 --> 03:14:36.274]  And he's got fluid in his lungs.
[03:14:39.215 --> 03:14:47.559]  He's being charged in Kentucky with a fourth degree misdemeanor.
[03:14:48.706 --> 03:14:49.906]  That's the current charge.
[03:14:51.407 --> 03:14:56.749]  Which is the lowest form of misdemeanor on the books in the state of Kentucky.
[03:14:59.790 --> 03:15:03.031]  I mean, you know, it boggles the mind.
[03:15:04.731 --> 03:15:12.374]  Now, what are the punishments if convicted for a fourth degree misdemeanor in Kentucky?
[03:15:13.754 --> 03:15:14.855]  A max of $500 fine.
[03:15:17.230 --> 03:15:24.116]  And one year in jail max usually just gets, you know, lowered.
[03:15:27.339 --> 03:15:34.585]  Now, we got this thing called moral outrage here.
[03:15:35.766 --> 03:15:42.712]  That's what's really underneath this in the mind, the heart, the soul of any
[03:15:43.664 --> 03:15:50.325]  Honorable honest person when they hear this and we will discuss After the break so stay with us here
[03:16:01.923 --> 03:16:04.106]  We confirm suspicions, Ed Veritas.
[03:16:04.166 --> 03:16:10.374]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:16:10.775 --> 03:16:13.479]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:16:13.699 --> 03:16:18.005]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:16:18.405 --> 03:16:37.852]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYCTerroristAttack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline,
[03:16:39.557 --> 03:16:42.080]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[03:16:42.140 --> 03:16:43.841]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:16:44.041 --> 03:16:53.871]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:16:54.231 --> 03:16:58.175]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[03:16:59.628 --> 03:17:01.509]  This information being weaponized.
[03:17:01.589 --> 03:17:03.829]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:17:04.269 --> 03:17:08.791]  He actually went on Jones' show and said... Your reputation's amazing.
[03:17:09.291 --> 03:17:10.631]  I will not let you down.
[03:17:10.791 --> 03:17:13.692]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:17:14.112 --> 03:17:21.635]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[03:17:22.841 --> 03:17:30.325]  We know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[03:17:30.765 --> 03:17:37.008]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[03:17:37.628 --> 03:17:39.509]  You have RT, you have Sputnik.
[03:17:40.169 --> 03:17:46.751]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[03:17:47.851 --> 03:17:50.392]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[03:17:50.732 --> 03:17:51.832]  The system self-corrected.
[03:17:51.952 --> 03:17:54.793]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:17:54.813 --> 03:17:57.054]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:17:58.254 --> 03:17:59.034]  But you saw this?
[03:17:59.254 --> 03:17:59.995]  USA Today.
[03:18:00.415 --> 03:18:01.495]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:18:01.675 --> 03:18:04.056]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:18:04.096 --> 03:18:05.256]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:18:05.436 --> 03:18:07.017]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:18:07.057 --> 03:18:08.878]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:18:08.898 --> 03:18:16.524]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him, and manually have to find that video.
[03:18:16.544 --> 03:18:21.987]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[03:18:25.129 --> 03:18:29.092]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:18:30.173 --> 03:18:31.374]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:18:32.608 --> 03:18:35.390]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[03:18:36.311 --> 03:18:48.319]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone, because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[03:18:50.350 --> 03:18:56.215]  Super blue, colloidal silver, fluoride-free mouthwash, 50% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion, still 50% off.
[03:18:56.535 --> 03:18:59.358]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[03:18:59.378 --> 03:19:01.480]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[03:19:02.060 --> 03:19:03.501]  That's 50% off as well.
[03:19:03.721 --> 03:19:05.243]  Free shipping, it's got to end.
[03:19:05.623 --> 03:19:09.086]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[03:19:09.366 --> 03:19:11.088]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.
[03:19:11.148 --> 03:19:14.671]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our bestseller, that I personally wear
[03:19:15.151 --> 03:19:17.233]  Around town now, it's my favorite shirt of all time.
[03:19:17.413 --> 03:19:23.979]  It says, Won't Tread on Me, InfoWars.com on the right-hand shoulder of the American flag, InfoWars.com on the back.
[03:19:24.659 --> 03:19:28.002]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[03:19:28.323 --> 03:19:39.633]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake, very iconic, with InfoWars.com in Dayglo yellow on the back, and InfoWars.com with the American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[03:19:39.693 --> 03:19:40.653]  We also have InfoWars
[03:19:41.474 --> 03:19:43.675]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:25.011 --> 03:20:27.152]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:27.672 --> 03:20:29.532]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:29.972 --> 03:20:32.613]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:20:32.633 --> 03:20:43.715]  Rappaport back here in the fourth hour, talking about Rand Paul and the sense of moral outrage.
[03:20:44.135 --> 03:20:46.755]  You know, people just become apathetic after a while.
[03:20:47.455 --> 03:20:50.036]  Well, this guy, you know, took half
[03:20:51.437 --> 03:20:54.759]  Somebody's arm off and a leg and they got six months.
[03:20:54.799 --> 03:20:55.160]  What?
[03:20:56.881 --> 03:21:00.063]  Well, here's a situation in progress right now.
[03:21:01.284 --> 03:21:04.086]  Let's see what happens when all the information comes out.
[03:21:04.766 --> 03:21:15.433]  But this attacker who put Rand Paul in the hospital with six broken ribs and fluid in his lungs is now being charged with a fourth degree misdemeanor.
[03:21:15.453 --> 03:21:15.513]  Top
[03:21:18.627 --> 03:21:22.728]  Punishment for that would be a $500 fine and a year in jail.
[03:21:23.608 --> 03:21:28.770]  That's the lowest misdemeanor charge possible in the state of Kentucky.
[03:21:29.930 --> 03:21:30.470]  Why is that?
[03:21:32.090 --> 03:21:33.011]  Where does that come from?
[03:21:34.531 --> 03:21:35.611]  Who decided?
[03:21:37.192 --> 03:21:39.072]  And I'll tell you exactly what's happening.
[03:21:40.953 --> 03:21:46.794]  The whole point of destroying a country and therefore putting it into the globalist camp
[03:21:47.817 --> 03:21:53.840]  Of helpless, chaotic, out-of-control nations, which is the bottom line here.
[03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:55.000]  Understand that.
[03:21:57.961 --> 03:22:05.124]  The whole point of the law is to pervert and destroy any semblance of sanity in the law.
[03:22:06.765 --> 03:22:17.129]  And one of the best ways to undermine that sanity is to take people who have committed serious felonies and say, oh no,
[03:22:18.183 --> 03:22:21.004]  No, this is just, you know, this is just an everyday thing.
[03:22:21.624 --> 03:22:28.565]  I mean, people run onto each other's lawns all the time and smash each other in the back and put them in the hospital, right?
[03:22:28.685 --> 03:22:30.786]  I mean, it's just a little thing.
[03:22:31.346 --> 03:22:33.087]  It's certainly not a mass shooting.
[03:22:34.227 --> 03:22:39.848]  It's certainly not a bombing or somebody driving a car killing 100 people.
[03:22:42.069 --> 03:22:43.469]  So that's on the other side.
[03:22:44.238 --> 03:22:57.821]  The population is mesmerized by these mass incidents so that when something happens to an individual, an individual human being... Oh, well, who cares?
[03:22:58.461 --> 03:22:58.861]  Who cares?
[03:22:58.961 --> 03:23:01.862]  Yeah, I mean, it's... Alright, so I put him in the hospital.
[03:23:02.002 --> 03:23:04.062]  I give him, I don't know, three months in jail.
[03:23:05.602 --> 03:23:06.023]  What?
[03:23:07.983 --> 03:23:12.484]  I can tell you there was a time, many moons ago,
[03:23:13.809 --> 03:23:14.929]  When that was not the case.
[03:23:15.989 --> 03:23:26.151]  And the reason was because the plethora of crimes and criminal activity was not nearly as great as it is now.
[03:23:28.072 --> 03:23:32.932]  So I understand when people rail against the legal system and say innocent people are being put in jail.
[03:23:32.972 --> 03:23:34.433]  Yeah, they are.
[03:23:35.593 --> 03:23:37.953]  And their assets are being forfeited.
[03:23:38.013 --> 03:23:39.534]  Yeah, illegally.
[03:23:39.634 --> 03:23:41.814]  Yeah, without even being charged for crime.
[03:23:42.529 --> 03:23:44.070]  But that's not what I'm talking about here.
[03:23:45.671 --> 03:23:51.815]  You don't just lump all of it together and say it's all insane and you know.
[03:23:52.115 --> 03:23:52.296]  No.
[03:23:54.057 --> 03:23:54.577]  Use your head.
[03:23:57.419 --> 03:24:02.122]  Specific serious crimes go unpunished.
[03:24:04.604 --> 03:24:06.705]  And I'll give you a couple more examples.
[03:24:07.346 --> 03:24:09.367]  I mean, let's take Monsanto, for example.
[03:24:10.308 --> 03:24:10.708]  Why not?
[03:24:12.279 --> 03:24:26.171]  Recent story that I wrote about up on NoMoreFakeNews about Monsanto destroying several million acres of US farmland in the heartland.
[03:24:29.174 --> 03:24:37.441]  900,000 acres in Arkansas and several million more in other states.
[03:24:38.101 --> 03:24:38.662]  There are now 25
[03:24:40.547 --> 03:24:43.429]  Official complaints that have been lodged against Monsanto.
[03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:45.090]  Why?
[03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:46.211]  What's happening?
[03:24:46.731 --> 03:24:55.637]  Well, their carcinogenic Roundup herbicide, gee, it just hasn't been working.
[03:24:56.537 --> 03:25:05.183]  See, they promised farmers that if the farmers spent extraordinary amounts of money on these new genetically engineered food seeds,
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:11.422]  The crops would be resistant to Roundup, the herbicide.
[03:25:12.403 --> 03:25:17.946]  So when you spray Roundup all over these food crops, it would only kill the weeds.
[03:25:18.626 --> 03:25:26.450]  And therefore, the farmer wouldn't have to go out in the field and find the weeds and pull them up and pick them, which is what you do over and over again.
[03:25:26.690 --> 03:25:28.711]  Oh, well, this is marvelous and fantastic.
[03:25:30.450 --> 03:25:35.153]  Yeah, so that invaded America and other countries starting in the 1990s.
[03:25:36.073 --> 03:25:37.154]  But there was one catch.
[03:25:38.394 --> 03:25:41.916]  The Roundup wasn't working the way it was supposed to be working.
[03:25:42.977 --> 03:25:56.404]  Resistant super weeds were growing all over the place that were rendering farmers into a state where they couldn't any longer support their businesses.
[03:25:59.284 --> 03:26:04.547]  So, what does Monsanto finally do after years and years of pretending this is not a problem?
[03:26:06.048 --> 03:26:08.989]  They introduce dicamba.
[03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:13.712]  Dicamba is an even more powerful herbicide.
[03:26:16.334 --> 03:26:21.777]  And this, they say, will destroy the weeds for sure, and you don't have to worry about the crops.
[03:26:21.857 --> 03:26:27.960]  Except, you see, dicamba drifts from farm to farm when it's sprayed.
[03:26:28.599 --> 03:26:29.719]  It goes everywhere.
[03:26:30.759 --> 03:26:38.381]  And for those farmers who are not growing Monsanto GMO seeds, it's destroying their crops.
[03:26:39.741 --> 03:26:41.242]  It's injuring the land.
[03:26:45.623 --> 03:26:49.923]  What's going to be the result of this legal action against Monsanto?
[03:26:51.944 --> 03:26:52.684]  Dismissal?
[03:26:53.844 --> 03:26:57.365]  Well, we didn't really see how Monsanto was causing any harm.
[03:26:58.616 --> 03:27:08.018]  Or, okay, so $75 million fine, and a promise that you're going to fix the situation.
[03:27:08.158 --> 03:27:09.398]  Oh, sure, we'll fix it.
[03:27:10.398 --> 03:27:10.578]  No.
[03:27:12.018 --> 03:27:27.701]  See, what I want to see, and I think anybody out there with any sense of moral outrage wants to see, let's take a couple of the lying scum researchers who have been lying about the effects
[03:27:28.616 --> 03:27:45.927]  of these herbicides, take them out of the Monsanto lab, along with a few key executives who knew all along how much destruction Monsanto was causing, and put them in jail for, I don't know, 60 years.
[03:27:46.327 --> 03:27:46.887]  How about that?
[03:27:46.907 --> 03:27:48.488]  60 years.
[03:27:49.369 --> 03:27:50.169]  No fine.
[03:27:50.289 --> 03:27:51.090]  Forget the fine.
[03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:53.571]  Just 60 years, okay?
[03:27:55.032 --> 03:27:56.293]  No chance of parole.
[03:27:58.341 --> 03:28:00.702]  Oh baby!
[03:28:02.503 --> 03:28:18.710]  Do you think that might send a message to the other giant biotech firms like DuPont and Dow and so forth as to what's waiting for them if they keep lying about their polluting chemicals and the destruction of life?
[03:28:19.890 --> 03:28:23.251]  That's what I'm talking about when I say law and order.
[03:28:25.132 --> 03:28:26.773]  Keeping order by
[03:28:27.575 --> 03:28:35.062]  Enforcing the law to the limit when it's correct and proper to do so.
[03:28:38.506 --> 03:28:39.126]  How about this?
[03:28:40.248 --> 03:28:43.951]  Devin Kelly, the Texas church shooter.
[03:28:46.634 --> 03:28:48.756]  Let's talk about him after the break here.
[03:28:49.793 --> 03:28:57.803]  But this is going to be interesting because this is a case of prior conviction of this mass murderer and what happened to him.
[03:28:58.564 --> 03:29:05.913]  John Rappaport, I will be... You can learn a lot about the weaknesses
[03:29:07.446 --> 03:29:13.088]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[03:29:13.809 --> 03:29:15.609]  They fear families living together.
[03:29:15.649 --> 03:29:18.571]  They fear people loving God.
[03:29:18.671 --> 03:29:23.312]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[03:29:24.613 --> 03:29:31.836]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[03:29:33.820 --> 03:29:40.261]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[03:29:41.821 --> 03:29:47.942]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[03:29:48.823 --> 03:30:01.925]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[03:30:02.941 --> 03:30:09.503]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[03:30:10.804 --> 03:30:18.566]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[03:30:20.287 --> 03:30:21.467]  And so many things will happen.
[03:30:22.668 --> 03:30:23.668]  We are the majority.
[03:30:24.585 --> 03:30:33.336]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[03:30:34.477 --> 03:30:39.504]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[03:30:40.933 --> 03:30:43.375]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[03:30:44.236 --> 03:30:52.423]  So many people stop me on the streets all over the country and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[03:30:53.123 --> 03:30:59.488]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park or at church or at the mall and met my spouse.
[03:31:01.350 --> 03:31:02.231]  So many people write me.
[03:31:03.052 --> 03:31:11.301]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[03:31:12.062 --> 03:31:13.664]  We have to fly our flag.
[03:31:14.656 --> 03:31:16.116]  We have to wear our colors.
[03:31:16.397 --> 03:31:21.058]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:21.718 --> 03:31:24.579]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[03:31:24.779 --> 03:31:36.042]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[03:31:36.262 --> 03:31:38.283]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:31:38.863 --> 03:31:41.046]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[03:31:41.366 --> 03:31:43.729]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:50.798]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[03:31:51.299 --> 03:31:55.964]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[03:31:56.825 --> 03:32:03.811]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[03:32:04.151 --> 03:32:07.134]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[03:32:07.494 --> 03:32:24.508]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[03:32:25.268 --> 03:32:34.017]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[03:32:34.698 --> 03:32:39.362]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[03:32:39.382 --> 03:32:47.971]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors,
[03:32:48.471 --> 03:32:51.254]  All of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[03:32:51.574 --> 03:32:57.839]  So please, from myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[03:32:58.240 --> 03:32:59.781]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:33:05.065 --> 03:33:07.668]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.685 --> 03:33:27.147]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:27.227 --> 03:33:30.188]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.608 --> 03:33:33.909]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:33:34.290 --> 03:33:35.410]  John Rappaport here.
[03:33:37.251 --> 03:33:38.431]  Back in the fourth hour.
[03:33:40.332 --> 03:33:45.334]  Before we go on here, I want to talk about Devin Kelly, the Texas church shooter.
[03:33:45.854 --> 03:33:48.435]  It's just about taking the country apart at the seams.
[03:33:49.537 --> 03:34:04.566]  At the level of the legal system and how by manipulating the legal system to put innocent people in prison and exonerate guilty people or give them little, little tiny sentences when they've committed heinous crimes.
[03:34:05.607 --> 03:34:09.929]  This is the globalist front on tearing the country apart.
[03:34:10.009 --> 03:34:18.074]  Believe me, this is a major, major, major operation has been going on for a long time.
[03:34:19.210 --> 03:34:30.021]  So before I get to that with Devin Kelly and the Texas Church shooting and what happened to him when he was in the military, which the mainstream press is not covering, of course, never does, never will.
[03:34:30.041 --> 03:34:38.210]  I just want to talk about the Infowars store and extended free shipping on all sales for great products.
[03:34:38.650 --> 03:34:41.393]  These are not just great deals, but they're great products.
[03:34:42.456 --> 03:34:52.080]  And we've had to end some of the specials, including 50% off all apparel and 50% off Super Male Vitality because promotion has been so successful.
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:35:01.084]  But we're extending free shipping while supplies last for Biome Defense 50, which is the popular probiotic formula.
[03:35:01.924 --> 03:35:10.648]  Z-Shield dropping that by 50% plus free shipping, bringing you toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:35:11.445 --> 03:35:19.973]  Caveman True Paleo Formula is back for 50% off with free shipping at the Info Wars Store.
[03:35:21.174 --> 03:35:28.880]  These products and specials are going on right now as well as Vitamin Mineral Fusion 50 off with free shipping.
[03:35:29.321 --> 03:35:33.424]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Mouthwash 50 off with free shipping.
[03:35:34.285 --> 03:35:37.548]  DNA Force 25 off with free shipping.
[03:35:38.971 --> 03:35:44.216]  Tremendous deals and tremendous products and you support the InfoWars.
[03:35:44.296 --> 03:35:54.104]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com for these great deals and great products that support the InfoWars.
[03:35:56.046 --> 03:36:04.473]  Okay, Devin Kelly, the Texas church shooter back in 2013, was brought up before a military court
[03:36:06.713 --> 03:36:33.689]  On charges of repeatedly beating his wife, kicking her, choking her, pointing a loaded gun at her, and fracturing the skull of his infant stepson with a blow that army representatives said was intense enough to kill the infant stepson.
[03:36:34.409 --> 03:36:35.770]  Fractured his skull.
[03:36:37.609 --> 03:36:39.610]  Okay, you getting this now?
[03:36:40.371 --> 03:36:41.792]  These were the charges.
[03:36:43.172 --> 03:36:50.077]  Kelly said that he had indeed struck his infant stepson intentionally.
[03:36:53.319 --> 03:36:53.979]  The sentence?
[03:36:56.701 --> 03:37:00.183]  A year of confinement and demotion in rank.
[03:37:01.844 --> 03:37:02.184]  That's it.
[03:37:06.385 --> 03:37:06.625]  That was 2013.
[03:37:10.329 --> 03:37:19.156]  Now, this is the military legal system, where you would expect much harsher sentences, but no.
[03:37:22.459 --> 03:37:30.707]  So with anything resembling, resembling, faintly resembling a just sentence,
[03:37:31.437 --> 03:37:38.638]  This guy never would have been around walking free on the street to show up at the Texas church and kill all those people.
[03:37:38.698 --> 03:37:39.558]  Never would have happened.
[03:37:40.779 --> 03:37:43.679]  Never would have happened.
[03:37:44.819 --> 03:37:45.339]  Understand?
[03:37:45.519 --> 03:37:45.799]  Get it?
[03:37:47.500 --> 03:38:00.602]  But because one year of confinement and demotion in rank, he was able to walk free and commit mass murder.
[03:38:04.369 --> 03:38:17.940]  How do these people who sit in juries, judges really, I guess you would say, depends on who is passing sentence in an individual case.
[03:38:18.641 --> 03:38:19.721]  How do they live with themselves?
[03:38:19.761 --> 03:38:20.702]  How do they sleep at night?
[03:38:23.665 --> 03:38:33.933]  The people in the armed forces who were involved with the prosecution of Devin Kelly, now knowing what he did and looking back, well, gee, let me go back and see what we did.
[03:38:34.736 --> 03:38:45.620]  Okay, so he almost killed a stepson, fractured his infant stepson's skull, beat his wife, pointed loaded gun at her a number of times.
[03:38:46.821 --> 03:38:48.302]  So let's see, what was the sentence?
[03:38:48.922 --> 03:38:49.642]  What do we give him?
[03:38:51.043 --> 03:38:53.344]  A year of confinement.
[03:38:56.825 --> 03:39:00.867]  You drive the people of a country crazy when you keep doing this.
[03:39:02.187 --> 03:39:04.208]  This is an intentional op, folks.
[03:39:05.723 --> 03:39:11.767]  This is not something that is, you know, organically developed.
[03:39:12.988 --> 03:39:21.814]  Yes, because crime is so much more widespread, then it puts an increased burden on the legal system and the prison system and so on and so forth and whatever.
[03:39:24.035 --> 03:39:33.862]  But if you think that's a sufficient reason to let go of somebody who was basically a killer in 2013 named Devin Kelly,
[03:39:36.889 --> 03:39:43.292]  And give him a year of confinement so that he could go on to kill numerous people in a mass shooting at a church.
[03:39:44.213 --> 03:39:45.193]  You better think again.
[03:39:46.074 --> 03:39:47.054]  You better think again.
[03:39:49.135 --> 03:39:51.716]  But this is the globalist plan.
[03:39:55.818 --> 03:40:05.363]  Overwhelm a country in various ways so that no proportional response seems to be possible.
[03:40:06.693 --> 03:40:09.154]  Waves and waves of criminality.
[03:40:11.795 --> 03:40:25.280]  Waves and waves of illegal immigration beyond the capacity of communities, people, governments to deal with on many fronts.
[03:40:28.982 --> 03:40:35.104]  Waves and waves and waves of chemical destruction as in a major
[03:40:36.599 --> 03:40:40.380]  Top flight globalist corporation, Monsanto, and others.
[03:40:42.100 --> 03:41:02.845]  I've talked about the extent of pharmaceutical destruction in America and other countries on this show many times, as well as the recent opioid epidemic, which is really the single most chilling pharmaceutical event that I've seen in 20-25 years of covering big pharma.
[03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:20.285]  To overwhelm a country to the point where it seems it seems that no proportional response is possible.
[03:41:21.786 --> 03:41:34.991]  But you see, there is, as I indicated in the last segment, throw a couple of these top flight Monsanto's executives in prison for 50 or 60 years with no parole and see what starts to happen.
[03:41:38.027 --> 03:41:50.752]  Take a guy like Devin Kelly in the military in 2013 and put him in jail for 40 or 50 years with no parole and see what ripple effects that creates in the military.
[03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:58.495]  The next time that somebody is accused correctly of actual rape.
[03:42:00.295 --> 03:42:02.176]  Oh, well, these things have no deterrent effect.
[03:42:02.196 --> 03:42:02.796]  Yes, they do.
[03:42:04.257 --> 03:42:04.817]  Sure they do.
[03:42:08.010 --> 03:42:31.046]  Once people begin to become confident that the legal system is correctly prosecuting people on correct charges and giving them proportional sentences, as opposed to putting people in prison who don't belong there in the first place, everything changes.
[03:42:32.047 --> 03:42:33.307]  Everything changes.
[03:42:34.248 --> 03:42:34.929]  John Rappaport.
[03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:36.189]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:42:36.209 --> 03:42:36.730]  Stay with us.
[03:42:44.494 --> 03:42:46.059]  We are on the march.
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:48.887]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:42:49.368 --> 03:42:52.136]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:43:03.450 --> 03:43:08.333]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:43:09.154 --> 03:43:12.076]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:43:12.736 --> 03:43:15.538]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:43:16.179 --> 03:43:21.062]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[03:43:21.402 --> 03:43:27.706]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[03:43:28.066 --> 03:43:33.230]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:37.312]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:43:37.912 --> 03:43:45.716]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[03:43:46.296 --> 03:43:50.638]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[03:43:50.978 --> 03:43:54.920]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[03:43:55.220 --> 03:43:59.022]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[03:43:59.262 --> 03:44:00.923]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:05.919 --> 03:44:07.379]  So Gabe Hoffman, amazing.
[03:44:07.719 --> 03:44:12.260]  So you start investigating, this is a very successful capital management firm.
[03:44:13.060 --> 03:44:19.482]  You start investigating it, you go down the rabbit hole, just recapping, and found all these cases of convicted Hollywood pedophiles.
[03:44:19.542 --> 03:44:27.423]  As you mentioned, in the film, now there's new cases, during Weinstein years, Disney hired child molesters to direct film who raped and was convicted.
[03:44:27.463 --> 03:44:30.544]  A 12-year-old boy on the set to be around children again.
[03:44:31.384 --> 03:44:33.005]  So this is how the rabbit hole began.
[03:44:33.025 --> 03:44:34.046]  You've got the floor now.
[03:44:34.466 --> 03:44:40.290]  Get into the film, which you're offering free right now, at InfoWars.com because they tried to suppress it and tried to block it.
[03:44:40.310 --> 03:44:44.072]  You put a million and a half dollars of your own money into this with your great crew.
[03:44:44.092 --> 03:44:45.013]  That's why you're a hero.
[03:44:45.353 --> 03:44:46.274]  They tried to block it.
[03:44:46.354 --> 03:44:47.654]  Well, they're not going to block it.
[03:44:47.995 --> 03:44:49.295]  It's free, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:49.315 --> 03:44:50.576]  It's up to you to get this out.
[03:44:50.776 --> 03:44:51.657]  So again, I want to commend you.
[03:44:51.897 --> 03:44:57.900]  The real heroes are the brave survivors and victims who came forward on our show, on our film.
[03:44:58.200 --> 03:44:59.461]  We didn't pay them a dime.
[03:44:59.701 --> 03:45:01.162]  We didn't black out their faces.
[03:45:01.802 --> 03:45:03.463]  We didn't hide their names.
[03:45:04.083 --> 03:45:04.483]  Nothing.
[03:45:04.984 --> 03:45:10.947]  It was the highest standards journalism and they had to name their accusers and there had to be actual proof or
[03:45:11.607 --> 03:45:24.456]  In one case, we actually unmasked a pedophile who was one of the biggest child managers in Hollywood over the last 30-40 years, and he fesses up on camera in An Open Secret.
[03:45:25.236 --> 03:45:32.822]  So, we have exclusively at InfoWars the An Open Secret internal Hollywood pedophile map.
[03:45:33.582 --> 03:45:49.375]  Because there are just connections with these pedophiles, how they're all friends, they know each other, they manage the same children, they put, you know, a manager who's a pedophile will put the child on the pedophile's show, they will hire each other, even after their conviction.
[03:45:49.455 --> 03:45:54.980]  It's just amazing how convicted pedophiles are actually still working in Hollywood today, and we have to put a stop to it.
[03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:57.643]  You know, it's not just about exposing the Hollywood pedophiles.
[03:45:57.863 --> 03:46:02.207]  It's about doing good in your community, helping you to make your children safe.
[03:46:02.528 --> 03:46:04.469]  We get you into the mind of the pedophile.
[03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:12.658]  They speak themselves, you learn what their justifications are, and we even show home videos where if you're looking closely, you can see the
[03:46:13.018 --> 03:46:19.663]  A pedophile hanging out with a good American family and subtle, little, increasing sexualization here and there.
[03:46:19.903 --> 03:46:26.048]  You learn about their tactics, you learn about their tools, you learn about how to protect your children from them in your community.
[03:46:26.188 --> 03:46:33.493]  And there are subtle, little signs of the sexualization in terms of language and other things that we teach you about in an open secret.
[03:46:33.773 --> 03:46:38.257]  Certain groups, certain beliefs, more normalized, fine, but the pedophiles want to be next.
[03:46:38.817 --> 03:46:40.158]  And now we learn at the U.N.
[03:46:40.198 --> 03:46:46.600]  everywhere, they're the ones behind it all, pushing the normalization, because that's what they want finally for them, is no limits.
[03:46:46.620 --> 03:46:47.601]  Where under U.N.
[03:46:47.661 --> 03:46:51.802]  law, they're asking to come to your door and demand to date your five-year-old daughter.
[03:46:52.162 --> 03:46:55.204]  I mean, that's literally the kind of stuff that Salon and others are pushing.
[03:46:55.464 --> 03:46:57.965]  The normalization, the coming out of the pedophiles.
[03:47:05.568 --> 03:47:08.169]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.408 --> 03:47:37.109]  John Rappaport here, the final segment of the fourth hour at InfoWars.
[03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:43.871]  Just want to mention briefly a new product up at InfoWarsStore.com, Floral Life.
[03:47:45.512 --> 03:47:47.312]  And you need to look into this one.
[03:47:48.693 --> 03:47:52.314]  Good probiotic bacteria in the gut.
[03:47:53.114 --> 03:47:54.815]  That's what this formula is all about.
[03:47:54.835 --> 03:47:57.976]  20 of the most potent strains on the market.
[03:47:59.856 --> 03:48:01.477]  Boost your gut health.
[03:48:02.981 --> 03:48:04.782]  So it's just come on.
[03:48:05.342 --> 03:48:06.342]  It's a new product.
[03:48:07.043 --> 03:48:08.243]  You need to check it out.
[03:48:09.404 --> 03:48:12.685]  Floral Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:48:13.706 --> 03:48:23.490]  And keep in mind, when you say, here's my money, give me this product and the product helps you become more healthy.
[03:48:26.151 --> 03:48:29.232]  InfoWars takes that money and puts it into the InfoWar.
[03:48:30.172 --> 03:48:31.293]  That's the whole
[03:48:32.159 --> 03:48:33.159]  Transmission here.
[03:48:33.479 --> 03:48:34.540]  That's what it's all about.
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:55.966]  That's what it means It doesn't mean anything else all of the static and Confusion and so forth and so on if we were to believe our esteemed leaders You know We should immediately strike out the Constitution and say well, it's time for socialism.
[03:48:56.006 --> 03:49:00.167]  Let's bring it on Let's just what are we doing now that?
[03:49:00.825 --> 03:49:04.529]  That isn't socialism, so that we can correct that and change that.
[03:49:05.190 --> 03:49:13.959]  Let's see, we need a basic center for monitoring the production of all goods and services in the country.
[03:49:14.019 --> 03:49:18.023]  Yes, okay, that sounds, oh yes, that'll be utopia.
[03:49:18.543 --> 03:49:19.724]  Absolutely utopia.
[03:49:20.645 --> 03:49:24.009]  And then we're going to have another center that decides
[03:49:24.722 --> 03:49:33.304]  How to distribute all the goods and services, who gets them, who eats, who doesn't eat, who has clean water, who doesn't, who lives, who dies, etc.
[03:49:33.404 --> 03:49:47.088]  Oh yeah, sure, we need that, because, of course, only the greatest people and the most humanitarian altruists will be manning these positions, and then we could create this wonderful, wonderful utopia.
[03:49:49.069 --> 03:49:53.170]  And if you think that that's just a science fiction fantasy,
[03:49:54.907 --> 03:50:20.447]  Check your brain and look again, because there are covert means of bringing this about, such as collusion at the top and highest levels of government with mega-corporations, so that they form a symbiotic relationship, which is essentially the real 21st century definition of socialism.
[03:50:21.828 --> 03:50:23.289]  That's what produces
[03:50:24.978 --> 03:50:28.501]  The abyss toward which many countries are heading.
[03:50:29.081 --> 03:50:31.403]  Some have already gone over the edge, like Sweden.
[03:50:33.644 --> 03:50:35.446]  Oh, we're living in a paradise.
[03:50:36.626 --> 03:50:38.548]  Everything is wonderful in Sweden.
[03:50:39.729 --> 03:50:41.710]  Everything is taken care of by the government.
[03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:42.711]  We are happy.
[03:50:42.991 --> 03:50:44.212]  Everybody's wonderful.
[03:50:44.232 --> 03:50:53.579]  Yeah, and gradually, year by year, decade by decade, new levels of passivity
[03:50:54.944 --> 03:51:22.727]  set in, people became more and more secure in their own minds, less apt to say what they really thought until they can't even think anymore, can't separate truth from fiction, can't criticize their own country,
[03:51:23.596 --> 03:51:39.372]  And then out of nowhere, as if by plan, and it was, giant wave after wave of migrants coming into the country that have no intention of fitting in or becoming Swedes.
[03:51:40.994 --> 03:51:43.056]  And among these many, many people,
[03:51:44.170 --> 03:51:51.972]  You have those who are committed to destruction and violence, and they commit the violent crimes.
[03:51:52.112 --> 03:51:57.373]  And then the government says, you must not speak ill of these people.
[03:51:58.373 --> 03:52:01.954]  You must ignore what's going on, essentially.
[03:52:03.074 --> 03:52:10.176]  And things get worse and worse and worse and worse in this socialist, globalist paradise called Sweden.
[03:52:12.791 --> 03:52:14.232]  You must not speak out.
[03:52:14.432 --> 03:52:18.594]  It is now a crime to speak out against what's happening there.
[03:52:19.534 --> 03:52:20.074]  A crime.
[03:52:21.495 --> 03:52:27.438]  And so more people say, well, gee, I guess I misinterpreted things.
[03:52:28.498 --> 03:52:30.639]  I thought that this was bad.
[03:52:31.259 --> 03:52:33.200]  You know, it's just like I was talking about before.
[03:52:33.220 --> 03:52:39.783]  The cognitive dissonance and moral outrage when people who commit
[03:52:41.906 --> 03:52:47.331]  Gigantic, horrendous crimes go unpunished.
[03:52:48.472 --> 03:52:50.233]  There's a whole country where it's happening.
[03:52:51.354 --> 03:52:55.918]  And the socialist, utopian government says, you may not speak out against this.
[03:52:55.999 --> 03:53:03.305]  And what people say, well, I guess I was wrong to think that these immigrants are doing bad things.
[03:53:03.365 --> 03:53:05.347]  I guess it must be misinterpreting.
[03:53:06.508 --> 03:53:08.890]  Something is the matter in my own mind.
[03:53:10.695 --> 03:53:17.256]  We, the Swedes, must have historically committed gigantic crimes and this is our karmic retribution.
[03:53:19.017 --> 03:53:21.397]  Oh yeah, that sounds like it could be the case.
[03:53:21.417 --> 03:53:37.260]  You're now talking about human robots and androids who are no longer able to think for themselves, even try to defend themselves, speak out against what's happening.
[03:53:37.821 --> 03:53:39.461]  The only thing they can accuse
[03:53:40.902 --> 03:53:41.903]  Is their own mind.
[03:53:43.824 --> 03:53:45.245]  Where does that leave a person?
[03:53:47.507 --> 03:53:48.988]  Where does that leave a person?
[03:53:51.630 --> 03:54:02.777]  So this country that was always the model of peace and prosperity and the government will take care of everything now becomes a transcendent living nightmare.
[03:54:05.820 --> 03:54:06.360]  Nightmare.
[03:54:08.121 --> 03:54:10.463]  Unequipped and unable apparently
[03:54:11.667 --> 03:54:16.591]  to deal with what amounts to a foreign invasion.
[03:54:18.573 --> 03:54:21.755]  No, they're not wearing the uniforms of another country.
[03:54:21.775 --> 03:54:25.098]  There has been no declaration of war.
[03:54:25.979 --> 03:54:27.740]  But there is war over there.
[03:54:29.662 --> 03:54:31.063]  There is war every day.
[03:54:33.573 --> 03:54:38.736]  You've read about it because you understand that independent media brings you these stories.
[03:54:38.776 --> 03:54:41.778]  You've read about these stories here, for example, at Infowars.
[03:54:45.660 --> 03:54:51.704]  Private property destruction, theft, violent assault, rape.
[03:54:55.246 --> 03:54:59.188]  Where is the Swedish government coming to the fore?
[03:54:59.978 --> 03:55:05.621]  And making a definitive statement about these crimes and their prosecution.
[03:55:07.983 --> 03:55:17.548]  And what the Swedish government, who has said we control the entire country and we're the good people that give the population all good things.
[03:55:19.089 --> 03:55:20.690]  So now we're going to deal with this.
[03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:22.111]  Where is that government now?
[03:55:24.752 --> 03:55:27.574]  That government is now surrendered.
[03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:31.332]  Until we see any evidence that they haven't.
[03:55:31.392 --> 03:55:32.233]  They've surrendered.
[03:55:33.313 --> 03:55:34.714]  They've surrendered.
[03:55:36.656 --> 03:55:44.761]  Because in the larger globalist scheme, many, many countries have to be put into a state of chaos.
[03:55:46.643 --> 03:55:56.950]  And this supposed socialist utopia in Sweden was really, as we see now, only a transitory phase in a much larger scheme.
[03:55:58.544 --> 03:56:01.686]  Two overwhelmed countries put them into chaos.
[03:56:02.826 --> 03:56:16.053]  Wipe people's memories clean of any principled activity and conduct and honor in defense of their own country and their own person and their own family.
[03:56:16.893 --> 03:56:27.999]  And instead, substitute some very hazy, cloudy, socialist, globalist,
[03:56:30.396 --> 03:56:39.020]  gibberish that leads to further and further destruction until people say, well, it must be me, must be my own mind.
[03:56:39.860 --> 03:56:44.522]  It must be me that is misinterpreting all of these events.
[03:56:45.603 --> 03:56:47.204]  I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.
[03:56:47.324 --> 03:56:49.585]  I'm not experiencing what I'm experiencing.
[03:56:51.786 --> 03:56:59.109]  I'm just an idea factory and other people are producing the ideas and then I spew them out.
[03:57:01.149 --> 03:57:04.190]  We've seen these people all over the place.
[03:57:04.270 --> 03:57:05.530]  We've seen them in America.
[03:57:08.031 --> 03:57:28.757]  And as I've detailed here before, as we come down to the end of the segment here, if you read the works of Gary Allen, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, Anthony Sutton, his three-volume work on socialism as an elite plan, you know what's really happening.
[03:57:29.648 --> 03:57:30.630]  We're at the end of our time.
[03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:32.353]  John Rappaport, thank you very much.
