[00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:11.672]  We now take you live to the resistance.
[00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:16.093]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commencement.
[00:00:16.113 --> 00:00:16.894]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.054]  In the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:19.714]  It's official.
[00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:26.656]  The AG is criminally investigating Hillary for being a Russian spy.
[00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:31.177]  The whole house of cards is coming down.
[00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:35.138]  But first, let's get to this key report where YouTube admits massive censorship.
[00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:52.081]  YouTube is admitting that they've altered the algorithm and are using human curators to manipulate the search results for certain topics so that the videos that show up as the top results are from mainstream media channels instead of independent channels, no matter how popular the videos that they produce.
[00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:52.681]  Are.
[00:00:52.901 --> 00:01:14.387]  The way that YouTube used to work is that when you search for a topic the top search results used to be videos not with the most views as most people think but videos with the most watch time meaning that when somebody clicks on a video and if they keep watching it it starts racking up the amount of the time that people are watching it and that sum total adds up to the total watch time showing that the video is what those people are searching for
[00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:19.968]  Not if they just find a video and click off of it immediately because it's deceptive or some clickbait title or something.
[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:27.610]  So the videos used to be relevant to the search or videos that were relevant to the search that people liked watching.
[00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.212]  But now YouTube is admitting that they've altered the algorithm after searches are turning up videos about conspiracy theories.
[00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:43.259]  In fact, my friend Gary Franchi over at the Next News Network sent me this screenshot of some of his analytics showing his video directly being affected by this algorithm.
[00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:49.043]  This chart here is the amount of views per hour that his video was getting over a 48-hour period.
[00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:54.648]  And so, this is about 3,000 views per hour, just chugging along, chugging along.
[00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.009]  Drops a little bit there.
[00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.753]  This is probably, you know, early in the morning, you know, 2, 3, 4 in the morning.
[00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:03.876]  Starts to pick up again here, and then all of a sudden, boom!
[00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:10.160]  Such a steep drop-off, which can really only be explained by some change in the algorithm.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.706]  And just lo and behold, we have YouTube admitting that they changed the algorithm to then favor major news network channels.
[00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:35.255]  James O'Keefe's Project Veritas recently did an undercover investigation into YouTube and they got a YouTube employee who is the lead brand and diversity curator to admit that they are censoring independent channels in favor of mainstream news outlets.
[00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:36.476]  What about the algorithm?
[00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:37.677]  Can you do something with that?
[00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:39.719]  That's what that news carousel kind of does.
[00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.700]  It's above the search results.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.762]  At the very least, we can say that
[00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:01.046]  We can't have people finding Alex Jones videos too easily.
[00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:03.887]  We have to bury those at the bottom of the search results.
[00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:23.055]  By the way, did I mispronounce this person earlier in my video?
[00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.095]  I didn't mean to.
[00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:29.759]  That's a crime in California now, and I don't want to get fined or go to jail for calling this thing a guy.
[00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:42.667]  By the way, this person's job title is literally Brand and Diversity Curation Lead at YouTube, which gives us quite a bit of insight into the manipulation that's going on at YouTube and who's doing the manipulating.
[00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:53.635]  Gee, I can't imagine why we have so many conservative videos getting censored on YouTube, getting demonetized, and getting removed for violating the community guidelines when there are people like this making the decisions.
[00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:57.698]  By the way, here's the same person during a different part of Project Veritas' investigation.
[00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:01.561]  It looks like they're at a different location, different day, wearing a different sweatshirt.
[00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:09.487]  And look at this, the sweatshirt says Google printed on the sleeve, and it looks like it also says Black Lives Matter printed on the front.
[00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:16.212]  This whole fake news witch hunt that the mainstream media launched immediately after the election last year has primarily been focusing on Facebook.
[00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:18.873]  Oh, fake news is spreading through Facebook, Facebook.
[00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:23.016]  But they're now focusing on YouTube, and they hate us, and they want us taken down.
[00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:29.301]  Here's an article from BuzzFeed, how YouTube serves as the content engine of the Internet's dark side.
[00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:39.428]  Everybody knows that Twitter and Facebook spread bad information and hate speech, but YouTube, which pays for conspiracy theories seen by millions, may be even worse.
[00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:50.433]  By the way, this article came out just only a month before the YouTube adpocalypse, the advertising apocalypse, when YouTube just took their advice and demonetized most news channels.
[00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:52.054]  Folks, and it's a lot worse.
[00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:58.717]  The Democrats have openly announced a plan to sue InfoWars out of operation by the end of next year.
[00:04:58.737 --> 00:04:59.618]  We're going to expose that.
[00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:00.978]  We have all their documents.
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:01.619]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:07.748]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:14.254]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.458]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:20.861]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.485]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:25.306]  The left
[00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.567]  ...controls culture.
[00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:27.568]  They control arts.
[00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:28.869]  They control entertainment.
[00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.256]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:38.718]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.063]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:45.164]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate...
[00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:51.167]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:57.669]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.450]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.790]  It's available right now.
[00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.271]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.050]  Got it.
[00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:11.534]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:11.614 --> 00:06:13.675]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:17.918]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:21.720]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.982]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the 18th day of October 2017 on this Wednesday edition.
[00:06:31.577 --> 00:06:49.832]  We are reaching record numbers of people every day across the planet, all part of our amazing human race, despite the admissions of major governments, major corporations, major bureaucracies, to censor InfoWars, and yours truly, and our team.
[00:06:50.172 --> 00:07:00.240]  And that means censor you, and your will, and your support for this broadcast, because we are seen by the globalists as the heart
[00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:08.608]  As the spirit, as the Bible of resistance to their globalist operations.
[00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:17.581]  And instead of just blowing me up in a car bomb, which would turn me into a martyr, they are trying to destroy who I am
[00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:34.112]  And who InfoWars is by building straw men and straw women that do not represent us, that are facsimiles, and then advertising that fraud, and then discrediting that fraud, and destroying that fraud, not the real McCoy.
[00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:37.814]  Not the bonafide real deal.
[00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:51.248]  We are witnessing a private corporate world government openly at war with the nation state and all forms of independence, all forms of freedom, the family.
[00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:53.769]  This is their stated goal.
[00:07:54.789 --> 00:08:07.094]  And they've gone from denying it's their goal, building it in the shadows, to now openly coming out and saying it is their sworn operation and their sworn directive
[00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:31.570]  To attack Christians, to attack the West, to create cultural and racial divides, to medicalize the population through medical tyranny, to de-industrialize and make the population completely dependent, to move people also away from the farms and ranches, and to make us completely domesticated and controlled.
[00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.734]  We are facing 21st century, high-tech, eugenics-based technocracy.
[00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:49.852]  Terms like deep state, shadow government, false flag, all of these are terms I popularized on this broadcast that are now household terms and words.
[00:08:50.452 --> 00:08:51.993]  I'm not giving myself credit.
[00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:59.978]  Listeners, though, need to understand what you're watching and what you're listening to is what the enemy fears.
[00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:02.240]  And that's for a very important reason.
[00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:06.183]  We understand the globalist operation.
[00:09:06.223 --> 00:09:29.603]  We've simply studied their own program and their own operation, and we know that if we expose that it's horribly anti-human, extremely authoritarian, viciously greedy, and hateful, and covetous of information and freedom, and that it seeks to enslave humanity, and seeks to break us down into biological artificialities,
[00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:36.819]  You see, it's not like Blade Runner where humans create a race of superhumans to serve them.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.866]  This is where the technocracy, the elites, who've never been able to capture and fully control humanity,
[00:09:43.951 --> 00:10:05.897]  Biologically turn us into artificial biological facsimiles of what we were through genetic engineering, through the GMO, through the vaccines, through the culture, through the food, through the water, through the programming, until we are no longer human and need them to exist, making them masters.
[00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:11.781]  Artificially over humanity by removing our humanity.
[00:10:12.222 --> 00:10:14.483]  It's the only way they can conquer free will.
[00:10:15.884 --> 00:10:22.968]  And we see every metric, the cancer, the neurological disorders, the gut disorders, the skin disorders.
[00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:27.722]  Every new disease popping out every week.
[00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:30.083]  The life expectancy plunging.
[00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:32.303]  Infant mortality exploding.
[00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:37.125]  Diabetes type 1 and 2 up multi-thousand percentage points.
[00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:40.746]  Pediatric cancers up over 20-plus thousand percent.
[00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:44.247]  Many are 10,000 but some are over 20,000 percent up.
[00:10:44.747 --> 00:10:47.508]  It is a biological holocaust.
[00:10:48.362 --> 00:11:07.888]  And the globalists divert you from all their real biological and chemical holocaust by claiming they want a carbon tax, carbon dioxide, and, oh, they're going to sue your company because your clothes, you know, have 20 times less lead in them than an apple does or kale does.
[00:11:08.248 --> 00:11:16.110]  But then they're going to spread HIV and hepatitis and all the rest of it forcibly putting into the blood supply.
[00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.631]  I'm talking about California.
[00:11:18.371 --> 00:11:19.452]  You want to know the future?
[00:11:19.492 --> 00:11:27.656]  Look at Sweden, look at California, look at Germany, look at the UK, look at all the programming, and that's the future they've got in store for all of us.
[00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:31.878]  Bottom line, they're coming for you and your family.
[00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:33.458]  Look at the Washington Post headline.
[00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:36.200]  California makes it a misdemeanor to kill somebody with HIV.
[00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:39.703]  Let's continue.
[00:11:40.644 --> 00:11:44.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a hate letter to humanity.
[00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:46.471]  This is a global takeover.
[00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:49.775]  This is total and complete bloodthirsty domination.
[00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:52.018]  All posing with a simpering...
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.242]  NPR Voice meant to put you into a trance.
[00:11:57.143 --> 00:11:59.844]  Everything they do is about putting you into a trance.
[00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:01.345]  Having you sleep.
[00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:02.606]  Sleep.
[00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:04.347]  Give in your will.
[00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:06.008]  Give in your will.
[00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:07.970]  Simply turn on the Netflix.
[00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.350]  Drink another beer.
[00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:10.491]  Sleep.
[00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:11.412]  Sleep.
[00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:12.793]  Don't worry about it today.
[00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.274]  Let us run things.
[00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.175]  Talk like we talk.
[00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:17.956]  Use only the words we say.
[00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:19.317]  Join our cult.
[00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.958]  Everything will be okay.
[00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:21.919]  Come on in.
[00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:23.000]  The water's fine.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:23.980]  Sleep.
[00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.041]  Sleep.
[00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:27.863]  Everything we do is about AWAKEN!
[00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:30.305]  The sleeper must awaken.
[00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:31.906]  The giant must awaken.
[00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:32.907]  Look around you.
[00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:36.029]  You're being forced into an artificial matrix system.
[00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.812]  So that's the big challenge we're up against.
[00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:42.714]  But it's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:47.592]  And that's why they hate us, because it came out in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:48.332]  I meant to cover it.
[00:12:48.412 --> 00:12:48.812]  I didn't.
[00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:49.913]  I noticed Bashobit covered it.
[00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:50.994]  Please print me the Wall Street Journal.
[00:12:56.678 --> 00:13:06.344]  George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator, because CNN says he's not a Nazi collaborator, talking about next-level fake news, and then I made it up, even though he's on 60 Minutes saying it.
[00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:16.669]  Normalee gives here in the United States every year about $500 million from swindles he's engaged in and bankrupting economies all over the world.
[00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:26.871]  And he admittedly gave over a billion of his swindled money, he's just a front guy for intelligence agencies, to the State Department, $5 billion to overthrow the elected government of Ukraine and start a civil war there.
[00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:28.632]  He also funded part of the Arab Spring.
[00:13:29.472 --> 00:13:32.613]  But he's just one of the top generals of this satanic order.
[00:13:33.753 --> 00:13:37.274]  He is now transferring $18 billion to his foundation.
[00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:43.734]  To directly battle the American people and nationalist movements worldwide.
[00:13:44.534 --> 00:13:45.075]  And he says it.
[00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:45.775]  There's the headline.
[00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:50.656]  Jordan Soros transfers $18 billion to his foundation, creating an instant giant.
[00:13:51.996 --> 00:13:56.377]  Now, what are they doing simultaneously on every so-called late-night comedy show?
[00:13:57.017 --> 00:14:07.800]  Claiming that I'm a snake oil salesman and that all our products are pure crap, even though most of them are private-labeled, the very ones sold by Jeff Bezos at Whole Foods, that all the leftist watchdog groups completely leave alone.
[00:14:09.514 --> 00:14:13.440]  And they're openly calling for my arrest and Gwyneth Paltrow's arrest.
[00:14:14.902 --> 00:14:22.494]  They picked her out as a liberal figurehead so it wouldn't look as political when they try to have us both arrested, which is ongoing, admittedly, right now.
[00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:35.656]  Simply because they don't want us to get millions of dollars at InfoWars to then fund this operation to fight the 18 billion of a foreign Nazi collaborator.
[00:14:36.297 --> 00:14:49.945]  A literal monster creature that funded the radical Arab Spring to murder women that were going to college, murder gays, murder priests, blow up hundreds of churches in Syria and in Egypt alone, mass murder everywhere.
[00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:52.757]  This is how they operate.
[00:14:52.897 --> 00:15:04.611]  So his $18 billion of filthy money is to run lawsuits, and is to go after the NRA, and is to go after Infowars, and is to go after the free press, and is to lobby Congress.
[00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.406]  And is to overthrow nation-states.
[00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:11.228]  That's the admitted open society's main program.
[00:15:11.868 --> 00:15:13.169]  But it's all philanthropic.
[00:15:13.209 --> 00:15:26.555]  See, he puts his dirty money from everything you can imagine, currency speculation, and it goes on and on with all his insider knowledge from the globalists, to overthrowing countries and smashing the Trump revolution.
[00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:30.197]  You can say what you want about Trump, but at least he's trying to be the president.
[00:15:30.658 --> 00:15:32.879]  And you know him by all his authoritarian enemies.
[00:15:33.973 --> 00:15:40.135]  The Hollywood director Rick Linklater came out and said, you know, Alex has always been anti-establishment, anti-power structure.
[00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:41.615]  I don't know why he's pro-power structure.
[00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:42.956]  Pro-power structure?
[00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:49.958]  We have the whole global power structure coming down against America and our desperate attempt to just at least get control of our government again.
[00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:53.619]  That's why they hate Trump because he believes America should be run by America.
[00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:54.499]  Is he perfect?
[00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:54.779]  No.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.180]  But he's an American and I stand with him.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.441]  I stand with you and we'll never back down.
[00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:11.354]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:15.295]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:16:15.956 --> 00:16:22.478]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:16:22.678 --> 00:16:26.019]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[00:16:26.339 --> 00:16:28.140]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:37.209]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.191]  They know how great it is.
[00:16:39.112 --> 00:16:42.896]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:45.158]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:53.864]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:16:54.304 --> 00:17:02.790]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.752]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:09.934]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:13.257]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:17:15.658 --> 00:17:16.779]  It's a good deal at $39.

[00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:36.443]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[00:18:37.003 --> 00:18:37.643]  Concentrate.
[00:18:37.663 --> 00:18:39.464]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:18:39.704 --> 00:18:41.124]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:18:41.145 --> 00:18:42.985]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:44.266]  It's incredible.
[00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.646]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:18:46.847 --> 00:18:47.987]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:49.347]  At 15, incredible.
[00:18:49.668 --> 00:18:50.548]  It is amazing.
[00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:52.188]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:55.290]  50% off Caveman, but only a few days left.
[00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.290]  It's about to end.
[00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.231]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:04.833]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:06.654]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:08.054]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:09.255]  I want to thank you.
[00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:10.635]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:21.059]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:25.220]  On sale right now at Infowarslife.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.281]  But these specials have got to end.
[00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:37.184]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:42.786]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:51.571]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever.

[00:19:56.577 --> 00:20:01.381]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:08.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:24.724]  It's an astounding time to be alive.
[00:20:29.668 --> 00:20:31.669]  We are living in 2017.
[00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:44.438]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:44.738 --> 00:20:46.720]  Globalist, already living in about 2040.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.023]  Technology-wise, the throne admission.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.402]  They believe they'll soon break completely away from this former civilization.
[00:20:58.643 --> 00:21:01.664]  We are to then be orderly exterminated.
[00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:08.548]  It'll be done high-tech, where you basically beg for it.
[00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:13.510]  But, if you're aware of the operation, you can defeat it.
[00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:16.111]  By the way, there's no joining it.
[00:21:16.131 --> 00:21:20.974]  A lot of people who are soulless or mercenary, buy into it short term.
[00:21:22.794 --> 00:21:26.495]  They are dishonorable, blind people.
[00:21:28.235 --> 00:21:32.357]  Okay, next segment I'm going to get into the big enchilada.
[00:21:32.377 --> 00:21:48.781]  The House of Cards is falling in a spectacular way of Robert Mueller covering up the activities of the Clintons, the Democratic Party, in a giant orgy being paid off by the Communist Chinese, the Russians, and others.
[00:21:51.035 --> 00:22:05.880]  And we have Attorney General Sessions in the Judiciary Committee today reporting that he is looking in a criminal investigation of Hillary for basic espionage against this republic.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.361]  Now, we have Mueller transferring uranium illegally.
[00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:12.542]  In a bag.
[00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:13.563]  For the Russians.
[00:22:16.163 --> 00:22:17.644]  We have the Democratic Party
[00:22:20.183 --> 00:22:23.069]  Most of them getting $10, $15, $20, $30 million a piece.
[00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:25.834]  I mean, the high-level Democrats were all getting paid off by the Russians.
[00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:28.927]  That's what governments do.
[00:22:29.328 --> 00:22:32.709]  And we're wide open to espionage in this country via the Democratic Party.
[00:22:32.949 --> 00:22:36.350]  They've always been the ones that have been working with the Russians.
[00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:43.893]  They helped put the Bolsheviks in in 1917 and visited that social engineering hell on the Russians they now want here.
[00:22:44.273 --> 00:22:45.934]  People keep going, this is like what they did in Russia.
[00:22:46.254 --> 00:22:47.154]  Why is it so similar?
[00:22:47.335 --> 00:22:48.435]  And why is Russia fighting it?
[00:22:48.455 --> 00:22:52.657]  Because they already got the face sucker after 80 plus years off their face.
[00:22:53.017 --> 00:22:53.517]  Partially.
[00:22:56.069 --> 00:22:58.771]  Yes, the New York Liberals funded the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:22:58.811 --> 00:22:59.632]  That's public.
[00:22:59.932 --> 00:23:01.513]  That's in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:23:03.714 --> 00:23:04.895]  The left doesn't play games.
[00:23:04.935 --> 00:23:07.057]  They'll butcher you and your family if they get a chance.
[00:23:07.977 --> 00:23:11.280]  As long as you're Christian, they want to get you in that FEMA camp and stomp your guts out.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.021]  I'm not saying that rhetorically.
[00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:17.884]  The average leftist wants to literally murder you and your family, and we now all see it.
[00:23:17.924 --> 00:23:18.785]  They hate America.
[00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:19.826]  They hate God.
[00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:20.806]  They hate working.
[00:23:21.755 --> 00:23:34.417]  They're just a bunch of litigious devil-worshipping scum that hate you because you're strong, you're honorable, you're good-looking, and you got what they don't have, a conscience, and a connection to God.
[00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:44.919]  And they're not gonna stop till they've sexualized every one of your children, and until they've wrecked your whole society, and until they've broken down everything, and until they've bankrupted the country.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.300]  So just remember that!
[00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:51.919]  They want to shoot you up with as much lead and mercury as they can.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.860]  They want to brain damage your family.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.021]  They want to see you absolutely sterile and die in a cancer so they can suck all the money out of you.
[00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:01.521]  And they're never going to quit because they're the enemy.
[00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:03.902]  They will not coexist with us.
[00:24:05.342 --> 00:24:07.702]  They want to just absolutely rape everything.
[00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:10.723]  And they hate my guts because I know who they are.
[00:24:11.143 --> 00:24:14.323]  And now I realize even their low-level supporters are actually in on it.
[00:24:16.184 --> 00:24:17.064]  They were never liberals.
[00:24:17.104 --> 00:24:18.084]  They were always fake.
[00:24:19.326 --> 00:24:20.387]  They always had a plan.
[00:24:21.347 --> 00:24:22.348]  They don't coexist.
[00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:25.009]  They will absorb you and destroy you.
[00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.471]  Because they have envy.
[00:24:28.932 --> 00:24:31.793]  If you're a good person, they spiritually hate you.
[00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:36.296]  Now, coming up in the next segment, we're gonna go over all of it.
[00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:36.836]  It's huge.
[00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:37.757]  It's so important.
[00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:43.680]  Here's a brief clip of the Attorney General saying, yeah, they're criminally probing Hitlery.
[00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:44.281]  Here it is.
[00:24:45.213 --> 00:24:53.998]  I'd like to remind you that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein directly supervised the criminal case when he was U.S.
[00:24:54.058 --> 00:24:55.018]  Attorney in Maryland.
[00:24:55.539 --> 00:25:00.301]  I don't think it would be proper for him to supervise a review of his own conduct.
[00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:01.182]  Do you?
[00:25:02.449 --> 00:25:03.671]  It would be his decision.
[00:25:03.871 --> 00:25:05.753]  He's a man of integrity and ability.
[00:25:05.853 --> 00:25:22.772]  If he feels that he has an inability to proceed with any investigation, it would be his responsibility to make that determination and should consult, as I told you I would and as I have done, with the senior ethics people at the department.
[00:25:23.954 --> 00:25:29.740]  Reports suggest that the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars from interested parties in the transaction.
[00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:37.369]  Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech in Moscow June 2010 from the Russian government-aligned bank.
[00:25:37.847 --> 00:25:42.850]  The same month as the speech, Reische began the uranium acquisition process.
[00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:56.219]  This fact, uh, pattern raises serious concerns about improper political influence on the process by, uh, the previous, uh, by, by the Clintons during the Obama administration.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:06.466]  Has the Justice Department fully investigated whether the Russians compromised the Obama administration's decisions to smooth the way for transactions?
[00:26:06.566 --> 00:26:07.507]  And if not, why not?
[00:26:08.687 --> 00:26:12.909]  Mr. Chairman, we're working hard to maintain discipline in the department.
[00:26:12.949 --> 00:26:17.312]  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:22.154]  Wouldn't be proper for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[00:26:22.434 --> 00:26:23.554]  They're investigating Hillary.
[00:26:24.575 --> 00:26:26.576]  Now, where did you hear about Uranium One?
[00:26:28.017 --> 00:26:32.859]  Where did you hear about Podesta's time in the barrel was coming?
[00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:37.001]  Right here, last year, early in the campaign,
[00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:44.267]  Early in 2016, and then suddenly, Roger Stone and I, we were the Russians.
[00:26:45.028 --> 00:26:52.777]  Because we were the dutiful, dog-like, hound-like, patriot Americans, going after...
[00:26:53.717 --> 00:26:54.818]  The foreign manipulation.
[00:26:55.499 --> 00:27:00.504]  Now the only reason Russia's coming up is because they accused Trump of it and there's no evidence the Clintons are involved.
[00:27:00.804 --> 00:27:03.246]  Russia is nothing compared to the Chinese Communists.
[00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:09.592]  I mean, the Chinese Communists have basically taken over Hollywood, the mainstream media, half the Democratic Party.
[00:27:09.853 --> 00:27:13.016]  I mean, we are under deep espionage by the Chai cops.
[00:27:14.704 --> 00:27:16.205]  I'm not defending what Russia's done.
[00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:17.246]  We've exposed it.
[00:27:17.986 --> 00:27:20.047]  But it's all coming out now.
[00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:21.128]  How beautiful is that?
[00:27:21.468 --> 00:27:33.016]  And Mueller, of course, has been viciously going after Trump because he knows he's involved as a bag man with the Clintons and his law firm and the companies he's involved with personally getting the Russian money.
[00:27:33.516 --> 00:27:38.059]  And most of it's secret and covering up for the Clintons and blocking the investigation.
[00:27:40.063 --> 00:27:49.650]  Now ladies and gentlemen, because we're willing to break this first and force it out so a year and a half later, you're now seeing it in the news, we're the target.
[00:27:50.351 --> 00:27:53.793]  They have congressional hearings, they keep saying, the vector is InfoWars.
[00:27:54.314 --> 00:27:55.515]  The vector is Jones.
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:57.705]  The vector is drudge.
[00:27:58.546 --> 00:27:59.768]  They know the vectors.
[00:28:00.449 --> 00:28:08.318]  They know who keeps injecting truth, who is patient zero for the disease of liberty and awakening that will bring down their filthy tyranny.
[00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.061]  But they see us as a disease.
[00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:32.526]  So that's why you need to commit to financially support us and buy the t-shirts, the books, the videos, the supplements, all of them, and sign up for AutoShip and get an additional 10% off on the already great deals to commit because we're under massive attack all over the places you see and behind the scenes, I'm not going to get into at this point, but I will, by governments.
[00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:37.089]  State governments, federal, you name it, stay behind networks, globalists.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.483]  Disinfo squads, infiltration operations, you name it.
[00:28:41.523 --> 00:28:43.064]  We are the American Republic.
[00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:52.192]  We are the resistance, and we don't get Soros money from bankrupted, overthrown countries and Arab Springs, that murderer funds, that Nazi piece of garbage.
[00:28:52.493 --> 00:29:00.420]  We're funded by you, and if you'll fund us, I guarantee you this pledge, I've never given up, and I'm gonna ram these people right back to hell!
[00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:04.984]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:29:06.232 --> 00:29:11.575]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:29:11.815 --> 00:29:12.956]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:13.196 --> 00:29:15.517]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:29:16.178 --> 00:29:22.681]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:29:22.882 --> 00:29:26.223]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:29:26.544 --> 00:29:28.345]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:37.413]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:29:37.433 --> 00:29:38.394]  They know how great it is.
[00:29:39.315 --> 00:29:43.118]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:45.360]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:54.067]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:29:54.507 --> 00:30:01.332]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:30:02.013 --> 00:30:05.976]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:10.159]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:13.461]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:30:15.863 --> 00:30:16.743]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:28.067]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:36.708]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:37.849]  Concentrate.
[00:31:37.869 --> 00:31:39.670]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:41.352]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:31:41.572 --> 00:31:43.194]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:31:43.614 --> 00:31:44.475]  It's incredible.
[00:31:44.955 --> 00:31:46.857]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:48.198]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:49.559]  At 15, incredible.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.760]  It is amazing.
[00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:52.842]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:53.963]  50% off Caveman.
[00:31:54.184 --> 00:31:55.505]  But only a few days left.
[00:31:55.765 --> 00:31:56.506]  It's about to end.
[00:31:57.086 --> 00:31:59.428]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:31:59.868 --> 00:32:05.032]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:32:05.472 --> 00:32:06.853]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:32:07.073 --> 00:32:08.274]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:32:08.654 --> 00:32:09.455]  I want to thank you.
[00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:10.836]  We're all in this together.

[00:33:15.723 --> 00:33:19.785]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:24.446]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:33:24.887 --> 00:33:27.507]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.

[00:33:53.056 --> 00:33:53.356]  Alex Jones
[00:33:53.556 --> 00:33:55.478]  There's a guy on the radio.
[00:33:55.518 --> 00:33:56.519]  His name is Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:57.499]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.563]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:03.464]  Time to stop submitting to this parody!
[00:34:03.484 --> 00:34:05.726]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:34:06.026 --> 00:34:07.348]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:09.149]  InfoWars went even further.
[00:34:09.269 --> 00:34:12.412]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:34:12.672 --> 00:34:16.295]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:18.237]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:21.918]  At your own risk!
[00:34:21.998 --> 00:34:24.179]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.

[00:34:44.028 --> 00:34:45.329]  And that's what you should want!
[00:34:46.897 --> 00:34:52.441]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:34:55.544 --> 00:35:03.550]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:11.776]  Let's jump right into news that for our listeners and viewers is a year and a half old.
[00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:29.606]  It was February 2016, we first wrote articles and did live video slash radio reports, breaking down the previous FBI investigation under Robert Mueller, before Comey came in, of the Clintons selling out to Russia.
[00:35:30.186 --> 00:35:31.687]  Uranium deals, you name it.
[00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:36.089]  Gas prom, gas and oil deals.
[00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:39.350]  We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars to their foundation.
[00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:44.497]  Not just the millions total in speeches they gave in Moscow.
[00:35:44.897 --> 00:36:06.284]  Now imagine if Trump was giving uranium on the tarmac of some of the strongest, purest uranium ever discovered to the Federal Security Bureau, the FSB, or the equivalent of the Russian KGB.
[00:36:08.365 --> 00:36:09.286]  Slash FBI.
[00:36:09.786 --> 00:36:11.367]  They wear both hats in the FSB.
[00:36:12.268 --> 00:36:13.088]  Former KGB.
[00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:21.455]  Imagine if Trump was giving uranium in a silver James Bond style briefcase.
[00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:22.836]  To them.
[00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:24.417]  For Hillary Clinton.
[00:36:25.237 --> 00:36:26.838]  That's mainstream news.
[00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:32.703]  And then the same Mueller years later comes in as a special counsel
[00:36:34.838 --> 00:36:47.432]  Really a prosecutor and only goes after Trump and says, oh my gosh, Trump's son met for 10 minutes with a lady claiming that she had proof that Hillary was paid off by Russians.
[00:36:47.733 --> 00:36:49.535]  Of course the campaign was looking into that.
[00:36:49.695 --> 00:36:50.396]  They better be!
[00:36:52.628 --> 00:36:56.230]  But they didn't need to meet with her, it was in the New York Times in 2015!
[00:36:56.651 --> 00:36:58.932]  We've already covered this, but what's the big news?
[00:36:59.693 --> 00:37:15.303]  Now, in the Hill Report and others, and Hannity breaking it down, one of the few good outlets left on Fox, we have the documents, we have the witnesses, we have the FBI reports that were given to Mueller
[00:37:16.704 --> 00:37:38.800]  And then to Comey that were completely and totally killed because Mueller's law firm and companies that Mueller sits on the boards of are heavily invested with state-run mining and energy companies and gas companies and, wait for it, defense companies in Russia!
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.261]  And it's in the FBI investigation!
[00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:43.523]  Hillary as the Secretary of State was signing
[00:37:44.975 --> 00:37:45.475]  Waivers!
[00:37:45.836 --> 00:37:47.797]  Just as Tosh Plumlee told us on air.
[00:37:47.837 --> 00:37:49.017]  Let's get Tosh back on.
[00:37:50.118 --> 00:37:51.539]  Former CIA contractor.
[00:37:51.579 --> 00:37:52.139]  Very famous.
[00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:53.600]  Even involved the bad pigs.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.544]  Tosh Plumlee said, look, it's all about Hillary and the import-export bans that the State Department has.
[00:38:00.784 --> 00:38:03.525]  She's operating her own government under Obama, he said.
[00:38:03.545 --> 00:38:06.547]  This was the start of Obama's second term.
[00:38:07.227 --> 00:38:10.169]  And they are the ones flying the weapons in and out
[00:38:12.262 --> 00:38:21.886]  of the US, all over the world, and Fast and Furious was part of a weapons program into Mexico, into the Middle East, to fund the Arab Spring that started five years ago.
[00:38:22.586 --> 00:38:29.729]  Everything Tosh Plumlee told you was completely classified directly from NATO and the CIA and the Army.
[00:38:30.729 --> 00:38:35.471]  And a shadow group, in the shadow group, battling against this sellout of the country.
[00:38:36.872 --> 00:38:37.813]  They death-threatened him.
[00:38:38.033 --> 00:38:39.295]  The Justice Department called him.
[00:38:39.555 --> 00:38:40.316]  They threatened us.
[00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:41.697]  We moved forward.
[00:38:42.158 --> 00:38:44.360]  And I'm not telling you, hey, aren't we great.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.704]  I'm explaining to you that we've done what nobody else will do.
[00:38:47.904 --> 00:38:50.406]  We have executed on every cylinder.
[00:38:50.967 --> 00:38:52.168]  We have told you the truth.
[00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:53.570]  We have over-delivered.
[00:38:54.571 --> 00:38:56.233]  Because we're not giving in to the globalists.
[00:38:56.413 --> 00:38:57.214]  But you need to understand.
[00:38:59.414 --> 00:39:09.489]  They are coming after us with censorship and control and behind-the-scenes stuff that I'm not ready to get into yet, openly, to shut us down, you name it.
[00:39:09.549 --> 00:39:10.731]  And I'm just gonna stop right there.
[00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:13.395]  So we need your prayers.
[00:39:14.662 --> 00:39:24.549]  And we need your financial support and we need you more than that to spread the articles and the videos and get around the censors and the blocking on Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:26.751]  Hand deliver the stories.
[00:39:26.811 --> 00:39:27.331]  Print them off.
[00:39:27.812 --> 00:39:28.832]  Download the videos.
[00:39:28.892 --> 00:39:29.873]  Have your neighbors over.
[00:39:30.013 --> 00:39:30.494]  Show them!
[00:39:30.934 --> 00:39:36.278]  You can show them Google executives saying, number one goal, stop Alex Jones!
[00:39:37.981 --> 00:39:46.345]  Because they know who blew them wide open on the devil worship child molestation stuff that they had to then change the subject on and claim we'd retracted, totally made up.
[00:39:46.965 --> 00:39:48.786]  Who blew them wide open on the Russia issues?
[00:39:50.727 --> 00:39:52.628]  Who blew them wide open over and over again?
[00:39:52.808 --> 00:40:05.735]  InfoWars and our platform of guests, people like Colonel Schaeffer and Dr. Corsi and Matt Drudge who came here exclusively almost two years ago and laid out everything to you that was going to happen in the next few years from
[00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:12.677]  A high-level Supreme Court Justice and other people who've been even higher in the government.
[00:40:13.197 --> 00:40:14.257]  And I'm going to stop right there.
[00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:29.302]  We've had sources at the highest levels of this plan, because there were people who weren't perfect, but they weren't out to get America, and they didn't want to bankrupt the country, and they didn't want to transfer our power to Communist China.
[00:40:30.582 --> 00:40:35.764]  They're the globalists selling the country out, and they know we're awake, they know we're informed, and they're scared.
[00:40:37.042 --> 00:40:47.359]  When we come back, I'm going to play a boil down of the Judiciary Committee hearings and then excerpts of Hannity last night where they did break a lot of new info, but confirming everything we told you 19 months ago.
[00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:56.717]  Everything that we broke down here, no wonder they called us Russian spies.
[00:40:57.238 --> 00:41:07.405]  What are you going to do when you're on tarmac with uranium illegally for Hillary, transferring it to the Russians, and then Hillary's doing deals selling out one third of our uranium to Uranium One?
[00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:14.470]  What are you going to do when you're the international globalist selling out nation states to the highest bidder, actual traders?
[00:41:16.591 --> 00:41:17.172]  What are you going to do?
[00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.894]  You're going to blame your enemies, the American people, for what you are.
[00:41:23.194 --> 00:41:25.135]  We're the people getting us out of TPP.
[00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:28.358]  We're the folks getting us out of globalism, unelected groups.
[00:41:28.858 --> 00:41:38.726]  We're the patriots fighting to get the jobs back, to take care of the veterans, to cut the taxes, to get the economy going, to stabilize the republic, to cut the size of the federal government.
[00:41:39.387 --> 00:41:43.530]  And we're delivering, delivering, delivering, delivering, because you
[00:41:45.014 --> 00:41:51.777]  The American people, of every race, color, and creed, who are just one race, red-blooded humans, understand what's happening.
[00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:53.818]  And understand what the elite's doing.
[00:41:53.998 --> 00:42:00.822]  And know when you see the whole mainstream media against somebody, you know they're the establishment, and you know who they're attacking is the good guys.
[00:42:01.282 --> 00:42:03.963]  And you know we're fighting as hard as we can right here with you.
[00:42:04.263 --> 00:42:09.146]  But you better understand, there's a civil war in this country right now, in information warfare.
[00:42:09.466 --> 00:42:13.488]  They're trying to start a physical one to beat up and attack and intimidate everybody.
[00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:17.402]  So that we supposedly back down and give up.
[00:42:17.683 --> 00:42:18.686]  Let me tell you something.
[00:42:19.228 --> 00:42:21.536]  I got so much energy fighting you people.
[00:42:22.884 --> 00:42:26.507]  That I absolutely love it that I'm enemy number one next to Trump.
[00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:35.052]  My only frustration is that I can't execute good enough to take you down and I'm not strong enough or smart enough to get you faster!
[00:42:35.072 --> 00:42:39.035]  I'm so angry at myself for not doing more and not being stronger!
[00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:47.241]  Because I've seen every angle they got coming and I usually don't even execute on it when we'd have total victory if I started truly executing!
[00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:53.783]  But I swear before God on the altar of liberty, eternal resistance to you, to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[00:42:54.123 --> 00:42:58.605]  And I ask God to take full control of me and help me do a better job.
[00:42:58.625 --> 00:43:00.025]  We'll be back.
[00:43:00.065 --> 00:43:00.666]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.686 --> 00:43:04.247]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:43:05.512 --> 00:43:10.836]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:43:11.096 --> 00:43:12.237]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:12.477 --> 00:43:14.779]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:21.964]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:43:22.164 --> 00:43:25.506]  So I'm offering, for the first time ever, 50% off.
[00:43:25.826 --> 00:43:27.628]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:36.698]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:43:36.718 --> 00:43:37.679]  They know how great it is.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.384]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:44.646]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:43:45.467 --> 00:43:53.352]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:43:53.792 --> 00:44:02.278]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:05.240]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.422]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:44:09.843 --> 00:44:12.745]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:44:15.146 --> 00:44:16.006]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:44:16.106 --> 00:44:27.349]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:20.672]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[00:45:21.392 --> 00:45:26.722]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:45:27.082 --> 00:45:34.495]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen.
[00:45:35.518 --> 00:45:36.019]  And more.
[00:45:36.499 --> 00:45:37.140]  Concentrate.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.942]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:45:39.202 --> 00:45:40.564]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:45:40.584 --> 00:45:42.466]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:45:42.886 --> 00:45:43.767]  It's incredible.
[00:45:44.228 --> 00:45:46.150]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.292]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[00:45:48.372 --> 00:45:48.853]  Incredible.
[00:45:49.173 --> 00:45:50.054]  It is amazing.
[00:45:50.415 --> 00:45:52.117]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:52.457 --> 00:45:53.238]  50% off Caveman.
[00:45:53.458 --> 00:45:54.800]  But only a few days left.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.781]  It's about to end.
[00:45:56.381 --> 00:45:58.702]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:45:59.142 --> 00:46:04.304]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:46:04.744 --> 00:46:06.125]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:46:06.385 --> 00:46:07.545]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:46:07.925 --> 00:46:08.726]  I want to thank you.
[00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.106]  We're all in this together.
[00:46:10.626 --> 00:46:20.550]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:46:24.933 --> 00:46:26.735]  But these specials have got to end.
[00:46:26.755 --> 00:46:36.683]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:46:36.944 --> 00:46:42.288]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:47.433]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[00:46:48.053 --> 00:46:55.695]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:56.055 --> 00:47:00.876]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:47:06.037 --> 00:47:08.657]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.919 --> 00:47:37.814]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:40.692 --> 00:47:56.744]  So, America was down but not out, and is now awakening to the unelected global government that's been set up by a bunch of ruthless, psychopathic devil worshippers.
[00:47:57.405 --> 00:47:58.666]  And it's all gonna come out.
[00:47:59.926 --> 00:48:06.912]  In fact, reportedly Julian Assange coming up in just a few weeks is gonna drop the motherlode hammer
[00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.848]  on Mueller and all of his Russian collusion.
[00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:12.909]  So get ready for that.
[00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:19.393]  He kept waiting to see if Mueller would drop the made-up Trump investigation and actually go after the Clintons, but he hasn't.
[00:48:19.473 --> 00:48:22.415]  So that's all going to be coming, reportedly.
[00:48:23.507 --> 00:48:28.829]  According to our boffins at 4chan who have been proven to be about a thousand times more accurate than CNN.
[00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:35.491]  But look at these tweets from El Presidente, Donald John Trump, the guy that would never be president.
[00:48:36.052 --> 00:48:36.452]  Wow!
[00:48:36.632 --> 00:48:45.135]  FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary long before investigation was complete.
[00:48:46.015 --> 00:48:47.756]  We told you that a month ago?
[00:48:48.772 --> 00:48:51.814]  I just love how mainstream media always sits on stuff.
[00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:56.316]  You literally get news here days, weeks, months, or years, or decades before.
[00:48:56.336 --> 00:48:57.416]  I mean, it's just true!
[00:48:58.597 --> 00:48:59.377]  That's why they hate us.
[00:48:59.878 --> 00:49:02.919]  Because, see, we'll put it out there first when we have the documentation.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.261]  Or other great researchers will have them on.
[00:49:06.301 --> 00:49:08.862]  We're just a big focal point of human intelligence.
[00:49:09.983 --> 00:49:12.764]  And then it builds and builds and then forces out mainstream.
[00:49:12.844 --> 00:49:14.125]  I mean, that's why they hate us.
[00:49:15.563 --> 00:49:18.084]  And I just keep telling you that because they're coming after us, folks.
[00:49:18.104 --> 00:49:18.985]  They're coming after you.
[00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:22.607]  They're coming after anybody that stands up for you when you stand up with us.
[00:49:23.567 --> 00:49:24.047]  Here's Trump.
[00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:27.609]  People not interviewed, including Clinton herself.
[00:49:28.089 --> 00:49:33.512]  Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this, obviously, a fix.
[00:49:34.813 --> 00:49:38.055]  Again, Comey stated under oath that he did not do this, but he did.
[00:49:38.335 --> 00:49:39.135]  It's obviously a fix.
[00:49:39.475 --> 00:49:40.736]  Where is the Justice Department?
[00:49:42.383 --> 00:49:44.404]  These are Trump's tweets last night.
[00:49:44.684 --> 00:49:48.786]  As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:49.126 --> 00:49:51.367]  He was the best thing that ever happened to her.
[00:49:53.488 --> 00:49:55.449]  And he lied and said that he didn't leak the memos.
[00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.629]  But he did.
[00:49:56.649 --> 00:49:59.110]  And then he lied about what was in the memos.
[00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:10.015]  I mean, of course, they're a pack of literal criminals colluding with Russia, China, and everybody else, shelling us out to the TPP that would have more power than Congress.
[00:50:11.564 --> 00:50:19.182]  Rick Linklater is in the Daily Beast article asking famous director, friend of mine, I wouldn't even call him Hollywood, he's Austin.
[00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.527]  He's a good director, smart guy.
[00:50:22.742 --> 00:50:26.466]  He's like, I don't know why Alex was always anti-establishment, but now he seems to be pro-establishment.
[00:50:26.706 --> 00:50:27.747]  Pro-establishment?
[00:50:28.007 --> 00:50:34.334]  You've got the whole global government, the megabanks, the power structure, trying to stop Trump from jump-starting the economy.
[00:50:34.935 --> 00:50:38.719]  Trump's like a medic with defibrillators, trying to shock my heart back.
[00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:42.663]  He could be a bank robber I'd still want him to turn my heart back on, but he's not!
[00:50:44.008 --> 00:50:45.312]  Trump is a champion.
[00:50:45.612 --> 00:50:46.635]  Trump is demonized.
[00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:48.219]  Thousands of lawsuits against him.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.082]  Death threats.
[00:50:49.322 --> 00:50:50.566]  His whole family is under attack.
[00:50:50.927 --> 00:50:52.591]  And I am a fellow traveler.
[00:50:54.225 --> 00:50:57.588]  I am experiencing what Trump is experiencing to a lesser degree.
[00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:01.052]  And it makes me absolutely see him as a kindred spirit.
[00:51:01.132 --> 00:51:06.076]  We are brothers in arms in the battle for America in the second American Revolution.
[00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.358]  So you bet, Rick Linklater.
[00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:10.961]  Who said nice stuff about me in the article?
[00:51:10.981 --> 00:51:12.222]  They tried to get him to do a hit piece.
[00:51:12.482 --> 00:51:13.964]  He's promoting his new film.
[00:51:16.852 --> 00:51:18.533]  And they're saying, why'd you put him in movies, you know?
[00:51:18.793 --> 00:51:19.774]  Was he like this before?
[00:51:20.295 --> 00:51:24.037]  Like this before, I was anti-establishment because the globalists were in full control.
[00:51:24.358 --> 00:51:25.939]  This is our counter-revolution.
[00:51:26.759 --> 00:51:29.542]  This is us trying to take the flag back, and we're having victory!
[00:51:30.883 --> 00:51:31.923]  To total war!
[00:51:33.965 --> 00:51:35.006]  This isn't hype, folks!
[00:51:35.066 --> 00:51:36.647]  Look around you, what's going on!
[00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:38.268]  This is epic!
[00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.731]  And we're winning every special election.
[00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:45.500]  Libertarians are taking the Republican Party over.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:52.024]  Our vision that we launched 10 years ago with the Tea Party to take over the Republican Party is happening.
[00:51:52.924 --> 00:51:53.765]  It's unfolding.
[00:51:53.805 --> 00:51:57.627]  We're promoting an ideology that's popular and sexy and successful.
[00:51:57.767 --> 00:52:03.270]  We're promoting 57 Chevys and Marilyn Monroe against a North Korean or Venezuelan model.
[00:52:03.671 --> 00:52:07.493]  We're going to win if we execute prosperity!
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.223]  The only problem is, can you handle all the success?
[00:52:12.403 --> 00:52:13.845]  Can you handle all the choices?
[00:52:14.065 --> 00:52:14.926]  Can you handle it?
[00:52:14.946 --> 00:52:19.832]  Or will you let a bunch of outside globalist scum come in and take it all over?
[00:52:22.075 --> 00:52:23.637]  So Trump's calling Comey a liar?
[00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:25.510]  He is a liar!
[00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:30.493]  Senate Judiciary Committee probe into Obama-Russian nuclear bribery case is criminal.
[00:52:30.713 --> 00:52:31.133]  The hell?
[00:52:31.413 --> 00:52:31.794]  Boom!
[00:52:32.474 --> 00:52:40.458]  Attorney that worked with Mueller says Mueller hid Russian bribery scandal from Congress, must resign now, was a corrupt attorney.
[00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:45.821]  Sean Hannity discusses Uranium One scandal with Sarah Carter and John Solomon.
[00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:47.662]  Trump hits back at McCain.
[00:52:47.722 --> 00:52:48.202]  Be careful!
[00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:49.743]  At some point, I fight back!
[00:52:51.838 --> 00:52:54.001]  God's already fighting back against old John McCain.
[00:52:54.762 --> 00:53:03.072]  That's all coming up, but right now let's go to this compilation of Hannity and the Judiciary Committee with the Attorney General saying Hillary is under criminal investigation.
[00:53:03.712 --> 00:53:04.734]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:53:05.947 --> 00:53:10.071]  Democrats are concerned that Russia has tampered with our election results in 2016.
[00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:14.455]  Well, six years before that, they tampered with our nuclear security.
[00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:24.865]  The case proved that Russia's nuclear industry had bribed their way and compromised the American trucking company that moved all of Russia's uranium in the United States.
[00:53:25.326 --> 00:53:26.947]  That's a national security threat.
[00:53:27.328 --> 00:53:30.491]  And for two years, the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton,
[00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:40.558]  And everybody who's been quoted has said the Obama administration had no knowledge of a national security threat, and that's why they didn't have any problem approving the Uranium One deal.
[00:53:40.778 --> 00:53:41.278]  Well, guess what?
[00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:48.743]  Tonight, we have a real national security threat that was proven in real time in 2009, and it's going to be interesting to see what Congress does.
[00:53:48.783 --> 00:53:55.027]  Tomorrow morning, Chuck Grassley has a hearing with Jeff Sessions on the seat, and I think you might see some interesting questions.
[00:53:55.187 --> 00:54:00.171]  I want to ask a question that looks like history, but it was in the news recently.
[00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:16.276]  Uh, yesterday I believe, according to government documents and recent news reports, the Justice Department had an ongoing criminal investigation for bribery, extortion, and money laundering into officials for the rice and company making the purchase of Uranium One.
[00:54:17.117 --> 00:54:26.502]  That purchase was approved during the previous administration and resulted in the Russians owning 20% of America's uranium mining capacity.
[00:54:26.682 --> 00:54:40.388]  What are you doing to find out how the Russian takeover of the American uranium was allowed to occur despite criminal conduct by the Russian company that the Obama administration approved to make the purchase?
[00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:43.090]  Mr. Chairman, we will
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.540]  I hear your concerns.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:51.382]  The Department of Justice will take such actions as is appropriate, I know.
[00:54:52.222 --> 00:55:01.265]  And I would offer that some people have gone to jail in that transaction already, but the article talks about other issues.
[00:55:01.845 --> 00:55:10.168]  So, without confirming or denying the existence of any particular investigation, I would say I hear your concerns and they will be reviewed.
[00:55:11.108 --> 00:55:16.211]  This is stunning that the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, hid the information.
[00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:33.601]  He knew about the bribery, the kickbacks, the extortion, the money, and he also knew as well as Hillary and had to sign off along with Hillary Clinton on the deal even though that we know that they're trying to influence every aspect of our security and get control over America's uranium.
[00:55:34.342 --> 00:55:36.363]  They still allowed the deal to go through?
[00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.110]  Well, and these are many of the same players, right?
[00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.451]  You had Rod Rosenstein.
[00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:45.731]  Rod Rosenstein then was head of this investigation when he was in Maryland, looking at the trucking company.
[00:55:45.772 --> 00:55:46.392]  And remember this.
[00:55:46.412 --> 00:55:46.712]  That's right.
[00:55:46.812 --> 00:55:52.693]  You have a trucking company that's moving American uranium that is involving... And he's the one that puts Mueller in to take down the president.
[00:55:52.753 --> 00:55:57.333]  ...all kinds of issues, and they're moving a national security asset, uranium.
[00:55:57.414 --> 00:56:04.375]  And you have Andrew McCain, who's the deputy director of the FBI now, who was also charged with that investigation.
[00:56:04.555 --> 00:56:05.715]  These people are literally...
[00:56:06.115 --> 00:56:07.476]  Is Mueller involved in this?
[00:56:08.376 --> 00:56:08.656]  Yes!
[00:56:09.076 --> 00:56:10.897]  And Mueller, who was in charge then of the FBI.
[00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:12.137]  How does he investigate himself?
[00:56:12.658 --> 00:56:19.680]  So we got Mueller having to investigate his boss now, Rod Rosenstein, who also, and Andrew McCabe of the FBI, and probably James Comey.
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:20.621]  They all knew about this.
[00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:22.922]  That's exactly what we're looking at.
[00:56:25.051 --> 00:56:25.712]  Back up a few seconds.
[00:56:25.732 --> 00:56:26.533]  You notice what's happening.
[00:56:27.073 --> 00:56:29.596]  This is going to hurt the country in many ways when this all comes out.
[00:56:29.656 --> 00:56:30.538]  So they held back.
[00:56:31.098 --> 00:56:36.765]  And they're still trying to put Trump and his family in prison or overthrow him, saying they're Russian agents, when there's no connections.
[00:56:37.125 --> 00:56:39.428]  And you've got the Democrats weren't Russian agents.
[00:56:39.488 --> 00:56:45.115]  They were just pimping us like America was a whore for $2 out to whoever'd buy it.
[00:56:46.377 --> 00:56:51.539]  I mean, these are like pimps that got 50 Johns out the door, and the Johns are putting cigarettes out on the woman's face.
[00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:56.421]  Kind of, you know, last leg before they shoot the woman in the back of the head and throw her in the river.
[00:56:56.841 --> 00:57:13.027]  And that's how the globalists were treating America, and now they're so angry and so upset that the sleeping giant finally woke back up and threw these monsters off of us, and we're stumbling out the hotel room door, hoping we can find our family somewhere down the road after we just got gang-raped by 10,000 dudes.
[00:57:14.568 --> 00:57:17.709]  And CNN and all of them are pissed, because they hate us.
[00:57:17.769 --> 00:57:22.929]  They wanted to degradate us and bring us down, just like they want to sexualize your children.
[00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:24.490]  They get off on it.
[00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:26.630]  Now, financially support us.
[00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.891]  We've got some of the biggest sales ever that are absolutely about to end.
[00:57:29.911 --> 00:57:31.571]  50% off Brain Force.
[00:57:31.951 --> 00:57:34.431]  We've got 50% off on some other products.
[00:57:34.511 --> 00:57:36.752]  Anthroplex, never done that before.
[00:57:36.772 --> 00:57:37.752]  30% off Supermail Vitality.

[00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:50.377]  But just commit to financially support us, because the globalists absolutely hate it, and we're going to defeat them and crush them if you keep supporting us, so fund us now!
[00:57:52.958 --> 00:58:04.645]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:58:05.225 --> 00:58:07.307]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:58:07.487 --> 00:58:10.308]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:58:10.749 --> 00:58:12.049]  It's made in the USA.
[00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.830]  It's
[00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:21.075]  Filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.376]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:58:23.876 --> 00:58:27.678]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:34.903]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[00:58:36.047 --> 00:58:36.147]  Yes.
[00:58:58.157 --> 00:58:58.657]  When it comes
[00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:27.652]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:59:27.733 --> 00:59:35.999]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:59:36.199 --> 00:59:42.924]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:59:43.917 --> 00:59:47.718]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:59:48.159 --> 00:59:49.499]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:59:50.139 --> 00:59:52.540]  With Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:55.321 --> 01:00:01.263]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:15.240]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:23.946]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:30.491]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:41.689]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, hour number two.
[01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:50.437]  I have one of the top coordinators, the John Birch Society, joining us for a couple segments coming up in about 20 minutes to talk about the danger of a constitutional convention.
[01:00:51.598 --> 01:00:56.662]  I know it sounds like a good way to get things done, but they could totally rewrite the whole Constitution during one.
[01:00:57.063 --> 01:00:59.265]  They'd probably stage a big crisis in the middle of one.
[01:00:59.285 --> 01:01:04.629]  So we're going to look at that and how far we've come exposing globalism, and then
[01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:13.883]  I do intend to open the phones up and Gerald Cilente joins us the last 30 minutes of the third hour and then Roger Stone joins us.
[01:01:13.923 --> 01:01:14.923]  Talk about vindicated.
[01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:23.767]  Everything Roger Stone wrote down here a year and a half ago has now come out about the Russia situation and more.
[01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:28.169]  Weapons secrets transferred by Hillary, simply amazing and now
[01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:35.061]  We have congressional hearings with Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, saying Hillary is under criminal investigation.
[01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:38.183]  He says, I will not get into things that are ongoing investigations.
[01:01:38.203 --> 01:01:39.343]  They ask, is she being investigated?
[01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.445]  He said, well, I won't get into ongoing investigations.
[01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:42.025]  What's that tell you?
[01:01:43.706 --> 01:01:47.288]  And so we know that the whole Uranium One thing is now coming out.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:02:00.746]  It was a total FBI report spiked by Mueller, spiked by Comey, and they were, you know, bag men delivering it, getting money themselves, literal bag men on tarmacs, the case of Mueller.
[01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:07.750]  And so that's why they're so frothing to stopping, because they just committed gargantuan crimes.
[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:12.511]  And let foreign governments, you know, Pakistan run the DNC computers.
[01:02:12.572 --> 01:02:13.872]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:15.753]  This is such over-the-top stuff.
[01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:18.874]  It's mind-boggling they got away with this much.
[01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:26.317]  Then coming up, Trump tells McCain, you listen here, buddy, I fight back and I'm getting ready to slap you upside your little head politically.
[01:02:26.717 --> 01:02:28.137]  So we're going to have that coming up as well.
[01:02:28.557 --> 01:02:35.280]  And then some other incredible news I haven't gotten to yet dealing with the missing security guard that popped up on CNN that's best buddies with the Mandalay owners.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.542]  Turns out DeGeneres is invested in MGM as well, big time.
[01:02:39.562 --> 01:02:40.263]  That's coming up.
[01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.063]  Conflict of interest.
[01:02:41.363 --> 01:02:46.827]  But here's more of the Hannity report last night that was groundbreaking in many ways, just for the fact that it's on mainstream news.
[01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:49.108]  And we do have more intel.
[01:02:49.128 --> 01:02:51.530]  It was much worse than we even thought, but we were on target.
[01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.070]  It was just the rat hole was deeper.
[01:02:53.591 --> 01:02:56.212]  We targeted the rat hole correctly, but only went down a few levels.
[01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:59.895]  It got even worse as the basement fell into a whole other sub-level.
[01:03:00.934 --> 01:03:01.915]  Who knows what's beneath that.
[01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:03.577]  Devil worshipping pedophiles, of course.
[01:03:04.539 --> 01:03:07.662]  That's what's at the bottom of this globalist rainbow.
[01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:10.626]  It's not a leprechaun and it's not a pot of gold.
[01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.448]  It's a pot-bellied pedophile, devil worshipped nest.
[01:03:12.869 --> 01:03:13.670]  Let's go ahead and finish the club.
[01:03:14.831 --> 01:03:23.863]  I would like to remind you that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein directly supervised the criminal case when he was U.S.
[01:03:23.923 --> 01:03:24.864]  Attorney in Maryland.
[01:03:25.405 --> 01:03:30.171]  I don't think it would be proper for him to supervise a review of his own conduct.
[01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:31.052]  Do you?
[01:03:32.293 --> 01:03:33.534]  It would be his decision.
[01:03:33.734 --> 01:03:35.615]  He's a man of integrity and ability.
[01:03:35.715 --> 01:03:52.605]  If he feels that he has an inability to proceed with any investigation, it would be his responsibility to make that determination and should consult, as I told you I would and as I have done, with the senior ethics people at the department.
[01:03:53.505 --> 01:03:54.946]  Imagine if Trump did that.
[01:04:23.705 --> 01:04:26.067]  ...by the Clintons during the Obama administration.
[01:04:26.528 --> 01:04:36.316]  Has the Justice Department fully investigated whether the Russians compromised the Obama administration's decisions to smooth the way for transactions?
[01:04:36.396 --> 01:04:37.336]  And if not, why not?
[01:04:38.544 --> 01:04:42.769]  Mr. Chairman, we're working hard to maintain discipline in the department.
[01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:47.173]  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[01:04:47.534 --> 01:04:50.056]  There you go, Hillary's under criminal investigation.
[01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:51.117]  No other way to read that.
[01:04:51.257 --> 01:04:56.443]  Finally, the republic like the phoenix from the ashes is rising.
[01:04:57.144 --> 01:04:57.824]  They want a fight?
[01:04:58.725 --> 01:04:59.666]  They're scared now.
[01:04:59.686 --> 01:05:01.228]  They understand we want one.
[01:05:04.744 --> 01:05:09.647]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:13.370]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:16.852]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:05:17.473 --> 01:05:22.356]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:05:22.716 --> 01:05:29.020]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:34.544]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:05:35.204 --> 01:05:38.645]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:05:39.205 --> 01:05:47.027]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:05:47.607 --> 01:05:51.928]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:56.209]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.

[01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.231]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:11.237 --> 01:06:17.822]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:17.842 --> 01:06:20.104]  You better believe you got one!
[01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:27.791]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.012 --> 01:06:34.016]  That little snippet was from a speech I gave in Dallas seven years ago.
[01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:37.058]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[01:06:38.259 --> 01:06:39.060]  Do you want to fight?
[01:06:40.325 --> 01:06:42.086]  You better believe you got one.
[01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:47.090]  And now the globalists have got that fight they've been looking for.
[01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.992]  And they're hitting the alarm buttons everywhere.
[01:06:50.453 --> 01:06:51.413]  They're getting indicted.
[01:06:51.453 --> 01:06:58.118]  They're getting overthrown in elections from Australia to Austria to the UK to the US to Brazil.
[01:06:58.238 --> 01:07:00.160]  They are in full panic mode.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.444]  And I know, I've told my crew, this Russia thing is a pack of bull.
[01:07:05.504 --> 01:07:06.365]  We all know it is.
[01:07:07.435 --> 01:07:11.118]  But let's stop covering it and defending ourselves, because I'm sick of hearing about it.
[01:07:11.659 --> 01:07:13.901]  Let's fight the globalists on everything else they're doing.
[01:07:13.921 --> 01:07:19.345]  And let's talk about getting the economy going again and jump-starting the nation and moving forward.
[01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:23.849]  But now it's big news because Mueller covered up the investigation.
[01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:24.510]  Comey did.
[01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:25.611]  They lied to Congress.
[01:07:26.131 --> 01:07:27.472]  They transferred uranium.
[01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:30.355]  Mueller was a bag man doing it.
[01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:37.561]  I mean, it's just incredible that everything they've said Trump did, they've done.
[01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:50.655]  I liken this to, say, a divorce proceeding, where your husband is the judge and you're the wife, and then the judge sits over the hearing of his own children and takes them away from the wife.
[01:07:51.684 --> 01:07:56.808]  Or, your wife is the family court judge, and you're the husband, and she takes him away from you.
[01:07:57.508 --> 01:08:05.394]  It'd be like Hitler sitting at Nuremberg in judgment in 1946, in Germany for the Nuremberg trials.
[01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:16.702]  And Hitler's up there, calling in Hermann Goering, and calling in all these other guys, and saying, how dare you do this for Hitler?
[01:08:17.381 --> 01:08:19.222]  They're like, Mein Fuhrer, you are the judge!
[01:08:19.302 --> 01:08:21.524]  I followed your orders, Mein Fuhrer!
[01:08:22.844 --> 01:08:30.349]  My Liebling, my Liebchen, my leader, my Gautleiter, my Gruppenfuhrer!
[01:08:31.009 --> 01:08:32.250]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[01:08:34.091 --> 01:08:41.236]  You'd say, Hitler cannot be the Chief Justice over the Nuremberg Tribunal.
[01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:46.548]  Let's pull up some photos of the Nuremberg Tribunal, please, the Nuremberg Court.
[01:08:47.168 --> 01:08:48.249]  Put those on screen for TV viewers.
[01:08:48.549 --> 01:09:02.416]  Remember, if you're a radio listener listening on, over 200 of our wondrous affiliates across the United States, please support those local stations, support their local sponsors, become a sponsor, send them a weekly or monthly tithe in the Information Warb.
[01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:11.901]  But whatever you do, remember you can always tell your friends and family that may not be in your listening area about InfoWars.com.
[01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:15.264]  Forward slash show!
[01:09:16.905 --> 01:09:19.887]  Or all the other platforms and podcasts and things where people can pick it up.
[01:09:20.167 --> 01:09:22.029]  It's the sharing of the live link.
[01:09:22.449 --> 01:09:26.352]  It's the sharing of it on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, that gets around the censors.
[01:09:27.592 --> 01:09:30.674]  And now has us reaching close to 60 million people a week.
[01:09:31.595 --> 01:09:33.857]  Our peak was 87 million the week of the election.
[01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:36.258]  Our previous peak was 40 million or so, 41 million.
[01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:40.141]  Now, our new peaks are 60 million.
[01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:44.111]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is exponential.
[01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:46.912]  So it's got the enemy scared, though, and they're coming after us.
[01:09:46.952 --> 01:09:47.912]  So that's all coming up.
[01:09:48.873 --> 01:09:55.255]  Also, anti-Trump Dems exploit vets to attack Trump right after backing NFL's take a knee.
[01:09:56.335 --> 01:10:06.099]  And they've gone and dug up a few wives of troops that have died and a few Congresswomen speaking for the wives, basically saying Trump hates the military.
[01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:08.540]  Totally fake, contrived, made-up situation.
[01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:18.105]  Also, everybody always talks about the Kurds being the perfect angels in the Middle East, and that's because they're a kind of in-between group that hasn't been very expansionist.
[01:10:19.026 --> 01:10:21.249]  But they have been working with
[01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:26.371]  Some of the other groups in the area to help push out Christians and take over their land as well.
[01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:27.451]  So we should remember that.
[01:10:27.631 --> 01:10:35.973]  There's an article on Infowars.com how Kurds used ISIS and Antifa, well they came and fought, to expel Christians in the Middle East.
[01:10:36.013 --> 01:10:39.774]  The Antifa came, they're aligned with the Kurds and they enjoy the anti-Christian bent.
[01:10:39.994 --> 01:10:40.974]  There's even videos of it.
[01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:44.155]  I mean, let me tell you folks, leftists see Christians as their enemies.
[01:10:45.855 --> 01:10:48.356]  And even if a Muslim's gonna kill them if they're gay, they don't care.
[01:10:48.616 --> 01:10:49.716]  That's liberal and trendy.
[01:10:50.575 --> 01:10:53.817]  But if you're just a mainline Christian, you've got to be killed.
[01:10:55.698 --> 01:10:56.698]  It's just a, it's a cult.
[01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.320]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.821]  And then we've got this report coming up.
[01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:08.625]  Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up to the middle column on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:19.651]  That's why I like the Drudge Design better than InfoWars, because he can have a hundred articles if he wants, and stuff that's important from yesterday can still be on the site if it ties in with some new breaking news.
[01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:24.882]  So he can add things that, you know, add to the research, add to the information.
[01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:30.863]  InfoWars bombshell story yesterday afternoon, scrolls off in a few hours, and then you can't even find it on our site.
[01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:37.285]  But it's a big article by Don Salazar in the middle column of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:37.385 --> 01:11:38.925]  We're going to be getting into that as well.
[01:11:39.766 --> 01:11:48.688]  But first, here is a clip of Trump doing a radio interview, talking about the fact that if McCain thinks
[01:11:49.882 --> 01:11:54.743]  That he's just going to be able to keep coming after him and making stuff up and doing all this.
[01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.564]  Well, that Trump is going to hit back.
[01:11:58.224 --> 01:12:04.446]  And the story, again, is up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and is a really important story.
[01:12:04.466 --> 01:12:06.166]  It's a Steve Watson article.
[01:12:06.607 --> 01:12:07.907]  Trump hits back at McCain.
[01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:08.487]  Be careful.
[01:12:08.787 --> 01:12:10.228]  At some point, I fight back.
[01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:11.748]  It won't be pretty.
[01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:15.089]  I think God already struck old McCain-y.
[01:12:16.485 --> 01:12:17.286]  Or karma did.
[01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:19.587]  Let's go ahead and play that clip of the president.
[01:12:20.488 --> 01:12:22.850]  Do you think it'll be in good shape by the midterms?
[01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.971]  I think so.
[01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:25.071]  I think we'll have a lot done.
[01:12:25.131 --> 01:12:30.415]  We need some votes from some of the Republicans that for some reason they weren't there on health care.
[01:12:30.455 --> 01:12:30.996]  They should have been.
[01:12:31.036 --> 01:12:34.618]  We thought we had it, but John McCain voted no, which was a shocker.
[01:12:34.658 --> 01:12:36.620]  We were taking shots at you again yesterday.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:42.545]  Well, it's a shocker and, you know... You heard what he said yesterday, Senator McCain.
[01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:47.149]  Yeah, well, I hear it and people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.
[01:12:47.749 --> 01:12:49.070]  You know, I'm being very nice.
[01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:50.551]  I'm being very, very nice.
[01:12:50.852 --> 01:12:53.214]  But at some point I fight back and it won't be pretty.
[01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:57.758]  Okay, so that is the Chris Plant Show.
[01:12:57.778 --> 01:12:59.640]  Got that great interview with the President.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.824]  That is powerful information right there.
[01:13:03.224 --> 01:13:07.228]  And again, the President has come out and called Mueller a liar to his arrogant face.
[01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:11.873]  Mueller acts all powerful and struts into Congress like he's the President, like he got elected.
[01:13:12.634 --> 01:13:36.229]  When I'm not on the tarmac at secret Russia meetings with the KGB, FSB, transferring uranium for Hillary illegally, which they admit, and when I'm not blocking criminal investigations of the FBI into her and Bill selling out our military secrets and one-third of our uranium, I'm out trying to bring down the elected president, defeat this country, and calling the president a liar when he said that Obama didn't call many servicemen.
[01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:37.930]  I remember it in the news!
[01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:46.997]  Four years ago, three years ago, that Obama wasn't visiting service people very often, and that he wasn't calling all of them, that was a thing that U.S.
[01:13:47.057 --> 01:13:49.678]  presidents had always tried to do before.
[01:13:50.818 --> 01:13:56.260]  You obviously can't in World War II where you get hundreds of thousands of dead people, but it's a serious situation.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:07.844]  They're a pack of lying scum, and you just look at Mueller, who covered up for the Clinton crime syndicate, and Obama, and the Bushes, and 9-11, and the Saudi Arabian connection, and the 9-11 stand-down that we're totally vindicated on now.
[01:14:09.053 --> 01:14:12.056]  With a congressional 28 pages, it is simply incredible.
[01:14:13.557 --> 01:14:15.278]  And Trump was against the Iraq War.
[01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:17.200]  They always lie and say he wasn't.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.481]  I've played the clips here.
[01:14:18.741 --> 01:14:20.763]  But again, that's because CNN was.
[01:14:21.103 --> 01:14:22.425]  And the fake left was.
[01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:25.267]  And they know how pathetically discredited they are.
[01:14:25.968 --> 01:14:27.149]  Here's an LA Times article.
[01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:28.950]  There's also one in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:36.677]  George Soros has pumped $18 billion into open society foundations, making it a philanthropic giant.
[01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:44.657]  Yeah, overthrowing the elected government of Ukraine, funding the Arab Spring that killed over a million people, mainly Christians, gays, women, and priests.
[01:14:45.478 --> 01:14:46.258]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:14:46.558 --> 01:14:47.379]  What a wonderful guy.
[01:14:47.619 --> 01:14:53.021]  He gets it all from looting, getting insider trading knowledge, the old Nazi collaborator.
[01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:57.003]  Well, we're not funded by Soros or any other big corporation.
[01:14:57.324 --> 01:15:01.766]  In fact, we know he's funding groups, quarterbacking, trying to shut us down right now.

[01:15:42.944 --> 01:15:47.068]  Infowarslife.com, the biggest sales ever, because you're really responding.
[01:15:47.369 --> 01:15:50.692]  So as we sell a lot more, I can lower the price to fund the operation.
[01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:55.397]  But we need to sell a ton to defend ourselves and expand the operation in the face of the globalists.
[01:15:55.417 --> 01:16:00.763]  So I want to thank you all for your support, but commit today to support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.

[01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:10.975]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:12.356]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:16:12.616 --> 01:16:14.917]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:16:15.598 --> 01:16:22.101]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:16:22.302 --> 01:16:25.643]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:16:25.964 --> 01:16:27.765]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:16:28.405 --> 01:16:36.814]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:16:36.855 --> 01:16:37.816]  They know how great it is.
[01:16:38.737 --> 01:16:42.521]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:16:43.342 --> 01:16:44.783]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:16:45.604 --> 01:16:53.467]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[01:17:09.972 --> 01:17:12.873]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.

[01:20:05.502 --> 01:20:08.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.361]  He never gives up.
[01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:32.445]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[01:20:33.966 --> 01:20:35.087]  Well, you can't give up.
[01:20:35.147 --> 01:20:36.208]  The stakes are too high.
[01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:41.291]  The globalists literally want to impoverish us, totally control us, and have authoritarian power over humanity.
[01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:42.392]  That's what they're craving.
[01:20:42.732 --> 01:20:43.593]  They're mentally ill.
[01:20:43.693 --> 01:20:44.633]  They're sociopaths.
[01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.914]  They're psychopaths.
[01:20:45.954 --> 01:20:47.475]  And history shows that.
[01:20:47.936 --> 01:20:51.158]  America is the experiment, and the Renaissance is the experiment.
[01:20:52.307 --> 01:20:54.268]  of trying to change that and turn that around.
[01:20:54.588 --> 01:21:00.570]  But now the BBC and every other state-run media outlet in Europe is saying the West is inherently evil.
[01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:03.510]  We've got more clips of that coming up later.
[01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:11.873]  A Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned a group to expose the cover-up and was organizing the witnesses.
[01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:14.634]  The FBI took all the footage, told folks not to talk.
[01:21:15.354 --> 01:21:17.635]  We know it is a Comey-Mueller protégé.
[01:21:18.935 --> 01:21:22.337]  of the Clintons that isn't running the cover up there in Vegas.
[01:21:22.357 --> 01:21:29.442]  But for this segment and part of the next, I wanted to get Robert Brown on because I've seen his research and seen some of the speeches he's given.
[01:21:30.543 --> 01:21:36.667]  He is a coordinator and regional field director for the John Birch Society covering Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
[01:21:36.987 --> 01:21:38.948]  He's best known for his lectures on the Constitution.
[01:21:39.288 --> 01:21:45.732]  He's produced six of the lectures on DVD series, knows the Constitution is the solution, which is gaining popularity nationwide.
[01:21:46.353 --> 01:21:47.954]  He and his family reside in Billings, Montana.
[01:21:48.474 --> 01:21:51.816]  And there they're battling to wake folks up and defend the Republic.
[01:21:51.836 --> 01:22:06.546]  But I wanted to get him on, just in general, talk about his view of the Trump Revolution, other populist constitutional revolutions happening, and what he is concerned might derail it, or how they might sucker punch us.
[01:22:06.586 --> 01:22:13.170]  Because I've seen a lot of people that I respect and like pushing a constitutional convention, so we should talk about what those are briefly.
[01:22:14.617 --> 01:22:16.377]  As a solution to fully retake the country.
[01:22:16.817 --> 01:22:21.338]  Well, we're already beginning to do it at the state level, and culturally, and at the federal level.
[01:22:21.378 --> 01:22:24.859]  We have the trifecta now, as soon as we dig out the Republican establishment.
[01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:34.241]  So, I tend to lean his direction that a constitutional convention is one of the only things the globalists could use to try to overturn the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:37.401]  But let's get his take on that right now.
[01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:41.762]  Robert Brown, JBS.org, what is your expert analysis on this?
[01:22:43.499 --> 01:22:52.124]  My concern here is that in today's political environment, this would be the exactly wrong thing to be doing, to be having an Article 5 Constitutional Convention.
[01:22:52.905 --> 01:23:05.093]  I look back to the expertise of James Madison, where in his day, he was very concerned about a growing movement in his time to have a Constitutional Convention to make changes to the new Constitution they'd just established.
[01:23:05.753 --> 01:23:11.657]  And his main concerns he pointed to was the present temper of America and the present ferment of parties.
[01:23:12.332 --> 01:23:18.877]  There was such political discord at the time, he thought that opening up the Constitution for another convention would just lead to chaos.
[01:23:19.858 --> 01:23:22.740]  And I have to ask, are we in any better circumstance today?
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.563]  Do we have better political harmony, or are we in political discord again?
[01:23:27.163 --> 01:23:28.805]  I think the answer on that one's quite clear.
[01:23:29.385 --> 01:23:30.526]  It would be absolute chaos.
[01:23:30.566 --> 01:23:36.851]  Of course, all the lobbyists would be vying for position on getting their ideas into the new changes of the Constitution.
[01:23:37.591 --> 01:23:40.834]  So in today's political environment, this is a crazy idea.
[01:23:41.693 --> 01:23:48.077]  In addition to that, I think Justice Scalia said it best when he said, this is not a good century to write a constitution.
[01:23:49.098 --> 01:24:00.546]  And I would back that up with my own experience that as I've traveled around the country speaking on the Constitution, I find most people, even those that are politically active, are pretty ignorant of what the Constitution already says.
[01:24:01.306 --> 01:24:03.588]  And so the types of amendments they tend to come up with
[01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:04.826]  That's right.
[01:24:27.378 --> 01:24:31.504]  And it's why we see globalist organizations for decades pushing a CON CON.
[01:24:31.845 --> 01:24:35.490]  And as you said, you see their whole plan to destabilize the country.
[01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:42.521]  They would take a CON CON as the time to launch their Bolshevik-style revolution that they're already trying to push right now.
[01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:44.855]  Absolutely.
[01:24:45.275 --> 01:24:50.098]  Whereas those of us who value liberty, we don't have any need for any changes to the Constitution.
[01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:59.302]  Simply enforcing what it already says would make massive inroads towards re-stabilizing our country, creating financial prosperity.
[01:24:59.362 --> 01:25:00.363]  It's like a submarine.
[01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:03.404]  It's not broken if the doors are open and you go underwater and it floods.
[01:25:03.604 --> 01:25:04.725]  You've got to close the doors.
[01:25:06.482 --> 01:25:07.903]  Yeah, precisely, precisely.
[01:25:08.524 --> 01:25:20.452]  And so as I look at things here, one of the things that Founding Fathers did point to is in times where the Constitution is just being ignored, they never pointed to using Article 5 to make changes to the Constitution.
[01:25:20.933 --> 01:25:23.795]  What they always pointed to was constitutional enforcement.
[01:25:24.611 --> 01:25:33.299]  As a classic example of this, the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which were clear violations of, among other things, our freedom of speech.
[01:25:33.319 --> 01:25:37.123]  It made it illegal to speak against the actions of the President or Congress.
[01:25:37.964 --> 01:25:45.451]  Madison and Jefferson, recognizing this was a great encroachment against the clear meaning of the Constitution, didn't say, we need to change the Constitution.
[01:25:46.471 --> 01:25:48.972]  They said, we need to enforce the Constitution.
[01:25:48.992 --> 01:25:51.974]  They came up with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolution.
[01:25:51.994 --> 01:25:52.294]  That's right.
[01:25:52.354 --> 01:25:55.995]  You don't need a new Constitution just because they're ignoring the old one.
[01:25:56.015 --> 01:25:57.256]  They're going to ignore the new one.
[01:25:58.717 --> 01:25:59.257]  Precisely.
[01:25:59.817 --> 01:26:07.260]  I compare this often to, imagine having a sporting game where none of the refs have ever read the rules and have very little idea of how the game is supposed to be played.
[01:26:07.961 --> 01:26:10.422]  And so most of the players have never bothered reading the rules either.
[01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:11.322]  They don't need to follow it.
[01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:12.743]  So they say, let's write new rules.
[01:26:13.956 --> 01:26:14.136]  Right.
[01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:15.157]  Oh, let's write new rules.
[01:26:15.197 --> 01:26:16.778]  We're not using the ones we already have.
[01:26:17.218 --> 01:26:19.319]  That's what's going on with the people and Congress.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.863]  The people are supposed to be, as Hamilton put it, the national guardians of the Constitution.
[01:26:25.403 --> 01:26:30.546]  We're the ones that are ultimately the final rep on whether the Constitution is being followed or not.
[01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:32.788]  And yet, none of us know what it says.
[01:26:33.768 --> 01:26:36.690]  Nobody, generally, has much idea of the Constitution.
[01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:42.914]  I often run Constitution quizzes around the country, and you're hard-pressed to find anyone that can even get a passing grade on it.
[01:26:43.602 --> 01:26:45.237]  Because we're ignorant of the Constitution.
[01:26:46.044 --> 01:26:48.465]  As long as we don't know the rules, they don't have to follow them.
[01:26:48.825 --> 01:26:49.326]  Exactly.
[01:26:49.346 --> 01:26:50.726]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:26:50.766 --> 01:26:54.528]  Until recently, you usually didn't hear conservatives push con-cons.
[01:26:55.088 --> 01:27:02.371]  Now, I'm hearing more and more from Fox News, you know, I've had guests on, heard their perspective on how it's needed, and I've overall disagreed with them.
[01:27:02.411 --> 01:27:11.675]  I mean, I could see how there was a total awakening, you know, we could, you know, perhaps have a few new things for things that are more modern, but don't change anything that's old, because it's worked so well.
[01:27:11.736 --> 01:27:14.817]  But why suddenly are more and more conservatives pushing it?
[01:27:16.858 --> 01:27:21.100]  Unfortunately, I think a lot of them are getting desperate and see this as a great idea.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.901]  It's being portrayed in ways that I don't think are realistic, though.
[01:27:24.481 --> 01:27:37.566]  If you were to honestly pull up the anchor of our Constitution right now and drift to the center of political thought, would that move us closer to the mindset of Madison or Marx versus back in 1787 when it was written?
[01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.968]  Obviously, our nation has moved far in the wrong direction.
[01:27:41.716 --> 01:27:43.499]  And it's a very dangerous political environment.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:49.510]  We don't understand the history like the Founding Fathers did to create the Constitution as they did.
[01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.856]  And look, Confederate General stuff, I'm like...
[01:27:53.874 --> 01:27:56.595]  Charles Barkley and others, I mean, who even pays attention to that?
[01:27:57.576 --> 01:28:03.919]  But it's being brought up to tear that down and then say, oh, the American flag flew over slavery, get rid of it, get rid of the Constitution.
[01:28:03.959 --> 01:28:10.783]  And now, just a few years later, what we predict is true, the left is saying the country's bad, the Bill of Rights is bad, the Constitution's bad.
[01:28:11.043 --> 01:28:21.008]  In England, they're saying get rid of the whole government, it's racist too, because it actually is protecting the people and has those rights enshrined that weren't given by government but were only pointed out by
[01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:30.694]  Absolutely.
[01:28:31.215 --> 01:28:44.704]  You know, one thing I often look at here is the left has a tremendous amount to gain by making changes to the Constitution, whereas on the right, those of us that value limited government, we couldn't do better than the provisions that are currently in the Constitution.
[01:28:44.764 --> 01:28:47.566]  Take, for example, the push for a balanced budget amendment.
[01:28:48.727 --> 01:29:04.523]  Tell us about that Robert Brown of the JBS one of their top constitutional educators out there over four state area we're gonna come back and get his his take on this and other angles and other attack plans of a con con stay with us now ladies and gentlemen we're running
[01:29:05.788 --> 01:29:11.112]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:29:11.372 --> 01:29:12.493]  Now Brain Force Plus.

[01:29:26.102 --> 01:29:27.904]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.

[01:33:21.556 --> 01:33:23.137]  You got a business.
[01:33:23.257 --> 01:33:24.097]  You didn't build that.
[01:33:25.097 --> 01:33:26.718]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.442]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:39.142 --> 01:33:41.703]  It's Alex Jones and Robert Brown.
[01:33:42.902 --> 01:33:46.964]  We got Gerald Cilente to cover the waterfront and take some of your calls coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:47.944 --> 01:33:54.248]  I need to get into Senate Judiciary opens probe into Obama-era Russian nuclear bribery case.
[01:33:54.908 --> 01:33:57.929]  That's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:02.511]  I got several other mainstream publications admitting that globalism is in trouble.
[01:34:02.892 --> 01:34:05.093]  It's an unelected authoritarian system.
[01:34:05.753 --> 01:34:06.713]  It better be in trouble.
[01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:11.576]  And Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up.
[01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:14.879]  She was a young 29-year-old, 28-year-old woman.
[01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:16.139]  This is crazy.
[01:34:16.199 --> 01:34:17.019]  That's coming up.
[01:34:17.059 --> 01:34:31.883]  But Robert Brown is the coordinator of the Regional Field Director of the John Birch Society, covering four states, who, again, is one of the first organizations to expose the globalist conspiracy back in the 1950s when we discovered the CIA.
[01:34:33.923 --> 01:34:35.724]  Uh, had actually put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:37.566]  That's how the John Birch Society started.
[01:34:37.586 --> 01:34:38.326]  People are like, what?
[01:34:38.846 --> 01:34:39.947]  And now it's all been proven.
[01:34:39.987 --> 01:34:41.108]  It's all been declassified.
[01:34:41.128 --> 01:34:42.869]  Uh, it's just crazy.
[01:34:42.929 --> 01:34:44.410]  So he's a historian on this.
[01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:45.571]  JBS.org.
[01:34:45.591 --> 01:34:46.791]  Any of the dangers of Con Con.
[01:34:47.212 --> 01:34:50.374]  Finish up, uh, with the, with the dangers of the Con Con.
[01:34:50.914 --> 01:34:58.599]  And then other threats you see, if this was a ball game where you'd see Team America, Team Republic versus Team Soros, Team Globalist.
[01:34:58.639 --> 01:35:03.002]  And, uh, where in history you think we are right now in your view of Trump?
[01:35:05.407 --> 01:35:06.108]  Very good questions.
[01:35:06.148 --> 01:35:18.978]  Where we left off, first of all, was my explanation that really the left has a tremendous amount to gain from making changes to the Constitution, whereas those of us who believe in limited government couldn't do better than the enumeration of powers, for example.
[01:35:19.459 --> 01:35:25.904]  On the one hand, we have people pushing for a balanced budget amendment, which would only say Congress can't spend more than they take in.
[01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:35.972]  Instead of that, if we were to get back to Congress only spending money on the enumeration of powers, you would see a reduction of over 80% of federal spending.
[01:35:36.012 --> 01:35:39.415]  You'd see a surplus annually of over $2 trillion.
[01:35:40.396 --> 01:35:46.360]  So much better, and it also rang the federal government back to what they're actually supposed to be doing within their jurisdiction.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.441]  So it doesn't have any comparison here.
[01:35:48.461 --> 01:35:52.484]  What they're trying to accomplish through a convention versus what the Constitution already says.
[01:35:53.345 --> 01:35:55.246]  But the other thing I want to really focus on is as
[01:35:56.854 --> 01:36:03.239]  Constitutionalists, originalists, conservatives, we really have two angles of attack to get back to the Constitution.
[01:36:03.779 --> 01:36:06.581]  And both of them begin with we the people.
[01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:10.504]  We need to understand the Constitution and demand adherence to it.
[01:36:11.024 --> 01:36:16.748]  And as more and more of us do that, we have two angles where we can attack big government and rein it back in.
[01:36:16.808 --> 01:36:18.810]  The first one is state legislatures.
[01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:27.499]  You've heard many times of the concept of state nullification, which is exactly what Madison and Jefferson turned to with the Alien and Sedition Acts.
[01:36:27.539 --> 01:36:30.241]  They said the states need to refuse to comply with this.
[01:36:30.902 --> 01:36:44.515]  In fact, Hamilton in Federalist 16 says, if the cooperation of state legislatures is necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only not to act or act evasively and the measure is defeated.
[01:36:45.245 --> 01:36:47.386]  That accounts for a majority of federal programs.
[01:36:47.426 --> 01:36:49.607]  They require the states to help implement them.
[01:36:50.488 --> 01:36:54.530]  So if the states are concerned of the federal government overstepping their bounds, stop helping them.
[01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:55.591]  That's the first step.
[01:36:56.491 --> 01:37:04.896]  But in addition to that angle of attack working through the states and nullification, the other is the people directly holding their members of Congress accountable.
[01:37:05.802 --> 01:37:22.969]  I cover this in a video that can be found on YouTube called The Power of 500, where we found that a team of about 500 people in a congressional district is enough political sway that when they're working coordinated in holding their elected officials accountable to the Constitution, it has a tremendous effect on them.
[01:37:22.989 --> 01:37:25.330]  We did that with my own congressman in Montana a few years ago.
[01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:31.413]  Within a few months, he began following the Constitution very well because he felt tremendous pressure from the people.
[01:37:32.338 --> 01:37:34.681]  So these are the most powerful tools we have.
[01:37:35.062 --> 01:37:36.363]  Number one, the state legislatures.
[01:37:36.423 --> 01:37:37.845]  Number two, the people themselves.
[01:37:37.905 --> 01:37:43.713]  In fact, Madison referred to the people themselves as the ultimate redress of constitutional violations.
[01:37:44.453 --> 01:37:46.616]  These are where we really need to be focusing.
[01:37:47.097 --> 01:37:50.181]  It starts with the people understanding the Constitution.
[01:37:51.058 --> 01:38:05.510]  Which is why, as you mentioned in my introduction there, we produced this video series, The Constitution is the Solution, to help people become familiar with the important points of the Constitution that they need to know to rein the federal government back into their jurisdiction.
[01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:15.679]  If the federal government were following the Constitution, the enumerated powers, they wouldn't be involved in most of what they are doing and most of the areas where we feel oppression coming from them.
[01:38:16.658 --> 01:38:18.599]  That's ultimately the real solution, I see.
[01:38:18.999 --> 01:38:25.761]  We're in that transition period where if we work enough to help educate enough people, we can turn things in the right direction.
[01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:30.703]  But without that, the statement from Thomas Jefferson comes to mind.
[01:38:31.283 --> 01:38:33.924]  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free,
[01:38:34.838 --> 01:38:36.579]  It expects what never was and never will be.
[01:38:36.639 --> 01:38:44.283]  There's nothing we can do to get our nation back on track without the American people understanding these principles of liberty and the Constitution.
[01:38:44.303 --> 01:38:47.685]  And that was my next question, two or three minutes ago, listening to you.
[01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:51.567]  The Democrats and the globalists admit they want a dumbed-down population.
[01:38:51.607 --> 01:38:54.649]  They write white papers, 2 plus 2 equals 5, Common Core.
[01:38:56.055 --> 01:38:57.475]  They know they can't beat free market.
[01:38:57.495 --> 01:38:58.956]  They know they can't beat the Constitution.
[01:38:59.196 --> 01:39:05.537]  They know they can't beat the weapon of the Renaissance, the flower of 1798.
[01:39:06.317 --> 01:39:06.877]  They know.
[01:39:07.457 --> 01:39:12.158]  And so they just ruthlessly want to create dependency and ignorance.
[01:39:12.638 --> 01:39:13.258]  So you're right.
[01:39:13.678 --> 01:39:21.840]  You educate the people in the basics of liberty and freedom and history, to paraphrase Jefferson, and tyrants will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[01:39:22.813 --> 01:39:25.974]  The problem is that they know we're winning now.
[01:39:25.994 --> 01:39:36.459]  I mean, you go back to the 1950s when the John Birch Society was founded by mainly patriots in government and others who were actually aware of the plan to turn us into a communist slash socialist program.
[01:39:37.399 --> 01:39:42.041]  Imagine how small that started and now in 2017, we're beginning to get the upper hand.
[01:39:42.662 --> 01:39:45.243]  But, you know, the winds could change very quickly.
[01:39:45.663 --> 01:39:47.484]  The enemy could pull off some really dirty tricks.
[01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:49.581]  They've already been trying it.
[01:39:50.262 --> 01:39:52.803]  We're forcing them to accelerate their authoritarian plan.
[01:39:53.623 --> 01:39:58.305]  So I see a major violent collision, not by us, but by them in the near future.
[01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:01.966]  Soros was giving $500 million a year to try to bring down the U.S.
[01:40:02.366 --> 01:40:03.967]  Now he just put $18 billion in.
[01:40:04.427 --> 01:40:07.248]  His people literally are actively trying to destroy me.
[01:40:09.228 --> 01:40:09.989]  And everybody else.
[01:40:10.069 --> 01:40:11.829]  I mean, these are monstrous people.
[01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:15.791]  So just getting off the Constitution and taking off your professor hat,
[01:40:16.627 --> 01:40:18.748]  Looking at Trump, why do they hate him so much?
[01:40:19.169 --> 01:40:20.370]  I know he's more of a pragmatist.
[01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:21.530]  He's just not out to get America.
[01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:23.352]  He believes in some basic Americana.
[01:40:23.672 --> 01:40:27.935]  That shows you how bad Hillary would have been, but they're just horrified of Trump.
[01:40:28.775 --> 01:40:31.117]  Where do you see that battle going in the few minutes we have left?
[01:40:32.722 --> 01:40:40.326]  Speaking of George Soros, for example, we see George Soros-funded organizations on both sides of this battle on changing the Constitution.
[01:40:40.366 --> 01:40:44.188]  We see some of them saying, no, we do not want to have an Article 5 convention.
[01:40:44.528 --> 01:40:47.110]  We see others that are saying, yes, we do, like Wolfpack.
[01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:49.871]  He's playing and funding both sides of this battle.
[01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:50.732]  That says something.
[01:40:51.252 --> 01:40:56.035]  And I think you could do some interesting analysis on what he might be able to gain from that, funding both sides of the battle.
[01:40:56.555 --> 01:40:59.516]  But ultimately, this is the real issue.
[01:40:59.596 --> 01:41:00.317]  We, the people,
[01:41:01.016 --> 01:41:02.697]  Are the greatest power in this country.
[01:41:02.717 --> 01:41:04.758]  And as you're saying, we're starting to see an awakening.
[01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.479]  This has got them terrified.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:10.402]  If the American people, enough of us, wake up, their game is over.
[01:41:11.202 --> 01:41:12.623]  And that is really our mission.
[01:41:12.803 --> 01:41:19.647]  Our mission, and yours as well as the John Birch Society, to wake people up to what is really going on, to have enough people standing up to what's going on.
[01:41:20.308 --> 01:41:25.671]  Otherwise, and this is really a race to the finish, if we can wake up enough people in time, we win.
[01:41:25.971 --> 01:41:27.332]  If not, they win.
[01:41:27.372 --> 01:41:28.793]  That's ultimately what it comes down to.
[01:41:30.134 --> 01:41:36.116]  You're absolutely right, and look, Hillary had $2 billion, Trump had $400 million, he beat her.
[01:41:36.877 --> 01:41:55.384]  We have a few million dollars, they have $18 billion, but force-feeding us propaganda is backfiring now, and so just because Soros is all in, throwing a fit with all his stolen money from every scam you can imagine, currency speculation, bringing countries down, funding revolutions against elected governments, I mean,
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.741]  They've got indictments out for him in multiple nations.
[01:41:59.881 --> 01:42:01.042]  So don't be intimidated, folks.
[01:42:01.462 --> 01:42:05.783]  This is a desperation move by this monster and his cohorts.
[01:42:05.903 --> 01:42:07.944]  We are winning because we're promoting freedom.
[01:42:08.004 --> 01:42:14.966]  And when you take action, and when you speak out, and when you get involved, like Robert Brown's doing, nothing on earth can stop us.
[01:42:15.026 --> 01:42:16.767]  And most importantly, pray to God
[01:42:17.947 --> 01:42:18.568]  For Providence.
[01:42:18.888 --> 01:42:21.510]  We will defeat this old, wicked Nazi collaborator.
[01:42:21.831 --> 01:42:23.092]  We will defeat the globalists.
[01:42:23.792 --> 01:42:26.054]  Their system, once identified, will never flourish.
[01:42:26.415 --> 01:42:28.236]  It's an authoritarian, planetary plan.
[01:42:28.597 --> 01:42:29.618]  They were so delusional.
[01:42:30.178 --> 01:42:33.321]  They thought we were so dumb that no one would ever study the plan.
[01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:40.668]  And now the work of the John Birch Society has gone from one person to planetary awakening to the globalist system.
[01:42:41.128 --> 01:42:42.169]  And that's why they're a very...
[01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:47.014]  Small but focused organization and that's why I always support the work they've done.
[01:42:47.315 --> 01:42:48.556]  Robert Brown, great job.
[01:42:48.596 --> 01:42:49.196]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:49.237 --> 01:42:49.757]  God bless you.
[01:42:50.978 --> 01:42:51.599]  Thank you for having me.
[01:42:52.059 --> 01:42:54.262]  We'll be back with the latest news and information.
[01:42:54.302 --> 01:42:56.744]  Gerald Cilente, your phone calls and a lot more.
[01:42:57.105 --> 01:42:57.805]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:43:05.191 --> 01:43:10.514]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:43:10.774 --> 01:43:11.895]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:12.155 --> 01:43:14.456]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:15.117 --> 01:43:21.640]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:21.841 --> 01:43:25.182]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:43:25.503 --> 01:43:27.304]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:43:27.944 --> 01:43:36.353]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:43:36.394 --> 01:43:37.355]  They know how great it is.
[01:43:38.256 --> 01:43:42.080]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:43:42.881 --> 01:43:44.302]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:43:45.143 --> 01:43:53.008]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:53.448 --> 01:44:00.272]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:44:00.972 --> 01:44:04.914]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:44:05.035 --> 01:44:09.097]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:44:09.517 --> 01:44:12.479]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.681]  It's a good deal at $39.

[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:35.647]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth, Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen, and more.
[01:45:36.167 --> 01:45:36.787]  Concentrate.
[01:45:36.827 --> 01:45:38.608]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:45:38.868 --> 01:45:40.228]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:45:40.248 --> 01:45:42.149]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:45:42.549 --> 01:45:43.410]  It's incredible.
[01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:45.810]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:45:45.991 --> 01:45:47.151]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:45:47.611 --> 01:45:48.511]  At 15, incredible.
[01:45:48.832 --> 01:45:49.712]  It is amazing.
[01:45:50.072 --> 01:45:51.332]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:52.113 --> 01:45:52.893]  50% off Caveman.
[01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.454]  But only a few days left.
[01:45:54.694 --> 01:45:55.454]  It's about to end.
[01:45:56.034 --> 01:45:58.375]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:45:58.815 --> 01:46:03.977]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:46:04.397 --> 01:46:05.798]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:46:06.058 --> 01:46:07.198]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:46:07.598 --> 01:46:08.399]  I want to thank you.
[01:46:08.739 --> 01:46:09.779]  We're all in this together.

[01:46:26.424 --> 01:46:36.347]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:46:36.607 --> 01:46:41.968]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:08.583]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:28.519]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:30.541]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:34.224 --> 01:47:38.248]  Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up.
[01:47:38.708 --> 01:47:40.650]  We're gonna be getting to that and more.
[01:47:41.891 --> 01:47:45.775]  Jaguars president apologizes for team kneeling during national anthem in London.
[01:47:47.406 --> 01:47:57.288]  And meanwhile, Mark Faber, a super high-level economist, one of the smartest guys out there, one of the best records at predicting things, there was all this criticism of Western Europe and saying whites are inherently bad.
[01:47:57.308 --> 01:48:06.710]  And he just basically said, thank God, you know, the United States got settled by Europeans because there's a civilization here and he got fired from his company.
[01:48:08.290 --> 01:48:15.852]  Now, look, I wouldn't say something like that because history is a lot more complex than that, but the truth is everybody was barbarous.
[01:48:18.615 --> 01:48:25.157]  But then you've got the BBC and two pieces I played just yesterday on the same show saying whites are inherently evil and bad.
[01:48:25.177 --> 01:48:29.459]  I mean, it's pure Nazi ideology but flipped around.
[01:48:31.339 --> 01:48:32.140]  So that's coming up.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.702]  Because if you want to see what it was really like, because I read a lot of history books that were written by people that were there.
[01:48:40.703 --> 01:48:44.284]  French trappers, British trappers, people with educations that wrote the first hand accounts.
[01:48:44.544 --> 01:48:45.704]  Go watch the movie Revenant.
[01:48:46.505 --> 01:48:47.485]  That's what it was like.
[01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:53.331]  The Native Americans would say, if you don't join us to help kill the other group, we're going to kill you.
[01:48:53.652 --> 01:48:54.932]  And I'm not saying they were bad.
[01:48:55.192 --> 01:48:56.673]  That's just how the whites acted.
[01:48:58.634 --> 01:49:03.756]  The whites 2,000 years ago, in Britain, were human-sacrificing people.
[01:49:04.136 --> 01:49:06.737]  2,000 years ago, the Native Americans in Mexico were doing it.
[01:49:07.417 --> 01:49:08.998]  Same stuff, same behavior.
[01:49:09.218 --> 01:49:11.119]  They said bigger pyramids in Mexico.
[01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:13.960]  What's Mexico today?
[01:49:16.732 --> 01:49:22.658]  But there's something different after the Dark Ages, where we were burning people that knew about herbs or science.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.843]  The Renaissance came 550 years ago.
[01:49:28.204 --> 01:49:33.270]  So the white man was just as barbarous and backwards as anybody else, except the Chinese were more advanced.
[01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:35.132]  They were very barbarous, though, than the Japanese.
[01:49:37.042 --> 01:49:38.023]  But something happened.
[01:49:38.043 --> 01:49:42.787]  It was the Christian ethos met liberty and started valuing human life.
[01:49:42.827 --> 01:49:48.351]  And it took a process of hundreds of years to start achieving what the West has done.
[01:49:48.571 --> 01:49:50.873]  The West trailblazed human liberty.
[01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:56.017]  So yes, I say thank God for the Renaissance that took root in Europe.
[01:49:56.037 --> 01:50:02.803]  And I don't think Faber put the historical accuracy on it.
[01:50:04.594 --> 01:50:11.296]  I'd say he spun it into a more reactionary vein instead of just directly looking at history and what really happened.
[01:50:12.717 --> 01:50:14.818]  But there is a war on history going on right now.
[01:50:15.498 --> 01:50:23.220]  I mean, it's like the city of Z. I've actually read mainline history books about what really went on at that time.
[01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:24.521]  None of it's true.
[01:50:25.381 --> 01:50:29.022]  England didn't believe that there was ancient pyramids in the Americas.
[01:50:29.803 --> 01:50:32.444]  They'd already found them hundreds of 300 years, 400 years before.
[01:50:34.411 --> 01:50:39.152]  The whole movie's like, those savages can't build anything, they're backwards scum.
[01:50:39.673 --> 01:50:42.974]  Just to make, it's just, and none of it's even historically true.
[01:50:42.994 --> 01:50:47.375]  And then one of the famous explorers is a coward and all this other stuff.
[01:50:47.735 --> 01:50:50.476]  It's all SJW made up stuff.
[01:50:50.536 --> 01:50:52.497]  It's as phony as the Justice League.
[01:50:54.937 --> 01:51:02.940]  I mean, you can't even watch historical movies now and not be bombarded with this weird, white knight, virtue signaling crap.
[01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:08.666]  So you're gonna get Faber on the other side saying, well I'm not against whites.
[01:51:09.447 --> 01:51:10.967]  Thank God they settled America.
[01:51:12.868 --> 01:51:16.690]  I mean, if whites are so bad, why is everybody trying to get into the countries that whites built?
[01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.811]  People say, other people built those!
[01:51:19.191 --> 01:51:21.232]  Absolutely, every group exploits other groups.
[01:51:21.492 --> 01:51:22.512]  No one ever denied that.
[01:51:23.113 --> 01:51:26.854]  The West, for 550 years, has been trying to stop it.
[01:51:29.936 --> 01:51:31.957]  Go to another country, see how barbarous they are.
[01:51:32.157 --> 01:51:32.837]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:34.315 --> 01:51:39.039]  See, I feel so good about myself, I don't need to look down on other people so I feel powerful.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:48.446]  But I see racism and cultural warfare from the globalist left, these ruthless corporations, playing us all off against each other.
[01:51:48.687 --> 01:51:53.590]  That's what the CIA does with anthropologists and sociologists, is go in and study groups.
[01:51:53.851 --> 01:52:01.317]  That's who they send in first to a country they're going to take over for decades to learn everything and to have their professors write books
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:11.307]  Scholarly tomes on the infrastructure of the area and the cultural systems to divide and conquer them later.
[01:52:11.447 --> 01:52:12.708]  And I'm going to get more into that in a moment.
[01:52:17.292 --> 01:52:31.444]  America and our republic is under attack because the globalists know that a free open society, the idea of America, is absolutely at loggerheads with the globalist system they're trying to build.
[01:52:32.762 --> 01:52:49.952]  That scientifically directed, a technocracy, totally authoritarian, that is completely cold-blooded, absolutely anti-loving, anti-altruistic, and committed to total, complete engineering of the human species.
[01:52:50.752 --> 01:52:53.414]  And mass culling of 90% of the world population.
[01:52:53.754 --> 01:53:01.939]  That's what Ted Turner, that's what Bill Clinton, that's what Bill Gates, that's what George Soros, that's what all of these groups are pushing.
[01:53:02.813 --> 01:53:06.575]  That is their set destiny and overarching plan.
[01:53:07.556 --> 01:53:18.223]  And now we have George Soros coming out who normally gives a couple billion dollars a year globally to overthrow free and open societies and cause culture wars.
[01:53:18.683 --> 01:53:22.585]  And 500 million a year on average to try to destabilize the U.S.
[01:53:22.885 --> 01:53:24.446]  and cause race and cultural war.
[01:53:25.587 --> 01:53:31.671]  He has now bellied up to the bar and put 18 billion dollars of his stolen loot
[01:53:33.032 --> 01:53:33.714]  Into the kitty.
[01:53:34.996 --> 01:53:36.900]  That's all in.
[01:53:41.108 --> 01:53:44.454]  That is completely and totally all in.
[01:53:45.799 --> 01:53:54.121]  To try to overthrow the Americana 2.0, rising from the ashes, 1776 Part 2, that we're witnessing.
[01:53:54.842 --> 01:54:02.824]  Trump's not perfect, but he believes in the Republic, he believes in a free market, he believes in empowering the average person and having a true
[01:54:03.644 --> 01:54:05.024]  Competition-based system.
[01:54:05.765 --> 01:54:19.989]  And because of that, the globalists that already thought they had full control of America, and then the world, are in total panic mode in an existential battle, seeing their entire authoritarian world government crumble and collapse in front of them.
[01:54:20.509 --> 01:54:25.951]  And so George Soros funds Media Matters, CNN, MSNBC, all these legal groups.
[01:54:27.168 --> 01:54:47.503]  And other operations that are openly suing Trump thousands of times, setting up and suing us as well, trying to sabotage our suppliers, trying to shut down our support base, trying to get us kicked off radio and TV, trying to have us criminally investigated, trying to have us shut down.
[01:54:48.323 --> 01:54:54.926]  But I have the Republic behind me and common sense and an awake population to defend against you.
[01:54:55.506 --> 01:55:06.191]  I'm not those poor, sad, hard-working Eastern European peasants that you helped round up for four years when you sent them to death camps, Soros, and you thought you could bring down America.
[01:55:06.431 --> 01:55:08.532]  You're going to find out we're not going to go so easy.
[01:55:09.112 --> 01:55:12.434]  So he's $18 billion in to this fight right now.
[01:55:13.294 --> 01:55:15.095]  And he thinks he's going to break your will.
[01:55:16.016 --> 01:55:16.957]  But here's the good news.
[01:55:16.997 --> 01:55:18.858]  Hillary had almost $3 billion.
[01:55:19.098 --> 01:55:20.940]  Trump had about $400-500 million.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.441]  But he had the people, and so he won.
[01:55:23.862 --> 01:55:29.506]  And so this force-feeding of his culture war, and trying to buy off groups, isn't going to help him.
[01:55:29.786 --> 01:55:31.247]  It's going to blow up in his face.
[01:55:31.607 --> 01:55:34.649]  Because no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:41.805]  And he may pay off Anderson Cooper and say he wasn't a Nazi collaborator, but we've got him on TV saying he was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:55:42.265 --> 01:55:59.518]  So I'm asking listeners and viewers of this transmission, now more than ever to understand, when you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you spread the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, or Facebook, Google, Twitter, or other platforms, or you spread the podcasts, or you spread other systems,
[01:56:01.101 --> 01:56:05.269]  It is funding a revolution globally against these technocrats.
[01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:12.061]  And when you buy the products at Infowarsstore.com, you are involved in a revolutionary act against these globalists.
[01:56:12.402 --> 01:56:13.204]  Because pennies!
[01:56:14.204 --> 01:56:20.866]  against their thousands of dollars and millions against their billions is already defeating them and will defeat them.
[01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:28.849]  The fact that he's gonna have to put in hundreds of times a year what he put in previously of his stolen loot just kills him!
[01:56:29.410 --> 01:56:32.631]  So I'm asking you, as the enemy ups their power against us,
[01:56:33.371 --> 01:56:37.353]  As the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:56:37.753 --> 01:56:41.655]  And InfoWars is imperfect, but we are seen by the enemy as the standard.
[01:56:42.055 --> 01:56:46.798]  As one of the main standard-bearer operations against them, and that's why we're under attack.
[01:56:47.018 --> 01:56:51.100]  So rally around the flag, my friends, and financially support us today.

[01:57:56.479 --> 01:57:58.340]  We are under constant attack.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.022]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[01:58:01.242 --> 01:58:04.123]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[01:58:04.163 --> 01:58:18.491]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[01:58:19.191 --> 01:58:20.812]  They can't get to us that way.
[01:58:21.192 --> 01:58:24.013]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[01:58:24.033 --> 01:58:25.013]  They don't have that power.
[01:58:25.473 --> 01:58:28.014]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[01:58:28.354 --> 01:58:30.755]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:58:31.215 --> 01:58:34.076]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:34.216 --> 01:58:35.716]  This is by listener request.
[01:58:35.956 --> 01:58:41.198]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[01:58:41.218 --> 01:58:41.798]  Again,
[01:58:42.538 --> 01:58:48.283]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[01:58:48.704 --> 01:58:53.008]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[01:58:53.588 --> 01:58:57.452]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[01:58:59.473 --> 01:59:02.195]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[01:59:02.215 --> 01:59:20.607]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:59:20.947 --> 01:59:23.769]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[01:59:23.809 --> 01:59:25.831]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[01:59:26.191 --> 01:59:28.193]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[01:59:28.653 --> 01:59:40.262]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[01:59:40.302 --> 01:59:43.384]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:00:12.319 --> 02:00:15.327]  All the leaves are brown.
[02:00:39.648 --> 02:00:46.253]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, Gerald Cilente is going to be joining us for the balance of the transmission, or 54 minutes.
[02:00:46.853 --> 02:00:49.815]  And I intend towards the end of the hour to also put the phones up so folks can talk to him.
[02:00:50.416 --> 02:00:52.277]  The globalists have tried to launch a culture war.
[02:00:52.837 --> 02:00:53.378]  It's failing.
[02:00:53.398 --> 02:00:57.461]  They're now trying to launch one in England, saying that their government and their history is evil.
[02:00:59.222 --> 02:01:02.224]  They are trying to cover up the mass shooting that happened two and a half weeks ago.
[02:01:02.284 --> 02:01:03.325]  That's fully imploding.
[02:01:04.406 --> 02:01:06.968]  Just everything the globalists do turns to pure garbage now.
[02:01:08.211 --> 02:01:12.392]  And on top of that, now Trump has come out and called Mueller a liar.
[02:01:12.472 --> 02:01:14.272]  Mueller was the back man for uranium.
[02:01:14.992 --> 02:01:22.674]  Mueller killed criminal investigations of the FBI into Hillary, not just transferring uranium, but also weapons components when she was the head of the State Department.
[02:01:23.074 --> 02:01:36.656]  I mean, we've already known this, but to see everything we broke a year ago, with even more info, come out, and to see the day after Hannity covered it, Senator Grassley talking about it, and Sessions saying that yes, there is a criminal investigation of Hillary,
[02:01:37.898 --> 02:01:39.919]  Wow, how the worm has turned.
[02:01:40.499 --> 02:01:44.682]  But right now in the few minutes we have left in this short segment, let's go ahead and go to this article.
[02:01:45.282 --> 02:01:56.549]  Vegas survivor, this is an Infowars.com article, Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned an organization to expose the cover-up.
[02:01:57.189 --> 02:02:00.471]  She was going to create an organization of survivors.
[02:02:04.434 --> 02:02:13.539]  You've got the timeline changing five or six times.
[02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:22.985]  You've got video of shooters down the road and eyewitnesses to it and all the military experts including military experts that testify in court.
[02:02:24.622 --> 02:02:29.028]  Munitions experts, acoustics experts, clearly shooters at Mandalay.
[02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:31.050]  Inside and out.
[02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:31.992]  We first broke that.
[02:02:32.953 --> 02:02:33.854]  Clearly shooters.
[02:02:34.395 --> 02:02:35.096]  Other areas.
[02:02:35.997 --> 02:02:38.460]  Not just at Mandalay, but at other casinos.
[02:02:39.597 --> 02:02:44.100]  A woman who died days after surviving the ill-fated October 1st Country Music Festival in Las Vegas.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:44.620]  She lived there.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:45.441]  I purposed them to get to her.
[02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:50.885]  Wanted to organize a group, a survivor's group, in order to flush out the strange event.
[02:02:51.065 --> 02:02:55.068]  Ooh, they didn't want that because they had credibility and they had standing in court.
[02:02:55.828 --> 02:02:57.909]  Facebook conversations revealed.
[02:02:58.129 --> 02:03:00.910]  We've got screenshots of all of them on Infowars.com.
[02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:03.550]  By the way, the FBI erased those as well.
[02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:10.112]  Kimberly Schomel, 28, died suddenly on October 9th at her Apple Valley, California residence.
[02:03:10.632 --> 02:03:11.813]  She also lived in Vegas part of the time.
[02:03:12.293 --> 02:03:15.674]  Five days after posting her version of events to Facebook.
[02:03:16.494 --> 02:03:30.982]  The days following the massacre, Fringe reached out to Schoemel over October 4th post in which she described someone setting off firecrackers near the venue and detailed being chased by numerous people, concluding at one point there was more than one gun firing 100%.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:34.361]  More than one.
[02:03:34.821 --> 02:03:38.504]  And of course we had witnesses saying they were told to get out, you're going to be dead in 45 minutes.
[02:03:39.004 --> 02:03:40.565]  Then 45 minutes later the shooting starts.
[02:03:40.846 --> 02:03:44.809]  And people inside Mandalay saying that there had been people shooting inside.
[02:03:44.889 --> 02:03:46.070]  That later came out too.
[02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:51.094]  Everything the people told us, everything our FBI sources told us is coming true.
[02:03:51.634 --> 02:03:58.239]  You've got a protege of Mueller who was then appointed to head up Vegas by Comey right before he left.
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:02.823]  And we've got federal sources saying this guy is as bad as the day is long.
[02:04:04.207 --> 02:04:15.689]  One longtime friend of Schoemel's, who asked to remain anonymous, provided InfoWars with screenshots of a conversation he'd had with her, in which she indicated planning to organize a group of survivors in order to piece together things.
[02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:21.171]  That's InfoWars.com, a Don Salazar article, breaking it all down.
[02:04:21.191 --> 02:04:24.291]  You can read her last photos and last words.
[02:04:24.831 --> 02:04:26.132]  She wanted you to investigate.
[02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.272]  Will you investigate?
[02:04:27.972 --> 02:04:31.455]  You can share my comment for sure, she wanted to say to everybody.
[02:04:31.495 --> 02:04:33.297]  They wanted to organize a group to find out the truth.
[02:04:33.918 --> 02:04:37.621]  Others have been dying suddenly, weren't even shot as well.
[02:04:38.462 --> 02:04:40.744]  So, they were planning to blame this on the Second Amendment.
[02:04:41.284 --> 02:04:43.086]  All our intel says it's an ISIS attack.
[02:04:43.486 --> 02:04:47.370]  We've got British intelligence head coming out and saying they're seeing exponential Islamic attacks.
[02:04:47.410 --> 02:04:47.870]  Well, yeah.
[02:04:48.111 --> 02:04:53.716]  You bring in record numbers of unvetted military-age men who invaded Syria into your countries, you're going to get attacked.
[02:04:54.076 --> 02:04:56.101]  The government's answer is, of course, take all of our rights.
[02:04:56.543 --> 02:04:57.626]  That makes it a false flag.
[02:04:57.886 --> 02:04:59.210]  They brought in the groups they knew would attack.
[02:04:59.511 --> 02:05:01.596]  Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, straight ahead.
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:04.802]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:05:04.982 --> 02:05:07.384]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[02:05:07.565 --> 02:05:14.852]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:05:15.052 --> 02:05:25.383]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:05:25.683 --> 02:05:33.266]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:05:33.527 --> 02:05:43.491]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:05:43.751 --> 02:05:45.672]  And this part is most important.
[02:05:45.792 --> 02:05:52.235]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:05:52.595 --> 02:05:53.675]  That means it's clean.
[02:05:54.035 --> 02:05:54.956]  That means it's pure.
[02:05:55.156 --> 02:05:57.837]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[02:05:58.057 --> 02:06:00.617]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:06:00.857 --> 02:06:02.518]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:19.623]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:29.224 --> 02:06:33.166]  I'll tell you this, everything the globalist media pushes is more and more blowing up in their face.
[02:06:33.746 --> 02:06:36.547]  TrendsResearch.com, best-selling author, researcher.
[02:06:38.248 --> 02:06:40.949]  Trends forecaster Gerald Solinte joins us for the hour.
[02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:46.132]  I'm not going to go into his whole bio or how he's basically been in all the media you can imagine.
[02:06:47.332 --> 02:06:50.994]  The bottom line is I want to get his worldview about where we are historically.
[02:06:52.583 --> 02:07:04.189]  I remember, was it five years ago or so, they were saying the economy was dead, America was over, everything was done for, and he said, well, I'm going to double down and believe in Americana.
[02:07:04.209 --> 02:07:20.818]  I'm going to go buy at a strategic point, the Four Corners in Kingston, New York, where the revolution first got hatched, even before what we saw happen at the Green Dragon Inn, or what we saw there in Philadelphia at the Constitution Hall.
[02:07:21.698 --> 02:07:22.999]  And so he doubled down.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.882]  He said, down the road, you know, who knows what will happen to the stock market.
[02:07:26.403 --> 02:07:32.068]  But he said, I believe in a resurgence of Americana and quality and Main Street and people waking up.
[02:07:32.749 --> 02:07:35.712]  And so now, I wouldn't say we're winning, but we're in the thick of the fight.
[02:07:36.052 --> 02:07:37.573]  And all over the world, from Austria.
[02:07:38.379 --> 02:07:42.062]  To Brazil, to Australia, to the UK to here, to Catalonia.
[02:07:42.382 --> 02:07:44.003]  People are fighting back for independence.
[02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:44.964]  Doesn't mean they're always winning.
[02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:48.126]  But every time they fight back, they get stronger each time.
[02:07:48.186 --> 02:07:48.886]  Is Trump perfect?
[02:07:48.926 --> 02:07:49.126]  No.
[02:07:49.467 --> 02:07:50.788]  But you know a man by his enemies.
[02:07:51.268 --> 02:07:53.229]  The globalists hate him because he's trying to be president.
[02:07:53.609 --> 02:07:55.811]  He doesn't want one-sided deals that screw America over.
[02:07:56.171 --> 02:08:02.776]  And just the idea of that, that America wouldn't have the highest corporate tax in the world, by design, to ship our jobs to China.
[02:08:02.976 --> 02:08:05.478]  That we wouldn't ban coal when everybody else has it.
[02:08:06.158 --> 02:08:12.782]  That we wouldn't be involved in economic sabotage of our own nation, as the globalists sell out America to the world for their own power.
[02:08:13.282 --> 02:08:22.107]  That's why the enemies of the country hate Trump so much, and it's why he's so loathed by ignorant people and by parasites, that I have to defend him even more.
[02:08:22.367 --> 02:08:31.832]  Because in this historic time, I want to be up there signing my John Hancock, my Alexander Jones, on the Declaration of Independence, the biggest and the boldest.
[02:08:31.913 --> 02:08:34.214]  Because make no mistake, we are risking our lives,
[02:08:34.694 --> 02:08:38.215]  Our sacred honor, our treasure, our families in this great endeavor.
[02:08:38.695 --> 02:08:53.738]  And I just want to beat the globalists, but if we're successful when the next history transmissions are written and transmitted, I guess, directly into our brains on distant star systems, your progeny, my progeny will look back on this time as the deciding crossroads.
[02:08:53.999 --> 02:08:55.439]  Gerald Cilente, great to have you here.
[02:08:56.345 --> 02:08:56.725]  Thank you.
[02:08:56.826 --> 02:08:58.327]  It's always great being on with you.
[02:08:59.048 --> 02:09:10.001]  I'd like to pick up what you're saying about globalism and the dangers of it and how it is really going in reverse in a lot of places, except here in the United States.
[02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:11.683]  You mentioned what's going on in Austria.
[02:09:12.123 --> 02:09:16.148]  They just had an election last week and the Freedom Party
[02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:19.621]  Came out of nowhere and now they're somewhere.
[02:09:20.141 --> 02:09:27.864]  You saw what happened in Germany a couple of weeks ago with Angela Merkel getting trounced by the AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland.
[02:09:28.524 --> 02:09:31.425]  You see the secessionist movement in Catalonia.
[02:09:32.465 --> 02:09:40.007]  And whether you like him or not, not our kind of guy because he's a Rothschild boy, Macron over in France, a new party.
[02:09:40.768 --> 02:09:44.889]  The point that I'm making is that they're very fearful and they're saying it.
[02:09:45.492 --> 02:09:55.216]  Here's a quote from Wolfgang Schwabler, who was the former German finance minister until Merkel just got trounced.
[02:09:55.636 --> 02:09:57.757]  Here's what he warned the people about.
[02:09:57.777 --> 02:10:00.378]  I want everyone to listen very carefully.
[02:10:01.959 --> 02:10:09.082]  There's no chance Germany will ever relapse into nationalism.
[02:10:09.982 --> 02:10:14.544]  The AFD's voters, that's the alternative for Deutschland, voters
[02:10:15.202 --> 02:10:27.369]  We're dissatisfied, felt excluded, were angry about perceived injustice and worried about how the world was changing.
[02:10:28.230 --> 02:10:32.352]  I want to comment on this because his words are very important.
[02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:36.915]  How dare we should relapse into nationalism?
[02:10:37.275 --> 02:10:42.558]  How dare those Germans want to hang on to their ethnicity
[02:10:43.453 --> 02:10:46.221]  Their culture and their heritage.
[02:10:46.762 --> 02:10:50.432]  How dare the Italians, the French,
[02:10:51.579 --> 02:10:59.985]  The Americans or any other culture wants to hang on to what made them who they are.
[02:11:00.566 --> 02:11:10.533]  How dare they respect their ancestors and the cultural greatness that made them who they are when they should become globalized.
[02:11:11.053 --> 02:11:16.998]  This is the arrogance, the words that are being spoken, but being ignored.
[02:11:17.638 --> 02:11:19.640]  And you listen to his words again.
[02:11:20.515 --> 02:11:25.419]  Their voters were dissatisfied, felt excluded and angry.
[02:11:26.039 --> 02:11:27.320]  Felt excluded?
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:30.462]  Hey, Wolfgang, could you add this up?
[02:11:30.843 --> 02:11:32.644]  You were a finance minister.
[02:11:33.044 --> 02:11:35.406]  You could probably do a little bit of addition.
[02:11:35.786 --> 02:11:38.969]  You got eight people that have more money.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:44.986]  Then half the world's population, according to Oxfam, felt excluded?
[02:11:45.346 --> 02:11:54.677]  We're all getting screwed by the multinationals, Wolfgang, who you suck up to, and who they pay you off to, just like the Clintons and all the rest.
[02:11:55.177 --> 02:11:58.482]  I want you to get back on this amazing breakdown, but let me just add to what you're saying.
[02:11:59.463 --> 02:12:03.369]  It's not like it's some natural migration of people and cultures coming together or something.
[02:12:03.730 --> 02:12:10.880]  It's global megacorporations that are tax-exempt, above the law, saying, we're bringing in groups to politically control you.
[02:12:11.872 --> 02:12:20.339]  We're going to raise your taxes, exempt ourselves at the EU level from the very taxes, and then dictate to you how you're going to live your life.
[02:12:20.719 --> 02:12:31.848]  We're going to bring in 10 million people, 80% of which are military-age men, and then tell German women, don't wear skirts, and ban from Switzerland to Germany, you name it.
[02:12:32.389 --> 02:12:38.394]  Sweden having to ban outdoor beer drinking and Oktoberfest because the radical Muslims
[02:12:39.134 --> 02:12:52.884]  I mean, imagine saying, submit to an outside anti-liberal ideology, allied with a bunch of megabanks, with George Soros funding it, breathing down your neck in some mass cuckolding of Europe.
[02:12:53.164 --> 02:13:00.690]  I mean, it's just crazy the arrogance of outside megabanks coming in, saying we're going to totally dominate you.
[02:13:01.954 --> 02:13:03.554]  It is, and that's what's going on.
[02:13:03.834 --> 02:13:05.635]  And look what's going on, you're talking about taxes?
[02:13:05.935 --> 02:13:07.835]  Look at this BS with Amazon.
[02:13:08.595 --> 02:13:14.837]  They're bragging over here in Jersey that they're gonna give them, you know, all this dough as tax breaks.
[02:13:15.077 --> 02:13:16.037]  What is this guy worth?
[02:13:16.377 --> 02:13:20.678]  You know, 86 billion dollars, and we gotta give Amazon tax breaks?
[02:13:20.958 --> 02:13:22.478]  Nobody gives me tax breaks.
[02:13:22.758 --> 02:13:24.058]  Oh, you're gonna create jobs?
[02:13:24.298 --> 02:13:25.899]  Yeah, I got a great job for you.
[02:13:26.399 --> 02:13:27.459]  Go to college,
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:35.722]  Get a degree in shipping and packaging, and you could get a job at Amazon and be in debt $40,000 a year!
[02:13:35.742 --> 02:13:50.706]  But then Amazon admits that they've got robots that are coming in the next few years to replace you, and Apple's got the worst slave factories with suicide nets, 17-hour workdays where they force drug and abort babies, but it's okay because they're liberal and they gave money to Black Lives Matter.
[02:13:51.746 --> 02:13:55.547]  And then you got a jerk like Christie bragging
[02:13:56.132 --> 02:13:58.194]  That they're giving them all these tax breaks.
[02:13:58.274 --> 02:13:59.635]  Let any other state beat it.
[02:13:59.896 --> 02:14:00.997]  I got one for you.
[02:14:01.317 --> 02:14:07.503]  How about Foxconn, the one over there in Wisconsin from Taiwan that makes Apple computers?
[02:14:08.144 --> 02:14:13.409]  They're going to give them something like, you know, a $3 billion tax break.
[02:14:13.709 --> 02:14:14.850]  Something ridiculous!
[02:14:14.890 --> 02:14:21.175]  Hold on, Gerald, we gotta go to break, but you're absolutely right, and let's not forget, Bezos gets a $1.48 U.S.
[02:14:21.215 --> 02:14:25.960]  taxpayer subsidy on all the packages he ships, a little thing he got Congress to do.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:29.943]  So, folks, again, when you order from Amazon, you're literally cutting your own throat.
[02:14:29.963 --> 02:14:31.344]  They're even gonna bankrupt Walmart.
[02:14:31.584 --> 02:14:40.392]  We're going out to break with Gerald Cilente on fire, but since he mentioned it, here's McCain arrogantly talking about ugly nationalism at some elitist meeting.
[02:14:40.632 --> 02:14:57.722]  With We The People projected behind him, when he's saying We The People at the TPP, unelected and secret, will have more power than Congress, and Trump comes along, destroys TPP, moves it back to Congress, and they've got the nerve to sit there and claim that they're with We The People.
[02:14:57.982 --> 02:15:00.944]  You mean We The Globalist, above the law, megabanks.
[02:15:01.204 --> 02:15:03.966]  Here is John, not long for this world, McCain.
[02:15:05.421 --> 02:15:24.857]  And in the ideals we have advanced around the globe to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain the last best hope of earth for the sake of some half-baked spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.
[02:15:25.017 --> 02:15:26.078]  He's got funded ISIS.
[02:15:26.098 --> 02:15:28.901]  Spurious nationalism.
[02:15:29.892 --> 02:15:31.033]  See, they're saving the world, though.
[02:15:31.053 --> 02:15:31.593]  They're the globalists.
[02:15:31.813 --> 02:15:33.194]  They're gonna tell us how to live our lives.
[02:15:33.814 --> 02:15:35.455]  They're gonna have jumbo jets, but you can't have a car.
[02:15:35.475 --> 02:15:36.736]  That's what Obama said.
[02:15:37.396 --> 02:15:38.016]  They're the elitist.
[02:15:39.337 --> 02:15:40.258]  Oh, thank you, McCain.
[02:15:40.298 --> 02:15:40.658]  Thank you.
[02:15:42.177 --> 02:15:52.766]  He's as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.
[02:15:52.846 --> 02:15:55.509]  Americans consigned America to the ash heap.
[02:15:56.129 --> 02:15:56.570]  You hear that?
[02:15:56.590 --> 02:15:57.771]  He can't even get it out of his mouth.
[02:15:58.632 --> 02:15:59.593]  Go to hell, McCain.
[02:15:59.633 --> 02:16:00.373]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:02.455 --> 02:16:04.017]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:16:05.259 --> 02:16:10.602]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:11.983]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:12.243 --> 02:16:14.544]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:16:15.205 --> 02:16:21.708]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:16:21.909 --> 02:16:25.250]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[02:16:25.571 --> 02:16:27.372]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:16:28.012 --> 02:16:36.442]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:16:36.462 --> 02:16:37.423]  They know how great it is.
[02:16:38.344 --> 02:16:42.168]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:16:42.949 --> 02:16:44.390]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[02:16:45.231 --> 02:16:53.095]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:05.002]  That comes to 50.03.
[02:17:05.122 --> 02:17:09.184]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:17:09.584 --> 02:17:12.726]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:17:14.887 --> 02:17:15.767]  It's a good deal at $39.

[02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:36.882]  Concentrate.
[02:18:36.902 --> 02:18:38.684]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:18:38.944 --> 02:18:40.366]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:18:40.606 --> 02:18:42.228]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:18:42.648 --> 02:18:43.509]  It's incredible.
[02:18:43.989 --> 02:18:45.891]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:18:46.092 --> 02:18:47.233]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:18:47.693 --> 02:18:48.594]  At 15, incredible.
[02:18:48.915 --> 02:18:49.796]  It is amazing.
[02:18:50.156 --> 02:18:51.437]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:18:51.878 --> 02:18:52.999]  50% off Caveman.
[02:18:53.219 --> 02:18:54.541]  But only a few days left.
[02:18:54.801 --> 02:18:55.542]  It's about to end.
[02:18:56.122 --> 02:18:58.464]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:18:58.905 --> 02:19:04.070]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:05.891]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:19:06.131 --> 02:19:07.293]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:19:07.673 --> 02:19:08.494]  I want to thank you.
[02:19:08.814 --> 02:19:09.875]  We're all in this together.

[02:19:26.509 --> 02:19:36.435]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.

[02:20:05.887 --> 02:20:08.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.878 --> 02:20:23.442]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.462 --> 02:20:24.983]  The war was lost.
[02:20:27.049 --> 02:20:35.314]  So the globalists think it's in style to destroy nation states, and it isn't that the UK or Europe or the US are perfect or Brazil or anything else.
[02:20:35.334 --> 02:20:37.536]  The globalists are trying to overthrow us well right now.
[02:20:37.556 --> 02:20:39.057]  We have populous uprisings.
[02:20:39.757 --> 02:20:46.681]  It's that people set them up, they weren't perfect, but they were post-colonial most of them, and they were trying to have basic human liberty.
[02:20:47.382 --> 02:20:55.027]  They got set up during the Renaissance, before globalism, which is just a new form of colonialism, but a technocracy-based system in their own words.
[02:20:57.253 --> 02:21:04.743]  And now, notice you've got McCain speaking out against nationalism with the iconography of We the People, the Constitution behind him.
[02:21:06.004 --> 02:21:07.827]  But no American flags.
[02:21:07.987 --> 02:21:13.935]  And remember, at the DNC, the first three days of the week, they had no American flags.
[02:21:15.336 --> 02:21:18.798]  And again, I don't worship the American flag, but what are they trying to replace it with?
[02:21:19.318 --> 02:21:22.700]  This globalism that just comes out of nowhere that these elites just make up?
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:26.942]  Top trends forecaster Gerald Cilente is our guest, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:21:26.982 --> 02:21:29.163]  But look at the NFL commissioner.
[02:21:29.864 --> 02:21:31.685]  He's on Fox right now.
[02:21:31.725 --> 02:21:32.605]  He's having a press conference.
[02:21:32.625 --> 02:21:33.306]  We can put it on screen.
[02:21:33.666 --> 02:21:35.807]  The NFL symbol is an American flag.
[02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:41.330]  But see, now they won't kneel or they won't stand during it.
[02:21:41.390 --> 02:21:44.672]  They want to kneel to make a big issue out of it.
[02:21:48.169 --> 02:21:58.778]  And again, it lets Americans understand, wow, there's an outside corporate force that really wants to get rid of the nation-state and basically demonize it.
[02:21:59.138 --> 02:22:01.160]  And you have to ask yourself, why are they doing that?
[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:03.102]  Because they're replacing it with something.
[02:22:04.275 --> 02:22:06.476]  Well, you better find out what that something is.
[02:22:07.096 --> 02:22:08.476]  They've already looted the third world.
[02:22:08.496 --> 02:22:13.098]  They set up factories where they have suicide nets that Gerald Cilente was mentioning.
[02:22:13.418 --> 02:22:14.438]  They mean business.
[02:22:14.478 --> 02:22:16.479]  They're totally and completely ruthless.
[02:22:16.499 --> 02:22:22.381]  Well, he came out three weeks ago and told Trump, you disrespected the NFL when Trump said you disrespected our veterans, our country.
[02:22:23.137 --> 02:22:26.020]  You have a right to say you hate America if you want to.
[02:22:26.561 --> 02:22:41.138]  The difference is you don't work for a company, go out there daring it, then be disrespectful, and then whine when you've made $200 million like Kaepernick, and then when you have two bad seasons, wonder why nobody will hire you, so you sue, claiming you're being discriminated against because you're black, when the NFL's 90% black.
[02:22:44.158 --> 02:22:49.320]  So again, it's an example of globalism trying to destroy America and actually waking America up.
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:51.541]  They thought they had intimidated us.
[02:22:52.161 --> 02:22:52.881]  We were asleep!
[02:22:53.301 --> 02:22:57.183]  Their intimidation now, they're slapping us in the face, woke us up.
[02:22:57.243 --> 02:22:59.043]  That's my view, Gerald Cilente.
[02:22:59.083 --> 02:23:01.904]  What do you think about these battles they're losing?
[02:23:02.204 --> 02:23:07.246]  Hollywood collapsing, ratings down, numbers down, NFL collapsing, mainstream news collapsing.
[02:23:07.706 --> 02:23:12.328]  Everything they're doing collapsing now that they tried to force full domination on us.
[02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:14.992]  Well, the nation's collapsing.
[02:23:15.372 --> 02:23:20.517]  You know, I was listening to this song, you know, California Dreaming, when I was coming on the air.
[02:23:21.198 --> 02:23:22.319]  And I was thinking about it.
[02:23:22.339 --> 02:23:23.480]  There's no...
[02:23:25.117 --> 02:23:27.699]  There's no songs about the cities anymore.
[02:23:27.979 --> 02:23:31.641]  You know, going to Kansas City, she's my Tallahassee lassie.
[02:23:31.861 --> 02:23:32.922]  Oh, I shouldn't say that.
[02:23:33.242 --> 02:23:37.904]  Maybe I'd be sexist if I said Tallahassee lassie, you know.
[02:23:38.225 --> 02:23:42.207]  But there's no songs about the cities anymore.
[02:23:42.227 --> 02:23:43.568]  I was just thinking about it.
[02:23:44.008 --> 02:23:51.712]  When, you know, Chicago, my kind of town, New York, New York, we've lost the identity of who we are.
[02:23:52.213 --> 02:23:53.914]  It's part of that
[02:23:54.662 --> 02:23:58.065]  Globalism and multinationalization.
[02:23:58.406 --> 02:24:08.355]  We shouldn't have any certain qualities of where we grew up, who we are, and what represented us as we grew up.
[02:24:08.656 --> 02:24:10.217]  Don't even think about that.
[02:24:10.658 --> 02:24:13.921]  Just turn into totally blank.
[02:24:14.702 --> 02:24:17.223]  And that's what they're shoving down our throat.
[02:24:17.563 --> 02:24:25.708]  Again, when we were growing up, all these songs about what city you wanted to go to because it was unique.
[02:24:26.008 --> 02:24:27.548]  It had its own culture.
[02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:29.489]  It had its own style.
[02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:30.330]  Gone.
[02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:32.311]  Gone into nothing.
[02:24:32.951 --> 02:24:37.993]  Oh, by the way, everyone listening out there, you know, I know I've been out in your place.
[02:24:38.013 --> 02:24:40.074]  I know how hard you people work.
[02:24:40.594 --> 02:24:44.495]  Put your money where your mouth and ears are, everyone listening.
[02:24:44.875 --> 02:24:46.376]  It's not a free ride.
[02:24:47.268 --> 02:24:50.810]  InfoWars isn't one of these non-for-profits.
[02:24:51.210 --> 02:25:01.335]  You know, all these people that, like these universities, that pay all these coaches and presidents millions of dollars and don't pay any taxes?
[02:25:01.775 --> 02:25:09.359]  This station has to stay alive by supporting them, like we do with our Trends Journal and our information.
[02:25:09.659 --> 02:25:15.602]  So I put my money where my mind and my mouth is, and I buy InfoWars products.
[02:25:16.042 --> 02:25:17.683]  And by the way, Gerald, I know why you're raising this.
[02:25:17.723 --> 02:25:18.804]  People should support you as well.
[02:25:18.844 --> 02:25:19.824]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:25:20.144 --> 02:25:21.005]  We're under attack.
[02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:21.585]  The dirty tricks.
[02:25:21.605 --> 02:25:22.465]  We don't want to get into the air.
[02:25:22.485 --> 02:25:23.446]  You've been through it as well.
[02:25:24.066 --> 02:25:26.207]  They really try to stop us because we're effective.
[02:25:26.227 --> 02:25:30.710]  And you've written books about bringing back local economies, bringing back true diversity.
[02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:32.931]  Globalism is diversity.
[02:25:33.331 --> 02:25:38.314]  Let's the corporate borg claim that they represent all the cultures, like the warden in a prison.
[02:25:39.471 --> 02:25:41.232]  And then they direct society.
[02:25:41.612 --> 02:25:47.394]  But the final frontier we have to fight them is voting with our dollars, voting with our feet, voting with our reviews.
[02:25:47.734 --> 02:25:53.696]  And that's what you're letting people know is George Soros may have just put $18 billion in trying to kill the Trump agenda.
[02:25:54.197 --> 02:25:57.338]  That's like literally 50, 60 times what he normally does a year or more.
[02:25:58.398 --> 02:25:59.999]  That's a sign of desperation, Gerald.
[02:26:00.019 --> 02:26:00.359]  Do you agree?
[02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:01.772]  Oh, it is.
[02:26:01.792 --> 02:26:02.973]  Look what they're doing in Hungary.
[02:26:02.993 --> 02:26:04.514]  They threw Soros out.
[02:26:05.175 --> 02:26:06.636]  You know, they're trying to stop him.
[02:26:07.056 --> 02:26:21.445]  You know, look, Alex, the only way this country is really going to change, as I see it, and you can see it around the world, is what we talked about with the AfD party in Germany, the Freedom Party in Austria, there's Cinque Stelle, the Five Star Movement in Italy, on and on.
[02:26:21.745 --> 02:26:23.887]  We need a new party in America.
[02:26:24.267 --> 02:26:25.448]  We need a new way.
[02:26:26.068 --> 02:26:30.971]  The Democrats and the Republicans are nothing more than the Bloods and the Crips, murderers and thieves.
[02:26:30.991 --> 02:26:32.552]  And you've called for this for 20 years.
[02:26:32.713 --> 02:26:34.674]  Isn't Trump taking over the Republican Party?
[02:26:35.314 --> 02:26:35.694]  No!
[02:26:36.015 --> 02:26:39.297]  Siding sometimes with other groups, basically breaking their back partially?
[02:26:40.089 --> 02:26:43.250]  What Trump represents is the perfect analogy.
[02:26:43.930 --> 02:26:45.311]  He is no party.
[02:26:45.931 --> 02:26:52.813]  Both parties are against him in so many ways, which is showing the opportunity for a new way now.
[02:26:53.213 --> 02:26:55.093]  He's not aligned with either of them.
[02:26:55.393 --> 02:26:57.294]  That's why neither of them support him.
[02:26:59.155 --> 02:27:00.015]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:27:00.035 --> 02:27:03.196]  When you were always harping on this, I'd say, look, I don't think it's going to happen at this time.
[02:27:03.576 --> 02:27:05.036]  But I think Trump is an example.
[02:27:05.476 --> 02:27:06.937]  And all the special elections we've seen,
[02:27:08.067 --> 02:27:09.528]  Any mainline Democrat's losing.
[02:27:09.989 --> 02:27:11.430]  Any mainline Republican's losing.
[02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:14.713]  The people want true populism from the left and the right.
[02:27:15.033 --> 02:27:17.635]  But the power structure's fighting it, fighting it, fighting it.
[02:27:18.116 --> 02:27:21.939]  Instead of at least embracing it on the surface, they're so arrogant they're not.
[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:25.402]  No, they're not because it's against their interests.
[02:27:25.682 --> 02:27:26.903]  Because who are they?
[02:27:27.264 --> 02:27:28.124]  Prestitutes.
[02:27:28.645 --> 02:27:33.349]  They get paid by their corporate johns and their Washington whoremasters.
[02:27:34.048 --> 02:27:35.289]  I mean look at this stuff coming out.
[02:27:35.309 --> 02:27:37.009]  I just read about this guy Jake Tapper.
[02:27:37.249 --> 02:27:40.871]  He used to go out with Monica Lewinsky writing that disgusting stuff about her.
[02:27:41.431 --> 02:27:44.053]  And this guy shooting his mouth off with this arrogant attitude.
[02:27:44.293 --> 02:27:48.134]  Look who we have over here in New York with this Cuomo, Chris Cuomo.
[02:27:48.455 --> 02:27:50.496]  I remember him when I used to do all the TV shows.
[02:27:50.796 --> 02:27:52.516]  They'd bring him around with his little aides.
[02:27:52.717 --> 02:27:53.537]  He was talking about
[02:27:53.917 --> 02:27:58.981]  No, because again, you know, they've never had a work in their lives.
[02:27:59.041 --> 02:28:00.602]  It's all been given to him for free.
[02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:40.801]  I'm going to ask you this when we come back, your prediction politically, how this is going to go, the different breaks, what happens if they assassinate Trump, the so-called left wants a revolution in October, November 4th is when they launch their main attack, they're promising violence nationwide, I think what we saw...
[02:28:42.012 --> 02:28:43.093]  And Vegas was part of that.
[02:28:43.633 --> 02:28:47.356]  And Deep State covered it up, because Trump isn't in control of his own FBI yet.
[02:28:47.696 --> 02:28:50.978]  And we'll talk the whole Russiagate situation with Gerald Cilente.
[02:28:51.018 --> 02:28:58.663]  Now we know why Hillary was saying Trump was a roostie, because ladies and gentlemen, her, Mueller, all of them, were literally Russian assets.
[02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.164]  They had totally sold out.
[02:29:02.706 --> 02:29:04.267]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:29:05.512 --> 02:29:10.855]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:29:11.115 --> 02:29:12.236]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:12.496 --> 02:29:14.798]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:29:15.458 --> 02:29:21.962]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:29:22.182 --> 02:29:25.144]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:29:25.825 --> 02:29:27.626]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:29:28.266 --> 02:29:36.695]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:29:36.736 --> 02:29:37.677]  They know how great it is.
[02:29:38.598 --> 02:29:42.382]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:29:43.203 --> 02:29:44.644]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[02:29:45.485 --> 02:29:53.351]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:29:53.791 --> 02:30:02.277]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:30:02.837 --> 02:30:05.259]  That comes to 50.03.
[02:30:05.379 --> 02:30:09.442]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:30:09.842 --> 02:30:12.744]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:30:15.146 --> 02:30:16.026]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:30:16.366 --> 02:30:27.350]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[02:31:27.081 --> 02:31:35.948]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[02:31:36.508 --> 02:31:37.128]  Concentrate.
[02:31:37.169 --> 02:31:38.950]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:40.631]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:31:40.651 --> 02:31:42.472]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:31:42.892 --> 02:31:43.773]  It's incredible.
[02:31:44.233 --> 02:31:46.154]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:31:46.335 --> 02:31:47.475]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:31:47.936 --> 02:31:48.856]  At 15, incredible.
[02:31:49.176 --> 02:31:50.057]  It is amazing.
[02:31:50.417 --> 02:31:51.678]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:52.138 --> 02:31:53.239]  50% off Caveman.
[02:31:53.459 --> 02:31:54.800]  But only a few days left.
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:55.781]  It's about to end.
[02:31:56.381 --> 02:31:58.703]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:31:59.164 --> 02:32:04.329]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:32:04.749 --> 02:32:06.150]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:32:06.391 --> 02:32:07.552]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:32:07.932 --> 02:32:08.753]  I want to thank you.
[02:32:09.073 --> 02:32:10.114]  We're all in this together.
[02:32:10.134 --> 02:32:20.544]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[02:32:21.284 --> 02:32:24.705]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[02:32:24.945 --> 02:32:26.746]  But these specials have got to end.
[02:32:26.766 --> 02:32:36.689]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:32:36.949 --> 02:32:42.271]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[02:32:42.771 --> 02:32:47.413]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[02:32:48.073 --> 02:32:55.717]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:56.057 --> 02:33:00.880]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[02:33:05.882 --> 02:33:08.503]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.221 --> 02:33:25.867]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:33:25.887 --> 02:33:29.150]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:33.512]  Well, I wouldn't say I have the answer to every question.
[02:33:33.532 --> 02:33:34.832]  Notice I didn't write that liner.
[02:33:35.573 --> 02:33:36.653]  I got the crews being nice.
[02:33:37.433 --> 02:33:39.775]  But nine times out of ten, I have the answer.
[02:33:39.795 --> 02:33:44.317]  Because the globalists' big miscalculation is acting like you're idiots.
[02:33:45.417 --> 02:33:55.022]  They thought they would build a big giant private corporate world government, exempt themselves from the taxes, the regulations, give themselves diplomatic immunity.
[02:33:56.607 --> 02:34:17.769]  And then, once the planetary regime was in place, once they transferred all the nation-state power by the leaders to that new global power in this revolution of the bureaucrats against the nations and their peoples, they would then bring in a worldwide autocratic authoritarian system they call a technocracy.
[02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:37.834]  Managing and running our lives in a planned civilization where we are a permanent underclass and they are a permanent overclass, and that, from all their different books and white papers, from Zbigniew Brzezinski to John P. Holdren, is the altruistic or liberal or loving view.
[02:34:39.571 --> 02:34:51.123]  If you get into why the future doesn't need us, and you get into what Ray Kurzweil and Google and others are talking about, they go, oh, you're lucky we don't just step on you like you're a bug once we merge with machines.
[02:34:51.684 --> 02:34:54.667]  We're just going to be the new superhumans and you're all going to be dead.
[02:34:56.669 --> 02:34:57.530]  That's Ted Turner.
[02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:58.451]  That's Bill Clinton.
[02:34:58.871 --> 02:35:00.313]  That's David Rockefeller.
[02:35:01.564 --> 02:35:11.412]  Pull it up, even ABC News reports, Oprah Winfrey went to secret meetings with the Rockefellers just six years ago to discuss exterminating 80-90% of the world population.
[02:35:11.452 --> 02:35:14.635]  Folks, I know this stuff sounds crazy, they're the crazy ones.
[02:35:15.455 --> 02:35:23.702]  Now even though they never get those plans into place, it shows in a 21st century world view what old elites would do when they got inbred and crazy.
[02:35:24.262 --> 02:35:27.205]  They would just start wars or start killing people or thinking they were God.
[02:35:28.331 --> 02:35:36.600]  It's called megalomania and the old evil Nazi collaborator, George Soros, knows mainstream media is totally discredited.
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:40.243]  That's why in 1998, 60 Minutes had him on.
[02:35:40.283 --> 02:35:42.085]  He bragged and said, I'm not ashamed of being a Nazi.
[02:35:42.466 --> 02:35:43.707]  I did what I had to do to survive.
[02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:45.309]  In fact, it was free market.
[02:35:45.329 --> 02:35:45.989]  I filled an itch.
[02:35:46.089 --> 02:35:46.650]  I'm proud of it.
[02:35:47.811 --> 02:35:48.212]  In 2017, he has
[02:35:50.663 --> 02:35:55.086]  His minion get up there from the CIA, Anderson Cooper, and say it never happened.
[02:35:55.146 --> 02:35:57.668]  Alex Jones made it up, despite the fact we have the clip.
[02:35:58.028 --> 02:35:59.629]  That shows how weak they are.
[02:35:59.709 --> 02:36:00.890]  They know they're exposed.
[02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:02.652]  So just tell bigger lies.
[02:36:02.712 --> 02:36:04.433]  Talk about Hitler and the big lie theory.
[02:36:05.498 --> 02:36:21.689]  Show, when you financially support us by buying supplements and t-shirts and books and videos and all the hottest titles, you name it, to help wake yourself and others up more, it funds us to continue to reach out to others and have other great brains on the broadcast like Gerald Cilente.
[02:36:22.563 --> 02:36:27.108]  And so that's why it's a revolutionary act to financially support this broadcast.
[02:36:27.289 --> 02:36:29.351]  And we've got specials that are ending in the next few days.
[02:36:29.932 --> 02:36:37.140]  50% off Brain Force, just the known, highest quality, healthy, organic compounds for healthy, more active, focused brain.
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:39.543]  20% now and more in each bottle.
[02:36:40.762 --> 02:36:41.802]  We're doing 50% off.
[02:36:42.002 --> 02:36:43.183]  Not because it's not selling.
[02:36:43.323 --> 02:36:44.283]  We sold so much of it.
[02:36:44.303 --> 02:36:48.345]  It's gotten so popular that I ordered the biggest order ever of it.
[02:36:48.945 --> 02:36:58.568]  So I could do it 50% off to see if my free market idea would work to sell even more at lower prices, make you even happier, and fund ourselves to expand.
[02:36:58.728 --> 02:36:59.188]  A win-win.
[02:36:59.548 --> 02:37:00.028]  It's worked!
[02:37:00.148 --> 02:37:01.409]  I thought we had a two-month supply.
[02:37:01.829 --> 02:37:08.094]  It'll be sold out in a couple of weeks at this rate, so I've got to end the special in the next few days, and then put it back to regular price until more comes in.
[02:37:08.515 --> 02:37:10.056]  That is going to end in the next few days.

[02:37:12.218 --> 02:37:14.520]  Survival Shield X2, 40% off, about to end.

[02:37:24.368 --> 02:37:26.010]  That's the dry form of Super Mel Vitality.
[02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:27.551]  And Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[02:37:28.792 --> 02:37:37.566]  Highest quality known organic, high quality herbs, ladies and gentlemen, that have passed the strict, almost impossible California standards.
[02:37:38.996 --> 02:37:42.679]  Until we know someday what we've talked about we know they're going to do.
[02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:51.467]  But the point is, ladies and gentlemen, it's all available at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:51.487 --> 02:37:54.669]  And again, Gerald Salente has his Trends Journal.
[02:37:55.050 --> 02:37:58.553]  He has his free updates you can sign up for and get as well.
[02:37:58.933 --> 02:37:59.814]  It is critical.
[02:38:00.354 --> 02:38:02.436]  An absolute act of war against the globalists.
[02:38:02.596 --> 02:38:05.599]  I know that you already know all about this stuff.
[02:38:07.346 --> 02:38:10.295]  But ladies and gentlemen, your friends, your family, your neighbors, don't.
[02:38:10.375 --> 02:38:11.197]  We're in a war.
[02:38:11.298 --> 02:38:12.822]  People are ready to wake up now.
[02:38:13.749 --> 02:38:15.910]  So please support the broadcast.
[02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:17.771]  Please get the word out.
[02:38:18.051 --> 02:38:20.092]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:38:20.772 --> 02:38:23.033]  Gerald, we've only got about five minutes left in this segment.
[02:38:23.053 --> 02:38:23.714]  I've got another one.
[02:38:23.734 --> 02:38:26.375]  I want to get into political correctness and culture war with you.
[02:38:26.735 --> 02:38:40.542]  But instead of me asking some of the questions here, what else is front and center on your trends, your predictions, the whole Trump era, different possible futures that you see, and what happens if they kill President Trump, something they're publicly trying to organize?
[02:38:41.578 --> 02:38:49.084]  Well, going on to the future and what we see is that we're talking about the populist movements.
[02:38:49.104 --> 02:38:52.186]  You know, our method of tracking trends is called global nomic.
[02:38:52.226 --> 02:38:55.028]  It means making connections between different fields.
[02:38:55.409 --> 02:38:57.650]  And we're talking about populism and nationalism.
[02:38:58.351 --> 02:39:05.136]  One thing to really consider, and again, the motto is think for yourself, is what's going on with these cryptocurrencies.
[02:39:06.017 --> 02:39:06.757]  This is real.
[02:39:06.817 --> 02:39:07.718]  This isn't dying.
[02:39:08.613 --> 02:39:15.578]  It's an expression of people's disgust with the fiat currencies and the globalized central bankers.
[02:39:16.379 --> 02:39:18.701]  This is like my generation.
[02:39:18.761 --> 02:39:19.982]  It was buying gold.
[02:39:20.342 --> 02:39:25.606]  I bought my first gold by $187.50 an ounce.
[02:39:26.907 --> 02:39:31.330]  And now today, the millennials, their gold is cryptocurrency.
[02:39:31.911 --> 02:39:33.612]  It all ties together.
[02:39:34.451 --> 02:39:40.877]  We're looking at a breakdown of a fight among the people against the system.
[02:39:41.398 --> 02:39:43.820]  And this is one of the ways of breaking the system.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:47.604]  Because if you break the bank, then you're really in trouble.
[02:39:47.924 --> 02:39:53.209]  That's why you got a guy like Jamie Dimon screaming out that Bitcoin is a fraud.
[02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:56.713]  And after all, he should know what a fraud is.
[02:39:59.052 --> 02:40:02.514]  He's saying it because it's going to put the banks out of business.
[02:40:02.894 --> 02:40:04.815]  That's why the banks don't like it.
[02:40:05.495 --> 02:40:22.882]  Number two, very important, and I'm sure your audience knows it, but for those that may have not heard it, China is now accepting when they buy Iranian oil or Russian oil, instead of paying them in petrodollars, U.S.
[02:40:22.942 --> 02:40:27.644]  dollars that were based on oil prices, they're paying them in yuan.
[02:40:28.544 --> 02:40:31.586]  And saying you could cash the yuan in for gold.
[02:40:32.407 --> 02:40:33.187]  This is big.
[02:40:33.747 --> 02:40:42.173]  Now, remember the deal of the petrodollar was made between Nixon and the Saudi king back in about 1974.
[02:40:44.394 --> 02:40:47.676]  Now they're saying to Saudi Arabia, the Chinese, no.
[02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:52.031]  We're not going to buy your oil and pay you in dollars.
[02:40:52.372 --> 02:40:55.494]  We're going to pay you in yuan.
[02:40:55.834 --> 02:40:57.736]  They're telling the Saudis this!
[02:40:58.556 --> 02:41:12.708]  And they may buy 5% of Aramco, the big Saudi company that they're going to... oil field... the giant oil company of Saudi Arabia that they're going to put on the market.
[02:41:13.088 --> 02:41:14.829]  They may buy 5% of this.
[02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:16.711]  The reason I'm mentioning this
[02:41:17.927 --> 02:41:22.728]  If the petrodollar dies, the U.S.
[02:41:22.828 --> 02:41:26.649]  dollar will crash, and so too will the economy.
[02:41:27.049 --> 02:41:28.230]  This is a reality.
[02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:30.350]  This isn't just speculation.
[02:41:30.730 --> 02:41:32.351]  It's happening in front of us.
[02:41:32.831 --> 02:41:33.911]  So what does that mean?
[02:41:34.491 --> 02:41:38.612]  Well, the cryptocurrencies, they're trying to stop those in a lot of countries.
[02:41:39.032 --> 02:41:43.793]  So what will people buy when their value of their fiat currencies dies?
[02:41:44.634 --> 02:41:46.094]  Gold and silver.
[02:41:48.168 --> 02:41:52.210]  Continue with the Bretton Woods Agreement and the petrodollar.
[02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:57.952]  What's going to happen, China doesn't want to deal with dollars anymore.
[02:41:58.692 --> 02:42:01.653]  So they're not taking the petrodollar, they're not taking U.S.
[02:42:01.753 --> 02:42:02.094]  bucks.
[02:42:02.534 --> 02:42:11.017]  They're giving, so when you're buying your oil, I'm Chinese, I'm buying your Saudi Arabian oil, I'm not going to pay in bucks, I'm paying you in my yuan.
[02:42:11.657 --> 02:42:13.898]  But you could cash my yuan into gold.
[02:42:14.699 --> 02:42:17.840]  So it's becoming very attractive because once upon a time,
[02:42:18.894 --> 02:42:22.496]  You could cash the dollar in for gold, but you can't do that anymore.
[02:42:22.656 --> 02:42:24.017]  And by the way, let me point this out.
[02:42:24.657 --> 02:42:31.820]  The University of Texas and hundreds of other big institutions, while gold went down for a while, now it's gone back up some, have been buying billions of dollars of it.
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:37.183]  So the elites, while telling you don't get gold, they're the ones that are actually getting into it.
[02:42:39.457 --> 02:42:43.520]  Yeah, and again, if this petrodollar goes down, you know, the U.S.
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:50.526]  dollar crashes, you'll be going to Walmart with a wheelbarrow of money like they used to do in Weimar Republic Germany.
[02:42:50.666 --> 02:42:51.106]  That's right.
[02:42:51.146 --> 02:42:53.608]  Let's talk more about the dark side of the economy.
[02:42:53.868 --> 02:42:55.770]  We're hoping things get better and we're rooting for it.
[02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:58.272]  But what happens if the globalists are able to stop Trump?
[02:42:58.532 --> 02:43:00.033]  We'll talk about it with Gerald Cilente.
[02:43:03.015 --> 02:43:04.577]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:43:05.839 --> 02:43:11.163]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:43:11.423 --> 02:43:12.544]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:12.804 --> 02:43:15.106]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:43:15.766 --> 02:43:22.271]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:43:22.492 --> 02:43:25.454]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:43:26.134 --> 02:43:27.956]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:43:28.596 --> 02:43:37.006]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:43:37.046 --> 02:43:37.987]  They know how great it is.
[02:43:38.908 --> 02:43:42.652]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:43:43.593 --> 02:43:45.014]  Tropic means for the brain.
[02:43:45.815 --> 02:43:53.662]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:43:54.102 --> 02:43:59.767]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:44:05.131 --> 02:44:05.551]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:44:05.711 --> 02:44:09.734]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:44:10.154 --> 02:44:13.296]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:44:13.336 --> 02:44:14.277]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:44:15.478 --> 02:44:16.198]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:22.782 --> 02:44:27.385]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:36.247]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[02:45:36.807 --> 02:45:37.447]  Concentrate.
[02:45:37.467 --> 02:45:39.268]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:45:39.509 --> 02:45:40.929]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:45:40.949 --> 02:45:42.790]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:45:43.211 --> 02:45:44.071]  It's incredible.
[02:45:44.551 --> 02:45:46.472]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:45:46.652 --> 02:45:47.793]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:45:48.253 --> 02:45:49.154]  At 15, incredible.
[02:45:49.474 --> 02:45:50.374]  It is amazing.
[02:45:50.735 --> 02:45:51.995]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:52.435 --> 02:45:53.556]  50% off Caveman.
[02:45:53.776 --> 02:45:55.097]  But only a few days left.
[02:45:55.357 --> 02:45:56.137]  It's about to end.
[02:45:56.698 --> 02:45:58.959]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:45:59.459 --> 02:46:04.643]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:46:05.063 --> 02:46:06.444]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:46:06.704 --> 02:46:07.865]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:46:08.245 --> 02:46:09.066]  I want to thank you.
[02:46:09.386 --> 02:46:10.427]  We're all in this together.
[02:46:10.967 --> 02:46:20.874]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[02:46:27.079 --> 02:46:37.007]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:46:37.268 --> 02:46:42.612]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[02:46:48.377 --> 02:46:51.379]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever.

[02:46:56.362 --> 02:47:01.205]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:07.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.501 --> 02:47:29.363]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:47:29.843 --> 02:47:33.785]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:33.945 --> 02:47:40.149]  You know, normally if three people had been shot dead and others had been shot, and there was a guy on the run in a major city, you'd hear about it.
[02:47:41.249 --> 02:47:44.331]  But not if he's a black guy who's a Muslim.
[02:47:44.371 --> 02:47:50.274]  Maryland State Police release ID of at-large shooter, Rahid Labib Prince.
[02:47:54.432 --> 02:47:55.672]  Armed and Dangerous!
[02:47:56.712 --> 02:47:58.453]  Now let's scroll down and read some of this article.
[02:47:58.493 --> 02:48:00.374]  We're going to post it up on Infowars.com.
[02:48:01.634 --> 02:48:02.214]  There you go.
[02:48:02.234 --> 02:48:09.116]  Uh, Rahid Labib is suspected of shooting five people in Maryland Business Park this morning.
[02:48:09.897 --> 02:48:11.917]  Five people were shot, three have been reported dead.
[02:48:12.297 --> 02:48:14.478]  He remains at large and considered armed and dangerous.
[02:48:14.498 --> 02:48:15.439]  This story is developing.
[02:48:15.459 --> 02:48:19.440]  But of course, it's not on CNN, it's not on Fox, it's not because
[02:48:20.506 --> 02:48:23.648]  Well, that's why they shut down the whole story in Vegas, folks.
[02:48:23.668 --> 02:48:28.390]  Because when there's an Islamic attack, it doesn't happen.
[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:31.191]  Why are they bringing all these unvetted Islamists into the country?
[02:48:31.212 --> 02:48:38.355]  I'm going to ask Gerald Cilente that in a moment, and also get into the dark side of an economy imploding, and where he sees all of that unfolding.
[02:48:40.316 --> 02:48:41.497]  But first I want to get into this.
[02:48:43.136 --> 02:48:51.744]  There is a report out where an economist and financial researcher that I know has been a pretty smart guy, and I know that Gerald has, at least I've seen, read some nice things about.
[02:48:52.265 --> 02:48:56.569]  Mark Faber resigns after saying, thank God white people populated America.
[02:48:57.430 --> 02:48:59.191]  Now, let's be clear about this.
[02:49:00.813 --> 02:49:01.694]  You can read his quote.
[02:49:03.090 --> 02:49:07.112]  With all these Black Lives Matter groups and the BBC and others saying whites are inherently bad.
[02:49:07.132 --> 02:49:08.012]  I'm going to play a clip of that.
[02:49:08.052 --> 02:49:12.233]  So he responds saying, well, you know, whites have built a civilization.
[02:49:12.253 --> 02:49:13.494]  Why does everybody say they're so bad?
[02:49:13.514 --> 02:49:16.155]  Because you don't see that being built in Africa today.
[02:49:17.196 --> 02:49:18.277]  You know, my issue is this.
[02:49:18.797 --> 02:49:20.318]  Europeans have been barbarous as well.
[02:49:20.678 --> 02:49:22.859]  But the Renaissance was an idea of not doing that.
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:25.101]  And so why is it under such attack?
[02:49:25.681 --> 02:49:33.066]  I've got a clip right here of Monroe Bergdorke on racism in the UK.
[02:49:33.426 --> 02:49:35.047]  This is a program on the BBC.
[02:49:35.407 --> 02:49:39.610]  We've played a lot of these clips where people go on and denounce that white people are inherently evil.
[02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:41.811]  Now Hitler said Jews were inherently evil.
[02:49:42.431 --> 02:49:44.072]  So I'm not saying blacks are inherently evil.
[02:49:44.112 --> 02:49:44.673]  I'm not saying
[02:49:45.453 --> 02:49:46.998]  I'm not saying anybody's inherently illegal.
[02:49:47.018 --> 02:49:48.342]  There's bad groups everywhere.
[02:49:48.683 --> 02:49:49.506]  It can be cultural.
[02:49:49.586 --> 02:49:52.194]  It can also be genetic tendencies in a family.
[02:49:52.555 --> 02:49:52.896]  Whatever.
[02:49:54.073 --> 02:50:02.537]  Just like the guy, you know, reportedly that did the Vegas attack, his dad was a convicted psychopath, bank robber, tried to kill folks with cars, you name it, bragged about it.
[02:50:02.977 --> 02:50:13.741]  Well, this GZ, don't use the wrong word or I'll get arrested, in California, has come out as this fountain of wisdom and told us whites are inherently more barbarous, more violent, more evil.
[02:50:14.121 --> 02:50:15.182]  Actually, Crime Statistics Show,
[02:50:15.762 --> 02:50:16.803]  You say it's cultural, whatever.
[02:50:16.843 --> 02:50:18.744]  Here in the U.S., blacks are ten times more likely.
[02:50:19.265 --> 02:50:21.746]  Similar numbers in Europe, and it's even higher with Muslims.
[02:50:21.806 --> 02:50:27.090]  But, I mean, I'm just saying the statistics, but you're saying I'm inherently a bad person.
[02:50:27.130 --> 02:50:28.731]  So, why don't you resign?
[02:50:29.472 --> 02:50:31.753]  Oh, because it's okay, because you're being racist against whites.
[02:50:32.074 --> 02:50:34.716]  What you say is five times more brutal than what Faber says.
[02:50:34.736 --> 02:50:44.623]  I want to play this and then get Gerald Salente's take on all this culture war garbage that I know he just wants to transcend, like I do, with us having a unified culture, a free market, open, real societies.
[02:50:45.203 --> 02:50:47.925]  But let's go ahead and play the clip of the racist training.
[02:50:49.846 --> 02:51:01.133]  If white people want to see an improvement for people of color, they need to understand that racism is not learned, it's inherited, and either consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege.
[02:51:01.493 --> 02:51:07.617]  The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth.
[02:51:10.327 --> 02:51:20.413]  My worry is that whatever governments do to tinker with institutional racism, it is so ingrained in the fabric of British society that it is too late to do anything about it.
[02:51:21.594 --> 02:51:27.998]  And then I've got all these videos of the new thing is men dressed up like women but then in demon clown outfits going and scaring kids.
[02:51:29.409 --> 02:51:37.850]  At school libraries, and it's like, look, if we can put a guy in a demon clown outfit in a room with a bunch of little kids, I mean, you'd run at the park from these guys.
[02:51:38.331 --> 02:51:43.211]  But it's okay, because they're like this group on a pedestal telling you that you're inherently bad because you're white.
[02:51:43.631 --> 02:51:49.612]  What is going on with ABC, NBC, CBS, BBC, all of these groups force-feeding this?
[02:51:49.692 --> 02:51:51.033]  What is this, Gerald Cilente?
[02:51:51.833 --> 02:51:54.393]  It happened as soon as Trump started running.
[02:51:54.453 --> 02:51:55.934]  It's the division of America.
[02:51:56.674 --> 02:51:58.574]  And that's when it really began.
[02:51:59.366 --> 02:52:02.890]  And that woman who was mentioning this, oh yeah, things are lovely, right?
[02:52:03.210 --> 02:52:05.412]  Aren't they beautiful over there in Somalia?
[02:52:05.432 --> 02:52:07.394]  How many just died the other day?
[02:52:07.414 --> 02:52:09.677]  Oh, only a little over 300.
[02:52:10.097 --> 02:52:11.919]  Oh, a beautiful day in the Congo.
[02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:16.343]  I think I'm going to take my next vacation in Mali.
[02:52:16.624 --> 02:52:19.427]  Maybe Niger, maybe Cameroon.
[02:52:19.827 --> 02:52:21.469]  Look what's going on in Africa.
[02:52:21.849 --> 02:52:24.711]  Good and bad comes in all races, creeds, and colors.
[02:52:25.011 --> 02:52:27.192]  They're doing this to divide the nation.
[02:52:27.672 --> 02:52:31.274]  And of course, America is definitely a racist nation.
[02:52:31.634 --> 02:52:38.318]  I mean, after all, the last president we had, Obama, I think he was a couple of shades lighter than me!
[02:52:38.678 --> 02:52:40.539]  And who was the Attorney General?
[02:52:40.899 --> 02:52:43.000]  Oh yeah, that garbage piece of crap!
[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:44.501]  Oh, I shouldn't say that!
[02:52:45.101 --> 02:52:45.982]  Eric Holder.
[02:52:46.202 --> 02:52:47.183]  Hold this, Eric.
[02:52:47.463 --> 02:52:50.386]  The guy that didn't bring one of those banksters to jail.
[02:52:50.726 --> 02:52:53.728]  I think he was a couple of days... And Jay Johnson, a black guy.
[02:52:53.909 --> 02:52:54.729]  And Loretta Lynch.
[02:52:54.769 --> 02:52:56.911]  But it's just... No, it's white people's fault.
[02:52:56.951 --> 02:52:58.192]  How about Condoleezza Rice?
[02:52:58.512 --> 02:53:04.017]  How about that low-life piece of garbage who sold us the Iraq War?
[02:53:04.417 --> 02:53:05.718]  Colin Powell.
[02:53:06.079 --> 02:53:07.820]  Oh, you know what, Alex?
[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:10.622]  You know what passes through the colon, don't you?
[02:53:10.682 --> 02:53:13.865]  Why is he named after the final part of the lower intestine?
[02:53:14.105 --> 02:53:15.586]  Because he's crap.
[02:53:16.307 --> 02:53:17.188]  Look what he did!
[02:53:17.568 --> 02:53:24.854]  That he should be brought up on war crime tribunals with his little piece of colon crap showing us this is proof.
[02:53:24.874 --> 02:53:26.255]  But wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:53:26.295 --> 02:53:28.316]  White people are the only people that do bad.
[02:53:28.356 --> 02:53:29.137]  That's not racist.
[02:53:29.197 --> 02:53:31.719]  So what I'm saying is, are there racists?
[02:53:31.959 --> 02:53:32.960]  Of course there are.
[02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:35.102]  Are there people that don't like Italians?
[02:53:35.422 --> 02:53:36.363]  Don't like Jews?
[02:53:36.423 --> 02:53:37.624]  Don't like... Of course.
[02:53:38.024 --> 02:53:39.165]  They're ignorant people.
[02:53:39.445 --> 02:53:41.306]  This is not a racist country.
[02:53:41.626 --> 02:53:43.127]  We elected a black president.
[02:53:43.147 --> 02:53:49.531]  And they know we're not, so they use our weakness that we don't want to be racist against us, because they know we have a conscience, and I'm sick of it.
[02:53:50.612 --> 02:53:58.617]  Again, when Obama got elected, and I'm doing media all over the world, he was gonna be the savior.
[02:53:59.443 --> 02:54:05.345]  Remember, he won the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize.
[02:54:06.225 --> 02:54:17.929]  After he got it, he sends 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, kills over 4,000 innocent people with drone strikes.
[02:54:18.089 --> 02:54:20.630]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people.
[02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:27.072]  Oh, does it make a difference whether you're black, white, male, female,
[02:54:27.961 --> 02:54:31.565]  Whatever religion you believe in, good and bad comes in all of them.
[02:54:31.965 --> 02:54:33.987]  It's the media that's dividing us.
[02:54:34.327 --> 02:54:39.673]  Now, as a trend forecaster, I'm going to tell you one of our top trends for 2018.
[02:54:40.313 --> 02:54:42.055]  You know that they're dividing us.
[02:54:42.696 --> 02:54:45.799]  If you're a company, if you're selling a product,
[02:54:46.388 --> 02:54:49.311]  Whatever you're doing, sell unity.
[02:54:49.771 --> 02:54:51.473]  Not unity to fight someone.
[02:54:51.793 --> 02:54:57.518]  Go back to, remember that song?
[02:54:57.858 --> 02:54:59.900]  Remember how... What about the love train?
[02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:00.681]  What about the love train?
[02:55:00.761 --> 02:55:03.664]  Because they say, black lives matter, whites and cops are evil.
[02:55:04.164 --> 02:55:05.425]  That's not unity, that's race war.
[02:55:05.465 --> 02:55:07.747]  We say, let's just all come together and be free and be good.
[02:55:08.068 --> 02:55:08.888]  Exactly.
[02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:12.692]  And as trend forecasters, we tell our clients,
[02:55:13.232 --> 02:55:14.894]  This is a direction to go in.
[02:55:15.374 --> 02:55:17.275]  As they're dividing, you unite.
[02:55:17.596 --> 02:55:19.057]  We're all in this together.
[02:55:19.837 --> 02:55:21.219]  We're all Americans.
[02:55:21.659 --> 02:55:26.623]  We're all here because it was the land of opportunity that our ancestors came to.
[02:55:26.903 --> 02:55:31.427]  We're here because of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[02:55:32.074 --> 02:55:33.736]  So let's get straight over here.
[02:55:33.756 --> 02:55:36.120]  You want to go somewhere else, leave.
[02:55:36.721 --> 02:55:43.170]  But if you want to be an American, live by the principles of what made this country great at one time.
[02:55:44.107 --> 02:55:54.374]  That's right, and what the globalists are doing is, they're saying, throw out all the rules, forget those, don't look at them, even though it's the plan that moved forward to try to actually make people have equal opportunity.
[02:55:54.734 --> 02:56:01.919]  They want to destroy that and give us the global model that's totally secret, totally authoritarian, and has slave factories all over the world.
[02:56:02.199 --> 02:56:02.859]  What are we doing?
[02:56:02.999 --> 02:56:04.120]  Listening to these people.
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:05.001]  It's so obvious.
[02:56:05.281 --> 02:56:06.702]  Then we get their internal WikiLeaks.
[02:56:07.182 --> 02:56:16.925]  And they say we're going to use racial division to control the general population while we basically use them and make them poor so we can control them into the future.
[02:56:17.265 --> 02:56:24.447]  I mean, they're literally dynamiting the ladders up to success, admitting it, and then telling us how altruistic they are.
[02:56:25.638 --> 02:56:26.719]  Again, look at Obama.
[02:56:26.739 --> 02:56:29.160]  He used to brag about all the jobs he created.
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:29.780]  Folks.
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:31.761]  They folks us, alright?
[02:56:32.161 --> 02:56:39.124]  He created 94% of the jobs that were created, according to the Harvard-Princeton study, are temporary jobs.
[02:56:39.564 --> 02:56:44.586]  So they're using the racism divisiveness because they're stealing all our dough.
[02:56:44.887 --> 02:56:45.607]  The money's right.
[02:56:45.687 --> 02:56:47.027]  Everybody knows where it went to the 1%.
[02:56:47.108 --> 02:56:49.268]  We're not making this stuff up.
[02:56:49.308 --> 02:56:50.489]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:56:51.569 --> 02:56:53.070]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:54.791]  Not that he's perfect, but they really hate him.
[02:56:55.632 --> 02:57:00.474]  Because he's not a member of the club, and he's destroying it at different levels.
[02:57:01.374 --> 02:57:01.894]  That's it.
[02:57:02.334 --> 02:57:06.436]  By the way, I was with Anthony Frida a couple of years, a couple of weeks ago.
[02:57:06.756 --> 02:57:09.897]  He's the illustrator, as you well know, for our magazine, Same Sky.
[02:57:10.617 --> 02:57:15.919]  And we had lunch with Robert Trump, Donald Trump's brother, that Anthony Frida knows.
[02:57:16.239 --> 02:57:19.600]  And he was very gentlemanly and very, you know, respectful.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:24.145]  And they hate Trump because he's anti-establishment.
[02:57:24.385 --> 02:57:25.987]  Does he do a lot of things I like?
[02:57:26.147 --> 02:57:34.195]  No, but he's anti-establishment and he's turned over the whole system and that's why they're against him.
[02:57:34.476 --> 02:57:41.323]  We've never had this happen in our lifetime when someone gets elected where they go after them continually.
[02:57:42.064 --> 02:57:42.645]  Absolutely.
[02:57:42.686 --> 02:57:43.066]  Stay there.
[02:57:43.086 --> 02:57:44.028]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:57:44.068 --> 02:57:49.999]  I want to ask you about that and what we can do to continue this revolution of prosperity before everything totally implodes.
[02:57:50.019 --> 02:57:50.780]  Let's talk about that.
[02:57:52.318 --> 02:57:52.798]  Not a group.
[02:57:52.859 --> 02:57:54.240]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:55.361]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:57:55.621 --> 02:57:56.542]  Why is this so good?
[02:57:56.822 --> 02:58:02.067]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:58:02.147 --> 02:58:15.720]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:17.161]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:58:17.922 --> 02:58:19.483]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:58:19.563 --> 02:58:22.066]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:58:22.146 --> 02:58:23.407]  These are all parasites.
[02:58:23.467 --> 02:58:24.548]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:58:24.568 --> 02:58:25.608]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:58:25.929 --> 02:58:30.272]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:58:30.452 --> 02:58:33.615]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:58:33.695 --> 02:58:36.778]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:58:36.818 --> 02:58:37.819]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:58:37.879 --> 02:58:39.761]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:39.821 --> 02:58:40.842]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:00:34.682 --> 03:00:35.822]  We've got a lot of new broadcasts.
[03:00:35.882 --> 03:00:36.982]  War Room coming up at 3 o'clock.
[03:00:37.302 --> 03:00:38.643]  Maybe Night in the Morning with the Real News.
[03:00:39.503 --> 03:00:41.864]  But there's some news that I forgot about getting into.
[03:00:41.924 --> 03:00:43.064]  As I checked it out, it was true.
[03:00:43.764 --> 03:00:53.007]  George Soros shorted MGM the week before the attack $47 million, meaning I guess he made way more than that.
[03:00:53.027 --> 03:00:54.247]  And then you've got
[03:00:55.273 --> 03:01:01.136]  You've got the whole leftist agenda and the SJW Islamists that own MGM.
[03:01:02.597 --> 03:01:09.760]  Ellen DeGeneres is invested in MGM and is part of MGM and owns a bunch of slot machines with MGM.
[03:01:10.161 --> 03:01:11.481]  Or she gets paid money off those.
[03:01:11.942 --> 03:01:13.082]  Ellen's slot machines.
[03:01:13.382 --> 03:01:17.164]  So that conflict of interest is coming up as the whole cover-up implodes.
[03:01:17.524 --> 03:01:22.187]  Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up.
[03:01:22.247 --> 03:01:23.908]  And look, I know there's a lot of globalists out there.
[03:01:25.854 --> 03:01:36.021]  George Soros literally owns and runs the groups that finance the disinfo against us, the lawsuits, the lies, the projects, all of it.
[03:01:36.882 --> 03:01:39.344]  And it's an old, crazy, weird Nazi collaborator.
[03:01:39.364 --> 03:01:40.745]  It makes you ask, when is it going to end?
[03:01:41.627 --> 03:01:44.409]  So we'll talk about that with Roger Stone, the huge new Russia stuff.
[03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:48.112]  Gerald Solente, obviously the economy's coming back.
[03:01:48.132 --> 03:01:50.174]  They never said we could have a 3% growth again.
[03:01:50.214 --> 03:01:50.534]  We did.
[03:01:50.794 --> 03:01:52.235]  But there's big systemic problems.
[03:01:52.255 --> 03:01:59.581]  If he doesn't get the tax cuts, doesn't free spending, doesn't get rid of Obamacare, it's designed to bankrupt it by design, as your analysis has showed.
[03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:09.893]  If Trump fails, if the globalists with interest rate hikes and things are able to beat him, as they admit they're trying to do, will they get the blame or will the populace get the blame?
[03:02:10.393 --> 03:02:12.394]  And what can we do to short-circuit what they're doing?
[03:02:13.474 --> 03:02:15.315]  The populace won't get the blame this time.
[03:02:15.375 --> 03:02:16.956]  It's going to rot from the head down.
[03:02:17.436 --> 03:02:19.257]  The IMF came out with a study.
[03:02:19.317 --> 03:02:24.399]  They just showed that the G20 nations have a total debt of $13.5 trillion.
[03:02:32.591 --> 03:02:33.973]  They're not going to be able to pay that off.
[03:02:35.154 --> 03:02:41.803]  It's all of the private equity groups, the hedge funds, all of this gambling that's been going on with this cheap money.
[03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.207]  And Trump talked about that during the campaign.
[03:02:44.928 --> 03:02:47.291]  They've built a bubble that's ready to burst.
[03:02:48.307 --> 03:02:53.892]  And again, you know, just as a fish rots in the head down, this crash is going to come from the top down.
[03:02:54.312 --> 03:02:56.775]  And we're already seeing it in certain markets.
[03:02:57.235 --> 03:03:02.660]  The high end homes, the ones one three, one five million, they're not selling like they used to.
[03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:04.881]  They're not selling at all in some areas.
[03:03:05.302 --> 03:03:09.505]  The high expensive luxury condominiums aren't selling.
[03:03:10.066 --> 03:03:12.408]  We believe it's peaking out at the top.
[03:03:13.101 --> 03:03:18.590]  If interest rates go up too fast, you're going to go up 25% in December.
[03:03:19.512 --> 03:03:19.912]  Excuse me.
[03:03:21.052 --> 03:03:22.834]  25 basis points in December.
[03:03:23.494 --> 03:03:24.415]  That's not a lot.
[03:03:24.896 --> 03:03:26.197]  That'll be able to hold it.
[03:03:26.517 --> 03:03:32.462]  But if they raise them, say, three more times in 2018, you're going to see this thing come down.
[03:03:32.842 --> 03:03:34.603]  They won't blame it on the populists.
[03:03:34.924 --> 03:03:36.365]  They won't blame it on Trump.
[03:03:36.685 --> 03:03:38.306]  They'll blame it on the bigs.
[03:03:38.747 --> 03:03:40.128]  That's where it's coming from.
[03:03:40.448 --> 03:03:41.829]  And those are the globalists.
[03:03:42.169 --> 03:03:44.271]  They're taking over the entire world.
[03:03:44.531 --> 03:03:46.133]  They've taken over the markets.
[03:03:46.453 --> 03:03:49.936]  So when this stock market goes down, who's it going to affect?
[03:03:50.476 --> 03:03:51.477]  The 5%?
[03:03:51.898 --> 03:03:53.839]  Because the rest of the people aren't in it.
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:04:00.646]  So the other thing, too, that's important is that, you know, we were the... You know me a lot of years.
[03:04:01.046 --> 03:04:07.072]  When Trump got elected, within days, we said the Trump rally was real.
[03:04:08.050 --> 03:04:09.471]  It's still going on.
[03:04:09.951 --> 03:04:20.897]  If there's not a correction, and there has to be one, at the end of this month, we're saying there'll be about a 10% correction in January, February, or March.
[03:04:21.237 --> 03:04:26.079]  But if we make it through October, then it'll be free sailing until then.
[03:04:26.419 --> 03:04:29.241]  Because the market is, you know, it's blown up.
[03:04:29.501 --> 03:04:31.662]  But again, earnings are well.
[03:04:32.082 --> 03:04:33.243]  Earnings are high.
[03:04:33.643 --> 03:04:35.084]  So that's positive, too.
[03:04:37.145 --> 03:04:40.468]  All right, Gerald Cilente, always thought-provoking, always powerful.

[03:06:05.608 --> 03:06:07.188]  Another time.
[03:06:07.788 --> 03:06:09.489]  In the age of wonder.
[03:06:31.646 --> 03:06:35.552]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:36.273 --> 03:06:42.302]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:48.331 --> 03:06:53.893]  Roger Stone's hosting the fourth hour, then the war room with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone is coming up.
[03:06:54.754 --> 03:07:04.678]  Now I saw this a few days ago and I mentioned it, but I burrowed into it and actually went to the Securities and Exchange Commission, we'll put that on screen in a few minutes, and confirmed it.
[03:07:05.598 --> 03:07:08.560]  And with everything else that's come out, we're getting a really clear picture.
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:10.841]  You got SJWs that own the MGM.
[03:07:11.441 --> 03:07:14.643]  They're telling all their employees, we'll give you a time off, you name it.
[03:07:15.184 --> 03:07:31.013]  If you just double the amount of money that we're giving, if you match it, we'll match the money you give to Soros groups, to the Southern Poverty Law Center, to the National Islamic Council here in the U.S., which is basically the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas connected.
[03:07:32.256 --> 03:07:40.843]  And then all this happens, there's a big cover-up, the media says ISIS isn't involved, there's Comey, Mueller appointee covers it all up.
[03:07:41.424 --> 03:07:42.104]  It's incredible.
[03:07:42.485 --> 03:07:44.686]  But here's the headline out of Investment Watch.
[03:07:45.167 --> 03:07:45.547]  Wow!
[03:07:46.068 --> 03:07:49.791]  Soros had a $42 million short on MGM.
[03:07:49.811 --> 03:07:52.853]  So he always gets all the inside knowledge.
[03:07:53.634 --> 03:07:57.257]  And so I guess made a couple hundred million dollars off that baby, put in right beforehand.
[03:07:58.649 --> 03:07:59.250]  That was perfect.
[03:07:59.290 --> 03:08:00.651]  And then of course you got this young lady.
[03:08:00.671 --> 03:08:06.916]  She was going to start a victim's group of survivors that saw the multiple shooters and had their videos taken away by the FBI.
[03:08:06.936 --> 03:08:07.897]  Well, she ended up dead.
[03:08:07.937 --> 03:08:08.178]  She's 28.
[03:08:08.358 --> 03:08:10.500]  That story's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:08:10.540 --> 03:08:12.942]  Kimberly Schomel, 28, wanted to investigate.
[03:08:12.982 --> 03:08:13.783]  Well, she's dead now.
[03:08:15.469 --> 03:08:17.270]  Dead men or dead women, tell no tales.
[03:08:17.831 --> 03:08:21.153]  Las Vegas security guard breaks silence on Ellen after disappearance.
[03:08:21.193 --> 03:08:23.175]  So, he was going to go and hand it to him, but then said he wouldn't.
[03:08:24.076 --> 03:08:26.978]  They changed the timeline that he was getting shot at six minutes before they claimed.
[03:08:27.338 --> 03:08:28.920]  Other witnesses said there was shooting inside.
[03:08:30.277 --> 03:08:33.078]  Uh, the Mandalay Bay, but also at the Bellagio.
[03:08:33.678 --> 03:08:37.280]  Uh, Las Vegas security guard breaks silence on Ellen at her disappearance.
[03:08:38.100 --> 03:08:46.243]  Oh, and look, Ellen, Ellen, uh, owns and is involved, makes money off slot machines with the whole MGM leftist combine.
[03:08:47.044 --> 03:08:47.304]  Okay?
[03:08:48.294 --> 03:08:56.481]  So there you go, and now you've got Vegas police blame journalist Laura Loomer for the missing security guard because he didn't want to be found, they said.
[03:08:56.961 --> 03:09:03.126]  He had to, I guess, get his four or five days of debriefing ready before the story's changed yet again.
[03:09:03.146 --> 03:09:08.290]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, Soros is like cockroaches meet
[03:09:10.646 --> 03:09:11.086]  Herpes.
[03:09:12.026 --> 03:09:13.507]  It's like herpes with legs.
[03:09:14.167 --> 03:09:15.007]  It won't go away.
[03:09:15.047 --> 03:09:16.047]  It always comes back.
[03:09:16.687 --> 03:09:28.130]  I don't want to just sit here and make him the devil that's involved, but every time I got some group showing me, it's the New York Federal Reserve Board member, or it's George Soros funded, or it's, or it's, I mean, these people are after us.
[03:09:28.170 --> 03:09:33.431]  It's okay, because as they turn the heat up on us, Hillary had almost three billion, Trump four hundred and something million.
[03:09:33.631 --> 03:09:34.031]  We beat them.
[03:09:34.727 --> 03:09:38.813]  He just went from billions a year globally to 18 billion trying to destroy everybody.
[03:09:39.333 --> 03:09:51.590]  It's not going to work as long as you understand this is a war, as long as you spread the articles and the videos, as long as you get politically involved, as long as you videotape yourself or start your own YouTube or whatever you do, just get vocal, call C-SPAN.
[03:09:53.066 --> 03:09:54.547]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:09:54.727 --> 03:09:55.827]  Get the great supplements.
[03:09:55.847 --> 03:09:56.567]  Try them for yourself.

[03:10:06.191 --> 03:10:08.412]  Especially the dry form of Super Metal Vitality.

[03:10:09.392 --> 03:10:14.094]  Never done that before because I did this thing of going to 50% off sometimes.
[03:10:14.154 --> 03:10:14.774]  Folks love it.
[03:10:14.794 --> 03:10:15.854]  They buy even more.
[03:10:16.114 --> 03:10:17.435]  We're bringing even more money doing this.
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:21.861]  The problem is, it sells out of stuff and we have supply problems, then we end up losing money.
[03:10:22.101 --> 03:10:23.702]  This takes a lot of money to run this operation.
[03:10:23.962 --> 03:10:24.922]  We're trying to expand.
[03:10:25.202 --> 03:10:26.382]  Please financially support us.

[03:10:44.628 --> 03:10:46.635]  One of the best nootropics out there.
[03:10:46.655 --> 03:10:48.442]  20% more now on each bottle of Brain Force Plus.
[03:10:49.451 --> 03:10:52.073]  We have 50% off on that, but it's about to end.

[03:10:54.114 --> 03:10:56.396]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:10:56.796 --> 03:11:11.726]  And when you fund this operation, you thumb your nose in the face of the scumbags that stole their money, their insider trading, and all sorts of shady deals worldwide where he's been indicted and convicted and overthrowing countries and currency manipulation.
[03:11:11.746 --> 03:11:15.068]  You stand up against that Nazi collaborating sack of crap.
[03:11:15.588 --> 03:11:17.750]  So again, thank you all for your help and support.
[03:11:17.790 --> 03:11:19.211]  We will defeat the demon no matter what.
[03:11:20.191 --> 03:11:29.014]  So, they don't want to car bomb us, it turns us into martyrs, but even the lady investigating, you know, Podesta, their car did blow up a few days ago.
[03:11:29.275 --> 03:11:30.635]  They just try to kill our names.
[03:11:31.215 --> 03:11:35.017]  Unless they hit you with that polonium that time, Roger, T-boned your car right after.
[03:11:35.057 --> 03:11:37.117]  But still, their whole Russian narrative blew up.
[03:11:37.437 --> 03:11:44.840]  How does it feel to be totally vindicated to be the first person on radio and TV a year and a half ago to break down the entire narrative?
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.901]  You've been proven correct in triplicate.
[03:11:47.561 --> 03:11:49.864]  Well, Alex, I thank you for that.
[03:11:50.404 --> 03:12:01.717]  You were the one who called the entire charade about Donald Trump being a sexual assaulter and the left's new attempts to revive that.
[03:12:02.458 --> 03:12:10.403]  Already discredited narrative by getting women to step forward and bear false witness against our president.
[03:12:10.444 --> 03:12:12.385]  You predicted it months ago.
[03:12:12.485 --> 03:12:15.327]  Here it has come to pass just days ago.
[03:12:15.867 --> 03:12:31.098]  Look, when NBC Nightly News was forced to cover the fact that the Obama Justice Department, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, and yes, Rosenstein had been caught red-handed in a massive cover-up,
[03:12:31.618 --> 03:12:55.566]  That they knew about Russian bribery and Russian shenanigans to get control of American-produced enriched uranium, and to get Hillary Clinton and her husband paid off literally millions in order to approve a deal that allowed them to take control of our uranium mining, at least 20% of it.
[03:12:56.447 --> 03:12:59.488]  This has really busted Washington wide open.
[03:13:00.308 --> 03:13:10.816]  The exact people who are claiming that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians are the ones who were covering up Obama-Clinton collusion with the Russians!
[03:13:11.277 --> 03:13:13.138]  They are so busted!
[03:13:13.879 --> 03:13:15.480]  They are so caught red-handed!
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:27.930]  And what was it like for you to now see Sessions finally putting on big boy pants, getting out of his little baby shorts, I'm not being mean, a fact, and saying Hillary is under criminal investigation in the Judiciary Committee meeting this morning?
[03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:36.140]  Well, add that to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has announced their own investigation into the Russian cover-up.
[03:13:36.380 --> 03:13:37.742]  It's about time!
[03:13:37.882 --> 03:13:42.007]  So Mueller, in all of their energy, was desperately to cover up that they indeed had done it.
[03:13:42.228 --> 03:13:43.649]  You were the first to say that about...
[03:13:44.090 --> 03:13:46.712]  Let's be clear, I learned about John Podesta in the Panama Papers in January of last year.
[03:14:10.191 --> 03:14:21.858]  I further learned about it in a stunning piece by Jerry Corsi, then of World Net Daily, now of InfoWars, that exposed all of the inside dealing done by John Podesta.
[03:14:21.878 --> 03:14:23.018]  Oh, but hey, let's just get her on.
[03:14:23.038 --> 03:14:23.599]  She broke it.
[03:14:23.659 --> 03:14:24.999]  Oh, what happened to her three days ago?
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:26.040]  Yeah, blown up.
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:26.881]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:14:26.921 --> 03:14:31.923]  The journalist who first exposed John Podesta, literally blown to hell.
[03:14:32.544 --> 03:14:36.126]  Oh, but maybe it was natural causes like Seth Rich.
[03:14:37.006 --> 03:14:45.330]  Well, and here's something else that you have exactly right, Alex, and that is George Soros is the evil puppet master behind all of this.
[03:14:45.390 --> 03:14:51.592]  The lawsuit against me by Protect Democracy, this is financed by Soros.
[03:14:51.733 --> 03:14:56.975]  The lawsuit against you from this wacky group in California, financed by Soros.
[03:14:57.095 --> 03:14:58.916]  Why are we being targeted?
[03:14:59.316 --> 03:15:03.918]  Because we are onto him, and we are exposing him, and we are making it hurt.
[03:15:04.338 --> 03:15:14.973]  Now this really pains me to say, Alex, but the dinosaur barbecue chain in New York, some of the best barbecue I've had outside of Austin, Texas.
[03:15:15.433 --> 03:15:20.380]  Locations Baltimore, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Harlem, Newark, Rochester, Stamford.
[03:15:21.141 --> 03:15:26.346]  Syracuse and Troy, New York, taken over, funded now by George Soros.
[03:15:26.566 --> 03:15:31.430]  So, do not eat there, and research every group, the NFL, all of it, it's all enemies.
[03:15:32.151 --> 03:15:38.957]  We are boycotting Dinosaur BBQ, which is a shame, because it's the best BBQ I've had outside of Austin.
[03:15:38.977 --> 03:15:44.962]  You know if he's taking it over, you know, it's what he does, he takes over something good, then he absolutely burns it down like good fellas.
[03:15:45.382 --> 03:15:46.964]  Alright, you're taking over, my friend.
[03:15:47.004 --> 03:15:50.188]  It's a total war for America, 1776 Part 2.
[03:15:50.488 --> 03:15:52.210]  Spread the word, spread the articles, pray for us.
[03:15:52.530 --> 03:15:56.695]  Buy the products and we will defeat that dirty Nazi collaborator.
[03:15:56.916 --> 03:15:58.878]  He's going down, America's rising.
[03:15:59.098 --> 03:16:00.400]  Go to hell, George Soros!
[03:16:00.560 --> 03:16:01.521]  Go to hell, McCain!
[03:16:01.541 --> 03:16:03.783]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running.
[03:16:05.034 --> 03:16:10.358]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:16:10.618 --> 03:16:11.759]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:16:11.999 --> 03:16:14.301]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:16:14.981 --> 03:16:21.486]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:16:21.687 --> 03:16:25.029]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:27.151]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:16:27.791 --> 03:16:36.200]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:16:36.241 --> 03:16:37.202]  They know how great it is.
[03:16:38.123 --> 03:16:41.907]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:16:42.728 --> 03:16:44.169]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:52.875]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[03:16:53.295 --> 03:17:01.800]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[03:17:02.341 --> 03:17:04.762]  That comes to 50.03.
[03:17:04.902 --> 03:17:08.965]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:17:09.365 --> 03:17:12.267]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:17:14.668 --> 03:17:15.529]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:18:36.022 --> 03:18:36.643]  Concentrate.
[03:18:36.683 --> 03:18:38.465]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:18:38.725 --> 03:18:40.147]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:18:40.367 --> 03:18:42.009]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:18:42.409 --> 03:18:43.290]  It's incredible.
[03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:45.672]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:18:45.853 --> 03:18:46.994]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:18:47.454 --> 03:18:48.375]  At 15, incredible.
[03:18:48.696 --> 03:18:49.577]  It is amazing.
[03:18:49.937 --> 03:18:51.198]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:18:51.639 --> 03:18:52.760]  50% off Caveman.
[03:18:52.980 --> 03:18:54.322]  But only a few days left.
[03:18:54.562 --> 03:18:55.303]  It's about to end.
[03:18:55.903 --> 03:18:58.225]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:18:58.666 --> 03:19:03.851]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:04.271 --> 03:19:05.652]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:19:05.892 --> 03:19:07.074]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:19:07.454 --> 03:19:08.275]  I want to thank you.
[03:19:08.595 --> 03:19:09.656]  We're all in this together.
[03:19:10.156 --> 03:19:20.086]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:19:55.576 --> 03:20:00.399]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[03:20:05.882 --> 03:20:08.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.804 --> 03:20:32.186]  This is Bernie Sanders, and I know a lot of my supporters may not believe this, but I listen to Roger Stone whenever he's on InfoWars.
[03:20:32.526 --> 03:20:34.467]  It's a great program, at least in my opinion.
[03:20:42.874 --> 03:20:47.765]  I'm Roger Stone and you're back on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:48.979 --> 03:21:04.445]  When Senator John McCain was standing for re-election in the 2016 elections, Donald J. Trump had swept the Republican primaries and was on his way to sweeping the Arizona primary.
[03:21:05.025 --> 03:21:12.028]  Senator McCain was opposed in that primary in a competitive race by State Senator Kelly Ward.
[03:21:12.908 --> 03:21:41.948]  I implored candidate Trump to endorse Ward or at least withhold his endorsement from John McCain, but Reince Priebus and others persuaded candidate Trump to endorse McCain, who then fairly narrowly won his primary and went on to certain reelection as Donald Trump swept Arizona, as did all Republicans in the November election.
[03:21:42.988 --> 03:21:53.917]  That act of kindness in which Donald Trump could have ended the career of John McCain has been paid back with nothing but treachery since that time.
[03:21:53.997 --> 03:21:58.400]  Now John McCain's red-faced temper tantrums, his
[03:21:59.221 --> 03:22:10.956]  Tourette's-like outbursts of peak, his seething meltdowns, his bitterness and jealousy are things of legend in Washington.
[03:22:11.517 --> 03:22:15.121]  John McCain is not a man in his right mind.
[03:22:15.962 --> 03:22:22.748]  As a Christian, I'm going to ascribe his erratic behavior to his illness.
[03:22:22.848 --> 03:22:28.552]  And of course, we wish him well in that struggle against brain cancer.
[03:22:28.793 --> 03:22:32.616]  But yesterday, John McCain went too far.
[03:22:33.116 --> 03:22:40.042]  He not only attacked our president, but he attacked the movement and the voters that elected him.
[03:22:40.742 --> 03:22:42.704]  This is disgraceful.
[03:22:42.824 --> 03:22:44.365]  I think we may have a clip.
[03:22:45.645 --> 03:22:51.167]  If not, you can see that Drudge led with this item.
[03:22:51.847 --> 03:23:05.771]  Now, Donald Trump, who is a street fighter himself, a brawler, a guy who battled his way not only to the nomination over 15 more experienced candidates, but over the vaunted
[03:23:06.471 --> 03:23:16.860]  Well-oiled, extremely well-financed Clinton machine had words of warning for Senator McCain.
[03:23:17.521 --> 03:23:23.145]  He basically said he's not going to turn the other cheek forever.
[03:23:23.846 --> 03:23:31.387]  He has bitten his tongue as John McCain has scuttled the ObamaCare replacement.
[03:23:32.288 --> 03:23:40.349]  He has bitten his tongue while John McCain said that the Russian collusion scandal was worse than Watergate.
[03:23:40.749 --> 03:23:42.129]  No, Senator, it's not.
[03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:43.209]  You have nothing.
[03:23:44.330 --> 03:23:51.431]  I bit my tongue when Senator John McCain said Roger Stone should be compelled to come before the Senate.
[03:23:52.411 --> 03:24:00.236]  And explain his relationship with Yukonovich, the former president of Ukraine, and the Russians.
[03:24:00.877 --> 03:24:04.078]  Well, Senator, I'm going to say this slowly so you can follow me.
[03:24:04.759 --> 03:24:06.900]  I have no relationship with either.
[03:24:07.561 --> 03:24:09.982]  Your demagoguery is not appreciated.
[03:24:10.322 --> 03:24:12.244]  You owe me an apology.
[03:24:12.304 --> 03:24:15.265]  But while we're at it, Senator, I've got a question for you.
[03:24:16.386 --> 03:24:25.638]  Why did you meet with Oleg Deripaska, who was a bad man oligarch for Vladimir Putin, during your campaign for president?
[03:24:25.999 --> 03:24:32.988]  You were warned by the FBI that he was a Russian agent, but you chose to meet with him anyway.
[03:24:33.669 --> 03:24:36.771]  Here's my follow-up question, Senator McCain.
[03:24:37.111 --> 03:24:49.640]  How much money did you ask him for, for your Republican Institute, a front organization that legally can take foreign funds, unlike your presidential campaign?
[03:24:50.260 --> 03:24:53.462]  John McCain was in bed with Vladimir Putin.
[03:24:53.522 --> 03:24:58.906]  John McCain was the Republican candidate for president colluding with the Russians.
[03:24:59.266 --> 03:25:03.389]  John McCain should be ashamed of himself.
[03:25:04.450 --> 03:25:10.635]  Now, let me turn to the controversy that has dominated the news today.
[03:25:11.155 --> 03:25:23.324]  And that is a claim that President Donald Trump has not reached out to the families of our fallen men and women who die in the line of combat.
[03:25:24.485 --> 03:25:36.251]  This is a manifestation, in all honesty, of sloppy staff work by General John Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff.
[03:25:36.951 --> 03:25:50.818]  I have confirmed that President Trump has either written to or called the parents and families of every fallen soldier whose information has reached the President's desk.
[03:25:51.946 --> 03:26:07.964]  Meaning any serviceman or woman whose family did not get proper respects paid by the President of the United States did not do so because of a failure by General Kelly to provide the President with that information.
[03:26:09.192 --> 03:26:13.874]  General Kelly's supposed to be, well, I'm the source of all information.
[03:26:13.914 --> 03:26:30.362]  And now we have a smear by Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, a black radical from Florida, who claims that the President told a Floridian widow of a serviceman, well, your husband knew what he signed up for.
[03:26:31.303 --> 03:26:33.444]  The President never said that.
[03:26:34.044 --> 03:26:37.606]  And Congresswoman, you look stupid in that cowboy hat.
[03:26:38.908 --> 03:26:42.472]  Congressmen from South Florida don't wear cowboy hats.
[03:26:43.253 --> 03:26:46.357]  It was stupid looking when you wore it in the State Senate.
[03:26:46.817 --> 03:26:49.340]  It's stupid looking when you wear it in the House.
[03:26:49.821 --> 03:26:52.263]  Lose the cowboy hat, will you please?
[03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:59.536]  So, this, again, is the media seeking to distract from the big news.
[03:26:59.636 --> 03:27:00.416]  The big news?
[03:27:00.817 --> 03:27:16.932]  The Obama administration knew about, had proof of, payoffs by the Russian nuclear industry, massive $145 million payoffs to the Clinton Foundation, a half-million-dollar payoff
[03:27:17.312 --> 03:27:35.142]  To former President Bill Clinton in order to get Hillary Clinton to approve the transfer of the control of 20% of the enriched uranium in the United States to the Russians, a company controlled by the Russian state.
[03:27:35.862 --> 03:27:37.503]  James Comey knew.
[03:27:37.904 --> 03:27:41.987]  Robert Mueller, both former FBI directors, they both knew.
[03:27:42.708 --> 03:27:44.950]  Attorney General, pardon me, then U.S.
[03:27:45.010 --> 03:27:47.292]  Attorney Rod Rosenstein knew.
[03:27:47.772 --> 03:27:51.395]  Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe knew.
[03:27:52.316 --> 03:28:00.402]  But no one was informed on the Private Seas Investment Board that had to approve transfer of the uranium control.
[03:28:01.403 --> 03:28:04.288]  Attorney General Eric Holder sits on that board.
[03:28:04.768 --> 03:28:15.364]  He was certainly aware, but he raised no objection to the transfer of this valuable strategic material to the Russians.
[03:28:16.471 --> 03:28:18.753]  So, what does the mainstream media do?
[03:28:18.773 --> 03:28:19.794]  Ah, simple.
[03:28:20.235 --> 03:28:22.417]  We change the subject.
[03:28:22.897 --> 03:28:32.546]  You will not get reporting like this anywhere else on the net or in the mainstream media, which is why I implore you to get to theinfowars.com
[03:28:33.747 --> 03:28:47.814]  Uh, site where we need your support and where Super Male Vitality and Anthroplex, both on extraordinary discount, but the synergy of these two products, the very, very best.

[03:29:10.791 --> 03:29:14.473]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:29:15.154 --> 03:29:21.657]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:29:21.857 --> 03:29:25.199]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:27.321]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:29:27.961 --> 03:29:36.370]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:29:36.411 --> 03:29:37.372]  They know how great it is.

[03:29:42.898 --> 03:29:44.339]  Nootropic means for the brain.

[03:30:02.511 --> 03:30:04.933]  That comes to 50.03.
[03:30:05.073 --> 03:30:09.136]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:30:09.536 --> 03:30:12.438]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:30:14.839 --> 03:30:15.699]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:31:36.172 --> 03:31:36.813]  Concentrate.
[03:31:36.833 --> 03:31:38.614]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:31:38.895 --> 03:31:40.316]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:31:40.536 --> 03:31:42.178]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:31:42.578 --> 03:31:43.439]  It's incredible.
[03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:45.821]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:31:46.022 --> 03:31:47.183]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:31:47.623 --> 03:31:48.544]  At 15, incredible.
[03:31:48.864 --> 03:31:49.745]  It is amazing.
[03:31:50.106 --> 03:31:51.367]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:52.147 --> 03:31:52.928]  50% off Caveman.
[03:31:53.148 --> 03:31:54.470]  But only a few days left.
[03:31:54.730 --> 03:31:55.471]  It's about to end.
[03:31:56.071 --> 03:31:58.392]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:31:58.833 --> 03:32:04.016]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:32:04.436 --> 03:32:05.817]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:32:06.077 --> 03:32:07.237]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:32:07.638 --> 03:32:08.438]  I want to thank you.
[03:32:08.758 --> 03:32:09.799]  We're all in this together.
[03:32:10.319 --> 03:32:20.225]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:36.377]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[03:32:36.637 --> 03:32:41.982]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[03:32:55.750 --> 03:33:00.553]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[03:33:05.255 --> 03:33:07.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:28.851]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor, Mr. 9-11, Rudy Giuliani.
[03:33:29.132 --> 03:33:32.053]  And you're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:33:35.775 --> 03:33:39.617]  That was America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani.
[03:33:39.797 --> 03:33:52.243]  I dare say if he were Attorney General today, regardless of what you may think of him, I have a feeling that Hillary Clinton would be behind bars and her husband Bill and her daughter with
[03:33:53.504 --> 03:33:57.966]  Webb Hubble, Chelsea Clinton would be on her way there as well.
[03:33:58.846 --> 03:34:11.151]  Joining us now, a very special guest, we have Pastor Mark Burns, who is the pastor of the Harvest Praise and Worship Center in Easley, South Carolina.
[03:34:12.472 --> 03:34:18.397]  Pastor Burns was labeled by Time Magazine as Donald Trump's top pastor.
[03:34:18.517 --> 03:34:26.944]  He was named by one of the 16 people who helped shape the 2016 presidential election by Yahoo News.
[03:34:28.005 --> 03:34:31.488]  And he has been an outspoken defender
[03:34:32.408 --> 03:34:34.149]  Of President Donald Trump.
[03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:44.272]  Now, many, many people have been talking about the prospect of getting my friend Pastor Mark Burns to run for public office.
[03:34:44.672 --> 03:34:47.833]  Some speak about his running for Lieutenant Governor.
[03:34:48.033 --> 03:34:52.235]  Others say he'd make a great Secretary of State or State Comptroller.
[03:34:52.595 --> 03:34:59.177]  Still, others are urging him to challenge RINO Lindsey Graham down the road.
[03:35:00.017 --> 03:35:12.065]  Here's what people don't know, and that is that Mark Burns started by playing the keyboards and singing gospel music with a family group, the Burns Brothers of Belton, South Carolina.
[03:35:12.245 --> 03:35:21.370]  Now, I for one believe it's time for somebody in the United States Senate who can really rock out, and I think that's Mark Burns.
[03:35:21.430 --> 03:35:23.712]  Welcome to InfoWars, Pastor Burns.
[03:35:24.292 --> 03:35:25.513]  Thanks for having me, Roger.
[03:35:25.593 --> 03:35:26.754]  I love that intro.
[03:35:28.035 --> 03:35:31.517]  Well, this is, I think, important.
[03:35:31.738 --> 03:35:39.844]  I tweeted the other day that you were even casually considering public office and that many, many South Carolina Republicans have
[03:35:40.524 --> 03:35:53.813]  Openly urged you to challenge Lindsey Graham, who has been a thorn in the side of our president, kind of the Sancho Panza to John McCain, king of the rhinos.
[03:35:54.673 --> 03:36:05.120]  We all wish Senator McCain well with his health problems, but I had no idea after I tweeted this, the firestorm it would engender.
[03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:13.523]  I've learned that you have many, many friends and admirers in South Carolina, both Republican and Democrat.
[03:36:13.964 --> 03:36:25.849]  And I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that you have been willing to stand up and say things that no one else is willing to say, particularly on the issues of the Confederate statutes and our heritage.
[03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:30.531]  So, why is it that many people seem to be flocking to your standard?
[03:36:31.564 --> 03:36:37.988]  Well, you know, Roger, again, people are tired of people saying one thing and doing another.
[03:36:38.388 --> 03:36:40.570]  People are tired of identity politics.
[03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:50.216]  People are tired of this race war and these false accusations of oppression from, you know, the Department of Justice.
[03:36:50.296 --> 03:36:51.697]  People really just want the truth.
[03:36:51.797 --> 03:37:01.023]  This attack on the Confederate statues will, you know, pulling a statue down would add not one dollar to a black person's bank account.
[03:37:01.523 --> 03:37:02.925]  And this is what Donald Trump gets.
[03:37:02.985 --> 03:37:18.862]  He understands I'm not going to focus on the fruit of the problem, which is race wars, identity politics led by the limbs, liberals and the Democrats, but I'm going to deal with the root of the problem, which is a lack of jobs.
[03:37:19.583 --> 03:37:21.185]  And Donald Trump understands that.
[03:37:21.991 --> 03:37:27.495]  No, it seems to me the entire argument about these statues is an argument about the past.
[03:37:27.675 --> 03:37:29.836]  I'm more interested in the future.
[03:37:31.717 --> 03:37:36.421]  All the black people I know, they're interested in economic opportunity.
[03:37:36.641 --> 03:37:39.343]  They're interested in safer and better schools.
[03:37:39.723 --> 03:37:43.505]  They're interested in living in safer and more secure neighborhoods.
[03:37:44.206 --> 03:37:48.188]  Everybody I know in that community wants their piece of the American pie.
[03:37:48.829 --> 03:37:51.471]  They don't want to argue about things that happened a hundred years ago.
[03:37:52.111 --> 03:38:04.921]  To me, I think it disrespects Abraham Lincoln, Dr. Martin Luther King, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Malcolm X. These men led, and they've made progress.
[03:38:05.021 --> 03:38:08.384]  No, we are not perfect, but we are making progress.
[03:38:08.444 --> 03:38:11.006]  And I think you have said these kinds of things.
[03:38:11.406 --> 03:38:13.668]  I think it's why many people are rallying to you.
[03:38:14.534 --> 03:38:16.255]  Well, you know, it's not about protest.
[03:38:16.295 --> 03:38:18.077]  We've got to get out of the protest mindset.
[03:38:18.517 --> 03:38:21.719]  We've got to get out of protest and we've got to focus on progress.
[03:38:22.059 --> 03:38:23.260]  How do we move forward?
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:29.485]  Again, focusing on statues, focusing on the Confederate movement back a hundred years ago.
[03:38:30.185 --> 03:38:33.387]  It changes nothing for us today.
[03:38:33.527 --> 03:38:36.229]  It is not about civil rights today.
[03:38:36.329 --> 03:38:38.331]  It's about economic rights.
[03:38:38.771 --> 03:38:41.353]  Again, poverty knows no color.
[03:38:41.966 --> 03:38:49.155]  You know, what's happening in poor black communities is happening also in poor white communities.
[03:38:49.635 --> 03:39:01.490]  And the goal is we've got to focus on the real issues, which is jobs, changing the focus on this racial divide that is not bringing us together and start really dealing with the issues that's going to change
[03:39:01.970 --> 03:39:03.833]  All American lives in our country.
[03:39:04.013 --> 03:39:08.459]  Again, as long as we're focusing on the protest, nothing will never change.
[03:39:08.539 --> 03:39:09.120]  Progress.
[03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:10.161]  How do we move forward?
[03:39:10.221 --> 03:39:11.062]  How do we work together?
[03:39:11.343 --> 03:39:13.526]  And how do we bring our arms hand-in-hand together?
[03:39:13.626 --> 03:39:16.329]  And that's the movement that's taking place.
[03:39:16.590 --> 03:39:18.913]  And you're right, Roger, I'm just blown away about
[03:39:19.413 --> 03:39:27.877]  And the flattered of the so many people around the country that is saying, Pastor, you need to run against Lindsey Graham.
[03:39:28.037 --> 03:39:29.358]  Again, I'm so flattered.
[03:39:29.398 --> 03:39:33.219]  My number one focus right now is to just do what you said.
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:38.021]  Focus on the real issues that are plaguing our communities, African-American communities.
[03:39:38.161 --> 03:39:38.602]  And guess what?
[03:39:38.662 --> 03:39:39.902]  Black people don't want to hand out.
[03:39:40.743 --> 03:39:41.303]  They don't want to.
[03:39:41.363 --> 03:39:42.103]  They want to hand up.
[03:39:42.603 --> 03:39:43.544]  They want opportunities.
[03:39:44.184 --> 03:39:46.025]  They want a chance to say, listen,
[03:39:46.625 --> 03:39:49.407]  I did this because I'm a hard worker like Dr. King.
[03:39:49.447 --> 03:39:55.050]  You're not going to judge me based off the color of my skin, but by the content of my character.
[03:39:55.771 --> 03:40:06.137]  And so people are tired of these identity politics and they want real people who are going to stand up just like Donald Trump and just like Hillary McMaster, the governor of this great state of South Carolina.
[03:40:06.217 --> 03:40:08.438]  I'm really adamant and I'm focused.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.161]  Well, I saw that both you and the President endorsed Henry McMaster.
[03:40:21.261 --> 03:40:24.682]  I have, of course, known the Governor back to his days as a U.S.
[03:40:24.742 --> 03:40:25.242]  Attorney.
[03:40:25.662 --> 03:40:31.464]  He is most definitely the right man for that job and the man to lead South Carolina forward.
[03:40:32.404 --> 03:40:38.267]  I hope he selects a Lieutenant Governor candidate who can help him in the African American community.
[03:40:38.847 --> 03:40:43.530]  And yes, I do have somebody in mind who I think meets that criteria.
[03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:49.713]  I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here, but Lindsey Graham, that's three and a half years away.
[03:40:50.393 --> 03:40:50.653]  I don't
[03:41:20.495 --> 03:41:20.861]  You do.
[03:41:22.458 --> 03:41:41.726]  I do want to mention that people can reach out to you at Burns, hashtag Burns54244, if you want to get in touch with Pastor Burns and help in his movement to make both South Carolina and America great again.
[03:41:41.746 --> 03:41:47.148]  When it comes to race issues, when it comes to economic issues, this man speaks the truth.
[03:41:47.628 --> 03:41:51.070]  He speaks to me, that's why I have been impressed
[03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:55.152]  by the number of people that are urging him to step forward.
[03:41:55.292 --> 03:41:56.673]  It's a sacrifice, folks.
[03:41:57.353 --> 03:42:01.575]  Don't think that Donald Trump ran for president because he needed to be somebody.
[03:42:01.635 --> 03:42:03.596]  He was already somebody.
[03:42:04.076 --> 03:42:06.738]  Pastor Mark Burns is already somebody.
[03:42:07.098 --> 03:42:09.639]  He's already having an impact on his community.
[03:42:09.839 --> 03:42:14.202]  It would be a burden, a sacrifice, to run for public office.
[03:42:14.322 --> 03:42:20.445]  But leaders must lead, and if folks like Mark Burns don't step forward, then we are stuck with the
[03:42:20.885 --> 03:42:22.366]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[03:42:22.426 --> 03:42:24.047]  I'm so honored to be here.
[03:42:24.147 --> 03:42:30.489]  And again, for everyone that is watching, just pull out your cell phone and text Burns, my last name, to the number 5-4-2-4-4.
[03:42:30.549 --> 03:42:32.530]  And I'll be able to connect with you personally.
[03:42:49.378 --> 03:42:52.422]  God bless you, Pastor Burns, and come back and see us.
[03:42:52.542 --> 03:42:53.383]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:53.863 --> 03:42:56.006]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:56.426 --> 03:42:57.007]  Stay with us.
[03:43:05.495 --> 03:43:10.838]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:43:11.098 --> 03:43:12.218]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:43:12.478 --> 03:43:14.780]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:21.943]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:43:22.163 --> 03:43:25.485]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:43:25.805 --> 03:43:27.606]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:43:28.266 --> 03:43:36.679]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:37.621]  They know how great it is.
[03:43:38.573 --> 03:43:42.356]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:43:43.177 --> 03:43:44.698]  Nootropic means for the brain.

[03:44:09.821 --> 03:44:12.964]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:44:13.004 --> 03:44:13.966]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:45:27.068 --> 03:45:35.919]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[03:45:36.480 --> 03:45:37.121]  Concentrate.
[03:45:37.141 --> 03:45:38.923]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:45:39.183 --> 03:45:40.605]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:45:40.625 --> 03:45:42.467]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:45:42.887 --> 03:45:43.748]  It's incredible.
[03:45:44.228 --> 03:45:46.150]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:45:46.331 --> 03:45:47.472]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:45:47.932 --> 03:45:48.833]  At 15, incredible.
[03:45:49.154 --> 03:45:50.035]  It is amazing.
[03:45:50.395 --> 03:45:51.676]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:52.117 --> 03:45:53.238]  50% off Caveman.
[03:45:53.458 --> 03:45:54.780]  But only a few days left.
[03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:55.781]  It's about to end.
[03:45:56.361 --> 03:45:58.683]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:45:59.143 --> 03:46:04.308]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:46:04.728 --> 03:46:06.129]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:07.530]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:46:07.931 --> 03:46:08.731]  I want to thank you.
[03:46:09.051 --> 03:46:10.112]  We're all in this together.
[03:46:10.633 --> 03:46:20.541]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:46:26.746 --> 03:46:36.674]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[03:46:36.935 --> 03:46:42.279]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[03:46:42.780 --> 03:46:47.424]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[03:46:48.044 --> 03:46:51.047]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever.
[03:46:51.087 --> 03:46:55.690]  And when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:56.051 --> 03:47:00.874]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[03:47:05.718 --> 03:47:08.381]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.088 --> 03:47:27.612]  This is Bernie Sanders, and there's a lot of corruption in this country.
[03:47:28.073 --> 03:47:33.660]  And if you want to hear about corruption, then you'll listen to Roger Stone on InfoWars, because he tells the truth.
[03:47:39.620 --> 03:47:50.588]  This is Vintage Rolling Stones, a piece written by Chuck Berry called Carol, one of the legendary covers by the Stones in the 1960s.
[03:47:51.709 --> 03:47:56.693]  As we said in the first segment, we have learned that the Nazi collaborator
[03:47:57.393 --> 03:48:19.849]  And far-left troublemaker George Soros, the man who WikiLeaks revealed paid for the fomenting of violence at Donald Trump's campaign rallies, the man who is paying for the phony lawsuit by Protect Democracy that accuses me completely falsely and without evidence of having
[03:48:20.549 --> 03:48:46.071]  colluded with the Russians to hack the DNC and give the information to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, a stone-cold lie, a falsehood, a myth, a fairy tale, a steaming plate of horse pucky that has been served up by the Democrats in the House and Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:48:46.091 --> 03:48:46.872]  Mr. Soros
[03:48:47.392 --> 03:48:55.480]  has taken majority control of the dinosaur barbecue chain in the Northeastern United States.
[03:48:55.580 --> 03:48:57.882]  Now, this is a tragedy.
[03:48:58.022 --> 03:49:03.928]  Thanks to Jonathan Tillov of the Austin American Statesman, I've had
[03:49:04.548 --> 03:49:09.291]  The privilege to have some of the finest barbecue in Austin, Texas.
[03:49:09.491 --> 03:49:15.234]  Austin, for those of you who don't know it, is the barbecue capital of the world.
[03:49:15.454 --> 03:49:20.417]  There is no better barbecue anywhere on the face of the planet.
[03:49:20.497 --> 03:49:22.598]  Sorry, you North Carolinians.
[03:49:23.498 --> 03:49:27.941]  But I must admit, Dinosaur was a go-to favorite.
[03:49:28.921 --> 03:49:33.422]  They have a location in Harlem, New York, not far from my place.
[03:49:33.563 --> 03:49:38.724]  I live between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
[03:49:38.824 --> 03:49:41.345]  Boulevards, when in New York.
[03:49:42.185 --> 03:49:53.248]  And their locations, Baltimore, Brooklyn, Buffalo, where it all started, Newark, Rochester, Stanford, Connecticut, Syracuse, New York, and Troy, New York.
[03:49:53.489 --> 03:49:54.409]  This is a pity!
[03:49:55.109 --> 03:49:56.510]  Folks, I'm imploring you.
[03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:58.250]  Boycott Soros.
[03:49:58.730 --> 03:50:00.631]  Boycott Dinosaur.
[03:50:00.751 --> 03:50:02.552]  Goodbye Dino.
[03:50:03.072 --> 03:50:10.835]  We're not giving our money to a Nazi collaborator who is fomenting violence in the United States.
[03:50:10.935 --> 03:50:16.197]  We know who paid for the phony violence in Charlottesville.
[03:50:17.077 --> 03:50:33.089]  We could tell a false flag operation when this fellow Kessler, who is suddenly a white supremacist, admits that only a year ago he was an Obama backer doing demonstrations and violence on behalf of Occupy.
[03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:36.131]  Doesn't sound like a right-winger to me.
[03:50:36.571 --> 03:50:38.853]  Sounds to me like a false flag.
[03:50:40.492 --> 03:50:43.314]  Folks, join me on this boycott.
[03:50:43.655 --> 03:50:47.718]  Let's inflict a little bit of pain on Mr. Soros.
[03:50:48.619 --> 03:50:58.367]  The other issue that comes before us today is the entire question of the cover-up and what will happen next.
[03:50:58.507 --> 03:51:01.150]  Now, John Solomon of The Hill
[03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:09.054]  Sarah Carter of Circa News and our friend Sean Hannity breaking enormous news yesterday.
[03:51:09.074 --> 03:51:14.537]  We previewed it here on InfoWars as early as yesterday morning.
[03:51:15.538 --> 03:51:19.100]  What we have caught is a massive bribery plot
[03:51:19.540 --> 03:51:44.957]  Where the Obama administration, the FBI, the Justice Department were well known to them that there were massive million-dollar bribes by the Russians, that there was $145 million funneled to the Clinton Foundation, that there was another half million dollars given to former President
[03:51:45.197 --> 03:51:49.899]  Bill Clinton to ensure the transfer of our technology.
[03:51:50.459 --> 03:51:52.981]  And who led this investigation?
[03:51:53.081 --> 03:51:59.904]  Why it was for at first FBI Director Robert Mueller, then under FBI Director James Comey,
[03:52:00.684 --> 03:52:06.986]  All under Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe and directed by none other than then U.S.
[03:52:07.046 --> 03:52:09.346]  Attorney Rod Rosenstein.
[03:52:09.406 --> 03:52:24.890]  These are the very men who have set up President Donald Trump for the coup in which Rosenstein, on nobody's authority, appointed Mueller to investigate a non-crime, to find a crime.
[03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:28.431]  You see, folks, special counsel, special prosecutors,
[03:52:29.733 --> 03:52:39.503]  are normally appointed when there's evidence of a crime and the Justice Department for some reason has a conflict of interest.
[03:52:40.244 --> 03:52:46.950]  In this case, Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller when there was no evidence of a crime.
[03:52:47.711 --> 03:52:51.235]  There are two separate questions here and they're important.
[03:52:51.955 --> 03:53:01.161]  One is the question of whether the Russians sought to effect our election through some poorly written and badly targeted Facebook ads.
[03:53:01.762 --> 03:53:03.383]  The answer appears to be yes.
[03:53:03.903 --> 03:53:21.435]  Then there is the question of whether Donald Trump or Trump associates or Trump family members or Trump campaign ads or Trump friends of many years standing colluded, coordinated or conspired with the Russians to help elect Donald Trump.
[03:53:22.336 --> 03:53:30.503]  And there is, to this day, not a scintilla of evidence, not an iota of evidence that that was the case.
[03:53:32.204 --> 03:53:41.412]  The senator from North Carolina, former used car dealer Richard Burr, was forced to come out and said, well, so far we have no evidence.
[03:53:42.293 --> 03:54:00.502]  And then Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee, who stunningly claimed in the hearing in which I participated that the FBI was allowed to examine the server of the DNC.
[03:54:01.542 --> 03:54:29.395]  Backed up by Congresswoman Jackie Speier, and vigorously contested by Congressman Trey Gowdy, who pointed out that James Comey and Secretary Johnson both sat before the Intelligence Committee and swore under oath that the DNC did not let the FBI examine their servers to see if there ever was really a hack.
[03:54:30.595 --> 03:54:38.002]  So I think it's incumbent on Congressman Schiff and Congressman Speier to clarify their comments.
[03:54:38.222 --> 03:54:43.947]  If they know something we don't know, they have some obligation to tell the American people.
[03:54:44.628 --> 03:54:46.569]  But the Nation Magazine piece
[03:54:47.290 --> 03:55:03.479]  Highlighting the veterans of intelligence like William Binney, Ray McGovern and others who have pointed out that the hard science indicates that the DNC was never hacked by anyone.
[03:55:04.039 --> 03:55:05.759]  Never mind the Russians.
[03:55:06.159 --> 03:55:29.344]  That this narrative was invented by John Podesta and the Democrats to distract from what we now know from yesterday's disclosures was a million-dollar scam to have the Russians line the pockets of the Clintons in return for control of 20% of America's enriched uranium.
[03:55:30.644 --> 03:55:33.205]  What we have here, folks, is a cover-up.
[03:55:34.096 --> 03:55:49.669]  My question yesterday was, since it was The Hill and Circa News and InfoWars and Sean Hannity making these exposures, would the mainstream media pick up this story and do it justice?
[03:55:50.530 --> 03:56:03.995]  Now that Senator Chuck Grassley's Senate Judiciary Committee has launched an open investigation into this treachery, it is highly unlikely that a cover-up can be successful.
[03:56:04.755 --> 03:56:18.680]  Folks, this is the kind of breaking news you can only get at InfoWars, which is why I again ask you, go to the InfoWars.com store, where we have some extraordinary specials going on.
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:24.523]  For a limited time, bio-true selenium is 40% off.
[03:56:24.684 --> 03:56:33.730]  Now, you cannot get better 100% organic selenium, which was made, truthfully, from mustard seeds.
[03:56:34.310 --> 03:56:40.914]  This is an essential trace mineral that you need in a highly potent all-natural supplement.
[03:56:41.515 --> 03:56:49.140]  It can boost your cardiovascular and thyroid health, and it keeps the body moving and functioning at our healthiest.
[03:56:49.900 --> 03:56:55.583]  I have found adding this to my regimen has really helped my workouts.
[03:56:55.883 --> 03:57:03.027]  I have been able to run longer, do cardio longer, and I'm no fan of the cardio, I admit it.
[03:57:03.848 --> 03:57:09.811]  At the same time, you've got an extraordinary special on Secret 12, which is 40% off.
[03:57:11.852 --> 03:57:16.796]  These products are not going to last very long with these deep discounts.
[03:57:17.496 --> 03:57:24.041]  Alex Jones has really gone crazy, in my view, and is offering now Brain Force at 50% off.
[03:57:26.411 --> 03:57:30.593]  You're talking about super male vitality at 30% off.

[03:57:35.756 --> 03:57:39.959]  You're talking about bio true selenium at 50% off.
[03:57:40.499 --> 03:57:44.481]  Take advantage of these deep discounts today.
[03:57:44.501 --> 03:57:47.323]  Help us fight the globalists.
[03:57:47.703 --> 03:57:49.604]  Make George Soros unhappy.
[03:57:49.885 --> 03:57:51.886]  Place your order today.
[03:57:53.015 --> 03:58:04.681]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:58:05.261 --> 03:58:07.342]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:58:07.522 --> 03:58:10.344]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:58:10.784 --> 03:58:11.985]  It's made in the USA.
[03:58:12.725 --> 03:58:21.113]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:58:21.453 --> 03:58:23.415]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:58:23.915 --> 03:58:27.699]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:34.946]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[03:58:36.138 --> 03:58:36.839]  And of strength.
[03:58:37.800 --> 03:58:41.182]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[03:58:41.603 --> 03:58:49.189]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years since we launched InfoWars Live to actually come up with this.
[03:58:49.990 --> 03:58:59.718]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier.
