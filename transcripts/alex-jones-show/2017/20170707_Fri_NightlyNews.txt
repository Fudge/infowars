[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.563]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.465]  It's Friday, July 7th, 2017.
[00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:24.288]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:25.450]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:33.553]  What to expect when Trump meets Putin?
[00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:47.219]  The fate of U.S.-Russian relations hangs in the balance at the G20 summit, as the establishment neocons pressure Trump to take the hard line on Assad and Ukraine.
[00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:54.502]  But so far, it looks like they've agreed to a historical ceasefire in Syria.
[00:00:55.242 --> 00:01:09.808]  Then, while the Democrats are in denial that millions of illegals voted for crooked Hillary, the Trump administration is gathering evidence of massive voter fraud in the 2016 election.
[00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:17.871]  Meanwhile, 44 states, plus D.C., refuse to cooperate with the President's investigation.
[00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:22.753]  All that, plus much more, up next on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.206]  We're good to go.

[00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.511]  I'm good.
[00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.585]  Ultimate victory over CNN.
[00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:47.212]  Well, it was the big day that President Donald Trump met President Vladimir Putin, and I was monitoring liberal media very strictly all day long because I wanted to look for a talking point.
[00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:57.137]  Now, you'll see the headline in this story from The Guardian, Trump to meet Putin for first time after accusing Russia of testing West's will.
[00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:07.773]  Now here's the talking point that I have been trying to look for in liberal media, and really in all media, and that is Trump meets Putin for the first time.
[00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:15.156]  Now I assumed that this is how the mainstream media was going to report it, but they always added a caveat.
[00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:23.819]  They always added, since saying Russia is testing the West's will, since Trump said Russia hacked the election, since this, or first time in G20.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:46.272]  Nobody wanted to commit to the statement that this was the first time that Donald Trump met Vladimir Putin ever because they've been reporting that Trump and Russia and Trump and Putin have been colluding for the last two years and I guess you would have to assume that they've been colluding longer than two years with all the accusations that are being thrown out there with what they're colluding on.
[00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.493]  But nobody wanted to report it that way.
[00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:49.453]  It was amazing to me.
[00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:52.054]  So, of course they wouldn't report it that way.
[00:04:52.494 --> 00:05:01.938]  We can't say that this is the first time that President Trump ever met Vladimir Putin because we've been telling you that they've been colluding for the last year, two years, three years, five years, who knows how long.
[00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:06.206]  So I found that interesting, but the meeting did take place today.
[00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:09.268]  Everyone's talking about this meeting.
[00:05:09.348 --> 00:05:10.688]  They had constant updates.
[00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:13.610]  The Associated Press has an updated board.
[00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.912]  They were literally updating you every five minutes on what's going on.
[00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:23.556]  The latest, Senator tells Trump to uphold Russian sanctions, but from everything we can tell,
[00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:35.847]  Vladimir Putin and President Trump got along, and then the biggest news, if you want to discuss President Trump meeting President Putin, has to be U.S.
[00:05:35.988 --> 00:05:39.409]  and Russia reaching deal on Syrian ceasefire.
[00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:41.670]  This is the big news.
[00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.270]  U.S.
[00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.992]  officials say the United States and Russia have reached an agreement for a ceasefire in southwest Syria.
[00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:51.234]  The ceasefire is set to take effect July 9 at noon, Damascus time.
[00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:53.915]  Now this is an interesting thing to keep an eye on, folks.
[00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.030]  You know that they were planning another chemical attack.
[00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.991]  They've been building it up.
[00:05:59.071 --> 00:06:02.252]  Nikki Haley said as soon as something happens in Syria, we're going to blame Assad.
[00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.994]  So now there's been a ceasefire declared between Russia and the United States.
[00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:07.915]  Is this going to be a good thing?
[00:06:07.975 --> 00:06:08.556]  A bad thing?
[00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:14.579]  How is that going to be twisted if they try to pull another chemical attack that they've been building with McCain's
[00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.271]  Rebels that could be ISIS fighters in the Syrian region.
[00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:32.538]  But the big news is you have to like the fact that President Trump and President Putin came together today, agreed on a ceasefire, and everybody's talking about the body language, positive body language, shaking hands, pointing, smiling, having a laugh.
[00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:36.640]  So, and even the people that I was talking to were talking about the body language.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.000]  Looks like Putin really likes Trump.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.261]  Looks like Trump really likes Putin.
[00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:41.162]  Looks like they really hit it off, really got along.
[00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:42.783]  So, that is good news.
[00:06:43.885 --> 00:07:07.100]  We want a strong relationship with Russia and I think that that's another reason why there's been so much levied against Russia as far as claims that they've hacked election or hacked this or done this or done that because they don't want the United States have a strong relationship with Russia and it appears that that is going to be the case if the trend continues of President Trump and President Putin getting along.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.161]  So far that's what we've seen in day one.
[00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:11.183]  Now here's a quick picture.
[00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:12.204]  I don't know.
[00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:27.023]  You see, they had it all lined up to be balanced, and there's that little gap in the top right.
[00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:42.827]  That's because the little manlet, Emmanuel Macron, slithered down into the front row, and he actually tried to bully his way into the front row to Trump's left, to bully his way in front of the guy, I can't tell who that is, in the blue suit.
[00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:46.588]  And Trump and the guy in the blue suit were like, what are you doing here, you little manlet?
[00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:47.589]  Get out of here!
[00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:56.699]  And he kind of got shimmied off to the side and so now he's standing awkwardly on the side where he doesn't belong instead of up in the corner where he did belong to make the picture balanced.
[00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:00.463]  That's the little manlet Macron who says he's going to rule.
[00:08:00.483 --> 00:08:05.869]  He's going to rule like the god Jupiter and he's going to make vaccinations forced.
[00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:07.610]  He's going to force you to take vaccinations.
[00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:12.363]  And so the little manlet, Macron, thought the whole thing was about him and had to get next to Trump.
[00:08:12.423 --> 00:08:13.344]  Sorry, Macron.
[00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:15.026]  You're not comparable to Trump.
[00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:16.047]  You are a nothing.
[00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:23.855]  In fact, you probably wanted to get down to the front row because you're so short that you were worried you wouldn't be in the picture, but that is none of my business.
[00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:34.620]  Now, one of the first things Trump tweeted after going to the G20, everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.601]  Disgraceful.
[00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:39.903]  Well, this is incredible, if you think about it, because if this is true,
[00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.150]  What are they talking about?
[00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.331]  Why would they be talking about Podesta?
[00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:46.833]  Why would Podesta be a talking point?
[00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.776]  Oh, maybe everybody read the emails.
[00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.479]  Maybe people looked at what Podesta's emails had in them.
[00:08:53.799 --> 00:09:02.506]  Maybe people are looking at the Democratic Party, people like Caleb Schwartz who got arrested for having child pornography on the computer, Anthony Weiner texting minors, sexting minors.
[00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.414]  Maybe that's why they're wondering, whoa, what did Podesta have on those email servers?
[00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:08.555]  What was in Podesta's email?
[00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:09.476]  Why won't he cooperate?
[00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:11.037]  Why isn't he turning this over to DHS?
[00:09:11.338 --> 00:09:11.558]  Huh.
[00:09:11.858 --> 00:09:12.799]  People are talking about it.
[00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:14.060]  Could be a story there.
[00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:16.170]  Now, this is wild.
[00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.051]  This actually just broke.
[00:09:18.652 --> 00:09:20.573]  Now, okay, I won't even cover this.
[00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:23.555]  John Podesta gets on Twitter and he responds.
[00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:25.337]  Basically, Podesta's come totally unhinged.
[00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:33.082]  He's on a cross-country road trip with his wife and he decides to, he's so triggered by Trump's tweet that he decides to respond seven different times.
[00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:35.744]  You can go down and look at all these tweets he has.
[00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:37.926]  He's basically come completely unhinged.
[00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:40.328]  And then this just breaks right before we go on air.
[00:09:41.604 --> 00:09:45.448]  John Podesta calls into MSNBC to respond to Trump tweets.
[00:09:45.748 --> 00:09:46.589]  He's unhinged.
[00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:49.832]  Now, these are some of the things that Podesta said.
[00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:53.235]  Russians hacked my email to help win for Trump.
[00:09:53.536 --> 00:09:56.959]  Okay, so you're again admitting that the contents of the email are real.
[00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.161]  Wow, shocking what's in your email, John.
[00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:04.847]  Podesta also said he's parroting the 17 Intel agencies.
[00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:05.828]  He calls in
[00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:09.378]  Seriously, folks, I can't even believe this happened.
[00:10:09.758 --> 00:10:12.140]  He calls into the show, and he's saying this.
[00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:15.003]  He's parroting 17 intel agencies saying it was Russia.
[00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:16.284]  That's fake news!
[00:10:16.504 --> 00:10:18.266]  That's already been confirmed fake news.
[00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:25.292]  Then Matthews, Chris Matthews, the host of the show, goes on to say, and Putin's the only one who knows if the Russian dossier is real or not.
[00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:28.135]  Another thing that's completely debunked is fake news.
[00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:33.779]  Then Podesta says that Trump is unhinged, as those two characters are talking about fake news.
[00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:43.403]  Podesta goes on, he's upset that Trump isn't harder on Russia, considering they're now meddling in the French election, they're meddling in the German election, they're a threat to a democracy.
[00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:45.906]  Meanwhile, the DNC is being sued.
[00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:47.248]  Okay?
[00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:48.509]  We've got...
[00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:54.125]  A voter integrity campaign started by President Trump that a lot of states aren't cooperating with.
[00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:55.125]  We'll get to that in a second.
[00:10:55.786 --> 00:11:01.127]  And then Matthews goes on and calls John Podesta his buddy and says, can't believe we lost to that guy.
[00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:05.148]  Well, what does that say about you, Chris Matthews and John Podesta?
[00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:07.068]  You're total losers.
[00:11:07.988 --> 00:11:08.929]  That's what that says.
[00:11:09.409 --> 00:11:12.729]  Unbelievable that he would call in to a show like that.
[00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.090]  Let's get to this story.
[00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:18.933]  Trump to meet Putin for first time.
[00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:19.974]  I'm sorry, here we go.
[00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:21.055]  This is from CNN.
[00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:22.796]  44 states and D.C.
[00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.978]  have refused to give voter information to Trump Commission.
[00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.879]  Guys, I don't know if we'll make that clip that I had planned.
[00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.140]  We might just pitch it to the Bound Report, because I want to get to this.
[00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.062]  First of all, this headline is misleading.
[00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:38.905]  The reason why a lot of these states aren't turning over the information to the commission is not because they're refusing to cooperate with Trump.
[00:11:39.426 --> 00:11:43.429]  It's because certain information they're not allowed to turn over by law.
[00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:50.736]  And a lot of the states also haven't even reviewed the letter yet and are still waiting to get back to the commission.
[00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:55.680]  So, and then some of them again saying they could, they supported it, but they simply couldn't because of the law.
[00:11:56.161 --> 00:11:58.303]  And again, this is an election integrity commission.
[00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:08.038]  Okay, and this is from an executive order in May, signed by Trump, requesting some voter data to check on the integrity of our elections.
[00:12:08.618 --> 00:12:16.301]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are crying, Russia, Russia, Russia, but Trump starts the Voter Integrity Committee and they have nothing to say about that.
[00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:23.285]  And again, they always say, this is from CNN, months after Trump claimed without evidence that millions had voted illegally.
[00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:28.187]  I mean, it's like, we have so much evidence in voter fraud from so many elections, it's like, why do you even doubt that?
[00:12:29.488 --> 00:12:38.318]  And so the Vice Chairman, who is Chris Kovach, the Secretary of State of Kansas, is requesting only public information.
[00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:42.502]  And he said the purpose of the commission is to find facts and put them on the table.
[00:12:43.003 --> 00:12:44.484]  It's a bipartisan commission.
[00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:49.311]  Every state that responded to the Commission's letter said it could not provide Social Security numbers.
[00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:54.694]  For example, others said they consider information such as birthdates and party affiliations to be private.
[00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.415]  So again, this is all about law.
[00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:59.657]  Some places you can't get the last four digits of the Social Security.
[00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:02.978]  Some places you can't get birthdates, you can't get dates, you can't get this, you can't get that.
[00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:04.259]  Other states you can.
[00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:06.961]  You can actually buy this information from the Secretary of State.
[00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:09.262]  It's kind of shocking, but it is true.
[00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:14.122]  And then you go on and you listen to some of these responses.
[00:13:14.963 --> 00:13:25.316]  For example, Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor, says, this entire commission is based on the false notion that there was widespread voter fraud last November.
[00:13:25.617 --> 00:13:26.258]  So again, though.
[00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:44.537]  This is Terry McCullough from the Democrat Party who has been crying that Russia's hacking the election, Russia's meddling in the election, Russia's influencing our elections, and then from the other side of their mouth will tell you that any notion that there's any voter fraud is completely fake news.
[00:13:45.481 --> 00:14:01.535]  So, again, they're sitting here saying, Russia's meddling in our election, the integrity of the election is in question because of Russian hacking, Russian meddling, and then Trump says, well, let's set up a voter integrity committee, let's get down to the brass tacks here, and then Terry McAuliffe of the Democrats says, there's nothing to see here!
[00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:07.660]  There's no voter fraud, absolutely, all that stuff that we've been saying about the Russians, just ignore that!
[00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:18.032]  Alex Padilla from California says, I will not provide sensitive voter information to a commission that has already inaccurately passed judgment that millions of Californians voted illegally.
[00:14:18.453 --> 00:14:24.978]  California's participation would only serve to legitimize the false and already debunked claims of massive voter fraud made by the president.
[00:14:25.438 --> 00:14:28.220]  But again, they complain about Russia, and we don't know that that's true yet!
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.862]  That's why we're doing the investigation!
[00:14:30.682 --> 00:14:35.206]  And a lot of these states responding, and they're saying, the ones that are complaining about Trump, they're saying,
[00:14:36.523 --> 00:14:39.147]  Oh, how dare they request this information!
[00:14:39.507 --> 00:14:41.330]  How dare they ask us for this information!
[00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.456]  No complaints about the spy grid, no complaints about the CIA Vault 7 access, nothing.
[00:14:46.717 --> 00:14:49.781]  We'll be, uh, actually, here's a report from John Bowne with more on the D.C.
[00:14:49.881 --> 00:14:50.542]  voter information.
[00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:04.964]  White House aide, the fake news complex is collapsing.
[00:15:05.584 --> 00:15:08.825]  Sebastian Gorka lays it all out.
[00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:15.447]  Trump tweeted, I'm extremely pleased to see that CNN has finally been exposed as fake news and garbage journalism.
[00:15:15.887 --> 00:15:16.687]  It's about time.
[00:15:17.047 --> 00:15:21.808]  Maybe fake news isn't the right term, but fraud news or criminal news.
[00:15:23.328 --> 00:15:25.349]  Trump also says, what are they trying to hide?
[00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:29.170]  Trump questioned states refusing to show voter ID.
[00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:32.039]  You know why?
[00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:55.351]  Because Harvard this year has already done a study where they sampled 10,000 people randomly from voter rolls and they found a percentage that if you compared it to the general election and voting rolls it would be 5.7 million illegals that voted not to mention people voting in the names of dead people.
[00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:59.893]  It's a well-known Democratic Party operation for a hundred years or more.
[00:16:01.052 --> 00:16:07.395]  To keep the newspapers, to see who's died, to then go check the voter roll, and then give those names.
[00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:15.740]  Normally about 10 people, 10 dead people, are given to each person that votes illegally, and they go around the different precincts, and that's what they do.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.661]  The average is 10 times.
[00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:21.223]  We have Democrats on video in New York and D.C.
[00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:26.666]  and other areas, top-level Democrats, saying, we're organizing the biggest fraud ever, F. Trump.
[00:16:27.193 --> 00:16:28.534]  Oh, like minority neighborhoods?
[00:16:28.574 --> 00:16:30.857]  Like black neighborhoods and Hispanic neighborhoods?
[00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:34.321]  And Chinese, too.
[00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:34.861]  Oh.
[00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:36.503]  Why do they do that?
[00:16:36.523 --> 00:16:38.445]  Just to get, like, more votes for Democrats?
[00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:40.487]  Or... More votes for themselves.
[00:16:40.507 --> 00:16:42.269]  They're all running for office.
[00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:44.151]  Oh, yeah, for, like, their candidates?
[00:16:44.231 --> 00:16:46.333]  For when they're... For the assembly, for whatever.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.440]  They get buses, they move people around.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.961]  And they almost stole the election.
[00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:55.221]  Five states were stolen, they almost stole six others.
[00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:59.962]  Homeland Security under Obama was trying to break into the computers, but the state officials stopped it.
[00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:05.424]  Obama's answer was to say, I signed an executive order federalizing the elections.
[00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:16.546]  And now Trump is trying to defederalize it, but all he said was, hey states, share with me the voter ID rolls, and then we want to index this just with people that are dead.
[00:17:18.007 --> 00:17:22.370]  And people that aren't citizens, we can run it right through the computer, and they said, no way.
[00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:28.455]  20 states that are still Democrat controlled, all of them Democrat, said, no way, Jose.
[00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:31.898]  Now, I thought no illegals voted.
[00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.759]  I thought no dead people voted.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.825]  And now, more and more is coming out, even the Associated Press of Homeland Security trying to break into the computers on election night.
[00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:48.474]  I mean, what do you think's going on when CNN was sampling 36 points in some of their polls against Trump?
[00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:54.157]  They were adding 36 percentage points in and admitting it in their methodology.
[00:17:54.737 --> 00:18:00.439]  Of course Hillary was winning by 67% when you add 30-something percent more on top of it.
[00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:18.920]  Because the real polls, the internal polls, the scientific polls, the big Google data polls, some of which were in the news, others of which I talked to high-level executives and high-level people in Congress and high-level folks in the CIA, Trump was 20 points ahead when he came out of that Republican convention.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.164]  On election day, in an index of internal polls, he was 14 points ahead of Hillary.
[00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:27.505]  14 points!
[00:18:27.645 --> 00:18:29.466]  Remember, I told you all this during the election!
[00:18:30.387 --> 00:18:36.210]  They have thousands of articles lying Alex Jones says Trump's really 15 points ahead, 20 points ahead.
[00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.050]  But what happened on Election Day?
[00:18:39.131 --> 00:18:47.655]  He had such a mega landslide that despite all the fraud and everything he threw, he still won by the Electoral College.
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:05.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:09.394 --> 00:23:13.798]  Well, everything that they have said about President Trump is wrong.
[00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:17.902]  In fact, most of it is actually true if said about themselves.
[00:23:18.242 --> 00:23:27.571]  But I'm going to prove to you that all the allegations, all the things that they said about Trump prior to the election and after the election are fake news.
[00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:29.953]  Let's start with this story from Breitbart.
[00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:39.679]  Obama has had 50% more meetings with foreign leaders than Barack Obama had in the same time span of the beginning of his presidency.
[00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:42.320]  Now, why is this such a big story to me?
[00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:44.401]  Let's recall.
[00:23:44.781 --> 00:23:55.267]  Now, here they have a list of Obama's 19 meetings in the same period of time versus Trump's 28 meetings in the same period of time.
[00:23:56.164 --> 00:24:00.845]  But what were they saying about President Trump during the election?
[00:24:00.885 --> 00:24:04.626]  What were they saying about President Trump after he was elected?
[00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:06.467]  He's an isolationist!
[00:24:06.907 --> 00:24:08.047]  He's an introvert!
[00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:10.708]  He's gonna cut relations off to the rest of the world!
[00:24:10.968 --> 00:24:13.049]  He's gonna cut relations with all of these countries!
[00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:14.729]  He's not gonna speak to these countries!
[00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:15.950]  Oh, but wait!
[00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:22.471]  He actually did speak to countries, and he spoke to more countries than Barack Obama did.
[00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:23.212]  50% more, even.
[00:24:24.761 --> 00:24:26.241]  So, what were they saying though?
[00:24:26.401 --> 00:24:28.562]  Washington Post, February 17th.
[00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:32.523]  Trump is worse than an isolationist.
[00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:34.843]  Don't just call Trump an isolationist.
[00:24:35.104 --> 00:24:36.424]  We've been calling him that for months.
[00:24:36.864 --> 00:24:37.904]  He's worse!
[00:24:38.384 --> 00:24:40.905]  What Trump really believes is far more dangerous.
[00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.405]  That's the Washington Post!
[00:24:44.006 --> 00:24:45.426]  The Washington Compost.
[00:24:45.506 --> 00:24:47.647]  Again, telling you Trump is an isolationist.
[00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.147]  He's the exact opposite.
[00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:50.727]  How about the National Review?
[00:24:51.188 --> 00:24:52.808]  Trump's foreign policy revolution.
[00:24:56.744 --> 00:24:59.145]  He is a new American isolationist.
[00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:00.806]  That's what they're calling him.
[00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:05.007]  An American isolationist from Charles Krauthammer.
[00:25:06.648 --> 00:25:08.909]  Again, clearly wrong.
[00:25:09.189 --> 00:25:11.070]  Clearly not an isolationist.
[00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.211]  He's doing business with countries.
[00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:14.592]  He's opening the doors for fair trade.
[00:25:15.192 --> 00:25:16.632]  How about the Washington Times?
[00:25:17.053 --> 00:25:20.934]  Republican rivals take aim at Donald Trump's isolationist foreign policy.
[00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:22.535]  Even the Republicans!
[00:25:24.258 --> 00:25:29.282]  Even the establishment GOP was trying to label him an isolationist.
[00:25:29.743 --> 00:25:30.623]  This was October 2015.
[00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:35.207]  How about The Week?
[00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:39.210]  The radical isolationism of Donald Trump.
[00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:42.293]  From November 5th, 2015.
[00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:44.915]  So again, here's all of these news stories.
[00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:46.116]  How about The National?
[00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:48.306]  This is a recent one.
[00:25:48.907 --> 00:25:51.348]  Even still they're saying he's an isolationist.
[00:25:51.788 --> 00:25:54.789]  America's foreign policy and the introvert impulse.
[00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.050]  Introvert?
[00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.951]  Trump is clearly an extrovert.
[00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:01.752]  Even CNN, you can't count CNN out.
[00:26:02.132 --> 00:26:05.374]  Trump would break sharply with US foreign policy tradition.
[00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:07.160]  I don't know.
[00:26:24.534 --> 00:26:26.857]  Is actually having more conversations with world leaders.
[00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:30.261]  He's an extrovert and he's anything but an isolationist.
[00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:34.827]  And now we have more world leaders opening their doors to do business with us.
[00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:38.191]  And Trump is opening our doors for them to come do business here.
[00:26:39.113 --> 00:26:40.835]  So they tell you Trump's an isolationist.
[00:26:41.135 --> 00:26:41.796]  What's the facts?
[00:26:42.397 --> 00:26:43.398]  He's the exact opposite.
[00:26:43.719 --> 00:26:45.401]  What else did they tell you about President Trump?
[00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:48.384]  They said Trump's not going to accept the election results.
[00:26:48.644 --> 00:26:51.147]  Trump supporters aren't going to accept their election results.
[00:26:51.628 --> 00:26:53.110]  Well, what's the truth?
[00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.834]  The truth is that it's the Democrats that aren't accepting the results.
[00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:57.795]  It's the truth.
[00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:02.532]  That it was Hillary Clinton that started the resistance pack.
[00:27:02.953 --> 00:27:07.217]  The truth is it was Robert Reich that started the resist campaign.
[00:27:07.537 --> 00:27:12.982]  The truth is it was Linda Sarsour that said we must wage jihad against President Trump.
[00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:15.684]  But here's the stories.
[00:27:15.904 --> 00:27:19.508]  It's CNN saying Trump will not accept their election results.
[00:27:19.828 --> 00:27:24.032]  Politico, Trump still won't commit to accepting the election results.
[00:27:26.032 --> 00:27:29.053]  Hillary Clinton launches the resistance pack!
[00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:32.135]  Robert Reish!
[00:27:32.155 --> 00:27:34.796]  12 ways to resist the Trump presidency!
[00:27:36.657 --> 00:27:37.977]  It's unbelievable.
[00:27:41.499 --> 00:27:46.741]  So again, they tell you one thing, and then the truth is the exact opposite.
[00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:49.402]  This is undeniable, folks.
[00:27:49.642 --> 00:27:53.824]  These are just presentable facts that your own eyes can tell you is the case.
[00:27:54.915 --> 00:27:55.816]  Now it just goes on.
[00:27:56.276 --> 00:27:57.558]  Russia's hacking the election.
[00:27:57.598 --> 00:27:58.879]  Everyone's telling you it's Russia.
[00:27:59.259 --> 00:28:00.440]  Russia's hacking the election.
[00:28:00.861 --> 00:28:01.942]  Oh, Russia's doing this.
[00:28:01.962 --> 00:28:03.103]  They don't know what to do.
[00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:08.008]  Oh, but it comes out it was the DHS that was hacking, wasn't it?
[00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:16.630]  And then of course today, Trump meets with Putin, and Putin says, believe me, we have nothing to do with it, we have nothing to gain with it, because why are they blaming Russia?
[00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.890]  Why are they saying this about Russia?
[00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.932]  Because it was Hillary Clinton that had Russia ties.
[00:28:20.172 --> 00:28:21.953]  It was John Podesta that had Russia ties.
[00:28:22.293 --> 00:28:36.802]  And it turned out that Maria Bartiromo's interview with John Podesta is going to go down in history, because she called him out on his Russia ties, he tried to deny it, he doubled down, it comes out, he was actually wrong, and Maria Bartiromo was actually right.
[00:28:38.407 --> 00:28:43.408]  But let's go even recall when they said that Trump was causing violence.
[00:28:43.908 --> 00:28:45.769]  Trump supporters are violent people.
[00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:48.230]  Trump supporters are out encouraging violence.
[00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.430]  Trump is encouraging violence.
[00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.130]  Why is this all this violence?
[00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.031]  It's all Trump's fault.
[00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:54.231]  The Atlantic editor.
[00:28:54.531 --> 00:28:57.172]  Trump is going to cause violence against journalists.
[00:28:59.353 --> 00:29:01.353]  It's, I mean, NBC News.
[00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:04.314]  Here's what Donald Trump supporters think of the rally violence.
[00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:09.031]  They're trying to equate Donald Trump with causing violence.
[00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:14.275]  How about the New York Times putting out this video, Trump's history of encouraging violence.
[00:29:16.076 --> 00:29:20.979]  Los Angeles Times, Donald Trump has a history of endorsing violence against protesters.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.022]  Okay, but then what happens?
[00:29:25.022 --> 00:29:27.984]  Trump supporters get drug out of their car and beaten in the street.
[00:29:28.425 --> 00:29:30.166]  Trump supporters get hit with bike locks.
[00:29:30.466 --> 00:29:34.089]  Trump supporters get jumped and cold clocked and cheap shotted in the streets.
[00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:40.756]  But that's just one example that has been so far a minor thing.
[00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:48.819]  The Trump protesters, by the way, in Berkeley, Antifa protesters going out being violent, burning things down, looting, smashing windows, smashing cars.
[00:29:49.699 --> 00:29:51.920]  But it's Trump supporters that are going to be violent.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:59.882]  But let's recall, Steve Scalise gets shot at a baseball field, a Republican baseball practice.
[00:30:00.402 --> 00:30:02.262]  Four others got shot as well.
[00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.063]  They could have easily wound up dead.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:18.691]  And then a protester gets arrested at Senator Flake's office in Arizona, and when asked how liberals are going to solve the Republican problem, the protester said they're going to get better aim.
[00:30:19.392 --> 00:30:22.955]  So they told you all the things about Trump, and they were all completely untrue.
[00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:24.456]  Now I want to go to this interview.
[00:30:24.757 --> 00:30:31.262]  This goes back to the voter information requested from the Trump Integrity Commission.
[00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:33.324]  Listen to this interview with John Ashcroft.
[00:30:34.738 --> 00:30:37.381]  Jay Ashcroft, excuse me.
[00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:40.884]  This is McGraw-Milhaven on 550 KTRS in St.
[00:30:40.904 --> 00:30:41.845]  Louis.
[00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:43.407]  No, not at all.
[00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:53.296]  This is the exact same information that the Secretary of State's office, well, under my predecessor gave out 380 times, and under his predecessor gave out over 600 times.
[00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:59.202]  The Missouri Sunshine Act states that we're required to disclose that information to anyone that requests it.
[00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:06.978]  So even if you didn't want to give out this information to the federal government, you are forced to by statute?
[00:31:07.979 --> 00:31:09.320]  Yes, I'm required to.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:17.128]  The Sunshine Act is meant to be a tool to make sure that the government is transparent and that the citizens can know what's going on.
[00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:22.414]  Would you be so inclined to give this information if the Obama administration asked for it?
[00:31:23.174 --> 00:31:23.615]  Of course.
[00:31:23.635 --> 00:31:30.662]  The last thing I can do is choose who I'm going to serve in office by their political beliefs.
[00:31:31.275 --> 00:31:33.376]  I have to treat everyone equally under the law.
[00:31:33.816 --> 00:31:36.138]  You are in charge of our elections.
[00:31:36.918 --> 00:31:45.783]  And each, as I understand it, the presidential elections are not one national election, it's 50 individual state elections.
[00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:48.304]  And you're in charge of those elections.
[00:31:48.484 --> 00:32:00.170]  If it could be deemed that there might be some voter irregularities or something, why don't you take it upon yourself to do the job that the federal government's doing?
[00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.091]  Well, we give this data to anyone.
[00:32:02.452 --> 00:32:03.232]  It's a request.
[00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:04.433]  It was not a mandate.
[00:32:04.573 --> 00:32:08.716]  We are not required, other than our own state law, to give this data.
[00:32:09.037 --> 00:32:21.826]  And what's going to happen in this, we're having a bipartisan commission that's looking at what happens in our election, that's looking to see whether fraud occurs, that's looking to see how it occurs, and what are the best ways to fight it or to make it more difficult to cheat.
[00:32:22.126 --> 00:32:25.429]  I mean, it's going to be left up to the states to make decisions.
[00:32:25.982 --> 00:32:29.664]  If they want to change their processes and how so, they believe they should.
[00:32:29.744 --> 00:32:35.046]  This is a state-run, our elections are run by states, they should be run by states.
[00:32:35.446 --> 00:32:40.848]  All this is is the federal government assisting states in doing what the state feels best.
[00:32:40.928 --> 00:32:42.249]  And that's exactly what we should have.
[00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:47.311]  We actually should have our state and federal government working together for far so long.
[00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:48.051]  We haven't had that.
[00:32:48.393 --> 00:32:49.995]  Yeah, they didn't get that under Obama.
[00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:51.578]  Trump's willing to work with the states' rights.
[00:32:51.818 --> 00:32:58.608]  But before they tell you that Trump is breaking the law with this Voter Integrity Committee, before they lie about that, check the facts.
[00:32:58.868 --> 00:33:01.452]  Most of that information is already available to the public anyway.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:54.728]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.008 --> 00:36:59.709]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:11.313]  Today there have been some new developments in the case of Charlie Gard.
[00:37:11.353 --> 00:37:14.194]  That's the 11 month old baby with a very rare disease in the UK.
[00:37:15.063 --> 00:37:29.067]  There's a lot that we can all learn both in the UK as well in the United States in terms of legal and ethical medical issues as we're looking at how we're going to control health care and how we are currently being controlled.
[00:37:29.087 --> 00:37:31.447]  That's the most important thing that we look at.
[00:37:31.467 --> 00:37:33.108]  So we're going to talk about the new information.
[00:37:33.608 --> 00:37:37.889]  We're going to talk about how both sides are now making their case.
[00:37:38.129 --> 00:37:41.550]  And this really comes down to not only who owns the children,
[00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.451]  But who owns you, even if you don't have children?
[00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:50.173]  Who's going to make the decisions about your life, whether you live or die?
[00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:58.856]  Will it be some panel of disinterested experts, or will it be the people who know you and care for you, who want to give you every opportunity?
[00:37:58.896 --> 00:38:03.137]  Will you be free, or will you be the slave that exists at their mercy?
[00:38:03.419 --> 00:38:04.320]  We're good to go.
[00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:21.817]  That people were offering for free.
[00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:23.338]  It wasn't an issue of money.
[00:38:23.398 --> 00:38:27.041]  If they wanted to get him off of their life support system, they could send him to the United States.
[00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:31.064]  There are people who are willing to give him experimental treatment, but they said, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:33.726]  The European court said, no, we're not going to let that happen.
[00:38:34.046 --> 00:38:37.529]  We're going to do what is in his best interest and let him die.
[00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:43.333]  And not only that, but they chose, they were going to choose the time and the manner of his death, the place of his death.
[00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:45.035]  His parents wanted to take him to
[00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:46.275]  I think so.
[00:39:15.524 --> 00:39:22.588]  And now we find out, this is from the New York Times, London Hospital reconsiders its decision to turn off a sick baby's life support.
[00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:29.932]  They say the London Hospital said today that it would reconsider this decision in light of fresh evidence about potential treatment.
[00:39:30.532 --> 00:39:34.634]  The hospital had won a series of court rulings last week authorizing them to withdraw life support.
[00:39:34.954 --> 00:39:36.655]  However, they have now changed course.
[00:39:36.675 --> 00:39:47.279]  They said two international hospitals and their researchers have communicated to us as late as the last 24 hours that they have fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment.
[00:39:48.206 --> 00:39:52.130]  And we believe in common with Charlie's parents, it is right to explore this evidence.
[00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.191]  Let's make this clear, folks.
[00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:56.113]  This was there for a long time.
[00:39:56.173 --> 00:39:57.475]  This was on the table for a long time.
[00:39:57.555 --> 00:40:04.621]  It is the public opinion pressure that not only delayed them killing this baby a week ago, but is now
[00:40:05.362 --> 00:40:07.903]  Pressuring them to look at experimental treatment.
[00:40:08.384 --> 00:40:12.626]  They said, well, we have not changed our view that it would be futile and would prolong Charlie's suffering.
[00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:18.689]  Nevertheless, the hospital said it would ask the high court to look at the case again in light of claimed new evidence.
[00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:25.152]  They said this is not an issue about money or resources, but absolutely about what is right for Charlie and they will decide what that is.
[00:40:25.252 --> 00:40:27.253]  No, it is actually about money.
[00:40:27.473 --> 00:40:30.555]  It is about them wanting to get him off of their life support.
[00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.776]  But there are other issues that don't have anything to do with money.
[00:40:34.796 --> 00:40:38.997]  We're going to talk about our own FDA because now it comes into the equation.
[00:40:39.577 --> 00:40:46.118]  Because the hospital that is in the US, they say that they won't let you know which one it is.
[00:40:46.138 --> 00:40:48.799]  They don't want to identify the two institutions.
[00:40:48.839 --> 00:40:53.820]  But they believe that it is New York Presbyterian Hospital slash Columbia University Medical Center.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:41:04.210]  They said that the hospital has offered to treat the child either sending the experimental drug to London to let them do it there or to treat him as an inpatient if they can transfer him.
[00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:11.658]  But they have to get permission from the FDA, the Federal Drug Administration here in the United States.
[00:41:12.459 --> 00:41:14.982]  See, that's one of the key issues for you to think about.
[00:41:16.138 --> 00:41:16.798]  Who owns you?
[00:41:17.459 --> 00:41:37.594]  If the FDA can and does tell terminally ill patients that they can't get treatment, experimental treatment, I mean we're talking about terminally ill patients who are going to die anyway, if they're willing to try a drug, what business is it of the American government, of the FDA, who is in bed with these pharmaceutical companies to deny that to them?
[00:41:38.194 --> 00:41:41.777]  To deny natural treatment that we know is very effective, like medical marijuana.
[00:41:41.817 --> 00:41:42.878]  No, they do both of those things.
[00:41:43.198 --> 00:41:49.563]  And if they can deny that medical treatment to you, then they can also force medical treatment upon you.
[00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:50.664]  Because you belong to them.
[00:41:51.205 --> 00:41:52.906]  So they can vaccinate you if they wish.
[00:41:53.246 --> 00:41:54.868]  They can make you take other types of treatments.
[00:41:55.228 --> 00:42:00.452]  If you do not own yourself, if you do not own your children, you're nothing but their slave.
[00:42:00.472 --> 00:42:01.954]  And so that's the central issue.
[00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:06.067]  They said the central issue is who owns the child.
[00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:24.156]  And we had a medical ethicist at Columbia University, Kenneth Prager, who said, unless the parents are abusive, I think it is dangerous for society to arrogate to itself the power to override parental wishes and to have the child die when they are clearly loving parents willing to expend time and resources to help their child.
[00:42:24.496 --> 00:42:25.737]  And the mother of Charlie,
[00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:28.699]  Said, euthanasia is illegal.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.081]  Suicide is illegal.
[00:42:31.601 --> 00:42:33.523]  So how is what you're doing to my child legal?
[00:42:34.223 --> 00:42:34.724]  It's not.
[00:42:35.244 --> 00:42:35.865]  It's not legal.
[00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:36.985]  It is not ethical.
[00:42:37.126 --> 00:42:38.667]  And it makes slaves out of all of us.
[00:42:39.027 --> 00:42:43.230]  And it is not just their single-payer government-run health care system.
[00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:51.217]  It is also our FDA, our DEA, that denies treatment to terminally ill people here who tells us what we can and cannot put into our body.
[00:42:51.757 --> 00:42:53.279]  And then along the lines of
[00:42:53.899 --> 00:42:57.360]  Let's play this clip of Melissa Harris Perry telling us that your children do not belong to you.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.440]  That's their approach to this.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.040]  Remember this clip?
[00:43:14.016 --> 00:43:20.478]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children.
[00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:23.839]  Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:27.420]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[00:43:27.661 --> 00:43:35.563]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:40.965]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:43:41.513 --> 00:43:43.094]  Well see, that's the danger right there.
[00:43:43.134 --> 00:43:47.358]  She's talking about education and making investments in our kids' education because they all belong to us.
[00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:52.301]  But understand that this extends to every issue of your child's life.
[00:43:52.862 --> 00:43:54.883]  They don't want you to be able to educate your children at home.
[00:43:54.903 --> 00:43:55.284]  No, no, no.
[00:43:55.304 --> 00:43:56.405]  They're not going to let you do that.
[00:43:56.965 --> 00:43:59.707]  And so when we look at this and we look at how this breaks down, it's a...
[00:44:00.908 --> 00:44:02.050]  It takes a village.
[00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:09.341]  Hillary Clinton's, the Melissa Harris Perry's and the people in England and I would include in that Theresa May because she is jumping in on that side.
[00:44:09.382 --> 00:44:10.363]  People like Boris Johnson.
[00:44:10.383 --> 00:44:11.905]  On the other side we have Donald Trump.
[00:44:12.246 --> 00:44:15.471]  We have Nigel Farage saying it's the parents who should decide.
[00:44:16.072 --> 00:44:20.515]  Because you know if you don't have any parental rights, eventually you're not going to have any individual rights as well.
[00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:29.640]  And this turns this whole idea that they will decide what you can do with your life, turns the entire idea of the 9th and 10th Amendment upside down.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.403]  To say that everything is prohibited unless the government expressly permits it.
[00:44:35.003 --> 00:44:37.945]  That is exactly the opposite of what we have with liberty.
[00:44:37.985 --> 00:44:38.506]  It's tyranny.
[00:44:39.046 --> 00:44:43.910]  Now, I want you to take a look at this Guardian article that was written by somebody named Gabby Hensliff.
[00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.952]  And she continues along this line of Melissa Harris Perry.
[00:44:47.012 --> 00:44:54.418]  Again, as I said, the idea that you don't own yourself, that you don't own your children, this goes to these life or death issues.
[00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:58.801]  And she begins her article by saying, you know, society cannot shun its experts.
[00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:01.123]  They need to be able to tell us what to do and what not to do.
[00:45:01.523 --> 00:45:03.245]  She said, your children are not your children.
[00:45:03.965 --> 00:45:05.646]  They come from you, but not from you.
[00:45:05.746 --> 00:45:08.628]  And though they are with you, they belong not to you.
[00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:11.970]  Reading from the lines of Kahlil Gibran, the poet.
[00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.470]  Well, you know what?
[00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:17.553]  Our ethics, our law, does not come from Kahlil Gibran.
[00:45:17.593 --> 00:45:19.754]  It comes from our Christian ethics.
[00:45:19.874 --> 00:45:20.955]  That's what it's based upon.
[00:45:21.615 --> 00:45:23.076]  And it's based upon the idea of liberty.
[00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:24.817]  Not that we belong to somebody else.
[00:45:25.477 --> 00:45:28.499]  And that everybody, therefore, really has no control over themselves.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.141]  And she goes on to say that parents
[00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:39.341]  ...are clinging to the belief that an unproven treatment available in America might somehow work miracles, even when his doctors conclude otherwise.
[00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:42.243]  Well, there are some other doctors on the other side of this as well.
[00:45:42.743 --> 00:45:45.326]  So, whose experts are you going to believe?
[00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:50.069]  Scientific consensus is a fallacy, and usually the consensus is wrong.
[00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:55.254]  She says, if all else were equal, the compassionate thing surely would be to let them try it, but we're not going to do that.
[00:45:55.594 --> 00:45:58.837]  This is a woman who has no compassion, because this is not her child.
[00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:05.182]  The woman whose child it is says, I want you to understand that Charlie is not in pain and suffering.
[00:46:05.222 --> 00:46:11.568]  That was the idea that was put out there by the courts to try to excuse the idea that they were going to kill him.
[00:46:11.848 --> 00:46:13.290]  She said, we are not bad parents.
[00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:15.271]  We are there for him all the time.
[00:46:15.832 --> 00:46:20.897]  I promise everyone I would not sit there and watch my son in pain and suffering.
[00:46:20.997 --> 00:46:21.898]  I could not do it.
[00:46:22.438 --> 00:46:25.361]  She said it gives us hope, definitely, because there was no hope left.
[00:46:25.401 --> 00:46:26.642]  Charlie was going to die on Friday.
[00:46:26.662 --> 00:46:27.423]  You saw the video.
[00:46:27.483 --> 00:46:27.843]  We did.
[00:46:28.163 --> 00:46:29.464]  We were absolutely devastated.
[00:46:29.504 --> 00:46:32.447]  We had no control over it, over the way that it was going to be done.
[00:46:32.607 --> 00:46:34.008]  And then it was going to be done on Monday.
[00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:37.351]  But instead, I think, the White House got involved over the weekend.
[00:46:37.752 --> 00:46:39.033]  And then things changed.
[00:46:39.193 --> 00:46:40.294]  Yes, they absolutely did.
[00:46:40.354 --> 00:46:45.319]  And this woman has nothing but, this other woman, who doesn't have any children, has nothing but contempt for that.
[00:46:45.819 --> 00:46:46.179]  She says,
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.763]  Well, none of this deters Donald Trump from wading in where angels fear to tread.
[00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:53.425]  No, our government is not, they're not angels.
[00:46:53.585 --> 00:47:00.171]  Men are not angels and that's why we need government and we need to control them and we need to set up our individual liberty and rights.
[00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:01.231]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.513]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:59.082]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:15.127]  Well, here we are witnessing the collapse of CNN as their ratings continue to plummet and take a dive into the trash bin.
[00:49:15.727 --> 00:49:19.008]  CNN's ratings have continued to just go down and down and down.
[00:49:19.469 --> 00:49:25.751]  Even Yogi Bear, old reruns of Yogi Bear, is getting higher ratings than CNN.
[00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:27.311]  It's getting pretty out of hand.
[00:49:27.351 --> 00:49:31.873]  But can you, you know, can you even question as to why their ratings are going down?
[00:49:32.313 --> 00:49:32.894]  We're good to go.
[00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.132]  And we now know it wasn't 17 agencies unanimous.
[00:49:56.192 --> 00:50:00.235]  It was three Democrats from three agencies that they strung together to do this.
[00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:01.095]  Here's another one.
[00:50:01.195 --> 00:50:06.318]  CNN plummets to one star rating on App Store after threatening Reddit user.
[00:50:06.359 --> 00:50:07.699]  People are sick of bullies.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.463]  The American system has always been about
[00:50:13.263 --> 00:50:18.304]  The little guy and honoring the average people and believing in the grassroots.
[00:50:18.745 --> 00:50:20.725]  But under globalism, it's about the elites.
[00:50:20.865 --> 00:50:28.327]  And under Hollywood, Americans kind of lost their Americanism and started loving Queen Elizabeth again and royalty and elites and red carpets.
[00:50:28.527 --> 00:50:35.469]  But we finally, you know, kind of come out of the trance and realize that whatever the establishment is spewing, we shouldn't be buying it.
[00:50:35.709 --> 00:50:37.230]  We're getting back to that Americana.
[00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:38.990]  That's what's so exciting.
[00:50:39.271 --> 00:50:45.593]  Now, earlier today, Mike Cernovich was hosting the fourth hour of the broadcast, and he went over just some of the ratings.
[00:50:45.973 --> 00:50:52.796]  But I want to explain to people, when you look at Paul Watson's numbers on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, every day on average, about 3 million viewers.
[00:50:53.556 --> 00:50:57.759]  We have the same as well, adding all of our talk radio stations and more.
[00:50:58.419 --> 00:51:02.062]  It absolutely dwarfs CNN, but we're not in competition with CNN.
[00:51:02.362 --> 00:51:09.347]  You've got to ask how a multi-billion dollar company spending over a billion dollars a year can't beat organizations that spend only millions a year.
[00:51:09.807 --> 00:51:14.310]  And it's because you've tuned out of them, you don't respect them, you don't believe them.
[00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:18.573]  But if you go to just one of our many YouTube channels, that's close to a billion and a half views.
[00:51:19.153 --> 00:51:20.334]  The evidence is there.
[00:51:20.554 --> 00:51:21.774]  They're already dead.
[00:51:22.275 --> 00:51:23.876]  They've already collapsed.
[00:51:24.216 --> 00:51:25.697]  They already aren't pertinent.
[00:51:26.157 --> 00:51:31.560]  The question is, how long can this day of the dead scenario continue on, Millie?
[00:51:32.318 --> 00:51:44.464]  Well, it'll just continue as long as liberals decide to live in a delusional fantasy world where they refuse to accept the reality that CNN has been caught time and time again perpetuating fake news.
[00:51:44.504 --> 00:51:52.208]  You know, I just recently interviewed people and did a Man on the Street Today, and I went and asked a lot of liberals, and they just could not come to the reality.
[00:51:52.729 --> 00:51:58.432]  Even when the facts, the evidence is there, they say, no, no, no, well, Trump this, Trump that.
[00:51:59.412 --> 00:52:12.923]  Just because you like the fact that Trump, you know, is negatively covered on CNN, doesn't mean that you should not criticize CNN for being caught in fake news scandals, and they don't want to accept that reality at all.
[00:52:12.943 --> 00:52:15.625]  They're living in a delusional fantasy world.
[00:52:15.645 --> 00:52:16.086]  Exactly.
[00:52:16.186 --> 00:52:20.970]  Even after the New York Times abandoned two weeks ago the Seventeen Agency Anonymous hoax,
[00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:26.635]  They're still there saying Trump's caught the giant lie, showing they, and then they go to their pundits.
[00:52:26.915 --> 00:52:28.537]  It's not just Acosta that's wrong and lying.
[00:52:28.817 --> 00:52:29.798]  The pundits all agree.
[00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:39.728]  All thinking they can con you by peer pressure, seeing four or five pundits and then a reporter via satellite from Frankfurt, Germany or whatever, telling you, look, we caught Trump in a lie.
[00:52:39.988 --> 00:52:41.330]  It's like saying, we caught Trump in a lie.
[00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:42.491]  The sun didn't rise this morning.
[00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:44.513]  Don't go outside, you'll see it's not there.
[00:52:44.833 --> 00:52:52.980]  If you go outside and you see it is there, it shows why they're so hated, why they're so loathed, and why they've gone from zero to a negative.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.902]  It's going to be spectacular to watch, quite frankly.
[00:52:55.942 --> 00:53:01.607]  But there still are always going to be those people who want to continue to live in the Matrix world.
[00:53:01.687 --> 00:53:03.189]  The people that want the blue pill.
[00:53:03.729 --> 00:53:04.670]  That's what I was about to say.
[00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:12.996]  That's why they had all these articles about the Polish president's wife didn't want to shake his hand, and Melania didn't want to shake his hand, and nobody wants to be near him, and he's unpopular.
[00:53:13.036 --> 00:53:20.583]  They won't show the millions of people in the streets to see him in Poland or in India or wherever because they want to create the illusion that he's not cool.
[00:53:20.643 --> 00:53:23.605]  So the nerds watching, they're nerds.
[00:53:23.705 --> 00:53:25.046]  They want to be on the in crowd.
[00:53:25.286 --> 00:53:27.268]  Somebody who's cool doesn't want to be on the in crowd.
[00:53:27.488 --> 00:53:28.909]  That's who you know is really uncool.
[00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:31.771]  So, again, and I noticed Trendy's.
[00:53:32.571 --> 00:53:36.734]  When they walk up and I'm in a restaurant, they'll go, boo, nobody likes you, you're not cool.
[00:53:37.074 --> 00:53:38.655]  And I'm like, oh, I'm supposed to cry?
[00:53:38.935 --> 00:53:39.696]  Shame on you!
[00:53:39.796 --> 00:53:40.396]  Shame on you!
[00:53:40.456 --> 00:53:44.319]  Like, I care what some idiot moron follower thinks.
[00:53:45.019 --> 00:53:46.120]  It's hilarious to me.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:55.106]  But in their little world, going, shame, shame, Trump's a loser, shame, shame, that's all they've got is this simulated imagination that they're actually winners.
[00:53:55.366 --> 00:53:57.308]  That's why they want Venezuela or North Korea.
[00:53:57.528 --> 00:54:00.750]  They want misery like they are, so everybody else is a failure.
[00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:12.999]  That's right, they want to agree to this whole conformity, collective mindset to where everybody has to have the same thoughts and if you don't fit in there and you don't conform, well you're the outcast, you need to be shamed and shunned.
[00:54:13.279 --> 00:54:17.923]  And they all subscribe to the mainstream media and they're like, give me the blue pills, I want more!
[00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:19.564]  They would be demanding and screaming.
[00:54:19.824 --> 00:54:20.104]  That's right.
[00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:21.465]  We're the deplorables.
[00:54:21.525 --> 00:54:22.265]  We're the deplorables.
[00:54:22.285 --> 00:54:23.305]  They're the delusionals.
[00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:43.873]  And the people controlling them, the David Brocks, knows they're failing and are falling on their face and only helping us.
[00:54:44.153 --> 00:54:46.434]  But Soros doesn't know, so he keeps pumping money to them.
[00:54:46.795 --> 00:54:49.256]  So what's sick is Soros is actually helping us.
[00:54:49.316 --> 00:54:56.360]  Not that media matters is big, but that it's the talking point that then all the media picks up, which then just sends us what's left of their audience.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.602]  I mean, it is just crazy to watch these giant tottering facades.
[00:55:02.003 --> 00:55:06.565]  We just have to make sure that as they collapse, they don't crush us and drag us into World War III.
[00:55:06.585 --> 00:55:07.686]  But Millie, that is so key.
[00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:09.468]  This is all about peer pressure.
[00:55:09.768 --> 00:55:12.733]  It's all about them still believing they're in the cool club.
[00:55:12.973 --> 00:55:20.625]  But I'm sorry, you go to a Democrat meeting or a liberal meeting, they are the most stunted, mentally retarded, sad, pathetic, desperate...
[00:55:21.499 --> 00:55:22.500]  We're good to go.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:59.367]  That's right, and it's going to continue because the liberals, they want to be told that Trump is failing, so they're going to continue to listen.
[00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:07.356]  And even if there's facts presented to them that it's not true, they don't want to, they're just going to swish that away and say, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't believe that.
[00:56:07.396 --> 00:56:08.918]  And this is what they want to hear.
[00:56:09.338 --> 00:56:15.841]  And they think because we talk to them and care about them as humans and are trying to get them out of their mind control, they think, oh, we're still winning.
[00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:17.062]  They're still trying to convince us.
[00:56:17.102 --> 00:56:18.362]  They still want to be part of our crew.
[00:56:18.502 --> 00:56:19.763]  Haha, you're not in our group!
[00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:21.083]  I mean, it's the craziest thing.
[00:56:21.103 --> 00:56:30.008]  When they had jury selection in my whole family, you know, trial, custody battle, they brought in like, I don't want to say, I was like 60, 70 people.
[00:56:30.048 --> 00:56:31.108]  I forget, it was a big jury panel.
[00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:32.689]  And a few of the people
[00:56:33.902 --> 00:56:41.208]  Came up to me after jury selection who hadn't been picked and in the hallways, went, uh-huh, you're pathetic.
[00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:43.610]  I used to listen to you, but now you're an admitted actor.
[00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.291]  Now you're fake.
[00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:45.372]  Now you're going under.
[00:56:45.412 --> 00:56:46.733]  Now no one likes you.
[00:56:47.878 --> 00:56:48.118]  I think so.
[00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.386]  Like a theater major.
[00:57:07.406 --> 00:57:08.607]  Why are so many liberals into theater?
[00:57:08.847 --> 00:57:10.829]  Because they're not real people.
[00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:21.940]  They're seeking after an identity and they think that by doing a big elaborate theater or staging some more CNN fake news that I'm gonna go cry, you know, under my pillow at night and be real sad.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.220]  No, no.
[00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:24.583]  I, all of these false attacks
[00:57:25.123 --> 00:57:25.583]  I don't know.
[00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:50.074]  You could be a bottle of air.
[00:57:50.474 --> 00:57:53.358]  You would beat them because they're garbage.
[00:57:53.418 --> 00:57:53.978]  They're hated.
[00:57:54.219 --> 00:57:56.281]  We don't want to be on your channels.
[00:57:56.542 --> 00:57:58.624]  We don't want to be awarded by you.
[00:57:58.824 --> 00:58:00.266]  We don't want your red carpets.
[00:58:00.466 --> 00:58:01.688]  We don't want your Hollywood.
[00:58:01.728 --> 00:58:03.290]  We want far away from it.
[00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.671]  It's the American system.
[00:58:04.912 --> 00:58:05.693]  It's being reborn.
[00:58:05.973 --> 00:58:09.514]  That's right, and you know, it's trendy to hate President Trump.
[00:58:09.634 --> 00:58:13.615]  It's trendy to hate InfoWars and to heckle InfoWars when you see them out and about.
[00:58:14.035 --> 00:58:23.637]  It's trendy to hate Alex Jones, and in fact, I think the ticket to Trump winning this last presidential election was the fact that the mainstream media unendorsed him.
[00:58:23.877 --> 00:58:29.118]  Because if the establishment and the mainstream media actually got behind Trump, people wouldn't have wanted to touch him.
[00:58:29.378 --> 00:58:30.259]  It was an indicator.
[00:58:30.379 --> 00:58:32.941]  I looked at the man and I said, well, he wasn't my first choice.
[00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:34.462]  I thought I wanted Rand Paul.
[00:58:34.642 --> 00:58:42.529]  But when I saw the establishment all turn their backs at him and the mainstream media try to sink their teeth in and go after him, I realized this is our guy.
[00:58:42.849 --> 00:58:43.930]  This is our guy.
[00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:48.614]  And if the mainstream media would have actually backed President Trump, he wouldn't have won.
[00:58:48.794 --> 00:58:50.996]  Tom Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:52.597]  Have you spread a link or video today?
[00:58:52.617 --> 00:58:54.399]  Because the globalists hate it!
