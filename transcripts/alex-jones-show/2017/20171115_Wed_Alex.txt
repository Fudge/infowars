[00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:10.816]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:13.418]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.080]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.501]  You want answers?
[00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.443]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:27.668]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:34.482]  We are live.
[00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:36.384]  It is November 15th.
[00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:37.925]  I'm Paul Joseph-Watson.
[00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:40.546]  I'll be filling in for Alex in this first hour.
[00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:42.348]  Ton of news coming up.
[00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:47.011]  Chief Amongst It, the top story right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.673]  And we need to talk about Creepy Uncle Joe.
[00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:57.998]  Once again, headline, ex-Secret Service agent claims Biden engaged in Weinstein-level groping.
[00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.980]  This is coming out of Big League Politics.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.682]  This is their exclusive that came out last night.
[00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:14.366]  And it coincides with something else I saw a couple of days ago, which is still going viral on Twitter, which is this thread created by an activist called Richard Mills.
[00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:23.557]  And it's a compilation of all the unseemly, unsavoury incidents involving Joe Biden and children.
[00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:31.265]  Now let's be clear, there's no evidence of illegal activity here, but we have to talk about this because it's going viral once again on Twitter.
[00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:40.631]  We've got an article, and we're starting to play some examples, this is just one of them, of Joe Biden appearing to touch children, appearing to sniff their hair.
[00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:42.512]  I'm going to go through the list of what he actually does.
[00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:45.514]  Most people don't know the sheer volume
[00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:49.740]  Of shady shenanigans that's going on in these videos.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.421]  You thought it was just a couple of videos?
[00:01:51.461 --> 00:02:05.850]  No, there's literally like 15 in this one thread, all of which are embedded in the article on Infowars.com of Joe Biden posing with children and behaving... I mean, let's be fair to him.
[00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.251]  He really likes children.
[00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:08.151]  Let's just say that.
[00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.693]  He obviously really likes children and enjoys being in their company.
[00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:12.954]  That's all we're going to say right now.
[00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.428]  The article, and you can see some of those videos in it right now.
[00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:21.352]  By the way, save all those videos, because God knows if Twitter's going to delete this thread.
[00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:29.678]  This is the thing, they've got New York Times writers quoting this thread on Twitter that you see we're scrolling through right now for TV viewers.
[00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.016]  Saying, how is Twitter going to handle this?
[00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:46.003]  In fact, there was a woman called Nicole Perlroth, a New York Times writer, who tweeted, quote, in the past 24 hours, a new alt-right fake news meme has emerged of Joe Biden as a predator.
[00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:48.645]  How will at Twitter handle it?
[00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:52.828]  So she's directly calling on Twitter to, quote, handle it.
[00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:54.129]  What do you think that means?
[00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.652]  It's an obvious, not-so-subtle call for censorship.
[00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.814]  And no, this is not an alt-right fake news meme.
[00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:02.836]  This has been out for years.
[00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:07.159]  It's merely getting new attention in light of all these sexual abuse revelations.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.086]  Now, people have come back and responded to that tweet by a New York Times writer, one of whom was Noah Gittel, who is actually a leftist.
[00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:18.148]  He writes for the BBC Atlantic.
[00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:27.172]  And even he acknowledged that this is going to be an issue if Joe Biden runs for president in 2020, which by all indications is going to happen.
[00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:32.456]  He tweeted, quote, RTing, retweeting one more time for two reasons.
[00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:34.138]  One, it's creepy.
[00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:36.660]  He's talking about the list of videos we just showed you.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.024]  Anyone who has ever experienced, witnessed the sexual abuse of children knows this is over the line.
[00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:44.806]  These are his words.
[00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:46.747]  He's a leftist journalist, not mine.
[00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:47.448]  Two,
[00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:49.828]  Dems be strategic.
[00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:56.392]  If Biden is going to run for president in 2020, this creepiness is going to be a big story from the right.
[00:03:56.812 --> 00:04:12.062]  So there you have a left-wing columnist admitting, in response to Nicole Perleroth, whose tweet you see there on screen, she wants it censored, but he's admitting that this is going to be a big narrative for the right if Joe Biden runs for president in 2020.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.542]  And again, it's not an alt-right meme.
[00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:22.005]  This is important in light of the revelations that we see coming out of Congress, and we're going to get onto that in a second.
[00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.487]  But again, this was around before the alt-right was even a term.
[00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:27.808]  Some of these clips are years old.
[00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.929]  Some of them are more recent, and we're going to go through some of them.
[00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.412]  But it dovetails with this story, which is coming out of Big League Politics last night.
[00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:47.732]  An ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that Joe Biden engaged in Weinstein-level sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.
[00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:53.013]  These are revelations we've heard from other people before you tie that in with all these creepy videos.
[00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.314]  We're gonna have to talk about this.
[00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:57.335]  This is extremely chilling.
[00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:57.895]  We'll be back.
[00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.095]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:00.776]  Infowars.com.
[00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:01.316]  Don't go away.
[00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:10.747]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:23.198]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:25.020]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.103]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:29.123 --> 00:05:39.071]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:40.992]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by
[00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:44.116]  Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with a little silver and iodine as well.
[00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:47.019]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:55.989]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.775]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:18.458]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:27.186]  On the Alex Jones Show, we're talking about creepy Uncle Joe Biden.
[00:06:27.626 --> 00:06:38.614]  Because top New York Times writers and other verified liberals on Twitter have come out over the past 24 hours and claimed that this story is an alt-right fake news meme.
[00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:42.917]  Well, I don't know how videos stretching back years can be a meme.
[00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:45.579]  I mean, it's footage, it's clear, it's in your face.
[00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:52.143]  Well others have responded and said no, this is going to be a big issue for the left, for the Democrats, if Joe Biden runs in 2020.
[00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:59.928]  Now let's not forget, in 2015, February, we had a Washington Post article entitled
[00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:04.374]  What are we going to do about creepy Uncle Joe Biden?
[00:07:04.894 --> 00:07:21.066]  And they went through the list, not necessarily these videos, a couple of them they included with the children, but they also went through a list of women, grown women, who've been obviously made to feel uncomfortable by Joe Biden touching them in public, like grabbing their shoulders.
[00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:25.529]  You can see them physically react and try and get away from him in some instances.
[00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.153]  So there's the Washington Post talking about this nearly three years ago.
[00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:33.696]  What are we going to do about creepy Uncle Joe Biden?
[00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:40.721]  So no, you can't claim this is an alt-right meme when there were articles about it in the mainstream media years ago.
[00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:43.403]  He's becoming notorious for this.
[00:07:44.504 --> 00:07:49.928]  And on top of that, we have this huge story last night, which broke last night, of big league politics.
[00:07:50.825 --> 00:08:16.927]  And according to Cassandra Fairbanks, who got the source on this, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Joe Biden would, quote, mess with every single woman or teen during these events in the VP's residence and that a Christmas get-together at the VP's house had to be cancelled because Biden was, and this is a quote, this is his words, because Biden will grope all of our wives and girlfriends behinds.
[00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:19.178]  That's his direct quote.
[00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:29.906]  He also said the service often had to protect female agents from Biden and that Biden was prone to parading around the VP residence late at night with no clothes on.
[00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:35.209]  I mean, stark, naked, Weinstein-level stuff, said the agent.
[00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.750]  Again, that's his quote.
[00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:44.396]  During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent's girlfriend during a photo
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.522]  Prompting the agent to shove Biden and then they almost got into a physical confrontation.
[00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:50.303]  He almost hit him.
[00:08:51.223 --> 00:08:55.686]  That agent was subsequently suspended for a week according to the source.
[00:08:56.746 --> 00:09:08.773]  The article goes on to say men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just so they can get away from Biden according to the agent.
[00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:25.084]  Now these revelations about Biden apparently liking to stroll around naked in the middle of the night were also backed up by best-selling author Ronald Kessler who wrote that Biden was fond of swimming naked and that Secret Service agents found that offensive.
[00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:34.672]  So we've got the backstory, we've got the new revelations from this Secret Service agent which broke last night, which by the way Donald Trump Jr.
[00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:42.374]  Retweeted that thread where you see all these videos of Joe Biden groping on little children.
[00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:43.876]  Let's be honest, that's what it shows.
[00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:45.877]  So this is going to be a big issue.
[00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:46.738]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:09:46.778 --> 00:09:47.659]  is picking up on this.
[00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:49.120]  It's starting to become a narrative.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.444]  You see the left starting to react by trying to dismiss it as an alt-right meme.
[00:09:53.864 --> 00:09:55.225]  It's not an alt-right meme.
[00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:56.907]  Let's go through this article.
[00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:58.048]  Here you see one of the videos.
[00:09:58.068 --> 00:10:01.811]  Let's go right to the top of the InfoWars.com article.
[00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:05.957]  Ex-Secret Service agent claims Biden engaged in Weinstein-level groping.
[00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:23.189]  If you go to that article, then you go down to the first video, you can see, as Richard Mills states, and he's the one with the big viral thread on Twitter, in this clip, former Vice President Biden uses a candid moment to fondle the chest area of a little girl in front of her entire family.
[00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.652]  Her visible discomfort is extremely obvious.
[00:10:27.613 --> 00:10:28.833]  And you see it in the video.
[00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:30.995]  She jerks away from him.
[00:10:32.293 --> 00:10:32.893]  There you see it.
[00:10:32.913 --> 00:10:34.554]  There's a close-up here in a second.
[00:10:34.574 --> 00:10:35.074]  You'll see it.
[00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:36.775]  He, like, reaches down.
[00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:39.816]  There you see the close-up for TV viewers.
[00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:42.038]  She jerks away automatically.
[00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:43.238]  Natural reaction to it.
[00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:47.200]  Go on to the next video that's embedded in that article.
[00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:51.022]  Now, this is the one that most of you have probably seen.
[00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:53.863]  He's leaning down to this 13-year-old girl.
[00:10:54.143 --> 00:10:57.345]  By the way, he's obsessed with asking all these children how old they are.
[00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.885]  That's one of his things he likes to do.
[00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:00.406]  He's whispering something in her ear.
[00:11:01.184 --> 00:11:09.747]  Now, the senator that you see there later came out on CNN when people started asking questions about this a couple of years ago, when the video first came out.
[00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:13.008]  And he said, oh, no, my daughter didn't find it creepy at all.
[00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:16.109]  And it's like, well, are you saying that or is your daughter saying that?
[00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:26.452]  I actually found this girl on Instagram, who's probably around 15, 16 by this point, contacted her, asked her if she found it creepy.
[00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:27.993]  No response so far.
[00:11:28.033 --> 00:11:28.913]  Make of that what you will.
[00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:33.289]  Her father, the Senator, said it wasn't creepy, so I guess we've got to believe him.
[00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:46.255]  You can go down to the third video in this article, which is on Infowars.com, to see Joe Biden's habit of smelling the hair of women, and particularly little girls.
[00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:50.697]  Remember, a lot of these children, he's literally just met them seconds before.
[00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:53.739]  It's not like they're long-term family friends or whatever.
[00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:56.660]  Some of them are in some cases, but some aren't.
[00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.633]  Is this the kind of behavior you would be comfortable in seeing if your child was around somebody for the very first time?
[00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:10.635]  This really hands-on approach, this stroking of the hair, this sniffing of the hair that he seems to do all the time.
[00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:21.620]  And bearing in mind that's just three videos out of this entire article, the whole thread literally has probably about 15 different videos just from what we've picked up so far.
[00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:23.590]  And this is concerning.
[00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:31.317]  This is extremely concerning in light of the revelations that we see, not only out of Hollywood, but also out of Congress now.
[00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:35.481]  And I mean, I'm going to summarize this because we don't have time to play all the videos.
[00:12:36.002 --> 00:12:41.347]  But again, some of these kids he's meeting literally seconds into meeting them, he starts
[00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:49.171]  Like touching on them, smelling their hair, stroking their face in a couple of cases, whispering in their ears.
[00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:52.012]  He always asks their age immediately.
[00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:52.632]  How old are you?
[00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:58.094]  And in a couple of cases, he asked the child how old they are, usually a little girl.
[00:12:58.474 --> 00:13:07.417]  And in one case, before he asked this little girl her age, she was six, by the way, Biden answered for her before she responded.
[00:13:07.437 --> 00:13:08.838]  He said, how old are you, 17?
[00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:11.199]  And it's a six year old girl.
[00:13:12.409 --> 00:13:13.750]  Is that not a little bit bizarre?
[00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.531]  No, I'm sure it's completely normal.
[00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:22.057]  So obviously you've seen, you have been kissing the children, stroking their hair, touching them at length.
[00:13:22.297 --> 00:13:31.984]  We're talking about for, in some cases, 20, 30, 40 seconds on end, even when the child, and in some cases the parent, is clearly uncomfortable with what he's doing.
[00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:40.511]  In other instances, repeatedly, Biden tells teen girls from the age of, not just teens, from the age of six up to about 19,
[00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:44.391]  To not date men until they're 30.
[00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:48.892]  This is something he says over and over again, every time he meets them almost.
[00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:51.173]  Don't date any men until you're 30.
[00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:52.693]  What's going on with that?
[00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.334]  Obviously, they're going to date men before they're 30.
[00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:56.754]  That's a little bit weird.
[00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:01.495]  He repeatedly asks children to stand next to him in all these video clips.
[00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:05.496]  He also tells the brothers of these little girls
[00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:11.542]  And he tells the parents, quote, keep the boys away from their sisters.
[00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.923]  What in God's name is he talking about there?
[00:14:15.203 --> 00:14:22.204]  By talking about six, seven, eight year old boys with six, seven, eight year old sisters as they line up for the photo op.
[00:14:22.684 --> 00:14:27.305]  And Biden is telling the parents, keep the boys away from their sisters.
[00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:28.025]  What?
[00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:33.406]  What on earth is going through his head to be talking like that about children?
[00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:36.296]  That is bizarre.
[00:14:36.316 --> 00:14:36.636]  Come on.
[00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.839]  And we've seen it in other cases with women.
[00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:41.720]  There you see another one.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.040]  He's grabbing her by the shoulders.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.742]  Clearly uncomfortable with it.
[00:14:44.762 --> 00:14:46.923]  And it goes on for like 30 seconds.
[00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:48.884]  This is not his wife.
[00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:50.605]  Why are you touching on women?
[00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:52.246]  Grabbing on their shoulders?
[00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:59.191]  Now again, there's no evidence whatsoever that Joe Biden engaged in any illegal activity whatsoever.
[00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:00.452]  But in this climate,
[00:15:01.272 --> 00:15:05.656]  It's no surprise that people are asking questions about this once again.
[00:15:06.396 --> 00:15:13.162]  And to dismiss it as an alt-right meme clearly shows that they're a little bit panicked over what could come of this.
[00:15:13.742 --> 00:15:16.404]  Because Biden's doing the talk show circuit right now.
[00:15:16.484 --> 00:15:17.926]  He's got a new book out, I think.
[00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:23.190]  He was on Colbert last night, or a couple of nights ago, trashing Trump
[00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:31.735]  Positioning himself as the moral guardian of America by saying that Trump basically ripping apart the civic spirit, the morality of America.
[00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:40.826]  So it clearly looks as if they're positioning Biden, who may even have beaten Trump if he had run instead of Hillary last year, to run in 2020.
[00:15:41.987 --> 00:15:43.469]  So this is going to be an issue.
[00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:45.776]  This is going to be a key issue.
[00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.918]  The left, the Democrats, are starting to panic about it.
[00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:51.959]  But we need to treat it seriously.
[00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:56.121]  We need to ask serious questions about creepy Uncle Joe Biden.
[00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:58.203]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:15:58.263 --> 00:15:59.883]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:00.404 --> 00:16:01.024]  Don't go away.
[00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:06.067]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:13.262]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[00:16:13.962 --> 00:16:15.762]  They fear families living together.
[00:16:15.802 --> 00:16:18.743]  They fear people loving God.
[00:16:18.823 --> 00:16:23.465]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[00:16:24.765 --> 00:16:32.007]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:40.415]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[00:16:41.996 --> 00:16:48.097]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[00:16:48.978 --> 00:17:02.082]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:09.681]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[00:17:10.962 --> 00:17:18.729]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.631]  And so many things will happen.
[00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:23.833]  We are the majority.
[00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:33.488]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:39.654]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:43.548]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:52.571]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:59.634]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[00:18:01.494 --> 00:18:02.395]  So many people write me.
[00:18:03.226 --> 00:18:11.473]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[00:18:12.213 --> 00:18:13.835]  We have to fly our flag.
[00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.271]  We have to wear our colors.
[00:18:16.552 --> 00:18:21.216]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:21.877 --> 00:18:24.739]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:36.210]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:38.473]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:18:39.013 --> 00:18:41.196]  And the lock her up Hillary for prison shirt.
[00:18:41.536 --> 00:18:43.899]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:50.949]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[00:18:51.469 --> 00:18:56.115]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[00:18:56.976 --> 00:19:03.962]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:07.285]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:24.658]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[00:19:25.419 --> 00:19:34.165]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:39.508]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the Info War.
[00:19:39.548 --> 00:19:51.416]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:52.217]  So please,
[00:19:52.657 --> 00:19:58.002]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[00:19:58.382 --> 00:19:59.963]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:20:04.727 --> 00:20:07.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.684 --> 00:20:27.866]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:30.046]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.727 --> 00:20:36.069]  Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones in this first hour of the show.
[00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:42.811]  Before we get back into news, I want to tell you about some of the great specials we have right now, ending soon at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:43.131 --> 00:20:47.553]  Trigger the left like nothing else by simply getting these products.
[00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:52.495]  They really are triggered by the mere act of you buying our products.
[00:20:53.098 --> 00:20:54.318]  You know what that boils down to?
[00:20:54.358 --> 00:21:00.060]  It boils down to the fact that they can target the advertisers of someone like Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.221]  They can't do that with us because everything's in-house.
[00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:09.643]  So to undermine, to sabotage us financially, they have to attack the products themselves.
[00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:11.023]  But it's not working.
[00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:12.923]  When BuzzFeed did it, we sold more.
[00:21:13.724 --> 00:21:17.105]  So that's how you strike back, by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:18.605]  We have free shipping

[00:22:14.504 --> 00:22:15.665]  Other specials include

[00:22:28.204 --> 00:22:35.586]  Again, you can put, instead of buying the, you know, the bathroom packs, which people buy each other at Christmas, why not get it all from us and support this network?
[00:22:35.986 --> 00:22:39.807]  We've also got DNA Force back in stock at 25% off with free shipping.
[00:22:40.507 --> 00:22:41.247]  And Secret 12, 50% off.
[00:22:43.852 --> 00:22:48.614]  Again, with free shipping, it's all available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:22:49.014 --> 00:22:54.696]  And don't forget, Brain Force Plus, personally recommended by me.
[00:22:55.236 --> 00:23:03.178]  I'm going to promote it literally every time I do a show now, because they had a big temper tantrum on Twitter about 10 days ago.
[00:23:03.238 --> 00:23:10.861]  They found a commercial that I'd cut for Brain Force Plus that was six months old, and they basically had
[00:23:12.196 --> 00:23:14.117]  A derangement fit over it.
[00:23:14.137 --> 00:23:17.040]  They had a mass meltdown because it was like, oh my God, what's he?
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.523]  He's promoting a nootropic that literally half of Silicon Valley takes.
[00:23:22.463 --> 00:23:23.804]  You know, Joe Rogan does it.
[00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:25.726]  He's got his own blend of nootropic.
[00:23:26.306 --> 00:23:27.367]  That's perfectly fine.
[00:23:27.567 --> 00:23:31.129]  He's built his entire podcast on that because it's popular and people like it.
[00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.810]  It helps them out.
[00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.871]  Gives you clear cognitive functioning.
[00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:37.514]  Now version of it is Brain Force Plus.
[00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:40.636]  Look at all those verified reviews, independent, 92%
[00:23:42.501 --> 00:23:45.522]  Top independent verified reviews.
[00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:46.342]  An average of 4.6.
[00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:48.262]  That is massive.
[00:23:48.342 --> 00:23:54.624]  Out of over 5,600 reviews, almost all of whom are completely satisfied customers.
[00:23:55.144 --> 00:23:58.524]  But oh my god, the horror of even cutting a commercial.
[00:23:58.844 --> 00:24:00.105]  Well, I'm cutting another commercial.
[00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:02.765]  I'm going to cut a commercial for this every time I host the show.
[00:24:03.325 --> 00:24:08.586]  And we're going to sell so much of this thanks to you, the verified liberals on Twitter.
[00:24:08.606 --> 00:24:11.247]  They actually wrote articles about it as if it was news.
[00:24:12.037 --> 00:24:14.799]  Like, I cut a promo for a product six months ago.
[00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:15.379]  Oh my God.
[00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:16.660]  Hold the front page.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.121]  Brainforce Plus.
[00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:21.563]  Get it right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:24:22.644 --> 00:24:27.967]  Now, we got more sexual abuse allegations emerging, this time out of Vice.
[00:24:28.187 --> 00:24:29.408]  Well, isn't that interesting?
[00:24:29.488 --> 00:24:34.211]  Vice, the same publication that lectures men endlessly about toxic masculinity.
[00:24:35.063 --> 00:24:39.005]  It now emerges employees detail a culture of sexual harassment at Vice.
[00:24:39.446 --> 00:24:41.087]  This is out of Axios.com.
[00:24:41.507 --> 00:24:52.994]  More than a dozen current and former employees at Vice News recounted a culture of sexism and sexual harassment, plus a human resources department that was unresponsive to employee complaints to the Daily Beast.
[00:24:53.974 --> 00:24:58.557]  Quote, we have immediately begun reviewing this matter, Vice told the Daily Beast via a statement.
[00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:09.716]  So they've got a huge sexual harassment problem in the offices of Vice, and yet they're the ones who on a daily basis come out and, of course, boost third-wave feminism.
[00:25:09.736 --> 00:25:12.397]  And isn't it sweetly ironic?
[00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:21.921]  Every single time the biggest virtue-signallers, the biggest male feminists, have turned out to also be sexual abusers of women.
[00:25:22.261 --> 00:25:26.563]  And now that is ensnaring the offices of Vice Media.
[00:25:27.404 --> 00:25:29.106]  Such, such a sweet irony.
[00:25:29.546 --> 00:25:30.807]  We've also got this story.
[00:25:31.288 --> 00:25:36.052]  Spire US House paid $15 million to its secret sexual harassment victims.
[00:25:36.473 --> 00:25:40.056]  Let's go to this clip first and then we'll get into the article.
[00:25:40.096 --> 00:25:46.662]  This is a clip about this story about these secret payments that are going from Congress to sexual harassment victims.
[00:25:46.682 --> 00:25:47.262]  Here's the clip.
[00:25:52.848 --> 00:25:53.168]  Facts.
[00:25:57.916 --> 00:26:05.881]  Yeah, we've got problems with audio with that, so I'm just going to read the article out of Breitbart.
[00:26:07.562 --> 00:26:14.386]  Representative Jackie Speier, who is a Democrat out of California, told MSNBC's Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S.
[00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:22.491]  House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.
[00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:31.029]  She said, quote, we do know that there is about $15 million that's been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last 10 to 15 years.
[00:26:31.049 --> 00:26:32.772]  This has been kept completely secret.
[00:26:34.297 --> 00:26:37.299]  $15 million has been paid out over sexual harassment claims.
[00:26:37.699 --> 00:26:41.261]  So obviously, she said, more than one member of Congress.
[00:26:41.281 --> 00:26:42.902]  That was actually Chuck Todd's response.
[00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:45.243]  So even he's entertaining it now.
[00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:46.624]  Press for details.
[00:26:46.644 --> 00:26:49.586]  Spire said she did not know how many members of Congress were involved.
[00:26:49.606 --> 00:26:53.708]  She also explained that victims had signed non-disclosure agreements.
[00:26:54.446 --> 00:27:05.912]  Now, this was after she testified earlier in the day at the Committee on House Administration that there were two current members of Congress, one Republican and one Democrat, who were guilty of sexual harassment.
[00:27:05.952 --> 00:27:07.973]  She did not divulge names.
[00:27:08.814 --> 00:27:13.456]  CNN report shows that harassment was widespread on Capitol Hill and in the surrounding office buildings.
[00:27:14.077 --> 00:27:14.677]  Now, the problem is,
[00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.608]  The nature of that harassment, obviously we have a huge problem with this.
[00:27:19.008 --> 00:27:30.611]  It's the very nature of politics in the entertainment industry that a lot of men who get into positions of power think that they can abuse their power by just basically having any woman they desire.
[00:27:31.052 --> 00:27:35.693]  On the flip side, there are some women, again not all, some men who abuse their power, some women
[00:27:36.474 --> 00:27:44.996]  That abuse their looks to manipulate men into, you know, getting favors from them by flirting with them, by using their charms, by throwing themselves at men.
[00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:45.936]  It happens.
[00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:46.616]  It's a fact.
[00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:48.677]  So there's fault on both sides.
[00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:52.757]  Obviously, the majority of sexual harassment is coming from men.
[00:27:52.817 --> 00:27:59.159]  But again, feminists, as I've described in my recent video, have hijacked that, used it as a narrative to demonize all men.
[00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:01.799]  But of course, we've got a big problem here.
[00:28:02.239 --> 00:28:04.740]  And now we've got this Democratic representative
[00:28:05.445 --> 00:28:14.907]  Saying there are two, I presume, prominent members of Congress on Capitol Hill who are, by the sounds of it, serial sexual harassers of women.
[00:28:15.207 --> 00:28:20.948]  We've got $15 million in secret payments going to the victims of this.
[00:28:20.988 --> 00:28:24.489]  They're having to sign non-disclosure agreements so they don't talk about it.
[00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:29.930]  This has only just begun to explode, this entire sexual abuse scandal.
[00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.970]  It's percolated down from Hollywood.
[00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:34.412]  Now it's getting political.
[00:28:34.452 --> 00:28:38.896]  We've had the whole Pest-Minster scandal over in London and the fallout from that.
[00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:42.738]  Now there are two members of Congress who are deeply involved in it.
[00:28:43.018 --> 00:28:46.881]  Their identities are, for the time being, being kept secret.
[00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:48.222]  We'll be back on the other side.
[00:28:48.362 --> 00:28:49.343]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:50.764]  Frankynewsinfowars.com.
[00:28:50.864 --> 00:28:51.865]  Don't go away.
[00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:02.026]  Hey, Daniel.
[00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:04.588]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[00:29:04.648 --> 00:29:10.855]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:13.958]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:29:14.178 --> 00:29:18.483]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:39.158]  After just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYCTerroristAttack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:42.557]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[00:29:42.637 --> 00:29:44.318]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:54.346]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:29:54.707 --> 00:29:58.650]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[00:30:00.103 --> 00:30:02.005]  This information being weaponized.
[00:30:02.065 --> 00:30:04.307]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:30:04.747 --> 00:30:09.291]  He actually went on Jones' show and said... Your reputation's amazing.
[00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:11.152]  I will not let you down.
[00:30:11.272 --> 00:30:14.155]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:22.121]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:30.787]  Know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[00:30:31.068 --> 00:30:37.495]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:39.998]  You have RT, you have Sputnik.
[00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:47.221]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:30:48.342 --> 00:30:50.883]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.324]  The system self-corrected.
[00:30:52.444 --> 00:30:55.286]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:30:55.306 --> 00:30:57.547]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:30:58.747 --> 00:30:59.528]  But you saw this?
[00:30:59.748 --> 00:31:00.488]  USA Today.
[00:31:00.908 --> 00:31:01.989]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:31:02.169 --> 00:31:04.530]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.731]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:31:05.911 --> 00:31:07.492]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.353]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[00:31:09.373 --> 00:31:16.997]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[00:31:17.017 --> 00:31:22.460]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[00:31:25.602 --> 00:31:29.604]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:31.806]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:35.886]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[00:31:36.807 --> 00:31:48.818]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone, because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[00:31:50.848 --> 00:31:54.931]  Super Blue Colloidal Silver Fluoride Free Mouthwash, 50% off.
[00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:56.692]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, still 50% off.
[00:31:57.012 --> 00:31:59.834]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[00:31:59.854 --> 00:32:01.955]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[00:32:02.535 --> 00:32:03.976]  That's 50% off as well.
[00:32:04.196 --> 00:32:05.717]  Free shipping, it's got to end.
[00:32:06.097 --> 00:32:09.559]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.561]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.
[00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:15.143]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our best seller, that I personally wear
[00:32:15.623 --> 00:32:16.403]  around town now.
[00:32:16.463 --> 00:32:17.724]  It's my favorite shirt of all time.
[00:32:17.884 --> 00:32:24.446]  It says, Won't Thread on Me, InfoWars.com on the right-hand shoulder of the American flag, InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:32:25.126 --> 00:32:28.467]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:40.091]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake, very iconic, with InfoWars.com in Dayglo yellow on the back, and InfoWars.com with the American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[00:32:40.151 --> 00:32:41.132]  We also have InfoWars
[00:32:41.952 --> 00:32:44.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.824 --> 00:33:37.593]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.583 --> 00:33:43.884]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:46.485]  We're going to get straight back into this news.
[00:33:46.585 --> 00:33:52.968]  Chelsea Clinton's been out on Twitter again, making a complete fool out of herself, which is quite a regular occurrence at this point.
[00:33:53.388 --> 00:33:56.009]  Gateway Pundit reports, Donna's a brick.
[00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:58.390]  Chelsea Clinton celebrates new Sharia law.
[00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.531]  Barbie doll gets destroyed on Twitter.
[00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:11.532]  And yet again, we're seeing dominant cultural institutions on the left fetishise the hijab, the Muslim veil, trying to make it out as a symbol of feminism.
[00:34:11.653 --> 00:34:12.153]  It's not.
[00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:13.935]  How many times do I have to tell you?
[00:34:13.955 --> 00:34:15.936]  How many videos I have to make about this?
[00:34:16.537 --> 00:34:24.084]  Describing, explaining the history of it, explaining how women and young girls in the Middle East are brutalised, are oppressed,
[00:34:24.764 --> 00:34:27.266]  Because they don't wear the hijab.
[00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:31.350]  It's not a symbol of feminism, it's a symbol of actual patriarchal oppression.
[00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:45.582]  Staunch feminist, whose family takes millions of dollars from Middle Eastern countries that execute LGBT people, but staunch feminist Chelsea Clinton took to her Twitter account to celebrate the new Sharia-compliant hijab-wearing Barbie doll.
[00:34:46.302 --> 00:34:50.446]  Millions of women are abused and oppressed under Sharia law and Chelsea Clinton thinks it's great.
[00:34:51.644 --> 00:34:58.571]  She tweeted out a People article, you see it there, celebrating the first ever Barbie to wear a hijab in the brand's 58-year history.
[00:34:59.572 --> 00:35:01.333]  Barbie's breaking barriers!
[00:35:01.574 --> 00:35:03.896]  Ibhaj Mohammed was the first ever U.S.
[00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:07.519]  Olympic athlete to compete wearing a hijab at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.624]  Now she has her very own Barbie, the first to ever wear a hijab in the brand's 58-year history.
[00:35:12.684 --> 00:35:15.087]  Now as we explained yesterday on yesterday's show,
[00:35:15.874 --> 00:35:24.262]  This whole idea didn't originate because of this athlete, it originated from feminists going years back who've been calling for this for years.
[00:35:25.643 --> 00:35:35.392]  So Chelsea Clinton tweeted, love this, Barbie made their first hijab-wearing Shiro doll in honour of American fencing star Ibhaj Mohammed.
[00:35:35.852 --> 00:35:37.954]  She tweeted a picture of the doll.
[00:35:39.218 --> 00:35:46.523]  Then Miley Cyrus came out, who's known for breaking down and wailing uncontrollably in videos because she loves Hillary Clinton so much.
[00:35:47.264 --> 00:35:50.606]  Miley Cyrus came out with a tweet, and people were like, why do you care?
[00:35:50.647 --> 00:35:51.907]  It's only Miley Cyrus, OK?
[00:35:52.308 --> 00:35:56.831]  She has millions of impressionable young followers, she said, and you can see the tweet there.
[00:35:56.851 --> 00:35:58.492]  Yay, Barbie!
[00:35:59.213 --> 00:36:00.994]  One step closer to equality.
[00:36:01.334 --> 00:36:03.296]  We have to normalise diversity.
[00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:04.408]  Well, no.
[00:36:04.608 --> 00:36:06.789]  You're not normalising diversity.
[00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:08.089]  I'll tell you what you're normalising.
[00:36:08.129 --> 00:36:22.011]  In fact, rather than me telling you, again, let's read the words of the head of the Muslim Reform Movement when she writes about the hijab and how it enforces a purity culture that brutalises and oppresses women.
[00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:23.792]  That's what you're normalising.
[00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:25.312]  Do you get it yet?
[00:36:26.052 --> 00:36:29.633]  Did you do any cursory research before tweeting out this utter crap?
[00:36:30.193 --> 00:36:31.193]  Miley Cyrus, no.
[00:36:32.322 --> 00:36:35.865]  Azra Q. Nomani, founder of the Muslim Reform Movement.
[00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:41.950]  She pointed out, and this was in my video, questions for burqa wearers, which I made a few months back.
[00:36:42.351 --> 00:36:51.459]  She pointed out just the recent examples of young girls and women being brutalised, sometimes killed, for not wearing the hijab, for letting it slip.
[00:36:51.479 --> 00:36:53.961]  Let's not forget, by the way, they literally have
[00:36:54.764 --> 00:37:04.326]  Burka and hijab police in Indonesia, in Iran, in these other countries that go around looking for women who have let their hijab slip a little bit.
[00:37:04.786 --> 00:37:05.606]  They get punished.
[00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:09.447]  In Iran, they get put in prison for not wearing the hijab.
[00:37:09.687 --> 00:37:17.269]  You have entire protest movements solely based around these women taking off the hijab in Iran.
[00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.512]  That's real feminism, okay?
[00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:28.922]  Why would you want to normalise a system that brutalises and puts women in cages if they don't follow this insane, stringent purity culture?
[00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:30.824]  Why would you want to normalise that?
[00:37:31.064 --> 00:37:32.826]  Miley Cyrus, you complete idiot!
[00:37:33.647 --> 00:37:36.510]  Azra Q. Namani, founder of the Muslim Reform Movement.
[00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:46.430]  Said recently in Bareilly, India, a father killed his daughter, four years old, smashing her head against the floor when her scarf slipped from her head during dinner.
[00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.051]  Do we want to normalise that?
[00:37:48.732 --> 00:37:56.680]  In Ontario, a few years ago, a man strangled his 16-year-old sister when she defied their father, including by refusing to cover her hair.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.722]  Do we want to normalise that?
[00:37:59.346 --> 00:38:08.072]  In November last year, a former University of Missouri instructor dragged a female relative 14 years old out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her hair.
[00:38:08.392 --> 00:38:10.033]  Do we want to normalize that?
[00:38:10.942 --> 00:38:18.847]  Today in Iran, friends of the journalist Masih al-Inajad dodge batons as they shoot photos of themselves hair bare in a campaign.
[00:38:19.227 --> 00:38:27.132]  Al-Inajad started hashtag MyStealthyFreedom to protest Iran's mandatory, mandatory headscarf law.
[00:38:27.712 --> 00:38:34.857]  Okay, do we want to normalise beating up women because they protest on the street by removing their hijab?
[00:38:35.734 --> 00:38:37.056]  Do we want to normalise that?
[00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:39.939]  Miley frigging Cyrus, you complete idiot.
[00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:46.887]  Chelsea Clinton, whose family has took, what, $200 million from Gulf states alone over the past few years.
[00:38:47.427 --> 00:38:50.151]  The same Gulf states that still execute homosexuals.
[00:38:52.173 --> 00:38:53.815]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:38:53.935 --> 00:38:56.538]  The way they just tweet this out on a whim.
[00:38:57.777 --> 00:39:04.581]  As a virtue signalling device to millions and millions of impressionable young people when they know absolutely nothing about it.
[00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:17.568]  Nothing about how the hijab is used as an actual tool of brutality and oppression by an actual toxic masculinity movement called Islam by the patriarchy in the Middle East.
[00:39:18.128 --> 00:39:19.289]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:22.991]  We have to deal with this propaganda over and over again.
[00:39:23.911 --> 00:39:25.532]  I mean, that's part of the frustration, isn't it?
[00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:29.093]  Having to repeat the same talking points over and over again.
[00:39:29.453 --> 00:39:31.334]  The left is adept at that.
[00:39:31.754 --> 00:39:33.355]  They're completely skilled in doing that.
[00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:37.897]  The right isn't because we tend to be a little bit more curious about different things.
[00:39:38.277 --> 00:39:42.419]  We get bored of talking about the same subject over and over again, but we have to do it.
[00:39:43.487 --> 00:39:47.909]  Because this disinformation pours forth out of these Twitter accounts.
[00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.151]  Millions of followers on a daily basis.
[00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:54.053]  And it comes up again and again with the hijab.
[00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:55.854]  No, it's not a symbol of feminism.
[00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:57.254]  It's a symbol of oppression.
[00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.236]  Talk to actual Muslim reformists.
[00:39:59.576 --> 00:40:04.879]  Go and read the history of the first Arab feminist Muslim movement nearly a hundred years ago.
[00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:09.881]  The Egyptian Feminist Union who protested by removing their hijabs.
[00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:10.962]  You dummies!
[00:40:11.302 --> 00:40:12.883]  You don't know anything about history.
[00:40:14.753 --> 00:40:15.293]  Incredible.
[00:40:15.873 --> 00:40:16.394]  Moving on.
[00:40:16.974 --> 00:40:18.634]  Information Liberation reports.
[00:40:19.074 --> 00:40:23.516]  Problematic makeup removing app, Makeapp, causes mass triggering.
[00:40:24.116 --> 00:40:32.399]  So they're not offended about the hijab being a tool of oppression, they're offended about an app that was developed which takes pictures of women
[00:40:33.405 --> 00:40:37.166]  Removes their makeup and produces the result you see right there.
[00:40:37.506 --> 00:40:37.846]  Who's that?
[00:40:37.866 --> 00:40:40.146]  I think that's Anna Kasparian out of the Young Turks.
[00:40:40.706 --> 00:40:42.046]  Is it a little bit cheeky?
[00:40:42.086 --> 00:40:43.247]  Maybe a little bit mean?
[00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:43.767]  Maybe.
[00:40:44.367 --> 00:40:45.327]  Oh, but the triggering.
[00:40:45.787 --> 00:40:50.408]  The triggering was so immense that Business Insider actually wrote an article.
[00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:52.568]  There you see Rachel Maddow not looking so great.
[00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:54.969]  Shock horror.
[00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:57.689]  Women don't look as good without any makeup.
[00:40:57.809 --> 00:40:58.469]  Oh my God.
[00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:00.270]  Like we didn't know that.
[00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.650]  Somebody's just presenting it as a funny app.
[00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:07.938]  Absolute meltdown, of course, because we have to be offended about something new every single frigging day.
[00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:15.924]  And they were so triggered by it, they named the developer of this app, a guy called Ashok Gabrylanov.
[00:41:16.445 --> 00:41:18.987]  They accused him of being a Kremlin agent.
[00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:25.152]  And he said, he came back on Twitter and said he's going to sue the Business Insider for lying about him.
[00:41:25.552 --> 00:41:32.278]  Then one liberal writer at Slate tried to stick it to Gabrylanov by running him through the app.
[00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:34.027]  Which is what they did.
[00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:37.409]  If you scroll to the very bottom of that article, they thought they would get him back.
[00:41:37.449 --> 00:41:43.092]  They were going to get him back, that evil misogynist, by running him through the app so he looks exactly the same.
[00:41:43.112 --> 00:41:45.533]  Because, of course, you know, men don't wear makeup.
[00:41:47.074 --> 00:41:47.975]  Kind of gives it away there.
[00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:51.477]  But again, this is what they're outraged about.
[00:41:51.497 --> 00:41:52.778]  They're not outraged about
[00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.914]  Women and young girls being strangled to death because their hijab slips to the floor.
[00:41:58.174 --> 00:41:59.955]  They're not outraged about honor killings.
[00:42:00.296 --> 00:42:02.858]  They're not outraged about female genital mutilation.
[00:42:02.878 --> 00:42:07.222]  They're not outraged about absolute, actual brutality against women.
[00:42:07.862 --> 00:42:11.005]  They see the Trump family looks a little bit better than Anna Kasparian.
[00:42:11.585 --> 00:42:12.947]  They're not outraged about that.
[00:42:13.187 --> 00:42:18.111]  They're outraged about some stupid app that removes makeup from women.
[00:42:18.931 --> 00:42:22.053]  Like, that's the most evil, misogynistic thing you could ever do.
[00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:27.237]  Meanwhile, women are being stoned to death in the Middle East because someone said they had an affair with someone.
[00:42:27.557 --> 00:42:28.417]  No, we don't care about that.
[00:42:28.437 --> 00:42:34.301]  We don't care about women in Iran being persecuted and thrown in cages because they want to remove their hijabs.
[00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:35.162]  We don't care about that.
[00:42:35.422 --> 00:42:39.745]  We care about this guy who created a stupid app that removes makeup from women.
[00:42:40.165 --> 00:42:47.050]  And we're so triggered, we're going to accuse him of being a Russian agent because everybody who we don't like is a Russian agent.
[00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:48.371]  Incredible.
[00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:50.657]  We'll be back on the other side.
[00:42:50.737 --> 00:42:51.942]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:54.231]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:54.833]  Don't go away.
[00:43:01.892 --> 00:43:06.214]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[00:43:06.675 --> 00:43:11.737]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[00:43:12.278 --> 00:43:16.180]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.542]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[00:43:20.182 --> 00:43:24.644]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[00:43:25.285 --> 00:43:28.546]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[00:43:29.227 --> 00:43:30.768]  I came in here an hour ago.
[00:43:31.528 --> 00:43:38.751]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:42.853]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:46.915]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:48.976]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[00:43:49.436 --> 00:43:55.758]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:43:55.798 --> 00:43:56.699]  Let's go over them right now.
[00:43:57.239 --> 00:43:58.760]  This is Verified Buyer Mark.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.881]  Five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:03.422]  I take it as directed.
[00:44:03.442 --> 00:44:14.327]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[00:44:14.887 --> 00:44:15.567]  Easy does it.
[00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:16.668]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[00:44:16.688 --> 00:44:17.628]  It's very, very serious.
[00:44:18.048 --> 00:44:18.449]  Not a game.
[00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:18.889]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:20.689]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:21.610]  Energy all day.
[00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:29.352]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have drive energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:30.493]  Another review.
[00:44:30.513 --> 00:44:31.513]  I love this one.
[00:44:31.813 --> 00:44:34.254]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[00:44:34.634 --> 00:44:38.155]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[00:44:38.435 --> 00:44:41.356]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[00:44:41.736 --> 00:44:43.277]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:43.657 --> 00:44:47.020]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.482]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:51.242]  I don't get sick.
[00:44:51.923 --> 00:44:55.265]  Last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[00:44:55.405 --> 00:44:56.386]  Amazing product.
[00:44:57.106 --> 00:44:59.207]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[00:44:59.627 --> 00:45:00.628]  Here's one from Brian.
[00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:03.029]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:03.990]  Thank you all.
[00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.032]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[00:45:08.092 --> 00:45:10.313]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[00:45:10.713 --> 00:45:12.654]  Every night owl should have this product.
[00:45:13.154 --> 00:45:16.596]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[00:45:16.856 --> 00:45:17.497]  And I should add,
[00:45:18.297 --> 00:45:19.418]  That's a great name for this product.
[00:45:19.678 --> 00:45:21.519]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[00:45:21.539 --> 00:45:23.240]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:24.922]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[00:45:25.002 --> 00:45:26.603]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:27.203]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:45:27.443 --> 00:45:28.204]  I said I'd shut up!
[00:45:29.124 --> 00:45:29.885]  But back to the script.
[00:45:30.245 --> 00:45:32.106]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:32.887]  I love that name too.
[00:45:33.307 --> 00:45:35.349]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:39.832]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[00:45:39.892 --> 00:45:42.453]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[00:45:42.513 --> 00:45:43.934]  You make it literally possible.
[00:45:44.995 --> 00:45:49.801]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:53.164]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[00:45:53.445 --> 00:45:57.009]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[00:45:57.529 --> 00:45:59.752]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though.
[00:46:00.733 --> 00:46:03.234]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[00:46:03.574 --> 00:46:05.676]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:11.880]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:18.044]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[00:46:18.524 --> 00:46:24.929]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[00:46:25.189 --> 00:46:25.989]  It's all a win-win.
[00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.050]  That's an awesome review.
[00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.872]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[00:46:30.312 --> 00:46:32.373]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[00:46:32.413 --> 00:46:35.393]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Cayman reviews.
[00:46:35.413 --> 00:46:36.593]  They're all five-star.
[00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:42.195]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:46.116]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[00:46:46.416 --> 00:46:48.216]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[00:46:48.516 --> 00:46:52.037]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:52.057 --> 00:46:57.178]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:09.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.714 --> 00:47:17.775]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:47:18.955 --> 00:47:25.037]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:32.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.181]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:41.942]  Before we get into more vital breaking news stories, I want to again direct you back.
[00:47:42.202 --> 00:47:52.526]  Final call for this hour to InfoWarsStore.com, where we have a number of massive discounts and specials running as we approach the Christmas, say it, Christmas.
[00:47:52.566 --> 00:47:54.367]  You can say the word Christmas here, that's okay.
[00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:56.607]  Might offend somebody, but we'll just go with it.
[00:47:57.028 --> 00:47:58.068]  The Christmas season
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:05.445]  We have a lot of great specials and discounts at InfoWarsStore.com Extended free shipping on selected items.

[00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:13.952]  In fact, that special's ended.
[00:48:14.212 --> 00:48:16.914]  So be sure to get back on board with that when the special comes back.
[00:48:16.954 --> 00:48:19.456]  But we have other specials still available.
[00:48:19.557 --> 00:48:22.799]  Biome Defense 50 is still available at 50% off.
[00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:24.340]  It's not going to last long.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.262]  We don't know when it's going to come back in stock.
[00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.438]  So stock up on that right now.
[00:48:28.498 --> 00:48:34.223]  Z-Shield, also the Caveman True Paleo Formula, 50% off again with free shipping.
[00:48:35.103 --> 00:48:40.308]  And all those five-star verified reviews, which you've seen also, the Brain Force Plus.
[00:48:40.388 --> 00:48:43.090]  It's crucial that everybody listening tries at least once.
[00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:51.596]  Brain Force Plus, right there, £29.95, multiple five-star verified reviews.
[00:48:51.636 --> 00:48:55.499]  It's still at 25% off, by the way, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:55.539 --> 00:48:56.180]  It triggers them.
[00:48:56.963 --> 00:49:00.326]  Even more than those mugs and t-shirts with my face on triggered them.
[00:49:00.366 --> 00:49:02.147]  This is like next level triggering.
[00:49:02.927 --> 00:49:05.990]  Buy getting the Brain Force Plus and you support this network.
[00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.311]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:09.332 --> 00:49:18.659]  Now before I get into the Maxine Waters news, which is always entertaining because she's literally losing her marbles, but she's being exalted by the left as their new hero.
[00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:21.663]  Let's talk about this story out of brightbar.com.
[00:49:21.723 --> 00:49:27.267]  Council cracks down on Islamophobia after parents withdraw children from school mosque trips.
[00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:35.152]  Now they're putting a black mark against parents and against students if they withdraw them from visiting mosques.
[00:49:35.232 --> 00:49:39.355]  We saw this back in 2013 with a different headline out of the BBC.
[00:49:39.575 --> 00:49:42.337]  Headteacher apologises over racial discrimination letter.
[00:49:43.078 --> 00:49:53.229]  They were putting racial discrimination notes against a child's educational record if they didn't go on a quote religious trip and it was of course always a trip to a mosque.
[00:49:53.750 --> 00:50:05.082]  Well now a council in Britain is taking action to crack down on Islamophobia, which is not a real thing and doesn't exist, in response to some parents refusing to send their children on mosque visits arranged by schools.
[00:50:06.016 --> 00:50:08.198]  Now, there's been a lot of backlash over this.
[00:50:08.218 --> 00:50:16.745]  We've seen pictures out of the Netherlands, other countries, where they're made to kneel down, in some cases made to recite the conversion prayer to Islam.
[00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:18.687]  Oh, it's just a school trip, don't worry about it.
[00:50:19.568 --> 00:50:33.580]  But now it's emerged that some pupils were being prevented from going on school trips to Mosque by their parents and the local council reacted by producing a document claiming Mosque visits are vital in preparing children for life in diverse Britain.
[00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:36.370]  Again, this is another part of the capitulation.
[00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:42.273]  Not multiculturalism, it's you capitulate to that culture, the stronger culture coming in.
[00:50:42.713 --> 00:50:49.996]  While families have the right to remove their children from school trips, the council said it was a serious matter that pupils have been withdrawn from mosque visits.
[00:50:50.016 --> 00:50:55.659]  Some parents have cited concerns over cost and safety, while others deployed a political agenda behind the activities.
[00:50:56.139 --> 00:51:08.595]  To counter this, they're issuing schools with guidance on how to counter the trend, which includes a template letter to parents claiming that mosque visits play an important role in helping to equip pupils for today's diverse Britain.
[00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.358]  And then they're threatening
[00:51:11.269 --> 00:51:25.456]  Quote, this is what the education body is telling the schools, quote, while objections are raised about visits to a number of places of worship, they are most frequently about visits to mosques, which raises the bigger issue of Islamophobia and how this can be addressed.
[00:51:25.476 --> 00:51:34.381]  So they're basically saying, if you stop your child going on a school trip to a mosque, you're an Islamophobe and maybe you need to be investigated for your thought crimes.
[00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:44.488]  Of course, if Muslim parents withdrew their kids from visits to Christian churches or Christian assemblies, would that be characterised as Christianophobic?
[00:51:44.648 --> 00:51:45.308]  No, it wouldn't.
[00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:46.890]  It would be completely allowed.
[00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.831]  There would be no consequences whatsoever.
[00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:54.095]  But no, you have to bathe your child in this new tolerance and diversity.
[00:51:54.375 --> 00:51:57.437]  You don't get to say, the state controls your activity.
[00:51:57.837 --> 00:52:01.458]  And if you kick up a fuss, well, maybe you need to be investigated for your hate crimes.
[00:52:01.658 --> 00:52:06.159]  Absolutely insidious, chilling, modern Britain that we're living in right now.
[00:52:06.399 --> 00:52:14.100]  While we have, like, 3,000 Islamic terrorists running around, police don't do anything about it, but if you send an Islamophobic tweet, they're banging on your door.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.860]  That's the country we live in right now.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.181]  Now, Maxine Waters has come out.
[00:52:19.081 --> 00:52:20.341]  This is out of American Mirror.
[00:52:20.881 --> 00:52:25.582]  Maxine Waters' Impeach 45 chant sends Glamour Awards into frenzy.
[00:52:26.169 --> 00:52:36.531]  California Congresswoman Maxine Waters continued her crusade against President Trump this week by leading women at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in an Impeach 45 chant at Brooklyn's King Theatre.
[00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:37.891]  And we have the clip.
[00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:38.651]  Here it is.
[00:52:38.671 --> 00:52:40.432]  Impeach him!
[00:52:40.732 --> 00:52:41.652]  Impeach him!
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.040]  Impeach him!
[00:52:56.641 --> 00:53:03.624]  Impeach 45!
[00:53:03.704 --> 00:53:04.024]  Impeach 45!
[00:53:04.385 --> 00:53:07.826]  I need to hear you!
[00:53:08.467 --> 00:53:09.787]  Impeach 45!
[00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:10.468]  Thank you!
[00:53:17.141 --> 00:53:17.781]  There you have it.
[00:53:18.242 --> 00:53:19.662]  Mad Maxine once again.
[00:53:20.162 --> 00:53:34.448]  Now notice how we're seeing, with this Trump derangement syndrome, which is still virulent, the magazine and fashion industries giving awards to people purely due to their Trump derangement syndrome being the loudest.
[00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:41.771]  The ones who screech the loudest about impeachment, about how evil Hitler-like, Nazi-like, fascist-like Trump is,
[00:53:42.415 --> 00:53:45.406]  They get the award because it's a massive circle jerk.
[00:53:45.447 --> 00:53:46.932]  It's not about achievements.
[00:53:47.777 --> 00:53:50.919]  GQ Magazine just gave Colin Kaepernick Man of the Year.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.421]  His career's completely fallen off the cliff.
[00:53:53.722 --> 00:53:54.842]  He's a total failure.
[00:53:55.343 --> 00:53:56.504]  Why did they give him the award?
[00:53:56.564 --> 00:54:00.146]  Because he screeched the loudest with his Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:54:00.466 --> 00:54:01.347]  That's what they have to do.
[00:54:01.868 --> 00:54:09.713]  Despite the fact, by the way, we saw with Condé Nast and GQ Magazine, their subscribers are plummeting, just like Colin Kaepernick's career.
[00:54:09.974 --> 00:54:15.738]  We've seen in Hollywood, all the virtue singling in Hollywood, Hollywood is collapsing, revenues are way down.
[00:54:16.477 --> 00:54:19.365]  A massive reduction in people buying tickets to movies.
[00:54:19.705 --> 00:54:21.630]  We've seen it in television ratings.
[00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:25.841]  They see Kaepernick, Man of the Year, even though he's a complete failure.
[00:54:26.678 --> 00:54:34.042]  We've seen television, Netflix series that get into this whole Trump derangement syndrome, insert politics into everything.
[00:54:34.502 --> 00:54:36.083]  Their ratings are collapsing.
[00:54:36.343 --> 00:54:43.587]  We've seen the NFL and we had the big poll where people said they were not watching the NFL anymore because it was getting too political.
[00:54:43.908 --> 00:54:51.512]  When people sit back and want to be entertained and watch a movie or watch a football game, they don't want to hear about the damn politics.
[00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:59.075]  But no, they're so hysterical they have to inject it into everything because they lost the argument politically in 2016.
[00:54:59.135 --> 00:55:03.598]  So they have to intensify it even more culturally.
[00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:07.181]  Like Andrew Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture.
[00:55:07.581 --> 00:55:08.842]  They're losing the debate.
[00:55:08.882 --> 00:55:10.503]  They're losing the argument politically.
[00:55:10.783 --> 00:55:20.150]  So they have to ramp up the hysteria by inserting it into culture to energize their base to get out and vote for Democrats, which we saw with the recent elections.
[00:55:21.016 --> 00:55:24.002]  It's working to some extent, but to another extent it's not.
[00:55:24.082 --> 00:55:25.464]  They're losing ratings.
[00:55:26.226 --> 00:55:27.268]  They're losing income.
[00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:33.279]  And to have Maxine Waters being given an award, this is the same woman.
[00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.111]  Who basically called for Trump's impeachment the day after he was in office.
[00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:38.551]  I mean, it was straight from the off, right?
[00:55:38.831 --> 00:55:49.675]  This is the same woman who said that the evidence of Russian collusion with Trump was that Putin, Vladimir Putin, invented the phrases, lock her up and crooked Hillary.
[00:55:50.015 --> 00:55:57.597]  She got up on MSNBC and claimed that with no evidence whatsoever, but that was her bombshell evidence for Russian collusion with Trump.
[00:55:57.997 --> 00:56:00.738]  Because a few weeks ago, she came out at another event
[00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:04.781]  And called, said she would basically quote, take out Trump.
[00:56:06.442 --> 00:56:14.328]  Dangerous, radical rhetoric, especially in light of all these anti-Trump domestic terrorists that have come to light over the past few weeks.
[00:56:14.348 --> 00:56:15.889]  We had another one of those yesterday.
[00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:26.517]  Now this is a woman, Maxine Waters of course, who came out and said that Russian bots were responsible for hanging physical banners outside of her political events.
[00:56:26.777 --> 00:56:28.839]  Russian bots hanging physical banners.
[00:56:29.645 --> 00:56:31.565]  This is the sanity of this woman.
[00:56:31.646 --> 00:56:34.366]  She's like a rung below Nancy Pelosi at this point.
[00:56:34.966 --> 00:56:39.867]  This is a woman, Maxine Waters, who came out and said, quote, I was a millennial once.
[00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:42.108]  No, you weren't a millennial once.
[00:56:43.788 --> 00:56:46.989]  This is a woman who confused Russia and Ukraine.
[00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:50.170]  She said there was a connection between Ukraine and Trump.
[00:56:50.828 --> 00:57:00.579]  Again, she's made completely bizarre, insane statements on a regular basis, but she's the one who screeches the loudest so she gets given awards.
[00:57:00.979 --> 00:57:02.641]  Meanwhile, Marie Claire is coming out.
[00:57:03.596 --> 00:57:10.679]  And tweeting, we're still waiting for an explanation of Taylor Swift's decision to remain apolitical during the 2016 election.
[00:57:10.919 --> 00:57:12.540]  Hashtag reputation.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:23.324]  So they're now crashing down on Taylor Swift, who is an entertainer and a singer, for not again injecting politics into everything by coming out and bashing Trump.
[00:57:24.088 --> 00:57:29.730]  Oh, you know, maybe she just wants to be an entertainer and not an amplifier of your relentless, deranged hysteria.
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:32.511]  Have you ever considered that possibility?
[00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:32.911]  But no.
[00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:35.391]  If you're not on their team, you're scum.
[00:57:35.571 --> 00:57:36.432]  They're going to attack you.
[00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.572]  They're going to drag you down.
[00:57:37.612 --> 00:57:42.073]  You have to inject this Trump derangement and hysteria into absolutely everything.
[00:57:42.133 --> 00:57:43.854]  And now they're going after Taylor Swift.
[00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.215]  That's the end of my segment.
[00:57:46.235 --> 00:57:47.755]  We'll be back for the second hour.
[00:57:47.795 --> 00:57:48.315]  Don't miss it.
[00:57:48.355 --> 00:57:50.016]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:50.036 --> 00:57:50.496]  Don't go away.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:01.889]  Just briefly.
[00:58:03.121 --> 00:58:05.122]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[00:58:05.162 --> 00:58:06.023]  He's about to retire.
[00:58:06.043 --> 00:58:13.127]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[00:58:13.167 --> 00:58:16.148]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[00:58:16.168 --> 00:58:17.149]  That's a bunch of bull.
[00:58:17.669 --> 00:58:18.770]  You need fluoride or you die.
[00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.792]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:22.592]  He said, this is incredible.
[00:58:22.992 --> 00:58:24.993]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[00:58:25.214 --> 00:58:30.917]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[00:58:31.517 --> 00:58:31.978]  Exactly.
[00:58:32.038 --> 00:58:38.023]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:41.867]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:46.771]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[00:58:47.859 --> 00:58:49.500]  Copped up version of fluoride.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.200]  It's been turned into an acid.
[00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:52.481]  It's an adjuvant.
[00:58:52.521 --> 00:58:53.201]  It's very toxic.
[00:58:53.561 --> 00:59:02.105]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously.
[00:59:02.445 --> 00:59:03.546]  And for seven years the
[00:59:04.506 --> 00:59:08.109]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:09.770]  Why does it say nursery water?
[00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:11.011]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[00:59:11.071 --> 00:59:13.974]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[00:59:14.014 --> 00:59:15.995]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:16.195 --> 00:59:25.943]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[00:59:26.503 --> 00:59:27.744]  But you die without iodine.
[00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.326]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[00:59:29.726 --> 00:59:31.107]  You drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[00:59:31.147 --> 00:59:32.068]  That's a different type of iodine.
[00:59:32.088 --> 00:59:33.489]  This is the real medical grade.
[00:59:33.929 --> 00:59:42.231]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[00:59:42.811 --> 00:59:46.191]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:56.173 --> 01:00:00.054]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.007 --> 01:00:09.428]  We are on the march.
[01:00:09.828 --> 01:00:13.831]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:14.032 --> 01:00:18.655]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.695 --> 01:00:21.117]  You're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.157 --> 01:00:30.063]  Alex will be coming up in the next segment to cover the latest news but for the moment in this final few minutes let's hit a few more news stories that I've found of interest.
[01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:31.484]  Now we were talking about Taylor Swift.
[01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.486]  She's been absolutely slammed
[01:00:33.946 --> 01:00:43.693]  For not being political during the 2016 election, for not throwing her weight in with Hillary Clinton, or coming out against Trump in the aftermath of his inauguration.
[01:00:43.713 --> 01:00:50.098]  Because God forbid an entertainer would just want to concentrate on, I don't know, entertaining people?
[01:00:50.138 --> 01:00:50.318]  No.
[01:00:50.719 --> 01:00:55.242]  If she's not part of your Trump derangement syndrome hysteria, she's basically trash.
[01:00:55.762 --> 01:00:57.363]  Now they're coming after Taylor Swift.
[01:00:57.664 --> 01:00:58.965]  We have Jon Stewart.
[01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.706]  There you see the Marie Claire tweet.
[01:01:02.705 --> 01:01:07.612]  We're still waiting for an explanation of Taylor Swift's decision to remain apolitical during the 2016 election.
[01:01:07.853 --> 01:01:09.134]  Hashtag reputation!
[01:01:09.715 --> 01:01:11.698]  Look, they only got 163 retweets.
[01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:17.627]  And if you look in the comments of that tweet, the Marie Claire tweet, they got absolutely slaughtered.
[01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:27.672]  So they're going after Taylor Swift because she wants to remain apolitical, which jives with what people are saying when you poll them about the NFL or about Hollywood.
[01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:31.554]  When they watch a movie or a football game, they just want to be entertained.
[01:01:31.914 --> 01:01:36.637]  They don't want to be confronted with politics and hysteria all the frigging time.
[01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:39.098]  Can you just give it a rest for five minutes?
[01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:47.883]  No, they have to destroy everybody because it's part of the hashtag resistance, which is the hysteria that has built up out of
[01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.202]  Hillary Clinton losing.
[01:01:50.442 --> 01:01:52.044]  And that's the sole reason.
[01:01:52.124 --> 01:01:54.766]  They're still butthurt about it over a year later.
[01:01:55.246 --> 01:01:56.287]  Jon Stewart's come out.
[01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:57.348]  This is newsbusters.
[01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:00.450]  Jon Stewart to anyone who wants even-handed comedy.
[01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:01.311]  Tough!
[01:02:01.811 --> 01:02:02.792]  S-H-I-T.
[01:02:03.192 --> 01:02:08.657]  Liberal comedian Jon Stewart on Tuesday ranted at anyone who isn't happy with the politicised tone of late-night comedy.
[01:02:09.137 --> 01:02:10.638]  And boy is it politicised.
[01:02:11.039 --> 01:02:12.960]  Telling the New York Times, tough!
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:13.801]  S-H-I-T.
[01:02:14.461 --> 01:02:21.023]  Of course, he also slimed conservatives as bigots for objecting to the angry liberalism of Jimmy Kimmel or Seth Meyers.
[01:02:22.223 --> 01:02:26.944]  Jon Stewart said, quote, the people that say this culture isn't for me live in a nostalgic world.
[01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:30.225]  Those are the people who are the first to tell minorities suck it up.
[01:02:31.185 --> 01:02:38.227]  So Jon Stewart's basically saying, no, everybody has to be hyper-partisan, even in comedy.
[01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:45.922]  Now, we were amazed a few days ago when Saturday Night Live came out and did a skit that made the Democrats look a little bit goofy.
[01:02:46.502 --> 01:02:56.028]  Because it's so rare now, they've signed over everything to this hashtag resistance hysteria that being funny has gone out of the window.
[01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:56.969]  Okay?
[01:02:57.269 --> 01:03:00.311]  Most of this is drab, it's pathetic, it's not even funny anymore.
[01:03:00.551 --> 01:03:03.673]  They've got like teams of 20, 30 writers on this.
[01:03:04.273 --> 01:03:07.816]  You put on Jimmy Kimmel and it's him ranting about gun control for 20 minutes.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.161]  What happened to the comedy?
[01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:21.707]  What happened to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert back when they were actually funny on The Daily Show like 15 years ago, almost, bashing both Republicans and Democrats?
[01:03:21.767 --> 01:03:23.168]  That was actually funny.
[01:03:23.808 --> 01:03:30.252]  Now it's this unhinged hysterical urge to have Trump impeached simply through hysteria alone.
[01:03:30.956 --> 01:03:41.712]  I mean there was a thing today where he put out a tweet which was obviously a drafted tweet that had been saved on his phone from before he went abroad about the Silverland Springs Church church shooting.
[01:03:41.732 --> 01:03:46.239]  He comes back from Asia, it gets tweeted out, it's oh my god.
[01:03:46.992 --> 01:03:47.953]  Absolute meltdown.
[01:03:48.013 --> 01:03:52.038]  Trump made a mistake in a tweet that was drafted and sent out from his phone.
[01:03:52.198 --> 01:03:52.759]  Oh my God.
[01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:54.841]  Surely an impeachable offence, right?
[01:03:55.322 --> 01:03:56.923]  This is the level of hysteria.
[01:03:56.984 --> 01:03:58.605]  You saw it with feeding the fish.
[01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:00.528]  There you see the headline.
[01:04:00.568 --> 01:04:02.810]  It was a tweet that was saved in his phone.
[01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:05.413]  Obviously a draft from before he left the country.
[01:04:05.433 --> 01:04:06.054]  It was sent out.
[01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:07.904]  Absolute meltdown.
[01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.065]  You saw the hysteria about the fish.
[01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:11.486]  Oh my God, the fish!
[01:04:12.066 --> 01:04:13.547]  He dumped the fish food.
[01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:15.267]  How boorish!
[01:04:15.307 --> 01:04:18.489]  This is a diplomatic incident, some of them even suggested.
[01:04:18.869 --> 01:04:20.449]  Of course, it was completely fake news.
[01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:34.135]  But this is a level we've reached right now, where even at the expense of their own industries, with box office income plummeting, with NFL audiences turning off, with ESPN's audience, their viewership, collapsing,
[01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:40.679]  They still insist on injecting Trump derangement hysteria into everything.
[01:04:40.719 --> 01:04:44.121]  They're quite prepared to cut off their nose to spite their face.
[01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:54.166]  It's absolute intense overload hysteria and now Jon Stewart signed on to it and Taylor Swift will be destroyed because she refuses to do so.
[01:04:55.466 --> 01:04:56.127]  Don't go away.
[01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:59.348]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at InfoWars.com.

[01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:13.559]  We are on the march.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.402]  The empire is on the run.
[01:06:16.902 --> 01:06:19.645]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:24.645 --> 01:06:27.867]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two.
[01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:29.608]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.748 --> 01:06:31.028]  We just had Paul Watson on.
[01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:33.850]  Extremely powerful information and analysis.
[01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:38.432]  And we've got more with Paul in a tape report he did.
[01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:45.996]  The new sexual Puritans showing how the left is equating normal sexual activity and normal courting
[01:06:47.091 --> 01:06:57.518]  Between men and women as sexual assault, but then basically trying to cover up for what Hollywood and other organizations are doing when it comes down to trying to even mainline pedophilia.
[01:06:57.818 --> 01:07:00.780]  So that's all coming up a little bit later in the hour.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.002]  More with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:07:03.582 --> 01:07:12.788]  Now we've got some really serious news I wanted to just mention before I get into the big news that's up on Infowars.com from Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:07:17.191 --> 01:07:20.252]  Engaged in Weinstein-level groping.
[01:07:20.793 --> 01:07:22.913]  He would mess with every single woman or teen.
[01:07:23.053 --> 01:07:23.734]  It was horrible.
[01:07:24.314 --> 01:07:30.616]  Well, I don't need to hear that from a Secret Service agent to know it's true.
[01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:38.980]  We have put out over the last four or five years, it's got to be more than 15 reports, some of which are an hour long.
[01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:48.340]  And Paul Watson has a bunch of examples of these in his article of three-year-olds, five-year-olds, eight-year-olds, ten-year-olds, twelve-year-olds, thirteen, fourteen.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.945]  I mean, he comes over, grabs them by the arm, is clearly rubbing on them, rubbing on their buttockses.
[01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:58.230]  It is the creepiest thing I've seen since that drag queen.
[01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:13.758]  Festival they had last weekend in Austin where men are shaking their butts in small children's faces and dressed as women and then little girls and boys are giving them money and then men are totally naked except for glitter on their genitals.
[01:08:15.598 --> 01:08:16.959]  So it just goes on and on.
[01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:20.563]  Creepy Joe Biden has been known for this for decades.
[01:08:20.583 --> 01:08:22.805]  But he does it on C-SPAN.
[01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.548]  He did it when he was in the White House as the VP.
[01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:37.619]  And so I think it's critical, coming up later in the broadcast there, maybe with Owen Schroer at 3 o'clock on The War Room, maybe we should just air, during a three-hour show, maybe an hour of groping?
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.841]  Because you've got to see it to believe it.
[01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:43.882]  I know we're mainly a radio show, but we can give you commentary of it.
[01:08:44.142 --> 01:08:45.363]  You've got to go see it for yourself.
[01:08:45.403 --> 01:08:46.263]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:08:47.463 --> 01:08:49.864]  The Democrats are defending Biden.
[01:08:50.364 --> 01:08:52.185]  They've been defending Bill Clinton for decades.
[01:08:53.565 --> 01:09:06.170]  When we first heard that Roy Moore was being accused by people connected to Hillary's previous campaign who'd worked for her and who'd worked for the candidate who he's running against, Mr. Jones, in Alabama,
[01:09:07.262 --> 01:09:13.707]  I thought this looked suspicious because we saw false charges against Trump that turned out to be totally made up by Jane Doe's that didn't exist.
[01:09:14.648 --> 01:09:19.332]  And I said, wow, the news is he told girls they were pretty because that's what I first read.
[01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:32.623]  But then by the time more came out that same day last week, what was it, Wednesday, Thursday, by the time more came out on more, it was like, well, I did date teens when I was 35, but I did ask their mamas permission.
[01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.031]  And that's the creep zone.
[01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:35.972]  Okay?
[01:09:36.052 --> 01:09:36.552]  It's weird.
[01:09:37.153 --> 01:09:40.095]  And then the trolling around the malls trying to pick up teenage women.
[01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:40.915]  Okay?
[01:09:42.316 --> 01:09:43.197]  That's not illegal.
[01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:44.498]  But it's creepy.
[01:09:44.558 --> 01:09:46.739]  And it's par for the course for these politicians.
[01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.941]  So now Stephen Bannon has turned on him.
[01:09:49.501 --> 01:09:53.904]  Drugs Report has the headline, Bannon turns on Judge Hoare.
[01:09:54.765 --> 01:09:55.485]  Now, I'll say this.
[01:09:56.606 --> 01:10:00.129]  There's been no allegations of this past the time he got married.
[01:10:01.543 --> 01:10:04.784]  And I don't think what he did was probably illegal, but we don't know.
[01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:26.193]  The issue here is, the headlines are being run that revolutionary Republicans, Trump-supporting Republicans, libertarian Republicans, Freedom Caucus Republicans are stumbling, are crippled, are in deep trouble, are having huge problems dealing with the fact that all of this is unfolding, and it hurts their brand.
[01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:30.795]  Alabama Senate nightmare leaves Republican revolutionaries spiraling.
[01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:42.315]  Wait, Hollywood has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that have been caught engaged in pedophilia, you name it.
[01:10:42.976 --> 01:10:45.718]  You've got raping of children, and none of them are even getting in trouble.
[01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:46.919]  Where are the indictments?
[01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:47.919]  Where are the criminal arrests?
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:59.148]  So again, you have these two different yardsticks where conservatives find some bad apples, or potentially bad apples, and it's the end of the world, and we all take on the guilt, and it's our fault.
[01:11:01.072 --> 01:11:05.535]  No, it's not my fault Judge Roy Moore may have been involved in some creepy behavior.
[01:11:06.215 --> 01:11:25.128]  And all I'm saying is, if you're going to have national news about the sexualization of teenage women, 16, 17, 18 years old, as low as maybe 14, which I think starts getting into the pedophilia zone, you know, serious, serious, serious issue, not just statutory rape, then we've got to look
[01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:39.836]  At the Drag Queen Festival they had in Austin, all these others, where full-grown men come up and shake their butts in little boys' and little girls' faces, and then pose naked with only glitter on their genitals, with little boys dressed up like girls, and then kiss on them!
[01:11:41.137 --> 01:11:50.922]  I mean, I don't even want to show the photos again we showed, that they posted on their own Facebook, of men with nothing on, with little kids!
[01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:58.347]  I mean, if you're gonna sit there, and notice, none of the media picked that up, Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz's powerful report.
[01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:13.718]  Because they did it fairly, they did it straight on, they were invited in, it was there, they said, sure, videotape it, the group posted it to their own Facebook and Twitter, there's hundreds of YouTube videos the groups shot, they were live streaming, they were completely proud of men on stripper poles!
[01:12:15.225 --> 01:12:29.239]  Hanging down with three-year-old little white kids and black kids and little girls and boys, walking over confused, giving $5 bills to obese men wearing thongs and garter belts.
[01:12:32.327 --> 01:12:38.108]  And the media's like, look, Jones is bashing drag queens because they're fat.
[01:12:38.368 --> 01:12:41.309]  Well, yeah, Playboy was full of 500-pound women.
[01:12:41.749 --> 01:12:43.109]  You'd say, what's wrong with Playboy?
[01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:56.171]  I mean, that's the added thing is there's like a celebration of big fat men with wigs on, with little kids giving them money when they're on stripper poles, and the men are beyond twerking, shaking their big butts in little kids' faces, man.
[01:12:56.391 --> 01:12:59.432]  This is like something out of a PCP hallucination.
[01:13:01.914 --> 01:13:02.757]  It's crazy!
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:07.714]  It's absolutely insane that no media covered it.
[01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:12.374]  Except Media Matters, run by George Soros and David Brock.
[01:13:12.614 --> 01:13:15.355]  And they didn't say what I was talking about in their article.
[01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:20.096]  They just had a little snip of me saying, why are so many of these drag queens super fat?
[01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:21.157]  I mean, what is the issue?
[01:13:21.177 --> 01:13:28.279]  So I was showing a transsexual libertarian lady, Blair White, that got beat up for wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[01:13:28.639 --> 01:13:31.480]  And I said, where are the ones that look like this lady?
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.801]  I'm just saying, why is she a libertarian?
[01:13:33.821 --> 01:13:34.781]  And then the liberal
[01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:38.102]  Drag queens or transsexuals are super ugly.
[01:13:38.142 --> 01:13:45.043]  I mean, I have a right to say that what is up with a bunch of ugly men dressed like women shaking their butts in little kids' faces?
[01:13:46.283 --> 01:13:53.924]  And I have a right to sit here and say then, okay, Judge Roy Moore trolled them all, and he admits that he dated teenagers.
[01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:56.285]  I think that's creepy.
[01:13:57.405 --> 01:13:59.306]  I think that's weird.
[01:14:00.146 --> 01:14:01.286]  I don't think it's illegal.
[01:14:02.349 --> 01:14:09.678]  But if some of the stuff's true, and it's been put into question because they're Democratic operatives and other things, I've got some serious, serious questions.
[01:14:09.838 --> 01:14:15.044]  And again, it's not like I am the ultimate Puritan on the planet, okay?
[01:14:15.965 --> 01:14:18.488]  It's just that it shows arrested development in a man.
[01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:30.514]  When he's 35 and he's going after 16-year-old girls and then asking their parents if he can date them, it just sounds like some type of weird Netflix series about a creepy weird town or something.
[01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:31.034]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:31.274 --> 01:14:42.940]  Now, again, Hollywood's 10 times, 20 times, 100 times more creepy with devil worship and pedophilia and sexualization of children and targeting the family and targeting America and going after everybody.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:15:00.138]  So I am way more mad at them, and then I'm even madder that the whole media is covering Judge Roy Moore and some of his what appears to be creepy behavior versus the giant mountains of stuff they're involved in, and Joe Biden groping little girls hundreds of times on television,
[01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:04.281]  Grabbing him, taking control, fathers reaching over and pushing him aside.
[01:15:05.942 --> 01:15:08.443]  Little girls up there in the Senate.
[01:15:08.824 --> 01:15:14.027]  And here comes Biden trying to grab on her and Senator Sessions slaps his hand.
[01:15:14.387 --> 01:15:15.888]  That was only two years ago.
[01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:17.549]  We've got the footage of that.
[01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:19.871]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:15:20.371 --> 01:15:21.772]  This is out of control.
[01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:25.755]  This is the reality of what's going on.
[01:15:25.835 --> 01:15:27.016]  And we have to face it.
[01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:29.818]  And it freaks me out to go judge Moore, too.
[01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:33.160]  I mean, good God, how many of these people are there?
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.080]  What happened?
[01:15:34.381 --> 01:15:46.849]  I mean, I just had no idea there were so many people into children or into underage people, and it makes me want to throw up, and it wants me to find out why this is happening, and it makes me want to stop it!
[01:15:47.369 --> 01:15:51.212]  But is the Republican-Libertarian revolution derailed if this is true?
[01:15:51.392 --> 01:15:58.236]  That one guy was on the weird spectrum, but not even in the pedophile spectrum, so we're now all guilty, but Hollywood's a bunch of angels?
[01:15:58.576 --> 01:15:58.817]  No!
[01:16:03.376 --> 01:16:10.080]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:13.001]  By studying what they fear.
[01:16:13.701 --> 01:16:15.522]  They fear families living together.
[01:16:15.562 --> 01:16:18.484]  They fear people loving God.
[01:16:18.564 --> 01:16:23.206]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[01:16:24.527 --> 01:16:31.751]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[01:16:33.737 --> 01:16:40.179]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:47.841]  That's why it is essential, on every front, to support InfoWars.
[01:16:48.742 --> 01:17:01.826]  When you get a t-shirt, like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[01:17:02.856 --> 01:17:09.421]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[01:17:10.702 --> 01:17:18.468]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:21.370]  And so many things will happen.
[01:17:22.591 --> 01:17:23.592]  We are the majority.
[01:17:24.502 --> 01:17:33.231]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[01:17:34.392 --> 01:17:39.418]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[01:17:40.848 --> 01:17:43.290]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:52.337]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[01:17:53.018 --> 01:17:59.382]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[01:18:01.264 --> 01:18:02.145]  So many people write me.
[01:18:02.967 --> 01:18:11.223]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[01:18:11.964 --> 01:18:13.567]  We have to fly our flag.
[01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:16.011]  We have to wear our colors.
[01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:20.953]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:21.633 --> 01:18:24.493]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[01:18:24.694 --> 01:18:35.956]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[01:18:36.176 --> 01:18:38.197]  We change the world with a Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[01:18:38.777 --> 01:18:40.960]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.643]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:50.713]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[01:18:51.213 --> 01:18:55.859]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:03.726]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[01:19:04.066 --> 01:19:07.049]  It is a total complete 360 win.

[01:19:25.183 --> 01:19:33.925]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[01:19:34.586 --> 01:19:39.267]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[01:19:39.287 --> 01:19:51.170]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:54.971]  So please, from myself and my family and the amazing crew,
[01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:56.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.332]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.993]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:05.495]  Or you're mine.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:32.044]  Part of the radio show today is live in the studio, and Paul Watson as well from London.
[01:20:32.384 --> 01:20:37.329]  But part of it is also taped while I take care of business in and around town.
[01:20:37.349 --> 01:20:41.113]  But I will be back in studio here coming up in just a little while.
[01:20:41.573 --> 01:20:47.058]  Well, you talk about hypocrisy, and I want to be clear before the media spins this, the fake news media, the corporate media.
[01:20:48.019 --> 01:20:52.343]  Judge Roy Moore involved himself in creepy behavior in his own admissions.
[01:20:54.315 --> 01:20:58.664]  Courting girls that were 14, 15, 16, 17 years old.
[01:20:58.684 --> 01:21:00.528]  I don't care if it was 35 years ago.
[01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:01.651]  It was weird.
[01:21:02.352 --> 01:21:03.254]  Is it pedophilia?
[01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:09.828]  No, but it does border on very, very serious creepiness.
[01:21:10.488 --> 01:21:13.390]  And if he forced himself on some of these young women, it would be statutory rape.
[01:21:14.031 --> 01:21:15.492]  But they're not saying he raped them.
[01:21:15.512 --> 01:21:16.973]  They're saying he tried to force himself on them.
[01:21:17.313 --> 01:21:18.454]  So that would be sexual assault.
[01:21:19.094 --> 01:21:27.820]  That said, we have hours of footage of Joe Biden roping little girls and women on television, on C-SPAN and at the White House on national television.
[01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:29.161]  There's hours of it.
[01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:32.324]  Paul Watson has an article out today where a Secret Service agent
[01:21:33.224 --> 01:21:38.528]  Has come out and said that it was Weinstein level of women and teens.
[01:21:39.028 --> 01:21:41.950]  Well, I don't need to know that from the Secret Service agent or others.
[01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:43.611]  He does it on television.
[01:21:43.631 --> 01:21:47.934]  Hell, we got Senator Sessions swatting his hand away from a five-year-old girl on video.
[01:21:48.774 --> 01:21:50.715]  I mean, it's well known he's like Weinstein.
[01:21:51.116 --> 01:21:53.197]  These people are completely entitled out of control.
[01:21:53.817 --> 01:21:56.759]  We've got countless videos of fathers pushing his hand off their daughters.
[01:21:56.819 --> 01:21:57.880]  I mean, he grabs them by the arm.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.141]  He pulls them into him.
[01:21:59.161 --> 01:21:59.961]  He says, you're gorgeous.
[01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:00.522]  You're beautiful.
[01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:01.723]  Whispers in their ear.
[01:22:02.943 --> 01:22:07.226]  More aggressively than I did to women in college that I wanted to pick up.
[01:22:08.247 --> 01:22:10.409]  You know, at a bar or wherever.
[01:22:10.429 --> 01:22:12.010]  I mean, I, you know, come over and tell them they're gorgeous.
[01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.790]  Let's dance.
[01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:13.551]  Let's go have fun.
[01:22:13.851 --> 01:22:14.352]  Hey, let's go see a movie.
[01:22:14.372 --> 01:22:16.453]  Let's, you know, what do you like to do for fun?
[01:22:17.114 --> 01:22:20.196]  And only if they looked interested would I start petting them on the arm.
[01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.857]  That's like a 20-year-old woman.
[01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.138]  Not grabbing them by the arm.
[01:22:23.158 --> 01:22:24.659]  I mean, women would bolt if you did that.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.482]  So, there's a super creepiness to this.
[01:22:28.642 --> 01:22:31.544]  All I'm saying is, if the Republican Party
[01:22:33.121 --> 01:22:39.119]  If the Republican Party is going to sit there and decry Roy Moore.
[01:22:40.339 --> 01:22:42.660]  And flip out about all this and act like it's the end of the world.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.083]  Why are they so silent on Bill Clinton and on Joe Biden and on even Weinstein?
[01:22:48.103 --> 01:22:48.843]  We hardly hear from them.
[01:22:49.204 --> 01:22:53.986]  And the truth is because they're going on the mainstream media and they know the mainstream media is aware of their scandals.
[01:22:54.306 --> 01:23:03.351]  And a bunch of them have mistresses or gang or have been dating underage women or boys, young men and or pedophilia.
[01:23:03.971 --> 01:23:10.298]  Remember Barney Frank said, everybody better stop investigating my three-story townhouse that they were running an underage brothel out of.
[01:23:10.378 --> 01:23:12.640]  I mean, 12, 13-year-olds, that was confirmed.
[01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:15.163]  That was the low end, most of them were like 16, 17.
[01:23:15.663 --> 01:23:16.164]  It's criminal.
[01:23:16.884 --> 01:23:19.567]  And he said, half the people in here are involved.
[01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.950]  So you shut it down, you shut it down now.
[01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:23.011]  That's on C-SPAN.
[01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:29.141]  And, you know, a lot of congressmen and folks have exposed it, they end up dead.
[01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:33.425]  So this is the secret society system they use to control people.
[01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:40.111]  And all I'm saying is, when we first heard he was telling people their daughters were pretty, and all this, when they were 16, 17, I thought, well, a little creepy.
[01:23:40.131 --> 01:23:46.377]  But now we're hearing all this other stuff, it's bad news, and the Republicans are calling him Judge Roy Hoare.
[01:23:47.177 --> 01:23:49.640]  And that's the headline on Drudge, you know, is, you know, Judge Hoare.
[01:23:50.956 --> 01:24:03.569]  Madden turning on Judge Hoare and now the media is branding it like conservatives are to blame and that conservatives are now discredited and the whole libertarian movement is discredited because we got one guy trying to ask out girls that are underage.
[01:24:03.589 --> 01:24:13.899]  You got Biden telling them they're sexy and they're pretty when they're eight years old on video and patting on their butts and feeling all over them and some of the parents come over and go, whoa dude!
[01:24:14.927 --> 01:24:15.868]  And like, push him off.
[01:24:16.129 --> 01:24:19.412]  We've shown the footage, we've covered it, but the media never picks it up.
[01:24:20.133 --> 01:24:23.977]  But Paul Watson has a bunch of examples posted in his article.
[01:24:24.498 --> 01:24:28.982]  Ex-Secret Service agent claims Biden engaged in Weinstein-level groping.
[01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:30.144]  How far are we into this live feed?
[01:24:30.424 --> 01:24:31.125]  We are four minutes.
[01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:36.771]  Fantastic, because I'm going to go another four or five minutes to finish up for this segment, then I'm going to continue on for everybody watching live.
[01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:40.012]  And we'll air this on the radio later as well.
[01:24:40.312 --> 01:24:46.293]  Because what I do is when I got family stuff to take care of or whatever, I'll tend to come in and take part of the show early or have guest hosts on.
[01:24:46.553 --> 01:24:49.954]  But there's so much breaking news that I'm going to be popping in and out today live.
[01:24:49.974 --> 01:24:55.195]  And live feeds I'm going to do that will also end up being taped up here on the radio.
[01:24:55.955 --> 01:24:56.615]  So here it is.
[01:24:56.755 --> 01:25:02.097]  Ex-Secret Service agent claims Biden engaged in Weinstein-level groping of women and teens.
[01:25:02.157 --> 01:25:02.797]  Quote, it was horrible.
[01:25:04.537 --> 01:25:19.867]  All I'm saying is, if we're going to have a national conniption fit over Judge Roy Moore, that we don't have video doing any of this, and a lot of it's been proven to be untrue and political operatives, but Moore admits he was pursuing 16-year-olds.
[01:25:19.947 --> 01:25:20.748]  I've got to get 35.
[01:25:20.828 --> 01:25:21.408]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.048 --> 01:25:22.789]  I think that's creepy.
[01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:25.430]  But it's kind of an old-timey thing.
[01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:35.436]  It's kind of like the Muslims do, where, well, before your daughter gets runs off with the wrong guy, you know, see if the young prosecutor, you know, wants to end up marrying your daughter when they're 18.
[01:25:36.116 --> 01:25:37.577]  That is an old Southern thing.
[01:25:37.597 --> 01:25:40.579]  People used to get married when they were 13 on the wagon trails.
[01:25:41.699 --> 01:25:44.421]  You know, founding fathers, some of them had 16-year-old wives.
[01:25:45.717 --> 01:25:49.719]  The point is, is that back then, development wasn't arrested.
[01:25:50.119 --> 01:26:03.385]  You were doing chores when you were five years old, shooting guns when you were five years old, and as soon as you went into puberty, a few years, families would try to get you with an up-and-coming, successful man, so that you would be well-placed.
[01:26:04.385 --> 01:26:07.669]  The Muslims do it to the extreme, and I don't like all that orthodox stuff.
[01:26:08.650 --> 01:26:11.773]  So, that's where I stand as a father of three daughters, man.
[01:26:12.414 --> 01:26:15.858]  Some 35-year-old man came around and wanted to date my daughter when she's 16.
[01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:19.762]  I got a 14- and a 9-year-old daughter, and I've got a 6-month-old daughter.
[01:26:20.322 --> 01:26:21.604]  I say, listen, man, that's creepy.
[01:26:21.644 --> 01:26:22.405]  Get the hell out of here.
[01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:38.821]  The argument is, okay, well, your 16-year-old daughter will probably date gangbangers, you know, and end up getting, you know... I mean, I understand the whole mindset of, you know, what your daughter brings home, a white supremacist, maybe, or a thug, or a prisoner, a prison guy, or a gangbanger, or a drug dealer.
[01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:45.243]  That's where this comes from, this fear of rural conservatives that if...
[01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:52.352]  You could introduce your, you know, young daughter to the 25-year-old guy whose daddy owns a lumberyard.
[01:26:52.392 --> 01:26:54.212]  Well, she's going to be well-placed.
[01:26:54.232 --> 01:26:55.793]  That's where this comes from.
[01:26:57.153 --> 01:26:58.014]  I'm not defending it.
[01:26:58.114 --> 01:26:58.894]  I'm not supporting it.
[01:26:58.954 --> 01:27:01.034]  What I'm saying is we have Bill Clinton.
[01:27:01.155 --> 01:27:02.035]  We have Joe Biden.
[01:27:02.595 --> 01:27:04.636]  We have Weinstein not indicted yet.
[01:27:04.676 --> 01:27:06.436]  We have all this off the radar now.
[01:27:07.496 --> 01:27:11.998]  But the hundreds of convicted pedophiles still working in Hollywood and all of it, and the only thing on the radar
[01:27:13.377 --> 01:27:14.358]  Is Judge Roy Moore.
[01:27:14.858 --> 01:27:19.982]  Meanwhile, Al Franken joins the House Intelligence Committee hearing we had last week.
[01:27:20.282 --> 01:27:25.306]  This is the Senate calling for all conservative media to be banned off social media.
[01:27:25.586 --> 01:27:27.407]  Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, all of it.
[01:27:27.928 --> 01:27:29.168]  Because we're Russians!
[01:27:30.029 --> 01:27:31.270]  They called Rand Paul a Russian.
[01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:33.672]  They've called everybody a Russian.
[01:27:33.692 --> 01:27:34.913]  They've called me a Russian agent.
[01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:36.314]  They've called Trump that.
[01:27:36.354 --> 01:27:37.475]  They've called Matt Drudge that.
[01:27:37.535 --> 01:27:39.836]  They've called Tucker Carlson that.
[01:27:39.856 --> 01:27:44.800]  I mean, this is the globalist socialist that wants to recreate Soviet Russia here in America.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.142]  That article's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:27:47.622 --> 01:27:48.623]  Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.584]  Very important to read.
[01:27:50.624 --> 01:27:52.205]  Meanwhile, other big serious news.
[01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:55.848]  Black death plague ravaging Madagascar.
[01:27:55.908 --> 01:27:56.769]  That's the big island off.
[01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.710]  Uh, Africa.
[01:27:59.470 --> 01:28:01.871]  And it gets worse as antibiotics aren't working.
[01:28:02.312 --> 01:28:03.132]  That's the big threat.
[01:28:03.332 --> 01:28:06.694]  Antibiotic, immune, TB, black plague, you name it.
[01:28:07.154 --> 01:28:08.875]  That'll definitely screw things up.
[01:28:08.895 --> 01:28:09.836]  We're gonna be covering that.
[01:28:10.296 --> 01:28:15.879]  Alaska told to stockpile anti-radiation pills in case of North Korean nuclear attack.
[01:28:16.439 --> 01:28:17.940]  Uh, that's all escalating right there.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.101]  SpaceX is launching a secret mission.
[01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:22.842]  So now these private companies got secret missions.
[01:28:23.343 --> 01:28:25.484]  To Space Thursday, here's what we know so far.
[01:28:26.064 --> 01:28:26.304]  Yeah.
[01:28:46.227 --> 01:28:46.667]  Not true.
[01:28:46.727 --> 01:28:47.628]  It's been going on a long time.
[01:28:48.008 --> 01:28:49.469]  They're just telling you what's going on.
[01:28:49.809 --> 01:28:53.031]  Amazon's cashierless store is almost ready for prime time.
[01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:54.853]  Yeah, shop, shop, shop.
[01:28:55.533 --> 01:28:57.834]  Oh, you put Main Street and even Walmart out of business.
[01:28:57.894 --> 01:28:58.815]  Thought it was predatory.
[01:28:59.475 --> 01:29:01.737]  Meanwhile, the robots are coming in to replace everything.

[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:12.865]  Joining us is the Motor City Madman himself, the Omnibusman of the Second Amendment, and that of course is Ted Nugent of tednugent.com.
[01:30:12.885 --> 01:30:19.569]  I wish I could have you here on Better Times, but thank you for joining us to give your knowledge and your important input into what we're facing.
[01:30:19.609 --> 01:30:24.793]  But undoubtedly, Ted, we are seeing a full-out war declared on the Second Amendment.
[01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.554]  They're going for broke, Ted.
[01:30:26.914 --> 01:30:27.855]  Yeah, it's true, Alex.
[01:30:27.916 --> 01:30:28.977]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:30:29.097 --> 01:30:29.538]  I agree.
[01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:34.345]  I wish it could be under more pleasant circumstances because it is a wonderful time of year.
[01:30:34.425 --> 01:30:38.992]  I'm spending time with great families around the hunting campfires here in the swamps of Michigan.
[01:30:39.032 --> 01:30:42.637]  I just got back from Okinawa spending a week with the incredible
[01:30:45.066 --> 01:30:55.214]  So my spirit is on high right now, but it's also shattered because of this tragic, demonic, violent assault and massacre in Las Vegas.
[01:30:55.234 --> 01:31:00.619]  So yes, there is an assault on the Second Amendment, but I gotta tell you, Alex, I'm not out here alone.
[01:31:00.659 --> 01:31:04.402]  Not just the great men and women of the National Rifle Association, but good people.
[01:31:04.442 --> 01:31:14.490]  Completely destroying the lies and the fantasy of those that believe another gun law could have stopped this or any of the other mass shootings or
[01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:39.040]  I mean, if you can't keep real Kalashnikov machine guns out of people's hands in Paris, France, then obviously people with any intellect and common sense whatsoever will realize that there's nothing you can write on paper and turn into a law or a regulation that would have stopped any
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.963]  ...of the mass shootings because evil is as evil does.
[01:31:44.064 --> 01:31:57.394]  But we, the citizens of America, will not let our Second Amendment rights, our God-given, constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms, we will not let it be infringed.
[01:31:57.954 --> 01:32:01.355]  Any further, and we're making a stand right here and right now.
[01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:08.397]  An American who believes in peace and security and freedom has got to be a member of the National Rightful Association.
[01:32:08.537 --> 01:32:11.418]  That is the force of We the People.
[01:32:11.438 --> 01:32:20.981]  Remember, the National Rightful Association is simply a family grassroots organization that will not allow our Second Amendment rights to be infringed.
[01:32:21.141 --> 01:32:22.462]  That's all the NRA is.
[01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:23.362]  It's We the People.
[01:32:25.268 --> 01:32:26.969]  And the globalists know it.
[01:32:27.049 --> 01:32:36.616]  That's why Hillary, that's why Cobain, that's why all the usual Obermans said, quote, that the NRA is a terror organization that needs to be outlawed.
[01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:38.838]  So they're saying gun owners are terrorists now.
[01:32:39.841 --> 01:32:46.282]  Well, my response to the late night so-called comedians that aren't funny at all, they say we have to do something.
[01:32:46.322 --> 01:32:47.462]  We just have to do something.
[01:32:47.482 --> 01:32:50.083]  They throw their hands up and they say, we have to do something.
[01:32:50.103 --> 01:32:54.664]  Well, Alex, you know, throwing a cinder block to a drowning child is something.
[01:32:54.684 --> 01:32:54.944]  Yes.
[01:32:55.004 --> 01:32:56.204]  But it's the wrong thing.
[01:32:56.424 --> 01:32:57.604]  We don't need to do something.
[01:32:57.624 --> 01:32:59.404]  We need to do the right thing.
[01:33:05.065 --> 01:33:07.726]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.645 --> 01:33:16.046]  We're now witnessing the birth pangs of a sexual reformation.
[01:33:16.086 --> 01:33:32.890]  The fallout from the sex abuse scandals that have plagued the entertainment industry, politics, and are now spreading throughout society as a whole is being hijacked by the far left, cultural Marxists, feminists, and social justice warriors to whip up more misandry and create more gender division.
[01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:37.511]  Third wave feminism has been largely discredited over the past five years.
[01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:42.092]  Just 18% of women in the US now identify as feminist.
[01:33:42.412 --> 01:33:44.053]  Even less in the UK.
[01:33:44.113 --> 01:33:45.253]  And it's obvious why.
[01:33:45.433 --> 01:33:51.996]  Now that rights which actual feminists fought for a hundred years ago have been achieved, they're left with what?
[01:33:52.116 --> 01:33:55.537]  Making sourdough bread out of their vaginal yeast.
[01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:56.737]  Yeah, really.
[01:33:56.797 --> 01:34:02.840]  While it's sorely needed in the Islamic world, the West needs feminism like a fish needs a bicycle.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:11.583]  Which is why third-wave feminists and social justice warriors need to constantly invent or hijack new outrages to push their primary narrative.
[01:34:11.903 --> 01:34:12.724]  Hating men.
[01:34:12.804 --> 01:34:22.873]  Which is why they're now hijacking the moral panic surrounding the sex abuse scandal in a desperate effort to resurrect the failed ideology of third-wave feminism.
[01:34:22.973 --> 01:34:29.718]  As part of a catastrophically damaging plan to impose a new, onerous form of sexual puritanism.
[01:34:29.778 --> 01:34:34.242]  The pre-eminence of innocent until proven guilty is being jettisoned.
[01:34:34.362 --> 01:34:38.566]  Now, mere accusation alone is enough to ruin someone's career.
[01:34:38.626 --> 01:34:41.047]  Do you understand how dangerous that is?
[01:34:41.187 --> 01:34:48.929]  Roy Moore has vehemently denied the allegations against him, but to the baying mob, allegations are all that's required to pass judgement.
[01:34:48.989 --> 01:34:55.831]  Now don't get me wrong, if sexual abuse is admitted or proven, these people should be punished to the full extent of the law.
[01:34:55.851 --> 01:35:03.333]  And as my regular viewers will know, I've been the most vehement out of anyone calling for Hollywood and political pedo rings to be exposed.
[01:35:03.373 --> 01:35:07.354]  But trial by social media mob outrage isn't justice.
[01:35:07.574 --> 01:35:09.315]  And it sets a horrific precedent.
[01:35:09.455 --> 01:35:17.521]  Everything is being conflated to the point where making a pass at a woman is placed in the same context as actual sexual assault.
[01:35:17.581 --> 01:35:26.587]  As Laura Prendergast writes in The Spectator, women are jumping on the hashtag MeToo bandwagon so they can smother themselves in attention-seeking victimhood.
[01:35:26.627 --> 01:35:31.711]  Not because they're actual victims, but in one case, because a man looked at them.
[01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:36.394]  Another storm was whipped up over Adam Sandler touching a woman's knee on a talk show.
[01:35:36.994 --> 01:35:42.338]  So I took my parents, just like you.
[01:35:42.418 --> 01:35:47.861]  In another instance, an MP was outed after he called a woman attractive, intelligent, and charming.
[01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:51.204]  Another case involved Michael Fallon trying to kiss a woman.
[01:35:51.304 --> 01:35:59.489]  No, there's a world of difference between looking at someone, complimenting them, trying to kiss them, trying to touch them on the knee, and raping them.
[01:35:59.909 --> 01:36:00.810]  Big difference!
[01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:07.337]  As a result of the comparatively innocuous allegations against him, Carl Sargent committed suicide.
[01:36:15.947 --> 01:36:21.729]  You can't make the cost of sexual interest not being reciprocated the complete ruination of a man's career, his reputation, and even his life.
[01:36:41.516 --> 01:36:47.640]  You can't brand someone who sent a risque text or made a clumsy advance a pervert or a molester.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:52.663]  There has to be a clear distinction between that and actual sexual assault.
[01:36:52.703 --> 01:36:56.946]  There has to be an understanding that accusation alone isn't proof.
[01:36:57.066 --> 01:37:03.530]  We have to put a check on this cult of instantly believing the accuser without any regard for evidence.
[01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:05.031]  Any woman who reports
[01:37:05.971 --> 01:37:09.774]  An assault should be heard and believed.
[01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:16.398]  The new feminist crusade is about indoctrinating women to advocate victimhood rather than equality.
[01:37:16.458 --> 01:37:23.183]  The hysteria of widespread sexual assault is moving us back to a chaperone culture, a modesty culture.
[01:37:23.223 --> 01:37:30.044]  From proposals to segregate trains, to banning scantily clad women in advertisements, to modesty wear on catwalks.
[01:37:30.164 --> 01:37:34.885]  The irony is that we're moving closer to how Islamic societies treat women.
[01:37:35.105 --> 01:37:38.286]  We're mimicking the most misogynistic places on earth.
[01:37:38.306 --> 01:37:52.169]  And what pisses me off the most is that these same feminists, now hijacking this scandal to legitimize their crusade against straight white men, have for years now ignored the fact that we're importing a real rape culture
[01:37:52.429 --> 01:37:59.875]  In the form of mass Islamic immigration, a policy that has resulted in women being molested en masse on numerous different occasions.
[01:37:59.935 --> 01:38:06.480]  Cologne, Germany, where large crowds of what police describe as Arab men began sexually assaulting terrified young women.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.624]  Dozens of men surrounded her and her female friends, touching them everywhere.
[01:38:10.704 --> 01:38:15.588]  Sex attacks by migrants against women in multiple European countries are skyrocketing.
[01:38:15.608 --> 01:38:17.249]  What did feminists have to say about that?
[01:38:17.609 --> 01:38:18.109]  Nothing!
[01:38:18.349 --> 01:38:27.712]  In Cologne, feminists responded to the mass molestation of women by migrants on New Year's Eve 2015 by visiting the local migrant center and handing out roses.
[01:38:27.912 --> 01:38:30.253]  Something sinister is happening.
[01:38:30.353 --> 01:38:38.275]  Whereas the rules and dogma of sexual morality were once enforced by religious groups, they're now being enforced by feminists.
[01:38:38.375 --> 01:38:42.576]  This is a sexual counter-revolution, and sex-negative feminists
[01:38:42.976 --> 01:38:44.398]  Are the new Puritans.
[01:38:44.498 --> 01:38:51.445]  Young men in the West have already had their confidence decimated by years of being hectored about toxic masculinity.
[01:38:51.505 --> 01:38:56.571]  Years of lies and smears about a college rape culture that was completely exaggerated.
[01:38:56.651 --> 01:39:02.517]  Many young men are now growing up terrified of even approaching women for fear of being seen as predatory.
[01:39:02.577 --> 01:39:09.064]  This actually serves to fuel the online hookup culture, where mindless sex is understood as the common outcome.
[01:39:09.084 --> 01:39:14.389]  But it's ultimately disastrous for stable, strong, long-lasting relationships.
[01:39:14.469 --> 01:39:19.895]  Men are being lectured like little boys born with original sin about what behaviours are acceptable.
[01:39:19.935 --> 01:39:22.698]  Case in point, this article, 20 Things Men Can Do.
[01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:28.324]  Right the fuck now to support women beyond just literally ceasing to sexually harass us.
[01:39:28.404 --> 01:39:37.514]  This feminist just brazenly exploits the whole MeToo hashtag outpouring to demand all men become deranged social justice warriors to make up for it.
[01:39:37.654 --> 01:39:38.715]  Support abortion.
[01:39:38.995 --> 01:39:39.476]  Shut up.
[01:39:39.816 --> 01:39:41.839]  Stop watching non-ethical porn.
[01:39:42.079 --> 01:39:43.501]  Support Black Lives Matter.
[01:39:43.702 --> 01:39:46.966]  Don't use pejorative terms like SJW and Feminazi.
[01:39:47.006 --> 01:39:48.448]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:39:48.489 --> 01:39:51.393]  You don't want to be like all those evil sexual abusers, do you?
[01:39:51.673 --> 01:39:55.478]  Oh well, you better sign on to all my demented far-left political beliefs then.
[01:39:55.539 --> 01:39:55.659]  No.
[01:39:55.959 --> 01:39:58.220]  Go fuck yourself, that's not gonna happen.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:03.722]  As Douglas Murray writes, this isn't a guide to helping men, it's a manifesto for torturing them.
[01:40:03.762 --> 01:40:09.545]  Feminist Lindy West was given a platform by the New York Times to make the same twisted argument.
[01:40:09.605 --> 01:40:15.307]  Men are evil and sexist and they need to repent by embracing all my political viewpoints.
[01:40:15.407 --> 01:40:17.628]  Men 1963 to 2016, why are feminists such man-haters?
[01:40:17.668 --> 01:40:17.848]  Men 2017.
[01:40:19.429 --> 01:40:19.569]  Oh.
[01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:20.910]  You see what they're trying to do, right?
[01:40:20.971 --> 01:40:29.598]  Men are being browbeaten into accepting blame for the entirety of the sexual abuse scandal just because they happen to have the same genitals as the abusers.
[01:40:29.758 --> 01:40:30.499]  The question is not...
[01:40:31.877 --> 01:40:32.578]  Are we sexist?
[01:40:32.638 --> 01:40:32.838]  It is.
[01:40:32.898 --> 01:40:34.480]  Do we know that we are sexist?
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.402]  We are all complicit in this as men.
[01:40:36.462 --> 01:40:36.642]  No.
[01:40:36.862 --> 01:40:42.108]  All men are not complicit, you collectivist piece of s**t. I'm not complicit in Louis C.K.
[01:40:42.148 --> 01:40:43.609]  masturbating in front of women.
[01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:46.332]  I'm not complicit in Harvey Weinstein groping women.
[01:40:46.392 --> 01:40:49.595]  I'm not complicit in Kevin Spacey sexually molesting boys.
[01:40:49.755 --> 01:40:51.057]  And neither are all men.
[01:40:51.297 --> 01:40:54.940]  The vast majority of men have never done anything like that and never will.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:05.028]  Why are all men being blamed when the real blame should lie at the feet of those within these industries who covered up and turned a blind eye to what they knew was going on for decades?
[01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:10.473]  And isn't it interesting how we're being told to hyper-focus on certain people and not others?
[01:41:12.704 --> 01:41:19.668]  Look, when you castigate an entire gender for the actions of a relative few, you don't create more respect for women.
[01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:23.351]  You create resentment and more division between the sexes.
[01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:30.475]  You create hypocritical, virtue-signaling, soyboy male feminists who invariably turn out to be abusers of women.
[01:41:30.695 --> 01:41:38.480]  Having lectured us for years about how misogynistic we are, this whole hysteria is being exploited by postmodernists to resurrect the idea that men
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:46.286]  The patriarchy, and ultimately the capitalist system itself, is a perverse architecture of oppression that needs to be torn down.
[01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.327]  Let's not be naive.
[01:41:47.667 --> 01:41:49.049]  Sexual abuse is abhorrent.
[01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:54.173]  But if you're going to claim that some women don't sleep their way to the top, you're a liar.
[01:41:54.313 --> 01:41:56.655]  Sorry if that offends you, but it's true.
[01:41:56.915 --> 01:41:58.997]  And it doesn't mean that all women are sluts.
[01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:04.021]  It's also true that some men abuse their power to bully women into sex.
[01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:07.484]  But that doesn't mean that all men are would-be rapists.
[01:42:07.604 --> 01:42:12.049]  Fact is, power is an aphrodisiac, and a lot of women throw themselves at powerful men.
[01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:18.075]  This leads powerful men to believe that they can just have any woman, and that's when they run into trouble.
[01:42:18.135 --> 01:42:18.315]  Men.
[01:42:19.059 --> 01:42:20.059]  Don't be dicks.
[01:42:20.339 --> 01:42:22.260]  Don't shout at women in the streets.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.520]  Don't invade their personal space.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.481]  Don't treat them like idiots.
[01:42:26.601 --> 01:42:27.701]  Respect women.
[01:42:27.801 --> 01:42:38.144]  But equally, don't self-castrate just because you've been told to feel guilty by some fat control freak feminist about something Harvey Weinstein did that's got nothing to do with you.
[01:42:38.204 --> 01:42:39.604]  Don't adopt far-left
[01:42:39.764 --> 01:42:47.332]  Political views are some twisted form of reparations just to satisfy some autistically screeching social justice warrior.
[01:42:47.372 --> 01:42:49.774]  Don't feel ashamed of your masculinity.
[01:42:49.954 --> 01:42:52.117]  Don't allow your confidence to be shattered.
[01:42:52.177 --> 01:42:59.885]  Don't accept any form of collectivism that demonizes an entire gender for the actions of a relative few.
[01:43:06.004 --> 01:43:12.947]  Worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:44:45.806 --> 01:44:49.227]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[01:44:49.667 --> 01:44:50.387]  It is an act of war.
[01:44:50.807 --> 01:44:52.608]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:58.409]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:45:03.962 --> 01:45:04.843]  Let's talk to Danny.
[01:45:04.883 --> 01:45:05.744]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[01:45:05.764 --> 01:45:06.445]  You're on the air, Danny.
[01:45:06.846 --> 01:45:07.086]  Hi.
[01:45:07.166 --> 01:45:12.152]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:12.493]  Thank you.
[01:45:12.513 --> 01:45:21.484]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[01:45:21.584 --> 01:45:34.654]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[01:45:34.714 --> 01:45:44.001]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[01:45:44.402 --> 01:45:48.585]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[01:45:49.225 --> 01:45:51.047]  And it reboots itself.
[01:45:51.127 --> 01:45:53.549]  So, I mean, think about that.
[01:45:53.949 --> 01:46:05.418]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[01:46:05.498 --> 01:46:06.219]  Let me be clear.
[01:46:06.339 --> 01:46:13.505]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on biopQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[01:46:14.165 --> 01:46:19.853]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back, it may hurt worse for a while.
[01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:23.398]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[01:46:23.758 --> 01:46:26.422]  I took DNA for a few months, it came back, sort of tingling.
[01:46:26.762 --> 01:46:27.743]  The feeling is back.
[01:46:27.904 --> 01:46:31.228]  So it doesn't grow telomeres, it keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[01:46:31.468 --> 01:46:41.932]  Yes, and I mean the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[01:46:41.992 --> 01:46:44.233]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[01:46:44.293 --> 01:46:46.493]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[01:46:46.553 --> 01:46:49.494]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[01:46:49.534 --> 01:46:51.415]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[01:46:51.435 --> 01:46:56.417]  We run in like six months and free shipping, store wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:17.043]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.024 --> 01:47:28.666]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.326 --> 01:47:33.107]  I'm asking the listeners and viewers of this transmission,
[01:47:34.468 --> 01:47:48.984]  To do something that I myself forget to do often, and that's to really sit back and look at the world and think of where we were just five years ago versus where we are today.
[01:47:50.956 --> 01:47:56.179]  If you talked about world government or the EU army, they would say you were insane it didn't exist.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:02.183]  If you talked about the private Federal Reserve, they would either say the Federal Reserve doesn't exist or that it's public.
[01:48:02.664 --> 01:48:06.546]  Now everyone knows it's private and running the government.
[01:48:09.148 --> 01:48:20.055]  And now anyone who is halfway informed knows that President Trump is taking control away from these multinational groups and has killed the TPP and brought sovereignty back.
[01:48:21.087 --> 01:48:24.728]  But Trump is only one manifestation of this global awakening.
[01:48:25.228 --> 01:48:39.152]  You are the heart, the blood, the guts, the bones, the sweat, the tears, the eyes, the legs, the feet, the arms, but most importantly, the soul of humanity.
[01:48:39.552 --> 01:48:40.312]  You are humanity.
[01:48:41.172 --> 01:48:48.034]  And Hollywood and the globalists have done everything they can to try to poison humanity and to try to turn us against each other.
[01:48:49.343 --> 01:48:53.185]  But more and more people are coming out of their trance and they're seeing through it.
[01:48:54.105 --> 01:49:03.909]  When I say humanity is at a critical, determinative crossroads, all of you instinctively already know it to be true.
[01:49:04.869 --> 01:49:15.474]  I'm only saying things that you already know at your gut level, at a spiritual level, at an economic level, at an intellectual level.
[01:49:16.809 --> 01:49:18.449]  And so we know what's happening.
[01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:20.030]  We understand what's going on.
[01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:40.295]  And the globalists have now gone from denying their global program, to now having to admit their program, which is a very austere, anti-human, neo-feudalistic, artificial dark age, meant to suppress technological development,
[01:49:41.877 --> 01:49:44.860]  And economic development for aspiring humans.
[01:49:45.741 --> 01:49:48.204]  It is the ultimate class system.
[01:49:48.624 --> 01:49:53.209]  Assaulting language, assaulting families, assaulting fathers, assaulting mothers.
[01:49:53.309 --> 01:49:54.811]  It is clearly
[01:49:56.246 --> 01:50:14.424]  And admittedly, a cold-blooded scientific takeover system meant to destabilize humanity, poison humanity, dumb humanity down, and then phase us out through slow motion, soft kill, population reduction.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:21.606]  And that's really the overriding message here, that this is a fight for our lives.
[01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:25.589]  This is a life-and-death struggle against the globalists.
[01:50:25.749 --> 01:50:32.035]  And we all need to just continually reassess the fact that we have a purpose-driven life.
[01:50:32.936 --> 01:50:40.863]  And the purpose-driven life is to be strong, to stand up for what's right, to build a better future for our children, and a better world for all our children to live together in.
[01:50:40.883 --> 01:50:52.992]  And if that's the case, then we have to focus on the technocracy and what their goal is, and we have to face the true horrors of the program if we're ever going to have a chance to beat it.
[01:50:53.653 --> 01:50:54.554]  But the good news is,
[01:50:56.032 --> 01:51:15.980]  Despite the fact that this program is so incredibly evil and people had trouble believing it was real, now that it's been forced out in the open, humanity is assessing the crisis and assessing the obstacles and very, very quickly developing systems and mass movements based on individual action that will bring this technocracy down.
[01:51:17.264 --> 01:51:20.585]  The social engineers of the New World Order want you to live in a haze.
[01:51:20.665 --> 01:51:21.665]  They want you to sleep.
[01:51:22.165 --> 01:51:26.306]  They want to be able to engineer your life and use you as a human resource cog.
[01:51:28.047 --> 01:51:32.208]  And as humanity awakens, they are intensifying their propaganda.
[01:51:32.228 --> 01:51:34.548]  They're intensifying their cultural war.
[01:51:34.829 --> 01:51:44.111]  They're intensifying their sabotage with electromagnetic radiation and toxins in the food and water in an attempt to bully you back into submission.
[01:51:45.845 --> 01:52:10.032]  So I ask you now to reflect on the fact of how important you are and how incredibly central it is that you redouble your efforts to spread the word and to speak out and to take action and to expose the globalists, but to also then offer a better system, which is the classic Americana
[01:52:11.414 --> 01:52:15.197]  Judeo-Christian ethos that has made us so successful.
[01:52:15.938 --> 01:52:24.285]  But if we're going to preserve our Republic and preserve our planet and have a way forward into all the incredible things that we're already discovering.
[01:52:25.728 --> 01:52:41.417]  We're going to have to admit to ourselves that the globalists are here, that they don't intend in cohabitating with us, and that they want to reduce world population forcibly so that they can inherit the Earth and all the spoils for themselves.
[01:52:42.057 --> 01:52:44.919]  And that doesn't mean that we aren't overpopulated in some areas.
[01:52:44.939 --> 01:52:48.941]  It doesn't mean that humanity isn't fallen and, quite frankly, disgusting in many ways.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:53:03.748]  It's simply realizing that the very worst of us are the ones that realize this and are taking advantage of the weakness to get full control when those are the very types of people that have already engineered the system
[01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:08.900]  To make the public servile, wicked, corrupt, stupid and lazy.
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:23.187]  The very worst of us are opportunistically making the crises as bad as they can and getting powerful and wealthy off of it at the expense of all of humanity and all the life on the planet and us individually.
[01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:26.639]  That's why we must oppose Hollywood.
[01:53:26.839 --> 01:53:28.400]  We must oppose the big central banks.
[01:53:28.661 --> 01:53:31.263]  We must oppose the communist systems in China.
[01:53:31.483 --> 01:53:33.044]  We must oppose the New World Order.
[01:53:33.284 --> 01:53:35.466]  We must empower humanity again.
[01:53:35.726 --> 01:53:38.248]  We must promote systems that make families strong again.
[01:53:38.569 --> 01:53:41.471]  We must rediscover what makes us strong.
[01:53:41.751 --> 01:53:42.172]  God.
[01:53:42.652 --> 01:53:42.992]  Liberty.
[01:53:43.333 --> 01:53:43.813]  Justice.
[01:53:44.113 --> 01:53:44.514]  Freedom.
[01:53:44.874 --> 01:53:45.434]  Hard work.
[01:53:45.715 --> 01:53:46.195]  Focus.
[01:53:46.575 --> 01:53:46.916]  Truth.
[01:53:47.876 --> 01:53:48.417]  And together.
[01:53:49.861 --> 01:53:52.324]  We can survive and thrive and go to the stars together.
[01:53:53.125 --> 01:53:54.987]  But the globalists want you to believe in a dystopia.
[01:53:55.327 --> 01:53:59.852]  That's why every movie, every show, every system they put out is about a dystopia.
[01:54:00.192 --> 01:54:03.096]  So you accept a nightmare future instead of taking.
[01:54:04.551 --> 01:54:12.155]  The undreamt of amazing future that we can all have together if we are simply strong now and stand up for what's right.
[01:54:12.935 --> 01:54:18.918]  And by the way, the globalists sell the idea that being involved and being passionate is tiring and disempowering.
[01:54:19.338 --> 01:54:20.178]  It's the opposite.
[01:54:20.779 --> 01:54:24.481]  The animating contest of liberty is what will fulfill you.
[01:54:25.181 --> 01:54:29.803]  The journey towards a better world and a better universe is the destination.
[01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:33.545]  Our imperfection is our perfection.
[01:54:34.875 --> 01:54:51.461]  The great arc of human development is the vision in God's mind, but His creatures have free will and must decide to dance to the music He's playing, must decide to accept the world He's offered that we build.
[01:54:55.003 --> 01:54:56.423]  We are God's nanotech.
[01:54:59.204 --> 01:55:02.766]  We can build anything, we can do anything, we're made in His image.
[01:55:04.292 --> 01:55:05.292]  The globalists know that.
[01:55:07.053 --> 01:55:12.655]  They want to hoard that knowledge for themselves and go into the future alone, without us.
[01:55:13.696 --> 01:55:16.557]  So you should know those decisions are being made without you.
[01:55:16.577 --> 01:55:21.899]  And they use terms like conspiracy theory, so that you won't look into it, so you'll be lazy.
[01:55:22.939 --> 01:55:29.062]  Whether it's human-animal chimeras, or human brains in rats we told you about 20 years ago, or fluoride-lowering IQs in babies.
[01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:36.473]  Everything we told you is now being admitted because they can't hide it anymore, because enough people have actually gone out and researched.
[01:55:36.673 --> 01:55:43.755]  We've already reached critical mass to a great extent, and all the pushback we see is the desperate death throes of the globalists.
[01:55:44.936 --> 01:55:51.318]  So again, thank you all for being part of Infowars, and thank you all for standing strong for justice, and thank you all for supporting what we do here.
[01:55:51.559 --> 01:55:59.802]  Because without you, ladies and gentlemen, and without your action, without your will, without your spiritual love of God,
[01:56:01.783 --> 01:56:09.337]  Without your prayers, without your connection, and all of us coming together, we don't have a prayer.
[01:56:10.387 --> 01:56:15.230]  But if we do come together, nothing on earth can stop us, because God will work through us.
[01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:20.474]  I'm Alex Jones for NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:56:21.415 --> 01:56:23.336]  It is an act of rebellion against the globalists.
[01:56:23.416 --> 01:56:29.641]  It is an act of absolute military resistance against their global government operation.
[01:56:30.361 --> 01:56:39.228]  When you spread the articles and the videos, and when you pray for us, and when you tell your friends, family, and neighbors about the different ways they can tune in, and when you financially support us.
[01:56:40.999 --> 01:56:43.160]  Everything I do is a non-zero-sum game.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.461]  Everything I stand for is a total win-win.
[01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:53.304]  Everything I am promoting is about a future for me, my children, and that means your children, in a world together.
[01:56:56.225 --> 01:57:02.508]  Do unto others as you'd have do unto you is simply common sense to have a civilization.
[01:57:03.508 --> 01:57:06.750]  There have been people that have been using the fact that we're good against us
[01:57:07.964 --> 01:57:13.366]  And now they've tried to bully us into submission through political correctness to tell us that we're actually the bad people.
[01:57:15.267 --> 01:57:16.648]  The New World Order's already fallen.
[01:57:17.368 --> 01:57:18.288]  It knows it's fallen.
[01:57:18.869 --> 01:57:24.631]  It believes if it can take you down and sit on a mountain of your skulls, that it will become God.
[01:57:25.952 --> 01:57:31.734]  When all they ever had to do was reach out, and they would touch God the moment they opened the door.
[01:57:32.734 --> 01:57:35.976]  But they can't open the door, because they're of their father, the devil.
[01:57:37.153 --> 01:57:40.198]  And all those that hate me love death, Christ said.
[01:57:56.331 --> 01:57:57.252]  Let's talk to Danny.
[01:57:57.272 --> 01:57:58.133]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[01:57:58.153 --> 01:57:58.834]  You're on the air, Danny.
[01:57:59.235 --> 01:57:59.475]  Hi.
[01:57:59.555 --> 01:58:04.561]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[01:58:04.581 --> 01:58:04.902]  Thank you.
[01:58:04.922 --> 01:58:13.893]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[01:58:13.973 --> 01:58:19.577]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that.
[01:58:19.677 --> 01:58:27.042]  But the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[01:58:27.102 --> 01:58:36.388]  I haven't found anything in my 20, over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[01:58:36.808 --> 01:58:40.971]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:43.433]  And it reboots itself.
[01:58:43.533 --> 01:58:45.935]  So, I mean, think about that.
[01:58:46.355 --> 01:58:57.824]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[01:58:57.904 --> 01:58:58.605]  Let me be clear.
[01:58:58.725 --> 01:59:05.871]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:08.492]  It regenerates nerves in some cases.
[01:59:08.532 --> 01:59:11.333]  So an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[01:59:11.393 --> 01:59:12.233]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[01:59:12.533 --> 01:59:15.774]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[01:59:16.114 --> 01:59:17.495]  I took DNA for it for a few months.
[01:59:17.615 --> 01:59:18.155]  It came back.
[01:59:18.255 --> 01:59:18.795]  Sort of tingling.
[01:59:19.115 --> 01:59:20.116]  The feeling is back.
[01:59:20.276 --> 01:59:21.956]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[01:59:22.036 --> 01:59:23.577]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[01:59:23.857 --> 01:59:34.322]  Yes, and I mean the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[01:59:34.382 --> 01:59:36.603]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[01:59:36.683 --> 01:59:38.884]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[01:59:38.944 --> 01:59:41.886]  Each person's different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[01:59:41.926 --> 01:59:43.806]  But we're running the biggest specials.
[01:59:43.826 --> 01:59:48.789]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:00:34.039 --> 02:00:42.524]  We've got coming up in the next segment, a great American patriot and great UFC fighter in Green Beret, Tim Kennedy, whose third season of Hunting Hitler is about to air.
[02:00:42.544 --> 02:00:50.589]  He can't give us the secrets, but he says these new data dumps in the JFK files by Trump showing Hitler still alive in Argentina in 1955, it dovetails with that.
[02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:51.169]  That's coming up.
[02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:54.832]  But we were talking during the break, and I want to have you back anytime.
[02:00:54.892 --> 02:00:55.812]  I mean, you just come down here.
[02:00:55.932 --> 02:00:58.474]  We'd love to have you contribute your own podcasts.
[02:00:58.494 --> 02:00:59.795]  Hope you co-host new shows with us.
[02:01:00.135 --> 02:01:02.636]  We're going to go 24 hours a day very, very soon, or 20 hours a day.
[02:01:02.936 --> 02:01:03.737]  Just we got to get the crew.
[02:01:04.137 --> 02:01:04.997]  Yeah.
[02:01:05.597 --> 02:01:06.338]  But we're doing that right now.
[02:01:06.358 --> 02:01:07.978]  Within three or four months, we'll be ready.
[02:01:08.758 --> 02:01:11.999]  But just in a few minutes, we have any other points you want to add, other points you want to get to.
[02:01:12.519 --> 02:01:15.460]  And separately, we were talking about what is Antifa?
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:17.440]  You were saying they're like a mind control.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:23.081]  We asked why they're so dumb, why they're so weird, why they act so mentally ill, why they're such bad soldiers.
[02:01:23.621 --> 02:01:26.922]  These are really autistic victims from what we found.
[02:01:26.982 --> 02:01:28.682]  And you were actually on your own saying this.
[02:01:29.203 --> 02:01:30.743]  This is the army of Mordor.
[02:01:31.443 --> 02:01:36.444]  And it makes you feel sad almost for them that we actually care about their future and they hate us.
[02:01:37.284 --> 02:01:38.464]  Can you speak to that what you were saying?
[02:01:38.704 --> 02:01:45.546]  Yeah, basically, you know, what I see is I see a lot of uneducated younger generation that they don't have a leader.
[02:01:45.586 --> 02:01:46.986]  They don't have somebody to follow.
[02:01:47.846 --> 02:01:50.567]  Maybe they don't have a father figure in the house or something like that.
[02:01:50.607 --> 02:01:55.948]  So what they're doing is they're looking to, you know, this this alternative and
[02:01:57.338 --> 02:01:58.859]  They're not being educated.
[02:01:58.879 --> 02:02:04.304]  They're not taking a look at what these other generations have done before them.
[02:02:04.324 --> 02:02:08.328]  We're talking about back in 1917 and so on and so forth, just before the war.
[02:02:11.758 --> 02:02:26.276]  What's happening is, history is repeating itself, and it's going straight back to where it was back then, where you have a generation of people that are uneducated, and I don't mean, you know, they're not learning in school, or they're not smart, they can do electronics.
[02:02:26.557 --> 02:02:28.219]  Historically, they're not street smart.
[02:02:28.459 --> 02:02:39.546]  Right, and they're not looking up what the history is all about, and actually learning what happened in history, and we are destined to repeat the same thing.
[02:02:40.067 --> 02:02:43.289]  And when you approach them and you say, hey, do you know what a Marxist movement is?
[02:02:43.329 --> 02:02:44.190]  Do you know what this is?
[02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:45.030]  Do you know what that is?
[02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:45.991]  They don't even know they're in it!
[02:02:46.651 --> 02:02:48.333]  They don't, and that's the biggest thing.
[02:02:48.353 --> 02:02:53.377]  They're shock troops, Bolshevik Revolution, 100 years later like you said, and they don't even know.
[02:02:53.898 --> 02:03:05.929]  They don't, they don't, and they're being pushed into this because they don't want to look for the information themselves, read about it, understand it, so they're being put into this because one, you know, maybe... Talk about mind control.
[02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:11.034]  They're soldiers for George Soros and the globalists and communists and don't even know it.
[02:03:12.259 --> 02:03:16.323]  Antifa, how can you say you're anti-fascist when you're doing the fascist things?
[02:03:16.363 --> 02:03:17.143]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:03:17.704 --> 02:03:20.727]  Not letting people into the inauguration, beating up women.
[02:03:22.168 --> 02:03:26.612]  And they're doing it every day, and they're accusing us of doing it, but yet they do it every day.
[02:03:26.692 --> 02:03:27.853]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:03:28.273 --> 02:03:37.121]  So when you look at a person like that, you have to say there's some sort of mental instability there for you to even do what you're doing and take the position that you take.
[02:03:39.952 --> 02:03:42.114]  I don't know, obviously we're still winning this fight.
[02:03:42.474 --> 02:03:43.915]  I agree, we're winning intellectually.
[02:03:43.955 --> 02:03:45.076]  What do you think is coming over for it?
[02:03:45.397 --> 02:03:47.919]  They say they're going to kill cops, burn things, blow stuff up.
[02:03:49.248 --> 02:03:50.649]  I think it's going to be a dud, hopefully.
[02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:52.090]  I think it's going to be a dud.
[02:03:52.691 --> 02:04:05.720]  They may stand out there and they may say this, they may say that, but at the end of the day, they're going to cover their face, they're going to bring a couple little sticks with them, and the first time that they throw a punch and everybody else goes after them, they're going to run off.
[02:04:06.061 --> 02:04:07.141]  That's all they're going to do.
[02:04:07.162 --> 02:04:08.182]  Pull the mask off their face.
[02:04:08.583 --> 02:04:09.643]  Pull the mask off their face.
[02:04:09.663 --> 02:04:12.766]  But they'll get some mental patience if they wound up to run somebody over with a car.
[02:04:13.326 --> 02:04:15.488]  That whole thing in Virginia was government run.
[02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:16.348]  Absolutely.
[02:04:17.833 --> 02:04:18.814]  That made no sense.
[02:04:19.094 --> 02:04:23.098]  It just, that whole thing was... Well, the good news is... It's all it is to stir things up.
[02:04:23.138 --> 02:04:24.740]  That's all it is, Alex.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:27.122]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:04:27.802 --> 02:04:29.984]  And you're reaching bigger audiences than ever.
[02:04:30.325 --> 02:04:32.947]  And now they've run you out of your livelihood defending America.
[02:04:33.227 --> 02:04:35.630]  So now you're telling me you're going to be full-time fighting the info war.
[02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.911]  I'm excited, Stephen.
[02:04:36.931 --> 02:04:37.851]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:37.931 --> 02:04:38.692]  Thank you for having me.
[02:04:38.712 --> 02:04:39.392]  Hey, it's great.
[02:04:39.412 --> 02:04:41.193]  They just made another big, giant enemy.
[02:04:41.613 --> 02:04:43.594]  They think your hundreds of millions of views are bad now.
[02:04:43.994 --> 02:04:48.757]  Wait until you're writing books, doing speaking tours, and co-hosting this show with me, along with Tim Kaine and everybody else.
[02:04:49.257 --> 02:04:49.697]  Absolutely.
[02:04:49.838 --> 02:04:50.598]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:50.758 --> 02:04:51.018]  Thank you.
[02:04:51.038 --> 02:04:51.318]  God bless you.
[02:04:51.338 --> 02:04:51.979]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:52.299 --> 02:04:57.742]  All right, that's Stephen Gern, G-E-R-N, Twitter, S-W-G-E-R-N.
[02:04:57.782 --> 02:04:58.482]  Be sure and follow him.
[02:04:58.762 --> 02:05:00.483]  I'm Alex Jones at Real Alex Jones.
[02:05:00.523 --> 02:05:00.984]  We'll be back.
[02:05:01.004 --> 02:05:01.384]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:11.896]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:11.976 --> 02:05:20.222]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:20.382 --> 02:05:25.086]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:25.266 --> 02:05:28.928]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:05:30.129 --> 02:05:39.136]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:39.216 --> 02:05:46.101]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:46.241 --> 02:05:50.604]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:50.745 --> 02:05:53.967]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:05:54.127 --> 02:06:00.249]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:06:00.409 --> 02:06:02.630]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:06.071 --> 02:06:09.772]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours.
[02:06:09.972 --> 02:06:11.213]  Yes, yes.
[02:06:11.433 --> 02:06:14.754]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[02:06:14.974 --> 02:06:15.374]  That's right.
[02:06:17.150 --> 02:06:17.850]  Was it difficult?
[02:06:20.311 --> 02:06:21.431]  Not at all.
[02:06:21.931 --> 02:06:22.551]  Not at all.
[02:06:23.271 --> 02:06:27.132]  Maybe as a child, you don't see the connection.
[02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:29.973]  It created no problem at all.
[02:06:30.053 --> 02:06:30.893]  No feeling of guilt?
[02:06:31.333 --> 02:06:31.493]  No.
[02:06:31.934 --> 02:06:42.276]  Well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[02:06:42.916 --> 02:06:46.117]  Whether I was there or not, the property was being taken away.
[02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:48.909]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:53.921]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:53.941 --> 02:06:56.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:17.739 --> 02:07:19.400]  Get me Roger Stone.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:24.864]  Oh wait, I can't get a hold of Roger Stone because he's been suspended from Twitter.
[02:07:24.884 --> 02:07:26.645]  I'm getting no signal from it, sir.
[02:07:27.771 --> 02:07:36.893]  And SJW trolls have been bragging and fighting over who gets to take credit over Roger Stone being suspended from Twitter.
[02:07:37.073 --> 02:07:44.915]  Now, let's take a look at these controversial tweets that Roger Stone tweeted that landed him in Twitter jail.
[02:07:45.595 --> 02:07:52.957]  At Don Lemon, stop lying about the Clintons and uranium, you ignorant, lying, kaufk sucker.
[02:07:53.277 --> 02:07:56.019]  You fake news, you dumb piece of sh**!
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:11.973]  I picture Roger Stone sitting there, flipping through his television, coming across CNN fake news, and hearing Don Lemon spew more BS and lies, and I think he just really kind of lost it, and just had to give it to him on Twitter.
[02:08:12.193 --> 02:08:25.419]  When AT&T acquires Time Warner, the house cleaning at CNN of human excrement like Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and dumb f*** Anna Navarro will be swift.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:26.320]  But wait!
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:30.822]  It's not like any of these tweets even violate Twitter's rules.
[02:08:31.002 --> 02:08:38.946]  So let's see what these SJWs are bragging about in claiming how they got Roger Stone's Twitter account suspended in the first place.
[02:08:39.286 --> 02:08:55.453]  The first tweet claiming to have taken the great Roger Stone down is by David A. Wood, a snarky, passionate advocate for acceptance, inclusion, and humanitarianism.
[02:08:56.053 --> 02:09:01.876]  I'm sorry, but your description offends me itself, so maybe I should just flag your account right now.
[02:09:02.376 --> 02:09:06.699]  I have reported this tweet, which appears to encourage harm be brought to someone.
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:22.692]  So apparently, encouraging harm to be brought on someone is calling them a pile of human excrement, or a dumb f**k, or a dumb lying piece of s**t. So, calling somebody names you don't like is somehow inciting violence?
[02:09:23.132 --> 02:09:28.575]  It's not like other people aren't calling for Donald Trump's death on a daily basis.
[02:09:28.635 --> 02:09:30.836]  I don't see Twitter suspending their accounts.
[02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.237]  These SJWs are out of control.
[02:09:33.357 --> 02:09:35.958]  Because after all, remember, words are violence!
[02:09:36.238 --> 02:09:41.241]  You know, I don't know about you, but I would rather somebody call me names than punch me in the face.
[02:09:41.421 --> 02:09:52.146]  Then we have an SJW claiming that this troll needs to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize due to the selfless sacrifice you've made here tonight.
[02:09:52.406 --> 02:09:55.828]  This is what happens when every kid gets a trophy in school.
[02:09:56.148 --> 02:09:59.150]  You should get trophies now for being trolls on the internet.
[02:09:59.210 --> 02:10:04.352]  Not for actually, you know, discovering the cure for cancer, creating world peace, no.
[02:10:04.473 --> 02:10:08.255]  Being a troll on the internet, getting Roger Stone kicked off, Nobel Peace Prize for you.
[02:10:08.335 --> 02:10:12.297]  So of course we have other SJWs claiming, I have done the same!
[02:10:12.337 --> 02:10:13.077]  I did too!
[02:10:13.657 --> 02:10:15.038]  Me too!
[02:10:15.378 --> 02:10:15.959]  Ditto!
[02:10:16.781 --> 02:10:18.282]  I reported it as well.
[02:10:18.462 --> 02:10:22.264]  It's full of harassment towards Mr. Lemon.
[02:10:22.284 --> 02:10:27.086]  And I do find it kind of fitting that Don Lemon's last name is a lemon.
[02:10:27.306 --> 02:10:28.566]  Someone sold us a lemon.
[02:10:28.586 --> 02:10:33.889]  Roger is a douchebag and as narcissistic as 45.
[02:10:34.789 --> 02:10:35.669]  But wait a minute.
[02:10:35.869 --> 02:10:43.593]  Isn't calling him a douchebag a sexist, misogynist term that she gets you violated from Twitter yourself?
[02:10:45.377 --> 02:10:47.525]  You did the right thing, David.
[02:10:47.987 --> 02:10:49.553]  Might have saved a life.
[02:10:53.206 --> 02:10:56.828]  I'm sorry, Save the Life, aren't we getting a little bit dramatic?
[02:10:57.248 --> 02:11:00.909]  Dear Netflix, cut your ties with Roger Stone.
[02:11:01.269 --> 02:11:07.712]  I'm closing my account and will not be opening it as long as you're promoting this racist P.O.S.
[02:11:07.872 --> 02:11:16.856]  I'm sorry, but how the heck is Netflix promoting Roger Stone by doing a hit piece propaganda film about him?
[02:11:17.296 --> 02:11:17.877]  But wait!
[02:11:17.997 --> 02:11:24.421]  We have another person letting the original troll know he reported Mr. Stone first.
[02:11:24.842 --> 02:11:26.643]  I reported it before I saw your tweet.
[02:11:26.703 --> 02:11:28.004]  I did it first!
[02:11:28.164 --> 02:11:30.045]  Me, me, me, me, me!
[02:11:30.566 --> 02:11:32.427]  Now this one really takes the cake.
[02:11:33.008 --> 02:11:40.413]  This, again, is from the original troll that decided to take credit for getting Roger Stone suspended from Twitter.
[02:11:40.593 --> 02:11:44.236]  He later tweets, Note to self, don't gloat.
[02:11:44.416 --> 02:11:45.277]  It isn't pretty.
[02:11:45.857 --> 02:11:49.719]  Yes, he has been bombarded with trolls.
[02:11:49.879 --> 02:11:54.022]  We're talking SJW trolls saying, no, I did it first.
[02:11:54.362 --> 02:11:56.163]  I get the Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:11:56.443 --> 02:11:57.864]  I get the trophy.
[02:11:58.104 --> 02:11:59.024]  Hypocrite much?
[02:11:59.585 --> 02:12:01.506]  Double standard much?
[02:12:01.526 --> 02:12:03.267]  Or just liberal logic?
[02:12:07.825 --> 02:12:16.448]  Alright, for the rest of the hour, Tim Kennedy, my good buddy, Green Beret, Patriot, UFC fighter, talk show host, host of The Investigator on Hunting Hitler, is with us.
[02:12:16.788 --> 02:12:21.669]  And I was trying to get him on a month ago about Hunting Hitler, as the third season was coming out, and he said, uh, you know, I gotta wait.
[02:12:21.729 --> 02:12:23.930]  But then, this weekend, I'm on his Twitter.
[02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:31.194]  And I'm on my feet, and I see, okay, I didn't read these new documents out of the JFK stuff, and sure enough, I went to the National Archives, there it was.
[02:12:31.755 --> 02:12:36.078]  Hitler in 55, photographed in Argentina, like everybody always said.
[02:12:36.418 --> 02:12:42.622]  They found the witnesses, the old submarine, German mansions built in the middle of mountains.
[02:12:43.623 --> 02:12:44.183]  I mean, wow.
[02:12:44.223 --> 02:12:45.724]  Now, you can't tell us the new stuff.
[02:12:46.165 --> 02:12:50.768]  This is a short segment, but coming up, you're telling me, Tim Kennedy, this he is dead on.
[02:12:51.408 --> 02:12:53.049]  Yeah, we've known it for a long time.
[02:12:53.289 --> 02:12:57.131]  People suspected it, but we have real evidence.
[02:12:57.572 --> 02:12:59.813]  You cannot deny the proof that we've found.
[02:13:00.113 --> 02:13:02.695]  You can't deny the documents that are being released.
[02:13:02.935 --> 02:13:04.916]  So third season is the total money shot?
[02:13:05.635 --> 02:13:06.175]  Of a hit show.
[02:13:06.455 --> 02:13:09.897]  We found things that people have been looking for for 75 years.
[02:13:10.678 --> 02:13:12.159]  And we found actual evidence.
[02:13:12.179 --> 02:13:14.180]  You found the submarine and all the rest of it.
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:19.122]  I mean, a real U-boat with the capabilities of transporting high-value targets.
[02:13:19.142 --> 02:13:20.043]  But there's Germans everywhere.
[02:13:20.083 --> 02:13:21.564]  I mean, a lot of them did go over there.
[02:13:21.584 --> 02:13:23.505]  We had the Operation Paperclip here.
[02:13:23.525 --> 02:13:24.425]  Yeah, we...
[02:13:25.826 --> 02:13:28.888]  Fascists, the enemy of our friend, or the what?
[02:13:29.068 --> 02:13:30.909]  How does it go?
[02:13:31.749 --> 02:13:33.110]  Our friend's enemy is our friend?
[02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:35.931]  Yes, yes, it's the enemy of my enemy, my friend.
[02:13:35.971 --> 02:13:36.431]  Yeah, there we go.
[02:13:37.192 --> 02:13:38.032]  We hated socialism.
[02:13:38.152 --> 02:13:38.933]  We hated communism.
[02:13:39.093 --> 02:13:39.513]  I still do.
[02:13:40.313 --> 02:13:46.556]  And in the South, we found that fascism was an opportunity to fight communism growing in Venezuela and Argentina.
[02:13:47.157 --> 02:13:50.779]  So these fascist dictators, we maybe even helped.
[02:13:51.119 --> 02:13:53.040]  And we found real evidence of
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.182]  What they're doing and how they're doing it is frightening.
[02:13:56.923 --> 02:13:57.423]  Incredible.
[02:13:57.523 --> 02:13:59.465]  But I mean, how is it, honey?
[02:13:59.485 --> 02:14:00.566]  Hitler comes out a few years ago.
[02:14:00.586 --> 02:14:02.708]  It's a top show on History Channel.
[02:14:03.048 --> 02:14:06.772]  And then now, right as it's about to come out, CIA files as he tried to block.
[02:14:07.132 --> 02:14:08.653]  Hitler was alive down there.
[02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:12.076]  Do you have any idea how old he was when he died or where he may be buried?
[02:14:14.082 --> 02:14:18.786]  Well first of all, thanks for the CIA for releasing that 30 days before the TV show comes out.
[02:14:18.886 --> 02:14:20.808]  That's fantastic work.
[02:14:20.868 --> 02:14:23.010]  I had all totals to do with that.
[02:14:24.311 --> 02:14:29.016]  Whether he died in that bunker or where he didn't, we took a different approach for this season.
[02:14:29.376 --> 02:14:34.320]  We did the exact same thing that everybody's done in the past 10 years searching for terrorists.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.905]  The way that we caught Bin Laden, the way that we caught Zarqawi, we looked at their network.
[02:14:40.666 --> 02:14:46.608]  We followed the information, the trails and the evidence of the people that were facilitating these high-level Nazis.
[02:14:47.108 --> 02:14:51.730]  Guys like Skorzenski, guys like Joseph Mengele.
[02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.110]  Klaus Barbie.
[02:14:53.330 --> 02:14:54.771]  Yeah, Klaus Barbie, perfect example.
[02:14:55.211 --> 02:15:04.033]  We trailed those guys from where they left Germany, how they came into Argentina, where they lived, who was in charge, and by that we brought in this girl Nadia.
[02:15:04.454 --> 02:15:04.894]  She was
[02:15:05.894 --> 02:15:06.354]  Crucial.
[02:15:06.514 --> 02:15:14.360]  She is one of the most important CIA targeters that worked in finding Bin Laden and finding Zarqawi that brought down the Al Qaeda network in 2006.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:23.186]  We brought her in specifically to do targeting for these Nazis in the 40s and the 50s and even into the 60s and 70s in South America.
[02:15:23.206 --> 02:15:24.107]  And we
[02:15:25.573 --> 02:15:27.735]  But that makes sense now that I think about it.
[02:15:28.275 --> 02:15:31.477]  Look for other Nazis and then track back where they came from.
[02:15:31.817 --> 02:15:33.759]  That's going to find where Hitler at least landed.
[02:15:33.779 --> 02:15:35.400]  Then you can try to track where he went.
[02:15:36.381 --> 02:15:38.522]  Yeah, you can't just look for the man.
[02:15:38.582 --> 02:15:39.743]  The man disappeared.
[02:15:39.803 --> 02:15:41.664]  South America is a massive, beautiful country.
[02:15:42.005 --> 02:15:49.370]  And when you got Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Brazil, all of them friendly to fascism, to Nazis on the run.
[02:15:49.390 --> 02:15:51.251]  It's like trying to find a needle in a whole continent.
[02:15:51.451 --> 02:15:57.394]  Yeah, but we just took the whole entire haystack, we burnt that to the ground, and then we just picked up that nice little piece of metal and said, got you.
[02:15:58.055 --> 02:16:01.396]  Wow, we'll be right back with Tim Kennedy, Hunting Hitler Season 3.
[02:16:02.877 --> 02:16:12.683]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[02:16:13.543 --> 02:16:16.505]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist,
[02:16:17.429 --> 02:16:22.873]  Controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[02:16:23.273 --> 02:16:26.255]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[02:16:26.856 --> 02:16:36.543]  Clothing is a statement and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[02:16:37.003 --> 02:16:42.207]  So right now folks we're going to debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the Infowars store.
[02:16:43.267 --> 02:16:44.989]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[02:16:45.049 --> 02:16:45.990]  It's a limited edition.
[02:16:46.551 --> 02:16:48.553]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:16:48.793 --> 02:16:55.519]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:00.044]  And on the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[02:17:00.284 --> 02:17:01.765]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[02:17:02.486 --> 02:17:07.851]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[02:17:08.152 --> 02:17:16.940]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[02:17:17.381 --> 02:17:21.525]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[02:17:22.046 --> 02:17:23.127]  And of course this classic?
[02:17:23.667 --> 02:17:24.428]  It says it all.
[02:17:24.528 --> 02:17:25.408]  Need I say more?
[02:17:25.908 --> 02:17:27.509]  You want to have a political message out there?
[02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:33.333]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[02:17:33.653 --> 02:17:36.715]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[02:17:37.195 --> 02:17:42.759]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[02:17:43.499 --> 02:17:45.821]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[02:17:46.142 --> 02:17:54.530]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:58.374]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[02:17:59.194 --> 02:18:08.665]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Lambe, or Come and Take It, in good old-fashioned English, t-shirts.
[02:18:08.805 --> 02:18:11.308]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:13.290]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[02:18:14.031 --> 02:18:15.152]  I designed this baby.
[02:18:15.212 --> 02:18:17.653]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[02:18:18.034 --> 02:18:22.276]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:18:22.677 --> 02:18:26.459]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[02:18:26.939 --> 02:18:29.661]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[02:18:29.681 --> 02:18:31.042]  It's been around about 19 years.
[02:18:31.662 --> 02:18:35.265]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[02:18:35.545 --> 02:18:38.627]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[02:18:39.547 --> 02:18:43.150]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[02:18:43.850 --> 02:18:44.751]  That's disrespectful.
[02:18:44.771 --> 02:18:48.773]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[02:18:48.853 --> 02:18:56.278]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[02:18:56.698 --> 02:18:58.139]  Our republic is in distress.
[02:18:58.619 --> 02:18:59.080]  Ask me why.
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:01.683]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[02:19:01.823 --> 02:19:07.349]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:09.311]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[02:19:09.372 --> 02:19:12.375]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[02:19:12.796 --> 02:19:14.958]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[02:19:15.579 --> 02:19:17.821]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[02:19:18.422 --> 02:19:19.302]  It's all about freedom.
[02:19:19.342 --> 02:19:20.683]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[02:19:21.203 --> 02:19:22.124]  Resist Tyranny.
[02:19:22.764 --> 02:19:23.764]  Made in America.
[02:19:23.784 --> 02:19:23.764]  1776.
[02:19:24.384 --> 02:19:27.486]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[02:19:27.706 --> 02:19:28.666]  The backs are really cool.
[02:19:29.026 --> 02:19:29.687]  Look at that back.
[02:19:29.747 --> 02:19:30.627]  That is pure Americana.
[02:19:31.897 --> 02:19:37.041]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:37.861]  The Dayglo.
[02:19:38.362 --> 02:19:42.425]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[02:19:42.445 --> 02:19:44.226]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[02:19:44.606 --> 02:19:45.927]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[02:19:45.947 --> 02:19:47.188]  It's got the nice patch.
[02:19:47.548 --> 02:19:48.589]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:48.829 --> 02:19:49.710]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:53.393]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[02:19:53.813 --> 02:19:55.394]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[02:19:55.634 --> 02:20:00.137]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:20:04.998 --> 02:20:09.141]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:28.753]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:38.501 --> 02:20:40.642]  Tim Kennedy says the most amazing stuff during the breaks.
[02:20:40.682 --> 02:20:43.403]  We've got to get it repeated now here on air.
[02:20:43.904 --> 02:20:44.504]  Tim Kennedy.
[02:20:44.524 --> 02:20:45.965]  TimKennedyMMA.com.
[02:20:46.305 --> 02:20:47.226]  Twitter Tim Kennedy.
[02:20:47.566 --> 02:20:48.406]  MMA Facebook.
[02:20:48.426 --> 02:20:49.307]  Tim Kennedy MMA.
[02:20:49.867 --> 02:20:50.928]  Doing so much more.
[02:20:51.068 --> 02:20:54.730]  As you said MMA is just one part of the great work you do in the military.
[02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:55.731]  I know it's been in the news.
[02:20:55.771 --> 02:20:56.471]  You've re-enlisted.
[02:20:56.491 --> 02:20:58.772]  I know that's all classified so we can't get into it.
[02:20:58.812 --> 02:21:00.894]  But you're doing a lot of important work.
[02:21:01.852 --> 02:21:05.094]  Probably better you just lead the conversation so I don't get anything secret you're doing.
[02:21:05.414 --> 02:21:22.622]  But right in the middle of it, you're the main investigator of many other great ones on hunting Hitler, right as the CIA files get declassified, partly on Friday, fully on Saturday, saying, okay, Hitler's alive, 1955, here's the photos, here's where he's at, here's what's going on, what do we do?
[02:21:23.022 --> 02:21:23.723]  Nothing happens.
[02:21:23.743 --> 02:21:26.104]  You were telling me during the break why nothing happened.
[02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:28.461]  It's a bummer part.
[02:21:28.481 --> 02:21:34.244]  You know, when you look at Hitler, he's a deplorable, disgusting, evil human that killed millions and millions of people.
[02:21:34.264 --> 02:21:37.085]  You know, 10, 20 million people.
[02:21:37.905 --> 02:21:42.567]  And the acts that he committed, we can't overlook and can never be forgiven.
[02:21:42.587 --> 02:21:44.988]  You know, fascism should never exist in any capacity.
[02:21:46.448 --> 02:21:51.652]  But at the same time, at the end of the war in 1945, there's no question what the next worry was.
[02:21:51.812 --> 02:21:53.633]  The next enemy is going to be communism.
[02:21:54.213 --> 02:21:58.597]  And when you have Mao killing, you know, 45 million people, and then Stalin.
[02:21:59.157 --> 02:22:00.358]  That's conservative, though.
[02:22:00.418 --> 02:22:01.939]  Yeah, the lowest estimates.
[02:22:02.219 --> 02:22:03.359]  That's a monster that's already defeated.
[02:22:03.379 --> 02:22:03.519]  Yeah.
[02:22:03.539 --> 02:22:04.120]  Hitler's gone.
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:04.480]  He's dead.
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:06.760]  Fascism is not going to be rising again, and we know that.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:09.341]  But we know the great threat is now the red threat.
[02:22:09.361 --> 02:22:12.742]  The communist threat that is trying to infiltrate into Asia.
[02:22:12.802 --> 02:22:15.123]  It's trying to make its way into South America.
[02:22:28.607 --> 02:22:30.468]  Already had Hollywood.
[02:22:30.708 --> 02:22:32.148]  Completely by the balls.
[02:22:32.168 --> 02:22:34.229]  It is in North America.
[02:22:34.329 --> 02:22:35.729]  Using Soviet sex operatives.
[02:22:36.209 --> 02:22:43.411]  And we had to fight with the most vicious fire that we could get our hands on, and that was fascism.
[02:22:43.871 --> 02:22:50.533]  And that's why you have the rat line and paperclip, but then Hitler obviously, the really bad ones we know, they actually sent to South America.
[02:22:50.553 --> 02:22:51.774]  They were kind of on their own.
[02:22:51.794 --> 02:22:52.674]  That's what everybody always knew.
[02:22:52.694 --> 02:22:53.554]  They made movies about it.
[02:22:53.794 --> 02:22:55.215]  But to see the rumors true.
[02:22:59.939 --> 02:23:05.664]  Unless I have Hitler's body, I can't say, here's the smoking gun, this is what happened to Adolf Hitler.
[02:23:06.025 --> 02:23:14.253]  What I know is, the high-ranking Nazis made it out of South America, or they made it out of Germany into South America, and in South America, while they were there,
[02:23:14.793 --> 02:23:19.858]  They were being used for a multitude of reasons to include fighting communism and socialism.
[02:23:20.698 --> 02:23:23.901]  And why was it in the JFK files?
[02:23:24.742 --> 02:23:26.924]  Why is anything about Hitler in the JFK files?
[02:23:27.244 --> 02:23:29.706]  Well, the JFK files are fighting communism.
[02:23:29.746 --> 02:23:30.447]  That's what they're about.
[02:23:30.507 --> 02:23:40.516]  If you look at what was happening in Cuba and even maybe the potential assassin, who he was working for, who he was talking to, where he was going to be defecting to, it all comes down to communism.
[02:23:41.216 --> 02:23:50.262]  And Hitler is in those files because he and the rest of the Nazi Party were a great tool in the fight of communism post-World War II.
[02:23:50.762 --> 02:23:51.603]  Fascism's gone.
[02:23:51.883 --> 02:23:52.783]  We defeated the Germans.
[02:23:52.803 --> 02:23:58.367]  And we know deals were almost made at the very end of World War II to actually merge with the Germans and take on the Soviets then.
[02:23:58.707 --> 02:23:59.768]  Patton wanted to do that.
[02:23:59.888 --> 02:24:00.948]  One reason he was assassinated.
[02:24:01.229 --> 02:24:02.970]  Yeah, there's...
[02:24:05.375 --> 02:24:11.823]  1945 was the beginning of our next biggest, greatest war, which we're still fighting now, which is the war against communism, the war against socialism.
[02:24:11.883 --> 02:24:14.707]  And MacArthur wanted to end it a few years later in 1953.
[02:24:14.747 --> 02:24:17.851]  They removed him when he was about to beat the Chinese.
[02:24:18.972 --> 02:24:19.413]  And Korea.
[02:24:19.933 --> 02:24:21.435]  We've never truly defeated...
[02:24:22.336 --> 02:24:25.439]  The Communist ideals, and I don't know for what reason.
[02:24:25.479 --> 02:24:31.564]  We have had multiple opportunities where we could have crushed them, but we just kind of let them exist.
[02:24:32.125 --> 02:24:35.347]  And it perpetuates, I don't know, the war.
[02:24:35.367 --> 02:24:39.051]  And now Antifa is literally... They don't deserve that name, by the way.
[02:24:39.571 --> 02:24:40.752]  Because they're not anti-fascist.
[02:24:40.812 --> 02:24:41.313]  No, they're not.
[02:24:41.393 --> 02:24:41.993]  America was.
[02:24:42.213 --> 02:24:43.154]  Yeah, America is.
[02:24:44.155 --> 02:24:45.056]  Just say America.
[02:24:45.116 --> 02:24:49.300]  If you want to fight fascism, if you want to fight socialism, if you want to fight communism, just say you're American.
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.441]  Because that's what we are.
[02:24:50.461 --> 02:24:51.381]  We don't burn flags.
[02:24:51.722 --> 02:24:54.544]  We don't take a knee when the beautiful national anthem is being played.
[02:24:54.564 --> 02:24:55.485]  We don't ban people's free speech.
[02:24:55.585 --> 02:24:56.666]  We don't wear black uniforms.
[02:24:57.006 --> 02:24:58.167]  That's communism and fascism.
[02:24:59.108 --> 02:25:01.849]  Again, I mean, so obviously they're communists.
[02:25:01.869 --> 02:25:02.630]  They know they're communists.
[02:25:02.890 --> 02:25:04.211]  A lot of them, though, don't even know who they are.
[02:25:04.491 --> 02:25:06.532]  They claim they're going to cause civil war this weekend.
[02:25:06.592 --> 02:25:07.692]  I think it's going to be a dud.
[02:25:08.973 --> 02:25:17.737]  I mean, it's going to be a dud because they're incapable and they're impetuous little children that they have no idea even what they're fighting for or how to fight.
[02:25:17.957 --> 02:25:22.980]  So the fact that they think that they're going to show up and be able to overthrow a government, that there's men like me and there's
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:35.790]  Thousands, tens of thousands of men like me that love America, that are barrel chested freedom fighters, that we think that we're just going to allow you to come on some arbitrary day on November 4th and be like, all right, we're going to get rid of this Pence and Trump group.
[02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:36.630]  Not going to happen.
[02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:37.391]  And that's my next point.
[02:25:37.411 --> 02:25:42.154]  You made a great point in your own words about this Mueller indictment or indictments.
[02:25:43.675 --> 02:25:44.836]  You want to talk about draining the swamp?
[02:25:45.236 --> 02:25:50.118]  Everybody's talking about Mueller and like, oh, this special investigator, he's really pulling the lid off now.
[02:25:50.639 --> 02:25:55.161]  No, everything that he is showing, he is exposing the true corruption.
[02:25:55.281 --> 02:26:07.266]  And the fact that Trump was able to fire this man months after he hired him, realizing that he did not fit in with the values and the ethics and the things that he wants to perpetuate into what is now this beautiful administration.
[02:26:09.407 --> 02:26:15.491]  Mueller's really showing that Podesta and the collusion with the Russians had nothing to do with Trump.
[02:26:15.892 --> 02:26:22.516]  And the fact that he's making these arrests and these indictments are even more supporting what we already know.
[02:26:22.536 --> 02:26:24.677]  Yeah, it's not filing tax forms.
[02:26:25.138 --> 02:26:26.579]  And they call that money laundering.
[02:26:26.859 --> 02:26:36.025]  When he was running whole campaigns in Europe that were pro-America, and then he was the guy that was the paymaster, and then they're claiming those transactions were fraudulent because they didn't file tax forms in the U.S.
[02:26:36.405 --> 02:26:37.646]  when they were foreign tax forms.
[02:26:40.088 --> 02:26:54.746]  Any interaction that or collusion that happened was way before Trump and now the fact that Trump got rid of him before anything ever happened with him is just another indication that there's nothing more that this is gonna be exactly this is their big shot
[02:26:55.447 --> 02:27:03.516]  This is Mueller-headed with everything he's got, and all he's hoping is Manafort and Rich and others get scared and then say, okay, I'll say whatever you want.
[02:27:03.716 --> 02:27:10.744]  Yeah, with what's being revealed about with GPS and Hillary Clinton and what Manafort is coming...
[02:27:11.905 --> 02:27:17.027]  Revealing that there was multiple opportunities for collusion, but none of it had to do with Trump.
[02:27:17.527 --> 02:27:22.928]  All it's doing is exposing all of the other evil things that our politicians were doing.
[02:27:23.008 --> 02:27:38.153]  So this is just a great, I don't know if it's strategic, but it might be a flawless execution on Trump and his administration to really show how dirty and evil and corrupt Hillary and the rest of those administrations and politics were.
[02:27:38.413 --> 02:27:40.775]  You were saying to me during the break, they're kind of draining themselves.
[02:27:41.355 --> 02:27:42.296]  Yeah, inadvertently.
[02:27:42.316 --> 02:27:43.837]  They're like, oh, look what we just found!
[02:27:43.897 --> 02:27:45.038]  We got a great indictment!
[02:27:45.118 --> 02:27:52.605]  It's like, you realize you're blowing the lid off yourself and you're exposing that one Trump- And that's the thing, I don't just put a positive spin on things to feel good.
[02:27:53.125 --> 02:27:54.586]  Everything's starting to go our way.
[02:27:54.666 --> 02:27:55.887]  They act like such buffoons.
[02:27:56.187 --> 02:27:57.468]  They're involved in such corruption.
[02:27:57.709 --> 02:28:00.571]  But I wonder, what's the next level of their temper tantrum?
[02:28:00.591 --> 02:28:01.612]  I don't want to be too confident.
[02:28:02.092 --> 02:28:02.392]  No.
[02:28:03.633 --> 02:28:04.594]  That's a really scary thing.
[02:28:06.806 --> 02:28:09.689]  About Hitler and anti-fascist gun control.
[02:28:09.849 --> 02:28:17.998]  Anytime you want to get an idea about if the government's lying to you or if a group, anyone is lying to you, look at what their narrative is.
[02:28:18.158 --> 02:28:19.220]  Look at what their agenda is.
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:24.645]  Look at what they would need to happen for propaganda purposes and then see how that occurred in the news.
[02:28:27.699 --> 02:28:28.760]  I know governments lie to us.
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:30.200]  Like, we've known it forever.
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:34.002]  We know that Benghazi didn't happen because some guy in Hollywood made a video.
[02:28:34.323 --> 02:28:43.007]  We know that JFK, that communism was involved in his assassination, even though it had been denied for decades.
[02:28:43.268 --> 02:28:43.928]  We know that now.
[02:28:44.528 --> 02:28:51.592]  So, we need to look and say, okay, if there's a reason that they're saying this, if they're trying to draw our attention over here, whether it's a shooting in Las Vegas, whether it's
[02:28:54.671 --> 02:28:56.012]  Riots in the street on November 4th.
[02:28:56.213 --> 02:28:58.054]  It's gonna be for a reason we have to be ready for.
[02:28:58.094 --> 02:29:00.797]  Let's talk about that when we come back on the other side with Jim Kennedy.
[02:29:00.817 --> 02:29:01.257]  Stay with us.
[02:29:02.078 --> 02:29:04.240]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:10.506]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[02:29:10.926 --> 02:29:13.549]  I mean you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[02:29:13.829 --> 02:29:18.170]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:29:18.810 --> 02:29:38.794]  Just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[02:29:39.674 --> 02:29:42.216]  I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[02:29:42.276 --> 02:29:43.978]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[02:29:44.178 --> 02:29:54.005]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:29:54.366 --> 02:29:58.309]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[02:29:59.764 --> 02:30:01.645]  This information being weaponized.
[02:30:01.725 --> 02:30:03.946]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[02:30:04.406 --> 02:30:08.928]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[02:30:09.449 --> 02:30:10.809]  I will not let you down.
[02:30:10.929 --> 02:30:13.831]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:30:14.251 --> 02:30:15.852]  How quickly can you act?
[02:30:16.172 --> 02:30:21.775]  And what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[02:30:23.358 --> 02:30:31.004]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[02:30:40.291 --> 02:30:46.873]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[02:30:47.993 --> 02:30:50.534]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[02:30:50.874 --> 02:30:51.974]  The system self-corrected.
[02:30:52.094 --> 02:30:54.955]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[02:30:54.975 --> 02:30:57.196]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[02:30:58.396 --> 02:30:59.176]  But you saw this?
[02:30:59.396 --> 02:31:00.137]  USA Today.
[02:31:00.557 --> 02:31:01.637]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[02:31:01.817 --> 02:31:04.178]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[02:31:04.238 --> 02:31:05.318]  That man's a threat to this country.
[02:31:05.558 --> 02:31:07.159]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[02:31:07.179 --> 02:31:08.999]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[02:31:09.039 --> 02:31:16.922]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[02:31:16.942 --> 02:31:22.104]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[02:31:25.265 --> 02:31:29.227]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:31:30.307 --> 02:31:31.508]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:31:32.748 --> 02:31:35.531]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[02:31:36.452 --> 02:31:48.463]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[02:31:50.485 --> 02:31:53.647]  Super blue, colloidal silver, fluoride-free mouthwash.
[02:31:54.387 --> 02:31:55.568]  50% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:55.588 --> 02:31:56.348]  Still 50% off.
[02:31:56.668 --> 02:31:59.489]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[02:31:59.509 --> 02:32:01.610]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[02:32:02.191 --> 02:32:03.631]  That's 50% off as well.
[02:32:03.852 --> 02:32:04.472]  Free shipping.
[02:32:04.552 --> 02:32:05.372]  It's got to end.
[02:32:05.752 --> 02:32:09.214]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[02:32:09.494 --> 02:32:11.215]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.
[02:32:11.275 --> 02:32:14.797]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our bestseller, that I personally wear
[02:32:15.277 --> 02:32:16.058]  Around town now.
[02:32:16.118 --> 02:32:17.378]  It's my favorite shirt of all time.
[02:32:17.538 --> 02:32:22.301]  It says, Won't Tread on Me, Infowars.com on the right-hand shoulder of the American flag.
[02:32:22.701 --> 02:32:24.702]  Infowars.com on the back.
[02:32:24.782 --> 02:32:28.124]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[02:32:28.464 --> 02:32:31.206]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake.
[02:32:31.586 --> 02:32:39.770]  Very iconic, with Infowars.com in Dayglo yellow on the back, and Infowars.com with the American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[02:32:39.810 --> 02:32:40.791]  We also have Infowars
[02:32:41.611 --> 02:32:43.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.795 --> 02:33:32.956]  From the front lines.
[02:33:37.201 --> 02:33:39.444]  We have the exclusive on the JFK files.
[02:33:39.464 --> 02:33:42.267]  We have the exclusive on the indictments.
[02:33:45.396 --> 02:33:50.560]  But it's not that we're that good, it's that mainstream media is so horrible, people don't trust them to give them exclusive.
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:34:04.630]  Just briefly, if you want to support the broadcast, we have specials on vitamin D3, winter sun, ending tomorrow 50% off, colloidal silver 50% off, 50% off a bunch of other great products like anthroplex, uh, that's stamina, libido, energy.
[02:34:04.650 --> 02:34:04.910]  Thank you.
[02:34:23.436 --> 02:34:24.576]  We're running this for one month.
[02:34:24.676 --> 02:34:26.557]  Anti-fascist, anti-communist.
[02:34:26.937 --> 02:34:28.578]  Infowars.com.
[02:34:28.878 --> 02:34:31.178]  We'll tell folks they can't see on radio.
[02:34:31.499 --> 02:34:34.299]  Oh yeah, so it's an anti-fascist and an anti-communist shirt.
[02:34:34.319 --> 02:34:38.401]  So I'm just pro-America, which means I'm pretty much all against everything else.
[02:34:38.481 --> 02:34:40.501]  Exactly, but it looks like the Antifa logo.
[02:34:40.581 --> 02:34:41.302]  Yeah, it does.
[02:34:41.462 --> 02:34:42.582]  So it's going to really trigger them.
[02:34:42.722 --> 02:34:44.703]  Yeah, I love triggering them.
[02:34:45.103 --> 02:34:46.103]  So that's only one month.
[02:34:46.203 --> 02:34:47.784]  Infowars.com.
[02:34:48.224 --> 02:34:49.484]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:34:49.524 --> 02:34:51.485]  Take advantage of those specials.
[02:34:51.525 --> 02:34:51.705]  Tim?
[02:34:52.924 --> 02:34:53.725]  I asked you during the break.
[02:34:54.086 --> 02:34:55.347]  Third season of Hunting Hitler.
[02:34:55.407 --> 02:34:56.689]  You can't give me any secrets.
[02:34:57.210 --> 02:34:58.972]  You were down there for months shooting this.
[02:34:59.673 --> 02:35:00.775]  And jungles, you name it.
[02:35:00.875 --> 02:35:07.443]  Just the other seasons, finding the U-boats and finding these big German mansions in the middle of these gorgeous mountains.
[02:35:08.124 --> 02:35:10.927]  And people saying, yes, Hitler's here in underground bunkers.
[02:35:11.027 --> 02:35:12.969]  And we know a bunch of Nazis ran there.
[02:35:12.989 --> 02:35:15.010]  We know 36,000 came to the U.S.
[02:35:15.050 --> 02:35:17.373]  via the Rat Line, most out of Argentina.
[02:35:17.393 --> 02:35:22.877]  They've got Hollywood movies about the boys from Brazil with Gregory Peck, where they're down there making Hitler clones.
[02:35:23.418 --> 02:35:26.921]  Makes me ask, you know, what's going to come true next here?
[02:35:27.462 --> 02:35:32.066]  Just incredible job, but you gave me the inside scoop, not violating your NDA, but
[02:35:32.666 --> 02:35:33.987]  You were telling me you're on the fence.
[02:35:34.587 --> 02:35:36.248]  It was pretty sophisticated what you said.
[02:35:36.308 --> 02:35:37.349]  Once you said it, it all clicked.
[02:35:37.589 --> 02:35:38.209]  What do you really think?
[02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:42.171]  I think that the plan was in place for Adolf Hitler to get out.
[02:35:42.552 --> 02:35:53.818]  I think that they had made every, you know, if he's number one in command, his number two, three, four, five, and six, they would have put in place how to exfil him out of Germany.
[02:35:54.338 --> 02:35:59.783]  And they had a Ford group that were sent ahead of time to start preparing for his arrival in South America.
[02:35:59.803 --> 02:36:01.004]  And we know those guys.
[02:36:01.044 --> 02:36:04.948]  We know the Barbies, the Skorzenskis, the Adolf Eichmanns.
[02:36:05.108 --> 02:36:06.589]  And some of them were caught, some of them weren't.
[02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:13.735]  The ones that were caught, that was by design, and those were in deals with the Israelis, for example, and the IDF caught Eichmann.
[02:36:13.775 --> 02:36:15.257]  But it was always for a reason.
[02:36:16.798 --> 02:36:21.261]  At the end of the war, in April 1945, what happened to Adolf Hitler?
[02:36:21.281 --> 02:36:22.302]  What was his demise?
[02:36:22.842 --> 02:36:23.222]  I don't know.
[02:36:23.422 --> 02:36:30.527]  But I know that the process of how he was going to get out was perfectly executed, and that's what we dug into for Season 3.
[02:36:31.128 --> 02:36:31.488]  Incredible.
[02:36:31.508 --> 02:36:34.270]  You guys have found the Nazi escape base in Argentina.
[02:36:34.470 --> 02:36:35.290]  Without a doubt.
[02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:36.511]  We found the files.
[02:36:36.671 --> 02:36:42.115]  Joseph Mengele, I have in my hands his hand signature on the ship that he boarded.
[02:36:42.135 --> 02:36:44.557]  The roster of... Congratulations, by the way.
[02:36:44.877 --> 02:36:46.498]  This is the stuff I grew up as a kid.
[02:36:47.178 --> 02:36:47.759]  There's no doubt.
[02:36:47.779 --> 02:36:48.500]  There's no question.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:48.920]  This is proof.
[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:49.321]  This is fact.
[02:36:49.361 --> 02:36:51.463]  His own signature in multiple different forms.
[02:36:51.483 --> 02:36:51.903]  His own visa.
[02:36:51.923 --> 02:36:53.485]  How he came into Argentina and where he went.
[02:36:53.505 --> 02:36:54.646]  His marriage certificate.
[02:36:54.666 --> 02:36:55.647]  We found everything!
[02:37:08.019 --> 02:37:20.607]  Well exactly, why was the Angel of Death protected and then you have some guard at a death camp, fine, send him to prison, but why is the guard sent to prison and then Mengele can run around?
[02:37:20.627 --> 02:37:37.057]  So I believe that Joseph Mengele was in charge of regions of South America, that he was kind of in the pragmatic organization, the sailor organization, he was in charge of regions of South America for the fascists fighting the communists.
[02:37:37.637 --> 02:37:42.160]  Yeah, so those that don't know, Joseph Mingle, the angel of death, one of the most disgusting humans ever.
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.642]  Medical experiments on thousands.
[02:37:43.902 --> 02:37:47.244]  Injecting blue into little kids' eyes to see if... Freezing them to death.
[02:37:47.665 --> 02:37:51.728]  Taking twins and torturing one to see... I mean, just like, you can't even process.
[02:37:51.748 --> 02:37:56.071]  And this man escaped and lived into old age and died of old age in South America.
[02:37:56.771 --> 02:38:08.216]  A lot of it was, from my research, they had trillions of today's money hidden and so they parlayed that into deep state groups so a few Nazis got busted here and there when they weren't coughing up the goods.
[02:38:08.336 --> 02:38:12.118]  Yeah, but not anybody crucial, not anybody important, not anybody.
[02:38:12.138 --> 02:38:22.222]  The ones that got caught, they had either served their purpose and they had kind of expired their usefulness or they were such an asset that they were able to be traded
[02:38:23.022 --> 02:38:27.903]  And exposed and handed off like Adolf Eichmann when he was given to the Israelis.
[02:38:28.043 --> 02:38:28.943]  It was for a reason.
[02:38:29.203 --> 02:38:36.565]  And a reason to create a better, stronger partnership with the Israeli intelligence agency when we handed him to them.
[02:38:37.165 --> 02:38:40.126]  So this, we know, we discovered the route lines.
[02:38:40.206 --> 02:38:42.786]  We found who was facilitating, who was involved, who was there.
[02:38:44.006 --> 02:38:47.447]  You know, and that communism, imagine that, was at the root of a lot of it.
[02:38:47.807 --> 02:38:52.248]  And there's no question what these guys did after that.
[02:38:53.769 --> 02:38:57.371]  Wow, and I gotta say, this has been going on like three years.
[02:38:58.192 --> 02:38:59.332]  How long has Hunting Hitler been going on?
[02:39:00.013 --> 02:39:02.954]  The investigation has been going on for three and a half years now.
[02:39:03.715 --> 02:39:11.599]  Two hit seasons, which the first was amazing, historic in Europe, the second I thought was incredible, the third you're telling me really delivered, well the others already did.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:14.521]  It's crazy to have this come out in the JFK files.
[02:39:15.301 --> 02:39:17.522]  30 days before your show's about to hit.
[02:39:17.642 --> 02:39:18.602]  Wow, congratulations.
[02:39:18.642 --> 02:39:23.184]  Yeah, I mean, History Channel called up, you know, the director of the CIA and said, hey, could you please release these fours?
[02:39:23.604 --> 02:39:25.785]  No, I mean, is it synchronicity or serendipity?
[02:39:26.025 --> 02:39:27.486]  Yeah, it was fate.
[02:39:28.226 --> 02:39:29.206]  Let's just bring him in briefly.
[02:39:29.226 --> 02:39:30.067]  He's going to be with us next segment.
[02:39:30.087 --> 02:39:30.947]  You're going to be co-hosting with us.
[02:39:31.647 --> 02:39:37.329]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, best-selling author, worked for the State Department in a lot of their important work, fighting the globalists.
[02:39:37.609 --> 02:39:39.150]  I know you're an expert on the Nazis as well.
[02:39:40.325 --> 02:39:41.886]  By the way, congratulations on the series.
[02:39:41.906 --> 02:39:45.048]  You know, I also wrote a book called Hunting Hitler, which did very well, preceded your series.
[02:39:45.068 --> 02:39:45.969]  Same name, Hunting Hitler.
[02:39:45.989 --> 02:39:47.350]  I didn't even know that!
[02:39:47.370 --> 02:39:48.591]  He's done everything!
[02:40:09.375 --> 02:40:10.095]  And we agree.
[02:40:10.155 --> 02:40:11.836]  I mean, I came to the same conclusion.
[02:40:11.876 --> 02:40:21.041]  Of course, I didn't have all the documents you had, but I have enough of the documents to know that the FBI was hunting Hitler in Argentina.
[02:40:21.281 --> 02:40:23.382]  By the way, this is serendipity synchronicity.
[02:40:23.462 --> 02:40:24.882]  I've known Gorsy 20 years.
[02:40:24.902 --> 02:40:26.723]  I didn't even know he'd written this.
[02:40:27.524 --> 02:40:29.205]  I'm now in the twilight zone.
[02:40:29.225 --> 02:40:29.745]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:30.731 --> 02:40:36.718]  Well, and I've admired the work you've done on the Honey Hitler HBO series.
[02:40:36.758 --> 02:40:37.859]  I think it's spectacular.
[02:40:37.879 --> 02:40:42.124]  I wish I had the research budget to go down and do what you guys have done.
[02:40:42.764 --> 02:40:45.527]  But you've really broken the case wide open.
[02:40:45.587 --> 02:40:49.151]  And now that we have these caches of documents coming out of the
[02:40:50.392 --> 02:40:53.194]  FBI on on what really happened to Hitler.
[02:40:53.234 --> 02:40:54.816]  I think it's indisputable.
[02:40:54.856 --> 02:40:58.618]  I was about to say though, I mean I knew you were an expert on Hitler, instead I'd forgotten.
[02:40:58.638 --> 02:41:01.601]  Remember years ago you'd actually written that book, you'd mentioned it, you've done so much.
[02:41:01.621 --> 02:41:02.361]  It's just crazy.
[02:41:02.882 --> 02:41:04.923]  Infowars reporter Dr. Corsi, honored to have him here.
[02:41:05.283 --> 02:41:06.925]  But how crazy is it without me even knowing?
[02:41:06.945 --> 02:41:14.090]  I just thought we ought to have you on today when when Tim Kennedy's here and then it's just all... But separately, what do you make of Trump?
[02:41:14.110 --> 02:41:15.091]  Because we'll get into the whole
[02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:16.031]  Yeah.
[02:41:16.131 --> 02:41:17.933]  Indictments with Tim and you in the next segment.
[02:41:20.154 --> 02:41:21.475]  Why is Trump doing this?
[02:41:21.495 --> 02:41:22.496]  This is so hardcore.
[02:41:22.516 --> 02:41:24.457]  Because the media is spinning it that he didn't do anything.
[02:41:24.477 --> 02:41:26.118]  Well, the other presidents blocked it.
[02:41:26.158 --> 02:41:26.479]  He didn't.
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:34.124]  Well, I mean, first of all, I think Donald Trump fully appreciates that he's facing a deep state threat himself.
[02:41:34.785 --> 02:41:36.186]  And this gets clear today.
[02:41:36.266 --> 02:41:39.948]  And I've been writing about this all day, all morning about the Manafort indictment.
[02:41:39.968 --> 02:41:43.571]  You've been saying for six months they're going to indict Manafort and then next they're going to go after Trump.
[02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:45.195]  That's right.
[02:41:45.235 --> 02:41:51.478]  And Trump has got to watch it because the Mueller and the FBI, they're crooked prosecutors.
[02:41:52.339 --> 02:41:55.040]  And Trump is going to release these files.
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:57.141]  I think he's not going to be satisfied here.
[02:41:57.181 --> 02:41:57.862]  There's also the
[02:42:00.523 --> 02:42:01.184]  We're good to go.
[02:42:16.557 --> 02:42:17.698]  Sure, even CBS has the headline that...
[02:42:36.953 --> 02:42:39.834]  Hoover told folks, we're gonna say it's a lone gunman, get that out.
[02:42:40.134 --> 02:42:41.894]  Tim Kennedy's our guest, popping in.
[02:42:41.914 --> 02:42:47.775]  His daughter, Jerome Corsi, who I had no idea, I've forgotten, he's written so many best-selling books, wrote Hunting Hitler.
[02:42:48.035 --> 02:42:49.476]  We have the host of Hunting Hitler here.
[02:42:49.896 --> 02:42:51.516]  So this is true Twilight Zone.
[02:42:51.896 --> 02:42:52.436]  We'll be back.
[02:42:52.536 --> 02:42:53.076]  Stay with us.
[02:42:53.176 --> 02:42:57.197]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:57.337 --> 02:42:58.417]  Those are censored sites.
[02:43:02.818 --> 02:43:05.259]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses
[02:43:06.815 --> 02:43:12.457]  of our enemies by studying what they attack, by studying what they fear.
[02:43:13.158 --> 02:43:14.958]  They fear families living together.
[02:43:15.018 --> 02:43:17.940]  They fear people loving God.
[02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:22.661]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[02:43:23.962 --> 02:43:31.205]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[02:43:33.191 --> 02:43:39.636]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[02:43:41.197 --> 02:43:47.301]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[02:43:48.201 --> 02:44:01.291]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:08.876]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:44:10.157 --> 02:44:17.924]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[02:44:19.665 --> 02:44:20.846]  And so many things will happen.
[02:44:22.047 --> 02:44:23.028]  We are the majority.
[02:44:23.956 --> 02:44:32.687]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[02:44:33.848 --> 02:44:38.855]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[02:44:40.302 --> 02:44:42.744]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[02:44:43.584 --> 02:44:51.789]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[02:44:52.470 --> 02:44:58.834]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[02:45:00.695 --> 02:45:01.596]  So many people write me.
[02:45:02.423 --> 02:45:10.677]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[02:45:11.419 --> 02:45:13.021]  We have to fly our flag.
[02:45:14.025 --> 02:45:15.465]  We have to wear our colors.
[02:45:15.765 --> 02:45:20.407]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:21.087 --> 02:45:23.927]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[02:45:24.148 --> 02:45:35.390]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:37.651]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:45:38.231 --> 02:45:40.394]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[02:45:40.734 --> 02:45:43.097]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[02:45:43.518 --> 02:45:50.167]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[02:45:50.667 --> 02:45:55.313]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[02:45:56.194 --> 02:46:03.176]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[02:46:03.516 --> 02:46:06.496]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[02:46:06.836 --> 02:46:23.840]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:33.382]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[02:46:34.042 --> 02:46:38.703]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the Info War.
[02:46:38.743 --> 02:46:50.606]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[02:46:50.926 --> 02:46:51.406]  So please,
[02:46:51.866 --> 02:46:57.211]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[02:46:57.591 --> 02:46:59.152]  You are the InfoWars.
[02:47:04.937 --> 02:47:07.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.206 --> 02:47:19.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got breaking news so big it makes my head spin.
[02:47:23.397 --> 02:47:27.941]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.362 --> 02:47:32.744]  Everything they do to us, they then say we're doing.
[02:47:33.165 --> 02:47:37.488]  They're a bunch of Russian agents, sold out to every country that'll buy them off.
[02:47:38.569 --> 02:47:39.329]  They say we are.
[02:47:40.210 --> 02:47:43.452]  Well now, shock video on Infowars.com.
[02:47:43.492 --> 02:47:44.173]  This just broke.
[02:47:44.593 --> 02:47:49.057]  Trump supporter mows down Dreamers in Soros-funded ad.
[02:47:49.597 --> 02:47:51.599]  It's a little black kid and a little Muslim girl.
[02:47:52.691 --> 02:47:54.492]  As a Muslim girl, she wouldn't be allowed outside.
[02:47:54.512 --> 02:47:57.993]  And she also wouldn't be going to school, so... Exactly.
[02:47:58.413 --> 02:48:15.878]  And you've got a guy with a Gadsden flag license plate, and then he's got the name of a guy, Gillespie, who's running for Congress, on the back of it with a rebel flag, and he runs them over, and they claim tenuously that they can use what happened in Virginia
[02:48:16.678 --> 02:48:34.434]  In Charlottesville, as the pretext, when all three leaders of the white supremacist groups turned out working for Obama just a year ago, I want to roll this shocking ad with children in fear porn, in murder porn, being run over on America's streets by the evil white man.
[02:48:34.454 --> 02:48:40.940]  And then we've got, I forgot the show, we've got the Austin Chronicle, just to show, this is this week, everywhere, every American city, it says,
[02:48:42.518 --> 02:48:43.379]  Armed white male.
[02:48:43.719 --> 02:48:45.681]  That's the new Halloween horror person.
[02:48:46.241 --> 02:48:47.662]  Halloween mask on the cover.
[02:48:47.722 --> 02:48:50.565]  So, uh, talk about Hitlerian propaganda.
[02:48:51.726 --> 02:48:52.326]  It's happening.
[02:48:53.207 --> 02:48:56.130]  Here is the new George Soros ad.
[02:49:00.553 --> 02:49:01.894]  Nice little kid playing basketball.
[02:49:01.914 --> 02:49:03.636]  Exercising, that's good.
[02:49:03.776 --> 02:49:04.917]  Here comes the rebel flag.
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:10.542]  Total race war is what they're pushing.
[02:49:12.046 --> 02:49:13.027]  Poor Hispanic child.
[02:49:13.107 --> 02:49:14.087]  It's just been running.
[02:49:15.788 --> 02:49:16.849]  Here comes the truck.
[02:49:16.889 --> 02:49:17.910]  Here comes the white man.
[02:49:18.490 --> 02:49:19.191]  Run!
[02:49:19.251 --> 02:49:20.752]  Man, Soros is a joke.
[02:49:22.373 --> 02:49:22.933]  They're running.
[02:49:23.794 --> 02:49:25.695]  It's Gillespie running for Congress.
[02:49:26.035 --> 02:49:28.396]  Run, run, run!
[02:49:28.477 --> 02:49:30.198]  Run, run, the poor little Muslim girl.
[02:49:30.238 --> 02:49:33.560]  Of course, it's the Muslims using the cars everywhere to run people over.
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.001]  But again, that's what you do.
[02:49:35.021 --> 02:49:38.383]  You project it onto America and the evil white man.
[02:49:39.522 --> 02:49:40.443]  Now the big Ford.
[02:49:40.984 --> 02:49:41.444]  Heavy duty.
[02:49:41.484 --> 02:49:43.746]  Is that a Ford or is that a... That's Ford.
[02:49:43.826 --> 02:49:44.267]  Big Ford.
[02:49:44.287 --> 02:49:45.328]  That's his nightmare.
[02:49:45.368 --> 02:49:46.369]  It was just a nightmare.
[02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:52.695]  Oh, poor... Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?
[02:49:52.995 --> 02:49:57.120]  Latino Victory Fund paid for it and is responsible for the content of the advertisement.
[02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:57.480]  That is horrible.
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:01.404]  It's like, yeah, well go to an Islamic country and you really will have that happen to you.
[02:50:01.464 --> 02:50:02.765]  I mean, this is next level.
[02:50:04.166 --> 02:50:13.775]  At best, like you could wish that little girl, I bet she wished that she got run over by a truck, because otherwise she'd be sentenced to a lifelong of enslavement.
[02:50:14.195 --> 02:50:17.418]  You know, she couldn't go to school, she wouldn't have a backpack, she wouldn't be walking down the street.
[02:50:17.738 --> 02:50:20.080]  None of those things would be happening in any of the places that I go and work.
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:21.401]  Her genitals would be cut off.
[02:50:21.801 --> 02:50:22.642]  It's complete mutilation.
[02:50:24.483 --> 02:50:35.109]  Every instance of whether it's London Bridge or it's France during the Patriot Parade, these have been radical extremists hopping in vehicles and running over people.
[02:50:36.470 --> 02:50:45.515]  I'll tell you what, if you're scared and you're a Hispanic Latino and you're walking down the street and you're worried about somebody coming and getting you, I'm driving a big white Ford truck right now.
[02:50:46.035 --> 02:50:47.336]  Run to my truck, you're gonna be safe.
[02:50:47.396 --> 02:50:49.557]  And by the way, get your own Second Amendment, you're an American.
[02:50:49.577 --> 02:50:50.938]  Here's mine right here.
[02:50:51.678 --> 02:50:52.398]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[02:50:52.779 --> 02:50:56.141]  But my best friend sitting there, he also drives a massive big Ford truck.
[02:50:56.421 --> 02:50:56.841]  Run to him!
[02:50:56.961 --> 02:50:57.762]  I do too!
[02:50:57.922 --> 02:50:58.462]  We'll protect you!
[02:50:58.502 --> 02:50:59.403]  I've got a silver one!
[02:51:00.703 --> 02:51:02.404]  Ford should be pissed off by this ad.
[02:51:02.484 --> 02:51:03.565]  I'd be infuriated.
[02:51:03.605 --> 02:51:09.548]  But what I'm saying is the people, the freedom-loving Americans, those are the ones that I would...
[02:51:10.569 --> 02:51:12.029]  Put my life on the line multiple times.
[02:51:12.049 --> 02:51:13.650]  Well, this just shows how desperate they are.
[02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:14.050]  I do it right now.
[02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.810]  It's incredible.
[02:51:15.250 --> 02:51:17.210]  You were pointing out that you think this will drain the swamp.
[02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:18.730]  They've bitten off more than they can chew.
[02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:19.571]  It looks horrible.
[02:51:19.871 --> 02:51:21.031]  They're totally above the corruption.
[02:51:21.051 --> 02:51:31.633]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, your story is top-linked on DrugsReport.com, dealing with the fact that the FBI's reliance on discredited fusion GPS Russia dossier threatens Manafort prosecution.
[02:51:31.653 --> 02:51:39.254]  In the next five minutes, give us the data boil down, the inside scoop we broke yesterday, who would be indicted today, about what's really happening here.
[02:51:40.296 --> 02:51:44.498]  Yeah, and also I meant to say the History Channel for your special.
[02:51:44.799 --> 02:51:45.039]  Sure.
[02:51:45.219 --> 02:51:48.721]  I've taped shows and watched them multiple times.
[02:51:49.141 --> 02:51:52.263]  We're in complete agreement you're doing a good job.
[02:51:52.423 --> 02:51:53.343]  Let me break this down.
[02:51:53.403 --> 02:52:00.748]  What has happened is that the FBI went and used this Fusion GPS
[02:52:02.674 --> 02:52:14.602]  Which they paid for to the FISA court as the basis to get a wiretap, electronic surveillance on Manafort for well over a year.
[02:52:14.622 --> 02:52:20.926]  And they didn't tell the FISA court that the FBI had paid for this or that the Democrats had paid for it.
[02:52:20.946 --> 02:52:31.413]  Hillary's campaign, Perkins Coy, the DNC, running it through Perkins Coy so Hillary would have deniability and the DNC would have deniability.
[02:52:31.713 --> 02:52:33.160]  That's flat out illegal, isn't it?
[02:52:34.084 --> 02:52:34.969]  If violence can't pay off, yeah.
[02:52:36.252 --> 02:52:53.644]  Yeah, it violates campaign laws, and from the FBI's point of view, if they obtained a fraudulent FISA court warrant, and they then proceeded to do electronic surveillance on Mueller, and by the way, leaked it to CNN, which again is another crime.
[02:52:53.664 --> 02:52:54.905]  I mean, these are at least two crimes.
[02:53:07.134 --> 02:53:07.554]  Yeah, I see.
[02:53:07.855 --> 02:53:10.820]  My point is all this FISA court will be thrown out.
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:13.625]  In other words, this is a very serious impediment for Mueller.
[02:53:13.645 --> 02:53:17.732]  So your point is this is unadmissible because it's based on a fraud?
[02:53:18.704 --> 02:53:19.184]  Exactly.
[02:53:19.244 --> 02:53:26.687]  And so now the whole thing is Mueller was, I think, rushed by the Hillary people saying we've got to change the news cycle.
[02:53:27.087 --> 02:53:29.268]  So you better indict somebody and you better do it now.
[02:53:29.888 --> 02:53:37.951]  I don't think they were ready to indict a man... So you agree with Tim Kennedy that the swamp has now really stuck its arm in the wood chipper?
[02:53:38.874 --> 02:53:45.558]  Yes absolutely and they're now reacting from a scared and frightened position because they know that they don't change the news cycle.
[02:53:45.958 --> 02:53:58.126]  Now the other thing that happened this afternoon was really important is that Podesta, Tony Podesta stepped down from his firm and remember we were the first to report that Tony Podesta was working for the same group
[02:54:00.879 --> 02:54:01.159]  That's right.
[02:54:17.688 --> 02:54:23.794]  It's a huge deal and it shows the ultimate corruption of the FBI, the determination to go on this witch hunt.
[02:54:24.294 --> 02:54:35.305]  Because basically there's no tie between these so-called problems that maybe Mueller had with taking money and wire transfers and how he handled it.
[02:54:35.345 --> 02:54:39.589]  Although I suspect Manafort had very good legal counsel when he did all of that.
[02:54:40.149 --> 02:54:41.770]  Well, I mean, I've read the documents.
[02:54:41.850 --> 02:54:46.152]  I'm no foreign elections lawyer, but he's operating in the good graces of the U.S.
[02:54:46.192 --> 02:54:46.512]  government.
[02:54:46.772 --> 02:54:48.713]  He's paying for the whole campaign operation.
[02:54:49.013 --> 02:54:50.694]  He sets up companies there and does it.
[02:54:51.234 --> 02:54:53.115]  It looks like what everybody else does.
[02:54:53.175 --> 02:54:55.196]  Obviously, he knows he's under scrutiny.
[02:54:56.396 --> 02:55:05.480]  Well, so far, it's being presented by the mainstream media, you know, like they found the hatchet that committed the murder and in the bed with the
[02:55:06.204 --> 02:55:19.360]  Well, I mean, number one, criminals wouldn't be transferring money in public ledgers that were already given to Congress.
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:25.588]  They admit they SWAT teamed them just for the aesthetics for the jury to say, oh, look, we found this in a SWAT team raid.
[02:55:26.627 --> 02:55:31.529]  And by the way, we don't have nearly as clear records for all the money laundering that the Clintons were doing.
[02:55:32.029 --> 02:55:43.813]  And I also pointed this out, that the Russians were money laundering to Clint Esta through this company that was in the Netherlands and shows up in the Panama Papers and through this Medcom bank.
[02:55:43.833 --> 02:55:44.814]  But let's interview her.
[02:55:45.034 --> 02:55:47.254]  Oh, I'm sorry, her car blew up a week and a half ago.
[02:55:47.575 --> 02:55:50.856]  What does that signify, some of the witnesses being murdered?
[02:55:51.536 --> 02:55:52.356]  It's been non-stop.
[02:55:54.737 --> 02:56:03.827]  I jokingly, with a TV show that's coming out, I'm going to be doing some really dangerous jobs, and I joke that maybe I should just go work for the Clintons because nobody dies more than them.
[02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:05.228]  In fact, do applaud.
[02:56:05.248 --> 02:56:07.991]  You didn't want to talk about it, but tell folks about your new show.
[02:56:08.011 --> 02:56:10.373]  You're not just co-hosting on History, you've got your own show coming out.
[02:56:10.673 --> 02:56:11.154]  Tell folks.
[02:56:11.414 --> 02:56:17.398]  I'm going to go do the most dangerous jobs in the world, and I can see if I can survive doing them, but it's the bread and butter of being American.
[02:56:17.498 --> 02:56:19.039]  And that would be working for the Clintons.
[02:56:19.059 --> 02:56:21.701]  That would be, because not the bread and butter of being American.
[02:56:21.821 --> 02:56:24.003]  Working for the Clintons would be the most dangerous.
[02:56:24.423 --> 02:56:25.384]  They kill everybody!
[02:56:25.724 --> 02:56:32.289]  I cannot count on hands, feet, your hands, my feet, on any of these papers the number of people they've had executed.
[02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:37.072]  And every time there has been a leak or an opportunity for somebody to reveal something about the Clintons, they die.
[02:56:37.412 --> 02:56:39.233]  And let me ask you both this question, because I mean this.
[02:56:40.134 --> 02:56:42.395]  He calls me dark heart, evil, all this stuff.
[02:56:42.455 --> 02:56:43.415]  Why am I still alive?
[02:56:43.435 --> 02:56:44.436]  Because we're in the light?
[02:56:46.997 --> 02:56:48.277]  You're actually a hard guy to reach.
[02:56:48.477 --> 02:56:52.679]  You're a hard guy to... You've said so much.
[02:56:53.199 --> 02:56:55.820]  It's not the threat of doing it, you're already doing it.
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:07.164]  And if you died, if they came and killed you, if your car blew up, it would be a pretty difficult thing to not tie that back to the people that want to... That's what I've been told, is it highlights everything I've done too.
[02:57:07.364 --> 02:57:07.604]  Yeah.
[02:57:08.696 --> 02:57:10.498]  So instead, they just want to assassinate our names.
[02:57:11.199 --> 02:57:14.803]  Yeah, the character attacks is the best way to get to silence you.
[02:57:14.823 --> 02:57:17.686]  All right, Dr. Corsi, we've got Owen Schroeder in an hour coming up.
[02:57:17.726 --> 02:57:18.987]  Jack Massovic, great patriot.
[02:57:19.007 --> 02:57:21.550]  He's going to be hosting next hour, but please get on that show.
[02:57:22.011 --> 02:57:30.260]  Tell us more about what's coming up and what's unfolding because I know you're right at the tip of the spear on this whole investigation, but let me just ask you briefly when we come back.
[02:57:31.676 --> 02:57:32.917]  How is it going for them?
[02:57:32.957 --> 02:57:47.149]  Because I don't want to be too positive, but it seems even in mainstream news, you've even got Dershowitz and you've even got CNN reporters and people, you've got Panetta, former head of the CIA, saying this looks criminal what Hillary did.
[02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:48.430]  What does that mean?
[02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:50.512]  Are the rats leaving the sinking ship?
[02:57:51.753 --> 02:58:00.441]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:58:00.501 --> 02:58:00.961]  That's right.
[02:58:01.021 --> 02:58:06.046]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.

[02:58:21.835 --> 02:58:30.437]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[03:00:07.099 --> 03:00:10.780]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:15.061]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[03:00:15.161 --> 03:00:18.082]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[03:00:24.466 --> 03:00:28.688]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Posobiec back in the saddle.
[03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:34.472]  My first time back, my first show back from my wedding just last week.
[03:00:34.492 --> 03:00:39.394]  I finally got to marry a girl of my dreams, Tanya Tay, now Tanya Tay Posobiec.
[03:00:39.435 --> 03:00:42.316]  I've got the bling right there to prove it to everybody.

[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:50.801]  Mike Cernovich came out.
[03:00:51.421 --> 03:00:56.767]  Cassandra Fairbanks, Lucian Wintrich from Gateway Pundit, just so many absolutely wonderful, great people.
[03:00:56.827 --> 03:01:08.719]  And so many people also sent in thank you messages to us, to Tanya, on a variety of social media platforms, from Twitter, from Facebook, every possible direction.
[03:01:08.739 --> 03:01:11.242]  A lot of people just sending out the love and support.
[03:01:11.762 --> 03:01:28.984]  And I wanted to just give a big thank you to everybody who who congratulated us and I really wanted to hold that up as a moment of saying look guys we can put politics aside and just focus on some things that are right and good with this country and amongst all of the
[03:01:29.924 --> 03:01:36.488]  Craziness and stories that we're trying to break down, you know, exposing the deep state for their crimes, exposing these people.
[03:01:36.528 --> 03:01:42.352]  Now we're learning about the sexual crimes in Hollywood, the issues going on in Washington, D.C.
[03:01:42.392 --> 03:01:46.715]  with the same type of activity, exposing all of those things, talking about those terrible things.
[03:01:46.775 --> 03:01:51.758]  I also want to make sure that we highlight the positive things every once in a while as well.
[03:01:51.798 --> 03:01:56.101]  And so that's why I really appreciate everybody showing their support.
[03:01:56.121 --> 03:01:58.443]  And I can say this now, my wife,
[03:01:58.803 --> 03:02:20.003]  Really appreciate everyone's support as well, and we promise to continue to do all that we do to help tell the truth, to help expose what's going on in our country, and to help bring some semblance of justice and constitutional democracy, constitutional republic back to our country, to bring that in.
[03:02:20.023 --> 03:02:21.865]  So, ton of news today I want to break down.
[03:02:22.777 --> 03:02:27.400]  Also, the President is going to be speaking live at 3.30 this afternoon.
[03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:29.621]  So in just about 30 minutes, the President is going to be speaking.
[03:02:29.641 --> 03:02:33.563]  I want to take that opportunity to let you guys know that we are going to be covering it.
[03:02:33.864 --> 03:02:35.605]  I've got the producers back in the studio.
[03:02:35.925 --> 03:02:36.805]  I'm down in D.C.
[03:02:36.825 --> 03:02:39.627]  They're actually all the way in Austin, but they're going to be checking an eye out on it.
[03:02:39.947 --> 03:02:46.796]  And so if it does end up like he's going to be saying something big, a huge announcement, we're going to make sure we'll split screen it, we'll cover it for you guys.
[03:02:47.096 --> 03:02:50.760]  So make sure that with all of the breaking news that you're not going to miss anything.
[03:02:51.221 --> 03:02:52.603]  You'll be able to watch it right here.
[03:02:52.663 --> 03:02:54.625]  So don't feel like there's any need to let it go.
[03:02:56.420 --> 03:02:59.544]  We have 30 minutes until that, so I want to bring up some of the stuff.
[03:02:59.944 --> 03:03:05.150]  And right off the bat, the UCLA players freed from China.
[03:03:05.490 --> 03:03:08.073]  How amazing, how wonderful was this story?
[03:03:08.454 --> 03:03:09.936]  Now they've thanked the president.
[03:03:10.196 --> 03:03:13.600]  Three UCLA players who were arrested in China.
[03:03:14.888 --> 03:03:18.330]  Uh, they were detained for, uh, on suspicion of shoplifting.
[03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:25.934]  They have, President Trump specifically, uh, intervened on their behalf with the President of China, and they are now thanking him.
[03:03:25.954 --> 03:03:28.475]  They're now home safely in Los Angeles.
[03:03:28.875 --> 03:03:32.217]  And it just goes to show you folks, how often do the media tell us
[03:03:32.717 --> 03:03:34.859]  That President Trump doesn't care about black athletes.
[03:03:34.879 --> 03:03:35.379]  You remember that?
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:49.851]  All during the NFL protests, all the kneelers, all the kneeling that was going on, Colin Kaepernick, and we were all told that it was because President Trump is a racist, and that he hates black athletes, and that all these terrible things about him, when he didn't say it about black athletes.
[03:03:50.151 --> 03:03:51.032]  I don't want to get that clear.
[03:03:51.232 --> 03:03:51.832]  He never said that.
[03:03:51.892 --> 03:03:55.995]  He said athletes who disrespect the American flag.
[03:03:56.015 --> 03:03:56.756]  That's all he talked about.
[03:03:56.996 --> 03:03:57.877]  That's all he said.
[03:03:58.117 --> 03:04:04.902]  Well now, we've got three basketball players, UCLA players, thank goodness they're home, they're home safely.
[03:04:05.162 --> 03:04:07.704]  And we understand, you know, after Otto Warbinger
[03:04:08.064 --> 03:04:19.328]  The terrible stuff that happened to him while he was in captivity in North Korea, came back essentially in a coma, died several days later.
[03:04:19.568 --> 03:04:22.949]  We wanted to make sure that we didn't get into another situation like that.
[03:04:23.029 --> 03:04:24.970]  He was held there for over a year.
[03:04:25.530 --> 03:04:27.931]  Obama essentially did not secure his release.
[03:04:27.971 --> 03:04:30.312]  President Trump was able to get him released, but it was too late.
[03:04:30.972 --> 03:04:37.855]  And so he knew the importance of getting these people freed, and thank goodness they are home here in the United States.
[03:04:37.895 --> 03:04:42.938]  So I want to do that first segment, cover out some good news that's going on here in the United States.
[03:04:43.178 --> 03:04:46.519]  Let's break down some of the stuff that's going on as well in the next segment.
[03:04:46.539 --> 03:04:47.800]  We're going to talk about Roy Moore.
[03:04:47.820 --> 03:04:55.163]  We're going to talk about Mitch McConnell, Jeff Sessions, and how all of this ties into what's going on with the Mueller investigation.
[03:04:55.684 --> 03:04:56.584]  It's very interesting.
[03:04:56.624 --> 03:04:58.665]  I spent all morning putting it together, so stay tuned.
[03:05:03.604 --> 03:05:08.487]  New from Emrix Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.

[03:05:59.418 --> 03:06:01.078]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:13.406 --> 03:06:18.166]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.810 --> 03:06:31.272]  Here filling in for the big fourth hour, breaking down some of the news as we await President Trump's announcement, big announcement that he's promised.
[03:06:31.292 --> 03:06:32.792]  Now he's been on the road for two weeks.
[03:06:33.112 --> 03:06:39.914]  He's been on the road over in Asia, making deals in China, working on the North Korea problem set.
[03:06:40.154 --> 03:06:42.254]  Hopefully we'll have some announcement on that.
[03:06:43.015 --> 03:06:44.415]  That would be my guess.
[03:06:44.955 --> 03:06:47.757]  As to what the announcement may have to do with North Korea, but we will see.
[03:06:47.797 --> 03:06:48.878]  We don't have any indications.
[03:06:48.918 --> 03:06:51.000]  We're waiting for about 30 minutes for that to come.
[03:06:51.020 --> 03:06:52.601]  But what I'd like to break down at first here...
[03:06:53.573 --> 03:06:58.637]  Is the current spate of this Roy Moore situation in Alabama.
[03:06:59.337 --> 03:07:05.502]  And first things first, we need to investigate every single one of these allegations.
[03:07:06.022 --> 03:07:10.546]  We need to have a call for a full investigation into every single one of these people.
[03:07:12.027 --> 03:07:15.469]  What they're saying, make sure that it's on the level.
[03:07:15.649 --> 03:07:18.872]  Find out if there is any truth to what they have said.
[03:07:19.412 --> 03:07:19.893]  It's simple.
[03:07:20.274 --> 03:07:26.102]  Now, see, a lot of people in the media came to us and they said, well, we know that you guys are going to say that you don't care because he's a Republican.
[03:07:26.122 --> 03:07:27.303]  That's not true at all.
[03:07:27.864 --> 03:07:36.496]  I said on the very first day that the accusations came out that I hope that there is a full inquiry and investigation into what exactly was going on.
[03:07:37.381 --> 03:07:38.262]  And we want the truth.
[03:07:38.582 --> 03:07:42.444]  Because that is what the other side doesn't understand, is that we stand for truth.
[03:07:42.504 --> 03:07:45.647]  We stand for the investigation of truth, and we want anything to come out.
[03:07:45.687 --> 03:07:47.148]  If there's accusations, great.
[03:07:47.548 --> 03:07:51.650]  Let's look into those accusations.
[03:07:52.011 --> 03:07:59.416]  Obviously not great that it happened, but if that is the situation, we need to look into it the same way that we would look into anything else.
[03:07:59.436 --> 03:08:01.557]  There's no knee-jerkism from our side.
[03:08:01.597 --> 03:08:03.438]  There's no knee-jerkism from Jack Posobiec.
[03:08:03.778 --> 03:08:04.319]  If I want
[03:08:05.119 --> 03:08:06.500]  Uh, to get to the bottom of something.
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:11.763]  I'm going to stay laser focused on that until I get to the bottom of what exactly was going on.
[03:08:11.843 --> 03:08:16.045]  So I really applaud the work a lot of the local investigators down.
[03:08:17.171 --> 03:08:39.115]  In Alabama, a lot of the local news that has come up and talked about some of these allegations, looking into, they've got, so there was the yearbook, they brought out different copies of the yearbook, looked at those, checked them based on the ones that his accuser had brought up, that very emotional press conference that was held, Beverly Nelson with Gloria Allred there in New York City.
[03:08:39.155 --> 03:08:45.596]  But one thing that I'd like to focus on is why exactly is the media
[03:08:46.463 --> 03:08:52.146]  So hell-bent on prosecuting Roy Moore for all of this, when they've covered up.
[03:08:53.047 --> 03:08:54.768]  They've covered up for Harvey Weinstein.
[03:08:55.188 --> 03:08:57.089]  They've covered up for Kevin Spacey.
[03:08:57.389 --> 03:09:03.012]  And they covered up, of course, most infamously, for Bill Clinton for so many years.
[03:09:03.072 --> 03:09:11.557]  For so many years we were told that it doesn't matter what Bill Clinton did, that those women were all liars, Juanita Broderick shouldn't be believed, that she was wrong, don't worry about her.
[03:09:12.515 --> 03:09:12.735]  That's
[03:09:31.221 --> 03:09:41.509]  Newspaper in Washington, he dated Monica Lewinsky and then wrote about it Objectifying her and that was really how he broke into mainstream politics.
[03:09:41.549 --> 03:09:42.730]  It's how he got his name out.
[03:09:43.050 --> 03:09:59.963]  So The fact that he was dating her and then wrote a revealing piece in the Washington City paper This is the level that these people will stoop to to get their promotion of themselves out there though They took he took her out on dates took her out on dates and
[03:10:00.223 --> 03:10:03.766]  And he said, uh, it's the tawdriest of headlines.
[03:10:03.986 --> 03:10:06.928]  I dated Monica Lewinsky, Jake Tapper tells all.
[03:10:06.948 --> 03:10:13.693]  Now this is like National Enquirer, I don't mean to smear the National Enquirer, but this is like tabloid journalism at its finest.
[03:10:14.013 --> 03:10:23.000]  It's attacking someone who under many people's opinions was a victim herself, a lowly intern for the President of the United States, taking someone like that,
[03:10:24.261 --> 03:10:31.827]  Of abusing her trust, clearly abusing her trust, writing up about it, and then I believe he called, he actually calls her chubby in the piece.
[03:10:32.147 --> 03:10:33.828]  So he went ahead and called her chubby.
[03:10:34.008 --> 03:10:44.155]  This is the same Jake Tapper who runs around mealy-mouthed and pontificating about how honorable and how just and upright and how moral he is.
[03:10:44.416 --> 03:10:50.420]  Well, Jake, if we're going to talk about moral character, let's talk about your moral character, the fact that you took a woman out on dates
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:11:09.427]  And then wrote it up to further your own political career, your own journalistic career I should say, landing eventually a job at CNN where I can understand why CNN would want to hire someone who was willing to stoop to such sleazy and quite frankly disgusting levels to promote himself and get his name out there.
[03:11:09.727 --> 03:11:17.870]  Taking a woman out and then dating her and then writing it up just so he could pile on on the media storm and circus that was going on around Monica Lewinsky.
[03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:18.270]  Now again,
[03:11:19.793 --> 03:11:23.158]  None of this is to take anything away from the Roy Moore accusations.
[03:11:23.178 --> 03:11:25.021]  I absolutely think they should be investigated.
[03:11:25.261 --> 03:11:30.608]  But I also think that we should take a step back and look at all of these situations.
[03:11:31.029 --> 03:11:32.611]  Look at the situation holistically.
[03:11:33.052 --> 03:11:34.173]  Look at the situation we talked about.
[03:11:34.293 --> 03:11:36.637]  Alex earlier was playing lots of the great
[03:11:37.597 --> 03:12:06.139]  Footage that is available, and I shouldn't say great, but disturbing footage that's available of Joe Biden, not 40 years ago, 40 minutes ago, 40 days ago, two years ago, of him touching young girls inappropriately, in my estimation, touching women, getting very handsy with them, getting very close to young girls as they pull themselves away, Republicans and Democrats, slapping Jeff Sessions, slapping his hand away as he went for
[03:12:07.432 --> 03:12:22.963]  For his granddaughter and so these this situation it it it frustrates a lot of people who have looked at this and seen these videos of Biden hours and hours of videos and who have known about the accusation about Bill Clinton.
[03:12:23.792 --> 03:12:31.277]  They want to talk to us about, oh wow, I was just seeing this headline, 52 times more coverage to Republican scandal than Democrat scandal.
[03:12:31.317 --> 03:12:34.419]  Bob Menendez, of course, who's a sitting U.S.
[03:12:34.460 --> 03:12:36.341]  Senator, an actual U.S.
[03:12:36.381 --> 03:12:47.829]  Senator who is on trial right now, this moment, for corruption, including charges of hiring underage girls as prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, okay?
[03:12:48.869 --> 03:12:49.890]  No coverage of this scandal.
[03:12:50.271 --> 03:12:50.832]  Sitting U.S.
[03:12:50.872 --> 03:12:52.574]  Senator, no coverage of this scandal.
[03:12:54.796 --> 03:12:57.780]  52 times more to Roy Moore than to Bob Menendez.
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:02.866]  They've got all the senators on air immediately, got all their responses on Roy Moore.
[03:13:03.186 --> 03:13:05.089]  Why hasn't the media done that for
[03:13:05.709 --> 03:13:10.938]  Bob Menendez, if this is the standard, if this is the standard we're going to take, then why aren't we setting the same standard for everyone else?
[03:13:11.058 --> 03:13:19.231]  Why is it that they only attack Republicans and they run interference and cover up for Democrats to include Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey?
[03:13:20.023 --> 03:13:23.105]  Harvey Weinstein, of course, was a Democrat mega-donor.
[03:13:23.465 --> 03:13:27.127]  And I want to point that out, too, because so many people say, well, Harvey Weinstein, that was just Hollywood.
[03:13:27.147 --> 03:13:27.807]  That was just Hollywood.
[03:13:27.847 --> 03:13:28.308]  No, no, no, no.
[03:13:28.708 --> 03:13:33.690]  Harvey Weinstein was donating to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, to so many liberal causes.
[03:13:33.931 --> 03:13:42.655]  Harvey Weinstein was an absolute tie-in to the Democrat inner circle, highest levels of politics, and the media couldn't figure it out.
[03:13:42.695 --> 03:13:45.377]  CNN even had this guy at one point, Alan, as a guest
[03:13:45.737 --> 03:13:46.117]  I think?
[03:14:00.004 --> 03:14:10.129]  Why were you shielding this predator, this disgusting predator, from so many of our nation's, you know, favorite stars for so many years?
[03:14:10.489 --> 03:14:12.230]  Why were you protecting him?
[03:14:12.410 --> 03:14:13.210]  Why were you covering it up?
[03:14:13.230 --> 03:14:15.971]  And then when it came out, everyone said, well, we all knew, we all knew, we all knew.
[03:14:16.552 --> 03:14:17.832]  Okay, then why didn't you say anything?
[03:14:18.273 --> 03:14:19.873]  You're the host of CNN, Jake Tapper.
[03:14:19.913 --> 03:14:21.034]  Why didn't you break the story?
[03:14:21.514 --> 03:14:24.615]  New York Times, why didn't you get it out there for 30 years?
[03:14:24.756 --> 03:14:25.576]  Why did it take
[03:14:26.483 --> 03:14:29.285]  All of that time for it to come public.
[03:14:29.325 --> 03:14:37.871]  And now, Jackie Speier, Democrat Jackie Speier, has broken the story that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan knew about $15 million.
[03:14:39.818 --> 03:14:44.921]  That was given to alleged victims of sexual harassment in the U.S.
[03:14:45.441 --> 03:14:45.961]  Congress.
[03:14:46.582 --> 03:14:55.807]  People who actually knew and paid off the victims and had them sign NDAs for secret sexual harassment victims.
[03:14:56.147 --> 03:14:57.188]  Who are these victims?
[03:14:57.408 --> 03:15:03.731]  And more importantly, I should say, who are the people that were conducting this sexual harassment of them?
[03:15:04.352 --> 03:15:05.772]  Why is this being covered up?
[03:15:06.273 --> 03:15:08.654]  Are these people still serving in Congress?
[03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:10.210]  Are they staffers?
[03:15:10.350 --> 03:15:12.651]  Are they congressmen and congresswomen themselves?
[03:15:12.952 --> 03:15:17.815]  Why are we not talking about this, about the sexual harassment that's going on in Washington, D.C.?
[03:15:17.855 --> 03:15:19.837]  Well, I've been talking to my sources about it.
[03:15:20.237 --> 03:15:25.200]  We're hearing that there's a list that's floating around the hill called the Creep List.
[03:15:25.841 --> 03:15:33.006]  I'm working on getting my hands on a copy of that, or a partial copy of that, because I want to know what's going on with my elected officials.
[03:15:33.266 --> 03:15:36.027]  And I want America to know what's going on with its elected officials.
[03:15:36.127 --> 03:15:47.212]  And I would hope that if Roy Moore does win his race, and if these allegations prove to be false, that he would call for investigations into the House, call for investigations into Hollywood at the same time.
[03:15:47.232 --> 03:15:49.693]  Because it's time to expose the truth.
[03:15:50.013 --> 03:15:52.974]  It's time to hold these people's feet to their fire.
[03:15:53.194 --> 03:15:55.075]  And the time, ladies and gentlemen, is now.
[03:15:55.155 --> 03:15:57.036]  Because we're not going to get another chance at this.
[03:15:57.556 --> 03:15:58.557]  Stay tuned, right after the break.
[03:15:58.677 --> 03:15:59.217]  Coming right back.
[03:16:03.188 --> 03:16:09.932]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[03:16:10.672 --> 03:16:12.833]  By studying what they fear.
[03:16:13.533 --> 03:16:15.334]  They fear families living together.
[03:16:15.374 --> 03:16:18.316]  They fear people loving God.
[03:16:18.396 --> 03:16:23.038]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:31.583]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[03:16:33.547 --> 03:16:39.992]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[03:16:41.553 --> 03:16:47.678]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[03:16:48.558 --> 03:17:01.668]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[03:17:02.665 --> 03:17:09.251]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[03:17:10.532 --> 03:17:18.299]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[03:17:20.041 --> 03:17:21.222]  And so many things will happen.
[03:17:22.403 --> 03:17:23.404]  We are the majority.
[03:17:24.312 --> 03:17:33.063]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[03:17:34.204 --> 03:17:39.231]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[03:17:40.677 --> 03:17:43.118]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[03:17:43.958 --> 03:17:52.162]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[03:17:52.842 --> 03:17:59.205]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[03:18:01.065 --> 03:18:01.966]  So many people write me.
[03:18:02.799 --> 03:18:11.046]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[03:18:11.786 --> 03:18:13.388]  We have to fly our flag.
[03:18:14.383 --> 03:18:15.843]  We have to wear our colors.
[03:18:16.124 --> 03:18:20.785]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:21.445 --> 03:18:24.306]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[03:18:24.526 --> 03:18:35.769]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[03:18:35.989 --> 03:18:38.030]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:40.771]  And the lock her up Hillary for prison shirt.
[03:18:41.111 --> 03:18:43.471]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[03:18:43.872 --> 03:18:50.513]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[03:18:51.014 --> 03:18:55.675]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[03:18:56.555 --> 03:19:03.539]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:06.861]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[03:19:07.222 --> 03:19:24.232]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[03:19:24.992 --> 03:19:33.757]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[03:19:34.417 --> 03:19:39.080]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:48.645]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it
[03:19:48.885 --> 03:19:50.246]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:14.041 --> 03:20:14.562]  Yeah.
[03:20:37.493 --> 03:20:42.017]  Jack Masoby coming to you live here on this Wednesday afternoon.
[03:20:42.557 --> 03:20:46.981]  As we await the President's upcoming announcement, should be about here in about 10-15 minutes.
[03:20:47.621 --> 03:20:50.343]  Poised to make a big announcement, we're told.
[03:20:50.423 --> 03:20:54.466]  Possibly a huge announcement from the steps of the White House.
[03:20:55.027 --> 03:20:56.168]  We'll look to cover that live.
[03:20:56.208 --> 03:21:00.091]  We'll let you know what's going down, what all the breaking developments are.
[03:21:00.531 --> 03:21:05.235]  But I want to take a quick moment before we get to that, as we wait for that big announcement.
[03:21:06.042 --> 03:21:09.525]  To remind you guys about the InfoWars store, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:10.326 --> 03:21:13.028]  So, there are some of the sales...
[03:21:14.008 --> 03:21:14.148]  That's
[03:21:37.608 --> 03:21:38.208]  We're good to go.
[03:21:38.569 --> 03:21:39.309]  We're good to go.
[03:21:39.389 --> 03:21:40.390]  We're good to go.

[03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.610]  We're good to go.
[03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:42.371]  We're good to go.
[03:21:42.391 --> 03:21:43.111]  We're good to go.
[03:21:43.171 --> 03:21:44.012]  We're good to go.
[03:21:44.032 --> 03:21:44.552]  We're good to go.
[03:21:44.572 --> 03:21:45.653]  We're good to go.
[03:21:45.693 --> 03:21:46.153]  We're good to go.
[03:21:46.213 --> 03:21:46.814]  We're good to go.
[03:21:46.834 --> 03:21:47.194]  We're good to go.
[03:21:47.474 --> 03:21:48.054]  We're good to go.
[03:21:48.094 --> 03:21:49.175]  We're good to go.
[03:21:49.195 --> 03:21:49.735]  We're good to go.
[03:21:49.755 --> 03:21:50.196]  We're good to go.
[03:21:50.216 --> 03:21:50.936]  We're good to go.
[03:21:51.396 --> 03:21:52.097]  We're good to go.
[03:21:52.177 --> 03:21:53.037]  We're good to go.
[03:21:53.197 --> 03:21:54.158]  We're good to go.
[03:21:54.358 --> 03:21:54.878]  We're good to go.
[03:21:54.898 --> 03:21:55.459]  We're good to go.
[03:21:55.479 --> 03:21:56.379]  We're good to go.
[03:21:56.399 --> 03:21:56.740]  We're good to go.
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:57.200]  We're good to go.
[03:21:57.220 --> 03:21:57.600]  We're good to go.
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:21:58.040]  We're good to go.
[03:21:58.060 --> 03:21:58.701]  We're good to go.
[03:21:58.781 --> 03:21:59.421]  We're good to go.
[03:21:59.441 --> 03:21:59.841]  We're good to go.
[03:21:59.881 --> 03:22:00.422]  We're good to go.
[03:22:00.442 --> 03:22:00.922]  We're good to go.
[03:22:00.942 --> 03:22:01.462]  We're good to go.
[03:22:01.482 --> 03:22:02.023]  We're good to go.
[03:22:02.043 --> 03:22:02.823]  We're good to go.
[03:22:03.023 --> 03:22:03.924]  We're good to go.
[03:22:03.944 --> 03:22:04.064]  We're
[03:22:08.007 --> 03:22:13.732]  You can experience why Caveman has, it's got thousands, thousands of five-star reviews from third-party reviewers.
[03:22:14.032 --> 03:22:22.178]  So you get it today for less, it's 50% off, 93% of respondents are saying that they would consider it for a friend, they would recommend it for a friend.
[03:22:22.218 --> 03:22:23.540]  Normally $59.95, now it's only $29.95.
[03:22:23.580 --> 03:22:24.500]  And if you get one of these things,
[03:22:29.787 --> 03:22:35.092]  It's got the super nutrients, it's got the bee pollen, it's got the bone broth, turmeric root, the chaga mushroom.
[03:22:35.413 --> 03:22:37.315]  You guys, you know the list by now, right?
[03:22:37.895 --> 03:22:48.246]  So, what I like to do is when I'm doing my workouts, when I'm doing heavy weights, I'll go and make a strong protein shake and that is when I'll drop in
[03:22:49.252 --> 03:22:53.756]  Probably about 20 minutes, 30 minutes after my workout, I'll go for the protein.
[03:22:53.816 --> 03:22:54.897]  I'll make a shake out of it.
[03:22:55.098 --> 03:23:00.923]  Now what I like to do is make one beforehand, get it ready, keep it in the fridge, get home from the gym, and then I have it right afterwards.
[03:23:01.083 --> 03:23:04.006]  It's so perfect for right after that.
[03:23:04.046 --> 03:23:10.072]  If you guys are looking for that paleo nutrition and the protein, this is exactly what you're going to get.
[03:23:11.933 --> 03:23:12.674]  It's wonderful.
[03:23:12.994 --> 03:23:15.756]  Now there's some of the other specials, you guys, they were just showing on the screen there.
[03:23:16.076 --> 03:23:23.061]  It's vitamin and mineral fusion, 50% off with the free shipping, the super blue, the fluoride free mouthwash, actually, not just the.
[03:23:24.361 --> 03:23:28.722]  Not just the toothpaste, but actually the mouthwash, 50% off, DNA Force and Secret 12.
[03:23:29.022 --> 03:23:30.742]  So there's tons of specials.
[03:23:30.782 --> 03:23:33.063]  Z-Shield as well, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:23:33.543 --> 03:23:35.063]  Make sure that you can go in there, guys.
[03:23:35.123 --> 03:23:35.583]  Check it out.
[03:23:35.663 --> 03:23:36.523]  Inbow Wars store.
[03:23:36.743 --> 03:23:39.144]  It's only $9.95 for a bottle.
[03:23:39.164 --> 03:23:39.844]  And this is a big bottle.
[03:23:39.864 --> 03:23:40.464]  It's not a little bottle.
[03:23:40.484 --> 03:23:41.244]  It's a big bottle.
[03:23:41.264 --> 03:23:41.584]  16 ounces.
[03:23:42.004 --> 03:23:43.405]  Not 8 ounces, not 6 ounces.
[03:23:43.425 --> 03:23:44.265]  It's a big bottle.
[03:23:44.305 --> 03:23:45.725]  You can't take this on an airplane.
[03:23:46.625 --> 03:23:47.726]  You could put it in a smaller bottle.
[03:23:47.766 --> 03:23:48.666]  You could put that on the airplane.
[03:23:48.706 --> 03:23:49.766]  You can't take that on an airplane.
[03:23:50.146 --> 03:23:50.807]  This is a big bottle.
[03:23:51.147 --> 03:23:53.408]  So for just $9.95, less than $10, right?
[03:23:53.808 --> 03:23:54.489]  It's not too bad.
[03:23:54.589 --> 03:23:59.432]  But as we're waiting here, and I've got the producers checking out the White House.
[03:23:59.472 --> 03:24:04.435]  They've got a live feed on the White House to make sure that we haven't missed any of the President's announcement.
[03:24:04.936 --> 03:24:07.897]  I want to break down some of the other news that we're focusing on now.
[03:24:08.398 --> 03:24:10.979]  Another big story yesterday was this
[03:24:12.180 --> 03:24:14.181]  Jeff Sessions' testimony before the House.
[03:24:14.821 --> 03:24:19.684]  And Jeff Sessions gave his testimony, essentially was an update.
[03:24:19.844 --> 03:24:22.805]  He was grilled a lot on ongoing investigations.
[03:24:22.865 --> 03:24:24.966]  Obviously, he can't talk about ongoing investigations.
[03:24:25.006 --> 03:24:26.167]  They tried to give it on record anyway.
[03:24:26.487 --> 03:24:36.612]  They asked him a lot about these new revelations that have come forward of George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, people who were loosely affiliated with the Trump campaign.
[03:24:36.632 --> 03:24:37.452]  They were volunteers.
[03:24:37.472 --> 03:24:38.353]  They were never on staff.
[03:24:38.393 --> 03:24:40.013]  They didn't have Trump campaign emails.
[03:24:40.354 --> 03:24:41.154]  But they have made
[03:24:42.054 --> 03:24:51.151]  Have potentially made some outreaches to the Russian state to people that were involved with the Russian government.
[03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:58.894]  Sessions specifically mentioned that when he heard Papadopoulos do this, he tried to shut him down and said, do not do that.
[03:24:59.314 --> 03:25:00.855]  Do not represent the campaign.
[03:25:00.935 --> 03:25:04.477]  You don't represent the campaign and do not reach out to anyone on our behalf.
[03:25:04.997 --> 03:25:14.763]  However, he apparently did so anyway, and then lied to investigators about it, thereby striking essentially a plea deal with Mueller, as many people have surmised on that fact.
[03:25:15.683 --> 03:25:33.416]  So a lot of people wonder, when is Jeff Sessions, or could Jeff Sessions, call for a special prosecutor on the Uranium One sale to Russia, a special prosecutor to look into this situation, and the fact that the FBI apparently knew about the situation.
[03:25:33.456 --> 03:25:45.244]  So Jeff Sessions has directed staff at the Department of Justice, this just broke a few days ago, right before, on the eve of his testimony, and of course they didn't ask him very much about it at the testimony of the hearing itself, he directed
[03:25:46.656 --> 03:25:55.921]  Employees directed staff at the Department of Justice to look into what exactly was going on at the FBI and the DOJ during the Uranium One sale.
[03:25:56.261 --> 03:25:57.562]  Why are there is any culpability?
[03:25:57.602 --> 03:26:10.309]  Louie Gohmert, a House representative himself, also brought forward a signed document indicating that Rod Rosenstein had actually filed a
[03:26:12.601 --> 03:26:18.625]  Essentially filed a document, a blanket document, sealing all the records of the Uranium One investigation.
[03:26:18.945 --> 03:26:24.248]  So Rosenstein, this is back in 2014, and Gohmert Holt held this up on Fox News yesterday, breaking huge story.
[03:26:24.288 --> 03:26:31.772]  He had the actual document of Rosenstein signing off to seal essentially all records pertaining to the Uranium One investigation.
[03:26:31.792 --> 03:26:34.373]  Now Rosenstein is currently the deputy AG.
[03:26:34.734 --> 03:26:36.475]  How does this tie back into the news cycle?
[03:26:36.515 --> 03:26:38.656]  Well, it's actually very interesting because
[03:26:39.921 --> 03:26:57.545]  Mitch McConnell right now, who is very much leading the political charge to tell Roy Moore to step out of the race, has publicly floated the idea of having Jeff Sessions' name be written in by Alabama voters on the ballots come December 12th for the special election.
[03:26:57.845 --> 03:27:03.966]  So he's publicly floating the idea of Jeff Sessions running himself to replace Jeff Sessions
[03:27:05.149 --> 03:27:05.369]  I don't
[03:27:20.470 --> 03:27:23.872]  In the first place, which set up the entire special election.
[03:27:24.192 --> 03:27:25.933]  So round and round we go.
[03:27:26.133 --> 03:27:28.294]  And this is a typical swamp move.
[03:27:28.575 --> 03:27:31.396]  They're trying to get rid of Sessions as Attorney General.
[03:27:31.956 --> 03:27:36.119]  And they've basically neutered him at this point because he's clearly compromised.
[03:27:36.359 --> 03:27:40.961]  He's recused himself from any investigation of merit at the Attorney General's post.
[03:27:41.322 --> 03:27:45.144]  And now they're trying to say, OK, Jeff, you go back to your seat.
[03:27:46.044 --> 03:27:46.965]  Well, think about that.
[03:27:47.305 --> 03:27:49.026]  If Jeff Sessions goes back to his seat,
[03:27:49.696 --> 03:27:51.277]  Then what happens to the Attorney General?
[03:27:52.417 --> 03:28:02.821]  Well, if Jess Sessions went back to his seat, then the Attorney General would go to the Deputy Attorney General, would become the Acting Attorney General, like we had with the Sally Yates situation.
[03:28:02.921 --> 03:28:08.222]  Only in this case, it would be Rod Rosenstein, who's the current Deputy AG.
[03:28:08.663 --> 03:28:09.843]  So if Sessions vacates,
[03:28:10.646 --> 03:28:27.484]  But until they can get someone as appointed all the way through the Senate confirmation process, which is, of course, again controlled by Mitch McConnell, their own man, Rod Rosenstein, himself tied to the Uranium One investigation, would be, for all intents and purposes, the acting Attorney General.
[03:28:27.745 --> 03:28:30.748]  And that is why many have called to say, how do we get out of this situation?
[03:28:30.788 --> 03:28:31.629]  How does Trump get out of it?
[03:28:32.129 --> 03:28:33.210]  They said, you know what?
[03:28:33.570 --> 03:28:34.671]  Have Sessions resign.
[03:28:35.151 --> 03:28:36.252]  Fire Rosenstein.
[03:28:36.372 --> 03:28:38.133]  Fire Andrew McCabe at the FBI.
[03:28:38.193 --> 03:28:42.736]  Get all of these guys out of there and go for a clean sweep approach.
[03:28:42.817 --> 03:28:43.937]  No one will have to recuse.
[03:28:44.157 --> 03:28:54.084]  And we can actually have investigations of merit into the politicization of the DOJ and the FBI during the election and possibly prior to the cover-up of Uranium One.
[03:28:54.505 --> 03:28:59.228]  That is what the president should do in order to break through this logjam.
[03:28:59.268 --> 03:28:59.748]  Stay tuned.
[03:28:59.828 --> 03:29:00.889]  President Trump coming up next.
[03:29:01.946 --> 03:29:04.109]  We confirm suspicions, Ed Veritas.
[03:29:04.169 --> 03:29:10.376]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:29:10.796 --> 03:29:13.479]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:29:13.700 --> 03:29:18.005]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:29:18.425 --> 03:29:38.672]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYCTerroristAttack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[03:29:39.552 --> 03:29:42.094]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[03:29:42.154 --> 03:29:43.835]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:29:44.055 --> 03:29:53.900]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:29:54.220 --> 03:29:58.183]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[03:29:59.628 --> 03:30:01.530]  This information being weaponized.
[03:30:01.590 --> 03:30:03.832]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:30:04.272 --> 03:30:08.796]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[03:30:09.316 --> 03:30:10.637]  I will not let you down.
[03:30:10.797 --> 03:30:13.700]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:30:14.120 --> 03:30:15.722]  How quickly can you act?
[03:30:16.042 --> 03:30:21.647]  And what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[03:30:23.233 --> 03:30:30.861]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[03:30:40.169 --> 03:30:46.752]  You have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[03:30:47.872 --> 03:30:50.393]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[03:30:50.753 --> 03:30:51.854]  The system self-corrected.
[03:30:51.974 --> 03:30:54.835]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:30:54.855 --> 03:30:57.076]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:30:58.256 --> 03:30:59.057]  But you saw this?
[03:30:59.257 --> 03:30:59.997]  USA Today.
[03:31:00.417 --> 03:31:01.518]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:31:01.678 --> 03:31:04.059]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:31:04.099 --> 03:31:05.239]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:31:05.439 --> 03:31:07.020]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:08.881]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:31:08.901 --> 03:31:16.505]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[03:31:16.525 --> 03:31:21.988]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[03:31:25.150 --> 03:31:29.112]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:31:30.173 --> 03:31:31.374]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:31:32.625 --> 03:31:35.387]  We are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[03:31:36.328 --> 03:31:48.339]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone, because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the probiotic, Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.
[03:31:50.370 --> 03:31:54.454]  Super Blue Colloidal Silver Fluoride Free Mouthwash, 50% off.
[03:31:54.494 --> 03:31:56.215]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, still 50% off.
[03:31:56.535 --> 03:31:59.358]  But we've added Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[03:31:59.378 --> 03:32:01.480]  It's so amazing that people love so much.
[03:32:02.060 --> 03:32:03.521]  That's 50% off as well.
[03:32:03.721 --> 03:32:05.243]  Free shipping, it's got to end.
[03:32:05.623 --> 03:32:09.086]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[03:32:09.366 --> 03:32:11.088]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.
[03:32:11.168 --> 03:32:14.671]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our best seller, that I personally wear
[03:32:15.151 --> 03:32:17.253]  Around town now is my favorite shirt of all time.
[03:32:17.413 --> 03:32:23.978]  It says, Won't Thread on Me, InfoWars.com on the right-hand shoulder of the American flag, InfoWars.com on the back.
[03:32:24.658 --> 03:32:28.001]  Really soft, great fabric, and it helps fund our operation.
[03:32:28.341 --> 03:32:39.630]  And it's got the Gadsden snake, just simply as the snake, very iconic, with InfoWars.com in Dayglo yellow on the back, and InfoWars.com with the American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[03:32:39.690 --> 03:32:40.651]  We also have InfoWars
[03:32:41.471 --> 03:32:43.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.065 --> 03:33:15.646]  News.
[03:33:16.167 --> 03:33:17.008]  Analysis.
[03:33:17.509 --> 03:33:18.190]  Reports.
[03:33:18.931 --> 03:33:21.013]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:30.109 --> 03:33:41.497]  Showed very well our country is further evidence that America's renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now.
[03:33:42.438 --> 03:33:50.844]  When we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values, other nations are confident in us.
[03:33:51.624 --> 03:33:55.127]  And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve,
[03:33:55.727 --> 03:34:02.230]  Other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.
[03:34:02.970 --> 03:34:07.672]  During our travels, this is exactly what the world saw.
[03:34:07.692 --> 03:34:12.494]  A strong, proud, and confident America.
[03:34:13.414 --> 03:34:23.723]  Today I want to update the American people on the tremendous success of this trip and the progress we've made to advance American security and prosperity throughout the year.
[03:34:24.324 --> 03:34:30.449]  When I came into office, our country was faced with a series of growing dangers.
[03:34:31.050 --> 03:34:32.351]  These threats included
[03:34:32.911 --> 03:34:53.307]  Rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons, foreign powers challenging America's influence, the spread of the murderous terror group ISIS, and years of unfair trade practices that had dangerously depleted our manufacturing base and wiped out millions and millions of middle-class jobs.
[03:34:54.068 --> 03:35:06.198]  The challenges were inherited and these products really showed what previous mistakes were made over many years and even decades by other administrations.
[03:35:06.799 --> 03:35:10.402]  Some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect.
[03:35:11.103 --> 03:35:14.485]  Others from naive thinking and misguided judgment.
[03:35:15.346 --> 03:35:22.192]  In some cases, the negative influence of partisan politics and special interests was to blame.
[03:35:22.887 --> 03:35:35.370]  But the one common thread behind all of these problems was a failure to protect and promote the interests of the American people and American workers.
[03:35:36.211 --> 03:35:41.352]  Upon my inauguration, I pledged that we would rebuild America, restore its economic strength,
[03:35:41.952 --> 03:35:44.393]  And defend its national security.
[03:35:44.833 --> 03:35:53.136]  With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals.
[03:35:53.316 --> 03:36:02.760]  Above all, I swore that in every decision, with every action, I would put the best interests of the American people first.
[03:36:03.460 --> 03:36:11.885]  Over the past 10 months, traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done.
[03:36:12.665 --> 03:36:27.533]  Earlier this year, in Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations about our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing, territory, and ideological support.
[03:36:28.093 --> 03:36:30.455]  And I urge the leaders to drive out
[03:36:31.095 --> 03:36:31.656]  Thank you.
[03:36:51.252 --> 03:36:52.133]  We're good to go.
[03:37:09.814 --> 03:37:16.038]  Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative.
[03:37:16.639 --> 03:37:21.222]  NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.
[03:37:22.501 --> 03:37:32.469]  In Warsaw, I declared to the world America's resolve to preserve and protect Western civilization and the values we hold so dear.
[03:37:33.190 --> 03:37:42.898]  In Rome, Sicily, Hamburg, and Paris, I strengthened our friendships with key allies to promote our shared interests of security and prosperity.
[03:37:42.938 --> 03:37:48.042]  So, I just want to say, compare this with how Obama acted when he went around the world.
[03:37:48.462 --> 03:38:02.711]  President Trump there telling us about all of the great accomplishments he's made around the world, all of the wonderful praise and celebration that he's been receiving from so many of these countries, from so many of these foreign leaders.
[03:38:03.011 --> 03:38:04.292]  And I'd love to contrast that.
[03:38:04.552 --> 03:38:09.235]  You know, everyone remembers the apology tour that Obama took when he first became president.
[03:38:09.496 --> 03:38:11.197]  That's what President Trump is doing here.
[03:38:11.897 --> 03:38:17.141]  He's telling people that this is what was done during
[03:38:18.228 --> 03:38:23.291]  During the last presidency and now the difference that's being done during this presidency.
[03:38:23.551 --> 03:38:24.872]  Our producers are still going to listen.
[03:38:24.912 --> 03:38:28.013]  If there is a bigger announcement, we're going to cut back to the president.
[03:38:28.034 --> 03:38:31.936]  But I want to focus on that for people so that you can really put up the contrast.
[03:38:31.956 --> 03:38:33.857]  And he's not saying it because he doesn't have to, right?
[03:38:34.157 --> 03:38:35.878]  The President Trump doesn't have to say.
[03:38:36.949 --> 03:38:37.209]  That's
[03:38:55.031 --> 03:39:02.097]  They made him come out from like the small part of the airplane and go down the steps on the back because they didn't even give him the full size of it.
[03:39:02.137 --> 03:39:11.484]  Now speaking of someone who lived in China for two years, who speaks fluent Mandarin, I can tell you, the Chinese, with China, your standing, it all comes down to your etiquette.
[03:39:11.805 --> 03:39:14.607]  It all comes down to how you're received.
[03:39:15.470 --> 03:39:18.153]  The way that they received Obama was shameful.
[03:39:18.253 --> 03:39:19.014]  It was a joke.
[03:39:19.054 --> 03:39:20.695]  They were making fun of him.
[03:39:20.735 --> 03:39:21.876]  They were making light of him.
[03:39:22.137 --> 03:39:28.082]  When President Trump went there, they not only rolled out the red carpet, they brought him to dine inside the Forbidden City.
[03:39:28.102 --> 03:39:37.191]  The Forbidden City in Beijing, just adjacent to Tiananmen Square, behind the Tianan Gate, that was originally, I mean, it was forbidden.
[03:39:37.231 --> 03:39:39.794]  That was only the area for the prince's
[03:39:40.274 --> 03:39:49.640]  The kings, the rulers, the elite, they brought President Trump into that area and fed him and let him eat there with Melania.
[03:39:50.761 --> 03:39:59.547]  The only thing, the only thing, the one little point that I personally had wished would happen, the only thing that I wish would have happened on that China trip, and it was a great trip,
[03:40:00.521 --> 03:40:02.423]  Why didn't President Trump go to the wall?
[03:40:02.863 --> 03:40:04.705]  Why didn't he go to the Great Wall of China?
[03:40:04.745 --> 03:40:12.652]  You think that would have been one of, you know, like a no-brainer kind of thing, and I'd like to hear what the thought process was on that, but come on!
[03:40:13.012 --> 03:40:24.342]  So he was going down to ASEAN, he continued on his trip to Vietnam and the Philippines, and Melania actually went and toured the wall herself, but man, how amazing would it have been to see
[03:40:25.350 --> 03:40:27.072]  Right, then we would have memes for days on that.
[03:40:27.352 --> 03:40:35.201]  If President Trump was going and traveling the Great Wall of China, you know, basically looking there and saying, yes, I can get some ideas now.
[03:40:36.403 --> 03:40:44.091]  But what an amazing, and maybe it was just a schedule thing, I'm not sure, but what an amazing response that he got from Vietnam, what he got from the Philippines.
[03:40:44.151 --> 03:40:44.672]  In Vietnam,
[03:40:45.583 --> 03:40:48.584]  And the video of this is so hard to find because the mainstream media barely showed it.
[03:40:49.365 --> 03:40:54.447]  They thronged the streets as he came into Hanoi there, the capital of Vietnam.
[03:40:54.707 --> 03:41:01.810]  There were people cheering, there were people lining the streets, thousands and thousands of them to meet the president.
[03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:05.952]  And now a key read on this, a very, very key read on this.
[03:41:06.971 --> 03:41:08.952]  That is to understand one very specific thing.
[03:41:09.452 --> 03:41:15.194]  Because what is the biggest challenge that the President is taking on in Asia-Pacific region right now?
[03:41:15.675 --> 03:41:18.516]  The biggest challenge he's taking on is North Korea.
[03:41:18.576 --> 03:41:24.918]  He's clearly made that one of the major focuses of his presidency, and certainly in his diplomacy.
[03:41:25.158 --> 03:41:26.739]  He's letting the military focus on ISIS.
[03:41:26.779 --> 03:41:31.421]  Our military is focusing on ISIS, but he is personally focused so much on Kim Jong-un.
[03:41:31.441 --> 03:41:36.103]  We all saw that tweet, the short and fat tweet, or never call him short and fat.
[03:41:36.543 --> 03:41:36.743]  Right?
[03:41:37.064 --> 03:41:40.486]  So how does it make Kim Jong-un feel?
[03:41:40.566 --> 03:41:42.127]  Because you know he's watching this speech.
[03:41:42.468 --> 03:41:43.849]  You know he's watching this trip.
[03:41:44.149 --> 03:41:45.130]  He's watching the reception.
[03:41:45.190 --> 03:42:04.564]  How does it make him feel when all the leaders of Asia, from Putin to Xi to Moon in South Korea to the leaders of Vietnam to leaders of the Philippines, the leaders of Japan, they all are showing so much respect and so much praise to President Trump.
[03:42:05.507 --> 03:42:07.008]  So guess what, Kim?
[03:42:07.408 --> 03:42:09.450]  All of your neighbors are on our side.
[03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:34.806]  So if every single person around you, who's normally your biggest patrons and your biggest supporters, the people that are your lifeblood out to the rest of the world because you live in this hermit kingdom where you're building nukes and trying to launch them around and hit us with your TD to your Taepodong-2 missiles, how does it make you feel when every single one in your neighborhood, right, that normally helps you out and protects you, is now showing respect to President Trump?
[03:42:35.504 --> 03:42:38.267]  That, my friends, is how you do diplomacy.
[03:42:38.667 --> 03:42:43.892]  That is how you show respect and how you use that leverage against Kim Jong-un.
[03:42:44.112 --> 03:42:44.753]  We're going to come back.
[03:42:44.773 --> 03:42:46.614]  We're going to go to a quick break here.
[03:42:46.634 --> 03:43:01.008]  We're going to come back and finish out the hour, and we will let you know if there's any developments or specific announcements coming from the president, but giving us a great rundown of all the change in American foreign policy from the Obama administration to President Trump.
[03:43:01.488 --> 03:43:05.830]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[03:43:06.290 --> 03:43:11.332]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[03:43:11.873 --> 03:43:15.794]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[03:43:15.834 --> 03:43:19.136]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[03:43:19.796 --> 03:43:24.238]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm gonna follow for the first time ever.
[03:43:24.898 --> 03:43:28.140]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[03:43:28.840 --> 03:43:30.381]  I came in here an hour ago.
[03:43:31.121 --> 03:43:38.362]  And I literally just went to InfoWarsStore.com and printed the five-star reviews, the first few pages.
[03:43:38.662 --> 03:43:42.463]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[03:43:43.043 --> 03:43:46.524]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[03:43:46.884 --> 03:43:48.584]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[03:43:49.045 --> 03:43:55.346]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:43:55.406 --> 03:43:56.306]  Let's go over them right now.
[03:43:56.846 --> 03:43:58.367]  This is verified by our Mark.
[03:43:58.547 --> 03:44:01.488]  Five-star review for Anthroplex is for men and women.
[03:44:01.988 --> 03:44:03.028]  I take it as directed.
[03:44:03.048 --> 03:44:13.932]  As is, one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[03:44:14.492 --> 03:44:15.173]  Easy does it.
[03:44:15.253 --> 03:44:16.273]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[03:44:16.293 --> 03:44:17.233]  It's very, very serious.
[03:44:17.654 --> 03:44:18.074]  Not a game.
[03:44:18.094 --> 03:44:18.494]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:44:19.014 --> 03:44:20.295]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[03:44:20.435 --> 03:44:21.216]  Energy all day.
[03:44:21.236 --> 03:44:28.963]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[03:44:29.403 --> 03:44:30.104]  Another review.
[03:44:30.124 --> 03:44:31.125]  I love this one.
[03:44:31.425 --> 03:44:33.867]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[03:44:34.248 --> 03:44:37.771]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[03:44:38.051 --> 03:44:40.974]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[03:44:41.354 --> 03:44:42.876]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:43.277 --> 03:44:46.642]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[03:44:46.922 --> 03:44:50.107]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[03:44:50.167 --> 03:44:54.894]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[03:44:55.034 --> 03:44:55.995]  Amazing product.
[03:44:56.736 --> 03:44:58.817]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[03:44:59.237 --> 03:45:00.237]  Here's one from Brian.
[03:45:00.558 --> 03:45:02.638]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[03:45:02.758 --> 03:45:03.579]  Thank you all.
[03:45:03.979 --> 03:45:07.640]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[03:45:07.700 --> 03:45:09.921]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[03:45:10.321 --> 03:45:12.262]  Every night owl should have this product.
[03:45:12.762 --> 03:45:16.203]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[03:45:16.443 --> 03:45:17.104]  And I should add,
[03:45:17.904 --> 03:45:19.045]  That's a great name for this product.
[03:45:19.285 --> 03:45:21.106]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[03:45:21.126 --> 03:45:22.867]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[03:45:23.187 --> 03:45:24.528]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[03:45:24.608 --> 03:45:26.209]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[03:45:26.249 --> 03:45:26.809]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[03:45:27.050 --> 03:45:27.810]  I said I'd shut up!
[03:45:28.731 --> 03:45:29.491]  But back to the script.
[03:45:29.851 --> 03:45:31.732]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[03:45:31.752 --> 03:45:32.493]  I love that name too.
[03:45:32.913 --> 03:45:34.954]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[03:45:35.254 --> 03:45:39.457]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[03:45:39.497 --> 03:45:42.059]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[03:45:42.119 --> 03:45:43.559]  You make it literally possible.
[03:45:44.600 --> 03:45:49.426]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[03:45:49.946 --> 03:45:52.769]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[03:45:53.050 --> 03:45:56.614]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[03:45:57.134 --> 03:45:59.357]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though.
[03:45:59.577 --> 03:46:02.839]  So, I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[03:46:03.179 --> 03:46:05.281]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[03:46:05.621 --> 03:46:11.485]  Whenever I feel the first traces of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always been in the dip before it starts.
[03:46:11.905 --> 03:46:17.649]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[03:46:18.129 --> 03:46:24.534]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[03:46:24.794 --> 03:46:25.614]  It's all a win-win.
[03:46:25.775 --> 03:46:26.655]  That's an awesome review.
[03:46:26.715 --> 03:46:29.497]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[03:46:29.917 --> 03:46:31.978]  We've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[03:46:32.038 --> 03:46:34.999]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Cayman reviews.
[03:46:35.019 --> 03:46:36.200]  They're all five-star.
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:41.802]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[03:46:42.442 --> 03:46:45.723]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[03:46:46.024 --> 03:46:47.824]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[03:46:48.124 --> 03:46:51.646]  Find it all, folks, at m4warsstore.com or m4warslife.com.
[03:46:51.666 --> 03:46:56.808]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[03:47:04.899 --> 03:47:07.507]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.653 --> 03:47:28.815]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:29.275 --> 03:47:38.802]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:47:38.842 --> 03:47:39.802]  Jack Pasovic here.
[03:47:40.423 --> 03:47:43.645]  Big fourth hour today, breaking down everything.
[03:47:44.548 --> 03:47:57.234]  President Trump finishing up a great speech today, telling us all about the absolute and utter turnaround in American foreign policy following the disaster of Barack Obama.
[03:47:57.254 --> 03:48:00.816]  He's now giving that statement right now, explaining that America is back.
[03:48:01.216 --> 03:48:05.819]  The United States of America has retained its position in the United States.
[03:48:05.899 --> 03:48:07.099]  It's standing in the United States.
[03:48:07.379 --> 03:48:11.701]  He's there giving an excellent speech today, letting everyone know
[03:48:13.358 --> 03:48:14.918]  The amazing work that he's doing.
[03:48:14.958 --> 03:48:17.279]  Now, somebody sent me a text message during the break.
[03:48:17.299 --> 03:48:33.482]  They said, Jack, how much do you want to bet that the first question the media asks him after, you know, he's talking about all of the accomplishments that he's made and talking about all of the things that he's doing on behalf of the country around the world, and how much do you want to bet the first question any reporter asks is going to be about Roy Moore?
[03:48:33.502 --> 03:48:37.043]  And I wrote back, you should drink every time that they say Roy Moore.
[03:48:37.083 --> 03:48:39.143]  Because you know, that's what the media is, right?
[03:48:39.972 --> 03:48:41.833]  President Trump didn't endorse Roy Moore.
[03:48:42.213 --> 03:48:44.175]  President Trump didn't campaign for Roy Moore.
[03:48:44.735 --> 03:48:46.196]  Uh, he actually campaigned for the other guy.
[03:48:46.216 --> 03:48:48.257]  I went to the rally, uh, myself personally.
[03:48:48.277 --> 03:48:50.478]  He campaigned for Larr- er, Lar- what's the guy's name?
[03:48:50.518 --> 03:48:50.858]  Larry?
[03:48:51.039 --> 03:48:51.339]  Larry?
[03:48:51.479 --> 03:48:52.039]  Larry Strange?
[03:48:52.339 --> 03:48:52.880]  Larry Strange?
[03:48:53.740 --> 03:48:54.320]  Larry Strange.
[03:48:54.340 --> 03:48:55.041]  Larry Strange, yeah.
[03:48:56.102 --> 03:48:57.442]  And, uh, I couldn't even remember the guy's name.
[03:48:57.462 --> 03:48:58.443]  I just remember he was strange.
[03:48:58.543 --> 03:48:58.923]  Big guy.
[03:48:59.003 --> 03:48:59.363]  Big guy.
[03:48:59.383 --> 03:49:00.024]  Big- oh, Luther!
[03:49:00.084 --> 03:49:00.644]  No, Luther!
[03:49:00.724 --> 03:49:01.425]  Luther Strange.
[03:49:02.625 --> 03:49:03.606]  It was Luther Strange.
[03:49:03.666 --> 03:49:04.426]  Right, Big Luther.
[03:49:04.807 --> 03:49:05.487]  Right, Big Luther.
[03:49:05.507 --> 03:49:06.388]  See, you can't even remember the guy.
[03:49:06.408 --> 03:49:06.928]  It's forgetful.
[03:49:07.942 --> 03:49:08.703]  But, forgettable.
[03:49:09.143 --> 03:49:18.211]  But, what I also want to point out though, is that the President arrives back to the United States, back to Washington D.C., and he's under attack.
[03:49:18.952 --> 03:49:30.341]  He's under attack by Robert Mueller, and it's now been revealed, and this is actually breaking news today, it's actually completely exposed now as nothing but a partisan witch hunt.
[03:49:30.782 --> 03:49:32.363]  Because David Brock
[03:49:33.058 --> 03:49:43.570]  As we all know, who is essentially an agent of George Soros here in this country, is going to be starting a new super PAC project to support Mueller.
[03:49:43.971 --> 03:49:45.312]  Now think about that for a second.
[03:49:46.654 --> 03:49:52.741]  Mueller is supposed to be objectively investigating any issue of collusion with Russia, right?
[03:49:53.069 --> 03:49:57.273]  This is supposed to be a non-partisan... Oh, goodness, look at that picture of David Brock.
[03:49:57.333 --> 03:49:58.915]  Just, just, just, just look at that.
[03:49:58.935 --> 03:50:00.216]  I don't even, I, guys, I can't even look at it.
[03:50:00.236 --> 03:50:00.916]  You gotta take it away.
[03:50:01.257 --> 03:50:01.957]  You gotta take it away.
[03:50:01.977 --> 03:50:03.199]  I can't, I can't look at it.
[03:50:03.279 --> 03:50:03.939]  I can't look at it.
[03:50:04.219 --> 03:50:11.046]  So, so David Brock, he's, he's paying this, or he's using the Super PAC money to now promote
[03:50:12.708 --> 03:50:17.393]  The Mueller investigation to promote Mueller's efforts like it's some kind of political campaign.
[03:50:17.833 --> 03:50:20.656]  So can super PAC money be used?
[03:50:21.056 --> 03:50:23.138]  They're talking about running social media ads.
[03:50:23.439 --> 03:50:32.768]  They're talking about organizing grassroots volunteers for I don't even know what to support Mueller as if Mueller is running for president or running for something.
[03:50:33.028 --> 03:50:36.652]  Well, essentially what they're going to be doing is completely perverting
[03:50:37.549 --> 03:50:37.949]  We're good to go.
[03:51:01.155 --> 03:51:01.375]  Right?
[03:51:02.156 --> 03:51:09.862]  Political operatives in the entire country, David Brock, who has trouble paying his taxes, and put him, tie him with Robert Mueller.
[03:51:09.922 --> 03:51:19.769]  This shows quite clearly that Robert Mueller's investigation is nothing than what the president stated himself, other than a partisan witch hunt designed to take him out.
[03:51:19.789 --> 03:51:22.892]  This is a really, really bad move by the Democrats.
[03:51:23.492 --> 03:51:29.797]  At this, up until this point, Mueller, we know that there had been some talk of him investigating Tony Podesta, also going after
[03:51:30.497 --> 03:51:34.180]  Um, Paul Manafort filing charges a few weeks ago.
[03:51:34.500 --> 03:51:40.065]  My sources have told me that Tony Podesta, who had committed the same infraction as
[03:51:41.101 --> 03:51:58.668]  As Manafort, however, Podesta, my sources are telling me, is working as a cooperating witness, possibly to avoid prosecution himself, but is working at a deal and has stepped down as CEO of the Podesta Group, as well as one of his top staffers there is also stepping down.
[03:51:58.988 --> 03:52:04.791]  So it remains to be seen whether he pleads guilty in a similar way as George Papadopoulos.
[03:52:05.131 --> 03:52:11.715]  But it has now been completely exposed that it is nothing other than a partisan witch hunt, which is what president told us, told us from the start.
[03:52:12.095 --> 03:52:21.041]  Why would this far left, alt left, you would even say, media group, this political group, be supporting the investigation?
[03:52:21.221 --> 03:52:23.743]  So it's clearly shown that Mueller is nothing but an arm
[03:52:24.363 --> 03:52:25.023]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:40.169 --> 03:52:49.476]  An investigation, getting involved in the investigative process in terms of advertising, certainly sounds like it's being done to poison the well of public opinion.
[03:52:50.076 --> 03:53:04.806]  So talking about poisoning the well of public opinion, I want to talk about, right before we end the show today, or end this hour I should say, before War Room comes up right after me with the great Owen Shoyer, is the Poland Independence Day March, which was held last week, November 11th.
[03:53:05.307 --> 03:53:07.988]  Now Poland was not a country 99 years ago.
[03:53:09.153 --> 03:53:16.145]  Poland did not get its independence until after World War I. Poland was essentially taken over and occupied.
[03:53:17.168 --> 03:53:23.630]  Then again, Poland was occupied by both the Nazis and the Communists during World War II in the year of 1939.
[03:53:24.851 --> 03:53:35.134]  So Poland, rightfully so, wants to hold a huge Independence Day parade because they still remember what it was like to not have a country within living memory.
[03:53:35.354 --> 03:53:39.756]  So of those 99 years they celebrated on November 11th, really only about 50 of them
[03:53:40.516 --> 03:53:41.336]  We're good to go.
[03:54:10.672 --> 03:54:13.093]  These are just regular Polish people.
[03:54:13.113 --> 03:54:22.438]  I was just there in Warsaw back in July, going there and celebrating their country, celebrating their National Day, the same way in the United States we have Independence Day parades.
[03:54:23.198 --> 03:54:29.981]  There is the President of Poland is marching with Polish soldiers on doing a review for Independence Day.
[03:54:30.001 --> 03:54:34.644]  Obviously, it's very cold, so they've got some fires lit for warmth.
[03:54:35.584 --> 03:54:37.425]  Again, Independence Day parade, right?
[03:54:38.692 --> 03:54:52.095]  Not anything to do with far extremism whatsoever, simply standing up for themselves, standing up for their country in terms of the Independence Day.
[03:54:52.635 --> 03:55:08.298]  But the mainstream media decided that because, well, there was this one group that showed up, and this one group had a couple signs that were held up that said, you know, and they even admitted that this group didn't even come from Poland, that they came from places like Germany, that they came in
[03:55:09.207 --> 03:55:14.709]  And we're holding up neo-Nazi type signs that the entire parade itself was a Nazi parade.
[03:55:15.209 --> 03:55:21.711]  And then they said that they were holding up signs that said they were called pray for an Islamic holocaust.
[03:55:22.171 --> 03:55:27.572]  Well I went through myself and looked at all the footage and I couldn't find anyone holding up a sign that said pray for Islamic holocaust.
[03:55:27.612 --> 03:55:32.974]  But the Washington Post said right in its headline that that's what the people of the parade were marching behind that banner.
[03:55:33.494 --> 03:55:37.238]  So I went around and around and I was looking for it and then one of my sources in Poland reached out to me.
[03:55:37.258 --> 03:55:41.622]  I was there in July, met a lot of people, going back there, planning to go back there soon.
[03:55:42.802 --> 03:55:46.364]  And someone said, uh, well, Jack, that's because it wasn't there.
[03:55:46.684 --> 03:55:48.585]  It was there in 2015.
[03:55:49.265 --> 03:55:55.268]  Some people hung it over the side of a bridge and it had nothing to do with the 2017 parade.
[03:55:55.288 --> 03:55:59.649]  Uh, and, and, but apparently that was good enough for the Washington Post.
[03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:06.312]  So the Washington Post used the 2015 Islamic Holocaust banner to smear the 2017
[03:56:08.172 --> 03:56:09.234]  Independence Day Parade.
[03:56:09.274 --> 03:56:10.856]  This is actual fake news.
[03:56:10.896 --> 03:56:13.179]  And right there, Pray for an Islamic Holocaust.
[03:56:13.399 --> 03:56:16.383]  And you can see the headline from the Washington Post.
[03:56:16.403 --> 03:56:22.751]  But if our producers scroll down just a little bit, you can see the sign wasn't actually at the Independence Day Parade at all.
[03:56:23.112 --> 03:56:24.754]  There it is on the side of a building.
[03:56:24.974 --> 03:56:28.137]  And you look at the date just above it, 11-17-2015.
[03:56:29.578 --> 03:56:34.243]  The Washington Post actually manufacturing and printing fake news.
[03:56:34.303 --> 03:56:43.031]  The same fake news was then repeated by Newsweek and this guy, Jesse Larrick, who's a former Hillary Clinton staffer.
[03:56:43.331 --> 03:56:47.115]  So, again, they will spook to any level.
[03:56:47.921 --> 03:56:49.342]  They will put up fake pictures.
[03:56:49.763 --> 03:56:50.523]  They will lie.
[03:56:51.024 --> 03:56:51.925]  They will slander.
[03:56:52.005 --> 03:56:52.766]  They will use libel.
[03:56:52.806 --> 03:56:53.847]  They have no rules.
[03:56:54.247 --> 03:56:56.069]  They have no boundaries anymore.
[03:56:56.329 --> 03:56:59.352]  So people are saying, well, why doesn't the mainstream media have credibility?
[03:56:59.392 --> 03:57:01.794]  Because we keep catch them lying.
[03:57:01.854 --> 03:57:05.017]  We keep catch them spreading fake news and conspiracies.
[03:57:05.117 --> 03:57:05.938]  And that is what
[03:57:06.599 --> 03:57:08.980]  We are going to do here each and every day.
[03:57:09.480 --> 03:57:11.621]  That is what I'm going to do when I'm on the show.
[03:57:11.861 --> 03:57:13.962]  That is what War Room is going to do when they come up.
[03:57:14.002 --> 03:57:18.204]  We are going to show you the reporting on the media itself.
[03:57:18.464 --> 03:57:20.244]  We're going to call out their lies.
[03:57:20.464 --> 03:57:22.485]  We're going to call out their conspiracies.
[03:57:22.785 --> 03:57:32.369]  And we are going to say that anytime the mainstream media is presenting you with a headline that you should be skeptical of it the same way you should be skeptical of anything
[03:57:32.649 --> 03:57:32.989]  Just briefly,
[03:58:02.714 --> 03:58:04.715]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:58:04.735 --> 03:58:05.615]  He's about to retire.
[03:58:05.635 --> 03:58:12.579]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:58:12.659 --> 03:58:15.740]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:58:15.760 --> 03:58:16.740]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:58:17.261 --> 03:58:18.341]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:58:18.901 --> 03:58:21.383]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[03:58:21.403 --> 03:58:22.183]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:58:22.603 --> 03:58:24.584]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:58:24.804 --> 03:58:30.507]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:58:31.107 --> 03:58:31.567]  Exactly.
[03:58:31.627 --> 03:58:37.630]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:41.451]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[03:58:42.812 --> 03:58:49.554]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilic acid is a hopped up version of fluoride.
[03:58:49.774 --> 03:58:50.815]  It's been turned into an acid.
[03:58:51.155 --> 03:58:52.075]  It's an adjuvant.
[03:58:52.115 --> 03:58:52.815]  It's very toxic.
[03:58:53.155 --> 03:58:59.718]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQ
