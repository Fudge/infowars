[00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.488]  It's Thursday, July 13th, 2017.
[00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.110]  I'm your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.351]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:37.503]  President Donald Trump is on a mission to end human trafficking and punish the hell out of pedophiles.
[00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:52.072]  As three separate bills make it to the Senate, which will drastically untie the hands of law enforcement, border patrol, and homeland security in the battle against modern-day slavery and sex trafficking.
[00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:56.843]  Then, the Women's March is back!
[00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:01.444]  And this time, they are targeting the NRA.
[00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.164]  There are those of us who believe in freedom.
[00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:07.065]  Then there are those of you who actively burn down our country.
[00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:14.427]  All that, plus Roger Stone's defense strategy to annihilate the trumped-up DNC lawsuit.
[00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:19.348]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.185]  Okay.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.206]  We're good to go.
[00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:23.103]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:03.208]  Oh, no.
[00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:22.025]  Well, there's been one thing the media will not report about President Trump, and that is his commitment to fighting child trafficking.
[00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:31.935]  This is a commitment that he has been making since he became president, one he made even before he was president, even tweeting about the nasty, sick people that take kids.
[00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:36.079]  And this is something he's now taken up as President of the United States.
[00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.981]  This is from the White House Office of the Press Secretary.
[00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:40.823]  This was released yesterday.
[00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:44.765]  Statement from President Donald J. Trump on the passage of H.R.
[00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:46.606]  2664, H.R.
[00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:48.747]  2480, and H.R.
[00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:48.747]  2200.
[00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:59.113]  My administration is focused on ending the horrific practice of human trafficking, and the three bills the House of Representatives passed today are important steps forward.
[00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:06.838]  Since taking office, I have met with courageous survivors, non-profit groups, and faith leaders who are devoting tremendous energy
[00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:09.359]  To raising awareness about human trafficking.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.066]  I'm hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass these three bills as soon as possible and I look forward to my continued work with the Congress on this important issue.
[00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:27.533]  Well they got through the House pretty seamlessly and one would assume that these bills would move forward through the Senate seamlessly as well.
[00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:29.715]  These would be bills that you would assume
[00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:33.816]  I assume are non-partisan and everybody could get behind.
[00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.417]  Let's just do a quick highlight of the bills that I just mentioned.
[00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:39.578]  H.R.
[00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:39.578]  2664.
[00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:52.161]  Direct the Secretary of Labor to train certain Department of Labor personnel how to effectively detect and assist law enforcement in preventing human trafficking during the course of their primary roles and responsibilities.
[00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:57.403]  So basically, this act is going to be called the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act.
[00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:01.138]  It's pretty much what it says in the title.
[00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:13.166]  It looks like this is going to be training, you know, police officers, other law enforcement officers, people that are involved in law enforcement into the things that they need to be looking at on how to detect human trafficking.
[00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:32.113]  If I understand this one correctly...
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:44.862]  Now, I'm not sure if it's this one or the next one, but this is addressing grants, and this one is going to be entitled, Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act.
[00:05:45.182 --> 00:05:51.724]  I'm assuming they're talking about empowerment through grants and through other omnibus spending bills, so we'll see.
[00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.184]  Again, this has to pass the Senate.
[00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:56.005]  And then the last, H.R.
[00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.966]  2200, to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and for other purposes,
[00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:09.504]  This will be known as the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017.
[00:06:10.205 --> 00:06:12.467]  Now, this is the most loaded bill.
[00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:22.837]  This bill is dozens of titles, dozens of sections, another subtitle, Programs to Support Victims and Persons Vulnerable to Human Trafficking.
[00:06:23.218 --> 00:06:26.301]  So it looks like the aim of these three bills, each one has a different purpose.
[00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:39.884]  The first one is the purpose of getting law enforcement trained and ready and responsive legally, giving them the things that they need to detect and enforce human trafficking.
[00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:48.305]  And then HR 2480 to make sure that they get the funds that are directed specifically for these purposes of stopping human trafficking.
[00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:52.066]  And then the final one that I just mentioned is to actually help
[00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:54.629]  We'll keep our eye on that.
[00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:17.304]  Meanwhile, today, President Trump and Melania Trump went to France.
[00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.225]  Now, this was amazing to me.
[00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:23.186]  Obviously, there's a big difference between Macron and President Trump.
[00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:38.692]  Yet, President Trump, despite all the negative media and how they want to paint an inaccurate picture of him, is seeming to get along with these other world leaders that have a starkly different policy towards geopolitics, foreign policy, etc.
[00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:43.475]  But guys, if you just go back and roll that video real quick, I just want to point something out about this video.
[00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:59.208]  Now, this is just one video I found, but there's other videos that you can find as well out there, but this is a video of President Trump and Melania addressing members of the US military and their families in France, and there were also French people in the crowd as well.
[00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:04.413]  Now, as you can see, there's Trump hats, people are smiling, people are cheering.
[00:08:04.674 --> 00:08:05.595]  There's other pictures.
[00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:09.499]  Melania Trump was speaking French to children, relating to the children.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:16.527]  There's another video of both of them, President Trump and the First Lady, with the children of France, some of them having Make America Great Again hats on.
[00:08:16.907 --> 00:08:18.188]  So you've got all this going on.
[00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:28.570]  Really a positive day for President Trump in France, despite the disagreements he may have on policy with French's leaders, with the France leaders, still a positive thing.
[00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:35.875]  And even though it did look mighty awkward at times between him and Macron, he made this a positive visit and positive vibes came out of it.
[00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:38.817]  But see, the mainstream news can't have that, can they?
[00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:41.039]  They cannot give Donald Trump a win.
[00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:44.781]  They won't even cover him trying to stop child sex trafficking.
[00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:45.742]  They won't even cover that.
[00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:47.463]  But they'll cover him in France.
[00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:48.684]  But look at how they cover it, folks.
[00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:51.345]  This was the headline on the USA Today.
[00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:56.128]  Parisians turn up their noses on Trump visit.
[00:08:56.308 --> 00:08:57.489]  Parisians, excuse me.
[00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:13.978]  So, even though Trump was welcomed by the President of France and his wife, even though he got along today, even though it may have been a little awkward, and he goes and has speeches, he gets cheered, there's Make America Great Again hats on, people are smiling, people are cheering, and then the USA Today
[00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:21.503]  ...runs the fake news headline that the people in France, the people in Paris, are turning up their noses at Donald Trump.
[00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:25.106]  Unbelievable, the fake news level that they would go to.
[00:09:25.506 --> 00:09:27.388]  Now, USA Today wasn't the only people to do this.
[00:09:27.448 --> 00:09:32.032]  That exact, that exact headline was running on MSNBC today.
[00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:35.054]  I tried to get the screenshot and the image of that.
[00:09:35.154 --> 00:09:37.256]  Unfortunately, I was unable to.
[00:09:37.436 --> 00:09:41.279]  I was able to find another screenshot of MSNBC spreading fake news.
[00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:42.500]  Again, it's the same story.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.641]  So I just wanted to highlight this.
[00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:45.802]  Here's a screenshot from MSNBC.
[00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:47.364]  This is actually last month.
[00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:49.065]  Okay, you can see here.
[00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:51.167]  I just want to illustrate this because this is what they do.
[00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:55.847]  Trump sets more isolationist path for the United States.
[00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.227]  So that's the headline on MSNBC.
[00:09:57.507 --> 00:09:58.527]  Now let's look at the truth.
[00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:03.529]  This was a story that ran the exact same week MSNBC did that segment from Breitbart.
[00:10:04.109 --> 00:10:08.390]  Trump has had 50% more meetings with foreign leaders than Obama, okay?
[00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.150]  So this is what the fake news does.
[00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:19.573]  President Trump goes to France, has a great time in Paris, meets with the President of France, meets with people, people wearing Trump hats, and then what does the fake news mainstream media say?
[00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:21.674]  People in Paris don't like Trump.
[00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.156]  France citizens don't like Trump.
[00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:24.916]  They reject Trump.
[00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:26.017]  No.
[00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:26.818]  Complete lies.
[00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:28.158]  They do this every month.
[00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:29.239]  They do this with every story.
[00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:31.681]  Trump has 50% more meetings with foreign leaders.
[00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:32.902]  What does the fake news say?
[00:10:33.122 --> 00:10:34.203]  Trump's an isolationist.
[00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:38.846]  That's how you can tell the difference between fake news and real news.
[00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:40.987]  Now let's talk about a total fraud of a person.
[00:10:41.548 --> 00:10:44.129]  Bernie Sanders is one of the biggest frauds I've ever seen in my life.
[00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.572]  Listen to this clip of Bernie Sanders on MSNBC today.
[00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.742]  What's your optimistic scenario for the rest of the year?
[00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:53.764]  I hope we beat this thing.
[00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:56.145]  I hope we beat this thing badly.
[00:10:57.266 --> 00:11:08.153]  I hope that Trump's supporters in rural states understand that what he told them during the campaign, that he was going to stand up for working class people, was nothing but a lie.
[00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:13.536]  And if you think this health care bill is a disaster, take a look at the budget that he proposed.
[00:11:19.838 --> 00:11:34.504]  He's got to be exposed for the fraud that he is, not just focusing on his temperament and on his tweets, but on this extremely right-wing policy that is paid for by the Koch brothers and other billionaires.
[00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:38.146]  Calling President Trump a fraud.
[00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:40.147]  This is one of the biggest frauds in political history.
[00:11:40.447 --> 00:11:43.849]  Called Hillary out for her misdeeds or criminal acts and then endorsed her.
[00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:46.650]  His wife is being investigated for bank fraud.
[00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.932]  He calls out the millionaires and billionaires, yet he's got multiple houses and multiple cars.
[00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:57.235]  But beyond just the absolute fraud, disgusting trash of human being that Bernie Sanders is, just look at the nonsense he says.
[00:11:57.335 --> 00:11:57.876]  First of all,
[00:11:58.905 --> 00:12:01.887]  He wants to rip on Donald Trump's proposed health care bill.
[00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:06.950]  Hello Bernie, Earth to Bernie, it's not even law, and look at what's happening with Obamacare.
[00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:13.934]  Premium skyrocketing, people losing their health care, and a lot of states now only have one or two providers, so Obamacare is a total failure.
[00:12:14.155 --> 00:12:16.176]  He doesn't look at that, he just wants to rip on Trump.
[00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:17.437]  Same thing with the budget.
[00:12:17.797 --> 00:12:20.679]  He is angry at Donald Trump's proposed budget.
[00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:25.542]  Again, Bernie, Barack Obama, doubled this country's deficit!
[00:12:26.676 --> 00:12:31.039]  The results that you're complaining about with the budget are a direct result of Obama as well.
[00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.320]  But he will not mention that.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.501]  So there's Crazy Bernie.
[00:12:34.521 --> 00:12:36.142]  But it just, this is just the Democrats.
[00:12:36.162 --> 00:12:37.503]  They just keep getting crazier and crazier.
[00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:38.163]  I can't believe this.
[00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:38.983]  I'm saying this every day.
[00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:40.204]  This is from the Daily Caller.
[00:12:41.225 --> 00:12:46.368]  Maine Democratic representative makes physical threat against expli- uh, curse word, Trump.
[00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:49.490]  Um, you know, the type of hats that the women walk around wearing.
[00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.071]  So, Scott
[00:12:53.197 --> 00:12:54.578]  We're good to go.
[00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.811]  Look at what she tweets out.
[00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:21.335]  Just know that I am taking names of those who have lied about me to defame my character.
[00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:22.516]  Taking names!
[00:13:23.017 --> 00:13:24.078]  I may be quiet for now.
[00:13:24.298 --> 00:13:24.998]  No, you're not quiet.
[00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:25.659]  You're way too loud.
[00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:26.740]  That's why people can't stand you.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.520]  But I am working.
[00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:33.645]  Imagine if President Trump or Alex Jones or anyone on the conservative side said they're taking names.
[00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:37.809]  Folks, that would be a huge news story.
[00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:40.230]  Now let's move on to another feminist.
[00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.533]  Now this is Tamika Mallory who's waging war against the NRA.
[00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:48.515]  And I wanted to cover this and I was going to address Tamika Mallory.
[00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:50.916]  She's unfortunately severely misinformed.
[00:13:51.637 --> 00:13:56.960]  She's making false equivalencies and she really doesn't understand the real issues here and she tries to blame the NRA.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.743]  But then I saw the NRA's response to this and I figured let's just roll this powerful video.
[00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:08.199]  Member of the violent left who's having a meltdown over Dana Lash's NRA ad, get over yourself.
[00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:13.861]  You people openly call for the assassination of our president and then claim the NRA is inciting violence.
[00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:19.263]  You set fire to buildings and attack people in the streets and then go ballistic for being called out.
[00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:23.344]  You look down on gun owners, Trump supporters and states without coasts.
[00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:29.990]  All the while, while relying on your armed security to protect you and your marbled office buildings and your fenced-in mansions.
[00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:36.976]  And to those of you on the violent left who claim we believe there's an us and them in this country, you're absolutely right.
[00:14:37.436 --> 00:14:39.478]  There are those of us who believe in freedom.
[00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:46.444]  Then there are those of you who actively burn down our country because you can't get over the fact your so-called progressive didn't win the election.
[00:14:47.085 --> 00:14:48.526]  Get over it and grow up.
[00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.908]  I'm talking to you, Tamika Mallory.
[00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:58.235]  You write a letter to the NRA on behalf of the Women's March claiming our clenched fist of truth ad was an attack on minority communities.
[00:14:58.255 --> 00:15:00.797]  You call it dangerous and demand it be taken down?
[00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:02.999]  I'm here to tell you, not a chance.
[00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:09.584]  Where was your letter to Madonna, Tamika, when she used your march to talk about blowing up the White House?
[00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:14.629]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.897]  Then there's California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.
[00:15:18.397 --> 00:15:19.218]  Listen to this tweet.
[00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:26.846]  Watching this NRA video sent a chill down my spine followed by a feeling of sadness and fear that I haven't shaken.
[00:15:27.607 --> 00:15:33.553]  Seems the left has gone from getting chills down their legs at the sight of Obama to getting chills down their spines when they hear the truth.
[00:15:34.193 --> 00:15:34.934]  The NRA is so good.
[00:15:35.274 --> 00:15:39.177]  This guy, DeRay McKesson, could look at a blank chalkboard and think it's racist.
[00:15:51.727 --> 00:15:55.531]  Yeah, give me a case example of that happening by the NRA's hands.
[00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:55.931]  Oh, can't do it.
[00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:17.771]  Hoorah!
[00:16:43.683 --> 00:16:48.908]  Getting behind the greatest offender of freedom in history, that's the NRA, because we will never back down.
[00:16:49.248 --> 00:16:55.874]  But most of all, what really got at the left was this simple line uttered by one very strong woman.
[00:16:56.295 --> 00:17:06.745]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:17:07.345 --> 00:17:10.766]  It is our purest weapon in this ongoing war for truth.
[00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:17.367]  So to every member of the lying media and the violent left demanding an apology, let me be very clear.
[00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:18.748]  It'll never happen.
[00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:26.890]  We don't apologize for warning America about chaos creators who want to impose their will upon us through their violence and lies.
[00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:32.831]  And we stand firm with the clenched fists of truth while they wilt with an open mouth of lies.
[00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:38.468]  Absolutely powerful video again from the NRA.
[00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:41.389]  And see, the NRA has realized something, and this is why they're getting more political.
[00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.311]  We are really in the fight of our lives.
[00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:44.872]  We are really in the fight for this country.
[00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:50.855]  And Alex Jones has realized that, and that's why he's decided to expand InfoWars to the next level.
[00:17:51.135 --> 00:17:53.257]  But it's not without your support.
[00:17:53.757 --> 00:17:57.918]  Yes, the NRA puts out these powerful ads, but you know why they keep doing it?
[00:17:57.998 --> 00:18:00.499]  You know why they talk about the clinched fist of truth?
[00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.200]  That's because they get more members.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.340]  They get more support.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.700]  We're doing the same thing.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.681]  The support that you're giving us, we're expanding to the next level.
[00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:08.862]  We're launching new shows.
[00:18:08.902 --> 00:18:11.042]  We're going live more hours of the day.
[00:18:11.282 --> 00:18:13.763]  And it's all thanks to you at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:13.783 --> 00:18:16.484]  So just like the NRA with the clinched fist of truth,
[00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:21.026]  That is exactly what InfoWars.com is, the clenched fist of truth.
[00:18:21.347 --> 00:18:22.827]  Give us a bigger fist.
[00:18:23.128 --> 00:18:26.770]  Give us bigger muscles to punch against the establishment lies.

[00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:48.882]  Help us!
[00:18:49.202 --> 00:18:50.323]  Give us a bigger fist!
[00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:51.765]  Give us a bigger bicep!
[00:18:52.025 --> 00:18:54.568]  In the fight against the lies of the New World Order!
[00:18:54.748 --> 00:18:55.449]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:18.320]  Well, the Democrats and the left are in an all-out assault against patriots, against Americans, and they're waging attacks with no grounds, no proof, no evidence, nothing.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.082]  And the biggest example would be the Trump-Russia collusion non-story.
[00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.263]  But now, Roger, you're under attack.
[00:23:25.544 --> 00:23:26.664]  They're coming after you.
[00:23:26.904 --> 00:23:27.725]  They're suing you.
[00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:29.165]  And this is actually amazing.
[00:23:29.206 --> 00:23:31.967]  I'm reading this report from the National Journal today, Roger.
[00:23:31.987 --> 00:23:33.208]  I knew I was going to be talking to you.
[00:23:34.388 --> 00:23:35.208]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:39.350]  I assumed they were going to come after you for something petty or some nonsensical thing.
[00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.070]  Maybe you did this with the campaign.
[00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.131]  Maybe you talked to this person here.
[00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:47.132]  No, they actually think you were involved in a hack.
[00:23:47.852 --> 00:23:56.335]  They think you colluded with Guccifer and the Russians and Wikileaks to hack the DNC and get Donald Trump the presidency.
[00:23:56.395 --> 00:23:57.295]  This is probably the most absurd thing.
[00:23:57.295 --> 00:23:58.296]  That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.
[00:23:58.316 --> 00:23:59.336]  Yeah, no, it's extraordinary.
[00:23:59.536 --> 00:24:05.539]  So, in essence, it's always a great honor to be sued by a former president of the United States, and that's really what this is.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:20.808]  Obama's attorneys, propped up by George Soros, have filed this completely phony, bogus lawsuit claiming that I conspired with Donald Trump and the Trump campaign to hack the DNC emails.
[00:24:21.488 --> 00:24:24.369]  They, of course, provide no proof whatsoever of this.
[00:24:24.849 --> 00:24:25.249]  Zero.
[00:24:25.469 --> 00:24:26.730]  No proof can be provided.
[00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.730]  It's not true.
[00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:34.433]  They can't even prove that the emails were hacked, never mind that I was involved in hacking them.
[00:24:35.013 --> 00:24:43.476]  This is one of the shoddiest, most unprofessional, paced up jobs I've ever seen.
[00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:45.717]  There is no merit.
[00:24:46.597 --> 00:24:48.219]  There are no facts here.
[00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:51.642]  There are no evidence to support their conclusions.
[00:24:51.702 --> 00:24:57.527]  They just paste together a bunch of unfounded media claims and call it a lawsuit.
[00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:02.752]  Other than the high honor, you know, I'm prepared to do battle.
[00:25:03.313 --> 00:25:05.454]  We will move to summarily dismiss this.
[00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:14.780]  And then I will seek sanctions and disciplinary action against every lawyer who put his name on this piece of crap.
[00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:19.563]  It's a hit job, I presume, designed for two purposes.
[00:25:19.824 --> 00:25:24.246]  One, to try to achieve in the courts what they could not achieve at the ballot box.
[00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:29.529]  And then secondarily, I think it was designed to kind of blacken my name prior to my
[00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:40.078]  Scheduled testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, which now, out of the blue, has been postponed indefinitely by the committee.
[00:25:40.198 --> 00:25:41.539]  Well, you know, I just thought of this too.
[00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.201]  I mean, they might be trying to kill you again with this thing.
[00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:51.887]  I mean, there's actually a lot of cases where people go through this rigmarole with the law and lawyers and all this and it overstresses them and they end up dying, Roger.
[00:25:51.927 --> 00:25:53.988]  Now, I know you're a fighter, that's not going to be the case with you.
[00:25:54.028 --> 00:25:55.530]  They probably mis-measured again.
[00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.072]  But I'm sitting here and I'm just thinking,
[00:25:58.692 --> 00:26:05.815]  Without any evidence, you put it perfectly, they take all of these string of media stories and they claim it's a lawsuit, and I'm just sitting here saying, you know what?
[00:26:05.935 --> 00:26:07.896]  I'd like to see Roger Stone go into court.
[00:26:08.237 --> 00:26:17.281]  He would win the lawsuit, and then maybe you would actually force them to show this evidence that they will not share with the DHS, they will not share with the FBI.
[00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:20.782]  They're saying they know it was Russia that worked with WikiLeaks.
[00:26:20.963 --> 00:26:23.244]  They're saying that it's going to be you that they're going to sue.
[00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.824]  So then let's see the evidence.
[00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:26.465]  Quit holding that from the DHS.
[00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:27.766]  Quit holding that from the court.
[00:26:28.006 --> 00:26:30.387]  They would have to present that from the court to the court, Roger.
[00:26:30.467 --> 00:26:31.668]  Well, you don't have to worry about me.
[00:26:31.768 --> 00:26:35.050]  I'm in excellent health and I like a good skirmish, as you know.
[00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.990]  Keeps you alive, huh?
[00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.492]  This is a mind-numbingly incoherent mass dump.
[00:26:40.012 --> 00:26:42.475]  of purely invented allegations.
[00:26:42.575 --> 00:26:49.384]  It's disingenuous, it's transparent, it's preposterous, and it's completely phony.
[00:26:49.764 --> 00:26:56.212]  I can't understand why any lawyer again would be associated with this completely bogus lawsuit.
[00:26:57.914 --> 00:27:00.656]  I think it's just a media hit job.
[00:27:01.477 --> 00:27:04.119]  It is helping me sell books, so I appreciate that.
[00:27:04.199 --> 00:27:04.720]  That is nice.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.442]  It may drive people to go see Get Me Roger Stone on Netflix.
[00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:09.964]  That's not a bad thing.
[00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:10.884]  Gotta like that.
[00:27:10.904 --> 00:27:11.925]  But I have no choice.
[00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.167]  They're suing me for $75,000.
[00:27:14.767 --> 00:27:18.050]  I will now counter-sue for $75 million.
[00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:25.596]  What do we know about the group that is suing you, the non-profit group United to Protect Democracy?
[00:27:26.055 --> 00:27:31.719]  Well, like most on the left, their purposes are the exact opposite of their title.
[00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:34.641]  Their goal is to subvert democracy.
[00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:38.804]  Democracy is the election of Donald Trump in the last election.
[00:27:38.864 --> 00:27:40.906]  They're seeking to undermine him.
[00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.307]  Look, I have no illusions.
[00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.228]  This isn't about me.
[00:27:43.248 --> 00:27:45.389]  This is about attacking the president.
[00:27:45.449 --> 00:27:47.230]  That's their real target.
[00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.732]  That's their real goal.
[00:27:49.392 --> 00:28:08.089]  But if you look at some of the big-name Democrats involved in this lawsuit, a former deputy counsel in the Obama White House, a former federal judge, a number of white-shoe Democratic lawyers in Washington, these are juicy targets as far as I'm concerned.
[00:28:08.109 --> 00:28:09.931]  They've chosen to climb into the arena.
[00:28:10.512 --> 00:28:12.974]  I hope they're ready for what's going to transpire.
[00:28:13.154 --> 00:28:18.440]  Yeah, it appears to me that this is just going to fall back on them, just like everything else has.
[00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:24.127]  And if they really want there to be anything pursued with not just yourself, but Donald Trump Jr.
[00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:27.291]  for meeting with Russians or any of this, it's going to fall right back on them.
[00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.833]  They're the ones that met with Russia.
[00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:32.934]  Hillary Clinton is the one that had cash deals for uranium on record.
[00:28:32.954 --> 00:28:37.876]  That's a paper trail that you can trace, yet they want to have this frivolous lawsuit against you.
[00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:40.157]  They've got the FEC coming after us as well.
[00:28:40.917 --> 00:28:42.018]  None of it makes any sense.
[00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:45.219]  Meanwhile, on the back end of this, what's amazing to me, Roger,
[00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:49.548]  Is that the Democratic National Committee is also being sued.
[00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:50.970]  A legitimate lawsuit.
[00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:51.951]  One with proof.
[00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:52.952]  One with evidence.
[00:28:53.212 --> 00:28:55.394]  One with three potential witnesses that have been killed.
[00:28:55.754 --> 00:29:02.281]  Yet all the media wants to do is look at Roger Stone, point at Roger Stone, and say you're the one that's impacting the democracy of this country.
[00:29:02.561 --> 00:29:03.222]  A total lie.
[00:29:03.302 --> 00:29:23.653]  Yeah, no, yesterday The Atlantic printed an open letter from a Sandy Hook mother who was criticizing me because I keep insisting on knowing who murdered Seth Rich and I speculated publicly that I find it odd that his parents seem to have no interest in finding his murder.
[00:29:23.693 --> 00:29:29.256]  I'm sorry, that's not disrespectful, that's not outrageous, that's common sense.
[00:29:29.696 --> 00:29:32.318]  Yes, his parents' privacy is important.
[00:29:32.978 --> 00:29:35.602]  The truth, however, is more important.
[00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:48.501]  And therefore, if you think that the murder of the man who headed the division from which records were stolen by someone and printed at WikiLeaks is not suspicious, then you're stupid!
[00:29:48.962 --> 00:29:50.063]  There's no other way to explain it.
[00:29:50.143 --> 00:29:51.765]  No, that's actually a great point, Roger.
[00:29:52.306 --> 00:30:01.957]  They want to sit here with, again, I mean, zero evidence, not a lick of evidence to try to indict you with any Russians or indict you with WikiLeaks or anything, but they want to have this lawsuit against you.
[00:30:01.977 --> 00:30:02.878]  They want to investigate you.
[00:30:02.899 --> 00:30:05.522]  Well, how about, well, let's investigate Seth Rich.
[00:30:06.002 --> 00:30:07.063]  Oh no, that's off limits.
[00:30:07.464 --> 00:30:08.485]  That's disrespectful.
[00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.286]  That's off limits.
[00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:10.827]  But this is a totally different angle.
[00:30:10.847 --> 00:30:11.248]  Think about it.
[00:30:11.508 --> 00:30:13.290]  I'm not talking about the murder of Seth Rich.
[00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:19.456]  I'm talking about everything that they're saying you conspired to do with WikiLeaks and the Russians and Guccifer.
[00:30:19.816 --> 00:30:22.279]  Why not investigate that that could have potentially been Seth Rich?
[00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:23.680]  Where's that investigation?
[00:30:23.901 --> 00:30:24.962]  There could have been your leaker!
[00:30:25.502 --> 00:30:26.603]  Don't don't hold your breath.
[00:30:26.643 --> 00:30:26.983]  I don't think.
[00:30:27.364 --> 00:30:28.545]  I'm not going to hold my breath.
[00:30:28.705 --> 00:30:32.408]  It's just amazing to me the total double standards that we witness here, Roger.
[00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:34.970]  And I think they're going to back off.
[00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.972]  I think this is all, again, to smear your name, to smear Donald Trump.
[00:30:38.193 --> 00:30:39.954]  There's no way they're actually going to follow through on this.
[00:30:39.994 --> 00:30:43.597]  You know that they they know that you would beat them in court.
[00:30:43.937 --> 00:30:46.079]  So I doubt that they would set themselves up for this loss.
[00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:47.740]  But you're going to fight it.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.981]  I know that that's the case.
[00:30:49.562 --> 00:30:50.502]  And have you heard?
[00:30:50.522 --> 00:30:51.463]  I mean, what's the latest?
[00:30:51.503 --> 00:30:52.344]  Are they backing off?
[00:30:52.404 --> 00:30:54.766]  Are they coming harder at you now that they know you're going to fight back?
[00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.967]  Well, we've heard nothing.
[00:30:56.987 --> 00:31:04.890]  I did get some insights into why the House committee hearing that I was scheduled for on the 24th has been put off.
[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.831]  It's supposed to be two Republicans and two Democrats.
[00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:10.272]  The two Republicans have been designated.
[00:31:10.352 --> 00:31:11.453]  They are Trey Gowdy,
[00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:16.837]  And Tom Rooney, both good guys, both outstanding Republican congressmen.
[00:31:17.398 --> 00:31:20.741]  The problem is, no Democrats want to be the two Democrats.
[00:31:21.422 --> 00:31:22.883]  You can hear what's going on in their pockets.
[00:31:22.903 --> 00:31:23.063]  Shocking.
[00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:24.365]  I think you should do it.
[00:31:24.405 --> 00:31:25.706]  No, no, I think you should do it.
[00:31:25.866 --> 00:31:26.807]  I'm busy that day.
[00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:28.208]  I think you should be the one.
[00:31:28.268 --> 00:31:29.269]  No, no, no, I can't do it.
[00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:30.430]  I think maybe you should do it.
[00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:31.231]  Hot potato, huh?
[00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:32.411]  No, they don't want to step up.
[00:31:32.511 --> 00:31:33.632]  Nobody wants to step up.
[00:31:33.672 --> 00:31:34.352]  They love lobbying.
[00:31:34.372 --> 00:31:35.952]  Why are you colluding with Russia though?
[00:31:36.212 --> 00:31:36.873]  They got you!
[00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:49.516]  They love lobbying, mud balls, blackening your name in a public hearing, but when it comes to giving you a chance to respond, kind of the American way, only elementary fairness, no, they're not interested in that.
[00:31:49.656 --> 00:31:59.686]  This is like, you know, having the chance to shoot the buzzer beater, to have the final shot, to win the game, and they won't take the shot because they know they can't hit it, because there's no game, there's no ball.
[00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:09.516]  I think they know that they have said things that are irresponsible, that cannot be documented, that are legally defamatory, and this guy Adam Schiff
[00:32:10.217 --> 00:32:11.158]  Eric's pencil neck.
[00:32:11.198 --> 00:32:12.279]  These guys are pussies.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.180]  They're cowards.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.262]  They're yellow bellies.
[00:32:14.342 --> 00:32:18.767]  They don't have the balls to face me, mano a mano.
[00:32:19.147 --> 00:32:20.669]  That's why nobody wants to step up.
[00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:23.131]  And they don't, they certainly don't want to testify under oath.
[00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:26.295]  They certainly don't want to face you in court because they know they have nothing.
[00:32:26.615 --> 00:32:27.436]  They're pencil necks.
[00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:28.737]  And again,
[00:32:29.498 --> 00:32:31.599]  All of this will fall back on the Democrats.
[00:32:31.639 --> 00:32:38.520]  If you want to talk about Russia collusion, foreign collusion, how about meddling in regime change and election?
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.980]  This is all the Democrats, folks.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.821]  This is all Obama.
[00:32:41.061 --> 00:32:42.561]  And now, Roger Stone, you're honored.
[00:32:42.581 --> 00:32:44.081]  You're being attacked by Obama's lawyers.
[00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:44.801]  Congratulations.
[00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:46.162]  Looks like they're setting you up for another victory.
[00:32:46.342 --> 00:32:46.982]  Thank you very much.
[00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:47.822]  Great to be here, Owen.
[00:32:48.102 --> 00:32:48.822]  There you go, folks.
[00:32:48.862 --> 00:32:51.423]  Roger Stone versus the Obama establishment.
[00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:53.303]  Another attack on President Trump.
[00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:55.844]  Another attack on patriots protecting this country.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.153]  It's like lightning in a bottle!

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.112]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.708]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:05.913 --> 00:37:11.235]  Tonight we're going to look at health issues, we're going to look at freedom issues, we're going to look at what they're trying to do to our children.
[00:37:11.255 --> 00:37:20.680]  We've got the Senate now with Obamacare on life support, and of course there's an update on the story of Charlie Gard where their government is trying to take that child off of life support.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.981]  Let's take a quick look at Obamacare first.
[00:37:23.601 --> 00:37:33.827]  The Senate Republican effort to repeal Obamacare is on the cusp of defeat, reports Politico, with two Republican senators already threatening to kill the bill measure before they can even start debate.
[00:37:33.847 --> 00:37:38.730]  Now they said they're going to delay their summer vacation, and when I look at this it's like, summer vacation?
[00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.232]  I thought you guys just took a vacation around Fourth of July.
[00:37:41.772 --> 00:37:42.672]  The big issue about that.
[00:37:42.712 --> 00:37:44.233]  Why don't you stay there and fix this?
[00:37:44.253 --> 00:37:44.633]  But they're not.
[00:37:44.994 --> 00:37:50.716]  And of course the two senators so far that have come out in opposition to it are Senator Rand Paul and Susan Collins.
[00:37:50.776 --> 00:37:53.337]  And of course they're on opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:37:53.958 --> 00:37:58.140]  Rand Paul wants to have a real repeal, wants to have real freedom, and we're going to give you a
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.662]  A couple of quick comments from Rand Paul.
[00:38:00.702 --> 00:38:03.825]  He wrote an op-ed piece yesterday that was on Breitbart.
[00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:06.969]  We had it at InfoWars, talking about his objections to this.
[00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:13.355]  The two of them said, this is not acceptable to us, we're not going to vote for this, and it only takes three to shut this down.
[00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:28.177]  Of course, some of the things that's in the bill right now, it would maintain support for Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, it would provide new financial support for low-income people to purchase health insurance, and it would allow people to pay for insurance with pre-tax money.
[00:38:28.537 --> 00:38:30.457]  That would be one thing I would support.
[00:38:30.497 --> 00:38:33.618]  And of course, we're always going to find things we like, things we don't like in this.
[00:38:33.718 --> 00:38:35.499]  They have to repeal Obamacare.
[00:38:36.339 --> 00:38:38.740]  48 Democrats say we're not going to change anything.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.700]  We want to leave it this way.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.741]  They want it to fail so they can impose a single-payer system.
[00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.662]  So they're not going, they're out of the equation.
[00:38:45.982 --> 00:38:48.963]  So it's simply the debate within the Republican Party.
[00:38:49.583 --> 00:38:55.305]  But if they're going to tell us that it's important for us to have health insurance, really it's health care that we want, folks.
[00:38:55.925 --> 00:38:56.925]  Don't get this confused.
[00:38:56.945 --> 00:38:59.546]  When we talk about education, everybody says, schools, schools, schools.
[00:38:59.586 --> 00:38:59.746]  No.
[00:38:59.766 --> 00:39:01.326]  Well, that's one way that you can get educated.
[00:39:01.346 --> 00:39:02.667]  It's not the only way to get educated.
[00:39:03.327 --> 00:39:09.768]  And you can get health care without having health insurance, especially if health care were more affordable.
[00:39:09.908 --> 00:39:10.688]  That's the key thing.
[00:39:10.728 --> 00:39:12.169]  That's what they sold this to us on.
[00:39:12.189 --> 00:39:14.989]  They told us that we're going to have the Affordable Health Care Act.
[00:39:15.009 --> 00:39:16.370]  Remember, that's what they called Obamacare?
[00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.110]  That's not the metric anymore.
[00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.071]  They don't care if it's affordable.
[00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:23.834]  When the Congressional Budget Office looks at this, they're not looking at affordability.
[00:39:24.075 --> 00:39:26.316]  They're looking at the number of people to be covered.
[00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:30.280]  So why didn't they call the Obamacare bill universal health care coverage?
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.181]  That's where the Democrats are going with this.
[00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:33.262]  They want this to fail.
[00:39:33.823 --> 00:39:43.351]  Meanwhile, they've had an amendment from Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to sell non-compliant systems, plans rather, and both Cruz and Lee said that they would
[00:39:44.352 --> 00:39:47.102]  ...not vote for this if that amendment was not there.
[00:39:47.202 --> 00:39:48.647]  What does the Cruz amendment do?
[00:39:49.761 --> 00:40:00.366]  It would give subsidies to insurance companies if they agree to insure high-risk Americans who come in with pre-existing conditions under Obamacare regulations.
[00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:06.049]  If they offer those subsidized, government subsidized programs, again, subsidized with what?
[00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:16.294]  With taxes elsewhere, subsidized by stealing money from Fannie and Freddie investors, then they could sell cheap insurance plans that were not subject to the Obamacare regulations.
[00:40:16.354 --> 00:40:18.555]  That's what's caused our insurance plans to skyrocket.
[00:40:19.255 --> 00:40:25.117]  And we're going to get to climate change because that's all tied into the situation with our children and so forth.
[00:40:25.177 --> 00:40:33.240]  Remember we had the hockey stick that Al Gore loves to talk about, that they talk about temperatures rising over time and going up exponentially?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.902]  If temperatures were increasing anywhere like insurance rates,
[00:40:38.582 --> 00:40:42.905]  Which have gone up 100% or more each year under Obamacare.
[00:40:43.245 --> 00:40:48.469]  If that was happening, these people would be rioting in the streets over climate change.
[00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:49.590]  But that is not happening.
[00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:57.335]  Let's take a look quickly at Senator Rand Paul, because he pointed out what he didn't like about this bill a couple of days before this came out.
[00:40:57.375 --> 00:40:58.836]  He said, Obamacare regulations?
[00:40:59.217 --> 00:40:59.777]  Still there.
[00:41:00.338 --> 00:41:00.838]  Taxes?
[00:41:01.278 --> 00:41:04.360]  Many still in place, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:41:04.781 --> 00:41:06.062]  Insurance company bailouts?
[00:41:06.702 --> 00:41:07.643]  Those are there too.
[00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:15.030]  We're going to talk about the real issue of this, and that is why you can't make the decisions about your own health care.
[00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:19.697]  That's what the Republicans who are blocking this don't like.
[00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:23.059]  They ran on the basis of repeal.
[00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:25.200]  They got elected on the basis of repeal.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.583]  And so it's important to look at the fact that they're not going to do it.
[00:41:30.163 --> 00:41:30.624]  They love it.
[00:41:30.804 --> 00:41:31.404]  They're going to keep it.
[00:41:31.424 --> 00:41:32.745]  They're going to put it on life support.
[00:41:32.765 --> 00:41:34.386]  They're going to maintain this thing.
[00:41:34.846 --> 00:41:39.870]  Because that was in the works from the 2012 election, as I've said before.
[00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:48.917]  You're going to get Obamacare, whether Romney won or whether Obama won, because Romney had already implemented Obamacare in Massachusetts and they wanted to put that there.
[00:41:48.957 --> 00:41:53.261]  Meanwhile, Vice President Pence has backed a repeal-only health care bill.
[00:41:53.281 --> 00:41:57.064]  I think that's the only thing that has a chance to get through, is to repeal it first.
[00:41:57.825 --> 00:41:59.046]  Trump has pointed that out.
[00:41:59.086 --> 00:42:00.608]  The White House has pointed it out.
[00:42:00.648 --> 00:42:02.249]  Vice President Pence has pointed that out.
[00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.874]  They have to deliver, at the bare minimum, they have to deliver on repeal.
[00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:09.176]  And then they can talk about what they're going to replace it with.
[00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:13.920]  Trying to do all that together at the same time is just simply not practical.
[00:42:14.201 --> 00:42:16.683]  They need to deliver on that promise.
[00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:19.986]  Let's take a look now, though, as I try to keep the
[00:42:21.181 --> 00:42:25.371]  ObamaCare on life support and as they try to dictate our health care choices to us.
[00:42:25.411 --> 00:42:28.839]  Let's take a look at what this looks like because there are so many issues.
[00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:33.050]  That are very important with this baby Charlie Gard in the UK.
[00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.751]  Today they had another hearing.
[00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:37.873]  They still have not delivered the decision on this yet as we go to air.
[00:42:38.593 --> 00:42:43.796]  They had a doctor in the United States say that Charlie has a 10% chance to improve.
[00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:48.238]  They took testimony from him at another High Court trial today.
[00:42:48.258 --> 00:42:52.941]  Of course the High Court has already ruled once that they were going to allow him to
[00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:55.022]  Die with dignity.
[00:42:55.602 --> 00:43:00.745]  Why don't they allow him to, and his parents, to have a chance with dignity?
[00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:01.325]  How about that?
[00:43:02.045 --> 00:43:04.026]  Have a chance at life with dignity.
[00:43:04.607 --> 00:43:06.788]  And that's what is so amazing about this.
[00:43:06.868 --> 00:43:08.048]  And this is what we're going to talk about.
[00:43:08.108 --> 00:43:18.034]  The legal basis for why the hospital and the British legal system would work so hard to shut down this young baby's life support.
[00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:28.546]  The doctor who has not seen the child told the judge that tests on the boy's brains show disorganization of brain activity but not major structural brain damage.
[00:43:29.286 --> 00:43:35.113]  And they said the small number of people who have Charlie's rare genetic condition would make it
[00:43:35.794 --> 00:43:38.376]  Impossible to do robust clinical trials.
[00:43:38.856 --> 00:43:39.937]  So that's the issue.
[00:43:39.997 --> 00:43:45.742]  He has such a rare condition, they're never going to have a situation where they can do sufficient clinical trials.
[00:43:46.402 --> 00:43:52.307]  And if we take terminally ill patients and we deny them treatment, which our FDA does all the time,
[00:43:53.027 --> 00:44:01.858]  And even going to the extent of locking people up for using medical marijuana that is known to help brain seizures and other issues like that.
[00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.641]  To lock people in jail, to deny them that treatment.
[00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:06.543]  We do that here in the United States as well.
[00:44:06.603 --> 00:44:07.684]  It's only going to get worse.
[00:44:08.365 --> 00:44:10.627]  The more government takes over our health care.
[00:44:10.727 --> 00:44:16.471]  That's why we need to move government away from our health care, away from making all of these decisions for us.
[00:44:16.511 --> 00:44:20.895]  Now they went on to say that his parents have raised more than 1.3 million pounds.
[00:44:20.955 --> 00:44:27.540]  I'm not sure how much that is in dollars, maybe about 1.7 million in dollars, to take their son to the U.S.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.420]  to get therapy.
[00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:34.404]  The High Court has also been hearing, listen to the minutiae that happens when we turn these decisions over to the courts.
[00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:41.689]  They've been hearing arguments about the child's head size, which the UK doctors say would indicate a lack of
[00:44:43.134 --> 00:44:45.155]  Function and possible brain damage.
[00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:49.736]  And what has happened is that the doctors have said his head size has not increased.
[00:44:50.136 --> 00:44:51.697]  The parents say, no it has.
[00:44:52.257 --> 00:45:01.300]  As a matter of fact, the court heard that the mother had measured the baby's head this morning and came up with a two centimeter difference between her measurements and the hospital's measurements.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.883]  And so the judge said it's absurd that a dispute over his head size was undermining the case.
[00:45:07.183 --> 00:45:18.969]  No, what is absurd is the fact that you would have a judge sitting there making life and death decisions and putting, as I said, putting his foot down along with the hospital saying you can't go for experimental treatment.
[00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:25.933]  The doctor, as I said, pointed out there's a 10% chance, but the specialists, as it's reported from the BBC, say that
[00:45:26.713 --> 00:45:30.696]  They have fought the parents' wishes for treatment because they don't think that it will help.
[00:45:31.096 --> 00:45:32.077]  Well, maybe they don't know.
[00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:35.820]  Maybe some other doctors know something that they don't know.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.181]  And so that brings up the issues.
[00:45:37.281 --> 00:45:38.302]  Why would they fight so hard?
[00:45:39.043 --> 00:45:50.772]  Is it because, as we've been told, their hospital is a worldwide respected authority for children's hospitals and it would make them look bad if there was a treatment that was not invented by them that they got?
[00:45:50.912 --> 00:45:52.933]  No, there's actually, that may be a part of it.
[00:45:52.973 --> 00:45:54.214]  I'm sure that is one issue.
[00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:56.316]  But listen to this statement from the hospital.
[00:45:57.236 --> 00:46:13.471]  They say, a world where only parents speak and decide for children, and where children have no separate identity or rights, and no court to hear and protect them, is far from the world in which this hospital treats its child patients.
[00:46:14.212 --> 00:46:15.633]  Do you understand what's behind that?
[00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.414]  That is the key issue.
[00:46:17.434 --> 00:46:19.054]  We're going to talk about this when we come back.
[00:46:19.535 --> 00:46:23.336]  It's called the UN Convention for Children's Rights.
[00:46:23.697 --> 00:46:29.199]  The United States is the only country, I think, other than Somalia, that has not signed on to that.
[00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:30.960]  That is what they're talking about.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.022]  The fact that the government is going to make decisions for your children.
[00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.383]  When we come back, I'm going to break that down for you.
[00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:38.744]  Why that is so important.
[00:46:38.984 --> 00:46:40.765]  Why it is important, not only for you,
[00:46:41.605 --> 00:46:44.426]  As a parent, but also for you as an individual.
[00:46:44.606 --> 00:46:52.669]  If you have no rights to make these decisions for yourself, if you're owned by the state, they can turn off your life support at any time.
[00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:53.629]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:07.734]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.535 --> 00:48:59.084]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.104 --> 00:48:59.965]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:00.025]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.854 --> 00:49:15.444]  Before we went to break, I read you the quote from the hospital saying that in a world where parents, only parents, speak and decide for their children, well, we wouldn't want to have that, right?
[00:49:15.464 --> 00:49:17.607]  Because your children don't belong to you.
[00:49:17.627 --> 00:49:19.849]  We've heard that from Melissa Harris Perry and others.
[00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:25.716]  The it-takes-a-village mentality of Hillary Clinton and the United Nations is where this comes from, folks.
[00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.299]  This has been around for quite some time.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:35.126]  This is actually based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, or the Children's Rights.
[00:49:35.166 --> 00:49:36.607]  So it's the UNCCR.
[00:49:36.627 --> 00:49:39.010]  And I want to break down what that is for you.
[00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:44.996]  From the document itself, they start talking about wonderful principles of freedom and individual dignity.
[00:49:45.396 --> 00:49:48.298]  You know, dying with dignity, not having a choice with dignity.
[00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:56.923]  They say, bearing in mind the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person.
[00:49:56.983 --> 00:50:10.312]  But then, further down, it says the child should be fully prepared to live as an individual life in society brought up in the spirit and the ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations.
[00:50:11.576 --> 00:50:13.137]  That is who is going to own you.
[00:50:13.817 --> 00:50:14.878]  It's not going to be your parents.
[00:50:14.938 --> 00:50:17.500]  It's not even going to be your national government.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.243]  It is the world government that wants to instill the ideals and the charter of that.
[00:50:22.283 --> 00:50:30.088]  This is an idea that goes back to Plato, saying that we're going to have the children not even know who their parents are so that we can raise them.
[00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:31.028]  They will belong to us.
[00:50:31.068 --> 00:50:33.150]  They will do what we tell them to do.
[00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.511]  They will be our robots.
[00:50:35.111 --> 00:50:36.252]  And if you want to know what this looks like,
[00:50:36.792 --> 00:50:52.808]  It looks like Charlie Gard, young child with a rare disease, not being allowed by the government, by the hospital, to go accept free charitable care that the doctor who has created this experimental treatment believes gives him a 10% chance of improvement.
[00:50:52.948 --> 00:50:54.529]  Not going to let them take that chance.
[00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.770]  Eight years ago,
[00:50:56.631 --> 00:51:04.157]  I did a commercial for an organization that was fighting this, saying we need a constitutional amendment.
[00:51:04.637 --> 00:51:13.463]  We need the United States not only to not join this, and of course the United States did join this, but we did not ratify this treaty.
[00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:15.104]  So it's sitting there by a thread.
[00:51:16.105 --> 00:51:20.949]  Eight years ago I did this commercial to highlight the difference here before Charlie Gardner.
[00:51:20.969 --> 00:51:22.470]  I want to play you that commercial real quickly.
[00:51:23.436 --> 00:51:28.058]  No government, no matter how well-intentioned, can replace a nurturing love of a parent.
[00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:35.801]  Yet in the United States, judicial activism and a pending UN treaty are poised to tear apart this most fundamental bond of society.
[00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:42.003]  These foreign and domestic threats would undermine the parental role and overrule parental wishes.
[00:51:42.263 --> 00:51:49.666]  All parents would have the legal status of an abusive parent, with the state and not the parents deciding what is in the best interest of the child.
[00:51:51.587 --> 00:52:03.572]  The relentless encroachment of judges and UN treaties that assume that government, not parents, has the best interests of the child at heart will be stopped by nothing short of a constitutional amendment explicitly stating the rights of parents.
[00:52:04.092 --> 00:52:10.015]  Decisions affecting the child should be made by those who know and love that child, not by a distant bureaucracy.
[00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:15.197]  You can help protect children by helping those who care the most for them and those who care the best for them.
[00:52:15.798 --> 00:52:16.358]  The family.
[00:52:18.419 --> 00:52:20.480]  Find out what you can do at parentalrights.org.
[00:52:22.967 --> 00:52:24.748]  And again, that was a commercial from eight years ago.
[00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.008]  This has been around for a while.
[00:52:26.068 --> 00:52:30.730]  We had the United States join this back in 1995.
[00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.990]  We signed it, but we did not ratify it.
[00:52:33.031 --> 00:52:42.734]  And the opposition has come from conservatives, it has come from Christians who understand that your children belong to parents, to those who love them, not to the state.
[00:52:42.834 --> 00:52:45.375]  But what the hospital there, in the case of Charlie Gard is saying,
[00:52:46.115 --> 00:52:51.781]  That they don't operate in a world where only parents speak for the children, where only parents decide for the children.
[00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:54.404]  They say, no, children have a separate identity.
[00:52:55.362 --> 00:52:58.023]  And of course that is part of the response here.
[00:52:58.043 --> 00:53:14.986]  They're going to have a situation, part of the UN Charter says parents can express their opinion and they can have their opinion heard by the court, but the court will decide what is in the best interest of the children on all issues, not just on the life or death health issues as we see with Charlie Gardner.
[00:53:15.026 --> 00:53:19.627]  Today during the hearing, Charlie's parents, his father, punched the table.
[00:53:20.387 --> 00:53:25.049]  And his wife said, he is not suffering, he is not in pain.
[00:53:25.529 --> 00:53:27.650]  If he was, we would not be here fighting for that.
[00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:32.652]  They continue to tell that lie, to try to exercise this control over the child.
[00:53:33.313 --> 00:53:35.574]  It is pathological, what is happening with this.
[00:53:35.894 --> 00:53:38.035]  But let's take a look at what's happening here in America.
[00:53:38.971 --> 00:53:52.981]  We had just a couple of days ago, actually it was June 25th through July 5th, we had the National Education Association, the NEA, the teachers organization, with this annual meeting and they approved 159 new business items.
[00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:54.242]  This was supported by New American.
[00:53:54.622 --> 00:54:01.147]  One of the most radical proposals would promote the LGBTQ agenda and they would use NEA funds
[00:54:02.199 --> 00:54:14.183]  To promote solidarity with labor unions, to oppose deportations of illegal aliens, and requirements that educators provide information about the immigration status of students.
[00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:23.947]  They would deliver an ultimatum to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, demanding her resignation if she does not respond to the satisfaction of the NEA governance.
[00:54:24.187 --> 00:54:31.370]  They say they want a countywide, statewide, countrywide and statewide moratorium on new charter school authorizations.
[00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.311]  What is it that they have a problem with?
[00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:42.178]  Well, primarily they have a problem with the LGBTQ restrooms and other issues that they want to foist upon our children.
[00:54:42.999 --> 00:54:43.840]  That is the real issue.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.981]  Do they care about our children?
[00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:56.056]  They say that they want our children to be free, to have dignity, that they want them to accept the values of the United Nations as reflected in the values of the NEA.
[00:54:56.176 --> 00:54:57.257]  But understand this.
[00:54:57.937 --> 00:55:00.817]  They came out this last week, and this is something we've seen for quite some time.
[00:55:00.837 --> 00:55:05.419]  Science Magazine said, if you want to stop global warming, have fewer children.
[00:55:06.339 --> 00:55:07.559]  That's what they think of our children.
[00:55:08.059 --> 00:55:08.859]  They want to get rid of them.
[00:55:09.279 --> 00:55:11.080]  And I remember, I was in London,
[00:55:12.726 --> 00:55:24.196]  In 2001 with my children, they were young at the time, we were in the London Children's Museum and they were playing a loop about Gaia, the Gaia theory, saying that the earth is a living organism.
[00:55:24.777 --> 00:55:30.862]  And as part of that, they see you and your children as a virus that needs to be eliminated.
[00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:32.463]  So here's what this organization said.
[00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:35.026]  We carried this story yesterday at Infowars.com.
[00:55:35.326 --> 00:55:38.069]  Recycling and using public transit are all fine and good.
[00:55:38.891 --> 00:55:43.434]  If you want to reduce your carbon footprint, but to truly make a difference, you've got to have fewer children.
[00:55:43.454 --> 00:55:50.179]  That's the conclusion of a new study in which researchers look at 39 peer-reviewed papers and government reports and web-based programs.
[00:55:50.199 --> 00:55:54.121]  See, they all agree, we've got to get rid of the people.
[00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:56.122]  And that was the key issue.
[00:55:56.963 --> 00:56:01.729]  That was part of the papal encyclical on the climate.
[00:56:02.269 --> 00:56:07.936]  One of his advisors was a man who said, we have to reduce the world's population.
[00:56:08.336 --> 00:56:15.344]  John Schellenhuber, that the Pope put on his Pontifical Academy of Sciences that helped him to write his environmental treatise.
[00:56:15.945 --> 00:56:16.465]  We're good to go.
[00:56:35.578 --> 00:56:37.559]  We can get below a billion people.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:43.543]  And so what he's talking about here, folks, is he's talking about greater than an 85% reduction in population.
[00:56:43.844 --> 00:56:47.866]  And when they're honest, they want to get it far less than a billion people.
[00:56:48.086 --> 00:56:49.247]  And so what is this proposal?
[00:56:49.387 --> 00:56:51.869]  Again, it comes back to world government.
[00:56:51.929 --> 00:56:56.292]  Just as we saw the United Nations wants to control your kids, they also want to kill your kids.
[00:56:56.952 --> 00:56:57.792]  And how are they going to do it?
[00:56:57.992 --> 00:57:17.880]  Well, according to Sheldon Huber, who has written this encyclical with the Pope, he says, actually wrote it for him, he and three other scientists wrote it for him, they want a global democratic society, they want a global council, they want an earth constitution, they want a planetary court, and things like this UN Convention on Children's Rights is a big part of it.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.742]  Meanwhile, today, Climate Depot reports that Al Gore was in Australia
[00:57:23.703 --> 00:57:28.725]  And he stopped, members of the audience were physically stopped from recording his speech.
[00:57:29.505 --> 00:57:32.806]  And there's a good reason for that, folks, the stuff that he was saying.
[00:57:33.106 --> 00:57:40.009]  He was talking about issues like the abolition of slavery and likened that to stopping global warming.
[00:57:40.269 --> 00:57:42.830]  He said, yeah, this is for social causes.
[00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:48.994]  And he praised, he sang the praises, Climate Depot says, of fossil fuels during his speech.
[00:57:49.014 --> 00:57:50.235]  He said, must we change?
[00:57:50.736 --> 00:57:54.519]  We've had tremendous benefits from our reliance on fossil fuels.
[00:57:54.999 --> 00:57:56.020]  Poverty has declined.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.882]  Living standards have increased.
[00:57:57.982 --> 00:58:02.305]  And we still depend on them for more than 80% of the world's energy.
[00:58:02.365 --> 00:58:03.646]  So, must we change?
[00:58:04.207 --> 00:58:05.428]  And he said emphatically, yes.
[00:58:06.929 --> 00:58:08.511]  We have to stop carbon dioxide.
[00:58:26.229 --> 00:58:27.870]  Climate confabs.
[00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:37.760]  We've had Mark Morano at Climate Depot talk to these people and they said, even if we didn't have this, we would still be pushing for these same reforms.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.343]  Because that is what we really want.
[00:58:40.423 --> 00:58:41.504]  That's our solution.
[00:58:42.044 --> 00:58:45.488]  That is our social justice solution for the world.
[00:58:45.608 --> 00:58:47.510]  It's simply a beer to stop this.
[00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:49.313]  Thank you for joining us tonight.
