[00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.910]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.976]  Today is June 7th, 2017.
[00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.643]  I'm Millie Weaver and here's what's coming up on the news tonight.
[00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:41.278]  Former FBI Director James Comey is preparing for his highly anticipated testimony tomorrow on the Russian hacking conspiracy.
[00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:53.369]  And he has already released seven pages of testimony that includes accusations that President Donald Trump pressured him to be silent about Russia then.
[00:00:53.709 --> 00:01:09.314]  Tucker Carlson recently invited political activist and Black Lives Matter supporter Lisa Durden onto his program to explain why a BLM Memorial Day event in New York City was for blacks only.
[00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:10.494]  Explain that to me.
[00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:13.475]  What I say to that is boo hoo hoo.
[00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:18.917]  You white people are angry because you couldn't use your white privilege card.
[00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:23.450]  All that plus much more, up next on the Info Wars Nightly News!
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.881]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.462]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:56.666]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic

[00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.933]  I'm Millie Weaver and I'll be taking you guys through the news tonight.
[00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:25.709]  But first, before I do, I wanted to announce that InfoWars will be providing live coverage of James Comey's testimony tomorrow before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.352]  And David Knight will be analyzing and breaking down James Comey's testimony.
[00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:36.834]  And I'm going to be talking a lot about Comey because that testimony is tomorrow.
[00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:40.636]  But first, I wanted to talk about Eric Trump.
[00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:49.400]  He was interviewed on Hannity and they were talking about how out of control the mainstream media's behavior has been getting.
[00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:53.222]  It's getting so out of hand and ridiculous.
[00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.383]  The amount of threats.
[00:03:55.263 --> 00:04:00.628]  And that violent threats that are being directed at President Trump and his family.
[00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.791]  You know, Eric Trump seemed very upset.
[00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:14.861]  You know, you could see the emotion in his eyes when he talked about how mainstream media pundits are out there criticizing his family nonstop.
[00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:28.046]  Eleven-year-old brother, Barron Trump, his pregnant wife saying how, you know, how they're hoping that he, his wife has an abortion because they don't want to see another Trump in the world.
[00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:34.609]  It's pretty disturbing, but I wanted to roll to a clip of this interview with Eric Trump, so let's roll.
[00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.730]  16.3.
[00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.730]  I've dedicated my life.
[00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.410]  By the age of what?
[00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.470]  I started when I was 21.
[00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.192]  I've raised $16.3 million for the greatest hospital in the world at St.
[00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:44.432]  Jude.
[00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:45.892]  And I get attacked for it.
[00:04:46.312 --> 00:04:47.173]  Barron gets attacked.
[00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:48.853]  People come out, they look at my wife.
[00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:53.915]  Well, I hope she, you know, I hope the kid is aborted because God forbid there's another Trump in the world.
[00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.015]  So horrible.
[00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:59.316]  The manners, the lack of morals in society is awful.
[00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:01.297]  And honestly, I blame
[00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:05.705]  And I blame the media because it's out of control.
[00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:07.726]  I mean the way they act are out of control.
[00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:11.129]  And honestly, it's because the Democratic Party is sinking.
[00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.070]  And I mean that sincerely.
[00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.010]  They don't have a message.
[00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.511]  They don't have leadership.
[00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:15.692]  So they obstruct.
[00:05:15.772 --> 00:05:17.874]  And it's just, it's really the worst of the worst.
[00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.223]  And that is really the key right there.
[00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:24.024]  It's because the Democratic Party is sinking.
[00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:26.045]  They're grasping at straws.
[00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:26.925]  They're desperate.
[00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:34.207]  They're in desperation over the fact that their party is losing momentum and they and they're only making it worse.
[00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:45.291]  And one of the things he says here says the Democratic Party's continued implosion is forcing them to accelerate their obstructionist tactics to cover for their lack of coherent policy ideas.
[00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.432]  And it couldn't be more true.
[00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:47.912]  That's true.
[00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:56.419]  But also, recently, Tucker Carlson interviewed a Black Lives Matter supporter, Lisa Durden.
[00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.581]  She's also a political activist.
[00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:14.933]  Now, what's interesting here is, in this interview, they're talking about how the Black Lives Matter group held a Black Lives Matter Memorial Day event in New York City, and they said that it was for blacks only.
[00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.815]  They said blacks are only allowed to attend.
[00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:25.077]  No whites, no Hispanics, no Asians, no anybody else but blacks.
[00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:43.322]  And so Tucker Carlson is really kind of confused here because he would think that the Black Lives Matter group would be wanting to promote inclusivity and to try to dissuade people from doing anything like this by excluding people based on their race.
[00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:45.103]  Something they can't control.
[00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:49.306]  So, it's pretty disturbing and I couldn't believe it.
[00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:52.268]  This girl actually says, boo-hoo white people.
[00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:53.449]  It's pretty crazy.
[00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.070]  So let's watch a couple of these clips.
[00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:56.871]  Thank you.
[00:06:57.432 --> 00:07:10.181]  I was confused by this because I thought the whole point of Black Lives Matter, one of the points would be to speak out against singling people out on the basis of their race and punishing them for that.
[00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:13.483]  Because you can't control what your race is and yet they seem to be doing that.
[00:07:13.823 --> 00:07:14.504]  Explain that to me.
[00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:17.677]  What I say to that is boo hoo hoo!
[00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:28.033]  You white people are angry because you couldn't use your white privilege card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter All Black Memorial Day celebration!
[00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:28.114]  Wow!
[00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:31.470]  Unbelievable.
[00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.132]  This is what we're seeing coming out of the left.
[00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:35.914]  These lunatic liberals.
[00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:49.925]  And is it any wonder when you have shows out there like MTV's Dear White People, when you have the media out there making it okay to be racist towards white people, this is getting out of hand.
[00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:55.950]  You would think that this goes against the principles of what Democrats and liberals even stood for.
[00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:57.992]  It's pretty disturbing and
[00:07:59.053 --> 00:08:14.933]  I can't help but think that it's very hypocritical in a sense and Tucker even asked her in this interview, he says, you don't like people excluding others on the basis of their race and why are you doing it and why are you defending it?
[00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:16.856]  So let's watch another clip.
[00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:22.658]  I mean, you guys, I'm not talking, I'm talking about what I thought we all believed.
[00:08:22.698 --> 00:08:23.419]  Let me ask you this.
[00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:28.340]  Do you think it would be fair if white people did come to a Black Lives Matter celebration?
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.700]  They do all the time.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:38.903]  When you look at Black Lives Matter marches, and you see Black Lives Matter coming together collectively for different issues, you see people of all races.
[00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:40.063]  So we do accept them.
[00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:43.524]  This particular day, they said, stay your asses out.
[00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:44.925]  We want to celebrate today.
[00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:46.906]  We don't want anybody going against us today!
[00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:50.630]  And you can't celebrate if someone who doesn't look like you is around?
[00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.734]  Well, it's definitely something you have to see and hear to believe.
[00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:59.697]  It's getting so crazy, these lunatic liberals.
[00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.620]  And quite frankly, I'm getting really tired of it.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.944]  And her only response to Tucker's questions and
[00:09:07.344 --> 00:09:11.946]  You know, who's really grilling her on her lack of logic and common sense.
[00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:21.350]  Her only responses were to just try and say that, well, we're justifying it because, you know, America's a racist society and whatnot.
[00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.830]  So it's getting out of hand.
[00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:33.975]  And another example of the lunacy, the hysteria that's coming out of the left just because we've seen President Trump win and we've seen the pendulum sway.
[00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:40.458]  A play in New York is featuring Donald Trump being stabbed to death.
[00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:45.321]  It's pretty graphic, but people there said it was very gruesome.
[00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:51.425]  Now, New York's Public Theater is running a modernized version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:56.568]  Which features the POTUS, Donald Trump, as the protagonist.
[00:09:57.088 --> 00:10:01.851]  It was so obvious and apparent that Donald Trump was the protagonist.
[00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:11.817]  Now, his name was not Donald Trump in the play, but they actually had him with light hair, you know, they had him wearing a suit and a blue tie.
[00:10:12.617 --> 00:10:18.321]  And they had his wife look just like Melania Trump and even speak with an accent similar to Melania Trump's.
[00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:26.447]  So they took like a modern take on this Shakespeare play and the people there said it was disgusting.
[00:10:26.468 --> 00:10:27.508]  It was gruesome.
[00:10:27.568 --> 00:10:34.494]  And they said, you know what, if this were Obama, if people were making plays on the conservative, on the Republican side,
[00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:36.875]  Of killing Obama?
[00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:44.499]  People, the liberals and the Democrats would have been freaking out and crying and you would have seen a million liberal tears.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:52.184]  But it's just pretty disturbing to see people said they described the murder scene as shocking with blood spewing everywhere.
[00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:53.804]  So it was very graphic.
[00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:58.847]  It sounds like some kind of fantasy or dream that you would see coming out of some SJW's mind.
[00:11:00.348 --> 00:11:05.110]  Well, I wanted to get to some more serious news on the attack on President Trump.
[00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:13.353]  A Democrat congressman has already started with the steps towards the impeachment process against President Trump.
[00:11:13.653 --> 00:11:15.954]  So the Democrats are already beginning their coup.
[00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:26.762]  Initiated by the Deep State, this Texas Democrat Representative Al Green is saying that he's drafting articles of impeachment against President Trump.
[00:11:27.183 --> 00:11:41.174]  According to AL.com, Green took to the House floor last month to call for the impeachment of President Trump for what he said was an obstruction of justice in connection to the firing of FBI James Comey.
[00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:42.796]  Now he's claiming that
[00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:54.344]  You know, we've all heard it, that Trump fired James Comey for no other reason than the fact that James Comey was looking into him to see if he had ties to the Russians and to Russia.
[00:11:54.684 --> 00:12:02.890]  Well, I'm sure there's a lot more valid reasons as to why President Trump fired James Comey, and it could have to do with some of the corruption.
[00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.891]  It could have to do with Seth Rich.
[00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:11.236]  I mean, the fact that his murder has been covered up and there's been a lot of suspicious things there.
[00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:14.921]  But there's also another reason that we should be suspicious of James Comey.
[00:12:15.743 --> 00:12:22.333]  Apparently Comey lied to Congress about NSA surveillance of US citizens.
[00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:25.358]  Now a whistleblower named...
[00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:32.917]  This whistleblower, he actually, before I get to his name, I just want to tell you a little about what he did.
[00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:42.484]  He actually released 47 hard drives of highly classified information that he took from the NSA
[00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:50.828]  And he gave it over to the FBI and they gave him immunity in exchange for it.
[00:12:51.608 --> 00:13:00.912]  And he was convinced that the FBI was going to go ahead and file charges because this violated the rights of so many Americans.
[00:13:01.053 --> 00:13:02.533]  It was horrible.
[00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:07.075]  It was an obvious abuse and overreach and violated our Fourth Amendment.
[00:13:13.738 --> 00:13:19.122]  And so what's interesting here is that he feels betrayed.
[00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:22.244]  So now he's actually suing James Comey.
[00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:27.988]  So let's go ahead and I wanted to roll a quick clip of this interview discussing this.
[00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:28.529]  So let's roll.
[00:13:31.036 --> 00:13:46.473]  And Sarah, so what your report is saying here is you had an ex-Intel contractor suing Comey, saying that the FBI, on a mass scale, covered up mass civil liberties violations against Americans, and he has evidence.
[00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:51.979]  Isn't that a little bit bigger than Russia collusion with no evidence, as I just proved up to this point?
[00:13:52.857 --> 00:13:54.218]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:54.258 --> 00:13:57.080]  This is on a much larger scale.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:09.687]  We have seen the itemized reports of the 47, and we've posted them on our website at Circa.com, of the itemized list of hard drives that he gave to the FBI, signed by the FBI.
[00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:12.128]  We have all the documentation to show this.
[00:14:12.528 --> 00:14:13.649]  And think about this, Sean.
[00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:19.012]  He said, and I just spoke to him before I came to see you, he said he unmasked
[00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:24.415]  With the technology that he had with the NSA over 20 million Americans 600 million documents
[00:14:29.913 --> 00:14:33.695]  He said, if you stack those up, that's 30 miles high.
[00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:37.497]  30 miles high, but over 20 million Americans.
[00:14:37.537 --> 00:14:39.438]  And I said, well, what was it you were unmasking?
[00:14:39.858 --> 00:14:40.599]  He said everything.
[00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:45.982]  From their bank accounts, their homes, their records, phone conversations, emails.
[00:14:46.362 --> 00:14:48.983]  He was able to take down every single firewall.
[00:14:49.484 --> 00:14:53.686]  And it was so distressing because, you know, this is what he was directed to do.
[00:14:54.046 --> 00:14:55.707]  And when he tried to do the right thing,
[00:14:56.227 --> 00:15:00.691]  And he did, in his opinion, the right thing and got the immunity agreement from the FBI.
[00:15:01.031 --> 00:15:03.253]  The FBI decided to not move forward.
[00:15:03.773 --> 00:15:06.015]  To not move forward with that investigation, and that's all he did.
[00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:06.976]  Did Comey know about this?
[00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:14.181]  Because the headline is that he's suing Comey, alleging this mass cover-up of civil liberties violations, and you're telling me $20 million?
[00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:15.642]  $20 million?
[00:15:16.643 --> 00:15:17.644]  This is the biggest... $20 million.
[00:15:19.858 --> 00:15:37.345]  Well this whistleblower, Dennis Montgomery, he apparently was interviewed by the FBI for several hours and they collected the hard drives from him and it's supposedly on videotape this interview and
[00:15:38.886 --> 00:15:51.993]  It details and shows information in the hard drives of the fact that they were spying on millions of people and even some of them like Alex Jones and I'm sure a lot of InfoWars listeners and supporters as well.
[00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:57.395]  But the real question here is now, did FBI Director James Comey lie?
[00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:19.550]  To Congress, when he testified under oath at the House Intelligence Committee on March 20th, 2017, that after an exhaustive investigation, he could find no records to indicate that the Obama administration had placed Donald Trump under NSA electronic surveillance.
[00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:29.395]  So that could actually be really bad for Comey right there and it just goes to show that there's many other reasons why President Trump would think to fire James Comey.
[00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:32.196]  But now let's talk a little bit about Comey.
[00:16:32.557 --> 00:16:40.261]  He just released prepared statements for his testimony tomorrow and these statements are very, very interesting.
[00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:49.926]  Well, let's get down into the nitty gritty with some of this, but of course we will not have time to be going through the entire statement.
[00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:51.446]  It is extremely long.
[00:16:51.546 --> 00:17:00.131]  However, thankfully, Rob Dew and Owen Schroyer put together an awesome report where they're just really breaking down
[00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:09.296]  And going into this statement that James Comey had released in advance, and it's basically his testimony that he's going to talk about tomorrow.
[00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:10.697]  So make sure you guys check that out.
[00:17:10.737 --> 00:17:13.018]  It'll be on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:17:13.418 --> 00:17:15.880]  But first I wanted to talk about something really interesting here.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:22.304]  In one of the statements, James Comey says, I remained alone with President Trump to brief him.
[00:17:23.064 --> 00:17:29.086]  On some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.
[00:17:29.386 --> 00:17:38.229]  Now what's interesting here is it's not normal routine procedure to interview a president as the FBI director alone in a room.
[00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:39.949]  So why did they do that?
[00:17:40.489 --> 00:17:45.711]  Now James Comey is trying to act like you know it was Trump's idea but in reality
[00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:53.934]  As part of this statement here, it shows that it was a decision made by the FBI and basically him.
[00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:57.796]  He made this decision to interview Trump alone.
[00:17:58.236 --> 00:18:10.261]  Now he also talks about the IC leadership and they thought it was important for a variety of reasons and they said they knew that the media was about to publicly report the material that they were disclosing him.
[00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:15.342]  And they knew that there was an effort to compromise an incoming president.
[00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:21.044]  So it almost seems as though, was there some kind of an extortionary threat there?
[00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:24.185]  I mean, what was going on behind closed doors?
[00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:29.487]  And why did James Comey want to be alone to brief President Trump?
[00:18:30.207 --> 00:18:31.948]  It's just there's a lot of really
[00:18:32.888 --> 00:18:37.889]  Really suspicious stuff in this James Comey statement testimony that he's putting out.
[00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:43.570]  So it is sure to be a very interesting event tomorrow morning.
[00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:54.072]  Now make sure you guys tune in because David Knight will be breaking down and providing his expert analysis into James Comey's testimony.
[00:18:54.412 --> 00:18:57.413]  Remember guys, tomorrow 8.30 a.m.
[00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:58.753]  Central Time.
[00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:07.728]  Thanks to your support, InfoWars has been able to expand its operations against the globalists at this critical time.
[00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:15.733]  And it's absolutely essential that we expand in the face of the enemy, because as history shows, political movements only expand or contract.
[00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:19.656]  And that's why the globalists are hitting us with everything they've got.
[00:19:19.976 --> 00:19:23.579]  Censorship, demonization, attacks, misrepresentations.
[00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.640]  They're not just trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.101]  They're trying to fire Sean Hannity.
[00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:28.943]  They're trying to cold talk radio.
[00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:34.227]  They're trying to silence true, independent, nationalistic media.
[00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:38.090]  And InfoWars is at the very heart of that resistance.
[00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:49.680]  We all see the dumbed-down trendies that appear to be soulless and how they're obsessed with consumerism and criticizing capitalism as they walk around in their expensive Nike tennis shoes and have their slave-made iPhones.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.283]  So, I personally am disgusted by empty consumerism.
[00:19:54.073 --> 00:20:09.303]  But the globalists want to get rid of free markets because there is such a thing as positive consumerism historically, where people can use the power they have of the purse to actually support building free and independent economies.
[00:20:09.824 --> 00:20:13.006]  So you're not just getting amazing products when you go to InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.008]  But the enemy's striking back.
[00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:34.650]  So again, from myself, the entire InfoWars crew, I want to salute and thank all of you.

[00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:50.196]  We are all brothers and sisters together in this epic experiment that is life.
[00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:52.697]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:21:53.037 --> 00:22:00.601]  Visit InfoWarsTour.com today to get some of the best deals ever offered on incredible nutraceuticals, supplements, and so much more.
[00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.604]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:22:03.764 --> 00:22:10.228]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:13.410]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:22.957]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:23.917]  Caveman.
[00:22:24.157 --> 00:22:29.161]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:31.342]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.743]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:22:34.783 --> 00:22:39.563]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:22:39.923 --> 00:22:47.665]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:55.926]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:22:56.006 --> 00:23:00.667]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:21.490]  The country leers yet again at the spectacle that is former FBI Director James Comey as he is expected to refute President Trump's assertion of events surrounding the Russia-Trump campaign hoax that refuses to die.
[00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:40.406]  Were today's proceedings at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the Russia probe involving Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, DNI Director Dan Coats, NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers, and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe any indication of what we can expect tomorrow?
[00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:46.712]  I'm puzzled by your refusal to answer Senator Heinrich's question about a conversation you may have had with Director Comey.
[00:23:46.732 --> 00:23:49.054]  What's the basis of your refusal to answer that question?
[00:23:49.922 --> 00:23:51.432]  Sure, as I stated, I think first...
[00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:57.333]  I can't sit here and tell you whether or not that those conversations that you're referring to?
[00:23:57.773 --> 00:23:58.113]  Why not?
[00:23:58.174 --> 00:23:59.054]  Do you not remember them?
[00:23:59.594 --> 00:23:59.894]  No, no, no.
[00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:00.515]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:00.835]  I can't.
[00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:08.119]  I don't know whether conversations along the lines that you've described fall within the purview of what the special counsel is now investigating.
[00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:14.982]  Is there some prohibition in the law that I'm not familiar with that you can't discuss an item and that you've been asked directly a question?
[00:24:15.142 --> 00:24:22.186]  It would not be appropriate for me, sir, to discuss issues that are potentially within the purview of the special counsel's investigation.
[00:24:23.652 --> 00:24:26.033]  And that's the basis of your refusal to answer this question?
[00:24:26.053 --> 00:24:26.534]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:26.654 --> 00:24:29.955]  And that and knowing, of course, that Director Comey will be sitting behind this table tomorrow.
[00:24:29.976 --> 00:24:36.499]  So it's your position that the Special Counsel's entitled to ask you questions about this, but not an Oversight Committee of the United States Congress?
[00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:45.344]  It is my position that I have to be particularly careful about not stepping into the Special Counsel's lane, as they have now been authorized by the Department of Justice to investigate these matters.
[00:24:45.364 --> 00:24:52.108]  I don't understand why the Special Counsel's lane takes precedence over the lane of the United States Congress in investigating an Oversight Committee.
[00:24:52.808 --> 00:24:54.009]  Can you explain that distinction?
[00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:57.892]  Why does the special counsel get deference and not this committee?
[00:24:58.112 --> 00:25:00.755]  Sir, I'd be happy to... Is there some legal basis for that distinction?
[00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:13.525]  I would be happy to take that matter back to discuss it more fully with my general counsel and with the department, but right now that's the... On the record, I would like a legal justification for your refusal to answer the question today because I think it's a straightforward question.
[00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:16.507]  It's not involving discussions with the president.
[00:25:16.527 --> 00:25:18.369]  It's involving discussions with Mr. Comey.
[00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.970]  So then I'll ask both of you the same question.
[00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.971]  Why are you not answering these questions?
[00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:27.073]  Is there an invocation by the President of the United States of executive privilege?
[00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:28.173]  Is there or not?
[00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:29.414]  Not that I'm aware of.
[00:25:29.554 --> 00:25:31.234]  Then why are you not answering the questions?
[00:25:31.254 --> 00:25:32.575]  Because I feel it is inappropriate, Senator.
[00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:35.256]  What you feel isn't relevant, Admiral.
[00:25:36.096 --> 00:25:37.617]  What you feel isn't the answer.
[00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:38.417]  I stand accountable.
[00:25:38.477 --> 00:25:40.738]  Why are you not answering the questions?
[00:25:40.938 --> 00:25:43.059]  Is it an invocation of executive privilege?
[00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:45.000]  If there is, then let's know about it.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.901]  If there isn't, answer the questions.
[00:25:47.561 --> 00:25:48.883]  I stand by the comments I've made.
[00:25:48.903 --> 00:25:50.744]  I'm not interested in repeating myself, sir.
[00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:55.089]  And I don't mean that in a contentious way.
[00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:57.111]  Well, I do mean it in a contentious way.
[00:25:57.151 --> 00:25:59.073]  I don't understand why you're not answering our questions.
[00:25:59.153 --> 00:26:00.734]  When you were confirmed,
[00:26:04.113 --> 00:26:06.194]  Before the Armed Services Committee, you took an oath.
[00:26:06.214 --> 00:26:10.977]  Do you solemnly swear to give the committee the truth, the full truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
[00:26:10.997 --> 00:26:11.097]  I do.
[00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:12.198]  You answered yes to that.
[00:26:12.218 --> 00:26:19.442]  And I've also answered that those conversations were classified, and it is not appropriate in an open forum to discuss those classified conversations.
[00:26:19.582 --> 00:26:25.525]  What is classified about a conversation involving whether or not you should intervene in the FBI investigation?
[00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:27.246]  Sir, I stand by my previous comments.
[00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:29.988]  Mr. Coats, same series of questions.
[00:26:30.068 --> 00:26:33.050]  What's the basis for your refusal to answer these questions today?
[00:26:34.889 --> 00:26:38.271]  The basis is what I've previously explained.
[00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:43.113]  I do not believe it is appropriate for me to... What's the basis?
[00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:47.615]  I'm not satisfied with I do not believe it is appropriate or I do not feel I should answer.
[00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:49.996]  I want to understand a legal basis.
[00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.938]  You swore that oath to tell us the truth.
[00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:57.616]  The whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and today you are refusing to do so.
[00:26:57.796 --> 00:27:01.137]  What is the legal basis for your refusal to testify to this committee?
[00:27:01.358 --> 00:27:11.621]  I'm not sure I have a legal basis, but I'm more than willing to sit before this committee, and during its investigative process, in a closed session, and answer your questions.
[00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:13.702]  Well, we're going to be having a closed session in a few hours.
[00:27:13.722 --> 00:27:17.863]  Do you commit to me that you're going to answer these questions in a direct and unencumbered way?
[00:27:18.874 --> 00:27:28.425]  Well, that closed session you're going to have in a few hours involves the staff going over the technicalities of a number of these issues and doesn't involve us.
[00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:35.953]  Well, is it your testimony that when you are before this committee in a closed session you will answer these questions directly and unequivocally and without hesitation?
[00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:38.856]  I plan to do that, but I do have to
[00:27:40.973 --> 00:27:55.883]  Work through the legal counsel at the White House relative to whether or not they're going to exercise executive... I would argue that you have waived executive privilege by, in effect, testifying as to something that didn't happen.
[00:27:56.523 --> 00:28:05.029]  And I believe you opened the door to these questions, and it is my belief that you are inappropriately refusing to answer these questions today.
[00:28:05.069 --> 00:28:07.050]  People don't respect people that have sold out.
[00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.991]  They respect people that are actually for real.
[00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:09.512]  Dr. Corsi.
[00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:11.587]  Well, this is exactly right.
[00:28:11.627 --> 00:28:15.329]  I mean, Trump has never been in a game like this before.
[00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:17.690]  It's different on Wall Street.
[00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.690]  It's different in New York.
[00:28:19.191 --> 00:28:20.111]  He's built buildings.
[00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:21.172]  He's fought the unions.
[00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:23.013]  This is the deep state.
[00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:24.534]  They'll lie.
[00:28:24.554 --> 00:28:26.235]  They'll swear under oath.
[00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:27.595]  Comey will lie.
[00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:31.978]  They are lying this morning to the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:28:32.818 --> 00:28:42.084]  They're begging to be in private, you know, closed testimony where they can, you know, not be held accountable for what they're saying.
[00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:44.125]  This is a disgrace.
[00:28:44.246 --> 00:28:53.311]  And these, they, Trump has got to understand, when the GOP leadership comes and meets with him in the White House, they're going to all nod and smile.
[00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:58.955]  They go out of there and they sharpen their knives and they want to, they're just as happy to carve Donald Trump up and throw him into the Potomac River.
[00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:02.016]  And this is a life and death fight.
[00:29:02.396 --> 00:29:08.778]  Meanwhile, former President Obama fanned the flames of division from an event in Montreal, Canada.
[00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:15.180]  It's been clear for some time that the world is at an inflection point.
[00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:25.824]  In an age of instant information, where TV and Twitter can feed us a steady stream of bad news, and sometimes fake news.
[00:29:27.645 --> 00:29:34.769]  It can seem like the international order that we've created is being constantly tested and that the center may not hold.
[00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:44.454]  And in some cases, that leads people to search for certainty and control, and they can call for isolationism or nationalism.
[00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:48.936]  Or they can suggest rolling back the rights of others.
[00:29:50.597 --> 00:29:53.679]  Or simply, they can try to retreat.
[00:29:57.351 --> 00:30:04.035]  And suggest that we have no obligations beyond our borders or beyond our communities, beyond our tribe.
[00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:10.898]  That what's good for me and my immediate people is all that matters.
[00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:13.439]  Everybody else is on their own.
[00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:16.501]  Those instincts of retrenchment are understandable.
[00:30:18.402 --> 00:30:21.684]  They're tempting during changing times.
[00:30:24.745 --> 00:30:25.826]  In periods like this, people
[00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:30.572]  Looking for control and certainty, it's inevitable.
[00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:35.136]  And it's inevitable that our social arrangements and our politics will be disrupted.
[00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:48.070]  But it is important to remember that the world has gone through similar moments in the shift from, for example, agriculture to industry.
[00:30:50.987 --> 00:31:03.251]  And then, too, there was a temptation to respond to great uncertainty and economic upheaval by falling into the comforts of tribe and extreme nationalism and xenophobia and the politics of us versus them.
[00:31:04.412 --> 00:31:16.416]  In creating an international order that was based not just on self-interest but also on principles, the United States and Canada helped to lead that effort.
[00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:23.102]  Cooperating to make the world safer and more secure and a more just and prosperous place.
[00:31:24.162 --> 00:31:41.835]  If we begin to question the very real gains that have been made over the last several decades, and we violate our principles because of fear and uncertainty, then we can't expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world to continue.
[00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:46.939]  And instead, we are going to be inviting in those who argue that democracy doesn't work.
[00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:56.568]  That restrictions on the press are necessary and that intolerance and tribalism and organizing ourselves along ethnic lines are the answer to today's challenges.
[00:31:57.128 --> 00:32:06.854]  And on the eve of Comey's testimony, champion race baiter Texas Democratic Representative Al Green is readying articles of impeachment.
[00:32:06.954 --> 00:32:08.494]  This is your day to act.
[00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.115]  This is your day.
[00:32:10.675 --> 00:32:12.315]  I'm speaking to the American people.
[00:32:12.696 --> 00:32:14.136]  It is time for you to act.
[00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:17.937]  It is time for you to let us know where you stand.
[00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:25.219]  I've seen a poll that indicates that a majority now of those who are being polled are for impeachment.
[00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:28.240]  And I've seen another poll that says a plurality of those.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.922]  Whether it's a majority or plurality, let the American people weigh in.
[00:32:34.382 --> 00:32:40.224]  Green adding threats to the obstruction of justice that will likely be on full display.
[00:32:40.364 --> 00:32:41.304]  Washington D.C.
[00:32:41.404 --> 00:32:44.746]  restaurants are opening early to host viewings of the proceedings.
[00:32:44.946 --> 00:32:48.807]  The Comey debacle will begin June 8th at 10 a.m.
[00:32:48.947 --> 00:32:49.687]  Eastern Time.
[00:32:49.847 --> 00:32:51.708]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.628 --> 00:33:03.969]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:04.989]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:06.569]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.690]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.610]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.211]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:13.132]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:16.753]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.993]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.053 --> 00:36:58.813]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.913 --> 00:36:59.874]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:09.175 --> 00:37:11.936]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:37:11.956 --> 00:37:13.156]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:18.658]  In fact, even now, orders are being shoutsed into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:37:18.678 --> 00:37:19.598]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:20.659]  Damn it!
[00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:21.159]  Why?
[00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:27.921]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:37:28.421 --> 00:37:33.063]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation.
[00:37:33.443 --> 00:37:39.186]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:37:39.206 --> 00:37:40.186]  You designed it, sir.
[00:37:40.246 --> 00:37:41.167]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:37:41.187 --> 00:37:42.647]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:46.269]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:37:46.729 --> 00:37:55.593]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity... Cameras!
[00:37:55.613 --> 00:37:57.274]  We need cameras.
[00:37:57.574 --> 00:37:58.255]  How did this happen?
[00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:05.413]  Those who are more responsible than others, they will be held accountable.
[00:38:05.773 --> 00:38:11.238]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:13.489]  Look into a mirror.
[00:38:14.029 --> 00:38:17.330]  Ask yourself, what the Guy Fawkes is going on here?
[00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.371]  And of course, as you saw, Aviv from Vendetta, that's how most Americans know Guy Fawkes.
[00:38:21.491 --> 00:38:24.832]  The people in the UK understand this goes back to 1605.
[00:38:24.952 --> 00:38:28.192]  It's something they celebrate every November 5th.
[00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:30.153]  Remember, remember, the 5th of November.
[00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:31.433]  Gunpowder trees and plots.
[00:38:32.213 --> 00:38:39.055]  And so, this is something that has come around again to us as we're looking at this most recent terror attack in the UK.
[00:38:40.267 --> 00:38:41.147]  What is going on?
[00:38:41.787 --> 00:38:55.211]  We had an individual here who was documented by the BBC on television as a jihadi next door, and yet even after that, as he was known to his co-workers, he was working at the Westminster Tube Station.
[00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:59.652]  He had privileged access to the tunnels under Parliament.
[00:38:59.672 --> 00:39:08.794]  And of course, if you don't know the history, what Guy Fawkes was trying to do was to load gunpowder under the tunnels under Parliament to blow it up while Parliament was in session.
[00:39:09.787 --> 00:39:18.012]  If this guy had been the least bit interested, or the least bit efficient, it could have been far worse than it was.
[00:39:18.092 --> 00:39:25.897]  Instead, he did some ad hoc attacks with vans, with knives, instead of using his privileged access to do far worse.
[00:39:25.958 --> 00:39:28.459]  And it wasn't just the tunnels under Parliament.
[00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:32.102]  He also had worked at the Canada Water Station in the Docklands.
[00:39:32.122 --> 00:39:35.444]  He could have poisoned a massive number of people as well.
[00:39:36.533 --> 00:39:39.455]  So you have to ask yourself, truly, what is going on?
[00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:41.496]  Are they that stupid?
[00:39:42.077 --> 00:39:43.297]  Can they be that stupid?
[00:39:43.978 --> 00:39:45.119]  Of course they're not that stupid.
[00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:46.820]  They want these people here.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.901]  They allowed them to be exposed.
[00:39:48.921 --> 00:39:50.942]  They documented what they had done.
[00:39:51.443 --> 00:39:54.825]  They saw them unfurling and worshipping the ISIS flag.
[00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:56.806]  They documented that and left them in place.
[00:39:56.846 --> 00:40:00.268]  They're bringing people in and they're wearing a mask as well.
[00:40:01.249 --> 00:40:02.830]  They're not wearing the mask of Guy Fawkes.
[00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.512]  They're wearing the mask of political correctness.
[00:40:06.292 --> 00:40:07.853]  A mask that is going to be used to kill us.
[00:40:07.893 --> 00:40:09.493]  Of course, the terrorists have their masks as well.
[00:40:09.853 --> 00:40:16.275]  But if you look at this article, we see this photograph that was taken in May 2016 at the West Kensington Station during his training period.
[00:40:17.016 --> 00:40:22.558]  The year previously, he had starred in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadi Next Door.
[00:40:22.578 --> 00:40:29.080]  Now they said it was well known that he had appeared in this extremist documentary, but he was asked to leave the London Underground not because of that.
[00:40:29.841 --> 00:40:31.141]  But due to poor attendance.
[00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:38.963]  You see, we cannot have somebody who's going to be an effective jihadi terrorist, somebody who's going to be a mass murderer, if they just can't be enthusiastic about it.
[00:40:39.463 --> 00:40:43.424]  We have to get somebody in there who's got a little bit more grit to do this.
[00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:46.865]  A good example of this is what we saw in Iran today.
[00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:55.947]  We had some people wearing their masks there, some terrorists, some ISIS terrorists, dressed as women in burqas, and they assaulted the parliament there.
[00:40:56.747 --> 00:40:58.788]  Just as this, a little bit more competent.
[00:40:59.328 --> 00:41:05.752]  These people couldn't get themselves together to assault the UK Parliament, but these people in Iran did attack the Parliament.
[00:41:05.772 --> 00:41:12.956]  They came in with a suicide vest as well as AK-47s dressed as women because you can hide a lot of stuff under those burqas.
[00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:18.190]  A lot of people have said, well, we have to be concerned about women terrorists, women suicide bombers.
[00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.750]  Yes, of course.
[00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.913]  But of course, ISIS will even dress as women.
[00:41:21.953 --> 00:41:25.877]  They will self-identify as women so they can get this through.
[00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.499]  They had 12 people who have been killed in that area.
[00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:31.021]  They also attacked a shrine to Ayatollah Khomeini.
[00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:33.223]  You have to understand that in
[00:41:34.224 --> 00:41:35.525]  The Middle East.
[00:41:35.645 --> 00:41:37.946]  We have the Sunnis who hate the Shias.
[00:41:38.566 --> 00:41:40.227]  The Shias who hate the Wahhabis.
[00:41:40.528 --> 00:41:42.209]  The Wahhabis who hate the Sunnis.
[00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:46.951]  Everybody hates everybody as much as they hate the U.S., as much as they hate Israel.
[00:41:47.251 --> 00:41:49.593]  They hate everyone and they hate each other.
[00:41:50.273 --> 00:41:55.474]  They believe everybody is worshipping the devil if they aren't worshipping their false god of Allah.
[00:41:55.634 --> 00:41:59.235]  And of course, they all have a different idea as to who Allah is.
[00:41:59.715 --> 00:42:08.557]  Meanwhile, we had another report from Abu Dhabi of an immigrant there, a Pakistani immigrant going into another Arab country, Abu Dhabi, a man wearing a burqa.
[00:42:09.157 --> 00:42:12.877]  He lures in an 11-year-old boy, rapes and murders him.
[00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.818]  He said he knew that he wouldn't walk off with a man.
[00:42:15.677 --> 00:42:17.798]  But I could get him to walk off with a woman.
[00:42:17.818 --> 00:42:19.718]  See, these are the masks that they wear.
[00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:25.640]  What they want to have you see is not what they're doing.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.441]  One person has seen through this, though.
[00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:32.763]  We've had Angela Merkel, who, although she doesn't wear a mask, we've drawn her with a burka.
[00:42:33.483 --> 00:42:35.744]  She is clearly using the mask of political correctness.
[00:42:36.204 --> 00:42:39.245]  We have Theresa May telling us that they have to take
[00:42:40.498 --> 00:42:47.825]  Our free speech, as you just heard, and V for Vendetta, words always retain their power.
[00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.507]  That's what they have to destroy.
[00:42:49.527 --> 00:42:51.228]  They have to destroy our free speech.
[00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:53.851]  Our free speech is not the problem.
[00:42:54.452 --> 00:42:56.794]  The internet is not a breeding ground for terror.
[00:42:57.414 --> 00:43:02.539]  They have brought in a radical religion and the people who come in who are peaceful are those who do not practice it.
[00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:08.733]  If they believe, even tangentially, that religion, they are a breeding ground for terror.
[00:43:09.193 --> 00:43:14.356]  When someone explains to them what their false prophet actually said, and they believe it and act upon it.
[00:43:15.077 --> 00:43:21.701]  Now the Polish Prime Minister, days before these latest attacks in the UK, stood up and addressed the European Parliament.
[00:43:22.681 --> 00:43:23.102]  And she said,
[00:43:24.107 --> 00:43:26.488]  You have to rise up from your knees.
[00:43:26.888 --> 00:43:30.248]  Do not worship the flag of ISIS like this, you haughty dead.
[00:43:30.428 --> 00:43:36.770]  She said to them, rise up from your knees, rise up from your lethargy, or risk crying over your children every day.
[00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:51.933]  She said, if you can't see this, if you can't see the terrorism currently has the potential to hurt every country in Europe, and if you think that Poland should not defend itself, you're going hand in hand with those who point this weapon against Europe, against all of us.
[00:43:52.873 --> 00:44:02.231]  The Polish Prime Minister said that political correctness and unchecked mass migration of refugees into Europe will increase the threat, increase the frequency of terror attacks.
[00:44:02.592 --> 00:44:03.594]  That's precisely it.
[00:44:04.502 --> 00:44:07.885]  The political correctness is the breeding ground of terrorism.
[00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:11.287]  The mass migration is the breeding ground of terrorism.
[00:44:11.788 --> 00:44:26.339]  The wars for regime change in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere that have been created by the same people that the mainstream media gave a complete pass to last week at Bilderberg, those are the breeding grounds of terrorism and those are the people who are plotting it.
[00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:32.444]  She stood up and directly attacked them and she said this before the back and forth between Donald Trump
[00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:35.785]  And the Muslim mayor of London, Mayor Kahn.
[00:44:36.265 --> 00:44:38.866]  This is what she said several days even before the attack.
[00:44:39.727 --> 00:44:42.948]  The Prime Minister of Poland said, it needs to be said clearly and directly.
[00:44:43.068 --> 00:44:47.890]  This is an attack on Europe, on our culture, on our traditions.
[00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.052]  Do we want politicians who claim we have to get used to the attacks?
[00:44:52.772 --> 00:44:55.873]  Who describe the terrorist attacks as incidents?
[00:44:56.294 --> 00:44:59.515]  See, that's what Mayor Kahn would later do in just a few days.
[00:44:59.875 --> 00:45:01.456]  That's precisely the way that he would respond.
[00:45:02.284 --> 00:45:03.365]  Precisely the way that he responds.
[00:45:03.545 --> 00:45:07.228]  When Donald Trump called him on it, he was attacked.
[00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:14.395]  He was attacked by everybody here in the United States and the army of those who enforce the religion of political correctness.
[00:45:15.015 --> 00:45:16.757]  The religion of multiculturalism.
[00:45:17.137 --> 00:45:24.784]  She said, do we want that or do we want strong politicians who can see the danger and can fight against it efficiently?
[00:45:25.285 --> 00:45:26.245]  That is what we want.
[00:45:27.062 --> 00:45:28.003]  We want it to be addressed.
[00:45:28.223 --> 00:45:29.104]  We want it to be fought.
[00:45:29.484 --> 00:45:33.187]  We have to have a control of our border.
[00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:39.151]  That's why Donald Trump is so angry about the lack of the Justice Department's ability to get this travel ban through.
[00:45:39.171 --> 00:45:44.015]  We have to understand, when we go back into history, Donald Trump identifies with Andrew Jackson.
[00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:48.939]  Andrew Jackson said to the Supreme Court, he's made his decision, let's see him enforce it.
[00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:52.241]  He understood there is a constitutional division of power.
[00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:53.702]  Donald Trump needs to understand that.
[00:45:54.062 --> 00:45:55.584]  He needs to act upon that.
[00:45:56.164 --> 00:46:00.185]  Of course they will call him a dictator, a fascist if he does, but he has that power.
[00:46:00.605 --> 00:46:02.686]  Andrew Jackson used that power.
[00:46:03.206 --> 00:46:04.326]  He used it for a bad purpose.
[00:46:04.366 --> 00:46:09.007]  He used it to drive the Cherokee out of their lands, the Vale of Tears.
[00:46:09.907 --> 00:46:19.370]  But this can be used for a good purpose, to keep our land from becoming a Vale of Tears as they destroy our children, as the Prime Minister of Poland said.
[00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:20.870]  And I'll finish with these words.
[00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.631]  She said, either Europe will get off of its knees and start to seriously consider counteraction measures,
[00:46:25.131 --> 00:46:31.576]  But that means rejecting political correctness, or these types of incidents will continue.
[00:46:32.096 --> 00:46:36.120]  We will turn our country into a trail of tears.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:45.907]  If we do not enforce the law, Donald Trump has the constitutional authority, he has the direct legal authority to determine who is allowed into this country and who isn't.
[00:46:46.067 --> 00:46:49.690]  And if the Justice Department won't fight for it, we need a different Justice Department.
[00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.172]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:02.972 --> 00:47:07.755]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:10.017]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.397 --> 00:47:15.401]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.761 --> 00:47:21.205]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:28.189]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.991]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.061]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.081 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:11.533]  James Comey is scheduled to testify tomorrow morning.
[00:49:11.813 --> 00:49:20.061]  So let's hear from Roger Stone, who can provide us with some insight into Comey and perhaps some connections to the Clintons.
[00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:21.802]  Let's hear it from Roger Stone.
[00:49:21.822 --> 00:49:31.131]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer, who's obviously trying to do the young Abraham Lincoln thing.
[00:49:33.052 --> 00:49:38.235]  All Washington is of course focused on the coming shootout at the OK Corral.
[00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:48.602]  The classic clash between James Comey testifying before Congress and Donald Trump sitting at his Twitter feed.
[00:49:49.683 --> 00:49:55.627]  This has the potential to be mesmerizing as both sides gear up for battle.
[00:49:56.803 --> 00:50:06.874]  Mr. Comey is widely expected to accuse the President of impeding the investigation into General Flynn and asking him to end it.
[00:50:08.304 --> 00:50:36.559]  If Mr. Comey wants to talk about obstruction, and he wants to talk about memos, because it is alleged that he wrote a memo, according to the New York Times, that he, pardon me, he received a memo, according to the Times, he believed the memo to be real, and that memo alleges obstruction, at the highest level,
[00:50:37.472 --> 00:50:39.393]  of the Obama administration.
[00:50:40.154 --> 00:50:46.478]  Now, the memo has been since proved to be a forgery, but Mr. Comey believed it.
[00:50:46.518 --> 00:50:49.741]  Therefore, he thought there was an obstruction of justice.
[00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:53.323]  He did not report this as an officer of the court.
[00:50:53.904 --> 00:50:56.866]  Instead, he furthered that obstruction.
[00:50:57.786 --> 00:51:05.892]  This would, of course, explain why his comments about Hillary Clinton were so caustic, yet he reached a conclusion
[00:51:06.946 --> 00:51:10.267]  That was the result of a political fix above him.
[00:51:11.587 --> 00:51:15.768]  To me, this shreds any credibility regarding Mr. Comey.
[00:51:16.468 --> 00:51:26.751]  Mr. Comey alleges to the media that he has contemporaneous memos written to himself saying that the president was impeding justice.
[00:51:27.511 --> 00:51:31.512]  Why then did he not report these as an officer of the court?
[00:51:32.012 --> 00:51:34.113]  Why are we only learning this now?
[00:51:35.273 --> 00:51:45.976]  The acting Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstiel, in this matter, says that there is no evidence of collusion by Donald Trump and his associates.
[00:51:46.737 --> 00:52:00.241]  Perhaps the President asked him to wrap up the investigation of General Flynn, because based on what we have seen so far, while General Flynn may have done some things that were inadvisable, perhaps even stupid,
[00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:07.058]  They didn't constitute crimes, nor did they constitute collusion with the Russian state.
[00:52:08.318 --> 00:52:13.422]  Trump can only win the shootout tomorrow with an offensive strategy.
[00:52:14.282 --> 00:52:15.863]  I remind you of Stone's rules.
[00:52:16.483 --> 00:52:18.405]  Attack, attack, attack.
[00:52:19.445 --> 00:52:22.607]  Mr. Comey has plenty in his record to attack.
[00:52:23.988 --> 00:52:30.252]  HSBC, the international bank, has caught money laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars for the drug industry.
[00:52:31.385 --> 00:52:36.249]  Mr. Comey ensures that they pay a hefty fine, but no one goes to jail.
[00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:42.534]  Thereupon, Mr. Comey goes on the board of directors at HSBC.
[00:52:43.354 --> 00:52:45.056]  How much was he paid?
[00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:57.826]  He also is associated with the various interests, including Lockheed, which is, without any question, the most corrupt
[00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:04.793]  A company and defense contractor in the country.
[00:53:05.514 --> 00:53:10.317]  They have enormous, egregious violations of law and cost overruns.
[00:53:10.977 --> 00:53:19.303]  Again, no one goes to jail, their problems are all worked out, and they pay fines which they can well afford.
[00:53:19.323 --> 00:53:23.045]  And then they pay Mr. Comey $6 million.
[00:53:25.393 --> 00:53:33.098]  The fact that James Comey was the prosecutor in the Sandy Rich, pardon me, the Sandy Berger affair.
[00:53:33.738 --> 00:53:34.999]  You remember Sandy Berger.
[00:53:35.619 --> 00:53:39.402]  He was Bill Clinton's national security advisor.
[00:53:40.222 --> 00:53:42.644]  He slipped into the National Archives.
[00:53:43.504 --> 00:53:52.228]  He talked a docent into leaving the room because he said he had to take a classified super-secret cell phone call.
[00:53:52.968 --> 00:54:03.173]  He then stuffed documents down the front of his pants that proved that Bill Clinton could have taken out Osama bin Laden, but didn't.
[00:54:04.653 --> 00:54:08.295]  The prosecutor in this case, James Comey, the charges brought?
[00:54:08.915 --> 00:54:09.215]  None.
[00:54:09.836 --> 00:54:12.177]  Covering for the Clinton crime family.
[00:54:13.223 --> 00:54:15.404]  Then there's the Mark Rich matter.
[00:54:15.464 --> 00:54:16.705]  You remember Mark Rich.
[00:54:17.626 --> 00:54:19.867]  He was an international fugitive from justice.
[00:54:20.288 --> 00:54:22.729]  A man who stole hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:28.493]  He funneled huge million dollar contributions to the Clinton Foundation through his wife.
[00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:38.900]  He skipped the entire pardon process only to receive a pardon at the last minute from President Clinton.
[00:54:39.682 --> 00:54:44.105]  Now James Comey had actually been the prosecutor in the Mark Rich case.
[00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:55.952]  And then he was appointed to oversee whether there had been any impropriety of Mr. Comey's purchase, pardon me, Mr. Rich's purchase of a pardon.
[00:54:56.632 --> 00:55:00.034]  And again, no charges were brought.
[00:55:01.575 --> 00:55:08.139]  Who can forget that Mr. Comey emerged in the beginning as an assistant director of the Whitewater Inquiry.
[00:55:09.312 --> 00:55:16.375]  Whitewater is a complicated real estate transaction in which no one really makes money.
[00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:29.121]  But Bill Clinton is able to extract $850,000 to finance the media blitz that returned him to the governor's mansion after losing in the previous election.
[00:55:29.982 --> 00:55:34.044]  That sets the stage for his election as President of the United States.
[00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:39.669]  Jim and Susan McDougal, friends of the Clintons, take the fall.
[00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:47.118]  McDougal goes to prison and dies there when denied the medication he needed for survival.
[00:55:47.879 --> 00:55:54.146]  And Susan McDougal refuses to testify against the president and is temporarily jailed.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:00.165]  Mr. Comey assures that no charges are brought against the Clintons.
[00:56:00.986 --> 00:56:11.536]  So this FBI director, call him J. Edgar Comey if you will, had become a law unto himself.
[00:56:12.777 --> 00:56:18.162]  He would decide what crimes he would investigate and what crimes he would not.
[00:56:19.639 --> 00:56:38.832]  It's important to note when Senator Chuck Grassley, who's the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Comey about the fraudulent memo which claimed obstruction of justice by Loretta Lynch and the Clinton campaign, Mr. Comey declined to discuss it.
[00:56:39.993 --> 00:56:47.098]  The New York Times tells us that there was widespread belief within the FBI that the document in question was a forgery.
[00:56:47.805 --> 00:56:57.493]  Yet Mr. Comey chose to embrace it and based his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton on the basis of this memo.
[00:56:58.574 --> 00:57:03.237]  This, to me, should be a crux of the attack on his credibility.
[00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:05.419]  He has no credibility.
[00:57:05.619 --> 00:57:11.144]  He is a political animal who has, without any question, politicized the FBI.
[00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:17.029]  Well, thank you so much, Roger Stone, for that mind-blowing insight.
[00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:30.815]  And remember, guys, InfoWars is providing special live coverage tomorrow of James Comey's testimony, and David Knight will be analyzing his testimony and breaking it down for you guys.
[00:57:31.255 --> 00:57:38.398]  Well, this is Millie Weaver signing off for the InfoWars Nightly News, and tune in tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[00:57:38.498 --> 00:57:38.878]  Central.
[00:57:55.034 --> 00:57:58.515]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:57:58.535 --> 00:58:01.996]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:58:02.036 --> 00:58:06.858]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:58:06.878 --> 00:58:09.779]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:58:09.899 --> 00:58:15.821]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:19.623]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.645]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:31.270]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:41.077]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:58:41.178 --> 00:58:46.302]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:58:46.822 --> 00:58:50.485]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:58:50.585 --> 00:58:52.627]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:58:52.707 --> 00:58:53.668]  Is it one world?
[00:58:53.728 --> 00:58:55.109]  The central bank was in charge.
[00:58:55.189 --> 00:58:57.551]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:58:57.911 --> 00:58:58.992]  InfoWars.com
