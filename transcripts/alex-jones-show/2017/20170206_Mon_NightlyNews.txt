[00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.333]  Welcome to Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:21.093]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.115]  It's Monday, February the 6th, 2017.
[00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:25.296]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:34.681]  Tonight, President Donald Trump tells Iran they are playing with fire.
[00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:44.167]  This after a series of ballistic missiles were tested in Iran last week, prompting Washington to impose new sanctions on Tehran.
[00:00:45.307 --> 00:00:51.991]  Meanwhile, the Iranian government says it will only take 7 minutes for their missiles to hit Tel Aviv.
[00:00:53.873 --> 00:00:51.991]  10.
[00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.936]  Possession of false documents and fake social security numbers is no problem.
[00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:05.400]  This, according to the President of the California State Senate, who says half his family are in the U.S.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.341]  illegally.
[00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:12.385]  All that plus Trump's no-BS pick for EU ambassador.
[00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:20.099]  That's up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.523]  Last Friday, Iran fired a missile.
[00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:06.684]  Now, this was part of a test.
[00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:10.327]  They said that this was not a test or a message for President Trump.
[00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:16.551]  Nevertheless, and of course we have the Iranian president saying that Trump is new to politics and still has a lot to learn.
[00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.393]  Maybe, maybe not.
[00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:23.035]  Maybe they should learn that Donald Trump means what he says.
[00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:26.738]  People continue to think that he doesn't really mean what he's talking about.
[00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:30.200]  Now, Iran said on Monday that this was not intended to send a message.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.780]  Nevertheless,
[00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:40.531]  After they launched that missile on Saturday, they pointed out on their official news sources, they said only seven minutes are needed for an Iranian missile to hit Tel Aviv.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.584]  This was put out by a senior member of the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission.
[00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:54.171]  It also was given to the semi-official Fars News Agency and that was done the day after the test was done.
[00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.454]  Now this is not the first time the Iranians have done a test.
[00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:01.897]  This is the first time since Donald Trump has been president that they've done one of these tests.
[00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:07.322]  But of course these are in direct violation of agreements as well as in direct violation of UN prohibitions.
[00:04:07.802 --> 00:04:12.705]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post says Trump wants to push back against Iran, but Iran is now more powerful than ever.
[00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:16.147]  And evidently, that's what the Iranians think as well.
[00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:17.308]  I'm not sure that that's true.
[00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:21.130]  This, of course, will be portrayed as anti-Islamic.
[00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.535]  Nevertheless, even the Washington Post points out in the opening sentence here, President Trump's tough talk on Iran is winning him friends in the Arab world.
[00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:32.597]  We have to understand that the Arab world is not monolithic.
[00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.875]  The Islamic religion is not monolithic either.
[00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:44.021]  There are a lot of people, especially in Islam, especially amongst Arabs in the Middle East, who would like to see Iran kept in its place.
[00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.183]  They consider it to be as dangerous as the U.S.
[00:04:46.423 --> 00:04:48.365]  and Israel consider it to be dangerous.
[00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:52.228]  So this is not something that is simply America or Israel.
[00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:54.810]  This is also Arabs who are concerned about this.
[00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:08.377]  Now today, Donald Trump went to CENTCOM in Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base, and of course they are the group that has been tasked with the Middle East, and he talked about terrorism, foreign and domestic.
[00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:09.958]  He said that the U.S.
[00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:13.000]  and its allies will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.240]  Here's what Donald Trump had to say.
[00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:22.024]  We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction.
[00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:22.745]  You've seen that.
[00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:30.669]  We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country.
[00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:42.559]  We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in.
[00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.664]  Not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.
[00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:54.054]  Donald Trump had said that Iran was put on notice after they did that missile test.
[00:05:54.094 --> 00:06:01.859]  And of course, the way that he put them on notice was to go to Central Command to talk about how he's going to defeat radical Islamic terrorism domestically and abroad.
[00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:08.684]  And also, as you just heard, he said, we're going to let in people who love us, who love our country, not people who want to destroy us and destroy our country.
[00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:20.130]  So we have to understand if these countries are dangerous enough that we have to send bombs and send troops, then maybe we ought to be careful about those who come into this country.
[00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:29.995]  He also pointed out to those at Central Command that he was going to give them the tools and resources that they needed to do the job, and pointed out how he was not going to just give a blank check to the military-industrial complex.
[00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:36.818]  And of course, we've already seen Trump save $700 million by negotiating the contract, renegotiating the contract on the F-35 program.
[00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.297]  He also pointed out, as he believed, that Iran was acting this way because they were emboldened by the weakness of Barack Obama.
[00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:46.118]  I believe that's true.
[00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:47.880]  He said, Iran is playing with fire.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.765]  They don't appreciate how kind President Obama was to them.
[00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:52.852]  Not me.
[00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:54.333]  That's what he said on Friday.
[00:06:54.934 --> 00:07:06.101]  Now at the same time we see another conflict that is being addressed and of course that is the conflict between the Trump administration and the globalists themselves and the heart of that right now is the European Union.
[00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:17.848]  I think it's interesting that that is the focus of the Trump administration at this point not as much on the United Nations and of course the man that Trump has picked as his choice for ambassador to the European Union
[00:07:18.548 --> 00:07:26.791]  Is Ted Malek, and of course he's a good example of how Trump has gone in and picked people who essentially know what the plans to the Death Star are.
[00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:33.854]  This guy, his book is Davos, Aspen, and Yale, My Life Behind the Elite Curtain as a Global Sherpa.
[00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.234]  He's very well connected.
[00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:45.158]  He has been the person as a Sherpa, that's essentially what they call an executive that prepares for a summit conference, just like the Sherpas help the mountain climbers get up Everest.
[00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.759]  He's the guy who put this all together.
[00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:53.461]  So, he's one of these guys who really made it all work for the globalists, and now he's going to take them apart.
[00:07:54.141 --> 00:08:07.744]  And of course, he's making the rounds in Europe talking to the BBC, talking to RT this last weekend, made some amazing announcements, and got into people's faces like our own American version of Nigel Farage.
[00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:12.065]  First of all, he said when he was talking to RT, he said, the Davos man is dead.
[00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:15.466]  And you have to understand what the Davos man is.
[00:08:16.286 --> 00:08:22.988]  This refers to the global elite of wealthy whose members view themselves as completely international.
[00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:29.231]  This is something that was created this term, the Davos Man, was created by a political scientist, Samuel Huntington.
[00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.893]  He said, they are people who have little need for national loyalty, who view national boundaries as obstacles.
[00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:46.941]  That thankfully are vanishing and they see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate their, the elites, global operations.
[00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:51.825]  The first person you think of when you hear that, isn't it, is George Soros.
[00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:54.466]  Of course people like Bill Gates also believe that as well.
[00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:58.909]  But that's a very concise definition of who these elitists are.
[00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:01.940]  They don't see themselves as belonging to any country.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.482]  They see themselves as transcending.
[00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:07.646]  They see themselves as more important than any country or any national boundary.
[00:09:08.087 --> 00:09:10.429]  And as a matter of fact, they want to destroy national boundaries.
[00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.093]  And they want to destroy the people who work within those.
[00:09:14.113 --> 00:09:15.995]  They have nothing but contempt for those who are lower down.
[00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:16.896]  So he said,
[00:09:17.637 --> 00:09:20.919]  In his interview with RT, he said, the Davos man is dead.
[00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:23.180]  He said, look at the people that they're talking to at Davos.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.441]  He said, these are people who are on their way out, people like John Kerry.
[00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:31.204]  And then, of course, he went on the BBC, and he shocked them with his bluntness.
[00:09:31.244 --> 00:09:37.607]  He said, obviously, Trump does not want a union, a European Union, that is tilted toward Germany.
[00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:47.747]  He said he is going to deal with nations bilaterally, but he's not going to deal with a supranational bureaucracy that is not democratic.
[00:09:48.507 --> 00:09:50.508]  And that's precisely what the European Union is.
[00:09:50.568 --> 00:09:53.069]  He said Trump won't cow down to the powers that be.
[00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.231]  He'll speak his mind even if it gets him in trouble or is held in disregard by others.
[00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:59.472]  It used to be called honesty.
[00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:07.715]  But now in this current age, he said, of baby talk and political correctness and mostly bullshit, it's now regarded as dishonesty.
[00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:11.837]  And that, of course, was a very shocking bit of frankness coming out of him.
[00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:14.378]  And then he kind of channeled Nigel Farage.
[00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:22.281]  Remember when Nigel Farage said of the first European president, Herman Von Rumpuy, he said, you have the demeanor of a third-rank bank clerk.
[00:10:22.781 --> 00:10:28.384]  Who are you to take away an elected official in Greece and impose a banker
[00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:32.945]  In the heart of the place that created democracy.
[00:10:33.285 --> 00:10:47.389]  And so today, or over this weekend, Ted Malik said of Mr. Juncker, the current European president, he said he was a very adequate mayor, I think, of some city in Luxembourg, and maybe he should go back there and do that again.
[00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.511]  So that's pretty amazing.
[00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:53.933]  But he also says that Trump is not going to back down.
[00:10:53.973 --> 00:10:55.174]  Trump is not going to be cowed down.
[00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:59.658]  And of course, Ted Malik is not going to be bowed down as well.
[00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:08.164]  One other thing that he said that really threw the gauntlet down and got them talking, and this was about a week and a half ago, he said that he was part of the State Department.
[00:11:08.204 --> 00:11:11.386]  He was a scholar diplomat with the State Department.
[00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:14.809]  He said I was part of the organization that helped to bring down the Soviet Union.
[00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:18.878]  And he said, maybe there's another union that needs a little taming.
[00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:21.239]  And of course by that he meant the European Union.
[00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:25.161]  He supports Brexit and he believes that the Euro is doomed.
[00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.002]  But of course the people have pushed back at this.
[00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:32.064]  The European Union has said that they want to block Trump's appointment.
[00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:37.787]  To which Ted Malik said, well maybe they don't realize that Trump won the American election.
[00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:44.413]  And that it is the prerogative of countries to choose who they want to send as ambassadors to other places.
[00:11:44.713 --> 00:11:46.715]  And even The Guardian agreed with that.
[00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:51.540]  Even The Guardian said it was never a requirement of envoys to the Soviet Union that they support communism.
[00:11:52.256 --> 00:12:04.999]  It wasn't a requirement of those who go to Saudi Arabia that they support Islam or that they support the misogyny policies that come out of Saudi Arabia or even that they would decline to support Sharia law or communism.
[00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.399]  That was never a requirement.
[00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:16.741]  So we've had a long tradition where we have ambassadors sent to places that don't necessarily agree with the policies of those countries and yet in the European Union
[00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:29.444]  The globalists who are losing so badly, just as we see here in America in the riots that are happening in the streets, they are desperate to censor and shut down anyone that they cannot defeat in terms of debate.
[00:12:29.484 --> 00:12:32.645]  And of course, I don't think they're going to be able to defeat Ted Malik.
[00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:37.747]  He is more than capable of handling himself, as I said before, I think he is America's Nigel Farage.
[00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:48.373]  Now one of the things that we should remember when we look at globalism is it's more than just about what's happening at the national borders and more than just moving people around.
[00:12:49.013 --> 00:12:57.438]  Moving people around has been a tool of the globalists because it allows them to create conflicts within countries, but it also allows them to get slave labor.
[00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:13.449]  And having open border and so-called free trade allows them to use the free labor of slaves in China and elsewhere to essentially take over markets from people who are working with domestic labor in America, for example.
[00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.232]  And as we look at this, we need to understand where this is all headed.
[00:13:17.252 --> 00:13:20.635]  There's been several stories that have been on the Drudge Report over the weekend
[00:13:21.295 --> 00:13:27.618]  Talking about the end of employees, the end of human labor, Amazon having stores that are going to be manned by robots.
[00:13:27.638 --> 00:13:34.642]  But I want to start with this story about automobiles, because of course they're not going to allow you to drive cars.
[00:13:35.122 --> 00:13:37.644]  Understand, it is not going to be your option.
[00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.366]  It is not going to be one of these things where if you like your car, you can keep your car.
[00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:44.860]  We've heard that about Obamacare and we saw very quickly that that wasn't true.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.162]  We told you it wasn't true before it happened.
[00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:52.905]  They are not going to allow some people to drive cars while they have these robotic cars on the road.
[00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:54.505]  And let me give you an example why.
[00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:57.607]  CarDriver was talking about how great Waymo.
[00:13:57.647 --> 00:14:02.029]  Now Waymo is the car company that Google spun off for their smart cars.
[00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.831]  So Waymo, they said, looks to be way out in front.
[00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:09.153]  They're doing much better than all the other 10 companies that are working on self-driving cars.
[00:14:09.193 --> 00:14:10.894]  So how good is Waymo doing?
[00:14:11.374 --> 00:14:16.018]  Well they say that they only have to have a disengagement once every 5,000 miles.
[00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:17.079]  What is a disengagement?
[00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:25.865]  Well that means that they have a software malfunction that is a complete breakdown or and or human drivers have to intervene and take over driving the car.
[00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:32.891]  So these things are very far from being able to give us zero deaths on the highway as they're promising.
[00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:34.517]  Think about that.
[00:14:35.138 --> 00:14:44.761]  An accident, if you let these things go into fully autonomous mode at this point, you would have an accident every 5,000 miles, about as frequently as you change your oil or rotate your tires.
[00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.302]  But it's far worse for Mercedes-Benz.
[00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:49.603]  They're not doing as well as Waymo.
[00:14:49.643 --> 00:14:57.126]  They have to have a disengagement, in other words, they have a software malfunction, total software malfunction, where human drivers need to intervene.
[00:14:57.446 --> 00:14:59.847]  They have that happen once every two miles.
[00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.360]  But folks, it is coming.
[00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:06.283]  And it is coming because the government wants it to come.
[00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:11.027]  The government wants to put us into an Agenda 21 reservation system.
[00:15:11.668 --> 00:15:18.813]  They want to track everything that we do, follow us everywhere we go, and tax us for every mile that we travel.
[00:15:19.654 --> 00:15:21.995]  And they want the partnership of the corporations to do this.
[00:15:22.135 --> 00:15:24.236]  This is going to be a kind of economic fascism.
[00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:37.121]  There will be favors handed out to a few car companies that will be allowed to have the taxi, the robotic taxi business, and they are jockeying for favor with the governments at this point.
[00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:43.023]  That's what the Audi commercial, as I pointed out on the radio on Friday, that's what the Audi commercial was all about.
[00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.464]  They weren't trying to sell cars to women.
[00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:52.084]  They weren't showing them a dramatic soapbox derby race and saying, that was you as a child, but now you can drive an Audi.
[00:15:52.144 --> 00:15:54.306]  No, they were complaining about equal pay for equal women.
[00:15:54.767 --> 00:16:05.235]  They didn't show anybody riding cars, and they didn't show that as being the fulfillment of a girl's dream, her crowning accomplishment in the field of business to be able to afford an Audi.
[00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.356]  They weren't selling the driving experience.
[00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:13.827]  They were complaining about unequal treatment, so their target market was not women, even.
[00:16:14.187 --> 00:16:18.070]  Their target market was the government, for which they hope they're going to get favors from.
[00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.072]  Wall Street Journal points out, the end of employees.
[00:16:21.112 --> 00:16:26.295]  They say, never before have big employers tried so hard to hand over chunks of their business to contractors.
[00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:32.380]  From Google to Walmart, the strategy prunes costs for firms and job security for millions of workers.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.100]  We're good.
[00:16:50.766 --> 00:17:00.851]  And they're going to start outsourcing away from the slave labor of China, or India, or third world countries, and they're going to start outsourcing to machines, to robots.
[00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:07.334]  That is the true threat to human independence, to our lives as individual humans.
[00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.756]  And we've seen this happen before with the Indian reservations.
[00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:30.079]  That's a perfect example where they were boxed in, not allowed freedom or independence, and even as we see with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, they would shut down many independent Indian businesses, not allowing them the freedom to start their own business, not allowing them the freedom to travel, taking their children away from them in the early days, transporting them across the country.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.101]  To be schooled away from their parents.
[00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:40.205]  All of these are tactics that they have now refined and sophisticated for the 21st century.
[00:17:40.705 --> 00:17:50.931]  And you have to understand that the end run of all of this movement away towards automation as we see with Amazon having a supermarket that only has three employees before they have a supermarket that has none.
[00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:52.432]  Who is going to buy their goods?
[00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:53.812]  They don't care.
[00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:55.433]  They want to contain you.
[00:17:55.694 --> 00:17:56.714]  They want to control you.
[00:17:56.994 --> 00:18:00.917]  The cars are a big part of it, but of course the work is a big part of it as well.
[00:18:01.277 --> 00:18:12.904]  Once they pacify you, and you're unable to do anything, and the surveillance network, and you've been pacified so that you don't have any skills, you don't have any ambition, then it's time for the soft kill.
[00:18:13.544 --> 00:18:14.845]  Stay with us, we're going to take a quick break.
[00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:23.749]  We're going to be right back and we're going to talk about the fight about the immigration travel ban, the temporary travel ban that Donald Trump has put in, and the pushback by the judge.
[00:18:24.129 --> 00:18:24.889]  What's behind that?
[00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:25.730]  Will it be taken down?
[00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.390]  We'll be right back.
[00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:43.226]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:43.486 --> 00:18:45.549]  You better believe you got one!
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros, the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:46.762]  And Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:51.325]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Central Texas News Center in Austin.
[00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:58.749]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today for 30-50% off specials while supplies last plus free shipping or call 1-888-253-3139
[00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:11.308]  Today was a deadline for legal briefs to be filed by the government in defense of Trump's travel ban to certain countries.
[00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:12.910]  And of course, that was going to be done today.
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:18.094]  Either way, it looks like this case is going to go before the Supreme Court, win or lose.
[00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:24.640]  Now, we've had a lot of national security advisors and foreign policy officials, State Department officials, who have now weighed on this.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.745]  We also have 100 tech companies that have weighed in on the so-called Trump travel ban.
[00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:32.166]  And let me just say this.
[00:23:32.887 --> 00:23:44.515]  For all the people who are so upset and calling this a Muslim ban, saying that you're banning Muslims, were they ever concerned about the fact that Obama was bombing Muslims?
[00:23:45.256 --> 00:23:49.859]  Are they calling for the bombing of Muslims to stop in these seven countries?
[00:23:50.359 --> 00:24:00.547]  Understand that in all seven of these countries, as we will see, we have not only bombings going on, but troops being put there, with the possible exception of Iran, and of course things are heating up there as well.
[00:24:00.867 --> 00:24:10.775]  But in all the other six countries, we do have American forces on the ground, and there are bombing campaigns that are being carried on by us, or directly, or by our surrogates.
[00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:15.078]  Why isn't the left, who is so concerned about humanity,
[00:24:15.879 --> 00:24:19.864]  And humanitarian causes, why are they not calling for the bombing to be stopped?
[00:24:19.884 --> 00:24:23.668]  Why are they only concerned about the fact that people are coming into this country?
[00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:31.877]  Now we see, as we see, Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice, former CIA directors, Michael Hayden, Michael Morrell,
[00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.643]  Understand that these people are all on the same side.
[00:24:36.264 --> 00:24:46.018]  Condoleezza Rice was with Bush, Madeleine Albright was with the Clintons, and yet they're all part of the globalist establishment, the perpetual war establishment.
[00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.210]  That's what we see.
[00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:50.013]  They are opposing Donald Trump on this travel ban.
[00:24:50.373 --> 00:24:53.756]  They want to use this as an excuse to bring people into this country.
[00:24:54.256 --> 00:25:03.804]  We first see tech leaders have put together nearly 100 companies and a legal brief, have filed a sympathetic brief here in this argument going before the court.
[00:25:04.764 --> 00:25:09.286]  They said that it inflicts significant harm on American business.
[00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:13.107]  And I have to ask them, really, why would that be?
[00:25:13.227 --> 00:25:17.048]  Because these are the companies, these tech companies that want to use H-1B visas.
[00:25:17.728 --> 00:25:23.711]  They want to bring people in and use them to replace American engineers at half the price, or less.
[00:25:23.971 --> 00:25:27.632]  This is also something we've seen from Disney, using a variant of that.
[00:25:28.172 --> 00:25:28.592]  We're good to go.
[00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.818]  Are Somalia and Libya high-tech centers?
[00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:52.519]  Really?
[00:25:52.639 --> 00:25:55.960]  Do we have to get state-of-the-art engineers from those areas?
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.921]  I don't think there are any state-of-the-art engineers in those areas.
[00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.563]  They aren't in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria or Yemen either.
[00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:05.864]  Those are not places that you go to to get
[00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:08.385]  I don't think so.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.521]  Are you kidding me?
[00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:39.162]  They've been doing this all along.
[00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:40.603]  That's why we have this situation.
[00:26:41.403 --> 00:26:50.250]  Meanwhile, we've got Kerry, Panetta, we've got Madeleine Albright, we have Condoleezza Rice, all of them saying this is going to endanger troops in the field.
[00:26:50.290 --> 00:27:02.459]  And that gets back to what I just said, in the sense that in all of these countries, with the possible exception of Iran, we don't know if there's troops in Iran or not, but we do know that they have put troops in Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen.
[00:27:03.735 --> 00:27:20.944]  And again, why is it more of a danger to the troops to say that we're not going to allow people that we say these are countries who say they're dangerous enough, there's enough terrorism or whatever going on there, whether that's true or not, we say they're dangerous enough that we have to send bombs, we have to send troops, but we cannot vet the people who are coming into this country.
[00:27:21.044 --> 00:27:29.628]  And the fact that people cannot immigrate into this country is supposed to be more of an irritant to people in that country than if we drop bombs on their weddings?
[00:27:29.988 --> 00:27:30.709]  I don't think so.
[00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:32.469]  Meanwhile we have
[00:27:33.972 --> 00:27:39.273]  The anti-Trump protesters are blocking ambulances that are trying to rush people to the hospital.
[00:27:39.314 --> 00:27:41.134]  This is something that we knew was coming.
[00:27:41.194 --> 00:27:54.318]  I reported on this and actually I put a poll up on my Twitter account back on January the 20th saying laws have been introduced in multiple states to fine protesters blocking the roads or to remove penalties for accidental hitting of protesters when they block the road.
[00:27:54.338 --> 00:27:55.378]  Do you agree?
[00:27:56.198 --> 00:28:00.420]  And 87% of the people said yes, they do agree, essentially.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.401]  And now we have seen an actual case of that, not a theoretical situation.
[00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:11.703]  We've now seen an actual case where anti-Trump protesters blocking the road blocked an ambulance that was trying to get somebody to the hospital.
[00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:14.264]  See, that is not a protest.
[00:28:14.384 --> 00:28:15.685]  It is not a demonstration.
[00:28:16.525 --> 00:28:22.192]  That is a violence, a riot, it is an infliction on other people's rights, and it is not free speech.
[00:28:22.252 --> 00:28:24.155]  We need to distinguish between those two things.
[00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:27.900]  John Bowne takes a closer look at the judge that issued this national ban.
[00:28:29.463 --> 00:28:43.134]  Seattle Washington federal judge James Robart based his judgment of the Trump administration's decision to follow through with a travel ban of seven Muslim countries as not rationally based.
[00:28:43.474 --> 00:28:49.239]  However, this purported logical judge was quoted by CNBC as stating,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.621]  We're good to go.
[00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:20.999]  Held in New York October 1st to October 2nd, 2015, a portion of the Soros-funded agenda read, Recognizing the need for strategic assistance, the U.S.
[00:29:21.139 --> 00:29:34.063]  Programs Board approved $650,000 in Opportunities Fund support to invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:29:34.243 --> 00:29:34.843]  Furthermore,
[00:29:35.163 --> 00:29:47.869]  Soros' shaping of Black Lives Matter was used to alter the 2016 elections, oddly never mentioned by the Democrats, and their zeal to vaguely and solely blame the Russians.
[00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:58.114]  As a hacked Open Society document stated, leaders of Black Lives Matter and the movement for Black Lives work to influence candidate platforms during the 2016 primary season.
[00:29:59.315 --> 00:30:12.004]  This came alongside the recent acknowledgement by political strategists that African American voters may be much more pivotal to the 2016 general election than previously forecasted.
[00:30:12.244 --> 00:30:25.594]  President Trump responded to Judge Robart in a tweet stating, What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into the U.S.? ?
[00:30:25.874 --> 00:30:28.375]  I don't work over in the United States.
[00:30:28.415 --> 00:30:29.135]  I work overseas.
[00:30:29.755 --> 00:30:35.497]  And I'm currently in Iraq, which is one of the countries that were on the list.
[00:30:36.517 --> 00:30:38.778]  And there's been a lot of discussion about the ejected voter.
[00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:42.119]  Obviously, in the United States, there's a lot going on.
[00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:44.339]  And over here, there's a lot going on as well.
[00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:46.400]  Just a lot of things you all don't see.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:54.322]  My simple question was, as an American, if I went out in town right now, would I be welcome?
[00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:57.807]  And, uh, they instantly said, absolutely not.
[00:30:57.827 --> 00:30:58.527]  You would not be welcome.
[00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:03.112]  And I said, okay, so what would happen if I went out of town?
[00:31:03.993 --> 00:31:08.357]  And they said the locals would.
[00:31:09.548 --> 00:31:13.913]  Snatch me up and kill me within an hour.
[00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:19.280]  I'd be tortured first and after they were done torturing me, I'd probably be beheaded.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:25.467]  It would, you know, go on video for everybody to see as, you know, an example.
[00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:31.227]  I already knew this was gonna happen, but I wanted to hear it from them.
[00:31:31.267 --> 00:31:32.087]  I wanted to hear it from them.
[00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:38.591]  And, you know, the point of it is, the point I'm trying to make is, you know, this is the local populace that would do this.
[00:31:39.012 --> 00:31:46.676]  This isn't ISIS, this isn't Al-Qaeda, this isn't the PMU, this isn't a militia from the Iranians or anything like that.
[00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:49.078]  This is the local populace that would do this.
[00:31:49.698 --> 00:31:52.520]  My question to them was pretty simple then, after that.
[00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:58.164]  If you would do this to me in your country, why would I let you in my country?
[00:31:59.687 --> 00:32:06.450]  Because all this means to me is that if you have the opportunity to take the life of an American, you would do it.
[00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:15.234]  The DHS has now stopped flagging travelers, and direct flights have resumed from the previously banned countries to the United States.
[00:32:15.594 --> 00:32:24.358]  After the DOJ quickly appealed Judge Roberts' decision, a federal Ninth Circuit appeals court declined to reinstate the travel ban.
[00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:39.290]  We are now playing Russian roulette with our national security, set into motion by a federal judge basing his decision on a political opinion rooted in the subversion of the George Soros' Open Society initiatives.
[00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:48.658]  Judge Robart's name won't fade into mainstream media history, because when the next inevitable terror attack occurs on U.S.
[00:32:48.718 --> 00:32:49.058]  soil,
[00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:54.642]  We'll know exactly who to hold accountable for this dangerous subversion of U.S.
[00:32:54.942 --> 00:32:56.143]  national security.
[00:32:56.383 --> 00:32:58.405]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:06.511 --> 00:33:16.058]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:12.726]  World leaders were duped into investing billions of our taxpayer dollars, mind you, into this climate change agenda based on manipulated global warming data.
[00:37:13.086 --> 00:37:15.087]  Now, this is a story coming out of the Daily Mail.
[00:37:15.127 --> 00:37:18.450]  They're speaking directly with a whistleblower who has direct knowledge of this.
[00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:24.194]  He says there is astonishing evidence that NOAA, which is the organization that is the world's leading source of climate data,
[00:37:24.674 --> 00:37:25.075]  I think so.
[00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:53.489]  John J. Bates, he said that America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration breached its own rules on scientific integrity by rushing to push this report through.
[00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.997]  And this report claimed that this pause or the slowdown in global warming is actually a myth.
[00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:04.078]  And that world temperatures had been rising faster than science could explain.
[00:38:04.418 --> 00:38:07.319]  So again, this is flawed and unsubstantiated data.
[00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:20.703]  It was seized upon by world leaders who then took to the streets, blasting it all over media to claim that 97% of scientists say climate change is urgent and it's man-made and it must be addressed.
[00:38:20.743 --> 00:38:22.604]  And so immediately with this Paris Accord,
[00:38:23.044 --> 00:38:33.227]  They dedicated a hundred billion in taxpayer dollars every single year to be given an extra climate related aid to the developing world by rich nations.
[00:38:33.707 --> 00:38:41.389]  And they also called for a binding legal mechanism to ensure that the world got no more than two degrees Celsius warmer
[00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:42.129]  Thank you for
[00:39:00.763 --> 00:39:05.586]  In setting new supposedly binding standards to produce and preserve climate data records.
[00:39:05.626 --> 00:39:13.432]  So when he's saying that they are misleading and using unverified data here, why he's such a high-level whistleblower, we need to pay attention to this.
[00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:20.957]  So this paper is being kind of referred to as the Paws Buster paper and it was based on two new temperature sets of data.
[00:39:21.397 --> 00:39:26.881]  One containing measurements of temperatures of the sea and the other the planet's surface on land.
[00:39:27.321 --> 00:39:28.742]  Both data sets were flawed.
[00:39:29.082 --> 00:39:32.666]  They haven't even come through with an official revised version yet, okay?
[00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:33.547]  Now it's almost 2017.
[00:39:34.548 --> 00:39:39.453]  So typically with the SEAD dataset, they're going to be using readings from fixed and floating buoys.
[00:39:39.674 --> 00:39:46.141]  These are generally reliable, but what they did this time, there was an upwards adjustment of these readings to bring them in line
[00:39:46.701 --> 00:39:50.302]  With readings from water being taken in by ships.
[00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:52.423]  So this is a totally doubtful source.
[00:39:52.503 --> 00:39:55.804]  Obviously, if you think about it, ships themselves are sources of heat.
[00:39:56.384 --> 00:39:58.305]  Readings will vary from ship to ship.
[00:39:58.725 --> 00:40:02.967]  And the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden.
[00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:09.369]  Which means, obviously, if the ship is in deeper water, it's going to be a colder reading versus warmer reading, etc.
[00:40:10.229 --> 00:40:16.656]  So they had this good data from buoys according to Dr. Bates, but they threw that out and corrected it by using the bad data from ships.
[00:40:17.076 --> 00:40:21.501]  In addition, they were also using a new experimental program.
[00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:25.485]  They were combining separate sets of records, so it was kind of too new.
[00:40:25.905 --> 00:40:27.347]  They weren't able to give this the
[00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:28.367]  We're good to go!
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:41:05.871]  And just the clincher here, none of the data on which the paper was based was properly archived, which is a mandatory requirement meant to ensure that the raw data and the software used to process it is accessible to other scientists so they can verify NOAA's results.
[00:41:06.432 --> 00:41:12.877]  And Dr. Bates said the final bombshell is that the computer used to process the software suffered a complete failure.
[00:41:13.317 --> 00:41:21.104]  So the reason for the failure is unknown, but this means that this pause buster paper can never be replicated or verified by other scientists.
[00:41:21.164 --> 00:41:29.931]  And this is key, because this was a paper that was used by President Barack Obama, David Cameron, and other world leaders to push this climate change agenda.
[00:41:30.372 --> 00:41:36.437]  They locked us into this agreement, billions of taxpayer dollars, even after they're out of office.
[00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:38.759]  This will ensure that this agenda moves forward.
[00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:42.781]  We'll just have to wait and see if President Donald Trump is able to turn this around.
[00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.443]  Of course, he campaigned on reversing this climate change agenda.
[00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:08.527]  9 years, have been giving themselves 0% interest, not to mention bank or bailouts that are just trillions of dollars to themselves, that taxpayers have to back up.
[00:42:08.627 --> 00:42:16.592]  So they plunge the economy, then we have to back up their bad debts, and then they turn around and take the money we've loaned them, and loan it back to us at incredible interest.
[00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:26.999]  And so the first thing Trump did when he got in, just 16 days ago, he's only had like 10 working days, but he's been working all 16, the first thing he did,
[00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.493]  was to come in and say, let's start moving with banking regulations.
[00:42:31.533 --> 00:42:33.435]  Let me get my treasury secretary in there.
[00:42:34.496 --> 00:42:39.060]  They have totally blocked all the money being given to small businesses and individuals.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.324]  Lending has just been shut off ever since interest went to zero, because why should the banks do that?
[00:42:44.364 --> 00:42:45.786]  They're the first handlers of the money.
[00:42:46.466 --> 00:42:49.129]  So they get it at zero, but only select mega banks.
[00:42:49.509 --> 00:42:53.292]  Trump said, no, sir, we're going to give zero percent interest.
[00:42:54.193 --> 00:43:00.138]  To the little banks, the local banks, the regional banks, the private banks, the banks that aren't part of the insider groups.
[00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:02.820]  Not just the six big ones.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.641]  Not just a bunch of foreign banks.
[00:43:05.002 --> 00:43:07.444]  We're going to give zero percent.
[00:43:08.244 --> 00:43:15.490]  And Trump's pressuring the Federal Reserve right now, that is a consortium of private banks, but it's an intergovernmental meeting group.
[00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.752]  It's just kind of the council of the private banks.
[00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:20.850]  He's pressuring him to keep it low.
[00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.612]  Not that's even good overall, generally.
[00:43:23.672 --> 00:43:28.315]  We need some interest so people that save and invest make money.
[00:43:28.755 --> 00:43:37.922]  But while America and the world is in this long depression slash recession for the average person, it's time for mainstream to get a bubble.
[00:43:38.717 --> 00:43:52.845]  Because when Main Street gets a bubble, you actually get a bridge built, you actually get a business built, you actually get some jobs, you actually get some money saved, you actually get some cars bought, some restaurants visited, some haircuts paid for, some new clothes, a new coat, some new shoes.
[00:43:54.397 --> 00:44:05.121]  Yes, these are dangerous bubbles, but they already created a mega bubble nobody can get out of unless we get the average person out of the bubble because that's where you are able to rebuild an economy.
[00:44:05.401 --> 00:44:08.042]  But without getting some money to those people, it's not going to happen.
[00:44:08.522 --> 00:44:10.443]  This is 101 economics.
[00:44:10.503 --> 00:44:17.485]  Trump should be a superstar, loved by the general public or the average poor person.
[00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:19.806]  But the average poor person is a Democratic supporter.
[00:44:21.601 --> 00:44:23.303]  Especially on the East and West Coast.
[00:44:23.383 --> 00:44:26.745]  And they just really think all their prosperity comes from the government.
[00:44:27.866 --> 00:44:30.849]  They don't even care that the stock market's up because they don't own stock.
[00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:35.833]  They don't understand that those businesses are hiring a lot of times based off how their stock's doing.
[00:44:35.913 --> 00:44:38.536]  So, there's danger in the Trump euphoria.
[00:44:39.448 --> 00:44:40.629]  There's danger in a bubble.
[00:44:41.209 --> 00:44:44.471]  There's danger in him betting on he can supercharge things, but here's the deal.
[00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:53.315]  The danger of not doing it is a guaranteed ongoing worldwide recession slash depression that's meant to consolidate total control and pick winners and losers.
[00:44:53.936 --> 00:44:57.918]  So, I've been hammering on this for nine years, having economist after economist on.
[00:44:58.198 --> 00:45:01.020]  You've heard Ron Paul, big pessimist to every politician.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.081]  He says, quote, a week ago,
[00:45:04.315 --> 00:45:07.016]  Donald Trump's doing a great job on the economy.
[00:45:07.536 --> 00:45:11.877]  I think it's too little too late, but he's doing a fantastic job.
[00:45:11.897 --> 00:45:17.758]  Paul is one of the least complimenting people out there, okay?
[00:45:18.979 --> 00:45:27.601]  He's very, very, not mechanical, but he's just very, very dedicated to just being very, very machine-like.
[00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:29.541]  There's the headline exclusive.
[00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:31.782]  Ron Paul says Trump is trying to stop global collapse.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.261]  Folks, it's because he is!
[00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:34.721]  Listen!
[00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:39.563]  And I've seen this played out, this globalist program, over and over again in other countries.
[00:45:39.623 --> 00:45:41.945]  They have an admitted blueprint.
[00:45:42.185 --> 00:45:50.209]  In 2002, Joseph Stiklitz, who'd won the Nobel Prize twice, once for economics, left the World Bank as our chief economist.
[00:45:50.229 --> 00:45:55.112]  And he said, I will not be part of the criminal activity taking place and trying to make the public poor.
[00:45:55.372 --> 00:45:57.633]  And it was the plan of the IMF and World Bank.
[00:45:58.593 --> 00:46:01.235]  Again, international meetinghouses of megabanks.
[00:46:02.162 --> 00:46:03.903]  They're just the front groups, governmental name.
[00:46:04.483 --> 00:46:17.910]  It's the International Federal Reserve basically, deciding to implode now the first world and make us debt slaves, kill the engines of production, the engines of liberty, the engines of upper mobility, and have a giant consolidation for political control.
[00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:25.535]  I mean, we don't want just a bunch of billionaires and trillionaire globalists that then rule on, like, mountaintops that are all high-tech and have electricity.
[00:46:25.896 --> 00:46:32.721]  We're down here like it's Ceaușescu's Romania or Venezuela and don't have electricity most of the time and have kids starving on the streets.
[00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:35.583]  But that's the management tool of the globalists.
[00:46:35.943 --> 00:46:37.204]  That's what we're headed into.
[00:46:38.665 --> 00:46:42.548]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C.
[00:46:42.828 --> 00:46:45.851]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.864]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.847]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:46:57.067 --> 00:46:59.669]  We will be protected by God.
[00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:02.152]  From the front lines of the info war.
[00:47:02.972 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.848]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.495]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.156]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:59.062]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.082 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:21.548]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the Never Trumpers, particularly on the Democrat side, have said that they will do anything to try to stop Trump's agenda, but now they are supporting breaking the law.
[00:49:21.988 --> 00:49:23.610]  I'm joined in studio by Maggie Hall.
[00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:25.332]  You've got a pretty unbelievable story today.
[00:49:25.492 --> 00:49:29.555]  Alright, so what we've got here, this California State Senator, his name is Kevin DeLeon.
[00:49:29.996 --> 00:49:42.105]  He openly admits on the Senate floor, he's trying to get this bill passed that makes the entire state of California a sanctuary state, and really challenges and bucks up against the federal law, the President's deportation order that's currently underway.
[00:49:42.185 --> 00:49:47.249]  And this one lawbreaker, he doesn't just say we should be a sanctuary city, he gives the reasons why.
[00:49:47.669 --> 00:49:48.550]  You're not going to believe this.
[00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.194]  He says half my family are in the U.S.
[00:49:51.334 --> 00:49:53.557]  illegally and in possession of false documents.
[00:49:53.917 --> 00:49:56.561]  And by false documents, because we all know you need those to work.
[00:49:56.661 --> 00:50:02.088]  So false security cards, false green cards, false everything, basically.
[00:50:02.428 --> 00:50:03.710]  He's trying to pass this AB60 law.
[00:50:04.591 --> 00:50:12.195]  And he's like, look folks, if we don't pass this law, the people that are holding these false documents, they're going to be deported, like half of my family.
[00:50:12.255 --> 00:50:14.196]  We've really got to get a jump on this stuff.
[00:50:14.476 --> 00:50:18.438]  This is somebody who actually sits in the California State Senate, if you can believe that.
[00:50:18.818 --> 00:50:19.999]  And here's the amazing thing.
[00:50:20.499 --> 00:50:29.203]  If I had the same situation where I had family that was here illegally or even myself, I would be trying to do whatever it takes to become a citizen.
[00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:30.704]  Instead, he's just like, no.
[00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:32.344]  Look, this is the way it is.
[00:50:32.884 --> 00:50:36.805]  It's openly understood that everybody that's here illegally, you gotta have these things to work.
[00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:41.186]  We're not, and then he opens it up with, we're not lawbreakers, we're law-abiding citizens.
[00:50:41.546 --> 00:50:44.627]  Buddy, right out of the gate, you're breaking the law, you're committing felonies.
[00:50:44.907 --> 00:50:45.967]  No, he's not a citizen.
[00:50:46.048 --> 00:50:49.288]  He's not a law-abiding citizen if you're not a citizen.
[00:50:49.348 --> 00:50:51.929]  You have to be a citizen to be a law-abiding citizen.
[00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:52.369]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:56.290]  The state senator is in fact a citizen by birth.
[00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.991]  If I'm not mistaken, I was looking at the Wikipedia page about him right before coming on air.
[00:51:00.271 --> 00:51:01.032]  He is a citizen.
[00:51:01.332 --> 00:51:05.833]  Half of his family are not citizens and they are illegally residing with fake documents.
[00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:11.635]  And he is so brazen and so arrogant, he has no problem saying that on the California State Senate floor.
[00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:15.316]  Like, you know, like it's no big deal because, you know, we all, we all have an understanding.
[00:51:15.396 --> 00:51:15.876]  I think so.
[00:51:37.173 --> 00:51:40.974]  You know, it's just amazing because I want to cover this propaganda in Yahoo.
[00:51:41.134 --> 00:51:42.374]  Now, this is a story.
[00:51:42.434 --> 00:51:45.435]  Worried about Trump, asylum seekers walk cold road to Canada.
[00:51:45.835 --> 00:51:46.935]  This is how the propaganda works.
[00:51:46.955 --> 00:51:47.996]  Look at this first paragraph.
[00:51:48.516 --> 00:51:56.478]  Refugees in the United States fearing a worsening climate of xenophobia in the wake of a divisive U.S.
[00:51:56.538 --> 00:51:59.979]  presidential campaign are flocking to Canada.
[00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:00.999]  So here's what they're doing.
[00:52:01.539 --> 00:52:05.181]  So first they insert xenophobia, a total false narrative.
[00:52:05.321 --> 00:52:06.942]  I'll explain that in a second.
[00:52:07.402 --> 00:52:13.346]  Then they say the president is the one being divisive when it's this story that is dividing.
[00:52:13.706 --> 00:52:15.547]  And then they say flocking to Canada.
[00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:20.410]  Again, we'll get into how this is just total or false narrative here, Maggie.
[00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.791]  People are nuts.
[00:52:24.372 --> 00:52:25.933]  It's a mental disorder at this point.
[00:52:25.953 --> 00:52:26.233]  It is.
[00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:28.814]  We're looking at these articles that are clearly propped up.
[00:52:28.834 --> 00:52:29.935]  I mean, look at Nancy Pelosi.
[00:52:30.635 --> 00:52:31.855]  Case in point, exactly.
[00:52:31.916 --> 00:52:34.557]  Also from California, except a national lawmaker.
[00:52:34.597 --> 00:52:36.878]  For those of you who don't know, she is stark raving lunatic.
[00:52:36.938 --> 00:52:37.758]  She's a lunatic.
[00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:46.523]  Right there with Chuck Schumer, because they're the ones playing on these false narratives, these fake stories that Trump is a xenophobe, sexist, hypocrite, you name it.
[00:52:47.043 --> 00:52:50.645]  We go down the list every day, frankly, of what they call him, because we have to dispute it.
[00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:57.490]  Now, he does have the ultimate say, I want to say, on imposing any entry of aliens or restrictions that he sees appropriate.
[00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.612]  We're talking about people that are placed in a travel ban, I know we're getting to that.
[00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:10.859]  But we have people residing in the country, not only illegally, but we have a separate group of refugees that haven't been vetted from countries that we know are hotbeds for terrorism.
[00:53:10.879 --> 00:53:19.406]  So we have two dynamics going on here, and all he's trying to do is restore order, but the people at Yahoo News, among dozens of other fake news sites,
[00:53:20.086 --> 00:53:20.886]  Just don't see it that way.
[00:53:38.152 --> 00:53:43.257]  91 people went to Manitoba's Welcome Place for refugees between November and January.
[00:53:43.317 --> 00:53:43.878]  A whopping 91!
[00:53:44.038 --> 00:53:46.841]  In Quebec, 1,200 refugee claimants came in between April 2016, January 2017.
[00:53:46.901 --> 00:53:48.984]  British Columbia and Yukon, 652 people.
[00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:58.132]  Okay, so you know, that's their flocking numbers.
[00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.473]  They're going to say flocking.
[00:53:59.573 --> 00:54:09.098]  Prime Minister Trudeau took office in 2015 in a commitment to admit tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, but this year Canada plans to only take 7,500 government-assisted refugees.
[00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:09.878]  So wait a second.
[00:54:10.359 --> 00:54:12.320]  We're the xenophobic ones in America.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.380]  They're scaling back though.
[00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:13.641]  U.S.
[00:54:13.721 --> 00:54:15.902]  to boost number of refugees who will admit in 2017 to 110,000!
[00:54:19.784 --> 00:54:23.545]  A 30% increase from last year, 57% from 2015.
[00:54:24.066 --> 00:54:26.647]  Canada's taking $7,500 and we're xenophobic.
[00:54:27.567 --> 00:54:28.647]  I mean, that is absurd.
[00:54:28.948 --> 00:54:32.709]  They're mad that our president, that there's a sovereignty over.
[00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:34.450]  We have to vet people, folks.
[00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:35.790]  You can't have this floodgate.
[00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:36.610]  And everybody knows this.
[00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.351]  We have the most brilliant audience out there.
[00:54:38.391 --> 00:54:39.351]  They understand these issues.
[00:54:39.812 --> 00:54:43.113]  You know, I actually hadn't seen that story prior to you putting it in today.
[00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:46.254]  We're talking about a nation that is supposedly exterior.
[00:54:46.274 --> 00:54:47.034]  They're very liberal.
[00:54:47.474 --> 00:54:48.315]  They understand it.
[00:54:48.335 --> 00:54:49.135]  They're scaling back.
[00:54:49.615 --> 00:54:52.636]  Paul Joseph Watson, we've covered ad nauseum this week with him.
[00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:57.118]  The past two days he's done these reports over how Germany and the UK, it's done, it's over.
[00:54:57.178 --> 00:54:57.898]  We don't want that.
[00:54:57.958 --> 00:54:59.458]  We like law and order.
[00:54:59.498 --> 00:55:02.419]  We want people to have the proper vetting.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.061]  But I guarantee you somebody online is going to call us racist and xenophobe.
[00:55:07.409 --> 00:55:13.371]  And actually, I think most of the Americans are actually coming from Asian regions, if the numbers that I'm thinking are correct.
[00:55:13.431 --> 00:55:16.012]  But just before we get to the Clintons, because I know you want to cover that.
[00:55:16.072 --> 00:55:16.472]  Oh man.
[00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:23.914]  All the people complaining about the travel ban and how it's impacted people, you know, little people are getting impacted here and there.
[00:55:23.974 --> 00:55:24.534]  It does happen.
[00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:25.314]  These are real stories.
[00:55:25.354 --> 00:55:26.695]  I'm not saying it didn't happen.
[00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:27.255]  But think about this.
[00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:37.602]  Over the course of the 15 years since 9-11, United States air passengers have had to sacrifice billions of hours.
[00:55:37.882 --> 00:55:38.703]  This is a real number.
[00:55:39.163 --> 00:55:40.064]  Billions of hours.
[00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:46.649]  So compare that to the impact from Trump's travel ban to the impact of the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:50.654]  The stress, you're molested in some cases.
[00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:52.336]  I mean, God forbid.
[00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:55.981]  And then I have to get blasted with radiation too, just to get on a flight.
[00:55:56.602 --> 00:55:58.644]  You've got cancer risks now at this point.
[00:55:58.664 --> 00:56:02.549]  Seriously, so don't sit here and complain about the travel ban until you complain about that nonsense.
[00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:03.731]  Alright, what do you got on the Clintons now?
[00:56:03.851 --> 00:56:20.648]  Alright, so I picked this up and honestly, we know that the Clinton Foundation, they've helped a lot of corrupt people around the globe that have given them money, namely in countries that frankly should be on a list somewhere because they typically have terrorist eyes to them.
[00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:25.673]  And the Clintons, while spouting their ridiculous humanitarian relief number
[00:56:26.334 --> 00:56:31.538]  They take money, we know this, from countries that are very anti-humanitarian in their beliefs.
[00:56:31.618 --> 00:56:35.940]  Now, Judicial Watch, they put this Huma Abedin story together.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:47.568]  One of the Clinton's most controversial donors, they were, it's a pay-to-play story, trying to secure a dinner with President Obama for giving the Clintons several million dollars.
[00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:49.209]  It implicates Chelsea Clinton in this.
[00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:53.072]  This came out the Free Beacon and I wanted to bring this up because it is a national security issue.
[00:56:53.432 --> 00:56:54.253]  We're talking about
[00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:57.516]  Someone who nearly became President of the United States.
[00:56:57.777 --> 00:56:58.858]  This is what we could be dealing with.
[00:56:58.938 --> 00:57:02.302]  Instead, we're talking about law and order and the restoration of justice.
[00:57:03.123 --> 00:57:05.485]  And speaking of whom, Abedin, I know Alex covered this today on the show.
[00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:15.357]  I don't have an article about it, but it looks like Wiener might be facing porn charges, child porn charges, after all, because, you know, he's a pornographer, folks!
[00:57:15.697 --> 00:57:16.437]  So how do you like that?
[00:57:16.537 --> 00:57:18.418]  Trump is the bad guy, okay?
[00:57:18.658 --> 00:57:25.219]  And then you've got Hillary Clinton, who's married to a rapist, and Huba Abedin, who's married to... A child pedo.
[00:57:25.639 --> 00:57:26.680]  Potentially a pedophile.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.000]  Right.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.080]  Or a pornographer.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.220]  Or a child pornographer.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.841]  Again, we don't know what... We'll see.
[00:57:30.901 --> 00:57:35.722]  Well, this is what... When you solicit a child for naked photographs of her, that's called child porn.
[00:57:36.262 --> 00:57:36.842]  That's what that is.
[00:57:37.222 --> 00:57:37.862]  So that's nice.
[00:57:37.882 --> 00:57:42.224]  There was your Democratic Party in the campaign cycle, but you're complaining about Donald Trump.
[00:57:42.484 --> 00:57:45.545]  And of course, you had all these women marching against Donald Trump.
[00:57:45.605 --> 00:57:48.827]  I never saw any women marching after Bill Clinton did any of his sex acts.
[00:57:49.127 --> 00:57:49.767]  But here's the thing.
[00:57:50.047 --> 00:57:52.528]  The Women's March is taking it one further now, Margaret.
[00:57:52.588 --> 00:57:55.849]  I don't know if you've heard about this, but they're going to go on strike.
[00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:01.672]  The group behind the Women's March in Washington is going to go on a general strike.
[00:58:02.092 --> 00:58:05.133]  The date and other details about the strike are not immediately clear.
[00:58:05.393 --> 00:58:06.214]  Oh, shocking!
[00:58:06.334 --> 00:58:07.816]  Oh my God!
[00:58:07.876 --> 00:58:09.659]  You don't have solidarity with your march?
[00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:10.180]  Wow!
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.582]  We were out there at the Women's March.
[00:58:11.742 --> 00:58:13.024]  Nobody knew what was going on.
[00:58:13.404 --> 00:58:16.308]  The details about the strike have never been clear.
[00:58:16.468 --> 00:58:17.249]  But I will say this.
[00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:19.753]  Radical Islam aligns with feminism.
[00:58:19.813 --> 00:58:21.115]  You saw the craziest signs.
[00:58:21.135 --> 00:58:22.036]  Anyway, continue please.
[00:58:22.056 --> 00:58:23.297]  Well, I'm saying this.
[00:58:23.497 --> 00:58:24.639]  I'm actually behind this strike.
[00:58:24.819 --> 00:58:25.179]  Alright.
[00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:29.884]  And I would like to see that the women that protested Donald Trump go on a strike from procreating.
[00:58:30.264 --> 00:58:32.647]  I think that that will solve a lot of the world's issues.
[00:58:33.007 --> 00:58:34.048]  So go on your strike.
[00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:35.430]  No longer procreate.
[00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:38.132]  And I think a lot of these issues will actually be solved.
[00:58:38.393 --> 00:58:41.476]  You know, I believe we might be talking about a group of women that do not procreate.
[00:58:42.169 --> 00:58:43.791]  Or have abortions too.
[00:58:43.851 --> 00:58:47.576]  We know that, you know, that we've seen them say that they kill their kids at some of these protests.
[00:58:47.596 --> 00:58:48.998]  So that's the sad truth of it folks.
[00:58:49.618 --> 00:58:50.700]  Maggie, thank you so much.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.741]  This has been Owen Troyer.
[00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:53.102]  This has been the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:55.826]  Central.

[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
