[00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:16.623]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's April 11th, 2017 on this Tuesday Global Edition.
[00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:21.046]  Trump has ordered the military to prepare plans to strike North Korea.
[00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:22.047]  That's mainstream news.
[00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:24.309]  South Korea is in a full panic.
[00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.190]  The Chinese are sending 150,000 troops to the north.
[00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:32.658]  North Korean ships are headed home from China as China starts sanctions against North Korea.
[00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:34.579]  So Trump did have an effect in that meeting.
[00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.840]  We have the CIA caught staging false flag attacks in the United States.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.700]  That's mainstream news.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.661]  Of course, you heard it here a month ago, but it's now breaking in the Hill.
[00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.341]  And so much more.
[00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.182]  But first, Paul Watson was right about Sweden.
[00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:54.860]  Remember when the media and all those lefty, lovey celebrities laughed at me for warning about mass immigration and Sweden?
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.042]  Yeah, well it's not so funny now, is it?
[00:00:57.162 --> 00:01:04.146]  Four people were killed and 15 injured when a rejected asylum seeker drove a truck into a crowd of people in Stockholm.
[00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:11.792]  The culprit, a 39-year-old ISIS supporter, was ordered to be deported four months ago, yet remained in the country.
[00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:17.876]  If not for this hero who forced the terrorists to crash by driving into his path, hundreds more could have been killed.
[00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:27.864]  Acknowledging the total disaster that allowing in hundreds of thousands of refugees has been, Sweden's Prime Minister said, Sweden will never go back to the mass migration we had in autumn 2015.
[00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:28.044]  Never!
[00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:31.607]  Well, it's too friggin' late now, isn't it?
[00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:37.492]  Everyone's virtually forgotten about this already, because terrorism is the new normal in Europe.
[00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.133]  The terrorists have won.
[00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:45.819]  Leftists think that going on with business as usual and allowing in untold millions more migrants is courageous.
[00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:47.080]  It's not courageous.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.161]  It's cowardice.
[00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:50.183]  It's normalising terrorism.
[00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:55.087]  Because they'd rather be dead than, God forbid, be called a racist.
[00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:01.409]  It's strange, isn't it, how people aren't being mowed down by lorries in Japan, in Hungary, in the Czech Republic.
[00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:06.351]  Only in countries that have imported huge numbers of migrants that share certain beliefs.
[00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.292]  Some kind of connection there.
[00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:10.172]  Can't quite put my finger on it.
[00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:10.793]  Sweden.
[00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:15.314]  The most progressive, pro-refugee, pro-Islam country in the entire West.
[00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:18.755]  A country that isn't involved in any Middle Eastern wars.
[00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:22.237]  And it still got attacked by an Islamic terrorist.
[00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:22.897]  Progressives.
[00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.620]  Your submission will not protect you.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.261]  I was right about Sweden.
[00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:28.582]  Trump was right.
[00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:29.123]  Sweden!
[00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:31.565]  They took in large numbers.
[00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:34.388]  They're having problems like they never thought possible.
[00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:42.336]  The migrant residents of Rinkeby pelted police officers with stones while they were trying to arrest one of the terror suspects.
[00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.138]  Oh, but no-go zones don't exist.
[00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:45.499]  They're a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:45.980]  Really?
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.502]  Is that why PostNord just announced that they were going to stop delivering mail in holster just down the road from Rinkeby?
[00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.442]  Because it's, quote, not safe.
[00:02:54.642 --> 00:03:00.604]  Rinkeby, the same suburb journalist Tim Poole was told by police to leave or he'd be attacked.
[00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:04.165]  The same suburb where an Australian film crew was attacked.
[00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:10.827]  And notice how the media treats victims of Islamic terrorism compared to how they treat victims in other situations.
[00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:15.429]  How many times did they show you the picture of the dead boy on the Turkish beach?
[00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.231]  How about the child victims of the chemical weapons attack in Syria?
[00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:20.591]  Lots of times, right?
[00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.673]  Okay, how about the dismembered child victim of the Stockholm attack?
[00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:26.634]  No, they didn't show you that, did they?
[00:03:26.694 --> 00:03:30.276]  Did they show you the bodies of the ten dead children after the Nice attack?
[00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:30.776]  No!
[00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:34.618]  Did they show you the dead children after the attack on Christians in Egypt?
[00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:35.238]  No.
[00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:41.944]  Isn't it an amazing coincidence how we only see the bodies of dead kids when there's an agenda to be sold?
[00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:49.411]  CNN's really keen on giving a platform to a seven-year-old girl who's being used as a mouthpiece to sell the invasion of Syria.
[00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:51.873]  Banna, do you blame President Assad for this?
[00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:54.355]  Yes.
[00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:58.039]  What is your message to President Assad?
[00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.912]  I am very sad.
[00:04:02.072 --> 00:04:05.016]  Jake Tapper wants you to follow her on Twitter.
[00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:10.803]  Are they going to give a voice to the children of parents massacred by Islamic terrorists on the streets of Europe?
[00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.104]  Yeah, don't hold your breath.
[00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:16.930]  Sweden's new feminist leader wants to ban deportations altogether.
[00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.411]  Even of rapists.
[00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.673]  Because Sweden is a racist society.
[00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:27.339]  Yeah, so racist that she, a black woman from Uganda, was just elected to lead a major political party.
[00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:32.343]  But don't worry, because left-wing newspaper Aftonbladet has a solution.
[00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:35.386]  Stop importing hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants?
[00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:35.926]  No.
[00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.509]  Ban cars from big cities.
[00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:44.695]  And the mayor of Stockholm says Sweden will defeat terrorists by thinking of kindness and openness.
[00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:51.021]  Oh, you mean like the openness that allowed 150 ISIS terrorists to cross back into Sweden?
[00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:55.305]  Yeah.
[00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:56.766]  Good luck with that.
[00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:01.911]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, for an incredibly important run.
[00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:10.232]  The North Korean dictator, Fling Flang Flume, I mean Kim Jong Un, warns of a nuclear strike it provoked as U.S.
[00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:13.235]  warships are now approaching the Korean Peninsula.
[00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:15.016]  So tensions are heating up right now.
[00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:20.221]  Little Man's gonna decide to come out and pop off a few if he thinks that we're gonna come up there and do something.
[00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:21.962]  I actually think it's kind of funny.
[00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:27.947]  I don't think that North Korea has any possible chance whatsoever just to even get outside of their country.
[00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:33.011]  I think China might have to worry, or maybe South Korea, but I really don't think anything's gonna get that far out of there.
[00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:38.635]  So I think we're doing okay, but either way, tensions are high and they're warning of a nuclear strike if U.S.
[00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.757]  aggression continues with the Navy moving towards them.
[00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:42.117]  U.S.
[00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:51.103]  President Donald Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its impoverished neighbor, said in a tweet, North Korea was looking for trouble and that we would come and solve that problem.
[00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:58.448]  Tensions have escalated sharply on the Korean Peninsula with talk of military action by the United States gaining traction following the strike last week.
[00:05:58.648 --> 00:06:01.730]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.771]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:05.792]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:13.096]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:17.678]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.871]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:22.092]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:25.354]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:26.655]  Or more.
[00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:28.456]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:31.178]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.120]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.021]  It's actually scary.
[00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:46.908]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:06:47.932 --> 00:07:00.764]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:07:13.337 --> 00:07:21.245]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:24.408]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:27.080]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:55.950]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Info War change the country and the world.
[00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.110]  It's a win-win.
[00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.611]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:17.898]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.441]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:28.363]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:40.045]  A passenger getting beaten up for not getting off the plane on United Airlines is the top story right now in the United States.
[00:08:40.785 --> 00:08:41.605]  And their stocks are down.
[00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:43.005]  You know what?
[00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:43.825]  I'm not going to cover it.
[00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.406]  It's their private property.
[00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:47.446]  He didn't get off the plane.
[00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:49.543]  I think it was handled wrong.
[00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.506]  He wouldn't get off.
[00:08:51.526 --> 00:08:52.327]  The cop tasered him.
[00:08:52.567 --> 00:09:00.616]  That was excessive, probably, but it's not as important, ladies and gentlemen, as Trump orders military to prepare plans to hit North Korea.
[00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:02.018]  That's mainstream news.
[00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.103]  Government tries to calm South Koreans' fear of imminent war.
[00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:12.280]  Reuters, North Korea ships head home after China orders coal returned.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.541]  That's showing that they're punishing North Korea as Trump demanded.
[00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:19.502]  That is a very good sign that the Chinese and North are about to back down.
[00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:20.642]  Thank God.
[00:09:21.322 --> 00:09:26.004]  South Korea paper reports China has deployed 150,000 troops to North Korea border.
[00:09:26.444 --> 00:09:27.684]  Still, tensions are very high, folks.
[00:09:27.704 --> 00:09:30.065]  This is one of the most dangerous times in world history.
[00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:35.486]  Unusual Navy patrol sparks fear of foreign sub off California coast.
[00:09:35.906 --> 00:09:38.107]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com, a Kit Daniels story.
[00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.872]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:09:42.032 --> 00:09:45.474]  Then, something ultra-huge.
[00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:50.938]  North Korea has come out and threatened back and saying, we will nuke your aircraft carriers.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.002]  And Trump's saying back, we'll nuke you as well.
[00:09:56.983 --> 00:09:59.745]  So, this is really deteriorating quickly.
[00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:02.066]  The stories are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.269]  They're also on DrugsReport.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:11.259]  North Korea's state media warns of nuclear strike if provoked as U.S.
[00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:12.499]  warships approach.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.800]  Again, that is Reuters on Yahoo News.
[00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:20.782]  Expert, this is InfoWars.com, U.S.
[00:10:20.822 --> 00:10:24.543]  could be planning strike on North Korea nuclear reactor.
[00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:27.263]  Worst case scenario, nuclear war.
[00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:32.425]  That is today, April 11th, by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:42.538]  And it's normal, it's some crazy government god who's a total little weakling with a bunch of slaves under him.
[00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:48.580]  And as usual, our government under Clinton gave him the reactors, gave him the materials, gave him everything.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.621]  ABB was allowed to do it.
[00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:53.381]  U.S.
[00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:55.942]  could be planning strike on North Korean nuclear reactor.
[00:10:56.482 --> 00:10:58.143]  Worst case scenario, nuclear war.
[00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:02.704]  That's all coming up today.
[00:11:03.144 --> 00:11:04.845]  And I'm gonna go over the clips in details.
[00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:10.592]  But that ties into a new story from Steve Watson.
[00:11:10.813 --> 00:11:12.934]  Now you'd think this would be on mainstream news.
[00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:13.574]  I haven't seen it.
[00:11:14.614 --> 00:11:22.598]  Vladimir Putin on national Russian TV said Syrian chemical attack was a false flag, a staged event, and that more are coming.
[00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:27.581]  They plan to plant chemicals in Damascus and accuse the Syrian government of an attack.
[00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:34.638]  Pentagon cast doubt on AP report claiming Russia knew about Syrian chemical attack.
[00:11:34.678 --> 00:11:37.259]  That's good news, the Pentagon didn't push in war with Russia just yet.
[00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:40.200]  Tellerson, Russia must choose between Assad and the U.S.
[00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.722]  Well, why did our government start trying to topple Assad?
[00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:51.065]  And then every time Russia goes along with an attack on Iraq or an attack on Libya, the U.S.
[00:11:51.165 --> 00:11:54.107]  only starts more wars with Russia and then overthrows Ukraine.
[00:11:54.387 --> 00:11:58.509]  So Russia gets the fact that they've already tried appeasing the last
[00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.871]  15 years and it's not working.
[00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:12.380]  Now, let's get into the real meat and potatoes because I'm going to go back into this in just a moment and the false flag situation and the proof.
[00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:15.723]  But first off, look at this.
[00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:25.932]  The Hill is reporting on something we told you the day Vault 7 came out months ago.
[00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:33.019]  But now it's in mainstream news, the very same Hill newspaper that criticizes yours truly, constantly.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.383]  Security firm links CIA to series of past attacks.
[00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:42.146]  You read the article, it's what's already in the leaks, the two different Vault 7 dumps.
[00:12:42.647 --> 00:12:54.736]  The CIA has a bunch of tools and they engage in operations to frame Russia, hacking into computers and launching attacks on Congress, on the CIA, on the NSA, on the Cyber Command.
[00:12:55.939 --> 00:13:11.770]  So they can go back to Congress and get more money so that when the generals retire, they can get $10 million a year paychecks from the big telecoms that are putting in the hundreds of billions of dollars per every few years of equipment to spy on the American people.
[00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:17.934]  So here it is, April 11th, being reported by The Hill.
[00:13:19.983 --> 00:13:24.906]  Here it is being reported back in March 31st by the Daily Mail.
[00:13:25.506 --> 00:13:32.609]  Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA used computer code to hide the origins of its hacking attacks and disguised them as Russian or Chinese.
[00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:32.950]  Ooh!
[00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.691]  I wonder where they got that in here.
[00:13:38.132 --> 00:13:38.232]  Oh!
[00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:47.017]  Was it Zero Heads, WikiLeaks Reveals Marble, Proof CIA Disguised Their Hack Attacks Russia, Chinese or Arabic?
[00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:47.257]  No!
[00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:52.020]  Is it the March 31st RT?
[00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:52.562]  No.
[00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:55.251]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:13:57.734 --> 00:14:01.878]  It's March 7th, InfoWars.com, and we had articles before this.
[00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:05.701]  Vault 7 CIA can stage fake Russian hacking to undermine Trump.
[00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:09.304]  CIA kept Russian cyber attack techniques handy for false flags.
[00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.046]  InfoWars.com.
[00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:14.608]  They did a 30 second search and found that one.
[00:14:14.668 --> 00:14:16.410]  I know we reported it before March 7th.
[00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.873]  But there's InfoWars.com first, yet again.
[00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:21.975]  Why we're first among being attacked?
[00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:38.782]  Why we're first being demonized, why Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them admit they're strangling us, shutting off our advertising, not letting us advertise on Google, blocking us, our revenues down 75% on Google Ads, on YouTube, even though our traffic's way up.
[00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:44.026]  WikiLeaks comes out, we read it, we tell you, we break it down first.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.444]  Other March 7th article, WikiLeaks, Vault 7 release confirms InfoWars decades of research.
[00:14:50.784 --> 00:14:53.947]  Then we have articles going back over 15 years giving you the specifics.
[00:14:54.107 --> 00:15:06.578]  Oh, by the way, Wired came out today and said that your thumbprint is not a good passcode for your iPhone and that it could easily be hacked and that it is even worse than a signature or a personal ID code.
[00:15:07.078 --> 00:15:08.379]  Told you that 20 plus years ago.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.720]  Not bragging.
[00:15:10.021 --> 00:15:13.924]  You should understand, we're under attack as fake news because we're the opposite.
[00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:18.166]  We told you Trump was gonna win.
[00:15:18.607 --> 00:15:19.707]  We told you there was fake polls.
[00:15:19.927 --> 00:15:21.368]  We told you the WMDs were fake.
[00:15:24.088 --> 00:15:39.894]  Oh, the New York Times is telling you that fingerprints aren't safe to get into your phones and they're very easy to hack and that if there's a digital signature that they can steal and they told you last year cover up your camera on your computer because it can watch and listen to you and that they are doing it.
[00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:47.027]  Oh, I told you that in Libya, now that Al-Qaeda took over, they're selling people as sex slaves.
[00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:48.090]  Oh my gosh!
[00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:50.677]  Get to the International Business Times today!
[00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:54.331]  Oh my gosh, April, let's give them a Pulitzer Prize!
[00:15:55.192 --> 00:15:58.294]  Migrants are being sold at open slave markets in Libya.
[00:15:58.514 --> 00:16:08.061]  But a month ago, Stephen Colbert played clips of me, and so did others, where they said, oh, they sell women on top of slave blocks.
[00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:10.383]  And they made jokes about, what's a slave block?
[00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:16.908]  Well, they put you up on a pedestal, somebody gets a look at you, and they have the women take their clothes off so they can see it, then they sell you.
[00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:25.233]  But all these different shows attack and make jokes that I claim Muslims are selling sex slaves.
[00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:26.634]  Oh, but I'm right again!
[00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:31.137]  Everything I'm saying is easily verifiable.
[00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:33.979]  But this is what we're facing.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.163]  And so if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:42.726]  They say Infowars is under criminal investigation by the FBI.
[00:16:43.026 --> 00:16:48.730]  They have Congressional Armed Services Committee hearings with no proof and say that we get our directives from the Russians.
[00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:59.581]  And so we need to be shut down and that they've set up a Ministry of Truth that Obama signed into law December 6th of last year, a month before he left office, a month and a half.
[00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:10.043]  And it says the State Department and CIA will shut down independent media in America that is blocking their operations.
[00:17:11.203 --> 00:17:14.284]  And now they're going to call me a Russian agent again because Vladimir Putin has come out.
[00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:18.340]  And said clearly the chemical attack was a false flag, we never do that.
[00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:20.782]  Just like they did a few years ago, they got caught.
[00:17:21.342 --> 00:17:24.445]  And then we have Ron Paul saying it, and we have the British ambassador saying it.
[00:17:24.505 --> 00:17:25.706]  Are we all Russian agents?
[00:17:25.806 --> 00:17:27.147]  I guess Putin is.
[00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:29.909]  So let's go ahead and play Vladimir Putin.
[00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.391]  Is Daria going to read the subtitles or am I?
[00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:35.633]  Daria, you're there.
[00:17:35.753 --> 00:17:38.275]  Okay, we've got actually an evil Russian working here.
[00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:38.855]  U.S.
[00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:41.417]  Army veteran, the whole nine yards, but she can't be trusted.
[00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:43.238]  But here, she's going to read what Putin had to say.
[00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:43.639]  Here it is.
[00:17:44.369 --> 00:18:05.043]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[00:18:05.723 --> 00:18:11.728]  But we regard that any such incident would be reason enough for a thorough investigation.
[00:18:12.168 --> 00:18:29.082]  We are preparing to make a formal call to the relevant UN agency in The Hague and call on the international community to investigate thoroughly these incidents and, depending on the results of the investigation, to make informed decisions and take meaningful action.
[00:18:29.822 --> 00:18:39.650]  All right, let's go to the former British ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, two days ago, saying that they've now given them plenty of excuses to stage more false flags.
[00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:50.779]  And based on previous experience, including Iraq, we can see that we cannot take at face value what the so-called
[00:18:52.654 --> 00:18:53.655]  When they have an agenda.
[00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:57.078]  But come back to the main point.
[00:18:57.378 --> 00:18:58.579]  It's not going to end here.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.762]  And we are likely, Britain, to be dragged into it.
[00:19:02.423 --> 00:19:10.751]  Because Trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations.
[00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:15.936]  Seeing how successful and how easy it is with a gullible media.
[00:19:16.636 --> 00:19:21.857]  To provoke the West into intemperate reactions.
[00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:30.819]  They will very likely stage an operation similar to what they did and this was documented by the United Nations in August last year.
[00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:39.101]  They mounted a chlorine gas attack on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was a regime operation.
[00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.381]  This, mark my words,
[00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:42.362]  You're hearing it here.
[00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:43.743]  And it will happen.
[00:19:44.443 --> 00:19:52.988]  And we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell us that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily into Syria.
[00:19:53.248 --> 00:19:55.070]  This will be fake flag.
[00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.011]  Fake flag, a new term is coined.
[00:19:57.391 --> 00:20:00.353]  Better than false flags, the public can actually understand what that means.
[00:20:00.553 --> 00:20:03.495]  Meanwhile, I have the report I'm going to play in a few minutes.
[00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:05.216]  CNN attacked myself and others.
[00:20:06.397 --> 00:20:08.777]  For saying that this was a false flag.
[00:20:08.797 --> 00:20:10.818]  And they always say that we have no proof.
[00:20:11.318 --> 00:20:13.198]  They don't actually show us with the proof.
[00:20:13.218 --> 00:20:14.479]  I'm going to play Ron Paul first.
[00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:26.081]  But it just illustrates the fact that the rebels have been caught red-handed once, and at least three other times partially, launching attacks on themselves.
[00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:30.702]  Once it blew up on them as they were preparing to launch it inside a city area.
[00:20:31.202 --> 00:20:32.542]  And they've done this before.
[00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:40.956]  So Putin rightfully is saying they'll probably detonate it in Aleppo or somewhere like Damascus in a suburb and then say it's ours.
[00:20:42.377 --> 00:20:49.404]  When this is Obama and now Trump's red line and the Syrians are winning the war, why in the world would they launch it?
[00:20:50.796 --> 00:20:54.979]  Well, they say they have the track of the planes flying from that base over this village.
[00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:01.843]  The Russians say they bombed al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nusra, and that it was chemicals on the ground that killed them.
[00:21:02.223 --> 00:21:05.085]  The media is also saying that we say no chemical attack happened.
[00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:08.287]  No, I believe 80-something people died from a chemical attack.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:29.015]  But I want to ask again, why were we all shown the images of dead kids when we never see the images of dead kids when it's jihadis running over people in London, or in Luxembourg, or in Stockholm, Sweden, or in Brussels, Belgium, or in Paris, France, or in Nice, or in Berlin, or in Cologne?
[00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:31.457]  You never see that.
[00:21:32.517 --> 00:21:34.019]  But you saw it here, didn't you?
[00:21:35.219 --> 00:21:36.841]  And when our missiles goes astray,
[00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:39.646]  And hit a village and killed four people.
[00:21:40.046 --> 00:21:41.587]  Do we see images of those dead kids?
[00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.112]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:48.934 --> 00:21:51.195]  So Ron Paul came out first, we came out first.
[00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:56.420]  We had an article day one, with our sources in Syria, with the jihadis celebrating.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.563]  Let's show Syrian Girl's article, if we can, that it was a false flag.
[00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:04.387]  We had the first article, and then we showed the jihadis celebrating that they'd done it.
[00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.266]  Because see, they get paid by Saudi Arabia for this.
[00:22:08.546 --> 00:22:12.107]  So they want to show they did it and just hope our media covers it up for them.
[00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.388]  Report Soros-linked group behind chemical attack in Syria.
[00:22:15.428 --> 00:22:16.249]  It is a group he funds.
[00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:18.629]  Chemical attack has all the hallmarks of a false flag.
[00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.210]  The media makes jokes about that.
[00:22:21.831 --> 00:22:26.092]  Ladies and gentlemen, George Soros admittedly funded the Arab Spring.
[00:22:26.132 --> 00:22:31.154]  He admittedly funded the overthrow of Ukraine and their elected government.
[00:22:32.557 --> 00:22:33.678]  He's hardcore.
[00:22:33.758 --> 00:22:35.959]  He's crashed major governments' currencies.
[00:22:36.499 --> 00:22:37.620]  He's a James Bond villain.
[00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:39.381]  In the real world.
[00:22:40.982 --> 00:22:41.923]  But the media makes jokes.
[00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:43.063]  Oh, the little sweet Soros.
[00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:44.504]  He says he would be behind it.
[00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:49.167]  George Soros, at age 15, was rounding up Jews by the thousands.
[00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:52.049]  He's a famous Nazi collaborator.
[00:22:53.029 --> 00:23:00.954]  If you're rounding up people, your own people, by the thousands and marching them off to death after you rob them when you're 15, what do you do when you're 87 or whatever he is?
[00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:03.687]  The media again makes jokes.
[00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.308]  Oh, Alex Jones says it could be a false flag.
[00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.252]  I mean, Soros was demanding February 2nd that Trump overthrow Assad.
[00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:23.817]  The good news is Trump's coming out, as I told you yesterday, and saying, I don't want a no-fly zone, I don't want to widen this, I don't want to topple Assad.
[00:23:24.117 --> 00:23:26.638]  It's his surrogates that are doing it, and they've proven they're out of control.
[00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:28.239]  I don't believe it's a double message.
[00:23:29.113 --> 00:23:30.634]  Like we've been hearing from Pchenik.
[00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:31.975]  I think Pchenik's right on most things.
[00:23:32.476 --> 00:23:42.003]  But Trump's told confidants and others that no, he doesn't want this as he always said, but he wants to say nobody better use chemicals because we don't know who did it either way.
[00:23:42.303 --> 00:23:45.225]  And that's now what the Secretary of Defense has come out and said.
[00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:48.127]  He said, and so has the Secretary of State.
[00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:50.209]  We're doing this to deter chemicals.
[00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:53.371]  They were supposed to give up the chemicals and the chemicals were at that base.
[00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:54.432]  Now is that true?
[00:23:54.552 --> 00:23:55.052]  We don't know 100%.
[00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.373]  I know from inside the White House what Trump believes.
[00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:08.079]  I told you first that he believes he's sending a message on chemical weapons, and now that's what they've said.
[00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:12.083]  They've come out again last night and today and said, do not use chemicals, anybody.
[00:24:12.444 --> 00:24:18.210]  Well, how do you deter then the rebels from staging false flags, fake flags, as the British ambassador called it?
[00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.913]  But notice, MSN won't show you Putin, the British ambassador, or Ron Paul.
[00:24:22.674 --> 00:24:24.834]  I guess Bill O'Reilly did a few nights ago and made fun of Ron Paul.
[00:24:24.874 --> 00:24:25.214]  That's it.
[00:24:25.715 --> 00:24:29.595]  No one else is showing serious statesmen that are respected.
[00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:31.536]  Say what you want about Putin.
[00:24:31.576 --> 00:24:40.677]  He's respected when the President of Russia says that they think it was staged and they think more is coming.
[00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:42.357]  That should be on our news.
[00:24:42.998 --> 00:24:45.578]  Let's go ahead and play Ron Paul from his own show last week.
[00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:47.398]  And we've got Ron Paul again on RT.
[00:24:47.438 --> 00:24:50.539]  In fact, I want to play both clips, but here's Ron Paul on his own program.
[00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:53.869]  And who would benefit?
[00:24:54.130 --> 00:25:01.215]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this, and take no signs of this, and you were just an analyst.
[00:25:01.776 --> 00:25:06.739]  It doesn't make any sense for Saud under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.445]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:20.113]  We got one more clip of him on RT that's a lot longer, but we'll just play part of it right now, where he basically says the same thing.
[00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:21.533]  So, this is not kooky.
[00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:26.334]  This is what most people geopolitically believe and know, because you have a group that's been caught doing it before.
[00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:31.016]  They have the motive to do it again, because it'll bring the United States in to kick out their enemy Assad.
[00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:39.078]  You have Al Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nusra, all celebrating day one since last Thursday of the strikes, and giving them hope now.
[00:25:40.114 --> 00:25:41.495]  And they've had more attacks on U.S.
[00:25:41.555 --> 00:25:55.045]  camps inside Syria in the last few days as they get oxygen in their lungs in this civil war that we've now been injected into, that I supported because I wanted to end it by kicking al-Qaeda and al-Nusra and these groups out.
[00:25:56.066 --> 00:25:58.188]  But that's not happening now, it looks like.
[00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:00.370]  So, things are spiraling out of control.
[00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.392]  I'm going to cover China in the next segment, which is really the big enchilada.
[00:26:03.892 --> 00:26:06.014]  But right now, let's get back to Ron Paul's clip.
[00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.433]  They needed a so-called excuse.
[00:26:09.453 --> 00:26:20.583]  They worked real hard, that is our government and their coalition, an excuse to go into Iraq so they concocted stories, all kinds of things, and that's what this is part of.
[00:26:20.963 --> 00:26:25.828]  I don't know why, if any of it is true, why they couldn't wait and take a look at it.
[00:26:26.108 --> 00:26:34.275]  You know, a few years ago, in 2013, there were these similar stories that, you know, didn't go anywhere because with a little bit of a pause,
[00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:38.898]  Because there was a resistance to it built up in our Congress as well as the American people.
[00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:43.261]  They thought it was all, you know, a fraud and that nothing like that was happening.
[00:26:43.782 --> 00:26:55.030]  And right now I just don't see how it could conceivably be what they claim because it's helping ISIS, it's helping Al-Qaeda, it's helping the enemy that we're supposedly fighting.
[00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:55.370]  That's right.
[00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.750]  Bingo.
[00:26:56.171 --> 00:26:56.871]  Total bingo.
[00:26:56.931 --> 00:26:58.232]  Everything there's total veritas.
[00:26:58.512 --> 00:26:59.133]  Who can deny it?
[00:26:59.781 --> 00:27:09.750]  Now, I'm going to play this and really try to not start it and stop it, because I want to come back and get into the North Korea situation with China that's probably ten times bigger than this, but this is all illustrative of how our media deceives.
[00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:17.838]  Here's CNN trying to drive a wedge in Trump's main populist support base, trying to give us attention, hoping we do it more.
[00:27:17.898 --> 00:27:19.340]  I could care less about being on CNN.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.924]  Trying to get us all to throw the baby out with the bathwater and be mad at Trump.
[00:27:26.653 --> 00:27:38.694]  When overall he's doing a great job domestically and I understand why he did this to look strong and he couldn't tell either way and they also wanted to send a message to North Korea and it seems like it's happened.
[00:27:41.249 --> 00:27:46.531]  And so we're going to start the clip now, and then we're going to come back with the rest of it on the other side.
[00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:46.831]  You know what?
[00:27:47.612 --> 00:27:55.515]  I'll go to the clip when we come back on the other side, just so we have plenty of time to get to it, and then I'll get into all the other big issues that we're facing.
[00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:58.376]  But Alt-Right turns on President Trump.
[00:27:59.116 --> 00:28:01.898]  We'll detail exactly what's happening there when we come back.
[00:28:02.158 --> 00:28:02.598]  First off,
[00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:15.939]  I talked earlier about how Google, Media Matters, the Democrats, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they're all bragging, hey, we've demonetized InfoWars 75%, Paul's got all the graphs, he's broken that down last week.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.162]  They're bragging how they kicked us off Google Ads via AdRoll.
[00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:27.628]  They brag how they're not letting, they're age-restricting us, and just mild videos that we cover that would never be age-restricted on CNN.
[00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:32.392]  They are strangling us a hundred different ways, basically, and admitting it.
[00:28:33.382 --> 00:28:42.570]  Understand, they've sold this to the left that, oh, it's cute and fun if we shut up the nationalists, the patriots, what they call the alt-right.
[00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.092]  That's a form of dehumanization.
[00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:45.172]  I'm not the alt-right.
[00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:49.757]  I'm a libertarian who really wants prosperity and freedom for everybody.
[00:28:50.237 --> 00:28:51.498]  I fight real racism.
[00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:53.440]  I fight real classism.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.321]  I want prosperity.
[00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:57.924]  That's why I'm against this war expanding and all the rest of it.
[00:28:58.184 --> 00:29:00.006]  That's why I'm critical of Trump.
[00:29:00.466 --> 00:29:03.709]  When Democrats wouldn't be critical of Hillary doing this, you can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.251]  I have integrity.
[00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:06.472]  I have credibility.
[00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.335]  I don't get my funding from political parties or big corporations.
[00:29:09.635 --> 00:29:13.238]  I get it from listeners that support us and buy the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:17.783]  But we're able to finish funding ourselves with outside advertising, which they're trying to kill.
[00:29:19.127 --> 00:29:33.959]  Now, the good Lord's opened a lot of other windows to us to support us, so I'm very thankful, but if you're not spreading InfoWars.com articles, if you're not telling people, hey, this is the forbidden site, this is the cutting edge, this is the guy they want to arrest as a Ruski, because he actually cares about the country and really is moral.
[00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.160]  This is the guy they physically attack.
[00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:39.684]  If you want us to win, understand we're fighting for you.
[00:29:40.524 --> 00:29:47.511]  And we need you to spread the word, to pray for us, and to financially go to MFORWARESTORE.COM and buy some of the great products you need.
[00:29:47.871 --> 00:29:51.934]  Sign up for AutoShip and get 10% off, and that way you know you're committed and get a big discount.
[00:29:52.095 --> 00:29:52.735]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.815 --> 00:29:53.176]  March.
[00:29:53.676 --> 00:29:55.197]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.217 --> 00:29:56.378]  Time to stop World War III right now.
[00:29:56.398 --> 00:29:58.901]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:07.502]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs, and today, Vladimir Putin says U.S.
[00:30:07.542 --> 00:30:13.887]  preparing to bomb Syrian capital and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:17.109]  Sounds like someone's been watching MSNBC.
[00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.731]  Seriously, guys?
[00:30:18.951 --> 00:30:21.653]  We should be Putin, our differences, Assad!
[00:30:23.214 --> 00:30:25.957]  Either way, Vladimir Putin has sensationally claimed that the U.S.
[00:30:25.977 --> 00:30:31.321]  is preparing airstrikes on the Syrian capital and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[00:30:33.362 --> 00:30:33.862]  You hear that?
[00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:34.402]  That's right.
[00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:35.722]  Those are owls and crickets.
[00:30:35.902 --> 00:30:39.503]  Because the left doesn't have any more Russia, Russia, Russia!
[00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:44.925]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when tomahawk missiles hit Syria.
[00:30:45.705 --> 00:30:48.086]  The Russian leader made the astonishing claim that the U.S.
[00:30:48.126 --> 00:30:55.348]  is planning to fake chemical weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President, Sergio Mattarella.
[00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:58.950]  Well, you can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.990]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:31:03.502 --> 00:31:11.244]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:31:11.484 --> 00:31:17.885]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:26.407]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:31:26.687 --> 00:31:35.457]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:31:35.717 --> 00:31:41.444]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:31:41.784 --> 00:31:42.264]  It works.
[00:31:42.545 --> 00:31:50.849]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:31:50.889 --> 00:32:00.414]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:01.254]  A total 360 win.
[00:32:07.543 --> 00:32:09.044]  There is a crisis in America today.
[00:32:09.504 --> 00:32:11.906]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[00:32:12.226 --> 00:32:19.612]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[00:32:20.032 --> 00:32:23.615]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:25.116]  I have the answer for you today.
[00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:26.677]  It's called the Blocky Pocket.
[00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:32.739]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.944]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[00:32:39.765 --> 00:32:42.227]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[00:32:42.447 --> 00:32:48.391]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[00:32:49.172 --> 00:32:50.834]  With a block-it pocket, this is impossible.
[00:32:51.295 --> 00:32:53.998]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[00:32:54.299 --> 00:32:58.845]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own block-it pocket.
[00:33:20.044 --> 00:33:23.948]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:30.293]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.561 --> 00:33:43.726]  Last week, Bashar al-Assad's regime killed even more of its own people using chemical weapons.
[00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:50.531]  Our missile strike in response to his repeated use of banned weapons was necessary as a matter of U.S.
[00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:52.031]  national security interest.
[00:33:53.072 --> 00:34:04.395]  We do not want the regime's uncontrolled stockpile of chemical weapons to fall into the hands of ISIS or other terrorist groups who could and want to attack the United States or our allies.
[00:34:05.716 --> 00:34:12.518]  Nor can we accept the normalization of the use of chemical weapons by other actors or countries in Syria or elsewhere.
[00:34:14.335 --> 00:34:14.775]  The U.S.
[00:34:15.015 --> 00:34:20.896]  is grateful for the statements of all of our partners who have expressed support for our timely and proportional response.
[00:34:22.117 --> 00:34:30.958]  As events shift, the United States will continue to evaluate its strategic options and opportunities to de-escalate violence across Syria.
[00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:43.621]  Many nations look to the Geneva process to resolve the Syrian conflict in a way that produces stability and gives the Syrian people the opportunity to determine their own political future.
[00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:48.176]  And our hope is Bashar al-Assad will not be a part of that future.
[00:34:49.497 --> 00:34:58.203]  If the Astana ceasefire negotiations become effective towards achieving a durable ceasefire, then the Geneva process has the opportunity to accelerate.
[00:34:59.123 --> 00:35:02.105]  To date, Astana has not produced much progress.
[00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:09.950]  It is also clear Russia has failed to uphold the agreements that had been entered into under multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
[00:35:11.221 --> 00:35:22.071]  These agreements stipulated Russia as the guarantor of a Syria free of chemical weapons, that they would also locate, secure, and destroy all such armaments in Syria.
[00:35:23.873 --> 00:35:30.119]  Stockpiles and continued use demonstrate that Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on its 2013 commitment.
[00:35:32.074 --> 00:35:37.958]  It is unclear whether Russia failed to take this obligation seriously or Russia has been incompetent.
[00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:42.441]  But this distinction doesn't much matter to the dead.
[00:35:43.682 --> 00:35:44.942]  We can't let this happen again.
[00:35:47.784 --> 00:35:57.671]  I'm really proud of InfoWars and our team and our sources because you notice I said on Thursday and Friday I didn't know exactly what was going on but we laid out the best info that was out there and then over the weekend
[00:35:58.931 --> 00:36:12.297]  I filed reports telling you exactly what was happening and on Monday Paul Watson put a report out that President Trump is resisting neocon calls for a no-fly zone and a wider war.
[00:36:12.677 --> 00:36:14.678]  We can put that article back up on screen.
[00:36:15.238 --> 00:36:19.200]  Some of that article is word-for-word what the president said in meetings.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.981]  I had that from one source.
[00:36:23.562 --> 00:36:27.604]  And then it was what was said in a telephone conversation with another person.
[00:36:28.746 --> 00:36:29.787]  Who I called and checked with.
[00:36:31.488 --> 00:36:33.169]  I mean, I have my White House sources.
[00:36:33.209 --> 00:36:34.270]  We get White House memos.
[00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.672]  We get a lot of stuff that the rest of the media doesn't get.
[00:36:37.973 --> 00:36:44.178]  And so, the president by the weekend understood that some of his surrogates and others were running wild, pushing a war narrative.
[00:36:45.037 --> 00:36:47.679]  So he began to put out the narrative that we're not doing a no-fly zone.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.361]  We're following the old plan.
[00:36:49.421 --> 00:36:53.204]  Bashar Assad was supposed to step down after we kicked out Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:36:53.564 --> 00:37:01.912]  We've got a force there to let him know that he should open up what he said he would do four years ago to have elections once Al-Qaeda and ISIS is out of the area.
[00:37:03.553 --> 00:37:06.816]  And it was also a strong message that nobody better be using chemical weapons.
[00:37:07.636 --> 00:37:09.738]  And why weren't those weapons still shipped out of the country?
[00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:12.641]  And it was an even bigger message to China
[00:37:13.945 --> 00:37:19.868]  And, of course, to North Korea, who are threatening everybody and are a serious threat, 50 times worse than what's happening in Syria.
[00:37:20.528 --> 00:37:22.069]  Syria is not a threat to the United States.
[00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:24.290]  Having a war with Russia over it is.
[00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.131]  So, again, who started the war?
[00:37:31.253 --> 00:37:36.475]  The Clinton-controlled Obama neocon-run Obama White House.
[00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:38.803]  That's a fact.
[00:37:39.663 --> 00:37:43.588]  And so it's our mess, and I get Trump says he owns it now, he wants to fix it.
[00:37:43.808 --> 00:37:44.849]  And I believe the President.
[00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.252]  He wants prosperity, he doesn't want a bunch of wars.
[00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:50.155]  But we have to have peace through strength.
[00:37:53.658 --> 00:37:55.919]  Syria could become a US-Russian proxy war.
[00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:56.499]  Absolutely.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.320]  That's what the experts are saying.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.981]  It's already been a proxy war for six years.
[00:38:01.482 --> 00:38:02.902]  And Russia has the moral high ground.
[00:38:03.182 --> 00:38:04.203]  I'm not a Russophile.
[00:38:04.923 --> 00:38:05.864]  I'm not an Anglophile.
[00:38:05.924 --> 00:38:07.024]  I'm not an EUphile.
[00:38:07.544 --> 00:38:08.865]  I'm an Americanphile.
[00:38:09.265 --> 00:38:10.626]  I'm an Americana guy.
[00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:11.806]  I love America.
[00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:14.067]  I want our sovereignty.
[00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:15.528]  I want our taxes cut.
[00:38:15.608 --> 00:38:16.568]  I want better deals.
[00:38:19.195 --> 00:38:22.756]  Trump has crippled Russia by saying coal's back on the table.
[00:38:23.056 --> 00:38:26.097]  That drove down their natural gas prices by half in one day.
[00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.198]  We're not against Russia.
[00:38:29.318 --> 00:38:36.080]  One of the few things Nikki Haley said that's true is Trump's strengthening our military and driving down energy prices in Europe.
[00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:40.362]  We've got these new super ships that are giant gas tankers.
[00:38:42.506 --> 00:38:47.488]  One of those ships loaded has enough gas for a major city like London for a year.
[00:38:47.848 --> 00:38:50.589]  It's just insane, the amount of liquid gas we've got.
[00:38:53.511 --> 00:38:58.413]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, putting coal back on there drove down the prices of natural gas.
[00:38:58.453 --> 00:39:05.316]  Quite frankly, it hurt American consumers as well, but sorry, coal outweighs all that for overall energy prices.
[00:39:06.036 --> 00:39:10.858]  So that's, when I say consumers, I mean people selling gas, I should say producers.
[00:39:14.377 --> 00:39:18.599]  But that wasn't enough when Nikki Haley was at the Women's World Group bad-mouthing Russia.
[00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:19.319]  They booed.
[00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:20.600]  They want more!
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.981]  They're liberal women that listen to NPR.
[00:39:23.001 --> 00:39:26.023]  And you listen to NPR, it's like the anti-Russia channel.
[00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:27.143]  It's crazy.
[00:39:29.524 --> 00:39:29.804]  Okay.
[00:39:33.106 --> 00:39:41.010]  But what Rex Tillerson said is very, very encouraging and is word for word what I told you in a memo Sunday.
[00:39:42.017 --> 00:39:45.519]  On the live show, and one I told you on Monday in Paul Watson's article.
[00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:47.860]  That is a transcript, that article he wrote, that I gave him.
[00:39:50.161 --> 00:39:54.262]  And a good three paragraphs are directly out of the President's mouth.
[00:39:54.702 --> 00:39:55.763]  And I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:39:57.764 --> 00:39:59.865]  Now Michael Savage believes Trump has made a mistake.
[00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:01.065]  I respect Michael Savage.
[00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.906]  He's one of the smartest people on talk radio.
[00:40:04.347 --> 00:40:05.027]  Maybe he's right.
[00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:10.191]  Savage certainly knows his audience is against it, and my audience is about 80% against it.
[00:40:10.952 --> 00:40:13.053]  All I'm saying is, let's not drive a wedge.
[00:40:14.694 --> 00:40:27.782]  Let's not let the left come in and make Trump think he's lost his base so that he has to compromise with the globalists and give in when on trade and borders and security and free speech and killing TPP.
[00:40:28.482 --> 00:40:30.123]  He is doing amazing things.
[00:40:30.163 --> 00:40:35.587]  He's bringing Glass-Steagall back, banking regulation, so the big banks can't sit there and create derivatives.
[00:40:37.438 --> 00:40:39.279]  And now let's go to the CNN piece I mentioned.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.921]  Alt-right turns on President Trump.
[00:40:45.683 --> 00:40:57.992]  The alt-right deplorable crowd who voted in literally Hitler are turning on Trump because he punished a leader for using chemical weapons on innocent civilians.
[00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:00.413]  Okay.
[00:41:01.214 --> 00:41:02.234]  Where's your proof?
[00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:04.376]  You have rebels caught doing it.
[00:41:07.236 --> 00:41:14.580]  You have ambassadors and former Congress people and world leaders saying that it's a false flag, that Russia would never be involved in this.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.423]  You have the neocons and the warmongering liberals calling for war with Russia.
[00:41:23.144 --> 00:41:24.145]  How's that for peace?
[00:41:26.886 --> 00:41:27.767]  And then you've got CNN.
[00:41:29.315 --> 00:41:33.497]  Taking snippets out of context to make it look like everybody's turned on Trump.
[00:41:33.777 --> 00:41:40.300]  When Cernovich has been on air since Friday saying no, he supports Trump, he just doesn't support the people giving him bad info.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.741]  Just like our other guests have said.
[00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:51.404]  And Paul Watson is off the Trump train when it comes to geopolitics, not off the Trump train completely.
[00:41:51.884 --> 00:41:53.425]  And I never said I was off the Trump train.
[00:41:53.465 --> 00:41:54.345]  Thank God for Trump.
[00:41:54.785 --> 00:41:55.826]  Let's just celebrate
[00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:59.395]  That globalism is being exposed all over the world.
[00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:00.775]  Le Pen is in the lead to win.
[00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:02.356]  She was against this strike, by the way.
[00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:05.958]  And that great things are happening worldwide.
[00:42:05.978 --> 00:42:08.759]  And that Trump already got a good Supreme Court justice in.
[00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:12.140]  And let's just thank God for how we move the ball down the field.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.501]  And we don't know everything Trump knows.
[00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:36.132]  It'd be so easy for me to just sit here and go, oh yeah, Trump's horrible, he sold us out, he's all bad, and then we all turn away from politics, turn away when we've got critical battles on more Supreme Court nominees, on getting the tax cuts we want, on getting Obamacare repealed that now Rand Paul's haunt showing, and all these other great things when he's done so much!
[00:42:36.152 --> 00:42:41.575]  3 trillion in the stock market, 300 billion in new jobs announced, hundreds of major companies coming back.
[00:42:41.815 --> 00:42:42.956]  Do I need to announce all this?
[00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:49.837]  Saying that the extremist bureau of the FBI isn't going to target Americans and patriots and only focus on radical Islam.
[00:42:50.117 --> 00:42:52.257]  Exposing the fact that they won't expose radical Islam.
[00:42:53.818 --> 00:42:57.659]  Trying to block people from seven unvetted countries who don't even have real passports.
[00:42:58.379 --> 00:43:07.362]  Failed states like Libya and Sudan and Somalia where they sell women on slave auction blocks and where we have
[00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:09.797]  Who's that Oliver guy?
[00:43:09.857 --> 00:43:11.478]  I forget all their names, the late night guys.
[00:43:11.538 --> 00:43:16.919]  And Colbert, they've all made jokes like, what's a slave block?
[00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:19.500]  And Jones claims that slavery is still going on.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.100]  It's sick.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.880]  It's sick.
[00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:24.782]  When I have it in the news today, International Business Times, there's video coming up.
[00:43:25.082 --> 00:43:27.682]  Migrants are being sold at open slave markets in Libya.
[00:43:28.082 --> 00:43:29.583]  I'm just informed, folks.
[00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:41.631]  I know so many men that are as smart as I am, but you go to their house, they've got all these footballs, all these baseballs, all these jerseys, all they want to talk to you about is football games, and do you want to go to the World Series with them?
[00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:43.872]  Do you want to go play golf with them?
[00:43:44.892 --> 00:43:56.178]  And I go, I'm going to spend time with my children, or I'm going to hike, I'm going to swim, I'm going to barbecue, I'm going to be involved in charities because that makes me feel good, just at an instinctive level, be giving back.
[00:43:57.403 --> 00:43:58.864]  And I can't live in a fantasy world.
[00:43:59.364 --> 00:44:01.686]  You know what Babe Ruth hit in 1937.
[00:44:02.907 --> 00:44:08.550]  You know what Strawberry hit, you know, in 1972 or whatever.
[00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:14.494]  I mean, you know what Nolan Ryan did in, you know, 1991.
[00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:16.495]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:16.996 --> 00:44:18.217]  It's not that I don't like baseball.
[00:44:18.937 --> 00:44:20.798]  If I start watching it, I'll end up being obsessed with it.
[00:44:21.098 --> 00:44:21.779]  I played baseball.
[00:44:23.868 --> 00:44:25.809]  We're about to have nuclear war with North Korea.
[00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:26.990]  I got children, folks.
[00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:42.841]  I'm a normal man that... Men are designed to understand factoids and information and stats and topography and all this knowledge we have to build things, to create a civilization, but also to analyze threats.
[00:44:43.361 --> 00:44:44.522]  And so that's what I do.
[00:44:44.542 --> 00:44:50.886]  And I built InfoWars to take on the globalists that I knew were trying to take over our country and destroy our freedoms.
[00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:58.233]  And look what one man did in 22 years interfacing with other men and women and listeners who cared.
[00:44:58.434 --> 00:45:00.856]  Look what we built with this little focal point.
[00:45:01.776 --> 00:45:02.897]  That's why they're so scared of what we do.
[00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:05.579]  That's why we need your prayers.
[00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:06.360]  We need your support.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.622]  Because the enemy knows we're the tip of the spear.
[00:45:09.102 --> 00:45:10.043]  They know we're walking point.
[00:45:10.803 --> 00:45:11.804]  And I'm here telling you.
[00:45:12.264 --> 00:45:14.126]  Do I have any respect with anybody out there?
[00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:18.268]  That Trump, overall, is good.
[00:45:18.428 --> 00:45:19.229]  They hate him.
[00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:21.170]  He would never have done the things he did.
[00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.331]  It's irrevocable.
[00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:24.572]  His defeat of the media discredits him.
[00:45:24.752 --> 00:45:25.593]  They totally hate him.
[00:45:26.113 --> 00:45:30.416]  The things he's able to do, the things he's gotten done, are seismic.
[00:45:30.596 --> 00:45:32.257]  I'm getting the biggest chills of my life right now.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.142]  I know in my gut that Trump's for real.
[00:45:40.422 --> 00:45:41.523]  Can he be compromised?
[00:45:41.543 --> 00:45:42.384]  Can he be manipulated?
[00:45:42.704 --> 00:45:43.464]  Could he be killed?
[00:45:43.604 --> 00:45:44.145]  Absolutely.
[00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.211]  Can he go sideways?
[00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:47.211]  Can he get confused?
[00:45:47.451 --> 00:45:48.472]  Is he 70 years old?
[00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:49.172]  Absolutely.
[00:45:51.654 --> 00:45:52.594]  But it isn't about Trump.
[00:45:52.654 --> 00:45:53.274]  It's about us.
[00:45:53.675 --> 00:45:57.977]  And we can't sit there whether he goes forward or sideways or backwards and make it all about him.
[00:45:58.317 --> 00:46:00.518]  We gotta make it about what are we doing in city councils?
[00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:02.019]  What are we doing in legislatures?
[00:46:02.379 --> 00:46:03.480]  What are we doing on air?
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.781]  Have you started a YouTube channel?
[00:46:05.001 --> 00:46:06.802]  Have you started your own blog talk radio?
[00:46:07.022 --> 00:46:08.863]  Have you started your own local access show?
[00:46:09.143 --> 00:46:10.504]  It maybe used to be in radio.
[00:46:10.704 --> 00:46:12.265]  Have you gone and told local stations?
[00:46:13.874 --> 00:46:15.615]  I want to do a show and I'm going to get some sponsors.
[00:46:16.876 --> 00:46:17.737]  Where's your hunger?
[00:46:18.598 --> 00:46:21.700]  Don't just say, thank God Alex Jones is there and then not stand up.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.842]  I need you, no matter what you got.
[00:46:23.902 --> 00:46:26.324]  Black skin, brown skin, red skin, pink skin.
[00:46:26.644 --> 00:46:27.925]  I don't, you got red blood.
[00:46:27.945 --> 00:46:30.127]  I don't care if you're a man, a woman, whatever.
[00:46:31.267 --> 00:46:35.931]  To have some energy and to take action and to focus on the globalists and what they're doing.
[00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:37.092]  Trump's not the enemy.
[00:46:38.613 --> 00:46:43.116]  Trump's imperfect, but he's already moved the ball down the field and won some major victories.
[00:46:44.127 --> 00:46:51.613]  We don't rise and fall with him, or Le Pen, or Farage, or Matt Drudge, or Alex Jones, or anybody else.
[00:46:52.954 --> 00:46:58.739]  We rise and fall on you, and your relationship with God, and your will to take action against evil.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:04.364]  So here's CNN celebrating, oh the alt-right's mad, oh the alt-right's, you know, well you know what?
[00:47:04.564 --> 00:47:05.925]  At least we have a conscience.
[00:47:06.686 --> 00:47:07.627]  Let's play the club, here it is.
[00:47:09.141 --> 00:47:20.822]  President Donald Trump ordering a military strike in Syria was like a punch to the gut for the alt-right, a group of Trump's most loyal supporters who, in part, voted for him because of his anti-war stance.
[00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:25.108]  The alt writes anger on display in a storm of online tweets.
[00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:34.115]  Trump's base of support is gone if he goes to war with Syria, wrote blogger and author Mike Cernovich, just as the strike on Syria was beginning.
[00:47:34.235 --> 00:47:35.936]  These people are totally turning on Trump.
[00:47:36.096 --> 00:47:48.926]  Alex Jones, founder of the conspiracy-driven InfoWars website, said after the strikes he'd give Trump the benefit of the doubt, but still tweeted, we are closer to the start of World War III than we have been in decades.
[00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:54.647]  I asked the question, why would Trump hit a chemical weapons depot with thousands of tons of chemicals?
[00:48:11.172 --> 00:48:18.535]  InfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson also railed against Trump, tweeting, I guess Trump wasn't Putin's puppet after all.
[00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:20.876]  I'm officially off the Trump train.
[00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:26.038]  Right-wing commentator Ann Coulter, who campaigned for Trump, tweeted her dismay.
[00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:30.380]  Those who wanted us meddling in the Middle East voted for other candidates.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:39.324]  And this reminder, Trump campaigned on not getting involved in Mideast, said it always helps our enemies and creates more refugees.
[00:48:39.804 --> 00:48:41.485]  Then he saw a picture on TV.
[00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:46.587]  Even as far back as 2013, Trump said he was against U.S.
[00:48:46.647 --> 00:48:47.928]  involvement in the Middle East.
[00:48:48.388 --> 00:48:54.171]  He tweeted then that Obama should save his powder, pleading with him, do not attack Syria.
[00:48:54.751 --> 00:49:02.915]  This tweet from a veteran to Donald Trump was a clear sign his supporters had lost patience with his predecessors and perhaps him too.
[00:49:03.435 --> 00:49:05.656]  It reads, no more regime changes.
[00:49:06.016 --> 00:49:07.577]  No more American dead.
[00:49:08.117 --> 00:49:09.457]  No more nation building.
[00:49:09.917 --> 00:49:10.998]  It's what you ran on.
[00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:12.718]  Even before the U.S.
[00:49:12.758 --> 00:49:19.580]  strike, some of Trump's alt-right base were even selling the idea that the chemical attack on the Syrian people was a hoax.
[00:49:20.081 --> 00:49:23.022]  Blogger Mike Cernovich started the hashtag... It paused.
[00:49:23.062 --> 00:49:23.782]  Backing up a second.
[00:49:24.162 --> 00:49:26.383]  Michael Savage has come out with a post on Infowars.com.
[00:49:27.603 --> 00:49:30.565]  Michael Savage turns on Trump, says Syrian gas attack was a false flag.
[00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:31.785]  Well, I love Michael.
[00:49:31.966 --> 00:49:35.768]  Notice we said it last Wednesday, and we had the first article out on it.
[00:49:35.788 --> 00:49:37.369]  I just want to point out, we're the trailblazers.
[00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:38.729]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.472]  Just like we exposed the CIA planning evidence of Russian stuff.
[00:49:42.732 --> 00:49:44.072]  We told you that months before.
[00:49:44.413 --> 00:49:45.433]  It was in the Hill today.
[00:49:45.773 --> 00:49:46.574]  Let's go back to the piece.
[00:49:46.971 --> 00:49:47.011]  No.
[00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:48.572]  We did it first.
[00:49:48.592 --> 00:49:55.678]  When he didn't, to make his point, blogger Mike Cernovich stayed live online for 11 hours, slamming Trump's decision.
[00:50:16.494 --> 00:50:18.817]  If we're going to war with Syria, I'm moving to Argentina.
[00:50:19.298 --> 00:50:22.602]  If Trump is going to bring us to war, then that means there's no hope for America.
[00:50:22.962 --> 00:50:24.244]  No hope for America?
[00:50:24.785 --> 00:50:32.695]  Or no hope for alt-right Trump supporters who may suddenly be wondering if their president is a dove or a hawk?
[00:50:34.286 --> 00:50:40.349]  So now the most demonized group in America, coined by Hillary Clinton, and my dark heart, remember dark heart speech or alt-right?
[00:50:41.009 --> 00:50:42.169]  What was the dark heart speech?
[00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:53.434]  Now, the worst people in America are against World War III, and we made up false flag, even though Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, the British ambassador, everybody else are coming out, Michael Savage is saying it's a false flag.
[00:50:53.775 --> 00:50:57.676]  We're all evil, and you're all the good moral Democrats that want war.
[00:50:58.036 --> 00:50:58.537]  Yay!
[00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:01.278]  You can watch your white helmet shows on Netflix.
[00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:05.094]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[00:51:05.114 --> 00:51:07.156]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[00:51:07.216 --> 00:51:10.641]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, I don't know about this one.
[00:51:11.082 --> 00:51:14.066]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[00:51:14.086 --> 00:51:14.667]  I'm 42.
[00:51:14.707 --> 00:51:17.611]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[00:51:17.771 --> 00:51:19.253]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:51:21.176 --> 00:51:22.297]  No, I'm not.
[00:51:22.357 --> 00:51:22.997]  I'm terrible.
[00:51:23.037 --> 00:51:23.578]  I'm terrible.
[00:51:23.678 --> 00:51:30.824]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:51:31.425 --> 00:51:38.652]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:51:38.692 --> 00:51:42.175]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:51:43.556 --> 00:51:48.801]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:51.924]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:53.606]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:51:54.006 --> 00:51:55.187]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:51:55.267 --> 00:51:56.388]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:51:56.408 --> 00:52:03.595]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:52:04.195 --> 00:52:06.396]  Yeah.
[00:52:06.536 --> 00:52:11.798]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:52:11.838 --> 00:52:13.558]  I felt it immediately.
[00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:15.799]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:52:15.879 --> 00:52:18.940]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.100]  It tastes good to me.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.162]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:52:24.202 --> 00:52:26.342]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[00:52:28.943 --> 00:52:30.023]  Bone broth.
[00:52:30.084 --> 00:52:35.205]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:52:35.225 --> 00:52:38.987]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:52:39.027 --> 00:52:46.790]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:51.592]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:58.740]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.341]  No fear, nothing, so.
[00:53:01.018 --> 00:53:08.340]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.721]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:21.984]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:23.284]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:53:23.324 --> 00:53:29.426]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:53:31.146 --> 00:53:32.927]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:53:32.987 --> 00:53:35.189]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[00:53:35.209 --> 00:53:43.273]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:53:43.313 --> 00:53:46.635]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:53:46.675 --> 00:53:49.517]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:54.660]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:02.583]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[00:54:09.146 --> 00:54:10.706]  You ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[00:54:11.367 --> 00:54:12.127]  Janis Joplin.
[00:54:12.147 --> 00:54:14.988]  Now next hour, I'm gonna be a good boy.
[00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:26.053]  I appreciate callers calling in and then holding.
[00:54:26.633 --> 00:54:35.300]  I'm going to take your phone calls on the state of the world and the situation in Korea or Syria, whatever area you'd like to get to, what you think of Trump.
[00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:39.583]  But also what you think we should push for in the agenda.
[00:54:39.923 --> 00:54:41.765]  The lower taxes, controlling our borders.
[00:54:42.485 --> 00:54:44.007]  We should also talk about the things we're thankful for.
[00:54:44.527 --> 00:54:47.890]  If we're going to attack Trump, then let's also talk about what he's done that's good.
[00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:57.533]  Because believe me, if Hillary was in right now, they'd already have their new Supreme Court justice in, and they would have their way with the American people on the Second Amendment, on taxes, on everything you can imagine.
[00:54:58.033 --> 00:55:00.254]  So, let's thank God for the reprieves we've gotten.
[00:55:00.874 --> 00:55:03.315]  We have come so far from where we were just five years ago.
[00:55:04.056 --> 00:55:06.897]  Just five, six years ago, the public didn't know the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:55:07.377 --> 00:55:08.637]  They didn't know about global government.
[00:55:08.997 --> 00:55:10.118]  All of it's admitted now!
[00:55:11.414 --> 00:55:24.085]  And once it's out in the open that a foreign world government's running things or the EU's not elected, then they are forced to go to force with the head of the EU, Juncker, the Nazi heir, saying, I will invade you.
[00:55:24.225 --> 00:55:25.045]  I will take you over.
[00:55:25.206 --> 00:55:26.327]  I will break up America.
[00:55:26.827 --> 00:55:27.768]  I am in charge.
[00:55:27.828 --> 00:55:29.729]  You will submit to me.
[00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:30.570]  Good.
[00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:31.291]  Go ahead and try it.
[00:55:33.192 --> 00:55:33.713]  So that's all.
[00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.110]  That's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:40.411]  I'm going to kick the next hour off with the huge news in China.
[00:55:41.012 --> 00:55:45.253]  It is so over the top, with North Korea threatening to nuke our carrier task force.
[00:55:45.613 --> 00:55:47.353]  They're the ones taking over the South China Sea.
[00:55:47.633 --> 00:55:48.834]  They're the ones boarding ships.
[00:55:49.334 --> 00:55:50.934]  They're the ones threatening to attack countries.
[00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:55.576]  Under international law, the United States could nuke China and Korea right now.
[00:55:55.956 --> 00:55:57.296]  The media says I'm calling for that.
[00:55:57.376 --> 00:55:57.956]  No, I'm not.
[00:55:59.357 --> 00:56:03.198]  But we have a first strike doctrine if somebody aims missiles at us and says they may hit us first.
[00:56:04.363 --> 00:56:08.584]  You point a gun at somebody, you put your finger on the trigger and you say, I'm going to shoot you.
[00:56:08.604 --> 00:56:12.086]  I have every damn right in the world to pull my gun and shoot you.
[00:56:12.106 --> 00:56:17.628]  I don't want to have a nuclear war, CNN, Right Wing Watch, all you other liars.
[00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:20.769]  There it is.
[00:56:21.429 --> 00:56:21.809]  Reuters.
[00:56:22.329 --> 00:56:22.969]  Fox News.
[00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:24.830]  Recent developments surrounding the South China Sea.
[00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:26.010]  Let's go back and show them that headline.
[00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:29.272]  With North Korea threatening to nuke the task force.
[00:56:29.292 --> 00:56:29.692]  There it is.
[00:56:29.732 --> 00:56:30.192]  North Korea.
[00:56:31.767 --> 00:56:34.350]  State media warns of nuclear strike and provoked as U.S.
[00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.950]  warships approach.
[00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:36.853]  We ought to arrest Hillary and Bill right now.
[00:56:37.053 --> 00:56:42.759]  They're the ones that signed off and got personal money for transferring the nuclear reactors to them in the mid-1990s.
[00:56:42.979 --> 00:56:44.861]  That was all over the news at the time.
[00:56:45.121 --> 00:56:48.985]  But because I have a memory that's 22 years back, from 1995-96, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:56:56.049 --> 00:57:00.254]  We told you before it was in the WikiLeaks the CIA was staging fake cyber attacks on the U.S.
[00:57:00.474 --> 00:57:00.994]  How do we know?
[00:57:01.535 --> 00:57:06.961]  Cyber Command six years ago admitted they were launching fake cyber attacks to get agencies to go along with it.
[00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:08.382]  That's how arrogant they are.
[00:57:08.402 --> 00:57:10.745]  All right, let me just stop there.
[00:57:11.005 --> 00:57:11.866]  We need your support.
[00:57:11.906 --> 00:57:12.687]  We need your prayers.
[00:57:13.088 --> 00:57:15.730]  We're running a special I've never seen.
[00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:21.743]  I saw this today, I don't know who came up with this, because our profit on these is less than 40%.
[00:57:22.223 --> 00:57:27.948]  They are offering the InfoWars Flash Special, get the Pro-Pure Nomad Water Filtration System.
[00:57:28.509 --> 00:57:33.373]  This cuts all the garbage out, folks, for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:33.853 --> 00:57:44.923]  We are launching an unprecedented 40% off mega special on the Pro-Pure, amazing, super high-quality, gravity-fed Nomad Gravity Water Filtration System at InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time.
[00:57:45.123 --> 00:57:46.403]  Yeah, I don't know how they're doing this.
[00:57:46.764 --> 00:57:54.266]  This is the most versatile system from ProPure that uses high-powered water filtration technology to eliminate everything from pesticides to chlorine to sodium fluoride.
[00:57:55.466 --> 00:58:03.909]  With millions of gallons of toxic sludge dumped in our waterways by the EPA and sodium fluoride added to the water supply, having a high-quality water filter is essential.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:08.663]  And again, we don't raise it 40% like other companies get caught doing, and then lower it the next day.
[00:58:08.683 --> 00:58:09.804]  That's 40% off the regular price.
[00:58:09.824 --> 00:58:11.085]  It's a super deal at 216 smackers.
[00:58:11.145 --> 00:58:11.425]  Okay?
[00:58:11.445 --> 00:58:12.406]  At $129, nothing is even close.
[00:58:32.679 --> 00:58:33.200]  I happen to know.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.021]  I think we're buying those for like 120 bucks.
[00:58:35.361 --> 00:58:38.504]  So this is a Lost Leader five-star review.
[00:58:38.744 --> 00:58:39.885]  A perfect five-star review.
[00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.447]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:41.527 --> 00:58:42.448]  A bunch of other specials.
[00:58:42.668 --> 00:58:43.389]  Today only.
[00:58:44.269 --> 00:58:44.970]  Shop with us.
[00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.151]  We need the support.
[00:58:46.972 --> 00:58:48.753]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:59.744]  A North Korean dictator, Fling Flang Flume, I mean Kim Jong Un, warns of a nuclear strike it provoked as U.S.
[00:58:59.804 --> 00:59:02.746]  warships are now approaching the Korean peninsula.
[00:59:02.826 --> 00:59:04.507]  So tensions are heating up right now.
[00:59:04.627 --> 00:59:09.710]  Little man's gonna decide to come out and pop off a few if he thinks that we're gonna come up there and do something.
[00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:11.451]  I actually think it's kind of funny.
[00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:17.436]  I don't think that North Korea has any possible chance whatsoever just to even get outside of their country.
[00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:22.540]  I think China might have to worry, or maybe South Korea, but I really don't think anything is going to get that far out of there.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:28.145]  So I think we're doing okay, but either way, tensions are high, and they're warning of a nuclear strike if U.S.
[00:59:28.225 --> 00:59:31.267]  aggression continues with the Navy moving towards them.
[00:59:31.527 --> 00:59:31.628]  U.S.
[00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:36.531]  President Donald Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its impoverished neighbor, said in a tweet.
[00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:38.313]  North Korea was looking for trouble.
[00:59:38.573 --> 00:59:40.615]  And that we would come and solve that problem.
[00:59:40.715 --> 00:59:47.942]  Tensions have escalated sharply on the Korean Peninsula with talk of military action by the United States gaining traction following the strike last week.
[00:59:48.163 --> 00:59:51.226]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:51.246 --> 00:59:52.307]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:59:54.269 --> 00:59:58.353]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:58.873 --> 01:00:00.175]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.397 --> 01:00:05.737]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[01:00:05.757 --> 01:00:06.637]  Well, I sure did.
[01:00:06.717 --> 01:00:08.518]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.598 --> 01:00:13.939]  You know, all the bad stuff that happened in my life, I look back on it, oh, maybe who I am.
[01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.011]  Used to hear that when I was a kid.
[01:00:31.352 --> 01:00:32.113]  Rolled my eyes at it.
[01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:35.356]  Used to hear how great Texas was and how great America was.
[01:00:35.376 --> 01:00:36.798]  Rolled my eyes at that.
[01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:38.780]  Until I actually traveled the world.
[01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:42.745]  We got a lot of problems, but the elite want to shut us down for a reason.
[01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:44.067]  Let's listen to George Strait for a moment.
[01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.293]  Put the American flag up front for a second.
[01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:58.145]  Up from San Antonio.
[01:00:58.565 --> 01:00:59.667]  Everything I got.
[01:01:00.267 --> 01:01:03.571]  I ain't got a dime.
[01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:09.296]  I ain't rich, but Lord, I'm free.
[01:01:18.959 --> 01:01:23.042]  My oldest daughter, years ago, she likes George Strait.
[01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:23.582]  Who wouldn't?
[01:01:24.343 --> 01:01:27.125]  She said, Daddy, George Strait, I read it in Texas Monthly, he's rich.
[01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:28.646]  More records than the Beatles.
[01:01:32.409 --> 01:01:37.573]  And, you know, he doesn't have a dime, but he's super rich.
[01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:40.075]  That's a song about a poor rodeoer, sweetheart.
[01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:41.816]  She goes, oh, I thought he was lying.
[01:01:41.856 --> 01:01:42.296]  I said, no.
[01:01:43.345 --> 01:01:53.368]  It's a story to illustrate something, but the richer you get, if you're still tied into God, you realize that you are poor, financially.
[01:01:53.608 --> 01:01:54.529]  Money means nothing.
[01:01:54.809 --> 01:01:55.769]  More money, more problems.
[01:01:57.629 --> 01:02:01.011]  It is so satisfying in my life to take 95% of the money comes in,
[01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:06.517]  And to put it back into studios, and crew, and people, and to change the world?
[01:02:06.737 --> 01:02:12.240]  I mean, I would be embarrassed, and I'm not against guys that do it, because they're beautiful, cool cars, and I'd love a black Ferrari.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.303]  And I'd love to drive around in, you know, a car that can go 250 miles an hour, and they're really cool!
[01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:26.928]  But see, so many jerks drive it to look cool, and to make themselves look like they're the most powerful people on Earth, that I couldn't be associated with that.
[01:02:28.969 --> 01:02:30.430]  Plus, what's the point of that?
[01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.811]  I'm not saying you're bad if you have that.
[01:02:35.646 --> 01:02:40.567]  Because there's so much going on in the world, why wouldn't you put that money towards changing the world?
[01:02:40.607 --> 01:02:41.248]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:42.248 --> 01:02:44.208]  A lot of folks have old cars, classic cars.
[01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:46.569]  It's art, and people make money off of it, and it's a living.
[01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:47.890]  That's totally cool.
[01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.370]  I'm not a class-envy person.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:53.411]  I'm all about people having wealth to be self-sufficient, independent, help themselves and others.
[01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:55.612]  It's just that things can't be your God.
[01:02:55.812 --> 01:02:59.573]  I'm gonna come back with the big North Korea news, but I can't cover it in this short segment.
[01:03:00.793 --> 01:03:02.734]  News so big, I can't believe we're even reporting it.
[01:03:03.706 --> 01:03:13.149]  I mean, quite frankly, if I was a selfish man, I would be on an airplane with my children out of this country to the South Pacific.
[01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:18.971]  I'd literally be trying to move somewhere as far south as you can get.
[01:03:21.952 --> 01:03:22.472]  But you know what?
[01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:23.653]  If we run like that,
[01:03:24.653 --> 01:03:25.594]  Bad stuff's gonna happen.
[01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:31.439]  I tried to plug in last hour and I really don't plug enough because I meet with the accountants and stuff and I'm just transparent about it.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.484]  And the media and David Brock and all of them celebrate it and they've got more tricks up their sleeves and I understand that.
[01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:40.368]  We really have never really impressed the accelerator financially.
[01:03:40.728 --> 01:03:47.435]  We always just want to bring in enough to expand as we, you know, grow properly and God's working in mysterious ways here.
[01:03:49.646 --> 01:03:54.067]  You donate by taking care of yourself, taking care of us, and getting products you need.
[01:03:54.327 --> 01:03:55.808]  Quite frankly, we have lost leaders.
[01:03:55.868 --> 01:04:01.169]  I've told them to do it, but I've never offered 40% off that I can remember on a ProPure system.
[01:04:01.229 --> 01:04:02.350]  So that's just unprecedented.
[01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.871]  So quite frankly, we don't make money on that.
[01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:07.872]  I mean, just look at this review.
[01:04:08.692 --> 01:04:09.653]  I loved it from the beginning.
[01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:11.293]  Looks real fancy in the kitchen.
[01:04:11.374 --> 01:04:12.514]  I use it whenever I want.
[01:04:12.814 --> 01:04:14.155]  Great tasting, room temperature water.
[01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:14.955]  You put it over ice, too.
[01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:17.176]  I use it for... I mean, you'll make your ice cubes with it.
[01:04:17.457 --> 01:04:19.218]  I use it for all baby bottles and food.
[01:04:19.678 --> 01:04:21.078]  Filters fairly quickly.
[01:04:21.179 --> 01:04:22.939]  It takes a little while because it's a real filter.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.022]  With the five filters, maintenance is easy and first use prep is quick and simple.
[01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:29.543]  That's Tony in Massachusetts.
[01:04:30.003 --> 01:04:33.745]  Yeah, if you're not filtering your kid's water, and it doesn't mean sometimes they're not going to drink something that isn't filtered.
[01:04:34.085 --> 01:04:36.427]  But just as much as you can cut back and fill it with water.
[01:04:36.447 --> 01:04:37.427]  It's the number one thing you can do.
[01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:39.629]  Other than putting a gas mask on your kids.
[01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:41.570]  It's a lot of particulate.
[01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:42.831]  X2 is selling out.
[01:04:43.191 --> 01:04:44.792]  We're running out of the Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:04:44.812 --> 01:04:45.693]  That's just a fact.
[01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:47.374]  And we're going to be out for a while.
[01:04:47.434 --> 01:04:48.935]  And this run is out.
[01:04:48.955 --> 01:04:50.596]  We got a new small run that came in.
[01:04:50.937 --> 01:04:51.737]  The Great Halogen.
[01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:54.019]  I would stockpile that if I was you and support the broadcast.
[01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:55.720]  And we have a lot of other great products.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.640]  Caveman's back in.
[01:04:56.861 --> 01:04:57.521]  33% off.
[01:04:57.781 --> 01:05:00.263]  The Bronboth Turmeric Bee Pollen Formula.
[01:05:04.444 --> 01:05:07.707]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs, and today, Vladimir Putin says U.S.
[01:05:07.747 --> 01:05:14.092]  preparing to bomb Syrian capital and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:17.314]  Sounds like someone's been watching MSNBC.
[01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:18.936]  Seriously, guys?
[01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:21.878]  We should be Putin, our differences, Assad!
[01:05:23.399 --> 01:05:26.162]  Either way, Vladimir Putin has sensationally claimed that the U.S.
[01:05:26.182 --> 01:05:31.526]  is preparing airstrikes on the Syrian capital and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[01:05:33.567 --> 01:05:34.067]  You hear that?
[01:05:34.127 --> 01:05:34.607]  That's right.
[01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:35.927]  Those are owls and crickets.
[01:05:36.107 --> 01:05:39.708]  Because the left doesn't have any more Russia, Russia, Russia!
[01:05:40.009 --> 01:05:45.130]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when tomahawk missiles hit Syria.
[01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:48.291]  The Russian leader made the astonishing claim that the U.S.
[01:05:48.331 --> 01:05:55.553]  is planning to fake chemical weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President, Sergio Mattarella.
[01:05:55.834 --> 01:05:59.155]  Well, you can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.515 --> 01:06:00.195]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.561]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.602]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:08.503]  Minor words and his was action.
[01:07:09.103 --> 01:07:10.624]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:07:10.664 --> 01:07:16.327]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:07:16.547 --> 01:07:18.868]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:07:19.228 --> 01:07:24.151]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[01:07:24.211 --> 01:07:25.411]  Four of them here tonight.
[01:07:25.531 --> 01:07:30.834]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:44.430]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:46.733]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:07:47.414 --> 01:07:49.336]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:07:49.656 --> 01:07:53.861]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:07:54.002 --> 01:07:57.366]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:07:57.446 --> 01:07:58.987]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:21.923]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:08:22.283 --> 01:08:25.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:34.133 --> 01:08:45.283]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:48.089 --> 01:08:58.155]  We are in the middle of a massive fight for the future, not just of this republic, the United States of America, but the entire world hangs in the balance.
[01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:14.325]  Powerful forces of evil, Communist China, the EU unelected dictatorship, and the globalist combine are attempting to start a war between the United States and Russia, their two main adversaries.
[01:09:17.193 --> 01:09:25.538]  The globalists are allied with radical Islam and have been caught staging events to destabilize Europe.
[01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:39.507]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, the EU governments have banned showing jihadis raping, stabbing, shooting, murdering and running over citizens every week on average.
[01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:41.248]  There are car attacks.
[01:09:42.689 --> 01:09:45.151]  But you saw the images of the dead kids from the chemical attack.
[01:09:46.104 --> 01:09:47.145]  Was not a sarin attack.
[01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:50.748]  The people treating them were not wearing equipment.
[01:09:52.049 --> 01:09:55.352]  Two days after sarin, you get near somebody that's been hit with it, it'll kill you.
[01:09:55.372 --> 01:09:59.435]  It was some type of chlorine gas, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:59.455 --> 01:10:02.698]  And that's the type of gas used by the rebels.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.901]  Were the rebels cooking it up?
[01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:07.602]  Were the rebels preparing it?
[01:10:09.564 --> 01:10:10.485]  Was all that going on?
[01:10:12.785 --> 01:10:13.325]  Absolutely.
[01:10:13.365 --> 01:10:14.686]  Chlorine gas, you just wear a mask.
[01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:19.329]  If you're not wearing full gear, and you touch somebody that's been hit with Sarin, you're gonna die.
[01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:20.670]  Or wish you had.
[01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:28.574]  They're there washing them off with water hoses, and not even wearing rubber gloves, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:30.896 --> 01:10:33.577]  Why would the Russians or the Sarians hit themselves?
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.042]  And now Michael Savage has joined InfoWars.
[01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:57.425]  Yours truly, Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, the British Ambassador Peter Ford, and countless others that have the anti-goldfish complex.
[01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:00.126]  It's called a memory.
[01:11:00.447 --> 01:11:02.468]  Everybody else should remember that they have one.
[01:11:05.549 --> 01:11:09.611]  Up on InfoWars.com, Steve Watson has an article detailing it with a video.
[01:11:11.249 --> 01:11:14.610]  Says that the first attack is a false flag just like the one a few years ago?
[01:11:18.591 --> 01:11:21.912]  And that it's not sarin but chlorine?
[01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.053]  Any idiot can see that?
[01:11:25.033 --> 01:11:28.554]  And that he believes there are going to be more provocations to suck Trump in.
[01:11:28.574 --> 01:11:29.835]  And that's where Trump's been caught.
[01:11:30.275 --> 01:11:31.675]  I get saying don't use chemicals.
[01:11:31.735 --> 01:11:33.816]  I get shutting off the talk that he's a Russian agent.
[01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:35.737]  I get looking strong for North Korea and China.
[01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:37.277]  I know what McMaster's told him.
[01:11:37.577 --> 01:11:39.238]  But what did the British ambassador tell you?
[01:11:39.398 --> 01:11:40.138]  Let's go to him first.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:41.880]  What did he say?
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.382]  He said, you've given the jihadis a thousand percent reason.
[01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.664]  Everybody calls them al-Nusra, al-Qaeda.
[01:11:52.385 --> 01:11:53.585]  British intelligence calls it right.
[01:11:53.605 --> 01:11:54.626]  They're called jihadis.
[01:11:54.646 --> 01:11:57.107]  That's what they're called in England.
[01:11:58.427 --> 01:12:03.730]  You've given, by the way, England set the jihadis up a hundred years ago, they know, out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:08.652]  The ambassador's telling you, you've given the jihadists a thousand reasons
[01:12:09.574 --> 01:12:14.196]  And based on previous experience, including Iraq, we can see that we cannot take at face value what the so-called
[01:12:37.278 --> 01:12:37.938]  We have an agenda.
[01:12:39.079 --> 01:12:41.360]  But come back to the main point.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.860]  It's not going to end here.
[01:12:43.621 --> 01:12:46.022]  And we are likely, Britain, to be dragged into it.
[01:12:46.702 --> 01:12:55.025]  Because Trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations.
[01:12:55.605 --> 01:13:06.110]  Seeing how successful and how easy it is with a gullible media to provoke the West into intemperate reactions.
[01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:15.097]  They will very likely stage an operation similar to what they did, and this was documented by the United Nations in August last year.
[01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:23.363]  They mounted a chlorine gas attack on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was a regime operation.
[01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:24.645]  This marked my words.
[01:13:25.685 --> 01:13:26.627]  You're hearing it here.
[01:13:27.107 --> 01:13:28.008]  And it will happen.
[01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:37.239]  And we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell us that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily into Syria.
[01:13:37.499 --> 01:13:39.341]  This will be fake flag.
[01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:43.366]  And again, I've talked to chemical weapons experts.
[01:13:43.406 --> 01:13:44.627]  We should probably get some of them on air.
[01:13:45.589 --> 01:13:50.633]  But they've emailed me, they've called me, people that I've interviewed many times, and they've said, look Alex, you're not wearing gloves.
[01:13:50.673 --> 01:13:51.794]  Look, it dissipated quickly.
[01:13:51.914 --> 01:13:55.657]  Sarin, you can't go around there for days, and if people have been hit with it, you can't even touch them.
[01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.559]  You've got doctors and people that's in there.
[01:13:57.579 --> 01:13:59.360]  That's chlorine gas that you can make.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.402]  I'm not going to tell you how to make it, but it's easy to make.
[01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:05.265]  You can go to the hardware store and in one hour make chlorine gas.
[01:14:05.586 --> 01:14:07.607]  And let me tell you, it'll make you wish you were dead and it'll kill you.
[01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:10.410]  Houston's had chlorine gas get out before and kill a bunch of people.
[01:14:11.274 --> 01:14:13.335]  Chlorine gas is one of the biggest problems you see at refineries.
[01:14:13.935 --> 01:14:16.035]  It's a derivative of some of the refining processes.
[01:14:17.096 --> 01:14:33.341]  But what I'm getting at here is, before I get into Korea, the big enchilada about the numbers, is that we had the jihadis putting out stuff saying, tomorrow we're going to start a major campaign claiming we're being hit by gas.
[01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:38.102]  And then the base that had the gas got hit.
[01:14:41.889 --> 01:14:44.471]  The problem is the Russians won't talk about what they're up to and what they're doing.
[01:14:44.491 --> 01:14:45.291]  They don't tell anybody.
[01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:50.174]  It'd be nice if the Russians announced right when they hit it, by the way, we hit a chlorine gas facility.
[01:14:50.454 --> 01:14:51.215]  But they didn't do that.
[01:14:52.175 --> 01:14:55.918]  Because they probably weren't involved and probably didn't even know they were getting ready for this big attack.
[01:14:56.358 --> 01:15:01.181]  They just saw a bunch of movement the Russians did with the surveillance and said they're getting ready to do something, hit that compound.
[01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:02.322]  It had chemicals in it.
[01:15:03.903 --> 01:15:05.163]  And that's just what happened, folks.
[01:15:05.244 --> 01:15:07.285]  It wasn't sarin, it was chlorine gas.
[01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:12.204]  Somebody gets hit with sarin, you touch them, you get it on you, you're gonna die.
[01:15:12.464 --> 01:15:17.429]  You get one little piece of it on your skin, you're going to either have major brain damage or be dead.
[01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:27.319]  And again, they got caught last year doing it, they got caught in 2013 doing it, they've been caught over and over.
[01:15:28.746 --> 01:15:32.430]  Let's go ahead and go to Vladimir Putin saying the same thing and that they're getting ready for another bigger provocation.
[01:15:32.691 --> 01:15:35.434]  So what does Trump do when the next provocation comes?
[01:15:35.674 --> 01:15:37.596]  That's why Michael Savage is saying he's wronging others.
[01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.679]  He's painted himself into a corner.
[01:15:39.839 --> 01:15:43.183]  And we're not saying that because we're out to get the president or we think he's a bad guy.
[01:15:43.503 --> 01:15:45.706]  He's been trapped by McMasters.
[01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:46.327]  Here it is.
[01:15:47.526 --> 01:16:08.306]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[01:16:08.986 --> 01:16:14.987]  But we regard that any such incident would be reason enough for a thorough investigation.
[01:16:15.427 --> 01:16:32.331]  We are preparing to make a formal call to the relevant UN agency in The Hague and call on the international community to investigate thoroughly these incidents and, depending on the results of the investigation, to make informed decisions and take meaningful action.
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:40.461]  The world is at the greatest point of World War III threat since the Cuban Missile Crisis, but it's not just in Syria.
[01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:42.562]  That's as bad as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:16:43.062 --> 01:16:53.664]  We are now witnessing a major carrier task force group, nukes being moved to South Korea, and open calls by North Korea for nuclear war.
[01:16:54.004 --> 01:16:55.865]  This is an incredible crisis point.
[01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:56.945]  We come back from break.
[01:16:56.965 --> 01:17:01.506]  I'm going to begin my breakdown of that, and I want to take your calls, first-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:17:01.806 --> 01:17:02.506]  You agree.
[01:17:03.027 --> 01:17:03.807]  You disagree.
[01:17:04.966 --> 01:17:11.791]  You want to add something, you're a veteran, you're active duty, whoever you are, calling from anywhere in the world, the toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:11.871]  800-259-9231.
[01:17:11.891 --> 01:17:14.673]  There's a lot of breaking news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:23.063 --> 01:17:31.509]  We're going to come back in the next segment, and I'm going to go through in the first 10 or 15 minutes of the hour until about 40 after.
[01:17:31.609 --> 01:17:35.271]  I'm going to break down what's happening, and then I'm going to open the phones up right in to the next hour.
[01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:40.875]  I had some guests today, but I canceled them because I wanted to be able to take your calls and break all of this down.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.301]  So I get the plugging out of the way.
[01:17:44.361 --> 01:17:45.381]  We need your financial support.
[01:17:45.421 --> 01:17:46.862]  Everybody knows we're under globalist attack.
[01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:48.123]  Everybody knows they're trying to shut us down.
[01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:48.943]  They're bragging about it.
[01:17:49.023 --> 01:17:50.184]  Trying to kick us off Google Ads.
[01:17:50.224 --> 01:17:50.644]  They did.
[01:17:51.164 --> 01:17:52.965]  Demonetizing us on YouTube.
[01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.706]  About 75% is what it is monetarily.
[01:17:55.747 --> 01:17:56.227]  Everything they can.
[01:17:57.608 --> 01:17:58.189]  To shut us down.
[01:17:58.509 --> 01:18:13.227]  But they can't stop you from getting high-quality water filtration, high-quality supplements, high-quality firearms accessories, high-quality non-GMO organic toothpaste with a bunch of great things in it like colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:15.836]  The adult is sold out.
[01:18:15.896 --> 01:18:16.756]  We have the children's.
[01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:17.717]  It's the same as the adults.
[01:18:17.737 --> 01:18:21.059]  It doesn't have peppermint in it, so it's not real strong tasting.
[01:18:21.919 --> 01:18:22.560]  That's available.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.021]  Super blue, bubblegum flavor.
[01:18:25.682 --> 01:18:26.883]  Toothpaste, great for your children.
[01:18:27.783 --> 01:18:34.067]  InfoWars Flash Special is the biggest special ever on a high-quality, gravity-fed water filter from ProPure.
[01:18:34.407 --> 01:18:36.869]  The Nomad system, that's their smaller unit, but it's great.
[01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:42.893]  We're launching an unprecedented 40% off mega special on the ProPure Nomad Gravity Water Filtration System.

[01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:09.868]  Filter out chlorine, pesticides, herbicides, sodium fluoride, and hundreds of other toxic compounds with ProPure Nomad.
[01:19:09.888 --> 01:19:11.468]  It's what I use, my family uses.

[01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:40.391]  If you haven't tried it, you're crazy.

[01:19:57.223 --> 01:20:00.800]  Do yourself a favor, get great products and fund the restoration of human freedom.
[01:20:06.676 --> 01:20:11.279]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com, joining us from an undisclosed location.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:17.824]  Former Army Intelligence, a lot of folks, even currently in the government, you know, tell me this is really a dead-on guy.
[01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:23.388]  James Wesley Rawls, let's look at big picture, and then what is it InfoWars is doing that makes him so angry?
[01:20:23.748 --> 01:20:24.449]  That's key.
[01:20:24.969 --> 01:20:27.191]  Not to say, oh look, we're the biggest swing and you know what?
[01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:31.033]  It's about what are we doing that has them shaking in their boots?
[01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:31.814]  James Wesley Rawls.
[01:20:31.974 --> 01:20:36.177]  Well, Alex, I think that the truth is what really has them scared.
[01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:43.923]  And it's people like you who are champions of the truth that are striking absolute fear in their hearts.
[01:20:44.664 --> 01:20:48.727]  Because once the truth comes out as to what they really have planned,
[01:20:49.796 --> 01:21:11.364]  And how they are conspiring against the Trump administration and against the liberty movement in general and against bloggers and journalists and video bloggers in particular, then they're going to lose all credibility and they will lose the information war.
[01:21:11.604 --> 01:21:12.584]  That's where they stand.
[01:21:12.604 --> 01:21:15.145]  That's what they stand to lose right now.
[01:21:15.805 --> 01:21:17.846]  And they're in absolute panic mode.
[01:21:18.126 --> 01:21:18.747]  The Army.
[01:21:18.847 --> 01:21:20.868]  I know it was the first thing found in America on July 4, 1776.
[01:21:21.269 --> 01:21:23.450]  The Commission, George Washington.
[01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:27.033]  But the Army's done so many horrible things, obviously, under globalist control.
[01:21:27.354 --> 01:21:28.414]  Maybe that's why they're so awake.
[01:21:28.454 --> 01:21:32.578]  But it's the Army, everywhere behind the scenes, blocking the New World Order right now.
[01:21:32.878 --> 01:21:35.040]  I know you've got a lot of connections to that, at least in the past.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.341]  Did you concur with that?
[01:21:36.381 --> 01:21:37.182]  And why is that the case?
[01:21:37.882 --> 01:21:47.246]  Yes, in fact, a lot of the people that were in my year group when I was commissioned are now colonels and even brigadier generals.
[01:21:48.126 --> 01:21:54.868]  And what I'm hearing from them is that they are not going along with the program.
[01:21:55.188 --> 01:22:01.111]  They've recognized what's going on, they're awake, they're alert, and
[01:22:02.882 --> 01:22:05.183]  They're not going to put up with martial law.
[01:22:05.724 --> 01:22:11.187]  They're not going to just passively go along and say, oh, well, we're just obeying orders.
[01:22:12.047 --> 01:22:20.812]  These are intelligent, articulate people who see the big picture, and they are ready to stand in the gap if that happens.
[01:22:21.592 --> 01:22:30.055]  If there's orders for martial law and it's not a constitutional order, they're going to be the very first to say, I'm sorry, I'm not going to obey that order.
[01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:35.778]  I would say the entire combat arms and the fourth branch of the military, the CIA now,
[01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:42.463]  Almost everyone's anti-globalist, and the words come down from the CIA, the generals, everybody.
[01:22:42.783 --> 01:22:47.708]  They try to kill Trump or move for martial law, everybody, wipe them out.
[01:22:48.128 --> 01:22:52.372]  And the point is, these are all people like, people like Tonto, the hero of 13 hours.
[01:22:53.092 --> 01:22:54.714]  I mean, he's on there without me asking him to say it.
[01:22:54.854 --> 01:22:55.314]  I'm ready.
[01:22:55.534 --> 01:22:56.455]  They try it, I'm coming.
[01:22:56.475 --> 01:22:57.816]  And they come after you, I'm coming for them.
[01:22:58.117 --> 01:22:59.358]  These aren't people playing games.
[01:22:59.738 --> 01:23:01.720]  I don't think the globalists realize what they've set off here.
[01:23:03.627 --> 01:23:05.028]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:23:05.068 --> 01:23:06.149]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:23:06.389 --> 01:23:07.310]  Why is this so good?
[01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:12.835]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:26.488]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:23:26.548 --> 01:23:27.929]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:30.252]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:23:30.332 --> 01:23:32.835]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:23:32.915 --> 01:23:34.196]  These are all parasites.
[01:23:34.236 --> 01:23:35.338]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:36.399]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:23:36.699 --> 01:23:41.044]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:23:41.224 --> 01:23:44.408]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:23:44.448 --> 01:23:47.532]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:23:47.552 --> 01:23:48.593]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:23:48.633 --> 01:23:50.536]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:50.576 --> 01:23:51.597]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:23:51.617 --> 01:23:53.699]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.364]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:57.624 --> 01:23:59.507]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:23:59.887 --> 01:24:01.850]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:17.168]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:20.091]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:22.934]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:23.634 --> 01:24:26.037]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:24:26.597 --> 01:24:29.040]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:24:31.224 --> 01:24:39.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, Communist China holds the title for the most people ever killed by a government.
[01:25:01.058 --> 01:25:10.662]  According to the Communist Chinese themselves, Mao Zedong killed 84 million people during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[01:25:10.962 --> 01:25:13.383]  The CIA says it's 66 million.
[01:25:14.503 --> 01:25:22.746]  Then another 20 plus million are believed to have been actually executed or put into forced labor camps till they died.
[01:25:24.318 --> 01:25:29.402]  Another 10 million or so are thought to have just been starved to death since Mao went out of power.
[01:25:29.742 --> 01:25:30.623]  So you do the numbers.
[01:25:30.643 --> 01:25:35.007]  We're talking well over, any way you slice it, 100 million dead people.
[01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:40.631]  Back in the 60s and 70s, China would threaten the United States publicly.
[01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:45.455]  I remember my dad reading in the newspaper when I was like six years old, and they'd say, let us have a nuclear war.
[01:25:45.495 --> 01:25:46.476]  We got too many people.
[01:25:47.157 --> 01:25:52.181]  That's why they signed on with the Rockefellers and eugenics to have the one-child policy and kill almost all the baby girls.
[01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.971]  It's just 50 million, they're saying, just the last decade.
[01:25:58.352 --> 01:25:59.372]  Nobody knows the full number.
[01:25:59.392 --> 01:26:02.514]  Now there's one independent, Mal's Great Leap Forward.
[01:26:02.854 --> 01:26:05.855]  Just one of his projects killed 45 million in four years alone.
[01:26:07.136 --> 01:26:08.176]  Yeah, that's four years.
[01:26:08.657 --> 01:26:15.600]  He was in power from the 1930s to 1949 when he got full power over China, right through to when he died in the late 70s.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.681]  So, you think about that.
[01:26:17.701 --> 01:26:20.543]  45 million in four years, baby.
[01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:23.031]  So that's why they're so dangerous.
[01:26:23.071 --> 01:26:28.135]  And by the way, the Chinese will fight like the devil if you get in a war with them.
[01:26:29.376 --> 01:26:30.998]  The problem is they run out of food real quick.
[01:26:32.519 --> 01:26:42.007]  Now, North Korea is this horrible demon state, run for three generations by Chinese puppets, hereditary dictatorship, completely psychotic.
[01:26:42.507 --> 01:26:43.528]  They believe they're God.
[01:26:43.588 --> 01:26:46.030]  Kim Jong-un actually believes he's invincible.
[01:26:46.711 --> 01:26:48.192]  His father believed he was invincible.
[01:26:48.572 --> 01:26:50.554]  They are the essence of pathetic scumbags.
[01:26:52.632 --> 01:26:58.233]  And they look at the South, probably the richest country per capita in the world for technology, you name it.
[01:27:01.854 --> 01:27:03.754]  And they just get completely jealous and hateful.
[01:27:05.074 --> 01:27:10.935]  The elites of North Korea look at Japan and all its wealth and they get completely, absolutely hateful.
[01:27:12.396 --> 01:27:20.497]  And there's an anti-Japanese hatred because the Japanese obviously occupied Korea and killed a lot of people and forced labor to everybody.
[01:27:22.591 --> 01:27:26.094]  So there's a lot of ancestral and cultural beefs here.
[01:27:26.114 --> 01:27:26.774]  It's like a gang fight.
[01:27:26.794 --> 01:27:28.936]  It's like the Crips versus the Bloods, or whatever.
[01:27:29.276 --> 01:27:31.918]  I mean, the Hancocks versus the McCoys.
[01:27:32.899 --> 01:27:36.902]  This is lined up, and never since the July 27th, 1953,
[01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:42.731]  Ceasefire on the DMZ between the North and South.
[01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:46.773]  Has there ever been this much of a crisis?
[01:27:46.813 --> 01:28:02.183]  You have North Korea threatening when the Terror Task Force arrives in the next four days to launch a nuclear weapon into the South China Sea on board one of the missiles that they claim they can load an atomic warhead on.
[01:28:03.922 --> 01:28:18.691]  Now, they're telling the superpower with over 50,000 nuclear weapons, it's not 10,000, let me give you a newsflash, space-based weapons, particle beams, meteor guns with DU-SABOs, and that's the stuff that's leaked they've got, that's 1980s stuff.
[01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:29.337]  They're telling the most crazy elite on the planet, the Anglo-Americans, the ones GMOing everything, the ones, I mean, you know, just super sophisticated, breakaway civilization group,
[01:28:32.352 --> 01:28:33.272]  You've got this guy.
[01:28:33.313 --> 01:28:35.354]  They can't even produce automobiles in South Korea.
[01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:36.574]  They can barely feed themselves.
[01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:40.276]  But thanks to the Clintons and the globalists, they wanted this done as the trigger.
[01:28:40.736 --> 01:28:44.658]  In the 1990s, 95, 96, 97, they gave them the reactors to create the weapons.
[01:28:46.859 --> 01:28:55.244]  They are now threatening, and have been every week the last few months, launching a medium-range missile into the South China Sea with 900
[01:28:57.264 --> 01:28:57.664]  We're good to go.
[01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:27.498]  You have this crazy little fat guy, the essence of government worship.
[01:29:27.718 --> 01:29:31.179]  What a poster boy for big government and how it doesn't work.
[01:29:33.039 --> 01:29:34.380]  You've got him calling for all this.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.840]  I'm going to roll through it and go to your phone calls on the other side and look at how this could go down.
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.201]  But here's the headline.
[01:29:39.261 --> 01:29:43.302]  Trump orders military advisers to prepare plans to hit North Korea.
[01:29:45.462 --> 01:29:47.403]  And our media is making fun of South Korea panicking.
[01:29:50.283 --> 01:29:52.544]  The capital, Seoul, is only 30 miles from the border.
[01:29:53.703 --> 01:29:55.308]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.251 --> 01:29:58.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.707 --> 01:30:11.474]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:11.674 --> 01:30:18.100]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:26.567]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:30:26.827 --> 01:30:35.574]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:30:35.854 --> 01:30:41.578]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:30:41.918 --> 01:30:42.399]  It works.
[01:30:42.679 --> 01:30:50.986]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:30:51.146 --> 01:31:00.553]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:01.394]  A total 360 win.
[01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:10.142]  A North Korean dictator, fling-flang-flume, I mean Kim Jong Un, warns of a nuclear strike it provoked as U.S.
[01:31:10.202 --> 01:31:13.123]  warships are now approaching the Korean peninsula.
[01:31:13.223 --> 01:31:14.924]  So tensions are heating up right now.
[01:31:15.044 --> 01:31:20.026]  Little man's gonna decide to come out and pop off a few if he thinks that we're gonna come up there and do something.
[01:31:20.306 --> 01:31:21.847]  I actually think it's kind of funny.
[01:31:21.907 --> 01:31:27.852]  I don't think that North Korea has any possible chance whatsoever just to even get outside of their country.
[01:31:27.992 --> 01:31:32.916]  I think China might have to worry, or maybe South Korea, but I really don't think anything is going to get that far out of there.
[01:31:33.136 --> 01:31:38.540]  So I think we're doing okay, but either way, tensions are high, and they're warning of a nuclear strike if U.S.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.663]  aggression continues with the Navy moving towards them.
[01:31:41.923 --> 01:31:42.023]  U.S.
[01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:46.927]  President Donald Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its impoverished neighbor, said in a tweet.
[01:31:46.987 --> 01:31:48.708]  North Korea was looking for trouble.
[01:31:48.948 --> 01:31:49.729]  Our fellow InfoWarriors.
[01:32:04.958 --> 01:32:06.840]  Across the United States and across the planet.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.564]  Really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[01:32:12.545 --> 01:32:17.169]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[01:32:17.769 --> 01:32:21.353]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:32:21.753 --> 01:32:25.636]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[01:32:25.716 --> 01:32:28.699]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:30.220]  We now have George Soros.
[01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:32.061]  As a goblin.
[01:32:32.722 --> 01:32:36.383]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[01:32:36.723 --> 01:32:37.383]  No Soros.
[01:32:37.743 --> 01:32:38.504]  Him as a goblin.
[01:32:39.244 --> 01:32:43.625]  It says, Deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[01:32:45.866 --> 01:32:49.067]  So, it is a limited edition Deport Soros on the back.
[01:32:49.587 --> 01:32:50.768]  Hillary for President on the front.
[01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:52.949]  Right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[01:32:53.309 --> 01:32:53.869]  It's powerful.
[01:32:53.889 --> 01:32:54.929]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:32:55.209 --> 01:32:56.950]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:01.986 --> 01:33:06.510]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:10.294]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:33:10.314 --> 01:33:14.638]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:33:14.878 --> 01:33:17.320]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:20.303]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[01:33:36.271 --> 01:33:37.752]  But it wasn't because I didn't see enough.
[01:33:39.794 --> 01:33:40.655]  I knew too much.
[01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.058]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:47.120]  Yeah, it does for those that aren't informed.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.862]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:33:49.882 --> 01:34:03.254]  Does it make me crazy that I told you a month before anybody else did that it was in the Vault 7 that the CIA was spying on the American people and then staging cyber attacks on the American people?
[01:34:05.435 --> 01:34:06.576]  Of course I told you about that years ago.
[01:34:07.637 --> 01:34:15.162]  Does it make us crazy we told you that all evidence pointed towards a false flag last week with a nerve gas in Syria?
[01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.603]  Now everybody else is saying it?
[01:34:19.385 --> 01:34:21.226]  Putin waited five, six days.
[01:34:21.407 --> 01:34:22.668]  We told you minute one.
[01:34:22.688 --> 01:34:23.668]  Ha ha ha!
[01:34:23.708 --> 01:34:26.030]  Bless your soul!
[01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:30.093]  You think you're in control?
[01:34:34.897 --> 01:34:42.583]  We're not bragging here.
[01:34:43.484 --> 01:34:45.385]  We're telling you the reason we're under attack.
[01:34:46.106 --> 01:34:48.528]  Our information warfare is based in the truth.
[01:34:49.429 --> 01:34:50.469]  And it's on target.
[01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:53.412]  And so, we are your champion.
[01:34:54.673 --> 01:34:55.854]  Let me make something clear here.
[01:34:56.715 --> 01:34:57.775]  Why are we the champion?
[01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:00.377]  Because of you.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.864]  You are the people that support us, that spread the word, that give us the intel.
[01:35:06.666 --> 01:35:07.807]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:35:07.907 --> 01:35:09.489]  You're the reason InfoWars got built.
[01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.312]  So you are the champion.
[01:35:12.992 --> 01:35:13.513]  Think about that.
[01:35:21.618 --> 01:35:23.579]  Patrice, Dominic, Matthew and others.
[01:35:23.879 --> 01:35:33.122]  As soon as you hear somebody hang up, you can call triple, well that's the other number, you can call 800-259-9231.
[01:35:33.142 --> 01:35:33.302]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:33.322 --> 01:35:37.883]  We're teleprompter free, TV slash radio, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:35:37.943 --> 01:35:39.484]  So, let me just read these headlines.
[01:35:40.964 --> 01:35:46.566]  Trump orders military advisors to prepare plans to hit North Korea.
[01:35:49.212 --> 01:35:52.575]  Government tries to calm South Koreans' fear of imminent war.
[01:35:54.936 --> 01:35:57.138]  That only makes the public get more concerned.
[01:35:57.398 --> 01:36:04.423]  They're 30, it's actually 30 kilometers, that's like 22 miles or whatever, 23 miles, from the North Korean border.
[01:36:06.905 --> 01:36:08.867]  Think about how crazy that is.
[01:36:09.828 --> 01:36:16.933]  And they've got 100,000 pieces of artillery that Kim Jong-un claims, and our government says he has, pointed
[01:36:20.194 --> 01:36:22.415]  At Seoul to level it in a matter of hours.
[01:36:22.696 --> 01:36:24.897]  One of the most populous cities in the world.
[01:36:25.718 --> 01:36:27.419]  I forget how many people are in Seoul, South Korea.
[01:36:27.439 --> 01:36:28.359]  Can we look that up?
[01:36:28.439 --> 01:36:29.240]  It's like 8 million or something?
[01:36:30.721 --> 01:36:32.182]  Meanwhile, Reuters exclusive.
[01:36:32.242 --> 01:36:36.504]  North Korean ships head home after China orders coal return.
[01:36:36.564 --> 01:36:37.425]  This is good news.
[01:36:47.697 --> 01:36:50.040]  Now I'm told we have him on the phone right now.
[01:36:53.605 --> 01:36:54.426]  Sure, does he want to talk to me?
[01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.830]  Sure.
[01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:03.297]  Yeah, we already played Paul Watson's report.
[01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:05.020]  I want to go to these phone calls, but I need to do this too.
[01:37:06.826 --> 01:37:07.926]  Let me just get back to this for a moment.
[01:37:08.367 --> 01:37:13.048]  North Korean ships head home after China orders coal returned.
[01:37:13.689 --> 01:37:17.690]  A fleet of North Korean cargo ships is headed home to the port of Nampo.
[01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:24.993]  The majority of it fully laid net, but China ordered its trading companies to return coal to the isolated country following repeated missile tests.
[01:37:25.033 --> 01:37:30.615]  And it goes on to say this is China doing economic sanctions as they promised on North Korea saying
[01:37:31.315 --> 01:37:32.836]  Stop threatening to nuke Japan.
[01:37:33.456 --> 01:37:35.057]  Stop threatening to nuke South Korea.
[01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:36.578]  Stop threatening to nuke the fleet.
[01:37:36.678 --> 01:37:37.058]  Stop it.
[01:37:37.098 --> 01:37:38.719]  This is really good news.
[01:37:38.759 --> 01:37:43.781]  The problem is, the word is China doesn't completely control North Korea, and Kim Jong-un is crazy.
[01:37:44.582 --> 01:37:45.782]  He thinks Dennis Rodman's cool.
[01:37:45.802 --> 01:37:46.363]  What does that tell you?
[01:37:46.983 --> 01:37:49.864]  North Korea's state media warns of nuclear strike and provoked as U.S.
[01:37:49.904 --> 01:37:50.685]  warships approach.
[01:37:54.147 --> 01:37:56.828]  Buchanan asks, is Trump establishing the war party?
[01:37:58.134 --> 01:37:58.995]  We've got all that.
[01:37:59.015 --> 01:38:01.878]  I'm going to go right to your calls after we play this short report.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:05.521]  It's John Bowne.
[01:38:05.601 --> 01:38:07.883]  One of Assad didn't gas his own people.
[01:38:07.923 --> 01:38:10.886]  Well, I think you've got everybody in the world saying that that's the case.
[01:38:11.267 --> 01:38:17.313]  We've got all the evidence and the rest of it, but I'm going to play this John Bowne report, and I promise we won't even have guests next hour.
[01:38:17.633 --> 01:38:20.175]  I cleared the tables, cleared the decks today.
[01:38:20.616 --> 01:38:22.397]  We might have a special guest popping in, but we'll see.
[01:38:23.318 --> 01:38:31.710]  And we're going to play this John Bowne report, one of our great investigative journalists, and then we're going to come back and I promise go right to Dan, Russell, Patrice, Dominic, Matthew and others.
[01:38:32.351 --> 01:38:34.635]  But here is John Bowne's report.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:47.889]  The Pentagon released this map hours after 59 Tomahawk missiles were unleashed on the Syrian airbase where the chemical weapons-carrying plane had reportedly originated from.
[01:38:48.630 --> 01:39:02.300]  There is no doubt in our minds and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syrian regime under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad are responsible for this attack.
[01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:11.855]  And I think further, it is very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime.
[01:39:12.475 --> 01:39:16.718]  Russia is supposed to have removed all the chemical weapons from Syria.
[01:39:17.438 --> 01:39:23.802]  But obviously, that has not happened, as innocent Syrians continue to be murdered in chemical attacks.
[01:39:24.662 --> 01:39:27.684]  Let's think about the possible reasons for Russia's failure.
[01:39:28.883 --> 01:39:33.964]  It could be that Russia is knowingly allowing chemical weapons to remain in Syria.
[01:39:34.364 --> 01:39:42.026]  Now, officials are taking it one step further as they look into whether the Russians may have played a part in the chemical attack.
[01:39:42.246 --> 01:39:45.627]  The Boston Globe reports, on Friday, senior U.S.
[01:39:45.687 --> 01:39:50.468]  military officials said a drone belonging to either Russia or Syria
[01:39:50.728 --> 01:39:56.551]  ...was seen hovering over the site of the chemical weapons attack after the assault earlier this week.
[01:39:56.771 --> 01:40:12.018]  Of course, anyone paying attention to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime's opposition is leery of the Pentagon's evidence, especially since previous evidence points yet again to American ally Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:12.378 --> 01:40:19.603]  Foreign Policy Initiative reported as early as June 2012, the New York Times spoke with unnamed U.S.
[01:40:19.643 --> 01:40:30.770]  and Arab intelligence officials who said that Saudi Arabia, along with Turkey and Qatar, was paying for weapons being funneled through secret channels to Syrian rebel fighters.
[01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:42.278]  In February 2013, the Times reported sizable small arms shipments that Saudi Arabia financed and through third parties provided to anti-Assad fighters in Syria.
[01:40:42.398 --> 01:40:49.505]  We might not have much of a job here today, because I looked at the New York Times to find out, to get the explanation, and they said, worst chemical attack in years in Syria.
[01:40:49.565 --> 01:40:49.725]  U.S.
[01:40:50.106 --> 01:40:50.827]  blames Assad.
[01:41:05.581 --> 01:41:06.782]  It's all over and done with.
[01:41:07.282 --> 01:41:08.723]  But not quite so easy, is it?
[01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:10.704]  What happened four years ago in 2013?
[01:41:11.024 --> 01:41:16.726]  You know, this whole thing about crossing the red line.
[01:41:16.766 --> 01:41:20.848]  And ever since then, the neocons have been yelling and screaming.
[01:41:20.928 --> 01:41:28.232]  Even part of the administration is still yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gases on his people four years ago.
[01:41:28.632 --> 01:41:29.373]  Not quite true.
[01:41:29.533 --> 01:41:30.173]  Who would benefit?
[01:41:30.453 --> 01:41:37.538]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this and take no signs of this and you were just an analyst.
[01:41:38.078 --> 01:41:43.041]  It doesn't make any sense for Saud in these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[01:41:43.602 --> 01:41:49.766]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[01:42:03.176 --> 01:42:08.520]  We have a number of instances where ISIL has used chemical munitions on the battlefield.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:20.971]  In 2012, the Syrian government was warning that the rebels could resort to chemical attacks after al-Nusra stole 200 tons of toxic chlorine from a factory in Aleppo.
[01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:27.277]  In 2013, 12 members of al-Nusra were arrested with two cylinders of sarin gas.
[01:42:27.597 --> 01:42:33.320]  A lot of the reports are coming from the so-called White Helmets NGO, which is door-source funded.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.443]  It's receiving UK and US tax dollars.
[01:42:37.463 --> 01:42:45.808]  And they've been filmed carrying Al-Qaeda flags around, taking part in executions, hanging out.
[01:42:46.468 --> 01:42:57.256]  With the child beheaders of the Nur Al Zinki group, one of the rebel groups that the CIA vetted and gave weapons to, which ended up beheading a child.
[01:42:57.456 --> 01:43:07.343]  The White Helmets, as we now know very clearly, are the same individuals that are with Al-Qaeda, they just put on a white helmet and suddenly they're no longer Al-Qaeda.
[01:43:07.563 --> 01:43:09.464]  In 2014, the U.S.
[01:43:09.524 --> 01:43:15.326]  and Russia implemented an agreement to destroy the Syrian government's stockpile of chemical weapons.
[01:43:15.526 --> 01:43:22.389]  The BBC writes, the destruction of the arsenal began on 6th of October, overseen by the OPCW.
[01:43:23.089 --> 01:43:26.772]  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
[01:43:27.112 --> 01:43:37.739]  On the 31st of October, the International Watchdog confirmed that Syria's declared equipment for producing, mixing, and filling chemical weapons had been destroyed.
[01:43:37.939 --> 01:43:43.563]  The full-blown reality is the chemical weapons attacks in Syria aren't going to stop.
[01:43:43.943 --> 01:43:57.698]  Even if Assad is ousted, ignoring the well-known role of Saudi Arabian support for a network of anti-Assad rebels capable of stockpiling their own chemical weapons is equivalent to a dog chasing its tail.
[01:43:58.379 --> 01:44:01.082]  So, let's say we get Assad and they get regime change.
[01:44:01.162 --> 01:44:03.044]  Assad's gone and now there's going to be a new government.
[01:44:03.645 --> 01:44:04.546]  Who will that government be?
[01:44:05.366 --> 01:44:19.260]  One of the leaders of the Islamic Army, which was one of the many, many different groups fighting against Assad, trained in Damascus at a Wahhabist, radical Islamic, you know, preacher-infested university funded by the Saudis.
[01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:21.663]  Do we really think he was going to be better than Assad?
[01:44:22.203 --> 01:44:26.608]  There are two million Christians in Syria protected by Assad.
[01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:37.092]  In fact, the Christians that were in Iraq so hated the war and so hated the government that we helped institute upon them, they all fled and went to Syria.
[01:44:37.212 --> 01:44:41.014]  But now that you've got Donald Trump, they can kill two birds with one stone.
[01:44:41.874 --> 01:44:44.996]  One, if they can get Donald Trump to start World War III,
[01:44:45.996 --> 01:44:47.836]  Then they can blame him for it.
[01:44:48.497 --> 01:44:53.518]  And suddenly it's not a globalist puppet that has to take the blame, that has to get up on television and explain away this.
[01:44:53.858 --> 01:44:54.078]  Yes.
[01:44:54.318 --> 01:45:01.079]  They know that they can destroy Donald Trump and his entire supporters and label them as the people who started World War III.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:11.622]  John Bowne for Infowars.com And of course, as Vladimir Putin has said, as the British ambassador has said, and as I've said, and as Ron Paul said, and as everybody said,
[01:45:12.967 --> 01:45:17.930]  I said a month and a half ago when McCain went over there secretly and came back, I said, is he getting another fake chemical attack ready?
[01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:19.171]  They've had at least four.
[01:45:21.292 --> 01:45:23.214]  One that the UN totally confirmed happened.
[01:45:25.075 --> 01:45:26.816]  Others that the rebels admitted they did.
[01:45:27.617 --> 01:45:29.358]  What's going to stop them from staging more stuff?
[01:45:29.398 --> 01:45:30.578]  This only encourages it.
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:34.341]  This is all 101 game theory, folks.
[01:45:34.381 --> 01:45:35.302]  It's not even very hard.
[01:45:36.322 --> 01:45:38.844]  But being a critical thinker is called being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:45:39.889 --> 01:45:42.930]  We're gonna go to Russell, Dan, Patrice, Dominic, Matthew, and others right now.
[01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:44.450]  Russell from Alaska.
[01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:45.710]  Russell, thanks for calling.
[01:45:47.271 --> 01:45:47.751]  Hi, sir.
[01:45:48.511 --> 01:45:53.372]  Uh, just real quick, I wanted to say, this is more of a message towards the President himself.
[01:45:55.733 --> 01:46:00.614]  Over the years we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, I'm an Army veteran myself, I spent almost 12 years in the military.
[01:46:02.655 --> 01:46:05.655]  We lost almost 7,000 soldiers over there alone.
[01:46:07.016 --> 01:46:08.116]  That's not counting the guys
[01:46:08.976 --> 01:46:12.319]  That came home, but actually died over there already.
[01:46:12.759 --> 01:46:18.865]  That's right, from all the chemicals and the biologicals and the DU, not to mention 22 suicides a day?
[01:46:20.206 --> 01:46:20.726]  Exactly.
[01:46:21.647 --> 01:46:23.909]  And, for what?
[01:46:25.991 --> 01:46:26.391]  We left.
[01:46:27.412 --> 01:46:36.780]  Nothing changed over there, other than the fact that you have a radical Islamic terrorist over there that are killing people daily.
[01:46:39.045 --> 01:46:40.566]  We can't make the same mistake again.
[01:46:40.586 --> 01:46:49.011]  I just don't know how Trump goes along with a story that's obviously fake, and then we have the very Al-Qaeda people celebrating what he's done.
[01:46:49.031 --> 01:46:50.552]  And I don't want to criticize the President.
[01:46:50.852 --> 01:46:52.553]  He's doing good on a lot of domestic stuff.
[01:46:52.613 --> 01:46:54.674]  It's just that, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:46:55.054 --> 01:46:57.716]  Every veteran I know, everybody I know basically is against this.
[01:46:59.296 --> 01:47:00.537]  No, and sir, and I agree with you.
[01:47:00.617 --> 01:47:07.061]  I disagree with what he did, but he's still the President and I will support him and back him because I voted for him.
[01:47:08.391 --> 01:47:09.452]  Let me raise this next point.
[01:47:09.992 --> 01:47:13.655]  I've studied the Korean War, looked at it in depth, talked to all the experts.
[01:47:13.675 --> 01:47:17.557]  They agree, this is the biggest crisis ever since 1953 and the ceasefire.
[01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:19.278]  What do you make of this craziness?
[01:47:19.319 --> 01:47:22.421]  Because that's China and that's Korea starting all this.
[01:47:23.781 --> 01:47:25.422]  Yes sir, I did two tours in Korea.
[01:47:25.442 --> 01:47:26.203]  One in 2006 and one in 2009.
[01:47:26.323 --> 01:47:27.544]  And 2006 and both 2009, he launched rockets.
[01:47:28.604 --> 01:47:31.006]  I believe in 2006 he sank.
[01:47:36.882 --> 01:47:44.369]  Kim Jong-il, I believe it was, sank a Korean fishing boat, and in 2009, they mortared one of the islands off the South Korean shores.
[01:47:46.731 --> 01:47:47.692]  I don't know his son.
[01:47:48.273 --> 01:47:52.457]  I know that Kim Jong-il, he was a lot of flair, but I don't know his son.
[01:47:52.937 --> 01:47:55.379]  And, you know, it worries me because I still have friends there.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:59.984]  And I just don't know.
[01:48:00.592 --> 01:48:03.454]  Well listen, I mean, this will quickly escalate into nuclear war.
[01:48:03.834 --> 01:48:09.938]  Kim Jong-un's saying he will use the nukes he has and the missiles to hit the US fleet that's out there.
[01:48:09.998 --> 01:48:17.643]  Obviously we've got aircraft that can shoot those missiles down, but if he shoots a missile into the South China Sea near our ships, what is Trump supposed to do at that point?
[01:48:19.805 --> 01:48:21.866]  Well, at that point, he doesn't have a choice.
[01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:25.071]  So I tend to agree.
[01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:29.253]  I think Tillerson came out today and said, we don't want war with Syria.
[01:48:29.333 --> 01:48:30.414]  Al Qaeda is the main issue.
[01:48:30.434 --> 01:48:30.974]  ISIS.
[01:48:31.855 --> 01:48:34.257]  And I think that's going back to his campaign promises.
[01:48:34.277 --> 01:48:36.958]  So I think we're seeing some positive things out of Trump right now.
[01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:43.743]  And that's what I was told this weekend and on Monday by White House sources that are absolutely as close to Trump as you can get.
[01:48:45.063 --> 01:48:45.444]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:45.784 --> 01:48:51.988]  So like I said, the whole point I'm calling is we don't want another situation like Iraq and Afghanistan with Syria.
[01:48:52.751 --> 01:48:53.813]  We didn't make any ground there.
[01:48:53.833 --> 01:48:56.257]  We're not going to make any ground in Syria.
[01:48:56.638 --> 01:49:02.507]  North Korea, look, if they start it, I'm always one to say, if you're going to start it, I'm going to finish it.
[01:49:03.269 --> 01:49:05.813]  And if that's what has to happen, that's what has to happen.
[01:49:06.533 --> 01:49:10.275]  But I support our president, even if I don't agree with everything he does.
[01:49:10.515 --> 01:49:18.138]  Well, we better support him now, exactly, because we've got China and North Korea threatening war and just crazy behavior going on.
[01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:21.399]  So what's happening is our president's being tested.
[01:49:22.019 --> 01:49:23.780]  And folks, we're not in the position he's in.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:33.104]  If he was trying to put bad justices in, if he'd have put a bad justice in, a liberal justice, or if he wasn't trying to cut our taxes, or he wasn't getting all these factories to come back, I'd say he was a fake.
[01:49:33.464 --> 01:49:35.265]  He's doing so good on the domestic front.
[01:49:35.945 --> 01:49:43.547]  That I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt while I criticize issues I see with Syria, hoping he gets better advice.
[01:49:43.747 --> 01:49:44.567]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:49:45.867 --> 01:49:46.247]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:47.128 --> 01:49:47.928]  God bless you, Russell.
[01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:48.748]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:50.248 --> 01:49:53.449]  Yeah, it's a serious situation, to say the least.
[01:49:53.469 --> 01:49:54.589]  I mean, we don't want war with Russia.
[01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:58.850]  And Russia says more missiles get fired at their bases, their troops, they're going to respond.
[01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.631]  And the Russians tend to do what they say they're going to do.
[01:50:05.182 --> 01:50:08.184]  I could go to Matthew, Dominique, Patrice, and others, but I've got to go to break.
[01:50:08.204 --> 01:50:15.810]  When I come back, I'm going to talk to Dan in Indiana, and then we're going to talk to Patrice, Dominique, Matthew, and others right into the next hour.
[01:50:16.011 --> 01:50:17.472]  We may have some surprise guests today.
[01:50:17.512 --> 01:50:18.473]  We'll see what happens with that.
[01:50:18.873 --> 01:50:22.316]  There's an article up on Infowars.com that just went up by Jerome Corsi.
[01:50:23.436 --> 01:50:27.780]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, why AG Sessions must stop charges against Arpaio.
[01:50:30.492 --> 01:50:50.064]  Kangaroo court garbage against Arpaio, illegal spying on him, a guy doing his job, an admitted Obama-UN witch hunt, and they haven't even dropped the fake federal contempt charges that put him in jail for three years against Arpaio, former federal officer with no criminal record, and a great record.
[01:50:50.904 --> 01:50:51.805]  But it gets worse than that.
[01:50:53.134 --> 01:50:57.656]  They won't even get rid of the IRS chief that openly went after patriots and people for no reason.
[01:50:58.216 --> 01:51:07.359]  I mean, it's just because Trump has full meat meat against him.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:13.582]  Someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:51:14.028 --> 01:51:21.192]  This young generation, who scream words like fascist, have actually themselves become the fascists.
[01:51:21.472 --> 01:51:22.792]  You guys are the fascists!
[01:51:23.193 --> 01:51:24.593]  You're all the fascists!
[01:51:24.873 --> 01:51:26.114]  You're a white male!
[01:51:26.254 --> 01:51:33.558]  I just wish that somebody would create, like, some kind of a safe space where we could all just go and fucking hate!
[01:51:34.038 --> 01:51:39.000]  You're a fucking white man who gets to do whatever he wants to in this space, right?
[01:51:39.361 --> 01:51:40.321]  You need to get out.
[01:51:40.381 --> 01:51:41.522]  I actually don't.
[01:51:41.582 --> 01:51:41.922]  Alright.
[01:51:44.343 --> 01:51:47.485]  Get this reporter out of here!
[01:51:47.565 --> 01:51:49.805]  I need to bust him over here!
[01:51:49.826 --> 01:51:58.909]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:08.253]  So the question is, are social justice warriors mentally ill, or are they just stupid?
[01:52:08.593 --> 01:52:10.254]  When your emotions control your actions,
[01:52:11.290 --> 01:52:14.307]  It affects not only itself, but the people around you.
[01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:24.506]  There are over 7 million mentally ill and emotionally disturbed children in America.
[01:52:24.546 --> 01:52:26.307]  Get the f*** out of here!
[01:52:26.387 --> 01:52:28.189]  Get your phone away!
[01:52:28.369 --> 01:52:29.369]  Why?
[01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:30.450]  Quit recording!
[01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:33.692]  The madder he gets, the worse it becomes.
[01:52:33.732 --> 01:52:34.473]  Get the f*** away!
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.942]  You couldn't help interrupting, could you?
[01:52:48.362 --> 01:52:54.486]  You added nothing to that conversation.
[01:52:54.526 --> 01:52:57.549]  These are some of Tommy's drawings that the school sent over.
[01:52:58.649 --> 01:53:01.071]  There's an awful lot of hate in them.
[01:53:01.091 --> 01:53:03.933]  I am a nasty woman.
[01:53:12.848 --> 01:53:16.952]  Like your wet dreams infused with your own genes.
[01:53:17.012 --> 01:53:21.316]  But yeah, I'm a nasty woman.
[01:53:21.456 --> 01:53:27.661]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:53:27.761 --> 01:53:29.663]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.

[01:54:04.997 --> 01:54:11.422]  Okay, we have a surprise guest coming up at 8 after.
[01:54:12.603 --> 01:54:13.524]  I know our clock's weird.
[01:54:13.544 --> 01:54:20.810]  It's because I never wanted to do news and air mainstream news on the show, so I said, we'll let stations have their news, then we'll air our ads, and we'll come in at 8 after.
[01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:24.152]  I'm gonna change the clock soon, back to regular talk radio clocks.
[01:54:24.172 --> 01:54:26.674]  Gotta let the stations know about that and get that all set up.
[01:54:28.354 --> 01:54:33.936]  At eight after next hour, we have a very, very special guest joining us to break down what's currently happening in the world.
[01:54:35.096 --> 01:54:36.477]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:54:39.638 --> 01:54:42.758]  Let's talk to Matthew in California, you're on the air.
[01:54:42.778 --> 01:54:46.560]  Hey, Mr. Jones, how are you doing, sir?
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:50.601]  I'm telling you, I'm just thinking about my kids here, seeing how dangerous the world is.
[01:54:52.389 --> 01:54:55.231]  Yeah, you know, I totally understand.
[01:54:55.251 --> 01:54:57.393]  I'm going to jump to my punch really quick.
[01:54:57.513 --> 01:55:00.255]  I'm very disappointed with this whole Syria situation.
[01:55:00.855 --> 01:55:03.197]  Point number one, it's unconstitutional.
[01:55:03.237 --> 01:55:09.642]  It's one thing for him to, you know, just bomb one little facility because supposedly there's chemical weapons in there.
[01:55:09.882 --> 01:55:15.426]  But now I'm hearing that we got boots on the ground and with no approval from our Congress
[01:55:16.026 --> 01:55:20.929]  Which is a break on his promise not to get involved in international conflicts that have anything to do with us.
[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:29.835]  No, I agree, but he's been tricked into that and now, like I told you on Sunday and Monday, he's going to come out and say, I don't want war, I want the old deal, I want my old campaign.
[01:55:30.215 --> 01:55:33.317]  He was told we need ground forces to take out Al-Qaeda and ISIS, which is true.
[01:55:33.738 --> 01:55:36.639]  But now the Joint Chiefs are turning around saying, let's get rid of Assad.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:44.965]  Now Tillerson's come out to the old deal and said, no, we're not wanting to topple him, we want to get rid of Al-Qaeda and ISIS, then we'll get him to move towards doing that on his own.
[01:55:45.525 --> 01:55:46.986]  But I totally agree with you.
[01:55:47.686 --> 01:55:49.306]  Listen, here's how dumbed down the public is.
[01:55:49.787 --> 01:55:56.749]  The media is making fun of me saying there's not boots on the ground, even though I have thousands of articles the last two months admitting massive U.S.
[01:55:56.789 --> 01:55:58.830]  troops are moving in.
[01:55:58.870 --> 01:56:00.630]  Marines, artillery, army.
[01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:04.892]  All of it is moving into Syria and into western Iraq.
[01:56:04.932 --> 01:56:05.732]  So it's on.
[01:56:07.631 --> 01:56:09.372]  Well, who's he listening to with this stuff?
[01:56:09.392 --> 01:56:30.582]  Because I remember back when Obama was in, and he wasn't allowing our military to actually effectively go after ISIS in Syria, that our military was secretly or, you know, covertly giving information to the Russians so that they could actually go after them because our military knew that the Russians and the Assad regime were going after the ISIS in Syria.
[01:56:30.602 --> 01:56:32.043]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:56:32.643 --> 01:56:38.425]  Six years ago, our military told Obama, and then five years ago is when it came to a head, we're not going to back Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:56:38.705 --> 01:56:41.166]  They staged Benghazi to get weapons in there five years ago.
[01:56:41.646 --> 01:56:44.688]  That was all that our military finally woke up, said, no, we're not doing this.
[01:56:45.368 --> 01:56:50.230]  And then Trump comes in, and then the military starts trying to back out of its deal.
[01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:53.211]  And it's pretty much McMaster from what I've been told.
[01:56:53.231 --> 01:56:54.471]  A lot of folks are blaming Tillerson.
[01:56:54.791 --> 01:56:58.573]  Tell us, Rex Tillerson is the one that's backpedaling right now.
[01:56:58.613 --> 01:56:59.073]  What do you think?
[01:57:01.886 --> 01:57:07.130]  Well, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, basically one of two things.
[01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:10.333]  Is Donald Trump not paying attention to what's going on?
[01:57:10.353 --> 01:57:17.058]  Does he honestly believe that it was... Sir, he's ordered them to do all this stuff and the bureaucracy is ignoring him.
[01:57:17.419 --> 01:57:25.185]  And then he's hiring people that say they'll do what they say, and then they go on the news and say, we're going to take Assad out, and Trump says, I didn't say that.
[01:57:25.505 --> 01:57:27.947]  They come out the next day and say, Trump doesn't want that.
[01:57:28.387 --> 01:57:29.749]  They're doing what they want.
[01:57:29.769 --> 01:57:31.310]  There's a whole mutiny against Trump.
[01:57:32.708 --> 01:57:39.045]  Well, if he's the Commander-in-Chief and these are military people not following his orders, then can't he just remove them?
[01:57:40.955 --> 01:57:46.820]  He already had his first National Security Advisor that orchestrated this whole deal with Russia to not back Al-Qaeda removed.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.382]  Then three guys he asked said no.
[01:57:49.702 --> 01:57:50.863]  He was stuck with McMaster's.
[01:57:51.204 --> 01:57:57.149]  I'm not trying to demonize McMaster's, but he says radical Islam isn't Saudi Arabian and stuff like that.
[01:57:57.209 --> 01:57:59.491]  So I've got some serious issues with him, Matthew.
[01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:05.055]  Personally, Matthew, I'm just glad that all this stuff is getting de-escalated right now.
[01:58:05.936 --> 01:58:09.037]  Because China and North Korea are the big problem.
[01:58:09.757 --> 01:58:11.057]  That's what could end our world.
[01:58:11.337 --> 01:58:21.560]  You could wake up during a nuclear war, you could be driving down the highway, and hear emergency alert systems on the radio, and ten minutes later, ICBMs detonate at 2,000-foot airburst.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.000]  And then guess what?
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.860]  You're playing a harp, brother.
[01:58:26.521 --> 01:58:27.221]  Pushing daisies.
[01:58:28.439 --> 01:58:32.061]  And me being in San Diego, I'm definitely, trust me, I'm definitely... You are.
[01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:32.621]  You are.
[01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:35.062]  Big target is the main Pacific Navy's base there.
[01:58:35.522 --> 01:58:36.042]  You are right.
[01:58:36.102 --> 01:58:38.363]  So am I. Central Texas, Fort Hood, whoo!
[01:58:38.784 --> 01:58:40.924]  There's probably hundreds of nukes pointed at me right now.
[01:58:41.125 --> 01:58:41.685]  We'll be back.
[01:58:44.946 --> 01:58:48.108]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:48.148 --> 01:58:50.048]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.309 --> 01:58:55.811]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:58:57.618 --> 01:59:03.281]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:59:04.001 --> 01:59:07.963]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:59:08.843 --> 01:59:11.065]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:59:11.165 --> 01:59:12.325]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:59:12.985 --> 01:59:16.867]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:59:16.947 --> 01:59:18.908]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:59:19.388 --> 01:59:24.311]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:59:24.411 --> 01:59:26.172]  It's actually scary.
[01:59:27.072 --> 01:59:37.136]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:59:38.136 --> 01:59:50.961]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:59:54.969 --> 01:59:59.074]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.595 --> 02:00:00.936]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.542]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:00:05.662 --> 02:00:05.782]  Inc.
[02:00:05.822 --> 02:00:07.764]  NORAD has declared DEF CON 3.
[02:00:07.844 --> 02:00:09.146]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:00:09.647 --> 02:00:11.409]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:17.101]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[02:00:17.581 --> 02:00:19.062]  Target selection complete.
[02:00:19.102 --> 02:00:22.182]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[02:00:22.363 --> 02:00:27.884]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at North Cap, bearing 095 degrees.
[02:00:28.624 --> 02:00:33.906]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:40.367]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:00:40.447 --> 02:00:41.808]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[02:00:44.211 --> 02:00:46.473]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:00:46.493 --> 02:00:47.113]  You bet!
[02:00:47.614 --> 02:00:51.777]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:51.937 --> 02:00:54.879]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[02:00:54.899 --> 02:00:56.400]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[02:00:56.420 --> 02:01:00.043]  Shall we play a game?
[02:01:00.323 --> 02:01:01.664]  Call it out.
[02:01:08.343 --> 02:01:12.846]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:13.167 --> 02:01:15.188]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.309]  Awaiting launch codes.
[02:01:17.049 --> 02:01:18.230]  We are on a launch mode.
[02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:22.253]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[02:01:22.613 --> 02:01:26.536]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:01:26.976 --> 02:01:27.296]  We're in!
[02:01:28.477 --> 02:01:30.199]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[02:01:30.239 --> 02:01:32.400]  We have a Soviet submarine watch detection.
[02:01:32.781 --> 02:01:34.462]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[02:01:34.842 --> 02:01:41.067]  I wish I was like anybody else.
[02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:48.573]  There's a certain type of person like Adolf Hitler.
[02:01:50.353 --> 02:01:52.834]  That thinks they're invincible and wants to start big wars.
[02:01:53.434 --> 02:02:00.098]  And clearly, we've got some people in the neocon and top democratic echelons that just think they're invincible.
[02:02:00.918 --> 02:02:09.862]  And they want to dominate Russia, they want to dominate China, and there's other crazies like them on the other side, like North Korea, and they're the type of people that'll destroy our world.
[02:02:09.902 --> 02:02:13.184]  We have another big global war, it's going to be nuclear, and then we're all bye.
[02:02:14.465 --> 02:02:20.548]  And people say, oh, well, it hadn't happened, you know, since nuclear weapons proliferated by the 1950s, so it's not going to happen.
[02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:31.934]  You know, statistically, and they've got algorithms that show this, the bigger the population, the more they proliferate weapons.
[02:02:31.994 --> 02:02:33.055]  It's like my dad was born in 1950.
[02:02:34.796 --> 02:02:38.458]  Now, is there a lesser or higher chance he's going to have a heart attack or get cancer as he gets older?
[02:02:40.959 --> 02:02:42.380]  As he approaches 70 years old.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.861]  Same thing with my mother, born the same year.
[02:02:45.609 --> 02:02:47.950]  No, there's a bigger chance they'll get a heart attack or cancer.
[02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:48.670]  God forbid.
[02:02:49.951 --> 02:03:01.036]  Well, as you get more degenerate leaders, and more nuclear weapons, and more craziness, and more and more, and we don't have these nuclear wars, and there's no racial memory of losing 21 million Russians or 21 million Germans.
[02:03:01.337 --> 02:03:02.697]  Funny, both sides killed the same number.
[02:03:02.717 --> 02:03:06.279]  That's why Steve Pchenik said, quite frankly, America wasn't in World War II.
[02:03:06.639 --> 02:03:07.900]  Both my grandfathers were.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.701]  Both of them almost got killed.
[02:03:09.721 --> 02:03:14.583]  Yeah, it was real, but 600,000 dead Americans ain't 21 million dead Russians.
[02:03:17.079 --> 02:03:19.302]  The truth is, World War II was between the Russians and the Germans.
[02:03:20.604 --> 02:03:26.012]  We fought the Japanese, but they were a formidable adversary, but just different.
[02:03:27.213 --> 02:03:28.595]  Now, if you were going up Iwo Jima,
[02:03:30.009 --> 02:03:34.991]  If you were going up a hill and, you know, 10,000 Marines die going up one hill, damn right that's a war!
[02:03:35.491 --> 02:03:36.772]  I'm not lessening any of that.
[02:03:37.072 --> 02:03:37.932]  I almost don't exist.
[02:03:38.293 --> 02:03:41.534]  One grandfather, fighter pilot, crash landed and almost died.
[02:03:42.274 --> 02:03:48.317]  The other one flew his missions and then got heat stroke, thank God, because three missions later he went on the plane and blew up over Germany.
[02:03:48.337 --> 02:03:53.259]  But that isn't what traumatizing was being in Italy.
[02:03:54.099 --> 02:03:57.601]  They put him over supply stuff, see all the starving kids and everything else.
[02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:01.610]  He never went to restaurants and ordered food again.
[02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:03.191]  I remember when I was a little kid, he wouldn't order food.
[02:04:03.511 --> 02:04:04.651]  Everything people didn't eat, he ate it.
[02:04:05.951 --> 02:04:06.652]  Kind of a good system, though.
[02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:07.872]  He got a little piece of what everybody had.
[02:04:07.892 --> 02:04:11.113]  Because he saw starving children.
[02:04:13.033 --> 02:04:15.734]  But see, there aren't people alive right now that have seen the big wars.
[02:04:15.994 --> 02:04:17.114]  Yeah, our veterans have seen it.
[02:04:18.915 --> 02:04:27.037]  And every veteran I've talked to, including super right-wing people, super anti-Islamic folks, they say this Syria thing stinks bad.
[02:04:27.057 --> 02:04:28.517]  We need to stay out of it.
[02:04:29.548 --> 02:04:30.428]  We're on the wrong side.
[02:04:31.029 --> 02:04:31.849]  Obama started it.
[02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:33.530]  The neocons are for it.
[02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:35.251]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[02:04:35.271 --> 02:04:38.492]  We have a special guest joining us on the other side of this break.
[02:04:38.532 --> 02:04:40.033]  Kind of the man of the hour right now.
[02:04:40.894 --> 02:04:44.615]  And then we will continue with your phone calls throughout the transmission.
[02:04:44.896 --> 02:04:48.717]  And then Paul Joseph Watson joins us from Her Britannic Majesty's London.
[02:04:49.698 --> 02:04:51.599]  By the way, he's going to be here next week co-hosting with me.
[02:04:52.361 --> 02:04:52.902]  And David Knight.
[02:04:53.303 --> 02:04:54.104]  So that's all coming up.
[02:04:54.124 --> 02:04:54.745]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:54.785 --> 02:04:58.892]  Infowars.com is the most censored site on the internet because it's so accurate.
[02:04:58.932 --> 02:04:59.513]  Spread that link.
[02:05:12.182 --> 02:05:31.859]  Roger Stone has breaking bombshell news exclusive on Jared Kushner there in the White House, the son-in-law of President Trump, who is at the center basically of everything now, and his communications with Joe Scarborough, a Democratic Party operative,
[02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:35.662]  Conservative turncoat, basically, in my view.
[02:05:35.962 --> 02:05:38.264]  But here is those bombshell developments.
[02:05:38.584 --> 02:05:40.665]  Roger tells me it is just sensational.
[02:05:40.685 --> 02:05:41.306]  Please continue.
[02:05:41.386 --> 02:05:50.152]  Sources tell me that the president's son-in-law enjoys a very lively text exchange with Joe Scarborough.
[02:05:50.912 --> 02:06:05.017]  And Scarborough's repeated attacks on Steve Bannon, not to mention some of his attacks on the president, clearly are being manipulated by Jared Kushner for his own internal purposes.
[02:06:05.097 --> 02:06:16.882]  Now, again, any criticism that I have of the Trump administration or any member thereof, Kushner is one, are meant to be constructive, not destructive.
[02:06:17.552 --> 02:06:22.554]  But in this case, Joe Scarborough is no friend of the president.
[02:06:23.194 --> 02:06:26.115]  He revels in passing fake news.
[02:06:26.256 --> 02:06:27.896]  But this has not hit the news.
[02:06:27.936 --> 02:06:30.797]  This is breaking right now on InfoWars.
[02:06:31.578 --> 02:06:36.920]  And that is the back channel between the president's son-in-law and Joe Scarborough.
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:46.984]  First of all, let me say that anytime I level a criticism at the Trump administration or even rarely at the president himself, I do so out of loyalty to Donald Trump.
[02:06:47.644 --> 02:06:49.585]  And loyalty to his agenda.
[02:06:49.785 --> 02:06:53.786]  I want to help him beat back the globalists and make this country great again.
[02:06:54.506 --> 02:07:04.968]  That said, my political experience with Ronald Reagan, and before that, Nixon, tells me that a White House divided against itself cannot stand.
[02:07:05.508 --> 02:07:15.471]  And the internal squabbling between the establishment wing and the diminished true believers continues inside the White House.
[02:07:16.331 --> 02:07:30.040]  Yes, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, perhaps the one presidential aide who cannot be fired, is now in the regular text message communications with Joe Scarborough.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:38.445]  Many of the anti-Steve Bannon stories that you see, the themes that you see on Morning Joe are being dictated
[02:07:39.165 --> 02:07:40.926]  By Kushner.
[02:07:41.926 --> 02:07:50.449]  And while Mr. Kushner's plate is very full with Middle Eastern peace and the China visit and so on.
[02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:54.791]  In this case, I think he is disserving of the president.
[02:08:20.623 --> 02:08:26.726]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:27.127 --> 02:08:28.647]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.089 --> 02:08:34.471]  Well, Ron Paul has come out and said it was a false flag chemical attack.
[02:08:34.531 --> 02:08:40.014]  The former top British ambassador has come out and said that it was a false flag attack.
[02:08:40.074 --> 02:08:44.216]  Peter Ford, he said now the jihadis will launch more false flags and draw Trump in.
[02:08:45.919 --> 02:08:58.047]  Vladimir Putin has come out and said it, but it hasn't gotten any attention like Michael Savage, best-selling author, probably the number one or number two talk show host in the United States, coming on the broadcast right now exclusively.
[02:08:58.067 --> 02:09:02.090]  In about an hour, he hosts his own broadcast, despite the fact he's under the weather.
[02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:05.652]  His new best-selling book, Trump's War, warns on page 233.
[02:09:07.133 --> 02:09:13.117]  Trump's war against the deep state and he warns in the chapter, I read the book a month ago, of them trying to get him into war.
[02:09:13.257 --> 02:09:15.498]  So, that's why they call him Dr. Savage.
[02:09:15.518 --> 02:09:23.183]  I won't go into all his degrees, medical degrees, you name it, but exclusively joins us here, Zero Hedge, Drudge Report has it.
[02:09:23.923 --> 02:09:27.284]  Michael Savage turns on Trump, says Syrian gas attack was false flag.
[02:09:27.724 --> 02:09:29.224]  I don't think it's turning on Trump.
[02:09:29.344 --> 02:09:30.424]  It's warning Trump.
[02:09:30.764 --> 02:09:33.525]  Maybe I'm wrong, but CNN saying he's turned on Trump.
[02:09:33.965 --> 02:09:35.005]  I don't want to put words in his mouth.
[02:09:35.025 --> 02:09:42.106]  I haven't gotten his total view on this, but Dr. Savage of michaelsavage.com, am I wrong to say you haven't turned your desk?
[02:09:42.206 --> 02:09:46.247]  That's the vermin in the left trying to divide and conquer once again.
[02:09:46.287 --> 02:09:49.627]  It's the garbage of the world in the media.
[02:09:51.348 --> 02:09:51.628]  Absolutely.
[02:09:51.668 --> 02:09:52.028]  The trash.
[02:09:52.488 --> 02:09:52.948]  The filth.
[02:09:53.909 --> 02:09:54.369]  The sludge!
[02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:55.790]  I never turned on Trump.
[02:09:56.450 --> 02:09:58.790]  Now I don't know whether we can reach Trump, that's the problem.
[02:09:58.951 --> 02:10:00.031]  I don't know who he's listening to.
[02:10:00.071 --> 02:10:11.674]  Well I did talk to, let's just say, I did get what the President thought this week and I'll tell you later, I know you just had dinner with him a few weeks ago, but let's just, you've got the floor sir, so just roll this out, why you're so concerned.
[02:10:11.694 --> 02:10:13.955]  They're not the only ones who see this.
[02:10:13.975 --> 02:10:16.916]  Let's start with all the people you mentioned, but let's go the other way.
[02:10:16.936 --> 02:10:17.956]  Who is supporting this?
[02:10:18.729 --> 02:10:21.451]  The worst people on the planet are saluting Trump.
[02:10:21.752 --> 02:10:32.221]  Tariq Zachariah, Mr. Crazy Eyes, Lindsey Graham, the weirdest man in the history of the Senate, John McCain, the psycho when he speaks you can see insanity.
[02:10:33.002 --> 02:10:34.603]  They're all saluting Donald Trump.
[02:10:34.643 --> 02:10:36.785]  These are the people we hated before the election.
[02:10:37.449 --> 02:10:39.631]  These are the people who were rejected during the election.
[02:10:40.172 --> 02:10:50.041]  Now they're on Trump's side, along with the crypto pseudo-conservatives in the radio business who hold themselves up as great conservatives who are screaming for war?
[02:10:51.242 --> 02:10:52.863]  Alex, the world is upside down.
[02:10:53.804 --> 02:10:58.468]  If you can keep your head while all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, then you'll be a man my son.
[02:10:59.610 --> 02:11:03.193]  One of the greatest lines ever written, something I've carried with me since I'm 18 years old.
[02:11:04.301 --> 02:11:08.683]  If you can keep your head and all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, then you'll be a man, my son.
[02:11:09.104 --> 02:11:11.945]  Alex, we are being tested like we have never been tested before.
[02:11:13.186 --> 02:11:20.870]  I don't know how we've come out of this, because I don't know if Donald Trump is listening to a word anyone is saying to him, other than this inner cadre around him.
[02:11:21.570 --> 02:11:22.771]  Somebody has turned him.
[02:11:23.951 --> 02:11:25.512]  Now, let's look at the big picture.
[02:11:26.353 --> 02:11:32.516]  In a period of only one week, because of a few propaganda photos of a terrible tragedy,
[02:11:33.234 --> 02:11:40.998]  Conducted by we don't know whom, the president has now launched wars and threatened wars against three nations.
[02:11:41.799 --> 02:11:43.800]  China, Russia, North Korea.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.582]  But more than that, Alex, here's the strangest part of it all.
[02:11:48.543 --> 02:11:58.028]  For a smart man, why would he conduct these absurd, limp-wristed missile strikes while the Chinese guests are sitting with him at Mar-a-Lago?
[02:11:58.945 --> 02:12:00.766]  Does anyone not understand protocol?
[02:12:00.807 --> 02:12:02.368]  Do they not understand diplomacy?
[02:12:02.688 --> 02:12:06.931]  Do they understand that's probably one of the greatest breaches of diplomacy I've ever seen in my lifetime?
[02:12:07.812 --> 02:12:11.355]  This was like saying to the Chinese, hello, small, stupid men with shiny heads.
[02:12:12.336 --> 02:12:13.496]  Are you enjoying my meal?
[02:12:13.597 --> 02:12:15.898]  Well, F you, because I've just launched missiles.
[02:12:15.958 --> 02:12:17.219]  Now what do you have to say about it?
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:19.121]  What kind of presidency is this?
[02:12:20.342 --> 02:12:20.942]  I'll agree.
[02:12:20.962 --> 02:12:21.883]  I'll agree.
[02:12:21.903 --> 02:12:24.085]  It's very, very, very provocative.
[02:12:25.512 --> 02:12:28.393]  Well, you're being more diplomatic than I, which is saying an awful lot.
[02:12:28.433 --> 02:12:31.574]  Maybe it's because I have the flu and I have a fever and I'm not thinking clearly.
[02:12:31.594 --> 02:12:32.855]  No, you're thinking very clearly.
[02:12:32.915 --> 02:12:40.978]  In fact, every veteran I talk to, every person I talk to, I say 85% of the audience is absolutely freaked out about what's happening.
[02:12:40.998 --> 02:12:43.259]  And I'll tell you who, you know who he listens to.
[02:12:43.299 --> 02:12:44.579]  I'll tell you who Trump listens to.
[02:12:44.959 --> 02:12:46.540]  Late at night, they've taken his phone away.
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:48.762]  They only let negative stuff go on Twitter.
[02:12:48.802 --> 02:12:50.183]  He doesn't get any positive comments there.
[02:12:50.463 --> 02:12:51.404]  He would do feedback there.
[02:12:51.444 --> 02:12:52.625]  He listens to Michael Savage.
[02:12:53.045 --> 02:12:54.126]  He listens to InfoWars.
[02:12:54.186 --> 02:12:55.227]  He looks at Drudge Report.
[02:12:55.587 --> 02:12:57.409]  Probably more than us combined, let's just say it.
[02:12:57.849 --> 02:12:58.830]  So... Alex, hold on.
[02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:00.812]  How does he listen to me if I'm off of the air?
[02:13:02.535 --> 02:13:05.036]  He goes and finds clips on YouTube, I know for a fact.
[02:13:05.076 --> 02:13:09.259]  The point is, the point is, is that he does listen to you.
[02:13:09.619 --> 02:13:15.102]  I got a phone call this weekend from somebody, I'll just leave it at that, saying we're not going to do a no-fly zone, we're not going to have war.
[02:13:15.522 --> 02:13:17.563]  Rex Tillerson's going to come out and dial this back.
[02:13:17.863 --> 02:13:20.865]  Some people have been speaking on their own, and notice Tillerson's now done that.
[02:13:20.885 --> 02:13:23.166]  I said that Sunday, I said that Monday, it's now happened.
[02:13:23.186 --> 02:13:26.888]  I don't want to sit here and brag and try to sound big, but just, he is listening to you.
[02:13:26.908 --> 02:13:28.309]  So speak directly to the President, go ahead.
[02:13:29.298 --> 02:13:29.939]  Oh my God.
[02:13:30.579 --> 02:13:31.881]  Well hello, President Trump.
[02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:36.125]  You said I should live another 25 years when you put your arm around me at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:13:36.185 --> 02:13:40.048]  I hope you mean it because I can use another 25 minutes the way I feel.
[02:13:41.029 --> 02:13:42.010]  My feeling is this.
[02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:43.552]  Tillerson is misleading you.
[02:13:43.872 --> 02:13:46.654]  I have no idea why people don't see through that man.
[02:13:47.575 --> 02:13:52.340]  It seems to me that it's so plain that you don't have to be a genius to see what happened here.
[02:13:53.630 --> 02:13:59.314]  What does ExxonMobil gain if they cut Syria out of the gas lines that are running out of the Middle East to Europe?
[02:13:59.934 --> 02:14:02.216]  What does ExxonMobil gain by that, Alex?
[02:14:04.117 --> 02:14:05.638]  That's the whole story in a nutshell.
[02:14:05.938 --> 02:14:07.179]  It's another war for oil.
[02:14:07.759 --> 02:14:08.680]  It's all over again.
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:09.881]  It's the same thing as 1999.
[02:14:10.861 --> 02:14:15.244]  Remember when Bill Clinton was mercilessly bombing the Serbian people?
[02:14:15.444 --> 02:14:15.665]  Yes.
[02:14:16.365 --> 02:14:17.126]  For the Muslims.
[02:14:17.146 --> 02:14:20.468]  I read an article in 1999, the oily tracks run through Kosovo.
[02:14:20.628 --> 02:14:22.129]  It was a little-noticed article.
[02:14:23.251 --> 02:14:29.095]  My heart was broken because Bill Clinton engaged in 78 of the worst days of my life until now.
[02:14:29.856 --> 02:14:33.619]  Where Bill Clinton mercilessly bombed Serbia.
[02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:35.100]  He blew up hospitals.
[02:14:35.961 --> 02:14:37.662]  He blew up train stations.
[02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:39.723]  He blew up every bridge on the Danube River.
[02:14:40.344 --> 02:14:41.064]  For one reason.
[02:14:41.745 --> 02:14:44.347]  And that was to steal Kosovo from the Serbs.
[02:14:45.067 --> 02:14:48.150]  To permit an oil pipeline to run through Kosovo.
[02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:50.872]  What's even worse about that story is
[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.856]  The same exact elements that are now on the side of war were on the side of war then.
[02:14:56.637 --> 02:15:06.470]  And the same sane people and rational people who cared for the stability of the Earth, for the stability of their families, were against that insane act by Bill Clinton.
[02:15:07.407 --> 02:15:09.089]  I have not changed my position.
[02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:10.370]  It's the same exact thing.
[02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:20.958]  We cannot let crazed businessmen who put their bottom line ahead of the survival of the planet, and I'm talking about Rex Tillerson, to rule this nation.
[02:15:21.439 --> 02:15:23.000]  Did you vote for Rex Tillerson?
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:23.060]  No.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.342]  Was his name on the goddamn ballot?
[02:15:25.742 --> 02:15:25.922]  No.
[02:15:26.383 --> 02:15:28.344]  Did you ever hear of that Cro-Magnon?
[02:15:28.364 --> 02:15:29.225]  No.
[02:15:30.146 --> 02:15:31.567]  Who ever heard of that throwback?
[02:15:33.128 --> 02:15:33.969]  Where did he come from?
[02:15:35.433 --> 02:15:37.214]  Where the hell did that throwback come from?
[02:15:37.234 --> 02:15:38.335]  That lowbrow.
[02:15:38.375 --> 02:15:40.717]  Looks like he crawled out of a pit somewhere.
[02:15:40.737 --> 02:15:41.497]  Eddie Monster?
[02:15:42.858 --> 02:15:44.439]  We can say all the things we want.
[02:15:44.619 --> 02:15:46.881]  I did not elect him to the presidency.
[02:15:47.881 --> 02:15:49.342]  I didn't kill myself for a year.
[02:15:49.463 --> 02:15:51.124]  I have total faith in Donald Trump.
[02:15:51.584 --> 02:15:53.705]  And I'll repeat right now what I said to him.
[02:15:53.745 --> 02:15:56.067]  I would do anything for that man.
[02:15:56.287 --> 02:15:57.368]  I have total faith in him.
[02:15:58.075 --> 02:16:02.178]  But I don't understand how he cannot see through all the president's men.
[02:16:02.198 --> 02:16:03.579]  They're misleading him.
[02:16:03.599 --> 02:16:06.001]  They're taking him down a road he cannot come back from.
[02:16:06.021 --> 02:16:12.386]  Absolutely, that's what my... If he loses you and he loses me, tell me what happens next.
[02:16:12.406 --> 02:16:15.989]  They'll destroy him and he has to know that his base is upset, but let's expand on that.
[02:16:16.329 --> 02:16:19.771]  The British ambassador, I want to ask you this question, to Sirius said, listen,
[02:16:20.666 --> 02:16:21.746]  It's not that Assad's perfect.
[02:16:21.766 --> 02:16:23.227]  We're on the side of Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:16:23.247 --> 02:16:24.147]  They're celebrating this.
[02:16:24.447 --> 02:16:25.628]  They're going to stage more stuff.
[02:16:25.668 --> 02:16:27.188]  They got caught in 2013.
[02:16:27.448 --> 02:16:28.469]  They got caught last year.
[02:16:28.749 --> 02:16:29.549]  It's official!
[02:16:29.909 --> 02:16:30.909]  They videotaped it.
[02:16:30.929 --> 02:16:32.470]  These jihadis want to be rock stars.
[02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:35.351]  They videotaped launching the chemical attacks.
[02:16:35.651 --> 02:16:36.471]  It wasn't sarin.
[02:16:36.491 --> 02:16:37.372]  It was chlorine gas.
[02:16:37.392 --> 02:16:39.752]  Because the doctors are taking care of them without gloves.
[02:16:40.393 --> 02:16:42.233]  And Putin has come out and said it's a false flag.
[02:16:42.473 --> 02:16:43.854]  And he says more is planned.
[02:16:44.074 --> 02:16:47.435]  And that's what the British ambassador and Putin, who are smart, are saying is
[02:16:48.015 --> 02:16:48.916]  We don't want war.
[02:16:48.996 --> 02:16:50.197]  We want to de-escalate this.
[02:16:50.477 --> 02:17:05.930]  What are you going to do now, Trump, when the jihadis stage more stuff, this time in Aleppo or in the suburbs of Damascus, and then the right-wing, left-wing neocons, whatever you want to call them, rhinos, the warmongers like McCain and Graham, say, President, you've got to do something.
[02:17:05.970 --> 02:17:07.451]  They have painted him into a corner.
[02:17:08.937 --> 02:17:13.440]  What more do you need to know than the crazy eyes of himself?
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:17.303]  Let's look at the man with the craziest, most deceitful eyes in media.
[02:17:17.343 --> 02:17:17.763]  Zacharias.
[02:17:18.524 --> 02:17:21.425]  Zachariah, one of the sickest looking faces I've ever seen.
[02:17:21.465 --> 02:17:27.089]  If you were to create a puppet of deceit and hatred for America, it would be Fareed Zachariah.
[02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:28.110]  Yeah, Fareed Zachariah.
[02:17:28.130 --> 02:17:30.391]  Congratulating Donald Trump.
[02:17:30.772 --> 02:17:34.274]  Lindsey Graham, one of the most twisted sisters in the history of the Senate.
[02:17:34.734 --> 02:17:36.996]  A totally twisted Nancy.
[02:17:38.308 --> 02:17:40.449]  Is now encouraged by the Trump administration.
[02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:51.755]  John McCain, who looks like what he is, a totally sad, broken man, walking around like the puppet of the defense establishment, saluting him.
[02:17:51.955 --> 02:17:53.236]  And listen to this, Alex.
[02:17:53.716 --> 02:17:56.138]  Again, you don't have to be a genius to add up the pieces.
[02:17:57.238 --> 02:18:03.702]  All of the never-Trumpers, the Weekly Standard crowd, all the never-Trumpers are now saluting him.
[02:18:04.702 --> 02:18:05.883]  How is that possible?
[02:18:06.823 --> 02:18:07.644]  How did this happen?
[02:18:08.590 --> 02:18:10.851]  Who was advising our great president.
[02:18:10.971 --> 02:18:12.051]  I killed myself.
[02:18:12.711 --> 02:18:18.133]  I sacrificed my career to help the people go up, to help motivate the people.
[02:18:18.153 --> 02:18:24.475]  See, here's the thing is, I got people who sat out elections to go out and vote for him.
[02:18:24.495 --> 02:18:25.095]  I agree.
[02:18:25.595 --> 02:18:27.196]  That's the whole point, and so did you.
[02:18:27.836 --> 02:18:30.177]  These are the people who gave up on the system a long time ago.
[02:18:30.537 --> 02:18:31.657]  We saw an outsider.
[02:18:32.077 --> 02:18:33.938]  Why did I push so hard for Donald Trump?
[02:18:34.838 --> 02:18:40.085]  I defined it in one of my books by saying, life with Trump, death with Clinton.
[02:18:40.725 --> 02:18:43.369]  I said one thing alone amongst all.
[02:18:44.378 --> 02:18:47.559]  Is why I'm pushing for Trump, and that is we will not have a war with Russia.
[02:18:47.699 --> 02:18:51.480]  Well, I'll say this, Mr. Savage of michaelsavage.com and WorldNetDaily.
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:56.501]  Whatever happens here, you have children, Ingrid's children, I have children, we've proven we're moral.
[02:18:56.641 --> 02:19:13.526]  Look at the left, cheerleading and Pelosi, and all the usual suspects coming out, not just, you know, Fareed Zarkaria, not just George Soros, but all the usual suspects, the worst people, like Chuckie Schumer, and all of them are praising him.
[02:19:14.246 --> 02:19:16.148]  He's sitting there when they want to destroy him.
[02:19:16.228 --> 02:19:26.861]  He's delivered on jobs, delivered on the border, delivered on three trillion in the stock market, done all these great things, and then his enemies come out and say this and do this.
[02:19:27.121 --> 02:19:29.624]  And I know you don't want to get into it and talk about it, but I read your book.
[02:19:30.465 --> 02:19:30.945]  In full.
[02:19:30.965 --> 02:19:32.146]  I only read two chapters.
[02:19:32.266 --> 02:19:33.926]  I got the day before you came on a month ago.
[02:19:34.847 --> 02:19:36.387]  Trump's war against the deep state.
[02:19:36.467 --> 02:19:37.268]  You called it.
[02:19:37.288 --> 02:19:38.248]  I mean, it's true.
[02:19:38.628 --> 02:19:40.609]  You said it'll be them trying to start a war.
[02:19:40.949 --> 02:19:41.790]  Them trying to block him.
[02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:42.790]  That'll be his greatest test.
[02:19:42.810 --> 02:19:47.172]  That's the last chapter in your book, Trump's War, that everybody should read.
[02:19:47.592 --> 02:19:53.794]  Shame on the left, because if the left was really, you know, cared, they're criticizing you and I. I don't know if you know this.
[02:19:53.874 --> 02:19:55.155]  On CNN last night and today,
[02:19:56.715 --> 02:20:00.998]  You're actually attacking us that we don't want a war and saying we're a bunch of un-American crap.
[02:20:03.159 --> 02:20:04.540]  Well, let me say this to you.
[02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:08.423]  I have a chapter called Trump's War Against the War Machine in Trump's War.
[02:20:09.163 --> 02:20:11.305]  And I call myself not a man of war.
[02:20:12.286 --> 02:20:17.970]  And I describe the liberal warmongers, the neocons, the war profiteers, and I give a battle plan.
[02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:20.311]  I was afraid this day might come.
[02:20:21.712 --> 02:20:25.755]  But it takes a strong man to make peace and a weak man to make war.
[02:20:26.613 --> 02:20:31.457]  It is not a mark of strength to go to war, especially when our military is depleted.
[02:20:31.477 --> 02:20:32.418]  Now let's look at that.
[02:20:33.339 --> 02:20:34.960]  We all know the military is depleted.
[02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:36.341]  The President knows that.
[02:20:37.302 --> 02:20:41.265]  And now what, with threatening China and Russia and North Korea at once?
[02:20:42.546 --> 02:20:46.330]  When half our planes on aircraft carriers are inoperable?
[02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:49.252]  What in the hell is going on here?
[02:20:49.292 --> 02:20:50.413]  Who is leading here?
[02:20:51.073 --> 02:20:52.555]  Who is making these decisions?
[02:20:53.892 --> 02:20:57.193]  I want to say something on a strictly commercial level.
[02:20:57.693 --> 02:21:08.636]  My book, Trump's War, became number one on the New York Times bestseller list, Alex, with zero appearance on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, never mind all of the other channels.
[02:21:08.656 --> 02:21:09.896]  That shows the decline of their power.
[02:21:10.936 --> 02:21:16.598]  Not only the decline of their power, Alex, I went on your show, drudge-linked it, that was all I needed.
[02:21:17.338 --> 02:21:17.578]  Why?
[02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:19.817]  I don't need a new car.
[02:21:19.977 --> 02:21:21.518]  I'm not looking to buy a new car.
[02:21:22.178 --> 02:21:23.218]  I'm looking to save the nation.
[02:21:23.378 --> 02:21:24.318]  You want to change the world.
[02:21:24.578 --> 02:21:26.158]  You love your children, just like I do.
[02:21:26.178 --> 02:21:27.639]  It fundamentally pisses you off.
[02:21:27.699 --> 02:21:28.119]  Exactly.
[02:21:28.139 --> 02:21:28.819]  And what does that tell you?
[02:21:28.859 --> 02:21:29.579]  I go on Fox.
[02:21:30.059 --> 02:21:31.299]  They still had me on a few times.
[02:21:31.559 --> 02:21:32.760]  They wanted me to do a show and stuff.
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:33.760]  No response.
[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:34.720]  I go on your show.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:36.200]  You play a clip of my show.
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:37.520]  You have Paul Watson on.
[02:21:38.021 --> 02:21:39.901]  We get millions of people visiting the site.
[02:21:40.121 --> 02:21:42.141]  I know you get that with us, because we're the real media.
[02:21:42.161 --> 02:21:43.342]  And here's the problem, Dr. Savage.
[02:21:43.942 --> 02:21:45.562]  Google has banned us off Google Ads.
[02:21:45.982 --> 02:21:48.963]  David Brock is bragging that they've got all these people boycotting all our sponsors.
[02:21:48.983 --> 02:21:50.003]  We've lost almost all of them.
[02:21:50.263 --> 02:21:51.523]  We thank God we sell our own products.
[02:21:51.544 --> 02:21:53.204]  And I'm not bitching to the audience, but here's the deal.
[02:21:53.684 --> 02:21:58.165]  Just like your book on China got banned from distribution, we are under attack.
[02:21:58.205 --> 02:22:06.307]  Do folks know that we have the big audience, we're fighting, and the listeners need to know we're not the types to whine, but my God are we getting censored.
[02:22:07.948 --> 02:22:12.049]  Alex, again, talking commercially because a lot of people listening who don't know these things.
[02:22:13.075 --> 02:22:15.837]  The ratings just came out in streaming radio shows.
[02:22:15.917 --> 02:22:22.440]  My show is number one in the country, beating the great Rush Limbaugh by a huge number.
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.681]  On a bunch of platforms.
[02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:24.401]  Rush Limbaugh.
[02:22:25.422 --> 02:22:26.722]  Let's talk about him for a minute.
[02:22:27.103 --> 02:22:29.564]  How in the world does this man not understand what he sounds like?
[02:22:32.324 --> 02:22:32.984]  It's very sad.
[02:22:33.004 --> 02:22:35.685]  Well, I tuned in the other day and I thought he was saying he was against it.
[02:22:36.006 --> 02:22:37.406]  Then he said, oh, I'm playing Devil's Advocate.
[02:22:37.426 --> 02:22:38.727]  Then he did an hour for it.
[02:22:39.187 --> 02:22:40.768]  And I just, I just, I don't want to see him.
[02:22:40.788 --> 02:22:41.468]  Go ahead and sit.
[02:22:41.488 --> 02:22:42.528]  Let's not even talk about him.
[02:22:42.568 --> 02:22:46.410]  It's sad to watch a clown like that fall off the high wire.
[02:22:47.299 --> 02:22:50.242]  Alex, what are we going to do to get our message across to Donald Trump?
[02:22:50.262 --> 02:22:51.884]  Does he even care what we have to say?
[02:22:51.904 --> 02:22:53.725]  Let me tell you, he listens.
[02:22:54.226 --> 02:22:55.767]  The problem is... Why don't we ask him?
[02:22:55.807 --> 02:22:57.149]  If you have access, I don't.
[02:22:57.929 --> 02:23:00.912]  I live out in Nowhereville, way on the West Coast.
[02:23:01.273 --> 02:23:02.354]  No one cares what I think.
[02:23:03.334 --> 02:23:10.778]  I guarantee you if I tell Trump you want to meet him in Mar-a-Lago next weekend, quite frankly I was with a family trip in Hawaii.
[02:23:10.858 --> 02:23:11.859]  The media goes crazy with this.
[02:23:11.879 --> 02:23:13.140]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.580]  But let's just say I could have gone.
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:16.702]  I just literally was family and I couldn't do it.
[02:23:17.162 --> 02:23:21.324]  But believe me, sir, he absolutely loves you and you know that.
[02:23:21.344 --> 02:23:22.105]  You already had dinner with him.
[02:23:22.525 --> 02:23:26.147]  If you want to go visit Trump, I mean, you can snap your fingers.
[02:23:26.187 --> 02:23:27.928]  I'll make a phone call and it'll happen.
[02:23:28.408 --> 02:23:30.308]  Well, I don't want to snap fingers.
[02:23:30.328 --> 02:23:32.289]  No, I don't mean that arrogantly.
[02:23:32.329 --> 02:23:33.589]  I'm just saying he'd love to meet with you.
[02:23:34.189 --> 02:23:37.010]  I would love to visit him, not in Mar-a-Lago, but in the White House.
[02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:38.150]  That's what I would like to do.
[02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:40.270]  And I would fly across the country.
[02:23:40.791 --> 02:23:42.331]  I'm getting over the flu right now.
[02:23:42.411 --> 02:23:45.331]  I fought it off with my own nutrients, by the way.
[02:23:45.932 --> 02:23:47.592]  I haven't had the opportunity of taking yours.
[02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:49.872]  I'll tell you the truth, I could use some of that selenium right now.
[02:23:49.892 --> 02:23:50.653]  I'm pretty depleted.
[02:23:51.893 --> 02:23:54.313]  I feel like a depleted uranium shell.
[02:23:54.333 --> 02:23:55.574]  You've been working hard at 75.
[02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:57.574]  Depleted uranium shell, Alex.
[02:24:00.087 --> 02:24:05.930]  Uh, look, people think this is a joke and they think we do this just for effects or books.
[02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:08.952]  Alex, I know listening to your show that your heart's in it.
[02:24:09.572 --> 02:24:12.934]  And anyone listening to me knows that my heart is in this.
[02:24:13.214 --> 02:24:17.516]  I don't know how to rescue the president from his, from his advisors.
[02:24:17.616 --> 02:24:19.877]  Something went wrong and it happened last week.
[02:24:20.777 --> 02:24:27.581]  There must be some way to sit down with him and say, please, Mr. President, please, in your vast
[02:24:28.823 --> 02:24:29.324]  And that's key!
[02:24:45.839 --> 02:24:50.081]  We're not asking for anything but freedom, and not having war, and lower taxes.
[02:24:50.101 --> 02:24:55.864]  We're not the sycophants that tried to destroy him, that he's tried to co-opt by giving power, and instead they're beginning to co-opt him.
[02:24:55.944 --> 02:25:02.126]  In fact, that's a key point Dr. Savage, before we end this segment, I know you've got to go, is that he's just surrounded.
[02:25:02.187 --> 02:25:08.990]  They have all this national security stuff, they took his phone away, they did all this other stuff at Mount Liberty to get into, and he is...
[02:25:10.250 --> 02:25:16.735]  They took his cell phone away claiming it would be a violation of national security and I don't know why he let him do it because that's what he used to call me on.
[02:25:17.235 --> 02:25:19.556]  Now if he calls people up, Priebus is on the phone.
[02:25:19.837 --> 02:25:22.558]  When Trump calls you now, Priebus goes, this is Renz Priebus.
[02:25:22.999 --> 02:25:24.199]  Alex, will you talk to Trump?
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:25.740]  Or, Roger, it's Priebus.
[02:25:25.761 --> 02:25:26.181]  Will you talk?
[02:25:26.221 --> 02:25:29.303]  And then they sit there on the phone because he's the president.
[02:25:29.363 --> 02:25:32.125]  So, sir, we have to do this to make sure Russians aren't doing it.
[02:25:32.885 --> 02:25:36.307]  They even tried to keep me from the inauguration, telling Trump he's a Russian.
[02:25:36.728 --> 02:25:38.389]  They bully him with this.
[02:25:38.649 --> 02:25:41.771]  So I think he struck Syria so they stop saying the Russia thing.
[02:25:43.252 --> 02:25:50.337]  I can't go into what he did, but there's always a way out of something you do once you realize that it's not required to go down the road 100%.
[02:25:51.818 --> 02:25:52.978]  In other words, let's say it's done.
[02:25:53.038 --> 02:25:53.839]  What's done is done.
[02:25:53.859 --> 02:25:56.621]  For God's sake, stop beating the war drums.
[02:25:56.661 --> 02:25:58.042]  There are consequences to it.
[02:25:58.662 --> 02:25:59.523]  What I'm afraid of is...
[02:26:00.629 --> 02:26:05.392]  Alex, I could go on for another hour, which I will do when I'm on my own show, but World War II is very telling.
[02:26:06.112 --> 02:26:12.495]  We all hear that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, precipitously and without warning, that it was a sneak attack.
[02:26:13.596 --> 02:26:15.017]  People don't know the prelude to that.
[02:26:15.897 --> 02:26:18.239]  Japan had been starved for natural resources.
[02:26:18.259 --> 02:26:18.999]  Cutting off their oil.
[02:26:19.599 --> 02:26:20.620]  Cut off their oil.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.921]  Pushed them up against the wall.
[02:26:22.941 --> 02:26:24.382]  They had been our ally before that.
[02:26:25.189 --> 02:26:26.491]  Now what do we want to do now?
[02:26:26.571 --> 02:26:34.639]  Turn Russia into our greatest enemy once we hit them with more sanctions and cut off their revenue source from oil?
[02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:37.342]  Well, what do you think Russia's going to do, for God's sakes?
[02:26:38.888 --> 02:26:40.789]  That's why the left is so angry.
[02:26:40.809 --> 02:26:41.769]  They're now a Christian nation.
[02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:42.230]  I hate it.
[02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:48.452]  In closing, since you said it, you're an astute guy, obviously, Michael Savage, Dr. Michael Savage, michaelsavage.com, joining us.
[02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:49.713]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:26:50.053 --> 02:26:51.314]  What is it that happened last week?
[02:26:52.154 --> 02:26:54.855]  I know his daughter and others did come and put pressure on him.
[02:26:55.336 --> 02:26:57.717]  They said, you know, you've got to do this to show you're strong.
[02:26:58.537 --> 02:27:01.658]  I think Tillerson and others have kind of backed off the day off war drums.
[02:27:01.718 --> 02:27:04.440]  I think what you're saying and others are saying is having an effect.
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:06.901]  But what do you think it was happened a week ago, Dr. Savage?
[02:27:07.623 --> 02:27:08.864]  Oh goodness, you're asking me.
[02:27:08.984 --> 02:27:09.464]  I don't know.
[02:27:09.564 --> 02:27:10.364]  I wasn't there.
[02:27:10.785 --> 02:27:12.586]  The President is a good-hearted man.
[02:27:12.646 --> 02:27:13.506]  That's the problem.
[02:27:13.746 --> 02:27:16.428]  I'm a soft-hearted man and a good-hearted man.
[02:27:16.788 --> 02:27:22.491]  So you show me a picture of two babies or three babies who were dead, of course I'm going to have compassion for them.
[02:27:23.111 --> 02:27:26.893]  But now you connect it to someone who didn't do it, you might hit the wrong target.
[02:27:27.513 --> 02:27:33.016]  So before we act again, for God's sakes, let's look at the pictures all over again.
[02:27:33.076 --> 02:27:33.596]  Who did it?
[02:27:33.936 --> 02:27:34.917]  We don't know who done it.
[02:27:35.603 --> 02:27:38.885]  You know, I was the first one in the media to say it didn't look like sarin gas.
[02:27:39.005 --> 02:27:44.649]  I do have a PhD, by the way, partly in epidemiology from one of the great universities.
[02:27:45.373 --> 02:27:46.133]  A real doctorate.
[02:27:46.173 --> 02:27:49.235]  I'm the only one in the radio business who has any background in science.
[02:27:49.255 --> 02:27:49.515]  That's right.
[02:27:49.535 --> 02:27:50.015]  Speak to that.
[02:27:50.555 --> 02:27:53.397]  I don't have degrees like you do, medical degrees, but you're right.
[02:27:53.797 --> 02:27:59.659]  I mean, those things do come in handy when you're dealing with science illiterates in the media, who don't even put two and two together.
[02:27:59.679 --> 02:28:07.143]  I was the first one to say, for God's sakes, wait a minute, all of these people, the first responders, are there without gloves, some of them in sandals?
[02:28:07.703 --> 02:28:09.524]  And it's supposed to be a sarin gas attack?
[02:28:10.524 --> 02:28:11.905]  They would be dead within minutes.
[02:28:13.214 --> 02:28:13.935]  That's number one.
[02:28:13.975 --> 02:28:16.876]  Number two, it didn't look like it was sarin gas.
[02:28:16.916 --> 02:28:18.277]  It did not look like a nerve agent.
[02:28:18.357 --> 02:28:25.162]  It looked like a chlorine-based agent, which doesn't make it any less ugly, but that means the whole story is a lie.
[02:28:25.842 --> 02:28:30.005]  From top to bottom, one last point, and I know we both have to go.
[02:28:31.065 --> 02:28:35.348]  On my show today, I have both Pat Buchanan, who is brilliant, agrees with us.
[02:28:36.168 --> 02:28:41.632]  I also have another man who agrees with us, who was
[02:28:42.458 --> 02:28:42.878]  I heard of him.
[02:28:42.938 --> 02:28:45.920]  The fake anthrax reports.
[02:29:00.034 --> 02:29:00.454]  Thank you.
[02:29:00.494 --> 02:29:03.557]  Wilkerson says this is another repeat of Iraq all over again.
[02:29:03.577 --> 02:29:05.619]  The same exact story.
[02:29:05.639 --> 02:29:06.900]  I pray for Donald Trump.
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:07.420]  He's our only chance.
[02:29:24.022 --> 02:29:25.743]  It's why we all work so hard for him.
[02:29:26.443 --> 02:29:29.945]  I pray to God he understands that we're all fighting the same war as he is.
[02:29:30.625 --> 02:29:33.206]  But his greatest war right now is a war for the truth.
[02:29:33.866 --> 02:29:41.670]  And I hope to God if he hears this message, Alex, he will listen to Alex Jones and Michael Savage to stop the war before it gets worse.
[02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:42.470]  He is doing it.
[02:29:42.490 --> 02:29:46.332]  You're live in 30 minutes at michaelsavage.com and stations across the country.
[02:29:46.712 --> 02:29:47.952]  Michael, let me say bye to you in the break.
[02:29:47.972 --> 02:29:48.633]  I know you have the flu.
[02:29:48.673 --> 02:29:49.593]  Thank you for the exclusive.
[02:29:49.793 --> 02:29:50.974]  We'll be back with Call Straight Ahead.
[02:29:51.014 --> 02:29:51.414]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:55.238]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.181 --> 02:29:58.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.355 --> 02:30:05.696]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.937 --> 02:30:10.742]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:10.862 --> 02:30:14.125]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:14.386 --> 02:30:19.751]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:20.192 --> 02:30:25.898]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:30:26.198 --> 02:30:28.779]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:29.019 --> 02:30:34.122]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:34.382 --> 02:30:41.085]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:45.927]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[02:32:03.966 --> 02:32:07.207]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs, and today, Vladimir Putin says U.S.
[02:32:07.247 --> 02:32:13.589]  preparing to bomb Syrian capital and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[02:32:13.949 --> 02:32:16.810]  Sounds like someone's been watching MSNBC.
[02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:18.430]  Seriously, guys?
[02:32:18.650 --> 02:32:21.351]  We should be Putin, our differences, Assad!
[02:32:22.892 --> 02:32:25.672]  Either way, Vladimir Putin has sensationally claimed that the U.S.
[02:32:25.692 --> 02:32:31.014]  is preparing airstrikes on the Syrian capital and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[02:32:33.075 --> 02:32:33.576]  You hear that?
[02:32:33.636 --> 02:32:34.116]  That's right.
[02:32:34.256 --> 02:32:35.417]  Those are owls and crickets.
[02:32:35.658 --> 02:32:39.220]  Because the left doesn't have any more Russia, Russia, Russia!
[02:32:39.521 --> 02:32:44.645]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when tomahawk missiles hit Syria.
[02:32:45.405 --> 02:32:47.807]  The Russian leader made the astonishing claim that the U.S.
[02:32:47.847 --> 02:32:55.073]  is planning to fake chemical weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President, Sergio Mattarella.
[02:32:55.353 --> 02:32:58.676]  Well, you can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:59.036 --> 02:32:59.697]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[02:33:13.582 --> 02:33:17.484]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:17.945 --> 02:33:20.286]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.047 --> 02:33:25.129]  Is this some conspiracy?
[02:33:26.329 --> 02:33:28.731]  Crucified for no sin!
[02:33:29.711 --> 02:33:34.474]  Where is the pathetic evil warmongering left?
[02:33:44.508 --> 02:33:50.750]  As myself, Michael Savage, and others, Ron Paul, Drudge Report, to a certain extent, try to stop World War III.
[02:33:50.770 --> 02:33:54.192]  Not because we're heroes, we like our kids having a future.
[02:33:54.972 --> 02:33:57.113]  And you sit there and you call us warmongers.
[02:33:57.813 --> 02:34:00.054]  You call us racist and all this made-up crap.
[02:34:01.895 --> 02:34:03.075]  They call me anti-Semitic!
[02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:06.156]  In The Forward!
[02:34:08.517 --> 02:34:10.258]  And all these other big Jewish publications.
[02:34:13.599 --> 02:34:21.546]  Whenever I talk about George Soros being a Nazi collaborator, what's crazy is they even show clips of what I say in the article like I did something wrong.
[02:34:21.566 --> 02:34:23.247]  It's not because I'm against George Soros.
[02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:25.029]  It's because I'm not against Israel.
[02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:33.736]  It's like they think they have authority because of the New York Times, The Washington Post, or The Forward, or Vanity Fair, which is their mainstream media.
[02:34:34.256 --> 02:34:36.198]  That if they just say it, it is.
[02:34:37.728 --> 02:34:39.108]  I learned a long time ago with bullies.
[02:34:39.128 --> 02:34:41.389]  They'd sit there and punch me in the face and think I was gonna fall over.
[02:34:41.409 --> 02:34:42.629]  Well, I didn't fall over.
[02:34:42.649 --> 02:34:43.550]  They were like, you didn't fall over.
[02:34:43.570 --> 02:34:45.130]  I was like, no, and now you're gonna fall over.
[02:34:47.111 --> 02:34:53.612]  Truth is, I wish well on everybody, whether they're in Israel or Iran or Japan or Venezuela.
[02:34:55.913 --> 02:34:59.714]  When I see somebody falling down and somebody not doing well, I don't feel good.
[02:35:02.227 --> 02:35:07.530]  And I have a soft side that tends to get me then to sell out my own personal freedom to try to save somebody.
[02:35:08.191 --> 02:35:13.014]  But you learn you can't save a drowning person if they're trying to claw you under and push you down.
[02:35:13.034 --> 02:35:16.796]  When I was a little kid, we had a German Shepherd.
[02:35:16.816 --> 02:35:18.097]  He was a great dog named Nunk.
[02:35:18.197 --> 02:35:19.518]  Got hit by a car when I was a little kid.
[02:35:21.179 --> 02:35:23.641]  But you couldn't take that dog to the lake.
[02:35:27.844 --> 02:35:28.184]  In fact,
[02:35:30.014 --> 02:35:33.955]  You couldn't take him to a friend's house with a swimming pool because the dog was in the house.
[02:35:33.975 --> 02:35:38.517]  He'd bust down, you know, the screen door to get to you and would claw you thinking you were drowning.
[02:35:38.537 --> 02:35:42.178]  Kind of the reverse of someone trying to push you under when you save them.
[02:35:42.198 --> 02:35:43.298]  It was the other way around.
[02:35:44.598 --> 02:35:45.919]  And look, none of us are perfect.
[02:35:45.979 --> 02:35:47.659]  None of us have all the answers.
[02:35:47.719 --> 02:35:52.701]  But I just want prosperity and to see a future for humanity.
[02:35:55.462 --> 02:35:58.363]  And I see CNN going, oh, look at the alt-rights all upset.
[02:35:58.403 --> 02:35:59.563]  Trump's starting all these wars.
[02:36:01.977 --> 02:36:03.598]  How dare you not be for wars!
[02:36:03.778 --> 02:36:05.759]  And I'm just like, you people have no soul!
[02:36:06.439 --> 02:36:07.780]  You're corporate shills!
[02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:13.082]  Fox News is like the World War III channel right now.
[02:36:16.384 --> 02:36:18.545]  At least China and North Korea have threatened people.
[02:36:19.185 --> 02:36:28.790]  Syria didn't start this war, didn't do Jack Diddley's squad except be a place where Jews, Christians, and all sects of Muslims could live in peace and women went to college and could be doctors and
[02:36:30.834 --> 02:36:33.915]  I talked to all the ambassadors, the CIA people that have been there.
[02:36:37.896 --> 02:36:40.977]  They tell me after Jordan it's the best place in the Middle East other than Israel.
[02:36:41.237 --> 02:36:42.317]  We're having some basic freedom.
[02:36:45.318 --> 02:36:46.738]  People want to bash Israel all day.
[02:36:46.998 --> 02:36:57.521]  So I just weigh Israel like I weigh other countries and I go, okay, Israel is this tiny piece of land.
[02:36:58.905 --> 02:37:01.367]  And then Saudi Arabia has more wealth than any other country probably.
[02:37:02.388 --> 02:37:02.908]  For their elite.
[02:37:03.849 --> 02:37:05.650]  Not per capita wealth, but for their elite.
[02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:07.552]  Per capita wealth would be like South Korea.
[02:37:07.892 --> 02:37:09.413]  Overall wealth would be something like Switzerland.
[02:37:09.433 --> 02:37:11.435]  The United States after that.
[02:37:11.495 --> 02:37:19.501]  But for wealth of elites, I mean, Saudi Arabia is... They have like 30,000 princes or something.
[02:37:19.561 --> 02:37:21.082]  I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[02:37:22.483 --> 02:37:24.605]  And the average one is like 5 million dollars a year.
[02:37:24.665 --> 02:37:25.826]  The big ones get billions a year.
[02:37:27.549 --> 02:37:29.170]  Hundreds of princes get billions a year.
[02:37:29.991 --> 02:37:31.512]  Oh, you're a prince, here's billions of dollars.
[02:37:32.153 --> 02:37:36.136]  They've got whole cities, for whatever reason we don't know, that are air-conditioned.
[02:37:39.879 --> 02:37:42.401]  Big plastic tents that are like three-bedroom houses.
[02:37:43.022 --> 02:37:44.063]  They can house millions of people.
[02:37:44.823 --> 02:37:53.811]  And they don't take one refugee, and then they sit there and they lecture Israel how they should take, quote, Palestinians, and that just means Arabs getting out of their countries and going to Israel.
[02:37:58.148 --> 02:38:00.669]  It's not that I'm even against Israel or for Israel.
[02:38:00.689 --> 02:38:02.969]  I don't say that like I'm on some fence.
[02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:10.932]  I get to see the Jewish newspapers in Israel attack me all day and make crap up because I'm not anti-Israel like George Soros.
[02:38:10.972 --> 02:38:11.572]  I mean, I get it.
[02:38:11.952 --> 02:38:13.432]  I can't be allowed to have any credibility.
[02:38:13.492 --> 02:38:14.213]  I'm not George Soros.
[02:38:14.293 --> 02:38:15.073]  I mean, I understand.
[02:38:17.874 --> 02:38:23.855]  I just know Israel isn't running the world.
[02:38:24.616 --> 02:38:25.676]  The globalists are running the world.
[02:38:27.278 --> 02:38:34.380]  I just get so sick of the pseudo-intellectuals sitting back going, hey Alex, tell us how Israel runs your life, or the Vatican, or... Let me tell you what runs my life.
[02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:36.041]  My conscience runs my life.
[02:38:38.022 --> 02:38:46.064]  My conscience is so strong that even though some things probably aren't good for my family, I do the right thing no matter what's going on.
[02:38:46.964 --> 02:38:48.925]  And that's not because I'm some wonderful person.
[02:38:49.305 --> 02:38:52.426]  I've got an operating system that I'm not a dirtbag psychopath.
[02:38:53.287 --> 02:38:54.467]  And when I do things that aren't
[02:38:55.868 --> 02:38:59.490]  Perfectly right, but I want to do because of the flesh, I'm guilty for that.
[02:38:59.510 --> 02:39:16.902]  And I don't want to talk about myself all day, but you know, when you're being attacked in a hundred plus newspapers a day, every day, sometimes a thousand newspapers, sometimes 5,000, sometimes every paper in the country, they're so controlled.
[02:39:17.202 --> 02:39:23.667]  And every, every major NBC, ABC, CBS, NBC affiliate will attack me and lie about me.
[02:39:23.707 --> 02:39:25.588]  And I've got to sit there and I got to take it.
[02:39:26.934 --> 02:39:33.658]  I got to take weak minded people on the street that don't know that's a lie and I got to sit there and watch them disdain me and hate me.
[02:39:35.519 --> 02:39:38.181]  And it doesn't hurt me when they're hating me because of my ego.
[02:39:39.301 --> 02:39:40.542]  It hurts me because they're deceived.
[02:39:43.324 --> 02:39:46.846]  And I think about what it'd be like to be them because they're slaves.
[02:39:50.868 --> 02:39:51.789]  You know how I get over it?
[02:39:54.890 --> 02:40:00.152]  Austin, Texas is a big site of homeless people, because the city doesn't run them off.
[02:40:01.593 --> 02:40:06.875]  And they've gotten rid of the mental institutions the last 20, 30 years, so there's schizophrenics and people all over the streets.
[02:40:07.855 --> 02:40:15.838]  And almost every major four-way stop in downtown Austin, but way out, 20 miles outside the city, has got schizophrenics begging for money.
[02:40:17.279 --> 02:40:20.200]  And they're so whacked out of their brain half the time, they're not even asking for money.
[02:40:21.536 --> 02:40:26.117]  I don't give money to the con artists that are out there, but I see somebody missing their legs or whatever, a diabetic.
[02:40:26.157 --> 02:40:27.997]  I give them some money, but I see those schizophrenics.
[02:40:29.998 --> 02:40:31.458]  They're having arguments with themselves.
[02:40:31.498 --> 02:40:33.519]  They're talking to the wind.
[02:40:33.539 --> 02:40:45.081]  And I realize, here I am conscious, aware of geopolitical systems.
[02:40:46.377 --> 02:40:48.498]  Tied into things probably nobody else is.
[02:40:48.758 --> 02:40:50.018]  Very few, let's just put it to you that way.
[02:40:50.318 --> 02:40:51.459]  Not on a power trip to say that.
[02:40:52.119 --> 02:40:54.140]  But because I followed this path this far down.
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:03.763]  And then every now, the deeper I go, the connections, the discernment, the trust I have with people only intensifies.
[02:41:08.905 --> 02:41:09.665]  Now look at the public.
[02:41:11.209 --> 02:41:13.330]  And they're like mentally ill schizophrenics talking to themselves.
[02:41:14.091 --> 02:41:17.193]  Somebody makes fun of me in a restaurant or comes over and knocks my drink over with my family.
[02:41:17.213 --> 02:41:19.494]  Or somebody slaps me in the back of the head.
[02:41:19.514 --> 02:41:21.336]  I'm at the beach with my kids.
[02:41:22.136 --> 02:41:24.598]  Says, hey racist, I ought to beat your ass, you Trump supporter.
[02:41:26.979 --> 02:41:32.463]  I cannot get up now and take them down because I realize they're a victim.
[02:41:34.664 --> 02:41:35.945]  And I don't take any pleasure in that.
[02:41:38.226 --> 02:41:38.847]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:41:41.988 --> 02:41:44.489]  Before we go to Dominique and everybody else has been holding like patriots.
[02:41:46.690 --> 02:41:52.612]  I realized something that is fundamental to our species and this planet and this great experiment we're part of.
[02:41:55.693 --> 02:42:08.057]  If the species is destroyed through war, genetic engineering, natural disaster, everything our species did before us, everything our ancestors did to survive is destroyed.
[02:42:08.717 --> 02:42:10.098]  And so for me, we're in a
[02:42:12.074 --> 02:42:16.396]  Long-term war for humanity to escape the planet.
[02:42:17.217 --> 02:42:18.277]  Planet's beautiful, I love it.
[02:42:18.917 --> 02:42:22.399]  Just like I loved my mommy when I was six years old.
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:28.302]  When I was about six years old, she kicked me off her lap and said, you can't be a mama's boy now.
[02:42:28.942 --> 02:42:30.843]  You don't get any more love because you're gonna be a man.
[02:42:36.246 --> 02:42:37.126]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:42:40.388 --> 02:42:41.268]  We're gonna leave this planet.
[02:42:43.663 --> 02:42:44.123]  We're meant to.
[02:42:47.384 --> 02:42:51.265]  And our destiny is right there in our hands right now.
[02:42:52.865 --> 02:42:53.545]  The whole future.
[02:42:54.186 --> 02:42:54.646]  Unlimited.
[02:42:56.066 --> 02:42:59.187]  Humans cannot even imagine what is in store for us.
[02:43:01.207 --> 02:43:12.470]  Our progeny will look back and we're successful on us as the heroes that laid the cornerstone for everything we do after this that is unlimited.
[02:43:13.686 --> 02:43:15.227]  We have to escape this test.
[02:43:18.450 --> 02:43:23.454]  If we destroy ourselves, there'll be other tests.
[02:43:28.058 --> 02:43:35.484]  But people like Lindsey Graham, people like John McCain, they want temporal power now!
[02:43:36.425 --> 02:43:37.506]  They want control!
[02:43:37.966 --> 02:43:40.629]  They want to show the planet they're in charge!
[02:43:41.877 --> 02:43:45.098]  Instead of chivalry and honor and building something true.
[02:43:45.598 --> 02:43:51.919]  Not because others won't stab you in the back, but because you're going to trailblaze the path to the future.
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:03.762]  You look at China, you look at North Korea, you look at the things that are happening, and you can see how much danger this planet is in.
[02:44:13.769 --> 02:44:19.432]  That's why I get guilty when I get angry or say things tongue-in-cheek or my dog dies.
[02:44:20.492 --> 02:44:22.293]  My dog had just died the night before.
[02:44:24.034 --> 02:44:26.376]  Blood pouring out his nose and mouth.
[02:44:26.396 --> 02:44:27.656]  I'm not complaining.
[02:44:27.676 --> 02:44:28.417]  I'm telling the story.
[02:44:28.837 --> 02:44:30.177]  My dog had just died the night before.
[02:44:30.197 --> 02:44:32.479]  I've been up all night long, burying the next day at my parents.
[02:44:32.759 --> 02:44:33.559]  They were on vacation.
[02:44:33.579 --> 02:44:35.380]  It was their dog that used to be my dog, staying with me.
[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:36.721]  Blood was pouring out.
[02:44:36.741 --> 02:44:37.281]  He was dying.
[02:44:37.301 --> 02:44:40.323]  He chased the cat around for hours, playing, had a heart attack, died.
[02:44:41.003 --> 02:44:42.624]  Aneurysm, whatever it was, blood was coming out.
[02:44:46.989 --> 02:44:49.771]  I shouldn't have gone to work that day, and I shouldn't have been up that night.
[02:44:49.791 --> 02:44:51.152]  The tireder I am, the more I work.
[02:44:51.772 --> 02:44:55.715]  At like 11 o'clock at night, saying, you call me a Russian agent, I'll punch you in the nose and all this stuff.
[02:44:56.215 --> 02:44:58.097]  That was me just sad about my dog.
[02:44:58.117 --> 02:45:02.139]  Because the truth is, somebody calling me stuff I'm not doesn't even really make me that mad.
[02:45:10.065 --> 02:45:11.686]  But the reason I get at all this is that
[02:45:16.479 --> 02:45:20.242]  There's a very good chance we're going to destroy ourselves.
[02:45:20.603 --> 02:45:25.166]  There's a very good chance we're going to have a nuclear winter and that six billion people are going to die.
[02:45:27.609 --> 02:45:32.833]  And I guess the meek in the South Pacific, if the war isn't too intense, might live.
[02:45:33.393 --> 02:45:36.796]  They'll have radiation poisoning, deformities, but they're going to survive.
[02:45:37.577 --> 02:45:38.898]  So I guess the meek will inherit the earth.
[02:45:39.499 --> 02:45:42.041]  And I guess like the Bible says, you know, two-thirds of the planet will be killed.
[02:45:46.383 --> 02:45:53.948]  And I'm just a little guilty that I don't have a strong enough flesh to convince my family to leave.
[02:45:56.369 --> 02:46:03.393]  But here I am, just a normal guy who believes in humanity, a throwback, trying to stop nuclear war like Michael Savage.
[02:46:05.975 --> 02:46:07.516]  Because we like going to restaurants, we know.
[02:46:07.576 --> 02:46:09.537]  We like going out on boats in the water.
[02:46:09.557 --> 02:46:11.098]  And we like seeing our kids.
[02:46:11.138 --> 02:46:12.199]  And we like having friends.
[02:46:12.239 --> 02:46:14.020]  And we just, we don't want to kill the Russians.
[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:15.020]  We don't want to kill the Chinese.
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:15.681]  We don't want to do anything.
[02:46:23.871 --> 02:46:31.178]  And then we look at those that are seeking power who never even had power.
[02:46:32.539 --> 02:46:36.483]  They're like functionaries in a big blind beast.
[02:46:37.998 --> 02:47:05.240]  A corporate, hungry, seeking creature, directed by millions of souls that are unconscious, just looking for salvation and believing if they dive down some rat hole into hell, they might find absolution and nirvana or Valhalla, and all they'll find is a twilight of the gods, which is the end of humanity.
[02:47:08.558 --> 02:47:09.538]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:47:09.558 --> 02:47:11.179]  I'm going to make this very brief.
[02:47:11.299 --> 02:47:20.183]  If you want to see us grow in the face of enemy attacks, I mean, there we are, you know, on the stage, in the arena, under attack, water filtration systems 40% off.
[02:47:20.203 --> 02:47:20.903]  We've never done that.
[02:47:23.044 --> 02:47:25.906]  X2, super good halogen out there running out 25% off.
[02:47:27.418 --> 02:47:31.499]  Other products, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:32.099 --> 02:47:33.979]  Just support us and we'll build, we'll move forward.
[02:47:34.479 --> 02:47:38.700]  We got the children's toothpaste, it's fluoride-free with the iodine and everything.
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:40.801]  The silver, it's all there, it's excellent.
[02:47:41.261 --> 02:47:42.101]  The pink, super blue.
[02:47:42.941 --> 02:47:44.461]  Infowarslife.com, 888-253-3139.
[02:47:44.521 --> 02:47:50.083]  But I want to apologize to Dominique for holding so long.
[02:47:50.823 --> 02:47:52.163]  So, you're on the air, Dominique, go ahead.
[02:47:54.113 --> 02:47:55.875]  Thank you so much, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:47:56.515 --> 02:47:59.398]  I just want to say, Denise and I, thanks for that sale.
[02:48:00.099 --> 02:48:04.103]  And also the bubblegum toothpaste.
[02:48:04.143 --> 02:48:04.804]  I can't believe them.
[02:48:05.004 --> 02:48:06.606]  Both of my kids absolutely love it.
[02:48:07.286 --> 02:48:10.730]  And we're going to definitely become consistent customers with that.
[02:48:12.178 --> 02:48:18.162]  Right now, I believe that we're at a fork in the road with President Trump.
[02:48:18.803 --> 02:48:21.285]  And, you know, he's done a lot of great things, like you've said.
[02:48:22.326 --> 02:48:27.650]  The best thing that I've seen him do is, you know, the takedown of the Peto Gate.
[02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:29.671]  And we need to stay on that topic.
[02:48:29.952 --> 02:48:32.454]  That's an amazing thing.
[02:48:32.494 --> 02:48:33.294]  Let's think about Trump.
[02:48:33.354 --> 02:48:37.197]  He won't brag about military operations, Peto Gate, anything he does.
[02:48:38.414 --> 02:48:41.397]  Uh, he'll say silly things like, oh, what a great crowd, what great ratings, but he won't.
[02:48:41.697 --> 02:48:42.397]  He really is.
[02:48:42.658 --> 02:48:43.478]  That's the paradox.
[02:48:43.518 --> 02:48:44.239]  What do you say about that?
[02:48:44.499 --> 02:48:49.063]  He's doing so good domestically, so good on our jobs, that I can't believe he's done so good.
[02:48:49.423 --> 02:48:53.466]  And then, on the other side, now this war.
[02:48:53.526 --> 02:48:54.487]  I mean, I just, what do you think?
[02:48:56.238 --> 02:49:15.255]  That's what's strange, is that he's doing so many great things domestically, but I think that if he continues with this war, if he continues and then puts troops on the ground and then starts an actual war with them, where there's more Syrian lives lost, you know, our
[02:49:16.161 --> 02:49:19.482]  A mutual enemy is ISIS and Al-Qaeda in that area.
[02:49:19.642 --> 02:49:21.202]  So we should be, we should be helping them.
[02:49:21.242 --> 02:49:23.682]  That's right, Syria didn't start the war, Saudi Arabia did.
[02:49:24.063 --> 02:49:32.444]  I'll be, I'm not a warmonger, but if Trump, I woke up and he launched strikes on Riyadh, taking out the royals, I mean I would just be like, you know what, it's the right thing to do.
[02:49:32.744 --> 02:49:38.865]  We shouldn't be doing it, but I mean, I want to, I mean, but no, we're going to take out the regime that's tolerant, that didn't start a war.
[02:49:40.186 --> 02:49:42.006]  Yeah, they're, you know, they're, they're
[02:49:42.935 --> 02:49:48.722]  They protect Christians over there, one of the only countries in the Middle East, Muslim countries in the Middle East that do that.
[02:49:48.743 --> 02:49:50.725]  Well you know why, they're Crypto-Christians.
[02:49:52.027 --> 02:49:55.071]  More than half the population, they're Crypto-Christians bro, that's why the elite one is gone.
[02:49:55.531 --> 02:49:58.074]  They're Crypto-Christians, they all secretly go pray at churches.
[02:49:58.375 --> 02:49:59.837]  Assad's a Christian, that's why they hate him.
[02:50:01.601 --> 02:50:02.222]  It's ridiculous.
[02:50:02.262 --> 02:50:10.848]  But, you know, I was thinking, we were talking last night with a friend of mine online, and he was, he said, you know, oh, I think that Trump's being blackmailed.
[02:50:11.228 --> 02:50:14.691]  And I said, yeah, but he was talking about some kind of, you know, prostitution thing.
[02:50:14.751 --> 02:50:16.332]  I said, come on, man, really?
[02:50:16.352 --> 02:50:17.714]  Trump and prostitution?
[02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:22.157]  No, it's probably... He's being blackmailed with his people.
[02:50:22.357 --> 02:50:23.038]  I'm gonna hold you over.
[02:50:23.058 --> 02:50:23.318]  Stay there.
[02:50:23.338 --> 02:50:24.279]  I want to hear what you think.
[02:50:24.299 --> 02:50:24.599]  Stay there.
[02:50:25.359 --> 02:50:29.563]  It's Trump being blackmailed with normal activity of his advisors.
[02:50:30.953 --> 02:50:32.695]  But they're going to spin it that they're all Russians.
[02:50:32.755 --> 02:50:35.697]  That's what they've got as communications with the Russians when he was president-elect.
[02:50:36.198 --> 02:50:37.439]  That's what he's being blackmailed with.
[02:50:37.679 --> 02:50:39.561]  So he's told, Mr. President, hit this.
[02:50:39.581 --> 02:50:40.662]  They agreed to get rid of the chemicals.
[02:50:40.702 --> 02:50:41.122]  They didn't.
[02:50:41.402 --> 02:50:41.663]  Hit it.
[02:50:41.683 --> 02:50:43.985]  You look strong ahead of your meeting with China.
[02:50:44.345 --> 02:50:45.026]  He went with that.
[02:50:45.446 --> 02:50:47.848]  As long as he stays there, he's fine, which he's now signaling.
[02:50:47.888 --> 02:50:48.649]  That's the good news.
[02:50:49.089 --> 02:50:50.570]  I'm going to come back to Dominic, I promise.
[02:50:50.871 --> 02:50:51.812]  Patrice, you're up next.
[02:50:52.713 --> 02:50:55.036]  Then Hans, then Matt, then Jason in Germany.
[02:50:55.056 --> 02:50:56.599]  I'm going to do five minutes to the next hour.
[02:50:56.619 --> 02:50:59.363]  Then Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[02:50:59.524 --> 02:51:01.146]  Coming up, the War Horse.
[02:51:09.256 --> 02:51:14.418]  You've been so on target over the years in your books I've read, both novels and classified stuff, and both non-novels.
[02:51:14.718 --> 02:51:15.539]  Makes my head spin.
[02:51:15.559 --> 02:51:17.339]  I respect you more as the years go on.
[02:51:17.439 --> 02:51:18.580]  So, where should we start?
[02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:28.404]  You have the real liberals, and then nationalists, and then you've got Republican establishment, Democratic establishment, elites, European elites, all wanting this global system, trying to prop it up.
[02:51:28.584 --> 02:51:29.404]  Who are the players?
[02:51:29.464 --> 02:51:30.285]  Where are we right now?
[02:51:31.045 --> 02:51:35.748]  Well, Alex, the ruling elite's long-time agenda has been to destroy the United States and the West from within.
[02:51:36.108 --> 02:51:57.260]  And in reaction to last year's growing anti-globalist movement represented by the Brexit vote, and also anti-establishment Trump election, the elite is becoming desperately aggressive right now, fighting for absolute domination and population control, insidiously wiping out unstable domestic conditions throughout the Western world, engineered to explore racial class,
[02:51:57.700 --> 02:52:02.507]  Religious and also politically charged civil war violence in both America and Europe.
[02:52:02.948 --> 02:52:12.803]  Which is seen in the United States, we have seen in Europe, in Spain, in Italy, in France, in England, in Germany, in other countries as well, in Portugal and also in Greece.
[02:52:13.483 --> 02:52:21.749]  In the United States, this takes the form of mass deployment of a robotically dumbed-down, highly manipulated, yet well-organized political left.
[02:52:21.809 --> 02:52:28.153]  And again, we've seen this, you know, with the flake movements in the United States right after the Trump election, you know, constituting the elites.
[02:52:28.633 --> 02:52:39.161]  Workers of mass destruction against Trump's reactionary or militarized authoritarian federal forces, soon spilling blood and chaos as America's very own spring uprising.
[02:52:39.241 --> 02:52:55.192]  You know Alex, the chaos once almost exclusively limited to the Middle East, that we've become so accustomed to watching on television, is slowly but surely carrying over to the United States and also to Russia as we saw today, one PSYOP Gladio B operational stage event at a time.
[02:52:56.105 --> 02:52:59.288]  No longer is chaos something happening thousands of miles away.
[02:52:59.308 --> 02:53:00.629]  It's happening right here in America.
[02:53:00.649 --> 02:53:02.871]  It's happening in Russia, in my hometown.
[02:53:03.251 --> 02:53:20.306]  And honestly, you know, I keep saying chaos because unlike Operation Gladio, which occurred throughout Europe, mostly from the 1960s to the early 1980s, 1990s, sorry, the current so-called Operation Gladio B, which again, you know, we can call Northwest... Instead of being purely staged, they bring in people that will do it.
[02:53:20.726 --> 02:53:21.968]  Well, it's much more sophisticated.
[02:53:21.988 --> 02:53:32.883]  You have Gladio being like Gladio A. He's being conducted in an era of mass psychological terror and deception made possible by technology, legalized propaganda, fake terror groups like ISIS.
[02:53:33.083 --> 02:53:33.584]  Amazing.
[02:53:33.664 --> 02:53:34.245]  A ban, Daniel.
[02:53:34.265 --> 02:53:34.866]  He moves so quickly.
[02:53:34.886 --> 02:53:35.867]  It's all so on target.
[02:53:35.907 --> 02:53:37.329]  Why do they hate Russia so much?
[02:53:37.810 --> 02:53:41.991]  I mean Russia, I know you're a Russia expert, I've never been there, I just study it.
[02:53:42.431 --> 02:53:45.732]  They're not expanding, they're trying to build their country, they have good policies for their people.
[02:53:46.212 --> 02:53:48.453]  Why are the elites so out to get Russia?
[02:53:48.533 --> 02:53:49.533]  I just, it's crazy!
[02:53:49.653 --> 02:53:53.735]  Russia is the only alternative to the military superpower that is the United States.
[02:53:53.995 --> 02:53:58.176]  So again, until you can destroy Russia, you will not have your one world, whatever you want to call it.
[02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:04.631]  I apologize for being here late.
[02:55:04.771 --> 02:55:08.333]  I'm working on breaking news as we speak.
[02:55:09.734 --> 02:55:12.075]  I'm gonna get to all the callers before Paul Watson comes on.
[02:55:12.095 --> 02:55:13.836]  He's gonna be here next week with us in studio.
[02:55:13.896 --> 02:55:14.797]  Really look forward to that.
[02:55:17.421 --> 02:55:19.162]  Wow, I don't even know how I'm supposed to go off air, though.
[02:55:19.182 --> 02:55:20.023]  There's so much happening.
[02:55:20.063 --> 02:55:20.784]  I want to go to your calls.
[02:55:20.884 --> 02:55:26.248]  Fireballs spotted off California coast during unusual Navy anti-sub patrol.
[02:55:26.688 --> 02:55:37.777]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to our article that shows the anti-submarine planes that are never seen out there right off the SEAL team base there in San Diego.
[02:55:38.657 --> 02:55:44.942]  We've got reports of that, the planes flying around, the anti-submarine aircraft.
[02:55:44.962 --> 02:55:45.342]  Here it is.
[02:55:46.523 --> 02:55:50.227]  And then now you've got these fireballs that clearly looks like a test missile.
[02:55:50.287 --> 02:55:54.532]  I mean, that isn't a test missile or dummy missile going into the coastline there.
[02:55:54.592 --> 02:55:55.172]  Nothing is.
[02:55:55.753 --> 02:55:58.095]  So we've got North Korea testing and openly threatening Japan.
[02:55:58.115 --> 02:55:59.377]  Now we've got China.
[02:55:59.397 --> 02:56:02.480]  In fact, I've asked Kit to add the test like five, six years ago.
[02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:03.801]  Remember that big off the coast?
[02:56:03.861 --> 02:56:06.284]  It was a Chinese missile test from a submarine.
[02:56:07.682 --> 02:56:10.844]  Unusual Navy Patrol Sparks Fear of Foreign Sub Off California Coast.
[02:56:11.305 --> 02:56:15.848]  InfoWars.com Fireball Spotted Off California Coast During Unusual Navy Anti-Sub Patrol.
[02:56:16.148 --> 02:56:22.473]  Let's go to the InfoWars.com article because I asked him to add the old photo of the daytime launch that went on right in the same spot.
[02:56:22.934 --> 02:56:33.702]  So if that isn't a test of an ICBM, that's an intercontinental ballistic missile, of a sea-launched missile that can either be into the atmosphere and back in or not going into the stratosphere.
[02:56:34.122 --> 02:56:37.927]  We're going to be breaking all that down here today, obviously, in the next hour.
[02:56:37.947 --> 02:56:40.530]  That's a Kit Daniel story on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:41.311 --> 02:56:42.493]  Dominic, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:56:42.513 --> 02:56:43.013]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:44.435 --> 02:56:46.237]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:56:46.397 --> 02:56:52.245]  One other quick thing I wanted to let you guys know that on Chrome, on Google Chrome, I usually tune into InfoWars on
[02:56:53.013 --> 02:56:54.775]  Sure, that might be a bug.
[02:57:10.990 --> 02:57:11.831]  They're blocking us.
[02:57:12.151 --> 02:57:13.412]  They admit they're blocking us.
[02:57:13.452 --> 02:57:16.094]  They admit they're not showing us in search results.
[02:57:16.455 --> 02:57:17.856]  They're not letting our articles get out.
[02:57:17.896 --> 02:57:20.018]  They're blocking us from advertising.
[02:57:20.038 --> 02:57:25.642]  But they can't stop you sharing the leaks with friends, family, neighbors via your emails.
[02:57:25.702 --> 02:57:26.523]  That's the key, brother.
[02:57:27.964 --> 02:57:28.405]  Absolutely.
[02:57:28.465 --> 02:57:29.886]  I'm going to do that.
[02:57:30.386 --> 02:57:33.208]  One thing that I definitely think that he's got to do is get rid of Kushner.
[02:57:33.229 --> 02:57:34.089]  That guy's got to go.
[02:57:34.750 --> 02:57:35.831]  He just looks evil.
[02:57:35.851 --> 02:57:36.872]  I mean, you look at the guy.
[02:57:37.836 --> 02:57:57.411]  He looks sinister, he definitely has another agenda, but with all these appointments like McMaster's, and now they're talking about Valerie Jarrett, and then lessening Bannon's influence, because Bannon was put in there to keep the campaign promises, and now
[02:57:58.012 --> 02:58:03.594]  You know, we're hearing things that he's, you know, giving him less and less strength every day.
[02:58:03.814 --> 02:58:05.695]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:58:05.795 --> 02:58:06.835]  Dominique, God bless you.
[02:58:06.875 --> 02:58:07.395]  Great point.
[02:58:07.775 --> 02:58:10.756]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to go directly to Patrice.
[02:58:11.177 --> 02:58:12.137]  Please stay there, Patrice.
[02:58:12.157 --> 02:58:14.278]  70 seconds, I'm going to write to you.
[02:58:14.678 --> 02:58:15.678]  Then Jason in Germany.
[02:58:16.478 --> 02:58:17.599]  Hans, Matt, everybody.
[02:58:17.619 --> 02:58:19.299]  I'm going to go to all your calls for Paul Watson.
[02:58:19.699 --> 02:58:20.820]  Comes on, whatever it takes.
[02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:27.284]  Briefly, we are offering the Nomad Pro Pure Water Filter at 40% off Gravity Fit Filter.
[02:58:27.564 --> 02:58:29.545]  We've never gone to 40% off.
[02:58:29.585 --> 02:58:31.306]  I don't know why they're doing it.
[02:58:31.326 --> 02:58:32.047]  It's a loss leader.
[02:58:32.107 --> 02:58:32.867]  It's $129.
[02:58:32.947 --> 02:58:33.688]  Amazing system.
[02:58:33.968 --> 02:58:34.769]  Cuts out all the garbage.
[02:58:34.789 --> 02:58:36.169]  Stainless steel sits on your tabletop.
[02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:37.270]  This is a loss leader.
[02:58:37.570 --> 02:58:39.151]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:39.211 --> 02:58:40.913]  Please support the broadcast.
[02:58:40.953 --> 02:58:42.213]  We are the tip of the spear.
[02:58:42.834 --> 02:58:44.215]  Thanks for your prayers, your support.
[02:58:44.315 --> 02:58:45.956]  So, we're all in this together.
[02:58:45.976 --> 02:58:46.436]  Stay with us.
[02:58:46.456 --> 02:58:47.517]  Hour number four coming up.
[02:58:48.217 --> 02:58:48.798]  Spread the link.
[02:58:49.158 --> 02:58:50.519]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:53.490 --> 02:59:02.497]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:02.577 --> 02:59:10.804]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:10.984 --> 02:59:15.668]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:15.848 --> 02:59:22.570]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:29.732]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:29.812 --> 02:59:36.694]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:36.834 --> 02:59:41.195]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.315 --> 02:59:44.536]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:44.716 --> 02:59:50.864]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:51.004 --> 02:59:53.227]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.588 --> 03:00:00.516]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.776 --> 03:00:08.956]  All right, fourth hour started.
[03:00:08.996 --> 03:00:09.997]  Paul Watson coming up.
[03:00:10.037 --> 03:00:11.297]  I want to write to your phone calls.
[03:00:11.397 --> 03:00:12.337]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.637 --> 03:00:14.098]  Patrice in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:00:14.118 --> 03:00:14.678]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:16.298 --> 03:00:16.638]  Hello.
[03:00:17.239 --> 03:00:17.859]  Welcome, Patrice.
[03:00:20.479 --> 03:00:25.381]  I think what's going on is Satan is running the world.
[03:00:27.941 --> 03:00:33.423]  Satan is making sure that everything is going crazy.
[03:00:33.894 --> 03:00:38.297]  Yeah, notice the Islamists, Communist China, everything's turning against Trump in America.
[03:00:38.317 --> 03:00:39.398]  Definitely.
[03:00:41.339 --> 03:00:51.586]  And why do you think Satanists all got together and prayed against Donald Trump?
[03:00:51.846 --> 03:00:53.167]  Anybody remember that?
[03:00:54.588 --> 03:00:57.250]  I mean, the big Hollywood people, the rock stars, they did it a bunch.
[03:00:57.530 --> 03:01:01.513]  They prayed for his death, they prayed for war, they prayed because they're liberal and trendy.
[03:01:01.573 --> 03:01:01.973]  Exactly.
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:03.481]  Right.
[03:01:03.702 --> 03:01:09.497]  So we all need to pray for Donald Trump to have the Holy Spirit give him
[03:01:12.044 --> 03:01:15.565]  You know, I told my family this morning, I said, let's pray for America.
[03:01:15.585 --> 03:01:16.305]  Let's pray for the world.
[03:01:16.325 --> 03:01:17.085]  Let's pray for Trump.
[03:01:17.385 --> 03:01:18.206]  Let's pray for peace.
[03:01:18.246 --> 03:01:19.846]  We prayed at like 7 a.m.
[03:01:19.866 --> 03:01:22.267]  in the morning over breakfast, and I meant to come on air.
[03:01:22.327 --> 03:01:24.728]  Thank God you called, Patrice.
[03:01:24.988 --> 03:01:33.430]  Patrice, you lead us in prayer for a minute or so for world peace and for Trump to be enlightened and for the power of the devil to be broken.
[03:01:33.450 --> 03:01:33.750]  Go ahead.
[03:01:34.991 --> 03:01:39.172]  How about our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[03:01:39.813 --> 03:01:43.997]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[03:01:44.618 --> 03:01:55.848]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
[03:01:56.228 --> 03:01:56.569]  Amen.
[03:01:57.776 --> 03:01:58.417]  That's powerful.
[03:01:58.737 --> 03:02:00.778]  Can we get Melania Trump coming in the next segment?
[03:02:00.798 --> 03:02:07.944]  I think we should come in after intro and play her the Lord's Prayer because that shows what they've been through and that's why they hate Trump.
[03:02:07.984 --> 03:02:13.209]  Yeah, my gut tells me Trump's good and I know I'm not, I mean I know I'm right about that.
[03:02:13.829 --> 03:02:18.412]  It's just that imagine what he's under, the deception, the enemy's activity.
[03:02:18.472 --> 03:02:20.613]  I can't even get into what I've been behind the scenes.
[03:02:20.633 --> 03:02:23.876]  It's been amazing, the stuff they've pulled against me the last four years.
[03:02:24.736 --> 03:02:26.017]  But it's definitely intensified.
[03:02:26.057 --> 03:02:27.998]  Patrice, thank you so much for calling.
[03:02:28.018 --> 03:02:29.119]  We really appreciate you.
[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:32.661]  Well, glad to do it.
[03:02:33.342 --> 03:02:43.008]  Have all the listeners, everybody throughout the world, if Donald Trump doesn't bring these people to justice and
[03:02:43.536 --> 03:02:48.099]  Get these pedophilia people out and exposed.
[03:02:48.259 --> 03:02:50.101]  It's all about exposure.
[03:02:50.441 --> 03:02:54.384]  He has a hundred days from the day of the inauguration.
[03:02:54.404 --> 03:02:56.265]  Well, he's only got then that's like 18 days left.
[03:02:56.305 --> 03:02:56.945]  Man, let me say this.
[03:02:57.266 --> 03:02:59.267]  He's being blockaded at every level of government.
[03:02:59.567 --> 03:03:01.729]  We've had triple or more of the arrests.
[03:03:02.149 --> 03:03:03.230]  I mean, he is going after him.
[03:03:03.290 --> 03:03:04.671]  He is delivering domestically.
[03:03:05.071 --> 03:03:06.152]  I mean, I'll tell you if he wasn't.
[03:03:06.212 --> 03:03:07.212]  I mean, it's happening.
[03:03:07.252 --> 03:03:10.874]  They can't even get them to drop charges against Arpaio.
[03:03:12.234 --> 03:03:13.235]  He's not Samson here.
[03:03:13.275 --> 03:03:14.295]  He's not Jesus Christ.
[03:03:14.975 --> 03:03:15.816]  He's not King David.
[03:03:15.836 --> 03:03:16.736]  He's trying as hard as he can.
[03:03:16.756 --> 03:03:17.516]  But I hear you, Patrice.
[03:03:17.997 --> 03:03:18.637]  It's up to us.
[03:03:18.697 --> 03:03:19.217]  God bless you.
[03:03:19.958 --> 03:03:22.058]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hans.
[03:03:23.299 --> 03:03:26.160]  Hans in Pennsylvania, then Jason in Germany.
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:26.781]  Go ahead, Hans.
[03:03:28.281 --> 03:03:29.022]  Yes, good afternoon.
[03:03:30.811 --> 03:03:39.481]  As far as nepotism is concerned in politics, it's never a good idea, and I think the President needs to send his kids back to Trump Towers.
[03:03:41.043 --> 03:03:46.490]  And also, I was thinking about his 180 degree reversal on policy when he attacked Syria.
[03:03:47.316 --> 03:03:58.583]  And I have to ask myself, it may be the people that are surrounding him aren't conducting some sort of a psychological operation against him and softening him up so that he's more susceptible to their influence.
[03:03:58.623 --> 03:04:02.746]  Oh, they admit they've got his daughter, everybody, and they're all weak-minded, you know, let's just face it.
[03:04:03.186 --> 03:04:07.089]  I mean, if you haven't been in politics for... I mean, I see myself as weak-minded.
[03:04:07.149 --> 03:04:08.990]  Imagine, they're super weak-minded.
[03:04:09.470 --> 03:04:10.691]  They haven't been doing this for decades.
[03:04:10.911 --> 03:04:11.612]  They're not used to it.
[03:04:12.782 --> 03:04:17.565]  I'm thinking in terms of sleep deprivation and maybe putting something in his coffee.
[03:04:17.686 --> 03:04:20.428]  Oh, you know they drug, you know they drug, they did it to Reagan.
[03:04:20.708 --> 03:04:21.448]  They drugged Reagan.
[03:04:22.729 --> 03:04:22.929]  Yeah.
[03:04:23.370 --> 03:04:28.073]  And they can pipe in this subliminal stuff while he's asleep in his bedroom up there too.
[03:04:28.093 --> 03:04:29.054]  I mean, they can soften him up.
[03:04:29.074 --> 03:04:30.115]  Well, that's why he's smart.
[03:04:30.195 --> 03:04:31.616]  That's why he doesn't stay in the White House.
[03:04:32.176 --> 03:04:34.798]  And I'm not going to give away anything, but believe me, Trump knows what's going on.
[03:04:36.259 --> 03:04:37.840]  Also try and get his phone back too.
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:41.603]  Obama had his BlackBerry for eight years and nobody took it away from him.
[03:04:43.050 --> 03:04:45.771]  Hey, I know the president's number because I've been called on it many times.
[03:04:45.791 --> 03:04:46.592]  That's when we got that NSA leak.
[03:04:46.612 --> 03:04:46.992]  I saw it.
[03:04:47.032 --> 03:04:48.093]  I was like, wow, that's his number.
[03:04:48.413 --> 03:04:49.774]  Wow, that's his Mar-a-Lago apartment.
[03:04:50.314 --> 03:04:51.154]  You know, it's like, wow.
[03:04:51.334 --> 03:04:52.795]  It's like they really got his phone numbers.
[03:04:52.815 --> 03:04:53.716]  They're really spying on him.
[03:04:53.776 --> 03:04:54.396]  It's amazing.
[03:04:54.756 --> 03:04:55.476]  Hans, thank you.
[03:04:55.516 --> 03:04:56.037]  Great points.
[03:04:56.397 --> 03:04:58.818]  I'm at a few more calls and hand the baton to Paul Watson.
[03:04:59.198 --> 03:05:02.220]  Straight ahead on this Tuesday Worldwide broadcast.
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:11.682]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false flag, and more are on the way.
[03:05:11.822 --> 03:05:24.845]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus.
[03:05:25.345 --> 03:05:32.667]  Where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[03:05:32.767 --> 03:05:43.231]  Putin went on to compare the situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction, which may indicate that he believes the U.S.
[03:05:43.371 --> 03:05:47.912]  is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda.
[03:05:48.192 --> 03:05:59.046]  Meanwhile, the Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable.

[03:06:26.218 --> 03:06:29.720]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:06:29.961 --> 03:06:32.622]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:06:32.662 --> 03:06:37.985]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:06:38.466 --> 03:06:40.887]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:06:41.427 --> 03:06:44.869]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:06:44.949 --> 03:06:47.151]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:06:47.191 --> 03:06:47.551]  I love it.
[03:06:47.711 --> 03:06:50.315]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:06:50.516 --> 03:06:51.477]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:51.537 --> 03:06:57.166]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:57.347 --> 03:06:59.129]  It's got a five-star rating.

[03:08:14.855 --> 03:08:16.857]  On earth as it is in heaven.
[03:08:16.877 --> 03:08:40.236]  Give us these days our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[03:08:40.256 --> 03:08:40.336]  Amen.
[03:08:44.617 --> 03:08:49.342]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:53.466 --> 03:08:57.630]  Trump's doing all the things that the globalists don't want.
[03:08:58.170 --> 03:08:59.251]  He's hitting all the right buttons.
[03:08:59.271 --> 03:09:02.515]  He's done everything on the economy, everything on sovereignty, free speech.
[03:09:03.663 --> 03:09:07.165]  That's why I'm giving the benefit of the doubt on Syria, but this North Korea situation.
[03:09:07.185 --> 03:09:08.585]  I'm going to go to Paul Watson right now.
[03:09:08.605 --> 03:09:09.766]  I promised him a few more calls.
[03:09:09.786 --> 03:09:12.147]  We'll take them together right now and then let Paul take over.
[03:09:12.267 --> 03:09:13.587]  God, it's hard to get on air anyways.
[03:09:14.608 --> 03:09:17.849]  Paul, I've totally backed you in your criticism of Trump.
[03:09:17.869 --> 03:09:22.792]  I agree with you, but you know I called you Sunday and I told you what the president had said.
[03:09:24.261 --> 03:09:28.484]  And you notice now Tillerson has all said that and they've reiterated it.
[03:09:28.504 --> 03:09:29.845]  There's a real war going on here.
[03:09:30.045 --> 03:09:32.447]  The President's not putting out multi-versions.
[03:09:32.927 --> 03:09:34.028]  He's being ignored.
[03:09:35.449 --> 03:09:39.251]  He has a rebellion against him where he can't hire anybody that will actually carry out his will.
[03:09:41.052 --> 03:09:46.336]  What do you make of this, Paul Watson, just in a snapshot of where we are historically?
[03:09:48.459 --> 03:09:51.540]  Well, I mean, it's strange times, Alex.
[03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:56.381]  I mean, Sean Spicer just went out and said that Hitler never gassed anybody.
[03:09:57.102 --> 03:09:58.682]  Some very strange statements.
[03:09:58.702 --> 03:10:00.723]  What the hell is that from Sean Spicer?
[03:10:01.783 --> 03:10:04.104]  Yeah, it just happened half an hour ago.
[03:10:04.124 --> 03:10:04.644]  Pull it up.
[03:10:04.664 --> 03:10:05.704]  Was he being sarcastic?
[03:10:06.585 --> 03:10:12.626]  No, he said he was comparing Hitler with Assad, and he said even Hitler didn't stoop to this level.
[03:10:12.646 --> 03:10:13.407]  Hitler never gassed anybody.
[03:10:13.427 --> 03:10:15.807]  No, I think he meant like didn't drop gas on people.
[03:10:15.847 --> 03:10:17.248]  They didn't use chemical weapons in World War II.
[03:10:19.198 --> 03:10:22.941]  Yeah, but he didn't... Anyway, he's getting attacked over that strange statement.
[03:10:23.482 --> 03:10:28.827]  But the chilling thing for me, Alex... It shows how historically ignorant his crew is.
[03:10:30.068 --> 03:10:35.953]  It was like when Schwarzenegger said, I want to shove carbon monoxide tubes in everybody that doesn't agree on carbon taxes and kill them.
[03:10:36.133 --> 03:10:37.915]  It's like, dude, your dad was a famous Nazi.
[03:10:39.036 --> 03:10:41.058]  They just don't have any historical... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:10:41.943 --> 03:10:44.184]  Hey guys, I'm chiming in real quick.
[03:10:44.364 --> 03:10:53.529]  Aside from that Sean Spicer thing about Hitler gassing people, it's really interesting that the mainstream media has been pushing this parallel of Auschwitz.
[03:10:54.129 --> 03:10:55.890]  They push it against Rand Paul.
[03:10:55.950 --> 03:11:04.475]  Lindsey Graham is saying that he denies Auschwitz happened when Auschwitz obviously was a death camp, a forced labor camp and death camp, and then we also have
[03:11:06.636 --> 03:11:12.199]  Them coming out saying Syria is like Japan, ISIS is like Hitler.
[03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:13.800]  So that's a great point, Matt.
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:14.061]  Paul?
[03:11:15.682 --> 03:11:17.082]  Yeah, things are getting crazy, Alex.
[03:11:17.383 --> 03:11:24.967]  I've got a guest coming on at 33 after who, you know, his sources close to the Trump administration told him Syria would be struck.
[03:11:25.027 --> 03:11:26.428]  It was struck within hours.
[03:11:26.868 --> 03:11:31.131]  Now that same source is telling him it's 50% likely they're going to attack North Korea.
[03:11:31.986 --> 03:11:33.407]  Imminently, basically.
[03:11:33.567 --> 03:11:34.528]  So we're going to get into that.
[03:11:34.928 --> 03:11:42.814]  China has now come out and said that they will attack North Korea's nuclear facilities if it crosses a red line.
[03:11:43.235 --> 03:11:48.779]  So now China is basically betraying its own ally saying that they will create a red line.
[03:11:48.899 --> 03:11:49.539]  Let me just stop you.
[03:11:49.559 --> 03:11:51.960]  That's because Trump told him he's ready to go to war and he's serious.
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:52.920]  Here's Reuters.
[03:11:53.220 --> 03:11:57.922]  They turned back North Korea's main export is coal and slave labor to China.
[03:11:58.182 --> 03:12:03.184]  They turned back four ships, five ships that had coal on them going back.
[03:12:03.204 --> 03:12:06.005]  So it looks like China actually bought into what Trump was saying.
[03:12:06.025 --> 03:12:07.946]  It looks like Trump's breakmanship is working.
[03:12:07.966 --> 03:12:08.886]  Let's talk about your source.
[03:12:09.226 --> 03:12:10.226]  That's huge, Paul.
[03:12:10.807 --> 03:12:11.867]  Your source has been accurate.
[03:12:11.887 --> 03:12:14.868]  Who is this source saying this is what happened and now it's happened?
[03:12:16.161 --> 03:12:26.228]  Well, it's Jack Posobiec who is coming on at 33 after, and like I said, you know, he was told 75% certainty they would strike Syria hours before when nobody expected it.
[03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.809]  It happened.
[03:12:27.209 --> 03:12:30.792]  Same sources telling him they're going to go into North Korea imminently.
[03:12:31.252 --> 03:12:32.213]  So we're going to get into it.
[03:12:32.273 --> 03:12:33.033]  He's got the source.
[03:12:33.053 --> 03:12:35.215]  Well, to be clear, I mean, I'm not knocking him.
[03:12:35.235 --> 03:12:35.876]  He's a good guy.
[03:12:36.716 --> 03:12:37.417]  I know he is.
[03:12:38.118 --> 03:12:40.943]  We set hours before they probably hit it right when the Chinese president met.
[03:12:40.983 --> 03:12:42.565]  I mean, he had signaled that.
[03:12:43.607 --> 03:12:44.688]  You're the expert on the source.
[03:12:45.129 --> 03:12:47.092]  This source, way before, said this was going to happen?
[03:12:49.102 --> 03:12:51.924]  No, this just came out today with the North Korea issue.
[03:12:51.944 --> 03:12:54.386]  So, you know, I'm going to get into it at 33 after.
[03:12:54.586 --> 03:12:58.268]  Well, let's talk about that because Trump says he's prepared the military to hit.
[03:12:59.049 --> 03:13:02.811]  China seems to be, I agree with your source.
[03:13:03.011 --> 03:13:03.712]  I didn't see that.
[03:13:04.052 --> 03:13:06.554]  Where did China say they're ready to hit North Korea?
[03:13:07.919 --> 03:13:13.947]  It's headline China threatens to bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities if it crosses Beijing's bottom line.
[03:13:14.528 --> 03:13:15.850]  So now they've got a bottom line.
[03:13:15.870 --> 03:13:22.279]  They came out in their official Global Times, which is like the communist mouthpiece, it's basically straight from the government, and said
[03:13:23.311 --> 03:13:26.655]  I can quote it, China has a bottom line that it will protect at all costs.
[03:13:26.715 --> 03:13:31.419]  It goes on to say, China will employ by all means available including the military means to strike back.
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:41.930]  It's not an issue of discussion whether China acquiesces but the Chinese People's Liberation Army will launch attacks against DPRK nuclear facilities on its own.
[03:13:42.671 --> 03:13:46.076]  So that's what I was told.
[03:13:46.116 --> 03:13:47.498]  Trump said, look, I'm ready to go.
[03:13:48.039 --> 03:13:48.980]  They've got everybody in place.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:50.001]  Well, let's just point this out.
[03:13:50.402 --> 03:13:51.824]  Everybody says China runs North Korea.
[03:13:51.864 --> 03:13:52.865]  That's not the intel I get.
[03:13:52.885 --> 03:13:54.948]  It sounds like North Korea is out of control.
[03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:56.330]  That's the way to do this.
[03:13:56.430 --> 03:13:57.972]  Let China strike North Korea then.
[03:13:58.922 --> 03:14:00.324]  Well, I mean, it's interesting, Alex.
[03:14:00.984 --> 03:14:06.690]  I did a poll, it's 50-50 amongst Trump supporters, Trump voters, whether they endorse an attack on North Korea.
[03:14:07.091 --> 03:14:13.698]  I mean, at least you could say North Korea is directly threatening the US on a weekly basis, if not more.
[03:14:14.078 --> 03:14:18.343]  They're belligerent, they're aggressive, they're threatening a sixth nuclear test.
[03:14:18.803 --> 03:14:19.964]  Sure, let me be clear.
[03:14:20.044 --> 03:14:23.928]  If I'm pointing a gun at you, and I say, my finger's on the trigger, I'm gonna shoot you,
[03:14:36.385 --> 03:14:38.528]  You have a right then to shoot me because I'm threatening to do it.
[03:14:38.849 --> 03:14:44.837]  Kim Jong-un is ready for war as China moves 140,000 troops to its border after Donald Trump sends warships to North Korea.
[03:14:44.857 --> 03:14:48.041]  They're threatening North Korea to nuke the carrier task force.
[03:14:48.542 --> 03:14:51.947]  They understand the United States has 20 to 1 superiority over China.
[03:14:54.028 --> 03:14:56.771]  No, exactly, but of course the threat is the escalation.
[03:14:56.811 --> 03:14:58.433]  As soon as the U.S.
[03:14:58.453 --> 03:15:02.438]  attacks North Korea, they will lob missiles into South Korea.
[03:15:02.478 --> 03:15:05.922]  They will attack South Korea, and it could be the start of World War III.
[03:15:06.282 --> 03:15:07.844]  That's why people are concerned about that.
[03:15:07.864 --> 03:15:08.645]  I don't think it could be.
[03:15:08.825 --> 03:15:10.928]  I think if a shooting war starts, nukes will be used.
[03:15:11.769 --> 03:15:12.690]  No, I agree.
[03:15:13.130 --> 03:15:15.151]  And we need to have room for that debate.
[03:15:15.491 --> 03:15:21.415]  The most concerning thing to me, Alex, is a lot of Trump supporters are not on InfoWars.
[03:15:21.455 --> 03:15:22.576]  You probably noticed this.
[03:15:22.636 --> 03:15:32.662]  They're completely on our side in terms of being against a military escalation in Syria, against toppling Assad, because it's proven completely disastrous every time we've done it in the past.
[03:15:33.042 --> 03:15:39.306]  But then if you look at the polls, for example, 86% of Republicans support the attack on Syria. 86%.
[03:15:41.867 --> 03:15:48.470]  Uh, roughly the same number of Democrats support it as supported an attack on Syria under Obama back in 2013.
[03:15:48.970 --> 03:15:51.851]  But his actual approval rating hasn't moved.
[03:15:51.912 --> 03:15:56.834]  It's basically stayed the same, the general approval rating, so... Well, those numbers are fake.
[03:15:58.103 --> 03:16:00.564]  The approval ratings are totally fake, but I totally agree with you.
[03:16:00.604 --> 03:16:01.464]  This is a crisis.
[03:16:02.304 --> 03:16:02.764]  Here's the deal.
[03:16:02.804 --> 03:16:04.465]  North Korea is threatening to attack everybody.
[03:16:05.125 --> 03:16:08.626]  China's been backing all this belligerence, so they're the ones starting the fight.
[03:16:08.706 --> 03:16:11.627]  That's why here, I'm supporting the president being strong.
[03:16:12.887 --> 03:16:14.107]  Syria didn't start the war.
[03:16:14.547 --> 03:16:15.808]  Syria didn't do anything.
[03:16:16.228 --> 03:16:17.808]  We're backing the wrong people in Syria.
[03:16:17.828 --> 03:16:18.628]  That's why I'm against it.
[03:16:18.909 --> 03:16:20.269]  It's all moral standing, Paul.
[03:16:21.687 --> 03:16:26.571]  Yeah, and we're just maintaining the principle that we've had for the six-year-long Syrian civil war.
[03:16:26.991 --> 03:16:38.799]  The other argument they've got, I mean, I'm concerned because I'm seeing a lot of Trump supporters, you know, basically turning it into a cult of personality where they say, I will support anything if Trump says it's the right thing to do.
[03:16:38.859 --> 03:16:42.322]  Well, are they going to support him if he starts barbecuing babies on the White House lawn?
[03:16:42.782 --> 03:16:49.188]  You know, 400,000 Syrian people, both military and civilians, have died in the six-year war.
[03:16:49.608 --> 03:16:52.531]  Assad didn't just suddenly start killing his own people.
[03:16:52.671 --> 03:16:53.672]  It's a civil war.
[03:16:54.012 --> 03:16:56.074]  The jihadists are killing their own people.
[03:16:56.374 --> 03:16:57.275]  That's what it is.
[03:16:57.615 --> 03:17:06.963]  So what changed from March 31st, when Rex Tillerson said, Assad is part of the future of Syria, to now we must have regime change in Syria?
[03:17:07.283 --> 03:17:10.266]  Something changed, because it wasn't the chemical weapons attack.
[03:17:10.546 --> 03:17:12.249]  There have been attacks on both sides.
[03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:13.291]  They've killed each other.
[03:17:13.351 --> 03:17:15.495]  And that's what Michael Savage asked last hour.
[03:17:15.555 --> 03:17:16.957]  I'm skipping this break so we have more time.
[03:17:17.398 --> 03:17:19.161]  What do you think it is that changed?
[03:17:20.922 --> 03:17:26.827]  I think it was the demotion of Bannon from the National Security Council and the fact that Trump's being surrounded by neocons.
[03:17:27.367 --> 03:17:29.489]  And you know, I've gone on record opposing that.
[03:17:29.529 --> 03:17:42.559]  I think it's a very concerning development and it's concerning that a lot of Trump supporters, not our base, not the InfoWars base, Alex, if you go on InfoWars, you read the comments, these are high information readers.
[03:17:42.899 --> 03:17:49.965]  But a lot of the low information Trump voters will just go along with whatever he says, not knowing that it's because he's
[03:17:50.685 --> 03:17:53.566]  He's come under pressure from the people who are surrounding him.
[03:17:53.967 --> 03:17:59.729]  You know, back on March 11th, I said, I went through his foreign policy advisors one by one.
[03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:02.510]  You know, 25, 30 of them.
[03:18:03.130 --> 03:18:06.072]  Half of them, at least, were CFR members back then.
[03:18:06.572 --> 03:18:07.752]  It's like, well, yeah, some of them would be.
[03:18:07.792 --> 03:18:08.993]  Absolutely, it's the same people.
[03:18:09.333 --> 03:18:11.134]  And what we care about is him getting policy done.
[03:18:11.174 --> 03:18:14.255]  If he hires goblins to investigate Mordor, that's fine.
[03:18:14.275 --> 03:18:15.816]  Just don't become Mordo.
[03:18:15.856 --> 03:18:17.476]  We don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin.
[03:18:18.197 --> 03:18:19.057]  But looking at this,
[03:18:20.643 --> 03:18:20.963]  Well, I mean...
[03:18:39.545 --> 03:18:43.428]  You know, but we have the Korean War which killed like 1.2 million people.
[03:18:43.448 --> 03:18:48.231]  That's going to be child's play compared to a nuclear escalation in that part of the world.
[03:18:48.652 --> 03:18:51.093]  You know, 33,000 dead troops in the Korean War.
[03:18:51.594 --> 03:18:54.296]  At what risk are they putting the world at risk?
[03:18:54.316 --> 03:18:54.656]  Look, I agree.
[03:18:54.716 --> 03:18:55.577]  I've got children.
[03:18:55.677 --> 03:18:56.677]  I don't want this risk, Paul.
[03:18:57.118 --> 03:19:03.782]  I'm just saying, preliminarily, it looks like this brinksmanship in the Korean Peninsula is going the way of Trump.
[03:19:03.862 --> 03:19:05.504]  China is signaling
[03:19:06.284 --> 03:19:09.770]  All over the place that they're they are now doing the USS.
[03:19:11.753 --> 03:19:12.995]  Well, we're gonna have to wait and see.
[03:19:13.075 --> 03:19:15.919]  We know that basically South Koreans are panicking.
[03:19:15.939 --> 03:19:17.302]  Their government had to come out and
[03:19:18.425 --> 03:19:20.928]  Quell their fears that there's going to be imminent war.
[03:19:20.968 --> 03:19:30.038]  You have an expert, we just got the article up on Infowars a couple of hours ago, he says that there's a plan to strike the North Korean main nuclear reactor.
[03:19:30.619 --> 03:19:32.922]  What will that lead to environmentally?
[03:19:32.962 --> 03:19:34.083]  But there's a plan for that.
[03:19:34.504 --> 03:19:38.809]  And as I said earlier, this this source has told Jack Possibly, I'm going to get him on.
[03:19:39.449 --> 03:19:43.772]  That it's 50% likely that there's going to be an imminent strike on North Korea.
[03:19:43.932 --> 03:19:46.134]  Well, Trump's already said that.
[03:19:46.594 --> 03:19:48.135]  And they've already got everybody ready.
[03:19:48.195 --> 03:19:49.896]  They're also going to kill Kim Jong-un.
[03:19:50.437 --> 03:19:56.100]  So he better be in a deep, deep bunker right now because, let me tell you, they got the space-based weapons trained on his ass.
[03:19:57.001 --> 03:19:58.962]  What do you think overall about the situation, Paul?
[03:20:00.624 --> 03:20:05.947]  I think there is more support amongst Trump voters for an attack on North Korea than there was Syria.
[03:20:06.528 --> 03:20:08.529]  Yeah, because they're threatening everybody.
[03:20:09.577 --> 03:20:11.238]  Yeah, well he's threatening everybody.
[03:20:11.258 --> 03:20:13.179]  You can make the argument from that angle.
[03:20:13.599 --> 03:20:18.022]  You know, they've got 200,000 people in gulags, political prisoners.
[03:20:19.163 --> 03:20:22.044]  This is a dictator armed with nuclear weapons.
[03:20:22.124 --> 03:20:23.385]  Nobody can deny that.
[03:20:23.785 --> 03:20:26.167]  I think it's very different to the situation in Syria.
[03:20:26.467 --> 03:20:31.149]  But more Trump supporters support an attack on North Korea than they did on Syria.
[03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:32.450]  That much is clear.
[03:20:32.490 --> 03:20:33.371]  I think on Syria,
[03:20:34.511 --> 03:20:37.814]  This poll said 86% support it.
[03:20:37.834 --> 03:20:40.997]  51% of Americans overall support the Trump strike on Syria.
[03:20:41.457 --> 03:20:44.200]  I think that would be higher in the case of North Korea.
[03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:45.020]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:47.503]  I mean, we didn't start this with North Korea.
[03:20:47.843 --> 03:20:50.245]  The Clintons gave them the reactors to create the weapons.
[03:20:50.505 --> 03:20:51.306]  Here's the deal, Paul.
[03:20:52.046 --> 03:20:54.709]  Nobody's behind that camera, so I can do this as unloaded as well, of course.
[03:20:55.169 --> 03:20:58.212]  But I mean, if I'm pointing a gun right at you,
[03:20:59.275 --> 03:21:06.598]  Okay, like North Korea is threatening Japan to nuke Tokyo, they're threatening to attack Seoul, South Korea.
[03:21:06.918 --> 03:21:08.859]  They say they have the missiles, they're shooting them every week.
[03:21:09.119 --> 03:21:10.300]  They say they're going to nuke the U.S.
[03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:10.880]  Task Force.
[03:21:11.721 --> 03:21:18.023]  Don't they understand that the United States, Japan, everybody, Russia, quite frankly, has threatened to nuke China before they were doing this.
[03:21:18.484 --> 03:21:25.747]  Don't they understand that we have a right, when they're threatening us and pointing right at us, for us to pull the trigger, preemptively to stop them, Paul?
[03:21:28.052 --> 03:21:32.353]  Well, it's a better argument for it can be made than what's happening in Syria.
[03:21:32.693 --> 03:21:37.914]  And, you know, on that subject, Putin came out today and said what we said an hour after the strike.
[03:21:37.954 --> 03:21:38.474]  False alarm.
[03:21:39.234 --> 03:21:40.675]  Yeah, but not just that.
[03:21:40.735 --> 03:21:44.015]  They could just stage a chemical weapons incident in Damascus.
[03:21:44.476 --> 03:21:49.157]  And if the new standard is now set that, you know, any atrocity is met by a U.S.
[03:21:49.197 --> 03:21:54.958]  missile strike and attack, then that's bye-bye Assad and it's the obliteration of Damascus and Syria.
[03:21:55.598 --> 03:21:56.299]  And that's the point.
[03:21:56.619 --> 03:22:01.443]  There's all this talk about, oh, we're going to have a political solution where Assad is going to politely step down.
[03:22:01.763 --> 03:22:02.003]  No!
[03:22:02.284 --> 03:22:03.465]  That's not going to happen.
[03:22:03.765 --> 03:22:06.767]  He's fought a brutal civil war for six years.
[03:22:07.128 --> 03:22:11.672]  He's been under intense international pressure for that six years to step down.
[03:22:11.952 --> 03:22:13.673]  He's not going to do it without a fight.
[03:22:13.753 --> 03:22:14.554]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:22:14.574 --> 03:22:15.735]  I think it's politely convincing.
[03:22:15.875 --> 03:22:16.656]  It's not going to happen.
[03:22:17.196 --> 03:22:18.117]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:22:18.137 --> 03:22:18.838]  We're going to go to a few calls.
[03:22:18.858 --> 03:22:20.679]  I'm going to turn it over to you here, but I promise to go to these calls.
[03:22:21.940 --> 03:22:22.501]  Gut level.
[03:22:24.750 --> 03:22:26.033]  What do you think is happening with Trump?
[03:22:26.073 --> 03:22:27.676]  I think they said, look, North Korea is threatening.
[03:22:27.997 --> 03:22:28.598]  China is threatening.
[03:22:28.618 --> 03:22:29.480]  You've got to look strong.
[03:22:29.861 --> 03:22:31.324]  We don't know whose chemicals these are.
[03:22:31.545 --> 03:22:32.086]  Send a message.
[03:22:32.106 --> 03:22:33.769]  That's what I was told by the White House sources.
[03:22:34.696 --> 03:22:36.037]  I know the president told folks that.
[03:22:36.757 --> 03:22:40.339]  And now Tillerson is backing off all this war talk with Syria today.
[03:22:40.379 --> 03:22:42.620]  I mean, I think that's overall encouraging.
[03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:46.722]  China cutting off commerce with North Korea.
[03:22:47.123 --> 03:22:49.504]  It looks like things are de-escalating.
[03:22:49.524 --> 03:22:52.726]  I mean, every other talk show host wants to escalate all this right now.
[03:22:52.846 --> 03:22:55.567]  I'm trying to de-escalate, but I'm being honest about all this.
[03:22:55.607 --> 03:22:56.728]  So, Paul, what does your gut tell you?
[03:22:59.161 --> 03:23:02.423]  Well, I don't think we're going to know until a week or two's time.
[03:23:02.543 --> 03:23:04.004]  You've got a lot of mixed messages.
[03:23:04.024 --> 03:23:07.986]  You've got Tillerson basically with a different message each day.
[03:23:08.026 --> 03:23:11.668]  It's like, yes, we have to take out ISIS first, but eventually Assad has to go.
[03:23:12.108 --> 03:23:16.211]  Then he said, oh, the Syrian people have to decide whether Assad has to go or not.
[03:23:16.631 --> 03:23:18.212]  So they can't get the script right.
[03:23:18.232 --> 03:23:20.053]  Then you've got Nikki Haley at the UN.
[03:23:20.493 --> 03:23:25.956]  Who is holding up photographs, you know, like Colin Powell held up the vial of anthrax or whatever.
[03:23:26.136 --> 03:23:26.617]  Or the babies.
[03:23:26.657 --> 03:23:28.218]  That's proof of something.
[03:23:28.498 --> 03:23:29.839]  Just smells bad, Alex.
[03:23:30.219 --> 03:23:34.121]  You turn on Fox News, it's like pre-Iraq war invasion kind of rhetoric.
[03:23:34.221 --> 03:23:34.981]  Oh, I agree.
[03:23:35.002 --> 03:23:36.022]  They're foaming at the mouth.
[03:23:36.342 --> 03:23:39.164]  And these aren't Muslims with no weapons we're attacking this time.
[03:23:39.664 --> 03:23:42.626]  This is major powers with nuclear weapons.
[03:23:43.046 --> 03:23:45.828]  I promise to go to calls, let's take a few and let Paul take over.
[03:23:46.248 --> 03:23:49.310]  Jason in Deutschland, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:23:50.819 --> 03:23:53.220]  Hey, first of all, I want to say it's a pleasure to be on while Paul's on.
[03:23:53.260 --> 03:23:53.800]  I love Paul.
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:54.620]  I follow him on Twitter.
[03:23:56.341 --> 03:24:00.862]  Just a note on the opening that you came in with, Melania Trump and the Lord's Prayer.
[03:24:01.343 --> 03:24:06.404]  I'm Jack Christian at best, and I've never prayed for our leaders before until Trump came in.
[03:24:07.145 --> 03:24:08.525]  And I do pray for Trump.
[03:24:08.965 --> 03:24:12.606]  I don't know how far my prayers make it up to the mountains, but I do do that.
[03:24:13.207 --> 03:24:16.608]  A couple pieces of advice for Trump, just practically speaking.
[03:24:17.348 --> 03:24:22.310]  I don't know why nobody in the government has, you know, tooled up some factory to make their own phones.
[03:24:22.350 --> 03:24:33.095]  Why are we worried about Android devices or Blackberry devices when we could easily tool up a factory with the best experts in the world and create a freaking phone that Trump could feel secure on?
[03:24:33.115 --> 03:24:33.855]  So that's one thing.
[03:24:34.215 --> 03:24:45.300]  Second thing, I don't know why Trump hasn't organized a parallel, maybe secretive, intelligence group that he can trust rather than relying only on the intel that he's getting from the deep state.
[03:24:46.637 --> 03:24:55.824]  As far as the North Korea thing, why am I feeling like this is the ghost of false flags passed, you know, with how we got into the Vietnam War with the Gulf of Tonkin?
[03:24:55.844 --> 03:24:56.985]  I agree.
[03:24:57.105 --> 03:24:58.446]  And now there's all these nuclear weapons.
[03:24:58.506 --> 03:25:00.969]  It just goes from bad to worse.
[03:25:01.069 --> 03:25:03.691]  Matt in Oklahoma, you're on the air with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:25:05.149 --> 03:25:07.771]  Oh man, what's going on Alex and Paul at the same time?
[03:25:07.892 --> 03:25:08.772]  Man, what am I up to?
[03:25:08.812 --> 03:25:10.354]  Man, I'm glad I held as long as I did.
[03:25:10.834 --> 03:25:13.717]  I had three real quick things to touch on.
[03:25:13.937 --> 03:25:17.140]  One, you guys were segueing into, first thing, North Korea.
[03:25:18.101 --> 03:25:21.224]  We all know Kim, he is crazy, yes, and he's got nukes.
[03:25:21.364 --> 03:25:22.885]  Okay, nobody likes him.
[03:25:23.305 --> 03:25:29.311]  But let's talk about why we want to actually attack the country for a moment, that North Korea
[03:25:29.921 --> 03:25:42.748]  And Iran and I believe Cuba was the last three countries that did not get taken over by a central banking system, i.e., you know, the Federal Reserve and all of their lackeys and their banking cartels, if you will.
[03:25:43.308 --> 03:25:53.013]  But, you know, this is the only real reason we want to go into North Korea and we're being provocative to them so that they throw the first punch so we can just knock them out with the next swing.
[03:25:53.434 --> 03:25:54.834]  But that being said... Let me just stop you.
[03:25:54.894 --> 03:25:56.215]  The fact that... Yeah, go ahead.
[03:25:57.856 --> 03:26:05.738]  For the first time ever, China is threatening, officially in their People's Daily, to nuke North Korea and turning their ships back shows.
[03:26:05.758 --> 03:26:09.979]  They were told, we're ready to go to war, we're crazy, do what we say.
[03:26:10.039 --> 03:26:13.760]  Whatever Trump said got the Chinese dictator's attention.
[03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:15.880]  I gotta say, this is crazy.
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:17.961]  I've never seen the Chinese roll over like this.
[03:26:18.982 --> 03:26:20.904]  China threatens to bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities.
[03:26:20.944 --> 03:26:21.885]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[03:26:21.945 --> 03:26:22.786]  We'll show that version.
[03:26:23.107 --> 03:26:26.952]  If it crosses Beijing's bottom line, and that is starting a war with the United States.
[03:26:27.012 --> 03:26:28.313]  So, wow.
[03:26:28.794 --> 03:26:33.560]  I gotta tell you, Trump's brinksmanship, at least so far, has really had an effect.
[03:26:34.361 --> 03:26:37.205]  I'm gonna go back to you, Collar, but Paul Watson, what do you make of this?
[03:26:39.059 --> 03:26:47.888]  Well, I mean, what concerns me, Alex, is if you take that position, you're siding with John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and a lot of them.
[03:26:47.928 --> 03:26:48.890]  That makes me very uncomfortable.
[03:26:48.970 --> 03:26:51.632]  I'm not in Syria, but North Korea's been asking for it.
[03:26:51.672 --> 03:26:52.694]  I'm not saying I want war.
[03:26:53.905 --> 03:26:58.248]  Well, if you read what the Wall Street Journal wrote today, which is quote,
[03:27:23.865 --> 03:27:23.953]  Yeah.
[03:27:27.091 --> 03:27:27.451]  I hear you.
[03:27:27.531 --> 03:27:28.652]  It's on screen right now.
[03:27:28.672 --> 03:27:31.674]  We're going to punch it up and put it up there for folks.
[03:27:31.754 --> 03:27:34.096]  China threatens to bomb North Korea's facilities.
[03:27:34.516 --> 03:27:36.337]  If you scroll down, that's in the People's Daily.
[03:27:36.357 --> 03:27:36.997]  They have a link there.
[03:27:37.017 --> 03:27:40.320]  We'll scroll down and then link through to the actual link in the story.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.903]  That is just wild right there to show where we've gotten to.
[03:27:44.943 --> 03:27:47.084]  But I mean, why does anybody care about North Korea anyways?
[03:27:47.104 --> 03:27:48.425]  I mean, it's a bunch of poor slaves.
[03:27:49.025 --> 03:27:50.006]  We've got to turn this around.
[03:27:50.026 --> 03:27:51.006]  I know this, Paul.
[03:27:51.487 --> 03:27:53.968]  Every night I go to bed and I wake up in the morning, we're not in a nuclear war.
[03:27:54.008 --> 03:27:54.709]  I'm very, very happy.
[03:27:56.838 --> 03:28:01.303]  Exactly, and there's also a lot of hypocrisy going on.
[03:28:01.363 --> 03:28:07.771]  Tillerson came out and said the US will hold to account any state or group that targets innocents, that commits atrocities.
[03:28:08.291 --> 03:28:12.115]  Saudi Arabia has been committing atrocities in Yemen for about a year now.
[03:28:12.436 --> 03:28:13.137]  You've got 5,000 civilians dead.
[03:28:15.419 --> 03:28:17.441]  The US sold them the weapons to do it.
[03:28:17.461 --> 03:28:19.602]  They're not going to confront Saudi Arabia.
[03:28:20.663 --> 03:28:26.308]  This line that they're just going to attack anyone who commits any atrocity, it's complete BS, Alex.
[03:28:26.348 --> 03:28:30.691]  And like I said, a lot of the rhetoric sounds like 2002, 2003.
[03:28:31.451 --> 03:28:35.675]  If you switch on Fox News and listen to these talking heads, they're salivating.
[03:28:38.191 --> 03:28:39.373]  All right, Paul, I'm sorry to jump in.
[03:28:39.413 --> 03:28:40.694]  It's hard to get you to an hour a week.
[03:28:40.714 --> 03:28:41.956]  I wish you'd do hours every day.
[03:28:41.976 --> 03:28:46.182]  You do a great job at Infowars.com with your articles and videos, but I got to let Matt go.
[03:28:46.202 --> 03:28:47.103]  Matt, I appreciate your call.
[03:28:47.123 --> 03:28:47.584]  Great points.
[03:28:47.944 --> 03:28:48.885]  I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[03:28:48.925 --> 03:28:49.406]  I'm out of time.
[03:28:49.426 --> 03:28:50.508]  Paul's going to take over with his guests.
[03:28:50.908 --> 03:28:52.350]  Coming up with breaking news straight ahead.
[03:28:53.231 --> 03:28:57.092]  Please, so we got 40% off on the Pro Pure Nomad water filter.
[03:28:57.112 --> 03:28:58.272]  We've never done a deal like that.
[03:28:58.292 --> 03:28:59.953]  That's basically at cost.
[03:29:00.013 --> 03:29:01.473]  It would mean like $10 on it or something.
[03:29:01.553 --> 03:29:02.393]  X2 is selling out.
[03:29:02.733 --> 03:29:03.794]  It's still 25% off.
[03:29:03.834 --> 03:29:07.815]  Caveman, Bone Broth, Turmeric, Chaga, and of course, Bee Pollen and more.
[03:29:07.835 --> 03:29:09.115]  That's just an amazing formula.
[03:29:09.415 --> 03:29:12.876]  Go to the top companies in the country and make the very best formulas to fund our operation.
[03:29:12.936 --> 03:29:14.276]  Make sure you get great results.
[03:29:14.616 --> 03:29:15.436]  We get great reviews.
[03:29:15.456 --> 03:29:16.457]  We get repeat customers.
[03:29:16.517 --> 03:29:17.397]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[03:29:18.277 --> 03:29:22.819]  360Win, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:29:22.899 --> 03:29:27.541]  We'll probably make it through this crisis, but the world is just entering crazier and crazier times.
[03:29:27.561 --> 03:29:30.863]  That's why it's more important than ever that you be engaged and you be involved.
[03:29:31.243 --> 03:29:36.185]  CNN's criticizing us for not wanting Warren Syria and their piece, Alt-Right Turns on President Trump.
[03:29:36.506 --> 03:29:37.546]  We didn't turn on Trump.
[03:29:37.586 --> 03:29:41.528]  We turned on a policy, and we're having a big effect right now backing it up.
[03:29:42.472 --> 03:29:45.094]  Paul Joseph Watson, straight ahead from London, England.
[03:29:45.434 --> 03:29:46.195]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:46.235 --> 03:29:47.396]  This is the InfoWar.
[03:29:47.596 --> 03:29:51.559]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWar's nightly news, unless we're in a nuclear war.
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:52.980]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.481 --> 03:29:55.082]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.983 --> 03:29:58.645]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.607 --> 03:30:07.470]  I want to tell you about some of the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:09.372]  We are under constant attack.
[03:30:09.872 --> 03:30:12.054]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[03:30:12.254 --> 03:30:15.137]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[03:30:15.177 --> 03:30:29.509]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:31.830]  They can't get to us that way.
[03:30:32.190 --> 03:30:35.012]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[03:30:35.052 --> 03:30:36.032]  They don't have that power.
[03:30:36.493 --> 03:30:39.034]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[03:30:39.374 --> 03:30:41.776]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:30:42.236 --> 03:30:45.077]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:45.097 --> 03:30:46.738]  This is by listener request.
[03:30:46.978 --> 03:30:52.221]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[03:30:52.241 --> 03:30:52.802]  Again,
[03:30:53.542 --> 03:30:59.291]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[03:30:59.711 --> 03:31:04.037]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[03:31:04.618 --> 03:31:08.424]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[03:31:10.486 --> 03:31:13.207]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[03:31:13.227 --> 03:31:31.611]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[03:31:31.971 --> 03:31:34.792]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[03:31:34.832 --> 03:31:36.853]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[03:31:37.213 --> 03:31:39.214]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[03:31:39.655 --> 03:31:51.280]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[03:31:51.300 --> 03:31:55.142]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:03.789 --> 03:32:11.551]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:11.771 --> 03:32:18.192]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:32:18.412 --> 03:32:26.714]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:32:26.994 --> 03:32:32.621]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[03:32:32.861 --> 03:32:35.745]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:32:36.005 --> 03:32:41.772]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:32:42.112 --> 03:32:42.572]  It works.
[03:32:42.872 --> 03:32:51.176]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:32:51.197 --> 03:33:00.721]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:33:01.061 --> 03:33:01.582]  A total 360 win.
[03:33:07.435 --> 03:33:09.637]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:33:09.697 --> 03:33:15.400]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.021 --> 03:33:19.743]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:27.595 --> 03:33:31.380]  And we're back live on the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:34.664]  Our guest is on the line with big news.
[03:33:34.744 --> 03:33:36.747]  He is Jack Posobiec.
[03:33:36.767 --> 03:33:38.248]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:39.911]  At Jack Posobiec on Twitter.
[03:33:40.291 --> 03:33:43.235]  Navy intel veteran, founder of Citizens for Trump.
[03:33:43.715 --> 03:33:44.837]  Jack, welcome to the show.
[03:33:45.922 --> 03:33:46.582]  How's it going, Paul?
[03:33:46.602 --> 03:33:47.703]  You got it perfectly right.
[03:33:48.343 --> 03:33:53.827]  You know, it's crazy to say that, you know, they say maybe we want to not live in interesting times.
[03:33:54.287 --> 03:34:01.011]  And so I've just started up working with Rebel Media here in Washington, D.C., and you couldn't have asked for two more interesting weeks than we find ourselves in right now.
[03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:03.330]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:34:03.370 --> 03:34:08.052]  Now we've got China saying that they would consider striking North Korea's nuclear facilities.
[03:34:08.412 --> 03:34:11.953]  You've got South Korean citizens panicking that war is imminent.
[03:34:11.973 --> 03:34:13.933]  They're having to be reassured by their own government.
[03:34:14.373 --> 03:34:21.715]  Your sources, close to the Trump administration, who were accurate on the Syria strike, are now telling you what about North Korea.
[03:34:22.916 --> 03:34:30.858]  So they're essentially telling me this, that a strike is being planned and it is being discussed at the highest levels of the National Security Council.
[03:34:31.677 --> 03:34:51.427]  Essentially, they are passing intelligence report summaries, or assessments as they call them, to the president saying that they believe that Kim Jong-un is preparing to use his nuclear arsenal to prevent regime change, and that the only way, and that Kim believes the only way to stop himself from losing power is to use those nukes.
[03:34:51.447 --> 03:34:52.488]  So they're telling Trump this.
[03:34:52.728 --> 03:34:53.908]  This is people like H.R.
[03:34:53.928 --> 03:35:00.952]  McMaster, people like Dina Powell that are giving this information to Trump, the same way they gave him information regarding the chemical weapons strike last week.
[03:35:01.511 --> 03:35:02.611]  We're good to go.
[03:35:31.235 --> 03:35:32.376]  They're talking soon.
[03:35:32.756 --> 03:35:34.677]  He told me about 10 a.m.
[03:35:35.377 --> 03:35:37.758]  on last Thursday morning that the U.S.
[03:35:37.778 --> 03:35:45.241]  would be striking Syria, 75% chance, and it was about 14 hours later that that strike actually took place, or eight hours later.
[03:35:46.522 --> 03:36:00.628]  So today, this morning, he texted me, essentially, as they texted, as a phrase, I'm not divulging any sources or methods here, but he basically got it across to me that it would be looking at either today or tomorrow, possibly by the end of the week.
[03:36:02.526 --> 03:36:03.547]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:36:03.627 --> 03:36:19.380]  And as I said earlier with Alex, you know, the polls that I've run amongst my audience, who aren't normally that militaristic, you know, 70-30 oppose the military strike in Syria, they're now saying it's running currently at 50-50, supporting an attack on North Korea.
[03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:25.404]  You could make the argument that, you know, he is belligerent, he does have nuclear weapons, he has threatened the United States.
[03:36:25.765 --> 03:36:30.348]  It seems there'd be more support for this than there would for the Syria attack, even though there is
[03:36:31.569 --> 03:36:38.230]  I'm unhappy to say, broadly quite a consensus of support, if you believe the polls, for the Syria attack.
[03:36:38.250 --> 03:36:42.311]  Do you think that Trump voters will get behind this North Korea attack?
[03:36:44.352 --> 03:36:52.693]  The political situation would definitely be a little different with a North Korea attack because there are indications that China seems to be pulling away from supporting North Korea.
[03:36:53.053 --> 03:36:56.674]  But at the same time, as you said, North Korea has not done anything belligerent.
[03:36:57.208 --> 03:37:02.052]  There's been no situation where they've used or chemical weapons have been used in North Korea.
[03:37:02.312 --> 03:37:07.475]  There are no current hostilities going on in North Korea like the current civil war situation in Syria.
[03:37:07.876 --> 03:37:15.201]  So to find people saying that, if anything, this seems like it would turn essentially what's a cold war into a hot war.
[03:37:15.481 --> 03:37:26.609]  And I think that from the political thought that from that could be very disastrous for Trump as he loses a lot of his base that voted for him for the specific reason that he did not want to get involved in more wars.
[03:37:28.669 --> 03:37:35.114]  You have nuclear experts in South Korea also saying that there is a plan to strike that main nuclear facility in North Korea.
[03:37:35.575 --> 03:37:37.116]  Things are getting hot in a hurry.
[03:37:37.637 --> 03:37:52.869]  But, you know, we had this whole military escalation, and you touched on it there, immediately after Steve Bannon, who according to reports, and people have contested this with me, but according to reports was opposed to the Syria strike, he was demoted from the National Security Council.
[03:37:52.909 --> 03:37:56.633]  Of course, this came, what, six weeks, two months after Flynn.
[03:37:57.273 --> 03:38:04.937]  General Flynn, who predicted the rise of ISIS, opposed destabilizing Assad, was replaced with McMaster.
[03:38:05.417 --> 03:38:18.124]  To cut to the chase, Jack, is everything we've seen over the past week a reflection of the fact that neocons are taking over or have taken over the Trump administration, at least in the sector of foreign policy?
[03:38:19.235 --> 03:38:21.835]  So I'm in agreement with you on that, Paul.
[03:38:22.056 --> 03:38:25.296]  I've broken down a couple of videos on rebel media getting into this.
[03:38:25.676 --> 03:38:28.397]  It seems that the balance has shifted.
[03:38:28.697 --> 03:38:42.079]  And at first, people were talking about the Trump administration, particularly the National Security Council with Bannon and Flynn there, but also bringing in people from Goldman Sachs, people from the Bush administration, like Gary Cohn and Dina Powell, bringing them on there.
[03:38:42.339 --> 03:38:46.000]  It seemed as there was a balance between some of the more neoconservative wing,
[03:38:46.576 --> 03:38:47.777]  And the nationalist wing.
[03:38:48.037 --> 03:39:11.217]  But once Flynn was gone, and once Bannon was removed, through a lot of these leaks, a lot of these deep state tactics, a lot of the spying that was going on, that was definitely illegal, involved with the Obama administration, suddenly that balance has shifted, and we're seeing a major, major shift in US policy, because now you don't have anyone in the National Security Council that's essentially providing another option for Trump.
[03:39:11.357 --> 03:39:12.778]  They're saying, this is the way to go,
[03:39:13.271 --> 03:39:18.115]  They're putting generals in there, and they're basically created an echo chamber of saying, we need to attack.
[03:39:18.135 --> 03:39:18.895]  We need to punch out.
[03:39:18.915 --> 03:39:20.537]  We need to use violent military force.
[03:39:20.797 --> 03:39:23.559]  And there isn't anyone saying, hey, maybe we can look at diplomacy.
[03:39:23.839 --> 03:39:30.244]  Maybe we're looking at clandestine operations, intelligence solutions, anything else that could be done.
[03:39:30.284 --> 03:39:30.825]  It's no, no, no.
[03:39:30.885 --> 03:39:31.585]  It's got to be strikes.
[03:39:31.645 --> 03:39:32.266]  It's got to be big.
[03:39:32.306 --> 03:39:33.086]  It's got to be loud.
[03:39:33.347 --> 03:39:34.968]  And you don't have anybody else out there.
[03:39:35.647 --> 03:39:39.672]  Uh, you know, like Bannon would have said to say, well, maybe there's other things we can do.
[03:39:39.752 --> 03:39:41.434]  Maybe we can cut deals with Assad.
[03:39:41.474 --> 03:39:43.576]  Maybe we can cut deals with Putin.
[03:39:43.596 --> 03:39:52.246]  Maybe we can cut deals with China in order to bring this to a solution peacefully by putting everybody in a box rather than launching Raytheon Tomahawk missiles at every issue.
[03:39:54.088 --> 03:39:55.450]  I mean, it comes down to this.
[03:39:56.051 --> 03:40:02.740]  You know, 400,000 Syrians have died in this civil war over the past six years before the chemical weapons attack.
[03:40:03.181 --> 03:40:06.085]  Assad had been killing his own people for six years.
[03:40:06.365 --> 03:40:10.611]  The jihadist rebels had been killing their own people for six years.
[03:40:11.192 --> 03:40:13.414]  It's a civil war, that's what happens.
[03:40:13.794 --> 03:40:17.517]  So I don't think the big change was this supposed chemical weapons attack.
[03:40:17.817 --> 03:40:24.682]  You know, you had Tillerson, even Tillerson, on March 31st saying that Assad was part of Syria's future.
[03:40:25.022 --> 03:40:28.165]  That was the line just, what, 11 days ago.
[03:40:28.665 --> 03:40:31.267]  You know, what changed one week later?
[03:40:31.287 --> 03:40:34.909]  The only thing I can see is Bannon being demoted, right?
[03:40:34.930 --> 03:40:36.411]  I mean, what else changed?
[03:40:37.934 --> 03:40:45.160]  It's a fundamental shift within the administration, and it's a fundamental shift basically with him out of the picture and with H.R.
[03:40:45.180 --> 03:40:46.161]  McMaster now there.
[03:40:46.321 --> 03:40:46.462]  H.R.
[03:40:46.482 --> 03:40:54.569]  McMaster is tied to David Petraeus, who we all know from the Iraq War, and his subsequent demotion or sort of basically resignation and disgrace.
[03:40:54.849 --> 03:40:57.832]  He then became Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor.
[03:40:58.172 --> 03:41:01.836]  Dina Powell herself, she's on the National Security Council now.
[03:41:01.856 --> 03:41:02.997]  She's under McMaster.
[03:41:03.365 --> 03:41:12.448]  She is close personal friends, not only with Ivanka Trump, but also Valerie Jarrett and a lot of people that are involved with the Obama administration and the Bush administration.
[03:41:12.988 --> 03:41:22.411]  So having these people in there, it allows for them to create a way where they can feed Trump any assessments, any intel they want without any conflicting views.
[03:41:22.611 --> 03:41:26.272]  There's now information out that says Mike Pompeo, director of CIA,
[03:41:27.339 --> 03:41:33.623]  Was actually in disagreement with the assessment on Syria, in disagreement with the assessment on the chemical weapons.
[03:41:33.983 --> 03:41:40.428]  And Paul, I know you've seen that picture of everyone sitting there watching the screen on Mar-a-Lago when the strikes took place.
[03:41:40.488 --> 03:41:44.050]  Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, is not in that room.
[03:41:44.730 --> 03:41:53.396]  So for whatever reason, the person who is dissenting about these strikes, dissenting about the chemical weapons and how exactly they were employed, wasn't even invited to the party.
[03:41:55.123 --> 03:42:02.888]  It's amazing and what really concerns me is we're seeing this kind of jingoism which reminds me of pre-Iraq war invasion.
[03:42:03.149 --> 03:42:10.053]  We're seeing anyone that questions this narrative being shamed now by a significant portion of Trump supporters.
[03:42:11.014 --> 03:42:13.356]  You go online, you look at the polls, you know I've run polls.
[03:42:13.976 --> 03:42:15.337]  We have a cult of personality.
[03:42:15.377 --> 03:42:20.962]  We've got people saying, prominent people, I trust Trump whatever he says or does.
[03:42:21.183 --> 03:42:23.825]  I will follow and support him whatever he does.
[03:42:24.806 --> 03:42:26.027]  That's not acceptable.
[03:42:26.067 --> 03:42:30.831]  You can't have a cult of personality where you will follow someone off the edge of the cliff.
[03:42:31.172 --> 03:42:34.295]  We have to still have hope, you know, as happened with Romney.
[03:42:34.835 --> 03:42:36.716]  That Trump will listen to his base.
[03:42:36.896 --> 03:42:40.058]  There was a huge rebellion against Romney as Secretary of State.
[03:42:40.498 --> 03:42:41.598]  They listened to us.
[03:42:41.918 --> 03:42:43.319]  That appointment didn't happen.
[03:42:43.359 --> 03:42:50.523]  You still think there's some hope, there's some space where we could have an influence and try and de-escalate this rush to war?
[03:42:51.543 --> 03:42:57.306]  You know, and I think the best thing for all InfoWars viewers to understand is that social media
[03:42:58.087 --> 03:42:59.368]  And this is Mike Cernovich's line.
[03:42:59.388 --> 03:43:00.288]  I'm totally stealing it from him.
[03:43:00.368 --> 03:43:04.270]  Social media is a direct conversation between you and President Trump.
[03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:11.534]  If you have a feeling about a certain situation, about a certain policy that you don't like moving in a direction, you can take to social media.
[03:43:11.774 --> 03:43:16.657]  You can use things like Periscope, like Facebook Live, like hashtags, flash mobs.
[03:43:16.717 --> 03:43:17.337]  Get out there.
[03:43:17.577 --> 03:43:18.718]  Let your voice be heard.
[03:43:18.958 --> 03:43:20.639]  And he will absolutely see that.
[03:43:20.679 --> 03:43:22.059]  He will absolutely see it.
[03:43:22.780 --> 03:43:25.341]  I know from channels that Team Trump
[03:43:25.794 --> 03:43:35.398]  Absolutely was looking at the massive massive schism that took place over the weekend between Trump supporters and they were looking at it very very closely so you're seeing now
[03:43:35.836 --> 03:43:48.729]  In the past, one option that operatives would use or staffers would use was leaking to the press and, you know, play it, plan a story in Politico, plan a story in Washington Post or New York Times to disgrace somebody, get them fired.
[03:43:48.929 --> 03:43:58.498]  Well, now we're seeing that social media, we all know how much Trump won in part because of social media, how that can be used as an interactive dialogue with Trump.
[03:43:58.778 --> 03:44:01.780]  To let him know whether you think he should proceed with this or not.
[03:44:01.821 --> 03:44:07.445]  And I think also that that's why you're seeing people like Tillerson go out there and say things like, oh, we want regime change.
[03:44:07.965 --> 03:44:12.609]  But you're also seeing people like Sean Spicer recently said, saying that, well, this was just a limited strike.
[03:44:13.069 --> 03:44:15.451]  I'm not sure how much they're sticking with that line.
[03:44:15.491 --> 03:44:20.315]  It really does seem like they're trying to drive home the idea that they don't want Assad in power anymore.
[03:44:20.915 --> 03:44:25.739]  And if that is the case, that's certainly something that's very different than what Trump campaigned on just a few months ago.
[03:44:27.412 --> 03:44:29.434]  I mean, we're seeing mixed messages every day.
[03:44:29.935 --> 03:44:34.439]  They say we want to get rid of Assad first, then they say the ultimate goal is regime change.
[03:44:34.479 --> 03:44:45.730]  The point I've made over and over again, Jack, is Assad has fought a brutal civil war for six years under intense international pressure every single day to step down.
[03:44:45.770 --> 03:44:48.013]  He's not just going to politely step down.
[03:44:48.633 --> 03:44:53.237]  If the United States asks him to, if Russia asks him to, it's not going to happen.
[03:44:53.477 --> 03:44:59.763]  They're going to have to completely obliterate Damascus to get rid of that regime and then what will come in in the aftermath?
[03:44:59.803 --> 03:45:00.924]  What happened in Libya?
[03:45:01.244 --> 03:45:05.408]  You've now got slaves on the streets of Libya being sold.
[03:45:05.728 --> 03:45:07.230]  This was a prosperous country.
[03:45:07.290 --> 03:45:08.971]  This was a tourist destination.
[03:45:09.332 --> 03:45:10.493]  Now it's a complete ruin.
[03:45:11.053 --> 03:45:13.495]  Refugees are streaming out of there into Europe.
[03:45:13.555 --> 03:45:18.719]  That's what caused the problem in the first place was foreign intervention, yet we're seeing it again.
[03:45:19.039 --> 03:45:23.683]  And we're seeing this cult of personality where you just, you can't even question it.
[03:45:23.763 --> 03:45:28.347]  You're off the Trump train, even if you say, well, no, we're just criticising, we're trying to influence.
[03:45:28.787 --> 03:45:33.551]  The other thing that concerns me, Jack, is we have these reports circulating again today that
[03:45:34.795 --> 03:45:41.019]  Trump was influenced to launch the strike on Syria because Ivanka was sad at seeing some pictures.
[03:45:41.399 --> 03:45:49.705]  You know, is it wise for potentially war-starting decisions to be made on the basis of how much something upsets Trump's daughter?
[03:45:51.206 --> 03:45:54.608]  You know, I think during the campaign, Ivanka Trump mostly came out there.
[03:45:54.668 --> 03:45:57.730]  She gave very scripted, very crafted statements.
[03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:59.911]  She mostly stuck on public policy issues.
[03:45:59.931 --> 03:46:01.232]  She talked about women's issues.
[03:46:01.252 --> 03:46:02.653]  She talked about children's issues.
[03:46:02.984 --> 03:46:04.224]  She talked about childcare.
[03:46:04.244 --> 03:46:06.285]  I remember that was popular with a lot of voters.
[03:46:07.085 --> 03:46:16.328]  There was no discussion of Ivanka Trump or her husband, Jared Kushner, being involved in military decisions, in military policy.
[03:46:16.528 --> 03:46:21.949]  And everybody saw the pictures of Jared Kushner traveling through Iraq over the weekend.
[03:46:21.969 --> 03:46:24.730]  And that started the hashtag, Kushner at War.
[03:46:25.210 --> 03:46:28.731]  And just a lot of people looking at this and saying, was that what we voted for?
[03:46:29.418 --> 03:46:30.120]  I think so.
[03:46:40.006 --> 03:46:51.035]  It seems, and what I'm seeing within the Trump administration, and my sources are confirming to me, that Ivanka and Kushner are siding more with Gary Cohn, with Dina Powell, people that they have personal relationships with.
[03:46:51.296 --> 03:46:57.701]  A lot of these folks have spent a lot of time in Manhattan, a lot of the time they've spent in, and a lot of them are registered Democrats.
[03:46:57.741 --> 03:46:59.502]  Gary Cohn is a registered Democrat.
[03:47:00.123 --> 03:47:06.228]  A lot of them, it's personal Manhattan socialite relationships, and it may be that they're putting that ahead of
[03:47:08.092 --> 03:47:10.053]  Of where they are, and it's hard to say.
[03:47:10.093 --> 03:47:17.996]  It's hard to say who then is influencing Ivanka, who then is influencing Jared Kushner, because they know that they have the ear of President Trump.
[03:47:18.036 --> 03:47:26.919]  So, it may not be something where Ivanka wittingly was doing this, but she may have been put up to it by people that she is associated with, who then get into deeper and deeper nefarious connections.
[03:47:26.939 --> 03:47:27.719]  It's very swampy.
[03:47:27.759 --> 03:47:28.500]  It's very swampy.
[03:47:28.520 --> 03:47:29.980]  That's the situation, basically.
[03:47:30.340 --> 03:47:33.721]  And one good point here is that Steve Bannon, early on in the election,
[03:47:35.444 --> 03:47:45.395]  Did not do very much to bring in those campaign supporters, those people who are out there supporting Trump, that supported the America First agenda, to put them into the White House.
[03:47:45.616 --> 03:47:49.520]  The White House Office of Personnel Management is being completely run by Never Trumpers right now.
[03:47:49.800 --> 03:47:53.785]  And so they're basically taking staffers from Congress, they're taking staffers from Goldman Sachs.
[03:47:54.070 --> 03:48:04.300]  They're bringing all these people in that weren't associated with Trump, that didn't want anything to do with Trump early on, and they can work to undermine him all day long and set the agenda to what they want.
[03:48:04.340 --> 03:48:07.303]  And that is what it means when people talk about the deep state.
[03:48:09.491 --> 03:48:10.171]  It's incredible.
[03:48:10.191 --> 03:48:21.617]  I mean, I'm looking at this and I'm seeing on social media, on Twitter, probably 50-50 support the escalation militarily, whether it be Syria or North Korea, 50% oppose.
[03:48:21.918 --> 03:48:31.843]  But then you look at the polls, you look at Gallup, 86% of Republicans, presumably almost all of whom were Trump supporters, supported the strike on Syria.
[03:48:32.583 --> 03:48:36.406]  I reckon it's a difference between low information and high information people.
[03:48:36.506 --> 03:48:58.644]  If you look at all the prominent Trump supporters, whether it be Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, you know, people on YouTube, Stefan Molyneux, very prominent people with large audiences, Rush Limbaugh as well, from what I recall, are opposed to this military escalation, are opposed to the strike on Syria, and yet 86% of Republicans, according to Gallup, support it.
[03:48:59.484 --> 03:49:01.506]  I reckon it's high information and low information.
[03:49:01.546 --> 03:49:04.608]  A lot of people have just been hudwinked into going along.
[03:49:05.008 --> 03:49:07.129]  Trump says it's good, so it must be good.
[03:49:07.369 --> 03:49:16.275]  They don't have a grasp, Jack, of this deep state tug-of-war that's been happening for the past three months, and it's turning into a cult of personality.
[03:49:16.316 --> 03:49:16.776]  What do you think?
[03:49:17.816 --> 03:49:29.358]  Well, I think we definitely learned through the election campaign exactly how much we can trust polls when the same organizations were saying on the morning of November 8th that Hillary Clinton had a 90% chance of winning the presidency.
[03:49:29.638 --> 03:49:41.421]  We've seen that these people have used the polls in the past as a way of basically creating a psychological operation by essentially putting false information out to make it look like something is popular when it's not, to prop up one side or the other.
[03:49:41.721 --> 03:49:45.945]  And these polls have frequently been used to craft and condition opinion, public opinion out there.
[03:49:46.185 --> 03:49:47.126]  Say, oh, you must believe it.
[03:49:47.146 --> 03:49:48.407]  You have to go on with everybody else.
[03:49:48.427 --> 03:49:50.669]  I mean, that's a human psychological condition.
[03:49:51.529 --> 03:49:57.014]  That it seems it's easier to go with the flow than it is to stand up and be a voice like people here at InfoWars do.
[03:49:57.254 --> 03:49:58.816]  And that's why I love this station so much.
[03:49:59.356 --> 03:50:00.497]  And that's what Rebel Media does.
[03:50:00.517 --> 03:50:01.278]  And we do the same thing.
[03:50:01.318 --> 03:50:03.419]  We stand up there and we ask questions.
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:06.322]  And when the media and these polls were so wrong,
[03:50:06.681 --> 03:50:23.070]  Throughout the entire election campaign, why all of a sudden, if you support Trump on this, do you also agree with the polls and these media organizations like New York Times, which is owned by Mexico, like the Washington Post, which we know is financed by the CIA through Jeff Bezos and Amazon?
[03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:28.733]  Why are we now supporting the people that we all said don't listen to because they're putting out fake news?
[03:50:30.267 --> 03:50:37.648]  And also, why are we trusting an intelligence community that was 100% wrong when they talked about Trump colluding with Russia?
[03:50:37.688 --> 03:50:39.349]  You know, everybody said, where's the evidence?
[03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:40.329]  This is just a claim.
[03:50:40.869 --> 03:50:48.250]  But yet suddenly, oh, they're totally believable when it comes to blaming Assad for the gas attack with no independent investigation whatsoever.
[03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:50.391]  The disconnect is amazing.
[03:50:50.431 --> 03:50:53.571]  We've got the next segment coming up with Jack Posobiec.
[03:50:53.611 --> 03:50:58.132]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:51:04.280 --> 03:51:07.523]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs, and today, Vladimir Putin says U.S.
[03:51:07.563 --> 03:51:13.928]  preparing to bomb Syrian capital and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[03:51:14.268 --> 03:51:17.130]  Sounds like someone's been watching MSNBC.
[03:51:17.730 --> 03:51:21.693]  Seriously, guys, we should be Putin, our differences, Assad!
[03:51:23.235 --> 03:51:25.997]  Either way, Vladimir Putin has sensationally claimed that the U.S.
[03:51:26.017 --> 03:51:31.341]  is preparing airstrikes on the Syrian capital and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[03:51:33.382 --> 03:51:33.883]  You hear that?
[03:51:33.963 --> 03:51:34.443]  That's right.
[03:51:34.583 --> 03:51:35.744]  Those are owls and crickets.
[03:51:35.944 --> 03:51:39.527]  Because the left doesn't have any more Russia, Russia, Russia!
[03:51:39.828 --> 03:51:44.952]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when tomahawk missiles hit Syria.
[03:51:45.732 --> 03:51:48.134]  The Russian leader made the astonishing claim that the U.S.
[03:51:48.174 --> 03:51:55.380]  is planning to fake chemical weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President, Sergio Mattarella.
[03:51:55.680 --> 03:51:59.003]  Well, you can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:51:59.343 --> 03:52:00.024]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[03:52:03.402 --> 03:52:11.548]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[03:52:12.528 --> 03:52:21.334]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[03:52:21.735 --> 03:52:28.679]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[03:52:28.699 --> 03:52:30.200]  We now have George Soros.
[03:52:31.281 --> 03:52:38.485]  As a goblin, on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[03:52:39.226 --> 03:52:44.368]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.

[03:54:16.038 --> 03:54:21.159]  We're back for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.339 --> 03:54:30.822]  The Borussia Dortmund team bus in Germany, that's the soccer team in Germany, has been hit by an explosion after three bombs were hidden in a roadside hedge.
[03:54:31.222 --> 03:54:35.523]  Thankfully, only one person, one of the team members, was slightly injured.
[03:54:35.543 --> 03:54:38.323]  They're looking at that as a terrorist incident.
[03:54:39.024 --> 03:54:43.945]  Over in Sweden, of course, we had the Stockholm attack last week, the truck attack.
[03:54:44.525 --> 03:54:50.749]  Basically, everybody's already forgotten about it, because it happens on an almost weekly basis in Europe now, because we're being culturally enriched.
[03:54:51.330 --> 03:54:55.873]  Jack, you visited Sweden recently to produce a documentary.
[03:54:56.393 --> 03:55:01.156]  Sweden Democrats now are the most popular party in Sweden, no surprise.
[03:55:01.196 --> 03:55:02.877]  They're the anti-immigrant party.
[03:55:03.438 --> 03:55:06.360]  After the attack in Stockholm, their approval rating has shot up.
[03:55:06.900 --> 03:55:14.285]  Do you think Sweden and other European countries still have time to reverse these disastrous policies, or is it too late?
[03:55:15.467 --> 03:55:17.510]  You know, I absolutely think they do, Paul.
[03:55:17.530 --> 03:55:25.905]  When I was there producing a documentary with Cernovich Media, we called it Invasion, How Sweden Became the Rape Capital of the West, and we saw that
[03:55:27.571 --> 03:55:39.157]  The attitudes and the opinions of the people in Sweden were still, even at that time, this was back in January, so even prior to Trump's Sweden comments that really brought this issue to the forefront, we were actually ahead of that.
[03:55:39.877 --> 03:55:44.519]  We saw opinions and attitudes were undergoing already a bit of a shift.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:47.701]  People were waking up after so many years
[03:55:48.117 --> 03:55:51.199]  And keep in mind, this has been going on since the 1970s in Sweden.
[03:55:51.420 --> 03:55:57.905]  It's only been in the last two or three years that it's really turned on at such a high clip after this current migrant crisis.
[03:55:58.385 --> 03:56:06.191]  So people with so many so quickly flooding into Sweden from the third world, from the Middle East at this time.
[03:56:06.251 --> 03:56:08.973]  Sweden already is one of the least populated countries in the world.
[03:56:09.013 --> 03:56:10.094]  I think it ranks like 120th out of that.
[03:56:11.560 --> 03:56:15.541]  People are now looking around saying our country does not look like it was before.
[03:56:16.082 --> 03:56:18.983]  Now Sweden is being overrun with these rapes.
[03:56:19.023 --> 03:56:26.625]  There was a live stream rape of a Swedish girl by three Afghans the same week that we were there filming the documentary.
[03:56:27.126 --> 03:56:28.966]  Facebook, it was on Facebook live streamed.
[03:56:29.026 --> 03:56:38.790]  It's actually not even being... So Facebook won't allow the live stream of that video to be released to the Swedish authorities because they're saying it's someone's private property and they shouldn't allow
[03:56:40.150 --> 03:56:40.891]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56:58.802 --> 03:57:01.244]  And whether or not they have a chance left, I think that they do.
[03:57:01.624 --> 03:57:08.087]  I think that if Sweden starts to roll back some of these, the main drivers of what's bringing people there, that they will start going away.
[03:57:08.147 --> 03:57:12.149]  Sweden is handing money, hand over fist to these people for absolutely nothing.
[03:57:12.390 --> 03:57:13.330]  That's the reason they're there.
[03:57:13.530 --> 03:57:18.693]  You talk to these people, they're not from Syria, they're not fleeing some sort of refugee humanitarian crisis.
[03:57:18.893 --> 03:57:26.117]  They're from all across the Middle East, and they know that the average Swede can't tell somebody apart, they say if you're Arab, you're Arab, if you're brown, you're brown, to an extent.
[03:57:26.377 --> 03:57:27.598]  Okay, we've got about 30 seconds left, Jack.
[03:57:27.618 --> 03:57:31.621]  Just tell people where they can find you on Twitter and where they can find your work on the internet.
[03:57:50.151 --> 03:57:52.592]  Yes, if you want to go to Twitter, it's at Jack Posobiec.
[03:57:52.933 --> 03:57:56.094]  J-A-C-K-P-O-S-O-B-I-E-C on YouTube.
[03:57:56.294 --> 03:57:58.676]  It's Rebel Media, the YouTube page.
[03:57:58.916 --> 03:58:00.557]  We put out very concise videos.
[03:58:00.597 --> 03:58:08.261]  We try to break down stuff extremely quickly for everybody so that you can get something that's very complicated, but done in a very quick and easy manner.
[03:58:08.341 --> 03:58:09.602]  Paul, I really appreciate it.
[03:58:09.622 --> 03:58:12.203]  A lot of help lately, and I appreciate you having me on today.
[03:58:13.294 --> 03:58:14.075]  Okay, it's a pleasure.
[03:58:14.115 --> 03:58:15.996]  We'll get you back on the show soon.
[03:58:16.036 --> 03:58:19.058]  There goes Jack, and we're going to finish off the Alex Jones Show now.
[03:58:19.098 --> 03:58:20.319]  We've got about 20 seconds left.
[03:58:20.679 --> 03:58:24.002]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, get the products.
[03:58:24.062 --> 03:58:26.243]  We're under constant attack by the media.
[03:58:26.583 --> 03:58:30.246]  YouTube demonetization, AdRoll kicking us off.
[03:58:30.646 --> 03:58:32.528]  We're trying to survive and thrive.
[03:58:32.628 --> 03:58:35.550]  Please support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:36.891]  That is going to wrap it up.
[03:58:36.951 --> 03:58:38.672]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:39.012 --> 03:58:39.913]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[03:58:45.191 --> 03:58:49.185]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.357 --> 03:59:01.863]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false flag, and more are on the way.
[03:59:02.003 --> 03:59:15.033]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus.
[03:59:15.513 --> 03:59:22.855]  Where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[03:59:22.955 --> 03:59:38.159]  Putin went on to compare the situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction, which may indicate that he believes the US is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda.
[03:59:38.380 --> 03:59:43.361]  Meanwhile, the Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons.
[03:59:43.661 --> 03:59:49.206]  And any further attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable.
[03:59:49.446 --> 03:59:52.449]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
