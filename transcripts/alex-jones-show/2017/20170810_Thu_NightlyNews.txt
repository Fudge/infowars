[00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:24.529]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.890]  It's Thursday, August 10th, 2017.
[00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.111]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.431]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:39.176]  Tonight, the witch hunt against President Trump and members of his campaign intensifies with the raid on Paul Manafort's home and others.
[00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:45.139]  Word has come in that the FBI conducted a raid of the former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort's home.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.722]  Next, rumors surface of Hillary Clinton's female investigation being reopened.
[00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:53.020]  What, like with a cloth or something?
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.540]  Well, don't.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.043]  Meanwhile, Hillary is about to jet off to Canada.
[00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:02.469]  Then, as tensions build in North Korea, Americans brace at the brink of nuclear war.
[00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.434]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:13.596]  As I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power.
[00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:18.562]  The likes of which this world has never seen before.
[00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:23.688]  In fake news, as Brian Williams says, our job tonight actually is to scare people to death.
[00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:27.012]  All that plus more in tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.763]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:57.034]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:57.794 --> 00:02:05.684]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:15.235]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:30.701]  And so I set out working with the top formulator in the country to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.444]  Known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:38.346]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.707]  We're getting results.
[00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:46.932]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:49.194]  Because of you praying for the broadcast.
[00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:53.077]  Because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:59.010]  So please, secure your caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:21.729]  You remember when Russia was the biggest story going?
[00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:26.430]  It was Russia every night, Russia this, Russia that, Trump-Russia here, Trump-Russia there.
[00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.053]  Well, that has kind of faded off into the distance, that nothing burger that produced about four nothing burger of hearings and testimonies that
[00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:38.654]  Produced nothing burgers on CNN.
[00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:39.555]  Nobody believes it.
[00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:40.355]  Nobody's buying it.
[00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:52.623]  So the whole Russia thing in the mainstream media and that whole narrative of Maxine Waters talking about the Russian clan, Russia stealing our election, Trump's a Russian agent, Russian bots elected Trump.
[00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:56.305]  That all kind of faded off into the distance, that nothing burger.
[00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.366]  Nobody wanted to eat it.
[00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:03.790]  But they're still pursuing the witch hunt against President Trump and his cohorts.
[00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.671]  It goes on.
[00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:18.869]  Now, one of Trump's lawyers has responded, accusing Robert Mueller's special counsel of gross abuse of the judicial process for conducting the raid at Manafort's home in July.
[00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.172]  John Dowd, the Trump lawyer, also asserted that the July 26 raid was employed for its shock value to try to intimidate Mr. Manafort.
[00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:31.814]  These methods are normally found and employed in Russia, not America, said John Dowd.
[00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:33.154]  That's funny.
[00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:40.218]  I wonder if the real Russian collusion isn't with this special counsel team and their methods of this witch hunt against Trump.
[00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:47.542]  The raid shows that Mueller is looking into other possible criminal activity besides campaign collusion with the Russian government.
[00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:48.682]  Exactly.
[00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:55.946]  They couldn't find anything there, so they're looking for any other petty little crime on a tax form or on a financial form that they can get him for.
[00:04:56.326 --> 00:05:02.089]  Dowd called the raid a gross abuse of the judicial process while questioning the legality of Mueller's search warrant.
[00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:12.059]  He said that Mueller misrepresented the necessity of the warrant to a federal judge raising a host of issues involving the accuracy of the warrant application.
[00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:17.725]  So, maybe it's Mueller's process that needs to be looked into.
[00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:19.908]  Maybe it's the Democrats colluding with Mueller.
[00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:21.569]  Of course, we know that's what's going on.
[00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.772]  But that's not going to stop Mueller.
[00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.951]  As he's now going after family members of Paul Manafort.
[00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:31.352]  Fed sought cooperation from Manafort's son-in-law.
[00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:40.275]  Investigators approached Jeffrey Yohei, who has partnered in business deals with Manafort earlier this summer, setting off real waves in Manafort's orbit.
[00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:41.356]  One of the people said,
[00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:47.518]  Yeah, real waves because of, they're amazed at how egregious this witch hunt is, how illegal it is.
[00:05:47.998 --> 00:05:51.939]  Another of these people said investigators are trying to get into Manafort's head.
[00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.580]  Well yeah, it'd bother me too.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.881]  The probe has accelerated in recent weeks according to one of the people familiar with it.
[00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:01.965]  They can't find anything with Russia, so they're looking for anything else they can possibly find.
[00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:07.631]  And meanwhile, this entire thing, Paul Manafort is yet to be accused of any wrongdoing.
[00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:11.535]  So they have no knock raids on his house, hasn't actually been accused of anything.
[00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:16.140]  So again, this is deciding on a conviction and then going after the evidence.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.405]  People close to Manafort reiterated Wednesday that he has no plans to become a cooperating witness.
[00:06:21.476 --> 00:06:22.897]  And they're going to use that to demonize him.
[00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:25.439]  Folks, it's because he didn't witness anything.
[00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:26.700]  There was nothing to witness.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:37.328]  The approach involves finding a suspected crime, false statements on tax returns, loan applications, for example, and then offering leniency on prosecution in exchange for cooperation.
[00:06:37.368 --> 00:06:43.772]  So they think they're going to find something little and then get them to cooperate on the big Russian collusion with Trump to bring Trump down.
[00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:47.015]  Except they're not going to find anything and there is no Russian collusion.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.690]  Now, this just shows you, really, the arrogance, I think, that anti-Trumpers have, and the confidence that they think they have in this.
[00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.514]  From Bloomberg, Trump's legal team is no match for Mueller's.
[00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:08.304]  As Mueller adds experienced prosecutors and broadens his investigation, Trump's legal team still appears disorganized and understaffed.
[00:07:08.624 --> 00:07:09.825]  Folks, again, there's nothing there.
[00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:11.786]  This is all assuming there's something there when there's nothing there.
[00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.327]  And the main thing here is going to be the
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:47.392]  Potential conflicts of interest on the side of Mueller and that's what really needs to be looked at here and we'll get into that More right now actually as this was published a from the Daily Beast.
[00:07:47.432 --> 00:07:48.073]  I tried to get the
[00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.510]  Author of this to come on, she'd want to.
[00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.472]  The no-nonsense judge who could decide Trump's fate.
[00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:59.036]  Judge Beryl Howell might be on her way from behind-the-seams player to household name.
[00:07:59.677 --> 00:08:04.841]  Federal court rules indicate that she signed off on Mueller's request to assemble a grand jury.
[00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:06.302]  Oh, so she was responsible for that.
[00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:10.886]  A highly secretive gathering of about two dozen people in Washington's E. Barrett...
[00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:17.352]  Pretty man courthouse that will grill witnesses and demand Trump's associates documents.
[00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:18.973]  There is no wrongdoing.
[00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:23.657]  They found nothing, yet they're grilling people and demanding Trump associate documents.
[00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:24.838]  Folks, this is so illegal.
[00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:27.961]  Honestly, Trump is so tolerant of this, it amazes me.
[00:08:28.422 --> 00:08:34.046]  Howell will be the umpire-in-chief deciding whether or not Trump's allies, lawyers, can quash subpoenas.
[00:08:34.892 --> 00:08:35.673]  You know how that's going to go.
[00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:38.636]  She worked for Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:41.078]  Oh, yeah, no conflict of interest there.
[00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:43.861]  Howell's previous work for Senator Patrick Leahy.
[00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.723]  Oh, he's a never-Trumper.
[00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:48.005]  No conflict of interest there.
[00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:52.669]  And then says that Howell is like Mueller.
[00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.096]  Saying he wouldn't ask for it unless he had been more than enough evidence to justify it and she wouldn't have granted it unless he did.
[00:09:00.597 --> 00:09:05.121]  So, they're saying that they have evidence that justifies this grand jury.
[00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.502]  Well, let's see it.
[00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:09.084]  Has anyone seen this evidence?
[00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.967]  We're a year into this thing and no evidence.
[00:09:12.007 --> 00:09:12.648]  Still nothing.
[00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:15.811]  The DNC won't even turn over their servers, folks.
[00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:16.772]  Howell
[00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:18.133]  Guess what?
[00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:19.654]  Some of those findings are sticking up for Google.
[00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:19.714]  Oh.
[00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:40.062]  Is anything not polarized in politics right now though?
[00:09:40.462 --> 00:09:44.843]  Trump would struggle to make any case that Howell's relationship with Weissman could be grounds for recusal.
[00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.584]  How about the fact she's a Clinton employee?
[00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:47.644]  How about appointee?
[00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:49.405]  How about the fact she's an Obama appointee?
[00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:53.846]  That's, that's the conflict of interest right there.
[00:09:54.186 --> 00:09:59.188]  A former federal prosecutor said the president's lawyers could still ask the judge to recuse herself.
[00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:06.534]  But you know she won't do that even though she has relations with Loretta Lynch and the Clintons and Obama and the Democrats and Patrick Leahy.
[00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:08.415]  She's not going to recuse herself.
[00:10:08.535 --> 00:10:09.355]  Why would she?
[00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.937]  This is about justice and Russia.
[00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:23.186]  So there's one liberal judge, another liberal judge, coming after Trump for nothing, looking for anything they can to try to delegitimize President Trump, who's just making America great again.
[00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:23.706]  How dare he?
[00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:28.787]  More liberal judges are shooting down Trump's action against sanctuary cities.
[00:10:29.247 --> 00:10:29.607]  A U.S.
[00:10:29.647 --> 00:10:35.868]  district judge in Austin has rejected an effort by Texas to have a law that would punish so-called sanctuary cities.
[00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:38.069]  That's right, folks.
[00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:40.436]  Gotta put non-Americans first.
[00:10:40.976 --> 00:10:41.256]  U.S.
[00:10:41.297 --> 00:10:46.478]  Judge Sam Sparks, appointed under Republican President George W. Bush, dismissed the case.
[00:10:47.078 --> 00:10:54.620]  That is Senate Bill 4, which calls for jailing of police chiefs, sheriffs, and possibly frontline officers who failed to cooperate with U.S.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.760]  immigration officials, because that's what they found.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.521]  The measure also allows police to ask about immigration status during a lawful detention.
[00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.661]  Yeah, why would you not have that?
[00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:04.742]  But then the ACLU comes in.
[00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:12.056]  And says the Texas suit was a farce aimed at distracting attention from the harm that would come from the bill SB4.
[00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:22.316]  The ACLU's Edgar Saldivar said, this is a significant blow to the state and its legal posturing has only resulted in wasted taxpayer money.
[00:11:22.796 --> 00:11:24.617]  Wasted taxpayer money, folks.
[00:11:25.137 --> 00:11:27.479]  He cites wasted taxpayer money.
[00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:30.341]  How about the wasted taxpayer money that goes to non-citizens?
[00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:36.585]  How about the wasted taxpayer money that goes every day towards this Trump-Russia probe that has proved nothing?
[00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:38.246]  Millions of dollars spent there.
[00:11:38.746 --> 00:11:40.809]  Now you've got another liberal attorney.
[00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:45.255]  Left-wing organizations behind lawsuit challenging Trump's transgender military ban.
[00:11:45.315 --> 00:11:54.888]  Two left-wing organizations and leading members of the anti-Trump resistance are behind the lawsuit challenging President Trump's transgender military ban, filed in federal court on Wednesday.
[00:11:55.799 --> 00:12:06.142]  This is the GLBTQ, I can't even keep up with this, Advocates and Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed the lawsuit challenging the President's new policy.
[00:12:06.522 --> 00:12:14.885]  The organization's claim that preventing transgender persons from openly serving in the military, which was policy until Obama in 2016, what do you know?
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.542]  is unconstitutional.
[00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:27.251]  So it's been constitutional all these years, but now these George Soros-backed law firms want to say it's unconstitutional.
[00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:27.792]  Here's an idea.
[00:12:28.913 --> 00:12:35.360]  If you can't check man or woman on your application to get into the military, maybe you don't belong in the military.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.561]  Just a thought.
[00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:45.007]  Now this is a story that really needs to be dissected, I think, by Trump himself.
[00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:47.311]  From Axios is Sam Jane.
[00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:49.494]  The Committee to Save America.
[00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:58.566]  The generals, the New Yorkers, and Republican congressional leaders see themselves as an unofficial committee to protect Trump and the nation from disaster.
[00:12:59.527 --> 00:13:02.228]  No, that's what we elected Trump for.
[00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:05.289]  The disaster is the government.
[00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.850]  Trump is who we elected to save us from the disaster.
[00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:15.233]  If you see a guy about to stab someone with a knife, you don't need to huddle to decide to grab the knife.
[00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:16.434]  One top official told us.
[00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:17.414]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:20.588]  But that's what they're doing with the impeachment push.
[00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:21.948]  They're impeaching for Trump.
[00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.829]  They're about to stab Trump in the back, and they're just letting him get away with it.
[00:13:25.849 --> 00:13:26.989]  They're just letting them operate.
[00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:27.749]  They're tolerating it.
[00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.050]  White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, National Security Advisor H.R.
[00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.172]  McMaster, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressed a sense of duty to help steer Trump.
[00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.752]  They want to steer Trump.
[00:13:38.912 --> 00:13:41.973]  They want to steer the country, not the republic that elected Trump.
[00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:48.663]  And then you have Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, who was appointed by McMaster.
[00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:49.865]  We'll get more to her in a second.
[00:13:51.351 --> 00:14:00.259]  Almost all could move against the president if special counsel Bob Mueller finds crimes or the president succumbs to radical instincts.
[00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:14.152]  That would mean firing him for the waste of time and taxpayer dollars that the very liberals are saying comes from bills that want to protect American cities from sanctuary cities, that put non-Americans first.
[00:14:14.172 --> 00:14:17.495]  I mean, this is so backwards, I can't even wrap my head around it.
[00:14:18.564 --> 00:14:22.326]  They say their main function is getting real facts to the President.
[00:14:23.187 --> 00:14:24.768]  Who's deciding who the real facts are?
[00:14:24.788 --> 00:14:27.089]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:33.733]  And then they use the example, if Trump had plunged ahead with his thirst for a trade war, folks, it's the Democrats that launched a trade war!
[00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:42.144]  I get so mad covering this stuff because the lies are so outrageous and people fall for this stuff.
[00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:43.265]  Be smart.
[00:14:43.345 --> 00:14:51.688]  One of the biggest dangers to Trump's reign is that if Mueller acts or public support plummets, he suddenly could be lonely in his White House.
[00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:52.368]  You know what, Trump?
[00:14:53.499 --> 00:14:54.339]  Here's the thing about that.
[00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.040]  Trump, you should feel lonely in this White House.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.540]  So you know what?
[00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:57.501]  F them.
[00:14:58.101 --> 00:14:58.721]  F all of them.
[00:14:59.122 --> 00:15:01.102]  F anyone who wants to control your White House.
[00:15:01.423 --> 00:15:02.803]  F anyone who wants to steer you.
[00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:04.724]  F anyone who says they know the facts and you don't.
[00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.925]  You know who you need to be looking at, President Trump?
[00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:08.446]  The American people that elected you.
[00:15:08.646 --> 00:15:11.707]  The tens of thousands of people that line up to see you speak.
[00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:13.548]  You're not lonely, President Trump.
[00:15:13.728 --> 00:15:17.350]  You're lonely in the White House because the White House is a bunch of communist traitors!
[00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.871]  You're not lonely, President Trump, in America.
[00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:26.614]  You are beloved more than anything else right now in America and the world by people that actually have a beating heart and a mind that can think.
[00:15:27.455 --> 00:15:28.596]  So do not be confused.
[00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.976]  Do not feel lonely, President Trump.
[00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:33.518]  That's just the traitors and the communists in the White House that want you to feel that way.
[00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:44.043]  So I say remove yourself from there and just continue to go out on the scene and show the public how you have tens of thousands of people that will show up for you night in and night out to show their support.
[00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:45.264]  No other president could have that.
[00:15:45.324 --> 00:15:46.585]  Now, Dina Powell,
[00:15:47.867 --> 00:16:09.956]  A suspected leaker who was asked to join by McMaster, served under Bush, speaks Arabic fluently, traveled often to the Middle East during the Bush administration to defend his policies in the region, a staunch Republican, and it was maybe perhaps Ivanka Trump that also wanted to bring her in.
[00:16:09.976 --> 00:16:15.798]  So, there's Habib Powell, whatever you want to think about that, the Egyptian-born,
[00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:30.142]  Appointed by McMaster, who now it's being reported the Center for Security Policy has called for the firing of McMaster for disloyal and subversive behavior.
[00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:32.745]  So it's all coming full circle.
[00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:34.726]  It's time for Trump's
[00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:37.260]  True team to act on this.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.120]  Trump needs to act.
[00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:44.364]  But, you know, he's too busy trying to bring jobs back, trying to save the economy, trying to get fair trade.
[00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:48.287]  And the Democrats are just stabbing him in the back this entire time.
[00:16:48.647 --> 00:16:49.688]  And the Republicans as well.
[00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:56.552]  If such misconduct is tolerated, Trump voters will have unknowingly elected President McMaster.
[00:16:56.572 --> 00:17:00.855]  Well, it seems like maybe that is already the case, but...
[00:17:02.697 --> 00:17:06.340]  Is it McMaster who's the one that's trying to get real facts to the President?
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.642]  Is that McMaster's role?
[00:17:07.682 --> 00:17:09.223]  Is that what we elected McMaster?
[00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:10.905]  Oh yeah, we didn't elect McMaster.
[00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:15.789]  McMaster last week fired Ezra Cohen Watnick, Senior Intelligence Advisor.
[00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:19.432]  The week before he fired Derek Harvey, the Middle East Advisor.
[00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:23.676]  And in July he fired Rich Higgins, which if you read Rich Higgins,
[00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:25.178]  I don't know.
[00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:49.574]  I think that he got Rice that clearance so that Rice can get in there and try to get inside information about what's going on.
[00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:52.597]  Try to get clearance into some of the stuff to figure out what's going on.
[00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:57.841]  Are they really looking into reopening the Hillary Clinton email investigation?
[00:17:57.861 --> 00:18:00.003]  We're going to get more into that in the other side.
[00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:04.426]  But today, President Trump did see a boost in his popularity.
[00:18:04.867 --> 00:18:08.810]  The Daily Presidential Tracking Poll, according to Rasmussen, saw President Trump
[00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:15.312]  Get a major boost from what was a low just a few days ago.
[00:18:15.372 --> 00:18:24.458]  And what I noticed about this, now 45% who approve of Trump, I think that's what it was.
[00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:28.220]  But regardless, he sees the major boost again.
[00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:30.722]  What was the last time he saw this major boost?
[00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:32.203]  When he dropped the Moab.
[00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:41.995]  So, whenever Trump's ratings go down, it seems like he has a show of military force to get them back up.
[00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:49.081]  I don't know if he's doing that intentionally, or unintentionally, or consciously, or subconsciously, or what that even indicates, but that seems to be the case.
[00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:56.127]  Trump's ratings go down, he flexes America's military might, and then his ratings go up the next day.
[00:18:56.487 --> 00:19:02.212]  Let me tell you something, his ratings would skyrocket through the roof if he reopened the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
[00:19:02.252 --> 00:19:03.033]  More on that on the other side.
[00:19:04.229 --> 00:19:15.894]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:16.474 --> 00:19:18.555]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:21.556]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:21.996 --> 00:19:23.197]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:23.937 --> 00:19:32.346]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:34.628]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:38.933]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:46.180]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[00:19:47.304 --> 00:19:47.424]  Yeah.
[00:20:09.423 --> 00:20:09.923]  When it comes
[00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:38.916]  You owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:47.240]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:54.104]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.963]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:03.808]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslive.com.
[00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:08.191]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:09.993]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:12.794]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:12.994 --> 00:21:17.095]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:17.135 --> 00:21:30.320]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.561]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:32.941 --> 00:21:35.762]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:35.782 --> 00:21:36.742]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:37.322 --> 00:21:39.764]  That's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:40.124 --> 00:21:42.526]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:42.966 --> 00:21:45.808]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:47.469]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:47.709 --> 00:21:52.972]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:53.553]  Again.
[00:21:54.293 --> 00:22:00.035]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:22:00.435 --> 00:22:04.757]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:09.298]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:13.942]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[00:22:13.962 --> 00:22:32.382]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:32.702 --> 00:22:35.525]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:37.586]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:37.947 --> 00:22:39.949]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:52.019]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:55.142]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:13.752 --> 00:23:26.156]  Well folks, Sheriff Arpaio is being targeted by the deep state right now and by Obama holdovers and this is something that's not fair.
[00:23:27.997 --> 00:23:29.358]  And more people are realizing that.
[00:23:29.918 --> 00:23:35.900]  Here's a clip from Fox News wondering who is in charge of the Department of Justice.
[00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:43.194]  A federal judge wants the State Department to find Hillary Clinton's emails on Benghazi.
[00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:45.416]  He's ordering new searches.
[00:23:45.817 --> 00:23:47.138]  Judge Napolitano is with us.
[00:23:47.178 --> 00:23:47.899]  What do you make of this?
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:57.128]  The actual searches that are being ordered here are searches of State Department servers for the emails of three of her closest aides.
[00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.492]  The State Department and the Justice Department.
[00:24:01.187 --> 00:24:02.548]  Now imagine, imagine...
[00:24:15.718 --> 00:24:26.010]  If, when they raided Paul Manafort's house, they found smashed servers, smashed cell phones and smashed laptops like they did when they were investigating Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.151]  Let's go back to Napolitano.
[00:24:31.957 --> 00:24:33.338]  This is the world turned upside down.
[00:24:33.658 --> 00:24:37.021]  No, I thought the judge had ordered, go search, go find him.
[00:24:37.201 --> 00:24:46.188]  The Obama appointed judge rejected the argument of the Trump State Department and said, you will look for these emails.
[00:24:46.648 --> 00:24:50.712]  It is the Trump State Department that said, we don't want to look for Hillary's emails.
[00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:56.056]  So my argument is, why are they making the same argument that they blasted during the campaign?
[00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:58.658]  Well, I don't know the answer to your question, but you tell me this.
[00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.199]  Is this a step forward?
[00:25:00.379 --> 00:25:03.300]  So Napolitano is confused as we all are.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.741]  Why isn't the DOJ moving against Clinton?
[00:25:05.761 --> 00:25:10.283]  It's an area of emails that has never been looked for before.
[00:25:10.703 --> 00:25:22.207]  It is the emails that Mrs. Clinton sent to her personal aides and that they sent to her that did not show up on the ones she decided to surrender to the State Department.
[00:25:22.588 --> 00:25:27.069]  So in order to find them, they're going for State Department servers which have captured 100% of these aides
[00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.651]  Yeah.
[00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:30.672]  It's really an odd thing.
[00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:53.028]  It's really an odd thing, and again, I don't know what Trump's move here is.
[00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:54.909]  I feel like Trump's got something up his sleeve.
[00:25:54.949 --> 00:26:08.479]  I really feel like there's something going on here, behind the scenes, because to be so tolerant of this witch hunt against you, when you have Manafort getting his house raided, your family getting under attack, I mean, it's just absurd.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.802]  They keep widening the scope, they keep spending more money.
[00:26:13.953 --> 00:26:21.458]  But meanwhile, you've got all of this evidence against Hillary Clinton, and now you've got Sheriff Joe that is being persecuted.
[00:26:22.138 --> 00:26:25.460]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, why is Obama still running the Justice Department?
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.602]  DOJ denied Arpaio his right to a jury trial.
[00:26:29.793 --> 00:26:34.877]  So just like Judge Napolitano is wondering, what is going on at the DOJ?
[00:26:35.257 --> 00:26:54.713]  After being convicted of criminal misdemeanor contempt because of a liberal judge, unconstitutional judge, former Mayor of Copa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio continues to attack Obama holdovers in the Trump Justice Department who are seeking to imprison him for enforcing the very immigration laws President Trump has sworn to enforce.
[00:26:54.793 --> 00:26:57.735]  Which is just basic, you know, having a border,
[00:26:58.629 --> 00:26:59.749]  You know, just law, really.
[00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:00.790]  It's just basic law.
[00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:05.971]  Ironically, and this is from an exclusive that Jerry Corsi got.
[00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:21.136]  Ironically, this is a revenge prosecution in which Obama holdovers in the Justice Department are seeking to enforce a court order that socialist La Raza lawyer Tom Perez imposed on me because I refused to make Maricopa County into a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.
[00:27:22.301 --> 00:27:29.609]  How can the public integrity section of the Justice Department prosecute me when all I did was to honestly enforce the immigration laws currently on the books?
[00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:30.049]  Bingo!
[00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:32.893]  And that's all Trump wants too, but the left is upset with that.
[00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:43.985]  How is it that Attorney General Sessions ignored a letter to Sheriff Arpaio's attorneys, had hand delivered to his office, when all Sheriff Arpaio requested was that the Justice Department consider
[00:27:45.123 --> 00:27:49.967]  Insisting the public integrity section, which would allow him his right as a U.S.
[00:27:49.987 --> 00:27:52.328]  citizen to a trial before a jury of his peers.
[00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:55.551]  So here he is obeying the law.
[00:27:56.351 --> 00:27:57.973]  They come after him for obeying the law.
[00:27:58.373 --> 00:28:06.639]  He wants the law followed with a jury of his peers, constitutional law, and he doesn't even get that, but he does get ignored by the Justice Department.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.861]  Now, U.S.
[00:28:09.942 --> 00:28:11.583]  District Judge Susan Bolton
[00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:18.806]  This is a Clinton appointee is the one who is seeing this.
[00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:24.032]  So more Democrat collusion here, folks.
[00:28:24.072 --> 00:28:25.353]  So this is another witch hunt.
[00:28:26.229 --> 00:28:34.978]  This one is against Sheriff Arpaio, and he's upset with the lack of response that he's gotten from Jeff Sessions and from President Trump.
[00:28:35.018 --> 00:28:40.443]  I'm yet to hear President Trump on that, and President Trump is a big supporter of Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:45.749]  Now, President Trump came out and made a statement today about Democrat collusion in Ukraine.
[00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:47.070]  Here's that statement.
[00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:52.773]  Democrats colluded on the Ukraine, so they colluded.
[00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:59.294]  And then when you get down to it, why isn't the FBI looking at the DNC server?
[00:28:59.594 --> 00:29:05.695]  You have a server that they refuse, the Democrats refuse to give to the FBI.
[00:29:06.475 --> 00:29:12.296]  Now, I don't know how the FBI can investigate something if the DNC, the Democrats, refuse to give the server.
[00:29:12.396 --> 00:29:12.936]  Or smash it.
[00:29:13.056 --> 00:29:16.017]  So we have an investigation of something that never took place.
[00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:20.754]  And all I say is work with them, because this is an event that never took place.
[00:29:21.614 --> 00:29:27.835]  And now you have Trump calling out the collusion with Ukraine, and this is something that Lee Stranahan is very happy about.
[00:29:28.196 --> 00:29:29.736]  Lee Stranahan broke this open.
[00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:39.078]  He is trying to raise awareness on this for President Trump, how the Obama administration and the FBI was involved in Ukrainian election interference.
[00:29:39.118 --> 00:29:40.498]  That is cut and dry.
[00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:42.799]  And yet here they are.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.141]  And he's got it all listed out.
[00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:46.822]  Go ahead and just go through that timeline, folks.
[00:29:47.323 --> 00:29:49.084]  He's got it all listed out.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:50.625]  Cut and dry.
[00:29:50.645 --> 00:29:56.310]  Barack Obama and the FBI trying to meddle in Ukraine's election.
[00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:05.237]  And yet here they are, the witch hunt against Trump, saying Russia meddled in our elections.
[00:30:05.297 --> 00:30:08.561]  A total fake news narrative.
[00:30:09.021 --> 00:30:10.863]  You want to talk about fake news, folks?
[00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:13.106]  It doesn't get much worse than Brian Williams.
[00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:27.282]  I don't even believe what Brian Williams said on TV, but these liberal news anchors like Mika Brzezinski and Jake Tapper and Cuomo over at CNN, they just keep opening up their big mouths.
[00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:29.985]  It's like a competition of who's the dumbest liberal on TV.
[00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:32.228]  Jake Tapper may have taken the cake with this one.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:43.731]  Our job tonight actually is to scare people to death on this subject so the talk isn't as free as it is about a preemptive or surgical military strike.
[00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:50.939]  Brian Williams' job is to scare people to death?
[00:30:52.741 --> 00:30:53.802]  Wait, wait, wait, Brian Williams?
[00:30:54.901 --> 00:30:56.321]  I think he's just confused, folks.
[00:30:56.481 --> 00:31:04.644]  Let's not forget that Brian Williams has been very confused in the past as a news anchor, citing memories of being under sniper fire.
[00:31:04.664 --> 00:31:07.744]  I believe he was on a jet or something.
[00:31:08.004 --> 00:31:12.205]  No, he was on a helicopter, I think it was, when he was being ambushed overseas.
[00:31:12.546 --> 00:31:13.886]  Yeah, he completely made that up.
[00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:16.340]  He completely made that up.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.522]  A total fake news liar on the air.
[00:31:18.902 --> 00:31:20.864]  So MSNBC offers him a job.
[00:31:20.924 --> 00:31:22.005]  It's just like Megyn Kelly.
[00:31:22.025 --> 00:31:27.469]  You know, you go from NBC and then you go to the junk heap, the scrap heap, the boneyard at MSNBC.
[00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:34.335]  But Jake Tapper, he just cannot have this free and open talk about somebody finally doing something about North Korea.
[00:31:34.655 --> 00:31:36.937]  You know, I've had the same stance on this forever.
[00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:38.098]  I'm a non-interventionist.
[00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:43.183]  I don't want to see another expansion of war because of the military-industrial complex and fake news.
[00:31:43.982 --> 00:31:51.792]  But all of this intervening, all over the world, of all these oppressive regimes and everything, nobody ever did anything about North Korea.
[00:31:52.112 --> 00:31:53.754]  Nobody ever said anything about North Korea.
[00:31:54.055 --> 00:31:57.599]  Bill Clinton is responsible for getting North Korea nuclear capable.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.724]  Barack Obama said North Korea didn't have nukes just a few years ago.
[00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:15.437]  So now Trump is actually wanting to do something about it, standing up to a communist dictator, and the left can't stand it, and then Brian Williams says that his job is to scare people to death.
[00:32:15.698 --> 00:32:21.403]  You know, in our final seconds here, guys, if you want to pull up my Twitter, I just want to point this out.
[00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:30.789]  This clown, Scott Dorkin, puts out a poll on Twitter that says, who's a better president, Trump or Obama?
[00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:36.950]  And then has a little note after that that says, thank you, Trump, you're an idiot for thinking you could even compare yourself.
[00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.330]  Sad.
[00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.530]  I caught this poll.
[00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.130]  Barack had 61%.
[00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.291]  There were 11,000 votes.
[00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:46.632]  Within two hours, I took this poll over and got Barack down to 52.
[00:32:46.752 --> 00:32:47.772]  Trump was surging.
[00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:53.519]  Trump was about to win the poll, just like what happened with George Takei's poll, so you know what Scott Dorkin did?
[00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:55.161]  He deleted the poll.
[00:32:55.701 --> 00:33:02.430]  He tried to rig the poll by blocking big Trump supporters on Twitter, and by dissing Trump in the tweet, but he still lost!
[00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:05.992]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:34:43.892 --> 00:34:45.813]  And this part is most important.

[00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:02.677]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:03.557 --> 00:35:07.938]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:08.038 --> 00:35:18.961]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:19.141 --> 00:35:24.065]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:26.688]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:26.748 --> 00:35:28.249]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:28.449 --> 00:35:31.312]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:36.096]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:36.136 --> 00:35:40.260]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:47.683]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:47.803 --> 00:35:49.223]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:49.423 --> 00:35:50.163]  This is so key.
[00:35:50.403 --> 00:35:54.705]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:54.725 --> 00:35:56.826]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:56.966 --> 00:36:00.407]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:03.789 --> 00:36:09.953]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:13.215]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:18.758]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:19.178 --> 00:36:25.142]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:25.302 --> 00:36:28.424]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:28.564 --> 00:36:30.045]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:30.225 --> 00:36:34.368]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:34.548 --> 00:36:37.431]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:37.511 --> 00:36:39.072]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:39.172 --> 00:36:42.355]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:44.957]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:45.237 --> 00:36:46.198]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:46.298 --> 00:36:49.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:49.780]  I take this.
[00:36:49.901 --> 00:36:51.582]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:51.702 --> 00:36:53.664]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:54.484 --> 00:36:55.264]  We fight the Globals!
[00:36:55.284 --> 00:36:56.145]  We fight the New World Order!
[00:36:56.425 --> 00:37:03.028]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:14.373]  The reason why I wanted to bring up that story about those Twitter polls was not to talk about myself.
[00:37:14.533 --> 00:37:18.735]  It's to show you how Trump is actually popular, folks.
[00:37:18.895 --> 00:37:20.416]  All of these polls are fake polls.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:37.848]  Okay, Trump is so popular that it takes two hours for us to take a rigged poll on Twitter against Trump and spin it pro-Trump and then get the liberals to delete it because they're so scared that their precious little narrative that Trump is unpopular is going to be destroyed with the fact that he is popular.
[00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:39.807]  So I just wanted to point that out.
[00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:43.689]  And I can't believe I completely forgot to mention this.
[00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:57.278]  I think the reason why they're coming after Sheriff Arpaio, and I think it's obvious, is because he was the one that had the gonads to do the real investigation into Barack Obama's fake birth certificate, and then proved that it was a fake birth certificate.
[00:37:57.798 --> 00:38:04.323]  And just like the liberals delete fake polls on Twitter to try to make Trump look bad, CNN had to fire Jeff Lord.
[00:38:05.443 --> 00:38:08.266]  Because he made CNN pundits look bad that don't like Trump.
[00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.106]  Yeah, but there's the poll.
[00:38:09.146 --> 00:38:09.907]  This is another poll.
[00:38:10.227 --> 00:38:14.991]  I actually salute progress polls on Obama Day, putting up this poll.
[00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:21.516]  Trump wins it easily, just like he wins the liberal polls that they try to rig by blocking Trump supporters on Twitter.
[00:38:22.878 --> 00:38:24.799]  But no, Trump is extremely popular.
[00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:27.401]  That's why he gets tens of thousands of people to come out for his rallies.
[00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.042]  Nobody else can do that.
[00:38:28.362 --> 00:38:37.030]  I'm now joined by another popular person, Leanne McAdoo, one of the most popular people at InfoWars, and we're going to talk about North Korea today.
[00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:55.006]  You know, we're on a balancing point, I think, here, Leanne, where we're kind of watching out for the same neocon, warmongering, military-industrial complex things, but on the other side of it, my thing is, this just sets up another double standard of the left
[00:38:55.787 --> 00:39:06.485]  Um, where they don't want to do anything about North Korea, uh, but, you know, it's like any other invasion in the Middle East is, is, I guess, okay.
[00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:08.028]  But, but North Korea is a problem.
[00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:15.515]  Right, I mean, you, it's just, President Trump can do absolutely nothing right when it comes to the resistance.
[00:39:15.635 --> 00:39:16.215]  You know, right?
[00:39:16.415 --> 00:39:27.078]  You could be a tiny little nuclear-armed North Korean madman saying that you want to annihilate the United States from the face of the Earth, and the left would say,
[00:39:27.638 --> 00:39:29.399]  Don't speak too harshly to him.
[00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:30.859]  You're hurting his feelings.
[00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:40.802]  You know, now they're all so concerned about Trump possessing the nuclear codes, but where was the same outrage when former President Obama said nearly the exact same thing to North Korea?
[00:39:40.882 --> 00:39:43.423]  He said, we can destroy you.
[00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:53.866]  But see, they liked it when Obama talked tough because he never actually backed up his tough words with any action, whereas they see Trump is actually following through on some of his tough talk.
[00:39:54.941 --> 00:40:01.768]  Where is the outrage over how North Korea was able to become a weaponized nuclear power?
[00:40:01.808 --> 00:40:05.492]  Where is the outrage towards Bill Clinton, who said this wouldn't happen?
[00:40:05.532 --> 00:40:10.617]  Where is the outrage to Obama, who first denied that they had this capability?
[00:40:10.657 --> 00:40:13.901]  Where is the outrage for Susan Rice, who says, just get used to this?
[00:40:15.825 --> 00:40:16.305]  Exactly.
[00:40:16.445 --> 00:40:22.447]  It's like when they tell people there in the EU and the UK to just get used to terrorism.
[00:40:22.487 --> 00:40:23.628]  This is something we have to live with.
[00:40:23.648 --> 00:40:26.669]  This is part and parcel of living in a big city.
[00:40:26.689 --> 00:40:35.812]  I think Susan Rice is kind of that lone dissenting voice because I'm always a little hesitant to kind of jump on the bandwagon when we see
[00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:36.572]  Yeah.
[00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:36.972]  Yeah.
[00:40:58.658 --> 00:41:17.015]  Protect her former bosses legacy of strategic patience by saying, oh, well, we need to we can we can deal we can accept a nuclear armed North Korea because as we know now, the Obama administration was told by the intelligence agencies about these miniaturized nuclear warheads back in 2013.
[00:41:18.536 --> 00:41:20.198]  But they tried to conceal the story.
[00:41:20.218 --> 00:41:21.439]  They wanted to diminish it.
[00:41:22.159 --> 00:41:26.163]  They said this wasn't the consensus of all of the intelligence agencies.
[00:41:26.544 --> 00:41:28.065]  So, you know, this isn't a big deal.
[00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:32.609]  We're just going to kick this can down the road and go on with our strategic patience.
[00:41:32.649 --> 00:41:34.431]  But we can see where that has led.
[00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:42.118]  Also, you know, this is right around the time that Obama was working on the Iran deal, which, as you pointed out, would really bring to mind
[00:41:42.992 --> 00:41:52.120]  People would say, wait a minute, this Iran deal you're talking about sounds exactly like the nuclear deal that Bill Clinton was so proud of that he made with North Korea.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:42:01.788]  Now back then, Bill Clinton, he rolls out this speech talking about, you know, we've given them $5 billion in aid and not one but two nuclear reactors.
[00:42:02.468 --> 00:42:14.017]  But this is going to stop them, stop the proliferation of nuclear warheads, because they promised to let some international inspectors in to check out their program and just keep an eye on them, make sure.
[00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:21.063]  Well, now we know North Korea reneged on that deal day one, and we see what's happened now decades later.
[00:42:21.103 --> 00:42:28.309]  So this is why the Obama administration wanted to diminish that report about North Korea having those miniaturized nuclear warhead capabilities.
[00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:28.969]  Yes.
[00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:51.288]  Yeah, he gave him that cash too.
[00:42:51.909 --> 00:42:58.933]  It's amazing to think, you know, who knows if Bill Clinton ever thought, you know, by the way, Bill Clinton also sold nuclear seekers to the Chinese.
[00:42:59.654 --> 00:43:04.537]  Who knows if Bill Clinton thought that this nuclear deal with North Korea would end up being this way.
[00:43:04.557 --> 00:43:12.702]  Obama obviously knew that North Korea had this capability years ago and decided to do nothing.
[00:43:13.823 --> 00:43:15.985]  And I think what's going on here, it seems to me,
[00:43:17.475 --> 00:43:35.105]  That every move that Trump is making or that every development that we have here, regardless of the partisan or the polarization of it, it seems like everything is set up to make the left clearly display their double standards.
[00:43:35.285 --> 00:43:36.386]  Everything is set up
[00:43:36.966 --> 00:43:41.208]  So that if they want to come after Trump for this, they have to look in the mirror.
[00:43:41.588 --> 00:43:45.010]  Like you said, Obama said the same thing to North Korea.
[00:43:46.051 --> 00:43:54.435]  So it just feels to me that the reason he's letting all of this go because he's just setting it up saying, look, you guys are doing the exact same deals.
[00:43:56.007 --> 00:44:05.574]  Right, and then whenever you try to bring that up, if you kind of retaliate with something like that on Twitter or wherever, people say, oh, well, just because they did it, it's okay if he does it too.
[00:44:05.954 --> 00:44:10.017]  They want you to stop from drawing out those similarities and calling them out of hypocrisy.
[00:44:10.037 --> 00:44:10.657]  But that's the irony!
[00:44:10.677 --> 00:44:11.718]  He didn't do it!
[00:44:12.118 --> 00:44:13.199]  He didn't even do it!
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.421]  He's not even fighting it!
[00:44:17.682 --> 00:44:23.586]  Well, and that's, you know, you have Al Gore coming out admitting that President Trump inherited this very dangerous situation in North Korea.
[00:44:23.606 --> 00:44:24.547]  Al Gore finally got it right.
[00:44:26.317 --> 00:44:32.498]  That's when you kind of have to go, wait a minute, hold on, is Trump finally doing what the intelligence agencies want him to do?
[00:44:32.558 --> 00:44:34.819]  What the deep state, the neocons, what do they have on him?
[00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:36.679]  Now he's finally in alignment.
[00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:42.980]  When you have Al Gore, who was Bill Clinton's right hand man back in the day, it's like, yeah, we, we did that.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.560]  Sorry.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.360]  Sorry, Trump.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.621]  You did inherit a very dangerous situation.
[00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:51.502]  So, you know, it's just incredible, but that's, that's what I don't understand is I feel like
[00:44:52.995 --> 00:45:03.559]  Are the Democrats really that stupid that they think, you know, if we just keep giving all this free stuff and being really nice to all of these regimes that hate us, they're just going to finally learn to love and accept us?
[00:45:03.699 --> 00:45:04.699]  I don't buy that.
[00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:06.320]  I am not buying that one bit.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.340]  I think it's one of two things.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:12.582]  They either truly hate this country so much that they want to see it destroyed.
[00:45:12.742 --> 00:45:17.423]  And so they, during their terms, they arm and fund and train our enemies.
[00:45:17.724 --> 00:45:21.805]  So then the Republicans have to come in and fight the war and clean up the mess.
[00:45:22.205 --> 00:45:26.229]  And then it's this cycle where then the Democrats come in and say, oh, well, we're going to stop the war.
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:31.354]  But, you know, at the same time, they're arming and funding our enemies because they want to destroy this country.
[00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:42.325]  Or this is just some effort to continually keep us inside of this political matrix where we're constantly being ping ponged back and forth and they're all on the same team and there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.907]  Well, and my question, too, is how much of this was reaction-based?
[00:45:48.947 --> 00:45:52.971]  I mean, Kim Jong Un has made threats to the United States.
[00:45:54.082 --> 00:45:55.402]  For as long as I can remember.
[00:45:55.442 --> 00:45:57.103]  He did it during the Obama administration.
[00:45:57.143 --> 00:45:59.243]  He did it multiple times in the Trump administration.
[00:46:00.064 --> 00:46:07.986]  I think I remember there was some Chinese, like, moon military base exhibit where they had some picture of a bomb blowing up over Europe or something.
[00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:12.467]  So, you know, you just sit here and you wonder, how legitimate are we supposed to take some of these threats?
[00:46:12.787 --> 00:46:14.648]  And again, what I pointed out was, it seems like
[00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:18.608]  Trump is being very, the brinksmanship is very real here.
[00:46:19.288 --> 00:46:28.232]  He's done certain things in the Middle East, but he hasn't really had the story surfacing like Obama, you know, drone strikes a wedding and kills kids in a wedding.
[00:46:29.213 --> 00:46:31.874]  He drops the Moab on a tunnel that people were using.
[00:46:32.554 --> 00:46:35.676]  He uses rhetoric against North Korea.
[00:46:36.096 --> 00:46:38.677]  And he does this, and then his approval ratings grow up.
[00:46:38.717 --> 00:46:42.659]  How much do you think of this as brinksmanship, and how much do you think is this an actual threat?
[00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:42.860]  15 seconds.
[00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:53.217]  Well, I sincerely hope that this North Korea thing isn't going to be the Monica's war, like we saw with Bill Clinton, and that he's not going to do this to up his ratings.
[00:46:53.257 --> 00:46:54.358]  That's very dangerous.
[00:46:54.759 --> 00:46:56.661]  So, President Trump, if you're listening, don't go there.
[00:46:56.941 --> 00:46:57.722]  Don't go to war.
[00:46:58.123 --> 00:47:02.228]  If you have to have extreme rhetoric to distract from the Russia thing, well, I guess that's what he does.
[00:47:03.965 --> 00:47:08.748]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:09.408 --> 00:47:10.989]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:11.389 --> 00:47:16.372]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:16.732 --> 00:47:22.176]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:22.576 --> 00:47:29.180]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.961]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:31.801 --> 00:47:33.762]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:37.044]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:37.465 --> 00:47:41.087]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:41.287 --> 00:47:43.849]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:56.257]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:56.457 --> 00:48:01.581]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.681 --> 00:48:03.022]  It's bound.
[00:48:03.082 --> 00:48:04.303]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:04.724 --> 00:48:05.164]  I tried it.
[00:48:05.744 --> 00:48:09.287]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:09.508 --> 00:48:14.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:19.796]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:21.197 --> 00:48:23.799]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:23.919 --> 00:48:25.240]  Thank you for having me.
[00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:49.410]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.451]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:51.511]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:52.131]  You must have it.
[00:48:52.492 --> 00:49:00.035]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:49:00.055 --> 00:49:00.935]  We can answer your questions.
[00:49:00.955 --> 00:49:00.995]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:10.613 --> 00:49:25.657]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go high, high, high.
[00:49:25.797 --> 00:49:31.779]  We're such self-centered crap, we don't even notice ourselves rising up against the
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.223]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:49:48.303 --> 00:49:50.304]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:50:14.045 --> 00:50:18.748]  And that was a jazzy rendition of the Alex Jones Bon Iver folk song.
[00:50:19.208 --> 00:50:20.970]  Once again, that was upscale.
[00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:27.974]  And they entered the Infowars.com $20,000 contest in hopes of claiming that prize.
[00:50:27.994 --> 00:50:28.775]  There's many prizes.
[00:50:28.815 --> 00:50:29.875]  We got three prizes right now.
[00:50:29.955 --> 00:50:38.641]  I'm going to try to talk Jones into offering a few more because throughout this process of bringing in more acts and seeing all the different things, new categories have arisen.
[00:50:39.061 --> 00:50:42.584]  And without further ado, we turn now to the full band of upscale led by Eric Luckey.
[00:50:43.324 --> 00:50:46.545]  And they're a jazz band performing out of Chicago, right?
[00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:48.505]  Yeah, Chicago area.
[00:50:48.525 --> 00:50:49.785]  Villa Park to be specific.
[00:50:50.345 --> 00:50:56.947]  Alright, so I've talked with some people and some of the bands were into it, some of the band members were not.
[00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:58.667]  Were you guys all into doing this song?
[00:50:59.607 --> 00:51:00.267]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:03.188]  We do music for a living and we just absolutely love to play.
[00:51:03.568 --> 00:51:09.649]  We actually played for a group called Diamond Tours that night and then after we played, we went ahead and shot the song.
[00:51:10.931 --> 00:51:11.512]  Excellent.
[00:51:11.532 --> 00:51:14.677]  So did you guys do it all in one take, or how did it work?
[00:51:14.737 --> 00:51:15.999]  No, we did it in six takes.
[00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:24.531]  We did one take of the entire band, and then we did a take of each individual, and then we just kind of spliced it all together and did a little, you know, magic in the post-production.
[00:51:25.646 --> 00:51:25.926]  Excellent.
[00:51:25.946 --> 00:51:27.267]  Yeah, your video looks sharp.
[00:51:27.307 --> 00:51:28.167]  The sound's great.
[00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:31.069]  Everything about it is really good.
[00:51:31.369 --> 00:51:33.090]  What's it like being a jazz band?
[00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:38.053]  You guys, I guess, you're more conservative or libertarian than if you guys were into the song.
[00:51:38.713 --> 00:51:42.135]  When I go to the jazz club here, the Elephant Room's a big one in Austin, Texas.
[00:51:42.315 --> 00:51:45.497]  It's filled with a lot of, you know, kind of liberal-leaning people.
[00:51:45.757 --> 00:51:47.578]  Do you guys ever have any conflict like that?
[00:51:48.601 --> 00:51:49.262]  Absolutely.
[00:51:49.282 --> 00:51:52.506]  If you're a conservative, you're the elephant in the room, actually.
[00:51:52.526 --> 00:52:01.961]  And most of the people we play with are very far left-leaning, so if we even mention Alex Jones, we get kind of some interesting responses, to say the least.
[00:52:03.337 --> 00:52:03.838]  Interesting.
[00:52:04.058 --> 00:52:04.338]  Interesting.
[00:52:04.358 --> 00:52:06.760]  So what attracted you to doing the song?
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.522]  Why did you decide that you wanted to do it?
[00:52:08.782 --> 00:52:15.669]  And then how did that process working out about, hey, we're going to do this as a jazz arrangement, how long did it take you to figure out the chordings and everything?
[00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.152]  Well, I just went ahead and looked at the song.
[00:52:18.192 --> 00:52:21.775]  I want to say on Ultimate Guitar, they have the chord changes.
[00:52:21.795 --> 00:52:24.638]  So I just changed them a little bit to make them a little bit more jazzy.
[00:52:25.018 --> 00:52:28.340]  And then these guys have been playing, you know, we're professional musicians.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.221]  We've been doing this since we were about 20 years old.
[00:52:30.841 --> 00:52:35.044]  And so I throw the core charts in front of these guys and they just read them down and that's it.
[00:52:36.324 --> 00:52:36.705]  Excellent.
[00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:37.285]  Excellent.
[00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.906]  And what's, I guess, from your fan base?
[00:52:39.946 --> 00:52:41.187]  What has been the response?
[00:52:41.207 --> 00:52:42.328]  What do they think about it?
[00:52:43.038 --> 00:52:45.679]  Well, we've gotten nothing but positive comments.
[00:52:45.719 --> 00:52:51.080]  I think we've gotten maybe like five or six thumbs down, and hopefully they just accidentally hit the button.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.480]  I guess we'll never know.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.421]  But yeah, we've gotten a lot of positive responses.
[00:52:56.441 --> 00:53:01.502]  We don't have a huge fan base because a lot of what we do is private events through a company called Lucky Entertainment.
[00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:02.842]  That's my parents' company.
[00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:05.863]  And we just thank God every day that we can do this for a living.
[00:53:05.923 --> 00:53:09.264]  It's just an awesome blessing and honor to play with these wonderful guys also.
[00:53:09.304 --> 00:53:10.604]  They're just outstanding musicians.
[00:53:12.287 --> 00:53:15.888]  So let's get into, I guess, the lyrics.
[00:53:15.908 --> 00:53:21.931]  What do they mean to you when you hear Alex Jones talking about pot-bellied goblins and people eating babies?
[00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:24.012]  I mean, wild stuff!
[00:53:24.172 --> 00:53:29.054]  But then in one of the video versions we made, we backed it up with evidence.
[00:53:29.774 --> 00:53:32.155]  How do you guys look at that and how do you reconcile that?
[00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:37.033]  Well, I would say there's a lot of wild stuff going on on the left right now.
[00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:41.675]  So, I mean, I think it's very, you know, obviously he's doing a lot of satire and other things like that.
[00:53:42.456 --> 00:53:51.921]  But I think once you start to get into the evidence of the craziness of all this Antifa stuff and whatnot, you know, I think it's pretty suiting, to be honest with you.
[00:53:52.912 --> 00:53:56.055]  Yeah, and Chicago is a hotbed for the left right now.
[00:53:56.115 --> 00:54:03.462]  Rahm Emanuel's come out and he wants to sue President Trump and his administration for, you know, invoking the Sanctuary City ban.
[00:54:03.482 --> 00:54:06.985]  You guys have the highest crime rate in America right now, the murder rate.
[00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:11.910]  What is going on in Chicago and is there any change on the horizon?
[00:54:13.072 --> 00:54:14.193]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:54:14.593 --> 00:54:23.320]  We've always chosen to live out in the suburbs, so we haven't really gotten a chance to see the heart of, you know, all of the corruption and everything that goes on directly in the city.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:33.849]  Now, we do get booked in the city from time to time, but we try to stick, you know, stay out here and we're actually in DuPage County, which is a little more on the conservative side overall.
[00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:38.673]  But yeah, we don't really see a whole lot of the craziness that actually goes on downtown.
[00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.212]  And is that by, I mean, did you ever go downtown as a kid?
[00:54:43.332 --> 00:54:45.694]  Is this something that you've had to change your lifestyle around?
[00:54:45.714 --> 00:54:47.635]  Or is it just you just stay away from it?
[00:54:48.816 --> 00:54:50.397]  No, we've always lived out in the suburbs.
[00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:52.559]  It's always been pretty peaceful where we are.
[00:54:53.839 --> 00:55:00.364]  So we don't really choose, you know, unless somebody's willing to pay us to go out there, you know, we try to try to stay away from the city, to be honest with you.
[00:55:00.744 --> 00:55:02.746]  It's a lot of people in a small amount of space.
[00:55:03.536 --> 00:55:03.756]  Yeah.
[00:55:04.437 --> 00:55:07.760]  Well, what do you want people to know about you guys?
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.321]  Like, what is your outlook on life?
[00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:15.306]  What do you guys aspire to be, you know, going in the future in this, you know, this Trump world that we're living in now?
[00:55:16.468 --> 00:55:18.929]  Well, I'm a Christian and I just want to stand for the truth.
[00:55:19.209 --> 00:55:27.112]  And the reason why I got into Alex Jones in the first place is because I was looking, why is it that I can't find anything bad about Hillary Clinton?
[00:55:27.532 --> 00:55:30.133]  And why are there so many bad things about Donald Trump?
[00:55:30.873 --> 00:55:34.334]  And I was just Google searching with the primaries and everything going on.
[00:55:34.834 --> 00:55:44.782]  And I landed on Alex Jones and InfoWars, and I started looking into it, and these guys here, Alex and VoidTech, they have been into you guys for a really long time.
[00:55:45.102 --> 00:55:48.585]  And they've been talking you up and talking you up, and I'm like, no, no, that guy's crazy, that guy's crazy.
[00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:53.249]  And then finally I found you guys, just in my hunt for truth.
[00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:57.473]  And I've been listening to InfoWars ever since.
[00:55:58.214 --> 00:56:04.822]  Our goal is, you know, just to spread the gifts of the Holy Spirit, peace, joy, patience, kindness, all these other things.
[00:56:04.882 --> 00:56:08.165]  Just kind of share, you know, the love of Jesus with people.
[00:56:09.207 --> 00:56:09.487]  I'm good.
[00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:27.787]  Clayton's on this side, sorry.
[00:56:27.827 --> 00:56:30.169]  Clayton is a young guy, he's only, what, 17?
[00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:31.010]  Yeah.
[00:56:31.851 --> 00:56:36.335]  And then Jack, he went to Columbia and he's been playing with us, you know, since the beginning.
[00:56:37.516 --> 00:56:42.400]  But yeah, our business goal is just to get more bookings through the Gigmasters website.
[00:56:42.801 --> 00:56:49.247]  We already do a lot of solo shows with Lockheed Entertainment in Hillside, but we're just always trying to improve
[00:56:50.347 --> 00:56:52.228]  Our business and our, you know, just our spread.
[00:56:52.248 --> 00:56:53.648]  We're willing to travel everywhere.
[00:56:53.668 --> 00:56:56.949]  We actually have a birthday party on Friday that we're playing for.
[00:56:57.149 --> 00:57:00.650]  We have a wedding in Wisconsin Springs on Saturday that we're playing for.
[00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.311]  And our goal is just to play, have fun and enjoy our music.
[00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:05.251]  All right.
[00:57:05.292 --> 00:57:08.492]  Hey, quickly introduce the rest of the band and tell everybody what instruments they're playing.
[00:57:09.313 --> 00:57:11.253]  OK, so we've got Clayton over here.
[00:57:11.273 --> 00:57:12.033]  He plays guitar.
[00:57:12.334 --> 00:57:12.734]  Say hello.
[00:57:12.894 --> 00:57:13.654]  What's up, guys?
[00:57:14.254 --> 00:57:17.335]  We've got Alex Talbot, who is singing and playing saxophone.
[00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:22.121]  We've got Voytek playing drums.
[00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:25.322]  And then we have Jack Burr playing bass over here.
[00:57:26.002 --> 00:57:28.183]  And then I sing and play piano as well.
[00:57:28.744 --> 00:57:30.504]  We do pop music and other stuff as well.
[00:57:30.844 --> 00:57:33.626]  We just decided to make a jazz video because we enjoy jazz.
[00:57:34.726 --> 00:57:35.126]  Excellent.
[00:57:35.186 --> 00:57:35.466]  Excellent.
[00:57:35.486 --> 00:57:36.627]  So you play a variety of styles.
[00:57:36.647 --> 00:57:37.087]  That's cool.
[00:57:37.968 --> 00:57:38.908]  All right.
[00:57:39.328 --> 00:57:40.269]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:57:40.389 --> 00:57:41.029]  Really quick.
[00:57:41.429 --> 00:57:43.830]  We just want to share our favorite supplements as well.
[00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.471]  We've got some super mayo.
[00:57:46.286 --> 00:57:49.469]  Got some Secret 12, and we got the Deep Cleanse over there in the back.
[00:57:49.909 --> 00:57:53.252]  So thanks, you guys, for putting out some good stuff.
[00:57:53.532 --> 00:58:03.041]  I started playing soccer on Saturdays with some guys, and I take Supermail and Secret 12, actually, before I kind of turn away so they don't see it, because I don't want them to know what my secret is.
[00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:06.823]  Because I'm one of the older ones out there, and I'm keeping up with them.
[00:58:08.044 --> 00:58:09.304]  It definitely helps.
[00:58:09.324 --> 00:58:10.625]  The products definitely help.
