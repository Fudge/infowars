[00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.578]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:22.300]  It is Tuesday, March 14th, 2017.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.903]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:48.440]  Tonight, Pokemon Go looks a lot like the future of warfare, as the CIA's augmented reality comes complete with Imperial probe droids, who will take real-time, ground-level footage for spy satellites and Google Earth.
[00:00:51.411 --> 00:01:06.101]  Then, the Obama wiretap scandal deepens as intelligence sources now believe that the former president veered outside the chain of command to conduct illegal surveillance operations on Team Trump.
[00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:14.267]  All that plus Hillary Clinton wants Vice President Mike Pence to take over the White House.
[00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.007]  That's up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:02.274]  We're good.
[00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.554]  Well, here's another InfoWars conspiracy theory that has turned out to ring true.
[00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:19.662]  Now, remember when we were kind of making fun of everyone who was obsessed with this Pokemon game, saying, look, you guys are seriously helping the intelligence agencies build their geospatial intelligence?
[00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:20.923]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:32.931]  Here at South by Southwest, there was actually a director of the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office speaking to someone from Wired Magazine and said, the autonomous future of warfare
[00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.393]  Looks a lot like Pokemon Go.
[00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:41.958]  So this is Will Roper and he plays video games like the country's future depends on it.
[00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:42.778]  That's his job.
[00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:54.207]  And he says that he spends his days predicting how war will work in the not so distant future and develops the technological capabilities that will enable the American military to lead the way.
[00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:59.070]  And he says that they think that they have solved one of the toughest challenges for warfare and
[00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:07.677]  That is, how do you take amazingly complex information and make it so integrated with the person interacting with it?
[00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:12.660]  Well then, in comes Pokemon Go, or so they want us to think.
[00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:19.065]  Because as we have reported back in July of 2016, Pokemon Go was linked to a CIA company.
[00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:28.932]  But Roper is basically saying that he envisions a day when soldiers will be able to drop a digital marker on the battlefield that future deployments and faraway units could also see
[00:04:29.432 --> 00:04:35.438]  Similar to how Pokemon Go enables millions of strangers to spot the Jigglypuff in the middle of Times Square.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.068]  They say perhaps augmented reality advances could help soldiers access a global map of the surrounding area in the lower corner of the field
[00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:51.309]  People who play a lot of first-person shooter games like Call of Duty would be familiar with what something like that would look like.
[00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:03.452]  So this is, of course, you know, I spoke a lot about this with Jade Helm and the building of the geospatial intelligence and how it was more so being able to get the soldiers to drop these pins.
[00:05:04.032 --> 00:05:05.472]  And then, of course, with Pokemon Go.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:07.512]  I know Alex was really just raving about this.
[00:05:07.712 --> 00:05:10.253]  This is, of course, building a CIA database.
[00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:16.415]  And so it's basically turning millions of people's cell phones into imperial probe droids.
[00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.896]  So this was back in 2016.
[00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:26.340]  Kit Daniels did the report and said that the developer of Pokemon Go, Niantic Inc., was founded by John Hanke.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.300]  We're good to go!
[00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:56.607]  Just like there is a massive political presence at South by Southwest now.
[00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:06.472]  They are all in with the tech and the innovation at South by Southwest, really trying to convince these developers to work with the government to help them stay ahead of the game.
[00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:17.418]  And of course, now they're really trying to have to work to rebuild the trust of those tech communities after it's been revealed in Vault 7 that they have been exploiting backdoor vulnerabilities.
[00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.078]  So this is...
[00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:35.314]  Easy to see why the CIA would have an interest in the software behind Pokemon Go, because Pokemon Go utilizes the player's camera and gyroscope to display the image of a Pokemon as though it were right there in your living room in the real world.
[00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:40.599]  And we said, basically, you're taking your phone and giving Google Earth, the CIA,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:52.564]  Giving them access to all of the places that Google Earth isn't able to reach, like inside your apartment complex or inside of an office complex, in dark alleyways, in basements.
[00:06:52.944 --> 00:07:02.127]  So these are places where spy satellites, Google cars cannot reach, but they are convincing millions of people to, oh, hop over that fence there and catch them all.
[00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:06.189]  You know, so just people were just obsessed with this game.
[00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:19.838]  And Kit Daniels points out, for example, in the 2008 film The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne intentionally places a backdoor into cell phones sold by his company to implement a citywide sonar grid.
[00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:25.963]  So there you have the movie basically showing you how this augmented reality software, how it all kind of works.
[00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:30.065]  In the early 2000s, In-Q-Tel invested in Keyhole Inc.
[00:07:30.485 --> 00:07:32.266]  This was a company founded by Hankey.
[00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:38.188]  They developed the 3D fly-by images of buildings and terrain from geospatial data that was collected by satellites.
[00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:45.431]  Keyhole was later purchased in 2004 by Google, and they turned that technology into Google Earth.
[00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:49.233]  And, of course, this is the CIA establishing In-Q-Tel.
[00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:59.548]  To go ahead and gobble up any new investment and identify any companies that they would be able to use their ingenuity to help build the arm of the government.
[00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:04.511]  So we're going to be doing some more man on the streets out at South by Southwest.
[00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:10.816]  But I mean you would just not believe in the last couple of years we had former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama here last year.
[00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:15.778]  Trying to speak directly with these tech innovators to get them to join us, help the government.
[00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:25.102]  Michelle Obama was there speaking with musicians to get them to use their music and to write music specifically to help the government push its agenda.
[00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:31.205]  I'm sure they were speaking with the film crews there as well and people involved in that industry.
[00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:40.630]  And it's very interesting to see how the tides have completely turned because just a year ago, the entertainment industry was all for pushing the government's propaganda.
[00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:51.913]  But now, and I asked a lot of people this on the street last year when I did a report, what about if there's a president in power that you don't like who's pushing political agenda that you disagree with?
[00:08:51.974 --> 00:08:53.694]  Are you still going to help him push vaccines?
[00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:57.115]  That kind of made people stop and think a little bit, but that's how this is.
[00:08:57.175 --> 00:09:05.718]  So perhaps if you agree with a certain, you know, you think, you believe, you trust that the government has all of the American people's best interests at heart,
[00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:06.498]  We're good to go.
[00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:29.071]  How this new technology, this new app is going to be used.
[00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:31.712]  So this is a creepy facial recognition app.
[00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:36.835]  It lets users find complete strangers on Facebook by taking their picture.
[00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:43.518]  So this is something that is going to basically do away with privacy existing in public society.
[00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:46.839]  So all users have to do is take a picture of someone on the street.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.280]  They run it through this app.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.962]  It scans through billions of Facebook profile images a second.
[00:09:52.242 --> 00:09:52.642]  I'm good.
[00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:17.713]  Because a lot of people put so much personal information up on Facebook, so immediately you can identify people, right?
[00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:20.514]  I'm not even going to say the name of this app because I don't want people downloading it.
[00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:25.917]  But Facebook has, you know, they're trying to delay the launch of this app.
[00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:27.277]  It's supposed to come out at the end of the month.
[00:10:28.058 --> 00:10:32.520]  But Facebook says, you know, it violates the privacy policies of Facebook.
[00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.430]  Please.
[00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.391]  Facebook does not care.
[00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.771]  They're constantly nudging you.
[00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.752]  Oh, tag your friends in this photo.
[00:10:39.112 --> 00:10:42.093]  Oh, we just found this random photo on the internet of you.
[00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:42.874]  Is that you?
[00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:49.276]  Do you want to tag yourself in it and put the Geo tag and let everybody know that you were out drinking with your friends the other night?
[00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:55.398]  The reason why Facebook is going to try to delay this app coming out is because Facebook doesn't own it.
[00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:56.739]  They don't control it.
[00:10:56.859 --> 00:11:02.901]  And it's using Facebook's data because of course they consider your personal data that you offer up to the website.
[00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:04.462]  That's their data now.
[00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:05.803]  They own your information.
[00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:07.045]  They're the ones that get to sell it.
[00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:09.907]  So that's what the issue is here.
[00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:19.175]  They're probably going to buy up this technology from this app and then they will put it out through Facebook and that's just where it is there.
[00:11:19.215 --> 00:11:24.560]  Don't start thinking that all of a sudden Facebook has some moral high ground here that they're not going to step below.
[00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.562]  But according to a recent Pentagon report,
[00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:31.184]  The Pentagon is saying that the entire U.S.
[00:11:31.264 --> 00:11:37.446]  energy grid is open to cyberattacks and will be for another few decades, at least the next decade.
[00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:44.848]  They say American infrastructure, including the energy grid, will remain vulnerable to cyberattacks from China and Russia, of course.
[00:11:45.328 --> 00:11:56.612]  For the next decade, the cyber vulnerabilities must be reduced, while the Pentagon creates new deterrence capabilities ranging from low-level disruption to catastrophic destruction and loss of life.
[00:11:57.432 --> 00:12:02.716]  So they're basically letting us all know that the Chinese and the Russians are going to hack into our energy grid.
[00:12:03.297 --> 00:12:11.624]  Therefore, and sooner rather than never at all, but therefore they have to go on the offense and build these other weapons.
[00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.345]  And, you know, where are they going to test them at?
[00:12:13.405 --> 00:12:18.949]  Or if something happens, false flag type deal, they can, of course, blame it on the Chinese or the Russians.
[00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:30.100]  And so they say that the offensive cyber capabilities of the most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United States.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:42.072]  And of course they would know this because as we also learned with the Vault 7 data dump, the CIA has stolen a lot of their cyber warfare techniques from the likes of the Russian state and these other
[00:12:42.773 --> 00:12:43.274]  I think so.
[00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:04.577]  And they're probably not paying them as well as they're paying the hackers that work for the US government.
[00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:16.241]  So this report says, the United States, as well as our allies and partners, are at serious and increasing risk of severe cyber attack and increasingly costly cyber intrusion.
[00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:20.923]  The requirement for enhanced deterrence is, in our view, not debatable.
[00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:25.227]  Nor is the need to accelerate the implementation of deterrence measures.
[00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:53.419]  They are absolutely ramping up everything to be connected to the grid and to get everything wired and everything up in artificial intelligence because they know there's a calamity absolutely is going to happen in the future.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.722]  So let's just go full steam ahead.
[00:13:56.543 --> 00:14:00.406]  Uh, but this is according to three separate intelligence agencies.
[00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:11.293]  These sources believe that former President Obama veered outside the chain of command and employed British surveillance agents to conduct surveillance on Donald Trump.
[00:14:11.753 --> 00:14:12.033]  Wow.
[00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:17.255]  So this was prior to the election, and this is according to Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:18.735]  He revealed this on Fox & Friends.
[00:14:19.215 --> 00:14:24.457]  He says that the sources spilled the details to him as this case continues to dominate headlines.
[00:14:25.377 --> 00:14:34.440]  Napolitano says that the sources tell him he didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA, he didn't use the FBI, and he didn't use the Department of Justice.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:41.064]  Obama used GCHQ, and that's the initials for the British spying agency.
[00:14:41.104 --> 00:14:49.729]  They have 24-7 access to the NSA database, and he never would have had to get any American fingerprints on this whatsoever.
[00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:55.072]  He could have just said, I need you to go in and look at President-elect Trump, see if he's got any ties to the Russians.
[00:14:55.412 --> 00:15:02.056]  There would have been no American fingerprints, and this also would have secured plausible deniability.
[00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:04.018]  So there you go, but we had Joel
[00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:06.319]  Gilbert here writing an article.
[00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:20.526]  This is investigative filmmaker Joel Gilbert saying we need to investigate Russia's ties to Obama and he gets into some pretty good conspiracy theories here asking was President Barack Obama blackmailed by Russia.
[00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:25.308]  Now everybody kind of knows this clip.
[00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:28.650]  Let's go ahead and go back and play this clip from a couple years ago.
[00:15:29.392 --> 00:15:31.977]  After my election, I am more flexible.
[00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:38.651]  I transmit this information to Vladimir Andreev.
[00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:47.367]  So why in the heck was Obama whispering, this is my last election, after my election I have more flexibility?
[00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:52.072]  Is he promising Russia the policies that he would implement?
[00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:53.673]  You know, what is he doing there?
[00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:55.515]  Was he blackmailed by Russia?
[00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:59.539]  This is what Joel Gilbert is asking and he kind of brings up some very good points here.
[00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:05.784]  He says, this stunning and inexplicable pro-Russia policies that Obama undertook during his first term.
[00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:11.447]  Gives us every reason to believe Obama was under Putin's control right under our noses.
[00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:17.009]  So upon taking office in January 2009, Obama canceled the planned U.S.
[00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:21.531]  missile defense system in Eastern Europe that Vladimir Putin had bitterly opposed.
[00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:27.654]  Mitt Romney called this action a gift to Russia, while Putin called Obama's move correct and brave.
[00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:31.435]  Under cover of the now infamous reset, the U.S.
[00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:35.637]  set up a joint commission to transfer previously forbidden technology to Russia.
[00:16:36.297 --> 00:16:42.442]  The US also approved the transfer of 20% of American uranium deposits to a Russian company, Uranium One.
[00:16:43.283 --> 00:16:51.190]  And in addition to that, Putin scuttled an agreement on disposal of weapons-grade plutonium with no response from Obama and
[00:16:51.810 --> 00:17:04.240]  Number four best of all Obama implemented a policy of American disengagement from the world billed as leading from behind So this abandoned years of bipartisan foreign policy consensus and because the u.s.
[00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:08.204]  Was disengaged this allowed Russia to kind of get in and
[00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:13.765]  And, uh, fill the void there, fill the vacuum, tip the balance of power in its favor where it saw fit.
[00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:19.927]  Russia invaded Crimea and intervened in Syria with barely a word from the White House.
[00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:25.288]  And so all this stuff was happening, but we were all told, you know, don't worry about it, whatever.
[00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:27.289]  Mr. Obama was calm.
[00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:28.849]  He was going golfing.
[00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:31.410]  And so then Joel Gilbert goes on.
[00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:38.112]  Which if anyone hasn't seen his 2012 film, Dreams From My Real Father, this is where he's getting all this information from.
[00:17:38.512 --> 00:17:40.933]  What leverage could the Russians have had over Obama?
[00:17:41.013 --> 00:17:45.875]  Why would Putin be pressuring Obama to deliver even more before the 2012 election?
[00:17:46.335 --> 00:18:00.140]  Well, he says Obama's father lie, served up by the United States on a silver platter, to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service is the fact that his real father was the Cold War Soviet espionage agent Frank Marshall Davis, who
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:10.887]  The Russians had plenty of information on, as did the FBI, because they had him under surveillance for pro-Soviet espionage and propaganda activity for 20 years.
[00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:30.100]  Now, he gets into great detail in this article, kind of going back where he presented this mountain of evidence, kind of linking the two and talking about how in the 1930s, the Communist Party USA there was on the lookout for prominent black leaders who could help bring other black people into the communist movement.
[00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:39.105]  And then how Frank Marshall Davis kind of went to Honolulu and was just this massive social justice warrior there at the time.
[00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:42.387]  So it goes on a 600 page file by the FBI.
[00:18:42.447 --> 00:18:43.568]  Great article there.
[00:18:44.268 --> 00:18:45.529]  But this is really good.
[00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:49.191]  Is it actually Obama who we need to investigate with ties to Russia?
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:03.394]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:15.723]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.743 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.530]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.830 --> 00:23:00.796]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:09.282 --> 00:23:10.984]  How much do you know about the company you work for?
[00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:15.313]  Sorry, we can't speak about this.
[00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:21.156]  Why is Planned Parenthood called Planned Parenthood when all it plans is abortions and stuff?
[00:23:25.018 --> 00:23:26.698]  Hi, I'm sorry, we can't speak about this.
[00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.619]  We're on the job.
[00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:29.800]  Why are you guys taking off your shirt?
[00:23:31.732 --> 00:23:32.412]  No more comments.
[00:23:32.532 --> 00:23:34.153]  But why are you taking off your shirt?
[00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:36.555]  You're not proud of Planned Parenthood?
[00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:38.336]  I don't understand.
[00:23:38.356 --> 00:23:38.416]  Why?
[00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:41.878]  What are you guys talking about?
[00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:53.349]  Are you guys being triggered or what's going on here?
[00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:53.850]  Triggered!
[00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.051]  Because we're all cucks.
[00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:55.912]  I'm a snowflake.
[00:23:56.132 --> 00:23:56.773]  You are?
[00:23:57.353 --> 00:24:01.718]  Well, I'm sorry to melt you, because obviously you just got pretty triggered right there.
[00:24:01.738 --> 00:24:02.459]  So triggered.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.641]  Alex Jones status, triggered.
[00:24:05.002 --> 00:24:05.542]  Really?
[00:24:06.163 --> 00:24:07.324]  So what do you guys think?
[00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:09.006]  What do you think about Planned Parenthood?
[00:24:10.047 --> 00:24:10.608]  Planned Parenthood?
[00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:19.216]  So some people do it out of social awkwardness and un- Oh, oh, excuse me, uh, sir!
[00:24:20.237 --> 00:24:21.237]  Look at you!
[00:24:21.337 --> 00:24:22.797]  You're a fake news yourself!
[00:24:23.897 --> 00:24:25.358]  Yeah, who are you with?
[00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:28.698]  Who are you with, since you want to interrupt what I'm saying?
[00:24:29.018 --> 00:24:30.099]  Well, it's bulls*** I'm saying, anyway.
[00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:30.899]  Well, who are you with?
[00:24:30.939 --> 00:24:31.579]  You've got a camera.
[00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:32.179]  Who are you with?
[00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:34.500]  Uh, I'm videotaping a company party.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.761]  I'm not in the media at all, so... So why do you say InfoWars is fake news?
[00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.601]  It's totally f***ing bulls*** news!
[00:24:41.966 --> 00:24:42.706]  Okay, and why?
[00:24:42.786 --> 00:24:43.607]  What's your evidence?
[00:24:43.667 --> 00:24:45.568]  Are you just going to say that without evidence?
[00:24:45.748 --> 00:24:48.029]  Because there's no evidence in any of the news that you guys make up.
[00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:50.910]  Okay, so you don't have evidence for your statements.
[00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.131]  That's pretty funny.
[00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:54.232]  That's a fallacy of logic you're applying there.
[00:25:03.596 --> 00:25:05.177]  What are you guys talking about?
[00:25:08.342 --> 00:25:10.543]  Are you guys being triggered or what's going on here?
[00:25:10.983 --> 00:25:12.884]  We're triggered because we're all cucks.
[00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:13.744]  I'm a snowflake.
[00:25:19.707 --> 00:25:26.130]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com and I'm here at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.672]  This is a large convention full of festivities.
[00:25:29.752 --> 00:25:34.354]  We have music, gaming, technology, all kinds of events going on here.
[00:25:34.554 --> 00:25:37.075]  It's a big film festival, music festival.
[00:25:37.615 --> 00:25:39.197]  Crazy event here now.
[00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:47.345]  It's pretty early in the morning, and we've been talking to some people out here But the common theme out here seems to be everybody is on their cell phones.
[00:25:47.706 --> 00:25:52.991]  That's right You know you think people want to come out here to meet people have conversations with people they don't know
[00:25:53.892 --> 00:26:03.519]  But so far we've just seen a bunch of people walking around on their cell phones aimlessly looking down at their phones.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:15.028]  So we're going to go talk to these people and interrupt them from their cell phone trance and talk to them about cell phone usage in America.
[00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:17.630]  Let's go see if we can wake some of these people up.
[00:26:57.203 --> 00:27:00.145]  How many people looking around you see on their phones right now?
[00:27:00.965 --> 00:27:01.245]  I don't know.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:02.980]  You don't know?
[00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:10.844]  What do you think about it though that like when you're walking around people are always looking down at their phones and not really interacting with each other very much?
[00:27:11.264 --> 00:27:11.605]  I don't know.
[00:27:13.245 --> 00:27:14.546]  What happened?
[00:27:15.406 --> 00:27:15.927]  You don't know?
[00:27:15.947 --> 00:27:17.527]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:27:17.547 --> 00:27:19.088]  Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:24.431]  I'm asking you about what you think about people being on their phones all the time.
[00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:29.653]  Was it always like this for you your entire life growing up or do you notice a change?
[00:27:30.554 --> 00:27:30.694]  Huh?
[00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:34.778]  We have some people here standing in the middle of the road on their phones.
[00:27:36.298 --> 00:27:36.979]  Okay, they're moving.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.420]  There they go.
[00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:47.844]  I think people like to use the cell phones as an excuse to being socially awkward, but I think they're just socially awkward people.
[00:27:48.715 --> 00:27:49.296]  You think so?
[00:27:49.776 --> 00:27:51.958]  So, what were you just doing on your phone?
[00:27:52.578 --> 00:27:54.660]  Trying to find out where I should go next.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.881]  Like, what talk I should go to.
[00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:57.142]  Are these your friends here?
[00:27:57.202 --> 00:27:57.943]  They're from... They're my friends.
[00:27:57.963 --> 00:27:58.543]  Where are they from?
[00:27:58.864 --> 00:28:00.185]  They are from Argentina.
[00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:01.086]  Oh, wow!
[00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:02.447]  And did you meet them online?
[00:28:02.687 --> 00:28:04.088]  I met them... No, we work together.
[00:28:04.268 --> 00:28:05.429]  It's not like a Tinder thing.
[00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.151]  We work together.
[00:28:09.853 --> 00:28:10.494]  Hey, ladies!
[00:28:11.494 --> 00:28:12.295]  Hey!
[00:28:12.435 --> 00:28:13.196]  How are you doing?
[00:28:13.736 --> 00:28:14.257]  Very good.
[00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:17.910]  Did you guys notice you're in the middle of the walkway?
[00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:18.010]  Yeah.
[00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:19.831]  Sorry.
[00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:20.471]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:20.871 --> 00:28:25.492]  Have you noticed that people have all been walking around looking at their phones?
[00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:26.153]  Yes.
[00:28:27.313 --> 00:28:28.353]  I have noticed that, yeah.
[00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:29.934]  What do you think about that?
[00:28:30.014 --> 00:28:33.295]  Are you less likely to go up and talk to someone if they're looking down at their phone?
[00:28:34.766 --> 00:28:35.907]  Yes, actually, probably.
[00:28:35.927 --> 00:28:39.971]  But I also work in digital, so I'm on my phone 24-7.
[00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:46.176]  So, I just kind of take it as it is what it is, and that's that.
[00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:52.201]  Do you think that they're looking at their phone because they're wanting to look like they're doing something, or they're socially awkward?
[00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:53.402]  Oh, I'm sure.
[00:28:53.442 --> 00:28:54.503]  I've definitely done that before.
[00:28:55.544 --> 00:29:00.889]  What do you think about cell phone usage and how everybody's kind of on their phones all the time now?
[00:29:02.065 --> 00:29:06.427]  Well, it depends on, you know, what to do with it, you know?
[00:29:06.447 --> 00:29:10.508]  I think that efficiency comes when you know what are you doing with your phone.
[00:29:10.528 --> 00:29:13.289]  And if that saves you time, then that's fine.
[00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:16.270]  But it's that basic, right?
[00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:21.452]  Do you think it kind of discourages social engagement and interaction with people?
[00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:22.719]  No, I don't.
[00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:31.502]  I think that it gives you much more opportunities to just, you know, hit up someone that you want and don't bother that other person because that other person could be doing something else.
[00:29:32.282 --> 00:29:35.063]  And, you know, we are, yeah, pretty busy usually.
[00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:42.266]  Do you often see that as you're walking around people are always on their phones looking down?
[00:29:43.286 --> 00:29:43.666]  Sometimes.
[00:29:44.329 --> 00:29:44.569]  Yeah.
[00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:52.355]  How often do people like just say hi and hey how's it going and just out of nowhere just start talking and having conversation in public?
[00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:54.397]  Depends on where you live.
[00:29:54.837 --> 00:30:03.064]  Do you think that looking at their phones and everyone on their phones discourages social engagement with just people out and about on the street?
[00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:08.068]  Oh yeah, social engagement is going extinct and it's terrible at a terrible rate too.
[00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.870]  So I mean not enough people are looking up.
[00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.232]  Like the world is in front of you, not down here.
[00:30:13.962 --> 00:30:22.925]  Are you wearing this purple suit so that people will at least look up from their phone to look at you and you can engage them with whatever you're selling or giving out?
[00:30:23.265 --> 00:30:31.227]  Oh yeah, I'm doing my best to engage people and showing them that no matter the face, the skin color, anything, that we're all people.
[00:30:31.447 --> 00:30:38.289]  So I'm just out here promoting and helping and I'm doing my part to stay off my phone and engage people face to face.
[00:30:39.924 --> 00:30:41.005]  Alright, thank you very much.
[00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:42.546]  You're an InfoWars listener.
[00:30:42.786 --> 00:30:43.346]  What do you think about it?
[00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:44.587]  I mean, look at these girls over here.
[00:30:45.108 --> 00:30:45.708]  On their phones.
[00:30:45.768 --> 00:30:46.929]  Everybody's on their phones.
[00:30:47.009 --> 00:30:48.410]  Not really socially engaging.
[00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.551]  What do you think about it, though?
[00:30:49.591 --> 00:30:55.174]  I mean, do you think it's a little bit weird that people are always on their phones in America?
[00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:57.536]  I mean, do you think it's like this in every country now?
[00:30:58.377 --> 00:31:00.698]  I don't know about every country, but it definitely goes on here.
[00:31:00.718 --> 00:31:04.821]  Yeah, everybody's kind of got their nose down.
[00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:06.202]  Not aware of what's going on around them.
[00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:13.705]  Yeah, I mean, we've seen a couple people standing in the middle of the walkway, everyone having to go around them, standing in the middle of the road, stuff like that on their phones.
[00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:14.526]  What do you think about that?
[00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:20.249]  Those are people that are just in their own world, and that's all they know, really, is their own world, I guess.
[00:31:21.957 --> 00:31:43.182]  So after speaking to a lot of these people, we have found that a lot of them do it out of social awkwardness, and we're finding that many people actually are losing their skills at socializing because they're so used to having it done easily for them over the internet, where you can have barriers up and you don't have to necessarily embarrass yourself or put yourself out on the line.
[00:31:43.602 --> 00:31:49.664]  So some people do it out of social awkwardness and un- Oh, oh, excuse me, uh, sir!
[00:31:50.839 --> 00:31:51.820]  Look at you!
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.382]  You're a fake news yourself!
[00:31:54.483 --> 00:31:54.823]  Yeah.
[00:31:55.104 --> 00:31:55.965]  Who are you with?
[00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:59.268]  Who are you with, since you want to interrupt what I'm saying?
[00:31:59.608 --> 00:32:00.710]  Well, it's bullsh** I'm saying anyway.
[00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.490]  Well, who are you with?
[00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.171]  You've got a camera.
[00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:02.792]  Who are you with?
[00:32:03.032 --> 00:32:05.074]  I'm videotaping a company party.
[00:32:05.234 --> 00:32:09.359]  I'm not in the media at all, so... So why do you say InfoWars is fake news?
[00:32:09.379 --> 00:32:11.201]  It's totally f***ing bullsh** news.
[00:32:12.546 --> 00:32:13.286]  Okay, and why?
[00:32:13.366 --> 00:32:14.186]  What's your evidence?
[00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:16.127]  Are you just going to say that without evidence?
[00:32:16.327 --> 00:32:18.588]  Because there's no evidence in any of the news that you guys make up.
[00:32:19.088 --> 00:32:21.468]  Okay, so you don't have evidence for your statements.
[00:32:21.948 --> 00:32:22.709]  That's pretty funny.
[00:32:22.749 --> 00:32:24.749]  That's a fallacy logic you're applying there.
[00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:27.470]  As far as that guy, fake news, same old thing.
[00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.811]  They don't actually have any argument or evidence to back up their ad hominem attacks.
[00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.512]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:16.045]  He's got so much to get into about what's really happening in Washington, what he thinks Trump needs to do, the way things really work there, the fact that Trump's only gotten people in one deep.
[00:37:16.665 --> 00:37:25.289]  And some of these observations are made based upon my experience during the transition from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in 1980.
[00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:28.852]  Personnel is policy.
[00:37:28.932 --> 00:37:33.395]  And as you pointed out, Alex, it's critical that you have your team in.
[00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:35.997]  That's the way that politics works.
[00:37:36.017 --> 00:37:38.979]  You have elections, new people with new ideas come in.
[00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:50.207]  At present, we have really only a handful of Trump-appointed officials running key agencies at the Department of Defense, Department of State, at the Justice Department.
[00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:54.370]  The others are either vacant or they're Obama holdovers.
[00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:04.157]  And you can't have a changing ship of state with only a few hands when you're running a $4.3 trillion enterprise.
[00:38:04.658 --> 00:38:11.383]  It's got over 2 million federal employees, more than 2 million federal contractors with a handful.
[00:38:11.443 --> 00:38:12.664]  There's too much going on.
[00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:17.666]  In order to take control of the policy, and I think that's why there's been so many distractions.
[00:38:17.706 --> 00:38:28.751]  So, the first thing I would recommend that the President consider is filling many of the positions at the second and third tier levels of the Department of Justice, which is critical.
[00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:33.473]  Judge Napolitano, I would suggest, would make a splendid Deputy Attorney General.
[00:38:34.033 --> 00:38:37.875]  What if the widely perceived differences between the two parties was just an illusion?
[00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:43.076]  What if the heart of the government policy remains the same, no matter who's in the White House?
[00:38:43.617 --> 00:38:47.381]  What if the heart of government policy remains the same, no matter what the people want?
[00:38:48.288 --> 00:38:53.889]  What if those vaunted differences between Democrat and Republican were actually just minor disagreements?
[00:38:54.509 --> 00:39:01.350]  What if both parties just want power and are willing to have young people fight meaningless wars in order to enhance that power?
[00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:06.351]  Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University, head office of legal counsel.
[00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:09.632]  National sovereignty has a meaning.
[00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:11.212]  It's not just human rights.
[00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:15.573]  It has a meaning that brings stability to our world.
[00:39:15.913 --> 00:39:17.613]  We've become the judge and jury
[00:39:18.126 --> 00:39:19.567]  of people all around the world.
[00:39:20.307 --> 00:39:22.988]  We just kill them because we are America.
[00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:32.312]  And we give no thought at all of what happens when China and Russia and Iran make the same claims.
[00:39:33.213 --> 00:39:35.714]  It's not just willfully blind.
[00:39:36.714 --> 00:39:38.075]  It's self-destructive.
[00:39:39.695 --> 00:39:47.219]  I am sure that my children will live to see the day when people start taking out targets on U.S.
[00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:47.499]  soil.
[00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:53.973]  Richard Epstein, a University of Chicago professor, very much devoted to property rights, a solicitor general.
[00:39:54.354 --> 00:39:57.575]  I am, in effect, a kind of an old-line classical liberal.
[00:39:58.136 --> 00:40:07.761]  And the basic propositions that somebody of my particular persuasions believe can be summarized relatively simply, if you ignore some of the inevitable complications.
[00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:17.126]  And the first of them is that you tend to believe in limited government, in which discretion is regarded as a necessary evil, rather than some kind of a welcome good.
[00:40:17.646 --> 00:40:22.468]  Tom Campbell, former Republican Congressman, Associate Attorney General.
[00:40:22.508 --> 00:40:27.569]  How much of the TARP money actually went to purchase mortgage-backed securities?
[00:40:28.549 --> 00:40:28.769]  None.
[00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.011]  Instead, the money went to purchase stock.
[00:40:33.651 --> 00:40:39.533]  Now, I promised to say why I thought the expenditure was harmful economically, morally, and internationally.
[00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:41.133]  Let me speak about morally.
[00:40:42.133 --> 00:40:43.914]  We use the money and our children pay it back.
[00:40:45.695 --> 00:40:47.095]  I don't know anything more immoral than that.
[00:40:49.192 --> 00:40:54.615]  The tradition is that we make the world better for our children, not that we spend their money.
[00:40:55.275 --> 00:40:56.276]  And yet that's what we're doing.
[00:40:56.296 --> 00:40:57.737]  That's why I call it a moral issue.
[00:40:58.397 --> 00:41:08.823]  If you use that money to defeat Nazis and fascists and the Imperial Japanese Army, yes, then you're handing your children something well worth incurring the debt.
[00:41:09.303 --> 00:41:13.466]  But what we did was to use that expenditure in order to buy re-election.
[00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:18.499]  These are the kinds of names that have to be gotten in place very quickly.
[00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:25.522]  Otherwise, you're going to be fighting firefights every single day because you're going to be dealing with people who are not yours.
[00:41:25.562 --> 00:41:26.582]  They're not loyal to you.
[00:41:26.922 --> 00:41:31.364]  They're holdovers and they don't have any incentive for your administration to succeed.
[00:41:31.684 --> 00:41:32.965]  It doesn't work like business.
[00:41:33.005 --> 00:41:36.346]  In government, oftentimes, two plus two is five, or it's three.
[00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:42.750]  And so you need people with different backgrounds and different expertise than those who can bring in profits in business.
[00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:51.674]  And that means that people, I mean, I've been in Washington almost 50 years, you know, deal circles with people, you build up names, people you trust their judgment.
[00:41:52.274 --> 00:41:56.817]  From those lists, you then compile, all right, we think these are the slots that could be filled.
[00:42:07.199 --> 00:42:10.723]  What do I need to, uh, things that need to be changed?
[00:42:11.644 --> 00:42:14.808]  Uh, basically to keep everything remain the same.
[00:42:15.789 --> 00:42:17.732]  Everything has to be remain the same.
[00:42:18.252 --> 00:42:19.274]  You think everything's good right now?
[00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:19.955]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:20.095 --> 00:42:22.077]  Everything is awesome, outstanding.
[00:42:22.277 --> 00:42:24.120]  This country is so screwed up, man.
[00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:30.821]  I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but it's reaching a proportion!
[00:42:31.121 --> 00:42:33.324]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see him!
[00:42:33.664 --> 00:42:34.706]  This has to be a joke!
[00:42:34.806 --> 00:42:36.448]  I cannot believe this is happening!
[00:42:36.769 --> 00:42:39.232]  I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself!
[00:42:41.034 --> 00:42:45.857]  You know that guy's a coward.
[00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:50.180]  You know he's a piece of garbage.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.441]  You know he's weak!
[00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:08.633]  Don't do it!
[00:43:18.882 --> 00:43:19.382]  They're demons.
[00:43:20.003 --> 00:43:22.144]  They're frickin' interdimensional invaders, okay?
[00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:27.446]  I'll just say it, make fun of me all you want on CNN or wherever, but everyone already innately knows this.
[00:43:27.666 --> 00:43:30.327]  These people are not frickin' humans, okay?
[00:43:30.988 --> 00:43:31.428]  Yes!
[00:43:32.548 --> 00:43:37.150]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:43:37.291 --> 00:43:38.011]  You wanna fight?
[00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:41.993]  You're gonna get one, you inhuman, soulless pieces of trash!
[00:43:42.654 --> 00:43:43.994]  I see you real good!
[00:43:44.014 --> 00:43:46.916]  And I know our species is stronger than you and better than you!
[00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:48.057]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[00:43:48.137 --> 00:43:48.957]  Get that through your head!
[00:43:48.997 --> 00:43:50.818]  Hello to the camera, smart bear!
[00:43:51.759 --> 00:43:53.260]  Hi, I'm a smart bear!
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:02.605]  And I say what's the... And I tell the actual truth by definitions, no matter how much it means to bring these conservatives confused!
[00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:04.006]  What is that joke?!
[00:44:04.226 --> 00:44:04.866]  What is that?!
[00:44:05.106 --> 00:44:05.747]  What is that?! !
[00:44:09.144 --> 00:44:09.825]  What is Hitler?
[00:44:09.865 --> 00:44:10.645]  What is Stalin?
[00:44:10.826 --> 00:44:11.546]  What is Mao?
[00:44:12.147 --> 00:44:13.208]  What is all this stuff?
[00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:14.369]  Calling me a white knight?
[00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:16.070]  I don't care what you call me!
[00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:17.111]  I'm right!
[00:44:18.052 --> 00:44:18.933]  And you're wrong!
[00:44:19.494 --> 00:44:21.295]  You are nothing but Alex Jones's b****!
[00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:25.603]  He's your boss, and you've been drinking way too much of his Kool-Aid.
[00:44:25.983 --> 00:44:27.345]  Have you gone to his channel lately?
[00:44:27.405 --> 00:44:28.847]  All he talks about is football.
[00:44:29.627 --> 00:44:30.709]  Go to ESPN!
[00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:33.172]  Don't try to tell the world how it should work!
[00:44:33.552 --> 00:44:34.093]  You know what?
[00:44:34.954 --> 00:44:41.722]  Yeah, your diabetes doubled the last decade besides your cancer, but hmm... We got white papers talking about how we're doing it to you, so what?
[00:44:42.563 --> 00:44:43.704]  Yo, there's a football game on.
[00:44:43.724 --> 00:44:44.885]  Here you go, doggie.
[00:44:45.025 --> 00:44:45.485]  Football game!
[00:44:45.505 --> 00:44:46.766]  Don't worry, we're killing you.
[00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:57.054]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:44:58.175 --> 00:45:00.437]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:45:00.877 --> 00:45:05.781]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation is amazing.
[00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:07.162]  I will not let you down.
[00:45:10.658 --> 00:45:12.019]  We know we're under attack!
[00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:12.960]  We know it!
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.561]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[00:45:17.363 --> 00:45:19.064]  We're coming for you, globalists!
[00:45:19.644 --> 00:45:21.045]  Coming for you!
[00:45:21.546 --> 00:45:22.486]  Coming for you!
[00:45:23.107 --> 00:45:24.187]  We know what you're doing!
[00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:27.350]  I'm sorry.
[00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:33.354]  I just get fired up when I think about what they're doing to us and how I want to resist them.
[00:45:34.555 --> 00:45:36.036]  And how easy they are to defeat.
[00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:45.799]  Excuse me.
[00:45:47.481 --> 00:45:49.002]  I think my testosterone's going up.
[00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:51.324]  This happens every time I start working out a lot again.
[00:45:52.665 --> 00:45:56.068]  And I, uh, swam two miles this morning pretty hard.
[00:45:56.368 --> 00:45:58.670]  And, uh, ate a big fat steak last night.
[00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.172]  It's full of hormones, testosterone on its own right.
[00:46:01.993 --> 00:46:03.194]  So I'm going a little bit wild today.
[00:46:03.234 --> 00:46:03.614]  Excuse me.
[00:46:03.974 --> 00:46:05.596]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:46:05.636 --> 00:46:07.777]  So are you with the group that was running around topless earlier?
[00:46:08.558 --> 00:46:09.519]  No, I'm with myself.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.101]  Three other homies.
[00:46:22.933 --> 00:46:23.754]  Oh my god.
[00:46:24.775 --> 00:46:25.615]  Oh my god.
[00:46:25.675 --> 00:46:28.818]  We're being invaded by South American walruses.
[00:46:29.779 --> 00:46:31.860]  It's ridiculous.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.163]  The government is shimmying in 42,000 people.
[00:46:35.223 --> 00:46:39.026]  They're as big as a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.438 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.848]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.434 --> 00:48:49.475]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.157]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.518 --> 00:48:59.067]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.087 --> 00:48:59.968]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.988 --> 00:49:00.028]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.758 --> 00:49:19.729]  Last night, Stephen Colbert mocked Kellyanne Conway for suggesting that there's a variety of ways that the surveillance state would be monitoring someone who is of interest to them, like a candidate Trump or President-elect Trump.
[00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:23.233]  She'd gone on a show and said, there's a lot of different ways we can surveil each other.
[00:49:23.653 --> 00:49:26.756]  You can surveil somebody through their phones, through their television sets.
[00:49:27.216 --> 00:49:29.317]  Through microwaves that turn into cameras.
[00:49:29.358 --> 00:49:39.565]  And of course, that was the cue for Stephen Colbert to ignore the fact that we all know through the Snowden documents, through Vault 7, that yes, they are in fact looking at us through television sets, through our phones, they're monitoring everything that we do.
[00:49:39.965 --> 00:49:42.807]  And then seize on microwaves as cameras.
[00:49:42.947 --> 00:49:45.229]  So he says, yes, how do you think we filmed this show?
[00:49:45.269 --> 00:49:51.194]  And so he walks over and he says, look at, show them camera three and they've got a microwave on a tripod.
[00:49:51.234 --> 00:50:01.623]  And then he walks over to the microwave and he, you see his face go into the microwave and he pulls a Hot Pocket out of there and he starts talking to Obama and he says, President Obama, I miss you.
[00:50:01.643 --> 00:50:06.668]  Yeah, it's not a problem if Obama comes after journalists and whistleblowers.
[00:50:07.168 --> 00:50:10.333]  It's not a problem if we've got a police state that's being run by President Obama.
[00:50:10.714 --> 00:50:11.515]  He misses that.
[00:50:12.136 --> 00:50:12.697]  He misses that.
[00:50:13.117 --> 00:50:16.622]  And so, I want to talk to you about whether or not your appliances are actually spying on you.
[00:50:16.683 --> 00:50:17.784]  Is that an absurd idea?
[00:50:18.763 --> 00:50:20.544]  A microwave would be spying on you.
[00:50:38.749 --> 00:50:39.850]  Through their appliances.
[00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.371]  We reported this at InfoWars.
[00:50:41.431 --> 00:50:46.755]  We reported it from Wired Magazine, the Danger Room blog that they had.
[00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:48.356]  And this was their headline at the time.
[00:50:48.396 --> 00:50:52.659]  They said, CIA chief says we'll spy on you through your dishwasher.
[00:50:53.259 --> 00:50:57.162]  They said, more and more personal and household devices are connecting to the internet.
[00:50:57.482 --> 00:51:01.625]  From your television, to your car navigation system, to your light switches.
[00:51:02.166 --> 00:51:06.649]  CIA director David Petraeus cannot wait to spy on you through them.
[00:51:07.009 --> 00:51:09.411]  Oh, but now it's silly to talk about that.
[00:51:10.572 --> 00:51:14.536]  We can mock anybody who says, oh, they're using your microwave oven to look at you.
[00:51:14.596 --> 00:51:18.099]  Well, you know, we had ZDNet talk about it at the same time, reported the same story.
[00:51:18.139 --> 00:51:21.361]  They said, CIA says we'll spy on you through your refrigerator.
[00:51:22.233 --> 00:51:25.256]  Your household appliances, such as dishwashers, ovens.
[00:51:25.776 --> 00:51:27.037]  Would that be microwave ovens?
[00:51:27.137 --> 00:51:29.039]  Oh no, not microwave ovens, regular ovens.
[00:51:29.079 --> 00:51:30.740]  We could never do it with a microwave oven, right?
[00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:35.284]  Stereo and TVs may someday be used as pioneer.
[00:51:35.304 --> 00:51:35.605]  You know what?
[00:51:35.645 --> 00:51:37.607]  That day has come and passed.
[00:51:37.907 --> 00:51:46.714]  Petraeus says, according to Future Tense, at the time, five years ago, again, it was widely reported with the tech magazines, InfoWars reported on it over and over again, but of course,
[00:51:47.355 --> 00:51:51.380]  Colbert is assuming that his public is not very well informed.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.501]  He may be right about that.
[00:51:52.902 --> 00:51:57.066]  Petraeus said at the time CIA could use smart household appliances to spy.
[00:51:57.707 --> 00:52:02.733]  And then a year later, we talked about January 2013, another story from InfoWars.
[00:52:02.813 --> 00:52:06.097]  Why are rice cookers, oh, microwave ovens?
[00:52:06.137 --> 00:52:07.138]  No, no, no, rice cookers.
[00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:08.819]  Forget microwave ovens.
[00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:10.119]  They could never use microwave ovens.
[00:52:10.159 --> 00:52:14.980]  But rice cookers and fridges are being fitted with internet connections in Android OS.
[00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:32.944]  They said at the time Bloomberg today, that was January 2013, four years ago, carries a report that details how seemingly innocuous electrical appliances such as rice cookers, refrigerators, are now being manufactured with Google Android operating system and an internet connection.
[00:52:33.604 --> 00:52:38.288]  Of course, the article suggests this is a good thing, a helpful, innovative, technological leap.
[00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:44.052]  The truth, however, is that gadgets have now become tools for spying on you in your own home.
[00:52:44.092 --> 00:52:46.994]  We were telling you that at InfoWars four years ago.
[00:52:47.715 --> 00:52:50.477]  Then, go back to December this last year, December 2016.
[00:52:52.642 --> 00:52:56.124]  Can Amazon Echo testify against you?
[00:52:56.384 --> 00:52:57.225]  Well, why'd this come up?
[00:52:57.285 --> 00:53:02.768]  They had a murder case in Bentonville, Arkansas, and they were trying to get information from Amazon Echo.
[00:53:02.808 --> 00:53:06.130]  Yes, your smart home can testify against you.
[00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.271]  That's what Realtor.com was saying a week ago.
[00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:10.932]  Are your smart home devices spying on you?
[00:53:10.952 --> 00:53:11.753]  Of course they are!
[00:53:13.071 --> 00:53:14.412]  They say, here's how to protect yourself.
[00:53:14.913 --> 00:53:16.534]  Realtor.com even knows it.
[00:53:16.634 --> 00:53:17.775]  It's an open secret.
[00:53:18.355 --> 00:53:20.957]  So the question is, why would Stephen Colbert do this?
[00:53:21.178 --> 00:53:34.088]  And even better yet, why would Wired Magazine, the people who reported David Petraeus' profession about Big Brother five years ago, why would Wired Magazine now, five years later, come out and say, sorry Kellyanne Conway,
[00:53:34.668 --> 00:53:36.730]  Microwaves can't spy on you.
[00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.171]  Oh no, they can't.
[00:53:38.672 --> 00:53:48.821]  They say, if you've been feeling a little paranoid lately, like even your standing mixer may be spying on you, rest assured that Trump Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway shares your struggle.
[00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:59.250]  And then as you go through the article, you see that it says, unless it's voice-activated microwave oven connected to the internet, I can't think of any way that a microwave would spy on you.
[00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:00.550]  Of course not!
[00:54:00.911 --> 00:54:03.392]  That's the whole damn point, isn't it?
[00:54:03.932 --> 00:54:07.794]  That they're putting the operating systems on everything from rice cookers to microwave ovens.
[00:54:08.274 --> 00:54:09.935]  And that's what we were telling you this entire time.
[00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:12.956]  Four years ago, Bloomberg was bragging about the fact that they were doing that.
[00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:15.978]  But of course, we're not supposed to think that that's the case.
[00:54:16.858 --> 00:54:25.066]  Isn't it interesting that the same Stephen Colbert, a week ago, as Vault 7 came out, what was the first response of Stephen Colbert?
[00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:34.575]  Well, let's get Mr. Big Brother himself, the very personification of Big Brother, Michael Hayden, the guy who's been the director of the CIA and director of the NSA.
[00:54:35.075 --> 00:54:41.381]  He brings him on his show to tell us how the government is not spying on us through our televisions.
[00:54:41.601 --> 00:54:44.762]  Don't believe your lying eyes for the WikiLeaks documents.
[00:54:44.862 --> 00:54:48.344]  Don't believe what you see there, that they have created these vulnerabilities.
[00:54:48.444 --> 00:54:50.865]  No, they would never, never do that.
[00:54:51.485 --> 00:54:52.425]  And then it got even better.
[00:54:53.065 --> 00:55:01.289]  CIA director says, well, you know, if Donald Trump is very paranoid about this and he wants to know if the government is spying on him, he could just ask them.
[00:55:01.449 --> 00:55:02.209]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:07.474]  That's run by the Intel guys, Jim Clapper, who's been on the news lately.
[00:55:07.534 --> 00:55:08.675]  And he has said it didn't happen.
[00:55:08.735 --> 00:55:08.935]  Right.
[00:55:09.155 --> 00:55:15.599]  And then the other guy over here who does it for counterintelligence or law enforcement purposes is Jim Comey.
[00:55:15.719 --> 00:55:17.340]  And the rumor is that he's saying it didn't happen.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.081]  He said it didn't happen.
[00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:22.844]  And he's asked the Justice Department to basically put out a statement saying it didn't happen.
[00:55:22.864 --> 00:55:23.184]  That's right.
[00:55:23.204 --> 00:55:32.390]  So what the president could have done is kind of hit the switch there on the phone and say, get me Comey, get me the acting director of national intelligence, have him down here for lunch.
[00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.191]  I got a question.
[00:55:34.154 --> 00:55:36.803]  And then you could simply ask them and get a response.
[00:55:36.823 --> 00:55:37.867]  We didn't choose to do that.
[00:55:38.274 --> 00:55:39.675]  Yeah, why doesn't Trump just ask?
[00:55:39.715 --> 00:55:40.135]  Well, you know what?
[00:55:40.275 --> 00:55:48.719]  I posted a flashback from two years ago, where Michael Hayden was talking to people at Washington and Lee, and he was saying, I don't need any authority, special authority, to spy on people.
[00:55:48.759 --> 00:55:49.839]  He admitted that the U.S.
[00:55:49.899 --> 00:55:50.639]  is a dictatorship.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.060]  You can see that video right there.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:57.703]  But one of the other things he said was, shame on Ron Wyden for making James Clapper lie.
[00:55:58.203 --> 00:56:02.024]  He said Ron Wyden knew they were spying on everybody, so did his staff, so did the rest of the senators there.
[00:56:02.064 --> 00:56:02.925]  Why did he make him lie?
[00:56:03.225 --> 00:56:05.046]  That was awful that he did that.
[00:56:05.926 --> 00:56:07.047]  We know they're going to lie to us.
[00:56:07.427 --> 00:56:12.310]  Of course, no problem with James Clapper actually violating the Constitution and the law by doing that.
[00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:16.032]  No problem with him admitting that he's operating as a dictatorship.
[00:56:16.613 --> 00:56:18.754]  No, we should be upset with the people who expose it.
[00:56:18.914 --> 00:56:21.576]  People like Kellyanne Conway, Ron Wyden, and others.
[00:56:22.316 --> 00:56:27.380]  You know, when I look at this, we've got to ask, is Colbert a quizzling or a fool?
[00:56:28.328 --> 00:56:29.428]  Well, I think he's quizzling.
[00:56:29.688 --> 00:56:36.651]  He's trying to fool his uninformed, partisan audience, who will laugh at anything.
[00:56:37.431 --> 00:56:44.113]  You know, we had the CIA running Operation Mockingbird, where they told the press, the news, what to put out that was favorable to them.
[00:56:44.633 --> 00:56:47.094]  Now they've moved on to entertainment, as we talked about last night.
[00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:52.716]  I think what we've got now, instead of Operation Mockingbird, I think we've got something like Operation Dead Parrot.
[00:56:52.736 --> 00:56:54.576]  Remember that skit from Monty Python?
[00:56:54.616 --> 00:56:57.237]  Let's let them tell us how this works.
[00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:02.584]  I wish to complain about this parrot that I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.
[00:57:02.824 --> 00:57:03.925]  Oh yes, the Norwegian Blue.
[00:57:03.945 --> 00:57:04.486]  What's wrong with it?
[00:57:04.566 --> 00:57:05.586]  I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
[00:57:06.167 --> 00:57:08.689]  It's dead, that's what's wrong with it.
[00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:10.190]  No, no, it's resting, look.
[00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:15.413]  Look, my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one and I'm looking at one right now.
[00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:16.934]  No, no, it's not dead, it's resting.
[00:57:17.195 --> 00:57:17.675]  Resting?
[00:57:17.915 --> 00:57:18.155]  Yeah.
[00:57:18.676 --> 00:57:20.177]  Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue.
[00:57:20.257 --> 00:57:21.218]  Beautiful plumage, isn't it?
[00:57:21.518 --> 00:57:23.099]  The plumage don't enter into it.
[00:57:24.284 --> 00:57:25.726]  Yeah, the plumage doesn't enter into it.
[00:57:25.946 --> 00:57:27.388]  See how he distracts him from it?
[00:57:27.888 --> 00:57:29.270]  See, he says, this parrot is dead.
[00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:30.311]  No, it's not dead.
[00:57:30.331 --> 00:57:30.972]  He's just resting.
[00:57:31.012 --> 00:57:31.612]  It's a special kind.
[00:57:31.773 --> 00:57:35.357]  He starts to get into the details, exactly what Wired Magazine did with the microwave.
[00:57:35.377 --> 00:57:38.180]  They said microwaves shield information, so we couldn't use that.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.082]  Well, unless, of course, it's connected to the internet.
[00:57:40.202 --> 00:57:41.463]  You know, don't tell anybody about that.
[00:57:41.884 --> 00:57:43.225]  That's precisely the way they do this.
[00:57:43.846 --> 00:57:45.287]  The lies of Big Brother.
[00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:46.228]  The double think.
[00:57:46.528 --> 00:57:49.571]  It's so much easier to accomplish if it's done to a laugh track.
[00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:52.873]  So let's go back and read what David Petraeus said five years ago.
[00:57:52.893 --> 00:57:55.335]  We'll play a laugh track for you, just like Stephen Colbert would.
[00:57:55.916 --> 00:58:00.940]  Transformational is an overused word, but I do believe it properly applies to these technologies.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.103]  Particularly to those on clandestine tradecraft.
[00:58:08.706 --> 00:58:12.209]  It will change our notions of identity and secrecy.
[00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:27.615]  The current internet of PCs will move, of course, toward an internet of things, of devices of all types, 50 to 100 billion of which will be connected to the internet by 2020.
[00:58:27.655 --> 00:58:36.740]  And we will get a treasure trove of data if you're a person of interest.
[00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.071]  Now wasn't that nice?
[00:58:44.572 --> 00:58:46.735]  If we have a laugh track there, you know, it's so nice.
[00:58:46.935 --> 00:58:49.259]  We can actually live with the Big Brother state.
[00:58:49.639 --> 00:58:50.821]  And who would be a person of interest?
[00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:52.303]  Maybe somebody like Donald Trump.
[00:58:52.764 --> 00:58:54.186]  Well that's it for tonight's nightly news.
[00:58:54.606 --> 00:58:56.709]  Join us again tomorrow night at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[00:58:56.769 --> 00:58:57.050]  Eastern.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:38.604]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.265 --> 00:59:41.706]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.087 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
