[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:00.630]  I don't know.
[00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:22.611]  Starting right here and right now.
[00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:25.834]  Because this moment is your moment.
[00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:27.815]  It belongs to you.
[00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:29.497]  This is your day.
[00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:31.679]  This is your celebration.
[00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.944]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:46.432]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.808]  We're great again!
[00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:57.493]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:00:58.094 --> 00:00:59.414]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:03.177]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:11.282]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:16.285]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:21.908]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:29.814]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:34.498]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:40.503]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:43.605]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:47.067]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:51.009]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.810]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:01:55.111 --> 00:02:01.276]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:04.558]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:10.102]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:16.486]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:19.769]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.350]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.711]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.752]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:30.412]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.673]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.273]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:02:36.553 --> 00:02:37.533]  It's in powder form.
[00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:40.314]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.114]  I take this.
[00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:42.914]  This is the product that I take.
[00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:44.995]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:46.596]  We fight the Globals.
[00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:47.476]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:51.959]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:59.157]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:06.699]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:17.841]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:25.910]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Supermail Vitality, and so many others.
[00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:35.522]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:40.006]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:47.013]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:48.474]  That means it's clean.
[00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:49.875]  That means it's pure.
[00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:52.738]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:54.560]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.605]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:10.636]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:04:10.796 --> 00:04:15.719]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.341]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:19.902]  It helps detoxify.
[00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:22.964]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:27.767]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:34.032]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:39.335]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:43.378]  We will make America great again!
[00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:07.459]  And welcome back to InfoWars' 14-hour Freedom Fest.
[00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.562]  We are here together covering live the presidential inauguration.
[00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:18.928]  Of course, Donald Trump resisted all of the pressure from those protesters and those never-Trumpers and all the Hollywood elitists.
[00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:24.210]  And he has officially become the 45th President of the United States of America.
[00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:31.033]  I am joined by the beautiful Margaret Howell and of course Adam Curry, the co-host of the No Agenda Show, noagendashow.com.
[00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:31.353]  Hi!
[00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:31.993]  Welcome!
[00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:32.454]  Thank you.
[00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:33.894]  So, you guys, sum it up.
[00:05:34.014 --> 00:05:36.615]  I mean, we could see Michelle Obama's face.
[00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:38.596]  I mean, I think she made it pretty clear how she felt.
[00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.457]  What did you guys think about the inauguration?
[00:05:41.537 --> 00:05:42.118]  Well, first of all...
[00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:44.179]  Hillary looked doped up.
[00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.819]  Oh yeah.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.501]  Bill kept looking at Melania the whole time.
[00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.242]  I don't know if you guys covered that.
[00:05:50.262 --> 00:05:51.782]  Bill couldn't look at her.
[00:05:51.862 --> 00:05:53.863]  It was a little creepy the way he was looking.
[00:05:55.024 --> 00:06:02.027]  We're actually looking for that clip because we want to do a segment about, you know, he just can't resist a beautiful... I mean, any woman, frankly.
[00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:03.388]  She is really stunning, though.
[00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:04.628]  He really telegraphs.
[00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:04.908]  He's like...
[00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:09.117]  A little rude, actually.
[00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:22.121]  Yes, I think the Drudge headline was glum and glummer, because the Clintons really looked, you could see that their power was no more, no one was kissing the ring of the Clintons there, and they were just trying to hold it in.
[00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:29.203]  Some people even snubbed them, didn't even go for handshakes, and Hillary Clinton was giving these icy stares.
[00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:34.925]  I'm an empath, so I sort of felt a little bad for her, but, you know, we did that.
[00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:35.745]  We did that.
[00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:36.345]  We did that.
[00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.846]  We actually did do that.
[00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:38.866]  You say that lightly.
[00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:39.566]  We really did.
[00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:43.928]  We put our hearts and souls into making sure that she did not become president of the United States.
[00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:44.828]  Our dark hearts.
[00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:46.148]  Our dark hearts, exactly.
[00:06:46.248 --> 00:06:48.049]  Well, Alex has a very dark heart.
[00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.450]  Ours are moderate.
[00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.950]  I'm joking.
[00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.531]  Dark hearts, and of course, fake news, and sponsored by Russia.
[00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:53.851]  All that.
[00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:54.711]  To make sure I'm in the right place.
[00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:55.832]  We did all of that.
[00:06:56.872 --> 00:07:03.776]  I think that Russia still, right now, their translation is a little slow, which is why sometimes our comments are delayed a little because we have to have them translated.
[00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:06.818]  Actually, I should have gotten that off my phone.
[00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:08.980]  I have a picture of the invite for Vladimir Putin.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.921]  He was invited, for sure.
[00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:18.265]  Yeah, you've got to go through KGB, the Kremlins, they've got their own frisking process that you've got to go through.
[00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:33.701]  Well, I know the meme that's going around right now is Michelle Obama's face, and everyone's just taking, she's really good at giving a side eye, and they're saying Michelle Obama is all of our, is all of us for the next four years, just taking that side eye.
[00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:35.343]  She really wasn't trying to hide the fact that
[00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:41.889]  A, she's ready to step out of there, and B, she's kind of not hiding how she really feels about Donald Trump.
[00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.856]  Yeah, that was pretty obvious, but on the other hand, for me, it's just watching it, and I just scanned through the channels.
[00:07:49.496 --> 00:07:50.337]  What a beautiful day!
[00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:53.840]  I mean, everything kind of worked out perfectly, everything went according to plan.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.223]  There were supposed to be jets flying over, I never saw that.
[00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:57.924]  I didn't either.
[00:07:57.964 --> 00:07:58.904]  I don't think that happened.
[00:08:00.766 --> 00:08:03.388]  You know, this is a great day in America.
[00:08:03.448 --> 00:08:10.794]  Whenever this happens, no matter who becomes president, it was really nice to watch, really good to see that everything went reasonably smoothly.
[00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:16.739]  I mean, when I saw CNN the other day with, well, what happens if there's a terrorist attack and all these people are wiped out?
[00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:17.559]  Who will be president?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.041]  Why are they even putting that out there?
[00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:20.542]  We're not just fake news.
[00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:22.804]  We're going to bring out these hypothetical scenarios.
[00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.425]  It's almost like they wanted that to happen, Adam.
[00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:30.788]  You know, if I didn't know better, I would think that they were actually planning for an assassination attempt.
[00:08:30.808 --> 00:08:31.768]  There's still time!
[00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:32.669]  Anyone out there?
[00:08:32.689 --> 00:08:34.170]  Do you have any crazy ideas?
[00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.631]  It was an emotional day, was it not?
[00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:38.492]  Like, listening to his speech, I was actually crying at my desk, just a little.
[00:08:38.512 --> 00:08:39.873]  Like, you can't hold it back.
[00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:41.013]  It was so emotional.
[00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:41.894]  I like short speeches.
[00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:42.394]  I like that.
[00:08:42.474 --> 00:08:42.714]  Short.
[00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:44.035]  Short speech, good.
[00:08:44.695 --> 00:08:47.437]  Man, all about America.
[00:08:48.157 --> 00:09:05.052]  Well, most importantly, and this is something that I've been harping on for the past year and a half, Trump, the whole campaign, one of the few people in this race who consistently would say, our country.
[00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:08.253]  There's always this country, this country, in this country.
[00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:12.595]  But I continuously heard Trump say, in our country, we're going to make our country great again.
[00:09:12.655 --> 00:09:15.896]  And that kind of spread throughout all his appointees as well.
[00:09:15.916 --> 00:09:16.396]  I like that.
[00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:18.857]  It's subtle, but I think it makes a big difference.
[00:09:18.997 --> 00:09:19.857]  Very big difference.
[00:09:19.957 --> 00:09:21.018]  As an empath, you should know that.
[00:09:21.058 --> 00:09:21.858]  Yes, very subtle.
[00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:28.682]  And just, you know, watching Melania as she was walking down the steps, you can tell, and even yesterday... What an outfit, by the way!
[00:09:28.962 --> 00:09:30.023]  What an outfit!
[00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:30.683]  Fantastic!
[00:09:30.723 --> 00:09:34.666]  Yeah, very Jackie O. Totally, with the gloves, the shoes, just beautiful.
[00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:49.636]  Very classy, and you could just, even yesterday when they were there at the Arlington Cemetery, they were, you could just tell that they were really humbled and sort of like, whoa, we are about to enter the White House, we did this, like, and I felt the same way, just sort of,
[00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:58.358]  I mean, I guess probably eight years ago with your black community, seeing a black president going in, like, yeah, all of us can get there.
[00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:06.540]  I mean, you know, there's a lot of girls that think that maybe they have a sordid past or maybe they have some pictures they don't want out there.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.101]  And look, it really backfired on them, didn't it?
[00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:11.103]  We're trying to muddy her up.
[00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.046]  The only thing that did was make her human, frankly.
[00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:16.989]  It resonated with, as you say, so many people.
[00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.553]  Nobody at this table, of course, has any... Anyway, I'm joking.
[00:10:24.738 --> 00:10:42.378]  We're talking about an immigrant who speaks with an accent, who does have photographs out there that people have tried to use against her, and she really came across as very stunning, very first lady-like, and somebody you would aspire to be.
[00:10:42.398 --> 00:10:42.538]  Wow.
[00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:58.365]  And it's so interesting how for the last few years there's been this whole pushback against slut shaming and all of that and that it would be the very people who have been trying to push this agenda who then would try to turn that around and take Melania down.
[00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:03.431]  Well, this happened after November 8th, really.
[00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:06.234]  We are living in parallel universes.
[00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:10.880]  I mean, it's hard to exactly explain how that is, but it's happened.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.122]  I mean, multi-dimensions exist.
[00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:13.483]  I am convinced this is happening.
[00:11:13.503 --> 00:11:13.764]  Agreed.
[00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:17.709]  You can have two people look at the exact same information, and one will say,
[00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:19.851]  This is great, and the other will say this is horrible.
[00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.593]  And it's the same information.
[00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:29.621]  And I hope this rift in the universe clears up a little bit, because it's not a good thing.
[00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:30.222]  Yeah.
[00:11:30.362 --> 00:11:31.643]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.486]  It's almost as if it's superimposed.
[00:11:35.347 --> 00:11:49.003]  Those two, the multiverse, it has actually split because on the one hand you have all these people that are so ready, so excited to get moving and move to the bigger and better things and the higher power and just listening to Donald Trump's speech.
[00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:53.450]  People will hear the exact opposite of what he said.
[00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.751]  That is correct.
[00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.454]  That's exactly what happens in an alternate universe.
[00:11:57.734 --> 00:12:03.840]  And I've heard people even on CNN say, oh, I'm living in an alternate universe for a minute, because they don't agree with what's being said.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.062]  Oh, because they're trying to pump out what's not reality.
[00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:09.205]  But I believe that it actually is happening.
[00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:12.337]  I'm excited about that.
[00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:14.659]  I like the rift.
[00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:18.282]  Alex was talking about the energy earlier, and the energy has really changed.
[00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:23.166]  You can feel almost a relief, like a release of something really dark, frankly.
[00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:24.267]  That's how I feel anyway.
[00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:27.109]  I mean, we were talking about this in the hallway.
[00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.692]  We're just joyous.
[00:12:29.772 --> 00:12:35.316]  There seems to be a release of energy, and it's just been, you know, just a calm joy, frankly.
[00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.099]  Well, this is, the negativity is not over.
[00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:41.521]  That's a good point.
[00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:46.405]  My favorite place to go is the face bag, you know, to see what people are saying.
[00:12:46.745 --> 00:12:52.430]  This article that was going around for the past couple of days, it was a Politico article, and they got a bunch of mainstream journalists together.
[00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.972]  I wish there was audio or video of it, I don't know if there is.
[00:12:55.792 --> 00:13:02.255]  Bit by bit going through how they have traveled with him on the campaign and have covered him for years back to 2000, I think even.
[00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:05.896]  And every single one of them is really bitchy.
[00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:09.978]  But the one thing that they are consistently mentioning is Twitter.
[00:13:10.598 --> 00:13:17.961]  This is why this negativity will not stop because here you have now a president who goes directly to the people.
[00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:22.522]  I know everyone says it, but this is not just a small thing what's taking place.
[00:13:22.962 --> 00:13:23.823]  When Obama came in,
[00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:25.904]  This was going to be the internet president.
[00:13:25.984 --> 00:13:28.765]  We were like, oh, whitehouse.gov, it's going to be changed, can't wait.
[00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:30.566]  He'll be tweeting, doing all kinds of stuff.
[00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:32.447]  It was never going to happen.
[00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:33.988]  Very filtered.
[00:13:34.108 --> 00:13:36.149]  The least transparent administration ever.
[00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:37.810]  Well, okay, that's a different topic.
[00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:50.434]  But truly, this was supposed to, because they had won through data and internet and social media, which I think may have not been all that true, or maybe there wasn't enough knowledge in the opposition at the time.
[00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:56.375]  This is actually a president who will use this, and that's not the first time.
[00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:58.576]  And you circumvent the mainstream media.
[00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:03.279]  It makes them mad but I think ultimately it should be a good thing.
[00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:26.817]  Oh it's going to be a great thing and you make a very good point because they say President Obama and then even Hillary Clinton would have had the edge there because she took on his social media team that helped him really win the election and so you would think that they would have had power but it didn't come off as authentic whereas Donald Trump used that same social media power but it came off as authentic as much as they hate to say it because he could be so brash at times.
[00:14:27.197 --> 00:14:30.439]  Everyone keeps saying, you know, reality star makes a big reality.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.040]  Hey, you know what?
[00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:34.542]  Why is reality... We're all reality stars!
[00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:36.223]  It's YouTube era, you know?
[00:14:36.964 --> 00:14:38.685]  Actual reality is what people want.
[00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:42.507]  They also want scripted reality or unscripted drama, whatever it's called.
[00:14:43.108 --> 00:14:45.569]  Because of course reality television is anything but reality.
[00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:53.415]  When you give people actual reality, which means, oh man, there's bumps and warts and some stuff on it and it's not exactly clean and what's going on?
[00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:56.557]  It seems like anger or, you know, just...
[00:14:57.659 --> 00:14:58.560]  People are drawn to that.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.600]  It's a human factor.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.701]  Wait, that wasn't put through a filter.
[00:15:02.842 --> 00:15:07.044]  Yes, and this is what the press is extremely upset about.
[00:15:07.064 --> 00:15:08.665]  It's not tradition.
[00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.586]  This is not protocol.
[00:15:09.626 --> 00:15:10.146]  What are you doing?
[00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:13.868]  Right, and the fact that he is saying that... Is this live now?
[00:15:13.908 --> 00:15:16.370]  I guess they're starting the... He is going to do the walk.
[00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.230]  Yeah, very good.
[00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.531]  He's walking in the street, wow.
[00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:19.031]  Very good.
[00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.934]  That's quite a message to send to everyone that had been... Barron, man, is he tweaking again?
[00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:25.175]  Barron is off the hook.
[00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:27.773]  Yeah, he's funny.
[00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:28.354]  Let me see.
[00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:31.035]  Oh, this is great.
[00:15:31.656 --> 00:15:38.320]  Yeah, so this is good showing, uh, I mean obviously the Secret Service are a little bit nervous about it, but...
[00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:42.524]  They had the doors open even.
[00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:49.109]  They would even not do the typical walk from the car to the White House.
[00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:52.611]  They had to do that with George W. Bush because they were afraid of riots and everything.
[00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:57.635]  So here, as we can see, they keep trying to tell us the country is right on the verge of a new civil war.
[00:15:58.616 --> 00:16:00.678]  Well, I don't think Trump's feeling that.
[00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:03.400]  I'm not in disagreement that there is a new civil war.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.142]  It's just, it's not going to be an actual war that comes to blows.
[00:16:06.162 --> 00:16:06.803]  It's just people
[00:16:08.075 --> 00:16:10.837]  Kissing and moaning at each other on facebag.
[00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:14.119]  I've lost so many friends.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.361]  We're not seeing the snipers on the building.
[00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:19.443]  On any of the buildings, which I'm sure you can only imagine.
[00:16:20.684 --> 00:16:21.044]  Of course.
[00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:25.607]  Yeah, this is pretty incredible.
[00:16:25.647 --> 00:16:27.108]  And I know we've got some guys on the ground there.
[00:16:27.128 --> 00:16:28.048]  Kit Daniels is there.
[00:16:28.169 --> 00:16:29.149]  Owen Schroyer is there.
[00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:31.030]  We've got Millie Weaver there as well.
[00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:35.393]  I know Josh Owens and Michael Zimmerman are with Alex Jones.
[00:16:37.012 --> 00:16:44.634]  Um, it's not a very huge city, but like I said earlier, it takes hours to get anywhere because they've got it really quarantined off.
[00:16:48.155 --> 00:16:50.656]  Just a very short walk, just a little walk.
[00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.717]  Yeah, don't make it all the way up to where those violent protesters were at.
[00:16:53.777 --> 00:16:56.958]  Now, what is the latest on protests?
[00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:01.710]  Have you seen anything with the... We're covering this over the past couple of hours.
[00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.234]  We know that they're going to be heightened when it darkens.
[00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:09.058]  We typically see that when the lights go down and the sun is gone.
[00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:10.940]  Because they're so brave.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.542]  I don't think that's going to happen at all.
[00:17:12.602 --> 00:17:14.024]  I think they're all going to go partying.
[00:17:14.044 --> 00:17:15.565]  There's a whole bunch of dress up parties.
[00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:17.787]  We're all crazy partying.
[00:17:18.128 --> 00:17:20.069]  We hate the patriarchy.
[00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.131]  I think so.
[00:17:22.151 --> 00:17:24.473]  There's tons of dance parties in DC.
[00:17:24.513 --> 00:17:25.514]  I hope you're right.
[00:17:25.574 --> 00:17:29.557]  I'm a little bit jealous that we are in Austin covering this.
[00:17:29.577 --> 00:17:30.938]  Oh, I am so jealous.
[00:17:31.058 --> 00:17:32.499]  I was supposed to be there.
[00:17:37.062 --> 00:17:39.104]  Oh, they have a protest at 5pm if we want to go.
[00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:39.845]  Oh, that's right.
[00:17:39.865 --> 00:17:42.327]  So you'll have fun driving back in traffic.
[00:17:42.347 --> 00:17:44.249]  So we're going to protest here at 5?
[00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:46.231]  There's a protest starting at 5.
[00:17:46.412 --> 00:17:50.155]  There was a campus walkout to be able to... Oh, it's led by a city council member.
[00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:50.896]  Wonderful.
[00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:54.128]  That should be fun.
[00:17:54.508 --> 00:18:03.502]  Antifa, it's the Disrupt J20, and they got their permit for 5-5-30 so they can disrupt rush hour traffic and really truly shut us down as much as they possibly can.
[00:18:03.903 --> 00:18:04.824]  They didn't get the memo.
[00:18:05.024 --> 00:18:05.825]  They've already lost.
[00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:06.947]  Trump's already your president.
[00:18:07.992 --> 00:18:09.353]  Your resistance is futile.
[00:18:10.113 --> 00:18:11.233]  I'm discouraged that the D.C.
[00:18:11.273 --> 00:18:12.154]  police stood down.
[00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:16.616]  I think that the standing down when the woman was getting beating is not a good sign.
[00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:21.217]  So if there are protesters, hopefully they can keep them contained into one place.
[00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:22.778]  Yeah, and of course the D.C.
[00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:31.121]  police were kind of given the orders to let people protest, let them, but that was the thing is that if it starts getting violent, all bets are off, then you can go in.
[00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:34.683]  So it is interesting that they did stand down and watch some protesters
[00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:37.545]  How violent?
[00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:41.248]  We have some blood that has been drawn.
[00:18:41.268 --> 00:18:42.609]  I didn't see any of that.
[00:18:42.629 --> 00:18:50.275]  And there was also last night at the Deplora Ball, a guy got punched in the face, another one got hit in the back of the head with a flagpole and was bleeding everywhere.
[00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:54.499]  Well, you put hundreds of thousands of people together, something's always going to happen.
[00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:56.801]  It seems like it's been pretty peaceful in general.
[00:18:58.802 --> 00:19:02.285]  There were protesters in Austin and Guadalupe earlier walking down the street.
[00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:11.129]  Yeah, actually the vegetarian restaurant that I like to go to here, they're having a big thing, and I didn't even click on it because I was like, oh!
[00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:14.151]  But you know what, I know one of those Red Guards.
[00:19:14.692 --> 00:19:17.394]  Oh, here's some.
[00:19:17.655 --> 00:19:18.155]  There we go.
[00:19:21.318 --> 00:19:22.359]  Is this from, this is live?
[00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:24.822]  Or is this from earlier?
[00:19:24.842 --> 00:19:25.862]  This is from later, I think.
[00:19:25.882 --> 00:19:26.082]  Okay.
[00:19:26.142 --> 00:19:26.943]  Yeah, from earlier.
[00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:33.646]  Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think they would have Trump just out walking around if this was what was going on.
[00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:37.287]  But yeah, I mean, these are the people who they want to take America back?
[00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:41.929]  I don't know, make America something really bad that no one wants?
[00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.030]  Right.
[00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.032]  Do they think that they're going to take down the leadership in this country and that they're going to be in powder?
[00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.292]  Because I don't want those people in powder.
[00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.173]  These people that I'm seeing here, these are just troublemakers.
[00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:50.873]  Yeah.
[00:19:50.913 --> 00:19:56.575]  The ones with the signs, the one with the, what is it, against fascism.
[00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.836]  It's the Workers, World Workers Party.
[00:19:58.896 --> 00:19:59.416]  Antifa.
[00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:00.656]  It's a socialist demonstration.
[00:20:00.797 --> 00:20:01.097]  Right.
[00:20:01.177 --> 00:20:02.297]  And those are the real socialists.
[00:20:02.337 --> 00:20:04.578]  Like, really, really, they want big socialism.
[00:20:04.818 --> 00:20:08.259]  And I've looked at all their demands, I've looked at all of the lists, you know, it's like... What do they want, Alex?
[00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:17.742]  Don't touch the Affordable Care Act, free college, I mean actually a lot of it's Bernie Sanders platform.
[00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:24.944]  Obviously you can't, I mean it's really, if anything that I see in all of these lists of things, there's no giving.
[00:20:24.984 --> 00:20:26.504]  It's all I want, I want, we want this.
[00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:28.145]  There's no plan for how to pay for it.
[00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:36.549]  There's no giving, like make facilities so people can help others and do other things and really work together.
[00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:39.231]  Now this is only about... Pay for my college education.
[00:20:39.611 --> 00:20:41.792]  So those protesters, they're just troublemakers.
[00:20:42.933 --> 00:20:44.414]  You can get that in any situation.
[00:20:44.954 --> 00:20:49.476]  And what I'm seeing is the key word is the resistance.
[00:20:50.377 --> 00:20:51.597]  This is really being used.
[00:20:51.838 --> 00:20:53.378]  Keith Olbermann is the resistance now.
[00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:54.499]  Keith Olbermann now has said...
[00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:56.259]  This is the resistance.
[00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:56.520]  Yeah.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.740]  Like he's kind of co-opting.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.160]  Let's resist.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:09.163]  But I've seen people say, you know, protesting Trump is kind of like the French resistance against the Nazis, which is way over the top as a comparison.
[00:21:09.523 --> 00:21:11.984]  But you watch for this word resistance, all in the resistance.
[00:21:12.624 --> 00:21:16.025]  And I've seen all of the initiatives, everything that everyone's going to do.
[00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:18.546]  I don't see any goals.
[00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:21.409]  Only I see is like, we're just gonna, you know, we're gonna fight it.
[00:21:21.469 --> 00:21:22.931]  We're gonna not let them do it.
[00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:25.314]  It's like, well, there are tools in our system.
[00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:27.377]  We have representatives.
[00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:32.924]  We have, you know, you can go through, you can petition your government.
[00:21:32.964 --> 00:21:33.385]  You can lobby.
[00:21:33.405 --> 00:21:34.626]  There's a million things you can do.
[00:21:34.866 --> 00:21:36.849]  Just standing, jumping up and down, that doesn't do it.
[00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:50.313]  Well, if they really truly want to change, then that means they wouldn't be able to continue collecting all of these donations and funds from everyone, because these are actually the exact same protest groups that were out at George W. Bush's inauguration as well.
[00:21:50.353 --> 00:21:51.913]  The same signs, the same protests.
[00:21:51.933 --> 00:21:52.893]  You make an excellent point.
[00:21:52.913 --> 00:21:56.634]  This has been an amazing fundraising drive for women's groups and organizations.
[00:21:56.654 --> 00:21:58.475]  We have just been hammering with
[00:21:59.155 --> 00:22:06.041]  The fake news that Trump's going to take us back 300 years with the LGBT civil rights movements.
[00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:13.927]  They would be mad at the DNC and Hillary Clinton because she stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders.
[00:22:14.728 --> 00:22:19.272]  You would think that the anger would be channeled inward instead of outward because they were robbed.
[00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:21.333]  I hate to tell you.
[00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:24.333]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the little bone that they threw.
[00:22:24.413 --> 00:22:25.134]  The culprit, right!
[00:22:25.154 --> 00:22:25.974]  I will fire her.
[00:22:26.134 --> 00:22:28.635]  So many corrupt entities within the DNC.
[00:22:28.675 --> 00:22:37.217]  It looks like you would channel all that anger if you really cared about changing the process and making sure that you had fair and accurate representation.
[00:22:37.237 --> 00:22:43.739]  You would do something about that instead of burning down a city and protesting somebody you keep calling a Nazi.
[00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:48.542]  Yeah, we want to stop fascism so we are going to pummel your face.
[00:22:49.002 --> 00:22:52.685]  No, I mean, already cemented... One can hope, Adam!
[00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.767]  Cemented in everybody's mind already is Putin.
[00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:56.788]  Putin!
[00:22:56.888 --> 00:22:58.089]  Russia did it.
[00:22:58.109 --> 00:22:59.490]  Russia influenced the election.
[00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:06.115]  I heard Maxine Waters say if we find out that Trump was responsible for coming up with the term
[00:23:06.175 --> 00:23:12.278]  You know, Crooked Hillary, that she was ill and not feeling well, and then, you know, that's grounds for impeachment.
[00:23:12.318 --> 00:23:19.683]  Which, it's not, but it's just, that's how insane... It's like, have you ever watched the campaign process before, and how dirty these people get?
[00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:31.309]  And, the fact is, Crooked Hillary, she coined that own phrase for herself by being crooked, and we saw her collapse face first at the 9-11 memorial, and have those hacking fits.
[00:23:31.429 --> 00:23:32.530]  I mean, she's ill!
[00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.351]  No one made up conspiracy!
[00:23:34.411 --> 00:23:38.515]  So what do you expect in the first 100 days from the new president?
[00:23:38.535 --> 00:23:39.296]  Well, we're excited.
[00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:44.862]  I mean, today it was pointed out that he's already doing a special executive order to make sure that Mattis can be confirmed.
[00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:46.483]  We know that there's a promise.
[00:23:46.503 --> 00:23:47.364]  A formality.
[00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:50.788]  And I want to go back to this Russian thing, and we'll get to that, because this is really bothering.
[00:23:50.808 --> 00:23:53.831]  As somebody who lived and worked in Russia, it's so bizarre.
[00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:54.652]  You lived and worked in Russia?
[00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:56.273]  I worked for RTU.
[00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:57.013]  I did.
[00:23:57.033 --> 00:23:57.754]  She's a Russian agent.
[00:23:57.774 --> 00:24:01.817]  And I am a Russian agent, and that's exactly why Alex hired me.
[00:24:02.017 --> 00:24:07.080]  Only because, exactly, I have an inside tunnel to the Kremlin, where I used to live.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.021]  How long were you there?
[00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:10.322]  About almost a year.
[00:24:10.842 --> 00:24:14.245]  And it was just really, it's so bizarre and so baffling to me.
[00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.906]  And obviously, Russia hacks.
[00:24:17.066 --> 00:24:17.727]  There's no question.
[00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:18.828]  They have very good hacks.
[00:24:18.868 --> 00:24:19.308]  We hack.
[00:24:19.628 --> 00:24:20.269]  China hacks.
[00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:21.370]  Everyone hacks.
[00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.573]  We were hacking Angela Merkel's phone for two and a half years.
[00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:28.015]  We are the ultimate hackers, people.
[00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:29.577]  It's just really strange to me.
[00:24:29.657 --> 00:24:31.118]  But it's a red herring, you see.
[00:24:31.158 --> 00:24:32.019]  It's a red herring.
[00:24:32.899 --> 00:24:36.062]  What really happened is people saw what was really going on.
[00:24:36.623 --> 00:24:39.245]  And people said, oh, I want to stay away from that.
[00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:43.348]  I think that's really what would throw people in the other direction.
[00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:44.509]  But it will never be that.
[00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.051]  You go back in history.
[00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:50.434]  Just like Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, which has been proven it's not.
[00:24:50.454 --> 00:24:53.536]  It was not the signature of the chemical weapons.
[00:24:54.037 --> 00:24:54.697]  Obama knew that.
[00:24:54.717 --> 00:24:55.898]  He had it tested in the UK.
[00:24:56.198 --> 00:24:56.699]  Doesn't matter.
[00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:00.682]  Consistently, you will hear, in the mainstream of course, that happened.
[00:25:00.882 --> 00:25:03.624]  So this will be the election where the Russians did it.
[00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:11.150]  There will be no conversation about pay-for-play, no conversation about screwing Bernie Sanders over.
[00:25:12.691 --> 00:25:14.432]  You don't even hear people talk about the five
[00:25:15.353 --> 00:25:15.653]  Right.
[00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:46.173]  Are you kidding me?
[00:25:46.193 --> 00:25:51.275]  Hillary Clinton just said she'd declare war with Russia over some hacked DNC?
[00:25:51.415 --> 00:25:51.895]  What?
[00:25:51.915 --> 00:25:53.956]  Well, this goes much, much further.
[00:25:53.996 --> 00:26:02.459]  There is a 100 percent, it's almost like religion inside the State Department and inside, well, let's call them civilians in the Pentagon, which would be spies.
[00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:09.341]  They are extremely wary of Russia and always have seen Russia as the bad guys.
[00:26:10.014 --> 00:26:11.495]  Isn't that convenient, don't you think?
[00:26:11.515 --> 00:26:13.755]  We need a bad guy.
[00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:16.596]  We haven't engaged in a conflict with Russia.
[00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:18.657]  The Cold War ended, of course.
[00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:19.297]  No, that's not true.
[00:26:19.457 --> 00:26:22.298]  We have sanctions on them, which is an act of war, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:26:22.358 --> 00:26:26.820]  I agree with you on that, but I'm saying, like, specifically, an outright... there have been provocations.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.661]  Let me retract this for a moment, because I remember, even in 2014,
[00:26:31.622 --> 00:26:35.025]  There was this annexation that happened, then a provocation, and then we sanctioned.
[00:26:35.085 --> 00:26:36.747]  It's a bizarre dance we're doing.
[00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:46.196]  I'm of the belief that we personally, it's this administration, it's one rogue administration, it's not a consensus among people to be at war with Russia.
[00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:49.238]  Let me just go back, you said annexations, you're talking about Crimea.
[00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:49.658]  I am, yes.
[00:26:49.698 --> 00:26:52.660]  What we don't talk about, of course, is how Victoria Nuland went in there.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.201]  We don't.
[00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:53.961]  No, we don't, do we?
[00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:57.664]  How he placed American bankers in charge of the financials.
[00:26:57.704 --> 00:26:58.885]  Caught him on the hot mic.
[00:26:58.905 --> 00:27:02.167]  Joe Biden's son is in control of the oil there now.
[00:27:02.227 --> 00:27:03.948]  Big oil and gas companies.
[00:27:03.968 --> 00:27:07.231]  He's buying up gas assets like there is no tomorrow.
[00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:09.712]  Forget the legality issue of this for a minute.
[00:27:09.732 --> 00:27:15.797]  So you destabilize a country, you try to usher in pro-democracy, you basically arm rioters, which were the Maidan.
[00:27:16.377 --> 00:27:24.704]  Which is what's happening now in Washington, and then we have the audacity and the nerve to preach to the world about democracy when really it's about control.
[00:27:24.724 --> 00:27:25.824]  It's just about control.
[00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:36.413]  I remember this at the time, I don't mean to get off topic about Russia, but they are building this massive gas pipeline through the Ukraine to be able to, you know, sell gas to most of Europe, and it would have made them wealthier.
[00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:40.676]  And Ukraine was such a pivotal point, we couldn't have allowed that to happen.
[00:27:40.736 --> 00:27:42.718]  We needed to usher in democracy.
[00:27:43.058 --> 00:27:43.198]  No.
[00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:45.579]  Well, thank you for pointing out the obvious.
[00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:49.261]  This is always about resources, so gas in this case.
[00:27:49.281 --> 00:27:51.502]  It's not about democracy, folks.
[00:27:51.562 --> 00:27:52.102]  No, no.
[00:27:52.122 --> 00:27:52.762]  That's a code word.
[00:27:52.782 --> 00:27:55.043]  The European Union is the customer.
[00:27:55.364 --> 00:27:55.664]  Right.
[00:27:55.944 --> 00:27:56.964]  Russia is providing.
[00:27:56.984 --> 00:28:00.126]  They have a direct pipeline through the north into Germany.
[00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:00.986]  And Ukraine is bankrupt.
[00:28:01.026 --> 00:28:03.787]  They owe Russia a lot of money.
[00:28:03.827 --> 00:28:04.908]  They weren't paying.
[00:28:05.008 --> 00:28:07.189]  They weren't paying for the gas, so Russia shut it off.
[00:28:07.449 --> 00:28:08.730]  Now, here's what we need to look at.
[00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.532]  This is fun!
[00:28:10.632 --> 00:28:12.054]  I love having this guy here.
[00:28:12.494 --> 00:28:13.816]  Cyprus is on deck.
[00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:15.437]  And guess who was just there last week?
[00:28:15.738 --> 00:28:16.418]  Victoria Nuland.
[00:28:16.438 --> 00:28:18.781]  So, whenever she appears, be very careful.
[00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:22.805]  So, they're trying to reunify Cyprus.
[00:28:22.845 --> 00:28:27.310]  You know, the Turkish side, and there's British stuff involved.
[00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:42.199]  That would be for another pipeline, again, to push Russia off, which would come from the Leviathan Field, which was discovered a couple of years ago off the coast of Israel, through Cyprus, then we go into Greece, and then we're in Europe.
[00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:49.883]  But there's also other competing pipelines coming straight through Turkey that is not from Russia.
[00:28:50.504 --> 00:28:55.967]  They'll come from, where am I thinking, Georgia.
[00:28:58.413 --> 00:29:00.415]  Come on, you lived in Russia, you should know.
[00:29:01.015 --> 00:29:05.579]  Well, the fall of Tbilisi and making sure that that border was destabilized and then propping up.
[00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:14.145]  We could get into a two-hour discussion over why we care about having hostilities with Russia and it has everything to do with money and nothing to do with democracy.
[00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:17.768]  Honestly, we should do a segment over specifically Russian politics.
[00:29:17.788 --> 00:29:20.110]  We could debunk some of these myths for people, actually.
[00:29:22.772 --> 00:29:23.853]  We are in the same game.
[00:29:24.213 --> 00:29:25.153]  We fight all the time.
[00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:27.994]  Syria is ultimately about pipelines.
[00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:33.777]  One coming from Qatar, financed by the Saudis, one to go straight up to Turkey.
[00:29:33.817 --> 00:29:34.998]  Are you okay?
[00:29:36.138 --> 00:29:37.199]  Yes, I'm fine.
[00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:39.279]  Iran, Iraq, Syria, of course.
[00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:41.080]  That's what Assad chose.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.681]  He said, that's alright, I've got my own pipeline.
[00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:43.141]  Yeah.
[00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:43.982]  And that's what it's about.
[00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:50.705]  And our Pentagon, or our State Department and Pentagon, have been abused as resource extraction units.
[00:29:50.825 --> 00:30:10.395]  And how wonderful that they can lie to all of us and tell us that it's about this or that, or that we've been able to catch them recreating the fake news with the BBC and saying that there's certain, you know, this gas was deployed on these people and then they reuse the footage, but the lady has a mask over her mouth so they're able to dub her saying something different.
[00:30:11.616 --> 00:30:12.297]  Ten years.
[00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:24.524]  My co-host on the No Agenda Show, John C. Dvorak, he, you know, we got to the pipelines maybe five, six years ago, and now you cannot view politics any other way.
[00:30:24.624 --> 00:30:25.665]  It's all about this.
[00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:25.945]  Money.
[00:30:25.985 --> 00:30:26.726]  It's about money.
[00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:27.306]  It's about the game.
[00:30:27.727 --> 00:30:31.269]  We have got to get, you had me every step of the way.
[00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:32.349]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.031]  I've got Joe in the ear.
[00:30:34.071 --> 00:30:36.992]  We've got to catch a break and continue this in a moment.
[00:30:37.935 --> 00:30:38.135]  No?
[00:30:38.696 --> 00:30:41.538]  Okay, well we will be back on the flip side.
[00:30:41.678 --> 00:30:55.832]  But yeah, so when we get back, I definitely want to talk a little bit about how we've got the Directors Guild of America threatening anyone there, saying, look, if you guys do anything with Trump or his inauguration, or make him look good, you're out, you're a Nazi sympathizer.
[00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:56.672]  DGA is saying?
[00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:59.054]  They're getting this, they're getting this.
[00:30:59.395 --> 00:31:01.337]  So we're going to talk about this in a little bit.
[00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:04.639]  Yeah, and then just all this street art that's coming out.
[00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:20.430]  So it's interesting because this is in stark contrast to the way that the media and Hollywood was totally sycophantic over Obama all these years and how they were colluding directly with the Obama administration, even getting his talking points in the TV shows that we were being given.
[00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.812]  So we're going to talk about all that on the flip side.
[00:31:22.852 --> 00:31:25.014]  We'll see you guys here in just a minute right after this.
[00:31:25.414 --> 00:31:28.356]  We will make America great again!
[00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:37.919]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.941]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:31:40.802 --> 00:31:42.725]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:31:43.305 --> 00:31:48.812]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:31:49.432 --> 00:31:50.073]  Of course!
[00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:09.685]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:17.689]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family, and a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:32:17.889 --> 00:32:18.669]  You cannot lose.
[00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:19.810]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:26.834]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:32:27.194 --> 00:32:31.136]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:32:31.756 --> 00:32:33.217]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:52.614]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:33:53.427 --> 00:33:55.248]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:33:55.268 --> 00:33:55.588]  Exactly.
[00:33:55.608 --> 00:33:57.388]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:33:57.428 --> 00:34:00.749]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:02.070]  We've both talked to them.
[00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:11.233]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:34:12.093 --> 00:34:13.194]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:14.514]  We refuse to do that.
[00:34:14.894 --> 00:34:16.855]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:24.146]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:34:24.567 --> 00:34:25.308]  It's a win-win.
[00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:26.570]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:37.511]  There is a crisis in America today.
[00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:40.352]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[00:34:40.672 --> 00:34:48.076]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[00:34:48.476 --> 00:34:52.078]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[00:34:52.438 --> 00:34:53.578]  I have the answer for you today.
[00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:55.119]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.

[00:34:59.486 --> 00:35:01.187]  No radiation compartment.

[00:35:17.483 --> 00:35:19.284]  With a blocking pocket, this is impossible.
[00:35:19.745 --> 00:35:22.426]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:27.310]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocking pocket.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.141]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:42.103]  You are watching our 14-hour broadcast.
[00:35:42.123 --> 00:35:51.208]  We're bringing you live coverage of the inauguration and all of the festivities after Donald Trump has officially been sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
[00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:59.973]  And when we were listening to, coming in from the break, we were hearing Donald Trump, the infamous, we will make America great again.
[00:36:00.474 --> 00:36:03.996]  What did you guys think about the speech that he delivered this afternoon?
[00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:05.877]  And of course, the part I loved so much
[00:36:06.637 --> 00:36:12.940]  Um, was that today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.541]  We're transferring power from Washington D.C.
[00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:17.502]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:36:18.322 --> 00:36:18.862]  True or false?
[00:36:19.382 --> 00:36:19.863]  What do you think?
[00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:22.564]  Well, that's what everybody voted for.
[00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:25.825]  People who voted for Trump, I think that's what they're expecting.
[00:36:25.845 --> 00:36:28.786]  And I, I think people will hold his feet to the fire.
[00:36:28.826 --> 00:36:31.607]  It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
[00:36:33.468 --> 00:36:48.486]  I love seeing mainstream complain about the speech, like, oh my, this is radical, this is going to go down in history, it's a crazy radical, because there was no, you know, it really wasn't the mountaintop, you know, dawn, new dawn in America, it was very pragmatic.
[00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:49.766]  He's quoting scripture!
[00:36:49.786 --> 00:36:51.767]  This is how we're going to get the job done.
[00:36:51.927 --> 00:36:52.427]  Correct!
[00:36:52.447 --> 00:36:59.590]  I mean, that's a controversial thing to do if you're talking to, you know, he wasn't, it was pretty brazen, if you will.
[00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:06.112]  I mean, he's literally quoting scripture and he was talking about destiny, manifest destiny, the birthright of America, and he really taps in.
[00:37:06.492 --> 00:37:15.795]  And then, interestingly enough, he had one of the foremost evangelical pastors, Paula White, in the whole country, who has really been, you know, pushed off to a side and, you
[00:37:16.015 --> 00:37:19.898]  You know, very demonized for being fanatical, if you will, by the left.
[00:37:20.298 --> 00:37:22.460]  She's the one who gave the benediction, along with Ford.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.002]  I mean, that's, you know, he doesn't seem to care if he's considered to be radical.
[00:37:26.262 --> 00:37:28.264]  That was a really powerful message that he sent.
[00:37:28.284 --> 00:37:29.264]  And he gave that pause.
[00:37:29.284 --> 00:37:29.985]  Mm-hmm.
[00:37:30.245 --> 00:37:31.066]  Under God.
[00:37:31.246 --> 00:37:31.886]  That's right.
[00:37:31.926 --> 00:37:32.146]  Yes.
[00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:32.967]  Yeah, that was nice.
[00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:37.310]  Well, you know, the media in the United States likes to think that they really choose the President.
[00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:37.530]  Their God.
[00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:38.691]  Oh, they choose the President.
[00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:38.931]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:38.991 --> 00:37:39.672]  Well, is there a difference?
[00:37:42.013 --> 00:37:45.414]  We've seen this over and over again where you have, you know, Howard Dean.
[00:37:45.635 --> 00:37:46.795]  Weird scream, you're out.
[00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:49.916]  You know, you got Dukakis, nutty helmet in the tank.
[00:37:50.016 --> 00:37:51.257]  Yeah, you're a loser.
[00:37:51.277 --> 00:37:51.777]  You gotta go.
[00:37:51.797 --> 00:37:52.197]  Right.
[00:37:52.517 --> 00:37:53.318]  That just didn't stick.
[00:37:53.538 --> 00:38:06.543]  Yeah, they tried so hard at every move to pin something on Donald Trump and to get everything, deflect everything from Hillary Clinton down to the point that they would lie and say that she was just fatigued or something when she collapsed.
[00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:12.904]  In front of everyone's eyes around the world, and that of course went like wildfire because someone was there.
[00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:14.225]  It wasn't the official press corps.
[00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:16.465]  It was on Twitter, just an innocent bystander.
[00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:18.706]  They were trying to even protect the people from seeing that.
[00:38:19.786 --> 00:38:25.408]  Wasn't it weird, the Paul Ryan thing, where, you know, so Paul Ryan, we understand that Downey and Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney, they're sort of like
[00:38:25.888 --> 00:38:26.869]  Tight bros.
[00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:34.594]  And the understanding was that the inside camp at the RNC, the Republicans, are the ones that actually leaked that tape.
[00:38:35.235 --> 00:38:54.008]  Roger Stone alleged that Dan Senor, who's a Republican operative close to Paul Ryan, was the one who kind of aggregated that pussy gate tape into the... So it was weird for me to see Paul Ryan, knowing the conflict and the underbelly of... He was the one who potentially tried to take out Trump, standing there next to him in a... Yeah, but that's...
[00:38:54.428 --> 00:38:55.608]  Politics!
[00:38:55.628 --> 00:38:56.369]  That's politics!
[00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:57.389]  And did you see Pelosi?
[00:38:57.409 --> 00:39:01.790]  She couldn't have been further up Trump's butt when he was signing the paper.
[00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.311]  She was right there!
[00:39:03.411 --> 00:39:16.635]  And to me, I was like, man, this is kind of in stark contrast to what he was saying, which I really thought too, you know, he was really saying, for too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost.
[00:39:16.915 --> 00:39:19.816]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[00:39:19.956 --> 00:39:22.537]  Their victories have not been your victories.
[00:39:23.797 --> 00:39:37.363]  So, all the people that he's speaking about are sitting behind him going... They're so non-self-reflective, they had no idea that he was talking about them.
[00:39:37.483 --> 00:39:38.604]  So, question for both of you.
[00:39:39.024 --> 00:39:45.227]  How do we now, instead of, because this is pretty divisive still, what you just said, how do we
[00:39:46.187 --> 00:39:50.091]  How do we connect with the other half of the world?
[00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:51.273]  It's not just the United States.
[00:39:51.413 --> 00:39:52.894]  Europe is insane.
[00:39:52.914 --> 00:39:56.739]  I have friends, I grew up in the Netherlands, I have friends there.
[00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:00.963]  They really believe, you know, this is it.
[00:40:01.143 --> 00:40:03.105]  The Third Reich has risen again.
[00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:04.895]  So what can we do?
[00:40:04.915 --> 00:40:08.618]  Because if we just perpetuate it, I don't think it's going to help anything.
[00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:19.949]  Well, I think it's also very interesting, this isn't a solution right here, but just to kind of add to that point, I've got a friend in Belgium who's always calling and saying, I just saw you guys on the news here when we went and
[00:40:20.894 --> 00:40:24.676]  Had our little thing with the Young Turks and all of that, made the international news.
[00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:30.158]  But the way that the media covers it here, imagine how protected it is there.
[00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:33.699]  I mean, maybe if you go to RT or something, they might show you what's really going on in the US.
[00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:37.721]  But I mean, the BBC and all, they protect the establishment here as well.
[00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:41.923]  And so they're only getting a certain aspect of what's going on in America.
[00:40:41.943 --> 00:40:45.224]  And that's why he's always like, who are you going to vote for?
[00:40:45.264 --> 00:40:46.485]  It seems so terrible there.
[00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:47.865]  Your country is collapsing.
[00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:49.326]  And I was like, Trump?
[00:40:50.146 --> 00:40:51.207]  It's not hard at all!
[00:40:51.227 --> 00:40:52.087]  You're getting fake news!
[00:40:52.127 --> 00:40:59.892]  Maybe we have to convince people to tune in to other sources of information and make it attractive for them to tune in to other sources of information.
[00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:04.354]  Well how do they do that when they live in countries that their governments are censored?
[00:41:04.394 --> 00:41:05.995]  The internet is censored there!
[00:41:06.095 --> 00:41:06.655]  Not really.
[00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:09.056]  What countries are you talking about?
[00:41:09.176 --> 00:41:09.476]  The EU.
[00:41:09.496 --> 00:41:10.576]  It's starting.
[00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:14.438]  On Facebook, certain things will no longer be allowed.
[00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:16.218]  Heavily fined in Germany.
[00:41:16.378 --> 00:41:19.519]  You're going to get fined or kicked off or ostracized.
[00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:22.260]  Facebook will actually get fined if they do that.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.761]  They're fining the citizens as well.
[00:41:26.082 --> 00:41:33.444]  Maybe we'll start to remember and recall that the internet is not Twitter and Facebook and Google.
[00:41:33.564 --> 00:41:34.525]  Get out of these ghettos!
[00:41:50.262 --> 00:41:52.202]  They need to be more open and listen.
[00:41:52.262 --> 00:41:56.243]  I've heard a lot of things from the Democratic side which are not unreasonable.
[00:41:57.564 --> 00:42:08.606]  But if we continue to bicker... Well, that's the thing with this phantom left-right divide that we need to start realizing that we have a lot more in common than we think.
[00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:14.687]  That's why with Bernie Sanders, everything he was saying, we're like, I understand why you support him.
[00:42:14.807 --> 00:42:18.268]  We agree with that as well, but the solutions he's providing is saying,
[00:42:18.988 --> 00:42:24.351]  Let's give even more power to this current corrupt government and just hope that they do right by us this time.
[00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:26.351]  And so that's what's not going to work.
[00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:30.854]  So we definitely need to start looking at, you know, what it is that is the same.
[00:42:31.214 --> 00:42:33.935]  Just like, you know, Trump said in his speech today, we all bleed red.
[00:42:34.915 --> 00:42:39.998]  So, yeah, I think that that's that's a message that we need to break through is just how similar we are.
[00:42:40.498 --> 00:42:47.180]  There's a misconception that Germany has a free press, and they're spending time in parts of Western India.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.761]  I love doing Man on the Streets.
[00:42:48.781 --> 00:42:52.502]  Because you can edit it together to make it look any way you want.
[00:42:52.542 --> 00:43:06.646]  You can ask people what they really think, and in Germany specifically, if you ask people what they think about Merkel, they seem to be so afraid to discredit her, to talk about her in any way, even when the disgust was on their face.
[00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:08.527]  I mean, people on the street or media?
[00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:10.608]  Just in everyday, no, everyday people.
[00:43:10.628 --> 00:43:12.389]  I think that's changing.
[00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:25.775]  I don't, I mean, it's not something, and I love watching men on the streets, even when they're trans, you see people with this, and it's like, why is there this, there seems to be an oppression about, and you ask about the immigration policy, and do you think that this is fair?
[00:43:25.815 --> 00:43:26.696]  Do you think this is right?
[00:43:26.736 --> 00:43:27.336]  How do you feel?
[00:43:27.356 --> 00:43:30.418]  And it's like, I don't, I don't, when clearly you have an opinion.
[00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:31.678]  Right.
[00:43:31.698 --> 00:43:33.219]  Because that is worse than death.
[00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:37.101]  It doesn't even have to be censored, as long as there's a fear of saying something that's wrong.
[00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:51.348]  Well, it's totally cultural, and in Germany, I've been there a lot, I know a lot of people there, I think up until maybe the beginning of the year, there was still this general idea, we're Germans, we're doing a good thing here, we're helping out people.
[00:43:51.508 --> 00:43:52.228]  A lot of guilt.
[00:43:52.308 --> 00:43:53.088]  And you don't want to be...
[00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:55.389]  Historically, in a way.
[00:43:55.429 --> 00:43:55.649]  Right.
[00:43:55.849 --> 00:44:14.134]  It's just like here we have white guilt for a long time and, you know, they don't all harbor that, you know... Well, it's just like all white Americans here do not harbor the guilt of slavery, even though we can all look around and say, yes, that was absolutely wrong, but I don't personally feel responsible for it, so why are we having this white guilt, white privilege shoved on our throat?
[00:44:14.574 --> 00:44:20.055]  Whereas, you know, I mean, this was, you know, within a hundred years, so it's not even that
[00:44:21.209 --> 00:44:24.432]  Far off in history, those people are still alive, you know?
[00:44:25.152 --> 00:44:28.915]  So, of course, it's a little... They lived through the remnants of World War II.
[00:44:29.155 --> 00:44:30.776]  There are some people that are still living in society.
[00:44:31.417 --> 00:44:35.380]  I have a total... We've got to get... There's so many points that you've made.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.102]  I mean, wait a second, let's go back and revisit this, slowly.
[00:44:38.122 --> 00:44:40.344]  I'll tell you something else that happened.
[00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:44.687]  Something else that happens in... We've got Alex.
[00:44:45.468 --> 00:44:45.928]  Oh, great.
[00:44:46.028 --> 00:44:46.329]  Oh, good.
[00:44:46.709 --> 00:44:47.449]  Oh, okay.
[00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:48.931]  He's on the Face Bag Live!
[00:44:51.528 --> 00:44:53.629]  Uh, there he is.
[00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:59.571]  So all you that tried to ally yourselves with the whole world against freedom, the whole world wants freedom.
[00:44:59.891 --> 00:45:01.071]  They don't want your global tyranny.
[00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:06.333]  It's like six years ago, they were going to pass the carbon tax and they leaked the UN treaty.
[00:45:07.053 --> 00:45:11.655]  And the UN treaty said that they were going to double tax the third world.
[00:45:12.715 --> 00:45:14.256]  They promised the third world was free crap.
[00:45:14.276 --> 00:45:15.276]  Well, you know what?
[00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:17.357]  The third world got the document was to screw them over.
[00:45:18.516 --> 00:45:23.098]  All this wealth redistribution is pushed by a bunch of billionaires and people that don't want you to be wealthy.
[00:45:23.278 --> 00:45:25.539]  They want you so poor, their money... See, let's play this.
[00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:28.680]  How does a globalist billionaire get even richer?
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:34.262]  They make your money worthless, they disempower you, so every dollar they've got is worth ten times that.
[00:45:35.003 --> 00:45:35.323]  You understand?
[00:45:35.603 --> 00:45:38.564]  Making you poor makes their money go up in value.
[00:45:39.204 --> 00:45:41.425]  Making you rich makes their power go down.
[00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:43.486]  We want your power to go up.
[00:45:44.398 --> 00:45:45.339]  I think I just broke it down.
[00:45:45.379 --> 00:45:46.940]  That's really what this is all about.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.401]  We want to make your power go up.
[00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:51.422]  We want you to be successful.
[00:45:51.703 --> 00:45:53.624]  Because we feel like crap when you're not successful.
[00:45:53.924 --> 00:45:55.725]  And they'll be losers and they'll never be successful.
[00:45:55.985 --> 00:45:56.826]  That's their problem.
[00:45:57.346 --> 00:45:59.307]  We're going to give everybody a real shot at this.
[00:45:59.728 --> 00:46:04.851]  And you watch, the success is going to be unprecedented because that's the promise of America.
[00:46:05.211 --> 00:46:07.693]  Doesn't mean we aren't broke back and got our own problems.
[00:46:08.073 --> 00:46:09.974]  But compared to other countries, we're the gold standard.
[00:46:10.254 --> 00:46:11.255]  And it's coming back.
[00:46:12.242 --> 00:46:13.463]  America was exceptional.
[00:46:13.703 --> 00:46:14.963]  It became exceptionally evil.
[00:46:15.343 --> 00:46:20.025]  Now it's going to become exceptional in the fact that it shines and defeats the New World Order.
[00:46:20.045 --> 00:46:21.846]  Any of you guys want to get involved?
[00:46:22.366 --> 00:46:23.647]  Here, come on over here, young lady.
[00:46:24.027 --> 00:46:25.027]  No, no, you talk to folks.
[00:46:25.507 --> 00:46:26.168]  Where are you from?
[00:46:26.968 --> 00:46:28.128]  I grew up in Long Island.
[00:46:28.308 --> 00:46:28.509]  Cool.
[00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:29.489]  What's your view on all this?
[00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:30.809]  I like Trump.
[00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:32.210]  Go Trump!
[00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:33.851]  And tell us why.
[00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:39.373]  Because, you know, he's very passionate and knows what the people need.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.642]  At a gut level with, say, female intuition, what do you pick up from Trump?
[00:46:44.862 --> 00:46:47.023]  He's for females, definitely.
[00:46:47.043 --> 00:46:56.428]  Yeah, and he has a beautiful family, and looking at Ivanka and Melania, it's really an inspiration, and he's definitely not anti-feminism.
[00:46:56.448 --> 00:46:56.809]  No, he's not.
[00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:57.769]  He's, like, worshiping women.
[00:46:57.789 --> 00:46:59.730]  He's not attacking them.
[00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.071]  Yeah, he respects women.
[00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.331]  Yeah, Trump worships women.
[00:47:04.511 --> 00:47:05.292]  He ain't attacking them.
[00:47:05.672 --> 00:47:07.473]  And they want to kill the cult of loving women.
[00:47:07.833 --> 00:47:08.574]  That's what this is all about.
[00:47:08.594 --> 00:47:09.755]  That's what it's all about.
[00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:10.275]  Come on over here.
[00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:13.057]  The globalists want control of the women because you've got the power.
[00:47:13.417 --> 00:47:14.758]  Come on over here.
[00:47:14.778 --> 00:47:15.318]  Sorry.
[00:47:15.358 --> 00:47:15.559]  Hi.
[00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:18.440]  Hi, I'm a woman from... No, loud and aggressive.
[00:47:18.621 --> 00:47:20.662]  I'm a woman from California, Democrat.
[00:47:21.322 --> 00:47:22.303]  Didn't vote for Trump.
[00:47:22.984 --> 00:47:24.905]  I came here to see what was going on.
[00:47:25.678 --> 00:47:37.685]  I came here to see the change that he's been talking about, and I hope to God that he went to church this morning, and I hope he prayed for the people, and I hope the people will pray for him.
[00:47:37.705 --> 00:47:42.888]  Let me just tell you, when I personally talk to Trump, he gets it, he talks about the spirit of America and God with me.
[00:47:43.288 --> 00:47:46.210]  The New York Times asked me what Trump talks about, I wouldn't tell them because they're the enemy.
[00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.371]  I'll tell you, Trump
[00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:53.257]  He's even told me, he said, you know, I always loved God and I loved America, but now that I feel the Spirit, do you feel it?
[00:47:53.297 --> 00:47:54.017]  We talk about the Spirit.
[00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:55.138]  I mean, you could feel it!
[00:47:55.178 --> 00:47:59.743]  How could you, how could anybody who doesn't love goodness not know the Spirit of Liberty's rising?
[00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:16.717]  I feel the spirit all the time, but I don't know who you are, but I don't, and I hope that you really do feel the spirit of everyone being good and kind and stop the war and stop the massacre.
[00:48:16.737 --> 00:48:17.518]  Well, he's trying to do that.
[00:48:18.342 --> 00:48:19.463]  He's only trying to go after the real enemies.
[00:48:20.023 --> 00:48:29.370]  Well, I think all our presidents have tried to stop the war and the madness from all the way back to Abraham Lincoln to the Black People Matter.
[00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.792]  You know, it really, I can't imagine.
[00:48:32.072 --> 00:48:39.358]  We were there yesterday and seeing that museum and seeing what has happened in the past and hopefully... The past is very important.
[00:48:39.378 --> 00:48:41.740]  We should remember, but also we shouldn't take it on like we did it.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.121]  But I totally agree with it.
[00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:44.162]  I don't think we did it.
[00:48:44.222 --> 00:48:47.084]  I think we need to move on and make it better.
[00:48:47.284 --> 00:48:47.764]  Great points.
[00:48:47.784 --> 00:48:48.485]  Ma'am, come on in here.
[00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:54.450]  Yes, I'd like to say that Donald J. Trump is a breath of fresh air.
[00:48:55.091 --> 00:49:03.938]  And for all of you men, how refreshing to have an alpha male, because this society has been demasculizing men.
[00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:06.761]  And enough with the political correctness.
[00:49:07.261 --> 00:49:12.425]  I am so tired of those intellectual, over-educated idiots
[00:49:13.226 --> 00:49:20.896]  Like, Senator Schumer today, okay, being political, it was good that we shut him up.
[00:49:21.496 --> 00:49:22.998]  So, go Trump!
[00:49:23.018 --> 00:49:26.783]  I would like to say first hand,
[00:49:29.606 --> 00:49:37.771]  I was in the midst of seeing the divide between the two parties today and it was something to see.
[00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:40.793]  I didn't see the anger that was coming from the other side.
[00:49:40.813 --> 00:49:42.294]  It was scary as a Trump supporter.
[00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:48.077]  I didn't feel like my voice could be heard without repercussions, especially being a woman.
[00:49:48.137 --> 00:49:50.739]  I'm from Grand Rapids, Michigan originally, but I live in Virginia.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.122]  And it was an experience to see today.
[00:49:56.164 --> 00:50:02.327]  And to be in the middle of it and to, I don't know, it was just a big experience and I'm so grateful I'm here.
[00:50:02.347 --> 00:50:04.348]  Were you surprised Michigan won for Trump?
[00:50:05.248 --> 00:50:06.448]  No, yes and no.
[00:50:06.769 --> 00:50:08.409]  I think people are starting to wake up now.
[00:50:08.989 --> 00:50:21.615]  I think, I definitely think people are starting to wake up and I could see it happening even when I lived there and I'm actually proud that it is happening and I was very proud of my home state.
[00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:23.201]  Yep.
[00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:24.181]  Excellent.
[00:50:24.381 --> 00:50:25.061]  Alright, anything else?
[00:50:25.402 --> 00:50:26.002]  Nope, that's it.
[00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:26.602]  Alright.
[00:50:27.482 --> 00:50:28.262]  Anybody else want to talk?
[00:50:29.462 --> 00:50:30.042]  Sure, let's do it.
[00:50:30.062 --> 00:50:31.043]  Come on over here.
[00:50:31.163 --> 00:50:32.243]  Yeah, let's get a shot.
[00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:33.623]  Alright, we're gonna get some shots here.
[00:50:33.643 --> 00:50:35.744]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:37.504 --> 00:50:38.704]  Good ol' Americana.
[00:50:39.184 --> 00:50:39.884]  Oh, smile.
[00:50:40.005 --> 00:50:41.585]  Look this way, smile.
[00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:42.945]  Say, make America great again!
[00:50:42.985 --> 00:50:44.005]  Make America great again!
[00:50:44.025 --> 00:50:44.645]  Thank you.
[00:50:44.685 --> 00:50:45.006]  Thank you.
[00:50:45.066 --> 00:50:45.746]  Alex Jones!
[00:50:46.706 --> 00:50:47.766]  Let's get buckling in here.
[00:50:47.806 --> 00:50:48.606]  My great cousin.
[00:50:50.067 --> 00:50:51.807]  This is my uncle's son.
[00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:53.113]  Go ahead.
[00:50:54.213 --> 00:50:59.075]  Well, I don't have much to say other than I'm very heartened by what I've witnessed here today.
[00:50:59.115 --> 00:51:17.820]  It seems like there's people of all colors, of all political persuasions that have come together to watch Trump basically take control over this country and to get rid of the regime that we've lived under for the last few years that has been stifling so much of the American spirit.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.021]  Right now, Trump has been on the phone.
[00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:20.741]  He's already brought
[00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:26.766]  Potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of jobs back to the United States, which is the lifeblood of our country.
[00:51:27.307 --> 00:51:39.239]  And our prosperity, our freedom is based on our prosperity because we're able to extend our way of life into the rest of the world and be a shining beacon on the hill to the rest of the world as Americans.
[00:51:39.279 --> 00:51:41.642]  And I think that that light has been diminished over the last decade.
[00:51:42.242 --> 00:51:55.531]  I think that now we have the opportunity with Trump in office to basically bring that back into focus, take us back to basics, take us back to the fundamentals of what made America great again in the first place, and focus back on that again and rebuild that from the ground up.
[00:51:55.831 --> 00:52:03.597]  And so it's been really, really fantastic for me to see so many hopeful, wonderful people wearing the red MAGA hats out here representing Trump.
[00:52:03.937 --> 00:52:07.740]  You know, it's interesting when you're in the world by and large, a lot of times you
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.542]  People demean you and they make you feel bad because you're a Trump supporter.
[00:52:12.842 --> 00:52:13.922]  They all look down on you.
[00:52:13.942 --> 00:52:15.083]  They say that you're stupid.
[00:52:15.123 --> 00:52:17.364]  They say that you're an uneducated white male.
[00:52:17.404 --> 00:52:18.885]  They discount your values.
[00:52:19.065 --> 00:52:20.125]  They call you a racist.
[00:52:20.385 --> 00:52:21.526]  They call you a homophobe.
[00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:24.607]  Anything in the book that can throw at you that might, you know, affect you.
[00:52:24.667 --> 00:52:25.067]  A Russian agent.
[00:52:25.227 --> 00:52:25.908]  A Russian agent.
[00:52:25.968 --> 00:52:30.129]  Anything in the book that they can throw at you that would... Like I'm Papa Smurf.
[00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.690]  Exactly.
[00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.510]  We'll come back to you in a minute.
[00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:32.390]  Bring this guy over.
[00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:33.671]  God bless you, brother.
[00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:34.912]  How you doing?
[00:52:34.932 --> 00:52:35.432]  Pretty good.
[00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.092]  Go ahead, take over.
[00:52:36.172 --> 00:52:36.772]  Tell us what you think.
[00:52:37.093 --> 00:52:37.593]  Oh, thank you.
[00:52:37.653 --> 00:52:38.733]  What do you want me to say?
[00:52:38.793 --> 00:52:40.794]  No, tell us why you're here, what you think of Trump.
[00:52:41.655 --> 00:52:47.197]  I'm originally from Taiwan, and right now I live in Alabama, 35 years.
[00:52:47.658 --> 00:52:54.101]  We wish you all we can get, when we go to the store, we can say we buy metal in USA.
[00:52:55.859 --> 00:52:57.080]  That's awesome.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:02.943]  But what I was talking to Mr. Jones about was the fact that you came from Taiwan.
[00:53:03.003 --> 00:53:05.044]  You gotta talk about living under tyranny versus here.
[00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:07.726]  Yeah, I come from Taiwan.
[00:53:07.786 --> 00:53:08.426]  Taiwan is a...
[00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:13.094]  It's democratic, democracy.
[00:53:14.196 --> 00:53:18.561]  Every time China tries to take over Taiwan, so we don't want it.
[00:53:18.581 --> 00:53:27.072]  We hope the U.S., United States, American can have a way to protect Taiwan, to preserve democracy.
[00:53:28.454 --> 00:53:30.576]  What do you think of Trump starting to stand up for Taiwan?
[00:53:30.616 --> 00:53:32.878]  Hold that microphone up to your mouth.
[00:53:32.938 --> 00:53:41.246]  When Trump got all that heat for saying thanks to President Tsai for congratulatory call, and everybody lost it like he had done something terrible.
[00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:45.410]  Yeah, that's why we support Trump.
[00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:50.514]  Hopefully Trump can help Taiwan to preserve Taiwan's democracy.
[00:53:52.123 --> 00:53:52.824]  God bless you, sir.
[00:53:52.864 --> 00:53:53.104]  Thank you.
[00:53:53.144 --> 00:53:53.565]  Come on over.
[00:53:53.585 --> 00:53:55.346]  You were the guy I recommended I have this fell on.
[00:53:55.727 --> 00:53:56.607]  You know, God bless you, sir.
[00:53:56.667 --> 00:53:56.928]  Thank you.
[00:53:56.948 --> 00:53:57.148]  Great.
[00:53:57.628 --> 00:53:58.349]  Come on over and talk to folks.
[00:53:58.369 --> 00:53:59.070]  Tell people how you are.
[00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:00.431]  Go talk to them.
[00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:00.851]  Go ahead.
[00:54:01.232 --> 00:54:05.516]  My name is Brad Pullum, and I'm from Athens, Alabama near Huntsville.
[00:54:06.236 --> 00:54:15.345]  And I just came up to Mr. Jones to tell him that I really appreciate, and I know a lot of people in this country who truly appreciate,
[00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:22.575]  And I don't want to be crude or crass, but I said the fact that he had the balls to do the right thing.
[00:54:23.056 --> 00:54:30.222]  To stand up and say what needed to be said, and he absolutely, just like our new president, thank God.
[00:54:31.943 --> 00:54:36.427]  You know, I mentioned when God chooses a leader, and I really mean that.
[00:54:36.447 --> 00:54:38.288]  I'm not blowing smoke for you, Alex.
[00:54:39.029 --> 00:54:42.451]  But Alex has done what God called him to do.
[00:54:42.551 --> 00:54:43.933]  I have no question about it.
[00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:45.534]  My dad's been a pastor all my life.
[00:54:46.204 --> 00:54:53.107]  But I know that this whole thing has been ordained and we have a job to do.
[00:54:53.187 --> 00:54:53.728]  Absolutely.
[00:54:54.128 --> 00:54:55.368]  And I'm not going to try to preach here.
[00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:58.790]  I'm saying absolutely true.
[00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:59.710]  Yes, you can.
[00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:02.772]  You're supposed to try the spirits and see if they be of God.
[00:55:03.012 --> 00:55:03.912]  And this is.
[00:55:04.312 --> 00:55:06.473]  And you know, is Trump, is he perfect?
[00:55:06.794 --> 00:55:07.314]  If he is,
[00:55:08.246 --> 00:55:10.388]  He'll be the first man, except for Jesus Christ.
[00:55:10.828 --> 00:55:12.489]  But he loves justice.
[00:55:12.869 --> 00:55:13.310]  That's right.
[00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:14.571]  He loves justice.
[00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:18.553]  And the beauty of the thing is that he's not a politician.
[00:55:19.314 --> 00:55:23.157]  He's not a guy who needed to bow down to the man.
[00:55:23.297 --> 00:55:26.399]  I am really happy that we had the balls to do that as well.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.902]  We're like, what words are you going to say?
[00:55:29.962 --> 00:55:30.482]  Uh-oh.
[00:55:30.502 --> 00:55:31.463]  How crass is he going?
[00:55:33.004 --> 00:55:34.305]  Balls had two syllables.
[00:55:34.345 --> 00:55:35.405]  That was very terrific.
[00:55:35.445 --> 00:55:35.966]  Balls.
[00:55:37.887 --> 00:55:38.728]  I love what I was saying.
[00:55:38.788 --> 00:55:39.929]  Our mics weren't open.
[00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:43.992]  That lady with the hat was talking about the emasculation of men.
[00:55:44.272 --> 00:55:45.413]  You didn't know which way she was going.
[00:55:45.433 --> 00:55:47.074]  She turned around, looked at all you men.
[00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:48.115]  It was you men!
[00:55:48.175 --> 00:55:51.978]  You know, this has been going on for quite a while and it's been very disturbing.
[00:55:52.179 --> 00:56:03.227]  And it's not just white, straight men, which of course are the enemy and the losers of the day, but making certainly American men, I'd say most men, look weak and dumb.
[00:56:04.088 --> 00:56:04.828]  And stupid.
[00:56:04.848 --> 00:56:07.869]  Uh, oh honey, I got the wrong dishwashing detergent.
[00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:08.890]  I'll go back to the store.
[00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:09.570]  These are the commercials.
[00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:13.391]  And then it cuts to the woman and she's like, I gotta do everything myself.
[00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:15.832]  You know, um, I've been around long enough.
[00:56:15.932 --> 00:56:19.453]  I don't care that much, but it's truly insulting.
[00:56:19.713 --> 00:56:20.013]  Yeah.
[00:56:20.073 --> 00:56:26.215]  I mean, one time as a joke, of course, but you know, it's, it's, and it's an ongoing meme.
[00:56:26.255 --> 00:56:30.076]  It just continues this demasculation of, uh, of male.
[00:56:30.256 --> 00:56:38.201]  Yeah, and now that it's been pointed out and people are actually fighting back against it, they still use this trope in commercials and it's offensive to me.
[00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:40.922]  It's like, how stupid do you think we are?
[00:56:41.103 --> 00:56:42.644]  How do you fight back against it?
[00:56:42.884 --> 00:56:52.449]  Yeah, well I guess you're typical people who are aware that it's trying to break down the family and emasculate the males and say that women are the future, the only ones that matter.
[00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:54.851]  We will annihilate the male race!
[00:56:56.392 --> 00:56:56.732]  Gender.
[00:57:00.032 --> 00:57:01.313]  I don't have a television.
[00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:04.495]  I've got to get a point of perspective.
[00:57:04.555 --> 00:57:06.336]  I haven't seen a commercial in a very long time.
[00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.636]  Yeah, well I don't have a TV either.
[00:57:07.716 --> 00:57:11.058]  So when I do, it's like something like either before a movie or something like that.
[00:57:11.298 --> 00:57:14.780]  But this is what Hollywood is trying to tell us, that men suck and women are great.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:22.784]  Speaking of Hollywood, Leanne has this fantastic article that we've been trying to get to for an hour about the Hollywood elites and how they are pissed.
[00:57:22.944 --> 00:57:23.625]  Is that a good word?
[00:57:23.645 --> 00:57:26.186]  Oh gosh, they're all so pissed.
[00:57:26.246 --> 00:57:27.347]  Oh you've got it, so yes.
[00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:34.821]  So apparently, several Directors Guild of America members forwarded an email to whoever this reporter is.
[00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:36.044]  There's a letter that went out.
[00:57:36.645 --> 00:57:38.248]  I think it's on the flip side here.
[00:57:39.205 --> 00:57:39.765]  I can read this?
[00:57:40.065 --> 00:57:40.565]  You can read it!
[00:57:40.625 --> 00:57:42.626]  You got it!
[00:57:43.266 --> 00:57:59.410]  It went out to a number of the Directors Guild of America members and in the email, I wish we had the email itself, but the email says, Trump is the monster we all fear, not an overstatement, he's about to destroy this country again, instead of our country, this country, don't do something about it.
[00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:07.612]  Here's the threat, there's no need of naming names when the inaugural credits will tell us enough about the people who truly care about this country and who don't share the same ideas.
[00:58:07.852 --> 00:58:12.633]  So it's kind of like, if you do something, this is what Hollywood has been.
[00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:17.274]  You're siding with Nazi scum, if you do anything to put him in a positive light.
[00:58:17.634 --> 00:58:23.676]  Now we got Shia LaBeouf, who I actually really used to like him, but he's become so douchey.
[00:58:24.076 --> 00:58:29.177]  So now he's launching this four year live stream to protest President Trump, so this is going to be
[00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:32.562]  Some art that we don't understand.
[00:58:32.582 --> 00:58:35.447]  Are you familiar with the term moral self-licensing?
[00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.491]  You can look it up.
[00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:40.992]  Hundreds of studies have been done on moral self-licensing.
[00:58:41.452 --> 00:58:50.917]  When you do something that you perceive as good, which really is not that much, it doesn't have that much of an impact, Ice Bucket Challenge is one of them.
[00:58:51.157 --> 00:58:54.979]  Changing your avatar, your icon on Twitter or on Facebook.
[00:58:55.639 --> 00:58:59.801]  These are things that fall into moral self-licensing.
[00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:03.583]  So when you do that, you feel so good about yourself and have done something.
[00:59:03.703 --> 00:59:04.764]  Yeah, I'm making a difference.
[00:59:04.804 --> 00:59:14.813]  And when it's all in this virtual world where you're at home and no one can really see you, and you of course are making absolutely zero difference, this is what I think Shiloh Booth is doing.
[00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:17.495]  Say it again, Moral... Moral Self-Licensing.
[00:59:17.515 --> 00:59:19.997]  So Moral Self-Licensing should be the name of this project.
[00:59:20.037 --> 00:59:23.620]  Basically what it is, it's just this wall with a camera attached to it.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:28.465]  It'll be live streaming for the next four years and people walk by it and they look into the camera
[00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:30.485]  He will not divide us.
[00:59:30.665 --> 00:59:35.726]  So they're just going to keep this message of resistance going via this live stream art project.
[00:59:35.806 --> 00:59:42.288]  And like you said, doing absolutely nothing, making zero difference other than telling yourself alternate reality.
[00:59:42.388 --> 00:59:44.148]  He's not standing with it, he just wrote it on the wall.
[00:59:44.168 --> 00:59:54.890]  Yeah, it's here against the wall and you look into the camera and then so people can log into this live stream 24-7 and whoever wants to go stand in front of it.
[00:59:56.776 --> 01:00:00.759]  So, you know, I like that term because you're right.
[01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.201]  This is just that.
[01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:06.504]  It's just like switching the colors on your avatar on your social media.
[01:00:06.544 --> 01:00:08.606]  You're doing absolutely nothing to make a difference in the world.
[01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:13.229]  You're just deluding yourself, thinking that truly you are going to stop.
[01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:17.391]  The President-elect, who is now the President, from becoming the 45th President!
[01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:34.295]  I would like to appeal to people I know who are on social media, and instead of what I keep seeing you write and post, saying, well, we're just going to turn it all off for four years, not going to listen, may not even last four years, I don't want to know, just close my eyes.
[01:00:34.655 --> 01:00:39.936]  Please consider, if you have a different opinion, to actually bring that through channels that make a lot of sense.
[01:00:40.196 --> 01:00:42.137]  And if that's just righting yourself, that's fine too.
[01:00:42.177 --> 01:00:46.961]  But I don't like the idea of fellow citizens saying, I'm just not going to look at you.
[01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:49.703]  It's childish and disappointing.
[01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:50.323]  Absolutely.
[01:00:50.343 --> 01:00:51.284]  And we've got to open up.
[01:00:51.304 --> 01:00:55.087]  So we'll be continuing this conversation on the other side right after this message.
[01:00:56.866 --> 01:00:58.868]  America great again!
[01:00:58.928 --> 01:01:00.229]  Great again!
[01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.929]  Great again!
[01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:19.644]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:26.990]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:34.696]  We now have George Soros as a goblin on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[01:01:35.036 --> 01:01:36.798]  No Soros, him as a goblin.
[01:01:37.558 --> 01:01:41.921]  It says Deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[01:01:44.163 --> 01:01:51.248]  So it is a limited edition Deport Soros on the back, Hillary for President on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:52.148]  It's powerful.
[01:01:52.169 --> 01:01:53.249]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:55.291]  InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:02:01.848 --> 01:02:03.268]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:50.719]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:56.503]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:02:56.603 --> 01:02:57.864]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:12.918]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:03:13.538 --> 01:03:19.079]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:27.661]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:03:27.681 --> 01:03:30.142]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:03:30.422 --> 01:03:31.622]  This is the best system out there.
[01:03:31.902 --> 01:03:34.642]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:03:34.902 --> 01:03:35.643]  This is how it works.
[01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:36.463]  You order.

[01:03:40.424 --> 01:03:43.586]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.

[01:03:48.148 --> 01:03:48.929]  You cannot lose.
[01:03:48.969 --> 01:03:50.049]  You're funding the Infowar.

[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.563]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:38.407]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[01:04:38.807 --> 01:04:40.849]  That I will faithfully execute.
[01:04:41.489 --> 01:04:43.671]  That I will faithfully execute.
[01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:46.574]  The office of President of the United States.
[01:04:46.954 --> 01:04:49.895]  The office of President of the United States.

[01:04:57.818 --> 01:04:59.639]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[01:04:59.899 --> 01:05:01.920]  The Constitution of the United States.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.401]  The Constitution of the United States.
[01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:05.381]  So help me God.
[01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:06.461]  So help me God.
[01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:08.222]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[01:06:16.661 --> 01:06:27.035]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[01:06:53.194 --> 01:07:07.750]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:27.194]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[01:07:29.316 --> 01:07:36.059]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:40.312]  We will face challenges.
[01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:42.595]  We will confront hardships.
[01:07:43.216 --> 01:07:45.260]  But we will get the job done.
[01:07:46.702 --> 01:07:52.912]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[01:07:54.051 --> 01:08:04.783]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[01:08:05.464 --> 01:08:07.747]  They have been magnificent.
[01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:08.448]  Thank you.
[01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:20.291]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[01:08:21.192 --> 01:08:29.599]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:38.047]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:47.887]  And there you have it, folks.
[01:08:47.907 --> 01:08:53.350]  That was Donald Trump giving his speech at the inauguration today, 45th President of the United States.
[01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.290]  And you are watching InfoWars.
[01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.671]  This is our 14-hour live coverage.
[01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:02.133]  And we are going to be here with you for about another hour, Margaret and Adam Curry.
[01:09:04.614 --> 01:09:09.818]  We're going to have some of our crew is actually going to be going out to the protests here taking place in Austin, Texas.
[01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.280]  The Disrupt J20 crowd is going to be there.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.842]  I know they're going to be doing a women's march this weekend as well.
[01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:16.784]  So this isn't over yet, folks!
[01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.525]  You know what I love about the protesters?
[01:09:18.966 --> 01:09:24.170]  Of course, you know, they're protesting capitalism with their iPhones and cappuccinos from Starbucks, you know.
[01:09:25.151 --> 01:09:27.253]  And also, they're asking for funds.
[01:09:27.553 --> 01:09:28.353]  Help us get there!
[01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:31.436]  So they're asking for capitalism to help them fight capitalism.
[01:09:31.516 --> 01:09:40.994]  Well, I have to say, I'm very, very happy that we are not actually occupied by a foreign force, because if this is the resistance, then we'd be in deep trouble.
[01:09:41.054 --> 01:09:41.615]  We're screwed!
[01:09:41.696 --> 01:09:42.297]  Very deep trouble.
[01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:47.718]  Well, I know that Millie Weaver has tweeted out, they're all there in the parade.
[01:09:48.459 --> 01:09:52.321]  Americans have been booing the mainstream media trucks that are in this inaugural parade.
[01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:55.583]  They're shouting, fake news, fake news, as they ride by.
[01:09:55.603 --> 01:10:01.106]  The crowd is also booing Chuck Schumer, chanting, drain the swamp, drain the swamp.
[01:10:01.126 --> 01:10:07.329]  So these people that are there, they're so used to being in power and adored and kiss my ring.
[01:10:07.349 --> 01:10:11.172]  Can you imagine how this would be if Hillary Clinton, this was her parade?
[01:10:11.992 --> 01:10:14.294]  Remember how they had her in that glowing white suit?
[01:10:14.454 --> 01:10:16.816]  I don't really want to go there, Leigh-Anne.
[01:10:16.996 --> 01:10:18.857]  So traumatizing.
[01:10:19.058 --> 01:10:20.839]  Can you imagine if this was totally different?
[01:10:20.859 --> 01:10:21.560]  No, I cannot.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.042]  We would be the people moving to Canada.
[01:10:24.542 --> 01:10:26.063]  No, I cannot, frankly.
[01:10:26.203 --> 01:10:27.064]  Well, not Canada.
[01:10:27.164 --> 01:10:28.085]  It's too cold there.
[01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:29.526]  Maybe go back to Kentucky.
[01:10:32.807 --> 01:10:33.807]  It's his own country there.
[01:10:33.827 --> 01:10:34.607]  Exactly!
[01:10:34.627 --> 01:10:46.249]  I mean, we really, the past three months alone, we put our heart and souls into making sure every day, day in and day out, report after report, that she did not become president.
[01:10:46.269 --> 01:10:46.509]  Yes.
[01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:47.970]  I don't even want to think about that.
[01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.290]  I know.
[01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:59.912]  I know, but it's still, I just, I mean, the speech that he gave today, with only really referring to himself three times, mostly it was about our country, we the people, you, this is your win, we're going to make America great again for you.
[01:11:00.772 --> 01:11:18.662]  If Hillary Clinton had been, it would have been all about me, I'm the first woman, I broke through the glass ceiling, this is so, and it would have just been very like more social programming rather than, hey, you know what, let's work together, let's get some jobs back, let's make our country great again, let's secure our borders, like things that people
[01:11:19.062 --> 01:11:20.883]  Well that of course is just talk.
[01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:22.243]  We have to see it actually happen.
[01:11:22.744 --> 01:11:30.987]  I remain skeptical of any person who comes in through any political party because we know that they're pretty much run by the same people anyway.
[01:11:31.047 --> 01:11:38.530]  My favorite line from the speech though, which I think is good advice, if you open your heart to patriotism there's no room for prejudice.
[01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:39.890]  That's a great line.
[01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.511]  Absolutely.
[01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:41.291]  I like that very much.
[01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:42.991]  Yeah, and you can't fight against that.
[01:11:43.031 --> 01:11:47.892]  That's why I'm curious to see just how the journalists are going to cover his speech today.
[01:11:47.932 --> 01:11:49.573]  And what are they going to be able to take out of that?
[01:11:49.613 --> 01:11:52.133]  How are they going to be able to spin it and make him the monster?
[01:11:52.153 --> 01:11:56.294]  We were covering a few days ago that thousands of people were on their way to protest.
[01:11:56.334 --> 01:11:58.154]  Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands.
[01:11:58.354 --> 01:12:04.016]  And the latest update on Washington Post as of 35 minutes ago are 100 arrests.
[01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:07.476]  So if we're seeing all of these protests, where are they exactly?
[01:12:07.516 --> 01:12:10.597]  I know that maybe in certain parts of the city there were some last night at the Deplorable.
[01:12:11.297 --> 01:12:14.462]  But largely, my sister's in Washington walking around, and I'm like, get some photographs!
[01:12:14.503 --> 01:12:16.065]  Is anybody protesting?
[01:12:16.105 --> 01:12:22.797]  Well, I mean, you see the inaugural parade kind of going on behind us, and I know they're pulling up the footage here and there, but it's...
[01:12:24.093 --> 01:12:26.715]  Largely without any problems.
[01:12:26.755 --> 01:12:28.657]  They're just kind of going on doing their thing.
[01:12:28.697 --> 01:12:29.618]  This is the ceremony.
[01:12:29.658 --> 01:12:32.000]  Wells Fargo and F Street there does have a shattered door.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.121]  FYI.
[01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:34.462]  There does seem to be that.
[01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:37.785]  There are little pockets of crime happening here.
[01:12:37.825 --> 01:12:39.046]  Typical night in D.C.
[01:12:39.607 --> 01:12:43.050]  What do you think the first order of business will be on Monday for the new president?
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:59.330]  Well he's talked about the executive orders he wants to start the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act as well as get the process going on immigration which is a lot of people are kind of up in arms about that but that's what he got voted in on for those promises.
[01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:08.476]  I think and of course everyone has been affected by the Affordable Care Act and of course the recent increases in premiums.
[01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:15.160]  If he can really come up with something, and this stuff doesn't happen overnight, there's no way that this happens in a month or two months.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.041]  And they don't want it to happen overnight.
[01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:18.602]  It'd be catastrophic, really.
[01:13:18.842 --> 01:13:22.144]  But even just the process, it takes a lot of time.
[01:13:22.585 --> 01:13:32.251]  But when you can save people $500, $700 a month, I think then we'll see some, and of course, if we still have reasonable coverage.
[01:13:32.631 --> 01:13:35.532]  We have to remember this is a banking scheme.
[01:13:35.552 --> 01:13:36.692]  This has nothing to do with anything.
[01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:37.372]  It's insurance.
[01:13:37.432 --> 01:13:40.813]  Insurance is just part of the banking system.
[01:13:41.953 --> 01:13:49.575]  And there's a lot wrong if you know that these same insurance companies basically negotiate doctors and hospitals down to 28 cents on the dollar.
[01:13:49.595 --> 01:13:50.336]  28 cents on the dollar!
[01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:54.909]  Which is why they overcharge for so many things.
[01:13:54.929 --> 01:14:02.053]  It costs you a hundred dollars for a q-tip or an aspirin because they know they're only gonna get a small part of that back.
[01:14:02.113 --> 01:14:20.863]  Do you remember when insurance companies were the enemy and it was all about making sure that they sort of like an antitrust measure was put into place that you were breaking them up and making sure that they didn't have a monopoly on a system and in reality looking at Obamacare we saw the same companies that are... Precisely.
[01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.845]  Aggregating which company?
[01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:26.226]  It's a straight... You get this state, you get that one.
[01:14:26.246 --> 01:14:26.766]  Precisely.
[01:14:26.786 --> 01:14:30.187]  It didn't actually break up the monopoly that it was supposed to break up.
[01:14:30.227 --> 01:14:30.688]  And I'm with you.
[01:14:30.728 --> 01:14:32.208]  I think healthcare is so unaffordable.
[01:14:33.209 --> 01:14:33.769]  Insurance.
[01:14:34.509 --> 01:14:35.530]  Healthcare insurance.
[01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:40.392]  The healthcare is actually 60% cheaper, almost 70% cheaper than what the insurance scam is actually saying.
[01:14:45.794 --> 01:14:58.444]  Well that's what actually our news producer Rob Dew is saying that he went in and when they had their fourth child they paid cash for it and he let the doctors know I'm watching every single penny nope I don't need that no I don't need that $100 q-tip.
[01:14:58.464 --> 01:15:12.636]  I think he said he paid around $5,000 and that same thing would have if you had insurance would have been $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 to have a child and then so you you know who can who can really pay that if you're a young person who just
[01:15:12.756 --> 01:15:13.657]  Well, that's just the bill.
[01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:14.699]  It's just phantom money.
[01:15:14.839 --> 01:15:20.207]  But the problem is, we're still paying premiums based upon that exorbitant price.
[01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:24.474]  But really what happens down at the bottom is something very different.
[01:15:24.494 --> 01:15:28.560]  And of course, it's mandatory, which makes it an annoying factor.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.182]  And Donald Trump has made it very clear that he agrees with some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
[01:15:34.222 --> 01:15:41.905]  He thinks that, no, you shouldn't be able to be denied coverage if you have pre-existing conditions, which is, that was the clincher there.
[01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:46.967]  Everyone should be able to get health insurance regardless if they have a pre-existing condition.
[01:15:47.007 --> 01:15:51.829]  So he doesn't want to do away with that, and I think that that's been a real disinfo that's been put out there.
[01:15:52.109 --> 01:15:53.510]  So many people feel like if
[01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.331]  If they repeal, that's going to go away.
[01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:59.633]  And I think across the board, they've tried to make that clear.
[01:15:59.653 --> 01:16:01.294]  That's not going away.
[01:16:01.814 --> 01:16:02.394]  That works.
[01:16:02.455 --> 01:16:03.175]  That's a good thing.
[01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:04.316]  We'll see.
[01:16:04.796 --> 01:16:06.237]  It has a cost associated with it.
[01:16:06.277 --> 01:16:07.317]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:18.663]  So if we do love our fellow citizens and we say, OK, I will pay more because someone who has a pre-existing condition can get coverage that way, of course.
[01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:21.165]  But there have to be some limitations.
[01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:22.785]  This is bankrupting people.
[01:16:22.805 --> 01:16:23.666]  It's bankrupting people.
[01:16:23.826 --> 01:16:26.967]  I don't have, I'm currently uninsured.
[01:16:27.267 --> 01:16:31.649]  I was as well until we just got this last round and it's costing me zero dollars.
[01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:47.914]  I have like catastrophic coverage so I'll have to pay like five thousand dollars but I was like fine sure since I'm not but other than that I've I've just taken the penalty because it's ridiculous it was like almost five hundred dollars a month and that was just you know that wasn't even my deductible.
[01:16:48.214 --> 01:16:52.158]  If you get up to my age, it's like, hey, $1,500 a month and $6,000 deductible.
[01:16:52.218 --> 01:16:53.459]  Yeah, you can afford that.
[01:16:53.499 --> 01:16:54.400]  What's your problem?
[01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:55.221]  Yeah.
[01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:56.942]  How many kids do you have to feed?
[01:16:57.043 --> 01:16:58.404]  So, yeah, I know so many families.
[01:16:58.444 --> 01:17:01.427]  And then, of course, if you do have kids in a family, you have to do it.
[01:17:01.487 --> 01:17:03.008]  You're under their thumb.
[01:17:03.309 --> 01:17:04.109]  You have no choice.
[01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:13.112]  So obviously that's going to be one thing and I know you were touching a lot on immigration and just these sanctuary cities.
[01:17:13.132 --> 01:17:14.092]  Oh my goodness.
[01:17:14.252 --> 01:17:15.253]  Well let's back up for a second.
[01:17:15.313 --> 01:17:19.414]  I've helped three people come into the United States legally.
[01:17:20.754 --> 01:17:22.334]  Sadly two of them were ex-wives.
[01:17:23.274 --> 01:17:25.415]  So I screwed on that deal.
[01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:29.976]  The main problem is the cost.
[01:17:30.156 --> 01:17:33.137]  I've helped people in Austin who
[01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:35.658]  You know, really needed to get legal.
[01:17:36.258 --> 01:17:40.099]  And it's just, you know, it's about $4,500-$5,000 per person.
[01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:44.840]  And although a lawyer will cost you about $1,500, all the rest is fees.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.121]  It's fees from the government to fill out a form.
[01:17:47.761 --> 01:17:49.061]  And actually they make a joke.
[01:17:49.141 --> 01:17:50.642]  Oh, it's $420 for this form.
[01:17:50.762 --> 01:17:51.842]  Okay, I got it.
[01:17:52.362 --> 01:17:53.943]  But that's exactly what's going on.
[01:17:54.023 --> 01:17:55.583]  It's huge fees.
[01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.144]  It's not that difficult.
[01:17:57.404 --> 01:17:58.004]  It really isn't.
[01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:03.726]  Um, it's just, it's a scammed up system people can't afford to do it.
[01:18:03.786 --> 01:18:14.491]  Well yeah, there's that, but then there's also this backlog with the visa process where you have people who've been trying to do it legally, they want to bring their money and their fortune and their business into this economy.
[01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:19.774]  I don't think that's, I don't know, I mean we had some passport issues and visa technology issues, the database.
[01:18:20.334 --> 01:18:22.555]  You know, got corrupted and was down for several weeks.
[01:18:23.136 --> 01:18:28.439]  I don't know if there's a huge backlog for any other reason than a lot of people maybe want to do it right now.
[01:18:28.879 --> 01:18:33.021]  Well, that's why there's the big issue of, you know, jumping the line, basically.
[01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:38.384]  You have people that just, you know, rushed in and as long as they met a certain threshold, they're getting in front of the line.
[01:18:38.424 --> 01:18:46.749]  As someone who did this legally twice, to then hear, oh, well, but, you know, we'll just let these people go or give them clemency or, you know, I don't like that idea.
[01:18:47.049 --> 01:18:49.110]  We have an amnesty issue too going on at the same time.
[01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:59.333]  So we've got a legal immigration issue, and then we have a problem with too much money, and then we have this asylum situation where people are rubber-stamped, for example, 117,884, which was his promise, and he met it, plus 884.
[01:19:08.295 --> 01:19:09.596]  We see a rubber stamping issue.
[01:19:09.656 --> 01:19:13.198]  What makes that person and their life more valuable?
[01:19:13.218 --> 01:19:22.883]  And it's a bizarre concept to think, okay, we're taking X amount of people from this area that we've declared to be, you know, it's just a strange way of doing it.
[01:19:22.944 --> 01:19:30.528]  And then doing away with the Cuba, the Cuban policy, where if you can make it to our land, if you can touch foot, I forget what the
[01:19:30.888 --> 01:19:35.390]  The phrase was there, but if you can make it to our country and set feet on our soil, then you can stay here.
[01:19:35.831 --> 01:19:38.112]  And Obama, last minute, did away with that.
[01:19:38.212 --> 01:19:42.494]  And they're saying that that was kind of in order to force Trump's hand.
[01:19:42.854 --> 01:19:49.278]  Well, if you have a problem with these people coming here from a communist country, why do you have a problem accepting refugees from war-torn countries?
[01:19:49.638 --> 01:19:59.263]  So it was kind of to put that into perspective, because you're thinking, why would Obama do that when he's also sitting here telling us that we need to accept all of these other people from these specific
[01:19:59.483 --> 01:20:05.491]  Well, again, I have no qualms about saying that I don't believe this is any humanitarian issue at all.
[01:20:05.611 --> 01:20:07.393]  Ultimately, again, it's about resources.
[01:20:07.453 --> 01:20:09.956]  So, oil, gas, drugs, and there's always a hooker involved.
[01:20:09.976 --> 01:20:10.597]  That's how it always is.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:16.601]  But the Syrian refugees, there was a huge pipeline built up with the Clinton Foundation.
[01:20:17.141 --> 01:20:26.343]  And the Clinton Foundation was placing them in Detroit and other places to help out other businesses around them, help out friends who have building businesses.
[01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:28.584]  So this pipeline was premeditated.
[01:20:28.664 --> 01:20:28.884]  Right.
[01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:31.364]  Specifically Syrian refugees.
[01:20:31.424 --> 01:20:31.684]  Right.
[01:20:32.485 --> 01:20:35.905]  To get that in, to really help other people.
[01:20:36.225 --> 01:20:38.426]  I'm not saying that the Syrian refugees weren't helped.
[01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:39.106]  Right.
[01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:41.689]  But there's always these other motivating factors.
[01:20:41.789 --> 01:20:51.558]  Well, it's interesting, you talk about Detroit and these other cities where we're seeing them kind of ravished with this current economy and even Flint, Michigan and others, they're just desperate for money to help them.
[01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:53.279]  Should you only have them in Austin?
[01:20:53.339 --> 01:20:53.560]  Yes.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.482]  I believe we have Syrian refugees against the wishes of the governor of Texas.
[01:20:56.522 --> 01:20:57.543]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:20:57.784 --> 01:21:00.886]  And that's a whole kind of other fight that's going on.
[01:21:01.738 --> 01:21:18.704]  But there is, okay, there is a, um, just the fact that they allow the Syrian, they say, they actually put this message out there, you know, that we're going to rebuild our cities with Syrian refugees, when the people that are actually in these cities suffering are going, Bill Clinton said we could rebuild Detroit with Syrian refugees.
[01:21:18.724 --> 01:21:19.844]  That's the pipeline.
[01:21:22.065 --> 01:21:27.108]  Well, I know, I hear we've got Alex Jones, I believe, is he going to be on Facebook Mentions here?
[01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.409]  Do we have him piping in with us?
[01:21:28.429 --> 01:21:31.090]  My whole family fought the Russians forever, but a bunch of them didn't.
[01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:34.552]  Oh my, oh, yes, yes sir, I'm getting all your orders right now.
[01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:35.173]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:21:35.353 --> 01:21:39.095]  Do you think, do you think... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:21:39.275 --> 01:21:40.296]  Do I think, what do I say, sir?
[01:21:40.316 --> 01:21:42.497]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:21:42.517 --> 01:21:44.678]  Do you think he has compromising information on Trump?
[01:21:44.959 --> 01:21:47.120]  Hold on, sir, does he have compromising information on Trump?
[01:21:48.318 --> 01:21:50.300]  Trump is the biggest control freak on earth.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.462]  You think he goes to Russia with whores they send up to his room?
[01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:53.822]  I do.
[01:21:54.562 --> 01:21:55.983]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:21:56.023 --> 01:21:57.885]  He specializes in that type of stuff.
[01:21:58.465 --> 01:21:59.526]  Trump doesn't do that.
[01:21:59.546 --> 01:22:01.067]  Let me tell you a little secret about Trump.
[01:22:01.347 --> 01:22:05.110]  If you're not the number 10 super beauty model, no, if Trump's in bed with you, he's married to you.
[01:22:06.951 --> 01:22:07.271]  Okay.
[01:22:07.931 --> 01:22:08.912]  I'm friends with his wingman.
[01:22:09.973 --> 01:22:10.433]  I believe you.
[01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:11.534]  Alright, true.
[01:22:13.024 --> 01:22:13.825]  Hey, how's the left feel?
[01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:14.726]  Because they really get pissed.
[01:22:15.026 --> 01:22:16.127]  You know, Trump never calls me.
[01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:17.528]  Every couple days.
[01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:19.630]  We don't have big, long talks.
[01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:22.653]  And I'm not involved in his speech writing either.
[01:22:24.215 --> 01:22:26.076]  Can you imagine how badass Trump is?
[01:22:26.357 --> 01:22:28.339]  Trump is so real and so Americana.
[01:22:28.599 --> 01:22:29.900]  Why not just be excited about it?
[01:22:30.461 --> 01:22:32.923]  Instead, the Russians are going to get us!
[01:22:33.363 --> 01:22:33.824]  Oh my God!
[01:22:35.186 --> 01:22:37.387]  There's a Russian under this plant!
[01:22:37.407 --> 01:22:38.788]  There's a Russian under this plant!
[01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:39.468]  Look at that!
[01:22:39.508 --> 01:22:43.270]  There's a Putin under this!
[01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:44.431]  Here's the thing.
[01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.012]  Russia isn't in our business.
[01:22:46.252 --> 01:22:47.332]  Russia's almost collapsed.
[01:22:47.552 --> 01:22:48.233]  They're not our enemy.
[01:22:48.413 --> 01:22:49.573]  So Trump doesn't want to attack them.
[01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:53.215]  See, in Trump's world, if you're not against us, we're not your enemy.
[01:22:53.475 --> 01:22:53.815]  Wow!
[01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:54.956]  What an original thought!
[01:22:55.176 --> 01:22:59.018]  If you're weak and falling apart like Russia, we want to help you build up.
[01:22:59.258 --> 01:23:00.539]  We don't want to piss on you.
[01:23:01.525 --> 01:23:02.046]  See the difference?
[01:23:02.306 --> 01:23:04.008]  The globals want to pick on a weak country.
[01:23:04.409 --> 01:23:05.150]  China's not weak.
[01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:06.171]  They're taking over everything.
[01:23:06.331 --> 01:23:07.252]  They're pushing us around.
[01:23:07.473 --> 01:23:08.474]  They did the OPM hack.
[01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:09.375]  20 million names.
[01:23:09.535 --> 01:23:10.276]  They've rolled us up.
[01:23:10.416 --> 01:23:11.999]  The country was this close to falling, bro!
[01:23:12.339 --> 01:23:13.480]  Thank God we've got Trump!
[01:23:14.462 --> 01:23:16.444]  The goddamn Chinese Communist are the enemy!
[01:23:17.506 --> 01:23:19.088]  And they're the ones hurting their own people!
[01:23:20.084 --> 01:23:23.788]  Is Trump going to block us from helping the Ukrainians fighting Russia?
[01:23:24.188 --> 01:23:27.852]  Our government under Obama overthrew the elected Ukrainian government.
[01:23:28.492 --> 01:23:36.320]  Their actual leader is Hal Hitler on TV and the left worships them while calling Trump Hitler as groups he put in power.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.482]  Obama literally are neo-Nazis.
[01:23:38.903 --> 01:23:41.125]  Their official campaign slogan is Hal Hitler.
[01:23:42.873 --> 01:23:43.313]  The left?
[01:23:44.053 --> 01:23:44.273]  No!
[01:23:44.393 --> 01:23:47.034]  The frickin' Ukrainian government are Nazis!
[01:23:47.274 --> 01:23:49.754]  Well, hey, some people get in there, sure.
[01:23:49.955 --> 01:23:50.215]  No!
[01:23:50.355 --> 01:23:51.795]  That's who our government put in power!
[01:23:52.855 --> 01:23:53.615]  Well, not for that.
[01:23:54.015 --> 01:23:54.776]  But I gotta hand it to them.
[01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:56.176]  The Nazis just have people howling Hitler.
[01:23:56.516 --> 01:24:00.397]  They have, like, hot blondes shooting electricity out of their fingers as they howl Hitler.
[01:24:00.777 --> 01:24:01.937]  I mean, who can make this up?
[01:24:02.497 --> 01:24:08.418]  It's like, oh, they're howling Hitler with electricity shooting out of their fingers, our government overthrew it, and I'm supposed to be for it.
[01:24:08.818 --> 01:24:09.759]  I've never been to Ukraine.
[01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:10.399]  I don't give a crap.
[01:24:10.419 --> 01:24:11.279]  I went and read all the data.
[01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:13.676]  I'm not for starting a war with Russia, dude.
[01:24:13.696 --> 01:24:15.037]  They got 10,000 nukes, man.
[01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:19.658]  Meanwhile, they don't have the Panama Canal, or all our ports, or 98% of rare earth minerals.
[01:24:19.798 --> 01:24:20.319]  They're taking over.
[01:24:20.419 --> 01:24:22.359]  The Chinese got 50,000 front companies, man.
[01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:24.360]  They've censored journalists, I know.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.840]  Movies can't come out because of them.
[01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.121]  The Chinese communists have hurt their own people.
[01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:33.363]  Now the globalists at Davos this week said their president spoke, unelected, appointed by the Politburo.
[01:24:33.883 --> 01:24:37.326]  He said, we will complete the New World Order and defeat the American populace.
[01:24:37.587 --> 01:24:40.630]  And our media was like, we're trusting in China to defeat Trump.
[01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:45.074]  Our media is saying they trust in China to defeat our new president.
[01:24:45.294 --> 01:24:45.834]  Jesus!
[01:24:46.235 --> 01:24:46.955]  What the hell?
[01:24:47.116 --> 01:24:49.438]  How could any of you not understand what's happening?
[01:24:49.758 --> 01:24:51.720]  What world do you live in?
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.722]  What the hell is your problem?
[01:24:55.194 --> 01:24:57.216]  Yang Zemin will save us!
[01:24:57.476 --> 01:24:57.876]  Go ahead!
[01:24:58.317 --> 01:24:59.598]  There's video, we'll cut it into this.
[01:25:00.298 --> 01:25:01.079]  I have nothing on that.
[01:25:01.139 --> 01:25:02.260]  We've reached Twilight Zone!
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.523]  Thank God the communist Chinese president is here to counter Trump.
[01:25:05.943 --> 01:25:11.048]  They're like, Xing, China will conquer American populism.
[01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:11.708]  What the hell?
[01:25:11.949 --> 01:25:13.570]  They got mobile execution vans, man.
[01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:15.071]  They killed Buddhists for no reason.
[01:25:15.472 --> 01:25:16.833]  Now I've got to kick their ass?
[01:25:17.453 --> 01:25:17.694]  No!
[01:25:18.354 --> 01:25:20.316]  And then people go, you must be against Chinese people.
[01:25:20.536 --> 01:25:22.237]  They've killed 100 million of their own people!
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.301]  The biggest victims of communism are Chinese!
[01:25:25.681 --> 01:25:28.283]  And I got a sinner!
[01:25:28.703 --> 01:25:29.904]  I don't need a board!
[01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.165]  I don't need any of this!
[01:25:31.845 --> 01:25:40.930]  The will of the Republic will dominate this big earth!
[01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.451]  Yeah!
[01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:42.971]  1776, baby!
[01:25:42.991 --> 01:25:45.012]  1776 will commence again!
[01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.553]  You like it?
[01:25:46.793 --> 01:25:48.154]  This is just the info war!
[01:25:48.374 --> 01:25:51.156]  Imagine you get in a physical fight with us, it's over!
[01:25:52.332 --> 01:25:53.193]  You understand that?
[01:25:54.735 --> 01:25:56.096]  I know you do now, don't you?
[01:25:56.857 --> 01:25:58.178]  We haven't taken the gloves off.
[01:25:58.399 --> 01:26:03.084]  And if you want to keep pushing with your commie Chinese and everybody else, we're going to blow your ass off the map.
[01:26:04.441 --> 01:26:07.023]  All the secret weapons ain't in the control of you anymore, are they?
[01:26:07.723 --> 01:26:10.265]  They're now in the hands of George Washington 2.0!
[01:26:11.746 --> 01:26:13.487]  So I know why you're shaking in fear.
[01:26:13.967 --> 01:26:14.287]  I'm done.
[01:26:14.307 --> 01:26:15.048]  Who else wants to talk?
[01:26:15.388 --> 01:26:16.969]  Talk to this guy.
[01:26:16.989 --> 01:26:18.030]  This guy right here.
[01:26:18.150 --> 01:26:18.890]  Oh God, Alex.
[01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:23.193]  I don't even know how to follow up with that.
[01:26:23.213 --> 01:26:28.036]  Well there you go, Alex Jones with another impassioned plea.
[01:26:30.658 --> 01:26:35.841]  He's got lots of fans here today and it is another situation where Alex just took control of the street.
[01:26:36.361 --> 01:26:40.123]  That's what he likes to do is come out here among the people and basically... Dominate.
[01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:43.518]  Dominating the situation.
[01:26:43.638 --> 01:26:47.399]  I've always wondered what happens if you take too much of the male vitality.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.960]  That's it right there.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:49.440]  Now you know.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:54.082]  I mean, is Alex going to get involved with any of these protesters tonight?
[01:26:54.102 --> 01:26:56.464]  Let's hope he gets off the street before they show.
[01:26:56.924 --> 01:26:58.524]  I feel sorry for the protester.
[01:26:58.544 --> 01:27:02.666]  Can you imagine that energy in the face of these fascists there?
[01:27:02.826 --> 01:27:04.747]  So, I guess it's about 5.30 there.
[01:27:04.807 --> 01:27:08.709]  We're going to play a few reports from our guys who are in D.C.
[01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:10.410]  We'll get to those here in a minute.
[01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:14.033]  Um, but yeah, I mean, just kind of closing comments.
[01:27:14.053 --> 01:27:16.134]  What do you guys think about what happened today?
[01:27:16.154 --> 01:27:16.855]  The feeling?
[01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:21.319]  What do you, what do you expect is going to happen, you know, over the weekend with the Women's March?
[01:27:21.339 --> 01:27:23.480]  And you think they were going to resist forever?
[01:27:24.537 --> 01:27:33.743]  No, I mean, clearly there is no actual driving force for people to really go and riot and cause a protest.
[01:27:34.743 --> 01:27:40.267]  It seems great on paper, it looks great on the social media, but when you get there, you know, it's scary.
[01:27:40.447 --> 01:27:41.547]  You've really got to be all in.
[01:27:42.128 --> 01:27:43.709]  I don't see that, I didn't expect it.
[01:27:44.129 --> 01:27:45.470]  There's always troublemakers, of course.
[01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:54.494]  But more importantly, I really want to see how the narrative about Russia continues, and when that will either fade.
[01:27:56.035 --> 01:27:58.396]  My uncle, he was in D.C.
[01:27:58.936 --> 01:28:00.657]  during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:28:00.717 --> 01:28:02.838]  People were really, really afraid.
[01:28:03.178 --> 01:28:06.880]  And there was Russia was going to do this, and it was, oh my gosh, and they were getting bomb shelters ready.
[01:28:09.881 --> 01:28:27.973]  It seems, this is even a more precarious situation that we're in today, whereas I know, I believe I know what's really going on, and this is, you know, besides that I think the President is pretty laid back in general, doesn't want to cause a ruckus, but this is really, our friendship, hopefully with Russia, is a big message to China.
[01:28:28.674 --> 01:28:37.760]  Because China really needs to know that there's more to us than just us, and that we do have other partners out there in the field.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.241]  I think Russia's going to be very important.
[01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:45.045]  However, what I believe is going to be critical is Kaliningrad.
[01:28:45.926 --> 01:28:50.810]  Now we have NATO in Poland, and Kaliningrad is right above Poland.
[01:28:50.930 --> 01:29:01.198]  Again, we have a province, a little piece of Russia that's sitting there, and I hope that we don't provoke too much for what's going on there.
[01:29:01.678 --> 01:29:02.958]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:03.018 --> 01:29:16.542]  And I know, kind of on that, that was something that Donald Trump said he's also going to be doing the first 100 days, is pulling us out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating that deal, as well as trying to renegotiate NAFTA as well.
[01:29:16.622 --> 01:29:18.103]  It's not even a deal.
[01:29:18.163 --> 01:29:20.643]  It was never signed, ratified, etc.
[01:29:20.663 --> 01:29:23.004]  NAFTA will be more interesting to unwind that.
[01:29:23.764 --> 01:29:26.965]  Let's actually get a businessman in there to negotiate on our behalf.
[01:29:27.025 --> 01:29:29.986]  Well, you know, we've been talking about this for decades.
[01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:31.866]  We should have business people in there.
[01:29:32.026 --> 01:29:33.227]  Well, now we've done it.
[01:29:33.247 --> 01:29:34.687]  We'll see how it works.
[01:29:34.987 --> 01:29:37.048]  Yeah, and so again, here's this alternate reality.
[01:29:37.088 --> 01:29:44.130]  You get Rex Tillerson, who is, you know, he could not be more embodiment of the oil and gas industry.
[01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:59.857]  But maybe, because again, the State Department, if you look at what certainly Hillary Clinton did, she would mobilize private forces, whatever needs to be done to get the oil and gas industry the resources they want by killing people.
[01:30:00.257 --> 01:30:01.858]  It's very possible
[01:30:02.518 --> 01:30:07.639]  That maybe if you put these guys in charge of it directly, it's like, oh, we can probably do a deal.
[01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:13.721]  We don't have to kill people, so there's not people in the middle who are involved who need to make money off of it and are dealing with power.
[01:30:13.761 --> 01:30:17.742]  And this is exactly what the Clinton Foundation, among many others, was doing.
[01:30:18.842 --> 01:30:20.122]  So, you know, we'll see.
[01:30:20.902 --> 01:30:21.862]  We'll see what happens.
[01:30:22.543 --> 01:30:24.023]  I really have high hopes.
[01:30:24.043 --> 01:30:28.384]  So do I. But I would be the first to stand up and say, uh-uh, this has got to go.
[01:30:28.564 --> 01:30:39.591]  Well, you know, us here at InfoWars, we're constantly trying to check those in power, so it's so difficult now where we're really being hopeful and also going, uh, when is, you know, when is that other shoe going to drop?
[01:30:39.711 --> 01:30:46.895]  Just kind of knowing how these things typically go, especially now that he is in bed with the goblins there in D.C.
[01:30:46.955 --> 01:30:47.455]  officially, so.
[01:30:48.536 --> 01:30:49.397]  What was the question?
[01:30:49.417 --> 01:30:51.439]  Just kind of, how do we feel?
[01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.200]  What do you think?
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:31:01.390]  I feel so hopeful that, you know, the past eight years, you know, guys, we put up, we dealt with it, we survived it, so surely you can too.
[01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:04.133]  Look, the economy, honestly, that's my thing.
[01:31:04.153 --> 01:31:04.914]  Speak for yourself!
[01:31:06.215 --> 01:31:13.439]  I feel like, you know, a breath of fresh air, honestly.
[01:31:13.499 --> 01:31:25.745]  A wind of change has happened and the speech of reclaiming our birthright, I feel like it's arrived and there is a blessing that is on the earth that hasn't been here, in my opinion, in a while and hopefully
[01:31:26.585 --> 01:31:41.793]  People that don't feel that way, they're going to start to feel economic relief and perhaps even ease up a little on this fear, this clenching that's happening when they see their family prosper, which is the goal of this.
[01:31:41.853 --> 01:31:44.755]  I really felt that way walking away from this with this speech today.
[01:31:45.635 --> 01:31:46.316]  I agree, yeah.
[01:31:46.796 --> 01:32:02.669]  You can't deny, just like you were mentioning, when you see the cost of your health care go down, and you're getting a little bit more money in your pocket every month, your family has, you're able to have two parents with an income, or maybe even just one parent because the job pays so well.
[01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:12.934]  Besides just the hope, I see some very interesting things taking place in this administration.
[01:32:13.014 --> 01:32:17.497]  It's obvious that the chief executive, Trump, has a chief operating officer.
[01:32:17.557 --> 01:32:18.017]  That's Pence.
[01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:24.851]  The Vice President will be very important in this administration.
[01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:25.311]  I agree.
[01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:27.652]  And that's kind of the way businesses work.
[01:32:27.952 --> 01:32:32.354]  You know, you have the operating guy, he runs around and I don't know who's going to do sales, but we'll find out.
[01:32:32.494 --> 01:32:32.754]  Yeah.
[01:32:33.154 --> 01:32:33.755]  No, I agree.
[01:32:33.775 --> 01:32:42.078]  I think Pence really impressed all of us when he had the debate and just kind of showed how he's going to be the opposite side of the pendulum there with Donald Trump.
[01:32:42.138 --> 01:32:43.979]  And yeah, so I definitely agree.
[01:32:43.999 --> 01:32:45.040]  I think we're in a
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.982]  Moving into some really good times for the United States of America.
[01:32:50.543 --> 01:32:52.164]  So we're going to go to some of these reports.
[01:32:52.384 --> 01:32:58.908]  The first one that looks really interesting to me, Owen Schroer shot this, so I think this is probably either from this morning or last night.
[01:32:59.688 --> 01:33:09.934]  These were Trump supporters who were in the face of these protesters and they were not backing down and we're told that this is excellent.
[01:33:10.014 --> 01:33:10.955]  Thank you, Owen Schroer.
[01:33:11.095 --> 01:33:11.996]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[01:33:13.136 --> 01:33:14.197]  Everyone, please stand.
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:23.261]  Everyone, please.
[01:33:23.341 --> 01:33:24.722]  I think... Is that it?
[01:33:24.762 --> 01:33:27.986]  I guess I don't need to... I should have been like, bye, see you!
[01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:29.127]  I'll ask them if they want me.
[01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:30.469]  This is an 11 minute report.
[01:33:30.529 --> 01:33:30.689]  Okay.
[01:33:44.056 --> 01:33:45.257]  There's going to be protesters.
[01:33:45.277 --> 01:33:48.619]  There's a march organized for Saturday, but already they're having problems.
[01:33:48.899 --> 01:33:51.900]  I read a brief thing that they're having inclusivity problems.
[01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:54.982]  They don't know what they're doing, but I think it's going to be peaceful.
[01:33:55.002 --> 01:34:02.106]  You walk down the streets here, you see everybody right there wearing a Trump shirt, people wearing Trump hats, and really, it's a great environment right here.
[01:34:02.126 --> 01:34:05.728]  Yeah, you guys recognized me and you were like, hey, let's talk to InfoWars.
[01:34:05.908 --> 01:34:07.269]  What do you expect from the protesters?
[01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:15.035]  Um, well, like Kevin says, this could be a lot of, uh, I think this could be a lot of small disruptions, because I think people, these people... That's right, there we go.
[01:34:15.196 --> 01:34:20.040]  I think these people really, a lot of them just don't have jobs, they don't care about them, so they actually... Or their job is to protest now, right?
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:30.829]  Exactly, yeah, $10 an hour, but, um, yeah, I think it's different when you're face-to-face with somebody, and, um, I mean, you see the atmosphere here, it's just very, like, we kind of took over the city, so, um... Yeah, it's great.
[01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:38.217]  Yeah, so I think there'll be small things, there'll be people just trying to, you know, show, oh yeah, I'm anti-Trump, but I don't think there's going to be any real violence.
[01:34:38.337 --> 01:34:40.579]  The funniest thing is that D.C.
[01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:51.091]  voted like 93% for Hillary, I want to say, and just being out and about, I got in yesterday morning, you guys have probably had the same experience, is that the majority of people here have never really talked to Trump supporters.
[01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:59.878]  And then you have in one week, you know, probably hundreds, hundreds, tens of thousands of us are shown into the city and people are having their real first exposure of the Trump supporters.
[01:35:00.439 --> 01:35:01.460]  And it's eye-opening for them.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.682]  And there's been a lot of people asking us, so why'd you vote for him?
[01:35:03.702 --> 01:35:08.566]  You know, I don't understand it, which is another topic, but it's their first peek into our opinions.
[01:35:08.886 --> 01:35:12.389]  And it's crazy, too, because, like you said, most of them probably haven't talked to a Trump supporter.
[01:35:12.409 --> 01:35:16.292]  They have all of these, you know, pre-decisions about who we are, what we think.
[01:35:17.073 --> 01:35:20.035]  Right, and then they talk to us and they're like, oh, you're actually normal guys.
[01:35:20.495 --> 01:35:21.616]  But that's what we were talking about.
[01:35:21.656 --> 01:35:23.698]  So, you know, you guys traveled here from Louisiana.
[01:35:23.858 --> 01:35:26.880]  Obviously, people traveled from all over the country to be here for the inauguration.
[01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:29.863]  Do you guys also think, I mean, are we going to just outnumber these people?
[01:35:30.583 --> 01:35:31.063]  I think so.
[01:35:31.143 --> 01:35:34.446]  I think we're going to outnumber them and we're going to out-spirit them just like we've been doing for the past year.
[01:35:34.806 --> 01:35:37.728]  Okay everyone, we are going to pull out of this report with Owen Schroer.
[01:35:37.828 --> 01:35:42.331]  Alex Jones is now back live in D.C., so let's go to Alex Jones.
[01:35:43.051 --> 01:35:47.234]  A lot of mean looks, mainly because we cheered when Trump gave his speech.
[01:35:48.455 --> 01:35:54.659]  So we got out of there, head over to see some of the protesters, and we got some mean mugs, a lot of questions.
[01:35:56.184 --> 01:35:57.325]  Lots of interviews for some reason.
[01:35:57.486 --> 01:35:57.986]  I wonder why.
[01:35:58.807 --> 01:36:00.929]  So, that was the experience today.
[01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:04.774]  Saw the parade and caught up with InfoWars like we planned.
[01:36:04.794 --> 01:36:05.875]  Oh, awesome.
[01:36:06.255 --> 01:36:08.918]  Well, tell us anything interesting that you've seen.
[01:36:08.938 --> 01:36:14.524]  Have you seen any skirmishes go down or any acts of goodwill between people?
[01:36:14.744 --> 01:36:15.585]  Yeah, acts of goodwill.
[01:36:16.912 --> 01:36:23.215]  We, we met him at a restaurant and we saw the InfoWars gear and we asked him, familiar with where's Alex, where's Alex?
[01:36:23.815 --> 01:36:32.940]  So we actually saw Rob Do a little bit in 909 a few hours ago and goodwill, they brought us here and we got to meet Alex.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:33.580]  Awesome!
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:34.961]  Absolutely, that's cool.
[01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:38.342]  So what do you think is going to happen now that Trump is in office?
[01:36:38.482 --> 01:36:39.923]  How do you think America is going to change?
[01:36:40.303 --> 01:36:45.386]  I think America will be a better overall country in the sense of
[01:36:46.807 --> 01:36:53.518]  Fiscally, more trade deals, more jobs coming back, lower taxes, people investing more, saving more.
[01:36:55.558 --> 01:36:56.239]  More prosperity.
[01:36:56.659 --> 01:36:58.020]  So that's what I'm looking forward to.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.320]  Awesome.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:58.900]  Fantastic, man.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.261]  Thank you.
[01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:00.862]  Well, thank you for talking to us.
[01:37:00.922 --> 01:37:01.502]  Appreciate it.
[01:37:02.022 --> 01:37:03.003]  Well, there you go.
[01:37:03.043 --> 01:37:04.284]  You hear from everybody on the street.
[01:37:04.704 --> 01:37:13.350]  You don't really see long-form interviews like this on mainstream media because they want to take everything, cut it into a little snippet or control the narrative, make people read off of teleprompters.
[01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:18.994]  We do have a young lady right here who seems to be eager to tell us her story.
[01:37:19.034 --> 01:37:19.434]  How you doing?
[01:37:19.454 --> 01:37:20.154]  What's your name, ma'am?
[01:37:20.375 --> 01:37:20.835]  Pam.
[01:37:21.055 --> 01:37:21.876]  How are you doing, Pam?
[01:37:22.076 --> 01:37:24.337]  Yes, just super, except for the cold toes.
[01:37:25.718 --> 01:37:26.619]  How was your day today?
[01:37:26.979 --> 01:37:28.560]  Yeah, it was absolutely wonderful.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.863]  And what was great about it was the spirit of Americans.
[01:37:32.323 --> 01:37:34.004]  These are the Americans that came out.
[01:37:34.645 --> 01:37:35.185]  It's very exciting.
[01:37:35.205 --> 01:37:37.547]  I'm kind of a political junkie and I like you.
[01:37:37.567 --> 01:37:38.408]  I quote you a lot.
[01:37:38.428 --> 01:37:39.308]  Well, thank you.
[01:37:39.429 --> 01:37:44.552]  Yeah, and these are the Americans who put ourselves back in business.
[01:37:45.213 --> 01:37:47.815]  And Trump heard us and here we are.
[01:37:48.015 --> 01:37:49.076]  And it was very exciting.
[01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.437]  Can't get this smile off my face.
[01:37:50.637 --> 01:37:51.618]  That is fantastic.
[01:37:51.658 --> 01:37:53.019]  What was the highlight of the day for you?
[01:37:53.439 --> 01:37:54.360]  I think his speech.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.461]  I loved his speech.
[01:37:56.841 --> 01:38:10.210]  While it was exactly Trumpian, it also was a little bit a slap in the face of Obama and what has been happening for the last eight years.
[01:38:10.931 --> 01:38:13.032]  And I thought it was cool.
[01:38:13.312 --> 01:38:17.235]  That's not a very eloquent word, but it was really good.
[01:38:17.695 --> 01:38:18.156]  Not at all.
[01:38:18.176 --> 01:38:19.678]  I think that describes it really well.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.210]  Yeah, I think he managed to come out in one fell swoop, sort of declare what his intentions are.
[01:38:28.191 --> 01:38:29.794]  What did you think of the ceremony overall?
[01:38:31.317 --> 01:38:32.858]  It was beautiful.
[01:38:32.898 --> 01:38:34.438]  It was the center of the universe.
[01:38:35.939 --> 01:38:36.579]  I loved it.
[01:38:37.259 --> 01:38:38.840]  Everybody in the world was watching.
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:43.541]  And even though I was just a little teeny-weeny red dot, yeah, I was there.
[01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:46.422]  Well, that's fantastic, and it was great to be part of that crowd.
[01:38:46.482 --> 01:38:53.024]  It was great to be there with so many like-minded people and feel the energy when they were all yelling Trump, hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:38:53.285 --> 01:38:54.125]  Are you from Georgia?
[01:38:54.725 --> 01:38:59.266]  I moved from Georgia to South Carolina, so now I'm a Nikki Haley fan.
[01:38:59.547 --> 01:38:59.967]  Aha!
[01:39:00.027 --> 01:39:00.587]  There you go.
[01:39:01.127 --> 01:39:01.567]  You know her?
[01:39:02.007 --> 01:39:02.207]  Yes.
[01:39:02.247 --> 01:39:03.608]  You know who she is?
[01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:04.108]  It's him.
[01:39:04.288 --> 01:39:05.008]  Nikki Haley.
[01:39:05.068 --> 01:39:07.769]  Nikki Haley's the governor of South Carolina.
[01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:09.790]  Yeah.
[01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:10.750]  So you know?
[01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:14.091]  Hey, I'm going to come right back to you in a moment, but let me just say this.
[01:39:14.671 --> 01:39:16.292]  People are saying bring back Drunk Alex.
[01:39:17.733 --> 01:39:18.854]  Well, I wish I was drunk.
[01:39:18.874 --> 01:39:21.196]  I hadn't had anything yet, but I'm exhausted.
[01:39:21.517 --> 01:39:23.038]  You shake over a thousand hands.
[01:39:23.398 --> 01:39:24.479]  You get up at 5 a.m.
[01:39:24.499 --> 01:39:25.340]  Buckley's like, get up!
[01:39:25.881 --> 01:39:26.802]  In our condo we got...
[01:39:28.647 --> 01:39:29.387]  Get up, get up!
[01:39:29.407 --> 01:39:32.188]  I've already been sleeping like midnight, and I'm tired.
[01:39:32.849 --> 01:39:38.792]  You go shake a thousand hands, you go out to this historic, and you interview hundreds of people, and let me tell you, you're not exhausted.
[01:39:38.812 --> 01:39:40.092]  You're triggered by a control freak, though.
[01:39:40.172 --> 01:39:40.913]  She triggered you.
[01:39:40.953 --> 01:39:41.333]  Do what?
[01:39:41.353 --> 01:39:43.074]  That control freak lady triggered you.
[01:39:43.094 --> 01:39:44.975]  The control freak did trigger me.
[01:39:45.655 --> 01:39:47.256]  She's like, oh my god, you smell like alcohol.
[01:39:47.276 --> 01:39:47.896]  You're a man.
[01:39:47.956 --> 01:39:48.777]  Which is a good idea.
[01:39:48.817 --> 01:39:50.138]  We ought to go in there and get a drink, actually.
[01:39:50.198 --> 01:39:50.678]  I thought of that.
[01:39:51.478 --> 01:39:51.799]  I did good.
[01:39:52.059 --> 01:39:54.201]  I went like 25 days last month without a ram.
[01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:54.761]  Muscle bit away.
[01:39:54.801 --> 01:39:56.803]  I've only gained 10 pounds back from taking a vacation.
[01:39:56.863 --> 01:39:58.585]  That's a pretty epic rant, though.
[01:39:58.625 --> 01:39:59.205]  That was pretty epic.
[01:39:59.245 --> 01:40:00.006]  What was that with her?
[01:40:00.447 --> 01:40:01.608]  Yeah, the whole thing.
[01:40:01.708 --> 01:40:02.929]  They go like, Russians?
[01:40:03.349 --> 01:40:05.091]  The Russians came to keep their country together.
[01:40:06.772 --> 01:40:08.694]  They literally say, I get minus from the Russians.
[01:40:09.415 --> 01:40:10.156]  What an insult!
[01:40:10.796 --> 01:40:12.598]  That's Maxine Waters, though.
[01:40:14.153 --> 01:40:16.436]  Like, I can't have my own idea, Mr. Trump can't.
[01:40:16.716 --> 01:40:18.158]  Everybody knows Trump's Mr. Idea.
[01:40:18.438 --> 01:40:20.481]  No, he gets it from Putin.
[01:40:20.541 --> 01:40:21.322]  Hold on, Mr. Putin.
[01:40:21.342 --> 01:40:23.064]  I mean, Buckley, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:40:24.345 --> 01:40:29.091]  It is pretty ridiculous, I mean... You're at the office with the Soros... Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:29.511 --> 01:40:30.111]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:32.593]  The red phone rings, the red phones from the Kremlin rings.
[01:40:33.153 --> 01:40:39.197]  Well, generally it's one of his attaches and Putin is holding on the line to talk to Alex.
[01:40:39.917 --> 01:40:46.381]  It's a very reverent moment, you know, the lights go down, they play the Russian national anthem and we unfurl some flags.
[01:40:46.401 --> 01:40:47.442]  This is Alexander Good.
[01:40:47.822 --> 01:40:48.743]  You were born in Russia.
[01:40:48.763 --> 01:40:50.984]  Your codename is Soprentor.
[01:40:51.024 --> 01:40:51.604]  You've done well.
[01:40:53.165 --> 01:40:54.246]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:40:54.266 --> 01:40:56.788]  And we will not rest until we have conquered the United States.
[01:40:56.808 --> 01:40:59.871]  No, no, he calls, he goes, well done, Corporal Commandant.
[01:41:00.311 --> 01:41:01.172]  Oh, thank you.
[01:41:01.612 --> 01:41:07.497]  Now I will merge with the Decepticon leadership, Megatron, to enslave the Earth.
[01:41:07.977 --> 01:41:09.298]  Good, good, Megatron.
[01:41:10.319 --> 01:41:12.481]  Or is it Autobots, roll out.
[01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:14.342]  I am Optimus Prime.
[01:41:15.723 --> 01:41:16.163]  Exactly.
[01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:16.844]  Well, there you go.
[01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:20.426]  From the mouth of Alex Jones himself, here we are.
[01:41:20.446 --> 01:41:21.546]  From the mouth of Supreme Court.
[01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:22.207]  Exactly.
[01:41:22.467 --> 01:41:24.768]  Here we are reporting to you live from Washington, D.C.
[01:41:24.828 --> 01:41:25.869]  It's been an epic day.
[01:41:26.329 --> 01:41:28.210]  I feel like it's going to be an epic night, too.
[01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:33.093]  We don't know what the future is in store for us, but at least we think it's bright because we have Donald Trump.
[01:41:33.113 --> 01:41:38.035]  He's got the keys to the nation, and he has a large percentage of us behind him that are really looking forward to it.
[01:41:38.055 --> 01:41:42.358]  And isn't it just worth it watching all the control freaks that are so arrogant crap their pants?
[01:41:43.138 --> 01:41:45.499]  And Trump's saying, hey, it isn't about Washington now, it's about you.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.581]  You see how sick Obama looked on the jumbo drone?
[01:41:48.681 --> 01:41:49.481]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:50.142 --> 01:41:50.482]  Absolutely.
[01:41:50.502 --> 01:41:53.063]  Because he was right up front, I couldn't see, but on the jumbo drone.
[01:41:53.303 --> 01:41:53.843]  Absolutely.
[01:41:53.883 --> 01:41:55.184]  I think they're all quaking in their boots.
[01:41:55.224 --> 01:41:56.925]  I think everybody here in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:57.285 --> 01:41:58.986]  better go look for a real job.
[01:41:59.466 --> 01:42:00.867]  A real job somewhere else.
[01:42:00.927 --> 01:42:03.888]  Maybe as an accountant or, you know, maybe a farmer.
[01:42:03.928 --> 01:42:04.469]  Maybe they need a job.
[01:42:04.509 --> 01:42:06.390]  Fifty years ago, this was not a wealthy city.
[01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:07.370]  It's the richest in the world.
[01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:08.631]  D.C.'
[01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:09.291]  's the richest in the world.
[01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:11.767]  Hey, you ain't making Swiss watches.
[01:42:11.827 --> 01:42:12.607]  It should be Geneva.
[01:42:13.508 --> 01:42:15.109]  Or it should be like, you know, New York.
[01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:17.590]  It should not be D.C.
[01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.051]  I mean, you don't produce anything.
[01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:22.073]  They walk around, you know, arrogant in black trench coats.
[01:42:22.153 --> 01:42:22.493]  Guess what?
[01:42:24.585 --> 01:42:25.125]  You want to fight?
[01:42:25.686 --> 01:42:26.626]  Meet me in my Huckleberry.
[01:42:27.386 --> 01:42:29.287]  Or as they say in true grit, fill your hands.
[01:42:29.968 --> 01:42:30.988]  I guess you did fill your hands.
[01:42:31.188 --> 01:42:32.869]  We just kicked your ass up and down the street.
[01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:37.171]  And hey, if you want to go to the next level, to physical, that's your deal to start.
[01:42:37.512 --> 01:42:40.113]  Because everybody knows, folks on defense always win.
[01:42:41.138 --> 01:42:41.598]  Absolutely.
[01:42:41.638 --> 01:42:43.739]  Well, thank you for joining us here in Washington, D.C.
[01:42:43.979 --> 01:42:45.839]  for this epic, epic transmission.
[01:42:46.339 --> 01:42:53.780]  And if you go to Infowars.com forward slash show, they're going to keep going because we're going to keep coverage of this until 10 p.m.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:56.241]  Central, which is 11 p.m.
[01:42:56.661 --> 01:42:57.641]  Eastern Standard Time.
[01:42:58.121 --> 01:43:00.682]  And we have everybody there in the studio breaking things down.
[01:43:00.702 --> 01:43:06.623]  We have lots of reporters roaming around here, finding information, looking into all the different stories that are developing right now.
[01:43:06.943 --> 01:43:08.704]  So once again, thank you so much for joining us.

[01:43:13.547 --> 01:43:16.649]  And we'll probably pop up here in a little bit, Noah and Alex.
[01:43:16.689 --> 01:43:17.690]  So thanks a lot.
[01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:18.450]  Thank you for all the love.
[01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:19.431]  Thank you for all the support.
[01:43:19.851 --> 01:43:20.511]  Have a good evening.
[01:43:20.712 --> 01:43:21.612]  Buckley Hammond signing off.
[01:43:32.776 --> 01:43:37.520]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[01:43:37.701 --> 01:43:44.767]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[01:43:45.027 --> 01:43:47.450]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:49.431]  And I started to try to eat healthy.
[01:43:49.651 --> 01:43:51.293]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[01:43:51.693 --> 01:43:53.494]  Started seeing some more gains.
[01:43:54.035 --> 01:44:04.402]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[01:44:04.422 --> 01:44:04.843]  Boom!
[01:44:05.243 --> 01:44:06.684]  Weight started pouring off.
[01:44:06.784 --> 01:44:08.706]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[01:44:09.146 --> 01:44:10.307]  Then, by early 2016,
[01:44:12.368 --> 01:44:15.551]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[01:44:15.752 --> 01:44:16.813]  But the election heated up.
[01:44:16.853 --> 01:44:19.235]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:44:19.355 --> 01:44:28.604]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:44:28.844 --> 01:44:29.785]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[01:44:29.965 --> 01:44:33.648]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:44:34.449 --> 01:44:40.521]  And I'm gonna start taking it religiously again, and I'm gonna work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:41.904]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[01:44:41.964 --> 01:44:45.491]  And whatever the results are, I'm gonna publish the findings.
[01:44:47.398 --> 01:44:49.159]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:44:49.559 --> 01:44:51.060]  I'm religiously taking the products.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.141]  And in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[01:44:54.481 --> 01:45:00.944]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[01:45:01.364 --> 01:45:01.884]  It's amazing.
[01:45:02.184 --> 01:45:04.565]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:45:04.845 --> 01:45:07.546]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:45:07.746 --> 01:45:10.307]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[01:45:10.988 --> 01:45:14.969]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[01:45:14.989 --> 01:45:16.330]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[01:45:17.756 --> 01:45:20.898]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[01:45:21.338 --> 01:45:22.599]  So I'm eating worse.
[01:45:23.219 --> 01:45:30.623]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[01:45:30.743 --> 01:45:31.283]  It's incredible.
[01:45:32.304 --> 01:45:34.205]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[01:45:34.465 --> 01:45:35.426]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[01:45:35.846 --> 01:45:38.247]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[01:45:38.847 --> 01:45:39.728]  This is an experiment.
[01:45:39.848 --> 01:45:40.588]  Everybody's watching.
[01:45:40.829 --> 01:45:41.669]  We'll see what happens.
[01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.950]  This is Part 2.
[01:45:47.099 --> 01:45:47.720]  Well, here we are.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.841]  Another week has passed.
[01:45:49.461 --> 01:46:01.553]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[01:46:01.573 --> 01:46:03.514]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[01:46:03.975 --> 01:46:04.916]  I've lost a pound.
[01:46:05.416 --> 01:46:06.337]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[01:46:07.938 --> 01:46:12.103]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[01:46:12.123 --> 01:46:13.745]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[01:46:13.785 --> 01:46:15.847]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[01:46:16.708 --> 01:46:21.393]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[01:46:21.914 --> 01:46:24.397]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[01:46:24.497 --> 01:46:26.079]  Let's see what happens next week.
[01:46:32.739 --> 01:46:38.901]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:46:39.281 --> 01:46:42.142]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:46:42.502 --> 01:46:47.684]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:46:48.104 --> 01:46:54.085]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:46:54.226 --> 01:46:57.366]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:46:57.507 --> 01:46:58.967]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:46:59.167 --> 01:47:03.310]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:06.353]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.014]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:47:08.114 --> 01:47:11.297]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:47:11.577 --> 01:47:13.899]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:47:14.179 --> 01:47:15.140]  It's in powder form.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.942]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:47:18.122 --> 01:47:18.722]  I take this.
[01:47:18.823 --> 01:47:20.524]  This is the product that I take.
[01:47:20.644 --> 01:47:22.606]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:47:23.426 --> 01:47:24.207]  We fight the Globals.
[01:47:24.227 --> 01:47:25.087]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:47:46.654 --> 01:47:48.915]  There's the wall of meat driving by.
[01:47:48.955 --> 01:47:49.395]  There it is.
[01:47:49.415 --> 01:47:51.876]  I don't think that's the official wall of meat.
[01:47:51.896 --> 01:47:54.477]  Maybe I should put my glasses on.
[01:47:56.277 --> 01:47:58.438]  Yes, we're here kind of watching all the ceremony play out.
[01:47:58.478 --> 01:48:07.101]  I gotta admit I really have never tuned into this so I don't know this little bit of Americana that's happening right now with all of the
[01:48:08.576 --> 01:48:12.397]  The typical things that would happen in the inaugural parade, but here it is behind us going on.
[01:48:12.457 --> 01:48:14.718]  It's an incredible time to be alive, folks.
[01:48:15.098 --> 01:48:21.260]  I wanted to talk a little bit, just briefly, about some fake news that CNN engaged in this morning.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:27.542]  So they said, Nancy Sinatra is not happy Trump will use her father's song at inauguration.
[01:48:28.082 --> 01:48:30.463]  And she tweeted back at them, that's not true.
[01:48:30.483 --> 01:48:31.483]  I never said that.
[01:48:31.763 --> 01:48:32.824]  Why do you lie, CNN?
[01:48:35.947 --> 01:48:38.590]  Why is everyone so obsessed with celebrity?
[01:48:40.072 --> 01:48:42.775]  Celebrities of course will change the course of history.
[01:48:43.176 --> 01:48:46.580]  Oh yes, as they've proven in this election cycle.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.084]  That their power is no more, in fact.
[01:48:49.464 --> 01:48:51.507]  Which, that's pretty incredible to me to just see.
[01:48:52.848 --> 01:48:54.789]  Seeing people break through that conditioning.
[01:48:54.989 --> 01:49:00.850]  You know, you played kind of a pivotal role back in the day of conditioning the minds of the youth, and now what do you think?
[01:49:00.970 --> 01:49:04.231]  I was totally responsible for ruining a lot of youngsters.
[01:49:04.251 --> 01:49:04.871]  He's taking it!
[01:49:05.491 --> 01:49:07.191]  He's taking it!
[01:49:07.611 --> 01:49:14.273]  And I woke up one day, I literally realized, oh my god, this is not what I want to do, this is not where I want to go.
[01:49:15.173 --> 01:49:17.714]  I've been in radio and television since I was 15.
[01:49:19.239 --> 01:49:25.764]  And, you know, don't ever think that there's like this magical, you know, memo that goes around, you have to talk this way.
[01:49:25.824 --> 01:49:26.404]  It's the milieu.
[01:49:26.464 --> 01:49:32.888]  It's how, you know, no matter where you are, it's how just the organism itself, people flow along with that.
[01:49:32.968 --> 01:49:41.094]  And, you know, to see, and that was the last time I was here, to see what MTV has become and the position they're taking was very disappointing for my alma mater.
[01:49:41.454 --> 01:49:50.070]  Yeah, I mean did you see the outright brainwashing and propaganda and it's just really interesting that it's almost so heavy-handed that
[01:49:51.472 --> 01:49:53.132]  It's caused people to wake up.
[01:49:53.193 --> 01:49:54.633]  So you almost got to be thankful for it.
[01:49:54.953 --> 01:49:57.033]  Just like all of these kids being born with autism.
[01:49:57.934 --> 01:50:04.115]  They're all being born at a certain time all at once to force humanity to go, what the hell is going on?
[01:50:04.395 --> 01:50:05.816]  We shouldn't all have cancer.
[01:50:05.936 --> 01:50:06.696]  We shouldn't all be sick.
[01:50:06.816 --> 01:50:07.716]  Something's happening.
[01:50:08.016 --> 01:50:14.538]  So it's almost as if it's a divine happening that's forcing us to wake up on a mass scale.
[01:50:15.578 --> 01:50:19.301]  You know, I would say that that's kind of a good thing, that we're being bombarded with it.
[01:50:19.321 --> 01:50:23.545]  I'm not quite sure I'm on board with the divine intervention giving kids autism.
[01:50:24.146 --> 01:50:26.187]  I think that may be things like Atrazine.
[01:50:26.308 --> 01:50:27.869]  Yes, agreed!
[01:50:27.889 --> 01:50:34.815]  And it's also recognizing there are children who are very special, who may not be the norm, who are usually highly intelligent.
[01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:35.716]  Very much so.
[01:50:36.076 --> 01:50:37.077]  I'm with you on that.
[01:50:53.048 --> 01:51:12.055]  Well we have this, it is our free will universe and so for such a long time people have just sort of sat back and allowed our food supply, air, everything to just be bombarded with this onslaught of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and everything and then just wondering, I mean so it's almost like, wake up people, wake up!
[01:51:12.515 --> 01:51:14.416]  And I feel like humanity truly has with this.
[01:51:15.316 --> 01:51:16.697]  I want to start being less apologetic.
[01:51:16.877 --> 01:51:30.905]  I absolutely think, just to clarify this and then we can move on to Trump because this is bigger news, there is no question in my personal brain that there is a corollary link between vaccinating, not having a blood brain barrier, and autism.
[01:51:31.085 --> 01:51:31.646]  No question.
[01:51:31.866 --> 01:51:32.086]  For me.
[01:51:32.850 --> 01:51:41.715]  Well, it's nice to see that Robert Kennedy will be running the Vaccine Safety Council.
[01:51:42.655 --> 01:51:45.837]  We've had this fund for many, many years in the United States.
[01:51:46.598 --> 01:51:50.099]  The pharmaceutical companies are indemnified.
[01:51:53.001 --> 01:51:56.144]  By law, they are untouchable.
[01:51:56.404 --> 01:52:01.028]  But there is this huge fund that pays people, you know, just take the money and shut up.
[01:52:01.188 --> 01:52:05.551]  If your kid has severe harm or death, but there's no admission of guilt.
[01:52:05.932 --> 01:52:06.772]  No, no.
[01:52:06.832 --> 01:52:07.713]  Hush money, sort of.
[01:52:07.733 --> 01:52:08.373]  That would be silly.
[01:52:08.414 --> 01:52:12.857]  But, you know, of course there's some original vaccines that I think are pretty darn good.
[01:52:12.977 --> 01:52:13.638]  Yeah, of course.
[01:52:15.219 --> 01:52:17.941]  I think it's giving like 30 before the age of 3, that's the problem.
[01:52:17.961 --> 01:52:19.122]  That's a little much.
[01:52:19.683 --> 01:52:28.850]  Other countries that don't have these communicable diseases don't bombard their children with the vaccine.
[01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:34.314]  I think it's everywhere now and you know, if there's one thing that bothers me the most, it's Gardazil, it's HPV.
[01:52:34.334 --> 01:52:40.459]  I have many women in my life and they are terrorized by the pharmaceutical system for something that
[01:52:41.079 --> 01:52:44.042]  Really, a lot of people have and you can get rid of it yourself.
[01:52:44.062 --> 01:52:55.032]  Yeah, well, and also too, Gardasil, it'll cure, it'll help you not get those certain two types of cervical cancer, but it makes you more susceptible to 17 other kinds that are much worse than those.
[01:52:55.052 --> 01:52:56.112]  They don't tell you that though.
[01:52:56.153 --> 01:52:59.315]  But that's in every, every, every Western country now.
[01:52:59.435 --> 01:53:07.723]  Every Western country, they're pushing the HPV vaccination for boys as well, of course, because, you know, boys have cervical issues.
[01:53:08.208 --> 01:53:12.591]  Right, well and that's the reason why it's so prevalent is because there's no test for it when the guys have it.
[01:53:12.651 --> 01:53:29.281]  But it's, yeah, it's a dangerous precedent we're setting and I feel like we do have a president that's kind of going, you know what, I'm going to thumb my nose in your face and I'm going to appoint people who are, I forget these other appointees, like people who are questioning climate change.
[01:53:29.301 --> 01:53:35.805]  I'm going to put him in charge of the EPA and I'm going to let Robert Kennedy be in charge of this, let's study this!
[01:53:37.046 --> 01:53:50.506]  Let's actually get some people in there who aren't afraid to ask the the hard tough questions that don't just go along with the typical narrative and you know which you'll be demonized if you dare say well wait a minute is the science settled?
[01:53:51.823 --> 01:53:52.904]  Well, we're going to see how it goes.
[01:53:53.585 --> 01:53:56.468]  I'm cautiously very optimistic about everything.
[01:53:57.028 --> 01:53:58.069]  I think it's a clean slate.
[01:53:58.390 --> 01:54:01.312]  It obviously is something, a completely new direction.
[01:54:02.814 --> 01:54:07.819]  And, you know, I think within a couple weeks we'll already know how things are going.
[01:54:07.939 --> 01:54:12.103]  But that'll have to be based upon data and not, obviously, based upon mainstream reporting.
[01:54:12.263 --> 01:54:12.504]  Yes.
[01:54:12.644 --> 01:54:15.086]  Well, Adam, I think that what's happening here is you
[01:54:16.246 --> 01:54:21.973]  You just don't want to be featured in any of these videos that we make in a year or two with all the crying Obama people.
[01:54:21.993 --> 01:54:23.454]  Who, me?
[01:54:23.654 --> 01:54:25.296]  I would be perfect for that!
[01:54:25.376 --> 01:54:26.678]  Come on!
[01:54:27.399 --> 01:54:28.200]  Trump, yay!
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:29.521]  He's gonna save everything!
[01:54:29.561 --> 01:54:30.843]  I have to adjust my man bun.
[01:54:34.072 --> 01:54:35.774]  I did not have a mullet.
[01:54:35.794 --> 01:54:39.737]  This is technically not a mullet that I had.
[01:54:39.798 --> 01:54:41.679]  It was beautiful blonde locks.
[01:54:41.699 --> 01:54:42.940]  I did not have a mullet!
[01:54:51.997 --> 01:54:53.338]  Fine, I think I've overstayed my welcome here.
[01:54:53.358 --> 01:54:57.082]  Yeah, I think we definitely need to pull up some photos from the past.
[01:54:57.422 --> 01:54:58.123]  We'll find those.
[01:54:58.903 --> 01:55:01.065]  Oh, you don't want to see my family photos from the past.
[01:55:01.786 --> 01:55:03.067]  She did have a little bit of a moment.
[01:55:03.107 --> 01:55:05.830]  Yeah, my mom gave me really awesome home haircuts.
[01:55:06.791 --> 01:55:10.855]  Okay, well we're going to go to a report from one of our reporters there on the field.
[01:55:11.335 --> 01:55:14.198]  So I wanted to thank you, Margaret Howell and Adam Curry.
[01:55:14.238 --> 01:55:17.781]  What time do you do the live version of the No Agenda?
[01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:20.462]  Well, we'll be deconstructing, of course, this whole inauguration.
[01:55:20.522 --> 01:55:26.165]  We do it live on Sunday, No Agenda Show, noagendashow.com, and that starts at 11 o'clock Austin time.
[01:55:26.185 --> 01:55:28.526]  But of course, the podcast, you can listen to it anytime you want.
[01:55:28.666 --> 01:55:29.526]  Anytime you want.
[01:55:29.626 --> 01:55:29.946]  Excellent.
[01:55:29.966 --> 01:55:31.127]  Well, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:55:31.167 --> 01:55:31.387]  Thank you.
[01:55:31.407 --> 01:55:31.987]  Nice meeting you.
[01:55:32.127 --> 01:55:32.327]  Again.
[01:55:33.228 --> 01:55:33.528]  Yes.
[01:55:34.008 --> 01:55:40.471]  And we're going to go ahead and play this report from Kid Daniel's watch, Explosions, Fires at Anti-Trump D.C.
[01:55:40.531 --> 01:55:41.071]  Protest.
[01:55:48.106 --> 01:55:52.829]  I'm at 13th Street and K Street.
[01:55:52.849 --> 01:55:58.953]  It sounds like flashbang explosions.
[01:56:18.203 --> 01:56:20.570]  Mary's blown out.
[01:56:20.751 --> 01:56:22.797]  We're wearing goggles.
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:40.721]  You hyped up under those f***ing kicks!
[01:56:40.861 --> 01:56:42.621]  Come on then!
[01:56:42.801 --> 01:56:43.261]  One unit!
[01:56:43.581 --> 01:56:49.103]  If you break up that unit by not standing together, then you're not a unit!
[01:56:49.143 --> 01:56:50.023]  Hey, that's my car.
[01:56:50.163 --> 01:56:53.184]  It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
[01:56:53.424 --> 01:56:54.704]  It's not a standing round.
[01:56:54.824 --> 01:56:55.705]  Alright, alright.
[01:56:55.725 --> 01:56:56.605]  Sure, bye bye.
[01:57:10.365 --> 01:57:10.845]  Don't touch me.
[01:57:10.885 --> 01:57:11.505]  You're a journalist.
[01:57:36.493 --> 01:57:36.693]  Back up!
[01:57:36.733 --> 01:57:36.893]  Back up!
[01:57:36.933 --> 01:57:37.093]  Back up!
[01:57:37.113 --> 01:57:37.274]  Back up!
[01:57:37.294 --> 01:57:37.514]  Back up!
[01:57:37.534 --> 01:57:37.734]  Back up!
[01:57:37.754 --> 01:57:37.994]  Back up!
[01:57:38.014 --> 01:57:38.214]  Back up!
[01:57:38.234 --> 01:57:38.394]  Back up!
[01:57:38.434 --> 01:57:38.634]  Back up!
[01:57:38.675 --> 01:57:38.915]  Back up!
[01:57:38.955 --> 01:57:39.155]  Back up!
[01:58:06.599 --> 01:58:08.022]  Hey Daniel, Head4Wars.com.
[01:58:08.123 --> 01:58:11.269]  Watching the scene in the corner of 12th and L Street.
[01:58:12.392 --> 01:58:15.980]  Looks like they are burning an American flag or something.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:16.621]  Let's go take a look.
[01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:26.674]  This is live, everybody.
[01:58:27.715 --> 01:58:39.463]  This is the burning sensation of the acres, of the whole acres.
[01:58:39.523 --> 01:58:40.424]  Please!
[01:58:45.664 --> 01:58:49.188]  So we're at a four-to-one media to protest our situation.
[01:58:49.208 --> 01:58:50.229]  I'm getting out of here.
[01:59:05.743 --> 01:59:07.325]  This is not the news!
[01:59:07.365 --> 01:59:08.106]  This is not the news!
[01:59:08.167 --> 01:59:09.528]  This is not the news!
[01:59:09.568 --> 01:59:10.910]  This is not the news!
[01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:12.092]  This is not the news!
[01:59:12.172 --> 01:59:13.393]  This is not the news!
[01:59:32.122 --> 01:59:39.226]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:59:39.607 --> 01:59:52.835]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:59:52.875 --> 01:59:56.897]  But this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today.
[01:59:57.157 --> 01:59:59.379]  Support your own health and support the InfoWars.
[02:00:05.077 --> 02:00:05.177]  Yeah.
[02:00:12.284 --> 02:00:18.448]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:00:18.928 --> 02:00:21.710]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:00:22.050 --> 02:00:27.233]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:33.637]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:00:33.777 --> 02:00:36.919]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:00:37.059 --> 02:00:38.500]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:42.864]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:00:43.044 --> 02:00:45.907]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:00:45.987 --> 02:00:47.568]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:00:47.648 --> 02:00:50.831]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:53.434]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:00:53.734 --> 02:00:54.695]  It's in powder form.
[02:00:54.775 --> 02:00:57.477]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:00:57.657 --> 02:00:58.258]  I take this.
[02:00:58.378 --> 02:01:00.080]  This is the product that I take.
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:02.161]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:01:02.982 --> 02:01:03.743]  We fight the Globals.
[02:01:03.783 --> 02:01:04.624]  We fight the New World Order.
[02:01:04.904 --> 02:01:11.530]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:16.674]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:01:16.734 --> 02:01:27.664]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:01:27.844 --> 02:01:32.747]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:01:32.867 --> 02:01:35.389]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:01:35.449 --> 02:01:36.950]  It helps detoxify.
[02:01:37.170 --> 02:01:39.992]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:01:40.052 --> 02:01:44.795]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:01:44.815 --> 02:01:51.059]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:56.383]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:01:56.403 --> 02:01:57.824]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:01:57.824 --> 02:01:58.845]  Okay, this is so key.
[02:01:59.106 --> 02:02:03.391]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:02:03.431 --> 02:02:05.533]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:02:05.633 --> 02:02:09.057]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:02:09.077 --> 02:02:09.778]  Everyone please stand.
[02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:35.213]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[02:02:35.233 --> 02:02:39.037]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:02:39.877 --> 02:02:42.880]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:45.302]  That I will faithfully execute.
[02:02:45.943 --> 02:02:48.125]  That I will faithfully execute.
[02:02:48.345 --> 02:02:51.028]  The office of President of the United States.
[02:02:51.408 --> 02:02:54.349]  The office of President of the United States.
[02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:56.731]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:02:57.231 --> 02:02:59.412]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:02:59.792 --> 02:03:01.853]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:03:02.273 --> 02:03:04.094]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:03:04.354 --> 02:03:06.355]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:03:06.495 --> 02:03:08.856]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:03:08.996 --> 02:03:09.837]  So help me God.
[02:03:10.057 --> 02:03:10.917]  So help me God.
[02:03:11.437 --> 02:03:12.658]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:04:21.112 --> 02:04:31.489]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[02:04:57.665 --> 02:05:12.217]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[02:05:17.958 --> 02:05:31.649]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[02:05:33.791 --> 02:05:41.677]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.762]  We will face challenges.
[02:05:45.383 --> 02:05:47.045]  We will confront hardships.
[02:05:47.666 --> 02:05:49.708]  But we will get the job done.
[02:05:51.150 --> 02:05:57.357]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[02:05:58.504 --> 02:06:09.253]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[02:06:09.914 --> 02:06:12.196]  They have been magnificent.
[02:06:12.516 --> 02:06:12.977]  Thank you.
[02:06:20.463 --> 02:06:21.944]  Today's ceremony, however,
[02:06:22.813 --> 02:06:24.753]  Has very special meaning.
[02:06:25.654 --> 02:06:31.795]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[02:06:32.455 --> 02:06:34.036]  Or from one party to another.
[02:06:34.716 --> 02:06:38.837]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:06:39.397 --> 02:06:42.498]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:06:51.627 --> 02:06:53.388]  I make this promise.
[02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:58.271]  We will make America strong again.
[02:07:00.453 --> 02:07:03.715]  We will make America proud again.
[02:07:05.396 --> 02:07:08.698]  We will make America safe again.
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.502]  And we will make America great again!
[02:07:14.642 --> 02:07:19.105]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next President of the United States, Donald Trump!
[02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:28.399]  The show goes on!
[02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:39.850]  Representing College Station, Texas.
[02:08:40.110 --> 02:08:46.113]  A youth country and western dance team made up of boys and girls from ages 8 to 18.
[02:08:46.153 --> 02:08:50.155]  These are the Little and Elite Wranglers from College Station, Texas.
[02:09:09.424 --> 02:09:16.925]  Once again, the Boy Scouts of America from Bethesda, Maryland, carrying state flags in the order that they entered the Union.
[02:09:16.965 --> 02:09:30.048]  From Maine, Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, and Oregon.
[02:09:30.708 --> 02:09:37.229]  Let's hear it once again for the Boy Scouts of America National Capital Area Council for their participation today.
[02:09:45.313 --> 02:09:55.439]  Now, once again, to tell you about our next military element from the DoD, our special announcer for the day, Marine Corporal Alex Smith.
[02:09:55.479 --> 02:10:03.084]  Coming up next is the Air Force, and representing them in today's parade is the Air Force staff.
[02:10:03.104 --> 02:10:08.067]  Surprising, the four-member staff are members of each component of the service.
[02:10:08.307 --> 02:10:14.211]  Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard, and the United States Air Force Academy.
[02:10:41.749 --> 02:10:41.829]  Yeah!
[02:10:59.975 --> 02:11:02.857]  Let's hear it for the Air Force Band!
[02:11:02.877 --> 02:11:12.982]  Following them is the United States Air Force Academy, represented by 90 cadets of the United States Air Force Academy, marching beneath the colors of the Cadet Wing.
[02:11:13.022 --> 02:11:16.985]  These young men and women represent more than 4,000 members of the Air Force Cadet Wing.
[02:11:18.346 --> 02:11:20.329]  Following them is the United States Air Force.
[02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:24.356]  Representing the active duty Air Force is the United States Air Force Honor Guard.
[02:11:24.777 --> 02:11:29.184]  The all-volunteer unit has represented the Air Force at official ceremonies around the nation since 1948.
[02:11:32.831 --> 02:11:35.314]  Following them is the United States Air Force Color Guard.
[02:11:35.914 --> 02:11:41.900]  Proudly carrying the colors of the nation, the United States Air Force are members of the United States Air Force Honor Guard.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:53.571]  Established in 1948, the Honor Guard performs in a variety of ceremonies, including promotions, retirements, military funerals, and state funerals, including President Reagan's.
[02:11:55.171 --> 02:12:11.333]  Now marching on behalf of the United States Air National Guard, members of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, the Capitol Guardians, have supported every presidential inauguration since 1861, the inauguration of President Lincoln.
[02:12:20.197 --> 02:12:22.418]  Following them is the United States Air Force Reserve.
[02:12:22.778 --> 02:12:36.464]  Representing nearly 70,000 citizen airmen of the United States Air Force Reserve is the 459th Air Refueling Wing located at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.
[02:12:36.484 --> 02:12:43.006]  Throughout its history, the Citadel has maintained a tradition of duty, pride, and excellence as part of the cadet experience.
[02:12:43.567 --> 02:12:49.309]  Please welcome, from Charleston, South Carolina, the Citadel Regimental Bag, Pipes, and Bands.
[02:13:38.175 --> 02:13:40.850]  These 61 members are first-class senior cadets.
[02:13:49.690 --> 02:13:55.911]  And this equestrian unit is the 1st Cavalry Division's Horse Cavalry Detachment from Fort Hood, Texas.
[02:13:56.411 --> 02:14:01.472]  A special ceremonial unit for the Department of the Army, founded in 1972.
[02:14:02.052 --> 02:14:14.755]  Comprised of active duty soldiers, the unit has performed in ceremonies across the country, including 13 Tournament of Roses parades and 5 inaugural parades.
[02:14:17.964 --> 02:14:23.347]  Now the Olivet Nazarene University Tiger Marching Band from Corbinaze, Illinois.
[02:14:33.492 --> 02:14:37.794]  This unit was the lead band in the 2016 London New Year's Day Parade.
[02:15:21.695 --> 02:15:22.456]  And welcome back.
[02:15:22.496 --> 02:15:27.657]  You are watching InfoWars' 14-hour live coverage of the presidential inauguration.
[02:15:27.837 --> 02:15:31.978]  Donald Trump is officially the 45th president of the United States.
[02:15:32.058 --> 02:15:35.759]  Those pesky protesters did not get their resistance.
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:36.780]  It did not work.
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:40.441]  Darren McBreen, I mean, what an incredible day.
[02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:42.222]  How do you feel?
[02:15:42.322 --> 02:15:45.084]  To me it feels like election night all over again.
[02:15:45.124 --> 02:15:48.126]  So it gives us an opportunity to celebrate it all over again.
[02:15:48.367 --> 02:15:56.753]  And we have an administration that's eager to basically do an about face on all of Obama's policies.
[02:15:57.273 --> 02:16:01.196]  And I'm looking forward to the White House Press Club.
[02:16:01.997 --> 02:16:03.498]  Or the Press Corps, that's what they call it.
[02:16:03.658 --> 02:16:07.723]  That's going to change big time because for the first time we're going to have independent media in it.
[02:16:08.043 --> 02:16:11.727]  Like I always imagine, Leanne McAdoo, Mr. President, I have a question?
[02:16:11.787 --> 02:16:13.829]  Yes, Leanne McAdoo, Infowars.com, I have a question.
[02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:21.698]  So that's going to be a reality in the near future and there's a new sheriff in town and the globalists are not too happy.
[02:16:21.818 --> 02:16:24.359]  Yes, actually as 1159 a.m.
[02:16:24.579 --> 02:16:30.081]  Eastern, the new sheriff in town, evidence of the regime change on the White House website.
[02:16:30.281 --> 02:16:36.282]  All references to climate change have been deleted from the White House website today at noon.
[02:16:36.823 --> 02:16:44.125]  The official White House website had a very lengthy information page about the threat of climate change and the steps the federal government had taken to fight it.
[02:16:44.225 --> 02:16:51.207]  At noon, at the instant Donald Trump took office, the page was gone, as well as any mention of climate change or global warming.
[02:16:51.587 --> 02:17:00.190]  So it's going to be very interesting how we're going to be kind of undoing all of the agenda, this progressive agenda that has been really shoved down our throats for the last eight years.
[02:17:00.890 --> 02:17:03.571]  And I see we've got our guys there on the ground.
[02:17:03.591 --> 02:17:04.211]  There they are.
[02:17:04.811 --> 02:17:09.233]  Rob Dew and Owen Schroyer, of course, have been right there with the Goblins.
[02:17:09.653 --> 02:17:12.854]  Guys, how deep did you get with the Goblins?
[02:17:12.914 --> 02:17:16.055]  Just, you know, wading through knee deep?
[02:17:16.115 --> 02:17:16.335]  Knee deep.
[02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.496]  You didn't get in bed with the Goblins, did you?
[02:17:19.355 --> 02:17:21.637]  He might have, I didn't.
[02:17:21.817 --> 02:17:28.381]  I've got some videos that I haven't uploaded yet that I'm going to upload tonight where I'm pretty much right in the belly of the beast with the goblins.
[02:17:29.182 --> 02:17:37.688]  And I think Kit Daniel actually took a video, I don't know if he put it up yet, but we're standing on the road and the whole protest is literally marching right at me.
[02:17:37.708 --> 02:17:39.970]  So I'm standing right in front of them.
[02:17:40.350 --> 02:17:41.731]  I wish I could have had my bullhorn.
[02:17:42.091 --> 02:17:44.473]  But we were able to talk to a couple of those protesters.
[02:17:44.633 --> 02:17:47.075]  But no, honestly, they were pretty weak, I would say.
[02:17:47.435 --> 02:17:48.736]  Oh, and I have a little story.
[02:17:49.156 --> 02:17:52.359]  Me and Josh were walking by and I go, oh my God, look, it's the Anarchists.
[02:17:52.459 --> 02:17:53.820]  And there are the Black Bok Anarchists.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:57.842]  There's probably eight or nine of them with a female trailing behind.
[02:17:57.882 --> 02:18:00.564]  But I guess they were all other males because they all had their faces covered.
[02:18:00.845 --> 02:18:02.606]  And they had their big flags and they're walking.
[02:18:03.166 --> 02:18:04.507]  And I stop and film them.
[02:18:04.627 --> 02:18:09.671]  And then as they walk by me, I go, ah, I guess, I say something like, I guess you guys didn't stop the inauguration.
[02:18:12.463 --> 02:18:21.031]  And the guy turned around like he was going to come fight me, and he stopped short because I just stood there, and I had the Warhammer, which... Bring the Warhammer over here, let's give him some screen time.
[02:18:21.071 --> 02:18:23.633]  You're giving the Warhammer a little love?
[02:18:23.653 --> 02:18:25.295]  Hey, grab him by the Warhammer.
[02:18:25.415 --> 02:18:25.915]  Exactly.
[02:18:26.656 --> 02:18:29.438]  And I was holding this in my hand.
[02:18:29.458 --> 02:18:30.900]  Right here is the Warhammer.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:41.944]  It's got a light on it, this thing which tells time, and a shotgun mic, and an InfoWars mic, and it holds a couple iPhones, and it's pretty badass.
[02:18:42.004 --> 02:18:44.264]  And it can also choke people with it.
[02:18:44.344 --> 02:18:45.345]  It looks like a transformer.
[02:18:45.365 --> 02:18:47.646]  We're looking to install the rape whistle on here soon.
[02:18:48.786 --> 02:18:50.887]  But I just stood there and he stopped short and goes...
[02:18:51.807 --> 02:18:54.069]  Alex Jones is really Bill Hicks!
[02:19:09.102 --> 02:19:09.342]  No!
[02:19:09.562 --> 02:19:10.663]  The frogs are doing it!
[02:19:10.723 --> 02:19:11.663]  The frogs are doing it!
[02:19:11.683 --> 02:19:12.583]  It like runs off.
[02:19:12.923 --> 02:19:14.304]  And it's like these people have nothing.
[02:19:14.664 --> 02:19:16.144]  It was very strange behavior.
[02:19:16.324 --> 02:19:16.705]  Here's the thing.
[02:19:16.725 --> 02:19:26.068]  They were attacking women earlier today that were trying to get into the parade route and Alex saw this happening and he actually had to be removed by the police.
[02:19:26.088 --> 02:19:30.189]  They were moved into another safe area because he was about to attack these people who were going after women.
[02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:41.276]  So, and these are the same people that were, you know, they cover their faces, they wear all black, they pretend to be anarchists, but really they're paid socialists, and they're probably trust fund kids as well.
[02:19:43.314 --> 02:19:44.415]  He saw them attacking women.
[02:19:44.455 --> 02:19:45.336]  Women were coming out bloody.
[02:19:45.537 --> 02:19:47.399]  We interviewed two of them during the last Facebook Mentions.
[02:19:47.739 --> 02:19:48.600]  They came on.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.763]  One lady was so distraught about it, she wouldn't even show her face.
[02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:54.667]  She turned her back to the camera and told her story of how she was attacked.
[02:19:54.867 --> 02:19:55.147]  Wow.
[02:19:55.367 --> 02:19:56.328]  And this is serious.
[02:19:56.388 --> 02:19:58.991]  I mean, these are men attacking women.
[02:19:59.352 --> 02:20:01.314]  That's how weak these people are.
[02:20:01.374 --> 02:20:02.996]  That just shows you what cowards they are.
[02:20:03.476 --> 02:20:07.541]  Yeah, and it's just me and Josh and there was like eight of them.
[02:20:08.261 --> 02:20:09.643]  All right, but we probably could have taken them.
[02:20:11.145 --> 02:20:11.825]  I was ready.
[02:20:12.306 --> 02:20:20.956]  I like the names they come up with because one of the names that was at the Deplora Ball last night, an anti-Trump group, the DC Anti-Fascist Coalition.
[02:20:21.236 --> 02:20:23.719]  Yeah, there's a lot of anti-fascist coalitions out here.
[02:20:24.179 --> 02:20:24.680]  Beating women.
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:27.604]  Ignorantly believe that Donald Trump is some kind of fascist.
[02:20:27.624 --> 02:20:32.751]  This morning they were calling me a Nazi, and yet they have a sign that says socialism.
[02:20:33.151 --> 02:20:37.658]  And they don't understand that the Nazi party was the National Socialist Party.
[02:20:38.058 --> 02:20:39.280]  They just don't understand that.
[02:20:39.625 --> 02:20:45.449]  Hey, I know you guys have got Airbnb there, but are you staying, like, what is this Secret Society artwork behind you guys?
[02:20:46.209 --> 02:20:47.390]  Ah, I'm glad you asked.
[02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:48.471]  You're not allowed to know.
[02:20:48.511 --> 02:20:52.573]  If you look right here, it's the Rosicrucian seal right there.
[02:20:52.593 --> 02:20:53.474]  Subliminal messaging.
[02:20:53.534 --> 02:20:56.796]  Actually, this was the artwork in the place that we rented.
[02:20:57.657 --> 02:21:00.280]  There was a big mirror here and we took that off because it looked weird.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.963]  That's actually the Trump lion right there.
[02:21:03.003 --> 02:21:04.385]  That's the Trump lion that you're seeing.
[02:21:04.425 --> 02:21:06.247]  So we grabbed some artwork and put it up.
[02:21:06.607 --> 02:21:07.288]  You grabbed him what?
[02:21:07.328 --> 02:21:08.329]  Oh, just artwork, okay.
[02:21:08.349 --> 02:21:12.714]  But let me tell you, it was quite a day today just seeing
[02:21:14.361 --> 02:21:15.462]  The lack of protesters.
[02:21:15.502 --> 02:21:16.622]  There was one little section of protesters.
[02:21:16.642 --> 02:21:17.223]  Yeah, we outnumbered them.
[02:21:17.343 --> 02:21:18.203]  I was guessing 5 to 1.
[02:21:18.363 --> 02:21:19.164]  I'd say 10 to 1.
[02:21:19.364 --> 02:21:19.584]  Yeah.
[02:21:19.664 --> 02:21:25.827]  Well, if you watch the mainstream news media, it looks like it's just being infiltrated by protesters everywhere.
[02:21:25.847 --> 02:21:27.408]  Well, I could understand that, I guess.
[02:21:27.528 --> 02:21:28.929]  They're essentially doing what
[02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:34.050]  You know, we want to do, which is go film the YouTube gold or the TV gold of these ignorant protesters.
[02:21:34.350 --> 02:21:37.411]  They do it for a different reason, but, you know, obviously that's the goal.
[02:21:37.431 --> 02:21:43.312]  So, of course, someone who's watching it on TV is going to have that experience when that's all they're looking for.
[02:21:43.352 --> 02:21:48.093]  But the Trump supporters, I mean, there's probably 20,000, 30,000 watching the parade.
[02:21:48.113 --> 02:21:50.654]  There's probably 20,000, 30,000 at the Washington Memorial.
[02:21:51.094 --> 02:21:51.494]  That's right.
[02:21:51.514 --> 02:21:52.474]  Another 20,000 at the Lincoln Memorial.
[02:21:52.534 --> 02:21:53.375]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[02:21:53.615 --> 02:21:55.435]  They're literally just all over the streets.
[02:21:55.615 --> 02:22:09.039]  Let me ask you this, when the campaign first started, and we'd go to these Trump events, and then there would be the anti-Trump agitators outside, they would see our InfoWars sticker on our microphones, and they would get triggered.
[02:22:09.379 --> 02:22:13.881]  But it seemed like the more the campaign went on, the more they would recognize it.
[02:22:13.961 --> 02:22:21.383]  And now it seems like everyone out there that's protesting Trump, as soon as they see that InfoWars on the microphone, do they get triggered immediately?
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.160]  They run away.
[02:22:24.001 --> 02:22:25.081]  They are afraid to debate.
[02:22:25.701 --> 02:22:43.530]  I was debating some people this morning and they were being told, the one white guy, and I'm not even being racist, but it felt really weird and racist when we were trying to interview and talk to these people and there was, I guess, the leader and he was black and he was telling the white people not to talk.
[02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:45.030]  He's a Democratic leader.
[02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:46.411]  Don't engage, don't engage.
[02:22:46.451 --> 02:22:47.752]  Yeah, Democratic leader.
[02:22:48.812 --> 02:22:51.374]  And, um, but, yeah, these were even socialists.
[02:22:51.414 --> 02:22:52.294]  They weren't even Democrats.
[02:22:52.314 --> 02:22:54.476]  They were, these were total socialists, communists.
[02:22:55.136 --> 02:23:00.640]  And, you know, you get to, you go, wow, you know, communism's killed, what, 100, 200 million people in the last century?
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:02.922]  And, you know, what are you gonna do?
[02:23:02.942 --> 02:23:04.383]  I go, what are you gonna do for your final solution?
[02:23:04.403 --> 02:23:07.264]  They go, oh, you're trying to bait us into a Nazi thing.
[02:23:07.304 --> 02:23:15.730]  No, your final solution is you want to kill people to take over the memes of production, which, uh, we're not gonna allow that to happen, unfortunately.
[02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:18.392]  And I said, I go, what are you gonna do when you get a job?
[02:23:19.653 --> 02:23:21.834]  I would say my experience as far as the InfoWars Mike Flagg is
[02:23:34.437 --> 02:23:40.044]  Either they see it, and they just immediately flick me off, pretty much, or say, F you, F Alex Jones, or whatever.
[02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:41.686]  Or I heard a lot of chemtrails.
[02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.188]  I got a lot of chemtrails today.
[02:23:43.208 --> 02:23:50.698]  Because they're really upset that their fake climate change stories, anthropogenic climate change things, are falling to the wayside now.
[02:23:51.078 --> 02:24:17.947]  So they either flick me off, say F Alex Jones, or, but what I also notice now, and this didn't used to happen to me as much, I think that they're catching on, like kind of what you were referencing there Darren, I think they're starting to catch on because now, when there's groups of them, someone will point me out, someone will point that out, and they'll send over a bunch of goons to kind of like try to, basically they just surround me, they just try to meat wall me, like the bikers for Trump.
[02:24:18.587 --> 02:24:19.208]  Uh, we're gonna do.
[02:24:19.708 --> 02:24:21.290]  And actually, I just put that video up.
[02:24:21.490 --> 02:24:24.212]  It went up earlier and it got, uh, it got, it got distorted.
[02:24:24.232 --> 02:24:25.773]  So I'm gonna see if that video went up cleanly.
[02:24:25.874 --> 02:24:29.517]  And I'll just tell you guys, this was, this may have been my best moment of the trip.
[02:24:29.677 --> 02:24:30.738]  It was, it was tough out there.
[02:24:30.778 --> 02:24:31.959]  The protesters were pretty weak.
[02:24:32.639 --> 02:24:34.081]  But I'm trying to get this video up right now.
[02:24:34.581 --> 02:24:35.382]  There was a protest.
[02:24:35.422 --> 02:24:36.503]  They were blocking the gates.
[02:24:36.903 --> 02:24:41.887]  So when they try to say that there weren't very many people in the inauguration, that's because these protesters were literally blocking the gates.
[02:24:41.927 --> 02:24:42.307]  Exactly.
[02:24:42.327 --> 02:24:43.808]  They were stuffed up in the entrance.
[02:24:44.029 --> 02:24:47.752]  And look, we obviously want Trump safe and everyone safe here, but I won't go off on it.
[02:24:47.772 --> 02:24:51.054]  But the security here, they need to figure something out because it's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:24:51.314 --> 02:24:55.538]  But anyway, they're sitting here and they're blocking this entrance and they're having their little protest.
[02:24:56.358 --> 02:25:05.266]  And the leader of it, this little goblin, decides that she's going to hold a moment of silence in solidarity to protest Donald Trump.
[02:25:05.786 --> 02:25:07.648]  So, of course, they had their little moment of silence.
[02:25:07.688 --> 02:25:08.529]  What do you think I did?
[02:25:09.149 --> 02:25:12.212]  I screamed out, Make America Great Again at the top of my lungs.
[02:25:12.632 --> 02:25:14.333]  And then immediately they all freaked out.
[02:25:14.553 --> 02:25:16.915]  They sent over a meatball to try to block me off.
[02:25:17.415 --> 02:25:20.017]  And I ended up engaging in a conversation with a few of them.
[02:25:20.037 --> 02:25:21.538]  So I'm going to try to get that clean video up.
[02:25:21.578 --> 02:25:24.180]  But yeah, for the most part, if they see us, they either run.
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.501]  There was actually one woman.
[02:25:25.521 --> 02:25:26.721]  I'm going to put this video up too.
[02:25:27.702 --> 02:25:28.443]  This is wild.
[02:25:29.064 --> 02:25:34.290]  I'm coming up, these women, everyone's taking a picture of these two young girls because they have their anti-Trump sign, okay?
[02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:38.474]  I come over, I'm like, hey, I'm with the media, can I get an interview, we'll talk about your sign?
[02:25:39.095 --> 02:25:44.882]  The two young girls knew who I was, knew about InfoWars and said, oh, sorry, we won't talk to InfoWars, we're not talking InfoWars.
[02:25:45.422 --> 02:25:46.343]  Makes sense to me.
[02:26:07.159 --> 02:26:08.740]  Why won't you stand in front of the camera?
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.361]  Why won't you actually voice these issues?
[02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:12.442]  And of course they know why, because they'll be shut down.
[02:26:12.742 --> 02:26:14.103]  And then she ultimately talked to me.
[02:26:14.183 --> 02:26:18.125]  And of course we disagreed on just about every political issue, but we had the conversation.
[02:26:18.485 --> 02:26:19.625]  And that's what she said to these girls.
[02:26:19.665 --> 02:26:31.712]  And at the end I was like, look, we're going to disagree, but it's totally hypocritical to come out here as a protester, hold up a sign because you want to be seen, you want to be heard, you think that these are the real issues, and then when there's somebody there
[02:26:32.572 --> 02:26:38.483]  Giving you a platform, giving you essentially an amplified voice, you want to turn away and hide.
[02:26:38.563 --> 02:26:39.925]  And we know the reason why is because...
[02:26:41.024 --> 02:26:46.710]  The dynamic of us amplifying their voice is kind of an illusion because they know that their voice is fake.
[02:26:46.970 --> 02:26:48.111]  They know that they're a fraud.
[02:26:48.572 --> 02:26:52.455]  And our voice is the voice of truth, and we just, pun intended, we trump them.
[02:26:52.816 --> 02:26:54.998]  Well, and they're also afraid to be told no.
[02:26:55.498 --> 02:26:59.122]  They don't want to, they don't want you to contradict their held belief.
[02:26:59.623 --> 02:27:00.503]  Their fake reality.
[02:27:00.684 --> 02:27:01.204]  Exactly.
[02:27:01.264 --> 02:27:03.026]  And then when you do, go ahead, go ahead, Lance.
[02:27:03.046 --> 02:27:04.346]  Well, what's going to happen with them?
[02:27:04.546 --> 02:27:11.248]  I mean, we were just talking about they removed all information about the climate change on their website.
[02:27:11.268 --> 02:27:11.808]  They're very tricky.
[02:27:11.888 --> 02:27:17.589]  What are they going to do when their entire narrative that they've based their existence around, it's totally crumbled?
[02:27:17.749 --> 02:27:20.449]  If everybody has air conditioning, the whole world's going to boil over.
[02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:21.290]  And that's the thing.
[02:27:21.610 --> 02:27:28.191]  Donald Trump, he could bypass the media altogether by going straight to Twitter, going to social media and independent media.
[02:27:28.211 --> 02:27:31.612]  So the mainstream media is in big trouble.
[02:27:31.832 --> 02:27:32.692]  Establishment media.
[02:27:33.092 --> 02:27:43.077]  I just, I just find it odd these people, they've been proven wrong time and time again and they're gonna, they're gonna staunchly, this is gonna be their new thing I think, is with the whole climate change.
[02:27:43.097 --> 02:27:49.179]  They're gonna say Donald Trump wants to kill the planet or whatever, you know, because he doesn't want to say climate change.
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:50.680]  So I think that that's the new thing.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:52.641]  Trump, planet killer, doesn't believe in climate change.
[02:27:52.661 --> 02:27:55.122]  And so they're gonna, they're gonna cling on to this thing.
[02:27:55.142 --> 02:27:56.443]  This is gonna be like the new thing.
[02:27:56.463 --> 02:27:58.584]  They might even start spinning it in the media too.
[02:27:59.064 --> 02:28:00.445]  And it's just the most ridiculous thing.
[02:28:01.785 --> 02:28:03.506]  How much more evidence do we need?
[02:28:03.606 --> 02:28:05.307]  It's not even debatable!
[02:28:05.707 --> 02:28:06.867]  Chemtrails are real!
[02:28:07.467 --> 02:28:07.928]  They're real!
[02:28:07.948 --> 02:28:08.748]  This isn't a debate!
[02:28:08.788 --> 02:28:10.329]  The argument is over!
[02:28:10.489 --> 02:28:11.669]  Geoengineering!
[02:28:11.769 --> 02:28:12.229]  It's over!
[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:21.233]  I've been kind of in the chair most of the day, so I haven't really been able to see how the media... How do you think they're going to deconstruct the speech that he gave today?
[02:28:21.253 --> 02:28:22.213]  It was very inclusive.
[02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:23.073]  How can they spin it?
[02:28:24.797 --> 02:28:34.563]  All you have to do is take and look at how many times Obama mentioned his name in the speech, his farewell speech, and then I think it was like 75 times.
[02:28:34.643 --> 02:28:36.644]  And Donald Trump, I think, mentioned his name three?
[02:28:36.844 --> 02:28:37.284]  Exactly.
[02:28:37.464 --> 02:28:39.986]  And I actually, I was more about we, inclusive.
[02:28:40.066 --> 02:28:41.306]  And he goes, for all Americans.
[02:28:41.326 --> 02:28:43.027]  It's going to be great for all Americans.
[02:28:43.227 --> 02:28:43.768]  Everybody.
[02:28:44.228 --> 02:28:45.729]  And what we, well, this is what I found.
[02:28:46.569 --> 02:28:49.091]  The people that are coming up to Alex Jones, most of them are minorities.
[02:28:50.103 --> 02:28:54.486]  They're either immigrants, or they're Hispanic, or they're black.
[02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:58.168]  And those are the ones who come up fervently wanting to talk.
[02:28:58.588 --> 02:29:00.089]  Like, they're not just, hey Alex, hey Alex.
[02:29:00.189 --> 02:29:03.331]  Those are the ones who are like, damn it, man, I'm glad somebody's speaking out.
[02:29:03.391 --> 02:29:04.012]  I'm glad.
[02:29:04.372 --> 02:29:05.473]  And it's been amazing.
[02:29:05.513 --> 02:29:11.836]  Like, you know, I've been around here for a while, and I've seen people come up to Alex and stuff, and this time it's been different.
[02:29:11.917 --> 02:29:15.339]  It's more of a real love.
[02:29:15.399 --> 02:29:18.781]  Like, oh my God, this one kid goes, you're my hero, and gave him a big hug.
[02:29:19.201 --> 02:29:20.972]  You know, and this was like a 15 year old kid.
[02:29:22.415 --> 02:29:30.601]  And that's the effect, you know, Alex definitely has a big effect, probably more than all of us put together, but we're also amplifying that as well.
[02:29:30.641 --> 02:29:34.703]  We're there on the sides being auxiliary boosters to what he's doing.
[02:29:34.743 --> 02:29:37.925]  And just making our umbrella bigger, just having more presence out here.
[02:29:37.945 --> 02:29:42.989]  And that goes for our listeners too, and the followers of InfoWarriors, our fellow InfoWarriors.
[02:29:43.009 --> 02:29:46.671]  I don't know how many times we get, you know, I don't want to call them fans, they're InfoWarriors.
[02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:50.294]  They send us information, very, very good stuff that we share.
[02:29:50.734 --> 02:29:53.135]  This is an army of information out there.
[02:29:53.235 --> 02:29:54.816]  I've met so many great people out here.
[02:29:54.976 --> 02:30:00.618]  I've actually met people that may even end up doing interviews with us because they're very bright people, intelligent people.
[02:30:00.678 --> 02:30:02.379]  I've met people that have provided me with insight.
[02:30:03.079 --> 02:30:11.943]  I can just say what you were saying about the trust fund babies being these protesters, that's confirmed from within Project Veritas, so I'll just leave it at that.
[02:30:13.483 --> 02:30:14.604]  It's not hard to figure out.
[02:30:14.664 --> 02:30:16.925]  But when you talk, when we're talking about
[02:30:18.875 --> 02:30:20.530]  All the fans that we're seeing.
[02:30:21.502 --> 02:30:22.022]  There was one.
[02:30:22.042 --> 02:30:23.083]  I actually tweeted this out.
[02:30:23.103 --> 02:30:24.224]  There were these two ladies.
[02:30:24.744 --> 02:30:28.346]  It was a Latino woman and she had Latina for Trump on and it was a black woman.
[02:30:28.767 --> 02:30:31.188]  And they recognized me and they come up to me and they're like, oh, we want to take a picture.
[02:30:31.208 --> 02:30:31.828]  We want to take a picture.
[02:30:32.289 --> 02:30:33.089]  And so we take the picture.
[02:30:33.109 --> 02:30:33.670]  It's a good picture.
[02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:35.831]  And she's like, she's like, you've got to tweet this out.
[02:30:36.051 --> 02:30:37.692]  They can't call you racist anymore.
[02:30:37.912 --> 02:30:39.013]  They can't call you racist.
[02:30:39.073 --> 02:30:41.835]  I'm like, they're going to call me racist first thing when they see this picture.
[02:30:41.855 --> 02:30:44.336]  They're going to say, oh, he did that so he won't call him racist.
[02:30:44.496 --> 02:30:45.797]  So I tweeted out the picture.
[02:30:45.877 --> 02:30:47.178]  I called myself a racist.
[02:30:47.298 --> 02:30:47.858]  And there you go.
[02:30:47.878 --> 02:30:48.659]  A racist.
[02:30:49.139 --> 02:30:52.861]  But it really is, and you know what it is, I think, Rob?
[02:30:53.342 --> 02:30:58.085]  I think that there's a feeling of solidarity here with all the Trump people.
[02:30:58.105 --> 02:31:00.346]  I mean, we really have occupied D.C.
[02:31:00.726 --> 02:31:06.050]  Guys, for those of you listening that haven't seen the footage, I mean, I'll try to paint the picture for you.
[02:31:06.670 --> 02:31:11.272]  You're walking down the street and every other person is wearing a Make America Great Again hat on.
[02:31:11.532 --> 02:31:16.294]  You're walking down the street and every other person has some presidential Trump gear on.
[02:31:17.095 --> 02:31:19.516]  It's like we're in Trumpville, America.
[02:31:19.736 --> 02:31:21.137]  It's wild.
[02:31:21.337 --> 02:31:23.638]  And every fifth person is an InfoWars fan.
[02:31:23.718 --> 02:31:23.958]  Yeah.
[02:31:24.378 --> 02:31:39.431]  I'd love to point out right now how CNN's homepage has the inauguration of Donald Trump, hail to the chief.
[02:31:40.132 --> 02:31:44.115]  So in one respect, they're kind of saying, okay, it's time to kiss the ring.
[02:31:44.255 --> 02:31:47.038]  But on the other hand, they're saying, oh, we just elected an emperor.
[02:31:47.098 --> 02:31:47.578]  We're done.
[02:31:47.658 --> 02:31:49.760]  So it's, it's, they're, they're never going to stop.
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:50.841]  What's the image look like?
[02:31:51.241 --> 02:31:53.547]  It's just all the kind of the rolling tweets.
[02:31:53.567 --> 02:31:55.873]  They don't have his image up there, but it's just right there.
[02:31:55.973 --> 02:31:56.534]  Bold print.
[02:31:56.635 --> 02:31:57.497]  Hail to the chief.
[02:31:57.777 --> 02:31:58.198]  Here he is.
[02:31:58.218 --> 02:31:58.599]  The tweet.
[02:31:59.485 --> 02:32:00.206]  We've elected him.
[02:32:00.246 --> 02:32:00.986]  The tweets!
[02:32:01.026 --> 02:32:01.667]  The tweets!
[02:32:02.007 --> 02:32:05.210]  We were talking earlier about how this is a celebration day as well.
[02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:06.651]  Inauguration day is a celebration day.
[02:32:07.052 --> 02:32:09.233]  And Donald Trump, this is not just about Donald Trump.
[02:32:09.273 --> 02:32:12.736]  This is about the American people invading Washington D.C.
[02:32:12.776 --> 02:32:14.198]  and taking our country back.
[02:32:14.638 --> 02:32:19.022]  This is, you know, the globalists, they're going to have a tough time after this.
[02:32:19.522 --> 02:32:20.223]  This changes everything.
[02:32:21.664 --> 02:32:22.045]  I don't know.
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:37.940]  I don't
[02:32:55.985 --> 02:32:56.866]  That's a stark difference.
[02:32:56.886 --> 02:32:57.687]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:32:57.787 --> 02:32:59.368]  Donald Trump is thinking about this.
[02:32:59.849 --> 02:33:01.210]  He's not thinking about himself.
[02:33:01.771 --> 02:33:07.656]  He's already in the mindset that he knows that the American people put him in power.
[02:33:07.776 --> 02:33:09.278]  He knows how he got into power.
[02:33:09.298 --> 02:33:10.639]  With Obama, it's all about me, me, me.
[02:33:10.679 --> 02:33:11.280]  It's a mindset.
[02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:14.362]  With Trump, it's like we, we, we, because he knows who put him in power.
[02:33:15.083 --> 02:33:20.244]  During that speech, I'm sorry, I was going to say, during that speech though, I didn't see any teleprompters?
[02:33:20.324 --> 02:33:21.404]  I didn't see any notes?
[02:33:21.544 --> 02:33:26.045]  Well there were teleprompters up, they just had the camera, they had the camera really tightly zoomed in.
[02:33:26.185 --> 02:33:28.766]  So I know someone had to have written that speech.
[02:33:28.986 --> 02:33:32.767]  Well yeah, he did and he also, I forget who his, it was Stephen Miller or something?
[02:33:32.787 --> 02:33:33.747]  There was pictures of him.
[02:33:33.787 --> 02:33:38.228]  I tell you what, it was one of the greatest speeches, it's JFK level inauguration
[02:33:38.268 --> 02:33:39.449]  They were memeing his photo.
[02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:41.691]  There was a photo of him and it became this big viral meme.
[02:33:42.111 --> 02:33:44.233]  People saying all sorts of stuff with him writing a speech.
[02:33:44.273 --> 02:33:46.775]  But yeah, I wish I could say that it was teleprompter.
[02:33:46.855 --> 02:33:48.216]  It seemed like it was really.
[02:33:48.236 --> 02:33:49.357]  He sure read it like it was.
[02:33:49.438 --> 02:33:50.979]  Totally came from the heart there, yeah.
[02:33:51.339 --> 02:33:51.860]  It was awesome.
[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:53.401]  Only we are teleprompter.
[02:33:53.817 --> 02:33:54.318]  That's right.
[02:33:55.178 --> 02:33:56.400]  No teleprompters allowed.
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:57.201]  You get shut down.
[02:33:57.961 --> 02:34:05.129]  Well, and I think a lot of this shows that what we're talking about is the majority.
[02:34:05.449 --> 02:34:06.310]  We're not the minority.
[02:34:06.350 --> 02:34:07.592]  We're not the silent minority.
[02:34:07.852 --> 02:34:09.333]  We're not the silent majority.
[02:34:09.414 --> 02:34:11.536]  We are the vocal majority now.
[02:34:12.016 --> 02:34:12.997]  We're able to take
[02:34:14.779 --> 02:34:30.947]  The news that comes out and analyze it and show people where it's fake and people are able to see that and it goes and goes and goes and everybody else sees it and they share it with their friends and we really have transcended the paradigm I think at this point to where you know it's not about
[02:34:31.894 --> 02:34:34.536]  We spent a lot of time talking about Trump the last two years.
[02:34:35.476 --> 02:34:36.797]  And we're still going to be talking about Trump.
[02:34:37.337 --> 02:34:45.302]  But now's the time where we have that audience and we can start putting out that information, that evergreen information that everybody can use in their everyday life.
[02:34:45.722 --> 02:34:54.107]  Whether it's driverless cars or vaccines or glyphosates or, you know, the nutraceuticals we provide.
[02:34:54.167 --> 02:34:55.528]  Because all that stuff that
[02:34:56.758 --> 02:34:57.978]  That's what we do at InfoWars.
[02:34:58.258 --> 02:34:59.939]  It's all about making us better.
[02:35:00.719 --> 02:35:03.700]  It's not about sitting back and waiting for stuff to happen.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.461]  It's all about what can we do to do stuff better?
[02:35:05.721 --> 02:35:10.482]  You know, it's like fine tuning a hot rod, you know, and that's the stage right now.
[02:35:10.542 --> 02:35:11.403]  We have the hot rod.
[02:35:11.723 --> 02:35:21.546]  Now we're going to fine tune it and make it run, you know, 100 miles to the gallon on gas and run 300 miles an hour when we want to and stop on a dive and take curves and.
[02:35:22.646 --> 02:35:35.281]  We can really like blossom into the next level where you know we're up there with Daily Caller and we're up there with Breitbart and I think we're in some ways we're more popular than those places but in some ways we aren't.
[02:35:35.521 --> 02:35:35.741]  Yeah.
[02:35:36.021 --> 02:35:40.446]  And but I think now's the time looking at this supporting Trump
[02:35:41.368 --> 02:35:42.729]  And putting all that information out there.
[02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:46.293]  But also putting out more information that people can use in their everyday lives.
[02:35:46.373 --> 02:35:51.138]  That's where I think we need to go and really start working on that now that we've got Trump in office.
[02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:55.042]  Because it was, I tell you, it was a lot of, hold your breath, he's not in yet.
[02:35:55.142 --> 02:35:59.046]  I still thought he was going to be a sniper on the roof today as well.
[02:35:59.386 --> 02:36:03.309]  Let me tell you, just looking out our window out here, there were snipers all over the place.
[02:36:03.329 --> 02:36:05.171]  The security here is so ridiculous.
[02:36:05.231 --> 02:36:06.712]  I mean, it's just, it's honestly absurd.
[02:36:06.732 --> 02:36:15.959]  But you know, part of the thing I think that when you talk about making yourself better, making everyone around you better, part of that is, you know, having conversations, even when you disagree.
[02:36:15.979 --> 02:36:16.540]  Oh yeah.
[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:20.783]  Having that debate, finding common ground, you know, finding compromise.
[02:36:21.144 --> 02:36:24.186]  You know, making, the creation of this country was not easy.
[02:36:24.626 --> 02:36:24.907]  Okay?
[02:36:24.927 --> 02:36:28.690]  Some of those guys fought tooth and nail and still didn't get their way.
[02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:33.295]  But at the end of the day, here we are in America, and we got a chance to make this the greatest country in the world, I think.
[02:36:33.516 --> 02:36:33.836]  Again!
[02:36:33.856 --> 02:36:37.140]  And the thing that's also so wonderful is that we have a president now who is...
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:44.246]  Ask these questions as well, and he is appointing people like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:36:44.546 --> 02:36:49.992]  to run this with the vaccines or a climate change denier to head up the EPA.
[02:36:50.092 --> 02:36:57.920]  And here's the issue that I have, is that we're willing to ask these questions, we're willing to go down these dark paths, we're willing to find the truth.
[02:36:59.481 --> 02:37:02.883]  And we're willing to have conversations about it, even if it's not comfortable.
[02:37:03.464 --> 02:37:05.605]  But these protesters and the left are not.
[02:37:05.965 --> 02:37:08.347]  They are completely left out to dry on this.
[02:37:08.407 --> 02:37:11.389]  We cannot, we cannot grow with these people.
[02:37:11.769 --> 02:37:14.691]  And it was just really illustrated to me again today.
[02:37:14.711 --> 02:37:16.833]  I can't grow with you, man.
[02:37:17.173 --> 02:37:18.534]  You can't, you won't talk to me.
[02:37:18.594 --> 02:37:19.955]  You won't accept reality.
[02:37:19.995 --> 02:37:20.915]  You just hate me.
[02:37:20.935 --> 02:37:24.678]  And there's no, there's no even possibility of growth.
[02:37:24.978 --> 02:37:28.601]  If people are watching this morning, I was on with Paul Joseph Watson about 8.30.
[02:37:30.622 --> 02:37:38.906]  And these people were, 830 Central, these people were flipping off the camera, putting their fingers in front of the camera, screaming.
[02:37:39.086 --> 02:37:41.727]  They loved hitting you with their sign, like, accidentally.
[02:37:41.807 --> 02:37:44.929]  Bumping into you, forming their... Yeah, I'm sure that was an accident, dude.
[02:37:44.949 --> 02:37:45.849]  Well, they had training.
[02:37:45.909 --> 02:37:49.151]  How can you get just past illegal without getting arrested?
[02:37:49.451 --> 02:37:49.971]  Exactly.
[02:37:50.392 --> 02:37:54.394]  And, you know, instead of engaging, there was one guy at the end who started talking to us.
[02:37:55.375 --> 02:37:57.059]  And we came to agreements.
[02:37:57.099 --> 02:38:01.429]  We're like, look, Donald Trump is not going to be perfect, and he's probably going to do some things we don't like.
[02:38:03.646 --> 02:38:07.909]  This is a way better solution than what we were looking at with Hillary Clinton.
[02:38:08.169 --> 02:38:10.791]  Let me tell you, we would have driven straight off the cliff with Hillary Clinton.
[02:38:10.811 --> 02:38:11.471]  It would have been horrible.
[02:38:11.491 --> 02:38:21.358]  And then there'll be some times where you find one of those rare protesters who is willing to engage, and you start having conversations, and then they'll say something about Trump or one of his policies.
[02:38:21.398 --> 02:38:23.520]  For example, I've never been really a big wall guy.
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:25.201]  I'm a big border security guy.
[02:38:25.241 --> 02:38:26.562]  I think we need to secure the border.
[02:38:26.882 --> 02:38:30.284]  I think a wall is kind of archaic at this point, but I'm not anti-wall, pro-wall.
[02:38:30.304 --> 02:38:31.105]  We're gonna build a wall.
[02:38:31.965 --> 02:38:34.387]  The wall just got 10 feet higher, okay?
[02:38:34.847 --> 02:38:40.231]  But here's the thing, so he's like, wait, he's like, oh yeah, build a wall, racist, you know, Nazi.
[02:38:40.271 --> 02:38:42.213]  I'm like, actually, I'm not really a big fan of the wall.
[02:38:42.293 --> 02:38:43.053]  And he's like, whoa.
[02:38:43.353 --> 02:38:47.136]  He's like, wait, you don't just accept everything Donald Trump says?
[02:38:47.757 --> 02:38:49.098]  Oh my gosh, wait, what?
[02:38:49.118 --> 02:38:49.758]  Think for yourself.
[02:38:49.798 --> 02:38:50.899]  It was like a shocking moment.
[02:38:50.939 --> 02:38:52.640]  And actually, you know what's something amazing?
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.061]  Here's an amazing thing, too.
[02:38:55.482 --> 02:39:00.105]  In D.C., obviously most people recognize me from the Age Skrillex video, okay?
[02:39:00.165 --> 02:39:00.365]  Right?
[02:39:00.746 --> 02:39:01.726]  Everybody's seen that video.
[02:39:01.746 --> 02:39:02.647]  That's where I get recognized.
[02:39:02.687 --> 02:39:03.467]  What video is that?
[02:39:03.607 --> 02:39:06.669]  It's Age Skrillex, Carl the Cuck, you know, some video, I don't know.
[02:39:06.689 --> 02:39:07.870]  You're an effing white man.
[02:39:08.591 --> 02:39:09.331]  I own a mirror.
[02:39:09.431 --> 02:39:10.592]  I know I'm white, okay?
[02:39:10.652 --> 02:39:11.072]  I get it.
[02:39:11.412 --> 02:39:12.853]  And I had to hear it again in D.C.
[02:39:12.913 --> 02:39:13.594]  Are you kidding me?
[02:39:13.934 --> 02:39:14.975]  But get this.
[02:39:15.355 --> 02:39:16.696]  I'm not kidding you about this, though.
[02:39:16.816 --> 02:39:17.777]  Build a wall.
[02:39:17.977 --> 02:39:24.181]  In this trip, I actually think I got more people coming up to me saying they recognize me from the Van Jones video.
[02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:25.622]  I got a lot of views.
[02:39:25.962 --> 02:39:34.808]  And what they do is they came up to me and they said, hey, you know, the conversation that you had with Van Jones was awesome because you both had your points of view.
[02:39:35.189 --> 02:39:40.793]  You were able to eloquently try to inject your points of view into the conversation, keep it civil.
[02:39:41.413 --> 02:39:42.734]  And a lot of them were saying, you know,
[02:39:43.715 --> 02:39:51.560]  We saw you talking to Van Jones, and it just kind of opened their eyes that there is room for discussion here.
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:59.265]  Like, and a lot of them came up and they're like, it's weird because they see Van Jones in that video, but then they see him... It's not the Van Jones they get on TV.
[02:39:59.405 --> 02:40:00.486]  And that's the thing.
[02:40:00.546 --> 02:40:02.707]  And so then they start to question, why is that?
[02:40:02.727 --> 02:40:04.168]  What's the difference with TV?
[02:40:04.208 --> 02:40:05.809]  Like, so it's just, it's this weird road.
[02:40:05.829 --> 02:40:06.850]  Because he said some good stuff.
[02:40:07.210 --> 02:40:08.571]  He did, and we agreed on some stuff.
[02:40:08.591 --> 02:40:10.072]  His parents were police officers.
[02:40:10.152 --> 02:40:13.533]  I'm like, whoa, dude, you're very anti-police, and your parents were police officers.
[02:40:14.114 --> 02:40:17.055]  And you get a whole different perspective, and he's like, we've got to come together, we've got to talk.
[02:40:17.395 --> 02:40:19.476]  And then you see him on TV saying White Lash.
[02:40:19.997 --> 02:40:24.879]  Exactly, White Lash, and he's one of the people holding up the anti-Trump stuff with all the actors.
[02:40:25.119 --> 02:40:28.001]  The messy truth, and it doesn't come down to anything.
[02:40:28.301 --> 02:40:29.221]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:40:29.441 --> 02:40:31.602]  So hey, we're going to go to break pretty quickly here.
[02:40:31.943 --> 02:40:32.943]  You guys are going to take a break.
[02:40:32.983 --> 02:40:33.803]  You guys have been working.
[02:40:34.904 --> 02:40:37.406]  Oh, I mean, we've been working, too, but you guys have been on the air all day.
[02:40:37.586 --> 02:40:39.347]  You guys have some pretty golden tans there.
[02:40:39.427 --> 02:40:40.187]  Do we look tired?
[02:40:40.248 --> 02:40:41.268]  Hey, do we look tired at all?
[02:40:41.508 --> 02:40:42.549]  Who goes to D.C.
[02:40:42.609 --> 02:40:45.971]  in the cold and fog and gets a suntan?
[02:40:46.251 --> 02:40:47.332]  Hey, we left Austin.
[02:40:47.392 --> 02:40:50.854]  It rained for 39 straight days when we left Austin.
[02:40:51.014 --> 02:40:52.375]  So, yeah, we finally saw the sun.
[02:40:53.736 --> 02:40:54.377]  It's been good.
[02:40:54.757 --> 02:40:56.319]  You know, I don't really enjoy D.C.
[02:40:56.639 --> 02:40:58.461]  I kind of got pissed off the other night.
[02:40:58.521 --> 02:41:05.948]  I was walking around, I'm looking at all the walls and gates around all these federal buildings, and they have their security, but they don't want us.
[02:41:05.968 --> 02:41:13.195]  That really triggered me, that we can't have our security, but the federal government can have walls and gates and guards.
[02:41:13.455 --> 02:41:16.899]  It's reached another level, and we'll talk about it on the other side, but I experienced it tonight.
[02:41:16.939 --> 02:41:18.040]  It's reached another level.
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:19.461]  And I guess you guys are going to say goodbye.
[02:41:19.501 --> 02:41:30.448]  We're going to go for another 20 minutes or so, and then Gerald Salente is going to be coming up guest hosting, and I think we'll go into Gerald's hour a little bit and banter with him, because I'm interested to see what his perspective is on all this as well.
[02:41:30.848 --> 02:41:32.109]  So thanks for watching, everybody.
[02:41:32.129 --> 02:41:35.972]  This is part of the 14 hours, which may be more if Alex Jones shows up.
[02:41:35.992 --> 02:41:37.753]  He may ask us to go to midnight.
[02:41:37.933 --> 02:41:38.734]  Paging Alex.
[02:41:38.794 --> 02:41:39.814]  Paging Alex Putin.
[02:41:39.994 --> 02:41:40.515]  Alex Putin.
[02:41:41.696 --> 02:41:44.977]  Oh, but I tell you, you gotta watch the last Facebook Mentions we did.
[02:41:45.657 --> 02:41:48.338]  Donald Trump goes into the White House, I think is what we called it.
[02:41:48.999 --> 02:41:49.979]  It is epic.
[02:41:50.039 --> 02:41:55.621]  He goes off on, this one guy starts talking about the dossier, and he compared the dossier to a dog turd.
[02:41:55.641 --> 02:41:57.642]  Said if we have a dog turd, call it a dossier.
[02:41:57.662 --> 02:41:59.102]  Does that change it?
[02:41:59.162 --> 02:42:00.303]  That is still a dog turd.
[02:42:00.403 --> 02:42:01.503]  Anyway, you have to check that out.
[02:42:02.003 --> 02:42:02.804]  This is Rob Dewey.
[02:42:04.344 --> 02:42:05.305]  Here, you want this martini?
[02:42:05.385 --> 02:42:06.405]  Hey, it's a dossier.
[02:42:06.525 --> 02:42:07.666]  I just gave you a martini, dude.
[02:42:07.686 --> 02:42:09.187]  It's a spit martini.
[02:42:09.547 --> 02:42:10.867]  Hey, we'll be right back after this.
[02:42:10.907 --> 02:42:12.048]  Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[02:42:12.368 --> 02:42:13.469]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:13.529 --> 02:42:14.249]  Please support us.
[02:42:14.269 --> 02:42:15.270]  We are listener-supported.
[02:42:15.610 --> 02:42:22.493]  That is how we are able to fund going to the inauguration, pointing out what's going on, sending reporters on all these trips.
[02:42:22.513 --> 02:42:23.834]  We're going to try to have a D.C.
[02:42:23.874 --> 02:42:26.656]  correspondent here, and we can't do that without your help.
[02:42:26.676 --> 02:42:28.857]  So please remember to go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:28.877 --> 02:42:31.198]  We've just started the new wipes.
[02:42:31.318 --> 02:42:33.139]  Those antibacterial wipes are pretty good.
[02:42:33.839 --> 02:42:34.980]  We've got lots of other specials.
[02:42:35.001 --> 02:42:37.543]  I think there's a food special out there, a storable food special.
[02:42:37.783 --> 02:42:42.408]  If you don't have storable food, you're crazy because you never know what could happen in time of crisis.
[02:42:42.468 --> 02:42:49.815]  That may be the only thing you have if the power goes out for a week, or if a hurricane hits, or if a tornado takes out your village or your town.
[02:42:50.235 --> 02:42:52.638]  You might be the only one there able to feed your community.
[02:42:53.038 --> 02:42:55.379]  So remember that, and please support us.
[02:42:55.419 --> 02:42:57.560]  And it's a 360 win, as Alex Jones likes to say.
[02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:00.502]  You support, you get a great product that you can use.
[02:43:00.722 --> 02:43:07.365]  You also support us, and it allows us to go out and do more of what you see already, because we can't do it without your help.
[02:43:07.425 --> 02:43:11.267]  And we want to thank everybody out there who's been watching, who's been supporting, who's been spreading the link.
[02:43:11.587 --> 02:43:13.267]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:43:13.688 --> 02:43:15.869]  Thank you to Leanne and Darren McBreen.
[02:43:16.409 --> 02:43:20.771]  I wish we could be there in person, but it's also been great being here at the inauguration.
[02:43:20.791 --> 02:43:22.612]  Let me tell you, I am all smiles today.
[02:43:23.152 --> 02:43:26.053]  Donald Trump is now the 45th president of the United States.
[02:43:26.073 --> 02:43:27.114]  Modified.
[02:43:27.634 --> 02:43:28.495]  It's happening.
[02:43:28.615 --> 02:43:30.175]  He's signing executive orders.
[02:43:30.515 --> 02:43:32.176]  He's making it happen.
[02:43:32.616 --> 02:43:35.258]  And it's not about executive orders that are taking away our liberties.
[02:43:35.338 --> 02:43:38.879]  It's about undoing the chains that have been holding us down.
[02:43:39.199 --> 02:43:41.340]  So we'll be right back after this break and thanks for watching.
[02:43:48.126 --> 02:43:50.028]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:43:50.048 --> 02:43:51.169]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:52.350]  Why is this so good?
[02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:57.875]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:43:57.955 --> 02:44:11.508]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:44:11.568 --> 02:44:12.949]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:15.271]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:44:15.371 --> 02:44:17.853]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:44:17.953 --> 02:44:19.213]  These are all parasites.
[02:44:19.253 --> 02:44:20.354]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:44:20.374 --> 02:44:21.395]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:44:21.715 --> 02:44:28.299]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[02:44:28.359 --> 02:44:33.562]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[02:44:34.102 --> 02:44:38.668]  You have to disintegrate the lining, I mean, on viruses or protect themselves.
[02:44:38.748 --> 02:44:41.331]  And so do bacteria, protozoa, and mycoplasms.
[02:44:41.712 --> 02:44:45.957]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[02:44:46.138 --> 02:44:47.199]  Our own immune system.
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:50.463]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[02:44:51.164 --> 02:45:02.086]  So we actually designed the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[02:45:02.646 --> 02:45:04.267]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:06.787]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[02:45:07.467 --> 02:45:09.648]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[02:45:09.708 --> 02:45:11.008]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[02:45:11.048 --> 02:45:12.888]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[02:45:13.208 --> 02:45:14.929]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[02:45:14.949 --> 02:45:15.749]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[02:45:16.465 --> 02:45:27.870]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when they hatch?
[02:45:27.890 --> 02:45:28.070]  Right.
[02:45:28.350 --> 02:45:38.235]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss...
[02:45:39.316 --> 02:45:41.818]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[02:45:41.858 --> 02:45:42.919]  I mean all these things.
[02:45:43.179 --> 02:45:44.260]  Doctors don't know.
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:47.983]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[02:45:48.023 --> 02:45:50.145]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[02:45:50.245 --> 02:45:53.468]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease.
[02:45:53.968 --> 02:45:56.209]  And how to eliminate all disease out there.
[02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:57.649]  They don't want you to know about it.
[02:45:57.909 --> 02:46:00.610]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[02:46:00.890 --> 02:46:04.271]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[02:46:04.312 --> 02:46:06.152]  So many people have pets these days.
[02:46:06.632 --> 02:46:08.053]  People eat raw sushi.
[02:46:08.453 --> 02:46:10.073]  People eat more raw food.
[02:46:10.113 --> 02:46:14.275]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[02:46:14.815 --> 02:46:18.156]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[02:46:18.196 --> 02:46:21.017]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[02:46:21.077 --> 02:46:22.538]  We just have to do everything.
[02:46:22.618 --> 02:46:26.339]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:46:26.459 --> 02:46:26.659]  All right.
[02:46:26.699 --> 02:46:29.500]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:30.540]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:31.121]  Living Defense.
[02:46:31.421 --> 02:46:32.461]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:32.521 --> 02:46:33.541]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:46:33.561 --> 02:46:35.642]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:46:36.282 --> 02:46:38.123]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:46:38.203 --> 02:46:39.303]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:39.563 --> 02:46:41.444]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:46:41.824 --> 02:46:43.785]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:46:56.468 --> 02:46:58.931]  Well, that sound means it's official.
[02:46:59.792 --> 02:47:03.836]  We now have a 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.
[02:47:03.996 --> 02:47:10.183]  Donald J. Trump was, I guess he took the oath to defend the Constitution from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:47:11.141 --> 02:47:12.562]  At 12 o'clock today.
[02:47:12.582 --> 02:47:16.204]  The Clintons may have crapped their britches.
[02:47:17.005 --> 02:47:19.667]  As everybody started to cheer, I'm like, well, that must have happened.
[02:47:20.227 --> 02:47:21.668]  Josh goes, yep, I just got a tweet.
[02:47:21.808 --> 02:47:22.368]  He's president.
[02:47:22.408 --> 02:47:28.772]  We were walking around in the back periphery area just looking for the protesters, trying to engage them.
[02:47:29.853 --> 02:47:32.718]  And, of course, these people aren't people who want to engage.
[02:47:32.738 --> 02:47:35.882]  They just want to scream and shout and beat on buckets and blow whistles.
[02:47:36.103 --> 02:47:38.827]  I would like to, uh, I'd like to blame the left for something right now.
[02:47:38.847 --> 02:47:40.569]  For something I had to deal with today.
[02:47:40.689 --> 02:47:42.632]  Do you mind if I just... The security apparatus?
[02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:44.775]  Do you mind if I just kind of air my grievances right now?
[02:47:45.336 --> 02:47:46.277]  I won't get too into it.
[02:47:46.417 --> 02:47:48.059]  It's not Festivus, but we'll let you.
[02:47:48.179 --> 02:47:48.579]  Here's the deal.
[02:47:48.639 --> 02:47:59.831]  So I basically was, I don't know, a block away from where we're at right now, maybe two, and it took me about three hours, maybe even four hours to get here.
[02:47:59.871 --> 02:48:00.631]  I was a block away.
[02:48:01.352 --> 02:48:08.699]  And the way they have the streets laid out, it's like you can walk up and down, but you can't get through side to side because there's so much security.
[02:48:08.719 --> 02:48:15.486]  So I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, well it doesn't make any sense, because as I'm walking down these roads, the roads in between are actually empty.
[02:48:15.506 --> 02:48:19.830]  I should be able to just walk, there was no parade route, there was nothing in the way, they were just empty.
[02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:22.351]  But the police had no idea what was going on.
[02:48:22.391 --> 02:48:23.992]  They were just told you can't walk through here.
[02:48:24.293 --> 02:48:27.155]  They said, oh, you gotta go around there, then you go around there, it's block two.
[02:48:27.495 --> 02:48:44.046]  But what I found out was, this is what I found out, the reason why they weren't letting anyone through those through roads, which they normally would be doing, is because they couldn't have, essentially, a TSA unit there, or a checkpoint there, to check everybody walking through those roads.
[02:48:44.486 --> 02:48:48.869]  So basically, they wanted to have a checkpoint at every intersection.
[02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:50.049]  Is what they want to do.
[02:48:50.089 --> 02:48:51.170]  So here's what I'm saying though.
[02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.890]  Because I get it.
[02:48:52.330 --> 02:48:53.271]  We need the security.
[02:48:53.531 --> 02:48:53.871]  Okay?
[02:48:53.951 --> 02:48:55.072]  We've understood the threats.
[02:48:55.352 --> 02:48:57.573]  You know, we've seen the Project Veritas videos.
[02:48:58.013 --> 02:49:00.374]  We know about what the globalists might try to do.
[02:49:01.155 --> 02:49:04.316]  But here's why I blame the left for the troubles that it took.
[02:49:04.596 --> 02:49:05.617]  For not just me, folks.
[02:49:05.637 --> 02:49:05.977]  Trust me.
[02:49:06.037 --> 02:49:09.619]  There were a lot of people that were peeved at the way they shut down these roads here.
[02:49:10.459 --> 02:49:21.188]  I blame the left because A, the left had to amp up the protest, they had to make a big deal about their protest, they had to threaten this inauguration so they had to increase security in Washington, D.C.
[02:49:21.568 --> 02:49:25.872]  And then I blame the left on a second note because you are the people that want the open border.
[02:49:26.232 --> 02:49:29.555]  You are the ones that are allowing ISIS to infiltrate this country.
[02:49:29.975 --> 02:49:32.537]  You are the ones that are allowing that threat to exist.
[02:49:32.838 --> 02:49:34.119]  So thank you to the left.
[02:49:34.659 --> 02:49:36.340]  You couldn't walk through Washington, D.C.
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:40.161]  today because of your protest and your open border policies.
[02:49:40.181 --> 02:49:41.802]  So I just wanted to thank the left for that.
[02:49:42.142 --> 02:49:42.642]  But you know what?
[02:49:42.702 --> 02:49:43.523]  I should be thanking them.
[02:49:43.583 --> 02:49:47.004]  I got about 10 miles of walking in today, so I'm all chipper.
[02:49:47.364 --> 02:49:51.266]  Thanks to the left because of your threats with the open border and the protest.
[02:49:51.546 --> 02:49:53.487]  People can't even walk through the streets of D.C.
[02:49:53.507 --> 02:49:54.988]  that they pay tax dollars to use.
[02:49:55.468 --> 02:50:00.310]  You literally could not cross Pennsylvania Avenue, which is right out here where the parade was earlier today.
[02:50:00.970 --> 02:50:01.370]  I think so.
[02:50:17.267 --> 02:50:29.975]  You know, and you go back to, I think it was one of those correspondence dinners, those White House correspondence dinners, where they have the comedians, and I think it was Seth Meyer made the joke of, oh, I thought Donald Trump was running as a joke.
[02:50:30.516 --> 02:50:32.817]  That was Seth Meyer, the joker, the comedian.
[02:50:33.418 --> 02:50:39.822]  And I think it's at that moment that Donald Trump probably said, you know what, I'm going to win this thing.
[02:50:40.722 --> 02:50:44.044]  And I'm going to grind this guy's face into it, this little sniveling wimp.
[02:50:44.064 --> 02:50:47.426]  Like his brain just kind of magically morphed into like a middle finger?
[02:50:47.446 --> 02:50:50.788]  Yeah, he just went mega.
[02:50:51.568 --> 02:50:59.713]  And then to watch Seth Meyer the day after the election cry because his mother wanted to see a woman president.
[02:50:59.993 --> 02:51:03.795]  And I have nothing against a woman president, but it ain't gonna be Hillary Clinton.
[02:51:03.855 --> 02:51:04.936]  It ain't gonna be Hillary Clinton.
[02:51:05.416 --> 02:51:06.837]  You know who I think it could be?
[02:51:07.037 --> 02:51:07.758]  I'll say this right now.
[02:51:09.062 --> 02:51:11.484]  And it's not because she's a surfer.
[02:51:11.844 --> 02:51:13.265]  It's not because she served in the military.
[02:51:13.825 --> 02:51:18.389]  It's because she spoke out against our government funding ISIS.
[02:51:19.449 --> 02:51:22.251]  And she's a congresswoman from Hawaii.
[02:51:22.271 --> 02:51:23.352]  Her name is Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:51:23.812 --> 02:51:28.035]  I honestly think she could be our first woman president because she speaks truth.
[02:51:28.355 --> 02:51:30.357]  She's not afraid to stray from her party.
[02:51:30.417 --> 02:51:31.097]  She's a Democrat.
[02:51:32.378 --> 02:51:34.640]  And she's not bad looking either.
[02:51:35.339 --> 02:51:35.539]  So.
[02:51:36.199 --> 02:51:39.420]  But I don't know, I think Ivanka right now is the lead candidate for that.
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:41.060]  As long as it's not Hillary.
[02:51:41.101 --> 02:51:42.761]  As long as it's anything but Hillary.
[02:51:42.841 --> 02:51:44.101]  I think Hillary's gone and buried.
[02:51:44.121 --> 02:51:44.801]  What about Michelle?
[02:51:44.861 --> 02:51:46.302]  You think Michelle might consider?
[02:51:46.382 --> 02:51:46.942]  No, no, no, no.
[02:51:47.162 --> 02:51:51.103]  Michelle is the bitter- Would that be the first woman president, though?
[02:51:52.183 --> 02:51:52.924]  I think she could be.
[02:51:53.024 --> 02:51:53.924]  Might be a codpiece.
[02:51:53.944 --> 02:51:54.644]  I don't know.
[02:51:54.904 --> 02:51:58.325]  Oh, well, Michelle, yeah, yeah.
[02:51:58.705 --> 02:51:59.045]  I don't know.
[02:51:59.125 --> 02:52:00.165]  I'm not going to get in a merman.
[02:52:03.581 --> 02:52:05.742]  But it's just amazing what we saw.
[02:52:05.762 --> 02:52:08.923]  We're going to have Gerald Cilente coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:52:08.943 --> 02:52:10.544]  We're going to banter with him back and forth.
[02:52:11.584 --> 02:52:13.285]  Have you guys been taking calls today at all?
[02:52:13.365 --> 02:52:16.546]  I don't know if we're going to have time to take calls, but maybe we'll do that when we come back.
[02:52:16.566 --> 02:52:23.228]  We're actually going to come back after Cilente does his hour in this 14-hour marathon broadcast, which we love doing.
[02:52:23.508 --> 02:52:28.890]  I'm sure the crew back there loves it because we feed them very well while it's being done.
[02:52:31.333 --> 02:52:34.663]  We're going to come back, have Gerald Cilente on for a little while, and then...
[02:52:36.092 --> 02:52:37.253]  He's gonna go and then we're gonna come out.
[02:52:37.273 --> 02:52:41.755]  We're gonna have a young man who was beaten up at one of these events by some protesters.
[02:52:41.895 --> 02:52:42.395]  Bloodied.
[02:52:43.015 --> 02:52:44.416]  His stuff was all over Twitter.
[02:52:44.796 --> 02:52:51.819]  It was like one of the few... He was probably the bloodiest attack, I think, that happened here at this inauguration.
[02:52:52.019 --> 02:52:56.742]  And it's wild because they were burning things, smashing windows, attacking people.
[02:52:57.082 --> 02:53:01.364]  And just real quick, because I thought about this with the Seth Meyers thing, because me and you were talking about winning the culture war.
[02:53:01.884 --> 02:53:02.024]  Yeah.
[02:53:02.044 --> 02:53:12.335]  Not just, you know, the political thing, but also the culture war to try to change some of these indoctrinating industries, just to, so they're not, basically you can't be a conservative and exist in the industry.
[02:53:12.716 --> 02:53:13.617]  You know, that culture war.
[02:53:13.817 --> 02:53:13.937]  Right.
[02:53:14.157 --> 02:53:16.580]  And it's like, I see people like Seth Meyers and I'm like, dude!
[02:53:17.298 --> 02:53:19.239]  You know, just come on the winning team, man.
[02:53:19.299 --> 02:53:20.440]  I'm not even going to be mad.
[02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:22.000]  I'm not even going to be mad.
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:22.761]  You're a joker.
[02:53:22.801 --> 02:53:23.761]  You're literally a comedian.
[02:53:23.781 --> 02:53:24.542]  Just flip-flop.
[02:53:24.602 --> 02:53:25.462]  Who cares, dude?
[02:53:25.802 --> 02:53:26.883]  Come on the winning team.
[02:53:27.203 --> 02:53:28.364]  Quit embarrassing yourself.
[02:53:28.764 --> 02:53:31.826]  Let's go shoot some guns and talk about how great the Second Amendment is.
[02:53:31.886 --> 02:53:33.686]  Yeah, but we're going to talk with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:53:33.707 --> 02:53:34.367]  I look forward to that.
[02:53:34.747 --> 02:53:37.708]  Yeah, and I'm sure he's got some great insights of what's going on.
[02:53:38.528 --> 02:53:40.929]  All these people keep saying, you know, the economy is going to collapse.
[02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:42.069]  I love these people, these protesters.
[02:53:42.429 --> 02:53:43.909]  Oh, Trump hasn't done anything for the economy.
[02:53:44.229 --> 02:53:47.890]  He hasn't even been president yet, and he's already done so much that you know about it.
[02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:49.170]  It's crazy.
[02:53:49.391 --> 02:53:51.751]  Well, Ali Baba said they're going to bring a million jobs.
[02:53:51.771 --> 02:53:52.231]  Oh, fake news.
[02:53:52.251 --> 02:53:52.851]  Can you believe that?
[02:53:52.871 --> 02:53:55.832]  Fake news, even though the guy is literally there at Trump Tower shaking his hand.
[02:53:55.892 --> 02:53:56.592]  It's probably fake news.
[02:53:56.692 --> 02:54:03.274]  I tell you what, I was talking with our security detail here with Alex, and when they did the, I think it was a 21 cannon salute.
[02:54:04.301 --> 02:54:09.309]  The first time those cans went off, they said, uh-oh, is this it?
[02:54:09.509 --> 02:54:12.795]  And then they went off again, and they're like, oh, okay, it's just the 21 can is the loser.
[02:54:12.815 --> 02:54:13.616]  Just the ceremony.
[02:54:15.337 --> 02:54:18.580]  But they held their collective breath all at that one instant.
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:40.296]  And, you know, because there were times that we thought that, you know, CNN's run those stories, oh, if the president doesn't get inaugurated, then here's the guy that Obama picked, because none of these cabinets have been sworn in yet, they haven't been approved, so there's nobody that could take over in Donald Trump's regime, and it would be somebody that was appointed by Obama.
[02:54:42.077 --> 02:54:44.419]  And they kept playing that up like something was going to happen.
[02:54:44.439 --> 02:54:47.141]  And then you have 60 Democrats sit out of the whole ceremony.
[02:54:47.641 --> 02:54:49.582]  I think that's going to be their death knell right there.
[02:54:51.104 --> 02:54:56.387]  Even people who don't support Trump are going to view that as, you know, very anti-American, very despicable.
[02:54:56.687 --> 02:54:57.748]  And these people are despicable.
[02:54:58.048 --> 02:54:58.929]  And they should be called out.
[02:54:58.969 --> 02:55:02.031]  Well, it'll be interesting to see if that starts to kind of manifest itself.
[02:55:02.071 --> 02:55:05.354]  These politicians that try to buck Trump, they end up losing their jobs.
[02:55:05.434 --> 02:55:07.655]  They don't win when it's their time on the ticket.
[02:55:07.815 --> 02:55:09.657]  The election comes up and they don't win.
[02:55:09.697 --> 02:55:10.617]  They don't exit after it.
[02:55:11.018 --> 02:55:11.198]  Yeah.
[02:55:11.818 --> 02:55:16.582]  So we've got a long way to go with where we're at.
[02:55:16.742 --> 02:55:24.228]  But man, I tell you, we couldn't have a better start to 2017 than getting Donald Trump into the presidency.
[02:55:24.688 --> 02:55:25.729]  It's official.
[02:55:28.371 --> 02:55:32.234]  There's so many things that they can't do now that they could do even yesterday.
[02:55:33.015 --> 02:55:47.684]  You know, and it feels good, and I tell you, the mood on the street, the families that are here, the people, the excitement, the excitement from these people just being here, seeing what's going on, seeing other Trump people.
[02:55:48.485 --> 02:55:54.749]  You know, I met a group of high schoolers, I put a video up, and they were all here to see Trump, all supporting him.
[02:55:55.109 --> 02:55:57.811]  A lot of their families didn't even support, they voted for Hillary.
[02:55:58.331 --> 02:56:01.596]  You know, this kid, his dad was a Republican, his mom was a Democrat.
[02:56:01.636 --> 02:56:02.597]  They both voted for Hillary.
[02:56:02.697 --> 02:56:03.839]  Did that happen to be the group from St.
[02:56:03.859 --> 02:56:04.139]  Louis?
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:06.482]  Wearing their neon yellow hoodies?
[02:56:06.903 --> 02:56:07.664]  No, no, no.
[02:56:07.784 --> 02:56:10.267]  They had hoodies on but they were red.
[02:56:10.728 --> 02:56:12.771]  And they were from Florida and Texas.
[02:56:13.792 --> 02:56:15.813]  But, you know, there's a lot of high school groups coming out.
[02:56:15.833 --> 02:56:18.615]  Yeah, because I was able to find some schools from where I grew up in St.
[02:56:18.655 --> 02:56:18.935]  Louis.
[02:56:19.135 --> 02:56:20.976]  They were kind of saying the same thing the students were to me.
[02:56:20.996 --> 02:56:23.498]  They were like, well, you know, my parents didn't really like Trump.
[02:56:23.558 --> 02:56:25.499]  Of course, my teachers didn't really like Trump.
[02:56:25.779 --> 02:56:27.420]  But they were kind of like, I think he's kind of cool.
[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:28.461]  You know, I'm going to give him a chance.
[02:56:29.001 --> 02:56:31.643]  Well, and I think kids can see through BS.
[02:56:32.003 --> 02:56:33.944]  And also kids don't like to do what their parents are doing.
[02:56:33.984 --> 02:56:37.645]  So if your parents are voting for Hillary, they're like, oh man, I better not vote for Hillary.
[02:56:37.886 --> 02:56:42.448]  I'll vote for this other... You know, I think it's funny that Trump's 70 years old.
[02:56:42.488 --> 02:56:43.688]  He does not look 70 years old.
[02:56:43.748 --> 02:56:47.650]  And he has the energy, I mean, of a 20-year-old, I suppose.
[02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.070]  I mean, the guy's unbelievable.
[02:56:49.090 --> 02:56:49.571]  High energy.
[02:56:49.771 --> 02:56:51.371]  He's got this MAGA energy.
[02:56:51.391 --> 02:56:52.372]  Totally MAGA.
[02:56:52.392 --> 02:56:55.013]  Unless there's like five Donald Trumps and we just don't know.
[02:56:55.613 --> 02:56:59.295]  That's the only reason I could see how, unless he has unbelievable energy.
[02:57:00.788 --> 02:57:01.388]  It's been good.
[02:57:01.608 --> 02:57:03.249]  Five clones or high-energy Trump?
[02:57:03.749 --> 02:57:04.250]  It's been good.
[02:57:04.270 --> 02:57:08.592]  I'm actually going to check Twitter, see if anything brand new is coming out.
[02:57:09.452 --> 02:57:10.333]  I haven't seen anything.
[02:57:10.393 --> 02:57:15.055]  The same reports we're hearing, all the Trump appointees are being confirmed.
[02:57:15.175 --> 02:57:15.555]  Oh, good.
[02:57:16.015 --> 02:57:23.179]  Now, did Marco Rubio, the one thing I haven't seen yet is Marco Rubio standing in the way of Rex Tillerson.
[02:57:23.279 --> 02:57:26.160]  Little Marco, little Marco now.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:29.742]  In fact, when Marco runs in the next
[02:57:30.342 --> 02:57:31.043]  Flora Reyes.
[02:57:31.123 --> 02:57:31.683]  Let me read this.
[02:57:31.723 --> 02:57:33.885]  He's gonna have to have his name as Little Marco.
[02:57:34.005 --> 02:57:34.685]  Let me read this.
[02:57:36.307 --> 02:57:43.292]  I cried today watching the inauguration and knowing we stopped Hillary from ruining more lives from all her corrupt lying ways.
[02:57:43.412 --> 02:57:45.493]  And that was Kathy Shelton who wrote that.
[02:57:45.513 --> 02:57:50.257]  And if you don't know who Kathy Shelton is, she was a little girl when she was 12 years old.
[02:57:50.317 --> 02:57:51.158]  She was gang raped.
[02:57:51.858 --> 02:58:01.801]  And Hillary Clinton defended one of those rapists, and she took evidence of this bloody underwear and took it over state lines, which is against the law.
[02:58:02.142 --> 02:58:03.142]  She tampered with it.
[02:58:03.582 --> 02:58:14.246]  And when she brought this little girl up on the stand, 12-year-old girl, imagine your daughter, 12 years old, gang-raped, brought up on the stand, and the defense lawyer is going, oh, you wanted it, didn't you?
[02:58:14.406 --> 02:58:15.126]  You wanted it.
[02:58:15.666 --> 02:58:17.928]  That is how wicked Hillary Clinton is.
[02:58:18.529 --> 02:58:24.635]  And we were this close to having Hillary, well, after the election it was this close because she lost by a landslide.
[02:58:24.955 --> 02:58:29.579]  But we were that close to having that evil witch in charge of everything.
[02:58:29.639 --> 02:58:33.823]  And let me tell you, if you think Libya and Syria were her stopping points, they weren't.
[02:58:34.164 --> 02:58:35.445]  She wanted war with Russia.
[02:58:35.985 --> 02:58:39.288]  And just, and jerks like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, these
[02:58:42.848 --> 02:58:46.170]  I'm glad I don't run into one of those guys because they're going to get an earful.
[02:58:46.470 --> 02:58:48.651]  Especially John McCain and Lindsey Graham.
[02:58:48.711 --> 02:58:51.193]  They are un-American trash.
[02:58:51.233 --> 02:58:52.554]  They hate this country.
[02:58:52.694 --> 02:58:55.295]  Those are the people that the protesters should be in the street protesting.
[02:58:55.315 --> 02:58:55.816]  Exactly.
[02:58:56.736 --> 02:58:57.557]  Not Donald Trump.
[02:58:58.260 --> 02:58:58.460]  Yeah.
[02:58:58.700 --> 02:58:59.901]  But they don't do the research.
[02:58:59.921 --> 02:59:00.842]  They don't know the history.
[02:59:01.162 --> 02:59:03.823]  They don't understand the actual geopolitics.
[02:59:04.264 --> 02:59:04.484]  Right.
[02:59:04.844 --> 02:59:09.227]  So as we go to break, we're going to go to break, come back with the swearing in.
[02:59:09.747 --> 02:59:14.570]  Of course, we're going to relive that moment over and over and over again because now it's bona fide.
[02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:16.351]  Now he's the 45th president.
[02:59:16.691 --> 02:59:17.572]  Now it's going to take
[02:59:18.072 --> 02:59:35.844]  Literally an army to remove him at any cost and I think he's gonna I think we got an easy four years at this point Let's get Trump in let's see what he's gonna do in these in this first hundred days than his second hundred days And and let me tell you something if Trump starts going back on his word.
[02:59:36.244 --> 02:59:42.428]  We're gonna hold his feet to the fire we're not gonna let him sit around and and and handle us the way Obama handled us and
[02:59:43.147 --> 02:59:44.708]  But I think we're going to get a different ballgame.
[02:59:44.808 --> 02:59:49.531]  I really do believe in my heart of hearts that Donald Trump is the real deal.
[02:59:49.771 --> 02:59:51.392]  He wants to see everybody succeed.
[02:59:51.432 --> 02:59:56.095]  He wants to open up the playing field for everybody and just have prosperity.
[02:59:56.135 --> 02:59:57.055]  Because we can have it.
[02:59:57.416 --> 02:59:59.597]  We can be prosperous once again.
[02:59:59.817 --> 03:00:00.818]  Not just getting by.
[03:00:01.358 --> 03:00:01.618]  Okay?
[03:00:01.778 --> 03:00:03.519]  There's a lot of people out there who are getting by right now.
[03:00:03.539 --> 03:00:04.300]  You have a job.
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:06.001]  You're living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:00:06.541 --> 03:00:07.802]  But you're just getting by.
[03:00:08.789 --> 03:00:09.650]  We can change that.
[03:00:09.970 --> 03:00:13.312]  We can have a society where we're all prosperous.
[03:00:13.712 --> 03:00:14.212]  Everybody.
[03:00:15.093 --> 03:00:17.174]  And even the people that are out there protesting.
[03:00:17.234 --> 03:00:18.335]  You can be prosperous too.
[03:00:18.435 --> 03:00:22.917]  All you have to do is decide you don't want to hand out, you just want to hand up.
[03:00:23.378 --> 03:00:23.758]  That's it.
[03:00:24.058 --> 03:00:25.319]  All you want to do is hand to help you up.
[03:00:26.055 --> 03:00:28.939]  And once you're on your feet, you're going to walk your own walk.
[03:00:28.959 --> 03:00:30.060]  You're going to talk your own talk.
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:32.744]  You're going to come up with your ideas that are going to change the world.
[03:00:32.964 --> 03:00:34.926]  Because everybody's got an idea that can change the world.
[03:00:34.986 --> 03:00:36.148]  And we can all do it together.
[03:00:36.548 --> 03:00:38.751]  And we are going to be that guiding light.
[03:00:39.611 --> 03:00:43.173]  And so, as we go to break, please go to InfoWareStore.com, check out our specials.
[03:00:43.193 --> 03:00:48.556]  We have these brand new wipes that are from the Pentagon, these antibacterial wipes.
[03:00:48.836 --> 03:00:53.479]  They're ordered, they used to be exclusive through the Pentagon, but now we have them.
[03:00:53.499 --> 03:00:55.940]  We're able to sell them to you at a great price.
[03:00:56.360 --> 03:00:56.881]  Check them out.
[03:00:56.961 --> 03:01:00.723]  We have the gun, what are those, the lower thirds?
[03:01:01.403 --> 03:01:01.964]  Lower.
[03:01:02.304 --> 03:01:03.624]  Lower receivers, thank you.
[03:01:04.065 --> 03:01:04.525]  The lowers.
[03:01:04.565 --> 03:01:09.386]  That's Zimmerman in the back who, let me tell you, the reason all this stuff is running right now is Michael Zimmerman.
[03:01:09.466 --> 03:01:10.366]  Total MVP.
[03:01:10.946 --> 03:01:15.007]  A young man who's joined us, what, have you been here a year yet?
[03:01:15.947 --> 03:01:17.228]  A year and a half he's been here.
[03:01:17.248 --> 03:01:19.708]  It doesn't feel like a year and a half.
[03:01:20.148 --> 03:01:28.910]  But he drove up here with Josh Owens to set all this stuff up for everybody so we could have a studio for a couple days and really, you know, look like a professional organization.
[03:01:29.983 --> 03:01:31.524]  To bring you guys the information.
[03:01:31.865 --> 03:01:36.829]  We don't have a multi-million dollar budget like CNN, or MSNBC, or NPR.
[03:01:36.869 --> 03:01:38.391]  And we don't hide on the rooftop either.
[03:01:38.411 --> 03:01:39.512]  We go into the streets with you.
[03:01:39.792 --> 03:01:40.272]  Exactly.
[03:01:40.372 --> 03:01:41.814]  Because we want to hear what you have to say.
[03:01:42.274 --> 03:01:43.595]  And we've been doing it all day long.
[03:01:43.675 --> 03:01:47.599]  It's been great just doing these Facebook mentions, talking to people, letting it out.
[03:01:48.239 --> 03:01:50.101]  And when we come back, we're going to have Gerald Cilente with us.
[03:01:50.121 --> 03:01:53.284]  We're also going to be showing a little bit of the swearing-in ceremony as we go to break.
[03:01:53.664 --> 03:01:55.386]  But please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:55.726 --> 03:01:57.067]  Check out some of our great products.
[03:01:57.167 --> 03:01:58.208]  Get the Survival Shield.
[03:01:58.248 --> 03:01:59.449]  Get the Supermail Vitality.
[03:01:59.489 --> 03:02:00.590]  Get the Brain Force.
[03:02:01.631 --> 03:02:02.272]  Silver Bullet.
[03:02:02.552 --> 03:02:08.137]  I bring Silver Bullet, Secret 12, Brain Force, and what's the other one?
[03:02:09.218 --> 03:02:09.659]  X2.
[03:02:10.099 --> 03:02:11.620]  Those go with me on every trip.
[03:02:12.518 --> 03:02:16.981]  Every time I start feeling, throw it a little scratchy, silver bullet.
[03:02:17.081 --> 03:02:17.541]  Every time.
[03:02:17.721 --> 03:02:18.282]  It's the best.
[03:02:18.442 --> 03:02:18.902]  It really is.
[03:02:19.122 --> 03:02:22.064]  Nose is stuffed up, silver bullet up the nose.
[03:02:22.144 --> 03:02:22.564]  I'd do it.
[03:02:22.884 --> 03:02:29.609]  And in fact, I waterboarded Watson with silver bullet at one point because we had to go on a car trip with him and he was sick.
[03:02:30.209 --> 03:02:32.270]  He was coughing, he was like, I'm sick, I'm sick.
[03:02:32.310 --> 03:02:39.715]  I'm like, lay down, here's some silver bullet and we'll put that video footage out soon enough so you can see us waterboarding Watson with silver bullet.
[03:02:39.875 --> 03:02:40.315]  It was great.
[03:02:40.536 --> 03:02:41.437]  So anyway, we're going to go to break.
[03:02:41.457 --> 03:02:48.424]  We'll come back with the great Gerald Salente from Trends Forecast and see what he has to say about Trump's inauguration.
[03:02:48.444 --> 03:02:51.047]  I'm sure he's going to have some interesting insights about the speech.
[03:02:51.367 --> 03:02:52.428]  Stuff we haven't talked about yet.
[03:02:52.468 --> 03:02:56.853]  He's a great mind, a great trends forecaster, and we are very lucky to have him.
[03:02:57.293 --> 03:02:57.573]  I don't know.
[03:03:17.731 --> 03:03:27.856]  They play a lot of Alex Jones clips and they kind of make fun of Alex sometimes, but they believe everything he says because in the end they bring back all this information.
[03:03:27.896 --> 03:03:28.356]  I love that.
[03:03:28.396 --> 03:03:28.996]  He was right.
[03:03:29.296 --> 03:03:30.657]  Look, Alex Jones was right.
[03:03:30.897 --> 03:03:32.278]  The crazy guy was right again!
[03:03:33.038 --> 03:03:35.219]  Especially when it comes to the gay frogs.
[03:03:35.299 --> 03:03:38.761]  The best part is the last time you were interviewing him and you're in studio.
[03:03:39.341 --> 03:03:51.809]  And, you know, we have our guns all over the office, and you guys just randomly started talking about guns, and you're just like, oh yeah, you know, I got my gun right here, it's a nice gun, and he was like, wait a second, boom, and then he had his gun, and it was just like, oh, we got our guns too.
[03:03:51.949 --> 03:03:54.110]  It's good to see people who support the Second Amendment.
[03:03:54.270 --> 03:03:57.552]  So, with that, we're going to go to break, and we'll be back with Gerald Cilente.
[03:03:57.632 --> 03:03:58.273]  Thanks for watching.
[03:04:04.139 --> 03:04:10.304]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:04:10.684 --> 03:04:13.566]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:04:13.906 --> 03:04:19.090]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:25.494]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:04:25.634 --> 03:04:28.777]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:04:28.937 --> 03:04:30.378]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:04:30.578 --> 03:04:34.722]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:04:34.902 --> 03:04:37.765]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:04:37.865 --> 03:04:39.427]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:04:39.507 --> 03:04:42.690]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:45.313]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:04:45.593 --> 03:04:46.554]  It's in powder form.
[03:04:46.654 --> 03:04:49.337]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:04:49.357 --> 03:04:50.138]  I take this.
[03:04:50.238 --> 03:04:51.939]  This is the product that I take.
[03:04:52.059 --> 03:04:54.021]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:04:54.842 --> 03:04:55.623]  We fight the Globals.
[03:04:55.643 --> 03:04:56.483]  We fight the New World Order.
[03:04:56.783 --> 03:05:00.986]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:05:01.026 --> 03:05:01.707]  Everyone please stand.
[03:05:23.922 --> 03:05:27.004]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[03:05:28.165 --> 03:05:30.807]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[03:05:30.827 --> 03:05:34.670]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[03:05:35.051 --> 03:05:37.092]  That I will faithfully execute.
[03:05:37.733 --> 03:05:39.915]  That I will faithfully execute.
[03:05:40.135 --> 03:05:42.817]  The office of President of the United States.
[03:05:43.197 --> 03:05:46.140]  The office of President of the United States.
[03:05:46.561 --> 03:05:48.523]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[03:05:49.024 --> 03:05:51.206]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[03:05:51.586 --> 03:05:53.649]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[03:05:54.069 --> 03:05:55.871]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[03:05:56.152 --> 03:05:58.154]  The Constitution of the United States.
[03:05:58.274 --> 03:06:00.657]  The Constitution of the United States.
[03:06:00.797 --> 03:06:01.638]  So help me God.
[03:06:01.858 --> 03:06:02.719]  So help me God.
[03:06:03.219 --> 03:06:04.481]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[03:07:12.901 --> 03:07:23.281]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[03:07:49.457 --> 03:08:04.002]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:23.441]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[03:08:25.563 --> 03:08:33.429]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[03:08:34.952 --> 03:08:36.554]  We will face challenges.
[03:08:37.175 --> 03:08:38.817]  We will confront hardships.
[03:08:39.458 --> 03:08:41.520]  But we will get the job done.
[03:08:42.942 --> 03:08:49.149]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[03:08:50.296 --> 03:09:01.041]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[03:09:01.702 --> 03:09:03.983]  They have been magnificent.
[03:09:04.303 --> 03:09:04.763]  Thank you.
[03:09:12.227 --> 03:09:13.728]  Today's ceremony, however,
[03:09:14.605 --> 03:09:16.546]  Has very special meaning.
[03:09:17.446 --> 03:09:23.589]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[03:09:24.249 --> 03:09:25.829]  Or from one party to another.
[03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:30.631]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[03:09:31.192 --> 03:09:34.293]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[03:09:47.578 --> 03:09:50.100]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:51.500]  It's not true.
[03:09:52.581 --> 03:09:54.883]  That's impossible!
[03:09:55.203 --> 03:09:58.104]  Stretch your feelings, you know it to be true.
[03:10:19.534 --> 03:10:27.101]  And that sound, of course... I guess that's some weird inaugural march that they played today.
[03:10:27.701 --> 03:10:29.643]  And that means that Trump is now president.
[03:10:30.063 --> 03:10:33.066]  So, Bill Maher, we know it's your birthday.
[03:10:34.147 --> 03:10:35.628]  We know you're a liberal douche.
[03:10:36.829 --> 03:10:41.313]  Although I like your views on drugs, and marijuana specifically.
[03:10:42.588 --> 03:10:45.290]  But we're going to sing a little happy birthday song.
[03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:46.151]  For Bill Maher?
[03:10:46.331 --> 03:10:46.831]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:47.191 --> 03:10:50.274]  But we're going to sing it as if we're precious snowflakes.
[03:11:09.363 --> 03:11:14.429]  I actually heard somebody walking by and they go, I miss Obama already.
[03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:16.672]  These people are fricking idiots.
[03:11:16.692 --> 03:11:18.695]  Probably never even met Obama once in his life.
[03:11:18.715 --> 03:11:19.516]  Fricking idiots.
[03:11:19.576 --> 03:11:23.240]  Not Bill Maher, but somebody walking after the inauguration.
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:25.323]  Do you think Bill Maher is having a good birthday?
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:30.061]  Wow, this is the best birthday ever.
[03:11:30.482 --> 03:11:31.563]  Happy birthday, Bill Maher.
[03:11:31.683 --> 03:11:32.643]  Happy birthday, Bill.
[03:11:32.664 --> 03:11:33.845]  Donald Trump's your president.
[03:11:33.865 --> 03:11:34.905]  That's my birthday gift to you.
[03:11:34.966 --> 03:11:35.646]  I voted for him.
[03:11:35.866 --> 03:11:40.090]  I think it was really funny when Ann Coulter said, Donald Trump is gonna win the nomination.
[03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:42.612]  And just stood up there like... And everybody laughed at her.
[03:11:43.613 --> 03:11:44.674]  Everybody laughed at her.
[03:11:44.694 --> 03:11:46.115]  They went beyond laugh.
[03:11:46.135 --> 03:11:47.637]  They looked at her like she was crazy.
[03:11:48.237 --> 03:11:49.518]  And she's just like, well, that's how I feel.
[03:11:49.538 --> 03:11:50.979]  They wanted to put her in a straitjacket.
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:58.825]  And I was not a big fan of Ann Coulter during the Bush administration because I thought she was sort of a Bush apologist and sticking with the Republican Party line.
[03:11:59.206 --> 03:12:06.492]  But, you know, she's definitely come out against Obama and she was definitely pro-Trump when I think she could have been like, oh, I'm with Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz.
[03:12:06.992 --> 03:12:08.913]  She went pro-Trump and she was right.
[03:12:09.134 --> 03:12:11.676]  So I think everybody has room to learn and grow.
[03:12:12.436 --> 03:12:17.538]  And she did that, and maybe Bill Maher will learn and grow, and maybe all these other people will learn and grow.
[03:12:17.698 --> 03:12:19.919]  Only when they're losing the culture war will that happen.
[03:12:19.939 --> 03:12:20.079]  Exactly.
[03:12:20.119 --> 03:12:26.801]  Now one person, our guest coming up, and actually he's going to take over here for the rest of the hour, coming up is Gerald Salente.
[03:12:26.821 --> 03:12:30.062]  He's a trends forecaster who runs Trends Journal.
[03:12:30.162 --> 03:12:32.563]  TrendsJournal.com or TrendsResearch.com.
[03:12:32.583 --> 03:12:38.345]  You can check out the amazing, get a copy of the Trends Journal and just
[03:12:38.985 --> 03:12:44.930]  Let me tell you, if you're a small business guy and you want to see what's going to be in the future, that's a great place to start is with the Trends Journal.
[03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:48.633]  You can see what industries will be upcoming and booming.
[03:12:49.194 --> 03:12:50.355]  Gerald's predicted a lot of things.
[03:12:50.395 --> 03:12:56.500]  In fact, the cover of his current Trends Journal is, Reality Champ wins Presidential Reality Show.
[03:12:56.860 --> 03:12:57.481]  What's next?
[03:12:57.541 --> 03:12:59.463]  So he's here to tell us what's going to be next.
[03:12:59.963 --> 03:13:00.424]  I can hear you.
[03:13:00.464 --> 03:13:01.285]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[03:13:01.305 --> 03:13:01.786]  I have to say,
[03:13:16.135 --> 03:13:20.179]  You know, I've done a lot of TV over the years, and I've been in this since 1980.
[03:13:20.979 --> 03:13:29.948]  Today is a great day of honor in my life, with all sincerity, to be on InfoWars on this historic day.
[03:13:29.968 --> 03:13:36.133]  Let me tell you, I have chills, Gerald, just hearing you say that.
[03:13:36.294 --> 03:13:37.134]  It is historic.
[03:13:37.234 --> 03:13:38.095]  It really is.
[03:13:38.195 --> 03:13:41.899]  We really have, I think, turned a corner in this country for the better.
[03:13:43.366 --> 03:13:44.707]  Oh, no question about it.
[03:13:44.947 --> 03:13:47.349]  And, you know, everybody knows I'm a political atheist.
[03:13:47.749 --> 03:13:49.070]  I call them the way I say them.
[03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:51.712]  And it's not... I wasn't a Trump supporter.
[03:13:52.472 --> 03:13:57.636]  We forecast, by the way, in the Trends Journal, as you guys know, back in May, that he would win.
[03:13:58.556 --> 03:14:01.219]  And so we just call things the way we see them.
[03:14:01.759 --> 03:14:04.622]  And on the Bill Maher thing, you know, look at this.
[03:14:04.682 --> 03:14:06.503]  This will really make you disgusting.
[03:14:07.564 --> 03:14:14.931]  Look at this photo of Bill Maher on the front of the Business Day Monday, January 16th, this week.
[03:14:15.411 --> 03:14:17.293]  Bill Maher isn't high on Trump.
[03:14:17.693 --> 03:14:21.236]  A full, huge page of a comic.
[03:14:21.957 --> 03:14:22.517]  A comic.
[03:14:22.857 --> 03:14:23.057]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.377 --> 03:14:24.858]  Not a great comic, a comic.
[03:14:25.458 --> 03:14:34.861]  And this is what the toilet paper, excuse me, the paper of record that I call the toilet paper of record for printing this paper that's only good for crap.
[03:14:35.581 --> 03:14:42.503]  And to put this picture on here, what, what do I care what a comic has to say?
[03:14:43.263 --> 03:14:52.146]  What are his credentials in writing and forecasting and in any kind of a sense other than being a wise guy?
[03:14:52.887 --> 03:14:55.108]  But that's what the media has become.
[03:14:55.808 --> 03:14:57.749]  And that's why everybody missed it.
[03:14:58.209 --> 03:15:00.850]  And that's why they haven't gotten over this trip yet.
[03:15:01.650 --> 03:15:09.474]  So, when we go back and we look at since Election Day, it was basically three stories that we've heard.
[03:15:10.094 --> 03:15:11.175]  The Russians are coming!
[03:15:11.215 --> 03:15:12.335]  The Russians are coming!
[03:15:12.576 --> 03:15:13.716]  The Russians are coming!
[03:15:14.357 --> 03:15:16.498]  The second story was, we're gonna have a recount!
[03:15:16.518 --> 03:15:17.258]  We're gonna have a recount!
[03:15:17.278 --> 03:15:18.198]  We're gonna have a recount!
[03:15:18.859 --> 03:15:19.919]  Hey, Electoral College!
[03:15:19.959 --> 03:15:20.920]  I don't like the Electoral College!
[03:15:22.261 --> 03:15:24.402]  That was it, and then back to the Russians.
[03:15:25.043 --> 03:15:29.406]  The major media in this country, it's not fake news.
[03:15:29.786 --> 03:15:31.867]  The New York Times is what it is.
[03:15:32.308 --> 03:15:34.229]  It's the toilet paper of record.
[03:15:34.589 --> 03:15:35.910]  It's crap news.
[03:15:36.891 --> 03:15:48.359]  So, today, I'm honored to be here because what Trump did today is he played the Trump card on not only the mainstream media that
[03:15:49.119 --> 03:15:51.260]  Just wrote him off and ridiculed him.
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:56.941]  He's also played the Trump card in the sense that it's a new game out there.
[03:15:57.821 --> 03:15:59.421]  That's what this message is.
[03:16:00.001 --> 03:16:01.882]  The Republican Party doesn't count.
[03:16:02.442 --> 03:16:04.302]  The Democratic Party doesn't count.
[03:16:04.923 --> 03:16:10.704]  The people in the CIA, he told that guy, you know, that they gave him that, that, uh,
[03:16:12.116 --> 03:16:20.419]  Lousy send-off on Sunday, he tweeted, is this the guy that, you know, sent out the fake news about the Russians?
[03:16:21.399 --> 03:16:25.721]  And him walking in front of the parade.
[03:16:26.281 --> 03:16:28.122]  He stood up like a man.
[03:16:28.142 --> 03:16:32.363]  And here's a quote for you, I believe that fits today perfectly.
[03:16:33.164 --> 03:16:38.986]  One man of courage makes a majority, Andrew Jackson.
[03:16:40.208 --> 03:16:55.233]  And we have that person today, when we break down his speech, the things that he said, it is, he, every little snowflake out there should be praising what he said.
[03:16:56.033 --> 03:16:57.994]  Other than the one, of course, he left out.
[03:16:58.654 --> 03:17:01.795]  Folks, I'm going to close Guantanamo, first day in office.
[03:17:04.575 --> 03:17:06.056]  And Gerald, I want to add a couple more things.
[03:17:06.817 --> 03:17:15.044]  Remember when Obama got elected, you saw a surge in firearm sales on the right, and you also saw talk of secessionist movements.
[03:17:16.013 --> 03:17:17.374]  Records, firearm sales.
[03:17:17.795 --> 03:17:23.539]  And now, under Trump, liberals are now buying firearms, which I think is great.
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:25.761]  More Second Amendment people, the better.
[03:17:26.442 --> 03:17:29.164]  And now California's talking about seceding.
[03:17:29.464 --> 03:17:32.266]  Oh no, what do we do without California?
[03:17:32.286 --> 03:17:33.067]  I know.
[03:17:33.948 --> 03:17:40.934]  Well, you know, well again, look at who lost, as I mentioned, in the Trends Journal and on the air.
[03:17:41.374 --> 03:17:43.215]  It wasn't that Trump only beat
[03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:46.210]  Clinton, he beat Obama.
[03:17:47.491 --> 03:17:50.152]  Because Obama can't pay more than any other president.
[03:17:50.913 --> 03:17:53.754]  He beat the mainstream media, the toilet paper of record.
[03:17:53.974 --> 03:17:54.655]  The facts are there.
[03:17:54.695 --> 03:17:56.176]  It's a content analysis.
[03:17:56.496 --> 03:17:59.557]  It's not, oh, they did or they didn't support Clinton.
[03:18:00.398 --> 03:18:03.720]  All the major newspapers, they supported her.
[03:18:03.740 --> 03:18:05.361]  Editorials were all in her favor.
[03:18:06.161 --> 03:18:07.782]  He beat the major media.
[03:18:07.802 --> 03:18:09.282]  He beat Silicon Valley.
[03:18:09.322 --> 03:18:10.482]  Let's go to California.
[03:18:11.063 --> 03:18:12.563]  He beat the Zuckerbergs.
[03:18:12.983 --> 03:18:28.068]  He beat the Eric Schmitz, as we saw with Wikileaks, when they showed that Google, with the top analytics, you know, the whole algorithms, all of Silicon Valley was behind Clinton.
[03:18:28.848 --> 03:18:29.408]  They lost.
[03:18:30.729 --> 03:18:33.250]  Not only did he beat, again, was staying in Hollywood.
[03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:34.070]  And the bankers.
[03:18:35.219 --> 03:18:37.220]  Well, let's stay in Hollywood.
[03:18:37.721 --> 03:18:39.342]  He beat the Katzenbergs.
[03:18:39.722 --> 03:18:41.363]  He beat the Spielbergs.
[03:18:41.403 --> 03:18:42.764]  He beat Hollywood.
[03:18:43.165 --> 03:18:44.846]  He beat Silicon Valley.
[03:18:44.906 --> 03:18:46.327]  He beat Hollywood.
[03:18:46.767 --> 03:18:48.228]  It's a fact, Jack.
[03:18:48.268 --> 03:18:50.510]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[03:18:50.770 --> 03:18:51.250]  The $100,000 plate
[03:18:53.852 --> 03:19:06.656]  Fundraisers for Hitlery, spending over a billion dollars, as I hear all these little liberals crying about, we have to do something about campaign financing, when she spends all this dough and loses.
[03:19:07.036 --> 03:19:10.158]  She beat Jay-Z.
[03:19:10.898 --> 03:19:13.879]  Sorry man, you got a bad rap in it.
[03:19:13.959 --> 03:19:15.219]  Didn't go jack.
[03:19:15.619 --> 03:19:17.040]  Neither you, Beyonce.
[03:19:17.380 --> 03:19:18.440]  This is important.
[03:19:19.241 --> 03:19:19.841]  He beat
[03:19:20.629 --> 03:19:22.430]  He beat Springsteen.
[03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:24.850]  He beat Bon Jovi.
[03:19:25.211 --> 03:19:26.751]  He beat De Niro.
[03:19:27.091 --> 03:19:28.572]  He beat Clooney.
[03:19:29.052 --> 03:19:31.333]  He beat the establishment.
[03:19:31.653 --> 03:19:34.694]  And that's what his speech was today.
[03:19:35.254 --> 03:19:38.995]  But let's also remember what he said in his speech, though, because, Donald, you're 100% right.
[03:19:39.035 --> 03:19:41.636]  Donald Trump did beat them, but so did Gerald Cilenti.
[03:19:42.236 --> 03:19:43.157]  So did Rob do.
[03:19:43.597 --> 03:19:46.419]  So did I. So did every person watching this right now.
[03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:50.783]  And that's why in his speech he kept saying, we, we, we.
[03:19:51.143 --> 03:19:53.665]  You, the audience, you beat these people.
[03:19:53.905 --> 03:19:55.306]  You beat the scum!
[03:19:56.888 --> 03:20:00.150]  And then you look at Obama's farewell address.
[03:20:00.190 --> 03:20:00.911]  What did he use?
[03:20:01.051 --> 03:20:01.351]  Me?
[03:20:01.751 --> 03:20:02.352]  About 6,000 times?
[03:20:02.432 --> 03:20:02.652]  Yeah.
[03:20:06.087 --> 03:20:07.108]  Let me tell you about me.
[03:20:07.128 --> 03:20:08.108]  Let me tell you about me.
[03:20:08.349 --> 03:20:08.969]  I'll tell you about me.
[03:20:08.989 --> 03:20:09.429]  Did you hear about me?
[03:20:09.449 --> 03:20:10.210]  Do you know who I am?
[03:20:10.770 --> 03:20:11.871]  I like to go on vacation.
[03:20:12.272 --> 03:20:13.252]  Did you know I was president?
[03:20:13.452 --> 03:20:14.613]  I like to play basketball.
[03:20:15.234 --> 03:20:17.015]  I like my wife, my wife who's a man.
[03:20:17.035 --> 03:20:22.739]  Hey Gerald, I'm going to let you take it away for the rest of this hour and have fun.
[03:20:23.019 --> 03:20:23.880]  It's a great day.
[03:20:24.080 --> 03:20:24.721]  We've done it.
[03:20:24.941 --> 03:20:30.705]  I think this is the best outcome we could have expected out of this presidential race.
[03:20:30.885 --> 03:20:33.007]  So thank you for joining us and take it away, sir.
[03:20:33.717 --> 03:20:37.539]  Dan, thank you for all you're doing and the whole InfoWars team.
[03:20:37.979 --> 03:20:43.181]  And again, you know, I've been on Oprah, The Today Show, Good Morning America, you name it, I've been on it many times.
[03:20:43.762 --> 03:20:53.146]  And there's no greater honor in my heart than being on InfoWars tonight on this historic day of freedom in America.
[03:20:54.164 --> 03:21:09.332]  And I say that not as empty words or making up a phrase that sounds good, but by reading the speech of Trump and listening to him, and what the direction of it was, and how he really has
[03:21:10.012 --> 03:21:24.441]  Doing what he can do as a brave man, again, walking there despite all this hatred that's been pushed upon him, and at a time when the country's supposed to unite after we elect a president, like the president or not.
[03:21:25.141 --> 03:21:37.769]  So all of these snowflakes out there, such as one of the biggest out there, Barbara Streisand, pens an essay on the clueless, reckless, graceless, mindless, and heartless Trump.
[03:21:39.534 --> 03:21:44.061]  She goes on to say, I have great respect for the experienced politicians.
[03:21:44.621 --> 03:21:46.504]  Oh, you like BS's, don't you?
[03:21:46.985 --> 03:21:48.767]  Experienced politicians.
[03:21:49.188 --> 03:21:51.411]  People that never had a job in their life.
[03:21:52.628 --> 03:21:54.009]  Telling us what to do.
[03:21:54.409 --> 03:21:56.450]  You don't like a business person in there.
[03:21:56.750 --> 03:22:02.993]  You like liars like your Obama, who lied his way into office and lied his way out.
[03:22:03.333 --> 03:22:03.673]  Folks.
[03:22:04.094 --> 03:22:07.015]  Hey, I don't have to hear that folks anymore.
[03:22:07.655 --> 03:22:08.076]  Folks.
[03:22:08.756 --> 03:22:09.036]  So?
[03:22:09.616 --> 03:22:14.039]  That's what she likes, but I want to go on here to make a very important point.
[03:22:14.339 --> 03:22:20.502]  Because tomorrow, of course, is going to be a big women's march, not only in D.C., but around the country.
[03:22:22.210 --> 03:22:26.834]  Who served our nation with sincere regard to improve and protect the Republic.
[03:22:27.174 --> 03:22:28.115]  What a joke.
[03:22:28.915 --> 03:22:31.497]  And those I have often disagreed with.
[03:22:32.178 --> 03:22:37.842]  I cannot, however, respect a racist, xenophobe, sexist who puts us all at risk with his behavior.
[03:22:38.683 --> 03:22:38.923]  Yes.
[03:22:40.064 --> 03:22:45.388]  But I love murderous liars and people with blood on their hands.
[03:22:46.269 --> 03:22:48.731]  I love a Barbara, don't you?
[03:22:48.891 --> 03:22:49.832]  Dig the cat?
[03:22:50.816 --> 03:22:54.659]  Barack, quote, I'm really good at killing people, Obama.
[03:22:55.479 --> 03:22:55.739]  Yes.
[03:22:56.620 --> 03:22:57.781]  That's not my words.
[03:22:57.841 --> 03:22:59.281]  Those are his, Ms.
[03:22:59.302 --> 03:23:00.102]  Streisand.
[03:23:00.362 --> 03:23:02.003]  But you can't listen to those.
[03:23:02.424 --> 03:23:05.746]  I guess those snowflakes are too much on your ears.
[03:23:05.826 --> 03:23:07.387]  Oh, that's in the book Double Down.
[03:23:09.025 --> 03:23:26.683]  When I said before, and I'm going to go on with Barbara Streisand first, and the hypocrisy of the liberals, making those comments that she has, oh, Barbara, hey, remember your Obama that lied his way into office as the peace...
[03:23:27.858 --> 03:23:33.800]  President, and won the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize as peace president.
[03:23:34.220 --> 03:23:44.663]  Yes, the man that as soon as he got elected sent 30,000 plus of our soldiers, men and women, to Afghanistan to fight the longest war in American history.
[03:23:45.223 --> 03:23:47.504]  Again, Afghans never did anything to us.
[03:23:47.884 --> 03:23:49.205]  It was Hayden Bin Laden!
[03:23:49.585 --> 03:23:50.405]  That's why we're gonna...
[03:23:51.596 --> 03:23:53.117]  Bomb them and stay there.
[03:23:53.358 --> 03:23:55.139]  Oh, you forgot that, didn't you, Barbara?
[03:23:55.439 --> 03:23:56.600]  Oh, I know, Barbara.
[03:23:57.081 --> 03:24:01.004]  You must be suffering from Hollywood Attention Deficit Disorder.
[03:24:02.105 --> 03:24:05.428]  You love that war, that Libyan war, didn't you?
[03:24:05.849 --> 03:24:06.189]  Yeah.
[03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:07.630]  Oh, and women, of course.
[03:24:07.950 --> 03:24:08.931]  Trump is a racist.
[03:24:09.292 --> 03:24:12.254]  And women, if only women were in charge.
[03:24:12.595 --> 03:24:14.476]  Oh, yes, like Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:15.337 --> 03:24:18.099]  Oh, you remember her, Barbara, or you didn't see that on...
[03:24:18.960 --> 03:24:33.352]  CBS, when they ask Hillary, how did you feel when you found out that Muammar Gaddafi was killed on a war based on lies started by Obama and they never did anything to us and it was the richest country and now it's turned into a hellhole?
[03:24:34.012 --> 03:24:34.933]  Oh yeah, you forgot.
[03:24:35.373 --> 03:24:36.895]  You forgot that what Hillary said.
[03:24:39.336 --> 03:24:41.838]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:24:41.858 --> 03:24:42.939]  Oh yes, a racist.
[03:24:42.959 --> 03:24:43.019]  You,
[03:24:47.984 --> 03:24:51.969]  The Streisand are a hypocrite, like the rest of you little peoples.
[03:24:52.510 --> 03:24:55.394]  Oh, yes, and if only the women were in charge!
[03:24:55.854 --> 03:24:58.037]  Yes, Samantha Powers and Susan Rice.
[03:24:58.478 --> 03:25:01.501]  Yep, they're the ones that pushed that Gaddafi war, didn't they?
[03:25:01.642 --> 03:25:03.264]  Oh, but you forgot that, didn't you?
[03:25:03.844 --> 03:25:10.607]  Yes, and only, only if we had a black president in office, it would be different, wouldn't it?
[03:25:10.687 --> 03:25:12.107]  Yeah, he wouldn't be there doing that.
[03:25:12.287 --> 03:25:13.228]  No, no, no.
[03:25:13.748 --> 03:25:15.208]  He'd be a man of the people.
[03:25:15.649 --> 03:25:17.990]  Yes, and he created all those jobs.
[03:25:18.090 --> 03:25:19.950]  Yes, you all talk about those, don't you?
[03:25:20.290 --> 03:25:20.490]  Yep.
[03:25:21.431 --> 03:25:22.571]  Almost 10 million of them.
[03:25:23.552 --> 03:25:29.854]  Yeah, of which Harvard and Princeton says their study ran total of 94% temporary jobs.
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:40.867]  I am sick and tired of people playing the gender card, the race card, and the creed card.
[03:25:42.088 --> 03:25:54.438]  Good and bad comes in all of them, so keep your arrogant, I'm-better-than-everybody-else attitude and save it for your little people who lack all the courage.
[03:25:54.458 --> 03:25:57.240]  I was mentioning before to Rob and Owen that
[03:25:58.769 --> 03:26:01.411]  You know, Trump beat Obama.
[03:26:01.831 --> 03:26:05.494]  Again, they lost the Senate, they lost the House, they lost the State Houses around the world.
[03:26:07.796 --> 03:26:11.699]  They beat, Trump beat the mainstream media.
[03:26:11.759 --> 03:26:15.462]  Again, fake news they came out with, that was an excuse because they lost so badly.
[03:26:16.428 --> 03:26:16.768]  What else?
[03:26:16.868 --> 03:26:20.210]  Well, again, he beat Silicon Valley con man.
[03:26:20.310 --> 03:26:20.790]  That's right.
[03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:25.032]  All those arrogant cats with their black shirts and their jeans.
[03:26:25.072 --> 03:26:25.332]  Yep.
[03:26:25.732 --> 03:26:26.392]  The geek look.
[03:26:26.452 --> 03:26:26.753]  Yeah.
[03:26:26.813 --> 03:26:27.953]  Better than everybody else.
[03:26:28.013 --> 03:26:29.374]  No more than everybody else.
[03:26:29.674 --> 03:26:30.734]  And we're behind Clinton.
[03:26:30.754 --> 03:26:31.595]  Hey, you guys lost.
[03:26:31.635 --> 03:26:32.235]  Capisce?
[03:26:32.475 --> 03:26:33.195]  Can you handle that?
[03:26:33.956 --> 03:26:35.216]  And of course, Hollywood lost.
[03:26:35.316 --> 03:26:43.420]  As I said, the Katzenbergs, the Spielbergs, the Bon Jovis, the entertainment industry, the Jay-Zs, you know, the rappers, the whole thing, they lost.
[03:26:44.224 --> 03:26:47.846]  The Springsteens, the De Niros, they all lost!
[03:26:49.628 --> 03:26:51.409]  And it goes back to Trump's speech.
[03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:53.150]  About we.
[03:26:54.191 --> 03:26:57.193]  About we, that Rob pointed out so eloquently.
[03:26:59.454 --> 03:27:04.278]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[03:27:05.198 --> 03:27:08.701]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[03:27:11.223 --> 03:27:12.964]  Seize the opportunity
[03:27:14.580 --> 03:27:18.002]  Opportunity comes, but at a fleeting moment, and this is it.
[03:27:19.543 --> 03:27:40.534]  I just went through that list, not to point out only what a bunch of arrogant people these people are in the media, in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood, and in both parties, but to show you what you can do to fill the vacuum.
[03:27:41.539 --> 03:27:44.840]  Look at the elegance of the Trump children.
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:46.940]  They dress their style, like them or not.
[03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:49.821]  It's a higher level.
[03:27:51.181 --> 03:27:54.102]  The people are looking for something new.
[03:27:55.282 --> 03:27:55.422]  If.
[03:27:56.642 --> 03:27:57.002]  Big if.
[03:27:59.383 --> 03:28:00.343]  Hollywood counted.
[03:28:02.603 --> 03:28:04.324]  If the music industry counted.
[03:28:04.804 --> 03:28:06.224]  If the mainstream media counted.
[03:28:07.024 --> 03:28:10.145]  And Obama and the Democratic Party and the Republican Party counted.
[03:28:11.038 --> 03:28:11.798]  Trump wouldn't have won.
[03:28:12.498 --> 03:28:13.219]  He took them all out.
[03:28:14.419 --> 03:28:19.441]  So we're saying, as trend forecasters, it's not what you like, wish, or hope for, it's what is.
[03:28:20.081 --> 03:28:21.401]  The trend is your friend.
[03:28:21.902 --> 03:28:23.862]  The people are looking for something new.
[03:28:24.482 --> 03:28:28.424]  I guess they're tired of the 76th sequel from Hollywood.
[03:28:29.584 --> 03:28:33.545]  They're tired of the bad rap and the Beyonce.
[03:28:33.645 --> 03:28:36.546]  Oh, they have a lot of people following them.
[03:28:37.207 --> 03:28:37.867]  Minuscula.
[03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:42.327]  In terms of a society of 320 million people.
[03:28:43.167 --> 03:28:44.207]  Fill the gap!
[03:28:45.707 --> 03:28:47.288]  Play the Trump card!
[03:28:48.928 --> 03:28:52.008]  One man of courage makes a majority.
[03:28:53.249 --> 03:28:57.549]  And what Trump did today, is he spoke to the majority.
[03:28:59.070 --> 03:29:05.331]  Like I've never heard in a inauguration speech in my life.
[03:29:06.533 --> 03:29:23.503]  And not only did he play to the majority, he told all those established institutions that have been robbing us of our rights and ruling us from the beltway that they don't count anymore.
[03:29:25.564 --> 03:29:33.409]  It's an overthrow of the government, in the truest sense, to restore freedom of speech
[03:29:35.558 --> 03:29:40.801]  Freedom of desire and freedom of action back to We The People.
[03:29:41.561 --> 03:29:54.549]  And it's a disgrace that they keep running stories like that boy, that mayor with his bad mouth, that the New York Times would give him almost a full-page photo.
[03:29:56.270 --> 03:29:57.291]  It's a disgrace!
[03:29:58.311 --> 03:30:02.894]  Why do I have to hear what Snoopy Dog cares about?
[03:30:04.495 --> 03:30:07.576]  Or Barbara Streisand or Cher.
[03:30:08.296 --> 03:30:09.317]  You hypocrites!
[03:30:10.277 --> 03:30:18.219]  You love your murderers, but you don't like people that want to give freedom to either people.
[03:30:18.799 --> 03:30:26.702]  Again, the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country, said Trump today.
[03:30:27.222 --> 03:30:33.284]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government.
[03:30:37.631 --> 03:30:43.377]  Transferring power for one administration.
[03:30:43.437 --> 03:30:48.222]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[03:30:48.382 --> 03:30:55.530]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[03:30:55.690 --> 03:30:58.093]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[03:30:58.553 --> 03:31:04.156]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[03:31:04.697 --> 03:31:15.023]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[03:31:15.223 --> 03:31:15.503]  Boom!
[03:31:15.923 --> 03:31:19.345]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[03:31:19.825 --> 03:31:20.986]  Then, by early 2016,
[03:31:23.047 --> 03:31:26.188]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[03:31:26.408 --> 03:31:27.488]  But the election heated up.
[03:31:27.528 --> 03:31:29.889]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:31:30.029 --> 03:31:39.272]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[03:31:39.492 --> 03:31:40.433]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[03:31:40.633 --> 03:31:44.314]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[03:31:45.114 --> 03:31:51.187]  And I'm gonna start taking it religiously again, and I'm gonna work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[03:31:51.227 --> 03:31:52.569]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[03:31:52.629 --> 03:31:56.197]  And whatever the results are, I'm gonna publish the findings.
[03:31:58.012 --> 03:31:59.833]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[03:32:00.234 --> 03:32:01.735]  I'm religiously taking the products.
[03:32:02.155 --> 03:32:04.817]  And in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[03:32:05.158 --> 03:32:11.623]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[03:32:12.043 --> 03:32:12.563]  It's amazing.
[03:32:12.844 --> 03:32:15.226]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[03:32:15.526 --> 03:32:18.208]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:32:18.428 --> 03:32:20.970]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[03:32:21.671 --> 03:32:25.674]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[03:32:25.814 --> 03:32:26.995]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[03:32:28.464 --> 03:32:31.565]  And quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[03:32:32.006 --> 03:32:33.266]  So I'm eating worse.
[03:32:33.886 --> 03:32:41.269]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[03:32:41.410 --> 03:32:41.970]  It's incredible.
[03:32:42.970 --> 03:32:44.891]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[03:32:45.131 --> 03:32:46.392]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[03:32:46.512 --> 03:32:48.913]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[03:32:49.513 --> 03:32:50.393]  This is an experiment.
[03:32:50.513 --> 03:32:51.254]  Everybody's watching.
[03:32:51.494 --> 03:32:52.334]  We'll see what happens.
[03:32:52.774 --> 03:32:53.635]  This is Part 2.
[03:32:57.762 --> 03:32:58.382]  Well, here we are.
[03:32:58.422 --> 03:32:59.503]  Another week has passed.
[03:33:00.123 --> 03:33:12.209]  If memory serves, I lost five pounds the first week, three pounds the next, and only one pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:14.170]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[03:33:14.650 --> 03:33:17.572]  I've lost a pound, so we're now up to nine pounds.
[03:33:18.604 --> 03:33:22.827]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[03:33:22.847 --> 03:33:24.408]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[03:33:24.448 --> 03:33:26.509]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[03:33:27.370 --> 03:33:32.033]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[03:33:32.574 --> 03:33:35.055]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[03:33:35.155 --> 03:33:36.756]  Let's see what happens next week.
[03:33:54.754 --> 03:34:02.957]  Ah, great to be back, and again, I want to really thank Alex Jones, Rob Dew, the whole crew, and everything that InfoWars does.
[03:34:03.257 --> 03:34:10.899]  And again, this is truly, for me, a great honor to be here tonight on this historic day of freedom in the United States.
[03:34:12.180 --> 03:34:12.740]  I believe
[03:34:14.329 --> 03:34:17.191]  What Trump said he's going to do, he will do.
[03:34:17.211 --> 03:34:27.257]  And as we all know, if he does not live up to what he said, we're not going to lay down and take it.
[03:34:27.277 --> 03:34:35.842]  I believe he is a man of courage and he didn't get to where he got to by being one of the boys and playing the game.
[03:34:37.523 --> 03:34:39.725]  So when I read his speech and listen to him,
[03:34:41.203 --> 03:34:49.085]  For too long, as I was saying before, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost.
[03:34:50.166 --> 03:34:53.307]  In every sense of the word, they start wars.
[03:34:54.207 --> 03:34:58.788]  Can you imagine, can you imagine Obama on the front lines fighting?
[03:34:59.909 --> 03:35:06.931]  But he starts a war in Libya, kills an estimated 30,000 people with that war.
[03:35:06.951 --> 03:35:10.252]  Can you imagine him leading the charge?
[03:35:12.563 --> 03:35:13.903]  People have bore the cost.
[03:35:14.984 --> 03:35:32.688]  Oh, and by the way, Barbara Streisand and all you snowflakes who miss your Obama so much, your murderer that you love so dearly, go back to when he declared war against Libya, March 2011, I believe it was, around that time.
[03:35:34.448 --> 03:35:38.249]  Actually, it was, I believe, because it was on the same day exactly
[03:35:39.394 --> 03:35:44.576]  That George W. Bush lied us into war in Iraq several years earlier, in 2003.
[03:35:44.856 --> 03:35:50.258]  I believe it was March 23rd, if my memory serves me correctly.
[03:35:51.338 --> 03:36:07.464]  Anyway, after he gave his two-bit, arrogant-toned speech, why we're going to war against Libya, again, against the Constitution as well, and Congress let him get away with it, declaring war
[03:36:08.561 --> 03:36:09.841]  Without Congress voting on it.
[03:36:10.902 --> 03:36:26.128]  Jumped on a plane, man, with Michelle and the kids, on our dime, or our couple of million dollars, and took a trip with him, his wife, his kids, and his mother-in-law, down to Rio.
[03:36:26.308 --> 03:36:29.309]  Yeah, a trip to Rio, after he starts a war.
[03:36:30.310 --> 03:36:34.634]  So when Trump says that the people bore the cost, Washington flourished.
[03:36:35.034 --> 03:36:36.955]  But the people did not share in its wealth.
[03:36:37.856 --> 03:36:42.300]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[03:36:45.722 --> 03:36:49.966]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[03:36:52.328 --> 03:36:55.210]  The triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[03:36:55.971 --> 03:36:57.612]  The victories have not been your victories.
[03:36:57.652 --> 03:36:58.513]  He said that first.
[03:36:59.218 --> 03:37:06.243]  And while they celebrate in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families across the land.
[03:37:06.843 --> 03:37:08.064]  I'm just hitting some high points.
[03:37:09.865 --> 03:37:13.227]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[03:37:14.908 --> 03:37:21.392]  Rusted out factories scattered across like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
[03:37:22.533 --> 03:37:24.835]  An education system flush with cash,
[03:37:25.796 --> 03:37:29.899]  But which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[03:37:30.339 --> 03:37:31.520]  Could not be truer.
[03:37:32.461 --> 03:37:35.383]  The education system in this country stinks.
[03:37:36.303 --> 03:37:38.625]  Oh, not a judgment, a fact.
[03:37:39.385 --> 03:37:47.691]  We don't even win place a show on OECD standards compared to other countries, the Organization of Economic Cooperation in developing countries.
[03:37:48.111 --> 03:37:50.093]  And we spend just about more than anybody else.
[03:37:52.452 --> 03:37:56.355]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.
[03:37:56.896 --> 03:37:57.396]  Yeah!
[03:37:57.736 --> 03:38:00.018]  You folks, you miss Clinton, don't you?
[03:38:00.399 --> 03:38:09.406]  Oh, and a Barbara, a Bill, all you people with Attention Deficit Disorder, you remember your liar in Chief Obama?
[03:38:09.966 --> 03:38:15.451]  When he lied his way into office as candidate Obama back in 2007 and 2008?
[03:38:15.871 --> 03:38:17.913]  But that's too far for you to remember, isn't it?
[03:38:18.393 --> 03:38:18.673]  Yeah!
[03:38:19.514 --> 03:38:28.251]  You remember him campaigning over there in the Rust Belt, saying to the folks, yeah, that I'm gonna bring back jobs and I'm gonna revisit NAFTA.
[03:38:29.226 --> 03:38:35.351]  And then, of course, he wrote about it in the Trends Journal as that was happening, because the people up there in Canada got a little tight about it.
[03:38:35.671 --> 03:38:39.835]  And he said, basically, from the Obama campaign, that's just political rhetoric.
[03:38:40.415 --> 03:38:45.299]  Yeah, and then he pushes through, or tries to, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:38:45.579 --> 03:38:48.261]  But you liberals love that, don't you, Barbara?
[03:38:48.642 --> 03:38:49.822]  Billy boy, man?
[03:38:50.543 --> 03:38:52.164]  You little hypocrites.
[03:38:53.305 --> 03:38:54.046]  Trump calls it.
[03:38:57.005 --> 03:39:00.909]  The many decades we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.
[03:39:01.489 --> 03:39:03.732]  Subsidize the armies of other countries.
[03:39:05.316 --> 03:39:08.337]  Well, allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[03:39:08.877 --> 03:39:21.379]  Now on that note, I want to make it very clear, I believe we spend more money, almost a trillion bucks, when you put all of it together with the black budgets and the intelligence agencies, I think we spend enough on the military.
[03:39:21.719 --> 03:39:30.781]  Because as you well know, I launched www.occupypeace.us and had a big rally up here with Ralph Nader, Cindy Sheehan, Dr. Robert Thurman, Gary Null and others.
[03:39:32.742 --> 03:39:45.129]  We defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own, and we spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[03:39:45.529 --> 03:39:46.049]  Exactly.
[03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:51.212]  We cannot agree with you more, and that's why I launched OccupyPeace.us.
[03:39:53.053 --> 03:39:56.075]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores.
[03:39:57.145 --> 03:40:03.191]  With not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[03:40:04.132 --> 03:40:05.593]  No, of course there wasn't a thought.
[03:40:06.314 --> 03:40:16.564]  You see, and by the way, those of you who know a little bit about my background, I used to, at a graduate school, I was the number two guy running the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York.
[03:40:17.265 --> 03:40:18.105]  Big city, about 300,000 people.
[03:40:19.912 --> 03:40:28.182]  ...was the Assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate and the Chief Government Affairs Specialist for the chemical industry from 1974 to 1979.
[03:40:30.990 --> 03:40:32.911]  In D.C., between D.C.
[03:40:32.951 --> 03:40:33.571]  and Chicago.
[03:40:34.351 --> 03:40:35.952]  So, I know how this game works.
[03:40:36.692 --> 03:40:48.176]  So when he says over here, one by one factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind, it was a sellout, folks.
[03:40:48.816 --> 03:40:49.276]  That's right.
[03:40:50.037 --> 03:40:51.997]  Biggest one by Bill Clinton with NAFTA.
[03:40:52.017 --> 03:40:54.198]  Remember that giant sucking sound?
[03:40:54.898 --> 03:40:55.098]  Yep.
[03:40:56.119 --> 03:40:56.719]  That's the one.
[03:40:58.039 --> 03:40:59.120]  It's called payoffs.
[03:41:00.319 --> 03:41:03.743]  Bribes that the politicians sold us out with.
[03:41:04.123 --> 03:41:09.248]  But in their nice language of deception, they call it campaign contributions.
[03:41:09.769 --> 03:41:11.330]  And why did Hitler lose?
[03:41:11.431 --> 03:41:18.838]  Well, thanks to WikiLeaks, showing the fraudulent activities of that wonderful Clinton Foundation that enriched them.
[03:41:18.858 --> 03:41:21.321]  Remember, they almost left the White House broke.
[03:41:21.801 --> 03:41:23.002]  According to Hillary Clinton.
[03:41:23.442 --> 03:41:28.225]  But now man, days worth of money in those hundreds of millions of dollar figures.
[03:41:28.585 --> 03:41:30.546]  Yes, that's why the factories closed.
[03:41:31.387 --> 03:41:35.909]  Trump goes on to say the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes.
[03:41:36.810 --> 03:41:39.171]  And then redistributed all across the world.
[03:41:39.891 --> 03:41:41.472]  But that is the past.
[03:41:42.093 --> 03:41:45.114]  And we are now only looking to the future.
[03:41:45.915 --> 03:41:47.496]  And people should be cheering that.
[03:41:48.882 --> 03:41:52.104]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America First.
[03:41:53.365 --> 03:42:02.432]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[03:42:03.073 --> 03:42:10.779]  We must protect our borders from ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[03:42:11.159 --> 03:42:12.380]  America First!
[03:42:13.241 --> 03:42:14.582]  I'm an America First-er.
[03:42:15.602 --> 03:42:17.424]  I put my money where my mouth is.
[03:42:18.413 --> 03:42:26.061]  Not only with Occupy Peace, I bought the most historic four buildings in the United States on the most historic four corners.
[03:42:26.081 --> 03:42:28.163]  1750, 1776, and 1763.
[03:42:28.263 --> 03:42:34.149]  The only place where there are four buildings that predate the Revolutionary War.
[03:42:42.861 --> 03:42:44.622]  Because I believe in this country.
[03:42:45.102 --> 03:42:47.983]  Because I could not be me if I was born in another country.
[03:42:48.623 --> 03:42:49.303]  Like Italy.
[03:42:50.364 --> 03:42:52.625]  My blood's Italian, but my heart's American.
[03:42:53.805 --> 03:43:00.328]  If I was born in Alta Ville, a Pena, a Vicoquense, where they're from, my parents, may all their souls rest in peace.
[03:43:02.188 --> 03:43:02.948]  That wouldn't be me.
[03:43:02.968 --> 03:43:05.189]  I'm me because I was born in the Bronx.
[03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:08.250]  And that's what Trump is doing.
[03:43:09.331 --> 03:43:11.952]  He's restoring American pride.
[03:43:13.032 --> 03:43:14.473]  That they sold us out on.
[03:43:14.493 --> 03:43:17.015]  Those little snowflakes.
[03:43:18.697 --> 03:43:21.219]  These disgusting little people criticize this.
[03:43:23.301 --> 03:43:29.466]  He goes on to say, Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[03:43:29.827 --> 03:43:32.509]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
[03:43:33.009 --> 03:43:34.410]  And I will never let you down.
[03:43:35.231 --> 03:43:40.556]  And again, he showed his courage by standing up and walking in that parade.
[03:43:42.898 --> 03:43:44.781]  And if he lets us down, we'll let him know.
[03:43:47.585 --> 03:43:49.467]  We'll follow two simple rules.
[03:43:50.248 --> 03:43:52.452]  Buy American and hire American.
[03:43:53.433 --> 03:43:55.836]  Now I go into becoming a trend forecaster.
[03:43:56.661 --> 03:44:03.687]  Anybody out there, whatever you want to do, whatever dream you have, and don't make it only from the heart.
[03:44:03.807 --> 03:44:04.928]  Make it from the mind.
[03:44:05.508 --> 03:44:06.649]  Stamp your products.
[03:44:06.709 --> 03:44:08.150]  Made in America with pride.
[03:44:08.671 --> 03:44:24.444]  Call out all these other people that are using slave labor, like Phil Knight with Nike, that becomes a billionaire using slave labor overseas to make his product, and then mark it up way beyond what it costs to manufacture it.
[03:44:25.546 --> 03:44:26.587]  Stamp your product.
[03:44:26.747 --> 03:44:28.968]  Made with pride in America.
[03:44:29.768 --> 03:44:31.409]  This is your opportunity.
[03:44:31.709 --> 03:44:34.211]  We can become a self-sustaining economy.
[03:44:34.511 --> 03:44:37.473]  We're 320 million people strong.
[03:44:37.993 --> 03:44:39.834]  Could we make our own shoes?
[03:44:40.254 --> 03:44:41.295]  Our own shirts?
[03:44:41.415 --> 03:44:42.656]  Our own computers?
[03:44:43.776 --> 03:44:44.977]  Of course we can.
[03:44:46.017 --> 03:44:50.180]  And the more jobs we have here, the stronger we become.
[03:44:51.454 --> 03:45:04.719]  And we need manufacturing jobs, not service sector jobs, like that Clinton shoved down our throat, so that we could have families and raise them and have money to retire on.
[03:45:05.799 --> 03:45:07.680]  Yeah, Bill Clinton.
[03:45:08.140 --> 03:45:11.361]  The Clintons that they're all crying about that are gone.
[03:45:13.722 --> 03:45:20.165]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America
[03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:29.129]  And through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:30.230]  That's right.
[03:45:30.831 --> 03:45:36.157]  You know, all these little gutless liberals with their key shooting grins,
[03:45:36.798 --> 03:45:42.985]  And they're balsamic smiles that talk about bi-local, bi-local.
[03:45:43.345 --> 03:45:49.172]  But boy, if you start talking about being national, oh, well, you're a populist.
[03:45:49.532 --> 03:45:50.493]  You're a racist.
[03:45:50.834 --> 03:45:52.255]  No, you're a moron.
[03:45:52.836 --> 03:45:54.418]  You're gutless little people.
[03:45:56.237 --> 03:46:13.790]  You twist things around because you lack the courage to call the person that you believe in, the Clintons and the Obamas that you're crying about that aren't there, war criminals, murderers, and thieves, robbing us of our future.
[03:46:17.553 --> 03:46:22.037]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[03:46:24.028 --> 03:46:30.051]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is thriving.
[03:46:31.512 --> 03:46:39.596]  We will no longer accept politicians or all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
[03:46:40.536 --> 03:46:41.677]  Those are some highlights.
[03:46:43.418 --> 03:46:46.099]  And now, I would like to speak about some lowlights.
[03:46:51.082 --> 03:46:53.303]  MSNBC's Chris Matthews
[03:46:54.437 --> 03:46:56.358]  Trump inauguration speech.
[03:46:57.178 --> 03:46:57.979]  Hitlerian.
[03:46:59.620 --> 03:47:00.620]  Can you imagine that?
[03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:01.621]  I just read it.
[03:47:03.061 --> 03:47:05.382]  Another little boy of nothing.
[03:47:06.643 --> 03:47:08.244]  A little clown of a man.
[03:47:08.264 --> 03:47:10.765]  With a bad attitude.
[03:47:11.646 --> 03:47:12.966]  And nothing to back it up.
[03:47:14.567 --> 03:47:15.888]  Because he's a prostitute.
[03:47:17.188 --> 03:47:18.389]  They get paid to put out.
[03:47:20.876 --> 03:47:29.727]  MSNBC's Chris Matthews said Friday that President Trump's inaugural address was both Hitlerian and meant to mimic Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[03:47:30.148 --> 03:47:33.132]  You little stupid jerk of a clown!
[03:47:33.773 --> 03:47:35.335]  You nothing of a man!
[03:47:35.355 --> 03:47:37.778]  Quote.
[03:47:39.056 --> 03:47:43.678]  When he said today, America first, it was not just racial.
[03:47:44.218 --> 03:47:46.459]  I mean, I shouldn't say racial.
[03:47:46.979 --> 03:47:48.739]  The Hitlerian background to it.
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:50.480]  But it was the message.
[03:47:50.820 --> 03:47:51.520]  I kept thinking.
[03:47:52.181 --> 03:47:53.121]  Thinking about what?
[03:47:54.021 --> 03:47:55.722]  Only a moron would write that.
[03:47:55.842 --> 03:47:56.522]  You're thinking?
[03:47:56.962 --> 03:47:59.563]  You're thinking like the little clown boy that you are.
[03:48:00.023 --> 03:48:00.343]  Oh yes.
[03:48:00.763 --> 03:48:01.444]  Come and see me.
[03:48:02.574 --> 03:48:14.279]  I'll tell you right in your face, you little jerk, you disgusting propagandist, you promoter of hate, to put that speech that I just read and call it Hitlerian.
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:23.283]  You should be fired from your job, but you won't be, because, hey, you work for the corporate job.
[03:48:24.024 --> 03:48:26.505]  Yeah, the Hawkmasters, you little prostitute.
[03:48:27.826 --> 03:48:28.526]  I will continue.
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:32.520]  He said, America first.
[03:48:33.561 --> 03:48:33.741]  Yep.
[03:48:34.361 --> 03:48:37.282]  America first is a dirty word.
[03:48:41.423 --> 03:48:43.803]  An anti-globalist, anti-militant.
[03:48:45.544 --> 03:48:46.484]  Doesn't fit well.
[03:48:48.925 --> 03:48:49.485]  With little.
[03:48:52.946 --> 03:48:57.467]  Chris Matthews, former speechwriter, Jimmy Carter.
[03:48:58.187 --> 03:48:58.367]  Yeah.
[03:48:59.875 --> 03:49:02.535]  This is the same Chris Matthews, by the way.
[03:49:03.156 --> 03:49:06.556]  Let's go back to Obama days, when he was so happy.
[03:49:06.576 --> 03:49:12.897]  Yep, got the proof right here that this guy is the nothing of a man.
[03:49:14.678 --> 03:49:20.439]  I have to tell you, you know, remember this is going back, back to the 2008 presidential time.
[03:49:21.259 --> 03:49:26.320]  I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election,
[03:49:27.401 --> 03:49:38.049]  The feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech, Matthew said, quote, my, I felt this thrill going up my leg.
[03:49:38.069 --> 03:49:42.052]  I mean, I don't have that too often.
[03:49:43.613 --> 03:49:45.855]  Not my words, his off, his words.
[03:49:46.155 --> 03:49:51.459]  Oh, you don't have that, that thrill going up your leg because you have nothing up there.
[03:49:52.480 --> 03:49:54.281]  Nothing, little boy, that big.
[03:49:55.953 --> 03:49:59.556]  In the size of cojones of smaller than a mothball.
[03:50:00.376 --> 03:50:01.677]  Your words, not mine.
[03:50:01.977 --> 03:50:02.858]  And it gets worse.
[03:50:03.879 --> 03:50:16.067]  Rather than them cheering that President Trump wants to make America first and put our needs before the world's, that's Hitlerian.
[03:50:16.568 --> 03:50:17.688]  Well, this is hilarious.
[03:50:19.390 --> 03:50:21.471]  It was militant and it was dark.
[03:50:21.691 --> 03:50:22.492]  Rachel Maddow,
[03:50:24.266 --> 03:50:26.468]  Says Trump's speech was hard to hear.
[03:50:26.968 --> 03:50:27.188]  Yep.
[03:50:29.290 --> 03:50:29.770]  That's right.
[03:50:30.230 --> 03:50:31.952]  Can't hear anything that you don't like.
[03:50:33.573 --> 03:50:34.914]  Quote, it was militant.
[03:50:35.434 --> 03:50:36.195]  It was dark.
[03:50:37.456 --> 03:50:41.899]  The crime, the gangs, the drugs, this American change, this respire.
[03:50:43.881 --> 03:50:44.361]  Decay.
[03:50:44.861 --> 03:50:48.244]  You can't imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that.
[03:50:49.767 --> 03:50:53.809]  Of course you can't imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that.
[03:50:54.249 --> 03:50:58.831]  Because the outgoing president was nothing but BS, folks.
[03:50:59.892 --> 03:51:02.693]  Yeah, gonna close Guantanamo, first day in office.
[03:51:03.773 --> 03:51:04.654]  Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:51:04.954 --> 03:51:09.576]  Oh, oh, Bob Ristreifstand, Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews.
[03:51:09.596 --> 03:51:13.938]  Hey, you know one of the last things Obama signed last week?
[03:51:14.939 --> 03:51:17.400]  Giving the NSA more rights to spy on us.
[03:51:18.424 --> 03:51:19.645]  Oh, you forgot that, didn't you?
[03:51:20.205 --> 03:51:23.666]  Oh, you forgot the 2011 Patriot Act.
[03:51:24.647 --> 03:51:24.807]  Yep.
[03:51:25.227 --> 03:51:26.768]  National Defense Authorization Act.
[03:51:27.648 --> 03:51:29.749]  That robbed us of our habeas corpus rights.
[03:51:29.769 --> 03:51:34.971]  That gives this clown of an arrogant boy, Obama, a nothing of a man.
[03:51:34.991 --> 03:51:38.833]  And no, boy isn't racist.
[03:51:39.153 --> 03:51:43.675]  You just heard me call Chris Matthews a guy out with no boy at all in him.
[03:51:44.276 --> 03:51:45.016]  So save it!
[03:51:47.765 --> 03:51:51.168]  An arrogant, arrogant president who lied his way into office.
[03:51:53.009 --> 03:52:03.337]  Robbing us of our habeas corpus rights so he could drone strike anybody that he wants, and did so, killing over 4,000 innocent people according to human rights.
[03:52:08.461 --> 03:52:10.883]  You have Attention Deficit Disorder.
[03:52:11.103 --> 03:52:11.583]  No, it's not.
[03:52:11.804 --> 03:52:14.225]  It's lack of courage and you're a bunch of hypocrites.
[03:52:15.807 --> 03:52:17.348]  Rachel Maddow goes on to say,
[03:52:20.882 --> 03:52:25.343]  That Trump's speech was reminiscent of nationalistic trends in America around World War II.
[03:52:27.304 --> 03:52:31.525]  Quote, the American First Committee is something that means a specific thing in this country.
[03:52:31.905 --> 03:52:33.205]  Oh yeah, we all know about that.
[03:52:33.826 --> 03:52:34.606]  What are you talking about?
[03:52:37.367 --> 03:52:42.468]  To repurpose it now, not that far down the historical path, it's hard.
[03:52:43.028 --> 03:52:43.908]  It's hard to hear.
[03:52:44.829 --> 03:52:45.989]  You, Ms.
[03:52:46.109 --> 03:52:49.410]  Maddow, are a traitor to America!
[03:52:50.745 --> 03:52:52.426]  I am an American firster.
[03:52:52.847 --> 03:52:55.928]  You are a sellout that loved war.
[03:52:56.309 --> 03:53:04.634]  Where were all you people that protested against Bush when Obamas and the Clintons were bombs away across the Middle East?
[03:53:04.994 --> 03:53:06.395]  Assad has to go.
[03:53:06.695 --> 03:53:08.256]  Qaddafi has to go.
[03:53:08.596 --> 03:53:09.737]  You have to go.
[03:53:10.057 --> 03:53:12.718]  And all of you fake news media.
[03:53:14.659 --> 03:53:16.040]  And it's not only her.
[03:53:17.681 --> 03:53:18.622]  It's not only
[03:53:22.150 --> 03:53:23.431]  That part of the media.
[03:53:27.112 --> 03:53:28.973]  It's one after another.
[03:53:30.834 --> 03:53:32.635]  USA Today, today.
[03:53:33.935 --> 03:53:43.460]  Perhaps it should be no surprise that the presidential candidate, whose campaign was unprecedented, in so many ways would deliver an inaugural address that was as well.
[03:53:44.480 --> 03:53:46.081]  In his first words to the nation,
[03:53:47.472 --> 03:54:03.942]  And the world, after being sworn in, President Trump on Friday delivered a populist manifesto that depicted the United States as a land of abandoned factories, economic angst, rising crime, and dystopian carnage.
[03:54:04.863 --> 03:54:08.105]  He promised a new era in politics.
[03:54:08.585 --> 03:54:12.388]  Well, it's not a populist manifesto.
[03:54:13.649 --> 03:54:25.596]  It's an intelligent speech, but you have to label it because it doesn't fit into your little minds of Republican, Democrat, left and right, which doesn't exist.
[03:54:27.437 --> 03:54:38.144]  He goes on to say the primary message in his speech, however, was designed to appeal to the Americans who voted for him and included little to reach out to those who didn't.
[03:54:39.265 --> 03:54:39.525]  What?
[03:54:41.506 --> 03:54:42.567]  What is he supposed to say?
[03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:49.243]  He's saying that he's going to do everything he can to make this country strive again.
[03:54:50.426 --> 03:54:51.809]  To bring our economy back.
[03:54:53.561 --> 03:55:07.032]  The speech was reminiscent of the apocalyptic language he used in his acceptance address at the Republican National Convention, claiming a nomination that few had expected him to win.
[03:55:07.532 --> 03:55:09.874]  Let's get this straight, USA Today!
[03:55:10.375 --> 03:55:14.238]  We called you personally to tell you that we forecast it.
[03:55:14.578 --> 03:55:18.982]  You would not write what we wrote because we do not fit into your
[03:55:19.974 --> 03:55:21.675]  A little club, yes.
[03:55:22.855 --> 03:55:24.236]  Because we're not prostitutes.
[03:55:27.977 --> 03:55:32.419]  By the way, USA Today used to run my top trends for years.
[03:55:34.019 --> 03:55:39.862]  But then when they didn't like, when I didn't fit into their little minds, it was too much for them to handle.
[03:55:40.682 --> 03:55:43.063]  And again, we contacted them.
[03:55:43.123 --> 03:55:48.405]  Derrick Osinenko, the CEO of the Trends Research Institute,
[03:55:49.346 --> 03:55:52.988]  Was the former editor-in-chief of Gannett News Service.
[03:55:53.448 --> 03:55:53.649]  Yes.
[03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:55.790]  The one that owns USA Today.
[03:55:56.330 --> 03:55:58.031]  So it's not like we don't know people there.
[03:55:58.452 --> 03:56:01.894]  They did not want to hear what we had to say, what we call Trump a winner.
[03:56:02.154 --> 03:56:08.538]  So they throw out this little two-bit line that few had expected him to win.
[03:56:09.038 --> 03:56:09.278]  Yeah.
[03:56:09.718 --> 03:56:10.039]  Few?
[03:56:11.499 --> 03:56:11.700]  No.
[03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:17.863]  Those of us that had big minds and are not in a little bubble, we saw it.
[03:56:18.504 --> 03:56:18.804]  Anyway?
[03:56:21.573 --> 03:56:26.795]  It had less in common with his relatively conciliatory remarks on election night, blah blah blah blah.
[03:56:27.395 --> 03:56:32.837]  Victorious in his first bid for public office, Trump has become the first president in U.S.
[03:56:32.857 --> 03:56:38.580]  history to lack government or military command experience.
[03:56:39.380 --> 03:56:39.940]  So what?
[03:56:41.361 --> 03:56:42.041]  That's a plus.
[03:56:45.439 --> 03:56:47.481]  And he eschewed political correctness.
[03:56:47.541 --> 03:56:48.002]  That's right.
[03:56:48.362 --> 03:56:51.366]  Because there's nothing correct about politics.
[03:56:52.066 --> 03:56:53.808]  Again, as he pointed out.
[03:56:55.470 --> 03:56:58.834]  These are people with lifelong jobs that only enrich themselves.
[03:56:58.874 --> 03:57:00.616]  They're sociopaths and psychopaths.
[03:57:01.988 --> 03:57:13.592]  Now remember, this is from USA Today, and has mired in controversies over everything from his behavior toward women to his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[03:57:14.112 --> 03:57:15.333]  He's supposed to hate Putin.
[03:57:19.314 --> 03:57:23.635]  He didn't express appreciation for anything Obama actually did during his presidency.
[03:57:23.695 --> 03:57:30.478]  For instance, for working to avert a depression after taking over amid financial calamity.
[03:57:31.218 --> 03:57:31.478]  Okay.
[03:57:35.779 --> 03:57:43.484]  What he did, USA Today, is Obama declared a war against we the savers, the little people.
[03:57:43.504 --> 03:57:52.509]  With the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and keeping them low for nearly a decade at zero interest rate policy, a war against the savers.
[03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:55.911]  He boosted, Obama did, the equity markets.
[03:57:58.479 --> 03:58:08.123]  He boosted them to the point where corporate profits rose 166%, while real wages increased a grand total of 3.4%.
[03:58:08.783 --> 03:58:11.144]  But those are only facts, USA Today.
[03:58:11.164 --> 03:58:26.330]  And of course, Trump, he did not express appreciation for Obama's lies of no boots on the ground back in Iraq, no boots on the ground in Syria.
[03:58:28.752 --> 03:58:36.958]  He didn't express Obama's appreciation for lying and telling us that we'd be out of Afghanistan by 2014.
[03:58:37.698 --> 03:58:42.782]  And here it is, 2017 and 10,000 troops there.
[03:58:43.563 --> 03:58:44.343]  Bombs away.
[03:58:44.363 --> 03:58:48.586]  Oh, they just killed 33 people several weeks ago.
[03:58:48.906 --> 03:58:50.187]  It was only collateral damage.
[03:58:53.530 --> 03:58:57.953]  That's the hypocrisy spewing out of USA Today.
[03:59:00.100 --> 03:59:06.703]  Trump's remarks were rebuked not only to the outgoing Democratic administration in particular, but to the Washington establishment in general.
[03:59:07.484 --> 03:59:07.924]  That's right.
[03:59:09.085 --> 03:59:10.345]  It's a new day is dawning.
[03:59:12.826 --> 03:59:20.450]  The policies he stole were more populist and nationalistic than they were conservative, potentially creating heartburn among GOP congressional leaders.
[03:59:20.730 --> 03:59:21.431]  He doesn't care.
[03:59:21.451 --> 03:59:23.492]  They didn't support him before he got in.
[03:59:23.992 --> 03:59:24.732]  He doesn't need them.
[03:59:25.253 --> 03:59:26.313]  He needs we, the people.
[03:59:27.094 --> 03:59:28.074]  And that's who he has.
[03:59:28.815 --> 03:59:29.435]  Up to this point.
[03:59:30.523 --> 03:59:40.731]  The picture he painted of a nation he will now lead was dire, despite an economy that is in recovery and an unemployment rate that is low by historic standards.
[03:59:41.051 --> 03:59:42.112]  This is propaganda.
[03:59:42.132 --> 03:59:43.133]  This is fake news.
[03:59:43.493 --> 03:59:44.574]  By historic standards?
[03:59:44.854 --> 03:59:56.043]  By historic standards, we have an unemployment non-participation rate that goes back to 1970s, when women were not in the workforce.
[03:59:58.288 --> 04:00:03.930]  We have the jobs created, as I said, according to Harvard Princeton study.
[04:00:06.351 --> 04:00:09.472]  94% of them are temporary jobs.
[04:00:11.593 --> 04:00:15.774]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now, Trump ended with.
[04:00:17.595 --> 04:00:20.556]  Too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
[04:00:25.822 --> 04:00:32.505]  May you achieve the greatest success that you can for the future of all of we the people.
[04:00:32.745 --> 04:00:33.366]  Thank you, Mr. Trump.
[04:00:53.115 --> 04:00:54.815]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[04:02:15.301 --> 04:02:19.083]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.

[04:02:23.326 --> 04:02:25.367]  That I will faithfully execute.
[04:02:26.008 --> 04:02:28.189]  That I will faithfully execute.
[04:02:28.409 --> 04:02:31.091]  The office of President of the United States.
[04:02:31.471 --> 04:02:34.414]  The office of President of the United States.
[04:02:34.834 --> 04:02:36.796]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[04:02:37.296 --> 04:02:39.478]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[04:02:39.858 --> 04:02:41.920]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[04:02:42.341 --> 04:02:44.162]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[04:02:44.443 --> 04:02:46.424]  The Constitution of the United States.
[04:02:46.564 --> 04:02:48.926]  The Constitution of the United States.
[04:02:49.067 --> 04:02:49.907]  So help me God.
[04:02:50.128 --> 04:02:50.988]  So help me God.
[04:02:51.509 --> 04:02:52.730]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[04:04:01.181 --> 04:04:11.552]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[04:04:37.714 --> 04:04:52.282]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[04:04:58.007 --> 04:05:11.717]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[04:05:13.839 --> 04:05:21.705]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[04:05:23.228 --> 04:05:24.829]  We will face challenges.
[04:05:25.449 --> 04:05:27.090]  We will confront hardships.
[04:05:27.730 --> 04:05:29.811]  But we will get the job done.
[04:05:31.212 --> 04:05:37.415]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[04:05:38.553 --> 04:05:49.298]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[04:05:49.959 --> 04:05:52.260]  They have been magnificent.
[04:05:52.580 --> 04:05:53.040]  Thank you.
[04:06:00.504 --> 04:06:02.005]  Today's ceremony, however,
[04:06:02.881 --> 04:06:04.822]  Has very special meaning.
[04:06:05.722 --> 04:06:11.864]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[04:06:12.524 --> 04:06:14.104]  Or from one party to another.
[04:06:14.785 --> 04:06:18.906]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[04:06:19.466 --> 04:06:22.567]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[04:06:35.806 --> 04:06:38.347]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[04:06:38.387 --> 04:06:39.707]  It's not true!
[04:06:40.167 --> 04:06:43.088]  That's impossible!
[04:06:43.408 --> 04:06:44.649]  Search your feelings.
[04:06:44.849 --> 04:06:46.409]  You know it to be true.
[04:06:46.749 --> 04:06:47.509]  Well, what a day.
[04:07:04.107 --> 04:07:11.230]  It's great to be, again, part of this ceremony of freedom that's being celebrated today.
[04:07:11.250 --> 04:07:20.534]  An inauguration speech that, by every definition of the words, brings it back to, we the people.
[04:07:21.214 --> 04:07:22.655]  Never heard one like it before.
[04:07:23.475 --> 04:07:28.838]  Yet, the snowflakes out there keep trying to demean
[04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:34.732]  What Trump is saying and they're fighting against everything that he's doing.
[04:07:34.752 --> 04:07:47.881]  The nation, that magazine, is supposed to be a progressive magazine that fully supported Hillary Clinton despite her war record, which they just blank out.
[04:07:49.722 --> 04:07:55.246]  This is the headline coming out of the nation today that hit my email.
[04:07:56.767 --> 04:07:59.569]  Throw sand in the gears of everything.
[04:08:01.069 --> 04:08:05.852]  When it comes to stopping Trump, petitions aren't going to do it.
[04:08:07.553 --> 04:08:12.996]  As many are saying, we woke up from a nightmare to find it was our new reality.
[04:08:13.877 --> 04:08:18.299]  A gaggle of inflated far-right self-promoters and operatives.
[04:08:18.860 --> 04:08:20.421]  Big business in their toadies.
[04:08:21.240 --> 04:08:27.242]  And the homegrown fascists will control and determine the Supreme Court majority.
[04:08:27.742 --> 04:08:29.283]  Maybe for a generation or more.
[04:08:29.683 --> 04:08:33.184]  And this clown goes on to write this disgusting crap.
[04:08:34.885 --> 04:08:35.565]  The nation?
[04:08:36.026 --> 04:08:36.726]  What nation?
[04:08:38.446 --> 04:08:39.787]  The snowflake nation.
[04:08:40.747 --> 04:08:47.550]  The quiche-eating, grin, balsamic-smiled, courageous liberals who support their murderer-in-chiefs.
[04:08:52.213 --> 04:08:52.954]  These are facts.
[04:08:56.216 --> 04:08:59.938]  This is from our Trends Journal, current edition.
[04:09:01.139 --> 04:09:02.420]  Written right after the election.
[04:09:04.641 --> 04:09:09.524]  Because this clown of a man, a nothing little boy again who wrote this, I don't know his name here.
[04:09:12.166 --> 04:09:13.627]  Far-right self-promoters.
[04:09:16.069 --> 04:09:17.590]  Yeah, from the Trends Journal, written
[04:09:19.150 --> 04:09:19.971]  Whiter than white.
[04:09:20.992 --> 04:09:35.543]  And as evidenced by polling data, the myth that reactionary white working class men elected Trump continues to be perpetrated by the prostitute media and promoted by anti-Trump demonstrations that erupted following his election.
[04:09:36.324 --> 04:09:43.369]  In fact, Trump received about the same number of white male votes as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:45.751]  You stupid little guy.
[04:09:48.891 --> 04:09:50.192]  Hateful little man.
[04:09:50.212 --> 04:09:59.080]  The Nation, a nothing magazine with arrogant people that support murderers.
[04:09:59.540 --> 04:10:01.882]  Hey, they're my murderers and they're okay.
[04:10:03.083 --> 04:10:03.744]  To continue...
[04:10:05.396 --> 04:10:19.665]  And despite Hillary Clinton playing the first woman to be elected president gender card since she launched her campaign in the spring of 2015, she received 2 million fewer votes from women than Obama did in 2012.
[04:10:20.546 --> 04:10:22.747]  Alright?
[04:10:24.548 --> 04:10:24.888]  No.
[04:10:25.929 --> 04:10:27.650]  Not what you wrote in The Nation.
[04:10:28.230 --> 04:10:30.252]  The women didn't like her either.
[04:10:31.392 --> 04:10:31.993]  Matter of fact,
[04:10:35.333 --> 04:10:40.435]  More importantly, just 30% of eligible women cast their ballots for Clinton.
[04:10:41.135 --> 04:10:48.497]  Barbara Streisand, and all you women that are marching out there, they didn't like your Hitler-y.
[04:10:48.978 --> 04:10:50.058]  Wonder why?
[04:10:51.418 --> 04:10:54.199]  Compared to 47% who did not vote.
[04:10:55.400 --> 04:11:00.161]  Also, some 2 million black voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012.
[04:11:02.369 --> 04:11:04.491]  Did not cast ballots for Clinton.
[04:11:05.232 --> 04:11:05.932]  Ah, yeah.
[04:11:06.332 --> 04:11:07.113]  Wonder why.
[04:11:07.133 --> 04:11:11.037]  I guess they remember Bill Clinton's getting tough on crime.
[04:11:11.317 --> 04:11:16.101]  That threw them all in jail for little minor violations of the law.
[04:11:16.181 --> 04:11:17.362]  Three strikes, you're out.
[04:11:17.722 --> 04:11:20.124]  Wonder why they don't like the Clintons.
[04:11:20.765 --> 04:11:22.847]  Well.
[04:11:22.867 --> 04:11:22.927]  And?
[04:11:24.708 --> 04:11:25.269]  Overall?
[04:11:27.861 --> 04:11:33.867]  Clinton received about 10 million fewer votes than candidate Obama did when he first ran in 2008.
[04:11:35.448 --> 04:11:43.175]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Knight.
[04:11:44.176 --> 04:11:44.777]  Thank you, Gerald.
[04:11:44.797 --> 04:11:45.658]  I've been listening to you.
[04:11:45.698 --> 04:11:50.703]  You did a great job of breaking this down, talking about the speech and, you know, you were talking about the reactions of
[04:11:51.496 --> 04:12:02.718]  Various journalists and we had that clip at the top of the hour where you had the Star Wars clip and you had Luke Skywalker going, no, and it fades out into the primal scream of the protester there.
[04:12:03.138 --> 04:12:05.179]  Gerald, they've got an article up on the Hill.
[04:12:05.739 --> 04:12:09.519]  Joe Scarborough said Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address.
[04:12:09.659 --> 04:12:12.460]  It was a primal scream aimed at Washington.
[04:12:12.680 --> 04:12:17.501]  I think the people who were doing the primal screaming are those snowflakes like we see right there in that clip, don't you think?
[04:12:18.220 --> 04:12:20.821]  What a clown, Joe Scarborough.
[04:12:21.361 --> 04:12:24.423]  Why would, again, why would anybody listen to the losers?
[04:12:24.703 --> 04:12:25.743]  You guys lost.
[04:12:25.763 --> 04:12:27.024]  Did you get it in your head?
[04:12:27.624 --> 04:12:28.424]  You're losers.
[04:12:28.864 --> 04:12:32.206]  It was the best speech I've ever heard in my life.
[04:12:33.095 --> 04:12:33.515]  I loved it.
[04:12:33.535 --> 04:12:38.398]  You know, one of the things, one of the people that came out and talked about it was Piers Morgan.
[04:12:38.558 --> 04:12:40.600]  He doesn't necessarily take one side or the other on it.
[04:12:40.640 --> 04:12:44.022]  Piers Morgan, except for guns, I think, likes Donald Trump because he knows him personally.
[04:12:44.062 --> 04:12:49.765]  He said, you took a massive fist and you clunked it down on the rain-splattered D.C.
[04:12:49.865 --> 04:12:53.127]  establishment as they sat just yards away.
[04:12:53.488 --> 04:12:59.211]  You only spoke for 10 minutes, but that was long enough to pound them into stupefied, eye-bulging silence.
[04:12:59.972 --> 04:13:01.833]  That's a pretty good summary right there, don't you?
[04:13:02.549 --> 04:13:03.450]  It's excellent.
[04:13:03.991 --> 04:13:10.159]  And again, for people to understand, there are profit opportunities as well.
[04:13:10.499 --> 04:13:12.041]  It's a whole new America.
[04:13:12.502 --> 04:13:13.463]  Take advantage of it.
[04:13:13.803 --> 04:13:14.644]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[04:13:14.684 --> 04:13:16.046]  Thank you so much, Gerald Salenti.
[04:13:16.567 --> 04:13:19.871]  Trends Journal, that's TrendsJournal.com, is that their website?
[04:13:20.560 --> 04:13:23.101]  TrendsJournal.com or TrendsResearch.com.
[04:13:23.361 --> 04:13:29.802]  And thank you so much for all that everyone at InfoWars does, and it was really a great honor for me to be here today.
[04:13:29.842 --> 04:13:30.242]  Thank you.
[04:13:30.422 --> 04:13:30.862]  Thank you.
[04:13:31.702 --> 04:13:32.282]  Excellent job.
[04:13:32.342 --> 04:13:32.843]  Thank you so much.
[04:13:32.883 --> 04:13:35.563]  And that is an excellent journal, if you haven't looked at that.
[04:13:35.623 --> 04:13:37.123]  That is TrendsJournal.
[04:13:37.223 --> 04:13:39.024]  Gerald is really on top of the trends.
[04:13:39.064 --> 04:13:41.144]  And of course, one of the trends is the prostitute media.
[04:13:41.644 --> 04:13:44.585]  And clearly, that literally came true as well, as we saw
[04:13:45.505 --> 04:13:49.326]  Snopes outed as literal prostitutes.
[04:13:49.346 --> 04:13:57.529]  We got, after the divorce, we find that one of them is working as an escort, the other one is continually working as a dominatrix or whatever.
[04:13:57.569 --> 04:14:00.510]  These are the people who are going to vet your news for Facebook.
[04:14:00.530 --> 04:14:02.871]  They're going to say what's true and what isn't true.
[04:14:03.011 --> 04:14:10.573]  And I guess, you know, hey, if we're going to let the State Department do it, we might as well let these prostitutes, the prostitutes at Snopes, do it.
[04:14:10.653 --> 04:14:11.833]  That's the other part of it.
[04:14:11.873 --> 04:14:13.754]  But let's take a look at what Obama says.
[04:14:13.854 --> 04:14:16.776]  Because, you know, he wasn't the only one to comment on the speeches.
[04:14:17.717 --> 04:14:32.589]  He, and also on the transition of power, as he was leaving for his last taxpayer-paid vacation to fly to California on Air Force One, they now call it Special Air Mission 28,000 because, you know, Air Force One is reserved just for the president.
[04:14:33.390 --> 04:14:40.916]  But he said to his supporters that Donald Trump was going to be a comma in the continuing story of building America.
[04:14:41.016 --> 04:14:41.216]  Really?
[04:14:42.233 --> 04:14:44.295]  You know, I think Obama is a brief period.
[04:14:44.335 --> 04:14:45.756]  He's a costly period.
[04:14:46.617 --> 04:14:51.822]  It's a period of bankruptcy, morally, ethically, and financially.
[04:14:51.862 --> 04:15:04.132]  When we look at what he has left the United States, this article from CNS News, it's up on the Drudge Report, Obama leaves the USA over nine trillion dollars deeper, deeper in debt.
[04:15:04.353 --> 04:15:08.796]  And listen to this, the amount that he increased the debt, the increased amount,
[04:15:09.457 --> 04:15:09.978]  That's Obama's legacy.
[04:15:09.998 --> 04:15:10.438]  A legacy of debt.
[04:15:28.450 --> 04:15:31.213]  A legacy of death, as Gerald Solenti was talking about.
[04:15:31.253 --> 04:15:33.395]  The wars that Obama has.
[04:15:33.475 --> 04:15:36.198]  He inherited four wars and then he added three more to it.
[04:15:36.938 --> 04:15:46.567]  He's the only president that we've had so far, and let's hope that he is the last president in America, that served his entire term as a war president.
[04:15:47.321 --> 04:15:49.863]  So he's left a legacy of debt.
[04:15:50.264 --> 04:15:51.805]  He's left a legacy of death.
[04:15:52.526 --> 04:15:54.208]  And he's left a legacy of division.
[04:15:54.248 --> 04:15:58.432]  But of course, the military-industrial complex and the globalist elite love him.
[04:15:58.632 --> 04:16:00.494]  They love the warfare state.
[04:16:01.214 --> 04:16:02.495]  They love the welfare state.
[04:16:02.816 --> 04:16:03.957]  That's how they get their power.
[04:16:04.818 --> 04:16:09.162]  To show you a difference here, we've got this wartime president, as Gerald Solenti was talking about, the nation.
[04:16:11.147 --> 04:16:21.871]  Endorsing Hillary Clinton, the people who say that they are against warfare, the people who say they are for civil liberties, doing that, it's absolutely amazing, head-spinning to see that, and you know what?
[04:16:22.271 --> 04:16:23.391]  We are not going to do that.
[04:16:23.631 --> 04:16:31.594]  If Donald Trump starts to do the sorts of things and continues to do the sorts of things that Barack Obama has done, we will speak out against that.
[04:16:32.828 --> 04:16:34.349]  And let's hope that that doesn't happen.
[04:16:34.369 --> 04:16:38.890]  But I want you to look at this difference between Donald Trump and Barack Obama.
[04:16:39.331 --> 04:16:41.051]  And this is an article from the Tribunist.
[04:16:41.631 --> 04:16:47.454]  One small difference between how Trump and Obama handled the review of the troops.
[04:16:47.774 --> 04:16:52.555]  Now, they show this picture and Donald Trump is returning a salute.
[04:16:53.076 --> 04:16:55.577]  And then, of course, if you remember, Barack Obama never did that.
[04:16:56.377 --> 04:16:57.517]  He never saluted the troops.
[04:16:57.557 --> 04:16:58.858]  He always put his hand over his heart.
[04:16:59.667 --> 04:16:59.907]  I don't know.
[04:17:17.711 --> 04:17:19.552]  And a barracks bombing in Lebanon.
[04:17:19.993 --> 04:17:21.154]  He said, this is ridiculous.
[04:17:21.174 --> 04:17:22.455]  We're not going to leave them here.
[04:17:22.755 --> 04:17:24.096]  This is a war that we don't need.
[04:17:24.136 --> 04:17:26.298]  And he pulled those troops out because he respected their lives.
[04:17:26.778 --> 04:17:32.843]  Barack Obama, on the other hand, did not respect them enough, not only to just, that's a gesture, okay?
[04:17:33.543 --> 04:17:36.185]  To salute or to not salute, that is a gesture.
[04:17:37.246 --> 04:17:44.231]  But it says more about Barack Obama, quite frankly, that he would send them off to fight in useless wars.
[04:17:44.391 --> 04:17:47.314]  To fight and die and to kill in useless wars.
[04:17:48.228 --> 04:17:50.189]  And that's really what Barack Obama has done.
[04:17:50.209 --> 04:17:58.154]  Now, when the New York Times talked about this, they said presidents have long been saluted, but they began returning salutes relatively recently.
[04:17:58.214 --> 04:18:00.255]  They said Ronald Reagan was thought to be the first in 1981.
[04:18:00.355 --> 04:18:05.138]  He sought advice on the matter from General Robert Barrow, Commandant of the Marine Corps.
[04:18:05.598 --> 04:18:15.140]  According to John Klein, then Mr. Reagan's military aide, and today a member of Congress in Minnesota, General Barrow told the President that as Commander-in-Chief he could salute anybody that he wished.
[04:18:15.200 --> 04:18:16.160]  And so it began.
[04:18:16.260 --> 04:18:21.161]  And every President after him continued to do that until Barack Obama.
[04:18:21.181 --> 04:18:26.402]  He just couldn't bring himself to show that kind of respect to the troops.
[04:18:27.643 --> 04:18:29.883]  And he couldn't bring himself to respect their lives.
[04:18:30.808 --> 04:18:31.909]  And so that's what we are left with.
[04:18:31.969 --> 04:18:39.975]  We're left with a president who could not salute the troops, but would keep us at war for the entire eight years that he is president.
[04:18:40.295 --> 04:18:47.161]  Now, as we look at this speech, some people have said, well, you know, it's a very short speech, very short, punchy, powerful speech.
[04:18:47.181 --> 04:18:48.422]  You know, it was only two words longer.
[04:18:49.164 --> 04:18:51.745]  Then George Washington's first inaugural address.
[04:18:52.045 --> 04:19:01.647]  George Washington's second inaugural address was about one-tenth the length of his first and Donald Trump's first inaugural address.
[04:19:01.867 --> 04:19:03.367]  He only had 135 words.
[04:19:03.407 --> 04:19:06.108]  The first inaugural address of George Washington was 1431.
[04:19:06.708 --> 04:19:08.248]  Trump's was 1433.
[04:19:09.688 --> 04:19:13.729]  But when George Washington did the second inaugural address, he only used about 135 words.
[04:19:13.789 --> 04:19:14.229]  And you know what?
[04:19:14.930 --> 04:19:16.090]  If Donald Trump does,
[04:19:17.503 --> 04:19:24.627]  What he said he will do, if he makes America great, if he gives us jobs, if he gives us peace, he can make that really short.
[04:19:24.667 --> 04:19:26.909]  He can just say, I made America great again.
[04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.569]  Thanks.
[04:19:28.310 --> 04:19:30.431]  If we go for another four years, we're going to make it even better.
[04:19:30.671 --> 04:19:31.872]  I mean, it could be just that simple.
[04:19:32.332 --> 04:19:35.454]  If we look at the other extreme, we've got William Henry Harrison.
[04:19:35.574 --> 04:19:36.295]  8460 words.
[04:19:36.555 --> 04:19:38.736]  That guy just couldn't shut up.
[04:19:39.397 --> 04:19:41.318]  His speech was about as long as his name.
[04:19:42.018 --> 04:19:47.603]  If you look at Barack Obama, of course, his speeches most recently were about 50% longer than Donald Trump's.
[04:19:47.763 --> 04:19:54.769]  I guess it was all of those I's, me's, Obama, you know, all of his references to himself.
[04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:57.031]  I guess that made it about 50% longer.
[04:19:57.411 --> 04:19:59.273]  Now today we also had some veterans.
[04:19:59.833 --> 04:20:00.714]  They were protesting.
[04:20:00.794 --> 04:20:02.355]  They took over John McCain's office.
[04:20:02.456 --> 04:20:03.056]  Kind of interesting.
[04:20:03.076 --> 04:20:07.961]  So they were protesting Rex Tillerson's appointment as Secretary of State.
[04:20:07.981 --> 04:20:09.702]  Now that's the way that it's being reported in the news.
[04:20:09.803 --> 04:20:13.186]  Seven veterans arrested after taking over Senator John McCain's office.
[04:20:14.027 --> 04:20:19.352]  Except that if you look at the copy, these guys were part of a group called Iraq Veterans Against the War.
[04:20:19.392 --> 04:20:21.634]  Why didn't they protest Barack Obama?
[04:20:22.034 --> 04:20:22.274]  Why
[04:20:23.035 --> 04:20:29.136]  Didn't they protest John McCain when Obama was president and John McCain was pushing for broader wars?
[04:20:29.396 --> 04:20:30.036]  They didn't do that.
[04:20:30.557 --> 04:20:34.817]  But if you look closer, these guys are all members of Greenpeace.
[04:20:34.917 --> 04:20:41.339]  I would say that they are members of Greenpeace First and Veterans Against the War Second, if at all.
[04:20:41.359 --> 04:20:48.460]  One of the things that came out today was a story on Breitbart that I think really shows the character of Donald Trump.
[04:20:48.500 --> 04:20:51.461]  And we've heard a lot of stories about Donald Trump stopping
[04:20:52.543 --> 04:20:57.025]  Seeing somebody that needs some help and giving them a large check or whatever.
[04:20:57.065 --> 04:21:01.587]  This is a story about a guy who's a Federal Express courier, former security guard from Illinois.
[04:21:01.607 --> 04:21:05.209]  He had a piece done on him by the Washington Post.
[04:21:05.289 --> 04:21:06.349]  He's 23 years old.
[04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:08.210]  His name is Shane Bovet.
[04:21:08.951 --> 04:21:09.971]  He is a single dad.
[04:21:10.852 --> 04:21:15.754]  And they talked to him and he said, well, I came to Washington in a borrowed suit.
[04:21:16.653 --> 04:21:20.497]  And in donated shoes because I wanted to celebrate Donald Trump's oath of office.
[04:21:21.038 --> 04:21:23.200]  He said, this is pretty much the biggest thing I've done in my life.
[04:21:23.301 --> 04:21:24.061]  I don't get out much.
[04:21:24.101 --> 04:21:26.284]  I'm a small-town blue-collar guy.
[04:21:26.364 --> 04:21:28.767]  And Donald Trump read that account in the Washington Post.
[04:21:29.508 --> 04:21:37.515]  And he was moved to invite him to the, not only to the inauguration, but he went to an event, but he also met him.
[04:21:38.136 --> 04:21:51.287]  And as he was speaking to him, this gentleman called his father, had him talk to President Trump on the phone, and they laughed about the fact that his dad's also named Don, and so Donald Trump said, hey, that's a great name.
[04:21:51.607 --> 04:21:55.631]  But after the phone call, Donald Trump handed the man a $10,000 check.
[04:21:58.200 --> 04:21:59.341]  And the guy walked out.
[04:22:01.142 --> 04:22:04.404]  And as he walked out, the guy said, did that just happen?
[04:22:05.464 --> 04:22:06.565]  He was stunned, he was crying.
[04:22:06.605 --> 04:22:20.653]  And you know, if Trump does what he said he was going to do, these issues that he's laid out, I think that is going to be the bigger gift to all of us than a $10,000 check personally.
[04:22:20.693 --> 04:22:21.474]  I mean, just look at what
[04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:29.934]  What Barack Obama did, he handed us each a $75,000 debt for his eight years.
[04:22:31.034 --> 04:22:41.741]  Donald Trump could easily undo that and leave us all with a $10,000 surplus and we could all be looking at this in retrospect and saying, did that really happen?
[04:22:42.141 --> 04:22:43.882]  I hope that is our attitude.
[04:22:43.902 --> 04:22:45.523]  We're confident that that will be the case.
[04:22:45.623 --> 04:22:46.884]  We're confident that it's going to be
[04:22:48.382 --> 04:22:49.523]  A big C change.
[04:22:49.583 --> 04:23:02.190]  Now, kind of on the funny side here, we've got the BBC, and I guess as I look at these two stories from the Daily Mail, I'm kind of wondering if BBC is the call letters or the grades of this network.
[04:23:02.690 --> 04:23:04.952]  Are they going to get a B for this, and a C over there?
[04:23:05.212 --> 04:23:06.292]  Maybe even lower.
[04:23:06.312 --> 04:23:07.733]  That might be a little bit high for this.
[04:23:08.093 --> 04:23:12.356]  They've got one moment, and of course this is something that they're joking about on Twitter.
[04:23:12.596 --> 04:23:17.499]  I wonder if this is something that they would be laughing about if it had been done by a Donald Trump supporter.
[04:23:18.214 --> 04:23:20.115]  This is somebody who is a commentator.
[04:23:20.135 --> 04:23:21.877]  Her name is Katty Kay.
[04:23:22.317 --> 04:23:22.877]  Katty Kay.
[04:23:23.698 --> 04:23:35.647]  And as a black woman was emerging from the White House, this BBC reporter, Katty Kay, said, uh, this is not Michelle Obama, just somebody coming out and checking.
[04:23:37.018 --> 04:23:38.219]  Everything is ready, I imagine.
[04:23:38.619 --> 04:23:45.484]  So, they all started laughing about her because the first black woman she saw, she identified as Michelle Obama.
[04:23:46.045 --> 04:23:47.246]  And then, of course, they did this.
[04:23:47.426 --> 04:23:54.911]  The BBC, as they were broadcasting the inauguration, put out subtitles that had been taken from a children's show underneath it.
[04:23:55.231 --> 04:23:57.253]  And some people took some screenshots of it.
[04:23:58.153 --> 04:24:06.357]  So as they're doing this, and you see pictures of Donald Trump on the screen, they're saying underneath them, Mom will get into trouble.
[04:24:06.377 --> 04:24:10.178]  I should see some of these others with Barack Obama.
[04:24:10.238 --> 04:24:13.020]  It's like, you're only in a mood because Mo's gone.
[04:24:13.760 --> 04:24:14.600]  Just shut it, yeah?
[04:24:14.961 --> 04:24:15.821]  Oy, leave him alone.
[04:24:15.881 --> 04:24:17.822]  Just tell him to get out of my face.
[04:24:17.942 --> 04:24:25.586]  And they said as Trump was being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the BBC's subtitles reportedly read, no one wants you here.
[04:24:25.986 --> 04:24:34.391]  So, I guess that's the grade that the BBC gets is maybe, that's a little bit too high to give them two B's and a C. I think they get a failing grade on that.
[04:24:35.611 --> 04:24:38.653]  Donald Trump, of course, signed a large stack of papers.
[04:24:38.693 --> 04:24:42.034]  We saw him doing that after the inauguration.
[04:24:42.674 --> 04:24:52.139]  However, as we've tried to find out what these are for, of course, one of them, we knew right away, was waiving the requirement that a nominee have to be a civilian for the last seven years.
[04:24:52.959 --> 04:24:57.883]  And that would allow Mattis to take over as Secretary of Defense.
[04:24:58.203 --> 04:24:59.985]  So that was one of the documents that he signed.
[04:25:00.325 --> 04:25:03.908]  The rest of those were formal nominations for his cabinet picks.
[04:25:04.068 --> 04:25:06.410]  So that was a large stack of papers we saw him doing there.
[04:25:07.051 --> 04:25:10.613]  And we've heard from his press secretary, Sean Spicer.
[04:25:11.314 --> 04:25:11.394]  The
[04:25:31.625 --> 04:25:31.886]  Thank you.
[04:25:50.718 --> 04:25:56.379]  And as Trump Spicer said, he's committed not just to day one, but to day two, day three of enacting an agenda of real change.
[04:25:56.919 --> 04:26:00.180]  And I think you're going to see that in the days and the weeks to come.
[04:26:00.280 --> 04:26:02.500]  So we fully expect that that's going to happen.
[04:26:03.180 --> 04:26:05.701]  And we're waiting to see what's going to happen with that.
[04:26:05.741 --> 04:26:09.581]  And do we have Rob Dew and our reporters online?
[04:26:10.341 --> 04:26:11.642]  Okay, they're not with us just yet.
[04:26:12.242 --> 04:26:13.662]  Okay, we do have some reports.
[04:26:13.722 --> 04:26:19.603]  One of the things that we have, pull up the report that we've got, I think it's labeled as FDR.
[04:26:20.700 --> 04:26:25.204]  I wanted to talk about the infrastructure bills that Donald Trump is doing.
[04:26:26.025 --> 04:26:32.510]  Because as much as we are hopeful with this, I think that Donald Trump means well.
[04:26:32.530 --> 04:26:34.952]  We have to be very careful that we don't
[04:26:36.113 --> 04:26:44.116]  Get the kind of globalism and crony capitalism in the back door through some kind of a infrastructure bill that we are fighting at the border.
[04:26:44.816 --> 04:26:53.719]  So we've got actually, I just saw a note here, we're going to have Ashley and John Bowne are on the scene of some Austin protests.
[04:26:53.819 --> 04:26:59.080]  So we have some snowflakes that are protesting here down at the University of Texas.
[04:26:59.901 --> 04:27:01.661]  That's the sort of thing that we get here.
[04:27:01.701 --> 04:27:03.522]  You know, I think probably
[04:27:04.602 --> 04:27:09.684]  Outside of California, you're not going to find any place closer to California than Austin, Texas.
[04:27:10.424 --> 04:27:15.407]  I think we're going to be one of the first cities that's going to ban cars inside the city limits.
[04:27:15.427 --> 04:27:16.387]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[04:27:16.427 --> 04:27:23.690]  We already have a zero death organization here that is dedicated to eradicating cars from the streets of Austin.
[04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:24.830]  They're doing a pretty good job.
[04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:26.031]  They're not adding any more
[04:27:26.471 --> 04:27:26.872]  We're good to go.
[04:27:36.132 --> 04:27:45.694]  Are part of this agenda 21 and they truly do want to strangle the automobile out of existence and force everybody to live in what they consider to be utopia.
[04:27:45.734 --> 04:27:48.454]  That is their urban planned cities.
[04:27:48.554 --> 04:27:52.175]  But I want to play this clip about infrastructure as we talk about this.
[04:27:52.215 --> 04:27:53.355]  I think it's a very important thing.
[04:27:54.015 --> 04:27:54.275]  OK.
[04:27:54.295 --> 04:27:55.236]  You don't have that clip.
[04:27:55.316 --> 04:27:55.596]  All right.
[04:27:56.896 --> 04:27:57.316]  It's in.
[04:27:57.856 --> 04:27:58.276]  That's all right.
[04:27:58.456 --> 04:27:59.216]  We had that.
[04:27:59.736 --> 04:28:00.637]  We had that clip earlier.
[04:28:01.197 --> 04:28:01.837]  I'll just tell you.
[04:28:03.120 --> 04:28:12.909]  That as Donald Trump was talking about what he's going to do with infrastructure, and we've mentioned this before, we need radical changes in our infrastructure.
[04:28:12.949 --> 04:28:14.471]  Yes, we've got bridges that are falling down.
[04:28:14.911 --> 04:28:21.137]  Is it the thing, is it the job of the federal government to rebuild this, or is that something that should be done at the state and local level?
[04:28:22.503 --> 04:28:28.746]  Should we have government subsidize what we do, or should government get out of the way and cut our taxes and allow us to do that in our life?
[04:28:28.826 --> 04:28:31.708]  I hope that is the approach that Donald Trump takes.
[04:28:31.768 --> 04:28:41.893]  I hope he doesn't follow down the same road that Barack Obama did when he told us that we're going to have shovel-ready projects, and basically we know what he was shoveling at the time.
[04:28:41.953 --> 04:28:45.194]  It wasn't any projects with that.
[04:28:45.234 --> 04:28:51.778]  It was simply just shoveling us the same old socialist ideology that the government has to do everything.
[04:28:52.338 --> 04:28:52.678]  That's right.
[04:29:11.823 --> 04:29:19.365]  Corporate and foreign multinational corporations who are going to wind up owning our infrastructure, owning our roads, owning our bridges.
[04:29:19.965 --> 04:29:22.386]  Remember back to what Thomas Jefferson warned about.
[04:29:22.806 --> 04:29:31.468]  He said if we have a central bank, we're all going to wind up being servants and paupers and slaves on the continent that our forefathers conquered.
[04:29:32.088 --> 04:29:42.719]  And of course, the reason that that happens is because the Federal Reserve can manipulate the stock market, they can manipulate everything else as we have seen, and they can make sure that we all become debtors to them.
[04:29:43.881 --> 04:29:46.403]  But if we take this out, okay, you do have that clip.
[04:29:46.583 --> 04:29:49.406]  All right, let's play the clip that he had about infrastructure.
[04:29:49.427 --> 04:29:50.668]  Let's play that short clip then.
[04:29:51.906 --> 04:30:02.174]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[04:30:03.855 --> 04:30:13.482]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[04:30:20.976 --> 04:30:25.380]  And he's talking about infrastructure, and again, we do need to rebuild our infrastructure.
[04:30:25.400 --> 04:30:31.424]  We need to rebuild it with resources that are not removed from us and handed back to us like children on allowance from the federal government.
[04:30:31.485 --> 04:30:36.749]  We don't want to see American corporations or foreign corporations owning our infrastructure.
[04:30:36.929 --> 04:30:42.754]  You understand, most of our toll roads are owned by foreign companies out of Spain, out of Australia, elsewhere.
[04:30:43.354 --> 04:30:45.034]  I don't want to see that kind of pattern happen.
[04:30:45.175 --> 04:30:50.556]  I don't want to see globalism come in through the back door in the name of building our infrastructure.
[04:30:50.576 --> 04:30:56.938]  That's something we need to be very concerned about, and I hope that Donald Trump considers that and doesn't do that.
[04:30:56.998 --> 04:30:59.338]  I have great expectations for what Trump is going to do.
[04:30:59.378 --> 04:31:01.239]  That's one of my fears, though, that we're going to see there.
[04:31:01.479 --> 04:31:03.779]  Now we're going to go to break here, and we're going to come back in just a moment.
[04:31:04.400 --> 04:31:17.983]  Before we do, I want to remind you that we have, as we're going to go to our crew in Washington, D.C., one of the ways that you can support us to help us to do this is with the products that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:31:18.583 --> 04:31:21.703]  And we have put in some specials in honor of the inauguration.
[04:31:21.723 --> 04:31:25.204]  We put in the 30 to 40% off InfoWars select storable food.
[04:31:25.704 --> 04:31:27.225]  That is our inauguration special.
[04:31:27.665 --> 04:31:28.585]  And of course, that is our
[04:31:29.895 --> 04:31:33.956]  Food that has been packaged for preservation up to 25 years.
[04:31:34.056 --> 04:31:35.196]  No preservatives in that.
[04:31:35.256 --> 04:31:36.177]  No GMO.
[04:31:36.697 --> 04:31:38.737]  It is sealed in those containers.
[04:31:39.297 --> 04:31:40.458]  Very heavy duty containers.
[04:31:40.678 --> 04:31:43.078]  And once you open them, you can reseal them.
[04:31:43.598 --> 04:31:44.258]  Made in America.
[04:31:44.338 --> 04:31:45.259]  High quality food.
[04:31:45.699 --> 04:31:50.960]  And now you can stock up on that at 30 to 40% off as part of our Inauguration Special.
[04:31:51.620 --> 04:31:54.621]  Also, we have the InfoWars Live Specials.
[04:31:54.961 --> 04:31:55.681]  We're good to go.
[04:31:55.701 --> 04:31:56.661]  We're good to go.
[04:31:56.681 --> 04:31:57.242]  We're good to go.
[04:31:57.322 --> 04:31:58.082]  We're good to go.
[04:31:58.122 --> 04:31:58.582]  We're good to go.
[04:31:58.602 --> 04:31:59.002]  We're good to go.
[04:31:59.022 --> 04:31:59.462]  We're good to go.
[04:31:59.482 --> 04:32:00.002]  We're good to go.
[04:32:00.262 --> 04:32:00.922]  We're good to go.
[04:32:00.942 --> 04:32:02.103]  We're good to go.
[04:32:02.123 --> 04:32:02.583]  We're good to go.
[04:32:02.603 --> 04:32:03.063]  We're good to go.
[04:32:03.083 --> 04:32:03.623]  We're good to go.
[04:32:03.643 --> 04:32:04.863]  We're good to go.
[04:32:04.923 --> 04:32:05.784]  We're good to go.
[04:32:05.804 --> 04:32:06.384]  We're good to go.
[04:32:06.404 --> 04:32:06.804]  We're good to go.
[04:32:06.824 --> 04:32:07.224]  We're good to go.
[04:32:07.244 --> 04:32:07.704]  We're good to go.
[04:32:07.744 --> 04:32:08.724]  We're good to go.
[04:32:08.764 --> 04:32:09.164]  We're good to go.
[04:32:09.184 --> 04:32:09.805]  We're good to go.
[04:32:09.825 --> 04:32:10.565]  We're good to go.
[04:32:10.605 --> 04:32:11.005]  We're good to go.
[04:32:11.025 --> 04:32:12.325]  We're good to go.
[04:32:12.465 --> 04:32:12.865]  We're good to go.
[04:32:12.945 --> 04:32:13.265]  We're good to go.
[04:32:13.285 --> 04:32:13.626]  We're good to go.
[04:32:13.646 --> 04:32:14.086]  We're good to go.
[04:32:14.206 --> 04:32:15.106]  We're good to go.
[04:32:15.126 --> 04:32:15.446]  We're good to go.
[04:32:15.466 --> 04:32:15.826]  We're good to go.
[04:32:15.846 --> 04:32:16.826]  We're good to go.
[04:32:16.846 --> 04:32:17.366]  We're good to go.
[04:32:17.386 --> 04:32:18.127]  We're good to go.
[04:32:18.367 --> 04:32:19.047]  We're good to go.
[04:32:19.207 --> 04:32:19.587]  We're good to go.
[04:32:19.607 --> 04:32:19.707]  We're
[04:32:22.000 --> 04:32:31.548]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[04:32:32.569 --> 04:32:40.855]  And so I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[04:32:41.616 --> 04:32:42.257]  And it's simple.
[04:32:42.857 --> 04:32:47.961]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[04:32:48.421 --> 04:32:49.442]  And there's a nexus point.
[04:32:49.482 --> 04:32:52.284]  There's quality versus price.
[04:32:52.325 --> 04:32:54.226]  And those two points have to come together.
[04:32:54.826 --> 04:33:07.797]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[04:33:09.181 --> 04:33:11.243]  The true next generation in body armor.
[04:33:12.144 --> 04:33:19.111]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[04:33:19.932 --> 04:33:22.715]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[04:33:22.735 --> 04:33:25.157]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[04:33:25.197 --> 04:33:29.181]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[04:33:29.621 --> 04:33:30.422]  Well, believe me.
[04:33:31.522 --> 04:33:34.184]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[04:33:34.785 --> 04:33:45.254]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[04:33:45.854 --> 04:33:47.475]  It's nanotube technology.
[04:33:48.056 --> 04:33:49.597]  It's created here in Texas.
[04:33:50.238 --> 04:33:57.284]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[04:33:58.024 --> 04:34:00.386]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[04:34:00.826 --> 04:34:03.168]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[04:34:03.188 --> 04:34:09.652]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[04:34:09.892 --> 04:34:23.162]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[04:34:23.542 --> 04:34:24.383]  Born in Texas.
[04:34:24.723 --> 04:34:25.624]  Made in America.
[04:34:25.865 --> 04:34:28.508]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[04:34:28.588 --> 04:34:29.368]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:30.370]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[04:34:30.730 --> 04:34:32.051]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[04:34:32.111 --> 04:34:32.752]  It's waterproof.
[04:34:32.772 --> 04:34:33.213]  You can wear it.
[04:34:33.253 --> 04:34:33.833]  It's comfortable.
[04:34:33.893 --> 04:34:34.674]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[04:34:34.734 --> 04:34:37.037]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[04:34:37.517 --> 04:34:45.126]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[04:34:45.806 --> 04:34:49.451]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[04:34:49.491 --> 04:34:56.320]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently test it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[04:34:56.340 --> 04:34:57.702]  What did they really say about this?
[04:34:57.722 --> 04:34:58.704]  No, this is through the roof.
[04:34:58.864 --> 04:35:01.607]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[04:35:02.308 --> 04:35:10.430]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[04:35:10.931 --> 04:35:15.912]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[04:35:16.032 --> 04:35:19.693]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities
[04:35:19.813 --> 04:35:21.455]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[04:35:40.857 --> 04:35:44.199]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[04:35:44.219 --> 04:35:44.960]  People didn't believe it.
[04:35:45.300 --> 04:35:46.301]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[04:35:46.361 --> 04:35:48.102]  I feed my horse hay.
[04:35:49.423 --> 04:35:51.524]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[04:35:52.005 --> 04:35:56.548]  And we shot everything you can imagine at it.
[04:35:57.893 --> 04:35:59.835]  Again, fund the InfoWars.
[04:35:59.915 --> 04:36:03.838]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[04:36:04.338 --> 04:36:06.360]  It's a win-win.
[04:36:06.680 --> 04:36:06.360]  $200.
[04:36:06.940 --> 04:36:09.902]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[04:36:09.963 --> 04:36:10.723]  It's amazing.
[04:36:16.768 --> 04:36:18.329]  Owen Troyer here for InfoWars.com.
[04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:20.591]  You guys are out here, I guess, protesting Donald Trump?
[04:36:21.152 --> 04:36:23.835]  We're here to support democracy and freedom of speech.
[04:36:24.056 --> 04:36:25.978]  I'm first generation American.
[04:36:26.018 --> 04:36:34.408]  I'm Slovak and I'm here to represent my Slovak people and say that we want to stand tall just like Ronald Reagan did against the Russians.
[04:36:35.049 --> 04:36:40.596]  So I guess your sign is indicating here that you think Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have a too cozy relationship for your comfort.
[04:36:41.078 --> 04:36:46.967]  I think that President Trump is giving away our capital.
[04:36:47.087 --> 04:36:52.015]  He is negotiating from a point of weakness and as Americans we need to go forward with strength.
[04:36:52.756 --> 04:36:55.239]  Are you afraid of Vladimir Putin's influence?
[04:36:56.061 --> 04:37:04.625]  I think Vladimir Putin is a very ambitious and a very clever man, and I think that we need to put our best and our brightest to match Putin.
[04:37:04.685 --> 04:37:10.608]  I think he's a good representative of the Russian people, but I think we need an equally good representative of the American people.
[04:37:11.068 --> 04:37:12.789]  So, you have that hat on.
[04:37:12.849 --> 04:37:14.709]  Is that the Pussies Against Trump hat?
[04:37:15.570 --> 04:37:18.131]  No, this is the Women's Movement.
[04:37:18.511 --> 04:37:21.032]  Oh, I thought it was something else.
[04:37:21.192 --> 04:37:24.114]  So, I heard that they were hand-making them at home and mailing them out.
[04:37:24.154 --> 04:37:24.714]  Did you get that?
[04:37:25.219 --> 04:37:28.000]  Yeah, so this was given to me by a woman on the plane.
[04:37:28.280 --> 04:37:34.541]  I'm a Californian, and we are a strong supporter of President Obama, and we did not vote for Donald Trump.
[04:37:34.882 --> 04:37:37.042]  What scares you the most about a Donald Trump presidency?
[04:37:37.922 --> 04:37:47.385]  Loss of freedom of speech, loss of representation for our country, corruption, and influence from Russia and poor negotiation and chaos.
[04:37:47.645 --> 04:37:48.525]  Did you vote for Hillary?
[04:37:49.105 --> 04:37:49.865]  Yes, I did, sir.
[04:37:50.386 --> 04:37:50.826]  Alright, ma'am.
[04:37:50.866 --> 04:37:51.586]  Thank you for your time.
[04:37:53.439 --> 04:37:57.303]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[04:37:57.603 --> 04:38:04.890]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:16.101]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[04:38:16.521 --> 04:38:24.069]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[04:38:24.309 --> 04:38:33.679]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[04:38:33.979 --> 04:38:38.184]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[04:38:38.424 --> 04:38:45.172]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[04:38:45.512 --> 04:38:46.814]  That means it's clean.
[04:38:46.974 --> 04:38:48.035]  That means it's pure.
[04:38:48.135 --> 04:38:50.899]  That's infowarswife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[04:38:50.919 --> 04:38:52.721]  Take action now before we sell out.
[04:38:54.667 --> 04:38:58.308]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[04:38:58.648 --> 04:39:01.009]  I'm here in the middle of Austin, Texas.
[04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:09.492]  I'm here by the Congress Avenue Bridge, and we have just a huge group of different protesters that have actually gathered here.
[04:39:09.572 --> 04:39:11.293]  They're calling it One Resistance.
[04:39:11.813 --> 04:39:13.714]  Resistance against Donald Trump.
[04:39:13.894 --> 04:39:16.555]  Resistance against making America great again.
[04:39:16.935 --> 04:39:28.199]  And we've already had a lot of people come out here and start attacking us and tell me I'm wearing the wrong hat and, you know, just really getting into it, really just, you know, being mouthy and confrontational.
[04:39:28.699 --> 04:39:29.899]  David, are you there in the studio?
[04:39:29.939 --> 04:39:31.540]  You got any tips?
[04:39:32.640 --> 04:39:33.741]  Oh, he's not in the studio.
[04:39:33.781 --> 04:39:35.541]  Okay, David's not in the studio right now.
[04:39:35.581 --> 04:39:36.761]  We're waiting for him to come back.
[04:39:37.282 --> 04:39:42.983]  Right now, I'm going to go ahead and show you a shot of the crowd so you can get an idea of how many people are actually here.
[04:39:43.003 --> 04:39:49.185]  Okay, let's go ahead and show that.
[04:39:51.139 --> 04:39:59.564]  And basically you have at least several hundred people that have gathered here and people have been marching since about 5.30.
[04:40:00.464 --> 04:40:02.165]  They've been down here.
[04:40:02.765 --> 04:40:07.208]  They went from auditorium shores here in Austin, Texas and they've come
[04:40:08.248 --> 04:40:23.712]  All the way to the Capitol and they went all the way back so now it looks like they're gonna have a rally that's beginning here in just a few minutes so we're basically gonna just go ahead and see if we can talk to anyone and see you know what their thoughts are.
[04:40:24.152 --> 04:40:25.853]  I guess we'll start out
[04:40:26.733 --> 04:40:28.975]  With John Bowne, would you like to say something?
[04:40:29.255 --> 04:40:34.560]  Well, this guy right here just told me that his dad is a big fan of Alex Jones.
[04:40:34.880 --> 04:40:35.281]  Oh, really?
[04:40:35.321 --> 04:40:36.882]  Your dad's a big fan of Alex Jones?
[04:40:36.902 --> 04:40:38.944]  Yeah, my dad is a big fan of Alex Jones.
[04:40:43.052 --> 04:40:53.858]  I kind of like this for the horses because it's like, more conspicuous.
[04:40:53.918 --> 04:40:54.339]  Okay.
[04:40:54.859 --> 04:40:56.160]  Alright, one moment.
[04:40:56.180 --> 04:40:58.461]  We're actually having some technical difficulties.
[04:40:58.501 --> 04:41:00.842]  Let me see if I can make sure this microphone is working.
[04:41:00.862 --> 04:41:01.363]  Yeah, let's see.
[04:41:01.423 --> 04:41:01.683]  Okay, no.
[04:41:01.723 --> 04:41:01.883]  Hmm.
[04:41:10.739 --> 04:41:11.462]  Is it working now?
[04:41:13.369 --> 04:41:14.754]  Is the microphone working?
[04:41:14.915 --> 04:41:16.139]  Are you getting a connection from me?
[04:41:22.389 --> 04:41:23.730]  Uh, yeah.
[04:41:23.770 --> 04:41:24.150]  You are.
[04:41:24.511 --> 04:41:25.651]  You're getting audio now.
[04:41:25.792 --> 04:41:26.072]  Okay.
[04:41:26.792 --> 04:41:28.754]  Well, sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:41:28.794 --> 04:41:30.935]  We're here at- That was the Phantom Power Switch.
[04:41:31.396 --> 04:41:32.196]  You gotta have that on.
[04:41:32.416 --> 04:41:32.757]  Okay.
[04:41:33.097 --> 04:41:36.259]  According to John Bowne, that was the Phantom Power Switch.
[04:41:36.379 --> 04:41:36.840]  Okay, great.
[04:41:36.940 --> 04:41:39.742]  It looks like the rally is actually starting now.
[04:41:40.342 --> 04:41:42.744]  So, let's go ahead and tune in.
[04:41:50.309 --> 04:41:53.595]  We're not going to have an intrepid prayer by Baron Sorolla.
[04:42:02.654 --> 04:42:03.495]  Turn it off.
[04:42:03.515 --> 04:42:04.235]  Turn it back on.
[04:42:04.255 --> 04:42:05.956]  The trip's plugged in.
[04:42:06.256 --> 04:42:06.716]  Plugged in.
[04:42:24.626 --> 04:42:35.975]  In this moment, amidst the fullness of your human family, and in the face of the ascension of power and freedom, if ever we have felt your presence among us, let it be now.
[04:42:36.636 --> 04:42:41.520]  The path before us is difficult, and we'll try our faith in goodness.
[04:42:41.660 --> 04:42:47.084]  But, bringer of unity, we ask that when those days come, you bring our hearts
[04:42:47.464 --> 04:42:50.525]  Back to this moment and renew our strength.
[04:42:51.125 --> 04:42:58.607]  Our ancestors have risen up, paving the way for us today, hoping that their struggles would not be ours.
[04:42:58.687 --> 04:43:06.409]  In our continued struggle, we acknowledge that we may be paving a similar path for our children and their children.
[04:43:06.949 --> 04:43:17.037]  We ask for fortitude and perseverance and joy and laughter and dancing even through the exhaustion and anger and tears of this fight.
[04:43:17.677 --> 04:43:27.425]  And we pray to notice each glimpse of love within our daily lives as we bravely roll up our sleeves and join hands to do your work.
[04:43:28.005 --> 04:43:29.466]  Amen and may it be so.
[04:43:33.210 --> 04:43:47.484]  In the spirit of life and love, God has many names in each language, in this moment, in the midst of the absence of his human family, and before the ascension of power and the advent of the day.
[04:43:49.225 --> 04:43:51.206]  Okay, it was just working now.
[04:44:16.116 --> 04:44:19.217]  I don't understand why it would be much worse than that.
[04:44:19.237 --> 04:44:20.157]  How would you?
[04:44:20.177 --> 04:44:21.417]  Again, what are they doing there?
[04:44:21.457 --> 04:44:21.657]  Where?
[04:44:36.221 --> 04:44:38.722]  Okay, we're just going to say D.C.
[04:44:39.022 --> 04:44:40.462]  headquarters.
[04:44:40.642 --> 04:44:43.303]  All right, great.
[04:44:43.323 --> 04:44:53.465]  So I can go ahead and introduce them now.
[04:44:54.165 --> 04:44:57.946]  We're going to go ahead and go to Rob Duhl, who's at our D.C.
[04:44:58.006 --> 04:45:03.407]  headquarters, our news director, and see what's going on locally in D.C.
[04:45:03.527 --> 04:45:04.987]  at the inauguration headquarters.
[04:45:06.440 --> 04:45:07.641]  Hey everybody, this is Rob Dues.
[04:45:07.661 --> 04:45:12.864]  Sitting next to me is Millie Weaver, who I have barely seen in the last two days.
[04:45:13.725 --> 04:45:19.028]  This area in D.C., it's small, but it's large when you're walking around it.
[04:45:19.269 --> 04:45:20.650]  And you had some adventures today.
[04:45:20.670 --> 04:45:21.670]  I was getting texts from you.
[04:45:22.231 --> 04:45:26.393]  You were talking about disruptors during the inauguration and other things.
[04:45:26.433 --> 04:45:31.697]  So why don't you start off with this morning, how you got into the inauguration and then the disruption that went on.
[04:45:32.097 --> 04:45:32.517]  All right.
[04:45:32.597 --> 04:45:37.401]  So basically you do a ton of walking in Washington, D.C.
[04:45:37.421 --> 04:45:40.923]  So that's what I've been doing most of today and standing in lines.
[04:45:41.363 --> 04:45:47.787]  Now, the line just to get into the inauguration ceremony was massively long.
[04:45:48.268 --> 04:45:51.870]  It's stretched for at least over a mile, maybe even two miles.
[04:45:52.050 --> 04:45:55.752]  And it was thick and it veered off into different side streets.
[04:45:55.852 --> 04:45:56.913]  It was massive.
[04:45:57.273 --> 04:45:57.834]  So it is
[04:46:01.516 --> 04:46:01.836]  Yes.
[04:46:16.833 --> 04:46:27.724]  A rather large woman that was there, and she was holding a big, giant sign, and a lot of these people waited until like 5 or 4 in the morning just to get in.
[04:46:27.744 --> 04:46:39.915]  And she was kind of using her body weight to push people around, and she started pushing around this tinier woman, and you know, her husband was like, hey, stop pushing into my wife.
[04:46:42.057 --> 04:46:50.483]  And she just kept continuing on and then next thing you know there was a confrontation and a scuffle broke out in which this lady starts wailing on this guy.
[04:46:51.204 --> 04:46:53.005]  The police had to come in and break it up.
[04:46:53.085 --> 04:46:54.046]  It was pretty intense.
[04:46:54.126 --> 04:46:54.946]  They just moved her.
[04:46:54.986 --> 04:46:56.127]  They didn't even kick her out.
[04:46:56.147 --> 04:46:57.528]  It was probably too chaotic.
[04:46:57.968 --> 04:46:58.449]  The whole...
[04:46:59.009 --> 04:47:03.872]  The event, the ceremony was just covered with the National Guard and so many police.
[04:47:04.412 --> 04:47:06.193]  So it was very safe.
[04:47:06.513 --> 04:47:10.615]  I mean, I didn't really have much worries at all as far as safety.
[04:47:10.635 --> 04:47:22.060]  And the protesters, the main violent protesters, I don't really think they were trying to get in there because they wouldn't have been able to do what they did.
[04:47:22.401 --> 04:47:27.463]  But we did have a lot of instigators and people that just went there to try and disrupt or antagonize people.
[04:47:27.563 --> 04:47:36.331]  I think mainly the protesters were waiting right outside where people were trying to get into the gate, and as they were walking in they were like slapping them, hitting them, they were attacking women.
[04:47:36.351 --> 04:47:39.934]  It was pretty crazy.
[04:47:40.134 --> 04:47:49.603]  Alex Jones described what he saw as they were standing there by the gate waiting because Alex went into the inauguration, and they see a woman come by who's bleeding, and then another one, and then another one.
[04:47:49.623 --> 04:47:50.964]  They're like, what's wrong?
[04:47:51.004 --> 04:47:52.726]  They're like, we're being attacked over here.
[04:47:53.246 --> 04:48:12.401]  It was these coward black box activists, I don't know if they're black box or what, but they cover their faces in black, okay, because they're afraid to show their face, they're leftist ninjas, and they were attacking women who were trying to get in to the inauguration, which is very cowardly of these little punks.
[04:48:12.841 --> 04:48:17.925]  I confronted a few of them and asked them, oh, it looks like you didn't disrupt the inauguration.
[04:48:18.906 --> 04:48:23.468]  And they saw I was with InfoWars and proceeded to like try to intimidate me and I just stood my ground.
[04:48:23.488 --> 04:48:25.729]  It was just me and Josh and there was like eight of them.
[04:48:26.309 --> 04:48:28.110]  And of course they wouldn't, I was ready for them.
[04:48:28.430 --> 04:48:31.051]  I was ready, I was ready for them to attack.
[04:48:31.071 --> 04:48:32.752]  Of course they didn't.
[04:48:33.633 --> 04:48:35.954]  And probably because they're intimidated by the Warhammer.
[04:48:35.974 --> 04:48:36.554]  Wow.
[04:48:36.594 --> 04:48:39.075]  But it was quite a day today.
[04:48:39.455 --> 04:48:42.316]  And then afterwards, what did you guys do?
[04:48:44.207 --> 04:48:46.708]  After the inauguration.
[04:48:46.748 --> 04:48:52.730]  There were massive lines, so it took at least an hour or so even just to get through a checkpoint.
[04:48:52.770 --> 04:48:55.551]  There were checkpoints within checkpoints within checkpoints.
[04:48:55.951 --> 04:48:59.273]  So there's another checkpoint just to get to go see the parade.
[04:48:59.393 --> 04:49:02.674]  And when we finally got into the parade, there were a lot of people there.
[04:49:03.314 --> 04:49:13.901]  There were some reports I heard about the MSM trying to downplay the Trump support that was there and, you know, kind of up play the support of anti-Trump protesters.
[04:49:13.981 --> 04:49:17.543]  And what I can say is that it's absolutely fake news.
[04:49:18.044 --> 04:49:21.146]  There were so many Trump supporters there.
[04:49:21.166 --> 04:49:23.067]  I was just in shock.
[04:49:23.187 --> 04:49:27.310]  I mean, I knew Trump had a lot of support, but it was just a sea of red hats.
[04:49:27.450 --> 04:49:30.552]  I mean, it was pretty amazing to see some amazing people out there.
[04:49:30.612 --> 04:49:39.216]  And I believe Amy Schumer tweeted today that her friend, who's an extra, was being paid to be at the Trump.
[04:49:39.236 --> 04:49:40.737]  She goes, I heard this from a fact.
[04:49:40.797 --> 04:49:41.398]  And you know what?
[04:49:41.458 --> 04:49:47.521]  She's already been caught posting fake news, so I wouldn't put it past her just to have made up another story to try and
[04:49:48.221 --> 04:49:54.505]  And, you know, damn the name Donald Trump one more time because these people failed miserably.
[04:49:54.846 --> 04:49:55.666]  Hollywood failed.
[04:49:55.706 --> 04:49:56.967]  We're talking about Gerald Cilente.
[04:49:57.007 --> 04:49:57.808]  Hollywood failed.
[04:49:58.508 --> 04:49:59.729]  Silicon Valley failed.
[04:50:00.089 --> 04:50:01.210]  The big banks failed.
[04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:03.451]  Everybody failed in pushing Crooked Hillary.
[04:50:03.692 --> 04:50:05.353]  And now we were just at the CVS pharmacy.
[04:50:06.173 --> 04:50:08.375]  And a guy asked us, are we all here for the protest?
[04:50:08.435 --> 04:50:10.536]  I said, no, we're actually here celebrating.
[04:50:11.017 --> 04:50:13.619]  You know, I said, because there's no way.
[04:50:13.799 --> 04:50:16.401]  I wanted to see a child rape defender put in office.
[04:50:16.441 --> 04:50:17.161]  He's like, what do you mean?
[04:50:17.201 --> 04:50:25.948]  I started talking about Crooked Hillary and how she defended this child rapist who was the victim was Kathy Shelton, who we had on the show.
[04:50:26.588 --> 04:50:26.929]  Oh yeah.
[04:50:27.089 --> 04:50:29.813]  And I read one of Kathy's tweets and I started talking about this.
[04:50:30.454 --> 04:50:31.555]  He goes, you know why she didn't win?
[04:50:31.775 --> 04:50:33.438]  Because they forced her in there.
[04:50:33.838 --> 04:50:36.262]  They didn't let the natural process happen.
[04:50:36.302 --> 04:50:41.429]  They brought in, they could have put in Bernie Sanders, which was the obvious fan favorite.
[04:50:41.609 --> 04:50:41.809]  Yeah.
[04:50:43.659 --> 04:50:44.760]  I think so.
[04:51:01.036 --> 04:51:05.017]  If it would have been a lot closer, he would have had more support down the stretch.
[04:51:05.298 --> 04:51:12.440]  And I personally would have liked to see the Bernie-Trump debate because I think we need to have that socialism vs. communism debate.
[04:51:12.460 --> 04:51:15.861]  Do we want to run around looking for handouts from our government?
[04:51:16.141 --> 04:51:25.504]  Or do we want to just have more of our own money to do as we please instead of having to wait for the government to deem it necessary to give us money to go out and buy things?
[04:51:25.524 --> 04:51:27.405]  Because that's what they're looking at in Europe.
[04:51:27.785 --> 04:51:29.526]  They're talking about there's so many robots.
[04:51:30.086 --> 04:51:32.030]  We're going to have to just start giving people money.
[04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:37.641]  And that's coming up in a lot of these elections where they're just going to give people a monthly stipend.
[04:51:37.981 --> 04:51:46.025]  And that's the whole thing with the whole technocracy thing, where they're saying that machines and technology is going to replace the labor force.
[04:51:46.365 --> 04:51:51.747]  But I definitely do believe that Bernie Sanders would have given Trump a run for his money.
[04:51:51.767 --> 04:51:59.971]  I really do believe Trump would have won, but I do think that a race against Bernie Sanders would have been a lot closer than a race with Hillary Clinton.
[04:51:59.991 --> 04:52:03.113]  Because, I mean, even back in the DNC,
[04:52:04.113 --> 04:52:13.160]  When we went there in Philadelphia, that was pretty crazy because you had so many people out there protesting against Hillary.
[04:52:13.581 --> 04:52:16.884]  A lot of the left actually really did not want Hillary Clinton.
[04:52:17.184 --> 04:52:29.434]  And I think a good portion of them ended up getting behind Hillary because of the anti-Trump rhetoric and the anti-Trump brainwashing that the mainstream media was putting out.
[04:52:29.454 --> 04:52:32.817]  And they thought, well, I'm more anti-Trump than pro-Hillary.
[04:52:33.337 --> 04:52:34.977]  So that's what I think that was all about.
[04:52:34.997 --> 04:52:39.839]  It was definitely peer pressure to get people like, oh, you don't want Trump in the office, like, ugh.
[04:52:40.859 --> 04:52:52.182]  And it reminds me of this meme, maybe, I don't even know if I can dig it up and show it to people, it's somewhere on my Twitter, but it's an old-timey painting and it's this maid-type lady and she's eating a baby.
[04:52:52.202 --> 04:52:56.503]  And it says, so what if Democrats eat babies?
[04:52:56.523 --> 04:52:57.603]  Do you want Trump to win?
[04:52:58.503 --> 04:52:59.563]  Oh my gosh.
[04:52:59.723 --> 04:53:01.944]  I mean, they'll just let them get away with anything.
[04:53:02.004 --> 04:53:02.684]  It's so horrible.
[04:53:02.964 --> 04:53:04.725]  And they're such hypocrites.
[04:53:04.745 --> 04:53:10.066]  I mean, like how you were saying these guys were out there assaulting women, trying to go in and see the value.
[04:53:10.126 --> 04:53:11.027]  Oh, total cowards, ma'am.
[04:53:11.247 --> 04:53:14.388]  They don't want to let you believe that women support Trump.
[04:53:14.448 --> 04:53:19.009]  They don't want to let you believe that gays support Trump or that blacks support Trump.
[04:53:19.790 --> 04:53:21.752]  They want those to be their people.
[04:53:21.792 --> 04:53:27.100]  They want to try to claim them that, oh, those are ours, you know, they don't support Trump.
[04:53:27.180 --> 04:53:30.364]  It's just a bunch of white, redneck racists that support Trump.
[04:53:30.665 --> 04:53:35.411]  And if you want to bring race into the issue, most of the people that came up to Alex that were very vocal
[04:53:36.240 --> 04:53:38.162]  We're minorities in the United States.
[04:53:38.202 --> 04:53:39.823]  We had a guy from Taiwan.
[04:53:40.684 --> 04:53:42.165]  Several black guys came up.
[04:53:43.446 --> 04:53:46.048]  I think she was either Polish or Czech woman.
[04:53:46.869 --> 04:53:49.311]  A Cuban lady came up to me today.
[04:53:49.331 --> 04:53:50.272]  I interviewed her.
[04:53:51.333 --> 04:54:01.201]  It was probably 50-50 minorities and white people coming up, thanking Alex, wanting to get on, wanting to talk about it, wanting to talk about Trump, really excited about what we're going to have for these next four years.
[04:54:04.304 --> 04:54:15.630]  Exactly, and I just had a young African-American Trump supporter stop me on the street on the way over here, like, hey Millie, I love InfoWars, say hi to Alex for me, you know, and can I take a picture with you?
[04:54:15.730 --> 04:54:21.354]  So, I mean, there are tons, the variety of people out there supporting Trump today.
[04:54:21.374 --> 04:54:24.275]  It was every different type of person you can imagine.
[04:54:24.895 --> 04:54:27.177]  So, I mean, that's just what I saw.
[04:54:27.847 --> 04:54:47.630]  Yeah, and we're out here promoting the truth, boots on the ground, thanks to you out there supporting us, going to InfoWarsStore.com, getting the InfoWars Prime app, which is a subscription app which allows you some behind-the-scenes videos, all kinds of different things that we're offering, plus some amazing specials at the InfoWars Store that you're not going to get anywhere else.
[04:54:48.251 --> 04:54:55.395]  And it's your support that helps us take it to the next level and do things like this 14-hour broadcast that started at 8.
[04:54:55.995 --> 04:54:57.996]  Well, it was 9 this morning for us.
[04:54:58.056 --> 04:55:00.958]  It was 8 for the guys in Austin, Texas.
[04:55:01.598 --> 04:55:04.820]  And I was on at 9.30 this morning with Paul Watson.
[04:55:05.100 --> 04:55:12.842]  And here I am approaching 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock here, Eastern, and we've still got another hour to go.
[04:55:13.222 --> 04:55:28.465]  And I believe after we come back from break, we're going to try to go back to Ashley Beckford and John Bowne, who are at a, I guess, a Commie Love Fest protest outside or inside the city of Austin, because, you know, they're mad Trump got in and they want to just call him a fascist.
[04:55:28.625 --> 04:55:31.565]  And because they think he's a fascist, he is.
[04:55:31.866 --> 04:55:34.106]  And it's just these people are pathetic.
[04:55:34.346 --> 04:55:42.068]  It is very pathetic and it just is really frustrating because I do feel a lot of this is fueled by the fake news.
[04:55:42.208 --> 04:55:43.929]  It's fueled by the mainstream media.
[04:55:43.949 --> 04:55:46.669]  They're the ones putting this disinformation out there.
[04:55:46.729 --> 04:55:48.310]  I mean, they're somewhat responsible.
[04:55:48.410 --> 04:55:59.193]  I mean, they have a responsibility as a journalist to make sure you're reporting accurately and not just trying to put propaganda out there to get people to go out and protest and
[04:55:59.793 --> 04:56:00.113]  Yeah, we're good.
[04:56:21.255 --> 04:56:33.145]  We're going down the way, having to give coverage to Donald Trump, the next, you know, the President of the United States of America, who they fought against the entire time.
[04:56:33.685 --> 04:56:40.371]  So I'm sure they weren't happy about that, but nonetheless, the people in the crowd, in the bleachers, started booing them.
[04:56:40.731 --> 04:56:43.233]  Going, boo, mainstream media, boo!
[04:56:43.273 --> 04:56:44.234]  So they were getting booed.
[04:56:44.254 --> 04:56:44.694]  Your fake news!
[04:56:45.775 --> 04:56:51.977]  People were booing them and they looked so shameful and so embarrassed.
[04:56:52.157 --> 04:56:53.377]  I mean, that was pretty funny.
[04:56:53.437 --> 04:56:55.018]  No, I didn't watch the parade.
[04:56:55.078 --> 04:56:56.278]  We were outside.
[04:56:56.318 --> 04:56:58.259]  We were actually shooting Facebook mentions at the time.
[04:56:58.459 --> 04:57:01.140]  Did Trump actually get out and walk or did he ride in the car the whole time?
[04:57:01.499 --> 04:57:07.385]  He was in the car the whole time and there were police everywhere and it was actually a really nice parade.
[04:57:07.885 --> 04:57:17.555]  I got a little bit choked up for a minute there because there was a cool part where they had the military servicemen all marching ahead before Trump.
[04:57:18.215 --> 04:57:22.959]  And they were wearing different uniforms all throughout the history of our nation.
[04:57:22.979 --> 04:57:23.499]  Oh, wow.
[04:57:23.559 --> 04:57:28.123]  And so it really just got me choked up seeing the evolution of our nation's veterans.
[04:57:28.143 --> 04:57:34.047]  So the colonial uniforms were all going up through World War I, and the Doughboys, and then World War II with the Leathernecks.
[04:57:34.087 --> 04:57:35.288]  Yeah, definitely.
[04:57:35.348 --> 04:57:42.234]  It got me pretty choked up because it's like, wow, our nation has come a long way, and all these different men.
[04:57:42.294 --> 04:57:47.618]  I mean, each uniform represented many lives that were lost to protect our rights.
[04:57:48.254 --> 04:57:48.674]  That's true.
[04:57:48.754 --> 04:57:54.996]  And unfortunately, we have been a war-like nation since we've, you know, come into inception a little over 200 years ago.
[04:57:55.016 --> 04:57:57.536]  And I would like to see that change.
[04:57:57.556 --> 04:58:12.140]  I would like to see us go, you know, more into working with countries on developing space programs, on developing, you know, free energy type programs with other nations and not being stuck on, well, we have to go fight you and take your resources.
[04:58:13.740 --> 04:58:17.262]  Many more solutions other than going to war with people.
[04:58:17.322 --> 04:58:30.850]  And I think a Trump presidency is going to allow us to see those solutions and not worry so much about who we have to fight, who we have to demonize, create the new enemy, fund the new enemy so he can actually be an enemy worth fighting.
[04:58:31.370 --> 04:58:39.275]  Because most of these countries out there could not take on the United States of America, even though we're not as strong as we once were.
[04:58:40.441 --> 04:58:46.546]  But on the other hand, being strong also means having that patience and that resilience to just go, you know what?
[04:58:46.986 --> 04:58:47.707]  I'm going to be fine.
[04:58:47.747 --> 04:58:50.649]  But if you mess with me and you cross me, that's it.
[04:58:50.930 --> 04:58:52.991]  Yeah, I won't be afraid to fight back.
[04:58:53.051 --> 04:58:53.612]  Exactly.
[04:58:54.172 --> 04:58:59.076]  And you know, Donald Trump's biggest task that he has right now ahead of him is
[04:59:00.257 --> 04:59:20.451]  Making a nation that is so divided come together again And that's one of the things that will make America great again is when he can unite us again after all the divisive Propaganda that was put out by the mainstream media and this tactic to try and divide us when we're so much more alike than we really know So that's it.
[04:59:20.751 --> 04:59:21.432]  That's one thing.
[04:59:21.452 --> 04:59:26.455]  I do hope to see Trump do is kind of bring us together again and kind of
[04:59:27.856 --> 04:59:30.457]  You know, get rid of some of this division that we're seeing.
[04:59:30.818 --> 04:59:34.339]  Well, if you think about it, it's really easy to get along.
[04:59:35.180 --> 04:59:40.403]  It's a lot harder to try and fight with people all the time and debate people.
[04:59:40.423 --> 04:59:42.003]  I get so sick of debating these people.
[04:59:42.023 --> 04:59:47.286]  It's just like, look, like in the immortal words of Rodney King, can't we all just get along?
[04:59:47.726 --> 04:59:48.627]  It's easier to do.
[04:59:48.907 --> 04:59:52.369]  We get more accomplished and society progresses.
[04:59:52.729 --> 04:59:54.030]  You know, if you want progression,
[04:59:55.003 --> 04:59:56.004]  Work together with people.
[04:59:56.445 --> 05:00:01.030]  Don't try to find every little thing that's different about other people and say, oh, I'm not going to work with you.
[05:00:01.050 --> 05:00:01.851]  I'm not going to work with you.
[05:00:02.392 --> 05:00:08.199]  There's plenty of ways we can find common ground and get along and then work on those issues where we disagree at.
[05:00:08.559 --> 05:00:10.602]  And I think if we have an economy that's booming,
[05:00:10.962 --> 05:00:19.648]  We are definitely going to be in the area where we're going to be more prosperous and people aren't going to be worried about those little issues of little or no significance.
[05:00:19.708 --> 05:00:21.989]  So with that, we're going to go to break and then we're going to come back.
[05:00:22.009 --> 05:00:26.352]  We're going to check back in with Ashley Beckford and John Bowne on location in Austin.
[05:00:26.672 --> 05:00:28.714]  And we're also going to have a young man in here.
[05:00:28.794 --> 05:00:29.834]  Owen Shorter is going to sit back down.
[05:00:29.854 --> 05:00:31.956]  We're going to have a young man who was attacked last night.
[05:00:32.316 --> 05:00:34.397]  You've probably seen the pictures all over Twitter.
[05:00:34.797 --> 05:00:38.040]  He had a pretty bad laceration on the back of his skull, had to get some staples.
[05:00:38.780 --> 05:00:40.122]  And these are the tolerant liberals.
[05:00:40.142 --> 05:00:40.883]  Yeah, and you know what?
[05:00:40.923 --> 05:00:47.391]  Somebody from inside the door of Blorable actually told me they saw a guy who had paint on the back of his neck.
[05:00:47.551 --> 05:00:49.694]  Red paint that he had on his hand.
[05:00:49.754 --> 05:00:55.081]  So, I'm thinking the guy thought it was paint, but it was actually blood from what I've seen in these pictures today.
[05:00:55.521 --> 05:00:57.002]  Well, that could totally be.
[05:00:57.042 --> 05:01:07.729]  We're going to get the scoop coming up after this break as we enter the final homestretch of the 14 hours of the inauguration special of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States.
[05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:10.691]  You're watching it now on InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[05:01:11.512 --> 05:01:12.873]  Please spread that link.
[05:01:13.013 --> 05:01:17.176]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsShop.com.
[05:01:17.476 --> 05:01:20.318]  Check out the great products that we have, the nutraceuticals.
[05:01:20.338 --> 05:01:21.038]  We have about 20 now.
[05:01:23.208 --> 05:01:30.712]  I've been with Alex since 09, but just watching, going from X2 to all the products that we have now, it really is amazing.
[05:01:30.752 --> 05:01:32.093]  And these are really good products.
[05:01:32.693 --> 05:01:38.656]  Dr. Group and Anthony Gucciardi really take their time to work on these formulations, to work on the packaging.
[05:01:38.776 --> 05:01:45.159]  Even Dr. Jones, Alex's dad, is working on the toothpaste Super Blue, which I think is great.
[05:01:45.219 --> 05:01:47.240]  It's got silver in it.
[05:01:47.260 --> 05:01:49.422]  It's also has iodine in it.
[05:01:49.782 --> 05:01:52.223]  These are things you normally don't find in toothpaste.
[05:01:52.363 --> 05:01:55.705]  In fact, I challenge anybody to find another toothpaste with silver in it.
[05:01:56.186 --> 05:02:03.050]  And I used to, before, I would brush my teeth and then I would gargle with silver water because it's a natural antibiotic.
[05:02:05.902 --> 05:02:08.284]  So that's how I feel about it, and that's what I do.
[05:02:08.824 --> 05:02:11.126]  And so I encourage you to go check out some of our products.
[05:02:11.746 --> 05:02:17.430]  Get Super Blue, get X2, Brain Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[05:02:17.770 --> 05:02:20.252]  They're all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:02:20.632 --> 05:02:22.474]  Check them out for yourself, and we're going to go to break.
[05:02:22.494 --> 05:02:25.896]  Get some Super Female Vitality and some Super Male Vitality.
[05:02:25.916 --> 05:02:27.317]  So you take Super Female Vitality?
[05:02:27.657 --> 05:02:28.898]  It's amazing, you know?
[05:02:29.058 --> 05:02:32.519]  And I take the iodine, I take the probiotics.
[05:02:33.119 --> 05:02:34.240]  I mean, I take a good amount.
[05:02:34.260 --> 05:02:35.320]  The probiotics are amazing.
[05:02:35.340 --> 05:02:43.564]  The probiotics, seriously, it helps if you're forced to have to eat GMO foods or any of that crazy food when you're on the road.
[05:02:43.624 --> 05:02:44.985]  It kills your gut bacteria.
[05:02:45.065 --> 05:02:47.046]  Yeah, it kills your gut bacteria.
[05:02:47.166 --> 05:02:49.186]  It totally just helps you along.
[05:02:49.267 --> 05:02:51.487]  It's like a gift from heaven.
[05:02:51.507 --> 05:02:52.448]  I love that stuff.
[05:02:52.808 --> 05:02:53.368]  There you go.
[05:02:53.708 --> 05:02:55.109]  All right, we'll be right back after this break.
[05:02:55.149 --> 05:03:02.452]  You're watching the 14-hour inauguration special of Donald Trump, our now 45th President of the United States.
[05:03:02.892 --> 05:03:10.415]  Hopefully, we're going to have four great years and maybe eight great years and then, you know, become the country that we were meant to be.
[05:03:11.035 --> 05:03:13.336]  And I think all the signs are pointing in the right direction.
[05:03:13.576 --> 05:03:14.877]  And we'll be right back after this break.
[05:03:25.859 --> 05:03:30.261]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[05:03:30.342 --> 05:03:41.268]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:46.371]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[05:03:46.471 --> 05:03:48.993]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[05:03:49.053 --> 05:03:50.574]  It helps detoxify.
[05:03:50.774 --> 05:03:53.596]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[05:03:53.656 --> 05:03:58.399]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[05:03:58.419 --> 05:04:04.664]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[05:04:04.704 --> 05:04:09.987]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[05:04:11.728 --> 05:04:12.449]  This is so key.
[05:04:12.709 --> 05:04:15.030]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:17.011]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[05:04:17.031 --> 05:04:19.132]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[05:04:19.252 --> 05:04:22.654]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLives.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[05:04:22.674 --> 05:04:23.394]  Everyone, please stand.
[05:04:46.516 --> 05:04:49.579]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[05:04:49.599 --> 05:04:53.402]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[05:04:53.423 --> 05:04:57.246]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[05:04:57.626 --> 05:04:59.668]  That I will faithfully execute.
[05:05:00.309 --> 05:05:02.471]  That I will faithfully execute.
[05:05:02.731 --> 05:05:05.414]  The office of President of the United States.
[05:05:05.774 --> 05:05:08.735]  The office of President of the United States.
[05:05:09.135 --> 05:05:11.096]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[05:05:11.596 --> 05:05:13.777]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[05:05:14.157 --> 05:05:16.217]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[05:05:16.658 --> 05:05:18.458]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[05:05:18.738 --> 05:05:20.739]  The Constitution of the United States.
[05:05:20.859 --> 05:05:23.220]  The Constitution of the United States.
[05:05:23.360 --> 05:05:24.200]  So help me God.
[05:05:24.420 --> 05:05:25.280]  So help me God.
[05:05:25.801 --> 05:05:27.041]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[05:06:35.495 --> 05:06:45.841]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[05:07:12.014 --> 05:07:26.589]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[05:07:32.327 --> 05:07:46.019]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[05:07:48.161 --> 05:07:56.008]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[05:07:57.529 --> 05:07:59.130]  We will face challenges.
[05:07:59.750 --> 05:08:01.411]  We will confront hardships.
[05:08:02.032 --> 05:08:04.093]  But we will get the job done.
[05:08:05.514 --> 05:08:11.718]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[05:08:12.873 --> 05:08:23.618]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[05:08:24.279 --> 05:08:26.560]  They have been magnificent.
[05:08:26.880 --> 05:08:27.340]  Thank you.
[05:08:34.804 --> 05:08:36.305]  Today's ceremony, however,
[05:08:37.182 --> 05:08:39.123]  Has very special meaning.
[05:08:40.024 --> 05:08:46.167]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[05:08:46.827 --> 05:08:48.408]  Or from one party to another.
[05:08:49.089 --> 05:08:53.211]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[05:08:53.771 --> 05:08:56.873]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[05:09:05.709 --> 05:09:07.089]  And we are back live.
[05:09:07.129 --> 05:09:11.230]  Joining me now is Owen Troyer and our guest, James Alsip.
[05:09:11.250 --> 05:09:17.232]  We're going to talk a little bit about what he had to endure last night because of the tolerant left.
[05:09:17.772 --> 05:09:19.492]  They're so peaceful.
[05:09:19.873 --> 05:09:21.033]  They're so loving.
[05:09:21.053 --> 05:09:21.853]  We love you.
[05:09:21.873 --> 05:09:24.594]  When you go low, we go high.
[05:09:24.614 --> 05:09:25.294]  That's right.
[05:09:27.034 --> 05:09:29.535]  Or, when you go low, we hit you even harder.
[05:09:29.555 --> 05:09:33.036]  The real is, when we go low, we go really, really low.
[05:09:33.908 --> 05:09:44.111]  Yeah, these tolerant jackasses who are running around claiming Donald Trump is a fascist are really going to be in for a wake-up call I think in a couple years.
[05:09:44.951 --> 05:09:48.933]  And after they get, you know, I was arguing with one of these commies this morning.
[05:09:48.953 --> 05:09:53.914]  I said, what's going to happen when you get a really good job and you're making money and you're paying taxes?
[05:09:53.934 --> 05:09:56.335]  They're going to stop being a liberal is what's going to happen.
[05:09:56.715 --> 05:09:57.015]  Exactly.
[05:09:57.035 --> 05:09:59.796]  They're going to start going, damn, Trump, I want more of my money.
[05:09:59.816 --> 05:10:02.157]  I like winning.
[05:10:02.237 --> 05:10:03.957]  I've never experienced this winning before.
[05:10:03.977 --> 05:10:04.977]  This is kind of nice.
[05:10:05.217 --> 05:10:06.078]  It's going to be horrible.
[05:10:06.098 --> 05:10:08.278]  But last night, James here.
[05:10:08.658 --> 05:10:13.740]  James, why don't you tell everybody who's listening, and you have some props, some stuff that you're wearing.
[05:10:14.480 --> 05:10:16.141]  A whole theatrical performance today.
[05:10:16.322 --> 05:10:17.383]  We brought the evidence.
[05:10:17.763 --> 05:10:19.004]  So we were just outside.
[05:10:19.224 --> 05:10:21.807]  We just finished up wrapping an interview down in Alexandria.
[05:10:21.847 --> 05:10:22.727]  We took an Uber back up.
[05:10:22.988 --> 05:10:24.289]  And we knew the floorball was going on.
[05:10:24.329 --> 05:10:26.150]  We knew there was a large protest going to be staged there.
[05:10:26.551 --> 05:10:31.956]  So me and my friend and I, we went to the bar, kind of kiddie corner at the National Press Club.
[05:10:32.276 --> 05:10:33.697]  And we went in, got a few drinks.
[05:10:34.078 --> 05:10:35.299]  And then we decided, hey, you know what?
[05:10:35.479 --> 05:10:35.839]  We're here.
[05:10:36.259 --> 05:10:37.841]  We might as well just go check it out.
[05:10:37.961 --> 05:10:56.770]  And so I changed real quick in the bathroom, popped on my Trump shirt and my hat and we went out there and we were just out there talking to people and we were having a conversation with one guy who was talking about how it was like he was accusing Deplorable of being like a white nationalist conference and I was kind of explaining... You know there were black people there with black speakers.
[05:10:57.481 --> 05:10:58.121]  Right, you're right.
[05:10:58.181 --> 05:11:02.503]  And even though, like, all of the people there repeatedly denounce white nationalism, like, all the time.
[05:11:02.523 --> 05:11:04.144]  It became an issue, actually.
[05:11:04.324 --> 05:11:04.604]  It did.
[05:11:05.725 --> 05:11:20.411]  So, I was having that conversation, and then one of the tactics you see most of these, or a lot of these anti-fascists, and I say that, you know, very loosely and sarcastically, these anti-fascist protesters do, is they'll get up, and they're always wearing balaclavas, and they'll, like, start pushing on you.
[05:11:20.851 --> 05:11:22.051]  They just want to provoke a reaction.
[05:11:22.071 --> 05:11:23.072]  They'll push and push and push.
[05:11:23.092 --> 05:11:24.272]  Or they'll bump into you.
[05:11:24.432 --> 05:11:25.873]  We have you on tape getting bumped into.
[05:11:26.133 --> 05:11:26.833]  Oh, you're assaulting me!
[05:11:26.854 --> 05:11:27.594]  You're assaulting me!
[05:11:27.634 --> 05:11:30.876]  Because they're told to do that to you, and then you do that to them, and they freak out.
[05:11:31.036 --> 05:11:31.156]  Right.
[05:11:31.216 --> 05:11:32.376]  That's how they think to handle it.
[05:11:32.477 --> 05:11:32.717]  Right.
[05:11:32.737 --> 05:11:33.737]  But that's exactly what they do.
[05:11:34.237 --> 05:11:35.698]  Oh, yeah, I'm not touching you at all.
[05:11:36.259 --> 05:11:36.419]  Right.
[05:11:36.719 --> 05:11:37.139]  Oh, yeah.
[05:11:37.199 --> 05:11:37.559]  Right.
[05:11:37.779 --> 05:11:37.959]  Right.
[05:11:38.039 --> 05:11:41.101]  There's actually one time in Seattle where one of the guys had like a walking... a flagpole.
[05:11:41.301 --> 05:11:46.624]  Ironically, it was a flagpole that he had in his hand in Seattle, and he stuck it like in my camera lens, and he's like, I'm not touching you.
[05:11:46.644 --> 05:11:52.867]  Oh, they love to do the whole flagpole trick, or they'll like walk by you and then like pretend to turn and like knock you over the head with a flagpole.
[05:11:52.907 --> 05:11:53.568]  I've had that happen.
[05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.848]  Right.
[05:11:54.048 --> 05:11:58.791]  Well, and something like that happened, except not at all accidental, and not even like a pretense of being accidental.
[05:11:58.811 --> 05:11:59.692]  But that's later on.
[05:11:59.712 --> 05:12:03.954]  So I have this conversation with the guy, and one of the guys, and he was unmasked, you know, he wasn't hiding.
[05:12:04.114 --> 05:12:05.635]  He was actually, you know, pretty decent.
[05:12:05.655 --> 05:12:06.336]  We were having a debate.
[05:12:06.376 --> 05:12:08.657]  He was civil, for the most part.
[05:12:08.757 --> 05:12:12.860]  And then this guy comes up and he starts pushing with a flag, and he starts pushing the flag over onto me.
[05:12:13.440 --> 05:12:16.821]  And I turn around and I say, hey man, you better knock it off.
[05:12:16.841 --> 05:12:17.441]  Stop doing that.
[05:12:18.282 --> 05:12:23.563]  And then he stops for a second and then I turn back to have more of the conversation and then he does it again.
[05:12:24.563 --> 05:12:25.284]  But more.
[05:12:25.664 --> 05:12:26.804]  And he's on top of me.
[05:12:27.024 --> 05:12:27.924]  He's pushing into me now.
[05:12:28.365 --> 05:12:36.047]  And I look over and I say, hey man, I think what I meant to say at the time was if you keep doing this, I'm not going to just let it happen.
[05:12:39.448 --> 05:12:43.050]  What I said is I'm not going to follow the NAP, the Non-Aggression Principle.
[05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:47.512]  For some reason I was thinking of libertarian theory at the time and it just came out that way.
[05:12:47.532 --> 05:12:50.874]  So anyways, essentially what I'm saying is I'm going to defend myself.
[05:12:50.914 --> 05:12:52.455]  I'm not just going to let you push me around.
[05:12:52.995 --> 05:12:58.818]  And so then I turn back to finish having the conversation and the next thing I know, I feel my hat being taken.
[05:12:59.419 --> 05:13:07.263]  And what they do, and this is what they do whether they're attacking you or stealing from you or whatever they're doing, they're going to come up, do it, try to be quick and then get away.
[05:13:07.563 --> 05:13:07.983]  I don't know.
[05:13:08.003 --> 05:13:08.363]  I don't know.
[05:13:31.632 --> 05:13:32.413]  Totally unrelated.
[05:13:32.453 --> 05:13:33.874]  You know, another guy wearing a mask, of course.
[05:13:34.394 --> 05:13:35.975]  And he just comes in and straight sucker punches me.
[05:13:35.995 --> 05:13:37.276]  Because both my hands are occupied.
[05:13:37.536 --> 05:13:38.817]  I can't defend myself at that point.
[05:13:39.337 --> 05:13:40.618]  But he sucker punches me.
[05:13:40.638 --> 05:13:41.318]  And then...
[05:13:44.634 --> 05:13:50.698]  The fortunate thing is that what a lot of these Antifa people don't realize is that any one of their marches or rallies, like a quarter of the people there are cops.
[05:13:51.298 --> 05:13:52.499]  A quarter of the people there are plainclothes.
[05:13:52.959 --> 05:13:55.080]  And so suddenly three cops were right on them.
[05:13:55.541 --> 05:13:58.562]  And they stopped the guy who had my hat.
[05:13:58.622 --> 05:14:00.003]  I got the hat back.
[05:14:00.784 --> 05:14:01.924]  Show the battle scars here.
[05:14:01.984 --> 05:14:05.766]  Yeah, so this is not from this first attack, but as you can see there is...
[05:14:06.806 --> 05:14:09.627]  There is a little bit of colorization on the normally white hat.
[05:14:09.727 --> 05:14:11.948]  And this is now, this is now a piece of history here.
[05:14:12.088 --> 05:14:12.308]  Yeah.
[05:14:12.568 --> 05:14:14.809]  Might be in the Smithsonian one day, I don't know.
[05:14:15.290 --> 05:14:16.350]  With Trump in charge, you never know.
[05:14:16.650 --> 05:14:18.311]  Blood in the front, right there.
[05:14:18.891 --> 05:14:20.052]  So you got your shirt too?
[05:14:20.132 --> 05:14:20.852]  Yes, yes.
[05:14:20.872 --> 05:14:22.092]  So I didn't bleed from this one.
[05:14:22.132 --> 05:14:26.794]  So anyways, they tased the guy who punched me, because he then punched a cop.
[05:14:27.235 --> 05:14:28.195]  And so he got arrested.
[05:14:28.295 --> 05:14:32.697]  From what I heard from the police, he got arrested for second degree assault on me.
[05:14:33.557 --> 05:14:35.478]  And it's kind of faded there, but you can see it up in this region.
[05:14:35.558 --> 05:14:37.859]  Yeah, you can see the light, if you get the light on it.
[05:14:38.179 --> 05:14:39.359]  It's the light is so bright.
[05:14:39.399 --> 05:14:43.441]  We washed it, unfortunately, but it's still... You washed the blood.
[05:14:43.841 --> 05:14:46.262]  Then the whole collar there is... There you go, you can see it right there.
[05:14:46.622 --> 05:14:46.802]  Yeah.
[05:14:47.847 --> 05:14:48.648]  Yeah.
[05:14:48.988 --> 05:14:50.529]  So they arrest the guy and he gets taken off.
[05:14:50.549 --> 05:14:51.590]  So then the police take me inside.
[05:14:51.630 --> 05:14:52.631]  I go and I talk to him.
[05:14:53.212 --> 05:14:54.352]  I walk through Deplora Ball.
[05:14:54.393 --> 05:14:55.193]  I see Mike Cernovich.
[05:14:56.194 --> 05:15:03.900]  And then I come back outside and then I go back over across the street to the other side of the street where Deplora Ball is being held.
[05:15:03.920 --> 05:15:05.242]  There's a bar called Shelly's over there.
[05:15:05.622 --> 05:15:09.645]  So I go out next to Shelly's and I regroup with my friends and I say, hey man, this is getting too...
[05:15:10.805 --> 05:15:12.927]  You know, too contentious, too feisty, let's just get out of here.
[05:15:13.107 --> 05:15:14.048]  Let's call it a day and go.
[05:15:14.088 --> 05:15:15.909]  We got some footage, like, let's take off.
[05:15:16.810 --> 05:15:27.840]  So we decide to do that, but then all of a sudden I see this guy, I see some yelling, like, off to the side, and it's a guy wearing a shirt and a jacket who's getting punched and hit on, and they're ganging up on him.
[05:15:28.300 --> 05:15:30.742]  Because that's how they fight, 20 on 1, right?
[05:15:31.002 --> 05:15:32.644]  He'll lose sometimes, you know.
[05:15:33.064 --> 05:15:33.925]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:15:34.025 --> 05:15:37.507]  And so he's running out, and so I see this and he's yelling for help.
[05:15:37.868 --> 05:15:39.609]  And I figure, okay, this is probably a Trump supporter.
[05:15:39.629 --> 05:15:44.352]  So I kind of like position myself in a way where I can get him behind me and then just push him into the alcove.
[05:15:44.672 --> 05:15:47.254]  And as I'm doing that, Vermin Supreme is like right next to me helping me out.
[05:15:47.595 --> 05:15:49.136]  Of all people, Vermin Supreme's right there.
[05:15:49.156 --> 05:15:50.176]  The guy with the boot on his head.
[05:15:50.236 --> 05:15:51.177]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:15:51.217 --> 05:15:52.158]  What an image that is.
[05:15:52.298 --> 05:15:53.419]  The free pony platform.
[05:15:54.319 --> 05:15:57.482]  So we get this guy in the restaurant, we talk to him, make sure his friend comes, and then we go to leave.
[05:15:57.502 --> 05:15:59.103]  So it's a group of about five of us.
[05:15:59.563 --> 05:16:01.385]  The only way out, of course, is through
[05:16:02.065 --> 05:16:02.885]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:16:17.293 --> 05:16:19.854]  One of the guys I was with must have said something to set him off.
[05:16:20.435 --> 05:16:24.557]  Because all of a sudden, from behind me, I start hearing, die Nazi, die.
[05:16:25.377 --> 05:16:26.898]  And I know that this is not going to go well.
[05:16:27.238 --> 05:16:28.859]  Regardless of what happens, this will not end well.
[05:16:30.020 --> 05:16:30.960]  For me, most likely.
[05:16:31.020 --> 05:16:35.062]  And so, I turn around, and we, at this point, have broken off from the main crowd.
[05:16:35.082 --> 05:16:39.204]  We're about 10 feet in front, or 10 feet away from them, most of us are.
[05:16:40.845 --> 05:16:46.129]  Then I hear the crowd getting louder, and they're obviously getting faster, and we know this is going to be an issue.
[05:16:46.169 --> 05:16:53.715]  So at that point, I turn back around and I start to walk a little bit faster, but then that's when it goes black.
[05:16:54.674 --> 05:16:57.396]  And I just hear a really loud ringing in my ears and I don't know what's going on.
[05:16:58.217 --> 05:16:59.277]  Obviously I've been hit with something.
[05:16:59.698 --> 05:17:02.940]  So I turn around and I see it was a white male.
[05:17:04.441 --> 05:17:06.222]  He was about 5 foot 10 to 6 foot 2.
[05:17:07.724 --> 05:17:09.645]  And he was holding a flagpole.
[05:17:09.905 --> 05:17:13.848]  And it was not like a balsa, like a Boy Scouts, you know, pine card derby type of wood.
[05:17:14.288 --> 05:17:15.789]  It was like solid wood.
[05:17:16.890 --> 05:17:17.751]  Bamboo or something?
[05:17:18.251 --> 05:17:18.511]  I don't know.
[05:17:18.531 --> 05:17:19.112]  It was thick, though.
[05:17:19.132 --> 05:17:19.973]  It was thick and it was heavy.
[05:17:19.993 --> 05:17:21.795]  Because he was holding it down at the end.
[05:17:21.815 --> 05:17:23.076]  It was like an eight-foot flagpole.
[05:17:23.096 --> 05:17:25.358]  And he'd swung it right down and it cracked me right here.
[05:17:25.398 --> 05:17:27.861]  You probably can't see it, but it's right here on the back of the head.
[05:17:29.222 --> 05:17:30.003]  And it connected.
[05:17:30.043 --> 05:17:33.767]  And so I felt, you know, obviously like I'd just been concussed or something.
[05:17:33.807 --> 05:17:37.670]  So I take off the hat and run my hand back through my hair.
[05:17:38.331 --> 05:17:39.572]  And I feel that it's wet.
[05:17:40.353 --> 05:17:43.034]  And I know that it should not be wet, and so I know that's a bad sign.
[05:17:43.414 --> 05:17:46.675]  And then I take it down, and I see from the light, yeah, that's full of blood.
[05:17:46.695 --> 05:17:47.595]  Jeez.
[05:17:48.075 --> 05:17:53.536]  And so at that point, I knew I was with five guys at the time, but I don't know, like, where the rest of them went.
[05:17:53.556 --> 05:17:55.217]  I just know that me and a buddy were able to make it out.
[05:17:55.857 --> 05:17:57.517]  Police officers did witness the whole thing.
[05:17:57.537 --> 05:17:58.358]  They did see who did it.
[05:17:58.938 --> 05:18:06.180]  But because the police were outnumbered, you know, at that point, like, 15 to 20 to two, there was nothing they could do.
[05:18:06.220 --> 05:18:06.800]  So they ran in.
[05:18:06.820 --> 05:18:07.880]  So there was no arrest made?
[05:18:09.349 --> 05:18:10.230]  Not to my knowledge, no.
[05:18:10.590 --> 05:18:13.072]  Did you see anyone get handcuffed or taken into custody?
[05:18:13.332 --> 05:18:15.614]  I was not fully conscious.
[05:18:16.034 --> 05:18:17.395]  I didn't black out at all.
[05:18:17.715 --> 05:18:20.577]  I did black out, but I didn't lose conscience or fall over at any point.
[05:18:20.897 --> 05:18:26.381]  But I don't really have a great recollection of what happened, so if I did see it, if he did get arrested, I don't know.
[05:18:26.661 --> 05:18:32.545]  And you know, and this is, this is actually, this is actually a really serious thing because, I mean, you could have been seriously hurt.
[05:18:32.885 --> 05:18:33.686]  You could have died.
[05:18:33.746 --> 05:18:39.309]  I mean, the odds are, you know, the odds are probably not that high, but I mean, if he hit you in the wrong place hard enough, you could have died.
[05:18:39.450 --> 05:18:41.251]  Well, you've got all kinds of stuff back there on the back of your head.
[05:18:41.271 --> 05:18:46.734]  You've got, you've got your occipital lobe and all kinds of stuff that, you know, regulate hearing, vision, all kinds of stuff.
[05:18:46.754 --> 05:18:53.739]  So even if it's not fatal or does serious, like, like brain damage necessarily, you can still lose a lot of sensory ability.
[05:18:53.779 --> 05:18:56.561]  But yeah, post-concussion syndrome is a serious thing.
[05:18:57.121 --> 05:19:03.606]  Yeah, but if I was, you know, 15, 20 years older, you know, and you're not... Or if it was vermin supreme, you know?
[05:19:03.626 --> 05:19:05.947]  Yeah, if it was an old man, you know, that's something that could kill him.
[05:19:06.188 --> 05:19:10.470]  Or a younger person, a younger kid, 14, 15, because there's kids at those events wearing Trump stuff.
[05:19:11.391 --> 05:19:15.034]  Yeah, no, it's clearly a case of assault with a deadly weapon, but...
[05:19:16.314 --> 05:19:30.504]  And at the same time, I don't want to say, I don't want to be critical of the police in this situation, because they did come in and pull us out pretty quickly, and they did, I think they were looking out for our safety paramount, but yeah, they saw the whole thing and there was nothing that was done.
[05:19:30.524 --> 05:19:37.770]  Because what I do remember is I turned around and I pointed out, hey, hey, hey, and I do remember yelling and pointing right at the guy, but the officer came in, and you know,
[05:19:38.530 --> 05:19:44.495]  Stuff like that's gonna happen, so it's obviously not okay, but like, I'm just glad that I was able to make it out before the second strike came, you know?
[05:19:44.515 --> 05:19:48.479]  Well, and let's kind of set the scene here too, because basically...
[05:19:49.682 --> 05:19:52.945]  They kind of like had that whole little street occupied there.
[05:19:52.965 --> 05:19:54.486]  So like, here's the National Press Club.
[05:19:54.506 --> 05:19:56.688]  I'm not sure where Shelley's was, but... Right across the street.
[05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:57.449]  Okay, okay.
[05:19:57.489 --> 05:19:58.370]  Was that the cigar bar?
[05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.870]  Yeah.
[05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.631]  Okay, okay.
[05:19:59.651 --> 05:20:01.152]  So yeah, it was literally right across the street.
[05:20:01.332 --> 05:20:01.492]  Yeah.
[05:20:01.512 --> 05:20:04.655]  So you've got the National Press Club, and then you've got the cigar bar that he's talking about right here.
[05:20:05.255 --> 05:20:13.783]  And you've got a line of police, probably like 40 or 50 of them, that are just arm to arm, shoulder to shoulder, protecting the entrance to the press club.
[05:20:14.283 --> 05:20:16.946]  And then in the middle of the street, right outside of the press club,
[05:20:17.606 --> 05:20:19.048]  It was, it was weird how they were doing it.
[05:20:19.068 --> 05:20:22.232]  I don't know if you experienced this too, but they were going like on hit and runs.
[05:20:22.673 --> 05:20:23.154]  Yeah.
[05:20:23.214 --> 05:20:26.738]  They would like, the street would be completely crowded and packed with all the protesters.
[05:20:27.179 --> 05:20:33.728]  And then they start throwing fireworks, throwing smoke bombs, throwing projectiles at the police, attacking people like you, and then they would all scatter.
[05:20:33.928 --> 05:20:34.609]  Right, right.
[05:20:54.326 --> 05:20:54.466]  No.
[05:20:54.847 --> 05:20:56.568]  I mean, I think that's ridiculous, honestly.
[05:20:56.588 --> 05:21:01.032]  I think that he should be, he should have certainly been taken into custody, probably arrested.
[05:21:01.052 --> 05:21:03.054]  I don't know what kind of charges they can levy against this guy.
[05:21:03.074 --> 05:21:06.257]  I don't think being outnumbered is an excuse, especially when you're holding firearms.
[05:21:06.297 --> 05:21:11.201]  Well, and here's my problem, and again, you know, we're trying to mend relationships with police.
[05:21:11.261 --> 05:21:17.126]  You know, Alex Jones has put out all the documentaries talking about martial law, the police state, so we've covered that ground.
[05:21:17.646 --> 05:21:20.089]  We were trying to, we're trying to mend ties with police, but
[05:21:21.550 --> 05:21:28.036]  It becomes difficult with a situation like this, because I witnessed a similar thing.
[05:21:28.096 --> 05:21:29.998]  I didn't get hit like you, but I'm standing here.
[05:21:30.967 --> 05:21:32.047]  And there's 50 police.
[05:21:32.447 --> 05:21:36.828]  Now I don't know, maybe they were off-duty and they were hired by the press club and they technically couldn't go do anything.
[05:21:37.229 --> 05:21:41.530]  But I'm standing here and I literally have people threatening me right in front of the police.
[05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.950]  They are threatening me.
[05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:48.091]  They are saying, we're going to attack you, we're going to hit you, you're going to get beat up white fascists, you're going to get killed.
[05:21:48.471 --> 05:21:51.252]  And I'm sitting there and I'm looking at the cops and I'm like, are you hearing this?
[05:21:52.052 --> 05:21:54.133]  So I guess my beef is...
[05:21:55.313 --> 05:22:02.157]  If they're going to get away with this stuff, if they're going to get away with literally assaulting you, you had to go pay hospital bills.
[05:22:02.197 --> 05:22:03.878]  I'm sure that this isn't a free trip for you.
[05:22:03.898 --> 05:22:05.680]  Yeah, I was in the hospital for about five hours that night.
[05:22:05.760 --> 05:22:06.160]  Exactly.
[05:22:06.180 --> 05:22:06.820]  That's not cheap.
[05:22:07.080 --> 05:22:07.721]  That's not cheap.
[05:22:08.161 --> 05:22:10.883]  So, who's being held accountable for that?
[05:22:11.543 --> 05:22:18.745]  And, you know, I'm not trying to demonize the police in this, but something has to be done here because there needs to be a precedent set to deter this in the future.
[05:22:19.005 --> 05:22:21.266]  If they keep doing this and getting away with it... It's getting worse.
[05:22:21.286 --> 05:22:21.786]  It's getting worse.
[05:22:21.806 --> 05:22:22.126]  Think about it.
[05:22:22.186 --> 05:22:23.926]  This punk that did this to you... It emboldens them, yeah.
[05:22:23.946 --> 05:22:24.486]  It totally emboldens them.
[05:22:24.506 --> 05:22:27.407]  You know he's going around, oh, I knocked this guy out.
[05:22:27.467 --> 05:22:28.507]  I'm a big tough guy.
[05:22:28.647 --> 05:22:33.749]  If you look at the anarchist subreddits, it's a big victory to them.
[05:22:33.829 --> 05:22:35.429]  Smash the fash, you know, all this stuff.
[05:22:35.609 --> 05:22:39.010]  They're burning places today, smashing limousines, busting up banks.
[05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:43.232]  Yeah, you guys are real brave going around with baseball bats, like attacking random businesses and attacking random people.
[05:22:43.272 --> 05:22:44.973]  Hitting people from behind.
[05:22:45.013 --> 05:22:46.214]  Yeah, while your face is covered.
[05:22:46.234 --> 05:22:47.534]  They love hitting people from behind.
[05:22:47.554 --> 05:22:49.195]  And then what do they do when you put them on camera?
[05:22:49.395 --> 05:22:52.637]  They put the sign in front of it because they don't want them to see their face.
[05:22:52.837 --> 05:22:53.017]  Yeah.
[05:22:53.117 --> 05:22:58.360]  I mean, if you were really that proud of what you're doing, you would not have a problem showing who you are and talking openly about what you're doing.
[05:22:58.380 --> 05:22:59.320]  That's why we go right on the streets.
[05:22:59.380 --> 05:23:00.181]  And that's interesting.
[05:23:00.441 --> 05:23:02.802]  Why are they so afraid to show their faces?
[05:23:03.242 --> 05:23:04.823]  It's because they want to commit crime.
[05:23:05.143 --> 05:23:05.303]  Yeah.
[05:23:05.363 --> 05:23:06.424]  And they're going to commit crime.
[05:23:06.724 --> 05:23:10.567]  It has nothing to do with, oh, we're trying to protect ourselves, we're worried about the government coming after us.
[05:23:10.587 --> 05:23:12.388]  The government's not coming after you.
[05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:23.236]  The government's more likely to come after patriot groups than it is to, at least the past government, than it is to go after these leftist socialist groups.
[05:23:23.276 --> 05:23:24.957]  Because that's the kind of stuff they promote.
[05:23:25.017 --> 05:23:31.842]  They promote that leftist socialist behavior and mentality in the schools, in the literature, in the movies.
[05:23:31.882 --> 05:23:33.163]  And they need the ignorant constituents.
[05:23:33.243 --> 05:23:34.444]  That's what they thrive off of.
[05:23:34.744 --> 05:23:34.924]  Yeah.
[05:23:35.224 --> 05:23:42.710]  And the police, oftentimes what they'll say, when you say, hey, why aren't you arresting this person, when they're making threats against you as a person, is they'll say, oh, we don't believe it's a credible threat.
[05:23:43.090 --> 05:23:49.655]  Because for police to arrest for a threat, when a threat is made like that, they need reason to believe that it's credible.
[05:23:50.055 --> 05:23:57.601]  But that whole argument kind of disappears when we see, and I haven't checked the news in the past couple hours, but I'm sure you're going to see many more cases like what happened to me.
[05:23:57.881 --> 05:23:59.642]  Well, it's like, what are you doing?
[05:24:00.102 --> 05:24:01.122]  The credibility is there.
[05:24:01.142 --> 05:24:03.583]  We know they're going to follow up with these threats when they make them.
[05:24:03.603 --> 05:24:06.144]  And we've seen the Project Veritas videos.
[05:24:06.164 --> 05:24:07.104]  I mean, we've heard it from the mouth.
[05:24:07.304 --> 05:24:09.365]  But again, this is the craziest thing about this to me.
[05:24:09.385 --> 05:24:11.665]  I mean, this is like a free-for-all out here.
[05:24:11.685 --> 05:24:22.689]  It's like, okay, if I want to go and act like a complete clown criminal in the streets, throwing fireworks around, inciting violence, knocking people out on the back of the head,
[05:24:23.456 --> 05:24:24.857]  I mean, it's just a free-for-all.
[05:24:24.957 --> 05:24:25.157]  Right.
[05:24:25.257 --> 05:24:26.818]  It's just a total free-for-all.
[05:24:27.079 --> 05:24:29.420]  But apparently, apparently you're allowed to do that.
[05:24:29.480 --> 05:24:32.403]  Apparently that's legal if you're a Trump protester.
[05:24:32.423 --> 05:24:42.610]  Apparently that's just okay if you're with some of these protests that I guess get the mainstream media coverage, they get justified by the mainstream media, by people like Obama, and then they just get to go.
[05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:43.711]  I mean, I'm sitting here thinking,
[05:24:45.410 --> 05:24:55.979]  If I'm, if I'm anywhere, okay, and I start throwing fireworks, if I'm in an inner city, right, just on a regular day, and I start going around throwing fireworks, I'm gonna be frickin' arrested!
[05:24:55.999 --> 05:24:56.359]  Yeah.
[05:24:56.619 --> 05:24:57.360]  And I should be!
[05:24:57.500 --> 05:24:57.720]  Yeah.
[05:24:58.080 --> 05:25:02.644]  But how are they doing it in the middle of the street on a crowded night with dozens of police around?
[05:25:02.724 --> 05:25:04.065]  It's the most mind-blowing thing.
[05:25:04.105 --> 05:25:13.573]  It's like, it's crazy because you're talking about how it's like, okay, we know this is gonna go on, we're gonna go capture some footage, and then you get there and it's literally smoke in the air, like frickin' craziness,
[05:25:13.993 --> 05:25:15.594]  You're like, the cops knew this was coming.
[05:25:15.614 --> 05:25:18.295]  The FBI, the National Guard, we knew this was coming.
[05:25:18.315 --> 05:25:19.616]  That's why we went there to film it.
[05:25:20.036 --> 05:25:21.657]  And they're still just letting it happen.
[05:25:21.757 --> 05:25:22.117]  I don't know.
[05:25:22.217 --> 05:25:25.378]  I don't know what the answer is, but something needs to happen.
[05:25:25.538 --> 05:25:30.321]  Apparently, the word is that Obama called for a stand down from the police.
[05:25:31.773 --> 05:25:33.235]  Last two days in office.
[05:25:33.315 --> 05:25:34.516]  I think he has the power to do that.
[05:25:34.576 --> 05:25:35.797]  In the name of political correctness.
[05:25:36.138 --> 05:25:36.618]  Exactly.
[05:25:36.638 --> 05:25:40.602]  It's because we don't want to go out and single people out for their beliefs or whatnot.
[05:25:40.762 --> 05:25:44.426]  And so if your belief is I get to hit you, that's okay.
[05:25:44.486 --> 05:25:45.286]  It would be suppressing.
[05:25:45.607 --> 05:25:47.489]  I would not want to suppress your free speech.
[05:25:47.529 --> 05:25:51.793]  And if your free speech is exercised through the end of a flagpole, by all means, go ahead and do it.
[05:25:51.813 --> 05:25:52.553]  Because that's free speech.
[05:25:52.674 --> 05:25:52.854]  Yeah.
[05:25:53.074 --> 05:25:53.494]  There you go.
[05:25:54.315 --> 05:25:56.417]  My free speech is ball-peen-hammer then, you know?
[05:25:56.457 --> 05:25:57.739]  I mean, it's just like, what are you going to do?
[05:25:57.779 --> 05:26:04.285]  Well, and look, I think it's very unfortunate if this is going to be the future of, you know, the political discourse.
[05:26:04.325 --> 05:26:11.733]  Because like I was saying, and this is something that if you watch videos that you do, especially that, you know, I do similar videos where you just go out and you talk to people, like,
[05:26:12.353 --> 05:26:15.235]  Oftentimes, you'll get people who will have reasonable conversations.
[05:26:15.255 --> 05:26:21.157]  I mean, more often than not, you get people who are just wanting to yell at you and call you names, but there are some people out there who will have conversations.
[05:26:21.177 --> 05:26:33.784]  But I think if we start seeing the amount of those people going down, and the amount of people who just want to take the law into their own hands, and to just, you know, use weapons and force instead of arguments, I think that's a really dangerous path to go down.
[05:26:33.864 --> 05:26:38.586]  And I'm glad you said that, because you know what would happen if we tried to take the law into our own hands.
[05:26:38.646 --> 05:26:38.826]  Oh, yeah!
[05:26:38.906 --> 05:26:39.687]  We would be arrested.
[05:26:40.507 --> 05:26:43.269]  And you talk about, you know, you hope that this isn't the future.
[05:26:43.449 --> 05:26:53.918]  I think we all hope that, and we're sitting here scratching our heads, because again, I talked about, you know, we have always talked about the police state, especially, you know, between Bush and Obama, the police state was something we always talked about.
[05:26:53.938 --> 05:26:56.279]  Everyone's had a bad experience with police, you know what I'm saying?
[05:26:56.800 --> 05:26:58.982]  But now, we're kind of all sitting here, it's like, you know what?
[05:26:59.762 --> 05:27:04.104]  I don't support the police doing no-knock raids to try to find some guy that might have marijuana.
[05:27:04.184 --> 05:27:06.666]  I don't support all of these little aspects of the police.
[05:27:06.686 --> 05:27:11.408]  I don't support the police wanting to stop and frisk or swab your tongue because you might be driving drunk at a stop.
[05:27:11.789 --> 05:27:14.750]  But I don't support the police being killed for no reason.
[05:27:14.770 --> 05:27:15.230]  That's what I'm saying.
[05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:21.534]  I don't support the police being victimized innocently and I do support police
[05:27:22.870 --> 05:27:25.512]  In an instance like yours, saying, go arrest the criminal.
[05:27:25.572 --> 05:27:27.013]  Go arrest that guy.
[05:27:27.114 --> 05:27:27.974]  Set an example.
[05:27:28.034 --> 05:27:31.657]  Otherwise, the future that you're talking about is going to be the reality.
[05:27:31.757 --> 05:27:37.842]  You're going to tell me they didn't have beanbag shotguns, they didn't have sonic cannons, they didn't have tear gas, they didn't have pepper spray.
[05:27:37.862 --> 05:27:40.365]  They had all that stuff and they could have easily arrested this guy.
[05:27:40.405 --> 05:27:42.887]  They started deploying tear gas conveniently after that incident.
[05:27:43.527 --> 05:27:44.268]  That's brutal.
[05:27:44.288 --> 05:27:45.310]  I had to inhale some of that.
[05:27:45.370 --> 05:27:49.316]  But I think that this is not something that is happening just in isolated incidents.
[05:27:49.336 --> 05:27:58.429]  I think it has to do with the whole, the theory that we've treated, not we, but that law enforcement has been treated with in this country for so long, where they're paralyzed in situations like that.
[05:27:58.929 --> 05:28:16.520]  They don't want to go in and if they have to arrest someone who is somehow disadvantaged, they don't want to get drugged through the mud and have their life destroyed in the media like all of these good cops have in cases where they did the justified thing and the right thing, but the media is so hell-bent on their narrative to be anti-police.
[05:28:16.880 --> 05:28:17.100]  Yeah.
[05:28:17.280 --> 05:28:17.440]  Right.
[05:28:33.251 --> 05:28:35.652]  Flew off on Air Force One, or no, Air Force Two.
[05:28:35.712 --> 05:28:38.433]  We saw him fly off today, and it was funny.
[05:28:38.553 --> 05:28:46.275]  Everybody looked up, and I was trying to get my camera, and by the time I got it out and turned it on, and the damn code put in, it was over the trees.
[05:28:46.535 --> 05:28:47.956]  But people were like, buy Obama!
[05:28:48.276 --> 05:28:49.176]  Buy Obama!
[05:28:49.316 --> 05:28:49.677]  That's it.
[05:28:50.137 --> 05:29:01.280]  But his last calling card was telling the police to stand down and let them harass, or not let them harass, but let protesters harass people who were just coming in to celebrate the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[05:29:01.320 --> 05:29:02.761]  And let's just think about everything that
[05:29:03.101 --> 05:29:06.384]  Has happened in the last 24 hours in regards to this subject matter.
[05:29:06.764 --> 05:29:09.947]  We've had businesses' windows smashed open, broken into.
[05:29:10.287 --> 05:29:13.009]  We've had cars smashed open and burned.
[05:29:13.029 --> 05:29:15.071]  I don't know if you saw that limousine that they set on fire.
[05:29:15.091 --> 05:29:16.532]  Yeah, we drove right by that in McPherson Square.
[05:29:16.572 --> 05:29:18.073]  We've had multiple college campuses.
[05:29:18.133 --> 05:29:23.158]  I've seen reports from Austin, Texas, UT, Ball State University in Indiana.
[05:29:23.238 --> 05:29:25.700]  I'm sure that this is going on at other universities, too.
[05:29:25.800 --> 05:29:30.904]  Special snowflakes are speaking out against the tyrannical Donald Trump.
[05:29:31.144 --> 05:29:32.846]  Violence is the language of the unheard.
[05:29:32.887 --> 05:29:35.771]  Having heard that quote, that's my favorite quote.
[05:29:36.011 --> 05:29:38.214]  And my guess is you're not the only person that this happened to.
[05:29:38.775 --> 05:29:39.576]  Did you ask them?
[05:29:39.616 --> 05:29:41.579]  Did they say that there were others that had a similar incident?
[05:29:42.159 --> 05:29:46.666]  Well, I didn't ask the police, but I've seen more reports, especially coming out from Deplorable.
[05:29:47.066 --> 05:29:50.011]  That one guy who I mentioned, his name is Caesar, I forget his last name.
[05:29:50.772 --> 05:29:52.835]  But yeah, he was beaten pretty bad.
[05:29:53.076 --> 05:29:56.141]  Thankfully he's like an amateur boxer, and when he got inside he was just laughing.
[05:29:56.181 --> 05:29:57.242]  He said, yeah, it's training to me.
[05:29:57.282 --> 05:29:57.863]  You know, it's training.
[05:29:57.883 --> 05:29:59.326]  They're all so weak they can't even throw punches properly.
[05:29:59.346 --> 05:29:59.907]  Yeah, we've seen interviews.
[05:29:59.927 --> 05:30:01.990]  People just cold-clocking people while they're talking on camera.
[05:30:02.110 --> 05:30:10.456]  But we saw, also today, Alex Jones saw this, of women being beaten up by these, you know, I call them leftist ninjas.
[05:30:10.516 --> 05:30:12.938]  They cover their faces, they're wearing all black.
[05:30:13.798 --> 05:30:18.782]  And I was with Josh Owens today, and we stood up to a couple as they were walking by with their flag.
[05:30:19.282 --> 05:30:21.564]  One guy, I said, I'm filming him, and I said, hey!
[05:30:22.344 --> 05:30:24.205]  What happened to stopping the inauguration?
[05:30:25.406 --> 05:30:29.389]  And he turned and then he started talking about some nonsense about Alex.
[05:30:29.769 --> 05:30:31.370]  But didn't want to debate me on anything else.
[05:30:31.850 --> 05:30:35.192]  And then ran off and they all said, ooh, frogs, gay frogs.
[05:30:35.312 --> 05:30:37.874]  And I'm like, nothing.
[05:30:37.994 --> 05:30:40.196]  Oh, yeah.
[05:30:40.216 --> 05:30:41.036]  They don't want to see that.
[05:30:41.056 --> 05:30:41.757]  They don't want to see that.
[05:30:41.817 --> 05:30:46.900]  Now, hey, as we go to break, we're going to come back where I think we have Leanne McAdoo, Margaret Howe and Dara McBreen.
[05:30:47.220 --> 05:30:49.021]  I think they're going to take the 14 hour
[05:30:50.262 --> 05:30:52.764]  It's an inauguration broadcast to the end.
[05:30:52.784 --> 05:30:55.145]  To infinity and beyond!
[05:30:55.305 --> 05:30:57.867]  If you guys want to stay in and talk more, I'm sure they'll banter with you.
[05:30:57.887 --> 05:31:02.069]  I'm going to take a little break and I've got to get my gear together.
[05:31:02.089 --> 05:31:08.012]  We've got another big day tomorrow and I have the feeling there's going to be some stuff going on tonight if there hasn't already gone on.
[05:31:08.052 --> 05:31:11.835]  Hopefully we didn't miss anything and we can go out there and catch these
[05:31:13.237 --> 05:31:15.798]  These frickin' dicks doing this.
[05:31:15.858 --> 05:31:16.618]  I can say that now.
[05:31:16.878 --> 05:31:17.518]  That's what they are.
[05:31:17.578 --> 05:31:25.980]  They're just assholes going out there screwing with people because they have nothing better to do in their lives because they really have no other motivation other than being a loser.
[05:31:26.060 --> 05:31:26.840]  And that's what I said.
[05:31:27.300 --> 05:31:28.861]  They've never experienced winning.
[05:31:29.261 --> 05:31:31.461]  And when you were talking to that guy, this is a true story.
[05:31:31.681 --> 05:31:33.622]  And that's why when you were talking to that guy, you were like, dude.
[05:31:34.082 --> 05:31:35.924]  You can join the winning team, man.
[05:31:36.264 --> 05:31:37.686]  Like, join the winning team.
[05:31:37.786 --> 05:31:38.407]  Be a winner.
[05:31:38.547 --> 05:31:40.889]  Like, look at the smile that we have on our face, man.
[05:31:41.089 --> 05:31:42.090]  We're having a good time.
[05:31:42.331 --> 05:31:45.894]  You're out in the streets crying and bellyaching over Hillary Clinton!
[05:31:46.415 --> 05:31:47.356]  A piece of crap!
[05:31:47.816 --> 05:31:48.557]  I'm being polite!
[05:31:49.158 --> 05:31:50.459]  A child rapist defender.
[05:31:50.799 --> 05:31:53.882]  And so if you're out there fighting for a child rapist defender, what does that make you?
[05:31:54.203 --> 05:31:56.886]  That makes you a child rapist defender defender.
[05:31:58.390 --> 05:32:10.734]  All right, hey, before we go to break, I just want to remind everybody who's watching right now at Infowars.com forward slash show or on our Facebook feed that we have launched the Combat One Skin Protecting Wipes, previously only available from the DOD.
[05:32:10.974 --> 05:32:12.675]  These are military-grade hygiene wipes.
[05:32:12.715 --> 05:32:22.298]  It's basically like a shower in a bag if you're out in the woods or if you're behind enemy lines or if you're... Someone cuts you while you're out in the field.
[05:32:22.318 --> 05:32:23.058]  Can they remove blood?
[05:32:23.658 --> 05:32:25.339]  Well, I don't think it'll remove blood.
[05:32:25.380 --> 05:32:27.181]  Basically, they're antibacterial wipes.
[05:32:27.581 --> 05:32:34.187]  And so these things will, say you've been running around, jogging, whatever, and you're disgustingly sweaty.
[05:32:34.347 --> 05:32:39.831]  Or you've been at a, let's say you've been out in the inauguration all day long.
[05:32:40.532 --> 05:32:40.632]  Yeah.
[05:33:11.373 --> 05:33:14.355]  Along with water filtration, you're a freaking idiot.
[05:33:14.995 --> 05:33:23.781]  Because if the power goes out, if a hurricane hits, if an earthquake hits, and trucks aren't bringing food to people, you're going to be hungry.
[05:33:24.262 --> 05:33:27.244]  Because the stores only have a couple days worth of food.
[05:33:27.564 --> 05:33:35.490]  So do yourself a favor, do your family a favor, stock up on some food, have some storable food, at least a month supply on standby.
[05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:36.650]  You never know.
[05:33:36.871 --> 05:33:38.192]  Hey, and it might not be for you.
[05:33:38.492 --> 05:33:39.733]  It might be for your neighbor.
[05:33:40.313 --> 05:33:44.514]  Your neighbor's house burns down or your neighbor has some trouble and you want to help them out.
[05:33:44.814 --> 05:33:47.355]  That's another good way to do it because we do have to start helping each other out.
[05:33:47.375 --> 05:33:51.016]  We do and people I know do this, but we have to be looking.
[05:33:51.096 --> 05:33:59.979]  We have this great opportunity for the next four years and hopefully the next eight to really change the direction that our country is going in.
[05:34:00.399 --> 05:34:02.741]  And so, don't forget to stock up on that storable food.
[05:34:02.981 --> 05:34:06.043]  And also, we're having the Make Your Bodies Great Again sale.
[05:34:06.083 --> 05:34:06.823]  It's ending soon.
[05:34:07.384 --> 05:34:11.706]  And we're going to have, right now they have specials on Brain Force, 30% off.
[05:34:11.967 --> 05:34:14.268]  Super Male Vitality, 30% off.
[05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:15.389]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[05:34:15.609 --> 05:34:16.209]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[05:34:16.229 --> 05:34:17.730]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:18.251]  Knockout, 20% off.
[05:34:18.271 --> 05:34:18.791]  And Prostagard, 20% off.
[05:34:18.811 --> 05:34:20.232]  As their last chance to get these specials and
[05:34:28.397 --> 05:34:32.979]  Everything you buy at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com helps support what we are doing.
[05:34:33.019 --> 05:34:41.861]  It helps pay for the cameras, the people bringing them here, these ridiculously overpriced Airbnbs that we had to resort to because the hotels were all booked up.
[05:34:42.061 --> 05:34:51.224]  But actually, it's better to go with Airbnb because we get a little more room and able to make a little more, a little bit of a studio home here with some fabulous
[05:34:53.425 --> 05:34:55.547]  People are asking about the artwork.
[05:34:55.747 --> 05:35:01.932]  Well, you know, the lady who owns this place, I think she's a chiropractor or something.
[05:35:01.952 --> 05:35:03.553]  She had all this stuff all over the walls.
[05:35:03.593 --> 05:35:05.255]  He's the great technical hand that sets it all up.
[05:35:05.275 --> 05:35:08.057]  We don't really have an interior designer that travels with us.
[05:35:08.117 --> 05:35:08.317]  No.
[05:35:08.457 --> 05:35:12.521]  So maybe we should just... It's literally black tablecloth and whatever we can find to throw on the walls.
[05:35:12.541 --> 05:35:14.242]  We need to get the InfoWars flags is what we need to do.
[05:35:14.282 --> 05:35:15.043]  Go get our flags.
[05:35:15.603 --> 05:35:16.943]  We got great flags, too.
[05:35:17.003 --> 05:35:17.924]  There was a couch, yeah.
[05:35:18.024 --> 05:35:19.404]  They moved the couch in that room.
[05:35:19.504 --> 05:35:20.444]  Everything's been rearranged.
[05:35:20.484 --> 05:35:26.586]  It was Zimmerman and Josh who came up here a couple days earlier, so we'll give them a couple of yeah, yeah, yeahs.
[05:35:26.706 --> 05:35:27.346]  Good job, guys.
[05:35:27.946 --> 05:35:32.907]  And, you know, really, the Unsung Heroes are the behind-the-scenes guys who are editing video.
[05:35:32.967 --> 05:35:34.628]  Gavin is over here working with Millie.
[05:35:34.888 --> 05:35:38.609]  They're a great team that have, you know, come, and they're going to start working in February.
[05:35:39.309 --> 05:35:43.330]  Move down to Austin and start working with us in studio, doing some more projects.
[05:35:43.410 --> 05:35:45.071]  And so we really are growing.
[05:35:45.371 --> 05:35:46.511]  This is the time to get in.
[05:35:46.531 --> 05:35:48.432]  I mean, we're winning right now.
[05:35:48.792 --> 05:35:50.492]  Join us here at InfoWars.com.
[05:35:50.512 --> 05:35:54.013]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or just spread the link.
[05:35:54.113 --> 05:35:55.474]  Spread the link to this broadcast.
[05:35:55.934 --> 05:35:59.295]  So that, you know, others can see what's going on with the real media.
[05:35:59.516 --> 05:36:00.696]  We are not the fake media.
[05:36:00.916 --> 05:36:02.237]  We are not the prestitute media.
[05:36:02.557 --> 05:36:06.218]  We are not beholden to any large multinational company.
[05:36:06.358 --> 05:36:12.141]  All we do is sell products that we make and manufacture ourselves, and then other products that we think are really good, like the water filters out there.
[05:36:12.181 --> 05:36:14.782]  We have some really great water filters as well, so check those out.
[05:36:15.482 --> 05:36:16.622]  The LifeStraw is really good.
[05:36:16.863 --> 05:36:17.883]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:36:17.903 --> 05:36:18.963]  We have some amazing t-shirts.
[05:36:19.204 --> 05:36:20.184]  Trump is my president!
[05:36:20.484 --> 05:36:21.525]  I saw a ton of those today.
[05:36:21.565 --> 05:36:24.527]  Get your damn Drop Is My President t-shirt, man.
[05:36:24.567 --> 05:36:25.748]  They were handed out.
[05:36:25.848 --> 05:36:29.591]  They were a ton of the new Hillary for Prison with George Soros, the goblin on the back.
[05:36:29.611 --> 05:36:30.712]  The goblin?
[05:36:30.732 --> 05:36:31.092]  Yeah.
[05:36:31.413 --> 05:36:31.833]  Oh, man.
[05:36:31.853 --> 05:36:33.094]  Because he is a goblin.
[05:36:33.114 --> 05:36:34.015]  He's a total goblin.
[05:36:34.055 --> 05:36:35.336]  We have to get rid of these people.
[05:36:35.596 --> 05:36:42.201]  And the only way is to call them out and keep calling them out to where it becomes part of the culture, where people look and go, George Soros is a freaking goblin.
[05:36:42.221 --> 05:36:43.202]  Is that who you're talking about?
[05:36:43.242 --> 05:36:43.902]  That goblin guy?
[05:36:43.942 --> 05:36:44.563]  Yeah, that goblin.
[05:36:44.583 --> 05:36:45.183]  That goblin guy?
[05:36:45.203 --> 05:36:46.244]  With the bags under his eyes?
[05:36:46.444 --> 05:36:47.105]  Exactly, exactly.
[05:36:47.125 --> 05:36:48.146]  That real Palpatine-looking guy?
[05:36:49.327 --> 05:36:50.748]  So I'm going to punch out here for the night.
[05:36:50.768 --> 05:36:56.972]  I think Owen's going to stay and roundtable with the rest of the crew and hopefully take you till 10 p.m.
[05:36:57.513 --> 05:37:03.057]  Central Time where we will have then accomplished 14 hours of the inauguration special.
[05:37:03.337 --> 05:37:11.844]  Thank you for watching at InfoWars.com forward slash show or on our Facebook Alex Jones or on our YouTube channel or even streaming it live on YouTube.
[05:37:12.244 --> 05:37:13.806]  So spread those links around.
[05:37:14.466 --> 05:37:21.150]  Join us in the fight for freedom and liberty in the spirit of 1776, because that, at the end of the day, is what matters.
[05:37:21.411 --> 05:37:25.173]  The more people we have involved, the faster this thing is going to turn around.
[05:37:25.573 --> 05:37:29.396]  And thank God we have Donald Trump as our 45th President of the United States.
[05:37:29.616 --> 05:37:32.038]  And with that, we'll be right back after this short break.
[05:37:42.691 --> 05:37:47.476]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[05:37:47.637 --> 05:37:54.785]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[05:37:54.945 --> 05:37:57.368]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[05:37:57.788 --> 05:37:59.350]  And I started to try to eat healthy.
[05:37:59.570 --> 05:38:01.211]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[05:38:01.612 --> 05:38:03.413]  Started seeing some more gains.
[05:38:03.954 --> 05:38:14.344]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[05:38:14.484 --> 05:38:14.764]  Boom!
[05:38:15.185 --> 05:38:16.606]  Weight started pouring off.
[05:38:16.706 --> 05:38:18.608]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[05:38:19.068 --> 05:38:20.249]  Then, by early 2016,
[05:38:22.291 --> 05:38:25.633]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[05:38:25.653 --> 05:38:26.734]  But the election heated up.
[05:38:26.774 --> 05:38:29.156]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[05:38:29.276 --> 05:38:38.522]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[05:38:38.742 --> 05:38:39.703]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[05:38:39.883 --> 05:38:43.566]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[05:38:44.366 --> 05:38:50.432]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[05:38:50.452 --> 05:38:51.813]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[05:38:51.873 --> 05:38:55.437]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[05:38:57.267 --> 05:38:59.088]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[05:38:59.488 --> 05:39:00.988]  I'm religiously taking the products.
[05:39:01.408 --> 05:39:04.049]  And in just one week, I thought I'd lose 2 or 3 pounds.
[05:39:04.409 --> 05:39:10.891]  I've lost 5 pounds, religiously taking just, what, 4 or 5 of the products.
[05:39:11.291 --> 05:39:11.811]  It's amazing.
[05:39:12.091 --> 05:39:14.472]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[05:39:14.772 --> 05:39:17.433]  Go read the 5-star reviews for yourself.
[05:39:21.141 --> 05:39:21.761]  Well, here we are.
[05:39:21.801 --> 05:39:22.902]  Another week has passed.
[05:39:23.482 --> 05:39:35.586]  If memory serves, I lost five pounds the first week, three pounds the next, and only one pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[05:39:35.606 --> 05:39:37.547]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[05:39:38.027 --> 05:39:40.948]  I've lost a pound, so we're now up to nine pounds.
[05:39:41.980 --> 05:39:46.163]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens with this experiment.
[05:39:46.183 --> 05:39:47.805]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[05:39:47.825 --> 05:39:49.886]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[05:39:50.747 --> 05:39:55.431]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[05:39:55.971 --> 05:39:58.433]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[05:39:58.553 --> 05:40:00.075]  Let's see what happens next week.
[05:40:04.071 --> 05:40:06.272]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[05:40:06.392 --> 05:40:11.135]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[05:40:11.876 --> 05:40:25.004]  I did have better, more intense workouts because of Supermail and just what it does to my mental picture, but taking the entire family of InfoWars live products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids,
[05:40:25.584 --> 05:40:28.128]  Taking it all religiously every day but once or twice.
[05:40:28.608 --> 05:40:31.211]  So I started in like, I don't know, December 3rd, 4th or so.
[05:40:31.372 --> 05:40:35.677]  Finished, what was it, about January 4th was the last day of the final photos I took just a few days ago.
[05:40:35.877 --> 05:40:38.100]  Then I left town for a few days, that's why this is a voice memo.
[05:40:38.441 --> 05:40:39.262]  I didn't shoot the final.
[05:40:40.527 --> 05:40:43.089]  But what I'm getting at is, it really does work.
[05:40:43.369 --> 05:40:47.253]  Despite the fact that the day after Christmas, I ate almost an entire pie.
[05:40:47.553 --> 05:40:52.217]  My mother had brought over a pumpkin pie, and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[05:40:52.637 --> 05:40:55.459]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge...
[05:40:56.460 --> 05:40:57.801]  Well, you know how it is, folks.
[05:40:57.921 --> 05:40:58.602]  Hot cocoa.
[05:40:58.642 --> 05:41:06.047]  It's just, since I was a kid, the only time I've had a lot of sweets is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas, and I just picked out this year.
[05:41:06.567 --> 05:41:08.108]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[05:41:08.128 --> 05:41:09.329]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[05:41:09.369 --> 05:41:11.891]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[05:41:12.792 --> 05:41:13.652]  This isn't going to happen.
[05:41:13.732 --> 05:41:16.654]  But we went ahead and did the experiment, and I still lost some weight.
[05:41:17.295 --> 05:41:18.496]  It wasn't as much as I'd wanted to.
[05:41:19.156 --> 05:41:33.727]  But to me, it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other, you know, things that are in the products in me helped me, uh, just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[05:41:34.187 --> 05:41:34.908]  It's hard to believe.
[05:41:35.248 --> 05:41:37.630]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:40.632]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[05:41:43.694 --> 05:41:46.637]  We will make America great again!
[05:41:50.154 --> 05:41:51.735]  All right, and welcome back.
[05:41:51.755 --> 05:41:58.878]  We are now entering almost the 14th hour of our 14th Hour Freedom Fest here, covering the presidential inauguration.
[05:41:59.358 --> 05:42:01.599]  Myself, Darren McBreen, the rest of the crew.
[05:42:01.659 --> 05:42:06.181]  We've got Owen Schroyer there in DC, as well as Margaret Howell in studio.
[05:42:06.221 --> 05:42:06.621]  Bravo.
[05:42:07.281 --> 05:42:10.883]  And apparently making his debut tonight, Merlin Jetson.
[05:42:10.963 --> 05:42:11.443]  What's up, Merlin?
[05:42:11.483 --> 05:42:13.664]  We're all here to celebrate Trump's victory.
[05:42:13.684 --> 05:42:17.526]  And he is officially the president of the United States of America.
[05:42:18.433 --> 05:42:19.454]  So we've been speaking... Merlin?
[05:42:19.474 --> 05:42:20.134]  Oh, Donald Trump.
[05:42:20.174 --> 05:42:20.794]  Yes, Merlin.
[05:42:21.054 --> 05:42:21.775]  Merlin, yes.
[05:42:22.255 --> 05:42:24.556]  So we've got a ton of really great videos.
[05:42:24.656 --> 05:42:26.637]  A dude's got one that he just put out.
[05:42:26.677 --> 05:42:26.977]  Proof.
[05:42:27.137 --> 05:42:28.558]  Commies are idiots.
[05:42:28.598 --> 05:42:33.721]  And apparently, you know, dude just kind of sat there and let the camera roll and... It's all you have to do.
[05:42:34.281 --> 05:42:35.361]  You just let him talk.
[05:42:35.421 --> 05:42:37.122]  Just give him an audience there for a moment.
[05:42:37.602 --> 05:42:42.403]  But we were kind of watching that footage in the back room of our guest.
[05:42:42.463 --> 05:42:44.364]  Is this AllSup, Jason AllSup?
[05:42:44.704 --> 05:42:44.944]  Sorry.
[05:42:45.984 --> 05:42:57.427]  And my gosh, did you not think that those, all those black clad skinny jean hipsters like angry at their dad are a little bit scary?
[05:42:57.447 --> 05:43:01.488]  I mean they were like tiny little cockroaches just scurrying about smashing windows and
[05:43:02.408 --> 05:43:03.269]  Don't scare me too much.
[05:43:03.369 --> 05:43:04.449]  You weren't scared of them?
[05:43:04.469 --> 05:43:07.691]  I mean, there was riots in Washington today.
[05:43:07.991 --> 05:43:13.875]  They threw flash bombs, they lit some trash cans on fire, but overall they didn't really do much damage.
[05:43:13.955 --> 05:43:18.597]  I mean, the President, Donald Trump, there was never really any threat posed to him.
[05:43:19.138 --> 05:43:23.920]  So, and then Disrupt J-20, who said they were going to paralyze the city!
[05:43:25.041 --> 05:43:28.284]  That didn't happen, so they failed miserably, just like they failed in life.
[05:43:28.304 --> 05:43:28.985]  John Bowne.
[05:43:29.325 --> 05:43:42.256]  I guess they were able to block some of the access points for a lot of people, weren't able to actually access the inauguration, and so of course that fed into CNN's narrative that nobody showed up, which was a total lie because you could see it was a jam-packed crowd.
[05:43:42.296 --> 05:43:44.098]  I did see a video though, it pissed me off.
[05:43:44.298 --> 05:43:49.342]  They formed a line, and there was men and women in uniform that had tickets to the inauguration.
[05:43:50.393 --> 05:43:52.355]  Air Force guys, and they were like, no!
[05:43:52.836 --> 05:43:53.837]  They wouldn't let me.
[05:43:53.857 --> 05:43:53.897]  No!
[05:43:54.738 --> 05:43:55.599]  No, how dare you!
[05:43:55.619 --> 05:43:56.520]  I mean, how disrespectful.
[05:43:56.540 --> 05:44:01.746]  I know that you fought, and probably some, you know, you've known people who have died for my right to stand here and lock arms.
[05:44:01.766 --> 05:44:02.447]  A fascist war!
[05:44:03.834 --> 05:44:04.514]  My goodness.
[05:44:04.734 --> 05:44:06.635]  I mean, point made, I guess.
[05:44:07.316 --> 05:44:14.459]  So I know we've got Margaret Howell back in Studio Bravo, and also Owen Schroyer is going to be sticking around with us through the rest of the hour.
[05:44:14.479 --> 05:44:17.280]  So what do you think?
[05:44:17.320 --> 05:44:19.461]  Should we throw to a video here?
[05:44:19.481 --> 05:44:21.102]  I mean, what do the people want?
[05:44:21.142 --> 05:44:23.884]  We're watching them dancing now at their inaugural ball.
[05:44:24.424 --> 05:44:25.424]  If they have it queued up.
[05:44:25.524 --> 05:44:27.145]  Nothing like a Devorah Ball last night.
[05:44:27.165 --> 05:44:32.007]  Pitt Daniels has a good video of some protesters throwing flash bombs on the street.
[05:44:32.027 --> 05:44:33.028]  Maybe we could take a look at that?
[05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.510]  Maybe?
[05:44:35.870 --> 05:44:36.351]  Maybe?
[05:44:36.371 --> 05:44:39.393]  Alright, standby.
[05:44:39.433 --> 05:44:39.933]  Sorry, guys.
[05:44:40.014 --> 05:44:42.956]  Well, and my gosh, like, just some of the footage coming out of D.C.
[05:44:42.976 --> 05:44:49.280]  today with them throwing the garbage cans and burning the newspaper stands and the kiosks and... You know what I thought was funny?
[05:44:49.300 --> 05:44:56.646]  They were smashing out the windows of the Bank of America building, and I was thinking, Bank of America, they gave Hillary Clinton like a half a million dollars.
[05:44:57.483 --> 05:44:59.784]  Well, also, too, they're asking for, like, support.
[05:44:59.824 --> 05:45:02.484]  Like, help us get to D.C.
[05:45:02.564 --> 05:45:04.585]  We hate capitalism, but we need your money.
[05:45:04.605 --> 05:45:12.687]  So it's like they're asking for capitalism and using, you know, GoFundMe and things like that, which, you know, I'm pretty sure GoFundMe doesn't exist in places.
[05:45:12.707 --> 05:45:14.968]  They don't have a clue.
[05:45:16.508 --> 05:45:18.729]  A lot of these people are really, really dumb.
[05:45:19.449 --> 05:45:20.409]  Dumber than dumb and dumber.
[05:45:22.028 --> 05:45:23.749]  Well, things even out there now.
[05:45:24.029 --> 05:45:25.129]  Alright, Margaret Howell.
[05:45:25.169 --> 05:45:26.549]  I'm hearing a Margaret Howell.
[05:45:26.569 --> 05:45:27.570]  Can I pipe in?
[05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:29.630]  I'm like, look at these dancers.
[05:45:29.770 --> 05:45:30.191]  Oh my gosh.
[05:45:30.631 --> 05:45:33.432]  First of all, can we just say, that is harder than it looks.
[05:45:33.452 --> 05:45:35.012]  You've got the whole world staring.
[05:45:35.072 --> 05:45:36.392]  You have to look natural.
[05:45:36.573 --> 05:45:37.893]  I'm like, you're having a good time.
[05:45:38.093 --> 05:45:38.693]  Exactly.
[05:45:38.753 --> 05:45:40.914]  I'm lovingly at your partner's face.
[05:45:43.951 --> 05:45:51.396]  Forgive me for interrupting this gorgeous evening, and I hate to, and I just want to say all of our production people, they are totally in love with Melania Trump.
[05:45:51.496 --> 05:45:52.817]  I'm sorry guys, but you are.
[05:45:52.857 --> 05:45:54.018]  They were like, look at this!
[05:45:54.178 --> 05:45:54.919]  She is stunning.
[05:45:55.019 --> 05:45:55.399]  She's stunning.
[05:45:55.419 --> 05:45:56.260]  Well, who isn't?
[05:45:56.420 --> 05:45:58.882]  Yeah, well, just kudos to the crew in general.
[05:45:58.922 --> 05:46:05.447]  Everyone's doing a kick-ass job here with this 14-hour Freedom Fest inaugural broadcast.
[05:46:05.487 --> 05:46:06.528]  That's harder than it looks.
[05:46:06.568 --> 05:46:09.430]  You know, they made it look natural, I have to say.
[05:46:09.870 --> 05:46:10.150]  Yeah.
[05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:11.151]  Well, and it's interesting.
[05:46:11.171 --> 05:46:14.054]  I mean, have you watched many inaugurations, Darren?
[05:46:14.214 --> 05:46:21.420]  Because I don't, I don't, I know there's like a lot, just like with a wedding or something, you have your traditions that you always, you do these certain things.
[05:46:21.480 --> 05:46:24.363]  And so this is the special dance that all the families do.
[05:46:24.383 --> 05:46:28.626]  To be honest, I just haven't been really interested in it because Bush and then Obama.
[05:46:28.686 --> 05:46:29.207]  Exactly.
[05:46:29.227 --> 05:46:30.728]  I've just tuned out.
[05:46:31.228 --> 05:46:31.989]  But this is awesome.
[05:46:32.249 --> 05:46:37.013]  Yeah, these little ceremonies go way back, back into time.
[05:46:38.936 --> 05:46:39.316]  Look at Margaret.
[05:46:39.336 --> 05:46:40.598]  Guys, they look like royals.
[05:46:40.658 --> 05:46:41.038]  They do.
[05:46:41.058 --> 05:46:42.179]  I'm sorry, but they do.
[05:46:42.199 --> 05:46:42.880]  They do.
[05:46:42.920 --> 05:46:44.602]  Margaret, she is totally gushing.
[05:46:44.642 --> 05:46:45.623]  You have got... I am.
[05:46:45.723 --> 05:46:47.244]  This is not our royal family.
[05:46:47.284 --> 05:46:48.646]  We've got to hold them... That's true.
[05:46:48.666 --> 05:46:50.267]  We have got to hold them to account.
[05:46:50.327 --> 05:46:50.908]  It's very hard.
[05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:59.817]  We were... Actually, Margaret and I were just talking about this a little earlier, how difficult it is because we both are so excited and just really happy and what a great day and we're all feeling like, yes!
[05:47:00.137 --> 05:47:00.698]  That's true.
[05:47:00.718 --> 05:47:04.325]  They made that dance look good, guys.
[05:47:04.385 --> 05:47:09.073]  We don't want to be those ridiculous criers that were crying over Obama 8 years ago.
[05:47:09.675 --> 05:47:11.117]  The Messiah is here!
[05:47:12.526 --> 05:47:14.387]  Well, check this out.
[05:47:14.507 --> 05:47:15.807]  It was a fantastic speech.
[05:47:15.867 --> 05:47:19.268]  The inaugural speech by President Trump was outstanding.
[05:47:20.068 --> 05:47:20.408]  Who was it?
[05:47:20.468 --> 05:47:24.430]  Was it you that said that, watch, they're going to say it's Hitler all over again or something?
[05:47:24.530 --> 05:47:26.590]  I thought, well, you know, even the mainstream media.
[05:47:26.610 --> 05:47:27.550]  Would they go that far?
[05:47:27.771 --> 05:47:29.091]  Yes, they will go that far.
[05:47:29.551 --> 05:47:32.532]  MSNBC, this is what Rachel Maddow had to say.
[05:47:32.612 --> 05:47:38.914]  She said that Trump's America First speech has very dark echoes in American history.
[05:47:39.841 --> 05:47:40.181]  Wow.
[05:47:40.842 --> 05:47:46.585]  See, this is interesting because we were all kind of waiting to see how would, and I actually asked this question.
[05:47:46.606 --> 05:47:47.746]  How are they going to spin it to Hitler?
[05:47:47.786 --> 05:47:50.828]  I asked Owen this question earlier and Owen was like, yeah, you're totally right.
[05:47:50.928 --> 05:47:59.554]  And how could they take that speech that was so inclusive, so powerful, it was all about we the people, not me, me, me, I, I, I. How would they spin it?
[05:47:59.714 --> 05:48:00.355]  And boom.
[05:48:00.375 --> 05:48:01.015]  Wait, there's more.
[05:48:01.075 --> 05:48:01.395]  Boom.
[05:48:01.836 --> 05:48:02.376]  Oh, there's more.
[05:48:02.396 --> 05:48:05.078]  ABC journalist Terry Moran, moron.
[05:48:06.359 --> 05:48:09.121]  He said Trump's speech reminded him of the 1930s.
[05:48:09.321 --> 05:48:16.808]  It carries with it overtones from the 1930s with an anti-semitic movement saying we don't want to get involved in Europe's war.
[05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:19.750]  It's the Jews' fault in Germany.
[05:48:20.031 --> 05:48:24.434]  He said that on national television talking about Donald Trump's speech.
[05:48:25.275 --> 05:48:26.056]  Unbelievable.
[05:48:26.116 --> 05:48:28.458]  And they wonder why their ratings are tanking.
[05:48:28.598 --> 05:48:50.809]  Well it's so funny because Margaret and I were speaking with Adam Curry earlier and he was talking about the fact that we have, we're basically in split versions of reality right now and there are people on completely opposite, and we were saying that with his speech, some of us were looking at his speech going, wow this is amazing, whereas some people were looking at it going, this reminds me of the 1930s, you know, and you're like, what?
[05:48:51.209 --> 05:48:52.890]  I didn't get that from that speech at all.
[05:48:52.910 --> 05:48:53.770]  I didn't see it.
[05:48:53.790 --> 05:48:53.830]  No.
[05:48:54.490 --> 05:48:56.972]  No, there was a lot of zingers in there.
[05:48:57.112 --> 05:48:57.612]  Diversion.
[05:48:58.246 --> 05:49:02.488]  Yes, and we're going to hear that speech, clips of it, forever.
[05:49:02.768 --> 05:49:03.808]  Well, now at least we know.
[05:49:03.908 --> 05:49:06.870]  See, here's the thing that happens every single Friday night at InfoWars.
[05:49:06.890 --> 05:49:08.971]  We think, okay, you know, clocking out for the night.
[05:49:09.071 --> 05:49:21.576]  No, something happens and we know we're going to get right back to work because now we're going to have to fight back against all these idiots putting out their stupid dissectment of this speech and saying how it's Hitler.
[05:49:21.616 --> 05:49:22.836]  Oh, it reminded me of this speech.
[05:49:23.317 --> 05:49:23.997]  I'm sure they had it
[05:49:24.657 --> 05:49:32.322]  I don't want to give Fox News a free pass either because everybody always gives them a free pass when it comes to Donald Trump.
[05:49:33.003 --> 05:49:36.785]  They've acted just like the mainstream media and mostly Bill O'Reilly.
[05:49:36.845 --> 05:49:38.246]  I mean that guy is just unreal.
[05:49:38.286 --> 05:49:45.151]  Well let's not forget they did have that sort of coup in the middle of the campaigning and like they split off and you know Megyn Kelly's leaving.
[05:49:45.171 --> 05:49:47.172]  Yeah they were all about Jeb Bush.
[05:49:47.292 --> 05:49:49.374]  Thank God they have Tucker Carlson there.
[05:49:50.054 --> 05:49:51.155]  Lou Dobbs is awesome.
[05:49:51.175 --> 05:49:53.336]  So they do have some really good anchors at Fox News.
[05:49:54.997 --> 05:49:58.480]  I know we still got Owen on the line here, just kind of hanging out.
[05:49:59.881 --> 05:50:01.943]  Guys, Owen hasn't been in the office for what?
[05:50:02.423 --> 05:50:02.603]  A day?
[05:50:02.663 --> 05:50:03.104]  Two days?
[05:50:03.264 --> 05:50:04.165]  I already miss him!
[05:50:04.185 --> 05:50:05.125]  I really do!
[05:50:05.165 --> 05:50:07.067]  I'm like, where is Owen?
[05:50:07.087 --> 05:50:08.828]  Speak for yourself!
[05:50:09.108 --> 05:50:12.411]  And there he is with James Alsup.
[05:50:12.791 --> 05:50:13.332]  What is this?
[05:50:13.612 --> 05:50:14.733]  The two of you together?
[05:50:14.753 --> 05:50:15.253]  I don't know.
[05:50:16.809 --> 05:50:17.890]  No, I'm just kidding.
[05:50:17.911 --> 05:50:22.296]  The protesters can't stand a chance against these two young white males.
[05:50:22.416 --> 05:50:24.619]  We've unleashed Owen on DC.
[05:50:24.820 --> 05:50:26.302]  Owen, are you going back out later?
[05:50:26.322 --> 05:50:28.164]  Because I want to see you combat these guys.
[05:50:28.224 --> 05:50:30.727]  I mean, I'm sure the protests will be going on until, what?
[05:50:31.588 --> 05:50:31.949]  Yeah.
[05:50:32.149 --> 05:50:33.191]  All through tomorrow, for sure.
[05:50:34.432 --> 05:50:36.413]  You can't really get anywhere in D.C.
[05:50:36.453 --> 05:50:38.615]  without walking, so we're going to have to walk through them.
[05:50:39.175 --> 05:50:42.077]  I'm not sure if we'll, I mean, I'm sure we'll experience something.
[05:50:42.097 --> 05:50:43.678]  I'm not sure if they have anything planned.
[05:50:43.698 --> 05:50:46.500]  I'm sure they're resting up for their big Women's March tomorrow.
[05:50:47.020 --> 05:50:50.823]  Are you going to grab any of the ladies in the hats?
[05:50:51.605 --> 05:50:52.586]  Uh, in the pussy hats?
[05:50:52.646 --> 05:50:52.906]  Yes.
[05:50:53.106 --> 05:50:56.867]  Those are a lot of cats at home, by the way, guys.
[05:50:57.068 --> 05:50:59.809]  I called out a couple of these women that were harassing me.
[05:50:59.989 --> 05:51:01.910]  I was just having a conversation with this guy.
[05:51:01.930 --> 05:51:12.755]  We were just having a political conversation, and these two women, they were wearing their pussy hats, and they turn around and they were like, oh, like, you're racist, you know, you're racist, misogynist, white supremacist, days are over.
[05:51:13.975 --> 05:51:18.398]  I'm like, I'm like, you have a, I go, I literally, I literally go, you have a pussy hat on.
[05:51:19.038 --> 05:51:22.480]  And she goes, these are the women's march hats, we don't say that word.
[05:51:22.500 --> 05:51:25.902]  I was like, no, you made the word up, pussy hat, okay?
[05:51:26.162 --> 05:51:26.463]  Own it.
[05:51:27.403 --> 05:51:32.106]  But it was funny, because we were talking, because he, unfortunately, you know, he's got his bloody hat here.
[05:51:32.126 --> 05:51:34.047]  He unfortunately gets assaulted.
[05:51:34.067 --> 05:51:34.387]  Great memento.
[05:51:34.407 --> 05:51:35.568]  He gets assaulted last night.
[05:51:35.708 --> 05:51:38.910]  I knock on wood, and I'm just glad that I've never actually had that happen.
[05:51:39.250 --> 05:51:42.152]  But, but I don't know if you guys, I mean, I was saying this, I'm like, look.
[05:51:43.544 --> 05:51:44.445]  James, did you get stitches?
[05:51:44.465 --> 05:51:44.925]  I'm done.
[05:51:45.126 --> 05:51:45.586]  I'm done.
[05:51:45.906 --> 05:51:46.267]  I'm done.
[05:51:46.647 --> 05:51:51.532]  Yeah, yeah, I did actually twice within a one hour period at the Deplora Ball.
[05:51:51.572 --> 05:51:54.715]  Yeah, I was outside and I was talking to a guy.
[05:51:54.735 --> 05:52:08.128]  We were having a pretty civil conversation and then one of the guys who was, of course, like we were mentioning earlier, he was, you know, under five feet tall, wearing a balaclava, dressed in all black, and of course he had an anti-fascist flag with him, right?
[05:52:08.508 --> 05:52:13.269]  He comes up and he starts pushing on me, and pushing on me, and I turn around and I say, hey man, like, you know, knock it off.
[05:52:13.309 --> 05:52:14.190]  You gotta stop doing that.
[05:52:14.610 --> 05:52:19.731]  And then he does for a second, and then I turn back around, and he does it again, but harder, and he's pushing on me more.
[05:52:20.211 --> 05:52:25.292]  And I tell him, like, hey man, like, if you keep doing that, I'm gonna defend myself, so don't, you know, keep pushing on me.
[05:52:25.312 --> 05:52:25.913]  Don't keep touching me.
[05:52:27.873 --> 05:52:36.055]  Then I spin back around to go finish the conversation with the guy, and then all of a sudden, my McAmerica Gradiant hat is taken, you know, from the top of my head.
[05:52:36.075 --> 05:52:37.055]  It's a beautiful hat.
[05:52:37.215 --> 05:52:40.836]  And the limited edition, you know, very nice touch.
[05:52:41.216 --> 05:52:52.318]  And then, so I reach around and I grab the guy before he can get away, and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some other guy who was like six feet away a second ago, is all of a sudden like, his right fist is right here.
[05:52:52.338 --> 05:52:54.638]  You can kind of still see it, it's gone down.
[05:52:54.658 --> 05:52:57.019]  You got a little bit of a, yeah, I can kind of see right there.
[05:52:57.179 --> 05:52:58.940]  Yeah, it's gone down quite a bit in the past day.
[05:52:58.980 --> 05:53:00.642]  So it's mostly healed up.
[05:53:01.462 --> 05:53:02.303]  But he just punches me.
[05:53:02.363 --> 05:53:07.867]  But what they didn't know is that like a quarter to a half of the people they're demonstrating were actually like undercover cops.
[05:53:08.107 --> 05:53:14.672]  There were so many undercover cops around that as soon as he did that, he had a cop on top of him who he then punched, which was another charge for him.
[05:53:15.893 --> 05:53:19.456]  And he was arrested, he was tased, and he was booked pretty much immediately.
[05:53:19.496 --> 05:53:21.658]  So he's getting a couple assault charges.
[05:53:21.678 --> 05:53:25.300]  Yeah, I know Shoyer was a little bit, you know,
[05:53:26.221 --> 05:53:27.562]  Owen, you're a little bit hesitant.
[05:53:27.602 --> 05:53:30.163]  You're like, I'm going, but you know, I got to admit, I'm a little nervous.
[05:53:30.243 --> 05:53:30.764]  I'm a little nervous.
[05:53:30.784 --> 05:53:33.005]  It's a good thing to take a turn out there.
[05:53:33.305 --> 05:53:36.867]  I wasn't as, I wasn't like, I mean, it was for me, it was, I was faced with two things.
[05:53:36.927 --> 05:53:39.748]  Either the globalists are going to try to pull something extreme.
[05:53:39.928 --> 05:53:40.749]  And I was worried about that.
[05:53:41.289 --> 05:53:48.253]  Or, I was faced with the fact, because I was kind of talking with you guys about this, it was this, I'm sick of doing the exact same thing.
[05:53:48.293 --> 05:53:55.458]  Like, I've already talked to hundreds, if not thousands of these protesters, and they all parrot the exact same talk.
[05:53:55.678 --> 05:53:57.379]  There's never any new discussion.
[05:53:57.399 --> 05:53:58.960]  There's never anything refreshing.
[05:53:58.980 --> 05:54:00.461]  How rude can you be?
[05:54:01.121 --> 05:54:03.102]  It's like beating my head against a wall.
[05:54:04.262 --> 05:54:09.023]  But the thing that I was kind of worried about, to be honest with you, you know, a lot of people are always commending me.
[05:54:09.043 --> 05:54:10.624]  They're like, how do you keep a cool head?
[05:54:10.684 --> 05:54:13.064]  How do you, you know, maintain your composure and all this stuff?
[05:54:13.424 --> 05:54:15.345]  And I'm sitting here like, I'm done!
[05:54:15.705 --> 05:54:16.545]  Like, I'm done!
[05:54:16.645 --> 05:54:17.405]  If people in D.C.
[05:54:17.465 --> 05:54:19.826]  are going to try to F with me, I'm done.
[05:54:20.466 --> 05:54:21.547]  You know, I'm done with it.
[05:54:21.567 --> 05:54:22.327]  I'm not taking it anymore.
[05:54:22.347 --> 05:54:24.968]  So you're going to yell at women tomorrow?
[05:54:25.308 --> 05:54:25.548]  No.
[05:54:25.908 --> 05:54:26.548]  No, I'm not going to.
[05:54:26.588 --> 05:54:28.108]  You're like, I'm done!
[05:54:28.168 --> 05:54:29.349]  And like, rip your shirt off.
[05:54:30.629 --> 05:54:32.110]  Give me one of your pussy hats!
[05:54:32.170 --> 05:54:33.451]  It would be so triggered.
[05:54:33.511 --> 05:54:35.913]  Who's going to be at the Women's March?
[05:54:35.933 --> 05:54:37.294]  I don't even know much about it.
[05:54:37.314 --> 05:54:39.035]  Too much aggressive, alpha-white maleness.
[05:54:39.095 --> 05:54:39.835]  I don't know about that.
[05:54:39.855 --> 05:54:40.996]  Who's doing the Women's March?
[05:54:41.036 --> 05:54:42.357]  Oh, that's going to be the big thing.
[05:54:42.397 --> 05:54:45.039]  Tomorrow's going to be the big thing with the Women's March.
[05:54:45.279 --> 05:54:46.480]  Oh yeah.
[05:54:46.520 --> 05:54:47.140]  Here's the thing.
[05:54:47.660 --> 05:54:51.963]  They have their permit and they're claiming they're expecting 200,000 people.
[05:54:52.043 --> 05:54:53.724]  I'm not buying that for one second.
[05:54:53.744 --> 05:54:53.864]  No way.
[05:54:54.245 --> 05:54:55.686]  Because we are on...
[05:54:56.866 --> 05:55:00.549]  On Thursday, I didn't see as many pussyhats on Thursday.
[05:55:00.689 --> 05:55:03.872]  I've seen a total of less than 20 my entire time here.
[05:55:03.912 --> 05:55:07.475]  And five of those were in one group of people on their way here.
[05:55:07.695 --> 05:55:11.358]  I don't think they're going to get, I wouldn't say even 100,000, I would say probably more like 20 or 30.
[05:55:11.398 --> 05:55:14.741]  Especially if this weather keeps up and it's rainy and gross and cold.
[05:55:15.542 --> 05:55:18.364]  Comparatively, it's not going to be nearly what they expect.
[05:55:18.664 --> 05:55:22.785]  I'm hoping to actually, you know what guys?
[05:55:23.106 --> 05:55:25.106]  Maybe I'll bring you guys home some pussy hats.
[05:55:25.246 --> 05:55:27.587]  Please bring me one home.
[05:55:27.847 --> 05:55:28.467]  I want one.
[05:55:28.487 --> 05:55:30.948]  I want one, yes.
[05:55:31.068 --> 05:55:32.289]  I'll take one in any color.
[05:55:32.309 --> 05:55:35.110]  Well they're all in pink pretty much from what I've seen.
[05:55:35.210 --> 05:55:35.810]  Yay!
[05:55:36.250 --> 05:55:36.750]  I want one.
[05:55:37.490 --> 05:55:39.671]  I cannot help but admire the art behind you guys.
[05:55:40.071 --> 05:55:41.832]  You could just yank one off someone's head.
[05:55:42.392 --> 05:55:44.753]  Well, I'm not going to do anything illegal, but you know.
[05:55:45.253 --> 05:55:50.014]  There are some guys wearing pussy hats, so maybe somebody tries to get into fisticuffs with me.
[05:55:50.334 --> 05:55:52.755]  And then you're going to be like, what are you going to do about it, pussy?
[05:55:53.175 --> 05:55:54.815]  Excuse me.
[05:55:54.835 --> 05:55:55.936]  Grab him by the pussy hat.
[05:55:55.976 --> 05:56:01.077]  Hey, as soon as they yank off the Make America Great hat, you know, you could just grab one of their hats.
[05:56:01.117 --> 05:56:01.677]  You could do a trade.
[05:56:01.697 --> 05:56:02.157]  Yeah, a little trade-off.
[05:56:02.177 --> 05:56:03.378]  Grab him by the pussy hat, man.
[05:56:04.458 --> 05:56:07.899]  It's a fair trade, except this is actually a good-looking hat that they ruined here.
[05:56:09.077 --> 05:56:10.778]  That's a great memento.
[05:56:10.818 --> 05:56:14.419]  I think it's enhanced, though, and I think the blood adds collectible value to it.
[05:56:14.459 --> 05:56:17.901]  In fact, I think that you need to go to the Smithsonian tomorrow and be righteous.
[05:56:17.921 --> 05:56:18.521]  You could sell it on eBay.
[05:56:18.561 --> 05:56:20.342]  Just give it to the Smithsonian tomorrow.
[05:56:20.402 --> 05:56:23.303]  Just say, hey, look, guys, you're going to want this in the future.
[05:56:24.123 --> 05:56:27.725]  The Nazis came up and they hit me in the back of the head with a bamboo flagpole.
[05:56:28.345 --> 05:56:29.066]  Yeah, you were there.
[05:56:29.086 --> 05:56:32.607]  It's just like people who had a chunk of the wall, the Berlin Wall, when it came down.
[05:56:32.627 --> 05:56:33.387]  It's like, there you go.
[05:56:33.687 --> 05:56:34.088]  That right there.
[05:56:34.148 --> 05:56:35.868]  And now that Trump is in charge, anything's possible.
[05:56:36.048 --> 05:56:37.049]  So we've got a chance.
[05:56:37.489 --> 05:56:43.793]  Hey, but do you guys agree that, don't you think that Donald Trump is going to take less vacations than any president in history?
[05:56:44.233 --> 05:56:47.855]  And if he does take a vacation, I bet he's gonna use, I bet he would use his own money.
[05:56:48.295 --> 05:56:48.756]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:56:48.776 --> 05:56:57.301]  I mean, he might have to pay for his Secret Service, but... Well, he's already cutting down on some of the presidential, you know, executive privileges.
[05:56:57.381 --> 05:56:58.621]  He's already cutting some of that.
[05:56:58.682 --> 05:57:00.142]  He's already trying to cut spending.
[05:57:00.423 --> 05:57:02.024]  He's already talking about cutting his own pay.
[05:57:02.064 --> 05:57:04.545]  Or didn't he say he'd like donate his entire salary or something?
[05:57:04.685 --> 05:57:07.907]  He doesn't think a dollar is something I think by law.
[05:57:07.967 --> 05:57:14.810]  But you know, the thing about Donald Trump that I think people don't talk about enough, I think that he really enjoys his work.
[05:57:15.351 --> 05:57:25.256]  I think that for him to get in here and get, you know, figure out the gears in the mesh of American politics and the United States government, the executive branch and everything,
[05:57:25.896 --> 05:57:28.798]  I think he's really going to get a lot of fulfillment and enjoyment out of that.
[05:57:28.878 --> 05:57:33.880]  I think that this is something that Donald Trump is looking forward to and he's excited to do it.
[05:57:33.920 --> 05:57:35.161]  He really wants to get in there.
[05:57:35.201 --> 05:57:36.321]  He really wants to figure it out.
[05:57:36.361 --> 05:57:40.103]  He really wants to, I think, be there for the American people.
[05:57:40.203 --> 05:57:43.705]  He wants to actually be us getting in the gears, getting in the mesh.
[05:57:44.025 --> 05:57:44.825]  Owen, I hear you.
[05:57:44.845 --> 05:57:49.527]  I hear what Owen's saying about him enjoying his work, but don't you think that's a burden of love?
[05:57:49.547 --> 05:57:57.611]  I mean, I kind of see him as a burden of love kind of guy, where he's like, I love this country, I love these people, I'm gonna take this on, it might kill me.
[05:57:57.631 --> 05:58:05.054]  I remember one of his campaign speeches where he was just like, you know what, my only way to get to heaven is to be president and save this country.
[05:58:05.374 --> 05:58:08.055]  The heart's in there too, along with just the love of the work.
[05:58:08.575 --> 05:58:10.356]  There seems to be something else motivating him.
[05:58:10.376 --> 05:58:12.537]  He wants his legacy to be
[05:58:13.457 --> 05:58:16.398]  Be known as the best president in United States history.
[05:58:16.658 --> 05:58:19.959]  He's not there to cheat the system and come out a richer man.
[05:58:20.039 --> 05:58:22.699]  He's already been there, done that.
[05:58:23.179 --> 05:58:26.620]  I know the guy's heart is in it and he's for real, man.
[05:58:26.660 --> 05:58:31.401]  No, just watching them walk down the steps today and even Melania, just you could see it.
[05:58:31.721 --> 05:58:37.622]  It was like, wow, this is a huge job that we are here to do, the American people have entrusted us with.
[05:58:37.642 --> 05:58:39.143]  He credits the American people.
[05:58:39.263 --> 05:58:39.923]  I'm just a messenger.
[05:58:40.063 --> 05:58:40.724]  That's what he said.
[05:58:40.804 --> 05:58:42.065]  I'm just a messenger.
[05:58:42.125 --> 05:58:44.048]  This is an American people movement.
[05:58:44.088 --> 05:58:48.913]  With the others you could just sense their hubris and you could sense they're like, yes, I'm the president now.
[05:58:49.414 --> 05:58:51.756]  It's just like you could see the pride kind of like soothing.
[05:58:52.117 --> 05:58:57.403]  Or with them they were almost very humble because they were realizing the massive responsibility.
[05:58:57.463 --> 05:59:00.306]  I just never thought I'd live to see the day.
[05:59:00.526 --> 05:59:06.688]  When we would have an anti-establishment guy become president and take it to the global, it's just amazing.
[05:59:06.848 --> 05:59:15.071]  Make it okay to appoint someone who wants to, you know, let's actually, maybe the science isn't settled on vaccines or climate change or, you know, these other things.
[05:59:15.091 --> 05:59:17.011]  Let's get some people in there who can actually shake things up.
[05:59:17.031 --> 05:59:18.612]  Don't put the science out there and you decide.
[05:59:19.172 --> 05:59:24.234]  Well, and let's remember something here too, as we're talking about Donald Trump and the burden of love and everything.
[05:59:25.355 --> 05:59:29.421]  The energy behind this campaign was unprecedented.
[05:59:29.581 --> 05:59:30.683]  Absolutely.
[05:59:30.843 --> 05:59:39.277]  The emotions, and I'm telling you, just going to these events, and you can talk about your experiences too here, but from my experience, going to these events,
[05:59:40.034 --> 05:59:51.937]  The energy, the positivity, I don't even know, I always say this and I'm just going to say it again, it's like for sports fans walking into the stadium that's just buzzing before the big playoff game.
[05:59:52.178 --> 05:59:57.919]  You're walking up, the hairs on your arm are starting to stand up, you can hear the ambiance, you can feel it, it's an atmosphere.
[05:59:58.219 --> 06:00:00.080]  That was palpable at Donald Trump rallies.
[06:00:00.300 --> 06:00:02.821]  That's probably unprecedented in politics.
[06:00:02.921 --> 06:00:03.861]  And you've got to remember,
[06:00:04.401 --> 06:00:06.142]  Donald Trump is the head of this movement.
[06:00:06.242 --> 06:00:07.402]  It is we the people.
[06:00:07.502 --> 06:00:08.402]  He gives us the credit.
[06:00:08.443 --> 06:00:09.583]  But he is the guy.
[06:00:09.903 --> 06:00:10.943]  He is the spearhead.
[06:00:11.003 --> 06:00:12.304]  He feels that energy.
[06:00:12.324 --> 06:00:14.625]  And America is energized.
[06:00:14.685 --> 06:00:16.045]  We're energized right now.
[06:00:16.365 --> 06:00:17.866]  Optimistic about the future.
[06:00:18.306 --> 06:00:23.108]  And don't buy the mainstream media's bullshit that America is divided.
[06:00:23.228 --> 06:00:23.768]  I don't buy it.
[06:00:23.948 --> 06:00:26.171]  I mean, people, we are united now more than ever in my lifetime.
[06:00:26.191 --> 06:00:29.014]  That is the mainstream media and the lying politicians.
[06:00:29.034 --> 06:00:31.477]  This is a very important talking point for us to defeat.
[06:00:31.497 --> 06:00:33.299]  This is a very important paradigm for us to defeat.
[06:00:33.920 --> 06:00:37.584]  America is divided because of the liars on the television news.
[06:00:38.045 --> 06:00:39.406]  That's why America is divided.
[06:00:39.426 --> 06:00:43.211]  If you want to throw the John McCains and those people in there too, that's fine with me.
[06:00:43.311 --> 06:00:45.613]  And your communist teachers in the universities.
[06:00:45.793 --> 06:00:46.293]  Absolutely.
[06:00:46.573 --> 06:00:58.982]  Well, when we come back from this really quick break, we're actually going to play that clip again of Donald Trump being sworn in and a little bit of his speech where you can see what we're talking about, this little bit of excitement, Americana coming back, making America great again.
[06:00:59.382 --> 06:01:01.564]  And we will all be here on the flip side.
[06:01:01.644 --> 06:01:02.365]  See you in just a minute.
[06:01:03.786 --> 06:01:06.427]  We will make America great again!
[06:01:14.062 --> 06:01:15.563]  There is a crisis in America today.
[06:01:16.023 --> 06:01:18.424]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[06:01:18.724 --> 06:01:26.127]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[06:01:26.527 --> 06:01:30.149]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[06:01:30.489 --> 06:01:31.629]  I have the answer for you today.
[06:01:32.049 --> 06:01:33.230]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[06:01:33.939 --> 06:01:37.022]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone and it's safe.
[06:01:37.543 --> 06:01:39.264]  No radiation compartment.
[06:01:39.685 --> 06:01:45.451]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[06:01:46.272 --> 06:01:48.734]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[06:01:48.954 --> 06:01:54.940]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[06:01:55.561 --> 06:01:57.323]  With the Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[06:01:57.803 --> 06:02:00.467]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[06:02:00.807 --> 06:02:09.157]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own lock and pocket.
[06:02:10.058 --> 06:02:11.140]  Everyone please stand.
[06:02:29.721 --> 06:02:32.804]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[06:02:32.824 --> 06:02:36.609]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[06:02:36.629 --> 06:02:40.453]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[06:02:40.853 --> 06:02:42.895]  That I will faithfully execute.
[06:02:43.536 --> 06:02:45.719]  That I will faithfully execute.
[06:02:45.939 --> 06:02:48.622]  The office of President of the United States.
[06:02:49.002 --> 06:02:51.944]  The office of President of the United States.
[06:02:52.344 --> 06:02:54.325]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[06:02:54.826 --> 06:02:57.007]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[06:02:57.367 --> 06:02:59.428]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[06:02:59.869 --> 06:03:01.670]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[06:03:01.950 --> 06:03:03.951]  The Constitution of the United States.
[06:03:04.071 --> 06:03:06.433]  The Constitution of the United States.
[06:03:06.593 --> 06:03:07.413]  So help me God.
[06:03:07.653 --> 06:03:08.494]  So help me God.
[06:03:09.014 --> 06:03:10.255]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[06:04:18.706 --> 06:04:29.060]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[06:04:55.242 --> 06:05:09.790]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[06:05:15.532 --> 06:05:29.245]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[06:05:31.367 --> 06:05:39.274]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[06:05:40.734 --> 06:05:42.356]  We will face challenges.
[06:05:42.957 --> 06:05:44.619]  We will confront hardships.
[06:05:45.260 --> 06:05:47.302]  But we will get the job done.
[06:05:48.744 --> 06:05:54.951]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[06:05:56.078 --> 06:06:06.822]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[06:06:07.482 --> 06:06:09.783]  They have been magnificent.
[06:06:10.103 --> 06:06:10.543]  Thank you.
[06:06:18.026 --> 06:06:19.527]  Today's ceremony, however,
[06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:22.351]  Has very special meaning.
[06:06:23.231 --> 06:06:29.394]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[06:06:30.054 --> 06:06:31.634]  Or from one party to another.
[06:06:32.315 --> 06:06:36.436]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[06:06:36.997 --> 06:06:40.078]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[06:06:49.443 --> 06:06:50.643]  All right, and welcome back.
[06:06:50.723 --> 06:06:53.424]  You are joining all of us here at InfoWars.
[06:06:53.484 --> 06:06:56.065]  This is our 14-hour Freedom Fest.
[06:06:56.105 --> 06:06:58.385]  We are covering Donald Trump's inauguration.
[06:06:58.505 --> 06:07:01.986]  He is the 45th president of the United States of America.
[06:07:02.746 --> 06:07:08.548]  Apparently, all of the protesters and all of the resistors were not able to stop that from happening.
[06:07:09.268 --> 06:07:11.948]  And, you know, we're all here just witnessing history.
[06:07:12.068 --> 06:07:16.049]  On the one hand, we're thinking this is amazing, ready to move on to bigger and better things.
[06:07:16.069 --> 06:07:18.550]  And then on the flip side, we have people who truly think
[06:07:19.170 --> 06:07:21.831]  The end of the world is nigh.
[06:07:22.171 --> 06:07:26.613]  And these protests, I was going to say, are nationwide, but they're just small, little, whiny-ass protests.
[06:07:26.653 --> 06:07:29.173]  It's like a gnat in your ear.
[06:07:29.193 --> 06:07:30.114]  Well, that's what's interesting.
[06:07:30.154 --> 06:07:39.357]  As we know, George Soros and Michael Moore and these others are really pushing, who else was it, the other race baiter, Al Sharpton, really pushing for this.
[06:07:39.997 --> 06:07:48.143]  The season of civil disobedience and the season of protest, really hoping that they can just carry on these false narratives and keep, you know, the anger and the hatred going.
[06:07:48.163 --> 06:07:53.547]  See, these guys gotta hang out with their own crowds now because once they get outside of their realm, people hate them.
[06:07:53.567 --> 06:07:58.871]  You know, you see Al Sharpton, he goes into black communities and they all run up to him and it's like, man, you're phony, man.
[06:07:58.891 --> 06:08:01.073]  They know that he is like a used car salesman.
[06:08:01.093 --> 06:08:02.534]  Same with Snoop Dogg.
[06:08:02.554 --> 06:08:03.495]  Yeah, seriously, nobody cares.
[06:08:03.515 --> 06:08:05.897]  Snoop Dogg, I mean, all these guys, I'm telling you.
[06:08:06.617 --> 06:08:13.840]  We are winning, and the more these protesters act like fools, we're recruiting more and more people.
[06:08:14.681 --> 06:08:15.641]  You know, that's what happened.
[06:08:16.041 --> 06:08:17.302]  Absolutely.
[06:08:17.342 --> 06:08:19.943]  We're actually thanking them because they've helped our goal.
[06:08:20.243 --> 06:08:23.425]  One of the main reasons why Trump got elected to begin with.
[06:08:23.445 --> 06:08:26.266]  Everyone keeps saying, you're just guaranteeing Trump 2020.
[06:08:26.406 --> 06:08:32.389]  It's like Zoe Saldana said, she said, look, all these people in Hollywood are arrogant bullies.
[06:08:32.929 --> 06:08:34.030]  People are sick of you.
[06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:40.734]  People don't realize that when undecided voters are people who aren't like hard for Trump or hard against Trump, they see this.
[06:08:41.074 --> 06:08:45.117]  You know, they see these people rioting and wanting to shut down cities and calling for a season of protesting.
[06:08:45.577 --> 06:08:46.898]  Most people just want to get on with their lives.
[06:08:46.958 --> 06:08:49.760]  Most people don't want to live in the past of this election cycle.
[06:08:50.220 --> 06:08:50.721]  I don't know.
[06:09:06.033 --> 06:09:10.135]  James, don't you think that the left, the left, you know, they don't understand that people get that.
[06:09:10.155 --> 06:09:17.778]  People were really hurting, hurting for the past eight years, you know, making no money, can't feed their kids, you know, trying to do it in an honest way.
[06:09:17.798 --> 06:09:25.881]  They miss those people, you know, the Lena Dunham's of the world, those stupid scissor kicks, you know, the big, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not big.
[06:09:25.901 --> 06:09:28.222]  You don't even need to finish it, we can tell by the look on your face.
[06:09:28.482 --> 06:09:31.224]  You know, it's just like, it's like, what are you thinking?
[06:09:31.284 --> 06:09:35.828]  And John Lewis boycotting the inauguration on behalf of all black people.
[06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:38.310]  But he has dementia and can't remember the last time.
[06:09:38.330 --> 06:09:41.192]  I know a lot of people that voted, black people that voted for Donald Trump.
[06:09:41.312 --> 06:09:43.093]  He doesn't speak for Jim Brown.
[06:09:43.494 --> 06:09:51.640]  And I think too, and actually we talked to a woman, the video is on YouTube, we talked to a woman from John Lewis's district and she basically gave him, ripped him a new one.
[06:09:51.860 --> 06:09:52.981]  She's like, John, you haven't done anything.
[06:09:53.001 --> 06:09:54.682]  You're a total fraud.
[06:09:55.303 --> 06:10:06.732]  And the thing is about what James just said, I think that we had an election cycle this year where many people entered the election cycle with the same mindset that was, OK, I'm sick of the establishment.
[06:10:07.092 --> 06:10:10.014]  I've been screwed by the Republicans and Democrats one too many times.
[06:10:10.435 --> 06:10:12.036]  I kind of have an open mind here.
[06:10:12.196 --> 06:10:13.036]  I'm not really sure.
[06:10:13.076 --> 06:10:15.197]  I don't seem to like anyone, but I'm kind of open-minded.
[06:10:15.577 --> 06:10:25.320]  And then, like James was talking about, they see all this behavior and they just gravitate toward Donald Trump because all of this degenerative behavior is associated with the anti-Trump movement.
[06:10:25.440 --> 06:10:38.063]  Yeah, when Trump talks about law and order and Trump says, I'm the law and order candidate, when there's people out in your city who are, you know, cracking the windows to your Starbucks and burning down your bank, you're more likely to vote for the guy who says, yeah, we need law and order instead of the woman like Hillary Clinton who says, oh,
[06:10:38.063 --> 06:10:44.910]  Well yeah, these people are protesting for legitimate reasons and who give so much support to Black Lives Matter and organizations who fuel this kind of anger.
[06:10:45.191 --> 06:10:54.060]  So they're totally playing into Trump's hand but they don't realize that their narrative, that we need to protest, we need to destroy, we need to hurt the opposition,
[06:10:54.901 --> 06:10:58.064]  Is counterproductive at the ballot box, and that's where it really ends up mattering.
[06:10:58.164 --> 06:11:03.968]  And it needs to be on the record that you were assaulted during Obama's final night.
[06:11:04.028 --> 06:11:07.611]  Yeah, Trump wasn't president when you were assaulted.
[06:11:07.671 --> 06:11:20.381]  I saw a great tweet that had one of the pictures that was taken directly after he got hit in the head with a flagpole by the Antifa kids, and then it had some other pictures of the cities burning, you know, Ferguson burning, St.
[06:11:20.401 --> 06:11:20.661]  Louis.
[06:11:21.001 --> 06:11:21.281]  I don't
[06:11:43.914 --> 06:11:52.100]  Throwing a fit and just throwing things and they're yelling and screaming and just freaking out and their parents like, okay, honey, I see you.
[06:11:52.180 --> 06:11:58.144]  Have you guys ever seen those like mass heaters that they put on the sides of like football fields?
[06:11:58.224 --> 06:11:58.424]  Yeah.
[06:11:58.585 --> 06:12:00.526]  It's like a huge mass heater.
[06:12:00.546 --> 06:12:01.627]  It's like a huge fan.
[06:12:01.687 --> 06:12:04.169]  It's like five foot wide, five foot tall.
[06:12:04.509 --> 06:12:04.969]  You know what?
[06:12:05.069 --> 06:12:10.173]  Donald Trump and the Trump movement is like one of those things and these people are like little snowflakes.
[06:12:10.708 --> 06:12:12.328]  They just trickle down, and then he comes to see that.
[06:12:12.388 --> 06:12:13.369]  And they're like melting.
[06:12:13.449 --> 06:12:16.509]  And then they're just gone.
[06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:18.350]  Very, very good analogy.
[06:12:18.410 --> 06:12:22.131]  You've been to a lot of these protests, these anti-Trump rallies and all that.
[06:12:22.171 --> 06:12:24.731]  Don't you see the same people, though, in different states?
[06:12:24.871 --> 06:12:25.472]  Actually, yes.
[06:12:25.492 --> 06:12:25.812]  That's weird.
[06:12:25.832 --> 06:12:27.212]  They paid a Boston man.
[06:12:27.352 --> 06:12:29.853]  They were people that ran into people that were from Austin, Texas.
[06:12:29.873 --> 06:12:31.153]  That's the only paycheck they can get.
[06:12:32.713 --> 06:12:35.294]  There were commies from Austin, Texas that were out here.
[06:12:35.314 --> 06:12:35.715]  Of course.
[06:12:35.855 --> 06:12:37.696]  I know I've seen familiar faces.
[06:12:38.156 --> 06:12:40.538]  Actually, more specifically... It's a network, man.
[06:12:40.658 --> 06:12:41.298]  It really is.
[06:12:41.419 --> 06:12:41.979]  It's a network.
[06:12:41.999 --> 06:12:45.922]  It is a freaking network of jobless, pathetic people.
[06:12:45.942 --> 06:12:47.243]  They need dads, folks!
[06:12:47.303 --> 06:12:50.545]  Even if they're different people, they're still the exact same person.
[06:12:50.925 --> 06:12:54.627]  They're still the exact same replica, hearsay mafia, of the next one.
[06:12:54.707 --> 06:12:55.627]  It's the freaking Matrix.
[06:12:55.667 --> 06:12:57.048]  That's why they all look the same.
[06:12:57.408 --> 06:13:01.390]  And they're little black outfits, and they're balaclavas, and they're skinny jeans.
[06:13:01.510 --> 06:13:04.851]  And then underneath them, they're like, I love the skinny jeans, Leanne.
[06:13:05.892 --> 06:13:08.673]  As they're running, don't they look so, so frightening?
[06:13:08.773 --> 06:13:10.114]  I mean, that's what is frightening to me.
[06:13:10.134 --> 06:13:12.595]  It's not like they're big and muscly and scary or anything.
[06:13:12.635 --> 06:13:16.057]  It's that they're like, they look like little insects.
[06:13:16.097 --> 06:13:19.038]  They're not frightening head on, but the thing is, they don't fight head on.
[06:13:19.158 --> 06:13:20.400]  You know, they're not going to take you on head on.
[06:13:20.420 --> 06:13:22.362]  They will take you out with stealth.
[06:13:22.763 --> 06:13:23.884]  They'll sneak out from a group.
[06:13:23.924 --> 06:13:25.066]  This is what Ona and I were talking about.
[06:13:25.106 --> 06:13:26.407]  We've seen the same thing at protests.
[06:13:26.908 --> 06:13:32.395]  You know, I'm from the West Coast and, you know, you see it all across the country where they'll be in a group and they're all wearing black.
[06:13:32.415 --> 06:13:33.757]  They're all wearing the same thing.
[06:13:34.057 --> 06:13:37.101]  And then they'll run out and then they'll go hit somebody and then they'll run right back in the group.
[06:13:37.261 --> 06:13:37.401]  Right.
[06:13:37.421 --> 06:13:38.962]  And they'll mix up so you can't find everything.
[06:13:39.002 --> 06:13:39.802]  Oh, and we've seen it a bunch of times.
[06:13:39.902 --> 06:13:42.823]  That's exactly what happened to me last night, was we were walking away.
[06:13:42.863 --> 06:13:43.964]  We were leaving the protest.
[06:13:43.984 --> 06:13:47.525]  We were trying to get to an Uber to, like, get home and get out of there.
[06:13:47.545 --> 06:13:48.846]  Get you in the back of the head, huh?
[06:13:48.926 --> 06:13:51.667]  And this one guy came up with the flagpole and just cracked me over the back of the head with it.
[06:13:52.187 --> 06:13:53.448]  And then he ran.
[06:13:54.321 --> 06:13:56.262]  And then he scurried back into his little plan.
[06:13:56.442 --> 06:13:59.184]  And then he ran away, and then he ran back into the crowd.
[06:13:59.204 --> 06:14:00.945]  Real American heroes, these guys.
[06:14:01.345 --> 06:14:02.806]  Yeah, no, it's total cowardice.
[06:14:02.826 --> 06:14:03.747]  And then they go online.
[06:14:03.827 --> 06:14:07.889]  And I've been watching Twitter and everything, and I'll get all these people who tweet.
[06:14:07.909 --> 06:14:09.470]  It's like, oh, you know, you deserved it, Nazi.
[06:14:09.490 --> 06:14:10.891]  But they're all anonymous accounts.
[06:14:11.071 --> 06:14:12.352]  They're all fake accounts.
[06:14:12.372 --> 06:14:13.713]  They don't want to go on the record.
[06:14:13.733 --> 06:14:14.974]  They don't want us to show their face.
[06:14:15.014 --> 06:14:17.595]  How is throwing children at women going to help your cause?
[06:14:17.915 --> 06:14:20.397]  You know, how is keying somebody's car going to help your cause?
[06:14:20.597 --> 06:14:23.479]  I'm going to key this car, and then they won't vote for Trump.
[06:14:24.139 --> 06:14:26.200]  Fighting fascism with violence.
[06:14:26.800 --> 06:14:27.501]  Oh my gosh.
[06:14:27.841 --> 06:14:31.823]  Yeah, I'm going to go beat this guy's ass and then I'm going to get him to not vote for Trump.
[06:14:31.923 --> 06:14:34.744]  I'm going to beat some sense into him about this censorship.
[06:14:34.784 --> 06:14:36.645]  We're going to do something about that free speech.
[06:14:36.845 --> 06:14:38.446]  Yeah, how do you like that, you Trump voter?
[06:14:39.126 --> 06:14:40.527]  I'm getting arrested now.
[06:14:40.847 --> 06:14:42.248]  Oh you, how's that for freedom?
[06:14:42.288 --> 06:14:42.808]  This is free.
[06:14:45.549 --> 06:14:50.392]  So I know that we have had a super long day here, so I kind of just want to wrap up this roundtable.
[06:14:50.412 --> 06:15:00.938]  I want to give everyone the opportunity here that's on the panel to just kind of encapsulate your feelings for the day, for the time, or even what you think is going to happen within the next 100 days.
[06:15:00.998 --> 06:15:02.039]  Margaret or Owen?
[06:15:02.219 --> 06:15:22.320]  Well I'll start because I have literally got this and I just want to say love really does trump hate and we prove that we have so literally I work with these people every day and I love Trump's hate literally because Trump won and love won all at the same time and you know what these haters they're gonna just continue to keep going but honestly if if
[06:15:22.520 --> 06:15:29.683]  If anybody is listening to me and still awake and still, you know, honestly still, you know, watching this, we have literally made history here, folks.
[06:15:29.723 --> 06:15:32.304]  I am so proud of every crew member that we worked with.
[06:15:32.724 --> 06:15:35.205]  Alex, our boss, we love him and he exudes love.
[06:15:35.225 --> 06:15:36.946]  It really does trump hate.
[06:15:37.326 --> 06:15:37.766]  It does.
[06:15:38.266 --> 06:15:39.146]  I'm taking that back.
[06:15:39.206 --> 06:15:40.347]  I'm claiming it back for us.
[06:15:40.367 --> 06:15:41.327]  They don't own that.
[06:15:41.367 --> 06:15:42.148]  They don't own that.
[06:15:42.188 --> 06:15:43.108]  They don't own that.
[06:15:43.388 --> 06:15:45.129]  We stole, now they're the fake news.
[06:15:45.149 --> 06:15:46.489]  So let's steal that one from them too.
[06:15:46.509 --> 06:15:46.649]  Exactly.
[06:15:46.689 --> 06:15:47.149]  That's right.
[06:15:47.210 --> 06:15:47.530]  That's true.
[06:15:48.850 --> 06:15:51.831]  Margaret, you need to go take that hashtag right now.
[06:15:51.851 --> 06:15:53.712]  And we approved it today.
[06:15:53.732 --> 06:15:54.552]  Don't do it.
[06:15:55.393 --> 06:15:58.434]  Okay, Owen, James McBreen, who wants to?
[06:15:58.834 --> 06:16:07.577]  Yeah, I think it's, you know, despite everything that we saw, despite everything that's happened, and despite everything that I'm sure is going on right outside, you know, every five minutes we'll hear another round of cop cars coming by.
[06:16:08.077 --> 06:16:08.958]  I think it's still a great day.
[06:16:08.978 --> 06:16:13.399]  I think it's the greatest day that I've experienced, at least as an American, in a long time.
[06:16:13.679 --> 06:16:15.040]  We have a lot of promise going forward.
[06:16:15.660 --> 06:16:18.100]  But we need to hold Trump accountable, I think.
[06:16:18.340 --> 06:16:33.543]  I think that's going to be very important going forward, making sure that a lot of these establishment-type Republicans and people who are not sympathetic towards patriotism, towards putting America first, that we really drain that swamp and that we really hold Trump to what he campaigned on.
[06:16:33.583 --> 06:16:37.204]  Things like immigration reform, things like tax reform, things like fixing education.
[06:16:37.624 --> 06:16:38.324]  That's what matters.
[06:16:38.444 --> 06:16:40.024]  Not just getting him elected, not getting him in office.
[06:16:40.044 --> 06:16:44.725]  We need to accomplish those goals to make things better for us as Americans and all of our fellow Americans as well.
[06:16:45.485 --> 06:16:50.269]  January 20th, 2017 is a date that will live forever.
[06:16:50.809 --> 06:16:55.052]  It's a date that our lineage is going to be reading about in their history textbooks.
[06:16:55.853 --> 06:17:04.279]  And even from myself, somebody that was on the streets all day today and had a first-hand experience of a lot of it, it's like I can't even really fully grasp it.
[06:17:04.319 --> 06:17:08.402]  I can't even really fully appreciate the history, I believe, that was made today.
[06:17:08.823 --> 06:17:12.506]  And I think tomorrow is an interesting opportunity because
[06:17:13.146 --> 06:17:15.188]  Tomorrow's Donald Trump's first day as president.
[06:17:15.268 --> 06:17:18.310]  There is the Women's March that's planned on Washington.
[06:17:18.631 --> 06:17:20.492]  They're claiming they're going to have 200,000 people.
[06:17:20.532 --> 06:17:21.773]  That's beyond a pipe dream.
[06:17:22.414 --> 06:17:25.937]  I think they'll maybe have 50,000 people.
[06:17:26.457 --> 06:17:31.781]  And this to me is representation of what we're kind of going to be faced with here in the future.
[06:17:32.762 --> 06:17:34.163]  They're not going to stop crying.
[06:17:34.944 --> 06:17:36.245]  They're not going to stop whining.
[06:17:36.265 --> 06:17:40.169]  I even asked these protesters in one of the videos that I put up on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[06:17:40.189 --> 06:17:42.130]  I said, are you guys just going to protest for eight years?
[06:17:42.291 --> 06:17:43.191]  And they were like, yeah.
[06:17:43.772 --> 06:17:44.312]  So that's the plan.
[06:17:44.332 --> 06:17:45.193]  Like Shia LaBeouf.
[06:17:45.393 --> 06:17:50.358]  Even if they're just so used to not having a job, they think that's possible.
[06:17:51.118 --> 06:17:51.918]  So that's fine then.
[06:17:51.958 --> 06:17:53.739]  So this is what we have to be faced with.
[06:17:53.879 --> 06:17:55.440]  We've tried to bring you on the team.
[06:17:55.740 --> 06:17:58.100]  We've tried to help your consciousness.
[06:17:59.361 --> 06:18:05.763]  Even in guerrilla, aggressive journalism style, in your face, we tried to confront you with reality and face your own double standards.
[06:18:06.203 --> 06:18:07.283]  And it all failed.
[06:18:07.323 --> 06:18:11.965]  So what we're looking at now, at least for me, because in the past it's always like,
[06:18:12.705 --> 06:18:14.126]  What am I supposed to do with these people?
[06:18:14.627 --> 06:18:15.507]  They're in my way.
[06:18:15.547 --> 06:18:16.888]  It's like Alex Jones always talks about.
[06:18:17.008 --> 06:18:17.909]  Move, bitch!
[06:18:17.989 --> 06:18:18.910]  Get out the way!
[06:18:19.330 --> 06:18:19.891]  Well, you know what?
[06:18:20.091 --> 06:18:21.772]  We've got Donald Trump in office now.
[06:18:21.832 --> 06:18:26.056]  We've got a movement that's now hitting the political threads of this country.
[06:18:26.436 --> 06:18:28.037]  So we can actually take this country back.
[06:18:28.097 --> 06:18:31.220]  And if they want to sit around and whine, if they want to sit around and mope...
[06:18:31.880 --> 06:18:32.460]  Then you know what?
[06:18:32.700 --> 06:18:34.341]  Let's make America great again without him.
[06:18:34.501 --> 06:18:36.121]  Let's improve our lives without him.
[06:18:36.161 --> 06:18:37.041]  Let's get rich.
[06:18:37.101 --> 06:18:38.142]  Let's create jobs.
[06:18:38.182 --> 06:18:39.162]  Let's create families.
[06:18:39.182 --> 06:18:40.042]  Let's create a future.
[06:18:40.062 --> 06:18:40.762]  Let's create lineage.
[06:18:40.802 --> 06:18:43.563]  Let's restore the borders, the language, the culture.
[06:18:43.583 --> 06:18:45.284]  Let's get rid of political correctness.
[06:18:45.524 --> 06:18:48.244]  We'll just do all of this and they can hang out in the streets.
[06:18:48.484 --> 06:18:50.145]  They can hang out with each other in the gutters.
[06:18:50.485 --> 06:18:50.725]  Okay?
[06:18:50.745 --> 06:18:52.165]  They can go do whatever they want to do.
[06:18:52.445 --> 06:18:54.746]  If they want to smash up windows, hopefully they'll get arrested.
[06:18:55.046 --> 06:18:57.507]  And we're going to take our culture and we're going to take our future back.
[06:18:57.547 --> 06:19:01.610]  So if they don't want to be a part of that, it's like Donald Trump said, hey, I'm sorry if people don't like me.
[06:19:01.630 --> 06:19:04.171]  You're welcome to join the winning team, but they're just losers.
[06:19:04.431 --> 06:19:06.472]  And for whatever reason, they're content with being losers.
[06:19:06.792 --> 06:19:08.093]  We're never going to get sick of winning.
[06:19:08.453 --> 06:19:09.874]  They're never going to get sick of losing.
[06:19:10.134 --> 06:19:11.415]  And this is the future we look at.
[06:19:12.253 --> 06:19:14.795]  And we're almost out of time, so I'll make it quick and simple.
[06:19:14.915 --> 06:19:18.258]  In the words of Kid Rock, get over it, Cupcake.
[06:19:18.818 --> 06:19:20.319]  Trump is our president.
[06:19:20.359 --> 06:19:20.680]  Yes.
[06:19:20.960 --> 06:19:21.841]  Buckle up, Buttercup.
[06:19:21.881 --> 06:19:23.162]  I know we talked about that.
[06:19:23.182 --> 06:19:24.082]  It should be a shirt.
[06:19:24.543 --> 06:19:25.443]  Trump is my president.
[06:19:25.523 --> 06:19:26.384]  And yours, too!
[06:19:26.444 --> 06:19:27.105]  Get used to it.
[06:19:27.925 --> 06:19:35.491]  Yes, I guess for me, absolutely, the encapsulation of this is that we as humanity have broken through the conditioning they have been pumping through.
[06:19:35.511 --> 06:19:41.516]  I mean, since television and newspapers have existed, they've been conditioning people to the type of reality they wanted.
[06:19:41.936 --> 06:19:44.638]  And humanity was able to break through that conditioning.
[06:19:45.459 --> 06:19:47.440]  So, you know, what an incredible time.
[06:19:47.520 --> 06:19:52.404]  But with Donald Trump, we all can see, we see his energy up there.
[06:19:52.444 --> 06:19:55.827]  He means well, but he is there in D.C.
[06:19:56.047 --> 06:19:56.787]  with the goblins.
[06:19:56.827 --> 06:19:57.568]  He's with the goblins.
[06:19:57.568 --> 06:19:58.849]  And he can't do it without us.
[06:19:59.090 --> 06:20:00.231]  He can't do it without you.
[06:20:00.611 --> 06:20:01.752]  He needs all of our help.
[06:20:01.932 --> 06:20:03.073]  We're in this thing together.
[06:20:03.154 --> 06:20:04.375]  We've got to hold him accountable.
[06:20:04.815 --> 06:20:11.362]  And so with that, I want to go ahead and go to this Alex Jones, his last Facebook mentions of the evening.
[06:20:12.102 --> 06:20:14.925]  And we want to make sure that you guys go to Alex Jones' Facebook page.
[06:20:15.225 --> 06:20:17.788]  Share this Facebook mentions with all of your people.
[06:20:17.828 --> 06:20:21.492]  Let's get this trending across Facebook and all the other social media outlets out there.
[06:20:22.232 --> 06:20:30.454]  But Alex Jones, I think if anyone was watching him live-streaming today, he was kind of crying a lot today, coming to tears, but you think about it.
[06:20:30.494 --> 06:20:32.055]  That guy's full of passion, man.
[06:20:32.095 --> 06:20:32.575]  He's 100% real.
[06:20:32.835 --> 06:20:36.756]  He's been working 20-something years at this, at trying to take down the globalists.
[06:20:36.776 --> 06:20:40.717]  I'm telling you something, he sleeps about, what, three or four hours a night, maybe, since the election.
[06:20:41.997 --> 06:20:45.159]  And then the fact that we, as the team, we're all a part of this history.
[06:20:45.419 --> 06:20:46.200]  My God.
[06:20:46.260 --> 06:20:48.381]  So, yes, here's a little bit of that.
[06:20:48.441 --> 06:20:49.122]  And this is Alex.
[06:20:49.522 --> 06:20:50.743]  His report is called Live.
[06:20:50.903 --> 06:20:53.024]  Trump destroys the New World Order.
[06:20:53.484 --> 06:20:56.946]  Yeah.
[06:20:56.986 --> 06:20:58.827]  January 20th, 2017.
[06:20:59.388 --> 06:21:01.589]  A day long remembered in our republic.
[06:21:03.450 --> 06:21:05.592]  Donald J. Trump is now the 45th president.
[06:21:06.432 --> 06:21:09.094]  We told you two years ago this was going to happen.
[06:21:09.454 --> 06:21:10.655]  Because we have the vision.
[06:21:11.909 --> 06:21:18.013]  We understand that globalists are trying to suppress the republic and we understand that victory is ours.
[06:21:19.154 --> 06:21:31.441]  This is a great day and as Trump said during his speech, we must reach out to everybody of every color who has red blood to try to promote liberty and prosperity to defeat the globalists that are promoting division.
[06:21:32.922 --> 06:21:34.083]  But I've been extremely honored
[06:21:35.776 --> 06:21:37.417]  To be associated with all of you in this fight.
[06:21:37.717 --> 06:21:40.739]  I have already done more in my life than I thought I'd do.
[06:21:41.479 --> 06:21:42.360]  But I had a vision.
[06:21:42.500 --> 06:21:48.743]  I knew 25 years ago when I got politically involved, and 21 years ago when I got involved on air, that it was going to pay off.
[06:21:49.564 --> 06:21:51.925]  Because I have free will, and I want you to be successful.
[06:21:52.445 --> 06:21:53.466]  I want to be successful.
[06:21:54.266 --> 06:21:56.367]  And it's just an amazing time to be alive with all of you.
[06:21:57.128 --> 06:21:58.028]  This is a great time.
[06:21:58.208 --> 06:22:04.272]  I mean, Trump just wants to cut taxes, not have globalists sell out America's interest to foreign interests.
[06:22:05.236 --> 06:22:06.558]  This has just been a beautiful time.
[06:22:08.380 --> 06:22:09.821]  Alright Q, you're over there talking to other people.
[06:22:09.841 --> 06:22:10.602]  Get over here live on air.
[06:22:11.303 --> 06:22:12.204]  No, no, you're not allowed to.
[06:22:12.704 --> 06:22:14.066]  You want to babble to everybody else.
[06:22:14.587 --> 06:22:16.148]  You got to tell folks about America.
[06:22:16.168 --> 06:22:16.449]  Go ahead.
[06:22:18.840 --> 06:22:38.105]  I just want to say, first of all, thanks to Alex Jones for being the vocal piece for America, for freedom, for standing up for what he thinks is right, for what we all think is right, for helping catalyst the silent majority to go out and finally speak their peace.
[06:22:41.792 --> 06:22:42.513]  Speechless, man.
[06:22:42.693 --> 06:22:44.795]  You know, it's the presidential inauguration.
[06:22:44.835 --> 06:22:45.855]  It's 2017.
[06:22:46.696 --> 06:22:48.858]  We've sat here and taken it for eight years.
[06:22:48.958 --> 06:22:49.959]  We took it silently.
[06:22:50.019 --> 06:22:50.679]  We didn't cry.
[06:22:50.720 --> 06:22:51.320]  We didn't bitch.
[06:22:51.360 --> 06:22:53.122]  We didn't whine like everybody else did today.
[06:22:53.142 --> 06:23:00.127]  The democratic election process works the way it does.
[06:23:01.004 --> 06:23:05.529]  The country spoke, they elected a leader, and that leader is now Donald J. Trump.
[06:23:06.049 --> 06:23:13.397]  So, if you're ignorant enough to wish that the pilot of your plane fails, understand you're on that same plane.
[06:23:13.657 --> 06:23:15.279]  So, if he fails, we all fail.
[06:23:16.440 --> 06:23:20.104]  Stop wishing bad on anybody, go out, get a job, do right by everybody.
[06:23:21.459 --> 06:23:21.979]  Well said.
[06:23:21.999 --> 06:23:26.102]  I agree with you, Q. I have hard words describing how epic this is.
[06:23:27.343 --> 06:23:29.965]  My gut told me Trump was good two years ago, but I just went with it.
[06:23:30.706 --> 06:23:35.349]  By the time I was like 41, I'm 43 now, I was just like, you know, my gut's never wrong.
[06:23:35.389 --> 06:23:37.131]  It says Trump's it.
[06:23:37.231 --> 06:23:39.212]  My gut's like, my spirit's like, go with Trump.
[06:23:39.893 --> 06:23:43.635]  I'm like, this is some damn casino owner, big liberal and everything else.
[06:23:43.715 --> 06:23:46.577]  And then I found out his whole background once I endorsed him.
[06:23:47.398 --> 06:23:49.480]  That he was like a patriot for the beginning 40 years.
[06:23:49.660 --> 06:23:51.901]  It's like, man, this is amazing.
[06:23:51.921 --> 06:23:54.103]  This is really an amazing time to be alive.
[06:23:55.664 --> 06:23:56.845]  I feel like I started to be in bed.
[06:23:56.865 --> 06:23:59.146]  You know, they're shutting down these roads.
[06:23:59.166 --> 06:24:00.247]  They're taking up the barricades.
[06:24:02.128 --> 06:24:02.969]  That's the people's house.
[06:24:03.329 --> 06:24:04.510]  Hey guys, let's do this.
[06:24:04.530 --> 06:24:05.631]  Let's march down to the Capitol.
[06:24:06.251 --> 06:24:07.032]  It's the people's house.
[06:24:07.052 --> 06:24:07.452]  Let's do it.
[06:24:08.073 --> 06:24:14.097]  Let's get some exercise after gobbling steaks at the Capitol Grill, which God gave us.
[06:24:16.258 --> 06:24:17.619]  And look, we're thankful for all of it.
[06:24:18.340 --> 06:24:21.001]  Listen, we're humbled by how great America is.
[06:24:21.802 --> 06:24:24.383]  I mean, look, we're not on power trips, but this is a damn great country.
[06:24:25.164 --> 06:24:25.784]  And you know what?
[06:24:26.865 --> 06:24:28.886]  The global strategy used in America wasn't great.
[06:24:29.426 --> 06:24:30.287]  America is great.
[06:24:32.352 --> 06:24:34.994]  People who want to be peaceful to us, want to be our friends, we're your friends.
[06:24:35.795 --> 06:24:39.678]  If you want to take us over like the Islamicists, you're going to get your ass kicked, okay?
[06:24:40.038 --> 06:24:41.199]  You want to fight, you got one.
[06:24:41.960 --> 06:24:48.505]  Hey guys, I know some of you can't be on tape, but if you're off camera, some of you haven't talked, what was it like to watch those people attack our women today?
[06:24:48.545 --> 06:24:49.186]  Go ahead, you're on camera.
[06:24:50.253 --> 06:24:54.756]  It was outrageous to be able to see that and the police officers not doing anything about it.
[06:24:55.617 --> 06:25:00.661]  It was complete nonsense for them to sit by and it's illegal for them not to do their job.
[06:25:01.201 --> 06:25:04.784]  And they said that was orders by the Capitol Police, well that's over today isn't it?
[06:25:05.404 --> 06:25:08.447]  I actually would not have believed it unless I saw it right with my own eyes.
[06:25:10.006 --> 06:25:10.406]  Same thing.
[06:25:10.707 --> 06:25:12.128]  People coming up with covered masks.
[06:25:12.648 --> 06:25:14.830]  They did not want to let people through, locking arms.
[06:25:14.890 --> 06:25:22.336]  They were harassing women, hitting them, doing whatever they could to try to just, you know, keep them from coming up to watch this stuff.
[06:25:23.177 --> 06:25:30.322]  And if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, the police officers just watching because they had been told not to intervene, then I would not have believed it, but I saw it.
[06:25:30.382 --> 06:25:31.383]  I get following orders.
[06:25:31.563 --> 06:25:32.224]  I get following orders.
[06:25:32.284 --> 06:25:37.088]  It's great when you're in a war, but in your own country's being overrun, following orders of traitors is treason.
[06:25:37.108 --> 06:25:37.568]  I'm sorry.
[06:25:38.229 --> 06:25:38.409]  You know?
[06:25:39.471 --> 06:25:42.813]  No, I completely agree, and like you said today, we sat there and watched it.
[06:25:43.273 --> 06:25:43.694]  They locked arms.
[06:25:43.714 --> 06:25:44.474]  We went over and did something too.
[06:25:44.494 --> 06:25:45.855]  You guys did something.
[06:25:45.875 --> 06:25:51.298]  Yeah, we went over and tried to just walk through the street that we were allowed to walk through, and then they didn't let us.
[06:25:51.819 --> 06:25:53.460]  They wanted to protest and keep us.
[06:25:53.480 --> 06:25:55.041]  So you threw like eight of them out of the way?
[06:25:55.061 --> 06:25:56.722]  I pushed a few out of the way.
[06:25:56.782 --> 06:26:04.907]  I mean, maybe eight or nine, but no, I did what I had to do to be able to get into the inauguration to see what I wanted to see, which was history being made.
[06:26:06.178 --> 06:26:10.261]  And the worst thing about it is that the cowards that they are, they have their women on the front lines.
[06:26:10.761 --> 06:26:11.802]  To blocking.
[06:26:12.382 --> 06:26:13.563]  Blocking and punching.
[06:26:13.783 --> 06:26:16.685]  Blocking and punching the men so you couldn't get in.
[06:26:17.145 --> 06:26:20.948]  And then they could cry that, oh you're abusing women.
[06:26:20.968 --> 06:26:24.990]  These women would hit me and then I... Completely outrageous that they would do that.
[06:26:25.050 --> 06:26:26.051]  Such a coward's move.
[06:26:28.390 --> 06:26:32.392]  Well, folks, this is America being reborn, and America isn't perfect, but it's the best there is.
[06:26:32.452 --> 06:26:36.254]  And I tell you, I am so humbled and honored, I can hardly even talk right now.
[06:26:36.294 --> 06:26:38.775]  But look, everybody wanted us to march on Washington.
[06:26:38.795 --> 06:26:40.276]  I always heard, oh, march with guns.
[06:26:40.296 --> 06:26:41.657]  I said, we're going to march with information.
[06:26:41.997 --> 06:26:42.577]  And it's happening.
[06:26:42.597 --> 06:26:48.540]  Look, we're marching right now symbiotically and in a symbolic way, not just symbiotic, but symbolic.
[06:26:48.881 --> 06:26:51.062]  We are marching back on our republic right now.
[06:26:51.762 --> 06:26:53.063]  We're only like 500 yards away.
[06:26:54.051 --> 06:27:05.924]  From our capital, which we retook today, just like patriots led by great people in the last few decades marched at night when no one cared, no one was listening, the spotlight wasn't there.
[06:27:07.386 --> 06:27:11.190]  But we were there, standing for the Republic, standing for freedom.
[06:27:12.915 --> 06:27:21.137]  Promoting the Bill of Rights and Constitution, promoting Americana, being demonized, being attacked, being told that America was some dead ghost that never existed.
[06:27:21.357 --> 06:27:22.058]  We were crazy.
[06:27:22.238 --> 06:27:22.758]  Well, you know what?
[06:27:22.918 --> 06:27:24.138]  We're not crazy now, are we?
[06:27:24.978 --> 06:27:27.399]  And you think we're strong now to the enemy?
[06:27:27.899 --> 06:27:29.700]  This isn't one-tenth of what we can do.
[06:27:31.220 --> 06:27:36.782]  Quite frankly, I want the Globals to back off now, but if they push even harder, their destruction is imminent.
[06:27:37.262 --> 06:27:40.503]  Guys, I know you can't be on tape here, but anybody else wants to comment?
[06:27:41.163 --> 06:27:42.403]  Come on over, you haven't commented.
[06:27:43.503 --> 06:27:46.464]  You're not on tape, you're on audio.
[06:27:46.484 --> 06:27:46.884]  Take the mic.
[06:27:47.425 --> 06:27:52.106]  Marching up to the Capitol, symbolically retaking America, what do you have to say about today?
[06:27:52.126 --> 06:27:54.386]  Today was an awesome experience.
[06:27:54.907 --> 06:27:56.247]  As somebody else mentioned earlier,
[06:27:57.603 --> 06:28:24.697]  uh... seeing some of the people uh... get attacked i guess if you want to call it uh... assaulted while police officers are fifteen twenty feet away actually turn look see it and do nothing about it was uh... was pretty shocking and disappointing and uh... hope that changes with trump what's your gut on all this stuff give us your honest opinion this isn't scripted no teleprompters what do you make of this what's your gut tell you my gut tells me that uh...
[06:28:25.834 --> 06:28:26.554]  Trump's the real deal.
[06:28:26.714 --> 06:28:28.715]  He is who he says he is.
[06:28:29.395 --> 06:28:30.775]  And to a lot of people, that's a threat.
[06:28:31.496 --> 06:28:33.156]  Because they are two-faced.
[06:28:33.516 --> 06:28:35.637]  You know, they're in it for power.
[06:28:35.677 --> 06:28:37.938]  They'll say and do whatever it takes to get to that point.
[06:28:38.238 --> 06:28:39.758]  And you never know what the true person is.
[06:28:40.778 --> 06:28:42.399]  And I don't think Trump's that kind of person.
[06:28:42.759 --> 06:28:45.680]  And I'm glad to see that he's leading the country.
[06:28:46.680 --> 06:28:48.321]  And I'm excited to see what he does with it.
[06:28:49.434 --> 06:28:49.914]  Well said.
[06:28:49.954 --> 06:28:51.575]  And again, not that we're looking for power.
[06:28:51.615 --> 06:28:52.956]  The real power is in being real.
[06:28:53.616 --> 06:28:55.437]  The real power is not being a fake piece of crap.
[06:28:56.057 --> 06:28:57.058]  And that's what America is.
[06:28:57.818 --> 06:28:59.519]  And we're about to see that happen right now.
[06:28:59.919 --> 06:29:01.660]  And these enemies, they can feel it.
[06:29:01.700 --> 06:29:02.600]  That's why they're panicking.
[06:29:03.040 --> 06:29:04.481]  Buckley, you've made a lot of great points tonight.
[06:29:04.801 --> 06:29:09.444]  And I want to give Josh Owens a take as well, as we retake America, symbolically, right now, together.
[06:29:09.884 --> 06:29:11.064]  Out in this beautiful, crisp air.
[06:29:11.324 --> 06:29:11.725]  Well, I will.
[06:29:12.645 --> 06:29:14.106]  I will say one thing that's interesting.
[06:29:14.146 --> 06:29:20.011]  It's really surreal to be walking down Pennsylvania Avenue right towards the Capitol with not a soul around.
[06:29:20.031 --> 06:29:21.452]  I mean, it's eerie.
[06:29:21.512 --> 06:29:25.195]  It's almost post-apocalyptic except for the fact that we won.
[06:29:25.795 --> 06:29:33.881]  And it just feels really interesting to be walking up here knowing that now, basically, we have control.
[06:29:33.941 --> 06:29:41.647]  There's been this huge, huge, tense buildup to this for at least over a decade now as far as I can see.
[06:29:42.888 --> 06:29:50.909]  Is that there's this huge deremption of, you know, just being relieved.
[06:29:51.069 --> 06:29:57.451]  I think is a big feeling of it is that I finally feel relieved that we're not heading toward the rocks.
[06:29:57.911 --> 06:30:05.052]  That the ship has been turned around and that we're heading for some fair sailing right now because it looked really ugly for a while.
[06:30:05.432 --> 06:30:08.192]  And so I think there's just a big sense of relief here in the city.
[06:30:08.632 --> 06:30:11.413]  Everybody that we talked to, the vast majority of people,
[06:30:12.353 --> 06:30:19.576]  We talked to, you know, we're here and supported Trump and really believe that this is the turning point for the nation.
[06:30:19.856 --> 06:30:23.198]  That we're really looking at a new rebirth.
[06:30:23.258 --> 06:30:24.979]  I've heard, you know, the Phoenix.
[06:30:24.999 --> 06:30:25.639]  I've heard that.
[06:30:25.659 --> 06:30:29.721]  I've heard lots of different analogies around the ideas and the concepts of rebirth.
[06:30:30.501 --> 06:30:31.582]  But that's really what it is.
[06:30:31.642 --> 06:30:38.144]  I mean, there's basically the new spirit of 1776 has been reborn in... And it's like doomsday.
[06:30:38.184 --> 06:30:39.025]  It just got stronger.
[06:30:39.645 --> 06:30:41.267]  You attacked it, just got ten times stronger.
[06:30:41.627 --> 06:30:43.949]  Exactly, so... Ain't no kryptonite taking this down.
[06:30:44.610 --> 06:30:51.136]  Exactly, so at this point, you know, here we are, we're, you know, walking up on the Capitol, and it's completely, it's completely empty.
[06:30:51.176 --> 06:30:57.603]  It almost feels like New Year's Day, or like... The last man alive on Earth, or, uh, I am legend right now.
[06:30:57.623 --> 06:30:59.584]  Uh, where's Vincent Price?
[06:30:59.604 --> 06:31:00.145]  Go ahead, Buckley.
[06:31:01.426 --> 06:31:02.706]  I mean, look at that Capitol right there.
[06:31:02.726 --> 06:31:04.727]  We're walking here in a zombie land.
[06:31:04.967 --> 06:31:05.827]  That's pretty much it.
[06:31:06.067 --> 06:31:06.987]  You just retook this.
[06:31:07.687 --> 06:31:08.087]  Exactly.
[06:31:08.127 --> 06:31:13.608]  And right now there's lots of parties and balls going on, lots of revelry, lots of people out celebrating this.
[06:31:13.628 --> 06:31:15.829]  But we're here where America retook it all.
[06:31:16.329 --> 06:31:17.509]  This was the globalist empire.
[06:31:17.569 --> 06:31:18.169]  We retook it.
[06:31:18.389 --> 06:31:18.849]  They know it.
[06:31:18.909 --> 06:31:19.870]  They are shitting their pants.
[06:31:20.350 --> 06:31:20.810]  Exactly.
[06:31:20.890 --> 06:31:24.550]  So here we are just, you know, taking our birthright, you know, coming up.
[06:31:24.570 --> 06:31:26.211]  Did you just run in that bathroom?
[06:31:26.491 --> 06:31:27.231]  He probably did.
[06:31:28.011 --> 06:31:33.495]  So, here we are, basically, this is our country, this is the country that our ancestors built.
[06:31:33.916 --> 06:31:36.578]  They built it on the principles that we all hold dear to our hearts.
[06:31:36.958 --> 06:31:42.402]  I hate the liberals saying we're attacking freedom when America is not perfect, but it's the biggest liberal country there is.
[06:31:43.122 --> 06:31:47.065]  The fake liberals say America's the problem because they're the anti-liberals, folks.
[06:31:47.746 --> 06:31:51.749]  Liberal means own guns, have property, live your life the way you want, don't give people's business.
[06:31:52.209 --> 06:31:53.230]  That's all coming to an end, man.
[06:31:53.850 --> 06:31:54.551]  Under the New World Order.
[06:31:54.611 --> 06:31:55.712]  We're trying to bring that back.
[06:31:56.372 --> 06:31:58.634]  And the liberals are a bunch of pseudo-intellectual cult members.
[06:31:58.734 --> 06:31:59.654]  It's came over.
[06:31:59.875 --> 06:32:00.275]  We're done.
[06:32:01.115 --> 06:32:01.516]  Exactly.
[06:32:01.556 --> 06:32:10.462]  And you can't have a society this day and age that's going to prosper if it's racist, if it's, you know, if it's misogynistic.
[06:32:10.822 --> 06:32:11.343]  Exactly.
[06:32:11.423 --> 06:32:18.268]  So all those things that they try to pin on us, which are really painful, you know, throughout the last year and even and even beyond that.
[06:32:18.728 --> 06:32:20.269]  And we just I feel really vindicated.
[06:32:20.329 --> 06:32:21.450]  I feel really vindicated that
[06:32:22.831 --> 06:32:23.692]  America saw through it.
[06:32:23.792 --> 06:32:25.313]  Exactly, that America saw through.
[06:32:25.393 --> 06:32:30.256]  Everybody kind of got together and said, you know what, the asylum majority spoke and said, you know what, we're not going to take this anymore.
[06:32:30.556 --> 06:32:40.183]  We're going to follow the trajectory and the dreams of our forefathers on whose shoulders we stand and make sure that we honor their efforts and make sure that we take us into the 21st century.
[06:32:40.523 --> 06:32:41.263]  That's a great quote.
[06:32:41.564 --> 06:32:44.606]  The genetic memory of America destroyed the enemy.
[06:32:45.186 --> 06:32:45.667]  Absolutely.
[06:32:45.707 --> 06:32:47.769]  I mean, we didn't do this on our own, you know.
[06:32:48.229 --> 06:32:53.615]  They have their own playbook of destruction that they've been working on, that they've been playing off of, but we have our own playbook.
[06:32:53.635 --> 06:32:54.616]  We've got George Washington.
[06:32:54.956 --> 06:32:55.337]  Exactly.
[06:32:55.377 --> 06:33:00.662]  We have George Washington in 1776, and the basic ideals which made America great in the first place.
[06:33:01.103 --> 06:33:07.930]  And, you know, that's hard work, that's compassion, that's taking care of your fellow human being, that's freedom, and that is, you know, removing...
[06:33:08.791 --> 06:33:14.059]  Exactly, and that's removing restrictions that the leftists want to put on us.
[06:33:14.099 --> 06:33:15.181]  Removing restrictions.
[06:33:15.621 --> 06:33:20.348]  Removing restrictions on individuals, not adding them, claiming you're empowering people.
[06:33:20.989 --> 06:33:21.711]  Oh, what a mind game.
[06:33:22.887 --> 06:33:23.548]  Right, exactly.
[06:33:25.149 --> 06:33:36.517]  You look at what they're trying to do with Agenda 21 and all these meetings in Davos where they're trying to set up all these international laws that they're not held accountable for.
[06:33:36.997 --> 06:33:38.338]  Well, that's not going to fly.
[06:33:38.358 --> 06:33:42.281]  This is a big signal to them that that's not going to fly.
[06:33:42.741 --> 06:33:45.243]  I'm going to say something right now.
[06:33:47.199 --> 06:33:50.722]  Everybody knows, I don't over-hype stuff, I always say we're behind, we gotta win, all that stuff.
[06:33:51.122 --> 06:33:54.765]  Folks, this is the day, peacefully, that America was reborn.
[06:33:55.065 --> 06:33:58.527]  This is 1776, Part 2, January 20th, 2017.
[06:33:58.728 --> 06:34:02.210]  This is an epic moment we should all celebrate.
[06:34:02.510 --> 06:34:06.173]  We haven't won the war, but we've won major battles, and we're gonna win the war.
[06:34:06.573 --> 06:34:07.434]  Now, this is history.
[06:34:08.135 --> 06:34:09.195]  This is 1776, July 4th, Part 2.
[06:34:09.255 --> 06:34:12.838]  You can say it was November 8th, 2016, you can say it was
[06:34:16.195 --> 06:34:17.496]  January 20th, 2017.
[06:34:17.676 --> 06:34:18.456]  I don't know.
[06:34:18.776 --> 06:34:19.577]  We can think about that.
[06:34:19.617 --> 06:34:20.217]  But you know what?
[06:34:20.737 --> 06:34:22.698]  This whole time period... Let me ask these guys up here.
[06:34:25.700 --> 06:34:26.220]  God bless you.
[06:34:26.240 --> 06:34:26.781]  Come on over here.
[06:34:27.961 --> 06:34:29.122]  We're live streaming right now.
[06:34:30.523 --> 06:34:31.423]  God bless you, sir.
[06:34:31.443 --> 06:34:35.745]  What's your name?
[06:34:36.046 --> 06:34:36.846]  Hey man, listen.
[06:34:37.406 --> 06:34:37.827]  Alex Jones.
[06:34:37.847 --> 06:34:38.727]  I'm happy to see him, man.
[06:34:38.767 --> 06:34:40.788]  But like I said before, y'all better wake up.
[06:34:41.308 --> 06:34:42.229]  Keep your eyes open, man.
[06:34:42.802 --> 06:34:43.263]  God bless you.
[06:34:43.303 --> 06:34:43.643]  Yeah, man.
[06:34:43.663 --> 06:34:44.564]  God bless you, too, man.
[06:34:44.605 --> 06:34:44.945]  Thank you.
[06:34:45.285 --> 06:34:45.726]  Thank you, sir.
[06:34:45.746 --> 06:34:46.427]  Appreciate you guys.
[06:34:46.707 --> 06:34:46.908]  Always.
[06:34:46.928 --> 06:34:47.428]  Appreciate you.
[06:34:48.570 --> 06:34:53.396]  Now, what we're getting down to here is that... Let me ask you guys this question.
[06:34:54.077 --> 06:34:55.519]  What do we say is the new holiday?
[06:34:55.559 --> 06:34:56.601]  Is it July 4th?
[06:34:57.482 --> 06:34:59.725]  Is it January...
[06:35:00.996 --> 06:35:01.677]  Uh, 20th?
[06:35:02.357 --> 06:35:04.159]  Is it November 8th, 2016?
[06:35:04.279 --> 06:35:06.361]  I mean, when is the demarcation line?
[06:35:06.381 --> 06:35:07.202]  People want numbers.
[06:35:07.963 --> 06:35:09.945]  When is the rebirth of the Republic?
[06:35:10.205 --> 06:35:10.845]  Was it today?
[06:35:10.866 --> 06:35:12.227]  I have a serious question.
[06:35:12.687 --> 06:35:16.191]  Is January 20th the new holiday for the Restore of the Republic?
[06:35:16.931 --> 06:35:17.352]  I'm serious.
[06:35:17.392 --> 06:35:17.992]  This is a big day.
[06:35:18.273 --> 06:35:19.073]  People are going to hear this.
[06:35:20.475 --> 06:35:21.395]  Tim, let me ask you this.
[06:35:22.577 --> 06:35:25.780]  Do we wait until July 4th, or do we need a new holiday on top of July 4th?
[06:35:27.188 --> 06:35:28.890]  When would you say everybody woke up?
[06:35:29.331 --> 06:35:30.192]  I think today.
[06:35:30.212 --> 06:35:33.877]  What do you think about January 20th as like an added holiday of the rebirth of the republic?
[06:35:35.098 --> 06:35:36.380]  I definitely think that'd be a great idea.
[06:35:36.760 --> 06:35:41.366]  I mean, the people have actually finally spoken and, you know, the proof is in the pudding.
[06:35:41.707 --> 06:35:44.611]  That's, you know, that Trump is what they want and they showed up for it today.
[06:35:45.467 --> 06:35:47.850]  You know, I just talked to three black guys that worked out here today.
[06:35:48.210 --> 06:35:49.191]  They were all, we love Trump.
[06:35:49.251 --> 06:35:50.813]  I'll go over to them and they're like, yeah, we like you, Alex.
[06:35:50.833 --> 06:35:51.374]  They're scared.
[06:35:51.394 --> 06:35:52.695]  Well, it's okay.
[06:35:52.735 --> 06:35:54.577]  You know, they tell you it's all BS.
[06:35:54.597 --> 06:35:56.540]  He wants to cut your taxes and bring jobs to everybody.
[06:35:57.000 --> 06:35:59.423]  It just shows the bullying that they're ready to talk to us.
[06:35:59.463 --> 06:36:00.904]  Not on camera, though, because they know.
[06:36:00.944 --> 06:36:01.185]  Go ahead.
[06:36:02.352 --> 06:36:03.493]  Well, and it just proved it, too.
[06:36:03.613 --> 06:36:09.557]  You know, the majority of the protesters that said they were going to come down here and do what they wanted to do is a very small percentage that actually showed up.
[06:36:09.917 --> 06:36:11.058]  You know, they just didn't even show up.
[06:36:11.398 --> 06:36:11.738]  Exactly.
[06:36:11.758 --> 06:36:12.479]  And you know what?
[06:36:12.579 --> 06:36:18.543]  You can't really blame the vast majority of people out there for feeling all this fear, because that's what the mainstream media has been pushing on them.
[06:36:18.583 --> 06:36:24.246]  They've been pushing that this is the end of the world, that, you know, Trump is some kind of, like, satanic clown that's going to come eat their brains.
[06:36:25.967 --> 06:36:33.489]  I get why they feel scared, I get why they feel like they might be marginalized, or why things are going to suddenly get bad.
[06:36:34.109 --> 06:36:50.953]  But, as we all know, and everybody's been paying attention, especially all the info warriors that are watching, that the propaganda that is being spun, especially in this last election, has been just rampant with absolute lies and distortions, and they didn't even cover the majority of the stuff that came out about Hillary Clinton, including
[06:36:51.593 --> 06:36:56.096]  You know, Donna Brazile giving her the questions before a debate, you know?
[06:36:56.316 --> 06:36:59.318]  And Wolf... What's his name?
[06:36:59.378 --> 06:37:01.179]  Wolf... What's his name, Josh?
[06:37:01.199 --> 06:37:01.500]  Blitzer?
[06:37:01.740 --> 06:37:02.740]  Yeah, Wolf Blitzer.
[06:37:02.840 --> 06:37:05.982]  I mean, how horrific is that?
[06:37:06.022 --> 06:37:07.784]  That that happened and they didn't even talk about it.
[06:37:08.044 --> 06:37:08.464]  I agree.
[06:37:08.484 --> 06:37:09.365]  We're going to bring you back.
[06:37:09.705 --> 06:37:10.846]  But Q is not going to be on air.
[06:37:10.866 --> 06:37:12.627]  He was just taking this as the biggest thing in his life.
[06:37:12.907 --> 06:37:14.108]  Get over here right now and come on air.
[06:37:14.943 --> 06:37:16.104]  Don't like Coward over there.
[06:37:16.324 --> 06:37:17.584]  Oh my God, he's afraid to come on air.
[06:37:18.185 --> 06:37:18.625]  No, it is.
[06:37:18.705 --> 06:37:19.245]  Buckley, come back.
[06:37:19.826 --> 06:37:20.386]  He's afraid.
[06:37:20.946 --> 06:37:21.466]  Come back here.
[06:37:22.307 --> 06:37:22.787]  No, it is.
[06:37:22.847 --> 06:37:25.428]  I mean, I myself am, like, wanting to pinch myself.
[06:37:25.448 --> 06:37:26.649]  Do you realize this is happening?
[06:37:26.929 --> 06:37:27.670]  And it is.
[06:37:27.690 --> 06:37:28.890]  We've won the war, but we're winning battles.
[06:37:28.930 --> 06:37:29.410]  Get over here.
[06:37:30.591 --> 06:37:30.991]  Right now.
[06:37:32.492 --> 06:37:34.153]  Anyways, no, you're getting back on air.
[06:37:34.173 --> 06:37:34.573]  Come on.
[06:37:34.593 --> 06:37:35.654]  Tell folks, you're repeating me.
[06:37:35.714 --> 06:37:35.974]  Go ahead.
[06:37:37.214 --> 06:37:43.918]  Just basically, we're having a discussion off camera, talking about how big this is, and that basically this is, um,
[06:37:45.609 --> 06:37:58.711]  You know, the largest thing that we'll be associated with in our history, in people our age, people our grandparents, our children, there is not a bigger time or a bigger mission than what we've just recently accomplished.
[06:37:58.991 --> 06:38:06.433]  And it's not just, it's not political, it's about bringing back things to America, making America what it is.
[06:38:08.133 --> 06:38:12.134]  You know, it's not a slogan of make America great, it's just
[06:38:13.663 --> 06:38:17.644]  You know, this is our chance now to make it what it needs to be, to go in, to work.
[06:38:18.845 --> 06:38:28.888]  And I'm super proud to be part of the moment, to be part of the entire mission, to support staff that helped do all this stuff.
[06:38:31.389 --> 06:38:32.069]  Very well said.
[06:38:33.090 --> 06:38:33.831]  That's Quentin Carter.
[06:38:33.851 --> 06:38:35.313]  He helps us out and works with us a lot.
[06:38:35.333 --> 06:38:36.054]  He works real hard.
[06:38:37.476 --> 06:38:47.630]  One thing that I was thinking about in that context is that, yes, this will be a day long remembered, as Alex likes to say, and you can think about those moments in time, you know, like nine
[06:38:47.790 --> 06:38:48.010]  I don't
[06:39:07.395 --> 06:39:09.516]  Woke up and decided that, hey, wait a minute.
[06:39:09.917 --> 06:39:24.947]  It took a big, long look at itself, a big introspective look and said, hey, are we a bunch of people that want to enslave the population and put fear into people's hearts and want to, like, move people into, like, compact cities and tax them and take away their cars?
[06:39:24.967 --> 06:39:25.367]  That's right.
[06:39:25.387 --> 06:39:26.208]  That's what I want to say.
[06:39:26.288 --> 06:39:31.011]  No, we don't want to be... Their whole globalist program of making us poor and screwing us over is over, okay?
[06:39:31.291 --> 06:39:32.332]  You think we started fighting?
[06:39:32.352 --> 06:39:32.752]  Get ready.
[06:39:33.252 --> 06:39:37.215]  You need to capitulate now and give up and start being pro-humans instead of anti-human.
[06:39:38.116 --> 06:39:39.938]  Let me tell you something, I'm not afraid to die.
[06:39:41.259 --> 06:39:43.201]  As long as I'm some tough guy, I'm not a slave.
[06:39:43.221 --> 06:39:45.403]  If you want to fight, you're going to get one.
[06:39:45.964 --> 06:39:46.544]  Remember that always.
[06:39:46.945 --> 06:39:51.449]  You want to fight, you're going to get one, and you're going to pay, and everybody you're with is going to pay.
[06:39:52.290 --> 06:39:53.171]  So, just get ready.
[06:39:54.272 --> 06:39:58.937]  Just get ready, because if you think you're going to back us off, you think you're going to win, get ready.
[06:39:58.957 --> 06:40:00.359]  We're only starting this fight.
[06:40:01.289 --> 06:40:17.367]  Absolutely, and one thing I'd like to say is I'd like to thank everybody out there that supported us, has stuck with us, has listened to the broadcast, you know, has gone to our store and bought our products and made, you know, put your money where your mouth is, because it means a lot to us to be able to come out here and do these things.
[06:40:17.708 --> 06:40:19.530]  I mean, you know... That's right, you brought us here!
[06:40:19.950 --> 06:40:20.390]  Exactly.
[06:40:20.450 --> 06:40:21.171]  You brought us here.
[06:40:21.231 --> 06:40:22.111]  You made this happen.
[06:40:22.151 --> 06:40:23.292]  You are the Info Warriors.
[06:40:23.312 --> 06:40:29.755]  You're the ones that help us amplify the message and put it out there and send it out to millions of people on a daily basis.
[06:40:29.795 --> 06:40:33.597]  So, realistically, like, you guys are the ones that made this happen.
[06:40:33.617 --> 06:40:34.918]  Because it wouldn't have happened without you.
[06:40:34.978 --> 06:40:35.538]  So, thank you.
[06:40:35.799 --> 06:40:37.319]  Yeah, it's not some condescension.
[06:40:37.640 --> 06:40:39.120]  We go, oh, thanks for your support.
[06:40:39.601 --> 06:40:41.362]  When I punch the enemy, it's like a video game.
[06:40:41.642 --> 06:40:42.902]  If you're not behind me, there's no power.
[06:40:43.163 --> 06:40:45.364]  When you get behind me, it's like I knock him down.
[06:40:46.374 --> 06:40:48.215]  That's why I kiss your ass all day, because you are it.
[06:40:48.695 --> 06:40:51.096]  That's why it's a sick joke with a thousand people today.
[06:40:51.396 --> 06:40:51.956]  Shook my hand.
[06:40:51.976 --> 06:40:52.376]  A thousand.
[06:40:52.817 --> 06:40:53.337]  Conservatively.
[06:40:53.377 --> 06:40:53.957]  Hundreds an hour.
[06:40:54.677 --> 06:40:55.598]  They said, oh, we appreciate you.
[06:40:55.618 --> 06:40:56.338]  You appreciate me?
[06:40:56.718 --> 06:40:58.099]  We're all in the same damn battle together.
[06:40:58.119 --> 06:40:58.919]  I appreciate you.
[06:40:59.780 --> 06:41:01.280]  They don't say that with an anger at you.
[06:41:01.340 --> 06:41:02.821]  It's an obscenity to thank me.
[06:41:03.721 --> 06:41:04.622]  It's all the globalists.
[06:41:04.642 --> 06:41:06.282]  That's where you kiss the ass of the establishment.
[06:41:06.702 --> 06:41:08.463]  Shit, I'll kiss your ass right now.
[06:41:09.544 --> 06:41:10.044]  I want victory.
[06:41:11.351 --> 06:41:14.592]  And Alex makes a really good point, is that today we were mobbed.
[06:41:14.612 --> 06:41:15.853]  I mean, we were walking down the street.
[06:41:15.893 --> 06:41:17.053]  We couldn't go a block without 50, 30, 100.
[06:41:18.094 --> 06:41:20.895]  A bunch of rabbis came over and started dancing with him.
[06:41:21.135 --> 06:41:23.296]  A bunch of black ladies came over and started singing with him.
[06:41:23.536 --> 06:41:28.798]  There were Asian people, people from Thailand, that even I'm probably sure there was an Eskimo or one or two in there.
[06:41:29.198 --> 06:41:30.359]  And Chinese.
[06:41:30.599 --> 06:41:31.219]  And exactly.
[06:41:31.259 --> 06:41:38.822]  And so the point is, is that I know that wherever you are right now, you might feel isolated because all the media is projecting into your head is that how
[06:41:39.202 --> 06:41:46.629]  How people that believe what we believe are racist, and that we're idiots, and that we're uneducated white males, and that we're alone, and that we don't have any support, but it's not true.
[06:41:46.890 --> 06:41:56.419]  Let me tell you, there are millions of people out there, millions of people that can hold your hand, that can be there with you, and that can stand up and say that this is what we want.
[06:41:56.479 --> 06:41:58.261]  This is the direction we want to take our country.
[06:41:59.101 --> 06:42:00.722]  We're sick of all the globalist ideas.
[06:42:00.962 --> 06:42:11.606]  We're sick of all the liberals trying to change our language and trying to make us all feel bad about imaginary emotional crimes that they're projecting onto us.
[06:42:12.186 --> 06:42:12.626]  Bullshit!
[06:42:12.666 --> 06:42:13.646]  That's not real anymore.
[06:42:13.966 --> 06:42:14.747]  That is not real.
[06:42:14.827 --> 06:42:15.627]  We've destroyed it.
[06:42:16.027 --> 06:42:20.388]  We have moved on through that, we have bulldozed over it, and now we're about reality.
[06:42:20.588 --> 06:42:31.110]  We're about looking at where we are as human beings and as Americans, and putting all our effort into literally getting this country off of its knees, back onto its feet, and productive.
[06:42:31.330 --> 06:42:42.192]  And so, I hope that in the coming months and years, it's going to be a big fight, and, you know, let's be compassionate to all those people that don't believe what we believe, because we need to open their eyes.
[06:42:42.252 --> 06:42:44.513]  We need to make them see what you know already.
[06:42:46.209 --> 06:42:59.757]  Let's reach out to them, let's try to grow the family, let's try to bring people in with inclusion, let's try to make other people understand what we know already about the schemes of the globalists and how we can defeat them and how we can only do it with their help.
[06:43:00.118 --> 06:43:11.705]  So, go out there, talk to people, watch the broadcast, share the links, go to InfoWars.com, go to InfoWarsStore.com, please peruse it, check out all the awesome products, and we're going to still be doing this.
[06:43:12.383 --> 06:43:13.083]  We're not going to quit.
[06:43:13.424 --> 06:43:15.625]  So, we need you to keep doing what you do, too.
[06:43:15.725 --> 06:43:22.290]  So, thank you from the bottom of my heart, everybody out there, for supporting us and believing in us and following us all the way to this victory.
[06:43:22.350 --> 06:43:26.072]  So, I think we're at the finish line.
[06:43:26.693 --> 06:43:29.475]  The time has run out for this game, but there's another game next week.
[06:43:29.875 --> 06:43:31.616]  So let's all make sure we keep our heads clear.
[06:43:31.816 --> 06:43:32.996]  Let's make sure we stay sharp.
[06:43:33.256 --> 06:43:36.277]  Let's make sure we stay in the game because they will stop at nothing.
[06:43:36.317 --> 06:43:40.178]  They'll have a million tricks up their sleeve and they will come at us with whatever they have.
[06:43:40.438 --> 06:43:43.379]  So we've got to be ready and we're going to count on you guys to have our back.
[06:43:43.679 --> 06:43:46.379]  This is Buckley Hammond signing off from Washington D.C.
[06:43:46.399 --> 06:43:50.281]  from the Trump inauguration in January 20th, 2017.
[06:43:51.321 --> 06:43:54.442]  A historic moment and I was so happy to share it with you guys.
[06:43:54.902 --> 06:43:55.462]  Have a good night.
[06:43:59.187 --> 06:44:16.641]  Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to the stage for the arrival of the President and First Lady.
[06:44:16.701 --> 06:44:27.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is our honor to present to you the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and the First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump.
[06:45:13.689 --> 06:45:15.830]  That is what I call great talent.
[06:45:15.990 --> 06:45:16.931]  Thank you very much.
[06:45:17.491 --> 06:45:18.151]  Great talent.
[06:45:18.251 --> 06:45:18.631]  Thank you.
[06:45:18.672 --> 06:45:22.994]  Well, we did it.
[06:45:23.194 --> 06:45:23.774]  We did it.
[06:45:29.817 --> 06:45:37.401]  We began this journey and they said we, we and me, we didn't have a chance but we knew we were gonna win.
[06:45:38.741 --> 06:45:39.542]  And we won.
[06:45:39.562 --> 06:45:39.622]  And...
[06:45:43.717 --> 06:45:45.118]  Today we had a great day.
[06:45:47.139 --> 06:45:54.745]  People that weren't so nice to me were saying that we did a really good job today.
[06:45:58.669 --> 06:46:00.369]  They hated to do it, but they did it.
[06:46:00.990 --> 06:46:01.930]  And I respect that.
[06:46:02.750 --> 06:46:03.570]  I respect that.
[06:46:04.451 --> 06:46:08.172]  But I have to say, the crowd was unbelievable today.
[06:46:08.232 --> 06:46:11.372]  You know, I looked at the rain, which just never came.
[06:46:11.673 --> 06:46:16.394]  You know, we finished the speech, went inside, it poured,
[06:46:17.677 --> 06:46:22.238]  Then we came outside, the helicopter scene was an incredible scene.
[06:46:23.158 --> 06:46:24.958]  An incredible scene, so beautiful.
[06:46:25.538 --> 06:46:27.639]  Like from a movie set, so beautiful.
[06:46:28.099 --> 06:46:33.700]  And then, and then, amazingly, it rained and then we went out.
[06:46:33.780 --> 06:46:37.220]  It's like God was looking down on us, I will tell you.
[06:46:37.240 --> 06:46:42.701]  I want to thank all of our supporters.
[06:46:43.921 --> 06:46:46.622]  My number one supporter, Melania, what she puts up with.
[06:46:49.175 --> 06:46:49.895]  Thank you.
[06:46:52.736 --> 06:46:56.077]  Now, we really we really did something that's so special.
[06:46:56.897 --> 06:46:58.438]  And this evening is so special.
[06:46:58.618 --> 06:47:00.818]  And this whole day and yesterday.
[06:47:01.638 --> 06:47:02.459]  So incredible.
[06:47:02.539 --> 06:47:05.239]  So many people made such a difference.
[06:47:05.940 --> 06:47:08.400]  Vice President Mike Pence.
[06:47:09.221 --> 06:47:09.981]  No more elect.
[06:47:11.241 --> 06:47:11.921]  Was incredible.
[06:47:14.002 --> 06:47:17.523]  And all of the people you're going to see things happening over the next
[06:47:18.706 --> 06:47:19.226]  Few weeks.
[06:47:19.907 --> 06:47:21.148]  Oh, you're gonna be so happy.
[06:47:22.069 --> 06:47:22.589]  You're gonna be.
[06:47:24.370 --> 06:47:27.353]  Because, you know, they're very elegant people tonight.
[06:47:28.073 --> 06:47:30.755]  But they're also very political people, right?
[06:47:31.956 --> 06:47:37.060]  We want to see great things happen for our country.
[06:47:37.701 --> 06:47:41.363]  We want to make America great again.
[06:47:41.383 --> 06:47:42.604]  And we will.
[06:47:42.624 --> 06:47:44.526]  And we will.
[06:47:46.280 --> 06:47:52.447]  So now it's a tremendous honor to have the first dance with Melania.
[06:47:54.469 --> 06:47:59.635]  And we're going to be joined by our Vice President.
[06:47:59.715 --> 06:48:05.060]  We're going to be joined by some very wonderful, wonderful children as we go along.
[06:48:05.120 --> 06:48:07.063]  They happen to be my children and Mike's children.
[06:48:08.943 --> 06:48:12.446]  And I just want to, again, I want to thank everybody.
[06:48:13.306 --> 06:48:14.927]  We always felt we were going to do it.
[06:48:15.648 --> 06:48:20.151]  It's a movement like they've never seen anywhere at any time anywhere in the world.
[06:48:20.892 --> 06:48:21.912]  This was a movement.
[06:48:22.713 --> 06:48:25.195]  And now the work begins.
[06:48:25.715 --> 06:48:26.756]  Now the work begins.
[06:48:27.196 --> 06:48:28.417]  There's no games, right?
[06:48:28.497 --> 06:48:29.038]  No games.
[06:48:29.898 --> 06:48:30.198]  Right?
[06:48:30.278 --> 06:48:31.679]  We're not playing games.
[06:48:31.739 --> 06:48:32.500]  The work begins.
[06:48:33.020 --> 06:48:34.341]  I want to thank everybody.
[06:48:34.641 --> 06:48:35.421]  We love you.
[06:48:35.441 --> 06:48:37.762]  We're going to be working for you.
[06:48:37.782 --> 06:48:41.965]  And we're going to be producing results.
[06:48:42.045 --> 06:48:43.005]  Thank you, everybody.
[06:48:43.025 --> 06:48:43.946]  Have a great night.
[06:48:44.126 --> 06:48:44.606]  Thank you.
[06:48:44.626 --> 06:48:45.627]  Thank you.
[06:48:48.664 --> 06:48:53.327]  And now, the President and First Lady of the United States will take their first dance.
[06:48:54.528 --> 06:48:59.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, the first couple, Donald and Melania Trump.
[06:49:07.976 --> 06:49:13.279]  Now, the end is near, and so I fade.
[06:49:23.010 --> 06:49:26.431]  I'll speak my case, of which I'm certain.
[06:49:26.672 --> 06:49:33.634]  I've lived a life that's full of trouble each and every time, wait, anymore.
[06:49:33.675 --> 06:49:35.935]  Much more than this, I did.
[06:50:07.069 --> 06:50:07.649]  I don't know.
[06:55:23.339 --> 06:55:23.660]  We're good to go.
[06:56:10.877 --> 06:56:11.970]  Everyone, please stand.
[06:56:30.529 --> 06:56:33.592]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[06:56:33.612 --> 06:56:37.416]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[06:56:37.436 --> 06:56:41.259]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[06:56:41.639 --> 06:56:43.681]  That I will faithfully execute.
[06:56:43.701 --> 06:56:46.504]  That I will faithfully execute.
[06:56:46.744 --> 06:56:49.427]  The office of President of the United States.
[06:56:49.807 --> 06:56:52.728]  The office of President of the United States.
[06:56:53.148 --> 06:56:55.109]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[06:56:55.609 --> 06:56:57.810]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[06:56:58.170 --> 06:57:00.250]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[06:57:00.671 --> 06:57:02.471]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[06:57:02.751 --> 06:57:04.752]  The Constitution of the United States.
[06:57:04.872 --> 06:57:07.233]  The Constitution of the United States.
[06:57:07.393 --> 06:57:08.213]  So help me God.
[06:57:08.453 --> 06:57:09.293]  So help me God.
[06:57:09.814 --> 06:57:11.054]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[06:58:19.502 --> 06:58:29.871]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[06:58:56.038 --> 06:59:10.609]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[06:59:16.334 --> 06:59:30.045]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[06:59:32.167 --> 06:59:40.053]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[06:59:41.536 --> 06:59:43.159]  We will face challenges.
[06:59:43.760 --> 06:59:45.422]  We will confront hardships.
[06:59:46.063 --> 06:59:48.127]  But we will get the job done.
[06:59:49.549 --> 06:59:55.759]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[06:59:56.900 --> 07:00:07.635]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[07:00:08.296 --> 07:00:10.599]  They have been magnificent.
[07:00:10.920 --> 07:00:11.320]  Thank you.
[07:00:18.834 --> 07:00:23.138]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[07:00:24.039 --> 07:00:32.428]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[07:00:33.109 --> 07:00:40.917]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
