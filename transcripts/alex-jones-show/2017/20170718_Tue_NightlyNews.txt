[00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.384]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.125]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:22.726]  It's Tuesday, July 18th, 2017.
[00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:25.308]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.914]  Tonight, Republicans have to face the music in their failed attempt to replace Obamacare.
[00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.596]  But the lack of repeal shows the true nature of the GOP.
[00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:46.663]  Also, a Somali police officer inexplicably kills a woman in Minnesota, showing the bias of the left and the lunacy of gun control.
[00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:50.895]  Meanwhile, the highest ranking U.S.
[00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:55.637]  politician to ever be put in prison walks free after only 13 months in jail.
[00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.139]  13 months for what a judge once called a serial child molester.
[00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:11.904]  And then... Feminists and liberals are teaming up in the culture war to destroy whatever remains of Western civilization, demonizing anything they see as bigotry.
[00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:20.250]  All that and more tonight on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.358]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.656]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:55.580]  So please, secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:18.347]  Hashtag fake GOP.
[00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:21.088]  Make that very fake GOP.
[00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:27.449]  Today what we saw was not only repeal and replace fall through but immediately they said alright we're just going to do repeal.
[00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.730]  We've already voted on that.
[00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:38.552]  We've had the majority of the Senate vote for that in 2015 so we should be able to get that passed and then we have enough Republican senators immediately say no we're not going to vote for it now.
[00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:43.555]  Because before, Obama was going to veto it.
[00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:44.096]  And he did.
[00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:45.857]  But now it would go through.
[00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:48.359]  And so now we see what they were really doing.
[00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.142]  They were simply trolling us, these senators who did this.
[00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:55.564]  We're going to name and shame the ones who have done it so far.
[00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.667]  But first of all, Plan C. That was what they were coming up with.
[00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:01.409]  Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. There is no plan, folks.
[00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.589]  They never had a plan.
[00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.493]  There was never a plan put forward by the GOP to repeal Obamacare.
[00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.435]  And if you have no plan, you're planning to fail.
[00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:10.736]  They never had a plan.
[00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.879]  They can call it Plan C or whatever, but we see through their charade now.
[00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.500]  It's a very fake GOP.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.185]  Plan C on Obamacare, says the New York Times, repeal and replace later, has now collapsed.
[00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:24.526]  Senators Susan Collins of Maine,
[00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:35.992]  Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all Republicans, immediately declared they could not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.
[00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:39.994]  I did not come to Washington to hurt people, said Ms.
[00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:41.495]  Caputo.
[00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:46.277]  Now this is the West Virginia senator who took the place of Rockefeller.
[00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:47.658]  And West Virginia.
[00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:52.121]  And quite frankly, she's not there in Washington to protect people.
[00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:55.283]  She doesn't want to hurt banks and insurance companies.
[00:04:55.343 --> 00:04:57.785]  That's what she is representing with the Rockefeller interest.
[00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:59.667]  She is part of the establishment.
[00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:02.369]  She is Exhibit A. So what's wrong?
[00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:03.770]  Now it's not just those people.
[00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.452]  As The Daily Caller pointed out, they put up the roll call of 2015.
[00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:12.957]  They said these 48 Republican senators voted for a clean Obamacare repeal just two years ago.
[00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:14.538]  In 2015.
[00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:26.703]  Now of those three that I just read you, we had Senators Murkowski of Alaska and the one I just talked about from West Virginia that voted to repeal and now they say they're not going to vote for repeal.
[00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:36.408]  But there's a third one who comes in with this as well and this is Senator Jerry Moran and he is from Kansas and look at what Senator Moran did today.
[00:05:37.068 --> 00:05:47.014]  He jumped the tracks in the Senate subway on Capitol Hill so that he could get away from a large gathering of reporters who wanted to ask him why he was a turncoat on this.
[00:05:47.894 --> 00:05:54.798]  I hope that next time he does this, instead of pissing on voters, he pisses on the third rail.
[00:05:54.818 --> 00:06:01.782]  Because you all know what happens if you take a leak on the third rail that's electrified in these subway systems.
[00:06:02.322 --> 00:06:03.123]  You get quite a shock.
[00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.264]  And it should be a shock for voters.
[00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:09.489]  This guy can run, but let's hope that when it comes time for re-election that he can't hide.
[00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:14.974]  This is absolutely shameful, and there you can see him running and dodging the reporters.
[00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:17.757]  Let's hope that he doesn't run and dodge the voters.
[00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.172]  So Trump's reaction was let Obamacare fail.
[00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:26.497]  He said it'll be a lot easier and I think it'll probably be that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail.
[00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:27.838]  We're not going to own it.
[00:06:28.058 --> 00:06:29.139]  I'm not going to own it.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.042]  I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.
[00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:36.307]  Well I disagree with that last thing because Republicans do own it.
[00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:38.969]  The GOP Congress does own this.
[00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.635]  They've had the centrists who have said that they put their foot down on tax reform.
[00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:57.089]  They have stood for subsidies for massive insurance companies who are getting rich profiting off of a government that holds a gun to our head and forces us to buy their
[00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.295]  Policies that contain things that we don't want and we don't need, like maternity care for single males.
[00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:07.277]  We don't want or need that and we cannot afford it.
[00:07:07.558 --> 00:07:10.480]  It is not doing anything to drive the cost of health care down.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.881]  They talked about it being affordable care.
[00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.784]  It has done nothing to make health care or health insurance more affordable.
[00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:20.308]  And now the metric has become how many people are going to be insured.
[00:07:20.868 --> 00:07:21.068]  Well,
[00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:34.472]  Donald Trump's Attorney General Sessions could stop all of this because the subsidies that are now the metric, because it's now about universal coverage instead of affordability, the person who could stop this is Attorney General Sessions.
[00:07:34.592 --> 00:07:45.094]  As Jerome Corsi has pointed out with his research, the funding for this was never appropriated by Congress, so Obama just stole it from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors.
[00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:47.375]  They did what they called a net asset sweep.
[00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:48.855]  You and I would call that theft.
[00:07:50.017 --> 00:07:52.498]  And then they appealed it.
[00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:57.361]  Eric Holder appealed this decision from a judge who said, you can't do this.
[00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.442]  The Congress has to appropriate the money.
[00:07:59.722 --> 00:08:00.683]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:01.683]  Shut that down.
[00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:02.264]  They appealed it.
[00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:03.504]  The appeal is still there.
[00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.707]  And Attorney General Sessions could stop the funding of these subsidies.
[00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.207]  If he just wanted to drop that appeal.
[00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:10.868]  But he doesn't.
[00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:19.269]  And we're going to talk later in this broadcast about how Attorney General Sessions wants to use theft not only to fund Obamacare, but to fund law enforcement.
[00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:22.930]  He's going to be stepping up civil asset forfeiture in America.
[00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.551]  Real quickly, let's take a look at our actual health.
[00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:35.613]  Because, you know, it's all about the cancer treatment industry and big businesses' interest, the interest of the insurance companies and so forth.
[00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:37.133]  It's not really about our health, is it?
[00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:40.595]  And we can see this very clearly with what's going on in California.
[00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:45.859]  They have a cancer-causing chemical that they found in massive quantities in some small California towns.
[00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.900]  It's called TCP.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.302]  It's actually called 123-TCP.
[00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:53.105]  It's an abbreviation for trichloropropane.
[00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:55.787]  This is in the Central Valley of California.
[00:08:55.807 --> 00:09:04.894]  They say hundreds of wells that provide water to a million people are tainted with a chemical that some experts say is one of the most powerful cancer-causing agents in the world.
[00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:09.920]  They say that Environmental Protection Agency has concluded it's likely to be carcinogenic to humans.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.307]  The California Water Board warns residents not even to shower with this tainted water because they might inhale the chemical.
[00:09:16.748 --> 00:09:18.910]  NBC News was in one of these towns, Arvin.
[00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.852]  They tested the water for TCP.
[00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:25.617]  A state-certified lab found more than six times the amount that the state says is acceptable.
[00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.039]  Now where did this come from?
[00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.382]  It's used as a degreasing agent in the production of plastic products.
[00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:33.285]  There's a couple of corporations that put it there.
[00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:36.508]  It was Shell Oil and Dow Chemical.
[00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:47.318]  They saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants and put it into barrels and sell it to farmers who would then inject it into the ground.
[00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:58.544]  Now, that's according to a lawyer who is representing 30 different communities that are suing these two corporations, Dow and Shell, to get them to pay for a multi-million dollar cleanup, a filtration.
[00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:10.831]  They say the companies, however, won in lawsuits going back in 2010, but they have settled other lawsuits and recently they lost their first lawsuit to Central Valley City, two hours north of Arvin.
[00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:15.674]  The jury awarded Clovis, California $22 million to treat contaminated wells and remove it from the wells.
[00:10:16.294 --> 00:10:23.299]  They say, among the documents that this lawyer found is an internal memo in which Dow scientists claim that TCP was garbage.
[00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.780]  They acknowledge that it had little utility in killing pests.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.042]  Presumably that's what they were telling the farmers here.
[00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:29.382]  Put this on your ground.
[00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:31.244]  You can use it as a pesticide.
[00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:33.225]  They say, no, actually we know it's not a pesticide.
[00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:35.847]  We just want to get rid of it and we want to charge people for it.
[00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:37.768]  It's kind of what they do with fluoride, isn't it?
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.721]  It is a pesticide.
[00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:42.665]  It's used as a toxic pesticide in China.
[00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.909]  It is a heavily toxic substance.
[00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:51.215]  But they sell it to people to say, oh, we're going to use it to fight cavities.
[00:10:51.575 --> 00:10:54.078]  And so we want you to put it in your municipal water supply.
[00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:54.939]  So what are you going to do?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:03.043]  Are you going to wait for the government to discover that there is toxic stuff in your water, like we found out in Flint, Michigan, about the lead?
[00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:06.384]  Or now they're finding out about TCP in California?
[00:11:06.944 --> 00:11:08.745]  You can do something about that.
[00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:11.086]  And, you know, we sell water filters here.
[00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:13.467]  Look at the ProPure water filtration.
[00:11:13.487 --> 00:11:18.669]  So I looked up this particular substance to see if it was one that is filtered, and there it is.
[00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.830]  1, 2, 3, trichloropropane.
[00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:26.653]  That filter takes out 99.4% of that in the water.
[00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:30.434]  You can do something to protect yourself, to protect your family.
[00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:36.798]  You don't have to wait for the government to protect you, for the government to discover that this is being put in the water.
[00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:47.703]  Meanwhile, in D.C., we've had the District of Columbia telling doctors and pharmacies that they're now allowed to prescribe life-ending medication to terminally ill patients.
[00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:49.604]  They call this death with dignity.
[00:11:49.644 --> 00:11:50.705]  But you have to understand
[00:11:51.505 --> 00:12:02.011]  That what this is truly about, to say that we're going to have physicians help you to die instead of letting nature take its course, this is really about the cult of death.
[00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:15.017]  And it is about cheapening life so that government in the future can take it from you, just like we see them trying to do with Charlie Gard, the 11 month old baby in the UK that is not allowed to come to America to get an experimental treatment.
[00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:17.699]  Or as we see with the FDA, constantly denying
[00:12:18.682 --> 00:12:20.503]  Treatment to terminally ill patients.
[00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:24.325]  We're going to talk to a doctor later in the show about those very issues.
[00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:31.790]  Now let's go to now Attorney General Sessions and his plan, as I would call it, to expand slavery.
[00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:39.114]  And the reason I say that is because if you don't have any property rights, you are the property.
[00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:42.696]  In a free society, you have property rights.
[00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:50.237]  And you have a system of law that protects your property through due process if there are criminal actions.
[00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.601]  But as National Review pointed out in December, it was very troubling.
[00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:57.706]  We knew that Jeff Sessions was a pro-drug war warrior.
[00:12:58.206 --> 00:12:59.868]  We knew that he supported what is
[00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:03.232]  Ridiculously called civil asset forfeiture.
[00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:06.353]  Folks, it is nothing but unconstitutional theft.
[00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:08.834]  And now he is saying he's going to ramp this up.
[00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.054]  But let's go back to December.
[00:13:10.594 --> 00:13:12.695]  And let's take a look at what they were saying in National Review.
[00:13:12.715 --> 00:13:15.996]  We're going to take a look at what National Review says and what Mother Jones says.
[00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:20.417]  Because people on both the left and the right see this for what it is.
[00:13:20.698 --> 00:13:24.819]  But the vast majority of Americans don't even know what civil asset forfeiture is.
[00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:26.721]  I don't think Donald Trump knows what it is.
[00:13:26.842 --> 00:13:29.025]  I know that Megyn Kelly doesn't know when she was here.
[00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:30.728]  I mentioned it to her and she was puzzled.
[00:13:30.928 --> 00:13:31.429]  What is that?
[00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.013]  They don't even know because they don't care.
[00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:39.522]  And I want to give you an example because that's where you really understand what is involved here.
[00:13:40.464 --> 00:13:41.425]  The National Review story.
[00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:45.209]  They're talking about a couple, Christos and Markella Soravellas.
[00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.293]  They said the worst thing possible for them was losing their home.
[00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:49.374]  It was already paid for.
[00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:55.441]  They had a situation where their son who was living at home was arrested for selling a small amount of drugs away from home.
[00:13:55.561 --> 00:13:56.982]  Soon they said there was a knock on their door.
[00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:59.584]  By the police who said, we're here to take your house.
[00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:01.786]  You're going to be living on the street.
[00:14:01.886 --> 00:14:03.187]  We do this every day.
[00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:04.928]  Their doors were locked with screws.
[00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:06.409]  Their utilities were cut off.
[00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:10.631]  They had already paid off the mortgage on the $350,000 home.
[00:14:11.012 --> 00:14:13.913]  That's why the police wanted it.
[00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:15.274]  That's why they would target it.
[00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.756]  That's how they're funding their police program.
[00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:19.377]  It's a major source of funding for them.
[00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:22.139]  No crime had been committed at the home.
[00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:26.207]  The people who own the home, the parents, were not even accused of this.
[00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:35.189]  And if you look at the documents, the case against them was the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania versus 12011 Ferndale Street.
[00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.770]  Somehow, a crime had been committed by the House.
[00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.251]  And that's the essence of civil asset forfeiture.
[00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:42.631]  It is a lie!
[00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:46.273]  To say that you are taking down drug dealers.
[00:14:46.373 --> 00:14:52.156]  This is something that is a cross between Orwell's 1984 and Alice in Wonderland.
[00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:57.419]  The absurdity, the criminality, and the tyranny of it is beyond description.
[00:14:57.879 --> 00:14:58.900]  Let me give you another case.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.581]  One of the first ones that I saw.
[00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:04.823]  A guy who had a business where he would fly people charter jets.
[00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:08.605]  He took a couple of businessmen with briefcases from the United States into Canada.
[00:15:08.645 --> 00:15:09.206]  They had a meeting.
[00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:09.986]  He flew them back.
[00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:11.027]  When they landed,
[00:15:12.207 --> 00:15:18.351]  They were surrounded by federal agents who arrested these two men and impounded his plane and confiscated it.
[00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:19.971]  Now, they never charged him with a crime.
[00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:23.774]  They knew that he didn't have any idea what was going on.
[00:15:24.234 --> 00:15:25.815]  But there again, it was the U.S.
[00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:28.776]  versus Learjet, serial number blah blah blah.
[00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:32.398]  They confiscated his plane, which was his only source of income.
[00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:36.380]  He had to fight them in court to prove his innocence.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.942]  He had to sue them civilly to get it.
[00:15:39.662 --> 00:15:45.684]  Because they didn't accuse him of a crime, they didn't find him guilty of a crime, they just confiscated his property.
[00:15:46.204 --> 00:15:57.007]  Now, at a 2015 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on forfeiture abuses, then-Senator Sessions, now Attorney General Sessions, said this, and there's three lies in this one sentence.
[00:15:57.047 --> 00:15:57.908]  See if you can catch them.
[00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:05.750]  Taking and seizing and forfeiting through a government judicial process illegal gains from criminal enterprises is not wrong.
[00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:07.700]  He supports it.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.441]  Now, what are the three lies in this?
[00:16:09.841 --> 00:16:11.903]  Number one, there's not a judicial process.
[00:16:12.664 --> 00:16:14.405]  There's no due process being given to anybody.
[00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:19.990]  Number two, there's no gain from the people who are having their assets forfeited like this.
[00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.234]  And the vast majority of these people are not drug dealers or people who have committed any crimes.
[00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:27.196]  They're people like I just told you about.
[00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.478]  That's where the vast majority of these are happening.
[00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:31.519]  And it is not a criminal enterprise.
[00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:33.420]  He's talking about civil asset forfeiture.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.520]  So that in and of itself is a lie.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.182]  To say that because this is a regulation that's created by the bureaucracy, it is now a civil matter.
[00:16:40.222 --> 00:16:42.243]  So you don't have the presumption of innocence.
[00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:43.864]  You don't have any due process.
[00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:45.485]  They can just take whatever they want.
[00:16:45.685 --> 00:16:47.285]  That's something that began with the IRS.
[00:16:47.565 --> 00:16:49.366]  It went on steroids with the war on drugs.
[00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:55.349]  And now we have every agency from the EPA to the FAA doing that kind of crap to people in America.
[00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.289]  That is simply wrong.
[00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.030]  It is theft.
[00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:04.292]  It is criminal operations from our government, from our Attorney General, who just has shredded the Constitution.
[00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:09.134]  He has rejected every principle that we have founded this country upon.
[00:17:09.174 --> 00:17:20.098]  The right to trial by jury, the presumption of innocence, all of these things that we enacted to protect ourselves from an over-the-top, activist, star-chamber courts that we saw during the Middle Ages.
[00:17:20.118 --> 00:17:21.299]  That's all being brought back.
[00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.660]  And as we've had 24 different states
[00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:26.942]  We're good to go.
[00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.432]  The federal government will confiscate it under federal law.
[00:17:48.993 --> 00:17:54.355]  The feds then return much of the property to the local authorities, usually about an 80% cut.
[00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:57.957]  During the Obama administration, the use of adoptive forfeiture decreased.
[00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:02.059]  Sessions' announcement signals that he will seek to reverse that trend.
[00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:07.942]  He said, we hope to issue this week a new directive on asset forfeiture, especially for drug traffickers.
[00:18:07.982 --> 00:18:09.883]  Well, why wouldn't it be just for drug traffickers?
[00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:12.804]  That's what they told us it was for, was just for drug traffickers.
[00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:13.985]  But no, it's really for everybody.
[00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:21.111]  And so he says, with care and professionalism, we plan to develop policies to increase forfeitures.
[00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:23.172]  No criminal... Oh, wait a minute.
[00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:23.933]  They're not criminals.
[00:18:23.993 --> 00:18:25.034]  They're not charged with anything.
[00:18:25.054 --> 00:18:26.415]  They're not convicted of anything, right?
[00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:29.778]  No criminal should be allowed to keep the proceeds of their crime.
[00:18:29.878 --> 00:18:30.678]  They didn't commit a crime.
[00:18:31.219 --> 00:18:36.503]  Adoptive forfeitures are appropriate, as is sharing with our partners.
[00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:37.944]  Partners in crime.
[00:18:38.064 --> 00:18:39.285]  That's your federal government.
[00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:39.685]  Stay with us.
[00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.366]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:05.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:02.807 --> 00:23:05.589]  Joining me today is Ralph Fusatola.
[00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:07.571]  He's known as the Vitamin Lawyer.
[00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:09.933]  He's practiced law for 36 years.
[00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:14.696]  He's represented a lot of people in the natural products, dietary supplements industry.
[00:23:15.077 --> 00:23:16.478]  He's worked as a consultant.
[00:23:16.518 --> 00:23:22.603]  He has the Institute of Health Research, which you can find on the web as inhere.org.
[00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:24.864]  Great acronym there for your website.
[00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:25.625]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:23:25.936 --> 00:23:26.376]  Thank you, David.
[00:23:26.416 --> 00:23:27.896]  I'm really happy to be here.
[00:23:28.076 --> 00:23:30.377]  It's always a pleasure to visit InfoWars.
[00:23:30.897 --> 00:23:38.158]  I'm here maybe every six months and it is a beehive of activity and of freedom fighting for sure.
[00:23:38.178 --> 00:23:38.559]  Well, thank you.
[00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:39.719]  That's what we want to talk about today.
[00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:43.760]  We want to talk about health issues and where they meet liberty and freedom.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.160]  Exactly.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.521]  Because in the news today, we've got, of course, Obamacare and the government taking over our health care.
[00:23:51.421 --> 00:24:16.774]  We also have the Charlie Gard issue which is another issue of the government's control over life and today we had in the District of Columbia a passing in that local jurisdiction of assisted suicide which again is a slippery slope towards euthanasia that will eventually become something that death panels enact when we turn over our health care in total to the government and that's the path on which we're headed right now.
[00:24:17.034 --> 00:24:19.236]  And where is informed consent in that path?
[00:24:19.616 --> 00:24:23.539]  Where is the universal right to control your own life and your own health?
[00:24:23.979 --> 00:24:25.520]  It seems to be disappearing rapidly.
[00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:32.165]  It is disappearing rapidly and in this article you've got privatizing tyranny, liberty and the crony corporate state.
[00:24:32.545 --> 00:24:39.971]  You start talking about California and their mandatory vaccine law where they said if you're not going to use our vaccination schedule
[00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:47.415]  Get all the vaccines we tell you in the time frame in which we tell you, then you're not going to be allowed to use our government schools to one extent.
[00:24:47.455 --> 00:24:48.556]  That's kind of a good thing.
[00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:58.021]  It's maybe an unintended benefit for people not to have their kids in the government propaganda re-education centers, but they're going to use that to withhold health care.
[00:24:58.281 --> 00:24:59.322]  We know that's going to be the case.
[00:24:59.422 --> 00:24:59.922]  Exactly.
[00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:11.822]  And you know, California, Governor Jerry Brown's shirt, used to be Governor Moonbeam back in his first incarnation as governor, but now the velvet glove is off, the iron fist is shown, and what does he say to people?
[00:25:11.862 --> 00:25:26.967]  He says, your California state constitution guarantees to each child a so-called free public education, and international law guarantees to every human being the right of informed consent, and we have a right and a privilege that are clashing.
[00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:41.098]  And what they're trying to do is offer people what is called in our jurisprudence an unconstitutional choice or an unconstitutional condition where they condition a government benefit on the surrender of a right.
[00:25:41.578 --> 00:25:42.379]  That's illegal.
[00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:46.302]  The courts in our country have ruled that illegal over and over again.
[00:25:46.322 --> 00:25:55.650]  And so I believe that California's SB 277 is quite unlawful and it will eventually be overturned by courts or by public opinion.
[00:25:56.115 --> 00:26:06.148]  I think we would look at this law in California, forcing people to take vaccines, and then combine that with what's happening with Charlie Gard in the UK, where they are withholding treatment from him.
[00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:11.710]  The bottom line is that they see you as their possessions, okay?
[00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.991]  As their cattle, if you will.
[00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:13.451]  Exactly.
[00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:21.175]  And they will put into you what they wish, and they will withhold from you what they wish, and of course that spectrum goes through the FDA and through the DEA.
[00:26:21.295 --> 00:26:32.400]  It's both drug prohibition, and it's also the FDA, because when we look at Charlie Gard and we have this offer of free, or an offer of medical care for this experimental treatment,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.242]  And perhaps they had to pay for it, but they have a large fund that they have crowdsourced there.
[00:26:37.282 --> 00:26:42.524]  But nevertheless, when they wanted to extend that offer, they said, we're going to have to get the FDA's approval.
[00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:44.204]  And yet, this is a terminal patient.
[00:26:44.244 --> 00:26:44.864]  Talk about that.
[00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:45.645]  Indeed.
[00:26:45.965 --> 00:26:53.748]  Well, unfortunately, there is some case law from 20 or 25 years ago in the laetrile cases where terminally ill people went to court and said,
[00:26:55.129 --> 00:26:59.438]  Your medicine says we're terminally ill and nothing that doctors can do will save us.
[00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:02.765]  So why are you trying to stop us from using natural alternatives?
[00:27:03.426 --> 00:27:05.170]  And the courts held that even though...
[00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.052]  People had no expectation of survival.
[00:27:09.332 --> 00:27:26.256]  Nonetheless, the government's interest in maintaining its control over the health system was sufficient that the individual should not be allowed to have access, in this case, to a natural form of chemotherapy, Laetrile or Vitamin B17, as it's sometimes called.
[00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:28.477]  So we have some bad laws on the books.
[00:27:28.677 --> 00:27:29.657]  We have some good laws, too.
[00:27:30.197 --> 00:27:49.057]  Just as recently as 2013, in the case of McNeely v. Missouri, the Supreme Court said in a case about sticking a needle into someone's arm, they said, we have always, we have never retreated from our position that you have a privacy interest in preventing an agent of the government from piercing the skin.
[00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:55.853]  And of course, in that case, McNeely refused to consent to an alcohol blood test.
[00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:56.213]  Yes.
[00:27:56.373 --> 00:27:58.235]  Well, they have that all the time here in Texas.
[00:27:58.275 --> 00:28:00.056]  They're not enforcing that law here in Texas.
[00:28:00.096 --> 00:28:04.039]  They have mandatory blood draws at their drug driving stops.
[00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.860]  Not without informed consent.
[00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:12.605]  Or, and this is what the case says, a particularized order from a specific judge about that person.
[00:28:13.846 --> 00:28:24.516]  And in McNeely's case, the court said the officer could have called a judge on the phone and had an order within minutes and chose not to do that despite the refusal to consent.
[00:28:24.857 --> 00:28:27.800]  So again, informed consent is what links all of this together.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.685]  And the privatization of tyranny is an attempt to get around our right of informed consent.
[00:28:33.986 --> 00:28:34.867]  And so back in 2009,
[00:28:36.488 --> 00:28:39.971]  During the swine flu pandemic, the swine flu panic.
[00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:41.652]  It never was a pandemic.
[00:28:41.712 --> 00:28:42.333]  It was a panic.
[00:28:42.453 --> 00:28:47.437]  Nobody ever took the vaccines and therefore the pandemic was not triggered.
[00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:49.979]  It's the vaccine that triggers the pandemic.
[00:28:50.699 --> 00:28:57.085]  What happened was the people in the millions refused vaccines and the government attempted
[00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:05.994]  Through mandating in an indirect way, the CDC recommended this untested vaccine.
[00:29:06.294 --> 00:29:12.341]  It said, you know, through one side of its mouth, this is just a change of strain and so we don't have to test it for safety.
[00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:16.805]  And through the other side of his mouth, it said, this is a new and dangerous virus, which could be pandemic.
[00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:32.176]  Instead, they attempted to get the nursing colleges, the hospitals, the schools, lots of private institutions and lots of local government institutions to impose the mandates for them.
[00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:36.939]  I was involved in some of the court cases that stopped that and stopped the vaccination.
[00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:37.759]  The U.S.
[00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:43.863]  government had bought $6 billion worth of untested, unsafety tested flu vaccines.
[00:29:43.923 --> 00:29:45.645]  They wanted everybody to have them.
[00:29:46.866 --> 00:29:56.134]  Then-Secretary of HHS Sebelius said in testifying before Congress, everyone will be vaccinated, starting with the volunteers.
[00:29:56.935 --> 00:29:57.095]  Oh?
[00:29:57.815 --> 00:29:59.377]  And we don't have enough.
[00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:04.141]  Even $6 billion worth of this junk wasn't enough, and they were going to have to spread the supply.
[00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:07.945]  And so the government bought a half a billion dollars worth of squalene.
[00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:13.069]  Now, squalene, when you put it on your skin, is actually a good part of cosmetics.
[00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.411]  And squalene, when it's ingested, is a food.
[00:30:15.872 --> 00:30:28.323]  But squalene, when it's injected into the human body, or any mammal's body, is part of something called Freund's Final Solution, which is a material that's used in laboratories to sacrifice lab animals.
[00:30:28.804 --> 00:30:32.467]  It causes irreversible infertility, and it can cause death.
[00:30:32.867 --> 00:30:34.349]  This was going to be admixed
[00:30:35.049 --> 00:30:51.153]  With the vaccines in 90,000 locations around the country, in grammar school cafeterias, in town hall basements, wherever, not pharmaceutical facilities, and they were going to be mixing the vaccine and the adjuvant, and then they were going to be giving this to people.
[00:30:51.633 --> 00:30:55.234]  Well, as I said, the American population refused to take the vaccines.
[00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:58.215]  In Boston, the home city of forced vaccination,
[00:30:59.835 --> 00:31:07.141]  They had 50,000 doses and they said, you may have to line up a day in advance to get your dose because there's a half a million people.
[00:31:08.462 --> 00:31:12.385]  500 people showed up for the vaccine in a city of half a million.
[00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:12.805]  Yeah.
[00:31:13.285 --> 00:31:18.349]  So still Americans are still resisting this type of control.
[00:31:18.369 --> 00:31:21.291]  And it's not just down to informed consent.
[00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:21.812]  You got it.
[00:31:21.852 --> 00:31:28.577]  People need to know what is it that we keep telling people, look at the label on your vaccines, see what else is in there.
[00:31:28.877 --> 00:31:38.359]  That they're not telling you about things like you're talking about with squalene or mercury or other issues that are there and they're the adjuvants that they put in they say to irritate your immune system to make it more effective.
[00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:45.521]  That is one issue but we'd look at it and of course clearly there's a profit motive here with big pharma.
[00:31:45.981 --> 00:31:49.602]  There is a control motivation with the government.
[00:31:50.402 --> 00:31:53.944]  And then of course now we've got the insurance companies involved now with Obamacare.
[00:31:54.084 --> 00:32:01.809]  Just a couple of days ago we had an op-ed piece from Rand Paul saying the health care bill is a giant bailout super fund for insurance companies.
[00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:07.232]  He said we're not going to have taxpayer money subsidizing this 15 billion dollar industry.
[00:32:07.552 --> 00:32:11.974]  And if they're making 15 billion dollars out of this, will they kill you for that?
[00:32:12.075 --> 00:32:13.655]  You bet they will kill you for that.
[00:32:13.976 --> 00:32:16.017]  People have killed for far less than that.
[00:32:16.497 --> 00:32:18.418]  You know, it's called the Liverpool Pathway.
[00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:24.422]  The insurance industry and the hospitals have managed the passing of the greatest generation.
[00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:33.828]  At one point, a couple of years ago, there were several hundred World War II vets dying every week, and it was the same pathway, and it was mediated through
[00:32:34.648 --> 00:32:35.809]  Privatized tyranny.
[00:32:36.069 --> 00:32:44.193]  And what happened is, you would be told, my father, my uncles, the family was told, there's nothing more we can do.
[00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:48.935]  Do you want to ship your loved one to a hospice, or do you want an in-home hospice?
[00:32:49.456 --> 00:33:01.182]  And everyone chooses in-home hospice, and the hospital bed is brought in, the patient is brought in, the nurse comes in and says, if you think your loved one is uncomfortable, let me know and I'll give him a morphine patch immediately.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.

[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:54.728]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.008 --> 00:37:01.312]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:12.139]  Our founding fathers said that the federal government was to be limited in power regarding land use within the states.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.943]  And that the states themselves should have say over how land was used.
[00:37:18.503 --> 00:37:21.005]  This is crystal clear in the Federalist Papers.
[00:37:22.057 --> 00:37:32.703]  Over time, as if in slow motion, our enumerated constitutional rights have been eroded to the point of being unrecognizable.
[00:37:33.924 --> 00:37:40.968]  Militarized federal agencies are destroying families, livelihoods, and children's future.
[00:37:41.408 --> 00:37:49.493]  When the people legitimately gather to redress grievances, the federal mercenaries shoot to kill.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:38:01.366]  We have allowed our public servants to become predators willing to kill and destroy to maintain their iron grip on power.
[00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:14.615]  Here we have the BLM, the EPA, the FBI, threatening death, stealing land by fiat, slaughtering livestock, and laughing in our face about it.
[00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:22.453]  We have allowed our public servants to become modern-day robbers.
[00:38:23.374 --> 00:38:36.244]  It is a slippery slope when we jail journalists for revealing the corruption and the unconstitutional actions and the illegal actions of an oppressive federal government.
[00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:40.747]  Yes, the people are being abused.
[00:38:41.748 --> 00:38:43.129]  Land is being stolen.
[00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:45.091]  They've been physically trampled.
[00:38:45.942 --> 00:38:54.305]  And in the case of LaVoy Finicum, we know that they are murdered in cold blood by a guilty federal government.
[00:38:57.446 --> 00:39:11.511]  The wildlife refuge standoff could have been prevented if the FBI had not intervened in the republic form of government where the people petition their representatives with grievances to be addressed.
[00:39:12.256 --> 00:39:21.019]  Instead, they accelerated a cycle of violence that brought only death and dishonor to them and our country.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:30.323]  I think it was John Kennedy who said, those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:39:33.749 --> 00:39:43.472]  While the men of the Bundy clan and their supporters rot in prison, federal agencies have not given up trying to take everything from us.
[00:39:44.793 --> 00:39:53.036]  These men stood up for their God-given rights and the rights of their neighbors, and now we must stand up for them.
[00:39:53.056 --> 00:40:00.218]  Even more egregious than the abuse of the Bundys are the actions of the federal government in the wake of that standoff.
[00:40:02.196 --> 00:40:03.657]  The actions of U.S.
[00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:09.000]  District Court Gloria Navarro are a disgrace for the judiciary.
[00:40:11.781 --> 00:40:21.966]  The judge presided over the retrial of four defendants charged with various crimes stemming from their participation in the Bunkerville standoff.
[00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:27.229]  Now, the first trial ended with a deadlocked jury.
[00:40:28.561 --> 00:40:37.511]  The judge has now eviscerated the defense's legal strategy, putting off limits a whole host of issues which could be used in their defense.
[00:40:37.792 --> 00:40:40.114]  They cannot argue the First Amendment.
[00:40:40.334 --> 00:40:42.877]  They cannot argue the Second Amendment.
[00:40:43.278 --> 00:40:46.401]  She strips them of any fair trial and
[00:40:47.863 --> 00:41:00.971]  17 men, 18 men are held without pre-trial release when in this jurisdiction, thanks to her husband, people indicted for murder are allowed out on pre-trial release.
[00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:06.254]  These men have been denied due process guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:41:06.314 --> 00:41:07.015]  Constitution.
[00:41:13.823 --> 00:41:25.655]  They are not allowed in their defense to review the actions of the BLM leading up to this incident or to mention the federal mistakes such as the First Amendment zone created for protesters.
[00:41:26.096 --> 00:41:30.100]  They are not allowed to mount any reasonable defense.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.924]  Cliven Bundy is not allowed to choose his own lawyer.
[00:41:35.717 --> 00:41:46.601]  This is the oppressive hand of a military, jack-booted government that has lost all sense of reality of law, morality, or the U.S.
[00:41:46.681 --> 00:41:51.882]  Constitution.
[00:41:51.902 --> 00:41:54.623]  Why must they rig the trial, you ask?
[00:41:54.683 --> 00:41:57.964]  Because they fear jury nullification.
[00:41:58.044 --> 00:42:02.526]  They fear a jury that will free the Bundy family and
[00:42:03.223 --> 00:42:04.084]  Their supporters.
[00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:09.608]  Now, there is, in my opinion, a solution to this problem.
[00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:16.033]  We have seen the overreach of an oppressive federal government.
[00:42:16.593 --> 00:42:22.758]  We have seen the jack-booted mentality of a militarized federal bureaucracy.
[00:42:23.939 --> 00:42:30.664]  But the Bundys were assured by the local sheriff that the feds were standing down, being led to the slaughter.
[00:42:31.789 --> 00:42:33.211]  And then we have U.S.
[00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:49.168]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions come to town and comment on a trial in front of the courts saying that he backs the prosecution, tainting the trial and giving us the reason why this case should be booted out of court now.
[00:42:52.034 --> 00:43:01.077]  Mr. Attorney General, perhaps you don't recall when President Nixon said in an interview during his trial that Charles Manson was guilty.
[00:43:01.137 --> 00:43:08.340]  Why, the liberals in the mainstream media went crazy that Nixon was denying Manson his due process.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.221]  Where are those voices today?
[00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:24.200]  Last night, as I sat with kindred souls and we talked about a solution, one man said the real solution is simple.
[00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:32.085]  We take a carefully selected group of 300 to 500 armed men to the federal courthouse.
[00:43:32.686 --> 00:43:35.747]  My friends, that is not the answer.
[00:43:36.248 --> 00:43:38.369]  Violence is not the answer.
[00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.871]  More bloodshed is not the answer.
[00:43:41.291 --> 00:43:44.493]  More gunplay is not the answer.
[00:43:46.301 --> 00:43:52.563]  I have known Donald Trump, the President of the United States, for 40 years.
[00:43:55.104 --> 00:43:56.965]  He is a just man.
[00:43:57.545 --> 00:43:59.205]  He is a decent man.
[00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:01.546]  He is an honest man.
[00:44:01.886 --> 00:44:03.847]  He is a compassionate man.
[00:44:04.227 --> 00:44:06.468]  He is a believer in the U.S.
[00:44:06.528 --> 00:44:07.468]  Constitution.
[00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:15.571]  He answers only to the American people, not to the two-party duopoly that has run this country into the ground.
[00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:27.071]  And therefore, I appeal to the President.
[00:44:28.112 --> 00:44:29.253]  Review this case.
[00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:31.774]  In the name of justice.
[00:44:32.595 --> 00:44:34.056]  In the name of mercy.
[00:44:34.656 --> 00:44:36.337]  In the name of fairness.
[00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:42.361]  Pardon every member of the Bundy family and their supporters and do it now!
[00:44:45.441 --> 00:44:59.177]  We will be posting a petition at InfoWars.com and at StoneColdTruth.com to the President, urging him to review this case, and in the act of mercy and justice, pardon these patriots.
[00:44:59.978 --> 00:45:01.600]  Let's be clear.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.541]  We will not be silenced.
[00:45:05.941 --> 00:45:07.762]  We will not be intimidated.
[00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.103]  We will not be censored.
[00:45:10.403 --> 00:45:14.084]  We will not go away and we will not shut up.
[00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:17.706]  We are in this fight to the end.
[00:45:20.447 --> 00:45:22.808]  Now, we know
[00:45:23.755 --> 00:45:36.868]  That the illegal, unconstitutional, and outrageous actions of Judge Navarro, a vestige on the bench given to us by Harry Reid, the single most corrupt man in American political history,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:48.085]  Who as a casino control commission was known as Paper Bag Harry because if you gave him cash in a brown paper bag, you could get whatever you wanted.
[00:45:48.465 --> 00:45:55.749]  This piece of human excrement posing as a human being is a disgrace to his state and his country.
[00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.953]  Judge Navarro does his dirty work today.
[00:46:08.954 --> 00:46:15.480]  That her husband is a prosecutor is another reason why this case has been tainted.
[00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:25.910]  Now, I have little question that a legitimate case could be made to overturn convictions of the Bundy men and their supporters in a kangaroo court.
[00:46:26.414 --> 00:46:29.780]  But it would go to the Ninth Circuit, one of the most liberal circuits in the country.
[00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:33.165]  And then, could we lose in the Ninth Circuit?
[00:46:33.546 --> 00:46:38.814]  It would be up to the United States Supreme Court as to whether or not they'd hear this case.
[00:46:39.787 --> 00:46:47.471]  The problem with that path is many of these brave patriots will die in jail waiting for justice.
[00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:48.331]  No.
[00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.392]  Mr. President, hear our cries.
[00:46:51.772 --> 00:46:55.614]  Pardon the Bundy family and their supporters today.
[00:46:56.074 --> 00:46:58.175]  God bless you and God bless America.
[00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:07.740]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:34.053]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.193 --> 00:48:37.338]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.378 --> 00:48:38.640]  It's a key building block of the body.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:45.651]  And if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.492]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.075]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.095 --> 00:48:59.955]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:00.015]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.837 --> 00:49:16.266]  Well, the feminists have gone absolutely crazy and they are attacking women like Dana Lesh, even though she is the embodiment of what feminists actually want women to be.
[00:49:16.767 --> 00:49:23.813]  I'm now joined by Leanne McAdoo to talk about this wild craze called third or fourth wave feminism, whatever you want to call it.
[00:49:24.414 --> 00:49:29.359]  And I've got a couple stories I want to get to with Leanne, but why aren't you part of this feminist movement?
[00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:30.060]  I don't understand.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.660]  You're a woman.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.261]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:32.409 --> 00:49:33.349]  It embarrasses me.
[00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:40.493]  I actually identified as a feminist for my entire life, essentially, but it has descended into chaos.
[00:49:41.113 --> 00:49:51.438]  And the people who have grabbed on to what it means to be a feminist are people who are fighting to make the main character of Doctor Who a trans person.
[00:49:51.458 --> 00:49:53.479]  It's not good enough that she can be a woman.
[00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:58.061]  No, she has to be someone in this obscure gender orientation.
[00:49:59.282 --> 00:50:06.927]  Yeah, all the feminists that I see don't embody a woman at all, to be perfectly honest with you, but that's a completely different point.
[00:50:07.388 --> 00:50:09.930]  But yeah, you're talking about how they want to make a big deal.
[00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.391]  It's a character on television.
[00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:12.752]  First of all, why do we even care?
[00:50:13.112 --> 00:50:23.400]  It just shows how these people are obsessed with pop culture, obsessed with identity, obsessed with the merger of the two and creating a PC world where everybody can be accepted, everybody's part of it.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:29.426]  And there's been a lot of ad campaigns that are trying to target this market right now, which is actually a very small market.
[00:50:29.466 --> 00:50:30.767]  These are failing ad campaigns.
[00:50:31.147 --> 00:50:33.430]  And I wanted to play one that I saw and get your thoughts on it.
[00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.132]  This is a Bianco footwear ad.
[00:50:36.192 --> 00:50:37.834]  Go ahead and roll this footwear ad, guys.
[00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:42.379]  You got all these women.
[00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:43.980]  It's so rough on these women.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.482]  That's what they're trying to portray right now.
[00:50:45.682 --> 00:50:46.623]  Listen up.
[00:50:47.659 --> 00:50:50.360]  There's still not equal pay for equal work anywhere in the world.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:50.480]  Oh, no.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.161]  There's no equal pay for women out there.
[00:50:52.181 --> 00:50:54.261]  And it seems most women are not even angry about it.
[00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:55.102]  And they're not even mad.
[00:50:55.142 --> 00:50:55.822]  You need to be mad!
[00:50:55.842 --> 00:50:56.502]  But we should be.
[00:50:56.942 --> 00:50:57.743]  You should be angry!
[00:50:57.763 --> 00:51:00.464]  I'm telling you to be angry if you're a woman.
[00:51:00.664 --> 00:51:01.664]  Get angry, Leanne!
[00:51:01.824 --> 00:51:05.145]  From now on, equal pay is no longer an issue.
[00:51:05.205 --> 00:51:06.526]  Leanne, get angry!
[00:51:06.766 --> 00:51:10.127]  Because women... Because I always get erased by... Our haircuts.
[00:51:10.187 --> 00:51:12.348]  Yeah, by stomping on the desk like a child.
[00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:16.086]  See, this is the part that's amazing to me.
[00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:19.707]  They're complaining about how their lifestyle is more expensive.
[00:51:20.047 --> 00:51:21.107]  How is that my fault?
[00:51:21.167 --> 00:51:23.628]  Yeah, here we go.
[00:51:23.688 --> 00:51:24.649]  Encouraging violence.
[00:51:24.669 --> 00:51:26.809]  Yeah, go smash cars like a child.
[00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.392]  Look at the lucky man who doesn't buy a new pair of clothes every day.
[00:51:33.652 --> 00:51:35.452]  Look at the lucky man.
[00:51:35.772 --> 00:51:36.693]  I have too many shoes.
[00:51:38.152 --> 00:51:40.133]  Don't tell me about having not a shoe problem.
[00:51:40.153 --> 00:51:43.315]  I got too many shoes.
[00:51:43.615 --> 00:51:46.576]  So this is a Bianco footwear ad.
[00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:50.398]  Just totally... Equal pay.
[00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:54.180]  I'm sorry, did I just watch a footwear ad or a piece of propaganda?
[00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:57.121]  Well, I think we both know.
[00:51:58.962 --> 00:52:01.944]  So I just see this video and I just see this... Look at that.
[00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:06.331]  I smashed a coffee mug on my boss's face.
[00:52:06.391 --> 00:52:08.032]  I got a raise, said no one ever.
[00:52:08.052 --> 00:52:13.016]  Okay, so anyway, so there's that there's that propaganda.
[00:52:13.036 --> 00:52:16.318]  That is giving a whole new meaning to smash the patriarchy.
[00:52:16.338 --> 00:52:18.980]  I mean, what do you think about that propaganda, Leigh-Anne?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.821]  I mean, they are lying to young women out there.
[00:52:21.613 --> 00:52:31.139]  Well, they are targeted advertising to women, selling them expensive footwear by complaining about how women have to pay for so much expensive stuff.
[00:52:31.379 --> 00:52:32.240]  Exactly!
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.160]  Crazy!
[00:52:34.261 --> 00:52:35.622]  Why do women have to spend more?
[00:52:35.722 --> 00:52:44.327]  Because advertisers have been targeting women forever, telling us how we need all of their products in order to be real women, in order to be stylish.
[00:52:44.608 --> 00:52:49.751]  Now we can only smash the patriarchy if we get in this bionic footwear or whatever it's called.
[00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:51.453]  So wait a second, buy?
[00:52:51.553 --> 00:53:07.392]  Hold on, here's an advertisement telling you to buy this expensive clothing, buy these expensive shoes, pay exorbitant prices, and then we're also sitting here saying, but it's men's fault that you have to pay more and you have an expensive lifestyle.
[00:53:07.873 --> 00:53:09.355]  What a load of bull!
[00:53:11.377 --> 00:53:15.042]  Yeah, it's complete madness now.
[00:53:15.102 --> 00:53:17.285]  Keep your politics off my shoes!
[00:53:17.425 --> 00:53:18.507]  I'm so sorry, Leigh-Anne.
[00:53:18.547 --> 00:53:24.475]  I'm so sorry that you have to pay more because you want to wear nice clothing and have earrings and that you pierced your ears and I didn't.
[00:53:24.655 --> 00:53:25.075]  You know what?
[00:53:26.457 --> 00:53:29.041]  That's male privilege that most men don't pierce their ears, don't you think?
[00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:45.147]  Well the thing that's funny is that now you see it's starting to turn and advertisers are targeting men and men are having to step up and decide which kind of deodorant to use or hair products or hair gel or so you're starting to see so now yeah how is it gonna eat and why don't
[00:53:45.908 --> 00:53:57.242]  Why don't they actually try to educate the women that they say they care about so much about the fallacies with this gender pay gap and explain to people how that actually comes about, how they actually get that figure.
[00:53:57.562 --> 00:53:59.144]  They never really break that down for women.
[00:53:59.164 --> 00:54:01.227]  They just continue to perpetuate this myth.
[00:54:02.324 --> 00:54:04.565]  Yeah, it's just like anything else.
[00:54:04.585 --> 00:54:11.367]  They just have their hearsay argument that they just, you know, put out there because they heard it and they don't actually have anything to back it up.
[00:54:11.407 --> 00:54:13.947]  We see that time and time again when you try to debate with these people.
[00:54:14.248 --> 00:54:18.809]  But honestly, more than anything, it just saddens me that young women see this.
[00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:24.074]  They idolize people like Kim Kardashian and they just have such a messed up view of the world.
[00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.095]  They end up hating men.
[00:54:25.135 --> 00:54:26.116]  They end up hating themselves.
[00:54:26.136 --> 00:54:29.919]  They end up going into this fake cult of feminism that's not even real feminism.
[00:54:29.959 --> 00:54:33.463]  It's really just hating everything and trying to drag everybody down with you.
[00:54:33.783 --> 00:54:36.606]  It's really just sad for me to see this attack on young women.
[00:54:37.813 --> 00:54:54.306]  Right, well I actually was reading an article yesterday that was scoffing at the fact that there was some survey saying that men are attracted to women because if they're, look like they're more fertile, that they're going to be better mothers and like this is, this goes way back to the caveman days.
[00:54:54.326 --> 00:54:59.711]  Yeah, that is like taught in mainline biology, mainline psychology, that's like just innate.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.661]  It's offensive for you to be attracted to an hourglass figure.
[00:55:04.221 --> 00:55:06.742]  And it just reinforces the patriarchy.
[00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:07.963]  So yeah, so then what are they going to do?
[00:55:07.983 --> 00:55:12.724]  So then they're going to have to literally beat our biology out of us.
[00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:21.227]  I mean, that's what they're... This is psychological warfare to completely end gender norms or just gender in general.
[00:55:21.668 --> 00:55:24.829]  But here's the thing, though, that's crazy to me, Leigh-Anne, and this is a story from the Washington Post.
[00:55:25.629 --> 00:55:28.110]  It's the obsession that these people have with identity.
[00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.291]  And I just want to read this excerpt and then get your comments.
[00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:32.353]  This is from Christine Phillips at the Washington Post.
[00:55:32.713 --> 00:55:36.134]  Why these professors are warning against promoting the work of straight white men.
[00:55:36.475 --> 00:55:39.836]  Excuse me, this is the Washington Compost.
[00:55:40.157 --> 00:55:41.997]  Excuse me, this is the Amazon Post.
[00:55:42.498 --> 00:55:54.264]  Academics and scholars must be mindful about using research done by only straight white men, according to two scientists who argue that it oppresses diverse voices and bolsters the status of already privileged and established white male scholars.
[00:55:54.884 --> 00:56:08.765]  Geographers Kerry Mott and Daniel Cockane, Cockane, the guy's actual name is Cockane, argued in a recent paper that doing so also perpetuates what they call, here you go, white hetero-masculinism.
[00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:11.334]  White heteromasculinism.
[00:56:11.354 --> 00:56:24.625]  They were able to scientifically produce that word, which they defined as a system of oppression that benefits only those who are white, male, able-bodied, economically privileged, heterosexual, and cisgendered.
[00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:25.966]  There is your cisgender.
[00:56:25.986 --> 00:56:31.010]  That's Mott, a professor at Rutgers University and Cochrane at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.
[00:56:32.151 --> 00:56:36.134]  So there's their scientific new term, heteromasculinism, Leanne.
[00:56:37.472 --> 00:56:43.917]  Wow, so they're basically saying that no other race out there, males of any other race, are into masculinity.
[00:56:44.697 --> 00:56:46.959]  So the patriarchy is just the old white guys.
[00:56:47.259 --> 00:56:47.579]  Got it.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.582]  And also I thought it was cisgender, cisnormative.
[00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:55.565]  Is this what they- Well I'm just reading from the article here, okay?
[00:56:55.665 --> 00:57:01.509]  I don't have the original formulas, I don't have the chalkboard where they actually orchestrated all of this, you know, out on the thing.
[00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:04.251]  But yes, it says cisgendered on here.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:13.949]  This is how they ensure that that useless degree they have can be put to some use, is they have to continually redefine culture and biology.
[00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:16.892]  And this is, of course, the party of science.
[00:57:17.293 --> 00:57:22.979]  I know that I'm beating a cliché here, and I don't even care, that's the thing, and I know you probably don't care either, but...
[00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:25.920]  Imagine if this was the opposite.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:35.445]  Imagine if I went to, say, an all-black university in the South, and I was like, you're teaching too much black culture, you're teaching too much black history.
[00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:37.366]  There would be outrage, and rightfully so!
[00:57:37.427 --> 00:57:39.328]  Who am I to tell them what they can or cannot teach?
[00:57:39.688 --> 00:57:45.451]  These people are just obsessed with identity, obsessed with their view of the world, and can't even handle anybody else's.
[00:57:47.128 --> 00:57:51.892]  Well, let's go back to where you were talking about them trying to beat our biology out of us.
[00:57:52.272 --> 00:57:55.034]  Reebok did the exact same thing where they went to go political.
[00:57:55.135 --> 00:58:01.360]  They are fighting back against Trump, who dared to compliment the French president's wife by saying she was in great shape.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.066]  And they actually came out with a little breakdown of when you're allowed to compliment a woman, and they give you this whole graphic.
[00:58:09.506 --> 00:58:21.770]  Basically, there is no time at all when you're ever allowed to compliment a woman unless you find an action figure that you found from your youth and then you can pick it up and say, oh, this is in good shape.
[00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.270]  Yes.
[00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.371]  They have outlawed complimenting women.
[00:58:24.391 --> 00:58:24.691]  Wait, hold on.
[00:58:24.711 --> 00:58:24.951]  Hold on, guys.
[00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:25.371]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:58:25.411 --> 00:58:26.251]  Put that back up.
[00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:27.112]  Put that back up.
[00:58:27.172 --> 00:58:28.452]  I was going to compliment you, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:28.492 --> 00:58:28.812]  Hold on.
[00:58:28.832 --> 00:58:29.272]  Let me see it.
[00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:31.373]  Oh, no, I can't.
[00:58:31.473 --> 00:58:31.773]  I can't.
[00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:33.934]  According to Reebok, I can't compliment you.
[00:58:33.974 --> 00:58:34.274]  Sorry.
[00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:35.721]  Sorry.
[00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:39.763]  But then you look at their advertisements, it's all about objectifying women.
[00:58:40.003 --> 00:58:41.643]  This is where we've gotten to.
[00:58:41.783 --> 00:58:44.244]  Massive hypocrisy here with this virtue signaling.
[00:58:44.304 --> 00:58:47.045]  It has now seeped into our corporations.
[00:58:47.265 --> 00:58:48.826]  And it's a total... I'm sick and tired of it.
[00:58:48.846 --> 00:58:51.147]  And it's just a total double standard.
[00:58:51.187 --> 00:58:52.967]  Thank you so much, Leanne McAdoo.
[00:58:53.087 --> 00:58:56.669]  Not falling into the cult of fake feminism.
[00:58:56.709 --> 00:58:57.169]  Thank God.
