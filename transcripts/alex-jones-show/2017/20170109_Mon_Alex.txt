[00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:26.786]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:29.570]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.034]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January the 10th, 2017.
[00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:41.816]  We're ten days away.
[00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:42.657]  That's what I was thinking of.
[00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:44.719]  Ten days away from Trump's inauguration.
[00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.701]  And of course, Davos is going to be meeting about the same time.
[00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.843]  We're going to talk about the collapse of globalism.
[00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.044]  It's pretty evident.
[00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:59.089]  We've already had a bill introduced again in the House to get the United States out of the UN and the UN out of the United States.
[00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.330]  We're going to talk about what that would look like.
[00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.731]  We're going to talk about the details of that bill.
[00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:03.532]  We're going to talk about
[00:01:03.952 --> 00:01:08.114]  How that could actually happen under a Donald Trump and they're scared to death of it.
[00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:11.775]  We're also going to talk about some of the things that Donald Trump is going to do on day one.
[00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:15.796]  CNN has a headline, how the tables are turning on Obamacare.
[00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:24.540]  You know, they said Republicans warned seven years ago that this was going to be reckless and arrogant to establish Obamacare on a party line vote.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.381]  And then CNN says now the GOP is in charge and about to run afoul of its own warnings.
[00:01:29.462 --> 00:01:30.642]  No, they're not.
[00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:39.185]  Recklessly and arrogantly, they're going to overturn the arrogance and the recklessness that the Democrats used to put in Obamacare.
[00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.325]  That's what's going to be coming up.
[00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:47.467]  And of course, we're going to talk in the next segment about Meryl Streep, the Golden Globes, and the big kerfuffle that's going on.
[00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:56.288]  But there's a lot that's, I think, very interesting in the hypocrisy of Hollywood that is ripe to be plucked out.
[00:01:56.328 --> 00:01:58.929]  There she is right there talking about making her speech.
[00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.730]  We're going to talk about Meryl Streep.
[00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.150]  We're going to talk about the Golden Globes.
[00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.631]  We're going to talk about Hollywood in general.
[00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.252]  We're also going to talk about climate change.
[00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:17.217]  We now have fish and wildlife coming out and pushing this absurd climate change narrative, saying, wave goodbye to the polar bears if we don't do something about climate change.
[00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:19.078]  And you know, I've done multiple reports.
[00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:25.821]  I created a graphic once that had a polar bear standing on an ice floe and I animated his arm, you know, wave goodbye.
[00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:27.703]  That's what they're telling me.
[00:02:27.923 --> 00:02:30.466]  They're still floating that lie.
[00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:31.928]  No pun intended.
[00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.434]  Meanwhile, Venice is talking about how their canals are drying up.
[00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:39.678]  Wasn't Venice supposed to be completely gone underwater?
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.546]  Aren't we supposed to see that?
[00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:45.708]  And we're going to take a look at some of the real data that's going on here.
[00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:52.550]  We're also going to look at a Georgia tech scientist who said, I can't take the political science anymore.
[00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:53.231]  I'm getting out.
[00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.731]  She was on climate change field.
[00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.152]  We're going to talk about all that as well.
[00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.213]  We're going to take a look at the phony narrative.
[00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.393]  We talked about this some yesterday.
[00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:06.816]  We're going to go back into that a bit more because it's very important that you understand how we are being played by the U.S.
[00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:09.637]  government, by the political establishment, by this
[00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:17.686]  CIA mocking Operation Mockingbird project that is putting this propaganda out there that's created an absurd conspiracy theory.
[00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:24.894]  I gotta say, you know, we look at this and when we question whatever the government says, we're immediately accused of being conspiracy theorists.
[00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:36.158]  Going back to the JFK assassination, you know, they wanted to sell us the idea that there was a lone shooter, in spite of what eyewitnesses said, in spite of what the Zapruder film said, in spite of what people said they heard, and in spite of your common sense.
[00:03:36.178 --> 00:03:39.999]  You know, they came up with the magic bullet thing, but then they said, oh, okay, you think there's multiple people?
[00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.400]  That's a conspiracy and it's a theory.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.081]  Well, that's the way people typically do investigations.
[00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:52.083]  But when they put out nonsense and they keep sticking to it like they are right now, that is a sign that they're up to something.
[00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:58.225]  And of course, as Alex Jones pointed out over the weekend, that something is not just discrediting Donald Trump.
[00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:03.987]  That's a very big objective that they want to do, but it is also about insinuating themselves into the election.
[00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:07.229]  You see, they're not saying that Russia hacked the voting machines.
[00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.631]  But that's what they want you to hear.
[00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:11.993]  And that's what the American public is hearing.
[00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:22.362]  And so, with the public hearing that, with them hearing the big lie, the grand lie, which every propagandist knows, if you want to lie to the public, lie big!
[00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.004]  Because that's going to be the one that's going to be believed.
[00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:25.785]  And then repeat it!
[00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:27.006]  Continually repeat it!
[00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.549]  No matter how absurd, you just double down on that lie.
[00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:31.810]  So we're going to talk about the fact that
[00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:34.870]  The intelligence empire really doesn't have any clothes.
[00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.192]  And their fly is down at the very least, we've got to say.
[00:04:38.232 --> 00:04:39.273]  They need to pull that up.
[00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:41.855]  We've got a couple of articles here that we're going to take a look at.
[00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.396]  Things that have been happening inside the NSA.
[00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:47.258]  Their watchdog chief who retaliated against a whistleblower.
[00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:54.444]  The fact that the Navy has for years known they've been cheated by a guy named Fat Leonard, but they can't do anything about it.
[00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:55.344]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.404 --> 00:04:56.045]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:28.680]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.661]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:38.344]  We could easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:44.727]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:55.401]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.543]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:05:57.563 --> 00:06:02.209]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:08.430]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:17.732]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:06:18.592 --> 00:06:19.713]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:06:20.053 --> 00:06:21.013]  We refuse to do that.
[00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:24.054]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.114]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:26.914]  Exactly.
[00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:27.995]  We're looking for the best.
[00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:32.919]  We went out and searched for the best, the private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.782]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:42.786]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:44.287]  It's everywhere.
[00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:45.148]  It's in nature.
[00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:47.289]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.714]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[00:06:54.875 --> 00:07:00.138]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:07:00.158 --> 00:07:00.819]  This is insane.
[00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:10.005]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:10.905]  People will buy more of it.
[00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:11.606]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:12.166]  Okay.
[00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:13.487]  Compare that to this.
[00:07:13.707 --> 00:07:15.088]  This is a $50 product.
[00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:18.630]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.870]  Okay.
[00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.171]  We have 10,000.
[00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:20.191]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:07:22.773 --> 00:07:24.614]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:07:25.034 --> 00:07:30.277]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[00:07:30.297 --> 00:07:34.159]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:40.543]  When I forget to take the X2, or Supermail, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.282]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:44.442]  It's changed my life.
[00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.783]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:49.003]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:50.864]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:51.764]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:59.727]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:08:00.107 --> 00:08:00.887]  It's a win-win.
[00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:02.148]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:15.949]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.174]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:24.020]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:08:25.407 --> 00:08:30.653]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:34.758]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:36.860]  We have to be good.
[00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.342]  We have to be pure.
[00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:39.203]  We have to be strong.
[00:08:39.544 --> 00:08:40.985]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:43.869]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:50.831]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:59.260]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:06.248]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.125]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:30.826]  Move bitch!
[00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:32.047]  Get out of the way!
[00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.287]  The American flag!
[00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:44.530]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.972]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:49.533]  I will not let you down.
[00:09:49.613 --> 00:09:52.135]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:54.196]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:56.638]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:09:56.678 --> 00:10:02.882]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:04.763]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:05.884]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:11.157]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January the 10th, 2017.
[00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:18.801]  As I said in the first segment, we're just 10 days away from the inauguration and we're looking at the Democrats fighting us all the way.
[00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:24.864]  And of course, we're going to take a quick look here at what happened last night at the Golden Globes because that's just one example of how they operate.
[00:10:25.464 --> 00:10:29.546]  Now we're going to have the Davos party, and that's the way it's put by CNBC.
[00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:33.287]  They say the party at Davos wakes up to a new New World Order.
[00:10:33.347 --> 00:10:36.208]  This is something that you'll find on the Drudge Report today.
[00:10:36.228 --> 00:10:53.575]  And they say that Donald Trump's inauguration as president on January the 20th will overshadow Davos this year, but it's hard to see how every conference, every bilateral meeting, every roundtable won't include some reference to the political upheaval, which conservative news aggregates cite the Drudge Report calls the new
[00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:55.356]  New World Order.
[00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:57.357]  And then they have a quote from The Guardian.
[00:10:57.397 --> 00:10:57.637]  They say,
[00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:14.052]  Who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous.
[00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.435]  That's the power of the celebrities.
[00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:20.582]  That's how they're used as a beard to make these guys look good.
[00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:24.669]  You see, as many people have said before, and I forget the first person who said it,
[00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:28.347]  Politics is show business for ugly people.
[00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:31.450]  But you know, Obama has taken that to a whole new level.
[00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.871]  Because he's really one of them.
[00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.452]  He really is an actor.
[00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:35.633]  Just like them.
[00:11:36.254 --> 00:11:41.178]  You know, he's really awful when he doesn't have somebody writing a script for him and he's not reading from a teleprompter.
[00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:45.101]  And just like them, he had a complete persona that he made.
[00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:47.042]  Complete with a new name.
[00:11:47.142 --> 00:11:49.404]  He's had multiple names, multiple identities.
[00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:50.585]  He's just like these people.
[00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:51.286]  He's a chameleon.
[00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:53.268]  He'll become whatever you want him to become.
[00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:55.049]  Some people woke up to that.
[00:11:55.089 --> 00:12:05.315]  Some of the Democrats who voted for him in 2008 said, well, you know, we just kind of projected on this guy what we wanted, and then we found out that he was something else, because he was just a chameleon.
[00:12:05.335 --> 00:12:07.276]  He's just an actor in the role.
[00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:09.998]  And of course, most of these politicians are.
[00:12:10.018 --> 00:12:15.741]  And so last night we had Meryl Streep, as you saw the B-roll right there, and you can see the article up on InfoWars.
[00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:17.022]  Everybody is talking about it.
[00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:20.244]  Streep's anti-Trump rant is debunked.
[00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:23.066]  We have an article by Steve Watson, the ravings of a Hollywood faker.
[00:12:24.195 --> 00:12:38.742]  And of course, he points out, this is what Meryl Streep said, she said, Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if we kick them all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts, she said.
[00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:43.284]  Well, I think maybe the martial arts people might have a disagreement with her on that.
[00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:48.206]  But when she said this, she said, a couple of people made the joke, they said, where
[00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:50.746]  We're an endangered species here.
[00:12:50.806 --> 00:12:59.232]  This may be the last Golden Globes, because we are the Hollywood Foreign Press, and all three of those things are things that Donald Trump doesn't like.
[00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:01.694]  And that brings up a question.
[00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:04.415]  What is the Golden Globes?
[00:13:04.736 --> 00:13:06.997]  You see, Donald Trump said Meryl Streep is highly overrated.
[00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:08.038]  You know what's really overrated?
[00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.199]  The Golden Globes are overrated.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.083]  The Golden Globes, it is as phony as anything you'll find in Hollyweird.
[00:13:15.888 --> 00:13:18.149]  And there's some pretty phony stuff in Hollyweird.
[00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:21.891]  It started in 1943 by some Hollywood writers.
[00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:22.891]  So it's not foreign.
[00:13:23.912 --> 00:13:25.112]  It's not really the press.
[00:13:25.893 --> 00:13:26.733]  It is Hollywood.
[00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:28.054]  So there you go.
[00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:31.775]  And it's only about 93 people and we don't really know who these people are.
[00:13:32.536 --> 00:13:36.958]  Now, NBC was one of the first networks to start covering the Golden Globes in the late 50s.
[00:13:38.393 --> 00:13:43.995]  And then in 1968, the FCC came out and warned NBC about it.
[00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:45.395]  They said, this is really fraudulent.
[00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:55.358]  You know, we've had the situations where they had the, what is it, the $64,000 question, the big game show scandals, where they had game shows with quizzes and the things were rigged, right?
[00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:58.779]  You know, kind of like Hillary's interviews with the mainstream press.
[00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:01.400]  They rigged the game show questions.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.821]  And so the FCC got very angry about those sorts of things.
[00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:03.981]  And in 1968,
[00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:13.171]  The FCC said to NBC, they said, the Golden Globes has misled the public as to how winners are determined.
[00:14:13.731 --> 00:14:16.752]  They also pointed out that winners were required to show up.
[00:14:17.392 --> 00:14:21.774]  And if they didn't show up, they would hand their award off to somebody else.
[00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:23.735]  The whole thing was a scam.
[00:14:24.115 --> 00:14:29.217]  And it scared NBC so much that they didn't air the Golden Globes for six years.
[00:14:29.897 --> 00:14:31.378]  You see, when you look at the Oscars,
[00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:44.370]  The Oscars are kind of like a high school popularity contest where you have the king and queen of the prom and you got somebody that is nominated for this thing and somebody's nominated for that thing.
[00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.011]  It's a popularity contest, okay?
[00:14:46.412 --> 00:14:47.172]  It doesn't really matter.
[00:14:47.192 --> 00:14:50.174]  It doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film.
[00:14:50.194 --> 00:14:52.656]  It doesn't have anything at all to do with the box office.
[00:14:52.676 --> 00:14:54.958]  As a matter of fact, if it's a really big box office film,
[00:14:55.618 --> 00:14:58.959]  Most of the people in Hollywood get angry and jealous about it, and they vote it down.
[00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:03.620]  So you're not going to see Star Wars getting an Oscar, in most cases, that type of film.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:10.741]  But that's a popularity contest, and it's several thousand people who are in the film business.
[00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:13.642]  But the Golden Globes is just 93 people.
[00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:14.902]  We don't even know who these people are.
[00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:16.242]  So that's the real overrated thing.
[00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:18.663]  You know, I think Meryl Streep is a really fine actress.
[00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:20.243]  I think she's one of the best actresses out there.
[00:15:20.263 --> 00:15:21.683]  So I disagree with Donald Trump on that.
[00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:23.544]  But she's just an actress!
[00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:46.587]  If I have a plumbing problem, and I call a plumber to come fix my leak, and he wants to harangue me about politics, and he knows absolutely nothing about it, he's uninformed, misinformed, and biased and hateful, I'm going to basically tell him, get out, and I'll get somebody else who may not be as good a plumber, but at least they aren't going to stand around and berate me about it.
[00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:49.589]  And you know, we hire these people as entertainers.
[00:15:50.424 --> 00:15:57.528]  And so, Meryl Streep, your job, and you do a really good job at it, is to entertain people, is to become something that you aren't.
[00:15:58.628 --> 00:15:59.709]  And so you ought to stick to that.
[00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:05.612]  Because if you keep haranguing us about that, then we're not going to hire you as an entertainer anymore.
[00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:09.034]  We're not going to buy the tickets to see you in movies, because you do this enough
[00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:15.337]  And then we can't get it in our mind that you're this character that you say that you really are.
[00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:21.180]  All we're going to see is this idiotic, berating actor who knows nothing about what they're talking about.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:31.905]  I want to show you a clip of these Hollywood actors and how they continually come together to try to uplift fellow actor Barack Obama.
[00:16:31.945 --> 00:16:32.825]  Here's an example of it.
[00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:36.087]  Then we're going to show you a parody that was done by Town Hall of this.
[00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:36.787]  It's really funny.
[00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:38.508]  Let's see that clip.
[00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:39.609]  Give you an idea of this.
[00:16:40.882 --> 00:16:42.023]  Dear members of Congress.
[00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:43.344]  Dear members of Congress.
[00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:44.325]  Dear members of Congress.
[00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:45.646]  Dear members of Congress.
[00:16:45.766 --> 00:16:46.467]  I'm mad.
[00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:47.427]  Flabbergasted.
[00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.308]  Furious.
[00:16:48.588 --> 00:16:50.210]  Concerned for my children.
[00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.371]  I'm worried for everyone.
[00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:58.697]  The majority of Americans, regardless of who they voted for, did not vote for racism, for sexism, or for xenophobia.
[00:16:58.877 --> 00:17:00.178]  And yet Donald Trump won.
[00:17:00.518 --> 00:17:03.060]  And since he won... Okay, that's all I can take of that.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.000]  Okay, yeah, you're right.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.522]  We didn't vote for racism, sexism, or xenophobia.
[00:17:06.562 --> 00:17:09.083]  We voted for Donald Trump, and he's none of those things, okay?
[00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:12.866]  That's your projection onto him, but you get the idea.
[00:17:12.926 --> 00:17:15.147]  That's the way they like to put these little things together.
[00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.068]  They all say one word, and then they cut to them, right?
[00:17:17.228 --> 00:17:17.588]  Cut to them.
[00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.830]  That's very powerful, that they don't have to say more than one word.
[00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.272]  And we're just supposed to be impressed by their celebrity status.
[00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:26.654]  Well, here's Town Hall's parody of that.
[00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:29.695]  Dear members of the entertainment community.
[00:17:30.075 --> 00:17:31.055]  Entertainment community.
[00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:32.516]  Entertainment community.
[00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:35.157]  We know that you're more famous than any of us.
[00:17:35.657 --> 00:17:37.477]  Well, most of us.
[00:17:38.598 --> 00:17:39.038]  I'm mad.
[00:17:39.298 --> 00:17:40.018]  Distressed.
[00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:41.079]  Alarmed.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.900]  Infuriated.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.541]  It's your job to be creative.
[00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:48.421]  Creative.
[00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:49.841]  Creative.
[00:17:50.342 --> 00:17:56.804]  And yet, how many of these lame-ass videos have you made that look exactly like this?
[00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:58.430]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.210]  You get the idea.
[00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.551]  It's a great parody.
[00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:01.511]  We're not going to play the whole thing.
[00:18:02.132 --> 00:18:09.756]  Now, Meryl Streep said she was very, very upset because she said Donald Trump was making fun of a physically handicapped individual.
[00:18:09.936 --> 00:18:10.897]  And we're going to play you
[00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:16.266]  A video from Mark Dice that completely debunks that as a hoax.
[00:18:17.127 --> 00:18:19.489]  But first I want to talk about what Kellyanne Conway said.
[00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.091]  She is genius at this.
[00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:32.201]  She said, I didn't hear Mel Streep give a shout out to the mentally challenged boy who was tortured on Facebook and forced to yell, F white people, F Donald Trump.
[00:18:33.228 --> 00:18:34.329]  Streep called Trump a bully.
[00:18:34.349 --> 00:18:36.030]  Well, what about those real bullies?
[00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:38.633]  Meryl Streep was not upset about that, was she?
[00:18:38.673 --> 00:18:38.993]  You know what?
[00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:44.117]  She wasn't upset about the Clinton Foundation corruption and influence peddling.
[00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:46.439]  She wasn't offended by Islamic terror either, was she?
[00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.281]  She didn't seem to have a problem with that.
[00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:49.241]  She didn't speak out about that.
[00:18:49.702 --> 00:18:52.024]  That wasn't the thing out of the last year that really bothered her.
[00:18:52.104 --> 00:18:56.608]  All the Islamic terror throughout the United States and throughout Europe and other places, throughout the Muslim world.
[00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:57.789]  She wasn't concerned about that.
[00:18:58.349 --> 00:19:00.251]  She wasn't concerned about the fact that Hillary Clinton
[00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.133]  Had set Syria and Libya on fire.
[00:19:03.813 --> 00:19:13.620]  And that people like the Aleppo boy are still suffering from the policies of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Kerry, who put regime change over the lives of individuals.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.141]  That didn't bother Meryl Streep.
[00:19:15.501 --> 00:19:16.322]  That didn't bother her at all.
[00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:24.267]  If she wasn't offended when we found out that Planned Parenthood was not only killing babies, but harvesting their body parts and selling that.
[00:19:24.307 --> 00:19:26.749]  That didn't offend Meryl Streep either.
[00:19:27.776 --> 00:19:31.582]  But she was offended by this, and we're going to play you the report.
[00:19:31.602 --> 00:19:33.225]  As I said, we're not going to have time in this segment.
[00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.187]  We'll play it in the next segment.
[00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:35.309]  But also, remember this.
[00:19:35.649 --> 00:19:36.471]  Here's a flashback.
[00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:37.272]  This is from Twitchy.
[00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:39.315]  Roman Polanski.
[00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:46.435]  Who avoided prosecution of the rape of a 13-year-old girl by fleeing the United States in 1978.
[00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.056]  He's been in Poland.
[00:19:48.076 --> 00:19:49.857]  We've tried to extradite him multiple times.
[00:19:50.277 --> 00:19:55.439]  But when he got a ward in 2003, Meryl Streep gave him a standing ovation.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.681]  She wasn't offended by Roman Polanski's pedophile rape.
[00:20:00.522 --> 00:20:03.323]  But she was offended by something that was very phony.
[00:20:03.343 --> 00:20:05.264]  And we're going to show you that video when we come back.
[00:20:05.324 --> 00:20:05.744]  Stay with us.
[00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:06.585]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:14.702 --> 00:20:24.248]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:33.555]  And so I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:20:34.315 --> 00:20:34.956]  And it's simple.
[00:20:35.556 --> 00:20:40.660]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.101]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:44.983]  There's quality versus price.
[00:20:45.023 --> 00:20:46.925]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:20:47.525 --> 00:21:00.495]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:03.944]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:21:04.845 --> 00:21:11.809]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:15.411]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:17.852]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:21:17.892 --> 00:21:21.875]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:23.116]  Well, believe me,
[00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:26.897]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[00:21:27.477 --> 00:21:37.899]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:40.159]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.279]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:49.961]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:53.103]  We went out and did some testing.
[00:21:53.523 --> 00:21:55.865]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:21:55.885 --> 00:22:02.349]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:15.878]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:22:16.238 --> 00:22:21.201]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:22.082]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:23.062]  It's a quarter-inch thick.
[00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.763]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:25.444]  It's waterproof.
[00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:25.904]  You can wear it.
[00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:26.524]  It's comfortable.
[00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:27.385]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:22:27.425 --> 00:22:29.746]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:22:30.206 --> 00:22:37.811]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:41.633]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:22:42.093 --> 00:22:48.998]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently test it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:22:49.018 --> 00:22:50.378]  I mean, what did they really say about this?
[00:22:50.398 --> 00:22:51.379]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:54.301]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:22:55.161 --> 00:22:58.923]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:03.126]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:08.629]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:23:08.729 --> 00:23:16.153]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:23:16.213 --> 00:23:17.394]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[00:23:17.834 --> 00:23:18.975]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:22.236]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:23:22.496 --> 00:23:23.776]  And soon, they won't have it.
[00:23:24.116 --> 00:23:28.518]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:32.760]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.881]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:38.002]  People didn't believe in it.
[00:23:38.022 --> 00:23:39.022]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:40.803]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:23:42.123 --> 00:23:44.224]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:49.316]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.497]  Again, fund the InfoWars.
[00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:56.539]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.061]  It's a win-win.
[00:23:59.081 --> 00:23:59.061]  $200.
[00:23:59.101 --> 00:24:02.582]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:24:02.682 --> 00:24:03.443]  It's amazing.
[00:24:14.088 --> 00:24:16.549]  They don't want to see us
[00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:19.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.060]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.622]  We just talked in the last segment about the Golden Globes last night.
[00:24:24.702 --> 00:24:29.824]  Meryl Streep saying the thing that bothered her so much was Donald Trump mocking a disabled reporter.
[00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:41.309]  Of course, we talked about in the last segment how the things that didn't bother her, like abortion and selling baby parts, like setting the Middle East on fire, like Roman Polanski's rape of a 13-year-old girl, and she gave him a standing ovation.
[00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.431]  Mark Dice breaks down what a hoax this whole thing is.
[00:24:45.611 --> 00:24:46.612]  Here's Mark Dice's report.
[00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:58.047]  It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter.
[00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:04.896]  Someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back.
[00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:09.238]  Stop right there, Merrill, because it's time for the debunking to begin.
[00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:18.549]  She's talking about this gesture that Donald Trump made on the campaign trail during one of his speeches when he was calling out what one of the reporters was saying about him.
[00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:25.277]  It just so happened, unfortunately, that the reporter was physically disabled and has some deformed hands.
[00:25:25.797 --> 00:25:30.920]  So on the surface, it could appear that Donald Trump was mocking that reporter.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:39.824]  Until you realize that that's one of Donald Trump's typical tactics and nervous tics or little quirks when he's making fun of someone.
[00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:44.827]  Here's a clip of him making the same gesture while mocking Ted Cruz.
[00:25:45.447 --> 00:25:47.088]  You know, I heard Ted's a good debater.
[00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:49.809]  I said, he is a good debater, but he can't talk, okay?
[00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:50.669]  Bad talker.
[00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.230]  He's a good debater, bad talker.
[00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.031]  So he's over here, they asked him about waterboarding.
[00:25:55.732 --> 00:25:58.513]  They said, Senator Cruz, what do you think of waterboarding?
[00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:00.514]  I don't want to talk about it.
[00:26:00.754 --> 00:26:02.655]  He didn't want to talk about waterboarding.
[00:26:03.018 --> 00:26:06.740]  There it is folks, the same exact gesture mocking Ted Cruz.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.221]  It's one of Trump's typical quirks.
[00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:20.247]  Donald Trump was also caught on video making that same gesture throughout the campaign several other times while he was mocking other individuals who of course didn't have a disability.
[00:26:20.547 --> 00:26:32.433]  So this is what we would call an unfortunate coincidence when one of the multiple individuals that he makes fun of with his unique nonverbal quirk happens to be disabled.
[00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:45.823]  When the liberal media first started spreading this lie during the presidential campaign, many sources clearly debunked it by showing the clips of Donald Trump doing the same exact gesture in other situations, mocking other individuals.
[00:26:46.243 --> 00:26:48.905]  But the liberal media refuses to mention that.
[00:26:49.205 --> 00:27:01.175]  Now Meryl Streep, duped by this liberal lie, repeated it on national television in front of millions of mentally enslaved morons, further perpetuating this false narrative.
[00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:10.441]  Here's Donald Trump making the same gesture back in 2005 on Larry King Live, when he was just talking about how he was flustered from being overworked.
[00:27:11.102 --> 00:27:17.627]  Here he is at yet another campaign event, doing the same gesture when talking about the big banksters ruining our country.
[00:27:17.647 --> 00:27:19.909]  They can't do anything, they're run by the regulators.
[00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:21.990]  In all fairness to the banks, they're run by the regulators.
[00:27:22.551 --> 00:27:25.813]  When you see the president of the bank, I mentioned the word regulators.
[00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:28.155]  These guys come in, they run the bank.
[00:27:29.153 --> 00:27:32.294]  Again, a standard nonverbal quirk that we all have.
[00:27:32.654 --> 00:27:37.534]  Here he is at yet another campaign event, making the same, quote, spastic gesture.
[00:27:37.895 --> 00:27:42.055]  Again, clearly not making fun of anyone that's physically handicapped.
[00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:48.856]  And I watched a general recently on television, and they said to him, what do you think about ISIS?
[00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:50.757]  Oh, ISIS is very tough.
[00:27:51.777 --> 00:27:53.257]  Oh, ISIS is very tough.
[00:27:53.977 --> 00:27:55.358]  Oh, ISIS is very tough.
[00:27:55.998 --> 00:27:57.018]  You want to see more proof?
[00:27:57.238 --> 00:27:57.678]  There's more.
[00:27:59.648 --> 00:28:04.613]  And what a, what a mess that was the way she, she didn't know what to do.
[00:28:05.513 --> 00:28:06.374]  Well, how did you get it?
[00:28:06.534 --> 00:28:10.518]  Uh, well, uh, it was sent by Russia, Russia.
[00:28:11.198 --> 00:28:14.902]  You know, they're always using Russia like I have some, I have nothing to do with Russia.
[00:28:15.262 --> 00:28:16.523]  I think you get the point by now.
[00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:19.747]  It wasn't just once, it wasn't just twice, it wasn't just three times.
[00:28:19.987 --> 00:28:27.674]  That's a very common gesture, a nonverbal little quirk of Donald Trump's when he's just making fun of someone.
[00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:35.743]  And in this case with the reporter, it unfortunately was a coincidence that he happened to be handicapped and had some deformed hands.
[00:28:36.564 --> 00:28:37.925]  Great report there by Mark Dice.
[00:28:37.965 --> 00:28:44.168]  And of course, when you look at this tweet, and I get up this morning and I look and it's like, why is Donald Trump even giving her the time of day?
[00:28:44.208 --> 00:28:45.688]  Why is he punching down like this?
[00:28:45.708 --> 00:28:46.589]  She's just an actor.
[00:28:47.469 --> 00:28:49.670]  And it's beneath him to respond to that.
[00:28:50.011 --> 00:29:01.736]  But when you look at that report that Mark Dice just put together, you understand that he is just so incensed at the lies and the unfairness that are being thrown at him that he has to respond.
[00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:02.717]  He's compelled to respond.
[00:29:03.482 --> 00:29:13.870]  Now, I want to remind you, as we got just a little bit of time before we go to break, and we're going to be back in just a second, but we have put in a special here, 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[00:29:14.891 --> 00:29:18.694]  Again, this is a time of year that everybody starts to focus on their health.
[00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:26.439]  They take a look at how they've neglected it over the holidays, how they've overeaten, they go on a diet, and then your nutrition gets even worse.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.923]  You need to make sure that you've got a good base of supplements to take care of your body,
[00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:34.845]  To fight the toxic garbage that you've got out there, we've got massive specials.
[00:29:34.865 --> 00:29:40.207]  We've got 30% off Brain Force, Super Male Vitality, Survival X2, that's our nascent iodine.
[00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:48.230]  We also have 20% off Secret 12, that's our B12 formulation, Liver Shield, Knockout, Prostagard, many others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.913]  We also have auto-ship, so that you never have to run out of stock.
[00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:59.395]  You get 10% off when you sign up for it, and if your recurring order is more than $50, you get free shipping as well.
[00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:00.416]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:30:00.956 --> 00:30:02.581]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.484 --> 00:30:06.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.293 --> 00:30:20.763]  The fundraising campaign is underway for that Chicago victim kidnapped by four thugs, forced to drink from the toilet while his hair was cut bald in his clothes and he was taunted with Trump taunts.
[00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:27.490]  An online fundraising campaign for the family of the Chicago victim has pulled in eight times the amount it was intended to raise.
[00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:33.216]  A GoFundMe campaign that started on January the 5th had an intent of raising $10,000 for the victim and his family.
[00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:45.904]  Family, as reported by CBS News, the campaign account was called, quote, Let's Show the Chicago Victim Love, and it's raised a whopping $79,556, about $70,000 more than their target goal of $10,000.
[00:30:46.544 --> 00:31:00.093]  And the Daily Caller reporter Amber Randall writes about the fundraising campaign that's underway, saying, quote, For those of you that have not seen the horrific torture and trauma recently inflicted on a young man in Chicago, it is not something you will soon forget soon.
[00:31:00.253 --> 00:31:06.835]  The fundraising page reads, the fundraiser is a good way to remind the family of this victim that we are all behind them, supporting them.
[00:31:07.036 --> 00:31:09.456]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:10.637 --> 00:31:12.438]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:14.118 --> 00:31:19.800]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.382]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:25.353 --> 00:31:27.574]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:27.654 --> 00:31:28.794]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:28.814 --> 00:31:32.036]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:33.376]  Or more.
[00:31:33.456 --> 00:31:35.397]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:35.877 --> 00:31:37.358]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:31:37.458 --> 00:31:40.799]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.660]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:53.645]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:54.646 --> 00:32:07.452]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:10.404 --> 00:32:16.579]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:18.544]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:32:19.434 --> 00:32:21.316]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:32:21.936 --> 00:32:27.481]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:32:28.081 --> 00:32:36.067]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:38.549]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:43.053]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:32:43.313 --> 00:32:44.054]  This is how it works.
[00:32:44.354 --> 00:32:44.875]  You order.
[00:32:44.995 --> 00:32:45.775]  Customize or
[00:32:46.876 --> 00:32:48.338]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:51.981]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:32:52.282 --> 00:32:56.346]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:57.326]  You cannot lose.
[00:32:57.367 --> 00:32:58.468]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:05.514]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:09.799]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:25.623]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.643 --> 00:33:37.051]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January the 9th, 2017, ten days from the Trump inauguration.
[00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:42.455]  We're going to talk about what he might do on day one, and of course, a big part of that is Obamacare.
[00:33:42.475 --> 00:33:43.576]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:47.639]  But before I let go of Hollywood, I want to point out
[00:33:48.439 --> 00:33:51.242]  That they're not on the side of free speech, even.
[00:33:51.683 --> 00:33:52.964]  And this is the most amazing thing.
[00:33:52.984 --> 00:34:00.793]  You would think that Hollywood, always talking about that type of civil liberties, you know, they're not going to stand for religious freedom unless it's for Muslims.
[00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:03.616]  But they do like to talk about free speech.
[00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:09.262]  And of course, to them, free speech is doing things that are very offensive, like putting a crucifix in a vat of urine.
[00:34:09.927 --> 00:34:12.448]  And getting a massive federal subsidy for it.
[00:34:13.128 --> 00:34:14.809]  But they don't like your political speech.
[00:34:15.209 --> 00:34:18.109]  And you know, they don't like you telling people about their age, either.
[00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.270]  So that's one of the biggest taboos in Hollywood, isn't it?
[00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:22.591]  The last taboo.
[00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:30.653]  They will do anything to hide their age, no matter what, how much they gotta pump in their lips and how fast they, how much they gotta stretch their faces.
[00:34:30.673 --> 00:34:32.214]  You know, I go back and I think about Brazil.
[00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:42.162]  He knew exactly what they were up to and the funny shots that he had of the older ladies who were getting that plastic surgery and the rubbery faces that they were pulling back.
[00:34:42.203 --> 00:34:44.405]  Maybe you guys can pull that up as a B-roll.
[00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:56.055]  But now what's going on is there's a fight in California to come after IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, that is a massive source of information about all things Hollywood.
[00:34:57.111 --> 00:35:13.202]  And California came out with a state law that they passed in September this last year that mandates that officials at imdb.com, the leading purveyor of information in the film industry, had to agree to individual requests to remove the ages of actors, directors, and writers.
[00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:16.725]  Even writers in Hollywood are afraid to have their age be known.
[00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:26.489]  And so they say even though you would think that Hollywood actors would be used to giving up their privacy, that's the one thing they don't want known about them, and that is their age.
[00:35:28.558 --> 00:35:32.260]  I don't have any problem getting naked in public, but don't tell anybody their age, okay?
[00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:33.481]  This is hollyweird.
[00:35:34.302 --> 00:35:37.524]  They say in November, IMDB filed a lawsuit in federal court.
[00:35:38.124 --> 00:35:48.792]  Reuters reported then that the law was deemed to be, quote, unfair because it was carefully tailored to apply only to imdb.com and not to other sources of information.
[00:35:49.724 --> 00:35:54.308]  Now, the interesting thing about it is, and they point this out, they say the law plainly violates the First Amendment of the U.S.
[00:35:54.328 --> 00:35:55.909]  Constitution, cannot be forced.
[00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:57.931]  See, Hollywood hates the First Amendment.
[00:35:58.551 --> 00:35:59.712]  Hollywood hates a free press.
[00:36:00.132 --> 00:36:01.654]  Hollywood hates a free internet.
[00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:06.978]  They have embraced censorship, just like people on the left always do.
[00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:10.581]  This time, what they want to censor is anybody finding out about their age.
[00:36:11.222 --> 00:36:12.823]  And again, I want to repeat to Hollywood,
[00:36:13.988 --> 00:36:21.031]  That, you know, your movies, for decades, were not given First Amendment protection by the Supreme Court.
[00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:22.452]  Think about that for a moment.
[00:36:22.492 --> 00:36:23.993]  You always appeal to the Supreme Court.
[00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:27.074]  You see that as an engine of change.
[00:36:27.214 --> 00:36:31.737]  You want the Supreme Court to dictate to people and say, hey, the Constitution is a living document.
[00:36:31.777 --> 00:36:34.458]  It is whatever the Supreme Court says it is at any given time.
[00:36:35.353 --> 00:36:37.357]  Well, the First Amendment was really very clear.
[00:36:37.377 --> 00:36:40.023]  We didn't need the Supreme Court to interpret it for us.
[00:36:40.063 --> 00:36:42.788]  It wasn't written in a foreign language, so we don't need any interpretation.
[00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:45.113]  We can read it, and we can understand what it says.
[00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:55.752]  And yet, back in 1917, if you remember, we had a Hollywood filmmaker that was given a massive fine in those days.
[00:36:55.772 --> 00:36:56.932]  $10,000 fine.
[00:36:56.992 --> 00:37:04.134]  If you go back and look at the purchasing power of that after the Federal Reserve has devalued our money, that's massive, okay?
[00:37:04.754 --> 00:37:06.034]  That's about a hundred times that.
[00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:07.515]  So he was given a massive fine.
[00:37:07.555 --> 00:37:08.715]  He was given ten years in jail.
[00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:11.456]  They eventually commuted it to three years in jail.
[00:37:12.372 --> 00:37:13.413]  And what was his crime?
[00:37:14.093 --> 00:37:16.655]  He had made a film about the American Revolution.
[00:37:16.675 --> 00:37:17.716]  He called it The Spirit of 76.
[00:37:19.517 --> 00:37:26.102]  And Woodrow Wilson didn't want anything that portrayed the British in a negative light, because he wanted to get us involved in World War I on the side of the British.
[00:37:26.122 --> 00:37:27.383]  And he didn't want any division there.
[00:37:27.463 --> 00:37:29.084]  So they censored his film.
[00:37:29.144 --> 00:37:30.505]  He refused to have it censored.
[00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:32.386]  And so they eventually put him in jail.
[00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:35.448]  And that stood until 1972.
[00:37:35.548 --> 00:37:39.091]  And of course this was done under Obama's favorite
[00:37:40.404 --> 00:37:45.391]  To come after the press, to come after whistleblowers, and that's the Espionage Act of 1917.
[00:37:45.552 --> 00:37:51.361]  In the last 100 years, Obama has used that more than all the other presidents combined.
[00:37:51.581 --> 00:37:53.424]  That guy that Hollywood loves so much.
[00:37:54.494 --> 00:37:54.994]  I don't know.
[00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:22.012]  Out of control of public lands, out of private lands, out of state lands, and to confiscate that property, taking some of the property now around the Bundy Ranch.
[00:38:22.132 --> 00:38:25.394]  And hopefully that's going to be reversed by the Trump administration.
[00:38:25.414 --> 00:38:26.334]  We'll have to wait and see.
[00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:33.619]  When Donald Trump ran in Nevada, he had a very, very strong op-ed piece that ran in the paper there.
[00:38:34.847 --> 00:38:56.346]  And talked about the abuses of the BLM, the abuses of taking property that should not be under federal control, that ought to be under state control, or ought to be under private control, or have the state own it and license it out to people, the various aspects of it as different water rights, or mineral rights, or grazing rights, or whatever.
[00:38:56.406 --> 00:38:58.408]  But he spoke very compellingly about that.
[00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:01.369]  That is the way that Obama has used these ancient laws.
[00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.311]  The 1906 Antiquities Act, he has abused that.
[00:39:04.371 --> 00:39:09.094]  He has abused the 1917 Espionage Act to come after journalists and whistleblowers.
[00:39:09.174 --> 00:39:10.775]  This is the guy that Hollywood loves.
[00:39:11.895 --> 00:39:13.256]  This is what Hollywood does.
[00:39:13.296 --> 00:39:17.399]  They come out and say, don't you dare tell anybody how old we are.
[00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:20.600]  Now the globalists are getting very concerned.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.842]  I pointed out, as we started talking about Hollywood,
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:31.412]  What is coming up in Davos, and the fact that they use all these Hollywood actors to give this meeting, this Bilderberg-like meeting.
[00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:34.073]  It is, it's another one of the Bilderberg meetings.
[00:39:34.093 --> 00:39:37.214]  They like to pretend that Bilderberg doesn't exist, but then they celebrate Davos!
[00:39:37.674 --> 00:39:41.996]  And they have Hollywood actors show up, and they make a big show about it.
[00:39:42.556 --> 00:39:43.356]  They're both the same thing.
[00:39:43.376 --> 00:39:47.998]  They have multiple confabs like this where they conspire about what they're going to do, and they're very concerned at this point.
[00:39:48.763 --> 00:39:53.628]  They're very concerned that, as Drudge has pointed out, we have a new, new world order.
[00:39:53.668 --> 00:39:59.734]  That's a world order that is focusing more on sovereign nations and their power.
[00:39:59.774 --> 00:40:00.635]  And I think that's a good thing.
[00:40:00.675 --> 00:40:04.720]  We do not want to have power devolve into a single point.
[00:40:06.124 --> 00:40:07.586]  Nation states are bad enough.
[00:40:07.646 --> 00:40:10.489]  I think we need to devolve power away from the nation states.
[00:40:10.529 --> 00:40:12.492]  We need to make everything more local.
[00:40:12.552 --> 00:40:14.094]  We need to take it back to the state level.
[00:40:14.114 --> 00:40:16.277]  We need to take it back to the city and county level.
[00:40:16.857 --> 00:40:18.960]  We need to take it back to the individual level.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.543]  We need power over our own lives.
[00:40:22.224 --> 00:40:24.507]  But every time we take this up to the next level,
[00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:26.662]  We lose our freedom.
[00:40:26.922 --> 00:40:27.683]  We lose our liberty.
[00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:36.327]  And so that's why it is essential to stop this consolidation as it makes its final push to the final point, and that is a one world government.
[00:40:36.347 --> 00:40:37.487]  So that's what's going on right now.
[00:40:37.507 --> 00:40:42.689]  Now there's a bill, The New American points out, there's a bill to get the United States out of the UN.
[00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:44.230]  It's been introduced in Congress.
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.152]  This is legislation to get us out of the UN, and hopefully to get the UN out of the US.
[00:40:48.932 --> 00:40:57.360]  They say, to evict the scandal-plagued global body from the United States has been reintroduced and Congress, if approved, H.R.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.524]  193, better known as the American Sovereignty Restoration Act, would end U.S.
[00:41:01.564 --> 00:41:06.989]  participation in and funding of the widely ridiculed quote-unquote dictator's club.
[00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:12.170]  While protecting American sovereignty under the Constitution, support for the effort is spreading like wildfire.
[00:41:12.211 --> 00:41:14.491]  And I want you to get involved.
[00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:17.912]  All of you who are listening, you have the power to start this movement.
[00:41:18.452 --> 00:41:22.454]  We have never been closer to shutting down the UN.
[00:41:22.874 --> 00:41:30.536]  We've never been closer to auditing the Fed as a first step to shutting down the Federal Reserve and that tyranny that was enacted in 1913.
[00:41:32.737 --> 00:41:40.364]  There are some really oppressive organizations that have ruled over us for a century, and this is our time now, that we can overthrow those.
[00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:42.806]  We have it within our grasp.
[00:41:43.783 --> 00:41:53.410]  And it's going to take you staying involved and being active and supporting Trump as he moves against these things, because he has talked about pushing back against this.
[00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.350]  I want to go back to the article.
[00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:03.216]  It said on the campaign trail, Trump, whose campaign was equated with ISIS by a top UN bureaucrat, lambasted the UN and said it was not a friend of freedom.
[00:42:03.436 --> 00:42:03.797]  It isn't.
[00:42:04.468 --> 00:42:06.188]  He's not a friend of the United States either.
[00:42:06.548 --> 00:42:08.669]  He also vowed to cancel key U.N.
[00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:14.170]  agreements in office, including the illegitimate climate change concocted in Paris in 2015.
[00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.110]  He said, when do you see the U.N.
[00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.551]  solving problems?
[00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:19.731]  They don't.
[00:42:20.431 --> 00:42:22.851]  They cause problems, said Donald Trump.
[00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:24.712]  That's one of the reasons you voted for him.
[00:42:24.732 --> 00:42:26.032]  It's one of the reasons I voted for him.
[00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:30.633]  And we need to make sure that we stand behind him and stand with him.
[00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:38.430]  A majority of Republicans support Donald Trump far more than they support the mainstream GOP establishment.
[00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:39.410]  That's quite evident.
[00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.691]  We have seen them betray us multiple times.
[00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:46.792]  I think that Donald Trump is going to do some of these things that he said he's going to do.
[00:42:46.852 --> 00:42:48.253]  Let's make sure that he does.
[00:42:48.313 --> 00:42:52.874]  And let's stand behind him because he is going to be opposed even by the Republicans on this.
[00:42:52.934 --> 00:42:55.615]  They said the Globals appear to be taking Trump's rhetoric very seriously.
[00:42:56.445 --> 00:43:03.029]  Global Governance Director, that's his title, Stuart Patrick, with the establishment Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:43:03.049 --> 00:43:06.511]  So the CFR has got a Global Governance Director.
[00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:09.673]  We've told you about that for a long time.
[00:43:09.893 --> 00:43:17.638]  And of course, Ronald Reagan was the first president that we'd had for a couple of generations that wasn't a part of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:43:17.698 --> 00:43:19.559]  But then, when he became president,
[00:43:20.407 --> 00:43:26.652]  He added about 300 plus CFR people into the State Department, and they owned him.
[00:43:27.233 --> 00:43:29.335]  And I hope that doesn't happen with Donald Trump.
[00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.537]  I think he's a lot more astute than Ronald Reagan.
[00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:34.719]  He's not an actor, he's the real thing, okay?
[00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:38.622]  He's managed large companies, and I think he's a lot more astute than that.
[00:43:39.003 --> 00:43:43.647]  Nevertheless, this guy, Stuart Patrick, the Global Governance Director for the CFR,
[00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:45.912]  Warned recently that the U.N.
[00:43:45.932 --> 00:43:51.435]  was set to get hammered in the years ahead by the hostile administration of a GOP-controlled Congress and Donald Trump.
[00:43:51.455 --> 00:43:51.996]  Let's hope so.
[00:43:52.056 --> 00:43:52.916]  Let's hope they get hammered.
[00:43:53.777 --> 00:43:59.600]  And this is a guy, they point out, the new American, who responded to the systematic rape of children by U.N.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.682]  peacekeeping troops by demanding more power for the U.N.
[00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:07.045]  And of course this has happened in multiple places where U.N.
[00:44:07.485 --> 00:44:09.726]  peacekeeping troops have gone in.
[00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:13.449]  They've been involved in widespread raping of children
[00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:18.664]  And they have fired and attacked the whistleblowers, as we always see happens to whistleblowers.
[00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:20.825]  But nevertheless, it did get out.
[00:44:21.685 --> 00:44:31.769]  And when France found out, for example, that some of the French troops that were under the control of the UN were raping children, they took action against them.
[00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:33.009]  But the U.N.
[00:44:33.049 --> 00:44:35.050]  was doing everything it could to hide that.
[00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.390]  And so this is the U.N.
[00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.170]  that we're talking about.
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.011]  He called for the U.N.
[00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:43.652]  to try to dupe Trump into believing that he could use the U.N.
[00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:44.692]  to get things done.
[00:44:45.112 --> 00:44:47.753]  Now this bill was reintroduced on January the 3rd.
[00:44:47.773 --> 00:44:52.434]  It was reintroduced by Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama.
[00:44:52.494 --> 00:44:55.334]  So there's a shout out to Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama.
[00:44:55.394 --> 00:44:58.375]  Thank you people of Alabama for putting somebody like that in Congress.
[00:44:58.815 --> 00:45:05.738]  And thank you, Representative Congressman Rogers, for doing that, and a coalition of liberty-minded lawmakers, as New American points out.
[00:45:06.298 --> 00:45:10.699]  They say if approved, the legislation would repeal the UN Participation Act of 1945.
[00:45:10.779 --> 00:45:11.380]  Think about that.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.161]  See, this has been there for a long time.
[00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:19.202]  This has been there for, you know, 60, 70 years, okay?
[00:45:19.222 --> 00:45:19.743]  70 years.
[00:45:20.643 --> 00:45:22.924]  And so you think, well, we can't leave the UN.
[00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:25.557]  We are captured by the U.N.
[00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:27.058]  That's a very dangerous way to think.
[00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:31.519]  Understand that the U.N., we got into the U.N.
[00:45:31.539 --> 00:45:36.621]  by voluntarily saying we're going to participate in it, and Congress passed a bill that said we're going to participate in this.
[00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:39.961]  And so just like Obamacare, we can get out of it.
[00:45:40.802 --> 00:45:42.502]  It just takes the political will to do it.
[00:45:43.202 --> 00:45:48.664]  Yet, even something like Obamacare, and I've seen this before with the Department of Education,
[00:45:49.468 --> 00:46:03.975]  Jimmy Carter created the Department of Education, and now we've all been suffering with their meddling, their interference, the education czars that we've seen coming in to take over the education of our children, to try to federalize that, to push things like Common Core down our throat.
[00:46:04.255 --> 00:46:05.836]  Neither parents nor teachers like that.
[00:46:06.216 --> 00:46:07.957]  That's all coming from the Department of Education.
[00:46:08.277 --> 00:46:11.118]  Ronald Reagan campaigned and said, I'm going to get rid of the Department of Education.
[00:46:11.138 --> 00:46:12.239]  It was less than four years old.
[00:46:13.527 --> 00:46:18.031]  I've said many times, he could have killed Rosemary's baby while it was still in the crib.
[00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:19.953]  But instead, he didn't.
[00:46:20.053 --> 00:46:21.155]  He didn't do anything.
[00:46:21.175 --> 00:46:22.977]  He made it grow.
[00:46:23.357 --> 00:46:27.481]  And it was many times larger by the time Ronald Reagan left than it was when he took office.
[00:46:28.262 --> 00:46:29.724]  Same thing is true of Obamacare.
[00:46:30.184 --> 00:46:31.285]  We have a situation now.
[00:46:32.162 --> 00:46:34.284]  Where Obamacare is less than four years old.
[00:46:34.924 --> 00:46:39.167]  People can still remember a time when we didn't have Obamacare and we could still get medical care.
[00:46:39.708 --> 00:46:42.970]  And yes, there were problems, but it was a better system than we have now.
[00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:47.894]  It wasn't loaded with mandates and taxes that were supposed to make it cheaper for us.
[00:46:47.974 --> 00:46:48.154]  No.
[00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:49.635]  Taxes don't make it cheaper.
[00:46:49.895 --> 00:46:51.156]  They're robbing Peter to pay Paul.
[00:46:51.496 --> 00:46:54.258]  It is not subsidizing health insurance.
[00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:55.960]  It is redistributing wealth.
[00:46:57.152 --> 00:47:03.256]  That's why you're seeing your taxes go up, your Obamacare taxes, your insurance premiums is what they call them.
[00:47:03.577 --> 00:47:07.999]  That's why you're seeing them skyrocket, because it's basically just a redistribution method.
[00:47:08.039 --> 00:47:13.763]  But they're also putting in controls that are going to control the way healthcare is delivered.
[00:47:14.344 --> 00:47:17.206]  They're quietly putting controls on doctors.
[00:47:18.046 --> 00:47:21.869]  And that's something we haven't even talked about, but we're going to be talking about that in the coming days.
[00:47:22.571 --> 00:47:28.756]  But when we look at things like the Department of Education, we look at things like Obamacare, you have to get rid of them before they get entrenched.
[00:47:28.836 --> 00:47:37.102]  Otherwise, you have a situation like the UN, where we said, all right, we're going to fund the UN, we're going to participate in this new body voluntarily.
[00:47:37.162 --> 00:47:39.664]  And then 70 years later, people say, wait a minute, you can't get out of the UN.
[00:47:39.684 --> 00:47:41.045]  We've always been in the UN.
[00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:43.267]  No, no, we don't have to stay in there.
[00:47:43.867 --> 00:47:45.429]  The authorized US involvement.
[00:47:46.229 --> 00:47:50.393]  And they say the legislation would shutter the government's mission to this outfit.
[00:47:50.413 --> 00:48:02.743]  It would also terminate all membership by the United States in the United Nations and in any organ, specialized agency, commission, or other formally affiliated body of the United Nations.
[00:48:02.803 --> 00:48:04.565]  That specifically includes UNESCO,
[00:48:05.205 --> 00:48:11.054]  Which President Reagan withdrew from, along with the World Health Organization, the UN Environment Program.
[00:48:11.094 --> 00:48:16.142]  This is where they're selling the nonsense of climate change so that they can
[00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:20.891]  We have to have a global problem, folks, in order to fund a global government.
[00:48:20.991 --> 00:48:24.435]  And that's what the carbon taxes are about.
[00:48:25.095 --> 00:48:33.303]  And all of the carbon credits that they're doing is simply a massive crony capitalist project that is transferring wealth.
[00:48:33.363 --> 00:48:38.027]  But the other part of it is really about creating a way to fund a global government.
[00:48:38.047 --> 00:48:40.189]  You can't do that unless you have a global crisis.
[00:48:40.229 --> 00:48:41.330]  So that's why they've invented that.
[00:48:42.014 --> 00:48:44.216]  And they say it would also get us out of the U.N.
[00:48:44.276 --> 00:48:46.277]  dictator-controlled Human Rights Council.
[00:48:46.297 --> 00:48:51.001]  And that's not... That is not an exaggeration to say it's dictator-controlled.
[00:48:51.201 --> 00:48:57.506]  The amazing thing is, you look at this Human Rights Council in the U.N., and all the people that are sitting on it are people like the Saudis.
[00:48:58.463 --> 00:49:04.185]  These places are going to have the worst human rights record on the planet, and these are the people who are on these types of councils.
[00:49:04.265 --> 00:49:06.326]  It's that type of government that you'll find there.
[00:49:06.766 --> 00:49:07.686]  So it would end all U.S.
[00:49:07.726 --> 00:49:09.227]  involvement and all U.N.
[00:49:09.287 --> 00:49:11.288]  conventions and agreements, too.
[00:49:11.388 --> 00:49:13.508]  This is a very important piece of legislation.
[00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:17.230]  Again, it is House Bill, let's see, where is it?
[00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.030]  It's H.R.
[00:49:20.548 --> 00:49:21.369]  Um, 193.
[00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.990]  HR 193.
[00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.251]  Look that up.
[00:49:24.771 --> 00:49:25.412]  Write letters.
[00:49:25.852 --> 00:49:26.973]  Make telephone calls.
[00:49:27.433 --> 00:49:28.274]  Put it out on Twitter.
[00:49:28.354 --> 00:49:29.515]  Put it out on your Facebook.
[00:49:29.895 --> 00:49:41.083]  Build a movement to get us out of the UN while we have a sympathetic, wise president who is wise to these tactics and doesn't like what they're doing.
[00:49:41.584 --> 00:49:46.968]  And the other thing that is important is that this has pulled in people who normally would dig in their heels on it.
[00:49:47.408 --> 00:49:47.949]  People like
[00:49:48.792 --> 00:49:58.075]  Lindsey Graham and John McCain, the reliable warmongers, are now pushing back against this.
[00:49:58.155 --> 00:49:58.475]  Why?
[00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:04.997]  Because Obama used the UN to attack Israel, and they are always going to be in the corner of Israel.
[00:50:05.017 --> 00:50:09.259]  So let's use this moment right now, while Obama and the Democrats
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:15.464]  took the time to pivot towards Muslims in the most public way that they have done yet.
[00:50:15.504 --> 00:50:23.549]  This is their virtue signaling to all the Muslims that the Democrat Party is your home and basically they just punched the Israelis in the nose.
[00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:32.196]  Now is a good time for all those who are part of the Israeli lobby to join us and we can have a partnership with them on this.
[00:50:32.256 --> 00:50:34.717]  I don't support everything carte blanche that Israel wants to do.
[00:50:35.498 --> 00:50:37.899]  But this is a time where we need to.
[00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:53.886]  They unilaterally reversed the procedure that has been in place since the 70s by both Republican and Democrat parties saying we are not going to let the UN dictate this conflict issue between Israelis and Palestinians and Obama just reversed that.
[00:50:54.006 --> 00:50:54.966]  Now is the time.
[00:50:55.247 --> 00:50:56.407]  We've got a lot of things there.
[00:50:56.667 --> 00:50:58.648]  We can push getting out of the UN.
[00:50:58.868 --> 00:50:59.848]  Let's make that happen.
[00:50:59.868 --> 00:51:00.789]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:18.376]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:51:19.356 --> 00:51:28.179]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:51:28.579 --> 00:51:32.440]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.500]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.021]  We now have George Soros.
[00:51:38.121 --> 00:51:38.862]  As a goblin.
[00:51:39.542 --> 00:51:43.204]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[00:51:43.544 --> 00:51:44.204]  No Soros.
[00:51:44.565 --> 00:51:45.325]  Him as a goblin.
[00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:50.448]  It says, Deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:51:51.749 --> 00:51:55.891]  So, it is a limited edition, Deport Soros on the back.
[00:51:56.431 --> 00:51:57.592]  Hillary for President on the front.
[00:51:57.972 --> 00:51:59.773]  Right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:00.714]  It's powerful.
[00:52:00.734 --> 00:52:01.774]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[00:52:02.034 --> 00:52:04.035]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:52:10.208 --> 00:52:24.997]  Well, if you were too busy and didn't watch the Golden Globes last night, where liberal stars like Meryl Streep were reveling in the loss of her party and her platform, and blaming Donald Trump for picking on a, quote, handicapped reporter, here's some more fake news for you.
[00:52:25.177 --> 00:52:32.201]  The totalitarian left has decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on merits, they would just prefer to eliminate them altogether.
[00:52:32.401 --> 00:52:33.222]  The New York Times.
[00:52:33.502 --> 00:52:46.431]  In two op-ed articles on Sunday's review, the Grey Lady attacks Breitbart News and its founder, rest in peace Andrew Breitbart, and encourages an effort to destroy the company by appealing directly to advertisers not to support their website.
[00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:50.814]  One article reads, quote, how to destroy the business model of Breitbart and fake news.
[00:52:50.994 --> 00:52:58.560]  It's celebrating the flagging efforts of anonymous Twitter trolls who've tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:07.007]  These would-be censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views on their merits, they're just going to try to eliminate them altogether.
[00:53:07.027 --> 00:53:09.669]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:53:14.261 --> 00:53:15.802]  There is a crisis in America today.
[00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:18.645]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[00:53:18.965 --> 00:53:26.372]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[00:53:26.772 --> 00:53:30.395]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[00:53:30.736 --> 00:53:31.857]  I have the answer for you today.
[00:53:32.277 --> 00:53:33.438]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:39.823]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[00:53:39.923 --> 00:53:45.688]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[00:53:46.508 --> 00:53:48.970]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.135]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[00:53:55.896 --> 00:53:56.717]  It's a blocking pocket.
[00:53:56.757 --> 00:53:57.958]  This is impossible.
[00:53:58.038 --> 00:54:00.680]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.763]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocking pocket.
[00:54:05.783 --> 00:54:13.629]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:13.769 --> 00:54:15.591]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:26.414 --> 00:54:34.221]  As we've seen in the last couple of weeks, we've seen the Drudge Report attacked and shut down a couple of times with denial of service attacks.
[00:54:34.461 --> 00:54:36.643]  Of course, the same thing happened to InfoWars as well.
[00:54:36.683 --> 00:54:37.803]  We're under constant attack.
[00:54:38.624 --> 00:54:45.250]  And one of the ways that you can help us, to stand with us, is to buy the products that we sell at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:54.978]  Of course, those products are set up to help you withstand the attacks against your own body, from the toxic chemicals that are in your environment, in your food, your water, your air.
[00:54:55.698 --> 00:55:09.272]  It also gives you a good base, an excellent base of nutritional support as you're trying to overcome the things that you've done to yourself over the holidays with your sedentary lifestyle and your massive feasting.
[00:55:09.692 --> 00:55:14.917]  Everybody is feeling it after the holidays and so that's why at the beginning of the year everybody starts on their diets.
[00:55:14.937 --> 00:55:17.220]  Well if you're going to get on a diet you've got to make sure that you've got
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.221]  The kind of support for your body.
[00:55:19.241 --> 00:55:22.162]  If you're going to reduce calories, if you're going to reduce, cut out some of the stuff.
[00:55:22.182 --> 00:55:24.063]  You're also, you're not just going to be cutting out junk.
[00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:26.844]  You're also going to be cutting out some nutritional aspects.
[00:55:26.864 --> 00:55:28.465]  So you need to make sure that that is there.
[00:55:28.765 --> 00:55:29.806]  Those nutritional base.
[00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:33.027]  So what we've done is we've set up a special sale.
[00:55:33.287 --> 00:55:35.869]  We have the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[00:55:35.889 --> 00:55:40.291]  We have 30% off Brain Force, Super Male Vitality, Survival X2.
[00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:41.611]  That's our nascent iodine.
[00:55:41.631 --> 00:55:44.132]  You need a good form of iodine.
[00:55:44.153 --> 00:55:44.953]  They don't put that
[00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:46.193]  We're good to go.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.803]  Good rest, that is vital for your health.
[00:56:08.143 --> 00:56:13.950]  20% off Prostagard, 20% off many other products that you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:22.541]  Stand with us, fight the attacks from the globalists on our organization and on free speech, and fight the attacks on your body that you see.
[00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:33.930]  As we're talking about this, I think it's interesting, CNN, this is a free thought project, CNN retracts their own fake news as Americans label them the least trusted cable news network.
[00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:42.917]  And of course, this is the sort of thing where they are just collapsing, even though we have exposed all the lies.
[00:56:42.937 --> 00:56:44.859]  We're going to talk about this more later in the program.
[00:56:44.879 --> 00:56:46.320]  We talked about it a great deal yesterday.
[00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:59.367]  Phony narrative that they're selling us about the Russian involvement in this election and what they really want you to hear is that the Russians got in and rigged the machines.
[00:56:59.387 --> 00:57:00.968]  That's why they keep using the term hack.
[00:57:01.708 --> 00:57:06.351]  You see, we exposed, and it wasn't just the Russians, it was everybody that publicized this.
[00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:07.732]  Mainstream media wouldn't talk about it.
[00:57:08.646 --> 00:57:11.448]  Mainstream media was colluding with Hillary behind the scenes.
[00:57:11.468 --> 00:57:13.209]  That's one of the things that was exposed.
[00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:19.214]  So if you tell the truth about Hillary, you tell the truth about mainstream media, then they say you hacked the election.
[00:57:20.655 --> 00:57:28.941]  And now they're using that image that they have created to try to insinuate themselves into the actual voting machines.
[00:57:29.502 --> 00:57:31.463]  And that's what we really need to be afraid of.
[00:57:31.483 --> 00:57:35.946]  And of course Donald Trump said to reporters, he said, look, no computer is ever safe.
[00:57:36.647 --> 00:57:41.910]  If you have something important, write it down on a piece of paper, give it to a courier, have it hand-delivered.
[00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:45.472]  That's the way our elections should be run.
[00:57:46.413 --> 00:57:50.396]  Your vote is too important to be put on a computer, because then it is hackable.
[00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:53.382]  Your vote should be written down on a piece of paper.
[00:57:53.963 --> 00:58:03.329]  There should be multiple eyewitnesses at every stage, making sure that the ballots are not stuffed, that the actual ballots and only the actual ballots are transmitted to the next stage.
[00:58:03.809 --> 00:58:06.090]  That is precisely what we need.
[00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:11.394]  We need to have a paper system, not the voting machines that can be hacked.
[00:58:12.441 --> 00:58:19.608]  Now one of the ways that they're going to attack Donald Trump, of course, is going to be coming after him for his so-called conflict of interest.
[00:58:19.648 --> 00:58:23.891]  And now we see Elizabeth Warren taking the point on this.
[00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:26.053]  We're going to talk about this on the other side of the hour.
[00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:30.317]  We're going to talk about how Elizabeth Warren, the schoolmarm,
[00:58:31.438 --> 00:58:35.699]  is out there talking about Trump has to get rid of his conflict of interest.
[00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:38.740]  We're going to tell you why that's not really going to be possible.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.561]  Why it's not even a good idea.
[00:58:40.581 --> 00:58:42.521]  Believe me, it's not a good idea.
[00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:47.162]  We don't want to just have lawyers, politicians, and community organizers.
[00:58:47.182 --> 00:58:48.763]  We want people who really accomplish things.
[00:58:49.163 --> 00:58:49.503]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.523 --> 00:58:50.063]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:50.823 --> 00:58:52.284]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.304 --> 00:58:55.345]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.117 --> 00:59:02.999]  National.group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.100]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.281]  Why is this so good?
[00:59:05.581 --> 00:59:10.805]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:59:10.905 --> 00:59:24.455]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:24.515 --> 00:59:25.896]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:26.676 --> 00:59:28.257]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:28.317 --> 00:59:30.799]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:30.899 --> 00:59:32.160]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.301]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:34.382]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:34.673 --> 00:59:38.995]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:42.316]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:42.336 --> 00:59:45.537]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:45.557 --> 00:59:46.578]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:46.618 --> 00:59:48.498]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:48.558 --> 00:59:49.579]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:51.660]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.181]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:59:54.241 --> 00:59:55.321]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:55.581 --> 00:59:57.482]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:57.862 --> 00:59:59.823]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:00:02.273 --> 01:00:06.376]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:06.896 --> 01:00:08.237]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.647 --> 01:00:26.690]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.872]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:40.152 --> 01:00:44.034]  I think it's too early to tell.
[01:00:44.635 --> 01:00:59.564]  The bleeding heart left, represented and echoed by the sycophantic mainstream media with all of its intended demagoguery, is growing an internal threat to the future safety and security of the citizens of these once United States.
[01:00:59.884 --> 01:01:08.449]  Planted in American soil, a seed of seemingly protected full-blown hate crimes against average Americans, mass
[01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:25.175]  As a misunderstanding of perspective, as was repeated yet again in Chicago when four racists live streamed themselves attacking an 18-year-old mentally disturbed man over the course of as long as two days, scalping him.
[01:01:25.635 --> 01:01:31.157]  Beating him and forcing him to repeat F Donald Trump and F white people.
[01:01:31.177 --> 01:01:34.199]  When I seen it I just wanted to make sure this guy was safe.
[01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:35.619]  But it's a hate crime.
[01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:52.266]  And it's Groundhog Day again as the same woman, CNN contributor Simone Sanders, repeats her defense of more blatant hate crimes as she recently did when back in November of 2016 a Trump supporter was pulled from his car and violently beaten.
[01:01:52.506 --> 01:01:57.009]  And what do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.830]  Oh my goodness!
[01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:58.651]  Poor white people!
[01:01:58.711 --> 01:01:59.311]  Please!
[01:01:59.331 --> 01:01:59.631]  Stop!
[01:01:59.952 --> 01:02:00.632]  Stop it, Karl.
[01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:03.654]  In my opinion, we don't need white people leading the Democratic Party right now.
[01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:07.978]  I even hear Simone say that a white person should not lead the Democratic Party.
[01:02:08.338 --> 01:02:10.359]  What could be more racist than that?
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.623]  We cannot callously go about classifying things as a hate crime.
[01:02:14.743 --> 01:02:19.326]  When someone is repeatedly telling you that your community is the worst of the worst,
[01:02:19.386 --> 01:02:37.948]  If you had white teens who had tortured and brutalized an African-American young man, and those white teens had talked about Obama and had been laughing, I don't think we would be having a conversation about how, oh, our political discourse is so toxic and, you know, maybe these kids saw things on Twitter about Obama.
[01:02:38.248 --> 01:02:39.148]  That is not a hate crime.
[01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:45.290]  Hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity.
[01:02:47.511 --> 01:02:48.131]  That's what this is.
[01:02:48.191 --> 01:02:48.751]  It's evil.
[01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:49.532]  It's brutality.
[01:02:49.552 --> 01:02:51.712]  It's man's inhumanity to man.
[01:02:51.912 --> 01:02:53.753]  I don't think it's evil.
[01:02:53.973 --> 01:02:59.675]  And for some reason, it's okay to the producers at CNN to promote this viewpoint.
[01:02:59.815 --> 01:03:05.498]  Because the victims fit the bill to fuel dangerous racial tensions in America.
[01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:10.281]  Is mainstream media that arrogant to think that Americans are that gullible?
[01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:18.526]  Or is active sedition now the way these overpaid media puppets are going to ultimately destroy their rickety platform?
[01:03:18.826 --> 01:03:22.870]  With their 6% trust rating according to Pew Research.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:33.361]  And although the Chicago Police said they were appalled by the teenage attacker's actions, the police spokesman still went on to downplay the hate crime aspect of the recorded events.
[01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:34.542]  They're 18.
[01:03:35.783 --> 01:03:36.984]  Kids make stupid decisions.
[01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:41.869]  I shouldn't call them kids, they're legally adults, but they're young adults and they make stupid decisions.
[01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:53.459]  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate crime is, if we seek a hate crime, to determine whether or not this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.
[01:03:53.739 --> 01:03:59.684]  But now, according to ABC7 in Chicago, hate crime charges are being filed.
[01:03:59.884 --> 01:04:20.008]  Jordan Hill, 18 of Carpentersville, Tesfaye Cooper, 18 of Chicago, Brittany Covington, 18 of Chicago, and Tanisha Covington, 24 of Chicago, were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and residential burglary.
[01:04:20.108 --> 01:04:24.729]  Hill was also charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.
[01:04:25.009 --> 01:04:28.110]  These are the people Simone Sanders would defend.
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:29.290]  Where will it end?
[01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:34.932]  Will the defense of racist hate crimes morph into the defense of Sharia law in America?
[01:04:35.212 --> 01:04:38.273]  A circumvention of the Constitution of the United States?
[01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:47.615]  While the treason of the mainstream media apparatus goes unchecked by the monolithic surveillance state that's purpose becomes clearer every day.
[01:04:47.955 --> 01:04:54.737]  A purpose not of the defense of the rights and safety of American citizens, but a tunnel vision purpose
[01:04:54.957 --> 01:05:03.473]  To systematically control the rights of those citizens through an ongoing rollout of an unyielding divide and conquer scheme.
[01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:05.758]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[01:05:10.632 --> 01:05:25.447]  Well, if you were too busy and didn't watch the Golden Globes last night, where liberal stars like Meryl Streep were reveling in the loss of her party and her platform, and blaming Donald Trump for picking on a, quote, handicapped reporter, here's some more fake news for you.
[01:05:25.608 --> 01:05:32.635]  The totalitarian left has decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on merits, they would just prefer to eliminate them altogether.
[01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:33.656]  The New York Times.
[01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:40.022]  In two op-ed articles on Sunday's review, the Grey Lady attacks Breitbart News and its founder.
[01:05:40.242 --> 01:05:46.849]  Rest in peace, Andrew Breitbart, encourages an effort to destroy the company by appealing directly to advertisers not to support their website.
[01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:51.213]  One article reads, quote, how to destroy the business model of Breitbart and fake news.
[01:05:51.613 --> 01:06:07.457]  Celebrating the flagging efforts of anonymous Twitter trolls who've tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News, these would-be censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views on their merits, they're just going to try to eliminate them altogether.
[01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:10.198]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:06:10.738 --> 01:06:16.899]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:06:17.419 --> 01:06:18.860]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:06:19.758 --> 01:06:21.640]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.805]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:06:28.405 --> 01:06:36.391]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:06:36.412 --> 01:06:38.873]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:06:39.154 --> 01:06:40.355]  This is the best system out there.
[01:06:40.615 --> 01:06:43.377]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:06:43.637 --> 01:06:44.378]  This is how it works.

[01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:28.671]  Rallying patriots worldwide,
[01:08:32.903 --> 01:08:35.533]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:41.152 --> 01:08:45.114]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we're 10 days away from a Trump inauguration.
[01:08:45.174 --> 01:08:47.616]  What can Donald Trump accomplish on day one?
[01:08:48.376 --> 01:08:52.958]  And just as importantly, what can they undo that Obama has done on day one?
[01:08:53.199 --> 01:09:10.228]  And of course, just two days into the 115th Congress, the House passed the Midnight Rules Relief Act, and they even had four Democrats cross the aisle to vote on that, to shut down all these last-minute regulations that Obama has been piling on us.
[01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:14.266]  And you have to understand, these are nothing but chains.
[01:09:14.926 --> 01:09:18.848]  This is why everybody is so excited about Donald Trump's election.
[01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:24.771]  It's why we have seen the massive rise in the stock market as soon as Donald Trump was declared to be the winner.
[01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:27.612]  This is why you've seen the consumer optimism.
[01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:35.106]  We know, we can feel the chains that have been forged on us by the Obama administration.
[01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:38.187]  That's what these regulations, these taxes have done.
[01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:45.670]  And so when we look at what Trump can accomplish on day one, most of it is removing the chains of Obama.
[01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:48.291]  And so they're starting out with this Midnight Rules Relief Act.
[01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:54.112]  Largely they said on a party line vote it was 238 to 184 but they had four Democrats cross the aisle.
[01:09:54.152 --> 01:10:03.273]  It will authorize Congress to overturn regulations that were finalized in the last days of the Obama administration with a single vote.
[01:10:04.314 --> 01:10:14.375]  And we already had Donald Trump and people in his, I don't know if it was Trump or somebody in his organization said any, I think it was Pence that said it when he met with the press, met with the GOP.
[01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:18.196]  He said anything that was done with a pen can be undone with a pen.
[01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:24.885]  So Donald Trump has got not only a pen and a phone, but he's got a very powerful Twitter account as well.
[01:10:25.286 --> 01:10:26.306]  And he's going to undo some things.
[01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:29.308]  So what might Donald Trump undo on day one?
[01:10:29.348 --> 01:10:30.589]  This is an article from The Hill.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.931]  Let's take a look at some of the different issues here.
[01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:39.236]  On immigration, they say, of course, Donald Trump could do away with Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
[01:10:39.976 --> 01:10:41.197]  Because Obama has been bringing in
[01:10:43.024 --> 01:10:47.626]  The equivalent of 12 middle schools a day in terms of children.
[01:10:48.146 --> 01:10:54.608]  Assuming, of course, folks, assuming, of course, that the children that are coming in are really children.
[01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:59.550]  Because you understand that DACA is a bit of a fraud.
[01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:06.257]  They call children, anybody up to the age of 31 years old, qualifies as a child.
[01:11:06.657 --> 01:11:09.160]  That's part of the lies that we've been sold by the Democrats.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:16.749]  And of course you had people like Glenn Beck going down to the border, weeping and handing out teddy bears to people, to little 8 year old kids.
[01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:18.611]  You know what, if you need a teddy bear,
[01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:26.053]  And if you're that young and that helpless, you didn't make it across Central and South America by yourself, okay?
[01:11:26.693 --> 01:11:31.195]  Let's just point out the obvious fact to Glenn Beck and the people who listen to Glenn Beck.
[01:11:31.795 --> 01:11:35.217]  This guy is a whining, crying phony.
[01:11:36.638 --> 01:11:40.119]  He upheld his false messiah, Ted Cruz.
[01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:46.422]  That alone ought to disqualify him with the religious people saying, oh, got a word from God that this guy is the messiah.
[01:11:47.522 --> 01:11:47.823]  Well,
[01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:50.165]  God doesn't lie, does he?
[01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:53.346]  And so that means that you are a false prophet.
[01:11:53.446 --> 01:11:56.747]  Among other things, we've seen him stab us in the back, stab people in the back.
[01:11:56.767 --> 01:12:06.170]  I remember the Bundy Ranch, where he came out and tried to paint Clive and Bundy and the others as sovereign citizens, stabbing them in the back along with Harry Reid, lying about what had happened there.
[01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:06.830]  He wasn't there.
[01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:07.491]  I was there.
[01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:08.471]  I knew it was a lie.
[01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:14.393]  I tell you, when you go to one of these events, and I'm sure many of you listening have been somewhere at a
[01:12:16.024 --> 01:12:30.070]  At a riot surrounding a Trump rally or something, you saw how the press lied and spun the narrative to suit their predetermined stories, and you were there, and you said, it didn't go down like that at all.
[01:12:31.274 --> 01:12:35.597]  And they're completely ignoring all this stuff that happened over here that I saw.
[01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.939]  And they're distorting what really did happen.
[01:12:39.759 --> 01:12:42.061]  And that's what we've seen these people do all along.
[01:12:42.081 --> 01:12:44.503]  But let's get back to what Donald Trump could do on day one.
[01:12:44.823 --> 01:12:49.466]  Trump could also issue directives that take direct aim at so-called sanctuary cities.
[01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:52.495]  I think that would be a great starting place.
[01:12:52.515 --> 01:12:52.875]  You know what?
[01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:54.736]  You want to be a sanctuary city, that's fine.
[01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:57.376]  But we're not going to subsidize that.
[01:12:57.396 --> 01:13:00.857]  I don't think the federal government ought to be handing out money to cities in the first place.
[01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:03.638]  So that's a good place to stop handing out money to cities.
[01:13:04.438 --> 01:13:11.299]  They take our money, just like with Social Security, they confiscate your money and then hand it back to you like a child on allowance.
[01:13:11.379 --> 01:13:15.040]  Well, we're going to say, okay, cities are going to be children on allowance.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.181]  Well, if you're not going to do what we say in terms of immigration policy, we're going to cut off your allowance.
[01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:21.347]  And you're going to have to learn to be independent.
[01:13:22.187 --> 01:13:34.533]  And maybe these cities, which are typically the big spending cities, the big liberal cities, are just going to have to raise taxes a little bit higher and drive out all the productive people out of their cities.
[01:13:34.573 --> 01:13:35.453]  We'll see what happens with that.
[01:13:35.533 --> 01:13:39.395]  On the environment, he can cancel any climate-related payments to the United Nations.
[01:13:39.555 --> 01:13:39.896]  Good.
[01:13:40.536 --> 01:13:40.776]  Good.
[01:13:40.876 --> 01:13:47.319]  And put that money instead, as they point out on the Hill, put that money instead to domestic infrastructure projects.
[01:13:47.919 --> 01:13:49.020]  That's what needs to be done.
[01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:50.919]  Unleash the coal industry.
[01:13:51.039 --> 01:13:53.420]  Roll back Obama's energy regulations.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.421]  On lobbying, Trump could enact his proposed lobbying ban on day one.
[01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:00.602]  And when he talks about draining the swamp, this is what he's talking about.
[01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:10.404]  Policies that would prevent anyone who accepts a political appointment in the Trump administration from registering as a lobbyist within five years of leaving office.
[01:14:11.024 --> 01:14:15.105]  Appointees would also be permanently barred from lobbying for foreign governments.
[01:14:16.246 --> 01:14:17.486]  That's a great idea.
[01:14:18.464 --> 01:14:24.350]  And that's one of the ways that you make sure that people who are in this, just to play the political game, don't get into it.
[01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:31.096]  I think that's a very important thing that has been put out there by Donald Trump saying that he would do that and I hope he will do that on day one.
[01:14:31.136 --> 01:14:32.457]  That's something he could do on day one.
[01:14:32.497 --> 01:14:34.759]  I think he's going to do a lot of things on day one.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:43.408]  On trade, Trump in a video vowed to issue a notification of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, which we are not in.
[01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.899]  John Kerry signed it, but it hasn't been approved by the Senate.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.021]  And it is a treaty, folks.
[01:14:50.121 --> 01:14:59.467]  Even though they rammed through, with the help of people like Ted Cruz, the Trade Promotion Authority, to say, we're not going to treat this as a treaty.
[01:14:59.487 --> 01:15:00.768]  We're going to pretend that it's not a treaty.
[01:15:00.868 --> 01:15:05.712]  Even though, when you look at NAFTA, you know, they called it the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:08.331]  You can call it a trade agreement.
[01:15:08.751 --> 01:15:09.953]  You can call it a partnership.
[01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:13.015]  You can call it cotton candy, but it's still a treaty.
[01:15:13.336 --> 01:15:13.596]  Okay?
[01:15:14.056 --> 01:15:19.901]  A treaty is an agreement between two countries on economic and trade issues or war issues.
[01:15:20.262 --> 01:15:21.783]  It's an agreement between multiple countries.
[01:15:21.823 --> 01:15:25.787]  And if it's an agreement between multiple countries, it's a treaty by definition.
[01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:30.311]  And we have a process in the Constitution for dealing with treaties, but you had people
[01:15:30.911 --> 01:15:42.974]  In the GOP establishment and in the Democrat establishment who said we're going to ignore what the Constitution says about ratifying treaties, say that you need to have two-thirds of the Senate ratify that treaty, and we're going to say no, no.
[01:15:43.254 --> 01:15:51.496]  We're going to have just a simple majority in the Senate and a simple majority in the House, and once this treaty comes to these bodies, they're going to have to go to the floor.
[01:15:51.536 --> 01:15:53.616]  There's not going to be any procedural blocking of it.
[01:15:53.696 --> 01:15:56.057]  There will be no discussion, no debate, no amendment.
[01:15:56.617 --> 01:15:57.737]  There will be no filibusters.
[01:15:58.356 --> 01:16:00.642]  We will have a vote on it and that's it.
[01:16:01.143 --> 01:16:04.872]  Within 20 days we're going to have a vote on it when it comes up and it's going to be a simple majority vote.
[01:16:05.253 --> 01:16:06.797]  That is not what the Constitution says.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:15.245]  And that law, if they ever do something like that, if they do it with Trump or if they do it with his successor, we need to take that to the Supreme Court.
[01:16:15.845 --> 01:16:23.349]  And we need to say, at some point, you have to say that the Constitution matters or you need to stop taking your phony oaths to it when you take office.
[01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:28.512]  Nevertheless, he can, and he's called the TPP a potential disaster for our country.
[01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:28.833]  It is.
[01:16:28.913 --> 01:16:32.795]  He could notify that we're withdrawing that signature by John Kerry.
[01:16:33.599 --> 01:16:34.740]  On January the 20th.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:39.384]  He could also move forward with his plan to negotiate, renegotiate, or to withdraw from NAFTA.
[01:16:39.685 --> 01:16:41.626]  And again, as I pointed out, they called it a trade agreement.
[01:16:41.767 --> 01:16:50.955]  If you go to some of the lawyers that handle the arbitration cases, that's what they specialize in, they will say, our specialty is treaty law.
[01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:52.897]  Because they work on NAFTA.
[01:16:53.959 --> 01:17:06.145]  And what they do is they have an arbitration process where the corporations have equal clout to the countries involved and billions of dollars have been handed out in these arbitration processes.
[01:17:06.185 --> 01:17:09.567]  They repeat that in the TPP, but the TPP has far more problems with it.
[01:17:10.207 --> 01:17:16.412]  And they point out, again, that to change these agreements would be something they'd have to get Congress involved in.
[01:17:16.452 --> 01:17:18.593]  But he could provide written notice.
[01:17:18.613 --> 01:17:24.057]  The text of NAFTA says any party can withdraw within six months of providing written notice.
[01:17:24.077 --> 01:17:29.341]  So he could provide written notice ten days from now, and then within six months we could be out of NAFTA.
[01:17:30.003 --> 01:17:35.188]  On healthcare, Trump could expand allowing people to keep cheap plans that otherwise might not qualify for inclusion under the law.
[01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:39.051]  See, Obama is going to tell you, a lot of people were happy with the insurance that they had.
[01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:39.531]  Remember that?
[01:17:39.952 --> 01:17:40.672]  You like your insurance?
[01:17:40.692 --> 01:17:41.613]  You can keep your insurance?
[01:17:41.653 --> 01:17:43.175]  And then we found out, no you can't.
[01:17:44.215 --> 01:17:46.717]  He's going to load you up with a lot of options that you don't need.
[01:17:46.757 --> 01:17:52.082]  If you're a single male, you might have to buy insurance that has a maternity clause in it.
[01:17:52.162 --> 01:17:57.647]  And you may have to pay extra so that in case you, as a single male, get pregnant, you will be covered.
[01:17:58.848 --> 01:18:01.050]  See, you don't have a choice.
[01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.231]  They remove that choice.
[01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:09.037]  And so if you look at Donald Trump's website where he was talking about issues, he had a very detailed process there.
[01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.618]  He was going to give people a choice.
[01:18:11.638 --> 01:18:12.318]  Not a mandate.
[01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:13.499]  A marketplace.
[01:18:13.559 --> 01:18:14.179]  Not a mandate.
[01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:17.580]  You would have economic power to make these choices.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.441]  You would have information to make those choices.
[01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:22.001]  You would have competition between insurance companies.
[01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:25.423]  You would have information about the healthcare providers.
[01:18:26.683 --> 01:18:27.443]  Cost information.
[01:18:27.523 --> 01:18:28.864]  All that stuff should be there.
[01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:31.305]  Those were the things that were broken about our system.
[01:18:31.325 --> 01:18:34.966]  See, we didn't have a marketplace in healthcare to start with.
[01:18:35.788 --> 01:18:55.377]  The problem with healthcare was largely due to too much government involvement, and what Obama did was to double and triple and quadruple down on that involvement rather than to remove it, rather than to move us to a situation where we had information, where maybe we get a tax credit so that before we send our money to the federal government,
[01:18:56.246 --> 01:19:00.672]  Maybe we could use it to buy things that are vital for us like health care, like education.
[01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:02.835]  They always want to say those are the most important things.
[01:19:02.855 --> 01:19:09.545]  Well then, let us buy it for ourselves first before you send the money to you and you hand it back to us like children on allowance.
[01:19:10.266 --> 01:19:13.250]  So basically he could also render the penalty for not having
[01:19:14.713 --> 01:19:18.816]  mandated insurance to the level that Obama wants to have you get that insurance.
[01:19:18.836 --> 01:19:20.057]  Maybe he could remove that penalty.
[01:19:20.097 --> 01:19:21.278]  He could do that on day one as well.
[01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:24.681]  He could also reverse the requirement that insurers cover contraception.
[01:19:24.701 --> 01:19:30.406]  That would be viewed as a major victory and also by religious conservatives, they point out.
[01:19:30.446 --> 01:19:39.193]  He could also take aim at the nation's abortion laws by reversing one of Obama's executive orders that barred states from withholding federal funds from Planned Parenthood.
[01:19:39.313 --> 01:19:42.075]  So those are a lot of things that Donald Trump could do.
[01:19:42.095 --> 01:19:44.077]  I expect that he's going to do those.
[01:19:44.797 --> 01:19:45.478]  A good number of those.
[01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:47.940]  He may do a lot of other things as well on day one.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.081]  He is going to hit the ground running.
[01:19:49.121 --> 01:19:52.525]  See, Barack Obama loves to party with Hollywood.
[01:19:53.465 --> 01:19:55.347]  But Donald Trump's not going to have all those balls.
[01:19:55.407 --> 01:20:02.354]  Instead, he's got a couple, he's going to have a pair of brass ones that we're going to see come out on January the 20th.
[01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:03.455]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:20:10.254 --> 01:20:20.301]  Now most of you know that the mainstream media has been very critical of anyone suggesting that Barack Obama's birth certificate might be a fraud.
[01:20:20.621 --> 01:20:22.862]  And believe me, they got the memo.
[01:20:23.162 --> 01:20:25.824]  I'm talking about the people who work for the mainstream media.
[01:20:26.124 --> 01:20:29.667]  They know that Obama's birth certificate is off limits.
[01:20:30.287 --> 01:20:31.048]  You don't go there.
[01:20:31.448 --> 01:20:35.673]  Unless, of course, someone like Donald Trump shows up and starts asking questions.
[01:20:36.273 --> 01:20:46.083]  Or if Alex Jones brings it up, that's when the establishment media goes into full attack mode and they come to Obama's rescue.
[01:20:46.784 --> 01:20:58.550]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:03.812]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the internet.
[01:21:03.972 --> 01:21:11.496]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[01:21:11.996 --> 01:21:13.637]  Take President Obama's birth.
[01:21:14.117 --> 01:21:15.838]  Trump comes along and said,
[01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:17.699]  Birth certificate.
[01:21:17.999 --> 01:21:19.161]  He gave a birth certificate.
[01:21:19.461 --> 01:21:24.967]  Whether or not that was a real certificate, because a lot of people question it, I certainly question it.
[01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:33.331]  Now, I want you all to listen very carefully because what I'm about to say is very important and I want to be clear so there's no misunderstanding.
[01:21:34.352 --> 01:21:40.980]  We are not saying that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States and that he is not a U.S.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.420]  citizen.
[01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:47.366]  We're not even claiming that Communist Frank Marshall Davis is Barack Obama's father.
[01:21:48.027 --> 01:21:49.268]  Fact is, we just don't know.
[01:21:49.828 --> 01:21:54.953]  I personally believe Obama's father is Frank Marshall Davis, but this investigation does not prove that.
[01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:58.035]  What we do know is significant.
[01:21:58.515 --> 01:22:08.703]  Forensic evidence proves without a doubt that the official birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the President of the United States, is a fake.
[01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:17.070]  As far as the document is concerned, we had two different forensic experts, two different disciplines, two different continents, review our information.
[01:22:17.586 --> 01:22:19.207]  It all came to the same conclusion.
[01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.948]  The document is completely fraudulent.
[01:22:21.088 --> 01:22:21.968]  It's inauthentic.
[01:22:22.508 --> 01:22:24.189]  It's not what it represents itself to be.
[01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:27.170]  What does this say about the mainstream news media?
[01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:32.173]  Because we've been covering this for a long time and they refuse to follow this.
[01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:37.515]  And I still, I expected at least a little more participation after this press conference.
[01:22:37.915 --> 01:22:39.436]  Why do you think they're not talking about it?
[01:22:40.116 --> 01:22:41.677]  Well, this information is devastating.
[01:22:42.319 --> 01:22:54.382]  And what you have to realize is this goes directly to document fraud and a fraudulent document being offered to the American people during an election cycle as evidence that I am good to go, you can vote for me.
[01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:55.783]  It's a federal offense, am I right?
[01:22:56.283 --> 01:22:59.183]  Oh my god, there's numerous federal offenses under Title 18.
[01:22:59.484 --> 01:23:01.884]  Somebody's looking at 40 years, somewhere along the line.
[01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:03.885]  You're not going to be able to refute this document.
[01:23:04.425 --> 01:23:04.925]  It's a fraud.
[01:23:10.197 --> 01:23:15.460]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.581]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:23.285]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:25.826]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:23:26.186 --> 01:23:32.370]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:37.793]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:23:48.632 --> 01:23:51.373]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:23:52.234 --> 01:23:53.694]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:23:54.355 --> 01:23:56.295]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:23:56.616 --> 01:24:00.818]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:04.299]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:24:04.379 --> 01:24:05.920]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:24:21.726 --> 01:24:23.029]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.069 --> 01:24:23.591]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:23.611 --> 01:24:27.059]  We're going to go back and take a look at some other things that may be coming with Donald Trump.
[01:24:27.079 --> 01:24:29.886]  One of the things that I look forward to is...
[01:24:31.007 --> 01:24:35.970]  There's talk that there's going to be legislation to make gun silencers legal.
[01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:37.211]  This is Donald Trump Jr.
[01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:38.652]  joining with silencer makers.
[01:24:38.772 --> 01:24:40.833]  I would welcome that and I'll tell you why.
[01:24:40.853 --> 01:24:45.256]  It's not the scary thing that we've seen Hollywood put out there.
[01:24:45.976 --> 01:24:48.578]  Silencers are not really silent folks.
[01:24:48.938 --> 01:24:50.339]  You can still hear them quite a bit.
[01:24:50.939 --> 01:25:03.587]  But it doesn't destroy people's hearings, hearing when they fire the guns, and hearing protection is something that is cumbersome and less than desirable to have to wear that when you're shooting a gun.
[01:25:03.727 --> 01:25:05.007]  So that's what that's really about.
[01:25:05.027 --> 01:25:11.371]  We'll talk about that and some other things, but before we do I just want to remind you again that we have the Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[01:25:11.391 --> 01:25:12.812]  That's our 2017.
[01:25:13.452 --> 01:25:16.054]  If you have a resolution here that you want to get healthier this year,
[01:25:16.714 --> 01:25:28.723]  Now is the time to start, and start with a good base of nutritional support, a good base of protection against the toxic garbage in the food, the water, the air that we constantly have at every level.
[01:25:28.743 --> 01:25:29.964]  We're under chemical siege.
[01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.766]  It makes us fat, it makes us sick, it makes us dumbed down.
[01:25:32.806 --> 01:25:37.770]  You can do things to reverse that by making sure that you give your body the nutrition that it needs.
[01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:39.111]  And so, to help you do that,

[01:26:24.992 --> 01:26:26.313]  Inventory situation is going to be like.
[01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:30.976]  So Alex has given massive discounts to people who sign up for AutoShip.

[01:26:45.944 --> 01:26:47.205]  So a great thing to look at.
[01:26:47.325 --> 01:26:50.407]  Take a look at the sales that are on InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:26:50.447 --> 01:26:52.148]  We really appreciate your support.
[01:26:52.168 --> 01:26:53.529]  We could not do this without you.
[01:26:54.281 --> 01:26:56.143]  Let's take a look at some of the things that are coming up again.
[01:26:56.163 --> 01:27:02.630]  Of course, tomorrow, Barack Obama is going to go to Chicago to tout his success over the last eight years.
[01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:03.470]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:27:04.271 --> 01:27:08.275]  As we talked about over the weekend, there's a story on Breitbart.
[01:27:08.696 --> 01:27:16.284]  They pointed out that Chicago gun deaths in Chicago under Obama's watch, in the eight years that he was there,
[01:27:17.153 --> 01:27:20.834]  are about the same number of people that died during the Iraq war under Bush.
[01:27:20.854 --> 01:27:26.136]  There were 4,229 Americans who died in Iraq under Bush during the wars.
[01:27:26.216 --> 01:27:35.840]  And yet, with Obama in Chicago, there have been 3,903 murders in the eight years that he's been in office.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.100]  See, that's gun control for you.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:38.981]  It didn't work.
[01:27:39.701 --> 01:27:42.282]  Instead, it's turned that place into a killing zone.
[01:27:43.285 --> 01:27:43.445]  I think?
[01:27:58.305 --> 01:27:58.365]  See?
[01:27:58.425 --> 01:27:59.185]  That's using Hollywood.
[01:28:19.696 --> 01:28:27.123]  The fake stuff that Hollywood sells you about guns, and the stuff that Washington Post and the mainstream media puts out there, okay?
[01:28:27.143 --> 01:28:28.665]  And as I point out, it's not silent!
[01:28:29.616 --> 01:28:32.177]  It's a pretty loud noise if you listen to most of these silencers.
[01:28:32.217 --> 01:28:36.199]  They have a pretty loud clicking noise, so you're still going to hear that.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.401]  This is the Hearing Protection Act.
[01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:40.261]  It's been introduced before in the House.
[01:28:40.722 --> 01:28:42.603]  This time they believe it may go through.
[01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:49.206]  It would end treating silencers like machine guns and hand grenades, because they're not that dangerous, folks.
[01:28:50.026 --> 01:28:53.508]  And even when you had the shooting in Fort Lauderdale, we had one guy talking about it.
[01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.909]  He says, you know, I heard some pops going off.
[01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:57.450]  I didn't really think about it.
[01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:58.151]  I saw people
[01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:01.633]  Falling around me, I still didn't really realize what it was.
[01:29:01.693 --> 01:29:03.835]  I started smelling smoke and I still didn't know what it was.
[01:29:03.855 --> 01:29:06.377]  It took him a while to understand what was going on.
[01:29:06.417 --> 01:29:08.038]  There wasn't any silencer on that pistol.
[01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:10.500]  And it isn't going to make it any more dangerous.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.660]  That's not the problem.
[01:29:12.621 --> 01:29:17.405]  The problems, and we've talked about this before, the problems are the gun-free shooting zones.
[01:29:17.425 --> 01:29:24.190]  And as I pointed out yesterday, and we'll be talking to the person who introduced the legislation in Florida just a couple of days before that happened,
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:31.307]  We had a piece of legislation introduced in Florida that said we've got to stop these gun-free killing zones.
[01:29:32.008 --> 01:29:33.750]  They are disarmament zones.
[01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:39.577]  They create victims and he was very prophetic in what he had to say because it was just a few days later that this happened.
[01:29:40.018 --> 01:29:40.999]  Now of course people are going to say,
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:46.664]  That tells us that we've got to be even more careful and not have guns in the airport.
[01:29:46.704 --> 01:29:50.246]  She will never get them out of there, just like we saw in Chicago.
[01:29:50.306 --> 01:29:50.786]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.087 --> 01:29:51.847]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.927 --> 01:29:56.891]  Alex Jones has a special comment on Meryl Streep, our favorite actress today.
[01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:57.792]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.793 --> 01:30:00.694]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.194 --> 01:30:02.795]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.716 --> 01:30:06.398]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.373 --> 01:30:15.116]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[01:30:15.316 --> 01:30:22.459]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.041]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:31.126]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[01:30:31.647 --> 01:30:42.057]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[01:30:42.197 --> 01:30:42.457]  Boom!
[01:30:42.878 --> 01:30:46.301]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[01:30:46.781 --> 01:30:47.942]  Then, by early 2016,
[01:30:49.984 --> 01:30:53.326]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[01:30:53.346 --> 01:30:54.427]  But the election heated up.
[01:30:54.467 --> 01:30:56.868]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:30:56.968 --> 01:31:06.214]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:31:06.434 --> 01:31:07.394]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[01:31:07.574 --> 01:31:11.257]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:31:12.077 --> 01:31:18.123]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[01:31:18.163 --> 01:31:19.504]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[01:31:19.564 --> 01:31:23.128]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:31.749]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:38.573]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[01:31:38.973 --> 01:31:39.493]  It's amazing.
[01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.175]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:45.156]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:53.941]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount, it's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie, I ate a candy bar last night,
[01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:58.513]  And quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[01:31:58.953 --> 01:32:00.214]  So I'm eating worse.
[01:32:00.834 --> 01:32:08.220]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[01:32:08.381 --> 01:32:08.881]  It's incredible.
[01:32:09.922 --> 01:32:11.863]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[01:32:12.084 --> 01:32:13.345]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[01:32:13.465 --> 01:32:15.867]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[01:32:16.467 --> 01:32:17.348]  This is an experiment.
[01:32:17.468 --> 01:32:18.209]  Everybody's watching.
[01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:19.289]  We'll see what happens.
[01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:20.610]  This is Part 2.
[01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:25.321]  Well, here we are.
[01:32:25.361 --> 01:32:26.442]  Another week has passed.
[01:32:27.062 --> 01:32:39.147]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[01:32:39.187 --> 01:32:41.128]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[01:32:41.588 --> 01:32:42.508]  I've lost a pound.
[01:32:43.008 --> 01:32:43.789]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[01:32:45.549 --> 01:32:49.712]  And I've only got a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[01:32:49.732 --> 01:32:51.354]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[01:32:51.394 --> 01:32:53.455]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:59.000]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.002]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[01:33:02.102 --> 01:33:03.684]  Let's see what happens next week.
[01:33:24.179 --> 01:33:30.477]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.432 --> 01:33:39.114]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.174 --> 01:33:41.436]  I'm going to have a special report from Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:42.557]  He is not here today.
[01:33:42.577 --> 01:33:44.399]  He's on a well-deserved vacation.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:50.345]  But he could not help but comment on what happened with the Golden Globes last night with Meryl Streep.
[01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:52.487]  So we're going to have those comments from him in just a few moments.
[01:33:52.568 --> 01:34:00.275]  Before we get to that, I was interested to see this report from the New York Daily News, a very liberal paper in New York City.
[01:34:01.127 --> 01:34:09.041]  Bemoaning the fact that a Chinese restaurant that was beloved by people in the area called China Fun has shut down.
[01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:11.405]  And they blamed over-regulation.
[01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:12.607]  And as I read this article,
[01:34:14.205 --> 01:34:18.409]  I thought as a small businessman, of course, my father was a small businessman.
[01:34:18.489 --> 01:34:20.411]  Both of my grandfathers were small businessmen.
[01:34:20.431 --> 01:34:23.534]  They had what you would call mom-and-pop businesses.
[01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:28.358]  They were very prosperous, but they were not millionaires by any means.
[01:34:28.558 --> 01:34:31.881]  They're not even close to it, but they supported families comfortably.
[01:34:32.742 --> 01:34:38.005]  The sort of thing, as I looked at what they did, I looked at it and said, you know what, they've shut that business down for me.
[01:34:38.085 --> 01:34:45.589]  I eventually got into a business that hadn't been shut down, but eventually the government gets around to shutting down every new industry as it comes up.
[01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:47.810]  And this is what the people at China Fund said.
[01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:52.513]  They said, for 25 years, China Fund was renowned for its peerless soup dumplings and its General Tso chicken.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:35:03.317]  What left a bad taste in the mouth of its owners and loyal patrons was the restaurant's sudden closing, blamed by management on suffocating government demands.
[01:35:03.377 --> 01:35:17.187]  They said, the climate for small business like ours in New York, and this is not just New York, this is everywhere, but New York is absolutely the worst, have become such that it's difficult to justify taking risks and running, never mind even starting, a legitimate mom-and-pop business.
[01:35:17.207 --> 01:35:19.388]  When we started out in 1991, the lunch special was $4 a plate,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:22.940]  Now it's $10 or $12.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.081]  The cost of doing business is just too onerous.
[01:35:26.222 --> 01:35:28.162]  And then they tell you why the cost has gone up.
[01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:35.665]  They cite one regulation where a restaurant was required to provide an on-site break room for workers despite the fact they had limited space.
[01:35:36.425 --> 01:35:41.847]  He blamed the amount of paperwork now required as an increasingly difficult task for a non-chain business.
[01:35:41.887 --> 01:35:46.789]  He said in one restaurant operation like ours you're spending more time on paperwork than you are trying to run your business.
[01:35:48.001 --> 01:35:49.742]  That's the complaint that everybody has.
[01:35:50.002 --> 01:35:55.326]  The amount of paperwork that is involved, and the legal entrapment that it creates.
[01:35:55.366 --> 01:36:05.573]  And then once you fall into that trap, the never-ending compounding fees and fines for not complying with it in the way that they wanted it to be done.
[01:36:05.633 --> 01:36:10.956]  He said increases in minimum wage, health insurance, added to the list of issues that were provided.
[01:36:10.996 --> 01:36:14.499]  He says, I haven't even gone into the health department rules and regulations.
[01:36:14.559 --> 01:36:17.581]  And when I look at that, and you look at what's going on in Venezuela,
[01:36:18.261 --> 01:36:21.724]  This is the Democrat program for prosperity.
[01:36:21.784 --> 01:36:23.826]  Let's give everybody a minimum wage increase.
[01:36:24.366 --> 01:36:27.748]  They've had five minimum wage increases in Venezuela.
[01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:31.832]  They have increased the minimum wage in those five increases in one year.
[01:36:32.012 --> 01:36:33.173]  Five increases by 322%.
[01:36:35.325 --> 01:36:55.879]  Now the government's official inflation figure is 181% for the year but opposition says that it is more than 500% and I would believe them because this is where people have to go to multiple ATMs to get enough cash put in their wheelbarrow so they can go around the department stores or the grocery stores if they still have anything left on the shelves.
[01:36:56.707 --> 01:36:58.549]  And they talk about the minimum monthly salary.
[01:36:58.589 --> 01:36:59.590]  They say, well, it's $60.
[01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:03.434]  That's what communism has brought these people in Venezuela.
[01:37:03.834 --> 01:37:10.460]  A place rich in natural resources that was confiscated by Hugo Chavez and then turned over to his cronies.
[01:37:11.742 --> 01:37:14.765]  $60 a month is what they're making, but that's at the government's level.
[01:37:15.325 --> 01:37:16.926]  The reality is, on the black market, it's $12.
[01:37:17.386 --> 01:37:20.968]  And I remember a book by Jim Rogers, it was called Investment Biker.
[01:37:21.548 --> 01:37:28.372]  He drove around the world on a motorcycle so that he could get a close look at things and just comment on what he saw in different places.
[01:37:28.432 --> 01:37:36.256]  And one of the key insights that he had was, he said he would look at the spread between the official government exchange rate and what you could get on the black market.
[01:37:36.336 --> 01:37:38.177]  And he said, that's an index of the corruption.
[01:37:38.217 --> 01:37:41.919]  So here you have, in Venezuela, a spread of five times.
[01:37:42.739 --> 01:37:47.842]  Five times the price on the government exchange level than you'll get at the black market.
[01:37:48.042 --> 01:37:52.184]  That is what the government, what the Democrats offer us for prosperity.
[01:37:52.644 --> 01:37:54.525]  An increase in the minimum wage.
[01:37:55.426 --> 01:37:57.287]  It's just printing phony money.
[01:37:58.047 --> 01:38:12.075]  And you can see everything that the Democrat, the entire Democrat policy, economic policy of Hillary Clinton, of Barack Obama, of Chuck Schumer, and especially Bernie Sanders, you can see the fruit of it in Venezuela.
[01:38:12.395 --> 01:38:13.976]  The hyperinflation that you see right there.
[01:38:14.336 --> 01:38:25.362]  And even before this started, several years ago, we were told, they bragged about the fact, the bankers did, that they had gotten a return of 700% return on investment from Venezuela.
[01:38:26.223 --> 01:38:30.825]  They said Madura as well as Hugo Chavez understand the banks get paid first.
[01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:36.326]  See, they are not a counter to the bankers.
[01:38:36.446 --> 01:38:38.647]  They are their handmaids.
[01:38:39.467 --> 01:38:40.948]  Just as Lennon was.
[01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:43.729]  Now I want to go to this Alex Jones report.
[01:38:43.769 --> 01:38:49.591]  He wanted to comment on the amazing things that were done last night at the Golden Globes with Meryl Streep.
[01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:50.431]  Here's Alex Jones.
[01:38:52.694 --> 01:38:59.875]  An actor's only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like.
[01:39:00.436 --> 01:39:04.956]  And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that.
[01:39:05.076 --> 01:39:06.637]  Breathtaking, compassionate work.
[01:39:07.477 --> 01:39:10.417]  But there was one performance this year that stunned me.
[01:39:11.638 --> 01:39:13.678]  It sank its hooks in my heart.
[01:39:14.358 --> 01:39:15.378]  Not because it was good.
[01:39:16.539 --> 01:39:18.079]  There was nothing good about it.
[01:39:19.547 --> 01:39:21.433]  But it was effective and it did its job.
[01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:25.706]  It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth.
[01:39:27.443 --> 01:39:36.907]  It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter.
[01:39:37.888 --> 01:39:43.830]  Someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back.
[01:39:45.111 --> 01:39:49.913]  It kind of broke my heart when I saw it.
[01:39:50.033 --> 01:39:52.734]  I still can't get it out of my head because it wasn't in a movie.
[01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:53.875]  It was real life.
[01:39:55.731 --> 01:40:05.534]  And this instinct to humiliate when it's modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful.
[01:40:05.574 --> 01:40:11.477]  It filters down into everybody's life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.
[01:40:14.097 --> 01:40:16.578]  Disrespect invites disrespect.
[01:40:16.638 --> 01:40:19.179]  Violence incites violence.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:23.861]  When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.520]  Okay, go up with that thing.
[01:40:28.661 --> 01:40:30.141]  Okay, this brings me to the press.
[01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:39.123]  We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage.
[01:40:39.143 --> 01:40:48.445]  A lot of people say, hey, ignore Hollywood, they're nobodies, they've lost almost all credibility.
[01:40:49.145 --> 01:40:50.165]  And I tend to agree with them.
[01:40:51.209 --> 01:40:59.753]  But it's also important to point out what hypocritical, fraudulent liars they are, and how truly dangerous and despicable they are.
[01:41:00.434 --> 01:41:15.922]  Because even though they've lost much of their former power, they could still, like a cancer, if not completely cut out, completely burned away politically, completely ignored, completely thrown on the ash heap of history, that cancer could always grow back and then metastasize again.
[01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:17.905]  Take Meryl Streep.
[01:41:19.226 --> 01:41:22.207]  A total, absolute nobody her entire career.
[01:41:22.647 --> 01:41:24.768]  A darling of the inside, ultra left.
[01:41:25.369 --> 01:41:27.109]  Good ol' boy, good ol' girls club.
[01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:30.151]  Who is one of the worst actors I've ever seen in my life.
[01:41:30.231 --> 01:41:32.732]  She is a complete joke as an actress.
[01:41:34.153 --> 01:41:38.414]  Since I was a kid, I couldn't stand seeing her on TV and films.
[01:41:38.474 --> 01:41:39.595]  It always changed the channel.
[01:41:40.175 --> 01:41:41.636]  And then here comes this fraud.
[01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:44.417]  Perched up there on one of these stupid award shows.
[01:41:44.737 --> 01:41:46.398]  Where these peacocks give each other awards.
[01:41:48.183 --> 01:41:56.987]  Saying that Donald Trump is persecuting journalists and all teary-eyed, and we have to come together to battle against this great authoritarian threat.
[01:41:58.928 --> 01:41:59.429]  Think about it.
[01:42:00.469 --> 01:42:09.074]  Even top liberal professors, law professors like Turley, have come out and pointed out that Obama was three times worse than Bush.
[01:42:09.514 --> 01:42:12.135]  This was just two years into his first administration.
[01:42:13.316 --> 01:42:17.318]  Was worse than Bush when it came to the press, and when it came to going after whistleblowers.
[01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:20.134]  And persecuting independent journalists.
[01:42:20.654 --> 01:42:28.059]  Now, it got much worse after that, and Turley just said he was the worst in history, worse than all presidents before him combined.
[01:42:28.999 --> 01:42:29.620]  Combined.
[01:42:31.055 --> 01:42:40.258]  Prosecuting, jailing journalists, jailing whistleblowers that expose legitimate corruption, attempting to intimidate and annihilate the press.
[01:42:40.278 --> 01:42:50.262]  And then you have Cass Sunstein at the White House, who for Harvard and for Chicago Business School wrote two different papers in the three years before he got into office in 2008.
[01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:53.441]  His regulations are.
[01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:55.844]  The guy that comes up with the laws that the president pushes.
[01:42:56.605 --> 01:42:59.149]  Cass Sunstein said, let's tax conspiracy theories.
[01:42:59.529 --> 01:43:01.912]  Let's tax news we don't agree with.
[01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:05.577]  And he says, as an example, some people say you need sun.
[01:43:06.801 --> 01:43:13.045]  Let's find people and have the IRS go after them if they say that moderate sunlight's good for you.
[01:43:13.565 --> 01:43:15.547]  He chose something that's not debatable.
[01:43:16.367 --> 01:43:18.269]  Unless you're an albino, then no sun is good.
[01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:24.493]  He chose something that was not debatable to set the precedent there, God.
[01:43:24.933 --> 01:43:28.015]  Like, don't say father or mother when you're in public school.
[01:43:28.295 --> 01:43:29.476]  Someone might not have a father or mother.
[01:43:29.856 --> 01:43:30.797]  Sounds outrageous.
[01:43:32.393 --> 01:43:33.636]  It's meant to be outrageous.
[01:43:33.736 --> 01:43:37.063]  They're moving the Overton window to break our will.
[01:43:37.604 --> 01:43:39.989]  So, I'm sitting there watching this clip this morning.
[01:43:41.857 --> 01:43:43.038]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:43:43.858 --> 01:43:45.299]  And there's three different articles on the site.
[01:43:45.339 --> 01:43:49.700]  Maybe I missed it, but nobody pointed out that everything she says is the inverse.
[01:43:50.401 --> 01:43:54.722]  Sure, they pointed out she's a fraud, she's a joke, and, you know, Hollywood's a bunch of scum.
[01:43:55.302 --> 01:44:04.786]  But the bigger issue here is, is that she's saying that Trump has persecuted the press, and then she goes on to say he wants to keep foreigners out of the country.
[01:44:05.106 --> 01:44:06.447]  That would kick his wife out.
[01:44:06.507 --> 01:44:07.687]  One of the articles does point that out.
[01:44:08.247 --> 01:44:08.748]  Steve Watson.
[01:44:10.001 --> 01:44:12.442]  That would kick his wife out of the country.
[01:44:13.523 --> 01:44:16.524]  No, he's all for people coming here who aren't felons.
[01:44:17.205 --> 01:44:17.885]  Felons.
[01:44:19.166 --> 01:44:28.490]  When you fly to Germany, or Russia, or to Timbuktu, or to anywhere in Latin America, anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world, they check your background.
[01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:29.431]  You have to have a visa.
[01:44:30.444 --> 01:44:34.730]  If you're a felon coming out of the country, an aggravated felon, you don't get in, you get turned away.
[01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:43.122]  But in an upside-down world, Hollywood, these sickeningly rich, disconnected people that are so anti-Christian, so anti-human...
[01:44:44.358 --> 01:44:58.762]  That this Silicon Valley chief is on Infowars.com today saying that he won't have any jobs or any businesses set up in the Midwest because it's a bunch of racist, filthy scum and how much he hates us and what trash we are.
[01:44:59.442 --> 01:45:12.846]  These people are totally cloistered and totally compartmentalized, living in their own worlds, literally hating those of us that want to be self-sufficient and who can skin a buck around a trot line.
[01:45:13.386 --> 01:45:19.709]  And they literally think, those of us that live in Texas, when Californians and people come here, they go, I thought you ride horses to work.
[01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:22.371]  No, folks, NASA is based here, okay?
[01:45:23.051 --> 01:45:26.413]  You people, I'm not bashing Californians in general or New Yorkers.
[01:45:26.673 --> 01:45:28.154]  We all know who we're talking about, okay?
[01:45:29.034 --> 01:45:31.656]  Just like there are some weird hillbillies in Texas, but they're the minority.
[01:45:31.896 --> 01:45:37.599]  Well, there's some frickin' weirdos in the richest areas of Manhattan and places like LA and San Francisco.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:45.643]  Who have been taught by the media that their enemy is basically Christian gun-owning Americans.
[01:45:45.863 --> 01:45:49.745]  Because, again, that's the only group the globalists haven't conquered with their fake culture.
[01:45:50.205 --> 01:46:01.692]  And all over the country, all over the world, I am seeing in the streets and on the ground and in everyday life, but also in the culture wars, in the media, that the sexiest, hottest thing out there
[01:46:03.153 --> 01:46:11.119]  For liberals, is to actually go out and start shooting guns, go out and get a four-wheel truck, go out and start camping, go out and plant their own, you know, farm.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.182]  It's not even conservative that they're discovering.
[01:46:14.242 --> 01:46:18.206]  They're just discovering being human again, and being somewhat self-sufficient.
[01:46:18.586 --> 01:46:28.915]  And women, in droves, the hottest trends for the last decade are, they're running from metrosexuals, and what the global has tried to force-feed, and going back towards real men.
[01:46:30.659 --> 01:46:35.593]  So Donald Trump is riding a huge wave of awakening all over the world.
[01:46:36.114 --> 01:46:38.280]  Not just of nationalism, not just of populism.
[01:46:39.266 --> 01:46:40.727]  But of real men.
[01:46:41.727 --> 01:46:43.308]  And Donald Trump understands this.
[01:46:43.869 --> 01:46:50.132]  Donald Trump understands there's an assault on men, that there's an attempt to extinct men in this country.
[01:46:51.192 --> 01:47:04.160]  Donald Trump understands that it's key for people to see an example that stands up against Hollywood, and calls their bluff, and calls their propaganda, and then shows how pathetic they are when someone actually calls their bluff.
[01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:06.930]  And that's what Trump is doing.
[01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:10.472]  Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Trump told me that.
[01:47:10.932 --> 01:47:13.293]  The media would have too much fun with it and I'm not going to give them anything.
[01:47:15.014 --> 01:47:22.058]  But let me just guarantee you this, ladies and gentlemen, Trump's got ten times the knowledge he's even showing right now.
[01:47:22.499 --> 01:47:29.342]  And he is absolutely trumping them in a royal flush of ace of spades.
[01:47:29.723 --> 01:47:31.524]  It is so beautiful.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.481]  to see this happening and to see them panicking.
[01:47:34.521 --> 01:47:43.005]  You notice, I'm going to cover this more in the next hour with David, you notice, ladies and gentlemen, that they're now saying the Republicans have the votes to repeal Obamacare.
[01:47:43.545 --> 01:47:45.946]  It was impossible, but the bluff got called.
[01:47:46.887 --> 01:47:54.250]  You now notice, oh, he's got the votes to build the wall and he does have a small tariff plan on money transfers that even 10%
[01:47:57.017 --> 01:48:02.439]  Uh, fees on money transferred out above a certain amount will pay for the wall in less than a year.
[01:48:02.679 --> 01:48:03.300]  Oh my gosh.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:09.282]  Of course, he's starting the wall with our own bill, guaranteeing we'll pay for it if we can't raise the funds.
[01:48:09.522 --> 01:48:10.863]  So they're saying he's a liar.
[01:48:11.223 --> 01:48:14.024]  Hey folks, who cares whether the Mexicans pay for it or we do?
[01:48:14.544 --> 01:48:20.987]  We're paying for it with the hundreds of billions of dollars of crime and disease and paying for all the babies and the rest of it.
[01:48:21.247 --> 01:48:26.749]  And that's who Trump's saying we're not going to just let in from China, or Mexico, or Eastern Europe, or anywhere else.
[01:48:26.789 --> 01:48:30.430]  But that's where the main numbers are pouring in from, because we're known as chumps now.
[01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:35.092]  CNN even admits that rich Chinese are the number one group coming here now.
[01:48:35.312 --> 01:48:36.092]  Rich Chinese?
[01:48:36.172 --> 01:48:36.572]  Why not?
[01:48:36.972 --> 01:48:46.256]  Their kid becomes a citizen, they get twenty-something thousand dollars of free health care paid for, their kid goes on welfare immediately, they work the system, and they laugh at us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:47.376 --> 01:48:48.797]  And the left doesn't enforce on them.
[01:48:48.817 --> 01:48:51.120]  Let me tell you who the left enforces on the welfare rules.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.861]  Poor whites and poor blacks.
[01:48:53.642 --> 01:49:02.149]  If you look at the social engineering in this country, poor blacks and poor whites and poor Native Americans get the exact same targeting by the globalists.
[01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:10.055]  In this nation, but if you're from outside, they leave you alone, whether you're a white Eastern European or an African or Mexican or whatever.
[01:49:11.236 --> 01:49:16.399]  Because they want to get you here and get colonies set up that are fully dependent on the government under their control.
[01:49:16.439 --> 01:49:20.322]  They're going to cut off the free goodies down the road, but right now they're getting everybody trapped.
[01:49:20.642 --> 01:49:22.583]  The New World Order hates everybody.
[01:49:23.204 --> 01:49:32.330]  And these neurotic, disconnected, America-hating, God-hating control freaks in Hollywood are on a control freak jihad.
[01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:33.851]  We're good to go.
[01:49:51.992 --> 01:49:58.454]  Who all they have is their twisted, freakish ideology, and they hate the fact that we don't go to psychiatrists and psychologists all day.
[01:49:58.714 --> 01:50:11.558]  They hate the fact that we're straight and strong, and good looking, and successful, and have a good attitude, and are moving forward, and men are men, and women are women, and we're strong, because a strong culture can't be conquered.
[01:50:11.858 --> 01:50:20.161]  And again, it's in all the social engineering manuals, it's in all the documents, and it's in all the statements, but you can see it everyday being carried out.
[01:50:21.501 --> 01:50:37.908]  So no matter what color you are, where you came from, if you want Americana, if you want freedom, if you want private property, if you want justice, if you want, you know, aggressive male energy in the world to build, not to destroy, then you are the antidote to the New World Order.
[01:50:38.248 --> 01:50:52.217]  And if you're a strong woman who want to empower your man and your family and yourself and understand that we're all symbiotically tied together and the rising tides raise all ships, not from government, but from individual action, then you're on the team as well.
[01:50:52.898 --> 01:50:53.698]  It's a big tip.
[01:50:53.798 --> 01:50:54.679]  It's called humanity.
[01:50:54.839 --> 01:50:56.220]  It's basically unstoppable.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:04.245]  When we get on our knees and ask God to lead, guide and direct us back to David and Austin, Texas, I'll be popping in as well in the next hour.
[01:51:04.345 --> 01:51:08.048]  If you're listening or watching this transmission, I'm here to tell you, you are the resistance.
[01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:14.813]  Thank you, Alex, and we're going to be talking about the fake news of the Russia attacks.
[01:51:14.833 --> 01:51:18.355]  There's a violent report that Leanne McAdoo and Darren McBrain did last week.
[01:51:19.036 --> 01:51:23.078]  Some beautiful stuff, clips that Darren found, put together.
[01:51:23.118 --> 01:51:27.862]  We're going to talk to Leanne in the next hour, and we're going to have another report from Alex Jones in the next hour.
[01:51:28.382 --> 01:51:34.746]  I want to continue with what we were talking about about an hour ago when we talked about CNN retracting their own fake news.
[01:51:34.806 --> 01:51:38.289]  I didn't go into as much detail and I want to tell you what was behind that.
[01:51:38.309 --> 01:51:40.150]  Of course, we talked about it when it came out.
[01:51:40.671 --> 01:51:46.815]  They had a former deputy director of the CIA go on CNN's New Day.
[01:51:46.875 --> 01:51:48.296]  The guy's name is Phil Mudd.
[01:51:48.696 --> 01:51:50.998]  I guess his name is now Mudd, literally.
[01:51:51.698 --> 01:52:06.481]  He called Julian Assange a pedophile on CNN and Wikileaks immediately tweeted, we have issued instructions to sue CNN for defamation unless within 48 hours they air a one hour expose of the plot against Assange.
[01:52:07.122 --> 01:52:10.925]  It didn't take long, they point out, for CNN to issue a retraction.
[01:52:11.485 --> 01:52:20.172]  As Free Thought Project points out, they have now been labeled by Americans as the least trusted cable news network.
[01:52:20.232 --> 01:52:22.513]  And of course, CNN really is the CIA news network.
[01:52:22.533 --> 01:52:23.494]  We've talked about that a long time.
[01:52:23.554 --> 01:52:29.899]  It's interesting to see these attacks coming from the CIA, openly leading the attack.
[01:52:30.731 --> 01:52:36.393]  People like Michael Morrell, who was always part of the Never Trumpers, who always opposed Donald Trump, supported Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:36.433 --> 01:52:38.034]  He took over from David Petraeus!
[01:52:38.594 --> 01:52:46.597]  And so even though he got his job because David Petraeus violated national security regulations, and even though he saw Hillary Clinton
[01:52:48.365 --> 01:52:51.288]  Get away with violating national security regulations.
[01:52:52.049 --> 01:52:59.057]  He supported Hillary Clinton and he said you're going to have massive resignations from the intelligence services because of Donald Trump because he doesn't trust us.
[01:52:59.097 --> 01:53:00.258]  Why would he trust you?
[01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:03.542]  Why would anybody in their right mind trust you?
[01:53:03.562 --> 01:53:08.468]  We're going to show you some clips in the next hour that are absolutely amazing that really underscore that.
[01:53:09.028 --> 01:53:13.334]  And of course, in their retraction, I want to read this to you from what CNN said.
[01:53:13.434 --> 01:53:20.042]  An analyst on air today, earlier, asserted that Julian Assange was a pedophile and regrets saying it.
[01:53:20.282 --> 01:53:24.107]  In fact, CNN has no evidence to support that assertion.
[01:53:24.127 --> 01:53:24.708]  Of course they don't.
[01:53:24.748 --> 01:53:27.191]  That doesn't keep them from making these assertions.
[01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:33.378]  Assange, they said, is currently wanted for extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations.
[01:53:33.478 --> 01:53:36.140]  And I'll underscore that and say these are allegations.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.041]  He's not been convicted.
[01:53:38.421 --> 01:53:39.702]  He has not been indicted.
[01:53:39.802 --> 01:53:46.066]  And then they go on to say there is no evidence to suggest that the women alleged were minors.
[01:53:46.647 --> 01:53:49.929]  Okay, so it is absolutely not about pedophilia.
[01:53:49.949 --> 01:53:51.490]  But that is where they are.
[01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:55.232]  And now WikiLeaks has doubled down again and said that Hillary Clinton earned $100,000 from ISIS.
[01:53:58.074 --> 01:54:10.443]  And they're pointing out how there have been certain e-mails, she archived e-mails like, quote, the Library of Alexandria, where there is proof within those e-mails that she knowingly armed jihadists, including ISIS.
[01:54:11.063 --> 01:54:12.204]  This is gradually coming out.
[01:54:12.665 --> 01:54:24.433]  We saw these, this tape from John Kerry, that of course the New York Times saw, but they chose not to report on, but eventually the truth comes out and we learn that
[01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:31.511]  John Kerry didn't care what he was doing, who he was hurting, who he was supporting in Syria.
[01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:37.692]  He would give ISIS their caliphate if it meant that he could get what he wanted.
[01:54:37.992 --> 01:54:42.013]  In this particular case, what he wanted was regime change, and he didn't care how many children died.
[01:54:42.594 --> 01:54:45.334]  He didn't care how many countries he bombed into oblivion.
[01:54:46.074 --> 01:54:51.796]  And of course, they tell us that they're fighting ISIS, and yet we see them dropping by parachute equipment to them.
[01:54:52.216 --> 01:54:58.439]  We see the lies about sarin gas that we pushed back on in 2013 when they tried to get us to be Al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:54:58.459 --> 01:55:01.200]  But they're still operating as Al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:09.064]  As the Russians pointed out, you know, we've had 25,000 bombs dropped in the last couple of years by Obama in Syria and Iraq.
[01:55:09.464 --> 01:55:09.844]  Guess what?
[01:55:10.204 --> 01:55:13.986]  Not a single one of them landed on an ISIS-controlled oil field.
[01:55:15.066 --> 01:55:17.327]  And the Russians said, isn't that miraculous?
[01:55:17.707 --> 01:55:18.508]  Yes, isn't it?
[01:55:19.388 --> 01:55:26.552]  What a serendipitous coincidence that not a single bomb landed on ISIS oil fields.
[01:55:27.272 --> 01:55:29.393]  Very easily set on fire.
[01:55:29.413 --> 01:55:30.934]  And we've seen over and over again.
[01:55:31.514 --> 01:55:41.081]  The long convoys of weapons, and we saw people reporting it, streaming it live, and yet they couldn't manage to send a drone over and attack those convoys, could they?
[01:55:41.461 --> 01:55:43.842]  The convoys of oil, the convoys of weapons.
[01:55:43.922 --> 01:55:49.066]  So, we know that they were complicit, we know that they organized it, we know that they funded it, they trained them.
[01:55:49.626 --> 01:55:55.109]  They transported rebels from Chechnya into Syria to use them as surrogates.
[01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:58.852]  The CIA has been using Islamists as surrogates for a long time.
[01:55:59.472 --> 01:56:01.033]  The mask has now come off.
[01:56:01.673 --> 01:56:05.896]  The mask has come off of their Operation Mockingbird projects.
[01:56:06.792 --> 01:56:09.613]  And now they are openly propagandizing Americans.
[01:56:09.653 --> 01:56:10.734]  Here's another bit of propaganda.
[01:56:10.754 --> 01:56:11.915]  This one is coming from the U.S.
[01:56:11.955 --> 01:56:13.095]  Fish and Wildlife Service.
[01:56:13.896 --> 01:56:18.558]  And they're saying, on the Washington Post, where else would you put this kind of nonsense, fake news?
[01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:24.261]  Headline, Washington Post, without action on climate change, say goodbye to the polar bears.
[01:56:25.181 --> 01:56:26.803]  They're gonna drown out there, you know.
[01:56:26.883 --> 01:56:29.445]  They can only swim, I think, 300 miles a day.
[01:56:29.985 --> 01:56:34.108]  They're all gonna go away, because all the ice is melting, according to the U.S.
[01:56:34.168 --> 01:56:35.710]  Fish and Wildlife Service.
[01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:39.233]  Except, we also see at the same time, there's one of them.
[01:56:39.493 --> 01:56:42.515]  He's so forlorn on that ice floe there.
[01:56:42.555 --> 01:56:44.837]  He's just unable to swim away.
[01:56:44.857 --> 01:56:46.178]  He's just helpless.
[01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:49.100]  But, we also see pictures of Venice.
[01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:52.554]  And we see the canals drying up in Venice.
[01:56:52.594 --> 01:56:54.476]  Now how is that happening at the same time?
[01:56:54.876 --> 01:56:57.259]  Why are the canals in Venice drying up?
[01:56:57.339 --> 01:56:59.641]  We were told that Venice was going to be underwater.
[01:57:00.442 --> 01:57:02.384]  Go to this story from Climate Depot.
[01:57:02.464 --> 01:57:08.911]  Logbook expedition to Antarctica more than 100 years ago raises troubling new doubts about global warming.
[01:57:08.931 --> 01:57:10.693]  And this goes back to the end of November.
[01:57:11.494 --> 01:57:26.380]  Why should there be so much excitement over the discovery from the logbooks of two of Britain's most famous explorers more than a hundred years ago, that there was the same amount of ice floating around Antarctica then as there is today, to the surprise of academics from the University of Reading?
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:39.014]  The records kept by the expeditions of Captain Robert Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton in the early years of the last century detail the extent of ice cover, the state of the sea, and the weather.
[01:57:39.074 --> 01:57:47.263]  They were very astute observers and they did things like keep diaries and journals and logs and they showed that there was remarkably little change in the extent of sea ice
[01:57:47.844 --> 01:57:58.235]  At the other end of the world, the data collected by these and other explorers said Dr. Jonathan Day could profoundly change the way we view the ebb and flow of Antarctic sea ice.
[01:57:58.335 --> 01:58:05.022]  We know that sea ice in the Antarctic has increased slightly over the past 30 years since satellite observations began.
[01:58:06.223 --> 01:58:07.744]  See, they don't even have a good base.
[01:58:08.464 --> 01:58:12.967]  When they do have a good base, they start looking at it with satellite observations, and they say, oh, it's increasing.
[01:58:13.208 --> 01:58:16.570]  When they go back and look at the diaries of a hundred years ago, they say, hey, it's the same.
[01:58:17.050 --> 01:58:17.931]  Looks like it's the same.
[01:58:17.951 --> 01:58:21.573]  And the same thing is true of the temperature readings that they get.
[01:58:22.093 --> 01:58:23.134]  It's totally false.
[01:58:23.594 --> 01:58:24.255]  Why is it?
[01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:36.758]  When they can't project the weather, and we went to the AMS, American Meteorological Society meeting here in Austin a couple years ago, and everybody is working very hard to try to predict the weather two days away, and not doing it very successfully.
[01:58:37.638 --> 01:58:44.363]  And now, we're supposed to believe their projections 50 years out, based on what these climate models are totally phony.
[01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:47.725]  They've already been disproven in the short time we've had them.
[01:58:47.765 --> 01:58:48.706]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:52.308 --> 01:58:53.509]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:55.134 --> 01:58:57.414]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:57.434 --> 01:59:11.257]  A fundraising campaign is underway for that Chicago victim kidnapped by four thugs, forced to drink from the toilet while his hair was cut bald in his clothes, and he was taunted with Trump taunts.
[01:59:11.437 --> 01:59:17.999]  An online fundraising campaign for the family of the Chicago victim has pulled in eight times the amount it was intended to raise.
[01:59:18.019 --> 01:59:23.640]  A GoFundMe campaign that started on January the 5th had an intent of raising $10,000 for the victim
[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:27.783]  The Daily Caller reporter Amber Randall writes about the fundraising campaign that's underway saying, quote,
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:57.363]  The fundraising page reads, the fundraiser is a good way to remind the family of this victim that we are all behind them, supporting them.
[01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:59.965]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:00:01.946 --> 02:00:07.849]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.162 --> 02:00:23.064]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:24.004 --> 02:00:34.549]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.569 --> 02:00:36.170]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:36.990]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:40.432]  We're going to have a special report from Alex coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:40.472 --> 02:00:43.153]  Leanne McAdoo is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour to talk about
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.084]  The Russia fake news hacks that are going on.
[02:00:48.845 --> 02:01:02.517]  But I want to finish up with what I was talking about in the last segment and that was the fake news story coming out from Fish and Wildlife saying that we're going to lose all the polar bears as if this was not been reported over and over again and absolutely not true.
[02:01:02.597 --> 02:01:07.222]  I hope Donald Trump really cleans house in Fish and Wildlife.
[02:01:07.748 --> 02:01:11.071]  I hope he really cleans house in the EPA, in the Department of Energy.
[02:01:11.592 --> 02:01:21.341]  And of course they were screaming bloody murder, weren't they, when the Trump transition team said we would like to have information about all the people who have been going to these global warming
[02:01:22.685 --> 02:01:25.768]  Conferences, we would like to see people who've written papers on this.
[02:01:25.808 --> 02:01:27.489]  We'd like for you to give us that information.
[02:01:27.509 --> 02:01:29.871]  They're saying, you're gonna, you're gonna purge us!
[02:01:30.592 --> 02:01:32.153]  It's like, well, maybe, yeah.
[02:01:32.553 --> 02:01:33.494]  Maybe we should do that.
[02:01:34.154 --> 02:01:35.035]  I hope he does do that.
[02:01:35.415 --> 02:01:38.718]  They've been doing that to other scientists on the other side of that.
[02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:42.281]  Here's an article from a Georgia Tech climatologist.
[02:01:42.421 --> 02:01:45.644]  She was retiring because she simply can't take it anymore.
[02:01:46.084 --> 02:01:47.225]  Her name is Judith Curry.
[02:01:47.265 --> 02:01:52.268]  She's former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech.
[02:01:53.028 --> 02:01:55.890]  She announced her resignation on a blog post last week.
[02:01:56.410 --> 02:02:09.698]  She said it's technically a retirement event, but she said, the deeper reasons have to do with my growing disenchantment with universities, with the academic field of climate scientists, of climate science and climate scientists.
[02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:14.401]  She says she can't navigate the stifling political orthodoxy
[02:02:14.921 --> 02:02:17.984]  You see, it's become a religion, it's not science.
[02:02:18.824 --> 02:02:24.349]  They say she's known for her scientifically astute explanations of the uncertainties in climate science.
[02:02:24.389 --> 02:02:26.370]  This is an article from PJ Media, by the way.
[02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:33.036]  She's been attacked as anti-science by other researchers who repeat the rote scientific consensus.
[02:02:33.456 --> 02:02:38.440]  You see, when she comes out and she points out, well we have some uncertainties here, there's some ambiguity here.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:39.020]  No, no, no!
[02:02:39.561 --> 02:02:40.862]  We know everything that's going to happen.
[02:02:40.882 --> 02:02:42.423]  There is no uncertainty in our models.
[02:02:42.483 --> 02:02:45.646]  We have this down exactly and we have a scientific consensus.
[02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:51.072]  I have to say that when you eliminate uncertainties from science, it is no longer science.
[02:02:51.512 --> 02:02:54.913]  When you eliminate skepticism from science, it is no longer science.
[02:02:55.653 --> 02:02:59.015]  When you have a consensus, it is nearly always wrong.
[02:02:59.035 --> 02:03:01.095]  Almost always wrong.
[02:03:01.115 --> 02:03:02.876]  I mean, we got Galileo.
[02:03:03.096 --> 02:03:05.997]  He went against the consensus, didn't he?
[02:03:06.097 --> 02:03:12.400]  They had a much better model of the movement of the planets from Ptolemy than Galileo did.
[02:03:13.277 --> 02:03:18.527]  Because Galileo initially went in with circular orbits and it didn't really predict the movement of the planets.
[02:03:19.628 --> 02:03:24.569]  And Ptolemy had a much more complicated system that actually was a better predictor.
[02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:30.511]  It wasn't until Kepler came in with elliptical orbits that they really got to something that was accurate.
[02:03:31.231 --> 02:03:34.112]  His problem with his theory was he had circulated, but he was right!
[02:03:34.692 --> 02:03:36.292]  The Sun was the center of the universe.
[02:03:36.892 --> 02:03:38.513]  And it wasn't just a religious pushback.
[02:03:38.593 --> 02:03:46.275]  It was a pushback against the consensus of the scientists because that model had taken on religious significance to them.
[02:03:47.375 --> 02:03:48.475]  And that's what she's saying.
[02:03:48.916 --> 02:04:01.440]  She said a deciding factor in her leaving was that she no longer knows what to say to students and to postdocs regarding how to navigate the craziness in the field of climate science.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:03.561]  And she put craziness in all uppercase.
[02:04:03.981 --> 02:04:07.923]  She said research and other professional activities are professionally rewarded only if
[02:04:08.723 --> 02:04:16.108]  They are channeled in certain directions, approved by a politicized academic establishment.
[02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:19.231]  See, science has become politicized.
[02:04:19.591 --> 02:04:28.517]  We have politicized science, we have politicized intelligence reports, like weapons of mass destruction, like the Russians did it.
[02:04:29.438 --> 02:04:30.459]  This is all politics.
[02:04:31.547 --> 02:04:36.860]  You understand, they released their special report, which we dissected somewhat yesterday.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.885]  We'll talk about this more at the bottom of the hour.
[02:04:40.029 --> 02:04:43.150]  That special report had a lot of stuff in there about RT.
[02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:44.231]  Most of it was about RT.
[02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:45.491]  There was no facts in it.
[02:04:46.092 --> 02:04:49.153]  They talked about programs that existed four years ago.
[02:04:49.213 --> 02:04:52.154]  They talked about how RT was at the center of all this.
[02:04:52.234 --> 02:04:56.476]  And they nearly cost Obama the election in 2012, they said.
[02:04:56.576 --> 02:04:57.096]  Nonsense.
[02:04:57.556 --> 02:04:58.317]  Absolute nonsense.
[02:04:58.957 --> 02:05:00.558]  All right, we're going to be back right after the break.
[02:05:00.918 --> 02:05:02.839]  Alex Jones will be joining us for the special report.
[02:05:03.239 --> 02:05:05.160]  And then we'll have Leanne McAdoo at the bottom of the hour.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:05.560]  Stay with us.
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:06.080]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:10.521 --> 02:05:11.883]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:05:12.163 --> 02:05:13.445]  You can't survive without it.
[02:05:13.646 --> 02:05:14.547]  But where do you get it?

[02:07:09.724 --> 02:07:24.513]  Well, if you were too busy and didn't watch the Golden Globes last night, where liberal stars like Meryl Streep were reveling in the loss of her party and her platform, and blaming Donald Trump for picking on a, quote, handicapped reporter, here's some more fake news for you.
[02:07:24.693 --> 02:07:31.717]  The totalitarian left has decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on merits, they would just prefer to eliminate them altogether.
[02:07:31.937 --> 02:07:32.557]  We're good to go.
[02:07:50.689 --> 02:08:06.516]  Celebrating the flagging efforts of anonymous Twitter trolls who've tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News, these would-be censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views on their merits, they're just going to try to eliminate them altogether.
[02:08:06.536 --> 02:08:08.397]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:08:20.623 --> 02:08:24.731]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:25.452 --> 02:08:27.135]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:29.690 --> 02:08:37.277]  Last hour, we broke down the fact that Meryl Streep has come out and demonized President Trump.
[02:08:38.217 --> 02:08:42.701]  And the reason I covered that is it's a Rosetta Stone into disinformation and their inverted reality.
[02:08:43.802 --> 02:08:53.270]  Because not only did she attack him saying he's at war with the press and going after journalists, not only is that upside down, but everything else she said was upside down.
[02:08:54.371 --> 02:08:55.012]  But look at this.
[02:08:55.132 --> 02:08:59.177]  Trump has done nothing to the press, but fight back against the press.
[02:09:00.138 --> 02:09:08.348]  And in the example she used against Trump, saying that he was the enemy of the press, she brought up a journalist that he supposedly made fun of once.
[02:09:09.249 --> 02:09:13.133]  So in her world, in her social justice warrior snowflake planet,
[02:09:14.654 --> 02:09:22.456]  Making fun of someone or countering someone or tweeting back at someone is an attack on the press and an attack on free speech.
[02:09:22.996 --> 02:09:35.619]  But Obama signing a law to put the CIA over the control of the media and to move forward with Cass Sunstein's plan to start taxing free speech and banning free speech, that's okay.
[02:09:36.759 --> 02:09:38.700]  The unprecedented war on journalists
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:40.981]  That we've seen the last eight years.
[02:09:41.041 --> 02:09:46.602]  The unprecedented arresting of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and just huge amounts being imprisoned.
[02:09:46.923 --> 02:09:51.404]  And whistleblowers being SWAT teamed and being imprisoned for exposing corruption.
[02:09:51.824 --> 02:09:52.785]  All of that is wonderful.
[02:09:53.325 --> 02:09:55.966]  Backing of radical jihadists all over the Middle East.
[02:09:56.606 --> 02:10:02.568]  Supporting Saudi Arabia's invasion of moderate Muslim countries like Syria and killing hundreds of thousands.
[02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:04.869]  It's all cute when Hillary says...
[02:10:06.201 --> 02:10:08.723]  She came, she saw, he died.
[02:10:09.043 --> 02:10:10.424]  Because she's a woman.
[02:10:10.824 --> 02:10:12.365]  And Obama's supposedly black.
[02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:19.250]  And Meryl Streep doesn't have to live in the real world because she literally lives in fantasy land.
[02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:20.951]  She's an actress.
[02:10:21.871 --> 02:10:26.795]  Just like Stephen Colbert comes out and warns of the dangers of fake news.
[02:10:27.255 --> 02:10:34.600]  And Alex Jones, when he's been a fake newscaster his whole life, playing a fake fictitious person.
[02:10:36.388 --> 02:10:45.934]  So it cannot be lost on any of us that if you look at the headlines from CNN, you name it, it's Donald Trump attacks Hollywood legend and a woman.
[02:10:47.262 --> 02:10:48.102]  Meryl Streep.
[02:10:49.503 --> 02:10:50.243]  Oh, my God.
[02:10:50.383 --> 02:11:01.007]  Of course, they don't point out that she attacked him and said that he hates minorities, quote, hates foreigners, that he hates a free press, all this slander, all these lies.
[02:11:01.827 --> 02:11:03.787]  But see, it's true.
[02:11:03.988 --> 02:11:06.068]  She warned that he's attacking the press.
[02:11:06.128 --> 02:11:09.689]  And see, he had his own First Amendment and spoke back.
[02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:13.771]  I've always noticed with the controlled authoritarian left that if they attack me,
[02:11:14.653 --> 02:11:15.855]  Did I criticize them back?
[02:11:16.135 --> 02:11:18.259]  They say, oh look, you're attacking me.
[02:11:18.279 --> 02:11:19.200]  I have free speech.
[02:11:19.541 --> 02:11:21.504]  Yes, you have free speech.
[02:11:22.445 --> 02:11:23.327]  Let me explain free speech.
[02:11:23.467 --> 02:11:25.009]  You have the right to say something.
[02:11:26.508 --> 02:11:29.029]  I have the right to counter it and respond to it.
[02:11:29.129 --> 02:11:31.470]  Do you understand what that means?
[02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:40.995]  Your free speech doesn't mean I get a big fat muzzle shoved in my mouth like Hollywood's teaching six-year-old boys how to do, you bunch of pervs.
[02:11:41.555 --> 02:11:54.801]  It doesn't mean I shut up and roll over and die so fake intellectuals who can't debate me on the field of ideas can act like you've won when you create straw men of who Alex Jones is or who Donald Trump is or who Matt Drudge is.
[02:11:55.501 --> 02:11:56.843]  Or who Jesse James is.
[02:11:57.444 --> 02:12:11.984]  We are so sick and tired of people like you creating these straw men and then pointing at them and telling the world that that's who we are and then trying to shut us up so we can't tell the world through our own lungs, our own vocal cords, who we are.
[02:12:13.706 --> 02:12:17.951]  I mean, it just makes my blood boil to watch these criminals, and they are criminals.
[02:12:17.971 --> 02:12:18.892]  They want our guns.
[02:12:19.132 --> 02:12:20.053]  They want our kids.
[02:12:20.073 --> 02:12:20.994]  They want our property.
[02:12:21.275 --> 02:12:27.282]  They go on television, on MSNBC, and admit they want to run every facet of our day-to-day lives.
[02:12:28.382 --> 02:12:31.083]  They're not content with 60% of our money on average.
[02:12:31.123 --> 02:12:31.423]  They want 70.
[02:12:31.824 --> 02:12:32.484]  They want 80.
[02:12:32.684 --> 02:12:35.005]  They want 90% like France does.
[02:12:35.385 --> 02:12:45.048]  Because they're nobodies, they live to control other people instead of watching a free market civilization build like a stairway to heaven to the stars.
[02:12:45.629 --> 02:12:46.189]  Now that said...
[02:12:47.538 --> 02:12:49.079]  I want to get back into the big news here.
[02:12:49.899 --> 02:12:50.780]  We're what, 10 days?
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.941]  10 days out until the inauguration.
[02:12:53.101 --> 02:12:56.603]  The most important 10 days since the election.
[02:12:56.623 --> 02:12:59.144]  Some of the most important days in our lifetimes.
[02:12:59.364 --> 02:13:00.244]  No one's debating that.
[02:13:00.925 --> 02:13:01.765]  Well, actually not.
[02:13:01.785 --> 02:13:06.167]  There's a meme out there saying, Alex Jones, stop saying Trump's election was historical.
[02:13:06.207 --> 02:13:06.728]  No, it wasn't.
[02:13:06.928 --> 02:13:07.588]  Well, yes, it is.
[02:13:09.029 --> 02:13:09.669]  And that's the thing.
[02:13:09.689 --> 02:13:13.231]  They can't stand the fact that we're on the right side of history, that we're the real liberals.
[02:13:14.625 --> 02:13:17.866]  That humanity is so incredibly hungry for the truth.
[02:13:18.527 --> 02:13:31.812]  And that again, they call for censorship of us and then they create this whole pity party facade that we're going after their speech and that Trump wants to crush their right to speak.
[02:13:33.214 --> 02:13:42.965]  No, Trump has only said that he wants the libel laws changed back to the way they were, so that if you prove somebody lied about you on purpose, you have a right to damage us.
[02:13:43.766 --> 02:13:44.867]  And I actually agree with that.
[02:13:44.967 --> 02:13:51.975]  I'm somebody who's personally sued folks at least twice for defamation because I had to and they settled out of court because I could prove
[02:13:52.715 --> 02:13:57.599]  Well, they were dumb enough in both cases to say, on air, I want to hurt Alex Jones.
[02:13:57.999 --> 02:14:00.582]  I want to bring Alex Jones down, so I'm gonna say this.
[02:14:00.602 --> 02:14:01.863]  That's how dumb these people are.
[02:14:02.183 --> 02:14:03.023]  Oops, I gotcha.
[02:14:03.324 --> 02:14:05.245]  Malice aforethought with intent to do harm.
[02:14:06.286 --> 02:14:07.947]  Malice aforethought with intent to do harm.
[02:14:07.967 --> 02:14:09.689]  Doesn't matter if I'm a public figure, dummy.
[02:14:10.089 --> 02:14:11.329]  But see, I know the law.
[02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:12.990]  I'm not bragging, but I'm informed.
[02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:15.631]  I'm on fire with intellectual acumen.
[02:14:16.271 --> 02:14:18.932]  I have gravitas because I'm excited about life and about liberty.
[02:14:19.192 --> 02:14:21.493]  And I'm interfacing with other men and women that want it as well.
[02:14:21.773 --> 02:14:34.277]  We're coming together, building a true civilization of renaissance that is so much sexier than the addled, poor, pathetic, mentally ill garbage that Hollywood is projecting onto us.
[02:14:35.497 --> 02:14:44.925]  Hollywood is insular, racist, elitist, gangster-esque, diseased, inbred, mentally ill, foreign-owned by the Communist Chinese more and more.
[02:14:45.266 --> 02:14:51.831]  So they project onto us that we're the foreigners, we're the Russians, we want to make America great again.
[02:14:51.851 --> 02:14:52.952]  Let me say this right now.
[02:14:53.733 --> 02:14:56.415]  The Russians, I would say, we're behind about 1% of our election.
[02:14:58.536 --> 02:15:03.920]  The global solidarity movement of nation-states pulling out of corporate world government was 30% of it.
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:05.500]  There was global solidarity.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:09.163]  There were people all over the world fighting for America and fighting for Donald Trump.
[02:15:09.483 --> 02:15:20.349]  And just like we fought for Russia to get out of globalism, or Brexit with the UK, or we supported Catalonia and their secession, or just we supported Italy and they're beginning to pull out, or Iceland and Reykjavik.
[02:15:20.389 --> 02:15:26.152]  I had Jones Dutilleur leading the movement on years ago from Iceland, from Reykjavik.
[02:15:27.413 --> 02:15:31.495]  Did Iceland pull out of globalism because of Alex Jones and America?
[02:15:31.876 --> 02:15:35.057]  And then we were spies influencing them and controlling them?
[02:15:35.358 --> 02:15:35.538]  No!
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:46.062]  Global solidarity, global free market globalism based on ideas and common solidarity and free market and free association.
[02:15:46.422 --> 02:15:49.403]  I'm all for countries coming together but keeping their sovereignty.
[02:15:49.763 --> 02:15:54.405]  But sharing ideas and sharing alliances where our needs overlap.
[02:15:54.905 --> 02:15:59.066]  And I believe in a world based on ideology, not based on pure...
[02:16:00.186 --> 02:16:01.908]  Mercantile corporate conquering.
[02:16:02.568 --> 02:16:05.911]  But based on ideology of liberty and freedom.
[02:16:05.931 --> 02:16:07.273]  And the Russians now know this.
[02:16:07.973 --> 02:16:09.455]  Our own Pentagon now knows this.
[02:16:09.995 --> 02:16:13.158]  It's very strange, but I kind of brought back Americana.
[02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:14.519]  Trump's doing it bigger than I did.
[02:16:14.859 --> 02:16:18.803]  But I've been told by the top people that they understand exactly what I'm doing.
[02:16:19.203 --> 02:16:22.767]  And that we're bringing something out that transcends national borders in the long term.
[02:16:22.787 --> 02:16:23.547]  1776 worldwide.
[02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:27.170]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:33.433]  And I don't want to sit there and brag, but you need to know the success level you've had by supporting this broadcast.
[02:16:33.814 --> 02:16:49.903]  You need to know that we, intellectually, at the highest levels, from Russia to Japan to Italy to South Africa to the United Kingdom, from Oxford to Harvard, people are sick of globalism and they are trying to revolt internally inside these institutions.
[02:16:51.212 --> 02:16:51.733]  I mean, you name it.
[02:16:51.973 --> 02:16:54.917]  There are so many people in Hollywood that are awake and don't want to be part of this tyranny.
[02:16:55.357 --> 02:16:56.279]  I told you about it years ago.
[02:16:56.299 --> 02:16:59.683]  I told you about secret societies a decade ago inside Hollywood of conservatives.
[02:17:00.043 --> 02:17:00.744]  People made fun of me.
[02:17:00.764 --> 02:17:01.866]  Now it's in the Hollywood Reporter.
[02:17:02.486 --> 02:17:04.449]  I told you about all these massive movements.
[02:17:05.603 --> 02:17:08.244]  That's why Trump knows if he can just deliver on securing our borders.
[02:17:08.264 --> 02:17:10.344]  Trump knows if he can just deliver on getting the economy restarted.
[02:17:24.368 --> 02:17:33.554]  If he can just deliver on cutting taxes for poor people and middle class and bring back corporate money, he knows then the entire system of globalism falls.
[02:17:34.015 --> 02:17:49.305]  And we are looking, as Stephen Bannon has said, of 50 to 100 years of the American century, a second American century, not of American corporate dominance, but of the reemergence of Americana ideas sweeping the globe.
[02:17:49.585 --> 02:17:53.488]  Now, I told you all this before Stephen Bannon was in The Hollywood Reporter.
[02:17:54.308 --> 02:17:55.589]  Two months ago saying it all.
[02:17:56.029 --> 02:17:58.351]  And people saw that and the media got really freaked out.
[02:17:58.371 --> 02:18:02.953]  They went, oh my God, Alex Jones really is advising Stephen Bannon and Donald Trump.
[02:18:03.874 --> 02:18:04.694]  And I came on air.
[02:18:04.855 --> 02:18:05.715]  It was word for word.
[02:18:05.955 --> 02:18:08.697]  I said, folks, Stephen Bannon doesn't have to listen to me.
[02:18:10.518 --> 02:18:14.080]  They were into this before I was even out of high school.
[02:18:14.661 --> 02:18:16.522]  That's why the globalists are so screwed.
[02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:18.363]  And I can't get into all of it.
[02:18:18.383 --> 02:18:21.485]  And I can't break it all down because a lot of it the enemy could use.
[02:18:21.805 --> 02:18:22.845]  But I'm just here to tell you,
[02:18:24.006 --> 02:18:24.727]  It is incredible.
[02:18:25.487 --> 02:18:29.611]  I'm tempted to write an article about it in the future, and then...
[02:18:31.078 --> 02:18:35.919]  Basically, I mean, none of it's secret, but it's hardcore, folks.
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:39.020]  There's a reason the New World Order is panicking.
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:44.902]  Believe it, know it, they are scared, you know what, because they understand how big this is.
[02:18:44.922 --> 02:18:49.063]  Look at Chrysler, just announced a billion dollars in jobs next year coming back.
[02:18:49.663 --> 02:18:52.044]  Ford just announced two factories coming back.
[02:18:52.484 --> 02:18:53.944]  They're talking about even more coming back.
[02:18:54.384 --> 02:18:55.745]  General Motors is trying to stab.
[02:18:56.705 --> 02:19:01.168]  Uh, Trump and the American people in the back right now, not because Chevy's bad, but because it's been hijacked.
[02:19:01.548 --> 02:19:03.409]  So let's not be mad at the famous American brand.
[02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:05.110]  Let's just understand it's been hijacked right now.
[02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:08.832]  There is just so much going on that is so positive.
[02:19:09.132 --> 02:19:12.454]  There's almost nothing can stop us if we continue to take action.
[02:19:13.215 --> 02:19:14.596]  But we just have to realize.
[02:19:15.711 --> 02:19:18.675]  But the globalist social engineers are the worst of the worst of the worst.
[02:19:19.716 --> 02:19:20.798]  Totally bloodthirsty.
[02:19:21.339 --> 02:19:22.160]  Totally twisted.
[02:19:23.201 --> 02:19:24.963]  And I'm not just saying that rhetorically.
[02:19:25.043 --> 02:19:26.706]  These really are bad people.
[02:19:26.846 --> 02:19:28.088]  Look at everything they do.
[02:19:28.148 --> 02:19:29.850]  Look at the articles on InfoWars.com.
[02:19:31.211 --> 02:19:35.972]  With Silicon Valley chiefs saying Midwest is scum and filth and all trash and the enemy.
[02:19:36.072 --> 02:19:37.472]  This is how they see us!
[02:19:38.513 --> 02:19:43.053]  This is how they see us and they can't stand seeing Trump rallies and my rallies.
[02:19:43.353 --> 02:19:46.994]  Like the rally we had with Roger Stone, where half the people were Hispanic or black.
[02:19:47.834 --> 02:19:50.455]  I didn't see black people or Hispanic people or white people there.
[02:19:50.535 --> 02:19:54.196]  I saw people that want freedom and who had electricity in their eyes.
[02:19:54.736 --> 02:19:56.136]  And that's the thing I want to leave you with.
[02:19:56.936 --> 02:20:07.864]  When somebody's awake to this destiny of humanity, when somebody believes and has optimism and really cares and understands the power of the individual in turning that loose, it's a spirit.
[02:20:08.504 --> 02:20:15.829]  And it totally defeats the spirit of poverty and control and manipulativeness that Hollywood and the globalists represent.
[02:20:16.369 --> 02:20:17.670]  They could come out of Babylon.
[02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:18.851]  They could come out of Rome.
[02:20:19.191 --> 02:20:21.473]  They could come out of Egypt anytime they wanted to.
[02:20:22.273 --> 02:20:44.102]  But these people in Hollywood and the elites in New York and the rest of them are so incredibly decadent, so incredibly unhappy, that instead they've gone to darkness, to devil worship, to black magic, to pedophilia, to narcotics trafficking, because they're so unhappy deep down, they've become more and more reckless, because they subconsciously, their own flesh subconsciously wants to destroy them.
[02:20:44.822 --> 02:20:51.265]  Because even though their spirits are so evil, you'd think that flesh would be more evil, but from my just understanding and research,
[02:20:51.345 --> 02:20:57.550]  of this innately, their own subconscious mind wants to get rid of them for the greater good of humanity.
[02:20:57.990 --> 02:21:05.376]  That's why they always create these death paradigms, these black holes of war and destruction and collapse.
[02:21:05.837 --> 02:21:11.081]  And that's why anything they touch falls apart is because they innately want death and destruction.
[02:21:11.121 --> 02:21:14.744]  They want to go back like oceans, like rivers flow to the sea.
[02:21:15.184 --> 02:21:18.267]  They want to go back to death, go back to Satan, go back to the devil.
[02:21:18.287 --> 02:21:20.829]  Well, I say get behind me, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:21:21.489 --> 02:21:26.090]  I say get behind humanity and get out of our way because we are coming through.
[02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:27.670]  We are coming through.
[02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:30.171]  So much incredible news on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:30.591 --> 02:21:33.031]  So many amazing video clips coming up.
[02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:34.671]  This is such an incredible time to be alive.
[02:21:34.691 --> 02:21:36.592]  I just want to thank the amazing crew.
[02:21:36.612 --> 02:21:40.552]  I want to thank the sponsors, the listeners, David Knight and everybody else doing a fabulous job.
[02:21:41.092 --> 02:21:41.773]  All the writers.
[02:21:42.533 --> 02:21:47.033]  This is such an incredible time to be alive and I keep just saying that because it's true.
[02:21:47.414 --> 02:21:49.754]  We have to have that spirit of exuberance
[02:21:50.274 --> 02:22:04.693]  In righteousness and in what's good and in free will that God gave us and it will break the enemy and the enemy can feel that spirit and Trump knows this is a battle of good versus evil but it's not the good and the evil these twisted churches teach you
[02:22:05.634 --> 02:22:08.176]  It's beyond that, and everybody can feel it in their gut.
[02:22:08.676 --> 02:22:10.858]  And so light is returning into the world.
[02:22:11.258 --> 02:22:16.301]  Back to David Knight at the Central Texas News Center in Austin on Alex Jones from fullwars.com.
[02:22:16.542 --> 02:22:24.707]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, spread the word, because yes, we're gaining ground, but the enemy is moving against us on every front, so it's more essential now than
[02:22:25.207 --> 02:22:25.408]  Thank you.
[02:22:53.393 --> 02:22:57.134]  Alright, thanks Alex, and we're going to have Leanne McAdoo joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:22:57.154 --> 02:23:05.996]  I'm going to tell you in this segment about Obama's government arresting an ex-Volkswagen official because of Dieselgate.
[02:23:06.056 --> 02:23:15.459]  That's what Obama is doing as Donald Trump is meeting with Ma, the owner of Alibaba, talking about creating a million new jobs.
[02:23:15.499 --> 02:23:16.559]  Think about that contrast.
[02:23:17.435 --> 02:23:39.707]  How these guys hammer down their globalist agenda on things, arresting people, shutting us down with 17,000 IRS agents, shutting down small businesses, while Ma is meeting, talking about how Alibaba with Trump, talking about how they can help small business, how they can focus on a million small businesses, give them a marketplace in which they can sell.
[02:23:40.648 --> 02:23:42.689]  What an amazing contrast.
[02:23:42.749 --> 02:23:46.371]  Now, I want to talk to you about some of the products that we've just introduced recently.
[02:23:47.182 --> 02:23:57.355]  We've got the 80% lower receiver that we're now selling at Infowarsstore.com and I looked at this and I thought, hey, you ought to call this, actually my son Lance said, you ought to call it BuildAR.
[02:23:57.375 --> 02:23:58.557]  Kind of like Build-A-Bear.
[02:23:58.577 --> 02:23:59.318]  Remember that?
[02:23:59.598 --> 02:24:04.825]  You know, you get all the different parts and you put together your own custom gun and that's legal to do that under
[02:24:05.586 --> 02:24:07.967]  BATF regulations, you're allowed to do that.
[02:24:08.187 --> 02:24:16.892]  You can do an 80% lower receiver, you can put that in, you can finish the final steps on that lower receiver, and all the rest of the parts are not regulated.
[02:24:16.932 --> 02:24:18.593]  It's only the lower receiver that is regulated.
[02:24:19.073 --> 02:24:27.197]  This is a new special operator tested 80% lowers, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, designed, patented, and produced in Tennessee.
[02:24:27.797 --> 02:24:30.200]  By the respected Tennessee Arms Manufacturing Group.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:32.822]  It has an unconditional lifetime warranty.
[02:24:33.163 --> 02:24:34.244]  No questions asked.
[02:24:34.284 --> 02:24:35.145]  Return policy.
[02:24:35.525 --> 02:24:37.868]  Uses only marine grade brass.
[02:24:37.888 --> 02:24:39.650]  You can find that at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:43.814]  And you know, when I went to Build-A-Bear, we brought my... Let's go back.
[02:24:44.034 --> 02:24:48.119]  You've all seen Build-A-Bear in the malls, where you go in and you take the girls in and...
[02:24:49.302 --> 02:24:53.286]  They can build their own stuffed animals and they can customize them exactly the way you want it.
[02:24:53.966 --> 02:24:57.669]  And that was a great experience for our daughter when she first came here from China.
[02:24:57.689 --> 02:25:06.757]  But I was totally disturbed by the motto that they've got up at the top there, as you're waiting for them to stuff the bear and assemble all the stuff together.
[02:25:06.777 --> 02:25:11.481]  And it was a take off on Hillary Clinton's, it takes a village.
[02:25:11.501 --> 02:25:14.504]  And it's like, oh, am I really giving money to these people?
[02:25:14.784 --> 02:25:16.805]  So when you do a build AR,
[02:25:17.586 --> 02:25:19.888]  You are contributing to InfoWars.
[02:25:20.008 --> 02:25:21.689]  You're contributing to your own safety.
[02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:33.079]  You're doing something that's going to help you, help your family, and you're not putting money in the pocket of people that are selling this false paradigm that it takes a village or whatever else the liberals are selling at a given time.
[02:25:33.459 --> 02:25:37.501]  And also, don't forget the tactical nanotechnology body armor that we're now selling.
[02:25:37.541 --> 02:25:40.862]  It is a patented form of carbon nanotube technology.
[02:25:41.242 --> 02:25:45.383]  The lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market.
[02:25:45.723 --> 02:25:50.385]  Only a quarter inch thick, it's field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[02:25:50.705 --> 02:25:55.407]  It's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the U.S., comes with a 20-year warranty.
[02:25:55.447 --> 02:25:57.008]  This is state-of-the-art stuff, guys.
[02:25:57.088 --> 02:25:57.888]  This is carbon
[02:25:58.368 --> 02:26:00.028]  Nanotube technology.
[02:26:00.068 --> 02:26:02.689]  That's why it is so lightweight, why it is so strong.
[02:26:02.929 --> 02:26:16.553]  You can get an insert to put it in your backpack, protect yourself in the gun-free zones like airports, like schools, where they foolishly ban all firearms from responsible individuals who can protect themselves and who can protect others.
[02:26:17.053 --> 02:26:19.634]  Let's go to this example here of Volkswagen.
[02:26:19.694 --> 02:26:20.594]  This is reported by RT.
[02:26:21.957 --> 02:26:27.863]  They're saying, in a new twist on Volkswagen's diesel emissions cheating standard, they're now doubling down.
[02:26:27.923 --> 02:26:33.708]  Think about the fact that in the past, we've had situations where Pentos caught fire when they were hit in the rear end.
[02:26:33.988 --> 02:26:35.089]  Was anybody arrested on that?
[02:26:35.149 --> 02:26:35.310]  No.
[02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:40.274]  We had situations when they first started making SUVs and they had a high center of gravity, they would roll over.
[02:26:40.515 --> 02:26:41.115]  People died.
[02:26:41.936 --> 02:26:42.837]  Nobody was arrested.
[02:26:43.558 --> 02:26:48.259]  We've had situations where the government mandated airbags that we knew killed women and children.
[02:26:48.859 --> 02:26:57.662]  And now we've got massive, millions of airbags being recalled because they turn into fatal shotguns, shooting metal shards at you.
[02:26:57.682 --> 02:26:59.602]  We've had a lot of people that have been killed with that.
[02:26:59.722 --> 02:27:04.124]  These things are spontaneously going off because they corrode, they have defects in them.
[02:27:04.424 --> 02:27:12.006]  But even as we learned that these airbags would kill women and small children, the government wouldn't let us turn them off for a long time.
[02:27:12.645 --> 02:27:16.633]  And now they won't let you turn off your airbag, even if it's under recall and you're having to wait for it to be replaced.
[02:27:16.673 --> 02:27:20.540]  But if somebody goes against their climate change agenda...
[02:27:21.497 --> 02:27:29.761]  And says, well, you know, we're going to fudge these numbers or whatever, if they did it intentionally, whatever, fine them or whatever, but you're going to lock these people up in jail?
[02:27:29.801 --> 02:27:30.781]  Nobody died from this.
[02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:33.403]  That is the priority that they put on this.
[02:27:33.743 --> 02:27:38.805]  They've arrested Oliver Schmidt, who headed Volkswagen's regulatory compliance office in the U.S.
[02:27:39.225 --> 02:27:42.707]  from 2014 to March 2015 in Dieselgate.
[02:27:43.007 --> 02:27:44.128]  See, what's behind this?
[02:27:44.868 --> 02:27:46.289]  They want to purge diesels.
[02:27:47.113 --> 02:27:55.720]  Because the diesel engine is the most efficient, the cheapest, most reliable competitor to their battery-powered remote control cars.
[02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:56.901]  And that's what we need to call them.
[02:27:57.141 --> 02:28:04.306]  They are big RC cars that the government and Ford or all the different auto manufacturers can control.
[02:28:04.366 --> 02:28:05.127]  They can watch you.
[02:28:05.447 --> 02:28:06.868]  They can tax your every movement.
[02:28:06.908 --> 02:28:08.609]  They can watch your every movement.
[02:28:08.670 --> 02:28:13.773]  They can put you in their geospatial intelligence database to track everything that you do.
[02:28:14.898 --> 02:28:16.239]  That's why they want this.
[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:25.649]  That, that purpose there, as well as they don't want anything that's going to compete with their technology that quite frankly isn't there.
[02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:27.972]  Their battery technology is not there.
[02:28:28.552 --> 02:28:29.833]  Diesels are a threat to it.
[02:28:30.394 --> 02:28:31.936]  So they came after him with the EPA.
[02:28:31.976 --> 02:28:34.598]  Remember we had Lisa Jackson saying,
[02:28:35.458 --> 02:28:44.650]  We're gonna cut down on fine particulate matter because more people are dying from that than are dying from cancer and it was absolute nonsense and at the same time they were doing it.
[02:28:45.492 --> 02:28:57.236]  They were exposing people in North Carolina, where I was, they were hooking people up to diesel exhaust pipes and selecting people who had respiratory and heart issues so they could push their regulations.
[02:28:57.276 --> 02:28:58.676]  They wanted people to get sick.
[02:28:59.236 --> 02:29:06.598]  They wanted people to be taken to the emergency room after the experiment so they could say, look, look at how bad diesel fuel is, or diesel exhaust is.
[02:29:06.899 --> 02:29:07.999]  We've got to stop diesel engines.
[02:29:08.399 --> 02:29:08.699]  Why?
[02:29:09.119 --> 02:29:14.141]  Because they're efficient and because it pushes back against their electric cars.
[02:29:14.981 --> 02:29:16.903]  Now, we've got just a couple of minutes.
[02:29:16.943 --> 02:29:20.326]  Actually, we're going to wait and play that when Leanne comes in.
[02:29:20.346 --> 02:29:21.567]  We're going to play those clips.
[02:29:22.348 --> 02:29:33.338]  Something that was really brilliant that Darren McBrain remembered from the Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction that relates to this Russia Did It Act.
[02:29:33.358 --> 02:29:34.760]  So we're going to play that when we come back.
[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:37.683]  I think it's interesting, and I don't have time to talk about this.
[02:29:37.723 --> 02:29:39.765]  Maybe we'll get to it later in the hour.
[02:29:40.836 --> 02:29:44.739]  The way they're going to come after Donald Trump, they're going to come after him multiple ways once he becomes president.
[02:29:44.759 --> 02:29:49.904]  One of the first things they're going to do is they're going to come after him saying that he's got conflicts of interest.
[02:29:49.944 --> 02:29:54.848]  I hope we have time to get to that because I want to talk about why that should not be a conflict.
[02:29:55.308 --> 02:29:56.369]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:59.632 --> 02:30:02.655]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.575 --> 02:30:06.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.168 --> 02:30:16.336]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[02:30:16.876 --> 02:30:18.298]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[02:30:19.195 --> 02:30:21.077]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[02:30:21.697 --> 02:30:27.242]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[02:30:27.842 --> 02:30:35.828]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[02:30:35.849 --> 02:30:38.310]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[02:30:38.591 --> 02:30:42.814]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[02:30:43.074 --> 02:30:43.815]  This is how it works.
[02:30:44.115 --> 02:30:44.616]  You order.
[02:30:44.756 --> 02:30:45.556]  Customized or
[02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:48.098]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[02:30:48.579 --> 02:30:51.741]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[02:30:52.041 --> 02:30:56.084]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[02:30:56.305 --> 02:30:57.085]  You cannot lose.
[02:30:57.125 --> 02:30:58.206]  You're funding the Infowar.
[02:30:58.526 --> 02:31:05.271]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[02:31:05.592 --> 02:31:09.555]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[02:31:10.055 --> 02:31:20.464]  A fundraising campaign is underway for that Chicago victim kidnapped by four thugs, forced to drink from the toilet while his hair was cut bald in his clothes, and he was taunted with Trump taunts.
[02:31:20.664 --> 02:31:27.209]  An online fundraising campaign for the family of the Chicago victim has pulled in eight times the amount it was intended to raise.
[02:31:27.229 --> 02:31:35.376]  A GoFundMe campaign that started on January the 5th had an intent of raising $10,000 for the victim and his family, as reported by CBS News.
[02:31:35.496 --> 02:31:39.019]  The campaign account was called, quote, let's show the Chicago victim love
[02:31:39.179 --> 02:31:45.603]  And it's raised a whopping $79,556, about $70,000 more than their target goal of $10,000.
[02:31:45.683 --> 02:31:53.208]  The Daily Caller reporter Amber Randall writes about the fundraising campaign that's underway, saying, quote, The fundraising page reads,

[02:32:27.407 --> 02:32:32.109]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:33:14.673 --> 02:33:20.016]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:33:21.537 --> 02:33:28.020]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[02:33:30.341 --> 02:33:33.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:46.761 --> 02:33:48.042]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:48.062 --> 02:33:50.384]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Leanne McAdoo.
[02:33:50.404 --> 02:34:00.631]  Leanne, when you and Darren McBrain did a report last week that went viral in the nightly news, there was a brilliant piece that Darren remembered and of course that was to go back...
[02:34:01.471 --> 02:34:10.254]  And to compare what Josh Earnest said about the consensus of the intelligence agencies and compare that to what we heard in Iraq.
[02:34:10.274 --> 02:34:14.096]  And I want to play these two clips for you back to back because Donald Trump has talked about this a lot.
[02:34:14.116 --> 02:34:21.019]  He said, hey, we've made costly mistakes before when we had the intelligence agency giving us a consensus report.
[02:34:21.039 --> 02:34:23.540]  So I want to go back and remind you
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:25.961]  How this went down.
[02:34:26.041 --> 02:34:27.521]  Let's play that report.
[02:34:27.541 --> 02:34:33.464]  Let's first play the one from... Let's play Josh Earnest first, if we can do that one first.
[02:34:33.484 --> 02:34:41.548]  This is Josh Earnest, the press secretary for Barack Obama, telling us why it's very important that we believe that the Russians did it.
[02:34:41.788 --> 02:34:43.609]  They hacked our election, whatever that means.
[02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:44.930]  Okay, so here's Josh Earnest.
[02:34:45.728 --> 02:34:46.548]  Quick other question.
[02:34:46.668 --> 02:35:00.736]  So as far as the Russian hacks go, I know normally you can't discuss sources and methods and how you guys are getting intelligence, but can you at least characterize the sort of intelligence that's coming in that proves that this was a Russian hack?
[02:35:00.796 --> 02:35:05.898]  Is it digital fingerprints that you're tracing back to a computer in Russian possession?
[02:35:05.979 --> 02:35:11.882]  Is it human sourcing that you're intercepting phone calls and hearing Russians talk about this kind of thing?
[02:35:12.842 --> 02:35:14.703]  Where's the confidence coming from?
[02:35:14.723 --> 02:35:27.172]  Well, I'm obviously quite limited in what I can say from here, but I think there are a couple of things that I can point to that I think... that I think answer the questions that you've raised.
[02:35:27.292 --> 02:35:28.193]  It's essentially two.
[02:35:28.533 --> 02:35:39.901]  The first is, the statement that was issued by the intelligence community in October of 2016, before the election, making clear that Russia was
[02:35:42.219 --> 02:35:43.140]  Interfering in our election.
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.542]  Represented the consensus view of 17 different intelligence agencies.
[02:35:49.323 --> 02:35:49.623]  Okay.
[02:35:50.524 --> 02:35:52.105]  That's not usually the way intelligence works.
[02:35:52.825 --> 02:35:53.485]  That's the way it works.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:36:02.891]  That kind of unanimity of opinion, particularly when the stakes are so high, is notable.
[02:36:03.769 --> 02:36:07.031]  Have we ever had unanimity of opinion before when the stakes were so high?
[02:36:07.131 --> 02:36:08.752]  Yeah, the stakes were so high.
[02:36:09.152 --> 02:36:11.874]  And Darren remembered this and he went back and he got a clip.
[02:36:11.894 --> 02:36:18.958]  Now I want you to hear Colin Powell telling us about the unanimity in the intelligence community before we went to war in Iraq.
[02:36:20.145 --> 02:36:23.628]  If we had known the intelligence was wrong, we would not have gone into Iraq.
[02:36:24.288 --> 02:36:28.972]  But the intelligence community, all 16 agencies, assured us that it was right.
[02:36:29.993 --> 02:36:32.735]  My speech at the UN was based on that information.
[02:36:33.596 --> 02:36:35.998]  Every statement I make today is backed up by sources.
[02:36:36.598 --> 02:36:37.359]  Solid sources.
[02:36:37.979 --> 02:36:38.940]  These are not assertions.
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:43.924]  What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.
[02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:46.071]  That's great, you know.
[02:36:46.251 --> 02:36:46.431]  Right.
[02:36:47.872 --> 02:36:50.855]  And this is summed up really well in an article by Jeffrey Jackson.
[02:36:51.255 --> 02:36:58.121]  And the title of this, I love the title, How Open Source Intelligence Overtook the DNI Report in Real Time.
[02:36:58.781 --> 02:37:02.324]  See, it's going back and looking at what they said about Iraq.
[02:37:02.865 --> 02:37:04.026]  We have unanimity.
[02:37:04.126 --> 02:37:06.828]  They've all told us, I can't tell you what the details are.
[02:37:06.848 --> 02:37:11.252]  And in this article, he's got a tweet from Glenn Greenwald, and he says this new report, number one,
[02:37:11.852 --> 02:37:13.573]  Literally, half of it is about RT.
[02:37:14.194 --> 02:37:17.877]  Number two, it contains the same assertions that have been made multiple times.
[02:37:17.977 --> 02:37:21.060]  Number three, it includes no evidence for any of these claims.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.343]  You notice how Josh Earnest, when he was asked, point blank, what is your evidence for this?
[02:37:25.723 --> 02:37:26.884]  Well, I can't tell you.
[02:37:26.944 --> 02:37:31.868]  I'd have to kill you if I told you, but the 17 intelligence agents, you can't question that.
[02:37:32.249 --> 02:37:38.254]  And that's exactly, we have Lindsey Graham rolling out now, telling Republicans, celebrating the Russian interference.
[02:37:38.894 --> 02:37:39.915]  You're not a patriot.
[02:37:39.975 --> 02:37:45.902]  So if you just don't agree with what these intelligence agencies are telling us, you are not a patriot.
[02:37:46.243 --> 02:37:47.084]  Fall in line.
[02:37:47.364 --> 02:37:48.145]  Don't question it.
[02:37:48.205 --> 02:37:50.768]  We will not tolerate any silly conspiracy theories.
[02:37:51.048 --> 02:37:53.391]  I mean, it's history repeating itself.
[02:37:53.411 --> 02:37:54.793]  It also says you're a political hack.
[02:37:55.053 --> 02:37:55.153]  Right.
[02:37:55.173 --> 02:37:56.014]  You're putting that out there.
[02:37:56.815 --> 02:38:06.884]  Of all people, as I said yesterday, if you look up political hack in the dictionary, you'll see Lindsey Graham and John McCain pictured right there as exhibits A and B. Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[02:38:07.224 --> 02:38:09.606]  They are the political hacks extraordinaire.
[02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:16.472]  And now all of a sudden they're being paraded out as the ultimate Republicans because they're the ones that are willing to, you know, go against Donald Trump.
[02:38:16.492 --> 02:38:23.017]  Being called a political hack by Lindsey Graham and John McCain is like being called fake news by CNN and the Washington Post.
[02:38:24.478 --> 02:38:44.087]  Well, and I also want to point out that James Comey was the one, you know, now I forget the official title, I did a report on this last week, but he was there in charge, overseeing the satellite feed there in Iraq, and so it was his personal assessment that he then gave to Colin Powell and others, his personal assessment was that he was seeing
[02:38:44.827 --> 02:38:50.572]  These weapons of mass destruction being taken out of Iraq and into Syria in these vehicles.
[02:38:50.752 --> 02:38:51.753]  And no proof, no evidence.
[02:38:51.773 --> 02:38:53.634]  James Comey just keeps showing up in history.
[02:38:53.694 --> 02:38:53.854]  Exactly.
[02:38:53.894 --> 02:38:57.417]  He's like that Woody Allen movie, Zellig, you know, or Forrest Gump.
[02:38:57.437 --> 02:39:00.840]  You know, you got this guy who keeps showing up in all these different places.
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:03.482]  And James Comey doesn't show up in a good way either.
[02:39:03.502 --> 02:39:03.822]  Right.
[02:39:03.962 --> 02:39:05.804]  So here he is giving his personal...
[02:39:06.304 --> 02:39:09.728]  His personal assessment on the weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be wrong.
[02:39:10.129 --> 02:39:22.624]  And then so during this Russian intelligence briefing last week, they said, well, you know, is it a red herring for someone to tie in your faulty assessments in the past to now your assessments on Russia?
[02:39:22.884 --> 02:39:24.085]  Now we can believe you, right?
[02:39:24.205 --> 02:39:27.386]  It's just a red herring to say, wait, you were wrong in the past.
[02:39:27.926 --> 02:39:30.127]  And so he says, yes, I think that is a red herring.
[02:39:30.407 --> 02:39:36.530]  If someone tries to use that as an argument, we know we've learned a lot in the last 13 years and we're not going to make that mistake again.
[02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:38.431]  But they're making the same mistake again.
[02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:43.994]  It's interesting, you know, because we're seeing all of these cyber experts coming back.
[02:39:44.054 --> 02:39:45.835]  I've got people that are contacting me on Twitter.
[02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:50.279]  John McAfee is going to be coming on our show later this week to talk about this.
[02:39:50.699 --> 02:40:06.572]  But they look at this, and the little bit of proof that they do give us, they say, well, it's proof because, look, we have tags that show that it had a time and date stamp somewhere in Russia, or it's going through this server here, or it was done on a Cyrillic keyboard.
[02:40:06.592 --> 02:40:07.873]  And as John McAfee said,
[02:40:08.413 --> 02:40:11.775]  You'd have to be an absolute idiot to leave fingerprints like that.
[02:40:11.875 --> 02:40:12.075]  Right.
[02:40:12.215 --> 02:40:14.376]  They know that they can look at that kind of stuff.
[02:40:14.456 --> 02:40:21.040]  If you're going to do something, you're always going to try to mask it by saying, going through China or making it look like you're coming from somewhere else.
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:22.460]  And of course there are Russian hackers.
[02:40:22.881 --> 02:40:25.082]  I've had white hat hackers who have contacted me.
[02:40:25.102 --> 02:40:26.482]  And again, you don't know the difference.
[02:40:26.522 --> 02:40:31.805]  Black hat hackers are people who break in for their own purposes to steal stuff, to expose stuff or whatever.
[02:40:31.865 --> 02:40:34.647]  White hat hackers are hired as security consultants
[02:40:35.347 --> 02:40:41.418]  To test the security of a business and to report on them where they find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed.
[02:40:41.458 --> 02:40:43.642]  So they're the good guys, the white hat hackers.
[02:40:43.883 --> 02:40:45.305]  And they said, look, we know who these guys are.
[02:40:45.956 --> 02:40:47.277]  They're Russian criminals.
[02:40:47.297 --> 02:40:48.038]  They're well known.
[02:40:48.098 --> 02:40:50.380]  Everybody knows who the players are in this game.
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:51.540]  They've been around for a very long time.
[02:40:51.581 --> 02:40:52.761]  They're not state actors.
[02:40:53.342 --> 02:40:54.763]  And then it gets even more interesting.
[02:40:54.783 --> 02:41:01.468]  We've had multiple tech sources come out and say that the malware that they used is a year and a half, two years old.
[02:41:01.508 --> 02:41:02.870]  They've had three different revisions of it.
[02:41:02.910 --> 02:41:09.135]  I mean, if you're the Russian... The good news is, is that if the CIA is correct,
[02:41:09.815 --> 02:41:24.914]  The Russian cyber operation is so hopelessly inept that we have absolutely nothing to fear from them because they're using malware that's publicly available that is three revs out of date, and they're leaving fingerprints all over the place, so if it really is the Russians, then we have...
[02:41:25.495 --> 02:41:29.359]  Bumbling fools, basically, that were able to somehow influence our election.
[02:41:29.379 --> 02:41:34.965]  But whoever it is, they told us the truth about Hillary, and for that we should be grateful for whoever it is.
[02:41:35.025 --> 02:41:37.567]  And I'll say that to Lindsey Graham.
[02:41:37.668 --> 02:41:42.653]  You know, Lindsey, you and the rest of these people in Washington have been lying to us.
[02:41:42.713 --> 02:41:46.557]  We knew you were lying, and we had the documents this time.
[02:41:46.817 --> 02:41:53.561]  Thanks to Wikileaks and whoever gave them that information and we're going to put that out there and we don't really care if you call us political hacks.
[02:41:53.581 --> 02:41:55.162]  We don't really care if you call us fake news.
[02:41:55.502 --> 02:41:56.463]  You're the political hack.
[02:41:56.823 --> 02:42:04.368]  You're the people who've been covering up the information and who have been lying to us and it was exposed and that's what cost Hillary the election.
[02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:05.068]  Exactly.
[02:42:05.108 --> 02:42:06.109]  We've got the documents.
[02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:08.670]  Yeah, we found out the truth about her.
[02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:19.455]  Right, and that's why I thought it was just really glaring how they said, you know, RT, the Russian government, was using their state-run media to influence the U.S.
[02:42:19.495 --> 02:42:19.975]  elections.
[02:42:20.395 --> 02:42:25.317]  Meanwhile, what we learned from WikiLeaks is that all of the established media here in the U.S.
[02:42:25.397 --> 02:42:25.918]  was being
[02:42:26.898 --> 02:42:29.159]  Use to actually influence the election.
[02:42:29.219 --> 02:42:29.899]  It didn't work.
[02:42:30.099 --> 02:42:33.779]  People were able to see through the lies and the propaganda at this point.
[02:42:33.819 --> 02:42:39.521]  They weren't expecting the rise of the alternative media and the influence and the power just dissenting voices could have.
[02:42:39.901 --> 02:42:50.083]  But that's what we were shown in WikiLeaks is that we were actually having the US media here colluding with the DNC to get their establishment agent in power.
[02:42:50.283 --> 02:42:50.943]  And it didn't work.
[02:42:51.463 --> 02:42:59.049]  We showed there were fake news, we showed there were political hacks that were manipulating the DNC to give Hillary an unfair advantage over Bernie Sanders.
[02:42:59.089 --> 02:43:02.712]  So we saw all that and then they say that we are the political hacks, we are the fake news.
[02:43:02.872 --> 02:43:09.257]  That is what we're now seeing with open source intelligence, what we also call a free internet and a free press.
[02:43:09.797 --> 02:43:14.241]  Okay, that's just a new technical term that puts it back in that context.
[02:43:14.901 --> 02:43:16.702]  That's why we need to have a free internet.
[02:43:16.722 --> 02:43:18.442]  That's why we need to have a free press.
[02:43:18.943 --> 02:43:21.304]  And of course, as I pointed out, Hollywood doesn't like that.
[02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:24.885]  They even want to censor IMDB for telling what their ages are.
[02:43:24.905 --> 02:43:30.407]  Because, you know, actresses, actresses, even writers don't want people to know how old they are in Hollywood.
[02:43:30.427 --> 02:43:32.448]  They all want to pretend that they're Peter Pan.
[02:43:32.728 --> 02:43:36.670]  Well, their writing is kind of juvenile, but they actually do age, unlike Peter Pan.
[02:43:37.591 --> 02:43:53.327]  Well, and of course we've got the New York Times now in an op-ed, not one, but two op-ed articles actually urging people to boycott Breitbart and Andrew Breitbart and doing kind of a hit piece on Andrew and Breitbart, which, I mean, they're so upset about the fact that
[02:43:54.608 --> 02:43:57.289]  Steve Bannon is going to be right there, have the ear of the president.
[02:43:57.349 --> 02:44:00.549]  These Breitbart reporters are going to be right there in the press pool.
[02:44:00.649 --> 02:44:08.131]  I mean, they are just so infuriated that there's this rise of the alternative media that could somehow be more trustworthy.
[02:44:08.151 --> 02:44:15.492]  I mean, the amount of traffic that Breitbart is getting is just crushing the New York Times and these other establishment agencies out there.
[02:44:15.572 --> 02:44:18.853]  And they can't stand it to the point where they're taking
[02:44:19.693 --> 02:44:20.755]  Fascist tactics.
[02:44:21.215 --> 02:44:26.623]  They can't defeat the conservative point of view, so they just want to eliminate these point of views altogether.
[02:44:26.643 --> 02:44:28.506]  Well, we've seen this in the past and of course...
[02:44:29.312 --> 02:44:30.273]  They're not too distant past.
[02:44:30.313 --> 02:44:37.278]  I mean, we still have a lot of newspapers throughout the South that are called things like the Arkansas Democrat Gazette because they were unabashedly partisan.
[02:44:38.118 --> 02:44:43.142]  And they would go after each other, very, very roughly go after each other and really debate this.
[02:44:43.202 --> 02:44:46.004]  But they flew their flag and they were clear.
[02:44:46.244 --> 02:44:49.106]  They didn't try to pretend that they were completely objective.
[02:44:49.547 --> 02:44:53.169]  They said, we represent this point of view and we'll argue for this point of view.
[02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:55.611]  New York Times can be defeated.
[02:44:55.671 --> 02:44:59.995]  I'm not really concerned about the New York Times coming out and calling for a boycott of Breitbart.
[02:45:00.015 --> 02:45:02.237]  The New York Times is gasping for air.
[02:45:02.257 --> 02:45:03.398]  They're gasping for money.
[02:45:03.798 --> 02:45:05.719]  They're grasping at anything that they can do.
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.921]  And this is a fight that they're not going to win.
[02:45:07.961 --> 02:45:17.549]  The New York Times has been able to go on the fact that they are the paper of record or the gray lady and it's true simply because they say it's true.
[02:45:18.189 --> 02:45:19.030]  And that's not true.
[02:45:19.751 --> 02:45:23.294]  And we and Breitbart and other people have had to document
[02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:27.112]  Carefully, what we say when we contradict the New York Times.
[02:45:27.693 --> 02:45:29.095]  And so, we're used to this.
[02:45:29.215 --> 02:45:30.637]  And this is an argument that we can win.
[02:45:30.677 --> 02:45:34.361]  What's dangerous about this, Leanne, is the fact that they're pulling it into the government.
[02:45:34.381 --> 02:45:39.527]  And I hope Donald Trump shuts this down, this new thing that got put into the NDAA, where they funded
[02:45:40.188 --> 02:45:42.931]  The State Department as the arbiters of truth.
[02:45:43.032 --> 02:45:50.581]  That is very dangerous when the government starts attacking the press and starts deciding what is true and what isn't and shutting people down.
[02:45:51.242 --> 02:45:56.848]  If the New York Times wants to go to war with us, the New York Times wants to go to war with Breitbart, fine, bring it on.
[02:45:56.909 --> 02:45:57.870]  We can win that war.
[02:45:58.050 --> 02:45:58.551]  I welcome it.
[02:45:59.161 --> 02:46:03.802]  But when the government comes in and wants to censor us, wants to shut down the internet, that's when it gets really dangerous.
[02:46:03.842 --> 02:46:11.404]  And they funded that now in the State Department to the tune of $80 million a year for them to do that, along with the Defense Department.
[02:46:11.424 --> 02:46:12.284]  That's what's really dangerous.
[02:46:12.384 --> 02:46:13.624]  That is absolutely dangerous.
[02:46:13.664 --> 02:46:19.106]  And of course we know just a few months back, President Obama calling for the Ministry of Truthiness, essentially.
[02:46:20.046 --> 02:46:27.289]  The government would have some sort of control and you'd only have your three state-run news outlets where people could go to get the truth news.
[02:46:27.329 --> 02:46:28.370]  It'd be easier to filter.
[02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:31.171]  And that's the thing, you know, I don't disagree.
[02:46:31.231 --> 02:46:33.011]  It'd be funny if it wasn't so dangerous.
[02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:34.912]  I laughed when I heard that because it's just so stupid.
[02:46:35.372 --> 02:46:39.034]  We need some sort of truthiness filter.
[02:46:39.874 --> 02:46:41.175]  Did you really just say that?
[02:46:41.255 --> 02:46:46.737]  And that's not going to just sound the alarm for all of us who are awake to the, you know, 1984 paradigm that they would like to create.
[02:46:48.638 --> 02:46:58.307]  But, you know, here with Meryl Streep saying that, you know, the media needs to hold Donald Trump to account and the media should be used, the press has to check those in power.
[02:46:58.367 --> 02:46:59.729]  Yes, that's their job.
[02:47:00.049 --> 02:47:02.872]  But they've totally been failing at that for the last eight years.
[02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:08.197]  They've totally failed to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for, I mean, the total mess.
[02:47:08.757 --> 02:47:16.623]  You would have had someone running as Secretary of State and then using her private foundation as kind of a pay-to-play slush fund.
[02:47:17.704 --> 02:47:19.826]  They failed the American people on that.
[02:47:20.447 --> 02:47:25.551]  There was a story where, just to see the bias with the way that they report.
[02:47:26.111 --> 02:47:30.735]  So Donald Trump gives the... Let me look at what Kellyanne Conway said.
[02:47:31.015 --> 02:47:31.255]  Yeah.
[02:47:32.492 --> 02:47:33.413]  Retort that she had.
[02:47:33.473 --> 02:47:35.074]  She said, you don't really have a problem.
[02:47:35.134 --> 02:47:41.260]  It really didn't pull at your heartstrings to see that white kid being bullied and beaten, kidnapped and abused.
[02:47:41.881 --> 02:47:43.122]  You didn't have anything to say about that.
[02:47:43.162 --> 02:47:44.263]  That didn't pull at your heartstrings.
[02:47:44.503 --> 02:47:53.011]  It didn't pull at your heartstrings when you gave a standing ovation to Roman Polanski when he was charged with raping a 13 year old girl.
[02:47:53.051 --> 02:47:53.631]  You didn't have a problem.
[02:47:53.651 --> 02:47:55.073]  You gave him a standing ovation.
[02:47:56.154 --> 02:47:59.115]  You don't have a problem with aborting babies and selling their body parts?
[02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.837]  You don't have a problem with setting the Middle East on fire?
[02:48:01.177 --> 02:48:02.938]  Meryl Streep, you don't have a problem with any of that stuff?
[02:48:02.958 --> 02:48:06.720]  You got a problem with this phony hoax that's been put out there by the media?
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:10.043]  And we showed that Mark Dice video where we showed time and time again
[02:48:10.683 --> 02:48:12.665]  Donald Trump has used those gestures.
[02:48:12.985 --> 02:48:20.831]  We're talking about multiple situations, and they said, oh, well, in this particular situation, that guy really did have a withered arm, and so you're making fun of him.
[02:48:20.892 --> 02:48:21.432]  No, he wasn't.
[02:48:21.452 --> 02:48:22.673]  That's just his gesture.
[02:48:22.693 --> 02:48:24.875]  That's just an idiosyncrasy when he talks.
[02:48:24.895 --> 02:48:25.836]  He does his hands that way.
[02:48:25.896 --> 02:48:27.457]  He wasn't making fun of that guy in particular.
[02:48:27.617 --> 02:48:38.544]  Right, and it's just really incredible that you have to go to such limits to show the video back-to-back-to-back, like Mark Dice did, of showing it, because the media won't do that.
[02:48:38.584 --> 02:48:50.012]  They'll just take it and run, and they'll say, you're right, he was making fun of that person, and then this is a lie that gets repeated, and so many people, even on Facebook and others, are just sharing this lie, this total lie.
[02:48:50.592 --> 02:48:56.897]  But the story that I was going to talk about was the fact that Donald Trump and his team, the ambassadors that
[02:48:57.677 --> 02:49:05.861]  That the presidents are able to appoint, which we know now it's very politically charged and if you donate enough money then you can go and represent a certain country or whatever.
[02:49:05.881 --> 02:49:09.083]  They have political ambassadors and they have career ambassadors.
[02:49:09.203 --> 02:49:09.603]  Correct.
[02:49:09.643 --> 02:49:10.384]  They get the work done.
[02:49:10.584 --> 02:49:10.804]  Right.
[02:49:10.964 --> 02:49:16.627]  And so basically Donald Trump has told all of Obama's appointees, you guys gotta go.
[02:49:16.887 --> 02:49:21.209]  You know, you have to go when my team gets in because they're going to replace you.
[02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:24.171]  And so the stories now are, ugh!
[02:49:24.651 --> 02:49:31.474]  Usually you give a little bit of time for the people, especially those who have children in school, but he's just kicking them out.
[02:49:31.534 --> 02:49:33.675]  You know, these are people who are super wealthy.
[02:49:33.735 --> 02:49:38.637]  I think they can handle it, you know, if they need to figure out what to do with their kids, with their private schooling.
[02:49:39.198 --> 02:49:45.320]  But this is the exact same thing that the Obama administration did when he booted out Bush's appointees.
[02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:50.863]  He said, you guys got to go on the date when, on my inauguration, when I'm in, you guys are out.
[02:49:51.403 --> 02:49:52.824]  But the way that they reported it then was,
[02:49:53.584 --> 02:49:58.009]  This is going to allow everything to just be a fresh start and how great will it be?
[02:49:58.250 --> 02:50:02.034]  You know, it's just that shows the glaring bias in the media.
[02:50:02.074 --> 02:50:03.856]  And so this was, you know, eight years ago.
[02:50:03.936 --> 02:50:09.383]  Imagine how much fake news we've been being fed, even just via the channel of bias.
[02:50:09.803 --> 02:50:10.544]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:10.564 --> 02:50:13.728]  Think about the fact that, you know, as we talked about last week,
[02:50:14.696 --> 02:50:17.617]  Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize immediately taking office.
[02:50:17.637 --> 02:50:18.317]  They gave him a peace prize.
[02:50:18.337 --> 02:50:21.898]  He hadn't done anything, good or bad, but they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:50:21.938 --> 02:50:25.839]  And yet this is a guy who's had twice the number of wars as Bush.
[02:50:26.239 --> 02:50:28.920]  He's the only president to have been at war the entire eight years.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:32.361]  So he not only kept what Bush had done, but he expanded it.
[02:50:33.181 --> 02:50:40.027]  And then he accelerated things like assassination by the CIA of people abroad, American citizens abroad, without due process.
[02:50:40.648 --> 02:50:44.551]  They dropped 25,000 bombs, but they happened to miss all the ISIS locations.
[02:50:44.791 --> 02:50:47.553]  You know, so he restarts the Cold War.
[02:50:47.894 --> 02:50:50.916]  He creates a war here at home between the police and BLM.
[02:50:51.357 --> 02:50:53.238]  I mean, this this is absolutely insane.
[02:50:53.258 --> 02:50:54.659]  Yet this is our Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:50:54.719 --> 02:50:57.622]  And this is the guy that they dearly love.
[02:50:57.662 --> 02:50:58.082]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.102 --> 02:51:00.524]  We're going to be right back with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:51:00.564 --> 02:51:01.125]  I'm David Knight.
[02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:18.511]  Dr. Nick Baggage, best-selling author, researcher, joins us.
[02:51:18.671 --> 02:51:20.572]  EarthPulse.com.
[02:51:21.032 --> 02:51:22.032]  Not a conspiracy theorist.
[02:51:22.052 --> 02:51:26.674]  He goes off the patents, off the facts, and let me tell you, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[02:51:26.974 --> 02:51:28.274]  Dr. Baggage, thanks for coming on.
[02:51:29.015 --> 02:51:30.175]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:51:30.195 --> 02:51:34.016]  It's been way too long, and it's always great to be with you.
[02:51:34.056 --> 02:51:36.597]  You pioneered exposing this whole plan.
[02:51:36.637 --> 02:51:37.457]  I mean, here we are.
[02:51:38.197 --> 02:51:39.418]  What are they not telling us about?
[02:51:40.118 --> 02:51:49.781]  Well, you know, I think the idea of convenience is really the sales pitch that we've installed on virtually all of these technologies over the years.
[02:51:49.841 --> 02:51:54.542]  And the fact of the matter is, the convenience, you give up an awful lot.
[02:51:54.562 --> 02:51:58.103]  You know, we used to think about privacy as the doorway to our home.
[02:51:58.403 --> 02:52:03.024]  Today, it's our digital doorway, which means we really have to look
[02:52:03.624 --> 02:52:04.865]  At what is being collected.
[02:52:05.126 --> 02:52:10.971]  All of these devices, all of this convenience, is about cataloging information on people.
[02:52:11.392 --> 02:52:19.960]  We wrote about this 16 years ago in the book, Earth Rising, The Revolution, talking about what was coming in terms of surveillance and technology.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:26.546]  In the past time, many don't remember, but in Great Britain and London, you had no presumption of privacy no matter where you went.
[02:52:26.566 --> 02:52:27.928]  They had cameras on every corner.
[02:52:28.368 --> 02:52:29.709]  Microphones on every corner.
[02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:36.693]  New York was headed that way back then, and now we have an entire country believing that is the way to go.
[02:52:36.954 --> 02:52:43.618]  They're the ones actually bringing in the unvetted refugees, 80% of military-age men, to create the even bigger crisis.
[02:52:44.438 --> 02:52:44.638]  Right.
[02:52:44.778 --> 02:52:49.180]  And when you think about this, the idea, you know, I mean, even look at our southern border.
[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:54.502]  Our southern border, 10% of the adult population has been running away to the United States for years.
[02:52:55.642 --> 02:52:55.882]  What?
[02:52:56.342 --> 02:52:57.102]  What are we doing?
[02:52:57.383 --> 02:53:01.924]  You know, I mean, we're supporting the closest thing to a dictatorship in Mexico.
[02:53:01.944 --> 02:53:04.505]  Yeah, they have elections if you want to call them elections.
[02:53:04.945 --> 02:53:08.988]  But the fact of the matter is, it's one of the most corrupt countries right on our border.
[02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:10.069]  We support them.
[02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:14.393]  Every time their people try and have a revolution, we suppress it, we get involved in it.
[02:53:14.413 --> 02:53:17.295]  You know, we had a revolution a little over 200 years ago.
[02:53:17.315 --> 02:53:18.876]  It served us real well.
[02:53:19.416 --> 02:53:26.081]  And personally, I believe that every country is in charge, has a right to self-determination without interference.
[02:53:26.182 --> 02:53:31.506]  And if their population is running away from a corrupt government, what are we doing supporting them?
[02:53:31.586 --> 02:53:33.287]  And this happens all around the world.
[02:53:33.567 --> 02:53:42.801]  Their own people now are decompartmentalized because of the internet, and their own panopticon spy grid is biting them in the butt with their own NSA system.
[02:53:43.322 --> 02:53:45.706]  They're trying to change the subject now, saying, oh, it's the Russians.
[02:53:45.766 --> 02:53:47.548]  I mean, is that what you're getting at, Dr. Beckett?
[02:53:48.882 --> 02:53:57.427]  And you know, when I look at this, you know, our government has been responsible for kidnapping, torture, extortion, bribery.
[02:53:57.807 --> 02:54:01.049]  I mean, all the felonies that are the class A felonies, right?
[02:54:01.609 --> 02:54:03.790]  And this is our government representing us in the world?
[02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:05.171]  I don't think so.
[02:54:20.242 --> 02:54:21.382]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:21.402 --> 02:54:22.863]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:54:22.883 --> 02:54:33.445]  I want to talk briefly about one line of attack that we see developing against Donald Trump as soon as he becomes president, and that is coming after him with a conflict of interest charge.
[02:54:33.465 --> 02:54:35.526]  And we're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[02:54:35.566 --> 02:54:40.887]  Before we do, I want to remind you that we have the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[02:54:41.553 --> 02:54:44.737]  And of course that's the name of our new special.
[02:54:45.077 --> 02:54:51.165]  30% off Brain Force, 30% off Super Male Vitality, 30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:54:51.525 --> 02:54:53.528]  We also have 20% off several products.
[02:54:53.588 --> 02:54:59.655]  Secret 12, that's our vitamin B12 formulation that's in a liquid format, very easily assimilated, very easy to take.
[02:55:00.356 --> 02:55:04.418]  Liver Shield, Knockout, our all-natural sleep aid, and Prostagard.
[02:55:04.438 --> 02:55:05.779]  All those are 20% off.
[02:55:05.899 --> 02:55:07.600]  The other products were 30% off.
[02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:10.141]  You'll find that all at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:10.221 --> 02:55:18.225]  And remember, as you're setting up your plan, as you're setting up what you're going to be doing for the next year, remember how powerful habit is.
[02:55:19.085 --> 02:55:20.286]  And that's a very key thing.
[02:55:20.366 --> 02:55:23.247]  Now is the time to set up habits that you can sustain.
[02:55:23.267 --> 02:55:26.529]  One of the ways to do that is to make sure that you're on AutoShip.
[02:55:27.129 --> 02:55:31.131]  We want to make sure that we have a smooth delivery flow of things.
[02:55:31.171 --> 02:55:35.113]  And so we've set up some real incentives here to get you to sign up for AutoShip.
[02:55:35.173 --> 02:55:37.995]  If you sign up for that, you get 10% off of everything that you order.
[02:55:38.815 --> 02:55:45.581]  And if your orders are more than $50, if you set up that recurring order and it's more than $50, you always get free shipping.
[02:55:45.681 --> 02:55:52.807]  And you always make sure, because we'll hold this stuff in reserve for you, you always make sure that nothing is ever out of stock.
[02:55:52.867 --> 02:55:56.450]  So you keep that habit going and you support InfoWars.
[02:55:56.490 --> 02:55:57.831]  So we really appreciate your support.
[02:55:57.852 --> 02:56:04.717]  We've offered you some great sales here at the beginning of the year to help you get into some new healthy habits.
[02:56:05.615 --> 02:56:14.222]  Leanne, when I'm looking at the way the Democrats are going to come, of course you're seeing a lot of push on this conflict of interest.
[02:56:14.242 --> 02:56:24.590]  We've got Elizabeth Warren, the preachy schoolmarm, because she really was a schoolmarm, so there's not much of a reach for her, but she continues to push on ethics.
[02:56:25.131 --> 02:56:28.053]  She was one of the first ones to come out last week when the Republicans
[02:56:29.494 --> 02:56:32.637]  Amazingly, he said, well, the first thing we're going to do is gut the Ethics Committee.
[02:56:33.098 --> 02:56:35.840]  And so that was just cannon fodder for the Democrats.
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.101]  But Trump shut that down.
[02:56:37.121 --> 02:56:37.622]  He goes, really?
[02:56:37.642 --> 02:56:40.144]  You know, you've got other things that you can do that you ought to do.
[02:56:40.184 --> 02:56:44.489]  Well, Elizabeth Warren was one of the ones jumping out there, like Nancy Pelosi.
[02:56:44.609 --> 02:56:47.511]  They both have a lot of ethics issues.
[02:56:47.892 --> 02:56:51.035]  Remember, Nancy Pelosi was doing the insider trading, so then she got caught on it.
[02:56:51.075 --> 02:56:52.636]  They said, well, it's not technically illegal.
[02:56:53.517 --> 02:56:55.780]  Uh, maybe it's unethical for us to do insider trading.
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:12.920]  And so we'll set up the Stock Act, and then within just a few months after everybody stopped paying attention, unanimously, within 12, with a 12-second vote, 12 seconds, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi gutted the Stock Act, but not before he had situations like Elizabeth Warren
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:16.941]  Who didn't disclose $1.3 million credit line from Bank of America that she got.
[02:57:16.961 --> 02:57:19.282]  She said, well, you know, hey, it was just a line of credit.
[02:57:19.322 --> 02:57:20.883]  It wasn't really a mortgage.
[02:57:21.363 --> 02:57:26.025]  And at the time, the Daily Caller said, well, actually, they were quoting Colin Reed, the Republican opposition.
[02:57:26.085 --> 02:57:35.288]  He said, splitting hairs between a line of credit and a mortgage to try to explain away potential violations of federal disclosure law is a very 1% kind of problem to have.
[02:57:35.748 --> 02:57:40.610]  Particularly when the loan in question is to the tune of 1.3 million dollars.
[02:57:40.690 --> 02:57:43.370]  Now they're saying they're going to come after Donald Trump with conflict of interest.
[02:57:43.811 --> 02:57:49.612]  We've had a lot of people point out this is not going to be simple for him to divest himself from his business interests.
[02:57:49.632 --> 02:57:54.894]  And of course Rand Paul said you knew he had all these complex business dealings when he ran for office.
[02:57:55.134 --> 02:57:56.175]  And people said it's okay.
[02:57:57.857 --> 02:58:04.804]  I think we don't want to have career politicians and lawyers and community organizers only being elected.
[02:58:04.844 --> 02:58:11.510]  And that's really what they're going to push for if they hold to this conflict of interest law and say that he's got to divest himself.
[02:58:11.530 --> 02:58:15.414]  There's no practical way that he can do this in the amount of time that there is here.
[02:58:15.734 --> 02:58:15.874]  Right.
[02:58:15.894 --> 02:58:17.436]  Well, what would they have done with Mitt Romney?
[02:58:17.964 --> 02:58:18.625]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:18.685 --> 02:58:20.686]  Well, I'm glad that he didn't get in either.
[02:58:21.207 --> 02:58:25.890]  You know, with a situation like Donald Trump, he's got all these different businesses, scattered businesses.
[02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:29.053]  They said, this is a, this is even Politico talking about it.
[02:58:29.473 --> 02:58:30.914]  Politico that hates Donald Trump.
[02:58:30.934 --> 02:58:33.196]  They said it's complicated, it's costly, it's time-consuming.
[02:58:33.956 --> 02:58:47.042]  You're not going to be able to do this and we're going to talk about this when we come back and you've got some other issues here but I don't think we simply want career politicians and people who are going to remain in Washington as lobbyists to be allowed to serve in office.
[02:58:47.102 --> 02:58:50.003]  We want people who have accomplished something and have something.
[02:58:50.383 --> 02:58:52.324]  Stay with us we'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:58:52.364 --> 02:58:54.285]  Join us tonight at 7 central 8 p.m.
[02:58:54.345 --> 02:58:57.066]  Eastern for the Infowars Nightly News if you're not going to be coming back.
[02:59:00.646 --> 02:59:15.452]  Well, if you were too busy and didn't watch the Golden Globes last night, where liberal stars like Meryl Streep were reveling in the loss of her party and her platform, and blaming Donald Trump for picking on a, quote, handicapped reporter, here's some more fake news for you.
[02:59:15.612 --> 02:59:22.635]  The totalitarian left has decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on merits, they would just prefer to eliminate them altogether.
[02:59:22.875 --> 02:59:36.859]  The New York Times and two op-ed articles on Sunday's review, The Grey Lady Attacks Breitbart News and its Founder, Andrew Breitbart, encourages an effort to destroy the company by appealing directly to advertisers not to support their website.
[02:59:37.019 --> 02:59:41.240]  One article reads, quote, how to destroy the business model of Breitbart and fake news.
[02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:49.002]  It's celebrating the flagging efforts of anonymous Twitter trolls who've tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News.
[02:59:49.202 --> 02:59:57.469]  These would-be censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views on their merits, they're just going to try to eliminate them altogether.
[02:59:57.649 --> 03:00:00.231]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:00:01.812 --> 03:00:05.915]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:06.436 --> 03:00:07.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.211 --> 03:00:22.353]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:22.874 --> 03:00:28.019]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:34.045 --> 03:00:34.966]  I want you.
[03:00:35.827 --> 03:00:36.788]  I need you.
[03:00:37.669 --> 03:00:39.791]  I want you to be my tonight.
[03:00:41.739 --> 03:00:46.065]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:46.085 --> 03:00:47.566]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:00:47.586 --> 03:00:50.210]  We're gonna find out what Leanne has got coming up for the fourth hour.
[03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:51.552]  She's gonna be hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:52.262 --> 03:00:59.767]  And as we were just talking during the break, we really don't want to have only career politicians and lawyers in Washington.
[03:01:00.348 --> 03:01:01.769]  And I think this is a very key thing.
[03:01:01.789 --> 03:01:04.811]  There is not anything that prohibits this.
[03:01:04.831 --> 03:01:12.656]  You know, when you have Elizabeth Warren talking about this conflict of interest, she's saying this is going to be unconstitutional.
[03:01:12.716 --> 03:01:17.820]  She said, Donald Trump, if he doesn't sell off his assets, could be at risk of violating the Constitution.
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:18.781]  It blocks the President
[03:01:19.381 --> 03:01:35.990]  From accepting any present emolument, I can't even pronounce that, but don't take one because it's against the Constitution, any kind of office or title of any kind whatsoever from any king, prince, or foreign state.
[03:01:36.470 --> 03:01:43.473]  Now, when I look at that Leanne, I wonder, did she have a problem with Hillary Clinton taking gifts from a Saudi prince?
[03:01:43.494 --> 03:01:47.976]  Saudi Arabia, the million dollar birthday present for Bill Clinton, I don't think so.
[03:01:48.356 --> 03:01:49.518]  Yeah, Qatar and all them.
[03:01:49.778 --> 03:01:51.842]  They bragged about the fact and then they took it down.
[03:01:51.882 --> 03:01:54.867]  They said, yeah, we've contributed about 25% of what Hillary Clinton's gotten.
[03:01:54.887 --> 03:01:57.291]  Saudi Prince said that at one point in time.
[03:01:57.472 --> 03:02:00.637]  What about all the foreign governments that bought influence with Hillary Clinton?
[03:02:01.551 --> 03:02:07.136]  Through the Clinton Foundation and yet Elizabeth Warren didn't seem to have a problem with those ethics.
[03:02:07.156 --> 03:02:16.764]  It seems like her ethics are very much a partisan issue to me and I'm very concerned about this because this is going to be a key point of attack.
[03:02:16.824 --> 03:02:19.667]  They may even try to impeach Donald Trump over this.
[03:02:19.707 --> 03:02:24.031]  They're going to be fighting him continually over the money that he has and yet Politico points out
[03:02:24.591 --> 03:02:35.678]  That rolling in all the real estate and the royalty contracts, all the other orphan businesses that he has like wineries and steak businesses, it's a little hard to imagine any public companies that resemble what his business is.
[03:02:35.758 --> 03:02:40.761]  So he's not going to just be able to roll this all together and do some kind of an IPO or roll this off to somebody else.
[03:02:40.821 --> 03:02:42.662]  He's got a very complicated, very diverse
[03:02:43.502 --> 03:02:45.343]  A business situation here, yeah.
[03:02:45.843 --> 03:02:46.984]  And it's a hodgepodge of things.
[03:02:47.004 --> 03:02:48.845]  They said it could take a while, it could take at least a year.
[03:02:48.885 --> 03:02:51.266]  So all that time they're going to say you've got a conflict of interest.
[03:02:51.286 --> 03:02:52.987]  They're going to be constantly attacking him on that.
[03:02:53.027 --> 03:03:05.174]  So that is another fight that we're going to be fighting in terms of understanding that we've had other presidents who had businesses and they didn't, George Washington didn't have to sell his farm.
[03:03:05.814 --> 03:03:08.676]  He returned to it afterwards and that was a point of honor.
[03:03:09.176 --> 03:03:13.438]  And yet, there again, we see them complaining, because look at all these generals that Donald Trump has appointed.
[03:03:13.478 --> 03:03:15.639]  Yeah, you know, we've had some pretty good generals as president.
[03:03:15.659 --> 03:03:20.241]  We had General Washington, we had General Eisenhower, we had some good generals as president.
[03:03:20.261 --> 03:03:29.905]  Well, that's why he wants a retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn at his side, because he doesn't believe, he doesn't trust the intelligence information coming from those currently in charge.
[03:03:30.125 --> 03:03:30.585]  Nor should he.
[03:03:30.845 --> 03:03:31.045]  Right.
[03:03:31.446 --> 03:03:32.506]  And how dare he?
[03:03:32.707 --> 03:03:39.712]  He's not a patriot for not just buying up what these 17 intelligence agencies are saying is fact without presenting you any evidence.
[03:03:40.172 --> 03:03:41.854]  Tell us what we've got coming up in the fourth hour.
[03:03:42.094 --> 03:03:52.982]  Well, Owen Shroyer will be joining me at the bottom half and I know he's really outraged and ready to rant about this whole Meryl Streep thing with Hollywood and thank goodness the American people are just
[03:03:53.965 --> 03:03:59.130]  Finally done with these people as our heroes who can lecture us and tell us what to do.
[03:03:59.150 --> 03:04:03.073]  That's why she's ranting and raving to her own comrades there.
[03:04:03.594 --> 03:04:07.898]  But we're also going to talk a little bit about who is behind the takedown of Drudge.
[03:04:08.398 --> 03:04:19.989]  Meanwhile, we've got New York Times urging fascism against Breitbart, the totalitarian authoritarianism, and then just the party of Davos, the Davos Economic
[03:04:20.529 --> 03:04:28.675]  The forum is coming up here in January, and it'll be very interesting to see how they discuss this populist uprising that's going on.
[03:04:28.815 --> 03:04:36.221]  People are rejecting their globalism around the world, and these are the people attending the Party of Davos.
[03:04:36.782 --> 03:04:40.244]  They're the ones who are really benefiting from this globalist agenda.
[03:04:40.324 --> 03:04:42.126]  It'll be interesting to see the pushback there.
[03:04:42.446 --> 03:04:51.495]  And as I pointed out, they used Hollywood to give that a real glossy appearance and to sell that to the American public.
[03:04:51.815 --> 03:04:54.898]  You know, globalism in a one-world government, that's a real sexy thing.
[03:04:55.099 --> 03:04:59.343]  If the Hollywood elite like it, then you just ought to go with the banking elite.
[03:04:59.403 --> 03:05:02.246]  Everybody, all the elites of all these industries, just tell us what to do.
[03:05:02.526 --> 03:05:03.667]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:05:03.727 --> 03:05:05.789]  Leanne McAdoo will be hosting the fourth hour.
[03:05:05.829 --> 03:05:06.230]  Thank you, Leanne.
[03:05:10.390 --> 03:05:11.391]  It's headline news.
[03:05:11.451 --> 03:05:12.952]  The fourth estate is dead.
[03:05:13.452 --> 03:05:18.135]  So people are just getting, for the majority, those that aren't concerned about getting more information.
[03:05:18.735 --> 03:05:37.126]  So when you hear the headlines coming from places like the Washington Post, you know, saying that the Russians hacked the Vermont electric system, and then you read the comments, and the comments by, for instance, the governor of Vermont,
[03:05:37.966 --> 03:05:41.127]  Peter Shumlin, or is it Shumplin?
[03:05:41.847 --> 03:05:52.031]  Quote, Ramontes and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world's leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid.
[03:05:53.263 --> 03:05:58.468]  Which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health and safety.
[03:05:59.128 --> 03:06:08.817]  This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling.
[03:06:09.437 --> 03:06:12.900]  Would this guy go to the George Goebbels School of Journalism?
[03:06:13.781 --> 03:06:27.414]  What a little clown of a man, putting out a statement like this, on information that's now, according to the Department of Homeland Security, quote, no evidence hackers infected Vermont power grid.
[03:06:27.434 --> 03:06:29.556]  This is pure McCarthyism.
[03:06:29.816 --> 03:06:36.543]  What this little lowlife of a guy, this Governor Peter Chumlin, a Democrat from Vermont.
[03:06:36.803 --> 03:06:37.984]  I want to read you another one.
[03:06:38.925 --> 03:06:46.795]  And they're out there promoting that Russia tried to turn the lights out two days after it's admitted to be more made-up crap.
[03:06:57.739 --> 03:06:59.140]  Here's what he says, this Welch.
[03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:00.121]  He said,
[03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:31.963]  They admit it was fake.
[03:07:32.123 --> 03:07:32.804]  They made it up.
[03:07:33.204 --> 03:07:33.785]  It's a lie.
[03:07:33.805 --> 03:07:34.926]  It's a virus on a laptop.
[03:07:35.206 --> 03:07:36.427]  That's generally all over the world.
[03:07:36.447 --> 03:07:37.228]  Nothing to do with Russia.
[03:07:37.248 --> 03:07:39.190]  DHS admits it's all fake.
[03:07:39.470 --> 03:07:40.691]  The Washington Post had to retract.
[03:07:41.152 --> 03:07:47.057]  They're coming out today still being lazy, not getting with the program that, oh, this has already been retracted.
[03:07:47.458 --> 03:07:48.258]  This fake news.
[03:07:49.179 --> 03:07:50.060]  Has already fallen.
[03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:52.761]  Again, Russia doesn't want war.
[03:07:52.881 --> 03:07:54.062]  Russia isn't expanding.
[03:07:54.482 --> 03:07:55.843]  Russia wants to work with us.
[03:07:56.123 --> 03:07:57.223]  They would never do something.
[03:07:57.243 --> 03:08:02.226]  They've had their own airliners being blown up, and they still don't call it terror because they know Obama's behind it.
[03:08:02.386 --> 03:08:04.027]  So again, they have no motive to do it.
[03:08:04.327 --> 03:08:09.990]  It's admitted it's fake, and Democrat governors are running around still saying that Putin did it.
[03:08:21.977 --> 03:08:31.125]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.566 --> 03:08:35.129]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:35.309 --> 03:08:38.191]  I am your host for the fourth hour, Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[03:08:38.311 --> 03:08:41.334]  Owen Schroyer is going to be joining me at the bottom half of the hour.
[03:08:41.354 --> 03:08:48.701]  And we're going to be talking a little bit about the pushback against the Hollywood elites lecturing us and telling us what's what.
[03:08:49.861 --> 03:08:51.122]  Apparently they didn't get the memo.
[03:08:51.142 --> 03:08:55.343]  Donald Trump has been elected and nobody is listening to them anymore.
[03:08:55.603 --> 03:09:02.666]  But, you know, Michael Moore and his ilk are now calling for 100 days of resistance against the Trump presidency.
[03:09:03.066 --> 03:09:11.709]  Meryl Streep is calling on the foreign press to do their job and, you know, fight Donald Trump at every single turn.
[03:09:12.529 --> 03:09:20.791]  But before the break, David Knight was kind of talking about the conflicts of interest and how that's going to be something that we're really going to have to be combating with.
[03:09:21.091 --> 03:09:34.434]  And, you know, I know here at InfoWars we also kind of push back against the nepotism and, you know, just giving your comrades there the good cushy jobs, the corporatism.
[03:09:35.578 --> 03:09:41.841]  So it's sort of interesting to see Donald Trump is putting Jared Kushner, for instance, his son-in-law.
[03:09:42.661 --> 03:09:46.022]  He is going to be there with the direct ear of the president.
[03:09:46.163 --> 03:09:51.325]  And of course, Ivanka Trump is going to have a very pivotal role in President Trump's White House.
[03:09:52.205 --> 03:09:59.311]  And normally maybe that would kind of put up some red flags for me, but frankly, who the heck can Donald Trump trust?
[03:10:00.072 --> 03:10:02.294]  That's how I feel with having his family.
[03:10:02.334 --> 03:10:08.819]  Not only, you know, have they proven themselves to be very astute in the business world, so they do kind of know what they're talking about in that respect,
[03:10:09.580 --> 03:10:28.575]  But here we have people, an establishment, who has made no bones about the fact that they are absolutely against a Donald Trump presidency, even to the point where we have people calling for 100 days of resistance, season of civil disobedience, in response to Donald Trump.
[03:10:29.556 --> 03:10:30.257]  Yes, there we go.
[03:10:30.317 --> 03:10:33.839]  Son-in-law Jared Kushner is going to be named the senior White House advisor.
[03:10:35.543 --> 03:10:38.626]  A lot of people are saying, oh goodness, well here we go with this nepotism.
[03:10:39.907 --> 03:10:48.576]  But Donald Trump has said, this was back in August, that he doesn't trust the intelligence information that's coming out.
[03:10:48.616 --> 03:10:51.378]  He doesn't trust the information coming from those currently in charge.
[03:10:52.279 --> 03:11:02.431]  This was his blunt explanation for why he wants retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn at his side as he was getting these classified intelligence briefings at FBI headquarters.
[03:11:03.032 --> 03:11:05.475]  He wanted someone on his side that he could actually trust.
[03:11:06.096 --> 03:11:06.837]  Now why is that?
[03:11:08.098 --> 03:11:16.965]  Well, if you'll recall, in the days running up to the election, there was this narrative that Donald Trump was a loose cannon.
[03:11:17.225 --> 03:11:18.366]  That was the buzzword at the time.
[03:11:18.426 --> 03:11:19.127]  Loose cannon.
[03:11:19.627 --> 03:11:23.890]  And we saw actually with the WikiLeaks, the DNC was actually putting that out in their emails.
[03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:25.532]  We need to use the term loose cannon.
[03:11:26.312 --> 03:11:28.414]  So we had Harry Reid.
[03:11:28.574 --> 03:11:37.541]  I want you to take a listen to what Harry Reid was telling a reporter at the time of how they should treat the loose cannon Donald Trump.
[03:11:38.988 --> 03:11:39.989]  Give him fake briefings.
[03:11:40.409 --> 03:11:41.370]  Pretend you're briefing him.
[03:11:41.390 --> 03:11:43.532]  Don't tell him anything that you don't want to get out.
[03:11:43.552 --> 03:11:45.254]  That's how I feel about it.
[03:11:45.774 --> 03:11:47.816]  I think that the man is a loose cannon.
[03:11:48.557 --> 03:11:53.902]  I think he's done so much to hurt our country with our international relations already.
[03:11:55.043 --> 03:11:57.565]  How many, isn't he entitled to get those briefings?
[03:11:57.706 --> 03:11:58.687]  Give him fake briefings.
[03:11:59.247 --> 03:12:00.048]  What does that even mean?
[03:12:00.388 --> 03:12:02.530]  It means he'll tell him stuff, he won't know the difference.
[03:12:02.590 --> 03:12:05.773]  You're basically telling the intelligence community to lie to him.
[03:12:06.054 --> 03:12:09.637]  No, I'm not going to lie to you, but I still have to tell you everything.
[03:12:10.658 --> 03:12:11.378]  It's not a lie.
[03:12:11.398 --> 03:12:12.639]  It's fake news.
[03:12:13.619 --> 03:12:20.822]  So there you see, obviously Harry Reid got the memo from the DNC that he needs to refer to Donald Trump as a loose cannon.
[03:12:21.243 --> 03:12:24.404]  So like we know, it's the fake left-right divide.
[03:12:24.424 --> 03:12:26.305]  They're all kind of colluding together.
[03:12:26.605 --> 03:12:29.986]  So here Donald Trump knows he's going to be getting these fake intel briefings.
[03:12:30.006 --> 03:12:31.007]  Here we have Harry Reid.
[03:12:31.727 --> 03:12:35.532]  Just saying this on live national television.
[03:12:35.893 --> 03:12:41.960]  Give him a fake contemporary because they truly did not think that he was going to become the next president of the United States of America.
[03:12:43.206 --> 03:13:06.425]  So now fast forward a few months, we have the CIA and all of these 17 intelligence agencies are just so upset and they feel like Donald Trump is delegitimizing these agencies by daring to question the information that they're bringing him, by daring to say, you know what, bring me some proof, let's wait a little bit, let's not just, you know,
[03:13:07.406 --> 03:13:09.127]  Put troops on the ground there in Russia.
[03:13:09.167 --> 03:13:11.950]  Let's see what's actually going to come from this briefing.
[03:13:12.530 --> 03:13:15.312]  And as we see, it really still wasn't that much.
[03:13:15.372 --> 03:13:18.535]  They basically took to social media and RT.
[03:13:18.595 --> 03:13:23.178]  That was the evidence that they offered up of this Russian interference with the election.
[03:13:24.437 --> 03:13:49.074]  So I want to play this clip of Chuck Schumer, and I think you'll hear it in his voice, but if you can see it, if you're watching this at InfoWars.com forward slash show, to even look at the look on his face, to just the creepiness that is oozing out of this man, and then ask yourself, would you trust these groups that they're saying, give them your undivided loyalty?
[03:13:50.476 --> 03:13:55.661]  But he's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[03:13:55.681 --> 03:14:00.726]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[03:14:01.287 --> 03:14:06.773]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[03:14:06.953 --> 03:14:09.675]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated?
[03:14:09.695 --> 03:14:09.996]  I don't know.
[03:14:11.744 --> 03:14:12.124]  Wow.
[03:14:12.825 --> 03:14:15.148]  I mean, what a creepy, creepy man.
[03:14:15.208 --> 03:14:18.871]  And then for him to just say this, they got, you take on the intelligence community.
[03:14:18.911 --> 03:14:21.714]  They got six ways to Sunday to take care of you.
[03:14:22.235 --> 03:14:22.695]  Hello.
[03:14:23.296 --> 03:14:25.698]  So are we talking a JFK scenario here?
[03:14:25.759 --> 03:14:31.464]  Because as you recall, JFK famously said that he wanted to shatter the CIA into a million pieces.
[03:14:33.126 --> 03:14:41.872]  You know, so that was the energy that I got from that little comment he gave to Rachel Maddow, to Mr. Maddow on their show.
[03:14:43.653 --> 03:14:47.676]  Frankly, what the heck do you have up your sleeve if Donald Trump is going to question what you've got?
[03:14:47.696 --> 03:14:49.277]  It is a coup.
[03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:54.340]  We have here these two branches of the government, basically, that are going to be fighting with each other.
[03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:59.283]  And so it's basically you take us at our word and we're going to go to war with Russia.
[03:14:59.904 --> 03:15:02.746]  Obama's already, you know, assembling troops around the border.
[03:15:03.906 --> 03:15:05.046]  And Donald Trump is saying no.
[03:15:05.307 --> 03:15:07.647]  Why can't we have better relations with Russia?
[03:15:07.727 --> 03:15:08.627]  I don't understand.
[03:15:08.747 --> 03:15:22.930]  So that's going to be also some major pushback that we're going to have to have our eyes out for because people are already saying once Trump gets in he's going to find out how little friendliness we do share with Russia.
[03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:27.591]  So that'll be very interesting to see if Donald Trump indeed does change his stance on that.
[03:15:27.672 --> 03:15:29.132]  Now another thing that we've got
[03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:38.544]  Um, people saying that Donald Trump, Harry Reid famously just there said that he messed up our foreign relations with some other nations already.
[03:15:38.605 --> 03:15:40.708]  Of course, he was speaking about Mexico and China.
[03:15:42.025 --> 03:15:49.647]  We have the Chinese state tabloid warning Trump, if he ends the one China policy, China will take revenge.
[03:15:50.288 --> 03:15:57.270]  So of course, this one China policy, there's basically disagreement about who is the legitimate government.
[03:15:57.670 --> 03:16:04.252]  China says there's only one People's Republic of China, and that's versus the Republic of China and Taiwan.
[03:16:04.292 --> 03:16:07.873]  Beijing considers a self-governing Taiwan a renegade province.
[03:16:08.493 --> 03:16:10.454]  Ineligible for state-to-state relations.
[03:16:10.894 --> 03:16:12.694]  So it's a very sensitive subject for China.
[03:16:12.774 --> 03:16:18.796]  And so the order has always just been, you deal with China, you don't deal with Taiwan.
[03:16:18.837 --> 03:16:25.719]  So of course, when he took, Donald Trump took that phone call there, that just kind of ruffled the feathers of China.
[03:16:25.779 --> 03:16:31.661]  So they said, you know what, if you try to go against what's been the standing order, we are going to take revenge.
[03:16:32.935 --> 03:16:35.378]  Well, and Donald Trump, of course, didn't stand down to that.
[03:16:35.438 --> 03:16:36.198]  He said, you know what?
[03:16:36.959 --> 03:16:39.102]  The deal's bad and we're going to renegotiate.
[03:16:39.962 --> 03:16:41.684]  It's not a good deal for the U.S.
[03:16:42.085 --> 03:16:47.450]  Well, now we've got Alibaba's Jack Ma saying that he wants job creation.
[03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:49.432]  It's going to focus on small businesses.
[03:16:49.953 --> 03:16:53.096]  He had a great meeting with President-elect Donald Trump.
[03:16:53.977 --> 03:16:56.178]  So this is Alibaba's executive chairman.
[03:16:57.618 --> 03:17:00.239]  Of course, that's kind of like the Amazon there for China.
[03:17:00.739 --> 03:17:06.381]  And he wants to create a million-plus new jobs over the next five years, U.S.
[03:17:06.421 --> 03:17:06.822]  jobs.
[03:17:06.962 --> 03:17:14.084]  So he says this is Alibaba's expansion, would focus on products like garments, wine, and fruits, especially in the Midwest.
[03:17:14.524 --> 03:17:18.466]  So here we kind of have a little competition with Amazon, with Alibaba.
[03:17:19.366 --> 03:17:20.026]  You know, that's good.
[03:17:20.086 --> 03:17:21.387]  A little competition is good.
[03:17:21.407 --> 03:17:29.451]  It doesn't allow monopoly and it doesn't allow people to come in and decide, you know, buy off the government with their lobbyists.
[03:17:30.952 --> 03:17:34.194]  And here, Donald Trump putting his foot down and saying, look,
[03:17:35.154 --> 03:17:36.476]  I don't serve China.
[03:17:36.596 --> 03:17:41.143]  I'm not going to bow down to the President of China or the King of Saudi Arabia.
[03:17:41.303 --> 03:17:45.570]  I am serving the American people and I want to do what's in the best interest of America.
[03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:50.597]  So I'm not going to stand down and bow to you as you refuse to give me a
[03:17:52.396 --> 03:17:58.838]  A plane, the proper deboarding of my presidential plane because you disrespect me so much like they did with Obama.
[03:17:59.078 --> 03:17:59.678]  He's saying no.
[03:18:00.158 --> 03:18:02.278]  I serve the American interest.
[03:18:02.358 --> 03:18:06.740]  And so here we have Jack Ma, who's very powerful, saying, you know what?
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:08.280]  I'm going to work with the president.
[03:18:08.740 --> 03:18:10.500]  So I think that's very exciting.
[03:18:11.781 --> 03:18:12.981]  Some very exciting news.
[03:18:13.101 --> 03:18:17.282]  And now we'll move on to this call
[03:18:19.241 --> 03:18:19.641]  We're good to go.
[03:18:35.538 --> 03:18:35.818]  I don't
[03:18:52.096 --> 03:18:57.442]  That he wants people to get up off their butt and to join this protest.
[03:18:57.742 --> 03:18:59.564]  That he wants them to be there en masse.
[03:18:59.584 --> 03:19:07.954]  He says Donald Trump is so narcissistic that he's going to be really, really offended if there's a lot of people there who don't like him.
[03:19:08.034 --> 03:19:10.217]  So that's the effect he really wants to make.
[03:19:11.401 --> 03:19:20.487]  But he's calling for protests and resistance actions to be staged throughout the first 100 days of Trump's presidency.
[03:19:20.887 --> 03:19:34.235]  So this is also in alignment with what we have, these George Soros groups, who are also calling for continued protests, just non-stop, of course, in all of these cities that were in support of Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:34.255 --> 03:19:36.277]  So you're going to see it on the East and West Coast.
[03:19:37.177 --> 03:19:37.959]  I don't know.
[03:19:52.841 --> 03:19:56.243]  Donald Trump's gonna be your president, and let's give him a chance.
[03:19:56.343 --> 03:19:57.484]  It's time to move on.
[03:19:57.824 --> 03:20:04.649]  Time to put the Obama presidency in the past, where it belongs, and move on to bigger and better things.
[03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.570]  Stick around.
[03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:08.252]  Coming up, we're gonna talk about the new New World Order.
[03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:20.176]  I've been around the reporting game for over 30 years, so I've known lots of reporters.
[03:20:21.497 --> 03:20:26.083]  Lots of reporters, some editors, people who work in the mainstream.
[03:20:27.284 --> 03:20:28.065]  What are they doing?
[03:20:28.125 --> 03:20:29.407]  What's their psychology?
[03:20:30.487 --> 03:20:33.288]  First of all, their talent's spotted.
[03:20:33.968 --> 03:20:35.048]  You understand what that means?
[03:20:35.709 --> 03:20:40.350]  Somebody picks him out and says, this kid is fairly smart, he's kind of bright, let's bring him in, it could be good.
[03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:44.571]  And he believes what we want our people to believe.
[03:20:45.572 --> 03:20:45.972]  Already.
[03:20:46.852 --> 03:20:48.313]  He believes in globalism.
[03:20:48.393 --> 03:20:53.076]  He believes that we're all one happy, sappy, global village.
[03:20:53.176 --> 03:20:58.840]  He believes that parents should be taking care of their own kids if the state wants to intervene.
[03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:04.544]  He believes that communities should be planned by the United Nations if necessary.
[03:21:05.004 --> 03:21:08.346]  People live in little, tiny little spaces and so forth.
[03:21:08.847 --> 03:21:12.489]  Kick people who are living out in so that migrants can live there.
[03:21:12.529 --> 03:21:16.132]  You know, he's already on board, alright?
[03:21:17.252 --> 03:21:18.953]  This is key and crucial.
[03:21:19.514 --> 03:21:20.775]  They bring these people in.
[03:21:21.315 --> 03:21:22.816]  They can smell them a mile away.
[03:21:22.916 --> 03:21:23.476]  So can you.
[03:21:23.536 --> 03:21:24.797]  So can I. So can they.
[03:21:26.418 --> 03:21:27.539]  Guy walks through the door.
[03:21:27.619 --> 03:21:28.660]  He's 24 years old.
[03:21:29.140 --> 03:21:33.483]  He's got a master's degree from, you know, jerk university.
[03:21:34.283 --> 03:21:35.664]  And oh, yes, very good.
[03:21:35.724 --> 03:21:42.549]  He sits down and right away the editor who's interviewing him or the personnel guy at the New York Times or wherever it is.
[03:21:44.928 --> 03:21:53.797]  Yep, I can smell this guy is a liberal, which means he's really a globalist, and he's a communist, and he's a socialist, and he doesn't even have to know what that means.
[03:21:54.618 --> 03:21:55.499]  You know, the reporter.
[03:21:56.420 --> 03:21:59.363]  He just thinks he does, so that's what we want.
[03:21:59.784 --> 03:22:04.729]  And then he can write articles from the angle that we want him to write articles from, and that's how the game works.
[03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:06.930]  That's really what it is.
[03:22:07.711 --> 03:22:09.472]  They smell the same smell.
[03:22:09.572 --> 03:22:11.412]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[03:22:11.853 --> 03:22:12.933]  Oh yeah, he's one of us.
[03:22:13.613 --> 03:22:14.714]  Sure, he talks like us.
[03:22:14.814 --> 03:22:15.995]  I can tell he thinks like us.
[03:22:16.055 --> 03:22:17.115]  He acts like us.
[03:22:17.135 --> 03:22:18.336]  His attitude is like us.
[03:22:19.976 --> 03:22:26.099]  It's kind of like, uh, semi-high IQ mucus.
[03:22:26.719 --> 03:22:26.999]  Okay?
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:29.521]  That's what I think of it as.
[03:22:30.061 --> 03:22:33.722]  Oh yes, I'm spotting in Jones, our newest candidate for reporter.
[03:22:36.292 --> 03:22:38.333]  A semi-high IQ mucus.
[03:22:39.194 --> 03:22:40.194]  Yes, very good.
[03:22:40.254 --> 03:22:41.635]  Yes, I think he'll be fine.
[03:22:41.715 --> 03:22:42.776]  He'll be fine.
[03:22:42.956 --> 03:22:43.436]  One of us.
[03:22:46.458 --> 03:22:48.719]  And they are going all in.
[03:22:50.680 --> 03:22:57.003]  Risking everything, major media I'm talking about, with the most fantastical stories.
[03:22:58.217 --> 03:23:00.279]  You know, they're just ridiculous.
[03:23:01.219 --> 03:23:06.263]  The Russians and the Putin and this and that and all the fake news sites are really working for who?
[03:23:06.503 --> 03:23:06.823]  Russia?
[03:23:06.883 --> 03:23:07.244]  What?
[03:23:07.464 --> 03:23:10.406]  You know, they are going crazy.
[03:23:10.626 --> 03:23:12.548]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[03:23:13.448 --> 03:23:13.969]  Far worse.
[03:23:14.189 --> 03:23:15.870]  Minor words and his was action.
[03:23:16.471 --> 03:23:17.992]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:23:18.032 --> 03:23:23.717]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:23:23.937 --> 03:23:26.239]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[03:23:26.599 --> 03:23:31.523]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[03:23:31.603 --> 03:23:32.784]  Four of them here tonight.
[03:23:32.904 --> 03:23:38.228]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[03:23:49.042 --> 03:23:51.785]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[03:23:52.646 --> 03:23:54.107]  It's a fight for our minds.
[03:23:54.768 --> 03:23:56.710]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[03:23:57.030 --> 03:24:01.234]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:24:01.375 --> 03:24:04.738]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[03:24:04.818 --> 03:24:06.360]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:24:27.831 --> 03:24:29.592]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:29.712 --> 03:24:33.253]  I am Leanne McAdoo with you for the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:33.873 --> 03:24:36.054]  And everyone is elated.
[03:24:36.074 --> 03:24:38.675]  2017, New Year, New Me.
[03:24:38.695 --> 03:24:41.116]  2016 was such a great year for all of us.
[03:24:41.216 --> 03:24:42.757]  We actually were able to...
[03:24:43.417 --> 03:24:45.278]  Fight against this globalist takeover.
[03:24:45.398 --> 03:24:52.782]  A lot of people woke up around the globe and were able to fight back against the establishment and their New World Order agenda.
[03:24:53.142 --> 03:24:57.565]  But as we have shown you, they are not going to take this sitting down.
[03:24:57.585 --> 03:25:02.027]  You know, you can throw the stone at Goliath, but you've got to take off his head.
[03:25:02.487 --> 03:25:08.311]  So this is why Alex has introduced the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[03:25:09.051 --> 03:25:09.872]  We've got to get out there.
[03:25:09.892 --> 03:25:12.914]  If they're going to be protesting, we've got to get out there and protest as well.
[03:25:12.954 --> 03:25:14.335]  So we need our energy.
[03:25:14.756 --> 03:25:19.760]  We need to be strong and healthy and resolute in our bodies as well as our minds.
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:25.244]  So that's why we want you to join the InfoWars Life Store.
[03:25:25.284 --> 03:25:29.287]  Go ahead and visit there to get the Liberty Pack.
[03:25:29.948 --> 03:25:32.750]  This is our 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[03:25:33.170 --> 03:25:37.894]  Every liberty lover needs to join this intellectual fight against the globalists.
[03:25:39.804 --> 03:25:45.968]  Against all the toxic garbage that they're feeding us, not only with the television, the food, the water, the air, we're constantly under attack.
[03:25:46.549 --> 03:25:51.112]  Every single level of our bodies is making us fat, sick, and dumbed down.
[03:25:51.192 --> 03:25:54.714]  So all you Liberty lovers need to go to the InfoWars store right now.
[03:25:54.754 --> 03:26:02.239]  We've got 30% off of Brain Force, 30% off Supermail Vitality, Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[03:26:02.259 --> 03:26:05.381]  We've got a lot of things bundled for you as well.
[03:26:06.481 --> 03:26:11.886]  So go ahead, take back your health, make your body great again in 2017 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:26:12.006 --> 03:26:14.268]  We have a lot of great specials going on for you.
[03:26:14.288 --> 03:26:34.365]  These are life-changing formulations, and I know I've already kind of started before 2017 began because I wanted to save my New Year's resolutions for something else, and we know we are really going to have to be fighting back against this globalist agenda that's out there, like the season of civil disobedience.
[03:26:34.706 --> 03:26:37.536]  That Al Sharpton is now promising everyone.
[03:26:38.854 --> 03:26:47.020]  This is going to be the season of civil disobedience in response to Jeff Sessions' nomination for Attorney General in the Trump administration.
[03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:50.762]  So this is the great race baiter Al Sharpton.
[03:26:50.842 --> 03:26:52.443]  He's an MSNBC host.
[03:26:53.204 --> 03:27:00.749]  He says that activists have planned a march in Washington on January 14th, of course, during the Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:27:00.769 --> 03:27:01.529]  holiday weekend.
[03:27:01.549 --> 03:27:04.291]  They're going to be protesting Jeff Sessions' nomination.
[03:27:05.692 --> 03:27:18.641]  So again, just with all the race baiting, the revision, the reworking of history to cherry pick events to help fit this narrative that's going to further divide people during the inauguration week.
[03:27:18.701 --> 03:27:20.342]  It's going to be a huge week there.
[03:27:20.982 --> 03:27:32.030]  And Michael Moore is also calling for massive amounts of people to attend the women's march on Washington to protest Donald Trump's inauguration.
[03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:35.452]  They're expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be in
[03:27:36.112 --> 03:27:47.296]  So we need all of you liberty lovers out there as well, anyone who can get to DC and just fight back against this agenda that's being there and show up for Donald Trump.
[03:27:47.416 --> 03:27:51.717]  Show up for those of us who were able to push back against this globalist agenda.
[03:27:51.757 --> 03:27:53.317]  And it's not about fighting with people.
[03:27:53.658 --> 03:27:57.359]  It's not about saying, oh, you lost, you're a loser, we're the winners, get over it.
[03:27:57.839 --> 03:28:04.181]  It's about engaging in dialogue and showing them some facts when they say that Donald Trump was
[03:28:04.961 --> 03:28:09.024]  Making fun of a mentally disabled person.
[03:28:10.264 --> 03:28:20.150]  Show them some video clips where, no, this is actually just a, you know, a gesture that he always uses when he wants to reference someone who's just flustered and can't come up with a very good argument.
[03:28:20.571 --> 03:28:21.451]  Show them videos.
[03:28:21.631 --> 03:28:22.672]  Show them articles.
[03:28:22.892 --> 03:28:30.357]  Have a calm dialogue with people who truly think that this 2016, the election, was the end of their world.
[03:28:32.498 --> 03:28:34.040]  No, it's just, it is.
[03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:35.121]  It is, frankly.
[03:28:35.161 --> 03:28:40.506]  It's the end of that old paradigm and it is time for the new paradigm to move in.
[03:28:40.566 --> 03:28:43.449]  We are going to hold Donald Trump to his word.
[03:28:43.529 --> 03:28:44.550]  We are going to check him.
[03:28:44.590 --> 03:28:46.172]  We're going to do our job at InfoWars.
[03:28:46.192 --> 03:28:49.075]  We're not just going to eat up everything he says and just believe that he's
[03:28:49.295 --> 03:28:49.555]  I think so.
[03:29:13.189 --> 03:29:16.153]  Self-congratulatory party where they're all saying, no, you're the best.
[03:29:16.234 --> 03:29:17.055]  No, you're the best.
[03:29:18.036 --> 03:29:29.152]  Fight back against them pushing this, the lies and causing, causing people to actually cry, thinking that it's the end of the world because Donald Trump has become the president.
[03:29:29.893 --> 03:29:38.175]  It's really important that everybody gets out there, shows up, gets up off your butt, attends the inauguration if you have the ability to do that.
[03:29:38.275 --> 03:29:43.317]  But throughout the rest of the year, get up off your butt and put out some truth.
[03:29:43.537 --> 03:29:46.718]  Make the videos like Alex is always saying.
[03:29:47.158 --> 03:29:50.058]  Do your part to fight back and put some truth out there.
[03:29:50.099 --> 03:29:51.819]  Do your part in the info war.
[03:29:51.839 --> 03:29:52.299]  Stick around.
[03:29:52.359 --> 03:29:55.300]  Owen Schroyer is going to be joining me in studio coming up next.
[03:29:59.651 --> 03:30:02.634]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.575 --> 03:30:06.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.700 --> 03:30:21.144]  The fundraising campaign is underway for that Chicago victim kidnapped by four thugs, forced to drink from the toilet while his hair was cut bald and his clothes and he was taunted with Trump taunts.
[03:30:21.344 --> 03:30:27.886]  An online fundraising campaign for the family of the Chicago victim has pulled in eight times the amount it was intended to raise.
[03:30:27.906 --> 03:30:33.608]  A GoFundMe campaign that started on January the 5th had an intent of raising $10,000 for the victim and his family.
[03:30:33.928 --> 03:30:41.052]  For those of you that have not seen the horrific torture and trauma recently inflicted on a young man in Chicago, it is not something you will soon forget soon.
[03:31:00.742 --> 03:31:03.905]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:31:04.005 --> 03:31:05.286]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:31:19.813 --> 03:31:21.673]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:31:22.294 --> 03:31:27.855]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:31:28.455 --> 03:31:36.437]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:31:36.857 --> 03:31:38.918]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:31:39.198 --> 03:31:40.398]  This is the best system out there.
[03:31:40.658 --> 03:31:43.419]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:31:43.679 --> 03:31:44.419]  This is how it works.
[03:31:44.719 --> 03:31:45.240]  You order.
[03:31:45.360 --> 03:31:46.140]  Customized or
[03:31:47.245 --> 03:31:48.707]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:31:49.207 --> 03:31:52.350]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:31:52.651 --> 03:31:56.715]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:31:56.915 --> 03:31:57.696]  You cannot lose.
[03:31:57.736 --> 03:31:58.837]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:31:59.137 --> 03:32:05.864]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:32:06.225 --> 03:32:10.169]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:32:10.649 --> 03:32:11.129]  Not a group.
[03:32:11.169 --> 03:32:12.570]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:32:12.611 --> 03:32:13.691]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:32:13.951 --> 03:32:14.872]  Why is this so good?
[03:32:15.172 --> 03:32:20.396]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:32:20.476 --> 03:32:34.046]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:32:34.106 --> 03:32:35.487]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:32:36.247 --> 03:32:37.849]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:32:37.889 --> 03:32:40.392]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:32:40.492 --> 03:32:41.753]  These are all parasites.
[03:32:41.793 --> 03:32:42.895]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:32:42.915 --> 03:32:43.976]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:32:44.256 --> 03:32:48.581]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:32:48.801 --> 03:32:51.965]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:32:52.005 --> 03:32:55.087]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:32:55.107 --> 03:32:56.148]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:32:56.208 --> 03:32:58.089]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:58.149 --> 03:32:59.169]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:32:59.189 --> 03:33:01.251]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:33:01.891 --> 03:33:04.913]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:05.173 --> 03:33:07.054]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:33:07.435 --> 03:33:09.396]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:33:19.970 --> 03:33:21.571]  You want answers?
[03:33:21.611 --> 03:33:23.871]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:23.991 --> 03:33:28.933]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.433 --> 03:33:33.374]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.514 --> 03:33:37.515]  I'm your host for this hour, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, joined by Owen Schroyer.
[03:33:38.015 --> 03:33:47.618]  And we are going to use this long segment to talk about the new New World Order and just point out all the pushback
[03:33:48.018 --> 03:33:52.500]  From the people who thought that they were going to be part of the real new world.
[03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:57.722]  We've been working on this plan for so long, at least a hundred years, and now it's been foiled.
[03:33:57.742 --> 03:34:00.783]  We would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you pesky kids.
[03:34:00.863 --> 03:34:02.024]  You pesky conservatives.
[03:34:02.564 --> 03:34:04.064]  So now we've got the... Bitter clingers.
[03:34:04.665 --> 03:34:05.265]  Deplorables.
[03:34:06.121 --> 03:34:11.346]  We've got the Party of Davos waking up to the new New World Order.
[03:34:11.406 --> 03:34:13.328]  This is coming out of CNBC.
[03:34:14.208 --> 03:34:27.220]  So of course we know next week all your influential business leaders, lawmakers, Silicon Valley, all of the who's who and the what's the what is going to be descending on the Swiss Alpine Resort of Davos next week.
[03:34:27.961 --> 03:34:36.407]  That's where they're going to get together, pat each other on the back and talk about all of their ways that they're going to create this new world order and global society.
[03:34:36.847 --> 03:34:40.870]  But this is going against the backdrop of a rising populism.
[03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:45.192]  And that's not just here in America, but we see with Brexit as well.
[03:34:45.272 --> 03:34:54.799]  Germany is trying to stop anything like that from happening there by just eliminating anything that they see as dissenting opinion or against the establishment.
[03:34:55.439 --> 03:35:10.128]  There's actually challenging Facebook saying we're going to fine you $500,000 if you don't take down what we deem to be fake news before their election because they don't want it to get out of hand and take take down their establishment candidate.
[03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:19.113]  So it's just very interesting that you have people like this Silicon Valley CEO
[03:35:20.239 --> 03:35:27.859]  It's a tech CEO suggesting that jobs are disappearing from middle America because educated people don't want to live in a...
[03:35:29.835 --> 03:35:33.817]  Asshole with misogynistic, racist, stupid and violent people.
[03:35:33.877 --> 03:35:35.078]  This is Melinda Byerly.
[03:35:35.118 --> 03:35:39.960]  She's the founder of a Silicon Valley based startup company, Timeshare CMO.
[03:35:40.260 --> 03:35:41.761]  So this is a Facebook posting.
[03:35:42.161 --> 03:35:43.682]  This is how out of touch they are.
[03:35:43.962 --> 03:35:52.927]  This is how they think that they're going to talk to, quote unquote, middle America, people who voted for Donald Trump by calling them misogynistic, racist, stupid, violent people.
[03:35:53.307 --> 03:35:56.769]  And if you want us to bring jobs to your communities, then you have to
[03:35:57.449 --> 03:35:58.730]  Stop being that way.
[03:35:58.811 --> 03:36:08.921]  They think people are violent, racist, misogynistic, and corporations aren't going to bring their jobs there because the people who run the call centers and what have you, they don't want to be next to you people.
[03:36:12.745 --> 03:36:22.791]  Meanwhile, they're the ones that are actually going out, being violent, being racist, kidnapping people, torturing them, and, you know, telling f-white people, f-Trump.
[03:36:23.571 --> 03:36:31.856]  So it's a complete WALL-E world, complete upside-down land that we're living in, and they still have not woken up to the fact that Donald Trump
[03:36:32.978 --> 03:36:35.220]  He's going to be their president, whether they like it or not.
[03:36:35.640 --> 03:36:39.283]  Well, this is part of the Trump effect, and these people are showing their true colors.
[03:36:39.423 --> 03:36:41.605]  People like Patton Oswalt going on Twitter.
[03:36:42.606 --> 03:36:51.253]  You know, you're either a total shill, but there's also some people that I've learned during this whole Trump cycle that they really will just shill for anybody.
[03:36:51.693 --> 03:36:53.294]  They'll just totally shill for Trump.
[03:36:53.394 --> 03:36:55.655]  They'll shill for whoever is the popular one.
[03:36:55.695 --> 03:36:56.596]  They'll shill for anybody.
[03:36:56.636 --> 03:37:05.801]  So you're seeing the people who are kind of diehard liberals, the hearsay mafia, and then the people that will just sell out to anybody, whether it be Donald Trump, Barack Obama, or anybody.
[03:37:06.261 --> 03:37:10.604]  But you talk about the Davos get-together, which I think is coming up here pretty soon.
[03:37:10.624 --> 03:37:10.944]  Right.
[03:37:11.064 --> 03:37:13.786]  You know, a lot of these people, they just want to make money.
[03:37:14.526 --> 03:37:21.268]  And the new status quo with Donald Trump, I don't think is going to deter them necessarily from making money.
[03:37:21.448 --> 03:37:23.728]  It might present them new opportunities to make money.
[03:37:24.068 --> 03:37:30.770]  They might not be able to do it on the global platform in which they had wished to, that we know they've been trying to set up.
[03:37:30.810 --> 03:37:34.231]  But for a lot of these people, my guess is they still want to work with Trump.
[03:37:34.611 --> 03:37:39.532]  They don't see this as an end to their business models of making mass profit.
[03:37:40.072 --> 03:37:43.335]  So I would imagine that they'll eventually start to come around with this.
[03:37:43.375 --> 03:37:48.539]  We're already seeing the stock market have major booms, records almost daily.
[03:37:48.559 --> 03:37:52.882]  So these major economic financial people, I think, are going to start to come around for Trump.
[03:37:53.162 --> 03:37:55.424]  But again, they're not the liberals that are digging their heels in.
[03:37:55.444 --> 03:37:59.527]  They're not the sore losers that are embarrassing themselves on social media every day.
[03:38:00.188 --> 03:38:03.250]  There were a couple of them today on C-SPAN that were really quite embarrassing.
[03:38:03.811 --> 03:38:07.834]  I don't know if you wanted to talk about them, but like I said, people are showing their true colors now.
[03:38:08.263 --> 03:38:18.798]  Right, and that's the thing is that people have kind of woken up to just the fact that there have been some negative impacts on this globalization and they're saying, wait a minute, we need to kind of pump the brakes a little bit.
[03:38:18.838 --> 03:38:24.486]  We don't even have a plan for what we're going to do, how we're going to employ people in the future with all this automation.
[03:38:25.347 --> 03:38:38.833]  So people are kind of pushing back against this because they've been selling us how wonderful it's going to be, this globalization is very glamorous, but really it's only a very select few who are benefiting from it.
[03:38:38.993 --> 03:38:41.475]  And so people are pushing back against
[03:38:42.415 --> 03:38:47.277]  What they see is these banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders, the Hollywood elite.
[03:38:47.377 --> 03:38:50.758]  They're the ones that are really benefiting from this system.
[03:38:50.818 --> 03:38:53.639]  Well, it's a total rejection of reality, is what it is.
[03:38:53.919 --> 03:38:55.620]  And it's the most amazing thing.
[03:38:56.220 --> 03:38:58.941]  You know, all this talk about the Obama legacy, okay?
[03:38:59.001 --> 03:39:01.302]  And I've been talking about the Obama legacy.
[03:39:01.342 --> 03:39:02.882]  What is the true Obama legacy?
[03:39:03.342 --> 03:39:05.223]  You know what the real Obama legacy is?
[03:39:05.803 --> 03:39:06.563]  Donald Trump!
[03:39:07.184 --> 03:39:08.844]  We elected Donald Trump!
[03:39:09.124 --> 03:39:10.925]  That's Barack Obama's legacy!
[03:39:11.465 --> 03:39:13.908]  So, you know, we can sit here and we can try to hype it up.
[03:39:13.948 --> 03:39:19.015]  You know, people want to do battle over the stats, the job numbers, economic.
[03:39:19.075 --> 03:39:19.556]  Is it better?
[03:39:19.596 --> 03:39:20.076]  Is it worse?
[03:39:20.116 --> 03:39:21.037]  This, that, or the other thing.
[03:39:21.458 --> 03:39:21.959]  Okay, but you know what?
[03:39:21.999 --> 03:39:23.300]  What is the real Obama legacy?
[03:39:23.380 --> 03:39:24.322]  It's Donald Trump.
[03:39:24.382 --> 03:39:25.503]  We elected Donald Trump.
[03:39:25.804 --> 03:39:28.247]  Barack Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton, okay?
[03:39:29.088 --> 03:39:36.040]  Part of the campaign of Hillary Clinton was to continue the quote-unquote progress that we've made in the last eight years.
[03:39:36.621 --> 03:39:39.687]  And all of these liberals continue to praise this progress today.
[03:39:39.707 --> 03:39:41.290]  This is what I was talking about today.
[03:39:42.369 --> 03:39:50.593]  If you really want to know what is wrong with people on this level, Leanne, I would suggest you go and watch this segment that was on C-SPAN today.
[03:39:51.253 --> 03:39:58.057]  Tamika Edwards introduced Randy Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers.
[03:39:58.077 --> 03:40:00.938]  You can go on C-SPAN.com and you can watch this thing in its entirety.
[03:40:00.958 --> 03:40:03.720]  It's about 40 minutes long, but basically
[03:40:04.680 --> 03:40:07.902]  They're talking about the federalization of education, okay?
[03:40:07.962 --> 03:40:22.411]  And I would say, based on what we've seen here lately, specifically with protesters and even more specifically with the torture of a young disabled person in Chicago, that Democratic-run education is failing.
[03:40:22.851 --> 03:40:23.051]  Right?
[03:40:23.071 --> 03:40:28.896]  2 plus 2 only equals 5 until the person you told it equaled 5 to actually finds out it equals 4.
[03:40:29.877 --> 03:40:38.665]  So, okay, so you've got failed education, but you've got these liberals today that are talking about how the education program needs more federal funding.
[03:40:39.165 --> 03:40:44.790]  And Tamika Edwards talks about how it was so great going to public school and learning from Randy Weingarten.
[03:40:45.051 --> 03:41:00.706]  She talks about an experience she had, and I think, I don't know how this is ethical, how this was able to go down, but I guess in a New York City public school, she took her class, this is a high school class, and they campaigned for a local city councilwoman who won.
[03:41:01.266 --> 03:41:09.868]  So that's public money that's your student being indoctrinated into a campaign via the professor.
[03:41:10.549 --> 03:41:12.069]  Now, again, I'm confused.
[03:41:12.209 --> 03:41:13.249]  I'm hearing her talk about this.
[03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:14.290]  She's bragging about this.
[03:41:14.390 --> 03:41:16.250]  And that and that woman ended up winning.
[03:41:16.310 --> 03:41:17.170]  Of course, it was a woman.
[03:41:17.190 --> 03:41:19.191]  You know, this is the typical.
[03:41:19.411 --> 03:41:35.392]  Well, I mean, it's just typical what you're seeing with these videos in college campuses where these teachers are basically creating their own little proxy army of future communists to go out and vote for Donald Trump and pump their own political ideology in the heads of these kids.
[03:41:35.412 --> 03:41:37.295]  It's not about learning about what's out there.
[03:41:37.415 --> 03:41:41.077]  I'm telling you, watching this segment opened my eyes so much.
[03:41:42.378 --> 03:41:44.680]  People always say, oh, it's the liberal education.
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:47.001]  We need to look at the universities, how they've been liberalized.
[03:41:47.021 --> 03:41:48.683]  And of course, we hear that.
[03:41:48.703 --> 03:41:49.823]  That's part of the hearsay thing.
[03:41:49.843 --> 03:41:50.784]  It's like, OK, it makes sense.
[03:41:51.284 --> 03:41:52.285]  You watch this segment.
[03:41:52.345 --> 03:41:53.226]  It explains all of it.
[03:41:53.306 --> 03:41:54.206]  You just nailed on the head.
[03:41:54.767 --> 03:41:58.709]  This Randi Weingarten, OK, look, she's probably a nice lady.
[03:41:58.809 --> 03:41:59.149]  All right.
[03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.590]  You know what?
[03:41:59.630 --> 03:42:00.010]  You're nice.
[03:42:00.050 --> 03:42:01.451]  You care about the kids, I'm sure.
[03:42:01.751 --> 03:42:03.112]  But you just nailed on the head, Leanne.
[03:42:03.512 --> 03:42:06.815]  She is more concerned about, let's say she has a classroom of 30 people.
[03:42:07.815 --> 03:42:16.124]  She is more concerned about sending those 30 people into the world as social justice warrior, virtue signaling, you know, that's all she's worried about.
[03:42:16.224 --> 03:42:25.674]  Not teaching them about the tax system, not teaching them about history, the history of different political policies, the history of socialism, communism, you know, all of this stuff.
[03:42:26.034 --> 03:42:26.495]  No, no, no.
[03:42:26.795 --> 03:42:30.158]  She just wants to send social justice warriors out into the world.
[03:42:30.438 --> 03:42:43.309]  And it was so clear to me when her former student, Tamika Edwards, introduced her, the stories she told, and then the speech that Randy Weingarten made, the president of, she wants to whine all day, the president of American Federation of Teachers.
[03:42:43.609 --> 03:42:52.756]  And by the way, the whole time moaning and complaining about Donald Trump's nominee to the head of the education, Davos, I think is how you pronounce her name.
[03:42:52.977 --> 03:42:54.037]  I might be pronouncing that wrong.
[03:42:54.898 --> 03:42:55.999]  But, and complaining about Trump.
[03:42:56.019 --> 03:43:05.784]  They just politicize the whole thing, and then they do the typical thing, oh, it's been so great over the last eight years, and then five seconds later, everything is so bad, we need to make it better, more federal, federal.
[03:43:05.804 --> 03:43:07.565]  It's like, wait, what is he?
[03:43:07.786 --> 03:43:09.687]  I thought you said America was already great.
[03:43:09.787 --> 03:43:11.828]  So they're just so confused with their own arguments.
[03:43:11.988 --> 03:43:13.108]  They don't live in reality.
[03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:20.612]  We've got college progressives at the University of Wisconsin-Madison trying to label conservative students as a hate group.
[03:43:21.132 --> 03:43:25.594]  So if you are conservative students, these are the Young Americans for Freedom.
[03:43:26.014 --> 03:43:29.095]  They say, denounce Young Americans for Freedom and the alt-right.
[03:43:29.115 --> 03:43:36.299]  So they're just lumping everyone in with this alt-right movement that everyone gets lumped in with these super-altered neo-Nazi racists.
[03:43:37.159 --> 03:43:37.539]  I don't
[03:43:55.742 --> 03:43:56.322]  I don't know.
[03:44:20.787 --> 03:44:29.854]  So you might not have heard about this, but there was a radical queer activist arrested for murder at the University of California, Berkeley.
[03:44:29.914 --> 03:44:35.619]  He's suspected of stabbing one woman to death on Friday and of injuring another in a separate incident.
[03:44:35.779 --> 03:44:39.642]  He was arrested by police in Burbank on Saturday afternoon.
[03:44:40.662 --> 03:44:44.886]  So he's a radical queer and anti-white activist.
[03:44:45.786 --> 03:44:54.330]  And here he is, there's a picture of him sitting next to California Governor Jerry Brown and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.
[03:44:54.410 --> 03:45:05.135]  So he's, you know, this big-time activist on campus, also very anti-white, saying, you know, the only proper thing to do with white America is annihilation.
[03:45:05.595 --> 03:45:13.579]  So then he goes on this alleged murder, stabbing spree, killed one woman and stabbed another in a separate incident.
[03:45:14.079 --> 03:45:14.599]  But guess what?
[03:45:15.180 --> 03:45:25.226]  The people are more outraged that the paper reporting this dared use the wrong pronoun to describe him.
[03:45:25.446 --> 03:45:36.954]  So they demanded the paper rewrite the story about this guy going on a rampage because they referred to him as he and he prefers they.
[03:45:37.881 --> 03:45:38.981]  So they had to rewrite everything.
[03:45:39.262 --> 03:45:41.162]  Who cares if he's a murderer, if he went on a stab?
[03:45:41.462 --> 03:45:45.964]  The issue here, the key is, you need to use his preferred term, which is they.
[03:45:45.984 --> 03:45:47.865]  They committed the murder.
[03:45:48.025 --> 03:45:48.905]  So let me get this straight.
[03:45:48.945 --> 03:45:52.767]  You had an anti-white activist go on a killing spree.
[03:45:53.607 --> 03:46:00.190]  You had multiple terror attacks, but most recently the shooter in a Fort Lauderdale airport.
[03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:05.414]  You had a kidnap and torture video broadcast on Facebook.
[03:46:05.554 --> 03:46:06.295]  It was a hate crime.
[03:46:07.176 --> 03:46:12.621]  And Meryl Streep is going to get up on stage at the Golden Globes and tell you how bad Donald Trump is.
[03:46:13.662 --> 03:46:14.683]  That's the world we're living in now?
[03:46:15.219 --> 03:46:17.141]  That's Meryl Streep's world.
[03:46:17.341 --> 03:46:23.648]  She lost her mind over the fact that her girlfriend Hillary Clinton didn't win.
[03:46:24.308 --> 03:46:30.815]  The truth of the matter is that Meryl Streep... This is Meryl Streep, by the way, who pushed that whole thing that we're all from Africa.
[03:46:31.075 --> 03:46:32.156]  Well, this is Meryl Streep, by the way.
[03:46:32.176 --> 03:46:37.658]  And this whole thing, by the way, this is a totally selfish woman, is what this comes down to.
[03:46:38.199 --> 03:46:44.342]  Just the uttermost display of selfishness and ignorance was Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes, which I didn't watch.
[03:46:44.422 --> 03:46:47.143]  If it wasn't for her, apparently the whole thing would have tanked, though.
[03:46:47.203 --> 03:46:48.644]  So I guess maybe tip your hat to that.
[03:46:48.664 --> 03:46:49.785]  At least she drew him some attention.
[03:46:50.145 --> 03:46:50.725]  But you know what?
[03:46:50.805 --> 03:46:51.165]  You know what?
[03:46:51.185 --> 03:46:52.386]  I'm going to actually get this out there.
[03:46:52.426 --> 03:46:53.507]  I left this article on my desk.
[03:46:53.547 --> 03:46:53.787]  I don't know.
[03:46:53.807 --> 03:46:54.807]  You guys can find this article.
[03:46:54.827 --> 03:46:55.908]  It's written by Piers Morgan.
[03:46:56.308 --> 03:46:59.550]  Believe it or not, believe it or not, I'm going to actually
[03:47:00.650 --> 03:47:04.832]  Use Piers Morgan as an example of actually truth in media here.
[03:47:04.872 --> 03:47:08.633]  He's been doing some good as long as he's not coming after the good.
[03:47:08.793 --> 03:47:14.816]  Maybe Alex Jones convinced Piers Morgan to come on to the real InfoWar here.
[03:47:14.916 --> 03:47:23.879]  But he writes an op-ed in response to Meryl Streep and he points out the fact, I love this, he points out the fact that in 2003 Meryl Streep
[03:47:26.500 --> 03:47:39.816]  Rose to her feet in applause over a child rapist, Roman Polanski, who wasn't allowed to be at those awards because if he stepped foot on American soil, he would have been arrested.
[03:47:40.557 --> 03:47:44.481]  And it was Meryl Streep who rose in applause.
[03:47:45.438 --> 03:47:46.199]  For this rapist.
[03:48:01.775 --> 03:48:05.137]  You know, as long as people can appreciate your art, you can do what you want.
[03:48:05.177 --> 03:48:10.419]  And we're going to be talking about that on the nightly news tonight, as well, with the recent legislation in California.
[03:48:10.439 --> 03:48:14.901]  Some people say it's legalizing child prostitution, others say that's just semantics.
[03:48:15.401 --> 03:48:17.102]  We're going to talk about that tonight on the nightly news.
[03:48:17.182 --> 03:48:24.465]  But there's no doubt, you know, we've heard the stories, we've seen the allegations, charges have even been filed against some.
[03:48:25.206 --> 03:48:26.807]  But Meryl Streep, though, applauds.
[03:48:27.407 --> 03:48:27.607]  Right.
[03:48:27.967 --> 03:48:28.447]  That's nice.
[03:48:28.467 --> 03:48:29.027]  Thank you, Meryl.
[03:48:29.147 --> 03:48:31.968]  Well, that's what she was truly offended by.
[03:48:31.988 --> 03:48:32.988]  And you know what?
[03:48:33.288 --> 03:48:34.008]  I think, you know what?
[03:48:34.048 --> 03:48:35.889]  We should be thanking the people like Meryl Streep.
[03:48:35.909 --> 03:48:36.409]  You know why?
[03:48:37.009 --> 03:48:41.330]  Because if it wasn't for people like Meryl Streep, it would make our jobs so much harder.
[03:48:41.810 --> 03:48:42.831]  Thank you, Meryl Streep.
[03:48:42.931 --> 03:48:55.614]  You truly, you have truly capsulated the complete ignorance of the anti-Trump movement in one speech at the Golden Globes that nobody would have watched if it wasn't for your hatred of Donald Trump.
[03:48:55.634 --> 03:48:57.334]  So thank you so much, Meryl Streep.
[03:48:57.874 --> 03:49:09.543]  And hopefully our movement, which is a movement of reality, will continue to grow and the failures like Meryl Streep will just be washed away like the rotting husks that they are.
[03:49:09.763 --> 03:49:17.868]  Well, the thing that just was so offensive to me in her whole speech is that she's talking about someone in such a position of power
[03:49:18.809 --> 03:49:21.750]  As Donald Trump would be using it to push hate, to push this and that.
[03:49:21.810 --> 03:49:22.450]  Well, look at her.
[03:49:22.490 --> 03:49:35.035]  I mean, she's, you know, Hollywood royalty and she's using her time there at the acceptance speech platform to just push out all these lies against the incoming president.
[03:49:35.495 --> 03:49:36.315]  We're good to go.
[03:49:56.482 --> 03:49:56.702]  I don't
[03:50:13.892 --> 03:50:25.336]  Middle America that they think is completely stupid, racist, sexist, misogynist, and that we've started the apocalypse by voting in Donald Trump.
[03:50:25.656 --> 03:50:26.756]  That's how they see us.
[03:50:27.096 --> 03:50:33.839]  And so they are using their position to bully others on climate change, on the way that we're allowed to vote.
[03:50:34.039 --> 03:50:35.679]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:50:36.459 --> 03:50:41.501]  Total hypocrisy, but this is the hypocrisy of the left that we're constantly ranting about.
[03:50:41.581 --> 03:50:48.126]  Oh, and how about how she comes out and she, like, takes a jab at people watching football, or she's like, all we'll have is MMA and football.
[03:50:48.226 --> 03:50:50.448]  It's like, actually, kind of all we already have is that.
[03:50:50.808 --> 03:50:53.970]  Most people know more about football than they do about politics.
[03:50:54.291 --> 03:51:03.558]  Probably 200 million people watched football this weekend in America, Meryl Streep, so I don't know what rock you're living under, but you crawled out from that rock and made a nice speech, didn't you?
[03:51:03.738 --> 03:51:05.679]  Just thank God the people are finally waking up.
[03:51:05.719 --> 03:51:07.460]  These are not our heroes anymore.
[03:51:07.561 --> 03:51:09.082]  Meryl Streep is helping, I'm telling you.
[03:51:14.912 --> 03:51:15.773]  Well, that's what I asked.
[03:51:39.569 --> 03:51:40.930]  So what really is going on?
[03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:44.931]  See, something is going on under the scene, behind the scenes.
[03:51:44.991 --> 03:51:48.152]  Maybe something that's much more serious.
[03:51:48.833 --> 03:51:54.695]  On the surface, we can conclude that, well, what Obama is trying to do
[03:51:55.655 --> 03:52:02.342]  is to box Trump in so that he can't restore relations with Russia.
[03:52:02.522 --> 03:52:12.251]  That itself doesn't seem all that believable because Trump can rescind the sanctions in 21 days when he's inaugurated.
[03:52:13.052 --> 03:52:18.798]  And so we should perhaps consider that there is more going on than meets the eye.
[03:52:19.519 --> 03:52:23.564]  This may be preparing the ground for some kind of incident.
[03:52:23.724 --> 03:52:24.385]  I don't know.
[03:52:25.065 --> 03:52:32.173]  But if I was the Russian government, I would be thinking about putting the armed services on some kind of alert.
[03:52:33.494 --> 03:52:36.475]  I wouldn't just sit there and say, well, this is Obama being silly.
[03:52:36.815 --> 03:52:38.516]  Man, you're absolutely right.
[03:52:38.536 --> 03:52:47.979]  I mean, he's sending the troops in to surround Russia and saying, ah, don't worry, guys, we're just provoking World War III and have a happy Christmas and a great New Year.
[03:52:48.259 --> 03:52:53.481]  Disclaimer, this report is provided, as is, for informational purposes only.
[03:52:53.761 --> 03:53:00.664]  Department of Homeland Security does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within.
[03:53:00.964 --> 03:53:13.761]  When you say what this disclaimer does, it says that we really can't even verify that our description of their tools and infrastructure is correct.
[03:53:15.481 --> 03:53:24.590]  So we have no evidence that the alleged infrastructure was used for the purposes that Obama says.
[03:53:25.470 --> 03:53:35.700]  And then we have a disclaimer that the report on the nature of the infrastructure and tools cannot be warranted.
[03:53:38.482 --> 03:53:40.063]  Wow.
[03:53:40.543 --> 03:53:50.628]  Wow, and that is incredible because here we're thinking that we are going to be getting this bombshell information once they finally decide to brief the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:53:51.308 --> 03:53:58.691]  Even Donald Trump is saying, I think it's time everyone wants to move on to bigger and better things, but I'll wait and find out what they know about the Russians.
[03:53:58.771 --> 03:54:00.172]  He's even trying to be patient.
[03:54:00.452 --> 03:54:06.275]  But here you're saying they still have not provided any actual hardcore evidence.
[03:54:21.833 --> 03:54:24.114]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:24.294 --> 03:54:30.197]  I am Leanne McAdoo, joined by Owen Schroyer, and I would like to extend a thank you to Owen Schroyer.
[03:54:30.217 --> 03:54:32.377]  We'll handshake there.
[03:54:32.397 --> 03:54:37.800]  Because you were actually the prompt that helped me get my butt back in the gym.
[03:54:40.026 --> 03:54:43.427]  I will say it's because you were bullying me and harassing me, but it worked!
[03:54:43.707 --> 03:54:48.509]  I'm back in the gym, and we should all be back in the gym, making our bodies great again.
[03:54:48.549 --> 03:54:53.771]  That's why Alex Jones has introduced the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[03:54:54.211 --> 03:54:59.713]  Everybody knows Alex has really been working out pretty hardcore, and he wants all of us to join in with him.
[03:54:59.773 --> 03:55:04.095]  It's more important now than ever that we all
[03:55:04.915 --> 03:55:09.037]  Fight back against all the toxic garbage that they're putting in our food, the water, the air.
[03:55:09.537 --> 03:55:13.138]  Constantly we are under attack at every angle.
[03:55:13.438 --> 03:55:15.659]  We're fat, we're sick, we're dumbed down.
[03:55:15.879 --> 03:55:18.200]  How the heck are we supposed to fight against the globalists with that?
[03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:25.663]  So we are launching today the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again Super Sale Initiative at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:26.903 --> 03:55:28.164]  Our bodies are our temple.
[03:55:28.284 --> 03:55:32.248]  It is time to take them back, honor that, fight against this onslaught.
[03:55:32.908 --> 03:55:39.874]  So during this 2017 Super Sale, all of our top InfoWars life formulations are going to be on special.

[03:56:01.785 --> 03:56:06.106]  That's what these formulations have been created to do, is fight back against this onslaught.

[03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:20.954]  Let's make our bodies great again in 2017 as we are also making America great again.
[03:56:20.974 --> 03:56:24.156]  Now, Owen, what you got for us?
[03:56:24.895 --> 03:56:27.176]  Well, we saw this once.
[03:56:27.536 --> 03:56:29.477]  It was over the guns last time.
[03:56:30.398 --> 03:56:33.959]  The crybaby Democrats wanted to have a little sleepover.
[03:56:33.979 --> 03:56:34.720]  A little sit-in.
[03:56:34.740 --> 03:56:35.340]  You remember that?
[03:56:35.380 --> 03:56:37.101]  They did a little sit-in for gun control.
[03:56:37.161 --> 03:56:40.383]  Well, it was such a failing that they want to do it again.
[03:56:40.803 --> 03:56:42.664]  This time it's going to be led by Chuck Schumer.
[03:56:42.824 --> 03:56:45.945]  He's going to hold a pro-Obamacare Senate sleepover.
[03:56:45.985 --> 03:56:46.786]  Now, I want to read this.
[03:56:46.806 --> 03:56:47.866]  This is from the Daily Caller.
[03:56:48.247 --> 03:56:50.888]  Sorry I don't have the author of this in front of me, but this is actually funny.
[03:56:52.705 --> 03:56:56.911]  I hope old Chuck packed his blankie and his baba and his teddy bear.
[03:56:57.432 --> 03:56:59.715]  Somebody help him into his footie pajamas.
[03:57:00.156 --> 03:57:07.085]  It's time for the Democrats to hold a pajama bash and save whatever it is left that is their legacy.
[03:57:07.566 --> 03:57:12.828]  No, again, like I said, the Obama legacy is Donald Trump, period.
[03:57:13.128 --> 03:57:20.511]  When anybody tries to tell you the Obama legacy is this with jobs, this with the economy, this foreign relations, this, that, everything, I don't even want to get involved in those debates anymore.
[03:57:20.751 --> 03:57:21.671]  Trump, period.
[03:57:21.991 --> 03:57:22.331]  That's it.
[03:57:22.592 --> 03:57:23.452]  That's Obama's legacy.
[03:57:23.492 --> 03:57:26.113]  Republicans in the House and Senate, right, of course.
[03:57:26.593 --> 03:57:38.003]  Well, and I just want everyone to remind everyone what we saw from the WikiLeaks emails that Hillary Clinton was totally on board with the repeal of Obamacare, but she said, we have to wait for the Republicans to do it.
[03:57:38.304 --> 03:57:41.066]  So this has been the plan all along to repeal Obamacare.
[03:57:41.086 --> 03:57:41.867]  That's what they've got going.
[03:57:42.327 --> 03:57:46.112]  But we had Senator Rand Paul standing up, being very unpopular there.
[03:57:46.252 --> 03:57:59.949]  I think he was the only Republican to vote against this, the first step in repealing the Affordable Care Act, because they were tying it in to this budget proposal, which is going to increase the federal debt over 10 years.
[03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:05.570]  I believe $9.7 trillion that the American taxpayer would be on the hook for.
[03:58:05.930 --> 03:58:07.831]  Rand Paul was like, no, are you crazy?
[03:58:08.231 --> 03:58:13.332]  We have to repeal Obamacare, but we have to have a replacement for it at the same time.
[03:58:13.372 --> 03:58:14.612]  It's the only way it's going to work.
[03:58:14.952 --> 03:58:15.492]  And guess what?
[03:58:15.832 --> 03:58:19.993]  He got a phone call Friday night from Donald Trump who says, thank you, Rand Paul.
[03:58:20.053 --> 03:58:21.093]  You've got my support.
[03:58:21.133 --> 03:58:22.394]  So I think that's awesome.
[03:58:22.514 --> 03:58:28.575]  I'm hoping that Rand Paul teams up, that he has a more important role there in the Trump administration.
[03:58:28.615 --> 03:58:29.676]  You know who else got support?
[03:58:29.756 --> 03:58:32.599]  You know who else got support from Trump, but not from Obama?
[03:58:33.399 --> 03:58:34.701]  The governor, Rick Scott, in Florida.
[03:58:38.264 --> 03:58:38.424]  When?
[03:58:38.504 --> 03:58:39.725]  After the Fort Lauderdale shooting.
[03:58:40.306 --> 03:58:41.146]  Nothing from Obama.
[03:58:41.347 --> 03:58:42.007]  Ah, that's right.
[03:58:42.067 --> 03:58:42.448]  I see.
[03:58:42.608 --> 03:58:43.949]  He's just so irrelevant at this point.
[03:58:43.989 --> 03:58:44.429]  Fails again.
[03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:47.092]  The fact that he's never talking, I don't even notice anymore.
[03:58:47.332 --> 03:58:49.034]  Join us, InfoWars Nightly News, tonight.
[03:58:49.154 --> 03:58:49.734]  Tonight at 7.
[03:58:52.857 --> 03:58:56.821]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
