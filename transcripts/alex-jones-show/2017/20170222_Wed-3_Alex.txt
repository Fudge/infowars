[00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:01.552]  Mm hmm.
[00:00:01.572 --> 00:00:01.872]  Agreed.
[00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:06.273]  All right, we got to shut this down in a minute because the crew's been here for 18 hours.
[00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:07.894]  You guys, we'll shut this down and take five more calls.
[00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:08.314]  We're going to go.
[00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:13.496]  Um, well, I'm ready to, but I think we'll, we can clear.
[00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:13.836]  Okay.
[00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:14.096]  Okay.
[00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:14.516]  Go to who?
[00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.257]  Andrew and Terry, and then we're good.
[00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.517]  Who's up next?
[00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:20.358]  All right.
[00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.099]  Jerry in Texas.
[00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.239]  That was my granddaddy's name.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.080]  Go ahead.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.560]  You're on the air.
[00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:29.244]  Hey, I know you don't like to be this story, so just 30 seconds here.
[00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:31.605]  I had a website against Clintons about 20 years ago.
[00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.366]  I worked on HHO, free energy.
[00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:37.287]  I've seen the pressures that are brought to bear against individuals firsthand.
[00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:43.129]  When I was sold on you is when you were talking about punching that guy in a supermarket that was threatening you.
[00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:44.749]  I didn't know you could do that.
[00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.770]  I actually saw that firsthand.
[00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.132]  So the only thing I'd like to say is I don't buy your products because of what the products are.
[00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:53.529]  I buy the products.
[00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:54.770]  I bought it before the election.
[00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.611]  I just spent another $120 today.
[00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:58.873]  I buy it to fund the operation.
[00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:03.718]  What I want to see you do is sue the shit out of these people.
[00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.019]  Sue them for nothing.
[00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.259]  I know.
[00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.281]  It just takes so much money that I can hire them.
[00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:07.781]  I get it.
[00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:09.282]  I mean, they're discriminating.
[00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.023]  They're shutting us down.
[00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:11.164]  I want to do it.
[00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:13.766]  You're so justified.
[00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.928]  I will stick another $100 in the pool.
[00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:20.452]  But I'm telling you, and I speak for a lot of people, if you're not taking that fight,
[00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.300]  I'm out.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.642]  I'll go back to my own website.
[00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:24.205]  We fight.
[00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:27.750]  I want to sue him for saying we're not allowed to exist.
[00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.113]  That's discrimination.
[00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:30.796]  It's a discrimination lawsuit.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.801]  I hear you, Jerry.
[00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:34.642]  We've got to study law.
[00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:35.643]  We've got to be victorious.
[00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:40.849]  But it is discriminatory to say... You probably have some attorneys... They say you're a conservative, which we're not even conservative.
[00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.311]  We're just liberty lovers.
[00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:44.674]  We can't be on Google and they're going to ban us.
[00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:49.660]  I mean, it's clear like saying blacks can't go... You might have some attorneys out there... Don't get me wrong.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.302]  I love the products that I bought.
[00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:52.625]  And I'll continue to buy.
[00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.206]  I bought another random hat today.
[00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.088]  Just to stick it in people's faces.
[00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.709]  But that's the fight.
[00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.909]  I know.
[00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:59.170]  I appreciate your call.
[00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.031]  I appreciate his call.
[00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.371]  We're done.
[00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:01.192]  Listen.
[00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:02.053]  Look.
[00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:02.893]  Here's the deal.
[00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:05.896]  If you don't... We can try to get other sponsors and stuff.
[00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.737]  If you don't want to buy the products, they're great products.
[00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:09.719]  No, he's saying he wants you... No, no.
[00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.841]  But if you don't want to fund the tip of the spear, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:13.162]  If you're not into it, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:14.263]  He's into it.
[00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:15.405]  That's not what he's saying.
[00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:19.090]  He's saying, we are ready to fight back against these people.
[00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.375]  And I guarantee you there's some attorneys out there that would take it on pro bono.
[00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:22.775]  No, no.
[00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:26.421]  I gotta go get the exact lawyers that understand racketeering.
[00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.302]  Yeah, it's not easy to do it.
[00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.405]  I mean, it's like, I gotta do positions, fly around.
[00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:33.850]  Trust me, Jerry, I give Alex Jones this speech pretty much once a week.
[00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.911]  I'm like, why don't you sue him?
[00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:35.271]  Sue him!
[00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.152]  Call Alex up!
[00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:38.234]  And it's way bigger than that.
[00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:44.601]  It's not like you can just... It takes months and months and months, possibly even years, and you're fighting against a huge machine.
[00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:45.101]  There's the deal.
[00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.105]  The globalists, exactly, they put billions into this now.
[00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:49.666]  They don't care if they lose now.
[00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:50.587]  Oh yeah.
[00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:55.582]  Maybe a suit to point out what they're doing is wrong, so they don't do it to other people.
[00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.044]  I mean, I'm kind of, I want a suit.
[00:02:57.144 --> 00:03:00.349]  I mean, I think right now is the right time to do it, saying we don't exist.
[00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.374]  You know, bake the gay people's cake, but we can't be on Google?
[00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:06.377]  Because you just shed some fake list?
[00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:12.879]  It's like, they came after me, but I was, you know, they came after the Jews, but they were silent, and they came after the black people.
[00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.700]  That's what it is.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.601]  It's like people think, well good, take down InfoWars, but they didn't just take down InfoWars.
[00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:21.021]  They took off Breitbart and other websites.
[00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:27.723]  A lot of people got hit with this today, and it's people who have dissenting voices against the deep state.
[00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:29.063]  Yeah, and where's the common sense?
[00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:30.223]  It's going to be everybody.
[00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.504]  It's going to be everybody.
[00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:32.064]  Maybe everybody.
[00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:32.844]  The shadow government.
[00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:40.469]  Maybe everybody that has been hit by this, the other sides like Breitbart, maybe everybody could come together for like a class action lawsuit.
[00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.310]  They just want, they want it to stop.
[00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.831]  They're like, do something.
[00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:46.873]  But it's not going to stop Alex, and you know it's not going to stop.
[00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:48.134]  It's not going to stop.
[00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:49.215]  This is a big class issue.
[00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:53.598]  Well look, if the public doesn't want tax cuts, they don't want their guns, they don't support the broadcast.
[00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:56.440]  I mean that's really, I'm just here to like put the offer out.
[00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.104]  Because it's easy to contract.
[00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:00.045]  It's hard to expand.
[00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:01.527]  It's just this is a big moment.
[00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:02.588]  And so don't worry.
[00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.429]  People are responding.
[00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.490]  I want to thank them for the support.
[00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:06.012]  It's been good overall.
[00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:07.253]  And so, you know, we're doing well.
[00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.334]  Infoworkstore.com.
[00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.056]  Let's talk to Niles in Michigan.
[00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:10.797]  Niles, you're on the air.
[00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:11.478]  We're almost out of time.
[00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.626]  I just wanted to touch on something.
[00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:25.071]  I think you do such a great job of keeping things light and keeping things positive when it's so hard to do, you know, with all this crazy shit going on.
[00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:33.696]  You know, I saw that video of Leigh-Anne's little chihuahua in that Social Justice Warrior impersonation Millie did.
[00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:34.677]  Who was it?
[00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:35.117]  Millie?
[00:04:36.258 --> 00:04:41.481]  Yeah, and your Joe Rogan podcast, and I think that was, it's not what I called about, but
[00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:46.317]  I think that's just such an important part of this whole movement of Trump, you know?
[00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:50.701]  It's the positivity that's going, and people feel it, like you were saying at the inauguration.
[00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.491]  You know, people feel that positivity and it just fuels them.
[00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:55.872]  And I agree.
[00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:56.873]  We need to be positive.
[00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:57.954]  We're starting to turn the tide.
[00:04:58.294 --> 00:05:00.415]  But be hardcore about how serious the fight is.
[00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:01.356]  Exactly.
[00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:06.719]  And, you know, it can be very stressful, all of this information on all the bad news all the time with the globalists.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.200]  So I do think it is great.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.742]  Laughter is a great medicine.
[00:05:10.842 --> 00:05:12.763]  So, you know, we got to keep ourselves...
[00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:18.307]  I mean, they just blew us away, they just banned us, they just took a bunch of our funding for the next year away.
[00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:20.409]  I'm just saying, okay, we got some great products.
[00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.393]  If anybody took Supermail, if anybody took Bone Broth, they'd know what they need anyways.
[00:05:25.473 --> 00:05:29.456]  It's like, we're bringing you the very best stuff anyways, but it's just like, hey, you want to fight?
[00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:30.656]  You want somebody to fight the globalists?
[00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:32.218]  We're doing it, they're trying to shut us down.
[00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:33.218]  I know.
[00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:40.964]  I understand where you're coming from, and what I'm saying is, like, just as a general population, you know, people who aren't
[00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:51.850]  You know, they're working their jobs, and they come home and they watch the show at night, and they're not all day, every day, so caught up in, oh my God, how evil these people are.
[00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.391]  Yeah, they get caught up.
[00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.732]  Seeing how everybody's human, it reaches, it touches to the everyday, you know.
[00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.512]  The resistance, like you're saying, you know, the everyday guys.
[00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:10.074]  Look, it's you, the people, they disdain and think you're dumb and that they control.
[00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:11.295]  The lazy American.
[00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:16.538]  And I, you know, they saw me with energy and they just were like, you know, join us.
[00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:18.259]  I'm like, someone's going to screw people over, man.
[00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.000]  And so I said, I'm going to fight.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.381]  I believe humanity is going to win.
[00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:22.761]  We're starting to.
[00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.183]  And I'm just saying we're getting hit with some big shots.
[00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:32.627]  And, you know, I thought sometimes, you know, you guys wouldn't have a job, but pulling away for a year, shut everything down, you know, people would pay more attention when I came back.
[00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:47.193]  You know, but I don't want to even do that because it's like Trump said, and then a few months ago when he first got in, a month, five weeks ago, he said, you know, I looked at Obamacare, it's such a scam, I could get rid of it the next year and you'd be attacked and I'm doing something political and that's not perfect.
[00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:52.555]  Or I could let it stay in place with $5,000 fines for everybody and bankrupt the economy and I could look like a hero.
[00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:53.455]  But you know what?
[00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.096]  The people deserve not having this happening.
[00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:55.696]  I'm going to fight it.
[00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:59.017]  So they say, oh, he's a failure, he can't repeal it, oh, what's he going to do with it?
[00:06:59.357 --> 00:06:59.777]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:00.017 --> 00:07:06.420]  When, you know, Gruber said we're dumb f's and you're going to screw us over and Ramos and Trump's like just ignoring all that, trying to fix it.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.300]  It's the same thing.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.882]  I just can't sit here and watch him do the stuff they do and I'll oppose him.
[00:07:11.902 --> 00:07:17.344]  And it's not because I'm perfect, it's because I'm not aligned, and I appreciate your call, Niles, thank you, with this evil force.
[00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.004]  Ladies, a one-minute final comment.
[00:07:19.024 --> 00:07:23.246]  I want to thank all the viewers in this 13-hour, eight-minute transmission so far.
[00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:30.646]  Well, I just want to say thanks to everyone for sticking with us, not only for this 13-hour broadcast, but of course throughout all of the years.
[00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:43.409]  I've been here almost four years now, and I can just see what an effect we are having worldwide, and it's so obvious now with the fact that they have come and delivered this blow to the InfoWars.
[00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.189]  You're fake news, you can advertise on Go!
[00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.810]  Yes, this is major.
[00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.332]  We're going to demonize you everywhere, but you don't have any speech.
[00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:50.352]  You should roll over and die.
[00:07:50.452 --> 00:08:06.183]  This is proof that your support has really made a huge, massive difference, and it has pissed off the globalists, and that they want to shut us down, slowly, because they can't do it all at once, take us off, because that would put off too many flags, too many signals.
[00:08:06.563 --> 00:08:09.125]  So they've got to cut out one supply channel there.
[00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:13.088]  And so, to me, that should... As a test, to see what we do.
[00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:18.410]  Yeah, and this is awesome because that's how powerful this message is, that it's spreading worldwide.
[00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.172]  And like, in every case in culture, once they do that, then they send guys with guns to your house.
[00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:25.393]  I mean, you guys really want to go this direction?
[00:08:25.653 --> 00:08:29.594]  I mean, I don't sit here as like some tough guy, but like, I'm like war machine.
[00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:31.275]  Look at what I did with Info.
[00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:36.937]  You sit there with war machines, and you try to play games how you're going to do all this to us.
[00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:39.198]  Do you understand once you go to the next level,
[00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.459]  I mean, the problem is it's like stomping on piles of dog crap.
[00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.399]  I don't even want to go after you.
[00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.500]  Yeah, they would really awaken the giant.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.200]  I mean, they just have no idea.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.581]  Do you think Zuckerberg and his Kauai mansion is safe?
[00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.101]  The natives already want to go after him.
[00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:57.683]  I mean, it's like, you're not, you better go to space or Mars like Elon Musk wants, because you're not, you know, it's not a threat either.
[00:08:58.283 --> 00:08:59.163]  I don't threaten people.
[00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:00.544]  It's like, you want to threaten us?
[00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:02.324]  You want to try to roll over us?
[00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:03.905]  You're going to get your asses kicked.
[00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:05.945]  You're going to get your arms torn out of their sockets.
[00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:08.006]  Humanity is awakening.
[00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:22.970]  You know, I really personally think that, you know, obviously we should avoid any type of physical warring or battling with them because they, I mean, even though the numbers and the amount of guns and ammo in this country is insane and they most likely would have their butts
[00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:23.630]  Yeah.
[00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:41.914]  I agree.
[00:09:41.934 --> 00:09:44.237]  These guys always, I'll just go after the UN when I see them.
[00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:46.020]  They'll be called your local police by then.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.883]  That's the Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:48.925]  It's already here.
[00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:49.426]  Exactly.
[00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.589]  We have to fight now in the information war.
[00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.454]  If you don't fight now, you'll never fight when it's real.
[00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.596]  Infowarstore.com
[00:09:56.573 --> 00:09:57.593]  Ladies, thank you so much.
[00:09:57.613 --> 00:09:58.734]  The crew, thank you so much.
[00:09:59.054 --> 00:09:59.974]  We're going to be back here tomorrow.
[00:09:59.994 --> 00:10:02.815]  We're going to play some excerpts of this on the weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.595]  to 3 p.m., and have so many other people here.
[00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:05.996]  But thank you.
[00:10:06.056 --> 00:10:08.176]  Terry and Andrew, you guys get a t-shirt.
[00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:09.516]  Thank you for holding so many.
[00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:10.897]  And you ladies are awesome.
[00:10:11.957 --> 00:10:13.938]  In closing, 30 seconds on the info.
[00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:15.298]  I mean, is it not exciting what we're doing?
[00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:44.313]  It's very exciting and you know there really truly is a war on for your mind and and for me that is like it's a spiritual warfare however you want to see that that is what the robots that's what they're trying to build the robots to be able to do is to have our consciousness to have our spirit and that's why that's our ultimate weapon that we need to empower ourselves as well as with this information because they cannot stop that once we're able to bust through that frequency that is worldwide that is
[00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:46.473]  Cosmos stuff right there.
[00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:49.534]  And we need a nest for men and women and children.
[00:10:50.334 --> 00:10:52.015]  We need to be able to be left alone.
[00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:53.675]  We're under total attack.
[00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:55.835]  We need to have a nest.
[00:10:56.196 --> 00:11:03.537]  We need them to stop trying to attack our children with these vaccines and all this chemical warfare.
[00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:08.998]  We need them to stop attacking our school children by trying to indoctrinate them in their schools.
[00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:11.159]  Oh, they admit the vaccines are brain damaging.
[00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:35.121]  We need them to stop this stuff and we are not going to stop fighting against this stuff until it is all gone because that's what we're here to do and each and every one of us has a very spiritually strong feeling and prompting to do this so I just want to thank all you guys out there for for listening and for supporting InfoWars, supporting the cause because you know without you guys
[00:11:36.282 --> 00:11:38.203]  These guys would be here.
[00:11:38.443 --> 00:11:39.724]  Yeah, we would have Hillary.
[00:11:39.764 --> 00:11:42.124]  Sucking the life out of the little newborn baby.
[00:11:42.144 --> 00:11:43.025]  Great job, everybody.
[00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.626]  I'll see you back in like six hours, seven hours here.
[00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:46.766]  Thank you, Mellie.
[00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:47.507]  Thank you, Leigh Ann.
[00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:48.187]  Thank you, Crew.
[00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:48.887]  Thank you, Allie.
[00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:50.988]  Thank you, everybody in there, CJ.
[00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.129]  But hey, it's the Great Animated Contest of Liberty.
[00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:54.629]  We didn't roll over to this big attack.
[00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:55.370]  We're here.
[00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.510]  The audience supported us.
[00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.891]  We salute you and thank you.
[00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.871]  And that is it for this transmission.
[00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:01.212]  13 hours and 12 minutes.
[00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:02.152]  Yes.
[00:12:02.212 --> 00:12:04.013]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:05.514]  Oh, it was 12-12-12.
[00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:06.355]  What do you know?
[00:12:07.536 --> 00:12:08.016]  It is 12-12-12.
[00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:08.617]  Yeah.
[00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:11.379]  Great job.
[00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:13.100]  Thank you.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.640]  Let us pray.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.861]  Our Father, who art in heaven,
[00:12:34.585 --> 00:12:42.025]  Hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:12:43.084 --> 00:13:05.495]  Give us these days our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for time is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.682]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:47.093]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:52.257]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[00:13:52.277 --> 00:13:53.438]  You can look them up for yourself.
[00:13:54.099 --> 00:14:03.801]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:10.083]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.823]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:15.064]  People are falling apart.
[00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.084]  They're totally depressed.
[00:14:16.104 --> 00:14:16.664]  They're unhappy.
[00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:18.205]  What is going on?
[00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:23.326]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:27.155]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:29.235]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:14:29.455 --> 00:14:36.457]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:44.999]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:52.919]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.724]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:59.888]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:05.574]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:15:06.095 --> 00:15:19.979]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.499]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:15:21.939 --> 00:15:27.541]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.587]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:37.549]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:47.313]  High-quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:52.155]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:54.176]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.997]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:15:57.277 --> 00:16:03.400]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:13.384]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:17.986]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[00:16:18.526 --> 00:16:21.127]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.109]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.939]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:11.048]  Hello?
[00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:14.590]  And don't worry, a bunch of Somalis are getting let in right now.
[00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.551]  Unvetted.
[00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:24.615]  They don't let women do the call to prayer under any Islamic system.
[00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:27.837]  So all of it is just completely upside down cuckoo land.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.021]  And what do their signs say?
[00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:37.182]  Dismantle white supremacy.
[00:17:38.443 --> 00:17:40.384]  Everything is anti-white, anti-west.
