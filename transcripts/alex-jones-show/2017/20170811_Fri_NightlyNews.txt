[00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:24.745]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.846]  It is Friday, August 11th, 2017.
[00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:31.070]  I am your host, Owen Schroer, and we've got a lot of news coming up today.
[00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.594]  We've got the full 10-minute press conference of Donald Trump today.
[00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:43.159]  He had some statements, some brief statements, while sitting down at a meeting that he had on North Korea.
[00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.902]  And then when he exited that meeting, he came out and made some statements.
[00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:47.843]  We're good to go.
[00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:12.959]  Well, we've got liberals that say that people that are in the NRA are domestic terrorists, if you can believe that.
[00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.582]  And then Jesse Lee Peterson, you may know Jesse Lee Peterson, he's been on with me before.
[00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:21.845]  He got kicked out of his gym tonight for being a Trump supporter.
[00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.967]  Kicked out for supporting Trump, one of the nicest men you could ever meet.
[00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.830]  We'll have all that and more for you tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:39.133]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:57.398]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:58.178 --> 00:02:06.024]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:15.591]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:31.076]  And so I set out working with the top formulator in the country to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:35.779]  Known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:34.768]  Well the tension between the United States and North Korea is increasing as the days go by especially this week will be a week that is noted when it comes to the tensions and it almost seems inevitable at this point that something is going to be done about North Korea and the Kim
[00:03:35.688 --> 00:03:38.570]  Dynasty, dictatorship in communist North Korea.
[00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.972]  It looks like it's going to happen during the Trump presidency.
[00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:53.160]  And we're all sitting here hoping that this isn't the same type of neocon, warmongering, military-industrial complex, starting wars over fake news like we saw in the Middle East.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.222]  But we're monitoring this situation.
[00:03:56.362 --> 00:04:01.185]  Trump has not preemptively struck yet, neither has Kim Jong-un.
[00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:02.546]  Now, President Trump
[00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:05.525]  Actually, also, it's just now breaking.
[00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:07.689]  Yeah, there's the story today.
[00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.153]  That was when Trump was in his office.
[00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:16.423]  Addressing the media about North Korea and making statements on a litany of topics.
[00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:23.285]  And then he exited that meeting and came out with Nikki Haley, McMasters and Tillerson and did a press conference.
[00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:34.809]  Also want to note before we go to that press conference that now, according to AP, and this is on the headline of Drudge, this just broke, Trump is now considering military response to Venezuela!
[00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:43.811]  So you've got communist dictatorships failing in North Korea and communist dictatorships failing in Venezuela.
[00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:49.612]  And it's up to the capitalists to do something about it or not intervene at all and just let those hell holes continue.
[00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:50.692]  But let's go.
[00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.053]  I want to go to this entire press conference.
[00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:59.895]  This is a press conference today from President Trump addressing the news after his meeting addressing North Korea.
[00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:01.335]  Go ahead and roll this press conference, guys.
[00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:08.389]  So here comes Trump again with Tillerson, Haley and McMaster.
[00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:14.814]  I have to be honest, it makes me feel a little uneasy that he's in there with Haley and McMaster, two people I don't fully trust.
[00:05:16.058 --> 00:05:16.759]  Thank you, everybody.
[00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:17.780]  We had a very good meeting.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.943]  We talked about North Korea, as you can imagine.
[00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:22.205]  We're very much in agreement.
[00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:25.109]  I think we're very unified, and we have been right from the beginning.
[00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.331]  This is something that has to stop.
[00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:29.634]  We all feel that very strongly.
[00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:32.117]  I will be speaking to President Xi tonight.
[00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:33.198]  He?
[00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:33.819]  From China.
[00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.320]  He?
[00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.722]  We've been working very closely with China and with other countries.
[00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:41.604]  That phone call will take place tonight.
[00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:44.705]  So President Trump will speak with the President of China tonight.
[00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:49.927]  What have you been able to do to reassure South Korea, given the recent tensions rising?
[00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:54.589]  Well, I think as far as reassurance, they probably feel as reassured as they can feel.
[00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.171]  Certainly they feel more reassured with me than they do with other presidents from the past.
[00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:03.233]  A jab at Obama, a jab at Bush, a jab at Clinton.
[00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:06.717]  And that's why we're at this horrible situation right now.
[00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:07.257]  That's true.
[00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:09.100]  It is a very bad situation.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.322]  It's a very dangerous situation.
[00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:15.167]  It was the Bill Clinton nuclear deal with North Korea that wound us in this situation.
[00:06:15.227 --> 00:06:18.892]  It was the Barack Obama administration that said that this was not the case.
[00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.796]  They were not nuclear capable as we now know they are.
[00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:27.521]  They're very impressed with the job we're doing and let's see how it turns out.
[00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:34.308]  Were you being sarcastic when you thanked Vladimir Putin for expelling 755 diplomats from Russia?
[00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:35.810]  In order to reduce our payroll?
[00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.451]  Absolutely.
[00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:37.232]  I think you know that.
[00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:38.253]  I think you know that.
[00:06:38.293 --> 00:06:38.693]  We'll see.
[00:06:38.953 --> 00:06:45.839]  In fact, I was just speaking to the Secretary, and we're talking about coming up with an answer.
[00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.781]  And that's been going back and forth, folks.
[00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.625]  I mean, Russian diplomats, United States diplomats being removed from the other country.
[00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:55.028]  That's been something that's been going on back and forth.
[00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:58.691]  But it's the Democrats that started the trade war with Russia.
[00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.552]  This is very key.
[00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:01.033]  The Democrats started the trade war.
[00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:02.955]  You know what I can say?
[00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:04.336]  Hopefully it'll all work out.
[00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:10.652]  Okay, nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you.
[00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:14.176]  Hopefully it'll work out, but this has been going on for many years.
[00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:18.780]  Would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago before they were in the position that they're in.
[00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:21.743]  But we will see what happens.
[00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:26.387]  We think that lots of good things could happen and we could also have a bad solution.
[00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:28.909]  But we think lots of good things can happen.
[00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:30.129]  I think you know the answer to that.
[00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.150]  I think you know the answer to that.
[00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.091]  Well, we have...
[00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:47.017]  I would assume that that means that we would intervene in North Korea.
[00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:48.718]  That's what I assume President Trump is saying.
[00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:49.918]  If he got to that point.
[00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:59.304]  So now he's addressing dealing with the mess that was the Iran deal from the Obama administration and the mess that is now North Korea thanks to the Clinton administration.
[00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.470]  I think few have done anywhere near what we've done.
[00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.531]  And we'll work now on tax reform cuts.
[00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.251]  We'll never stop working on, as you know, health care.
[00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:20.592]  That's also working.
[00:08:20.612 --> 00:08:28.673]  You know, I'm surprised, as Nikki Haley is sitting there, I'm surprised that Nikki Haley hasn't said, the next explosion that happens, we're going to blame North Korea.
[00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:32.574]  Just like she said, the next chemical attack in Syria, we're going to blame Assad.
[00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:35.895]  I'm surprised that Nikki Haley hasn't jumped to any conclusions in that scenario.
[00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:41.549]  General Kelly has brought a tremendous... Very complimentary of Kelly here.
[00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:54.376]  Didn't really mention McMaster's or give McMaster's even a moment of attention, which I noted from this press conference.
[00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:56.317]  Yeah, Mitch McConnell failed.
[00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:16.652]  He had a couple of votes that turned on him, and that should have been very easy to handle, whether it's through the fact that you take away a committee chair.
[00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:19.535]  No, see, Trump is smarter than that, and he knows that that's not the truth.
[00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:25.921]  The Republicans rigged this deal with the vote to have the three women voted down, including Susan Collins.
[00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:26.622]  That was a total
[00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:27.842]  I was not impressed.
[00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.471]  Now, can he do good?
[00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:51.352]  I think so.
[00:09:51.452 --> 00:09:54.334]  I think we can do very well on taxes, cuts, reform.
[00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:55.235]  But he's got to get back to work.
[00:09:55.255 --> 00:10:00.339]  I think we can do well on infrastructure and things will happen with respect to health care.
[00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:09.907]  And I think things will happen maybe outside of necessarily needing Congress because there are things that I can do as president that will have a huge impact on health care.
[00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:11.588]  So you watch.
[00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:13.110]  That's going to trigger the liberals.
[00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.511]  And what did you tell him?
[00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.032]  No, I have not, but I feel that they will be very safe.
[00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:19.053]  Believe me, they will be very safe.
[00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:23.956]  And if anything happens to Guam, there's gonna be big, big trouble in North Korea.
[00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.438]  Have you heard any change in our military readiness?
[00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:27.579]  I don't want it to say.
[00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:29.280]  I don't talk about that.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.780]  You know that.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.324]  It is worth noting that the Marine has grounded all of their...
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.242]  You're interrupting your- Aircraft for 24 hours.
[00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:45.145]  They're saying that was in response to a search that they were on.
[00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.966]  But worth noting, it also headlined Drudge today.
[00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:51.428]  I have meetings on Monday and Tuesday going to Manhattan.
[00:10:52.049 --> 00:10:53.289]  But I stay out- This is key right here.
[00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:54.410]  Because it's so disruptive.
[00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.013]  All of my life, I mean my adult life, because I grew up in Queens, not in Manhattan.
[00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:04.676]  But during the time that I lived in Manhattan, whenever a president came in, it was very disruptive.
[00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.898]  And I think I'm probably more disruptive than any of them.
[00:11:08.578 --> 00:11:13.562]  So when they have to close Fifth Avenue, when they have to close 56th Street and many other streets.
[00:11:14.182 --> 00:11:15.523]  So I'm here for that reason.
[00:11:15.963 --> 00:11:17.704]  We're doing a tremendous amount of work.
[00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:19.405]  We're having large numbers of meetings.
[00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:37.177]  We're going to have a pretty big press conference on Monday.
[00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:39.979]  Secretary Tillerson has spoken emphasizing diplomacy.
[00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:43.321]  You've spoken increasingly emphasizing the potential for military options.
[00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:44.902]  Are you two on the same page?
[00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:45.422]  Totally.
[00:11:46.103 --> 00:11:47.864]  I can tell you totally on the same page.
[00:11:50.505 --> 00:12:04.115]  By the way, I believe the press conference that he just mentioned on Monday is going to be in regards to the fact he's returning to the White House early since the renovations were being done to the ventilation system, or I mean the bugs were being taken out of the White House.
[00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:05.837]  Let's go to Tillerson.
[00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:08.757]  Tillerson was just, was he just in Guam?
[00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:09.738]  I believe he was just in Guam.
[00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:11.598]  He's flying around all the time, man.
[00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:12.178]  Him and Trump
[00:12:34.662 --> 00:12:41.487]  I tell you, I've never seen two guys that are actually moving and shaking as much as Tillerson and Trump, whether you like them or hate them.
[00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:45.729]  I mean, they are constantly moving and shaking and working and trying to talk to people and get people together.
[00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.012]  What do you make of this awful situation that they're losing their hearing, these American diplomats?
[00:12:50.132 --> 00:12:51.293]  I mean, that's tiring, folks.
[00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:52.914]  You just described it exactly correctly.
[00:12:52.954 --> 00:12:54.415]  This is why we're bringing people out.
[00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.863]  We have many options for Venezuela.
[00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:05.323]  And by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option.
[00:13:05.943 --> 00:13:08.484]  We have many options for Venezuela.
[00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:09.704]  This is our neighbor.
[00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:16.286]  This is, you know, we're all over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away.
[00:13:17.086 --> 00:13:21.408]  Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering, and they're dying.
[00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:27.852]  We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.
[00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:30.293]  That's an interesting logical point he points out.
[00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:35.816]  We have all of these military bases all over the world, but our neighbor, Venezuela, we're not taking care of.
[00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:41.058]  Oh, and by the way, Maduro offered a hand to Trump today.
[00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:42.879]  He said he wanted to negotiate with Trump.
[00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:44.140]  This is how Trump responds.
[00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:58.655]  Let me hear others say it, because when you say that, I don't know what you're referring to and who's making the statement.
[00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:02.696]  But let me hear Kim Jong Un say it, okay?
[00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:03.617]  He's not saying it.
[00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.337]  He hasn't been saying much for the last three days.
[00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:08.378]  You let me hear him say it.
[00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:15.733]  So there a reporter says Kim Jong-un said this and this and Trump's like I don't know about that.
[00:14:15.773 --> 00:14:17.614]  Did he say that or are you saying that?
[00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:22.515]  So that's basically Trump saying I'm not gonna fall for your fake news that tricks us into war.
[00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:23.876]  That's what that means to me.
[00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:24.856]  That is key.
[00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:31.299]  It's very tough if we have to to protect the American people and also to protect our allies.
[00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:34.340]  Do you think your vice president will be a candidate for president in 2020?
[00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:37.491]  I don't think so, no.
[00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:39.052]  No, I don't think so at all.
[00:14:39.092 --> 00:14:40.152]  He's a good guy.
[00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:43.452]  He's just, as you know, he's left for Columbia and various other places.
[00:14:44.673 --> 00:14:45.433]  He's been terrific.
[00:14:45.473 --> 00:14:49.213]  He's been a great ally of mine and a great friend of mine.
[00:14:49.253 --> 00:14:50.554]  Are you considering further economic sanctions?
[00:14:50.574 --> 00:14:52.234]  You don't seem to be bothered by that question at all.
[00:14:52.374 --> 00:14:52.874]  Yes, we are.
[00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:53.634]  Yes, we are.
[00:14:53.674 --> 00:14:54.614]  Very strong ones.
[00:14:54.874 --> 00:14:56.075]  They're already very strong.
[00:14:56.755 --> 00:15:00.575]  We are considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level.
[00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:04.316]  And probably, you could say, as strong as they get.
[00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:07.007]  Hey, thank you very much everybody.
[00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:07.528]  Thank you.
[00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:15.053]  So that was President Trump again with Nikki Haley, HR McMaster and Tillerson by his side.
[00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:28.363]  And again, it was interesting to me, it was worth noting to me, when he came out with Haley and McMaster to his left, I'm like, oh man, is he really in there debating foreign policy and what to do in North Korea with Haley and McMaster?
[00:15:29.004 --> 00:15:30.385]  That is the last thing I want.
[00:15:30.925 --> 00:15:32.787]  But then he gets out there, he does the press conference,
[00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:36.689]  Steered the media to Tillerson.
[00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:38.970]  He gave the podium to Tillerson multiple times.
[00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.451]  Pretty much ignored McMaster's and Haley.
[00:15:42.412 --> 00:15:47.254]  Pretty much ignored the Chrome Dome and the warmongering Haley.
[00:15:47.334 --> 00:15:49.575]  He wants to blame Syria for anything without any evidence.
[00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:52.556]  So that was an important press conference to me.
[00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:58.059]  It was worth noting that Trump says he's not going to fall for what he hears in the media about what Kim Jong-un is saying.
[00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:19.106]  Says that he will consider perhaps a military response to what is happening in Venezuela and again just kind of ignores Haley and McMaster's presence as he was giving that press conference while at the same time pitching it to Rex Tillerson multiple times.
[00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:24.927]  So those are some interesting points of note for me in that press conference as well as some other stuff.
[00:16:25.247 --> 00:16:27.028]  Now let's just look at some of the headlines today.
[00:16:28.068 --> 00:16:33.410]  Regarding North Korea and everything that's been going on in response to the tensions rising in the last 24 hours.
[00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:40.153]  Again, Trump warns North Korea, this is really the third time this week, against making overt threats.
[00:16:40.213 --> 00:16:42.053]  So he had the fire and fury comment.
[00:16:42.393 --> 00:16:43.694]  The media freaked out about it.
[00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.835]  He doubled down and said it wasn't tough enough.
[00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:54.338]  And then today, again, after this meeting, addressing the media, saying North Korea, he's warning them against making more overt threats.
[00:16:56.145 --> 00:17:02.332]  Reuters has the headline, Trump says US is locked and loaded in North Korea confrontation.
[00:17:04.735 --> 00:17:15.286]  In response to this, thousands of North Korea's top military officials march in support of Kim Jong-un as Pyongyang warns it could reduce the US mainland to ashes at any moment.
[00:17:18.692 --> 00:17:24.796]  Again, you have to ask yourself, what is this show of military that North Korea has in response?
[00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:25.296]  What is this?
[00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:29.299]  Is this everybody in North Korea that really wants to go to war with America?
[00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:41.047]  Or is this all of the essentially slaves, North Korean communist slaves, that have to go out and be against the United States of America?
[00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:47.271]  Otherwise, the Kim Jong-un, Kim dynasty, police state dictatorship is going to disappear them.
[00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:52.217]  So you just have to see that response and wonder what that's about.
[00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:54.941]  Now AP also had this story.
[00:17:56.638 --> 00:18:12.206]  Beyond bluster, U.S.-North Korea in regular contact, and this story is insinuating that there has been a back-channel communication, back-channel diplomacy happening between North Korea and the United States.
[00:18:12.766 --> 00:18:18.029]  I doubt that Dennis Rodman has anything to do with that, but it is funny that Dennis Rodman is silent all of a sudden.
[00:18:18.489 --> 00:18:19.330]  So you do wonder
[00:18:21.207 --> 00:18:23.230]  Is there backchannel contact going on?
[00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.211]  Does that exist?
[00:18:24.572 --> 00:18:29.318]  Will that trigger the Democrats like we saw them triggered at the potentiality of a Russian backchannel?
[00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:36.869]  Because it's only good to have diplomacy if it agrees with what the liberals want, not if it's going to keep you from going to war.
[00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.071]  If it's going to be on the back channel.
[00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:46.915]  But again, another day goes by of Trump's ratings going up because of a show in force of the military.
[00:18:46.975 --> 00:18:50.677]  Remember, it was last week Trump was seeing lows in approval rating.
[00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:58.761]  Now with the show of might and the threats against North Korea, his approval rating gets a bump all the way up to 45% today at the close of the week.
[00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.962]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:15.335]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:17.976]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:18.176 --> 00:19:20.978]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:21.418 --> 00:19:22.478]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:25.360]  We're good to go!
[00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:47.467]  And of strength.
[00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:51.829]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:59.813]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years since we launched InfoWars Live to actually come up with this.
[00:20:00.614 --> 00:20:11.819]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:26.529]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:27.730]  You owe it to yourself.
[00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:38.333]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:38.413 --> 00:20:46.676]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:53.558]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:54.605 --> 00:20:58.386]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:58.846 --> 00:21:03.228]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:03.788 --> 00:21:07.609]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:07.649 --> 00:21:09.410]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.191]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:16.514]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:16.554 --> 00:21:29.682]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:30.362 --> 00:21:31.983]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:32.363 --> 00:21:35.184]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:35.204 --> 00:21:36.184]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:36.664 --> 00:21:39.185]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:39.545 --> 00:21:41.946]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:45.227]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:46.888]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:47.128 --> 00:21:52.370]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.970]  Again,
[00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:59.453]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:59.873 --> 00:22:04.196]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:08.458]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:13.361]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[00:22:13.381 --> 00:22:31.796]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:34.938]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:22:34.998 --> 00:22:37.020]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.382]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:39.822 --> 00:22:51.451]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:55.314]  So support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:23:08.922 --> 00:23:10.403]  Well, well, well.
[00:23:10.483 --> 00:23:14.045]  It looks like this dog is going to hunt.
[00:23:14.846 --> 00:23:16.287]  Or at least attempt to.
[00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:18.868]  Daily Caller has now gotten an exclusive.
[00:23:19.388 --> 00:23:25.112]  Congressman circulates letter to ask for Mueller to appear in public congressional hearing.
[00:23:26.073 --> 00:23:30.095]  I'm not really sure where this would go.
[00:23:30.115 --> 00:23:36.439]  I'm not exactly sure what a Mueller testimony would be like.
[00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:37.740]  Nonetheless,
[00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:48.391]  It is nice to see the tables finally turned here so that Trump isn't the only one being looked at and questioned and that side of things isn't the only one being questioned when they can't even find anything.
[00:23:50.192 --> 00:24:00.797]  So now Texas Republican Brian Babbitt is asking for congressmen to sign onto a letter requesting that Special Counsel Robert Mueller appear publicly in a congressional hearing.
[00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:06.901]  Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference and possible ties between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
[00:24:08.083 --> 00:24:08.583]  Wait a second.
[00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:10.744]  I had to stop myself right there.
[00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:19.526]  This really shows the lunacy of the Russia probe.
[00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:22.907]  Let me just read this again for you.
[00:24:22.927 --> 00:24:25.148]  And just let this soak in.
[00:24:26.128 --> 00:24:34.911]  Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference and possible ties between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
[00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:36.191]  Really?
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.460]  Is that the truth, folks?
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.381]  Is that really what's going on?
[00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:42.741]  That's what we're told!
[00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:47.702]  That's what we're supposed to believe, but is that really what's going on?
[00:24:48.662 --> 00:24:51.182]  Is that really the scope of this investigation still?
[00:24:53.483 --> 00:24:54.263]  Of course not!
[00:24:55.183 --> 00:24:56.863]  Even the people that hate Trump know that.
[00:24:57.423 --> 00:24:58.383]  They're looking for anything.
[00:24:58.423 --> 00:24:59.924]  They're looking at financial records.
[00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:01.424]  They're looking at tax records.
[00:25:01.604 --> 00:25:07.325]  They're looking for anything to bring these people in, get them with a process crime, get them with a petty crime.
[00:25:09.705 --> 00:25:15.610]  This has nothing to do whatsoever with Russian election interference.
[00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:17.392]  You know why?
[00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:31.124]  Because if that was true, Robert Mueller would have busted in the doors of the DNC, busted in Debbie Washerman Schultz's office, and demanded the servers that they have refused to hand over to the FBI.
[00:25:33.524 --> 00:25:45.846]  Can you imagine if the SWAT team or the no-knock raid team that went to Robert Mueller's house would have found smashed cell phones, smashed hard drives, and smashed laptops?
[00:25:46.946 --> 00:25:49.347]  Can you imagine the media frenzy today if that happened?
[00:25:51.527 --> 00:25:58.009]  So, clearly, they're not concerned with Russian election interference because they're not even trying to get the DNC servers.
[00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:00.209]  So that is a complete lie.
[00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:02.989]  That is a complete false narrative.
[00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:09.611]  And if Mueller is looking into ties between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, fine, I'll believe that.
[00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:11.972]  I'll go ahead and believe that song and dance.
[00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:24.996]  But if you're going to do that, how can you not look at the ties between Bill Clinton's administration and Hillary Clinton's State Department and Russia and Ukraine?
[00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:32.772]  Which they won't do, which shows that this is nothing more than a persecution of Donald Trump by the deep state.
[00:26:33.152 --> 00:26:36.894]  A witch hunt against Donald Trump because he is an American president.
[00:26:37.274 --> 00:26:49.641]  Babin's letter, obtained by the Daily Caller, was sent out to Congressmen Thursday and asked for members to co-sign a letter he plans to send to the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte and Senator Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley.
[00:26:49.901 --> 00:26:51.982]  Chuck Grassley will not ignore this letter.
[00:26:52.322 --> 00:26:53.803]  Let's hope it reaches his desk.
[00:26:54.443 --> 00:26:55.964]  And here are the words from Babin.
[00:26:57.176 --> 00:27:07.403]  Every nominee for the United States Attorney must be confirmed by the Senate, a process that brings to the forefront any concerns regarding the nominee's ability to hold their position in a decent and impartial manner.
[00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:07.963]  Here's the key.
[00:27:08.283 --> 00:27:18.970]  However, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of lawyers investigate our very own president, we as a nation wait in the dark with very little information about those given this great authority.
[00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.971]  Bingo.
[00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:21.792]  None of these people were elected.
[00:27:21.932 --> 00:27:22.993]  They're all Clinton attorneys.
[00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:25.299]  What are they doing?
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.481]  They keep hiring more lawyers!
[00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:29.502]  Whose money is being spent?
[00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:30.462]  Ours!
[00:27:30.822 --> 00:27:34.284]  Our taxpayer money on a witch hunt against the president we elected.
[00:27:35.545 --> 00:27:46.631]  And now Babin from Texas is calling it out saying, why are the American people paying for this investigation into the American president and not getting any answers?
[00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:48.452]  Getting no transparency.
[00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:51.296]  It's so criminal.
[00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:52.497]  It's so frustrating.
[00:27:52.797 --> 00:27:53.997]  I'm so upset right now.
[00:27:54.118 --> 00:27:58.619]  I want to throw this microphone through this nice camera here, but I'm just going to move on.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.640]  I don't know how Trump puts up with this, folks.
[00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:02.301]  I really don't.
[00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:03.821]  I really, really don't.
[00:28:04.522 --> 00:28:09.183]  More justice coming for the Democrats potentially here, if justice exists in this country.
[00:28:09.924 --> 00:28:13.725]  Attorney for Loretta Lynch at Justice Department now at Committee Investigating Lynch.
[00:28:13.805 --> 00:28:15.186]  Oh wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:28:16.387 --> 00:28:18.948]  You've got Democrats looking into Democrats.
[00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:20.930]  There's not going to be any justice here.
[00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.690]  Can you even believe this?
[00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:32.218]  An attorney in the Justice Department who helped edit press statements about the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, illegal, is now a top attorney for Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:32.938]  Wow.
[00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.500]  Talk about needing to recuse yourself.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.701]  Talk about conflict of interest.
[00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:42.425]  Which is currently investigating Lynch over concerns she may have tried to influence the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:42.805 --> 00:28:43.526]  Wait a second!
[00:28:44.915 --> 00:28:46.937]  Do we really need an investigation into that?
[00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:54.082]  James Comey admitted himself under oath that Lynch said refer to it as a matter.
[00:28:55.203 --> 00:28:56.644]  So we already know that's going on.
[00:28:57.905 --> 00:29:01.528]  So you've got these probes into Trump where they can't find anything and we know there's nothing.
[00:29:01.868 --> 00:29:07.552]  Meanwhile, there's absolutely nothing into Hillary Clinton, nothing into Loretta Lynch, even though we know it's all there.
[00:29:09.034 --> 00:29:10.935]  Again, I don't know how Trump does it, folks.
[00:29:12.352 --> 00:29:13.152]  I don't know how he does it.
[00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:14.633]  Now look at this.
[00:29:15.313 --> 00:29:22.635]  Kathleen Rice, another liberal representative, nuttier than a squirrel turd, tweets this out.
[00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:24.515]  I'm just going to say it.
[00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:26.676]  She's just, she's so, I'm just going to say it.
[00:29:29.497 --> 00:29:30.477]  I'm Kathleen Rice.
[00:29:31.257 --> 00:29:32.078]  I'm just going to say it.
[00:29:32.098 --> 00:29:33.458]  These people.
[00:29:34.438 --> 00:29:38.619]  NRA and Dana Lash are quickly becoming domestic security threats under President Trump.
[00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:39.620]  We can't ignore that.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.060]  Okay.
[00:29:41.652 --> 00:29:44.584]  I'm just gonna let the lunacy of that tweet speak for itself.
[00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:46.171]  But the irony is...
[00:29:47.694 --> 00:29:52.376]  Rice, this story comes from 2010 when she was still running for office.
[00:29:53.257 --> 00:29:59.680]  Rice admits to dabbling with pot, cocaine in her 20s and also has driven under the influence.
[00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:05.123]  I have nothing against Rice for doing whatever she wants in her personal time.
[00:30:05.543 --> 00:30:15.868]  It's just funny to me that she sits here and says that NRA members and Dana Lesh are domestic security threats when they've done nothing, have no criminal record, perfectly legal, but Rice
[00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:21.830]  Has actually had DUIs, which in the books is actually a domestic threat, and you will go to jail for.
[00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:23.151]  So, nice try.
[00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:28.714]  Another liberal failure, this time Kathleen Rice trying to take on Dana Lesh and the NRA.
[00:30:29.374 --> 00:30:30.274]  You know what that will be?
[00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:31.935]  An end to your political career.
[00:30:32.015 --> 00:30:34.836]  So, nice run for Kathleen Rice.
[00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:36.497]  You're going to be done next time you're up for election.
[00:30:36.857 --> 00:30:39.038]  How about the backfire that's going on with Google right now?
[00:30:39.418 --> 00:30:42.800]  Fired Google engineer James D'Amore defends anti-diversity memo.
[00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:44.553]  I really like this.
[00:30:45.013 --> 00:30:52.100]  I really like the fact that D'Amore is standing up for himself and not cow-toeing to this intimidation.
[00:30:52.881 --> 00:30:55.343]  He's a man with a message and he's going to stand by that message.
[00:30:55.824 --> 00:30:57.465]  And now Google is facing backlash.
[00:30:57.485 --> 00:31:00.929]  Google cancels all hands-on diversity meetings over safety concerns.
[00:31:06.457 --> 00:31:17.967]  So the triggered snowflakes, the safe space snowflakes, half of them transgender probably, are about to have their hands-on diversity meeting when there is nothing diverse about them.
[00:31:18.348 --> 00:31:21.971]  Well, I guess, you know, some of them chopped off one body part, another may have chopped off another.
[00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:23.533]  We'll leave that there.
[00:31:24.634 --> 00:31:28.618]  But they had to cancel their diversity meeting over safety concerns.
[00:31:30.686 --> 00:31:36.931]  Googlers are riding in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be outed publicly for asking a question in the town hall.
[00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:37.711]  You know what?
[00:31:37.912 --> 00:31:39.132]  First of all, this is madness.
[00:31:39.213 --> 00:31:40.073]  Y'all are insane.
[00:31:41.174 --> 00:31:41.975]  But how does it feel?
[00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:47.219]  Now you know how it feels to be a Latino Trump supporter and wear a Trump hat out in public.
[00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:48.940]  You might get beaten.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.981]  You might get hit with a beer bottle.
[00:31:51.622 --> 00:31:52.623]  You might get punched.
[00:31:53.303 --> 00:31:54.264]  So now you know how it feels.
[00:31:54.344 --> 00:32:07.651]  Even though your fears are completely irrelevant and non-existent, not real, based in no reality, well, now your fake fears actually might show you what it feels like to have people wanting to commit hate crimes against you, like Trump supporters do.
[00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:08.732]  You know, they just get shot.
[00:32:09.372 --> 00:32:10.213]  They just get killed.
[00:32:10.233 --> 00:32:13.054]  You know, don't worry about that though.
[00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:15.536]  Oh, and by the way, now Google just updated
[00:32:17.563 --> 00:32:22.606]  Their new user policies here, their new code of conduct on August 7th.
[00:32:23.406 --> 00:32:26.628]  August 7th, they just had to update their code of conduct.
[00:32:27.008 --> 00:32:28.489]  But the backlash doesn't stop!
[00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:34.792]  Now you've got someone plastering anti-Google ads outside Google's office criticizing CEO Sundar Parchai.
[00:32:35.692 --> 00:32:38.993]  Um, they compared it to Apple saying, think differently, Google.
[00:32:39.373 --> 00:32:40.574]  If you think differently, you're fired.
[00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:49.096]  You know, there's actually been an artist in California who's been doing, you know, libertarian, conservative-based propaganda art in California for a while.
[00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:50.737]  Now it looks like it's going viral.
[00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:53.417]  You know what, maybe I'm just gonna get it.
[00:32:53.437 --> 00:32:55.458]  I got Jesse Peterson joining me in the next segment.
[00:32:55.898 --> 00:33:01.480]  Folks, liberal snowflakes are sending out emails crying about how successful Trump's administration has been.
[00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:06.061]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:06.662 --> 00:33:07.982]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:33:08.222 --> 00:33:11.763]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:19.845]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:24.866]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:33:25.026 --> 00:33:30.488]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:33:30.848 --> 00:33:38.370]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:43.051]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:52.173]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:52.373 --> 00:33:55.594]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:33:55.914 --> 00:33:59.622]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:59.823 --> 00:34:01.146]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:05.367]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:05.527 --> 00:34:07.928]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:15.413]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:15.613 --> 00:34:25.839]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:33.805]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:34.086 --> 00:34:44.074]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:44.314 --> 00:34:46.095]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:46.356 --> 00:34:52.801]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:53.161 --> 00:34:54.282]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:54.602 --> 00:34:55.603]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:55.723 --> 00:34:58.584]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:58.624 --> 00:35:01.386]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:03.087]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:08.330]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:19.377]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:19.537 --> 00:35:24.459]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:27.100]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.661]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:28.861 --> 00:35:31.722]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:36.504]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:36.524 --> 00:35:42.766]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:48.089]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.889]  I'm taking it now.
[00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:49.630]  Every day.
[00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.571]  This is so key.
[00:35:50.811 --> 00:35:53.134]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:35:53.374 --> 00:35:55.116]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:57.239]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:57.359 --> 00:36:00.824]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:10.361]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:13.623]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:19.166]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:19.586 --> 00:36:25.549]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:25.689 --> 00:36:28.831]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:30.432]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:30.632 --> 00:36:34.776]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:34.976 --> 00:36:37.839]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:39.481]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:39.581 --> 00:36:42.764]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:43.044 --> 00:36:45.367]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:45.647 --> 00:36:46.608]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:49.411]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:50.192]  I take this.
[00:36:50.312 --> 00:36:51.993]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:52.114 --> 00:36:54.075]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:54.896 --> 00:36:55.678]  We fight the Globos.
[00:36:55.698 --> 00:36:56.539]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:56.859 --> 00:37:01.045]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:08.598 --> 00:37:15.341]  About to be joined here by Jesse Lee Peterson, one of the nicest men you could ever meet, who got bullied out of his gym for supporting Trump.
[00:37:15.802 --> 00:37:30.729]  But I am, I get, I'm in all of these liberal email chains like the ACLU and all these other groups that hate Trump, and they send out all their little propaganda emails, and I kind of monitor it to monitor the propaganda, have a good laugh every once in a while, and I just got a rich, hearty laugh out of this one.
[00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:34.010]  And I wanted to bring it to you today, just to show you how successful we are.
[00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:36.752]  It starts off like this from the ACLU.
[00:37:37.632 --> 00:37:47.877]  Owen, Trump's deportation machine is out of control, making millions of people too frightened to leave their homes, let alone live their lives.
[00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:51.459]  You know, first of all, this tells me two things, okay?
[00:37:51.799 --> 00:37:59.163]  One, obviously Trump is successful right now, cracking down on legal immigration, cracking down on securing the border, and that's freaking liberals out.
[00:37:59.203 --> 00:38:01.344]  The ACLU is pissed that we have a border now.
[00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:03.605]  So, successful there.
[00:38:03.805 --> 00:38:04.146]  But two,
[00:38:05.126 --> 00:38:06.526]  They don't even understand this logic.
[00:38:07.127 --> 00:38:13.449]  If somebody is in this country legally, if somebody immigrates to this country legally, why would they be in fear for their lives?
[00:38:13.689 --> 00:38:15.249]  Why would they be in fear to leave their house?
[00:38:15.489 --> 00:38:17.170]  Why would they be in fear to go to church?
[00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.110]  It's made up.
[00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.210]  It's bullcrap.
[00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.511]  Lawbreakers are afraid to leave their homes.
[00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:23.792]  Illegal immigrants are afraid to leave their homes.
[00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.192]  They broke the law.
[00:38:25.492 --> 00:38:26.453]  That's how it should be.
[00:38:27.913 --> 00:38:32.059]  I'm joined by Jesse Lee Peterson, who knows all about the loving, tolerant left.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.382]  In fact, Jesse, I couldn't believe it today.
[00:38:34.402 --> 00:38:36.926]  I saw your story that you put up on Twitter.
[00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:39.349]  You were so fired up, it's like you live in the Twilight Zone.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.481]  You get kicked out of your gym for being a Trump supporter.
[00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.021]  I couldn't believe this story.
[00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:45.722]  Tell the audience.
[00:38:46.742 --> 00:38:47.482]  I was stunned.
[00:38:47.582 --> 00:38:48.982]  I was shocked by it myself.
[00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:52.263]  I've been a member of Equinox for a long time.
[00:38:52.623 --> 00:38:55.784]  As a matter of fact, I was a member of Sports Club L.A.
[00:38:56.224 --> 00:38:59.365]  before Equinox bought Sports Club L.A.
[00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:01.586]  And so this happened in West
[00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:02.546]  We're good to go.
[00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:03.266]  We're good to go.
[00:39:03.306 --> 00:39:03.787]  We're good to go.
[00:39:03.807 --> 00:39:04.887]  We're good to go.
[00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:05.527]  We're good to go.
[00:39:05.547 --> 00:39:05.907]  We're good to go.
[00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:06.947]  We're good to go.
[00:39:07.087 --> 00:39:07.527]  We're good to go.
[00:39:07.547 --> 00:39:08.068]  We're good to go.
[00:39:08.088 --> 00:39:08.848]  We're good to go.
[00:39:08.868 --> 00:39:09.728]  We're good to go.
[00:39:09.748 --> 00:39:10.408]  We're good to go.
[00:39:10.528 --> 00:39:11.088]  We're good to go.
[00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:11.789]  We're good to go.
[00:39:11.809 --> 00:39:12.429]  We're good to go.
[00:39:12.449 --> 00:39:12.949]  We're good to go.
[00:39:13.029 --> 00:39:13.529]  We're good to go.
[00:39:13.549 --> 00:39:14.149]  We're good to go.
[00:39:14.169 --> 00:39:15.249]  We're good to go.
[00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:15.630]  We're good to go.
[00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.230]  We're good to go.
[00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.790]  We're good to go.
[00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.850]  We're good to go.
[00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:18.330]  We're good to go.
[00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:18.850]  We're good to go.
[00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.511]  We're good to go.
[00:39:19.531 --> 00:39:20.031]  We're good to go.
[00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:20.971]  We're good to go.
[00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:21.871]  We're good to go.
[00:39:21.911 --> 00:39:22.931]  We're good to go.
[00:39:22.951 --> 00:39:23.892]  We're good to go.
[00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:24.772]  We're good to go.
[00:39:24.812 --> 00:39:25.272]  We're good to go.
[00:39:25.292 --> 00:39:26.572]  We're good to go.
[00:39:26.772 --> 00:39:27.393]  We're good to go.
[00:39:27.413 --> 00:39:27.873]  We're good to go.
[00:39:27.953 --> 00:39:28.433]  We're good to go.
[00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:28.653]  We're
[00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:36.995]  And so I'm on my cell phone doing this interview with Bill and one of the employees came in and he said, you can't be here.
[00:39:37.015 --> 00:39:40.256]  And so I'm saying to him, hold on for a minute, just hold on.
[00:39:40.616 --> 00:39:42.496]  It's just a five or 10 minutes interview.
[00:39:42.936 --> 00:39:44.537]  And he was like, no, you can't be here.
[00:39:44.957 --> 00:39:47.337]  And so I'm getting the guy to hold on.
[00:39:47.477 --> 00:39:49.558]  And finally, he just stood there for a while.
[00:39:49.578 --> 00:39:54.979]  Next thing I knew, he went away and he came back with what he said was a manager, a guy by the name of Scott.
[00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.860]  And Scott said, you gotta get out of here.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.140]  You can't stay here.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.820]  I'm like, just for a minute.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.721]  At that time, I had about two minutes left in the interview or so.
[00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:05.802]  But he got up in my face.
[00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:07.462]  He was like, right in my face.
[00:40:07.522 --> 00:40:09.002]  He said, you gotta get out of here.
[00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:11.963]  And so they kind of forced me out of the room.
[00:40:12.423 --> 00:40:16.044]  And at that time, my cell dropped the interview.
[00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:18.745]  But just before I dropped,
[00:40:19.245 --> 00:40:23.930]  I said to the guy, because he was right in my face, I said, get the F out of my face.
[00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:26.253]  And that went over the airways itself.
[00:40:26.393 --> 00:40:28.355]  I didn't use the word F. I used the real word.
[00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:30.817]  And then I'm like, what is this all about?
[00:40:30.877 --> 00:40:32.599]  He's like, you're rude to the employee.
[00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:33.340]  You got to go.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.441]  You got to get out of here.
[00:40:34.862 --> 00:40:36.583]  You got to leave the gym right now.
[00:40:37.044 --> 00:40:39.026]  We're going to cancel your membership.
[00:40:39.346 --> 00:40:40.347]  You got to get out of here.
[00:40:40.367 --> 00:40:41.649]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:44.991]  And then I remember I said, get the F out of my face, right?
[00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:46.792]  So I said, oh, I shouldn't have said that to you.
[00:40:46.812 --> 00:40:47.512]  I apologize.
[00:40:47.552 --> 00:40:50.593]  Thinking that it just they were offended by that word.
[00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:52.815]  He's like, no, that's not enough.
[00:40:52.915 --> 00:40:53.895]  You're going to have to leave.
[00:40:53.935 --> 00:40:55.376]  We're going to cancel your membership.
[00:40:55.816 --> 00:40:56.697]  I said, I'm not leaving.
[00:40:56.717 --> 00:40:57.697]  You have to call the police.
[00:40:57.757 --> 00:40:58.818]  I'm not getting out of here.
[00:40:59.258 --> 00:41:03.600]  And so the one employee left to, I guess, call the police.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.981]  And the manager said to me,
[00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:13.630]  You said racism doesn't exist, and that blacks and Mexicans are not suffering due to racism, and you are Donald Trump.
[00:41:14.811 --> 00:41:16.012]  You support Donald Trump.
[00:41:16.573 --> 00:41:18.895]  And I'm like, oh, that's what this is all about?
[00:41:18.975 --> 00:41:21.178]  Because it was so ridiculous, man.
[00:41:21.638 --> 00:41:25.863]  I had no idea what it was about, but they had heard a portion of my interview.
[00:41:26.463 --> 00:41:32.789]  And he got upset because I am a 100% supporter of President Trump.
[00:41:33.209 --> 00:41:35.631]  And so we were just, I'm like, man, this doesn't make sense.
[00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:37.032]  You can't put me out of this, Jim.
[00:41:37.052 --> 00:41:38.113]  I haven't done anything.
[00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:39.915]  He's like, no, you got to go.
[00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:43.758]  We're going to call the police and we're canceling your membership.
[00:41:43.798 --> 00:41:49.823]  So I was bullied, harassed, and it was just, I mean, it was
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.641]  It was crazy.
[00:41:52.181 --> 00:41:53.803]  I had never seen anything like that.
[00:41:53.883 --> 00:41:58.808]  I've gone through a lot over the last 27 years, but that was mind-blowing for me.
[00:41:59.388 --> 00:42:09.839]  Boy, you know, I would think, listening to these liberals, that you would walk into a gym filled with Trump supporters and they would kick you out for being black, but no!
[00:42:10.259 --> 00:42:14.843]  You walk into a gym and you're a Trump supporter and they kick you out because you're a Trump supporter.
[00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:17.524]  You know, it's amazing to me to think about this.
[00:42:17.724 --> 00:42:20.405]  You know, imagine that you're anybody out there listening.
[00:42:20.425 --> 00:42:22.986]  You're at the gym and you're just taking a phone call.
[00:42:23.006 --> 00:42:24.407]  You're literally just talking to the phone.
[00:42:24.827 --> 00:42:28.949]  Can you imagine if an employee came up to you and wanted to interrupt your phone call?
[00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:32.010]  That's completely rude, regardless of what you're talking about.
[00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:49.199]  Now, you bring up the point that you went into this quiet room, people may not understand this, but when you work in media, when you work in radio, sometimes you have to do interviews on the go, sometimes you have to do interviews when you're not in a place that might be the best place to conduct an interview, but you find a place where you can talk on the phone and you step away for a second and you do it.
[00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:55.362]  So this is clear to me that for some reason, I don't know if you were targeted or if they knew you like Trump before this,
[00:42:55.942 --> 00:43:02.089]  But obviously they came after you specifically because you're a Trump supporter because it can't just be for being on a telephone call.
[00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:03.190]  Just think about that.
[00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.475]  They don't walk up to somebody on their phone at the gym and just start harassing them because they're on the phone.
[00:43:07.495 --> 00:43:08.176]  That doesn't happen.
[00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:09.291]  That's right.
[00:43:09.371 --> 00:43:21.297]  I can honestly tell you that I've been warned over and over and over again by some of the employees and some of the guys who I've made friends with who attend the gym that I cannot be talking about Donald Trump in the gym.
[00:43:21.377 --> 00:43:26.060]  It's a very liberal gym and they say you are not allowed to talk about Donald Trump.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:33.203]  And you know I've done interviews all over the place on Fox News and others and I have my own show on Newsmax TV.
[00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:41.066]  There are members of the gym who watch me and have listened to what I have to say, so they're always on me about Donald Trump.
[00:43:41.366 --> 00:43:54.290]  But I proudly stand up and defend the man, and I've been warned over and over again that I should cut that out because it's a liberal gym, and conservatives are not allowed to speak up like that in Equinox in West L.A.
[00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.451]  And let's be perfectly clear and look at this from the flip side.
[00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:01.192]  I'm sorry, this is just a fact.
[00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:02.992]  I'm not going to hear any other arguments on this.
[00:44:03.673 --> 00:44:17.597]  If it was a conservative Jim that had a Trump supporter as an employee, and somebody walked by and overheard some liberal talking on the phone about how much they worship Hillary Clinton and love Hillary Clinton or hate Donald Trump, there wouldn't even be an exchange.
[00:44:17.637 --> 00:44:18.397]  They would ignore it.
[00:44:18.437 --> 00:44:19.258]  They would walk away.
[00:44:19.298 --> 00:44:20.178]  It wouldn't bother them.
[00:44:20.978 --> 00:44:33.345]  It just, it amazes me not just how rude it is for someone to interrupt you on the phone, but that they would actually have the nerve to want to remove you from the gym permanently for your political beliefs!
[00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:36.187]  The two guys literally attacked me, man.
[00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:40.029]  They were right on me, just kind of, as a matter of trying to pushing me out.
[00:44:40.049 --> 00:44:46.313]  As a matter of fact, there was a back door to this little room I was in, and they're like, they opened this door and they're like, get out now!
[00:44:48.431 --> 00:44:49.452]  I was stunned.
[00:44:49.973 --> 00:44:51.215]  Jesse, I know that you're shocked.
[00:44:51.275 --> 00:44:52.457]  I know that you're shocked by this.
[00:44:52.517 --> 00:44:53.078]  What are you thinking?
[00:44:53.098 --> 00:44:54.260]  What's your response right now?
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.101]  You're still fired up.
[00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:58.667]  You haven't even changed out of your gym clothes yet.
[00:44:58.747 --> 00:45:00.450]  What are you thinking you're going to do about this?
[00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.652]  What actions are you going to take?
[00:45:02.492 --> 00:45:05.195]  You know, right now I'm just going to really expose them.
[00:45:05.975 --> 00:45:07.917]  I'm going to protest at the gym.
[00:45:08.318 --> 00:45:09.599]  We're going to hold a rally there.
[00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:12.221]  Because I'm the kind of guy I love what's right.
[00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:13.142]  I love my country.
[00:45:13.603 --> 00:45:17.546]  And I'm so glad that President Trump is there making America great again.
[00:45:17.967 --> 00:45:23.372]  I knew he would be president, man, when he first announced that he was going to run for president.
[00:45:23.812 --> 00:45:26.254]  And I've just been on cloud nine ever since.
[00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:29.255]  And I've never been the kind of guy that would be a coward.
[00:45:29.695 --> 00:45:32.897]  They have the right to say and do what they want.
[00:45:33.438 --> 00:45:35.139]  I have the right to do that as well.
[00:45:35.519 --> 00:45:44.024]  And I refuse to give in to these people that are against President Trump and against conservatives, and especially against black conservatives.
[00:45:44.364 --> 00:45:47.806]  So right now, what just happened today is I'm kind of stunned.
[00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.234]  I understand that and we got 60 seconds left.
[00:45:50.395 --> 00:45:53.627]  Tell me about how your life has been affected because of your support for Trump.
[00:45:54.637 --> 00:45:56.818]  I've been called Uncle Tom a sellout.
[00:45:57.238 --> 00:45:59.940]  I've had telephones banned.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.381]  I've been threatened.
[00:46:01.721 --> 00:46:05.243]  I've been threatened so much I think I'm in Beirut or somewhere.
[00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:14.447]  I've been threatened all because, even in my family memory, a whole lot of them don't like me because I support President Trump and they were for Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:14.827 --> 00:46:23.672]  It's been major, but I'm okay with that because I've learned not to take that, you know, all personal, but you can't sit back and allow that to happen.
[00:46:24.013 --> 00:46:27.699]  And what's the name of your YouTube channel where people can see your videos where you talk about this?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.509]  Yeah, they can go to JLPTalk.com or Jesse Lee Peterson.
[00:46:35.004 --> 00:46:36.485]  Jesse Lee Peterson won.
[00:46:36.865 --> 00:46:38.186]  Jesse Lee Peterson won.
[00:46:38.386 --> 00:46:40.187]  TheFallenState.tv.
[00:46:40.227 --> 00:46:46.711]  Now, Jesse, I know that this is not your tactics, but I've been telling you, the next time someone comes after you like that, say, racist!
[00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:47.631]  Racist!
[00:46:47.872 --> 00:46:48.892]  You hate black people!
[00:46:48.952 --> 00:46:52.554]  I'm telling you, spin it, spin their own argument, give them their own medicine against them.
[00:46:52.594 --> 00:46:57.157]  I think that they'll start to feel that Twilight Zone moment that you experienced today when they booted you from the gym.
[00:46:57.417 --> 00:46:58.378]  Jesse Lee Peterson, folks.
[00:46:58.398 --> 00:46:59.738]  That's a good idea, and I will do that.
[00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:00.519]  Thank you, Jesse.
[00:47:04.378 --> 00:47:09.160]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.421]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:16.803]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[00:47:17.163 --> 00:47:22.605]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:23.005 --> 00:47:29.587]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:31.368]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:32.228 --> 00:47:34.190]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.452]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:37.892 --> 00:47:41.515]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:41.715 --> 00:47:44.277]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:44.317 --> 00:47:56.666]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:56.886 --> 00:48:01.990]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.452]  It's bound.
[00:48:03.512 --> 00:48:04.733]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:09.717]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:09.937 --> 00:48:14.841]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:15.321 --> 00:48:20.226]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:20.306 --> 00:48:21.467]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:21.627 --> 00:48:24.209]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:25.029]  I don't know.
[00:48:47.196 --> 00:48:49.819]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:50.880]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:51.921]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:51.961 --> 00:48:52.561]  You must have it.
[00:48:52.922 --> 00:49:00.489]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.

[00:49:10.063 --> 00:49:21.003]  Well, because it is the final nightly news ever, or at least for the time being, as we are launching some new shows, decided to bring in an emotional Darren McQueen.
[00:49:22.406 --> 00:49:23.627]  It is sad, kind of.
[00:49:23.647 --> 00:49:24.127]  You know what though?
[00:49:24.147 --> 00:49:25.868]  Were you sad when you put the blooper reel together?
[00:49:26.189 --> 00:49:27.409]  The blooper reel was funny.
[00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:28.570]  You're going to see some good stuff.
[00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.412]  We're about to show you some bloopers from the past six years.
[00:49:32.033 --> 00:49:41.539]  InfoWars Nightly News started this month, six years ago, and there's still some of us that are left that were here from back in the day.
[00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:43.740]  It was Marcos Morales.
[00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:45.462]  Marcos is back there right now.
[00:49:45.562 --> 00:49:46.382]  Marcos is back there.
[00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:46.883]  There he is!
[00:49:47.783 --> 00:49:58.489]  And Rob Dew, our program director, our news director, and John Bowne were the surviving four from the original class of 2011.
[00:49:58.629 --> 00:49:59.310]  Yeah, the class of 2011.
[00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.311]  And, of course, Alex Jones.
[00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:04.072]  Alex Jones was with us, of course, as well.
[00:50:04.572 --> 00:50:07.574]  So what a long, strange trip it's been, Marcos.
[00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:09.195]  It sure has.
[00:50:09.395 --> 00:50:11.997]  I remember the first time I met you, actually.
[00:50:12.037 --> 00:50:16.139]  We were still testing out things for the... Yeah, Marcos and I got hired at the same time.
[00:50:16.719 --> 00:50:18.160]  Actually, I got you beat by a few days.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:18.601]  Two weeks.
[00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.304]  We hired another guy who didn't work out at all.
[00:50:22.484 --> 00:50:24.666]  And immediately, we're like, we need a guy.
[00:50:24.746 --> 00:50:26.027]  And he was like, I got this guy.
[00:50:26.787 --> 00:50:28.769]  And Darren came in.
[00:50:28.889 --> 00:50:31.151]  So Darren just squeaked in, huh?
[00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:31.711]  He was right.
[00:50:31.751 --> 00:50:36.175]  There was a short list and they had the wrong guy hire on the list.
[00:50:36.776 --> 00:50:37.656]  And Darren was in.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.222]  The thing is, I didn't know I was going to do graphics.
[00:50:42.463 --> 00:50:43.964]  I thought I was just going to do graphics.
[00:50:44.785 --> 00:50:45.025]  Right?
[00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:51.432]  And then all of a sudden they're like, here's a microphone, you get in front of the camera, and they sent me out to do a field report first day, right?
[00:50:51.712 --> 00:50:56.837]  Yeah, we were all working hard trying to develop the Nightly News to what we wanted it to be, and then...
[00:50:57.458 --> 00:51:00.060]  You know, this guy Darren McBreen walks in the door.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.641]  We shake hands.
[00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:02.982]  Hi, nice to meet you.
[00:51:03.302 --> 00:51:14.229]  And then he's out the door with a microphone and a camera and comes back a couple hours later sweating from the Texas heat in the middle of the summer with all these nice duds on so he looks good on camera.
[00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.693]  Turns out his own video at the end of the day and I was like, this guy works hard.
[00:51:19.953 --> 00:51:20.774]  I like that guy.
[00:51:21.354 --> 00:51:21.755]  I like him.
[00:51:22.555 --> 00:51:26.236]  And then we've, you know, and then we've gone out crew nights once you've got here.
[00:51:26.297 --> 00:51:28.397]  I mean, we are one big happy family here, folks.
[00:51:28.457 --> 00:51:32.259]  I mean, we do work together, we play together as well, and we go out and hang out after.
[00:51:32.279 --> 00:51:33.239]  Well, that's the thing, too.
[00:51:33.459 --> 00:51:39.682]  We obviously, you know, we realize it's a very serious operation here, and we take the future very seriously, and our
[00:51:40.342 --> 00:51:41.603]  That's true and I pride myself when I first got here.
[00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:57.470]  What's a nice way to put it?
[00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.551]  InfoWars was kind of B-budget as far as graphics when I first got here.
[00:52:01.591 --> 00:52:06.674]  So I said to compete with our, you know, with the mainstream media, we got to look legit.
[00:52:06.754 --> 00:52:12.676]  So we started putting fine-tuning the graphics and really putting some good-looking packages together and all that good stuff.
[00:52:12.736 --> 00:52:19.219]  But listen, folks, the bad news is this is the last Nightly News, InfoWars Nightly News for a while.
[00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:19.760]  We don't know.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.480]  We're going to be back.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:35.243]  Okay, but the good news is we're about to launch 10 hours straight every single day of live radio beginning with The Real News with David Knight and then the traditional Alex Jones Show followed by The War Room.
[00:52:35.363 --> 00:52:36.783]  The War Room!
[00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:38.244]  That's right, 10 hours straight.
[00:52:38.304 --> 00:52:45.865]  So Marcos, who's back there running the board for the Nightly News every night, he's going to be working, he's actually going to be working on The War Room with me.
[00:52:45.985 --> 00:52:49.006]  So now he's got to be doing three hours, three hours a day.
[00:52:49.046 --> 00:52:50.486]  And I'll be floating around, I'll be going
[00:52:50.486 --> 00:52:57.172]  Welcome to each show, so I'll appear on your show, night show, and yes, I'll go live, you know, so it's gonna be fun.
[00:52:57.352 --> 00:53:00.535]  People probably don't know, Darren, a lot of times, doesn't like to go live.
[00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:07.261]  A lot of it because Alex would be like, hey man, I want you to interview this guy live, and it's no big deal, just have a conversation.
[00:53:07.541 --> 00:53:08.562]  You're a perfectionist!
[00:53:08.642 --> 00:53:11.645]  It's about quantum physics, you know, just go talk to the guy.
[00:53:13.346 --> 00:53:17.469]  Meanwhile, he's working on a major graphic that Jones has been looking for.
[00:53:17.609 --> 00:53:21.132]  He's like, where's that graphic I'm trying to get from you?
[00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:22.954]  But I need you to go on air right now!
[00:53:24.315 --> 00:53:25.636]  And I'll be perfectly honest, too.
[00:53:25.656 --> 00:53:31.320]  The first video I ever shot for the InfoWars Nightly News, Marcos may remember that video.
[00:53:31.781 --> 00:53:35.984]  It was quite an adventure compared to shooting a segment for me nowadays.
[00:53:36.024 --> 00:53:36.885]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:53:37.365 --> 00:53:39.206]  Yeah, we've all gotten a little better.
[00:53:39.226 --> 00:53:41.247]  I'm glad we didn't pull bloopers from that one.
[00:53:41.267 --> 00:53:43.288]  It wasn't as bad as you think.
[00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:47.070]  We wanted to end this tonight on a good note, at least on a happy note.
[00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:50.692]  We've done a lot of very serious, groundbreaking news events.
[00:53:51.212 --> 00:53:58.556]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts, breaking all kinds of top news and everything.
[00:53:58.877 --> 00:54:03.079]  But this is the lighter side of InfoWars the past six years.
[00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:10.842]  And to be honest, we didn't get time to do Leanne McAdoo and a lot of these other people who have been there, but this is what we've got in the short time that we had to put it together.
[00:54:10.862 --> 00:54:14.264]  The blooper reel from the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:54:15.344 --> 00:54:19.606]  Tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, the U.S.
[00:54:19.746 --> 00:54:24.468]  Army admits that the, um, hmm, let me see, I lost my plate there.
[00:54:25.068 --> 00:54:26.149]  Oh, here it is.
[00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:32.951]  Can we bring in that microphone that makes my voice sound a little better?
[00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:34.391]  Yeah, that one.
[00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:36.532]  Let me see it.
[00:54:37.072 --> 00:54:37.612]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:54:37.892 --> 00:54:38.712]  Yeah, I want to use this one.
[00:54:39.532 --> 00:54:41.513]  Nah, it's just my voice sounds weird on that other one.
[00:54:41.533 --> 00:54:43.413]  Alright, here we go.
[00:54:44.434 --> 00:54:49.235]  Tonight, the Clinton body count resurfaces.
[00:54:52.376 --> 00:54:52.816]  Tonight,
[00:54:54.221 --> 00:54:58.582]  If I tried to suck an egg through a three-foot tube, would my lungs collapse?
[00:55:05.804 --> 00:55:10.666]  Also, if the Earth was flat and I took a sh** in a can, would it be round?
[00:55:14.307 --> 00:55:16.667]  The Earth is flat!
[00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:17.447]  Google it!
[00:55:17.828 --> 00:55:18.588]  Are you talking sh**?
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.141]  This dude's talking s**t, man.
[00:55:23.321 --> 00:55:24.161]  Whoa, hey!
[00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:25.602]  Wasn't that something?
[00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:26.182]  Damn!
[00:55:26.682 --> 00:55:27.663]  Come on.
[00:55:28.163 --> 00:55:29.283]  Come on.
[00:55:30.064 --> 00:55:34.886]  China's gonna let you dress up like Mary Poppins?
[00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:36.007]  No.
[00:55:36.707 --> 00:55:39.448]  China's gonna shoot you in the back of the head and blow your brains all over the place.
[00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:41.549]  Little stupid commie.
[00:55:41.889 --> 00:55:47.532]  He pits his strength, his courage, and his fabulous sun sword against the forces of evil.
[00:55:51.104 --> 00:55:52.986]  We are in the Matrices.
[00:55:53.566 --> 00:55:55.148]  We are in the Matrices.
[00:55:55.808 --> 00:55:57.830]  How you break free of the Matrices.
[00:55:58.391 --> 00:56:00.693]  This is how you break free of the Matrices.
[00:56:01.373 --> 00:56:03.155]  Are we really in a Matrices?
[00:56:04.196 --> 00:56:04.676]  Is that good?
[00:56:05.918 --> 00:56:08.320]  Matrices, Matrices, Matrices.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.621]  Darren hasn't died yet.
[00:56:09.761 --> 00:56:10.462]  Oh, Jesus!
[00:56:27.022 --> 00:56:31.945]  Obviously this behavior is only paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency.
[00:56:31.985 --> 00:56:38.188]  These guys are too f***ing stupid to know it.
[00:56:41.811 --> 00:56:46.133]  He was looking at you with that predatory scanning.
[00:56:47.054 --> 00:56:48.414]  Control.
[00:56:48.474 --> 00:56:50.516]  Manipulate scientific data.
[00:56:50.596 --> 00:56:51.116]  Takeover.
[00:56:51.176 --> 00:56:51.376]  Blast.
[00:56:51.396 --> 00:56:51.996]  Control.
[00:56:52.036 --> 00:56:52.657]  World government.
[00:56:57.145 --> 00:56:59.546]  He just... Look at this person.
[00:56:59.846 --> 00:57:02.267]  And you're like, I can see, and he's like, whoa!
[00:57:02.527 --> 00:57:03.207]  Whoa!
[00:57:03.487 --> 00:57:04.707]  Whoa!
[00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:05.668]  Whoa!
[00:57:05.788 --> 00:57:06.348]  No!
[00:57:06.588 --> 00:57:07.588]  I read alert!
[00:57:07.688 --> 00:57:08.849]  Read alert!
[00:57:08.869 --> 00:57:11.270]  Why is Russia... Am I Russian?
[00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.830]  I don't even understand.
[00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:15.711]  Is this a Russian... Yes, Putin.
[00:57:27.615 --> 00:57:34.498]  What do you say to that?
[00:57:34.638 --> 00:57:35.758]  It's a trap!
[00:57:36.138 --> 00:57:37.419]  What happened?
[00:57:37.479 --> 00:57:38.579]  Did we lose him?
[00:58:00.532 --> 00:58:01.334]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[00:58:01.354 --> 00:58:02.415]  It takes some focus.
[00:58:02.435 --> 00:58:03.998]  Up, up, and away!
[00:58:04.018 --> 00:58:04.799]  Info Wars!
[00:58:06.923 --> 00:58:08.406]  Info Wars!
[00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:47.092]  We're good.
