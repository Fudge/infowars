[00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:16.150]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.880]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:45.263]  So I might as well begin to put some action in my life.
[00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:50.494]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new national sport.
[00:00:51.408 --> 00:01:13.220]  is to have the big corporate media, along with all the major Fortune 500 corporations, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, all publicly concerted now, going out and bullying libertarians, conservatives, anyone with blonde hair, blue eyes, anyone who's white,
[00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:23.311]  This is a massive move of the Overton window into insanity, into malice-style revolution in their own words.
[00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:32.696]  Whether it's Uber, or whether it's banks, or whether it's other companies, or whether it's a flower shop, or Starbucks.
[00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:38.600]  You go in and they say, admit racism's a problem and white people are really evil.
[00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:40.741]  Literally.
[00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:42.442]  And if you don't say that,
[00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:46.569]  They then refuse you service.
[00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.457]  Remember Starbucks tried this about six months ago and it killed their stock 25% so they backed off for a while?
[00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:56.182]  I've got reports pouring in at InfoWars.com
[00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:05.440]  Where you go in a flower shop, or you go in a bakery, or you go anywhere, it's happening in Austin, and it's white people mainly.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.621]  They're bullying you.
[00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:17.023]  But if you're also a, quote, minority, they want you to announce it, like you're in a cult, and say you're in the solidarity to create a buzz on the street of total hysteria.
[00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.403]  And now, it's only intensified.
[00:02:19.423 --> 00:02:23.604]  I have epic, total proof of this.
[00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:27.365]  And by the way, CNN didn't accidentally release this.
[00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:43.165]  CNN is just putting out the teleprompter screed that they're projecting on these panel shows, most of which are staged, and it says, quote, ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:51.569]  And they're saying, see, you are in the KKK because you don't follow the exact political system of carbon taxes, global government.
[00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:59.059]  Then they cut to this piece and it says, CNN, blame President Trump for his tepid moral response.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.183]  Call the neo-Nazis and white nationalist thugs.
[00:03:02.763 --> 00:03:05.486]  Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:26.349]  They're telling you what you're supposed to do, and then my email, my wife's email, everyone I know, which is companies we use, we're realizing how globalist they are, because it's messages about the white supremacists are everywhere, they're deadly, we understand it, but don't worry, let's all work together, and let's report anyone, and let's refuse service to anybody.
[00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.051]  This is if you've used Uber!
[00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.414]  It's telling you to walk around like you're a college student,
[00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:41.389]  Fresh out of high school, showing up scared at college, and they go, get into this dormitory quick, there's white supremacists on campus, but we'll, we'll teach you, we'll protect you, this is your group.
[00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.649]  This is like cult kidnapping!
[00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.251]  This is like cult setting up, you know, new age cults at campuses.
[00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:52.432]  It's, that's what the government is, it's crazy!
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:03.623]  And then it coordinates with Facebook and Google and Twitter to make you feel like everyone's agreeing with you, and then by successive approximation you're put into a total cult bubble.
[00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:04.363]  And then this.
[00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:10.284]  It's on Infowars.com right now, Newswars.com, Steve Watson exclusive.
[00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.905]  From the ACLU themselves.
[00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:17.186]  They put out an image, put it on screen, of a little blonde-haired
[00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:20.725]  Boy or girl, you're not sure.
[00:04:21.325 --> 00:04:24.146]  And they've got an American flag and a little lion toy in their hand.
[00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:31.009]  And it talks about how the ACLU stands up for American values.
[00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:39.892]  They literally were hit with thousands of tweets and comments, even by media people saying, how insensitive, you racist, a blonde baby.
[00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:46.815]  And the ACLU apologized and removed it and said, thank you for teaching us.
[00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:48.496]  We are sorry.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.169]  And then the tweet responses are epic, with people going, good!
[00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.611]  We don't want to see white filth!
[00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:58.695]  We want to see shotguns in their heads!
[00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.717]  We want to see whites dead!
[00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:01.159]  And it's mainly white people.
[00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:02.241]  Oh my, dang it.
[00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:07.198]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:14.165]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:16.987]  So we're already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:18.088]  Tommy, welcome back.
[00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:18.709]  Hello, Paul.
[00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:19.410]  Thanks for having me.
[00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.110]  Good to have you back.
[00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.637]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terrorist
[00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.539]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:35.781]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:39.543]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[00:05:39.683 --> 00:05:46.647]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:54.211]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:57.176]  We see this every year.
[00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.458]  We see what's it called?
[00:05:58.478 --> 00:06:00.140]  The Ramadan Bombathon.
[00:06:02.082 --> 00:06:05.326]  Which you see the figures coming through daily and they excel.
[00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:13.076]  We see most attacks as instructed during the holy or unholy or very violent month of Ramadan.
[00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:24.734]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.058]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:34.520]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.602]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[00:06:37.902 --> 00:06:45.085]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:48.512]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[00:06:48.592 --> 00:06:52.315]  The details are, young Muslim men, they stopped a Muslim man.
[00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:53.436]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:54.436]  And he said, Muslim.
[00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:55.957]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:58.759]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.100]  So they left him.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.081]  They walked on.
[00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:02.221]  They stopped the next man.
[00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:03.342]  What religion are you?
[00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:04.203]  I'm Christian.
[00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:04.743]  Bang.
[00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:06.024]  They violently beat him.
[00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:07.285]  His girlfriend tried to stop him.
[00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.886]  These weren't just hate crimes where there's a group attacking a man.
[00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:12.588]  They're attacking men who are with their partners, with their girlfriends.
[00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:28.518]  If the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets, asking Muslims if they were Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously, that would be a national outrage as it is.
[00:07:28.858 --> 00:07:32.260]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section.
[00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:35.402]  And these guys, Tommy, they're going to be in jail.
[00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:36.883]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:43.970]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months, and no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:53.639]  Can anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because this is what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:56.102]  And when they say yes, they're all violently beaten.
[00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:56.662]  Could you imagine?
[00:07:57.323 --> 00:07:57.823]  Imagine!
[00:07:57.843 --> 00:08:02.328]  It wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.
[00:08:21.258 --> 00:08:27.342]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:29.284]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:31.925]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:33.747]  Welcome to another Global Transmission.
[00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:37.769]  I'm going to tell you about the big guests we've got, the huge breaking news.
[00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:45.394]  But the bottom line is the globalists now admit they're starting a civil war in this country, and we've entered a shocking new chapter.
[00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:58.279]  That if we're aware of what's happening, and like Judo, use their momentum and their action against us as a major time to separate ourselves financially more and more from the globalists.
[00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:10.123]  If we use their tools against them, we're going to have absolute, devastating, death-blow political and cultural victory.
[00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:26.890]  CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, USA Today are all announcing go out and bully everyday people, ask them if they voted for Trump, and then get in their face and tell them they're a white supremacist.
[00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.990]  Fire them!
[00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:29.171]  Remove them!
[00:09:32.213 --> 00:09:33.093]  Ostracize them!
[00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:36.255]  There's the CNN headline, white supremacist by default.
[00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:39.217]  How ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:42.399]  Oh my gosh, how the left brought in all the jihadi Muslims that
[00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:47.892]  Killed 30 times what died in Charlottesville in the last week.
[00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:52.834]  But that's just each knife attack, each car attack, just a blip on the radar.
[00:09:53.094 --> 00:09:54.354]  Don't even call it Islamic.
[00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:59.175]  Hell, CNN said maybe it's because of Charlottesville we see Islamic attacks.
[00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:00.956]  Maybe they're copying the conservatives.
[00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:05.397]  So this is a complete, full-on bullying operation.
[00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:11.719]  And I have stacks of articles here documenting it, where they actually say
[00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:16.922]  That you need to get out on the street and get in people's faces.
[00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:20.503]  Blame President Trump for his tepid moral response.
[00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:21.323]  This is CNN.
[00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:24.645]  Call the neo-Nazis and white nationalist thugs.
[00:10:25.005 --> 00:10:27.305]  Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:36.288]  It's not enough, CNN says, because the average person, quote, ordinary people elected Trump and they're responsible.
[00:10:36.348 --> 00:10:38.189]  See, oh, somebody dies from a gun?
[00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:39.790]  It's all gun owners' fault.
[00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:43.631]  Somebody runs over,
[00:10:45.137 --> 00:10:48.559]  A young woman in the middle of a melee where the police stand down?
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.101]  It is collectively your fault.
[00:10:51.161 --> 00:11:03.790]  This is hard core Soviet style policies and we've all got to buck this, weather this storm and become stronger through it and realize this is a corporate system of compliance.
[00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.052]  They say everybody be nice, everybody be sweet in business.
[00:11:07.612 --> 00:11:09.814]  You want everybody's business is how they sell this.
[00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:11.455]  Everybody be friendly.
[00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:42.351]  But then the globalists stimulate the pressure groups, the AstroTurf, to come in with super radical demands and then the corporations acquiesce to those demands and then act like it's normal for government and academia and churches to all acquiesce to the demands and suddenly you're the bad guy if you don't want to teach five-year-olds in kindergarten how to have anal sex or how to masturbate.
[00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:43.431]  That's what goes on.
[00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:47.156]  Now pedophilia, sexualization of children.
[00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:50.899]  If some guy did that in a park to your daughter, you'd get up and punch him in the nose.
[00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:53.801]  Some lady did that to your son in a park, you'd punch him in the nose.
[00:11:54.442 --> 00:11:55.983]  You'd call the police, they'd go to jail.
[00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:08.273]  But as long as it's done around openness and done around not being racist or sexist or as long as you're not a homophobe, then it's completely normalized.
[00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:11.783]  But what's not normal?
[00:12:11.883 --> 00:12:12.644]  Oh, the family.
[00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.545]  Don't say you have a mother and father.
[00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:17.528]  Use she or ye.
[00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:20.911]  And don't talk about male or female, because someone else might not be that.
[00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.093]  Now language itself's evil.
[00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:25.155]  You think, oh, well this is just craziness.
[00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:26.916]  They've gone off the reservation.
[00:12:26.976 --> 00:12:27.457]  They're nuts.
[00:12:27.757 --> 00:12:28.237]  No, they're not.
[00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:30.659]  It's a scientific plan.
[00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:34.623]  This is on Infowars.com right now.
[00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:37.165]  We're going to go over it more in detail, but I'm going to just mention it.
[00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:37.926]  Hysteria.
[00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:44.031]  Leftist triggered by ACLU tweeting photo of a white baby.
[00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:51.314]  Little white baby, boy, girl, you really can't tell.
[00:12:52.095 --> 00:12:53.015]  Nice blue sky.
[00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:57.497]  Talks about how the ACLU defends America's values of free speech.
[00:12:58.017 --> 00:13:03.860]  And they hit him back and they say, how insulting and insensitive a white person, a white supremacist,
[00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:06.855]  And they go, oh my God, you're right, we apologize.
[00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:08.276]  Thank you for correcting us.
[00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:09.517]  And they took it down.
[00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:11.559]  A white kid with a flag?
[00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:15.001]  And keep scrolling down.
[00:13:16.322 --> 00:13:20.205]  I'd rather have this future than it shows a black woman with a gun.
[00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:23.467]  But only a black woman with a gun.
[00:13:23.847 --> 00:13:27.029]  I actually thought someone retweeted a white genocide account onto my timeline.
[00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.793]  That's right, a little white kid with an American flag is not acceptable.
[00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:33.739]  Supporting Nazis!
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.960]  Then tweeting little blonde kids!
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.241]  Get your bleep together!
[00:13:38.181 --> 00:13:42.023]  Oh, yeah, supporting Nazis now to say that people have a right to free speech.
[00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:42.283]  See?
[00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.885]  That's why CNN had reports yesterday saying it's time to end free speech.
[00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:46.425]  That's right.
[00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:47.485]  Nazis.
[00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:49.326]  Yes, we must ban Nazis and end free speech.
[00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:54.108]  You need help if a picture of a small white child triggers you.
[00:13:54.488 --> 00:13:57.710]  Does it take a lot of energy to offend all the time?
[00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.915]  The reason there's an issue with this tweet, in context, the ACLU has recently been criticized for supporting white supremacists.
[00:14:04.975 --> 00:14:05.436]  That's right.
[00:14:05.856 --> 00:14:07.837]  For just saying, First Amendment's First Amendment.
[00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:09.559]  What, a blonde folk?
[00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:11.640]  I don't get this silly post.
[00:14:12.081 --> 00:14:15.664]  The future ACLU wants is a little blonde kid.
[00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:24.631]  And these are chip-on-the-shoulder minorities taught to be classically tribal, classically racist, with a bunch of other
[00:14:27.927 --> 00:14:31.070]  White allies tweeting, thousands of them.
[00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:36.395]  But the best part is, the ACLU said, thank you for showing us how to be better.
[00:14:36.455 --> 00:14:38.717]  You're right, what we did was wrong and insensitive.
[00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:51.750]  Just like the man named Robert Lee, who's Chinese, who was going to call a baseball game for the social engineering network ESPN.
[00:14:53.544 --> 00:14:56.525]  And they said, sorry, you basically can't work here anymore.
[00:14:56.945 --> 00:14:58.566]  Your name's Robert Lee.
[00:15:01.507 --> 00:15:04.348]  There are probably 30 million Chinese with the name Lee.
[00:15:04.828 --> 00:15:06.649]  Sorry folks, you're in trouble.
[00:15:06.669 --> 00:15:08.809]  Just like Lynch Hall being banned.
[00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.371]  Robert Lee, ESP under fire for taking announcer off UVA game.
[00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.972]  Then CNN can play the good cop, see in the Overton window.
[00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:20.514]  Look, they move it way over here to families are bad, mothers are bad.
[00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:24.357]  Everything's evil that's traditional.
[00:15:25.737 --> 00:15:26.558]  White kids are bad.
[00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:29.139]  But then over here, more reasonable.
[00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:32.080]  Oh, ESPN, you went a little too far.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.361]  He's an Asian man.
[00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:35.662]  He should be allowed to have the last name Lee.
[00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.403]  You know, let's be reasonable.
[00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:40.645]  Now, we understand you're trying to be good, but you're under fire for that.
[00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:41.765]  So, hmm.
[00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:46.887]  And the whole attention isn't gross domestic product, isn't literature, isn't math, isn't science.
[00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:49.229]  It's just, I saw something called Lynch.
[00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:50.869]  I saw something called Lee.
[00:15:50.969 --> 00:15:51.230]  Look!
[00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.050]  Look!
[00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:54.872]  Right here, it's a white baby!
[00:15:56.232 --> 00:15:57.213]  The insensitivity!
[00:15:57.233 --> 00:15:58.853]  Is this the FCC ban?
[00:15:59.113 --> 00:15:59.794]  Profanity?
[00:15:59.814 --> 00:16:04.956]  That's right, they want to legalize child porn.
[00:16:05.356 --> 00:16:08.137]  Nambla wants to be able to have access to your kids, and the UN agrees with it.
[00:16:08.457 --> 00:16:08.778]  But!
[00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:12.579]  A little white kid is obscene.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.722]  And you know, I ran into this some in Dallas when I was young, because I had blonde hair.
[00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:20.642]  It was good looking, and I had blue eyes.
[00:16:24.798 --> 00:16:29.702]  I would have like liberal white people say, are you a Nazi?
[00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:35.826]  And I'd be wearing like a Metallica shirt and blue jeans and cowboy boots and I'd say, excuse me?
[00:16:35.846 --> 00:16:39.589]  And I would always think it was like a joke or something.
[00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:48.516]  I remember being in a record store buying a cassette tape and I walked over and was buying it from the guy behind the counter who was kind of beatnik looking.
[00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:50.498]  So I was just an Americana guy.
[00:16:51.693 --> 00:16:55.976]  And he goes, I can't wait till this Nazi technology's been phased out and they come out with CDs.
[00:16:56.657 --> 00:16:57.458]  What do you think of Nazis?
[00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:03.522]  I was just like, yeah, I didn't really even know that Nazis invented tape.
[00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:07.525]  I thought tape got invented in a lot of places.
[00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.708]  Just like radio got invented in three different countries at the same time.
[00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:11.769]  I was like, are you kidding?
[00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:13.630]  He goes, oh, you know a lot about history!
[00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.054]  And it was just real nasty.
[00:17:18.634 --> 00:17:20.316]  And then I learned, that's his uniform.
[00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:23.129]  Braided beards, you know, dreadlocks.
[00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:23.829]  I didn't care.
[00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:24.650]  I didn't look down on him.
[00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.352]  I wasn't a bigot that he was a white guy who hated white people.
[00:17:30.474 --> 00:17:36.418]  I was just in there to buy my cassette tape of Van Halen or something.
[00:17:39.102 --> 00:17:42.683]  I learned at like 15, 16, something's going on.
[00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:47.884]  And then I went to college a couple years, and it didn't matter what class it was, they marched you in and said, whites are inherently evil.
[00:17:48.604 --> 00:17:56.126]  They'd hold up a picture of a person that looked like somebody from Egypt, and they'd say, this is going to be the perfect person when we're all just brown and there's no more white people.
[00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.207]  And it was always a white professor saying it.
[00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:12.870]  I had one math teacher that was a black lady who'd been a liberal and been to Africa, and I remember her not doing the propaganda and going, you hear a lot of bad stuff about America, but let me tell you, I've been to Africa, and it's bad, and what you hear with all this liberal stuff on campus isn't quite accurate.
[00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:24.897]  There was one lady that wasn't just, didn't matter where it was, just hammering us with brainwashing, and I was just like, I'm gonna go get a sales job, and I'm gonna go get into media, and I'm gonna do something about this.
[00:18:24.957 --> 00:18:25.778]  I said, I'm outta here.
[00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:37.855]  But then you read these articles and go over these stories and it's right there.
[00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:50.431]  I've got articles here where coffee shops, flower shops, florists, you go in and they say, we want you to denounce racism or we're going to refuse you service.
[00:18:52.927 --> 00:18:55.688]  Well, I mean, if somebody said that to me, I'd say, I'm not, what is this, a cult?
[00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:01.971]  I'm in here to get grandma or my wife flowers or get flowers for somebody that's been sick at work.
[00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:08.393]  I'm not here to bow down to you as some priest class that I've got to kiss your butt, kiss your ring.
[00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:12.795]  They're in a Chicago flower shop, refuses to do business with bigots, daily news.
[00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:17.817]  But what they're really doing is making first contact like a police officer or an interrogator.
[00:19:18.637 --> 00:19:20.238]  It's like a TSA verbal screening.
[00:19:22.967 --> 00:19:25.469]  See, oh, you won't bake a gay couple their cake.
[00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:26.269]  You get sued.
[00:19:26.529 --> 00:19:29.031]  The government gets behind that suit.
[00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:31.233]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:19:31.273 --> 00:19:32.534]  I think you should bake the cake.
[00:19:33.134 --> 00:19:45.002]  But, oh, we're going to refuse all of you service, and we're going to attack you in restaurants, we're going to spit on you on the street, and we're going to do it and scream Nazi at you when we're a bunch of thugs acting like Nazis, because it's time for us to have power!
[00:19:45.722 --> 00:19:46.983]  And this is our revolution!
[00:19:47.664 --> 00:19:49.065]  And we were supposed to have it with Hillary!
[00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:51.650]  And after all, the president's mentally ill.
[00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.590]  We told you that back on May.
[00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.151]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:57.572]  I hope he'll tell you, the inside baseball, how he learned it.
[00:19:57.912 --> 00:20:02.094]  Because he learned their new talking point would be Alzheimer's, and now it's everywhere.
[00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:02.554]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:05.250]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.812]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:15.298]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:25.807]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:33.690]  In the history of Infowars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:43.914]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:20:44.174 --> 00:20:46.095]  And this part is most important.

[00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:54.079]  That means it's clean.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.460]  That means it's pure.
[00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.403]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:20:58.503 --> 00:21:01.066]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:02.928]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:21:07.884 --> 00:21:10.965]  Well, he was the founder of Vice, syndicated radio TV host.
[00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:12.105]  Gavin McInnes is with us.
[00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:17.387]  He's got so many shows on so many platforms, I can't even go over it all, but he's compoundmedia.com.
[00:21:17.407 --> 00:21:19.288]  He's also, I guess, working with The Rebel.
[00:21:19.648 --> 00:21:21.309]  Twitter at Gavin underscore McInnes.
[00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:27.411]  And he joins us now, but he is a Swiss Army knife of intellectual ideas.
[00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:30.752]  So, let's front and center my maestro.
[00:21:32.185 --> 00:21:40.713]  Well, here's what I... I understand that politicians like Hillary, the DNC, I understand that they want to incentivize single moms.
[00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:45.277]  They want to shatter the black family so they can make more Americans dependent on them.
[00:21:45.517 --> 00:21:52.164]  What I'm obsessed with these days is how eager the populace is to assist these people.
[00:21:52.564 --> 00:21:56.488]  How eager they are to jump in bed with these people where they have no real gains.
[00:21:58.249 --> 00:21:58.890]  Exactly!
[00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:05.138]  If you're Roman soldiers taking over a town in Brittany and burning it, you get to rape the women, you get the gold.
[00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:07.520]  They're not even getting anything!
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.364]  They're screwing their own future, but it's VR.
[00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:12.166]  It's imaginary.
[00:22:13.144 --> 00:22:13.524]  Exactly.
[00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:18.846]  They're jumping next to the Roman soldiers and marching with them, saying, let's rape and pillage my town.
[00:22:19.386 --> 00:22:20.747]  And you go, well, that was easy.
[00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:23.727]  I mean, these people were thought policing ourselves.
[00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:29.629]  So the Gestapo, the Secret Service, they don't even have to show up for work to thought police us, because we'll do it.
[00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:31.250]  Like this Google Memo thing.
[00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.092]  That he was fired not just by the CEO, but by his peers.
[00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:39.054]  Forbes called it an anti-woman screed.
[00:22:39.995 --> 00:22:43.376]  You had Salon saying it confirms your worst fears.
[00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:49.760]  And they've just taken this fake narrative that he said women don't belong in the workforce, and they've exaggerated it.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.262]  I don't think any of the media has even read it.
[00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:58.510]  And he was also saying he saw the future and he saw that he was about to get penalized for being male, which is illegal.
[00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.573]  And he was saying, hey, company, I want us all to work together.
[00:23:01.593 --> 00:23:04.076]  Women are a huge asset to the workforce.
[00:23:04.396 --> 00:23:05.397]  Sexism is bad.
[00:23:05.457 --> 00:23:06.318]  Equality is good.
[00:23:06.338 --> 00:23:10.383]  However, do we really need to demand every single
[00:23:10.503 --> 00:23:13.085]  Because that's forcing women into a role.
[00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:13.706]  It's slavery.
[00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:16.187]  It's forcing them into the Foxconn factory in China.
[00:23:16.207 --> 00:23:16.908]  That's really what it is.
[00:23:30.198 --> 00:23:32.521]  Let's get George Costanza into the NBA.
[00:23:32.821 --> 00:23:35.744]  Let's get some short, fat Jewish guys playing NBA.
[00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:37.126]  The NBA is black.
[00:23:37.346 --> 00:23:37.846]  Sorry.
[00:23:38.427 --> 00:23:40.008]  The MLB is Hispanic.
[00:23:40.249 --> 00:23:40.709]  Sorry.
[00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:52.101]  I was about to say, I was an okay football player, but by the time I was a sophomore and they put me on varsity in a 5A team in Dallas, and huge black guys and white guys were running me over, I said, I quit.
[00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:53.742]  I have broken ribs.
[00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:55.343]  They're like, well, you did some good tackles.
[00:23:55.363 --> 00:23:56.664]  I'm like, dude, I'm done.
[00:23:57.024 --> 00:23:59.886]  And again, it wasn't like I was mad that most of the guys running over me were black.
[00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:01.367]  It was just that's the way it was.
[00:24:30.259 --> 00:24:47.408]  Even the KKK wouldn't complain about the ACLU tweeting out a little picture of a black child with an American flag.
[00:24:49.085 --> 00:24:56.009]  Even the KKK, but the mainline liberals say, you sent out a picture of a white child, this is insulting.
[00:24:56.349 --> 00:24:57.290]  And it's not satire!
[00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:06.435]  People asked Atlantic Monthly last week, they said, your article saying the total eclipse is racist, because it mainly hits white areas of the country?
[00:25:07.495 --> 00:25:08.316]  Are you joking?
[00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:10.217]  And they said, no, we're serious!
[00:25:12.346 --> 00:25:13.707]  And they said, well, you look like fools.
[00:25:13.787 --> 00:25:16.328]  And they go, you'll see, because they don't look like fools.
[00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:35.719]  They are getting a cult of people that literally think that... I was talking to a bartender years ago, and I even saw something about this in the news, that Negro Modelo was talking about changing their name, because Negro means black in Spanish, and it's dark beer.
[00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:36.400]  That's all it means.
[00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.852]  Just like, you know, you go to the store and it says black rum, you know, dark rum.
[00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:43.613]  Since something's dark doesn't mean it's against black people.
[00:25:43.633 --> 00:25:45.814]  It means it's the kind of rum I like.
[00:25:46.855 --> 00:25:56.760]  But the point is, is that, is that... I've even seen articles where they're like calling porno movies named chocolate this or whatever racist.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.641]  Well, the women, it's a nice term, chocolate.
[00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:04.624]  It's saying you're not allowed to have any language, period.
[00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:07.704]  It's mind control.
[00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:12.687]  It's absolute war on communication.
[00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:26.818]  And the best example of this is Robert Lee, an Asian-American at ESPN, who's worked there, it turns out, for close to a decade as an announcer.
[00:26:27.725 --> 00:26:28.586]  For sporting events?
[00:26:29.047 --> 00:26:33.815]  And they go, listen dude, we're pulling you because you may be triggering.
[00:26:34.536 --> 00:26:37.661]  Wow, that sounds like a mental asylum.
[00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.191]  Oh, and the media talks about Stephen Bannon and says, oh, he calls it a war.
[00:26:48.632 --> 00:26:49.872]  He calls it a war machine.
[00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:51.332]  And Alex Jones calls it Infowars.
[00:26:52.053 --> 00:26:54.754]  They're the ones that are in a war against us with lies.
[00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.174]  It is an Infowar.
[00:26:56.554 --> 00:26:57.935]  That's what the Pentagon calls it.
[00:26:58.995 --> 00:27:02.616]  And we need to wake up and realize they know they're lying.
[00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:04.417]  They know you're not racist.
[00:27:05.577 --> 00:27:07.038]  They know it's garbage.
[00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:23.155]  But they are projecting onto every single person in America this mental illness of having chips on our shoulders so we can all be put into different groups and controlled according to what color we are instead of what we actually stand for and do.
[00:27:23.655 --> 00:27:35.760]  They are overturning 180 degrees the work of Martin Luther King that said judge people by the character of their deeds and what they do, not what color they are.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.521]  And isn't that common sense?
[00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:42.628]  That I'll hire somebody if they're black, Hispanic, Asian, white.
[00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:46.730]  I don't care if they're smart and hardworking and got a good sense of humor.
[00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:54.053]  In fact, I like when I put my ads out to hire more quote minorities, but you know what a lot of them tell us in the emails back?
[00:27:54.453 --> 00:27:56.274]  They say, listen, I'm not working for you.
[00:27:56.995 --> 00:27:57.735]  You're a racist.
[00:28:01.428 --> 00:28:06.691]  You see, the real racist social engineers just cut them out of their future.
[00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:12.955]  And they're telling them, you can't be part of the Tea Party and low taxes and self-defense and prosperity because America is racist.
[00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:15.136]  Because capitalism is racist.
[00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:16.196]  Why?
[00:28:16.256 --> 00:28:22.180]  Because the globalist social engineers are billionaires and they control trillions and almost to a man.
[00:28:24.158 --> 00:28:41.448]  They have ganged up to take control of the economy, dumb the public down, make everybody be race-obsessed, while they steal the future, steal the technology, steal the money, and are tax-exempt, and then point their finger at what's left of the free market and the middle class and say, that's racist, repudiated!
[00:28:42.128 --> 00:28:44.029]  You don't have any part at 4th of July.
[00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:49.371]  You don't have any part in nice cars and swimming pools and good medical care and the right to religion.
[00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:56.473]  You don't have any part of that if you're Hispanic, even though you're going to be 70% of America in about 30 years.
[00:28:58.194 --> 00:28:58.934]  You had kids.
[00:28:59.794 --> 00:29:00.855]  You thought that was valuable.
[00:29:01.155 --> 00:29:02.375]  You thought life was valuable.
[00:29:02.655 --> 00:29:04.716]  You went out, you did that, and you're hardworking.
[00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:07.797]  On average, you're going to inherit America.
[00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:09.498]  You've already got America!
[00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:14.451]  They're trying to tell you, no, no, no, oh no, no, no, no.
[00:29:14.732 --> 00:29:15.772]  You want Venezuela.
[00:29:16.173 --> 00:29:17.894]  You want North Korea.
[00:29:18.574 --> 00:29:20.716]  You want a socialist failed state.
[00:29:22.617 --> 00:29:24.459]  You want what South Africa's turned into.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.641]  You want that, don't you?
[00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:49.760]  And they're telling the black people that, and boy, the black folks on average have bought it, and they're more poor, and they're more in prison, and they're more absolutely on the street, and the highest rates of everything you can imagine, illegitimacy, all because they signed on to the Democrats and overnight were destroyed, because it's by design.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.361]  Big news coming up.
[00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:51.901]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.762 --> 00:29:55.764]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.685 --> 00:29:59.486]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.689 --> 00:30:11.034]  Of the 30 plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, DNA Force is the flagship.
[00:30:11.394 --> 00:30:19.980]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought after ingredients.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:37.392]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.
[00:30:37.572 --> 00:30:46.177]  You can't lose when you support the InfoWar and get great products at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:48.858]  DNA Force is back in stock.

[00:30:54.141 --> 00:30:57.983]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:58.063 --> 00:31:01.725]  And again, thank you for making the InfoWar possible.
[00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:03.506]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:07.410]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.896]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:14.136 --> 00:31:17.119]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.463]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:20.683 --> 00:31:24.126]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:26.208]  The left controls culture.
[00:31:26.248 --> 00:31:27.229]  They control arts.
[00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:28.530]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:35.916]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:35.956 --> 00:31:38.378]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:31:38.858 --> 00:31:42.722]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:44.824]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:31:45.444 --> 00:31:50.831]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:31:51.091 --> 00:31:57.340]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.102]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:31:59.262 --> 00:32:00.444]  It's available right now.
[00:32:00.764 --> 00:32:02.967]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:08.270]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:41.399]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:52.021]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:55.642]  Now's the time to start naturally supporting your body.

[00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:02.523]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:13.586]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.694 --> 00:33:35.579]  I have a stack of CNN, MSNBC articles, London Independent stories, you name it, where the Democrats and the globalists and the Soros crowd have announced their plan for a revolution of hen-pecking and bullying at point-blank range.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:46.043]  Remember six months ago Starbucks said they were going to ask everybody if they were racist or if they were concerned about racism or to donate to Black Lives Matter or to say that they were sorry as a white person?
[00:33:46.903 --> 00:33:49.325]  That is re-education camp level brainwashing.
[00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:57.672]  Their stock took a close to 25% drop as people exited and basically ran as far as they could from Starbucks.
[00:33:58.113 --> 00:34:03.717]  But they're back now with flower shops and other businesses saying, are you a racist?
[00:34:03.737 --> 00:34:09.342]  Because if you are, we're not going to serve you if you're white coming in and it's white people doing it.
[00:34:09.562 --> 00:34:14.987]  And the ACLU has issued an apology for tweeting out an image of a white two-year-old.
[00:34:16.015 --> 00:34:17.316]  Talking about America's future.
[00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:18.758]  That was triggering.
[00:34:18.798 --> 00:34:19.519]  That was racist.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.561]  They have now apologized.
[00:34:21.822 --> 00:34:24.825]  But ladies and gentlemen, I have a way to defeat this.
[00:34:25.926 --> 00:34:28.709]  They're not the productive folks in the blue states.
[00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:30.511]  That's a scientific fact that's admitted.
[00:34:31.012 --> 00:34:34.416]  Geographically, 85% of the country is now Republican.
[00:34:35.563 --> 00:34:37.445]  We can take the entire country back.
[00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:47.035]  They know they're in crisis, so they're involved in a death row battle to overthrow free speech and have the mouse that roared intimidate the lion.
[00:34:48.076 --> 00:34:52.881]  The answer is, why are you buying stuff on Amazon when Bezos has sworn
[00:34:53.922 --> 00:34:59.005]  To overthrow the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, owns the Washington Post, lying about Trump, you name it.
[00:34:59.585 --> 00:35:02.146]  Why are you giving money to big corporations?
[00:35:02.827 --> 00:35:04.307]  Why are you supporting them?
[00:35:04.407 --> 00:35:08.890]  It's now time, folks, to brutally cut your cable off and let them know why you did.
[00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.291]  To brutally not go to the corporate hotels and let them know why.
[00:35:12.592 --> 00:35:14.473]  To brutally not go to Starbucks.
[00:35:14.493 --> 00:35:16.594]  To brutally stop buying on Amazon.
[00:35:16.934 --> 00:35:18.935]  We went off Amazon a few years ago because of this.
[00:35:20.694 --> 00:35:22.055]  They run massive scams.
[00:35:22.115 --> 00:35:22.996]  It's racketeering.
[00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:24.118]  It's organized crime.
[00:35:24.658 --> 00:35:27.461]  It is well-known monopoly activity.
[00:35:28.182 --> 00:35:29.043]  They're above the law.
[00:35:29.063 --> 00:35:31.545]  They get $1.48 every package of taxpayer money.
[00:35:31.946 --> 00:35:32.747]  Think about that!
[00:35:33.427 --> 00:35:34.568]  And they're killing Main Street.
[00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:36.310]  They're even killing the evil Walmart.
[00:35:36.571 --> 00:35:37.431]  They're so cancerous.
[00:35:38.444 --> 00:35:41.346]  That cancer is now dying because the bigger cancer is getting all the blood.
[00:35:41.926 --> 00:35:45.909]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't leftist stuff we're seeing.
[00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:53.654]  This is global corporate intimidation telling their people to go mega-aggro and physically attack folks.
[00:35:53.674 --> 00:35:58.137]  We've got videos of them beating up their own antifa because they look too white.
[00:35:58.577 --> 00:36:00.098]  And it's white people doing it.
[00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:07.704]  And they're in a hysteria, a crazed, out-of-control, Maoist freakout, which they admit in the literature
[00:36:08.664 --> 00:36:09.444]  They've been planning.
[00:36:10.125 --> 00:36:14.586]  So the answer to all of this is pulling out of it more and more.
[00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.527]  Pulling out of their schools.
[00:36:16.867 --> 00:36:18.207]  Pulling out of their public systems.
[00:36:18.247 --> 00:36:22.708]  Not sending your kids to get a worthless degree at these big colleges.
[00:36:22.748 --> 00:36:26.450]  So what if your wife was in a sorority or you were in whatever?
[00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.091]  You need to cut this cancer off now.
[00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:42.944]  And set your daughter up with an entrepreneurial business or something, and teach her how to own a lawnmower company, or a pool company, or a restaurant, or to go write a book.
[00:36:44.626 --> 00:36:45.727]  90% of the degrees are worthless.
[00:36:45.907 --> 00:36:46.848]  It's all a joke.
[00:36:47.168 --> 00:36:51.273]  You need to pull out of their system completely.
[00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.531]  Because there's no future if we don't.
[00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:56.952]  They're not going to coexist.
[00:36:56.992 --> 00:36:57.832]  They're not liberal.
[00:36:57.872 --> 00:36:58.792]  They're not tolerant.
[00:36:58.812 --> 00:37:00.973]  They're the opposite of Martin Luther King.
[00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:04.875]  And they have scientifically been induced to go insane.
[00:37:07.956 --> 00:37:11.857]  Now, let's look at DrudgeReport.com today.
[00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:14.539]  We also have these stories up on NewsWars.com.
[00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.119]  USA Today, page one.
[00:37:19.707 --> 00:37:23.769]  Debating Trump mental health becomes cottage industry.
[00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.352]  Why Dems can't capitalize on President's blunders.
[00:37:29.493 --> 00:37:35.376]  Trump taps Hulk as fitness guru.
[00:37:37.858 --> 00:37:45.342]  Now when you read through all this, I have a whole bunch of these videos where they say Trump has early onset of dementia.
[00:37:46.103 --> 00:37:47.644]  Trump is mentally ill.
[00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:51.758]  Trump needs to be removed from office.
[00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:57.103]  We need to implement the 25th Amendment on and on and on and on and on.
[00:37:57.644 --> 00:37:58.825]  Now, why is that important?
[00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:12.957]  Because we broke back in May of this year, in studio but also on the streets of Austin, doing a live feed, while Democrats drove by and said, F you.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:24.244]  In close to darkness, on the side of downtown, which is very cinematic, for some reason those videos get three times as many views, because we like to shoot stuff on the street at night.
[00:38:27.246 --> 00:38:34.889]  Roger Stone says, I've just gotten intel, and I don't know how much of this I can tell you, of where he got the source.
[00:38:36.454 --> 00:38:43.980]  He talks to people at major newspapers that are in editorial meetings, and they're in the meetings going, we don't think the Russian narrative is ever going to work.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.941]  It's going to play out.
[00:38:45.241 --> 00:38:47.183]  Our focus group showed nobody buys into it.
[00:38:47.463 --> 00:38:48.324]  Six, seven percent.
[00:38:48.965 --> 00:38:53.769]  But maybe we can get something criminal as part of the investigation, finding something somebody did wrong.
[00:38:53.969 --> 00:38:58.012]  That's why they've expanded the dragnet to all his customers, his renters, his businesses.
[00:38:58.072 --> 00:38:58.873]  It's pure harassment.
[00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:05.303]  And there's the Austin American Statesman that memorialized the fact that Roger Stone broke it.
[00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:06.524]  So, again, why do they call this fake news?
[00:39:06.564 --> 00:39:08.345]  We told you, uh, pardon was coming for Arpaio first.
[00:39:08.365 --> 00:39:10.086]  You know, here it's going to happen.
[00:39:30.974 --> 00:39:34.396]  Yes, it was gotten personally to Trump face-to-face.
[00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:38.458]  It was gotten Trump over a telephone call and it was then reinforced
[00:39:49.963 --> 00:39:52.244]  When he then saw it two days later on Drudge.
[00:39:52.544 --> 00:39:53.285]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:39:53.565 --> 00:40:02.209]  Yes, yes, the president is actually paying attention and learned that Arpaio, without a jury trial, was given at least six months in prison, maybe longer.
[00:40:04.872 --> 00:40:06.393]  But again, why do they call us fake news?
[00:40:06.453 --> 00:40:18.925]  Because I told you 20 years ago that Scientific Atlantic Cable Boxes had microphones listening to you, putting it into keyword aggregate software to then data mine the information, create an algorithm of your personality and sell the data.
[00:40:19.425 --> 00:40:21.087]  And the Time Warner Cable was involved.
[00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:23.969]  I was told that by one of their top engineers.
[00:40:26.031 --> 00:40:30.255]  20 years later, I think I can say a little bit more about the source, was an engineer in Time Warner.
[00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.152]  The guy drove a $300,000 black Bentley.
[00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:39.274]  I looked up who he was, it was true.
[00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:41.135]  He gave me the intel.
[00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:44.017]  Showed me the schematics, everything.
[00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:46.879]  But, I'm digressing.
[00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:53.423]  Then I had other whistleblowers come to me, former NSA, some of them public, who'd been in the NSA and exposed how it all worked.
[00:40:53.703 --> 00:41:02.709]  And I told you in 2005 and 2004 that Google was watching and listening to you over new smartphones, laptops, and your
[00:41:05.114 --> 00:41:05.755]  We're good to go.
[00:41:19.008 --> 00:41:25.552]  Because there was a specific press release to stockholders that listeners sent us.
[00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:27.874]  It wasn't public, but it wasn't secret.
[00:41:27.894 --> 00:41:39.162]  It was to stockholders of Google that they're pioneering listening to everyone in their houses over microphones and watching them to then give your dogs barking was the innocuous example.
[00:41:42.295 --> 00:41:46.199]  To make it sound okay to stockholders, oh, you're gonna make money, you know, first get the money class into it.
[00:41:46.399 --> 00:41:48.300]  We're watching and listening, but it's okay, you're gonna make money.
[00:41:48.481 --> 00:41:51.583]  Like if a dog barks, we'll know to put dog food ads up on the computer.
[00:41:54.926 --> 00:42:02.893]  It's like Count Dracula comes over and says, mind if I come in your house whenever I want, like if I see a window open, mind if I crawl up on your roof and close it, just to be friendly?
[00:42:02.913 --> 00:42:06.116]  By the way, your neck looks quite delicious this evening.
[00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:10.319]  You know, if I ever see your house on fire, mind if I have permission to come in?
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.982]  Oh, if you ever see my house on fire, come on in.
[00:42:12.002 --> 00:42:13.404]  They're like, oh, thank you for that.
[00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:18.531]  We just want to know if you've got a dog that are listening to you.
[00:42:18.612 --> 00:42:19.833]  It's a little puppy dog.
[00:42:19.893 --> 00:42:22.758]  It's the same way they see their psychopaths.
[00:42:23.078 --> 00:42:25.600]  Same way a creeper in a van, I have a puppy, I have a puppy.
[00:42:25.901 --> 00:42:27.522]  Same way, oh, we just want to know if they have a dog.
[00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:28.203]  We're listening to them.
[00:42:28.223 --> 00:42:29.784]  We're going to have dog food ads.
[00:42:29.824 --> 00:42:30.785]  It's all very innocuous.
[00:42:30.805 --> 00:42:32.707]  And of course, they will give you dog food ads.
[00:42:32.947 --> 00:42:33.688]  That is part of it.
[00:42:34.128 --> 00:42:40.454]  Part of the entire billions of things they're going to know about you to track your whole life with AI computers watching you.
[00:42:42.295 --> 00:42:45.458]  Maybe guardian angels don't exist in the real world spiritually.
[00:42:45.518 --> 00:42:46.119]  Maybe they don't.
[00:42:48.348 --> 00:42:48.909]  I know they do.
[00:42:48.969 --> 00:42:53.855]  The point is, these little babies... Guess I left my... My... It's not my phone.
[00:42:53.895 --> 00:42:54.756]  It's a smartphone.
[00:42:54.977 --> 00:42:55.497]  Little tracker.
[00:42:56.496 --> 00:43:02.418]  Little digital, little digital goblin that watches and listens and tracks everything I do.
[00:43:02.478 --> 00:43:03.959]  It's a little guardian devil.
[00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:09.701]  Yes, smartphones are, and smart meters and all this tech in your house they admit's watching, listening to you.
[00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:12.362]  And oh, hooked into the smart meter the city put on.
[00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:16.083]  It just so happens to scan all those frequencies and grab those and sell them.
[00:43:16.744 --> 00:43:19.845]  And there's a whole boom rush on that too.
[00:43:22.594 --> 00:43:26.335]  So, Roger Stone talks to 30, 40, 50 reporters a day.
[00:43:28.436 --> 00:43:29.536]  It's almost OCD.
[00:43:29.596 --> 00:43:34.097]  I mean, every time I'm at dinner with him or he's here at the office, he works with InfoWars now, he signed on.
[00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:37.138]  Got a contract with him.
[00:43:37.618 --> 00:43:40.899]  He just is on the phone with every reporter you can imagine.
[00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:48.241]  And he said, yeah, no, I have now talked to two different people that were in major editorial board meetings.
[00:43:50.043 --> 00:44:02.348]  And they said, first we're going to play out the Russian narrative, then we're going to say he's racist, which you now notice months later they're doing, and then we're going to say he's got Alzheimer's and dementia and is mentally ill.
[00:44:04.009 --> 00:44:08.011]  And they said, we believe that's what we can get the Republican establishment to go with.
[00:44:09.653 --> 00:44:11.574]  And then have some bill they're gonna pass to embarrass him.
[00:44:12.114 --> 00:44:12.815]  And I'm like, really?
[00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:13.015]  Yeah.
[00:44:13.035 --> 00:44:13.575]  And he's like, yeah.
[00:44:13.595 --> 00:44:21.539]  And he goes, and I recommend you start talking to the New York Times and the Washington Post and the CNN people and all these other newspapers and folks.
[00:44:21.979 --> 00:44:25.061]  He goes, and I recommend, you know, go to dinner with me and Jonathan Tillove.
[00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:26.782]  I mean, you know, he's not that bad.
[00:44:26.882 --> 00:44:31.584]  No, he's just basically there at my family trial, trying to hang me up at my toenails.
[00:44:32.244 --> 00:44:35.246]  But still, it's true that we got Jonathan Tillove.
[00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:38.069]  To put out an article.
[00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:39.191]  I mean, we didn't get him to.
[00:44:39.431 --> 00:44:40.633]  Stone met with him, I guess, after.
[00:44:41.054 --> 00:44:44.639]  And Tilloff wrote a big article about how we claim the next move is Alzheimer's.
[00:44:45.821 --> 00:44:47.103]  No, we didn't claim that.
[00:44:47.564 --> 00:44:49.006]  That's what they have in the hopper.
[00:44:52.754 --> 00:45:13.053]  Just like I told you, over and over and over and over again, they're planning a COG overthrow of the President, and planning a civil war, and planning the CIA to kill him, and that right before they do it, they're going to start announcing it on the news to normalize it, so that when it actually happens,
[00:45:14.994 --> 00:45:19.999]  So that when it actually goes down, everyone is normalized and thinks it's cool.
[00:45:20.819 --> 00:45:26.925]  And now I have stacks of news here where they say, get out on the street, ask people where they stand.
[00:45:30.216 --> 00:45:37.019]  That's just normal people everywhere who are blonde-haired, blue-eyed, or have short haircuts, are being stabbed, are being shot.
[00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:48.384]  Republican members of the legislatures, of governor's offices, of city councils, of county commissions, of Congress, Scalise, on and on and on.
[00:45:49.085 --> 00:45:51.386]  People walk up and they say, are those Republicans?
[00:45:52.366 --> 00:45:54.567]  And the greenskeeper goes, yeah, those are Republicans.
[00:45:54.587 --> 00:45:55.988]  And the guy walks up and starts shooting.
[00:45:57.048 --> 00:46:00.611]  Or a guy moves in, remember two weeks ago, he moves in next door and he says, who's my neighbor?
[00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:03.013]  Oh, that's the Republican City Council member.
[00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:03.413]  Really?
[00:46:05.515 --> 00:46:10.299]  In there watching CNN, in there watching MSNBC, walks over, shoots him twice in the head.
[00:46:13.922 --> 00:46:14.463]  And why not?
[00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:21.669]  CNN said, the headline's out today, all Trump voters are white supremacists by default.
[00:46:24.002 --> 00:46:25.483]  And you're like, call me a white supremacist!
[00:46:25.503 --> 00:46:26.063]  It's not true!
[00:46:26.303 --> 00:46:28.524]  You don't understand, they're saying, we're gonna kill you!
[00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:32.146]  We're running a Mao operation!
[00:46:32.626 --> 00:46:40.650]  I told you last year, and I've told you over and over again, I've been to these rallies all over the country, it's Mao, Red Guard, college students.
[00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:46.574]  And they drive Jaguars and Mercedes, and their parents work for Time Warner and CNN.
[00:46:47.867 --> 00:46:50.969]  And they believe they know they're devil worshippers.
[00:46:51.269 --> 00:46:52.890]  They know communism's all fake.
[00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:54.732]  They want to get a red takeover.
[00:46:54.932 --> 00:46:57.754]  They're going to be like communist generals, folks, running it.
[00:46:57.774 --> 00:47:04.939]  We're bringing Roger Stone on here in a minute, but here he is in May.
[00:47:07.233 --> 00:47:10.954]  Telling you from his sources what the next fake rollout will be.
[00:47:11.275 --> 00:47:14.476]  Then after that, he will tell you today what the next rollout will be after that.
[00:47:15.056 --> 00:47:19.838]  InfoWars, learn it years, months, or days before it's admitted officially.
[00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.558]  The opposite of fake news.
[00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:25.860]  The Sterling Whitehot fount of dedicated truth.
[00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:30.522]  Let's go to the Roger Stone clip from May 16th.
[00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.443]  There's a disclaimer right up front.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.561]  They're going to say that this is a conspiracy theory, but it's the stone cold truth.
[00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:50.905]  They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer's, and that it is progressive, and that is progressing, and that is the source of his insanity.
[00:47:51.805 --> 00:47:53.827]  I've talked to the President fairly recently.
[00:47:54.187 --> 00:47:55.668]  He is sharp as a tack.
[00:47:55.728 --> 00:47:59.951]  There is no evidence of any deterioration in his thought process.
[00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.253]  This is completely bogus.
[00:48:02.793 --> 00:48:13.081]  But under the 25th Amendment, if a majority of the Cabinet, plus the Vice President, agree that the President is incapacitated, well then he is removed.
[00:48:13.621 --> 00:48:23.189]  And if he seeks to fight the charges, it goes to the US House of Representatives, where erosion among Republicans could destroy the Trump presidency.
[00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:24.910]  This is bogus.
[00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.412]  They could not beat him at the ballot box.
[00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:32.256]  So now they seek to remove him by claiming that he's insane.
[00:48:32.796 --> 00:48:34.457]  Look at his record on the economy.
[00:48:34.718 --> 00:48:36.559]  Look at his appointment to the Supreme Court.
[00:48:36.799 --> 00:48:40.562]  Look at the way he has the Chinese doing our dirty work in North Korea.
[00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:42.384]  You will see he's not crazy.
[00:48:42.904 --> 00:48:43.604]  He's a genius.
[00:48:43.624 --> 00:48:45.806]  I was about to say, if that's insane, we need more of it.
[00:48:46.987 --> 00:48:48.207]  But this is the game plan.
[00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:49.568]  Watch carefully.
[00:48:49.888 --> 00:48:54.311]  You're going to see the word Alzheimer's more and more in the next several days.
[00:48:54.931 --> 00:49:00.014]  I've even been tipped off from leftists about this, that this is the game plan.
[00:49:00.535 --> 00:49:02.556]  You heard it first at InfoWars.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.941]  That's right, now it's all admitted.
[00:49:06.001 --> 00:49:08.063]  Roger Stone joins us right now.
[00:49:08.123 --> 00:49:12.406]  He's out in Los Angeles where they're looking at an Oscar for the Get Me Roger Stone.
[00:49:12.426 --> 00:49:16.049]  A lot of powerful stuff going on.
[00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:18.411]  I guess for Best Documentary of 2018 coming up.
[00:49:19.171 --> 00:49:21.513]  Roger, just a hellstorm of stuff going on.
[00:49:21.533 --> 00:49:23.655]  We've got to go to break here in just a moment.
[00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:25.296]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:25.996]  Here we have it.
[00:49:54.682 --> 00:49:58.123]  That the whole Russian gambit has failed.
[00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:11.452]  Denounces violence on the left or the right over racial matters.
[00:50:11.993 --> 00:50:13.534]  They're not satisfied with that.
[00:50:13.934 --> 00:50:16.696]  So now they're trying to say that he's crazy.
[00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:21.220]  CNN is particularly out of control here, Alex.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:30.026]  And the extraordinary thing is, and I think I can break this right now, Jeff Zucker is not long for this world at CNN.
[00:50:30.747 --> 00:50:34.449]  I am told that the executives at the highest levels of AT&T,
[00:50:35.612 --> 00:50:50.809]  Who are in the process of acquiring Time Warner, which owns CNN, are very dissatisfied with Zucker's performance at CNN and that he will be shown the door fairly shortly.
[00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:58.813]  Well, if CNN wanted 10 million viewers a night again, they would bring back Larry King, and they'd put you on, they'd put me on, but we don't need their platform.
[00:50:58.833 --> 00:50:59.334]  They're a joke.
[00:50:59.614 --> 00:51:00.254]  They can't, though.
[00:51:00.274 --> 00:51:01.475]  They can't give people what they want.
[00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:07.738]  Imagine a crossfire with Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and then a couple of the idiot Democrats.
[00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.258]  No one could look away.
[00:51:09.278 --> 00:51:12.240]  They'd have 10 million viewers first week, but it's not gonna happen.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.921]  Well, and what happened last night was quite extraordinary.
[00:51:16.182 --> 00:51:16.702]  Ed Martin,
[00:51:17.598 --> 00:51:28.464]  Uh, who has appeared here at InfoWars a number of times, an outstanding conservative activist, uh, who really ran the Trump campaign in Missouri, was up against, uh, five critics.
[00:51:29.104 --> 00:51:37.048]  Um, and when he had the audacity to come back at the brainless Ana Navarro, well, all heaven broke, broke loose.
[00:51:37.208 --> 00:51:42.871]  Anderson, uh, Cooper's supposed to be a moderator, but it was five on one.
[00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:46.333]  Today, CNN flew Martin to New York,
[00:51:47.102 --> 00:51:49.173]  I'll put him up in a very pricey hotel.
[00:51:49.912 --> 00:51:59.495]  And then canceled him when Ana Navarro went crying to management that he had the audacity to actually call her out on the air.
[00:52:00.215 --> 00:52:02.096]  This woman is unhinged.
[00:52:02.676 --> 00:52:03.496]  She really is.
[00:52:03.516 --> 00:52:07.477]  And she's the same person putting out the talking point that they issue these talking points.
[00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:10.078]  That the president has dementia.
[00:52:10.978 --> 00:52:11.919]  Does that have legs?
[00:52:12.039 --> 00:52:18.901]  And then what's the next, if you've talked to a lot of folks on the editorial boards of big papers, what's the next thing they're being told to get ready to make up?
[00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:24.104]  Well, the president is both mentally and physically sound.
[00:52:24.845 --> 00:52:31.689]  It's Anna Navarro who was fired by the Jeb Bush administration for lying about being an attorney and got caught.
[00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.351]  So who is she to talk about anybody?
[00:52:35.612 --> 00:52:43.958]  It's very clear that the predictions that you made, Alex, earlier about our heading towards absolute anarchy and an attempt
[00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:47.964]  To take the president out on the streets.
[00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:59.769]  In other words, we're going to have violent demonstrations and violence, which we saw in Charlottesville, which we're seeing at the hands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:00.209]  And we're
[00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:18.695]  Well that's exactly right.
[00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:21.036]  What this is really about, Alex, is the last election.
[00:53:43.809 --> 00:53:45.070]  They can't get over it.
[00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.692]  They will not accept the results of a fair, democratic election.
[00:53:50.092 --> 00:53:55.074]  And therefore, they seek to remove Donald Trump by any means necessary.
[00:53:55.574 --> 00:53:57.835]  They tried the electoral college.
[00:53:57.855 --> 00:53:59.496]  They tried the recount.
[00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:03.158]  They tried the Russia collusion delusion.
[00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:04.918]  These things have all failed.
[00:54:05.218 --> 00:54:09.500]  Now they're moving on to claiming that he's mentally unbalanced, that he has dementia.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.801]  That won't work either.
[00:54:11.661 --> 00:54:14.883]  The last stop on this subway is violence.
[00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:16.824]  That's where they're headed.
[00:54:17.344 --> 00:54:23.347]  When I predicted violence, of course, those on the left say, oh, Stone is advocating violence.
[00:54:23.367 --> 00:54:25.007]  No, I don't advocate violence.
[00:54:25.648 --> 00:54:35.532]  But I do not think, it's 1974, I do not think you're going to have a coup in this country and that patriotic Americans are going to sit there and stand for it.
[00:54:35.932 --> 00:54:39.314]  They're going to see it for what it is, an illegitimate
[00:54:40.066 --> 00:54:44.130]  Yeah, that's quite a picture of me that they have there.
[00:54:58.755 --> 00:55:00.096]  Far more handsome than that.
[00:55:01.497 --> 00:55:03.599]  But this is typical of the left.
[00:55:03.759 --> 00:55:17.351]  Look at the photo that Politico used the other day in covering the fact that I have been speaking at these pro-marijuana states' rights conferences, which my speeches have been very well received.
[00:55:17.811 --> 00:55:25.378]  But a small hand of agitators ginned up by David Brock and the people at Media Matters for America have staged a boycott.
[00:55:26.204 --> 00:55:30.045]  Of 75 speakers expected in L.A., three people dropped.
[00:55:30.525 --> 00:55:31.045]  Good riddance.
[00:55:31.165 --> 00:55:31.506]  That's right.
[00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:42.169]  They're pushing a no platforming for you, which means the end of free speech, which again, I have a stack of news here and a stack of clips where CNN, MSNBC, they're all saying it's time to end free speech.
[00:55:42.509 --> 00:55:44.869]  They're saying free speech is white supremacist.
[00:55:45.289 --> 00:55:50.131]  They even had the ACLU apologize and remove an image of a white child
[00:55:50.891 --> 00:55:58.219]  Because they said that that was white supremacist because the ACLU said yes, the dumb dumb white supremacists have a right to march.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:07.670]  So now the left is openly saying the ACLU are Nazis and the ACLU has apologized for showing a white baby in amongst other photos of children.
[00:56:08.868 --> 00:56:10.109]  Yeah, it's Kafka-esque.
[00:56:10.209 --> 00:56:13.851]  I mean, it really is Alice in Wonderland time in America.
[00:56:14.031 --> 00:56:28.501]  The left has gone completely insane over the fact that we have a million new jobs, that the stock market is reaching record levels, and in middle America, let me assure you, people are very pleased with the performance of Donald Trump.
[00:56:28.981 --> 00:56:35.405]  Now what the president must do is take the fight to the Congress, attack the Democrats and the Republicans.
[00:56:35.446 --> 00:56:35.646]  Yes!
[00:56:36.266 --> 00:56:42.613]  Yes, they're always trying to intimidate him, saying he won't be liked if he doesn't roll over, and he needs to stop tweeting and stop fighting.
[00:56:42.653 --> 00:56:43.454]  No, he needs to keep fighting.
[00:56:43.555 --> 00:56:48.340]  We're going to come back in 15 more minutes with Roger Stone, then we've got Anthony Sabato Jr.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.504]  running for Congress joining us, John Rappaport and more.
[00:56:51.724 --> 00:56:51.904]  Wow.
[00:56:52.665 --> 00:56:59.128]  We've got so much to get into here today, but just briefly, ladies and gentlemen, you make this broadcast possible.
[00:56:59.448 --> 00:57:02.109]  They are trying to shut us down seven ways this Sunday.
[00:57:02.389 --> 00:57:03.390]  They're coming after Stone.
[00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.270]  They're coming after me.
[00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:07.471]  They got a lot of folks rolling over in cowardice, even though we're winning.
[00:57:07.871 --> 00:57:08.952]  I'm never backing down.
[00:57:09.012 --> 00:57:09.832]  I'm never giving in.
[00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:12.794]  Now, we had to end that big month and a half long special.
[00:57:12.814 --> 00:57:13.354]  We were running.
[00:57:14.502 --> 00:57:18.364]  But we've got a lot of other new great specials at Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:18.724 --> 00:57:36.114]  You get free shipping on orders of $50 or more, so a lot of stuff becomes a lost leader, but we've never offered Super Male Vitality at 57% off, even though it's one of our top three bestsellers, and even though we only have probably a month's supply of it, that may be December until more comes in.
[00:57:36.535 --> 00:57:38.276]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:57:39.093 --> 00:57:45.640]  The amazing Concentrated Herbs, known for thousands of years to help vitality, stamina, you name it.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.882]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:57:47.202 --> 00:57:48.103]  Take it under the tongue.
[00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:50.265]  It's a concentrate of essential oils.
[00:57:50.606 --> 00:57:51.306]  Cold-pressed.
[00:57:51.767 --> 00:57:53.809]  The superfemale vitality is amazing as well.
[00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:55.391]  Game-changing formula.
[00:57:55.411 --> 00:57:56.132]  3,596 reviews.
[00:57:56.152 --> 00:57:56.592]  4.6 stars out of 5.
[00:58:01.324 --> 00:58:01.944]  Unheard of.
[00:58:02.184 --> 00:58:04.725]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:05.206 --> 00:58:14.069]  We've got deals on X2 we're keeping going, deals on Selenium we're keeping going, and we've got some deals on Caveman as well.
[00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:18.191]  But again, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:19.311 --> 00:58:23.933]  It is an act of resistance when you financially support us.
[00:58:24.193 --> 00:58:26.434]  Get the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:58:26.874 --> 00:58:28.154]  For children and for adults.
[00:58:28.174 --> 00:58:32.115]  We've got two different forms of great organic mouthwash with colloidal silver iodine and more.
[00:58:32.436 --> 00:58:33.296]  It's all there.
[00:58:33.316 --> 00:58:38.057]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.337 --> 00:58:39.918]  We are the defenders of free speech.
[00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:41.518]  The defenders of the republic.
[00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:43.999]  And we will not back down.
[00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:45.459]  We will not give in.
[00:58:45.899 --> 00:58:47.600]  We are full steam ahead.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.560]  Damn the maneuvers.
[00:58:49.921 --> 00:58:51.181]  We're going straight at them!
[00:58:53.596 --> 00:59:14.237]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Flyover America, an InfoWars original series where we're going to be traveling around the United States talking to Flyover America, the people who feel like they have had their voices ignored by their government, by the mainstream media, and by the people on the coast.
[00:59:14.677 --> 00:59:19.979]  So we're going to be talking to the deplorables, finding out why they actually supported Trump.
[00:59:20.299 --> 00:59:25.361]  So come along with us on this journey as we discover Flyover America.
[00:59:25.681 --> 00:59:32.384]  Throughout our travels, we will be making scheduled stops to talk with those who want to tell their story.
[00:59:32.884 --> 00:59:42.748]  Like us and follow our progress on Facebook at Flyover States of America for meeting locations, updates, and even sneak peeks.
[00:59:43.248 --> 00:59:46.770]  And if you have a story to tell, come tell it.
[00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:51.093]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Fly Over America.
[00:59:55.776 --> 01:00:01.679]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:16.304]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:17.225 --> 01:00:22.150]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.052 --> 01:00:26.693]  Wish I may, wish I might!
[01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:29.356]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[01:00:30.791 --> 01:00:33.972]  I mean look, we gave you the exclusive on the pardon.
[01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:38.413]  We gave you the exclusive on the Google droids watching and listening to you.
[01:00:38.893 --> 01:00:41.773]  We gave you the exclusive on their plan to overthrow Trump using COG.
[01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:44.274]  We gave you the exclusive on they're going to say he's mentally ill next.
[01:00:44.614 --> 01:00:46.614]  Because we're not just thinking this stuff up.
[01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:48.795]  We have the sources.
[01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:52.636]  And still this is a short segment, long segment coming up and you'll be gone.
[01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:53.796]  I know to go to your important meetings.
[01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:55.956]  What else is front and center on the radar?
[01:00:56.276 --> 01:00:57.517]  What does Trump need to do?
[01:00:57.557 --> 01:00:58.257]  Because it's clear.
[01:00:59.366 --> 01:01:01.227]  I'll get into this more in the next segment.
[01:01:10.157 --> 01:01:13.859]  It telegraphs their operatives that they have confidence that now launch the full assault.
[01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:24.465]  Everyone I know in corporate inboxes, from Uber, you name it, is, you know, Trump's a white supremacist, we must overthrow him, Nazis are everywhere, you know, get in their face.
[01:01:24.965 --> 01:01:29.727]  They're telling businesses from Starbucks to flower shops, ask people if they're racist.
[01:01:30.328 --> 01:01:33.069]  You've seen hysteria on the street where they try to attack you everywhere.
[01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:37.672]  I mean, they have activated their people into a type of hen-pecking, weird,
[01:01:38.652 --> 01:01:40.214]  Temper tantrum revolution.
[01:01:40.634 --> 01:01:41.975]  I don't think it's going to go well.
[01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:43.737]  I mean, Hitler dropped bombs on England.
[01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:46.619]  It turned the people for the war from being against it.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.643]  And I think these globalists and their minions are such cowards, they don't understand.
[01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:56.529]  All this intimidation just gave me way more energy, made me commit to just absolute total resistance.
[01:01:58.058 --> 01:02:04.085]  Alex, I don't think the people of middle America who support this president are going to stand for some kind of coup.
[01:02:04.706 --> 01:02:13.776]  Of course, the president has an obligation to restore order in the events that there is a mass insurrection against constitutional government.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.521]  The left has whipped themselves into a frenzy because everything they have tried has failed.
[01:02:21.881 --> 01:02:25.022]  They were able to use Watergate to take Nixon out.
[01:02:25.482 --> 01:02:27.922]  They were able to murder John F. Kennedy.
[01:02:27.962 --> 01:02:32.623]  When I say they, you know, the establishment, the deep state.
[01:02:32.643 --> 01:02:37.304]  I think Eisenhower called it the military-industrial complex.
[01:02:38.024 --> 01:02:42.525]  None of their standard operating procedures are working with this president.
[01:02:43.254 --> 01:02:48.899]  And the reason for that is because we have a vibrant and robust alternative media.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:54.884]  When people get sick of the lies on CNN, they can go to InfoWars to find out the truth.
[01:02:55.625 --> 01:03:09.837]  That's why the tech left is working overtime to try to censor us, to try to use the manipulation of our algorithms and a dozen other computer tricks to try to end our reach so that we can
[01:03:10.798 --> 01:03:12.079]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[01:03:12.139 --> 01:03:13.599]  They're launching everything now.
[01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:15.700]  The censorship's gone up 500-fold.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.781]  The physical attacks, 500-fold.
[01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:24.903]  The bullying, the freaking out, the rhetoric with CIA high-level folks saying we're going to kill Trump on television.
[01:03:25.403 --> 01:03:30.665]  They're canvassing Congress about who's going to go along with them, throwing them in a mental institution.
[01:03:30.885 --> 01:03:32.085]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:36.167]  The single most important thing the president could do right now
[01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:50.022]  Is to take the FISA court warrant that proves the mass-based illegal unconstitutional spying on at least 30,000 Americans and tell Jeff Sessions to bring an immediate criminal indictment against Brennan,
[01:03:51.679 --> 01:03:56.161]  Rogers, Jarrett, Rice, et al.
[01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:59.762]  That would cut right to the heart of the guts of the state.
[01:03:59.862 --> 01:04:01.223]  He's got to go on the offense.
[01:04:01.263 --> 01:04:06.124]  And we're seeing some signals with Sessions, with the Awan brothers indicted for espionage against the Republic.
[01:04:06.424 --> 01:04:07.165]  The word is Schultz.
[01:04:07.605 --> 01:04:08.625]  The indictments are ready.
[01:04:09.205 --> 01:04:10.906]  We're seeing other criminal investigations.
[01:04:10.926 --> 01:04:12.026]  The Clintons go into high gear.
[01:04:12.407 --> 01:04:15.008]  I think the President must move now for the Republic.
[01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:18.969]  You know the most fundamental and important of Stone's rules.
[01:04:19.628 --> 01:04:21.469]  You never win on defense.
[01:04:22.089 --> 01:04:33.053]  The President must go on offense against both parties in Congress, go on offense against the Deep State, and begin the prosecution of those who violated our civil liberties under Obama.
[01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:43.576]  While he still has the backing of the military, because they're openly in the news, shopping the military to go along with the coup, they're waiting to take his support away when they plunge the economy.
[01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:48.398]  He's got to move first so they can't blow the economy and complete the takeover of the country.
[01:04:48.598 --> 01:04:51.200]  The country has been invaded by globalist forces.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.962]  These are alien outside forces.
[01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:56.124]  The president must move militarily.
[01:04:56.485 --> 01:04:57.625]  I believe outside of the courts.
[01:04:57.665 --> 01:04:58.426]  We cannot wait.
[01:04:58.746 --> 01:05:00.268]  Military action now!
[01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:07.183]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[01:05:07.223 --> 01:05:08.624]  He's been traveling the world.
[01:05:08.644 --> 01:05:11.225]  They've had arrest warrants out for him.
[01:05:11.265 --> 01:05:13.906]  They want him arrested here in the United States.
[01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:22.630]  The governor of New York wants him arrested because he dare questions Al Gore when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying and can't swim.
[01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:24.671]  New York and L.A.
[01:05:24.711 --> 01:05:27.974]  would be underwater by 2013 because the ice caps were going to melt.
[01:05:28.095 --> 01:05:29.756]  Actually, Antarctic's at record levels.
[01:05:30.157 --> 01:05:32.919]  But they don't care because they can defraud the public.
[01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:37.664]  But recently, in Australia, he ran into Albert Gore.
[01:05:38.124 --> 01:05:41.307]  The guy that told us NAFTA and GATT was great and wanted us to have the TPP.
[01:05:41.628 --> 01:05:45.732]  The guy who uses 34 times what anybody, you know, uses on average in Tennessee.
[01:05:46.272 --> 01:05:54.520]  At one of his gigantor mansions on a lake with gigantor boats and gigantor monster trucks and gigantor everything.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.283]  But it's okay, because he's an elitist blubberbot.
[01:05:58.603 --> 01:06:04.108]  So here is the evil criminal, Mark Moreno, daring to even speak to the guru.
[01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:04.609]  Here it is.
[01:06:08.413 --> 01:06:13.876]  Oh, nice to see you.
[01:06:14.116 --> 01:06:22.000]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:22.640]  Oh.
[01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:23.221]  Hi.
[01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:25.402]  Can I ask how you got in here?
[01:06:25.962 --> 01:06:27.463]  We've got double scum with us here.
[01:06:27.503 --> 01:06:29.384]  They dare talk to one of the greatest con artists on earth.
[01:06:29.464 --> 01:06:33.006]  How dare you speak to the royal highness?
[01:06:33.806 --> 01:06:35.747]  You're not fit to groom his stool!
[01:06:36.047 --> 01:06:41.129]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, what do you say for yourself?
[01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:44.191]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:55.776]  Yes, I was in Australia, we were in Melbourne, Australia, and I had to sit through an hour and a half presentation by Al Gore previewing his new sequel, number one.
[01:06:55.816 --> 01:07:01.398]  Number two, we had to wait because Al Gore's devious plan included allowing the
[01:07:01.598 --> 01:07:02.098]  I don't know.
[01:07:17.689 --> 01:07:23.491]  Al Gore gives this presentation that's all anecdotal, just claptrap, and then immediately walks off the stage.
[01:07:23.531 --> 01:07:28.153]  He doesn't even take a single question after people pay $500 plus a head.
[01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:32.235]  He had no time for question and answer, so that's why I decided to follow him out.
[01:07:32.535 --> 01:07:33.436]  Was able to get that.
[01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:36.457]  He was all friendly when he thought I was nice, when he knew who I was.
[01:07:36.877 --> 01:07:44.020]  He literally just brushed me off, kept walking, and departed in his Lexus waiting SUV outside in the parking garage.
[01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:47.484]  And I love how there's some redhead lady toting behind.
[01:07:47.844 --> 01:07:50.485]  She's looking at him, breathing heavy, that she's just near him.
[01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:53.607]  The guru!
[01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:55.708]  I saw him sneeze!
[01:07:55.768 --> 01:07:58.109]  Some of his snot went in my mouth!
[01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:09.675]  And then she looks at you just like... Well, Roger Stone's only got a few more minutes with us.
[01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.597]  Big fancy pants out there in Los Angeles.
[01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:15.666]  Woo!
[01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:17.628]  Love it.
[01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:22.252]  I've had the Seinfeld producers tell me they want me to do a TV show with them.
[01:08:22.312 --> 01:08:23.834]  Shouldn't hold their breath.
[01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.106]  The coolest thing?
[01:08:30.507 --> 01:08:32.008]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:32.028 --> 01:08:33.408]  I used to piss in the face of all that.
[01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.930]  But we'll see.
[01:08:37.451 --> 01:08:46.796]  You see, they're launching a new Comedy Central show, five nights a week, based on me, where a guy plays me, and then says horrible racist stuff, so people want to kill me on the street.
[01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:48.451]  What scum!
[01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:50.313]  We're going to play a trailer for that coming up.
[01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.934]  No, but Roger's doing an amazing job.
[01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.416]  You were getting into the serious stuff.
[01:08:53.456 --> 01:08:57.680]  Great job on the film, Get Me Roger Stone, and I think it does deserve an Oscar.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.803]  I can hardly watch documentaries these days, and it is riveting.
[01:09:01.123 --> 01:09:05.287]  So he's out there doing some important work, and he's going to be spending a week a month with us here in the ATX.
[01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.109]  But finishing up, Roger...
[01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:14.058]  We have massive civil war they're launching, the admission that they're saying they think he's mentally ill, they want to militarily overthrow him.
[01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:17.963]  You told TMZ when you got off the airplane yesterday in LA, you said, look...
[01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:20.163]  We'll play the clip after you're gone.
[01:09:20.663 --> 01:09:25.106]  You said, look, I'm out for violence, but if they overthrow him, America's not putting up with it.
[01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:31.690]  It's not like where you punch us in the face like Antifa, and then somebody fights back, and you go, oh my God, you fought back against Antifa?
[01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.432]  They're the white knights that no one's allowed to fight back against.
[01:09:34.512 --> 01:09:36.833]  I mean, this is crazy how entitled they are.
[01:09:37.074 --> 01:09:45.919]  You can see them with the censorship, everything mounting, their campaigns for rioting, that they're building towards a crescendo, and they admit they're building towards a crescendo to remove him.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.141]  What's your intel on how that may look?
[01:09:48.721 --> 01:09:50.563]  What do you think is going to happen if they try it?
[01:09:50.763 --> 01:09:57.611]  I believe it's going to blow up spectacularly and take the Democratic Party from a dying coastal party to basically an outlawed party.
[01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:02.717]  And when I say Trump should use the military against these people, they're on TV saying, kill Trump!
[01:10:03.905 --> 01:10:05.746]  They're on TV saying, we're the CIA.
[01:10:05.966 --> 01:10:07.346]  We're going to kill him soon.
[01:10:07.686 --> 01:10:09.487]  We're organizing a coup outside of law.
[01:10:09.507 --> 01:10:11.808]  They've got Brennan and Clapper all saying it.
[01:10:12.028 --> 01:10:16.169]  So that's outside of law, preparing a coup in America.
[01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:20.450]  You strike back against that with the national security apparatus.
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:23.391]  I'm not calling for the seven days in May.
[01:10:23.671 --> 01:10:25.772]  I'm calling to stop the seven days in May.
[01:10:26.532 --> 01:10:27.012]  Literally.
[01:10:27.072 --> 01:10:28.813]  So what do you say in closing, Roger Stone?
[01:10:29.656 --> 01:10:33.879]  Yeah, I think you have to remember, Alex, that the president is the head of government.
[01:10:33.959 --> 01:10:35.139]  He is not a candidate.
[01:10:35.219 --> 01:10:37.120]  He's the president of the United States.
[01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:42.003]  A move against him is therefore an illegal and unconstitutional move.
[01:10:42.444 --> 01:10:47.947]  He would have the right to order the military to put down mass insurrection in the country.
[01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:54.371]  I believe most police officers in this country would remain loyal to the president.
[01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:58.361]  We are not the ones advocating violence.
[01:10:58.582 --> 01:11:02.046]  We are not the ones who are rationalizing violence.
[01:11:02.206 --> 01:11:03.748]  We are anti-violence.
[01:11:04.088 --> 01:11:14.981]  What I told TMZ was, however, that if there is an illegitimate, unconstitutional move to remove this president, it's going to be met with violence from those in middle America
[01:11:15.601 --> 01:11:29.587]  Who no longer have to depend on CNN and CBS to find out what's going on, who can find out what's going on by coming right here to InfoWars or go to Breitbart or Daily Caller or any number of other places that will tell you the truth.
[01:11:29.908 --> 01:11:32.709]  And those people will be mobilized.
[01:11:33.009 --> 01:11:34.410]  Of that, there is no doubt.
[01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:42.493]  In the next 24 hours, you're going to hear over and over again, Roger Stone advocated violence if Trump is impeached.
[01:11:43.073 --> 01:11:44.214]  Not what I said.
[01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.175]  Listen to the whole tape, not what I said.
[01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.842]  What's the next attack on him after that?
[01:11:51.022 --> 01:11:55.090]  And again, just clearly, do you agree with me they're building towards the big event?
[01:11:56.448 --> 01:11:57.288]  There's no question.
[01:11:57.469 --> 01:12:02.111]  My sources like yours tell me that violence is the next event.
[01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.852]  They predicted this before Charlottesville.
[01:12:05.412 --> 01:12:08.834]  We now know that Charlottesville was a fraud.
[01:12:09.414 --> 01:12:17.898]  The guy who ran the entire operation, the top white supremacist, well, it turns out that he was working for Hillary a year and a half ago.
[01:12:17.978 --> 01:12:20.860]  Pardon me, for Obama a year and a half ago.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.142]  So I think the fraud of Charlottesville has now been exposed.
[01:12:25.899 --> 01:12:30.222]  I expect, Alex, to answer your question directly, there will be more false flags.
[01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:37.768]  There will be more agitprop set up to foment violence and then blame that violence on Donald Trump.
[01:12:39.009 --> 01:12:44.893]  That's exactly what happened in Charlottesville, and I expect there will be other Charlottesvilles shortly.
[01:12:45.313 --> 01:12:52.078]  I expect Oklahoma City's federal building with a nursery in, blow it up, claim a Trump supporter did it, try to pin it on the president.
[01:12:52.459 --> 01:12:54.020]  None of us are going to buy that.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.522]  And we're ready for it, and we know it.
[01:12:56.562 --> 01:12:58.543]  We knew that Soros was fighting the Summer of Rage.
[01:12:59.004 --> 01:13:00.045]  They finally got their event.
[01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.246]  They've been calling for all this violence.
[01:13:01.486 --> 01:13:07.131]  They finally get some violence to then brand us for the coming civil war, which they have lit the fuse on.
[01:13:07.491 --> 01:13:09.253]  But the truth is, we're here fighting it.
[01:13:09.313 --> 01:13:10.333]  Our listeners are fighting it.
[01:13:10.634 --> 01:13:11.454]  And we're going to win.
[01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:13.416]  And we have the beachhead of the president now.
[01:13:13.716 --> 01:13:17.219]  The big enemy, as you said, is the Republican establishment with
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.065]  The Speaker of the House meeting with Democrats on TV saying he wants to work with them basically against Trump.
[01:13:23.325 --> 01:13:26.548]  They're all preparing with Mitch McConnell saying Trump may be removed.
[01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:31.433]  The New York Times this weekend, they are clearly preparing the attack in the next month.
[01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:40.482]  This is the time for maximum vigilance and never hedging our bets, but being fully committed to the Republic and fully committed to this champion, Donald John Trump.
[01:13:40.722 --> 01:13:41.964]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[01:13:43.064 --> 01:13:44.066]  Alex, great to be with you.
[01:13:44.106 --> 01:13:54.001]  And again, the most important takeaway today, and you're hearing it on InfoWars first, Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN, will be out of work shortly.
[01:13:54.597 --> 01:14:10.251]  Folks at the highest levels of AT&T, who are on the verge of acquiring Time Warner and thus CNN, are very unhappy with the way CNN has become a front organization and no longer a news organization.
[01:14:10.331 --> 01:14:12.012]  Well said, my friend.
[01:14:12.132 --> 01:14:13.734]  Alright, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:14:13.774 --> 01:14:14.334]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:14:15.255 --> 01:14:15.715]  Great, Alex.
[01:14:15.855 --> 01:14:16.296]  Thank you.
[01:14:16.356 --> 01:14:21.080]  I was hearing that a few weeks ago, too, about some meetings in D.C.
[01:14:23.533 --> 01:14:27.961]  Let's just say the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:35.513]  Let me start getting to some clips, then I want to open the phones up to take your calls out of Antonio Sabato Jr.
[01:14:35.553 --> 01:14:37.414]  joining us, and I want to have open phones for him.
[01:14:37.794 --> 01:14:45.178]  Smart guy, good-looking guy, libertarian conservative patriot, and the numbers are showing, looks like he could win in his run for Congress.
[01:14:45.658 --> 01:14:48.779]  So we really look forward to having him on, coming up.
[01:14:48.799 --> 01:14:57.544]  He's been on before, and now I see he's getting traction in the polls, and he was on Fox News this morning, which is what made me think, have Alia go ahead and call him up.
[01:14:58.024 --> 01:15:02.245]  And try to get him on, so he's going to be popping in to join us as well, because that's the real victory here.
[01:15:02.805 --> 01:15:07.187]  Keep moving forward, get real patriots elected to Congress, to governorships, to statehouses.
[01:15:08.367 --> 01:15:11.088]  900 plus patriots elected to statehouses.
[01:15:11.108 --> 01:15:13.588]  30 plus statehouses now controlled by Republicans.
[01:15:13.929 --> 01:15:21.811]  The Liberty Movement is taking over the stinking evil old Republican Party that works with the evil white supremacist KKK.
[01:15:23.106 --> 01:15:23.846]  Democratic Party.
[01:15:24.727 --> 01:15:28.548]  And their whole race-baiting orgy is a symbol of their weakness.
[01:15:29.428 --> 01:15:36.391]  Again, I mean, I see CNN now, and other publications, and it is the headline, BIKERS TO PROTEST TRUMP!
[01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:41.133]  And I go, the bikers are for, and I read it, it says the bikers are there to protest him.
[01:15:41.853 --> 01:15:44.794]  And then I see them show crowds, going, look at the bikers, they're against Trump!
[01:15:44.814 --> 01:15:49.476]  Because they had no crowd, so they pointed a camera at 200 yards in our crowd.
[01:15:49.576 --> 01:15:51.637]  I mean, that is incredible!
[01:15:54.508 --> 01:16:04.595]  They are telling lies now that are so big that are just... Well, it's what Matt, one of the producers, said.
[01:16:04.615 --> 01:16:06.296]  He goes, this is Hitler tactics.
[01:16:06.316 --> 01:16:12.640]  I mean, I think about how Schwarzenegger's lecturing Trump on how to not be a racist.
[01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:16.043]  The guy told Rolling Stone he dreams of being Hitler.
[01:16:18.254 --> 01:16:35.728]  I'm not going to go into the whole thing about why he bought the rights to the movie Pumping Iron, because they had, and we're going to put it on the DVD a decade ago, it made him pay exorbitantly to buy Pumping Iron, because it was on the cutting room floor when he talked about admiring Adolf Hitler and the master race, and they interviewed all these black bodybuilders.
[01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:40.552]  He'd walk into the gym and say, in words, get out of here, your God is here.
[01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:44.435]  And he was so racist and so hateful he would make them cry.
[01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:51.156]  And then he'd take their girlfriends away from him and have sex with them in the gym in front of everybody.
[01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:54.977]  And I guess his bluff worked.
[01:16:54.997 --> 01:16:56.018]  He's like huge black guys.
[01:16:56.038 --> 01:16:56.618]  They'd back off.
[01:16:56.638 --> 01:16:57.618]  He'd threaten to kick their asses.
[01:16:58.739 --> 01:16:59.999]  He's completely insane!
[01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:07.262]  His father was an SS officer in the Gestapo and ran a major city in World War II.
[01:17:08.769 --> 01:17:13.213]  His brother, the big guy who died in an automobile accident, I've read it all up on it.
[01:17:13.653 --> 01:17:16.976]  I made a documentary partially about Schwarzenegger, martial law.
[01:17:20.499 --> 01:17:22.761]  His brother was a product of an SS marriage.
[01:17:23.382 --> 01:17:27.025]  Arnold was born, what, like in the last year of the war or whatever.
[01:17:27.265 --> 01:17:28.306]  The point is, is that
[01:17:29.588 --> 01:17:33.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have a literal Nazi.
[01:17:34.252 --> 01:17:42.119]  Where it was in Rolling Stone that people would come over to his house, he'd have Hitler speeches on the record player and would be in an SS uniform.
[01:17:42.799 --> 01:17:47.183]  He wore Nazi uniforms at the house for dinner parties.
[01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:51.191]  And I guess it gets people's attention.
[01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:59.253]  I mean, yeah, it's a real son of a real Nazi, big good-looking guy in a Nazi uniform with a German accent, playing Hitler records.
[01:17:59.313 --> 01:18:00.794]  And the women were impressed, I guess.
[01:18:01.394 --> 01:18:05.715]  I mean, and he points his damn finger, excuse me, listeners, I'm not trying to use those terms.
[01:18:06.195 --> 01:18:15.998]  He points his stinking lily-livered finger at Donald Trump, who's trying to turn this country around and everything else, and says he is a Nazi in that video he put out last week.
[01:18:16.238 --> 01:18:17.518]  That makes me sick!
[01:18:20.549 --> 01:18:22.530]  My family literally almost died.
[01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:26.671]  I almost don't exist because of Arnold Schwarzenegger's father and people like him.
[01:18:26.871 --> 01:18:29.192]  And then I've got to be lectured by this toad.
[01:18:33.553 --> 01:18:35.674]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:18:38.775 --> 01:18:42.396]  And then it gets worse because Arnold at least didn't round up Jews by the thousands.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:49.632]  The godfather of the modern left, the guy that funds them, wasn't just a Nazi collaborator.
[01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:53.335]  He says he's proud of it and not sorry for it!
[01:18:57.213 --> 01:19:06.921]  George Soros, I mean you cannot, and then George Soros is trying to destroy me 24-7 with massive money, funding all these lies and all these private investigators and stuff.
[01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:09.323]  I mean, and just coming after me, after me.
[01:19:09.523 --> 01:19:18.410]  I mean, it's weird to have a weird Nazi after me, trying to, and he runs the Google Facebook censor board with Southern Broadway Law Center, he funds it.
[01:19:19.091 --> 01:19:20.972]  A weird Nazi censoring me?
[01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:28.279]  And then I get Cuomo and his thug brother, Chris Cuomo, on Trump Rally.
[01:19:28.539 --> 01:19:30.681]  Nothing says fun like white supremacist.
[01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:37.884]  And the headlines in the Washington Post and CNN, everyone who voted for Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:19:39.345 --> 01:19:41.406]  And it's just like, well, screw you!
[01:19:43.587 --> 01:19:45.168]  But they're like, oh, we don't care if you don't care.
[01:19:45.268 --> 01:19:48.150]  We're going to come after you and everybody else, including average citizens.
[01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:51.893]  You're now going to have leftists coming up to you, poking you.
[01:19:52.313 --> 01:19:53.075]  Saying, hey, hey!
[01:19:54.197 --> 01:19:54.778]  Bow down to me!
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:56.101]  You know what?
[01:19:56.561 --> 01:19:58.144]  They just woke up the sleeping giant.
[01:19:59.266 --> 01:20:00.328]  I got so much energy.
[01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:01.250]  I'm ready to fight.
[01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:02.031]  I'm ready to win.
[01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.689]  Well, he was the founder of Vice, syndicated radio and TV host.
[01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:11.829]  Gavin McInnes is with us.
[01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:15.351]  He's got so many shows on so many platforms, I can't even go over it all.
[01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:17.111]  But he's compoundmedia.com.
[01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:19.032]  He's also, I guess, working with The Rebel.
[01:20:19.392 --> 01:20:21.033]  Twitter at Gavin underscore McInnes.
[01:20:21.473 --> 01:20:23.313]  And he joins us now.
[01:20:23.453 --> 01:20:27.195]  But he is a Swiss Army knife of intellectual ideas.
[01:20:27.535 --> 01:20:30.496]  So, let's front and center, my maestro.
[01:20:31.932 --> 01:20:40.436]  Well, here's what I, I understand that politicians like Hillary, the DNC, I understand that they want to incentivize single moms.
[01:20:40.797 --> 01:20:45.019]  They want to shatter the black family so they can make more Americans dependent on them.
[01:20:45.259 --> 01:20:51.882]  What I'm obsessed with these days is how eager the populace is to assist these people.
[01:20:52.303 --> 01:20:56.225]  How eager they are to jump in bed with these people where they have no real gains.
[01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:58.626]  Exactly!
[01:20:58.686 --> 01:21:04.869]  If you're Roman soldiers taking over a town in Brittany and burning it, you get to rape the women, you get the gold.
[01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.250]  They're not even getting anything!
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:10.092]  They're screwing their own future, but it's VR.
[01:21:10.392 --> 01:21:11.893]  It's imaginary.
[01:21:12.888 --> 01:21:13.269]  Exactly.
[01:21:13.289 --> 01:21:18.614]  They're jumping next to the Roman soldiers and marching with them, saying, let's raven pillage my town.
[01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:20.496]  And you go, well, that was easy.
[01:21:20.556 --> 01:21:23.460]  I mean, these people were thought policing ourselves.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:29.386]  So the Gestapo, the Secret Service, they don't even have to show up for work to thought police us, because we'll do it.
[01:21:29.686 --> 01:21:31.008]  Like this Google Memo thing.
[01:21:31.588 --> 01:21:35.833]  That he was fired not just by the CEO, but by his peers.
[01:21:36.174 --> 01:21:38.797]  Forbes called it an anti-woman screed.
[01:21:39.738 --> 01:21:43.122]  You had Salon saying it confirms your worst fears.
[01:21:43.623 --> 01:21:49.470]  And they've just taken this fake narrative that he said women don't belong in the workforce, and they've exaggerated it.
[01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:52.013]  I don't think any of the media has even read it.
[01:21:52.093 --> 01:21:58.240]  And he was also saying he saw the future and he saw that he was about to get penalized for being male, which is illegal.
[01:21:58.721 --> 01:22:01.324]  And he was saying, hey, company, I want us all to work together.
[01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:03.807]  Women are a huge asset to the workforce.
[01:22:04.147 --> 01:22:05.148]  Sexism is bad.
[01:22:05.208 --> 01:22:06.049]  Equality is good.
[01:22:06.069 --> 01:22:10.014]  However, do we really need to demand every single
[01:22:10.094 --> 01:22:15.800]  Every single aspect, every single floor, every single cubicle of this building is 50% male, 50% female.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:22.026]  Do they really need to all, do the coders, which is a very rare skill, do the coders all have to be 50% female?
[01:22:22.167 --> 01:22:24.929]  Because that's forcing women into a role.
[01:22:24.969 --> 01:22:25.630]  It's slavery.
[01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.153]  It's forcing them into the Foxconn factory in China.
[01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:29.034]  That's really what it is.
[01:22:29.955 --> 01:22:32.257]  Let's get George Costanza into the NBA.
[01:22:32.577 --> 01:22:35.480]  Let's get some short, fat Jewish guys playing NBA.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:36.861]  The NBA is black.
[01:22:37.081 --> 01:22:37.602]  Sorry.
[01:22:38.163 --> 01:22:39.764]  The MLB is Hispanic.
[01:22:39.984 --> 01:22:40.445]  Sorry.
[01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:51.836]  I was about to say, I was an okay football player, but by the time I was a sophomore and they put me on varsity in a 5A team in Dallas, and huge black guys and white guys were running me over, I said, I quit.
[01:22:52.456 --> 01:22:53.097]  I have broken ribs.
[01:22:53.117 --> 01:22:55.038]  They're like, well, you did some good tackles.
[01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.400]  I'm like, dude, I'm done.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.642]  And again, it wasn't like I was mad that most of the guys running over me were black.
[01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:01.084]  It was just, that's the way it was.
[01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:12.117]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:23:12.177 --> 01:23:12.637]  That's right.
[01:23:12.717 --> 01:23:17.720]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:23:17.981 --> 01:23:24.465]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[01:23:24.665 --> 01:23:31.910]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:32.410]  Woo!
[01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:33.390]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:42.093]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:23:42.233 --> 01:23:51.455]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:23:51.836 --> 01:23:55.157]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:23:55.277 --> 01:23:59.238]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:23:59.398 --> 01:24:00.238]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:03.079]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:06.681 --> 01:24:27.731]  Coming up in the next segment to give your take on the Civil War the Globalists have launched through their compliant leftist stooges.
[01:24:29.244 --> 01:24:34.506]  Situation with the escalation in the war, at least on paper, in Afghanistan.
[01:24:34.526 --> 01:24:39.028]  They're announcing they're getting ready to make their move to try to overthrow the president.
[01:24:39.048 --> 01:24:40.309]  How do you think that's going to go down?
[01:24:40.389 --> 01:24:41.510]  What do we do in response?
[01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:44.791]  I think the president has to move on them.
[01:24:46.572 --> 01:24:50.914]  And that makes me public enemy number one, that I'm willing to come out and say what this country needs.
[01:24:52.705 --> 01:24:54.426]  Remember, I'm the anti-police state guy.
[01:24:54.766 --> 01:24:55.867]  I'm the anti-coup guy.
[01:24:56.567 --> 01:24:58.108]  They are the ones with the police state.
[01:24:58.508 --> 01:24:59.709]  They are the ones with the coup.
[01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:06.833]  They are the ones openly announcing they want to kill the president and are planning to do it to legitimize it with
[01:25:08.066 --> 01:25:09.107]  Their constituency.
[01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:13.629]  And to prepare them, like everybody's up at the edge of the cliff going, come on guys, let's jump!
[01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:14.730]  It's safe!
[01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:19.153]  So they jump off into the water and go, it's warm in here, come on in, it's great!
[01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:21.274]  There's not piranhas in here or anything.
[01:25:21.994 --> 01:25:22.675]  As I swim by.
[01:25:22.695 --> 01:25:24.135]  And as you swim by.
[01:25:25.316 --> 01:25:29.118]  As if we are going to put up with any of this.
[01:25:29.939 --> 01:25:31.660]  As if they have the moral authority.
[01:25:33.143 --> 01:25:36.366]  As if they have any military bearing or history.
[01:25:36.626 --> 01:25:47.556]  As if they have any physicality or any business acumen or any true gravitas when it comes to being aggressive in the real sense.
[01:25:47.956 --> 01:25:56.664]  Because if they start a civil war, they plan to mop everybody up, shut down the red states forever, and basically create a one-party system.
[01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:57.445]  That's their stated goal.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.801]  Have new fake elections overseen by them.
[01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:02.963]  It's basically the Venezuelan model.
[01:26:04.364 --> 01:26:10.668]  A permanent one-party state with a kind of vestigial Republican Party that are lapdogs and plays along.
[01:26:11.969 --> 01:26:17.052]  The coup supporters at least think they're going to have a place in the new system.
[01:26:18.328 --> 01:26:41.293]  And because they know we reach tens of millions of people every day now, they're censoring us, they're blocking us, they're trying to boycott us, they're trying to shut us down, and they're having two shows on HBO, one show on Showtime, multiple shows on Netflix, every major cable comedy show, saying
[01:26:43.868 --> 01:26:46.909]  That Alex Jones is an evil bad person and needs to be taken off the air.
[01:26:47.190 --> 01:27:08.660]  And now they're launching Comedy Central program where five nights a week, I'll tell you about this in the next segment, they have someone playing the part quote of Alex Jones, this is a new Stephen Colbert thing, and it's an actor reading off a teleprompter
[01:27:09.534 --> 01:27:17.520]  Who then will make nonsensical arguments, and they admit it's supposed to be an Alex Jones approach to satire.
[01:27:20.261 --> 01:27:26.586]  And then when I go out on the street in Austin, Texas, where the failures of LA and other places have moved,
[01:27:28.356 --> 01:27:31.098]  They don't think, gee, we moved here because we collapsed other areas of the country.
[01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:35.361]  They see me walking down the street, and they come over and go, F you and want to beat me up.
[01:27:35.842 --> 01:27:39.425]  And I ask them why, and they repeat something they heard on Stephen Colbert.
[01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:42.307]  And I look at them and I go, dude, that's not real.
[01:27:42.587 --> 01:27:44.248]  And they go, shut up, fake news.
[01:27:44.609 --> 01:27:45.289]  Fact check.
[01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:48.652]  What do you say for Charlotte?
[01:27:49.412 --> 01:27:54.296]  And I say, well, today, 13 people got run over and killed and hundreds injured.
[01:27:54.737 --> 01:27:55.217]  Shut up.
[01:27:55.277 --> 01:27:55.938]  That didn't happen.
[01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:56.378]  You're fake.
[01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:02.228]  And I look at the guy and I say, that's not fake.
[01:28:02.308 --> 01:28:03.048]  It's on video.
[01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:04.069]  It was a live feed.
[01:28:04.949 --> 01:28:05.490]  You saw it!
[01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:09.091]  They walk over saying, F.U.
[01:28:09.392 --> 01:28:10.792]  And a few of them would actually talk to me.
[01:28:10.812 --> 01:28:13.033]  It was usually the gay guys.
[01:28:13.574 --> 01:28:15.915]  They'd laugh at me and say, okay, I'll talk to you.
[01:28:16.275 --> 01:28:19.417]  They'd walk over, all sassy pants, doing like this and, oh yeah, really?
[01:28:19.877 --> 01:28:21.558]  Oh sure, that never happened, that's fake news.
[01:28:21.738 --> 01:28:24.999]  The guy's boyfriend goes, well actually that did happen in Barcelona today.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.721]  He's like, oh it doesn't matter, you're still fake.
[01:28:30.117 --> 01:28:38.660]  They don't believe anything I say, despite the fact I keep telling you everything that's going to happen, and it happens just basically exactly as we said.
[01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:45.203]  And that's not hard to do when you're tuned in to the real world already.
[01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:58.388]  But see, the establishment thinks you're so dumb, they put out, you're a racist, you're a Nazi, you're a fascist, and it's okay to punch a Nazi, it's okay to get rid of their free speech, and then, by extension,
[01:28:59.773 --> 01:29:04.835]  Project onto everyone else that they are Nazis.
[01:29:07.056 --> 01:29:08.897]  I was wearing my wedding ring today, because I never wear it.
[01:29:09.938 --> 01:29:16.421]  And believe it or not, I've lost so much weight since about four or five years ago when I was wearing it last, because I'm remarried, that it's just too loose.
[01:29:16.821 --> 01:29:17.301]  It's coming off.
[01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:17.761]  I can't wear it.
[01:29:17.961 --> 01:29:19.542]  It keeps distracting me.
[01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:21.783]  I have to get a new wedding ring, I guess.
[01:29:22.303 --> 01:29:24.044]  Or I guess get it filled, make it smaller.
[01:29:24.064 --> 01:29:25.105]  That's just a fact.
[01:29:25.965 --> 01:29:30.206]  That wasn't a stunt for the products we sell to show how I've lost 40, 50 pounds the last few years.
[01:29:31.126 --> 01:29:32.366]  Still got a really big head, though.
[01:29:32.886 --> 01:29:37.847]  But I have lost 90% of my prodigious gut I had before.
[01:29:37.887 --> 01:29:41.708]  But I've gotten so focused on work, I've basically stopped working out now.
[01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:44.169]  So I'm wondering how soon will I start gaining weight again?
[01:29:44.249 --> 01:29:50.910]  But the products are so good, the X2, the Supermill, and the rest of it, that are on sale, by the way, right now, that I just basically quit working out.
[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.131]  It's not good!
[01:29:52.632 --> 01:29:53.514]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.035 --> 01:29:55.618]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:59.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.624 --> 01:30:07.165]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:13.646]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.066 --> 01:30:16.847]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:17.247 --> 01:30:20.248]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:23.889]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.689]  The left
[01:30:25.029 --> 01:30:25.970]  ...controls culture.
[01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:26.971]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.051 --> 01:30:28.272]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:28.572 --> 01:30:35.659]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:35.719 --> 01:30:38.121]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:38.602 --> 01:30:42.466]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:42.526 --> 01:30:44.587]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:30:45.208 --> 01:30:50.594]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:30:50.834 --> 01:30:57.100]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.161 --> 01:30:58.862]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.022 --> 01:31:00.204]  It's available right now.
[01:31:00.524 --> 01:31:02.686]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:09.071]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:14.533]  DNA Force protects your body from the toxic environment that surrounds us all.
[01:31:14.693 --> 01:31:19.134]  The powerful ingredients include Bio-PQQ and Coenzyme Q10.
[01:31:19.374 --> 01:31:21.855]  Protect yourself against dangerous free radicals.

[01:33:02.771 --> 01:33:17.243]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in So move it on over
[01:33:22.455 --> 01:33:26.197]  So, they want to stop the real resistance to the Globals takeover.
[01:33:26.257 --> 01:33:36.141]  If they want to destroy the opposition to their offshore Globals takeover, they have to create straw men and then have those fictitious actors pose as news reporters
[01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:53.294]  Who then misrepresent what their opposition says and does.
[01:33:53.414 --> 01:33:54.094]  Caricatures!
[01:33:56.034 --> 01:33:56.855]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:33:56.995 --> 01:34:03.817]  Wartime level propaganda being directed at yours truly and President Trump like we're foreign powers.
[01:34:04.637 --> 01:34:05.118]  But we're not.
[01:34:06.718 --> 01:34:18.102]  We're just representatives of the people that are trying to get our country back from the clutches of the institutions that have hijacked our nation and that are exploiting the people and who have broken the social compact.
[01:34:19.241 --> 01:34:26.246]  Now I guess launching next week the new show, I can't even watch all these shows attacking me, I can't even keep track of it.
[01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:35.032]  Why Jordan Kepler's Alex Jones approach to conspiracy satire is a tricky prospect, writes the IndieWire.
[01:34:37.514 --> 01:34:38.774]  Why is it a tricky prospect?
[01:34:38.814 --> 01:34:46.460]  Because they're worried about how to dumb it down enough that their audience can even understand it without
[01:34:48.524 --> 01:34:50.006]  Sending us more listeners.
[01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:56.613]  But, nevertheless, they're going to try the new approach.
[01:34:58.235 --> 01:35:08.187]  Just like the show Homeland, where the evil character is based on Alex Jones, and he produces fake news, and it shows the proof, and he's a racist, and so then people that watch that
[01:35:09.608 --> 01:35:18.330]  are so mentally ill, so suggestible, that when they see me on the street, they actually believe that I'm that person.
[01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:24.749]  I don't think we can reach these people, folks.
[01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:26.830]  And now they're going to project it on you.
[01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:29.350]  Now they're going to come up and ask you on the street.
[01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:30.310]  CNN's announcing this.
[01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:31.471]  Are you for Trump?
[01:35:31.531 --> 01:35:33.111]  And if you are, they're going to punch you in the nose.
[01:35:33.331 --> 01:35:34.511]  Or they're going to kick you out of your apartment.
[01:35:34.531 --> 01:35:35.571]  Or they're not going to do business with you.
[01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:36.852]  Well, good then!
[01:35:37.232 --> 01:35:39.192]  Let's just separate from these people.
[01:35:40.092 --> 01:35:41.072]  Start doing what they do.
[01:35:41.132 --> 01:35:42.613]  Look into everybody they do business with.
[01:35:43.713 --> 01:35:47.793]  And then don't support them when they do this no-platforming to others.
[01:35:48.394 --> 01:35:50.314]  And see how long these parasites last.
[01:35:51.527 --> 01:35:52.407]  Because they're not going to stop.
[01:35:52.608 --> 01:35:59.811]  You give in to their bullying now, by successive approximation, they're going to keep pushing it forever.
[01:36:00.732 --> 01:36:09.056]  So here's a first look at Jordan Kepler stealing my identity and then misrepresenting who I am.
[01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:11.778]  It's like stealing someone's identity and you kind of look like them.
[01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:17.922]  You act like them in the real world, and then you end up getting busted and going to jail.
[01:36:17.942 --> 01:36:19.022]  You know, that happens sometimes.
[01:36:19.042 --> 01:36:20.023]  People get their identity stolen.
[01:36:20.343 --> 01:36:23.063]  Folks write a bunch of checks or whatever, until the police figure it out later.
[01:36:23.103 --> 01:36:23.583]  Sometimes never.
[01:36:23.883 --> 01:36:26.624]  You go to prison for what they did.
[01:36:26.984 --> 01:36:29.025]  But here he is publicly stealing my identity.
[01:36:29.445 --> 01:36:31.265]  Then he misrepresents who I am.
[01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:35.386]  Maybe they'll give him an Emmy.
[01:36:37.056 --> 01:36:38.957]  Just like they misrepresent Alec Baldwin.
[01:36:39.217 --> 01:36:40.177]  I'm Donald Trump.
[01:36:40.277 --> 01:36:42.358]  I don't like black people.
[01:36:42.378 --> 01:36:43.499]  But I do like Alex Jones.
[01:36:43.779 --> 01:36:46.480]  Alex Jones taught me how to not like black people.
[01:36:47.321 --> 01:36:48.361]  Saturday Night Live.
[01:36:48.381 --> 01:36:53.664]  And then people started sending me emails and comments going, that's Alex Jones.
[01:36:53.704 --> 01:36:54.304]  He's the racist.
[01:36:54.564 --> 01:36:55.545]  Then you have Tom Brokaw.
[01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.345]  Doesn't show a clip of me being racist.
[01:36:57.585 --> 01:37:00.387]  He just says, branding Alex Jones as racist.
[01:37:01.187 --> 01:37:02.728]  Talking to you like you're a three-year-old.
[01:37:03.769 --> 01:37:04.870]  And the talking points go out!
[01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:09.393]  And then, you know, the New York Times has editorial board meetings and they go, this Russia thing is going to peter out.
[01:37:09.413 --> 01:37:10.173]  What's coming up next?
[01:37:10.233 --> 01:37:15.097]  Well, as we move towards the next election, they may remove him before then, we're going to say he's mentally ill.
[01:37:15.137 --> 01:37:18.679]  That's the talking points we've been ordered to go with by the folks at Psych Warfare.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:24.923]  We're also going to expand onto just basic fraud probes and bring back the racism stuff.
[01:37:26.825 --> 01:37:28.125]  And then Stone gets the intel.
[01:37:28.145 --> 01:37:30.087]  We give you the intel and sure enough,
[01:37:31.547 --> 01:37:32.287]  That's what they do.
[01:37:32.927 --> 01:37:35.388]  Again, think of the magnitude of this.
[01:37:35.868 --> 01:37:39.589]  Here is the Comedy Central clip of the man that's stolen my identity.
[01:37:40.989 --> 01:37:43.050]  Attention couch soldiers, they're lying to you.
[01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:45.591]  The mainstream establishment has poisoned your mind.
[01:37:45.771 --> 01:37:47.371]  They say we should investigate Trump.
[01:37:47.531 --> 01:37:49.432]  I say, impeach Hillary.
[01:37:49.752 --> 01:37:51.692]  They say global warming is made by man.
[01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:54.933]  I say, it's probably why we earn 30 cents more on the dollar.
[01:37:55.573 --> 01:37:57.434]  They say our children should learn Chinese.
[01:37:57.634 --> 01:37:57.994]  I say,
[01:37:58.414 --> 01:37:59.455]  China isn't real.
[01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:01.897]  No one I know has, like, ever been there.
[01:38:02.057 --> 01:38:03.498]  And I know, like, a ton of people.
[01:38:03.898 --> 01:38:04.479]  Who are they?
[01:38:04.939 --> 01:38:05.400]  The enemy.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.240]  Who's the enemy?
[01:38:06.701 --> 01:38:07.121]  They are.
[01:38:07.241 --> 01:38:07.962]  I already said that.
[01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:08.842]  Pay attention.
[01:38:09.123 --> 01:38:13.946]  It's time for us to fight back against them, because them are fighting against we.
[01:38:15.528 --> 01:38:17.909]  I'm Jordan Klepper, and this is The Opposition.
[01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:19.150]  The Opposition.
[01:38:19.391 --> 01:38:20.011]  Jordan Klepper.
[01:38:20.231 --> 01:38:21.953]  Weeknights after The Daily Show.
[01:38:22.033 --> 01:38:24.675]  Premieres September 25th on Comedy Central.
[01:38:24.735 --> 01:38:25.235]  Progress?
[01:38:25.615 --> 01:38:27.017]  You'll have to go through us first.
[01:38:29.175 --> 01:38:31.216]  And what they're really saying is, marching orders.
[01:38:31.256 --> 01:38:32.517]  You're going to have to go through us.
[01:38:32.857 --> 01:38:34.458]  He's up there saying, you got to go through me.
[01:38:35.359 --> 01:38:37.960]  And then he'll explain how he politically operates.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.342]  He's really telling them how to operate, not the way we operate.
[01:38:42.002 --> 01:38:44.244]  And then he all says it very disingenuously.
[01:38:44.944 --> 01:38:53.009]  So they're there getting their programming on how to attack us, while they're learning to hate us, but really they're discovering their identity.
[01:38:54.069 --> 01:38:54.970]  This is mind control.
[01:38:56.477 --> 01:39:06.786]  And it is meant to just send them out savagely, believing there's some war room battling against them, when all we're doing is looking at victims who are mind-controlled.
[01:39:07.626 --> 01:39:08.487]  Oh, and China.
[01:39:08.767 --> 01:39:13.471]  Notice Lloyd Blankfein again put up those tweets months ago saying, you'll never rebuild America.
[01:39:14.212 --> 01:39:15.933]  China is much more powerful.
[01:39:15.993 --> 01:39:17.895]  We're moving all of our infrastructure there.
[01:39:17.915 --> 01:39:21.137]  And it's the same thing.
[01:39:21.177 --> 01:39:22.999]  They're signaling, we're with China.
[01:39:24.642 --> 01:39:25.984]  I bet China paid for that.
[01:39:26.324 --> 01:39:28.106]  China's buying up most of Hollywood.
[01:39:28.526 --> 01:39:35.434]  China admittedly spends product placement in movies, just like you can pay to have your product in a movie, to have, oh, the Martian.
[01:39:35.734 --> 01:39:40.840]  We couldn't get to Mars to save Matt Damon, but the Chinese boosters are better than ours.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.523]  They got our boosters, or we use Russian boosters.
[01:39:44.798 --> 01:39:50.761]  Or, oh, the Chinese save us in, you know, the new movie that came out about the arrival.
[01:39:51.201 --> 01:40:02.888]  Every show, every movie that's science fiction or news-based, Hollywood is admittedly being, there it is, Daily Mail, from Hollywood to Chollywood, the sinister Chinese takeover of movie land.
[01:40:03.228 --> 01:40:03.988]  Boom!
[01:40:04.548 --> 01:40:13.093]  Oh, but type in seven, eight years ago, when I first said China's taking over Hollywood, the Jew haters went completely apoplectic.
[01:40:14.551 --> 01:40:18.272]  Completely just, almost in a fetal position, going, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:40:18.632 --> 01:40:19.412]  It's a fact!
[01:40:19.792 --> 01:40:23.313]  And I told you first, because I was out in Hollywood talking to people.
[01:40:25.374 --> 01:40:26.194]  China would.
[01:40:27.074 --> 01:40:33.556]  And that's why you see Comedy Central with the Chinese flag projected over him, big and powerful.
[01:40:35.216 --> 01:40:38.477]  And in Chinese iconography, that's a disrespect.
[01:40:38.777 --> 01:40:43.218]  It projects, like hitting with a shoe, the big China over him.
[01:40:44.451 --> 01:40:47.212]  And he's the ignorant American that isn't worried about China.
[01:40:48.032 --> 01:40:50.732]  You've got Blankfein, you've got The Globalist, you've got Kissinger.
[01:40:50.952 --> 01:40:55.653]  They've all moved over there, they've all got their industry there, they all leverage the sellout of America there.
[01:40:55.933 --> 01:40:57.714]  China's got 98% of rare earth minerals.
[01:40:58.514 --> 01:41:05.935]  Because as a policy, we're meant to be de-industrialized.
[01:41:06.096 --> 01:41:08.016]  They're giving all the deep water ports.
[01:41:12.363 --> 01:41:14.065]  And then the globalists only use the U.S.
[01:41:14.085 --> 01:41:24.415]  military to keep the Chinese Communist in check to make sure they can still have one-sided business deals and extract as much slave labor out of the poor, hard-working Chinese people as they can.
[01:41:25.056 --> 01:41:29.921]  That's the deciphered, true intellectual, historical breakdown of a show like that.
[01:41:30.321 --> 01:41:35.787]  Not him up there making nonsensical statements and then projecting it that Alex Jones said it.
[01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:40.630]  You listen to stuff he says.
[01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:42.412]  I don't say any of that.
[01:41:43.533 --> 01:41:52.245]  Other than we have multinational, very exploitive, neoliberal, corporatist forces that want to drive our economies into the dirt.
[01:41:53.356 --> 01:42:12.192]  So they can consolidate control and want a renter economy where almost everybody lives in little tiny dwellings and they're banning family homes all over Europe and starting it here and banning fire stoves and banning any natural, human, organic, in the fields operation to fully and totally domesticate everyone.
[01:42:12.452 --> 01:42:14.714]  This is a red-level emergency.
[01:42:17.437 --> 01:42:19.959]  This isn't bipartisan, this is human.
[01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:30.589]  But again, they're using super psychological warfare, where first they get well-meaning people to go, we shouldn't be racist.
[01:42:30.609 --> 01:42:31.469]  And folks are like, yeah.
[01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:34.052]  And next, you should not use a word like this as racist.
[01:42:34.072 --> 01:42:37.635]  Next, you should do this more in your life to prove you're not racist and to repay for it.
[01:42:38.055 --> 01:42:41.458]  And once they get them in that mindset, they go, you see the ACLU?
[01:42:42.018 --> 01:42:47.123]  They tweeted a picture of a little boy or girl, you can't tell, a two-year-old blonde-haired baby.
[01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:50.932]  With an American flag, and it triggered everybody.
[01:42:51.293 --> 01:42:53.795]  Actually, go to the tweet, you can see the full American flag, the full photo.
[01:42:55.437 --> 01:43:00.641]  And it was so triggering that... And the left universally said, it's racist, it's evil, take it down.
[01:43:00.942 --> 01:43:03.404]  And the ACLU then apologized and said, you're right!
[01:43:05.366 --> 01:43:05.826]  You're right!
[01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:07.928]  It's racist, we apologize.
[01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:11.472]  Think of the cult-level control.
[01:43:12.981 --> 01:43:15.023]  And that takes me to Chris Cuomo on Trump.
[01:43:15.463 --> 01:43:18.685]  Nothing says fun like white supremacist.
[01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:23.089]  And then white supremacist by default.
[01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:25.470]  How ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[01:43:25.991 --> 01:43:26.471]  CNN.
[01:43:26.791 --> 01:43:28.533]  And they tell them in the transcript.
[01:43:30.054 --> 01:43:32.115]  Go out and get in ordinary people's faces.
[01:43:32.676 --> 01:43:33.737]  Especially white people.
[01:43:33.837 --> 01:43:34.597]  They're bad.
[01:43:35.318 --> 01:43:37.960]  I mean, just a peer pressure orgy.
[01:43:38.961 --> 01:43:40.622]  A peer pressure gang assault.
[01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:43.570]  Let's play the clip.
[01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:45.231]  Here it is.
[01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:45.811]  Surprise!
[01:43:46.291 --> 01:43:52.914]  He's blasting the media for criticizing his, or even pointing out, his wildly different tone in speeches.
[01:43:52.974 --> 01:43:57.476]  He's writing, the fake news is now complaining about my different types of back-to-back speeches.
[01:43:57.536 --> 01:44:00.617]  Well, there was Afghanistan.
[01:44:00.757 --> 01:44:01.158]  Somber.
[01:44:01.638 --> 01:44:02.298]  The big rally.
[01:44:02.358 --> 01:44:04.479]  Enthusiastic, dynamic, and fun!
[01:44:04.499 --> 01:44:06.780]  Because nothing says fun like white supremacists.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.501]  And the American Legion VA, respectful and strong.
[01:44:12.142 --> 01:44:15.283]  Too bad the Dems have no one who can change Jones.
[01:44:16.183 --> 01:44:17.523]  Notice the condescension.
[01:44:17.543 --> 01:44:18.924]  Oh, look!
[01:44:19.124 --> 01:44:20.444]  Oh, surprise!
[01:44:20.844 --> 01:44:21.965]  He tweeted again!
[01:44:23.005 --> 01:44:26.986]  For a year and a half, they've been saying you shouldn't be allowed to tweet, but they tweet constantly.
[01:44:27.287 --> 01:44:28.427]  All the other politicians do.
[01:44:28.447 --> 01:44:34.709]  So first, they ingrain it in their people's heads that tweeting is losing.
[01:44:35.495 --> 01:44:36.055]  When it's winning.
[01:44:36.075 --> 01:44:37.556]  And they go, oh look, we had another victory.
[01:44:37.876 --> 01:44:38.717]  He tweeted back.
[01:44:40.258 --> 01:44:42.559]  There's nothing more uncool than someone's speech.
[01:44:43.759 --> 01:44:45.520]  Or a president directly talking to you.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:51.063]  He's almost as bad as that Franklin Delano Roosevelt guy, another kook, you know, another bad guy.
[01:44:51.904 --> 01:44:56.326]  And then, oh, white supremacist.
[01:44:56.406 --> 01:44:57.907]  And it just, it's like parrots.
[01:44:58.707 --> 01:44:59.948]  Mind-controlled parrots.
[01:45:00.788 --> 01:45:01.589]  And it's not working.
[01:45:03.288 --> 01:45:05.750]  So now they're saying, well, let's just kill him on the same channel.
[01:45:06.751 --> 01:45:11.974]  And I'm saying, a group of people want to kill the president and overtake the government?
[01:45:13.355 --> 01:45:22.602]  And then bully all of us into line and have forced re-education in the public schools and Obama even had it on the books for re-education camps for conservatives?
[01:45:22.622 --> 01:45:24.263]  I mean, they called them re-education camps.
[01:45:24.944 --> 01:45:26.865]  You know, I got an idea for you guys.
[01:45:29.207 --> 01:45:30.428]  You push your big fat
[01:45:31.843 --> 01:45:36.771]  Globalist mouths a lot, when 99.9% of you couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper bag.
[01:45:37.231 --> 01:45:41.939]  You better hope, to your lucky stars, you don't get your way and start a physical war in this country.
[01:45:44.707 --> 01:45:47.348]  Because you've been asking for it for a long time.
[01:45:47.868 --> 01:45:57.630]  And you can blow up federal buildings all day and try to blame it on us, and you'll find a kindergartner or whatever, like Clinton's got caught doing, but when people actually come after you, they're not going to be going after kindergartners.
[01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:06.091]  There won't be one of you traitors, one of you collaborators, that could, you want to intimidate us to not walk on the street?
[01:46:06.552 --> 01:46:08.272]  You're not going to be able to
[01:46:10.848 --> 01:46:13.909]  Go to sleep at night without knowing of the crimes you've committed.
[01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:16.091]  So you want to play in a big man's game?
[01:46:16.151 --> 01:46:23.074]  Ooh, big war, gonna kill people, put folks in re-education camps, gonna bully everybody, gonna bankrupt everybody, gonna teach everybody.
[01:46:25.035 --> 01:46:28.136]  That's what this is, is an authoritarian attempt to take America down.
[01:46:28.396 --> 01:46:32.118]  The socialists have done it everywhere else, the communists, and man, they want it here now.
[01:46:32.538 --> 01:46:35.200]  And they are using the fact that we coexist with them to do it.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.381]  It's time to stop caring what they think.
[01:46:38.513 --> 01:46:42.560]  It's time to stop bowing down to them and to recognize what trash they are.
[01:46:43.221 --> 01:46:44.644]  But as for me, I'm non-violent.
[01:46:46.888 --> 01:46:49.733]  I'm here just pointing out what evil you are.
[01:46:50.274 --> 01:46:50.634]  Here is CNN.
[01:46:53.191 --> 01:47:02.279]  White supremacists by default, anyone who voted for Trump, and when you read the transcript, it says, blame President Trump for his tepid moral response.
[01:47:02.699 --> 01:47:04.681]  Call the neo-Nazis and white nationalist thugs.
[01:47:05.261 --> 01:47:08.024]  Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[01:47:08.524 --> 01:47:14.069]  You should add, while Facebook, Twitter, and Google block all the libertarians and conservatives, simply countering back with logic.
[01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:17.912]  While the big corporations help us bully people.
[01:47:22.679 --> 01:47:31.192]  And they go on to say, but it's ordinary people, the voters who elected the reality TV star, they're the ones who are to blame.
[01:47:33.155 --> 01:47:34.197]  So let's go ahead and go to that club.
[01:47:36.445 --> 01:47:47.353]  To members of a movement steeped in symbolism, coded messages, and belief in secret support for their cause, the president's initial response to Charlottesville... ...and violence on many sides.
[01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:48.834]  On many sides.
[01:47:49.415 --> 01:47:51.456]  ...was a sign the president had their backs.
[01:47:51.937 --> 01:47:55.780]  He didn't attack us, wrote Andrew England, the creator of a neo-Nazi website.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:02.485]  Other white nationalist posts included, he left the door open and clearly said, we are all equal under the law.
[01:48:02.845 --> 01:48:03.946]  Racism is evil.
[01:48:04.326 --> 01:48:17.914]  Monday, when President Trump finally branded members of the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups who take part in violence as criminals and thugs, the alt-right viewed that as a double meaning.
[01:48:18.635 --> 01:48:21.917]  So was the president's second response the delayed response?
[01:48:23.138 --> 01:48:26.461]  One that you believe he was pressured into and he doesn't believe?
[01:48:26.721 --> 01:48:28.743]  He was clearly pressured into it.
[01:48:29.223 --> 01:48:32.646]  Now, I don't think Donald Trump is an advocate for white people.
[01:48:33.126 --> 01:48:40.892]  I think he probably is entirely sincere when he says neo-Nazis, white supremacists, whoever those people are, are very bad and evil and go away.
[01:48:40.992 --> 01:48:42.293]  I think he entirely believes that.
[01:48:42.794 --> 01:48:45.656]  But his first statement was much more accurate and even-handed.
[01:48:46.376 --> 01:48:52.160]  Jared Taylor is editor of what he calls a white advocacy website called American Renaissance.
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:58.103]  He tries to be a soft-spoken voice in what most Americans call a hate movement.
[01:48:58.664 --> 01:49:06.308]  The Southern Poverty Law Center says Taylor's group is racist with ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist.
[01:49:06.888 --> 01:49:09.970]  Taylor calls himself a white advocate.
[01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:11.091]  What is a white advocate?
[01:49:11.727 --> 01:49:16.630]  A white advocate is someone who speaks up for the legitimate interests of white people.
[01:49:17.230 --> 01:49:18.911]  White advocates just want to be left alone.
[01:49:19.151 --> 01:49:22.513]  They would rather have a nation which was overwhelmingly white.
[01:49:23.093 --> 01:49:27.376]  And Taylor says the president understands this, even if the press does not.
[01:49:28.078 --> 01:49:38.449]  It's why Taylor backed Trump during the presidential primary campaign, producing racially charged robocalls like this that then-candidate Trump eventually had to denounce.
[01:49:39.049 --> 01:49:40.130]  We don't need Muslims.
[01:49:40.491 --> 01:49:42.553]  We need smart, well-educated white people.
[01:49:42.853 --> 01:49:44.395]  I am a farmer and white nationalist.
[01:49:44.575 --> 01:49:45.476]  Support Donald Trump.
[01:49:45.916 --> 01:49:49.739]  This week, Donald Trump took a page from white nationalist talking points.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:57.225]  I interviewed Jared Taylor Tuesday afternoon, two hours before President Trump's news conference in New York.
[01:49:57.846 --> 01:50:03.310]  The answers so similar, it's almost as if the president was listening in.
[01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.951]  2 p.m.
[01:50:04.131 --> 01:50:11.497]  and there would have been no violence whatsoever if there had not been counter protesters showing up with baseball bats and helmets and masks.
[01:50:14.466 --> 01:50:15.027]  Back this up.
[01:50:15.687 --> 01:50:25.052]  As if two hours later, the president heard this guy say this in a taped interview, you can see, and then copied it.
[01:50:25.393 --> 01:50:26.293]  It's common sense.
[01:50:28.975 --> 01:50:30.235]  It's a war on common sense.
[01:50:30.415 --> 01:50:35.538]  They want to define that Antifa can come beat you up and start a fight because you're Nazis.
[01:50:35.558 --> 01:50:37.199]  Well, soon it's conservatives-libertarians.
[01:50:37.699 --> 01:50:38.540]  In fact, it's already here.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:39.941]  They won't let Milo speak.
[01:50:41.044 --> 01:50:46.368]  Or Ann Coulter at Berkeley, and they're announcing that they're gonna not let an anti-communist march take place out in California.
[01:50:46.808 --> 01:50:47.229]  Anti-fuck.
[01:50:47.389 --> 01:50:48.309]  So that's what this is.
[01:50:48.610 --> 01:50:52.492]  They show up, they start the fight, and then they're supposed to be decried too!
[01:50:53.413 --> 01:50:54.454]  That's the whole point!
[01:50:54.714 --> 01:51:00.558]  Then they act like that common sense statement came from this white nationalist they went to interview.
[01:51:00.998 --> 01:51:02.880]  I mean, talk about conspiracy theories!
[01:51:12.341 --> 01:51:13.804]  This memo will bring down the traitors.
[01:51:14.285 --> 01:51:17.833]  McMasters doesn't want you... Deep State doesn't want you to read this memo.
[01:51:19.321 --> 01:51:20.542]  I mean, talk about traitors.
[01:51:20.582 --> 01:51:24.984]  You've got McMaster granting Susan Rice her same level of security clearance.
[01:51:25.124 --> 01:51:29.346]  At the same time, Trump is actively saying, we need to find the leakers.
[01:51:29.706 --> 01:51:30.587]  I'm being surveilled.
[01:51:30.887 --> 01:51:31.707]  Oh no, you're not.
[01:51:31.747 --> 01:51:32.668]  That's a big lie.
[01:51:32.688 --> 01:51:33.828]  How are you going to lie to the people?
[01:51:33.928 --> 01:51:36.329]  No, they wiretapped Trump Tower.
[01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:44.033]  And so at the same time that Trump is saying this to the American people, McMaster is saying, I don't think Susan Rice did anything wrong.
[01:51:44.133 --> 01:51:47.655]  I'm going to allow her to still have her same level of security clearance.
[01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:49.256]  It's insane.
[01:51:49.376 --> 01:51:51.458]  Why are the neocons surrounding Trump?
[01:51:51.658 --> 01:51:52.519]  What do they have on him?
[01:51:52.659 --> 01:51:53.400]  What's happening?
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:04.170]  Well again, David admit the memo, as I've said on air without the memo, the Bolsheviks, same globalist operatives, they created a state within a state for years and Russia only controlled Moscow.
[01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:07.913]  And then they got everybody through time and turned in their guns through propaganda.
[01:52:07.933 --> 01:52:09.295]  Then they slaughtered millions of people.
[01:52:09.775 --> 01:52:12.558]  So they admit that it is a malice strategy.
[01:52:12.578 --> 01:52:13.979]  That's what the Weathermen taught Obama.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.546]  They are all carrying out a malice strategy with deep staters and cowards like McMasters and others that Trump picked.
[01:52:20.626 --> 01:52:21.847]  They get approached by Deep State.
[01:52:21.867 --> 01:52:27.493]  They get scared and they join with it because they want to play golf and do whatever while we're being carted off to death camps.
[01:52:27.853 --> 01:52:31.535]  And, you know, pot-bellied liberals are kicking our brains out and raping our families, literally.
[01:52:31.916 --> 01:52:37.139]  That's what the left talks about, how they're going to rape us, how they're going to murder us, how they're going to have all these little nobodies.
[01:52:37.499 --> 01:52:41.722]  This is their existential dream of power, is to run around defecating on everybody.
[01:52:43.618 --> 01:52:46.439]  Well, people need to look no further than Venezuela and what happened.
[01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:49.399]  That's the exact same thing that they did there just several years ago.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.600]  They got rid of the guns.
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.501]  Everyone turn in your guns because we want to be a peaceful nation.
[01:52:54.161 --> 01:53:07.084]  And then just about a year or so later, we saw the total collapse there where the government was actually purging people who are eating dogs and giraffes out of the zoo, purging them because they don't have the guns or anything to fight back.
[01:53:08.807 --> 01:53:11.829]  Yeah, it only shows their hand even so more.
[01:53:12.049 --> 01:53:14.910]  When the minute you start telling the truth, they try to slap you down.
[01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:19.492]  The minute they start sharing anything that has a headline that's anti-them, they try to ban it.
[01:53:19.752 --> 01:53:26.016]  They are going to be forcing their hand so much that they're showing us, they're exposing us what their actual plans are.
[01:53:26.316 --> 01:53:30.758]  They're trying to ban us, they're trying to shut us down, they're trying to fire people for speaking the truth.
[01:53:31.038 --> 01:53:32.979]  That's only going to mean that more people will take it.
[01:53:32.999 --> 01:53:34.640]  We're not the radicals saying all this.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.521]  They're on C-SPAN.
[01:53:37.381 --> 01:53:44.330]  At the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer, Brennan, and Clapper saying a violent overthrow is coming in the next few months.
[01:53:44.650 --> 01:53:45.812]  Don't wait for impeachment.
[01:53:45.872 --> 01:53:46.873]  We're now moving.
[01:53:47.194 --> 01:53:49.757]  And then Al Gore goes on the Late Late Show and says the same thing.
[01:53:50.117 --> 01:53:51.619]  I mean, they are doing it!
[01:54:05.811 --> 01:54:07.372]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:54:07.392 --> 01:54:21.004]  So I'm playing this clip from CNN, and they're talking to some white nationalists, and they're saying because Trump said it takes two to tango, that he must have heard that from them.
[01:54:21.124 --> 01:54:22.024]  Everybody always says,
[01:54:35.822 --> 01:54:39.764]  If two groups come together and are attacking each other, you know, both sides are idiots.
[01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:45.527]  That is a default statement.
[01:54:48.609 --> 01:54:55.473]  But see, CNN says no, that means Trump, who came out and gave a speech two hours later, he must have seen our interview with this guy.
[01:54:55.813 --> 01:54:57.494]  But you can see it's a taped interview.
[01:55:00.563 --> 01:55:03.665]  It's just total insanity to again deceive their viewers.
[01:55:04.185 --> 01:55:11.128]  But this is the same CNN that told you along with other publications that the bikers were there in Phoenix two nights ago to protest Trump.
[01:55:11.408 --> 01:55:14.810]  This is how dumb they think all of us are.
[01:55:15.916 --> 01:55:20.417]  And then by extension, they're saying all Trump supporters are white supremacists.
[01:55:20.437 --> 01:55:23.418]  It says that in the text of the article by showing this guy.
[01:55:23.658 --> 01:55:31.880]  When you've got all these Hispanic and black racist groups saying they want their own countries and they hate, you know, white people and then, oh, but they love Hillary.
[01:55:32.401 --> 01:55:33.041]  Do they go again?
[01:55:33.261 --> 01:55:36.202]  Oh, look at Mecha, look at La Raza, look at the new Black Panther Party.
[01:55:36.482 --> 01:55:38.002]  Look, they all support Hillary.
[01:55:38.302 --> 01:55:44.264]  So every Hillary supporter is a Chicano nationalist or a black nationalist or whatever.
[01:55:45.555 --> 01:55:46.896]  Because conservatives don't do that.
[01:55:46.936 --> 01:55:48.237]  Libertarians don't play those games.
[01:55:48.457 --> 01:55:49.658]  That's disingenuous.
[01:55:50.438 --> 01:55:57.583]  But now, the Democratic Party saying, ACLU, you take down a picture of a white child from your website, it's racist.
[01:55:58.824 --> 01:55:59.805]  It's becoming that.
[01:55:59.925 --> 01:56:03.367]  It's so crazy, I can't even believe they've slipped this far.
[01:56:03.927 --> 01:56:09.051]  But let's go back to them trying to, again, equate that the guy said, you know, it takes two sides.
[01:56:10.674 --> 01:56:11.595]  Well, it's beyond that.
[01:56:11.655 --> 01:56:13.416]  They sent the Antifa to cause it.
[01:56:13.696 --> 01:56:18.099]  It doesn't mean I like the white supremacists, but separately they came to start the trouble.
[01:56:18.279 --> 01:56:20.241]  They're a horrible group of anti-free speech thugs.
[01:56:20.501 --> 01:56:25.825]  I'd put on the level or worse than the Nazis, because I don't see Nazis running around stopping free speech everywhere now.
[01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:27.146]  See?
[01:56:27.806 --> 01:56:29.267]  Oh my gosh, that's even more insensitive.
[01:56:29.287 --> 01:56:30.008]  You love Nazis.
[01:56:30.268 --> 01:56:30.829]  No, I don't!
[01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:32.430]  It's reality!
[01:56:34.636 --> 01:56:45.223]  That's so anti-white, so racist, so bigoted to have the ACLU apologize for having a two-year-old white baby on a page of their website with an American flag that made people get triggered.
[01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:48.762]  They said, you're right, you've taught us, thank you.
[01:56:48.982 --> 01:56:51.064]  We'll take it, you know, we'll put out a tweet.
[01:56:51.544 --> 01:56:52.465]  We can show their response.
[01:56:52.725 --> 01:56:56.307]  It's in our article by Steve Watson on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:56:56.327 --> 01:56:57.688]  But here's more of the CNN piece.
[01:56:58.748 --> 01:57:06.113]  And there would have been no violence whatsoever if there had not been counter-protesters showing up with baseball bats and helmets and masks.
[01:57:06.673 --> 01:57:08.334]  Mr. Trump, two hours later.
[01:57:08.614 --> 01:57:09.294]  Let me ask you this.
[01:57:09.334 --> 01:57:13.876]  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[01:57:14.436 --> 01:57:16.457]  Do they have any problem?
[01:57:16.497 --> 01:57:17.198]  I think they do.
[01:57:18.858 --> 01:57:22.580]  If those folks hadn't showed up, there would have been no violence.
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:31.304]  I believe they are much more hate-motivated than the people who wanted to gather and talk about preserving the Lee statue and preserving a white majority.
[01:57:31.636 --> 01:57:31.696]  4pm.
[01:57:31.716 --> 01:57:31.956]  Then this.
[01:57:49.585 --> 01:57:51.966]  When are we going to rename the capital city?
[01:57:52.487 --> 01:57:53.467]  Washington D.C.
[01:57:53.727 --> 01:57:54.708]  He was a slave owner.
[01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:59.411]  When are we going to write out of history the first seven of nine presidents?
[01:57:59.451 --> 01:58:01.912]  And then Trump mentions Washington too.
[01:58:01.932 --> 01:58:02.693]  Are they all going to come to us?
[01:58:02.713 --> 01:58:03.693]  Because it's common sense.
[01:58:03.713 --> 01:58:05.354]  George Washington was a slave owner.
[01:58:06.035 --> 01:58:07.696]  Was George Washington a slave owner?
[01:58:07.736 --> 01:58:08.396]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:58:09.697 --> 01:58:16.301]  It's total logic when the left already says take down Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and Al Sharpton had already called for it.
[01:58:18.547 --> 01:58:19.869]  That Trump's gonna say that!
[01:58:20.349 --> 01:58:22.852]  And the white nationalist guy has that point!
[01:58:23.052 --> 01:58:24.834]  I mean, take it all down?
[01:58:25.034 --> 01:58:25.755]  The American flag?
[01:58:26.075 --> 01:58:27.457]  Hell, they're in the flag of the world!
[01:58:27.797 --> 01:58:30.320]  They didn't have some slavery under it, that's how the world, the whole Bible!
[01:58:32.433 --> 01:58:35.256]  The Israelites used to have slaves.
[01:58:35.556 --> 01:58:36.918]  The Muslims still have them.
[01:58:37.378 --> 01:58:41.962]  It's just total mental illness because people have a lack of historical understanding.
[01:58:42.203 --> 01:58:44.425]  New big sales in fullwarrestore.com.

[02:00:13.344 --> 02:00:17.365]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:17.705 --> 02:00:21.127]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar,
[02:00:27.237 --> 02:00:30.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:30.998 --> 02:00:32.259]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.379 --> 02:00:35.360]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.440]  You know, I said I was going to put the phones up, and I'm a bad boy.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:38.141]  I didn't do that.
[02:00:38.781 --> 02:00:41.142]  But Antonio Sabata Jr.
[02:00:41.782 --> 02:00:43.082]  is going to be joining us for 30 minutes.
[02:00:43.162 --> 02:00:49.044]  After that, I'll take 30 minutes of calls on any of the issues that we've raised here, we've talked about.
[02:00:49.084 --> 02:00:51.865]  But here is the main takeaway.
[02:00:51.885 --> 02:00:53.846]  The globalists are moving towards a civil war.
[02:00:55.233 --> 02:00:58.454]  They admit they're doing that, and it's going to be a race war.
[02:00:58.995 --> 02:01:11.580]  And it's going to be a bunch of weird white people basically running it, fomenting it, hen-pecking it, asking people where they stand, not doing business with people that don't declare they love Hillary.
[02:01:12.401 --> 02:01:13.421]  It just goes on and on.
[02:01:13.461 --> 02:01:21.805]  So since we're talking about this in this short segment, before I come back into all this other news, I wanted to play a clip here of a joke video I did yesterday.
[02:01:23.294 --> 02:01:33.701]  Because you talk about annoying sounding, Hillary Clinton and her new book on tape, talk about the most grating voice.
[02:01:34.302 --> 02:01:36.604]  Why aren't I 60 points ahead, huh?
[02:01:39.045 --> 02:01:39.826]  It's incredible.
[02:01:41.462 --> 02:01:54.271]  So I put out this new video that talks about Hillary Clinton's secret phobia discovered because she's saying that Trump is so incredibly creepy and made her skin crawl.
[02:01:54.672 --> 02:01:57.454]  And so we discovered that Trump found out her phobia.
[02:01:57.494 --> 02:01:57.874]  Here it is.
[02:01:59.355 --> 02:02:05.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got shocking exclusive footage for you of Hillary Clinton.
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:09.523]  She came out today, we're going to show you a clip, and said that
[02:02:10.683 --> 02:02:14.946]  In the debates, Trump made her skin crawl.
[02:02:15.706 --> 02:02:17.908]  He was literally breathing down my neck.
[02:02:18.568 --> 02:02:20.089]  My skin crawled.
[02:02:20.970 --> 02:02:24.112]  Now remember, this is a lady that's funded wars, the Arab Spring.
[02:02:24.732 --> 02:02:30.016]  This is a lady who represented pedophiles, who stole the money from Haitian children.
[02:02:30.596 --> 02:02:32.698]  But why did she say her skin crawled?
[02:02:33.498 --> 02:02:36.720]  Because she has a serious phobia.
[02:02:38.021 --> 02:02:38.742]  It's quite common.
[02:02:40.643 --> 02:02:47.408]  She did not like Donald Trump at one of the press dinners early on watching her eat.
[02:02:48.429 --> 02:02:53.552]  That's Hillary's big phobia, is that if you see her eating, it makes her skin crawl.
[02:02:54.093 --> 02:02:55.534]  So here's a clip of Hillary right now.
[02:03:06.202 --> 02:03:06.702]  You like that?
[02:03:09.657 --> 02:03:11.739]  If the Russians could act my subconscious.
[02:03:17.485 --> 02:03:20.087]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:03:25.873 --> 02:03:30.337]  Can we see Hillary having lunch one more time please?
[02:03:30.357 --> 02:03:32.599]  Can we back that up a little bit?
[02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:36.802]  Now granted, she's only been taped eating once.
[02:03:36.822 --> 02:03:37.962]  This was when she was a little bit younger.
[02:03:38.562 --> 02:03:45.585]  But if you're a radio listener, the name of the video is Hillary's New Book Reveals Her Secret Phobia.
[02:03:46.365 --> 02:03:52.547]  But let's just play, maybe in slow motion if we could, Hillary Clinton enjoying a meal.
[02:03:52.567 --> 02:03:54.188]  Here is the footage.
[02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:00.530]  Ah, delicious!
[02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:02.390]  Oh yeah!
[02:04:02.671 --> 02:04:03.911]  Ah, spirit cooking!
[02:04:07.702 --> 02:04:08.702]  Oh man, Uma.
[02:04:08.762 --> 02:04:10.263]  Uma, actually?
[02:04:14.644 --> 02:04:15.925]  I gotta have some fun around here.
[02:04:16.565 --> 02:04:17.225]  I thought of that.
[02:04:20.706 --> 02:04:21.446]  These people.
[02:04:22.146 --> 02:04:26.468]  There's just no end to this authoritarianism and the mental illness of them wanting to run everybody's lives.
[02:04:27.508 --> 02:04:29.088]  I don't even want to run my own life, hardly.
[02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:30.729]  I just get so tired of them.
[02:04:31.613 --> 02:04:32.034]  Alright, 800-259-9231.
[02:04:32.054 --> 02:04:32.094]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:32.154 --> 02:04:37.339]  Your calls are coming up as we do two segment interviews with a man running for Congress, Antonio Sabato Jr., famous actor.
[02:04:45.964 --> 02:04:53.047]  A lot of big projects going, putting it all on the line to be persecuted to support Trump during the campaign and beyond.
[02:04:53.628 --> 02:04:55.429]  Now running for Congress.
[02:04:56.529 --> 02:04:58.430]  That is very, very exciting.
[02:04:58.470 --> 02:05:01.492]  Running for the 26th district congressional seat in California.
[02:05:01.772 --> 02:05:02.172]  Stay with us.
[02:05:05.405 --> 02:05:07.286]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[02:05:07.326 --> 02:05:08.727]  He's been traveling the world.
[02:05:08.747 --> 02:05:11.328]  They've had arrest warrants out for him.
[02:05:11.368 --> 02:05:14.009]  They want him arrested here in the United States.
[02:05:14.129 --> 02:05:22.733]  The governor of New York wants him arrested because he dare questions Al Gore when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying and can't swim.
[02:05:23.893 --> 02:05:24.774]  New York and L.A.
[02:05:24.794 --> 02:05:28.055]  would be underwater by 2013 because the ice caps were gonna melt.
[02:05:28.195 --> 02:05:29.856]  Actually, Antarctic's at record levels.
[02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:33.018]  But they don't care because they can defraud the public.
[02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:37.760]  But recently, in Australia, he ran into Albert Gore.
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:41.402]  The guy that told us Naftan Gat was great and wanted us to have the TPP.
[02:05:41.722 --> 02:05:45.924]  The guy who uses 34 times what anybody, you know, uses on average in Tennessee.
[02:05:46.385 --> 02:05:49.086]  At one of his gigantor mansions on a lake.
[02:05:49.406 --> 02:05:54.633]  With gigantor boats and gigantor monster trucks and gigantor everything.
[02:05:54.693 --> 02:05:58.398]  But it's okay, because he's an elitist blubberbot.
[02:05:58.698 --> 02:06:04.225]  So here's the evil criminal, Mark Moreno, daring to even speak to the guru.
[02:06:04.325 --> 02:06:04.726]  Here it is.
[02:06:07.963 --> 02:06:10.465]  Can I ask how you got in here?
[02:06:10.525 --> 02:06:12.287]  We've got double scum with us here.
[02:06:12.307 --> 02:06:20.473]  They dare talk to one of the greatest con artists on earth.
[02:06:20.553 --> 02:06:23.775]  How dare you speak to the royal highness?
[02:06:33.923 --> 02:06:35.845]  You're on fit to groom his stool.
[02:06:36.145 --> 02:06:41.229]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, what do you say for yourself?
[02:06:42.751 --> 02:06:44.312]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:06:45.373 --> 02:06:55.902]  Yes, I was in Australia, we were in Melbourne, Australia, and I had to sit through an hour and a half presentation by Al Gore previewing his new sequel, number one.
[02:06:55.922 --> 02:07:01.507]  Number two, we had to wait because Al Gore's devious plan included allowing the
[02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:02.427]  We're good to go.
[02:07:17.757 --> 02:07:23.578]  Al Gore gives this presentation that's all anecdotal, just claptrap, and then immediately walks off the stage.
[02:07:23.618 --> 02:07:28.259]  He doesn't even take a single question after people paid $500 plus a head.
[02:07:28.279 --> 02:07:32.280]  He had no time for question and answer, so that's why I decided to follow him out.
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:33.520]  I was able to get that.
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:36.541]  He was all friendly when he thought I was nice, when he knew who I was.
[02:07:36.981 --> 02:07:44.122]  He literally just brushed me off, kept walking, and departed in his Lexus waiting SUV outside in the parking garage.
[02:07:44.645 --> 02:07:47.586]  And I love how there's some redhead lady toting behind.
[02:07:47.946 --> 02:07:50.587]  She's looking at him, breathing heavy, that she's just near him.
[02:07:51.027 --> 02:07:55.789]  Uh, uh, the guru, uh, I saw him sneeze.
[02:07:55.849 --> 02:07:58.229]  Some of his snot went in my mouth.
[02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:02.891]  And then she looks at you just like, uh, uh, uh, all right.
[02:08:15.171 --> 02:08:20.337]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:20.838 --> 02:08:26.825]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.226 --> 02:08:33.514]  Well this morning I was working out and I had Fox News on analyzing it and seeing how more and more they're going against the president.
[02:08:34.625 --> 02:08:42.068]  More and more not supporting him, so it gets rarer and rarer to see a nice, shining face on there, actually pointing out some common sense.
[02:08:42.148 --> 02:08:53.612]  But the hosts of that program were Antonio Sabato Jr., famous actor, you name it, the guy that early on was supporting Trump, is running for Congress, the 26th District of California.
[02:08:54.358 --> 02:08:57.140]  Against the horrible person I won't mention.
[02:08:57.841 --> 02:08:59.982]  And it was just great to see him up there.
[02:09:00.062 --> 02:09:01.904]  And I was like, wow, that guy came on a few months ago.
[02:09:01.924 --> 02:09:03.205]  I'm already a fan of his work.
[02:09:03.625 --> 02:09:07.448]  And then I did a little bit of Googling and found out that he's doing pretty good in the polls.
[02:09:07.868 --> 02:09:08.569]  Raising some money.
[02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:09.589]  There's a lot of excitement.
[02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:13.913]  I mean, if we can't elect this guy, he could be our next Ronald Reagan down the road.
[02:09:14.253 --> 02:09:15.334]  We can't elect anybody.
[02:09:15.394 --> 02:09:22.359]  The problem is, they're running around like chickens on PCP with their heads halfway cut off.
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:26.663]  Just screaming white supremacist, white supremacist, white supremacist.
[02:09:27.003 --> 02:09:34.410]  The ACLU apologized for tweeting an image of a white baby with an American flag and then they said we're sorry, it is racist.
[02:09:35.475 --> 02:09:38.237]  And people talked about wanting to kill the baby because it's white?
[02:09:39.058 --> 02:09:41.961]  I never even heard the KKK dirtballs talk like that.
[02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:43.022]  And here's CNN.
[02:09:43.182 --> 02:09:45.243]  Ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:57.714]  We're not hearing anything about the hundreds run over by Islamists or something like 30-something people stabbed to death in Russia and Germany and France and Belgium and Spain the last week.
[02:09:58.195 --> 02:09:59.656]  I mean, it's just the back of the paper.
[02:10:00.136 --> 02:10:02.658]  Oh, seven stabbed here, nine stabbed here, three stabbed there.
[02:10:03.399 --> 02:10:12.147]  But don't worry, ACLU, when your Twitter followers educate you, it's time to say thank you to them for letting you know that you were being racist.
[02:10:12.167 --> 02:10:12.907]  Let's put that back up.
[02:10:13.208 --> 02:10:22.296]  When your Twitter followers keep you in check and remind you that white supremacy is everywhere, then it has Kermit the Frog saying, thank you, that's a very good point.
[02:10:22.476 --> 02:10:23.397]  I'm not kidding.
[02:10:23.657 --> 02:10:25.979]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go see it for yourself.
[02:10:25.999 --> 02:10:27.840]  We've retweeted it at Real Alex Jones.
[02:10:30.049 --> 02:10:35.710]  You know how the Democrats with CIA people like Phil Mudd saying we're getting ready to kill the president.
[02:10:36.571 --> 02:10:39.851]  We're getting ready to have a civil war and or he's mentally ill.
[02:10:39.911 --> 02:10:41.552]  He's got early onset of dementia.
[02:10:41.752 --> 02:10:46.273]  We told you three months ago that we had folks inside a major newspaper editorial meeting.
[02:10:46.973 --> 02:10:52.094]  We had a source and they said no that that was the next thing to come right before they try to overthrow him.
[02:10:52.554 --> 02:10:53.635]  So here's the deal.
[02:10:53.795 --> 02:10:55.555]  They're not going to let us have this political realignment.
[02:10:55.835 --> 02:11:04.780]  The Democrats are becoming an extinct party because of Nancy Pelosi, because of all these out-of-touch, senile people.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.060]  You talk about dementia.
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:21.068]  She said like 20-something times that I've seen personally that George W. Bush is still the president, and then she goes, I mean, uh, uh, uh, and then the same press conference Maxine Waters goes, that Putin and Trump have just attacked Korea!
[02:11:22.236 --> 02:11:23.616]  Everyone's like, ma'am, that's not true.
[02:11:23.636 --> 02:11:24.477]  She's like, yes, he did.
[02:11:24.917 --> 02:11:27.838]  I mean, these people don't know what planet they're on.
[02:11:28.398 --> 02:11:33.139]  So to have a smart, entrepreneurial, hardworking guy who's got courage to back Trump.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.760]  Boy, I tell you, I was on the streets of Seattle.
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:37.961]  They were physically attacking me last week.
[02:11:39.001 --> 02:11:40.702]  Screaming Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[02:11:40.742 --> 02:11:41.842]  I mean, just the craziest.
[02:11:43.172 --> 02:11:43.933]  Moronville!
[02:11:44.454 --> 02:11:54.145]  But the answer is, America's faced tyrants and bullies before, and we're going to stand against these folks without violence, with unity, as Martin Luther King said, not what color your skin is, but
[02:11:55.293 --> 02:11:57.574]  What the content of your deeds are.
[02:11:58.295 --> 02:11:59.735]  And that's exactly what this is about.
[02:11:59.755 --> 02:12:12.162]  We're going to go back to the real unity that America helps spread around the world of Martin Luther King and others, not the false one, but I want to ask just, I mean the waterfront, how he thinks Trump's doing, where he thinks this is going, how the congressional run is going.
[02:12:12.202 --> 02:12:18.546]  Antonio Sabato Jr., voteantonio.com, facebook.com forward slash Antonio Sabato Jr.
[02:12:18.626 --> 02:12:18.886]  live.
[02:12:19.326 --> 02:12:22.048]  I gotta ask him too, has he been censored yet on Twitter and Facebook?
[02:12:22.388 --> 02:12:25.770]  They are really trying to block anybody that doesn't hate America.
[02:12:26.211 --> 02:12:27.111]  So thank you for joining us.
[02:12:27.972 --> 02:12:28.372]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:28.392 --> 02:12:29.172]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:12:29.192 --> 02:12:30.013]  It's good to be back.
[02:12:30.533 --> 02:12:31.674]  Just the waterfront.
[02:12:31.694 --> 02:12:33.115]  You heard my last four-minute rant.
[02:12:33.435 --> 02:12:34.516]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:12:34.576 --> 02:12:37.498]  I mean, how's it been for you running for Congress since you announced?
[02:12:39.508 --> 02:12:40.769]  Well, I've been running really good.
[02:12:40.789 --> 02:12:50.836]  I've been talking to all the folks out here in Ventura County, my community, from the police officers who I adore, I respect, our firefighters, teachers, our Latino community.
[02:12:51.457 --> 02:12:52.438]  They're all supporting me.
[02:12:52.498 --> 02:12:57.301]  We're going to win big because we have to win big for our state of California, for our country.
[02:12:57.642 --> 02:12:59.563]  We are losing our country every single day.
[02:12:59.943 --> 02:13:03.206]  The Democratic Party, which, by the way, is not a Democratic Party anymore.
[02:13:03.246 --> 02:13:04.306]  It's a socialist party.
[02:13:04.747 --> 02:13:06.168]  It's controlling everything.
[02:13:06.188 --> 02:13:07.249]  It's controlling the media.
[02:13:07.509 --> 02:13:08.910]  It's controlling Hollywood, by the way.
[02:13:09.210 --> 02:13:09.691]  We're good to go.
[02:13:25.805 --> 02:13:40.798]  Aren't we in solidarity, yourself, myself, Trump, Sheriff Arpaio, countless others, that just follow the law, do the right thing, try to unify the country, try to get the stock market going again, try to take care of the veterans, try to actually block radical Islamists who are unvetted from coming in.
[02:13:41.019 --> 02:13:43.421]  Just common sense, default stuff.
[02:13:43.801 --> 02:13:50.968]  You know, Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that Trump's travel ban was absolutely constitutional, and then we all get boycotted, attacked, death-threatened.
[02:13:51.869 --> 02:13:58.959]  But really, that makes us brothers and sisters that we're going through the gauntlet because freedom's never free, but it shows us how high the stakes are.
[02:13:59.259 --> 02:14:01.081]  We're dealing with true authoritarians.
[02:14:02.312 --> 02:14:06.674]  We're dealing with, you know, we've got to keep our Constitution, our Second Amendment, you know, the Bill of Rights.
[02:14:06.734 --> 02:14:07.574]  Those are great things.
[02:14:07.614 --> 02:14:11.916]  You know, we live in the greatest country in the world where the laws actually work.
[02:14:12.356 --> 02:14:14.857]  The laws on the books actually work and make sense.
[02:14:15.257 --> 02:14:24.361]  And these people on the left and the mainstream media try all the time, from Pelosi to everybody across the board, they try all the time to change the laws so it can suit them.
[02:14:24.901 --> 02:14:26.781]  They take so much money from the lobbyists.
[02:14:27.122 --> 02:14:31.102]  What I've seen in Washington, I've been there many times now, and I'm going to go there and fight for this.
[02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:36.264]  They're working so hard for the lobbyists, they're taking so much money, and the people are the last in line.
[02:14:36.304 --> 02:14:37.564]  The veterans get nothing.
[02:14:37.984 --> 02:14:42.525]  The people of this country who pay taxes every single day get nothing in return from this party.
[02:14:42.905 --> 02:14:44.105]  They should be a disgrace.
[02:14:44.125 --> 02:14:47.426]  They should not even go to work every day because of what they do.
[02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:50.967]  Notice Trump, day one in office,
[02:14:52.971 --> 02:14:57.997]  Yeah.
[02:14:58.497 --> 02:14:59.979]  Our president cannot be controlled.
[02:15:00.539 --> 02:15:07.487]  You know, we have characters in the Republican Party who had the chance to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they didn't do it.
[02:15:07.787 --> 02:15:08.688]  What a disgrace.
[02:15:09.089 --> 02:15:13.754]  You know, we've been waiting so long to get this done, and all of a sudden we had a chance of a lifetime.
[02:15:14.130 --> 02:15:17.031]  And they're doing it because they're fighting for the other party.
[02:15:17.352 --> 02:15:19.152]  They're fighting against our president.
[02:15:19.593 --> 02:15:26.716]  So I say to everybody out there, all the people that love this country, stand with our president because there's lies and they're going to keep lying.
[02:15:26.736 --> 02:15:28.977]  They're going to make stuff up every single day.
[02:15:28.997 --> 02:15:34.880]  And we got to stand for our president, because if you stand for our president, you stand for the America that we all love.
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.801]  And so we got to stand up to it and we can't give up.
[02:15:38.041 --> 02:15:39.342]  We've got to fight till the end.
[02:15:39.642 --> 02:15:40.942]  And I'm going to fight all year long.
[02:15:40.982 --> 02:15:42.343]  I have fundraisers going on.
[02:15:42.703 --> 02:15:53.369]  I'm talking to people, I'm working day and night, and like I said, I'm making no money at all, so please donate to my cause, VoteAntoni.com, every single day.
[02:15:53.809 --> 02:15:56.750]  Whatever you can donate, I'll take it, because we need to win.
[02:15:56.770 --> 02:15:58.091]  This is really, really important.
[02:15:58.391 --> 02:16:00.912]  Absolutely, and you have hit TV shows, hit movies.
[02:16:01.132 --> 02:16:02.112]  We're doing very, very well.
[02:16:02.172 --> 02:16:05.753]  You knew what you were doing, so I've talked to a lot of other high-level producers, you name it.
[02:16:06.353 --> 02:16:10.694]  They even find out you talk at a cocktail party that you're a conservative, a Christian libertarian.
[02:16:11.074 --> 02:16:11.994]  You're ostracized.
[02:16:12.034 --> 02:16:16.155]  It's very cult-like now, and Trump has lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:16:16.435 --> 02:16:17.975]  They're harassing his renters now.
[02:16:18.255 --> 02:16:22.196]  They're going after his whole family, and we've just got to really admire the fact that
[02:16:23.036 --> 02:16:28.101]  400 billion in new jobs, 1.5 million new jobs, 4 trillion in the stock market.
[02:16:28.481 --> 02:16:30.663]  He's delivered on everything he could executively.
[02:16:30.703 --> 02:16:41.673]  Killing the TPP, renegotiating these deals, and they are so angry and it's just so honorable to finally see somebody that just keeps doing what they said they would do.
[02:16:42.314 --> 02:16:45.377]  What do you make of them on CNN and stuff saying they want to kill him?
[02:16:46.508 --> 02:16:48.249]  Well, listen, they should go to jail.
[02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:51.411]  They should be arrested for what they're saying and what they're talking about.
[02:16:51.811 --> 02:16:53.072]  But the ratings are showing.
[02:16:53.252 --> 02:17:00.056]  I mean, listen, they're losing a lot of viewers every single day because the American people are sick and tired of these lies.
[02:17:00.616 --> 02:17:03.978]  I mean, now they're taking statues down.
[02:17:04.058 --> 02:17:06.679]  And I talk to people all the time from the left and from the right.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:07.820]  Statues
[02:17:08.607 --> 02:17:13.271]  Remember, those are memories that reminds us of the good and the bad that happened in the past.
[02:17:13.491 --> 02:17:15.012]  Should we take down the Colosseum?
[02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:18.996]  Because, you know, back in the day where I'm from in Rome, the Colosseum killed a lot of Christians.
[02:17:19.416 --> 02:17:21.518]  So should we just destroy the Colosseum?
[02:17:21.538 --> 02:17:25.721]  Should we destroy everything that stands to remind us about what we've been through?
[02:17:25.741 --> 02:17:29.004]  I mean, I lost people, my family members at Auschwitz.
[02:17:29.668 --> 02:17:31.289]  You know, through the war.
[02:17:31.569 --> 02:17:33.090]  You know, I'm an Italian Jew.
[02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:34.771]  I'm proud of my heritage.
[02:17:34.811 --> 02:17:39.394]  I'm proud of the fact that I came to this country and worked my butt off trying to be an American.
[02:17:39.735 --> 02:17:45.798]  And imagine if I was having a production company and I was making movies and I would only hire Republicans.
[02:17:46.839 --> 02:17:48.120]  I would never hire a Democrat.
[02:17:48.695 --> 02:17:52.236]  I would never work again on top of that.
[02:17:52.296 --> 02:17:53.236]  I mean, it would be crazy.
[02:17:53.256 --> 02:17:54.296]  So that's what they're doing.
[02:17:54.316 --> 02:17:55.317]  Hollywood is doing that.
[02:17:55.677 --> 02:17:56.877]  And it's so unfair.
[02:17:56.957 --> 02:17:59.177]  And I'm fighting for that because they're bullying people.
[02:17:59.478 --> 02:18:02.138]  They're telling people what they should believe and what they shouldn't believe.
[02:18:02.638 --> 02:18:04.219]  I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:18:04.459 --> 02:18:05.539]  I believe in this country.
[02:18:05.779 --> 02:18:07.679]  And I'm a Republican and I'm in Hollywood.
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:08.600]  You don't want to hire me?
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.760]  Well, I'm going for Congress.
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:11.080]  I'm going to fight for the American people.
[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:11.680]  I'm going to win this.
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:13.821]  And I'm coming back at you stronger than ever.
[02:18:14.201 --> 02:18:17.567]  That's right, and I made the same point, but yours is better with the Coliseum.
[02:18:18.067 --> 02:18:20.572]  Should we tear down the pyramids, because slaves built the pyramids?
[02:18:20.592 --> 02:18:21.052]  Shut it down!
[02:18:21.795 --> 02:18:21.955]  Right.
[02:18:22.015 --> 02:18:22.736]  Tear it all down.
[02:18:22.796 --> 02:18:23.577]  Tear everything down.
[02:18:23.597 --> 02:18:24.658]  This is just an excuse.
[02:18:24.678 --> 02:18:25.919]  Well, it's the same thing in Rome.
[02:18:26.079 --> 02:18:30.823]  I love going to different museums of the Vatican where they've got hundreds of busts of different Romans.
[02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:33.245]  Some were tyrants, some were good, some were bad.
[02:18:33.586 --> 02:18:34.246]  It doesn't matter.
[02:18:34.286 --> 02:18:35.207]  It's a piece of history.
[02:18:35.427 --> 02:18:38.230]  You know, I told folks, don't tear down the Lenin statue in Seattle.
[02:18:38.770 --> 02:18:39.511]  That's interesting.
[02:18:39.791 --> 02:18:43.454]  We ought to have whole statue gardens of you decide who's good, who's bad.
[02:18:43.675 --> 02:18:44.876]  That is history right there.
[02:18:46.328 --> 02:18:51.416]  And Alex, who is the most racist party in the history of this country?
[02:18:51.636 --> 02:18:52.698]  The Democratic Party.
[02:18:53.399 --> 02:18:56.404]  I was about to say, the Democrats want to pull down their history and then blame Trump.
[02:18:57.608 --> 02:18:59.009]  Yeah, it's all Trump's fault.
[02:18:59.049 --> 02:19:00.930]  Listen, we have a president and I respect him.
[02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:01.891]  He's a businessman.
[02:19:01.931 --> 02:19:04.352]  He's going to change people around in his cabinet.
[02:19:04.532 --> 02:19:05.433]  It's the way it is.
[02:19:05.693 --> 02:19:09.295]  He wants this country to succeed and be on top again.
[02:19:09.335 --> 02:19:10.376]  He's already doing that.
[02:19:10.456 --> 02:19:13.197]  It's not even been a year and he's going to keep doing that.
[02:19:13.297 --> 02:19:15.299]  So there's people who don't like that.
[02:19:15.819 --> 02:19:17.080]  But look at the last eight years.
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:18.240]  Look at the debt.
[02:19:18.481 --> 02:19:21.062]  Look at the things that our last president did to this country.
[02:19:21.623 --> 02:19:22.643]  The damage that he did.
[02:19:22.703 --> 02:19:23.764]  Now we're trying to fix it.
[02:19:23.904 --> 02:19:25.585]  So we got to stand together.
[02:19:26.423 --> 02:19:29.365]  Uh, as one, because our future, this country, is at stake.
[02:19:29.925 --> 02:19:30.265]  That's right.
[02:19:30.325 --> 02:19:33.347]  One more segment with our guest, Antonio Sabato Jr.
[02:19:33.407 --> 02:19:34.667]  VoteAntonio.com.
[02:19:35.188 --> 02:19:38.570]  Uh, he wants to get in there and defend the Republic, and that's what I was seeing in polls and numbers.
[02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:44.413]  They're saying you've got a really good shot, even in, uh, you know, that area to win, if there isn't too much election fraud.
[02:19:44.673 --> 02:19:49.515]  So let's talk about that, because the Democrats in all these special elections have had five of them now.
[02:19:49.896 --> 02:19:52.317]  They've lost every one of them, showing.
[02:19:52.757 --> 02:19:56.146]  That the people know a frob and they see it and they know fake polls.
[02:19:56.567 --> 02:19:58.391]  Just like they had fake polls during the campaign.
[02:19:58.411 --> 02:19:59.955]  Just like they had fake polls during 2016.
[02:19:59.995 --> 02:20:00.677]  It's even worse now.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:07.202]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.222 --> 02:20:14.089]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[02:20:14.169 --> 02:20:16.972]  So we're already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[02:20:17.132 --> 02:20:18.093]  Tommy, welcome back.
[02:20:18.234 --> 02:20:18.694]  Hello, Paul.
[02:20:18.754 --> 02:20:19.415]  Thanks for having me.
[02:20:19.435 --> 02:20:20.116]  Good to have you back.
[02:20:20.156 --> 02:20:27.804]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terror attack,
[02:20:27.864 --> 02:20:30.526]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[02:20:30.607 --> 02:20:35.771]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[02:20:35.871 --> 02:20:39.555]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[02:20:39.695 --> 02:20:46.661]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:20:46.861 --> 02:20:54.228]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[02:20:56.118 --> 02:20:57.179]  We see this every year.
[02:20:57.359 --> 02:20:57.800]  We see it.
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:58.441]  What's it called?
[02:20:58.481 --> 02:21:00.082]  The Ramadan Bonafide.
[02:21:06.527 --> 02:21:24.714]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[02:21:25.134 --> 02:21:27.055]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[02:21:27.757 --> 02:21:34.520]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.602]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[02:21:37.902 --> 02:21:45.085]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[02:21:46.411 --> 02:21:48.512]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[02:21:48.592 --> 02:21:52.294]  The details are, young Muslim men, they stopped a Muslim man.
[02:21:52.354 --> 02:21:53.435]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[02:21:53.655 --> 02:21:54.455]  And he said, Muslim.
[02:21:54.715 --> 02:21:55.956]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[02:21:56.576 --> 02:21:58.778]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[02:21:59.178 --> 02:22:00.098]  He said, they left him.
[02:22:00.398 --> 02:22:01.079]  They walked on.
[02:22:01.299 --> 02:22:02.219]  They stopped the next man.
[02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:03.360]  What religion are you?
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:04.221]  I'm Christian.
[02:22:04.421 --> 02:22:04.741]  Bang.
[02:22:05.101 --> 02:22:06.021]  They violently beat him.
[02:22:06.041 --> 02:22:07.282]  His girlfriend tried to stop him.
[02:22:07.502 --> 02:22:09.884]  These weren't just hate crimes where there's a group attacking a man.
[02:22:10.164 --> 02:22:12.585]  They're attacking men who are with their partners, with their girlfriends.
[02:22:12.965 --> 02:22:28.515]  If the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets, asking Muslims if they were Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously, that would be a national outrage as it is.
[02:22:28.875 --> 02:22:32.257]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section.
[02:22:32.698 --> 02:22:35.399]  And these guys, Tommy, they're going to be in jail.
[02:22:35.419 --> 02:22:36.940]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[02:22:38.121 --> 02:22:43.964]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months, and no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[02:22:44.004 --> 02:22:53.629]  Can anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because this is what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[02:22:53.869 --> 02:22:56.071]  And when they said yes, they were all violently beaten.
[02:22:56.091 --> 02:22:56.651]  Could you imagine?
[02:22:57.311 --> 02:22:57.812]  Imagine!
[02:22:57.832 --> 02:23:02.334]  It wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.

[02:24:14.532 --> 02:24:18.615]  It's a final segment with our guest Antonio Sabata Jr.
[02:24:18.815 --> 02:24:19.455]  VoteAntonio.com.
[02:24:19.475 --> 02:24:25.099]  I want to get him back up for a full hour in the near future if he can do it to really cover the issues and where he stands on policies.
[02:24:25.119 --> 02:24:27.341]  But I've heard his speeches, seen what he talks about.
[02:24:27.361 --> 02:24:31.103]  We should talk a little bit this next five, six minutes about what he'll do if he gets in Congress.
[02:24:31.403 --> 02:24:39.108]  But also the fact that it's exciting to see that Republicans have been winning all the special elections, which bodes very well for the midterms coming up next year.
[02:24:39.449 --> 02:24:41.430]  But that's why the Democrats are so scared.
[02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:50.298]  Acting like Trump's a big failure and all of us are about to, you know, be arrested for being in the KKK is because this party is committing political suicide.
[02:24:50.338 --> 02:24:57.044]  They are so crazy now, literally saying that just every white person is in the KKK.
[02:24:57.445 --> 02:24:58.486]  Where do you see this going?
[02:24:59.936 --> 02:25:02.378]  I don't see it going in the right direction.
[02:25:02.478 --> 02:25:03.619]  It's not positive at all.
[02:25:03.679 --> 02:25:05.120]  These people are making stories up.
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.503]  Now they left the Russian stuff that they were worrying so much and they were fighting for.
[02:25:10.543 --> 02:25:11.404]  Now there's something else.
[02:25:11.424 --> 02:25:12.244]  There'll be something else.
[02:25:12.264 --> 02:25:14.546]  They'll make stories up and they'll continue to lie.
[02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:17.268]  And the mainstream media should be blamed for everything.
[02:25:17.568 --> 02:25:18.709]  They should not even be working.
[02:25:19.029 --> 02:25:21.791]  Especially like, you know, like CNN should be gone.
[02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:23.992]  Never return for the things that they have done.
[02:25:24.012 --> 02:25:28.175]  And they continue to do that because they care only about the Democratic Party and that's it.
[02:25:28.495 --> 02:25:29.616]  And the Socialist Party by the way.
[02:25:30.676 --> 02:25:31.496]  What happened to them?
[02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:32.697]  I mean, they are whacked out.
[02:25:33.817 --> 02:25:34.477]  They're whacked out.
[02:25:34.517 --> 02:25:36.097]  Listen, Al, I don't know what's going on here.
[02:25:36.117 --> 02:25:37.658]  I mean, because this is a lot of ego.
[02:25:37.958 --> 02:25:41.499]  There's a lot of people here in government that make a lot of money.
[02:25:41.979 --> 02:25:43.879]  I mean, let's not kid ourselves.
[02:25:43.959 --> 02:25:44.859]  They're making a lot of money.
[02:25:44.899 --> 02:25:51.401]  They're multi-millionaires, and they're traveling in their private jets, and they're complaining about this and that, but it's about money.
[02:25:52.057 --> 02:25:52.818]  It's about power.
[02:25:53.099 --> 02:25:54.020]  And it's about ego.
[02:25:54.221 --> 02:25:55.503]  It's not about the American people.
[02:25:55.883 --> 02:25:58.187]  The American people should be first in line.
[02:25:58.608 --> 02:26:02.914]  These governmental people, these people in government should be working for the American people.
[02:26:02.934 --> 02:26:03.796]  But it's the other way around.
[02:26:04.457 --> 02:26:07.639]  The American people are paying way too much taxes, especially in California.
[02:26:07.679 --> 02:26:09.661]  This state is going to go bankrupt.
[02:26:10.121 --> 02:26:16.886]  And the Democratic Party wants it to go bankrupt because the more turmoil, the more chaos there is around people, the better they feel.
[02:26:17.407 --> 02:26:18.768]  Because they want bigger government.
[02:26:18.788 --> 02:26:22.971]  They want to help the people, so-called help the people, but they're not helping anybody.
[02:26:22.991 --> 02:26:25.312]  They're just helping themselves.
[02:26:25.353 --> 02:26:25.973]  And they're selfish.
[02:26:26.373 --> 02:26:28.035]  And Antonio, that's not your opinion.
[02:26:29.548 --> 02:26:42.818]  Ezekiel Emanuel, Pocahontas, all those folks, Elizabeth Warren, admit the plan was to bankrupt healthcare and totally socialize it, and they're wrecking it on purpose while tripling prices and bankrupting the economy.
[02:26:43.038 --> 02:26:45.080]  I mean, they're like super villains!
[02:26:46.135 --> 02:26:46.896]  They're super villains.
[02:26:46.936 --> 02:26:47.657]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:47.677 --> 02:26:49.058]  They're trying to destroy this country.
[02:26:49.459 --> 02:26:53.863]  And like I said, there's more turmoil, there's more chaos, there's more negative among people.
[02:26:54.344 --> 02:26:56.346]  There's more division, the better for them.
[02:26:56.506 --> 02:26:58.248]  So they can say, I can help you now.
[02:26:58.288 --> 02:26:59.890]  But you're doing really good in the polls.
[02:27:00.410 --> 02:27:04.575]  Why are you connecting so well with people there in a hardcore Democrat area?
[02:27:05.333 --> 02:27:06.553]  Because I'm not a politician.
[02:27:07.054 --> 02:27:07.754]  I'm a real guy.
[02:27:07.834 --> 02:27:09.434]  I'm going to go to Washington.
[02:27:09.454 --> 02:27:10.555]  I'm going to talk to the President.
[02:27:10.575 --> 02:27:11.655]  I'm going to talk to both parties.
[02:27:11.695 --> 02:27:13.636]  I'm not afraid of the Democratic Party.
[02:27:13.656 --> 02:27:14.456]  I'm not afraid of them.
[02:27:14.856 --> 02:27:20.198]  Because they have their college degrees, and they have their money, and they have their private jets, and they have their Secret Service, and this and that.
[02:27:20.218 --> 02:27:21.038]  I'm not afraid of them.
[02:27:21.398 --> 02:27:22.839]  I am here for the American people.
[02:27:22.879 --> 02:27:23.859]  I put everything on the line.
[02:27:23.899 --> 02:27:24.679]  I've been through a lot.
[02:27:24.719 --> 02:27:26.240]  I'm a tough kid from Italy, man.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:29.581]  I can fight till the end, and these guys got nothing.
[02:27:30.301 --> 02:27:32.062]  You got to bring a whole bunch of people.
[02:27:32.082 --> 02:27:34.503]  You got to bring a whole army to fight me because I want to win.
[02:27:34.903 --> 02:27:36.643]  I actually live in my community.
[02:27:36.764 --> 02:27:39.324]  I actually have my kids to go to school in this community.
[02:27:39.805 --> 02:27:41.345]  My opponent has not lived here.
[02:27:41.405 --> 02:27:43.586]  She doesn't know about the Latino community.
[02:27:43.606 --> 02:27:46.287]  She doesn't know about the families that are suffering from addiction.
[02:27:47.087 --> 02:27:49.868]  Overwhelming from you talking about heroin addiction.
[02:27:49.948 --> 02:27:53.029]  It's taking over the country and especially my community.
[02:27:53.049 --> 02:27:54.070]  They're not talking about that.
[02:27:54.270 --> 02:27:56.531]  They're not talking about passing laws like AB 109.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:02.104]  Early prisoner release that is causing a lot of home invasion, a lot of crime.
[02:28:03.245 --> 02:28:04.306]  They're not talking about that.
[02:28:04.806 --> 02:28:08.610]  Listen, we are in a time right now where we can get our country back.
[02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:13.454]  This is the only county, Alex, in California, winnable.
[02:28:14.455 --> 02:28:15.336]  And I can win this.
[02:28:15.976 --> 02:28:17.738]  So if we get this county red again,
[02:28:18.243 --> 02:28:22.648]  Then we can maybe, down the line, get our state back right again like it used to be.
[02:28:22.949 --> 02:28:25.111]  And we can bring the state back to where it should be.
[02:28:25.492 --> 02:28:27.715]  Yeah, everybody talks about that the state is doing well.
[02:28:27.755 --> 02:28:28.636]  It's not doing well.
[02:28:28.916 --> 02:28:30.678]  This state is doing extremely bad.
[02:28:30.958 --> 02:28:31.039]  Sure.
[02:28:31.059 --> 02:28:32.160]  And it's going to file bankruptcy.
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:33.722]  It's going to go straight into the ocean.
[02:28:33.962 --> 02:28:36.303]  Well, I agree, and the best defense is an offense.
[02:28:36.543 --> 02:28:38.484]  The democratic system creates a hell.
[02:28:38.924 --> 02:28:49.708]  We need people like you that are smart, handsome, focused, fearless, dedicated, there to create an island, a beachhead, to then start waking people up sector by sector.
[02:28:50.088 --> 02:28:52.129]  So folks, you need to go to VoteAntonio.com.
[02:28:52.389 --> 02:29:01.733]  How do people on the ground, though, we have six or seven stations in California, we're on in Southern California, how do people actually physically come join you and, you know, help you?
[02:29:02.745 --> 02:29:05.907]  Well, go to the website, obviously, voteattony.com.
[02:29:05.947 --> 02:29:06.327]  Go there.
[02:29:06.428 --> 02:29:07.488]  All the information is there.
[02:29:07.528 --> 02:29:09.069]  I'm talking to the locals right now.
[02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:12.091]  I want to really sit down for the next three to four months.
[02:29:12.131 --> 02:29:15.294]  I'm going to sit down to all the heads of my community.
[02:29:15.634 --> 02:29:16.374]  And we're going to sit down.
[02:29:16.394 --> 02:29:17.895]  I want to hear about the issues.
[02:29:18.236 --> 02:29:21.398]  I want to talk to the people face on and go, OK, I can help you here.
[02:29:21.638 --> 02:29:22.999]  Let's talk about what is your problem?
[02:29:23.019 --> 02:29:23.599]  What does you need?
[02:29:23.659 --> 02:29:26.681]  What is one thing that you really need for this county?
[02:29:26.862 --> 02:29:28.743]  Because I want to hear from the police officers.
[02:29:28.783 --> 02:29:30.164]  I want to hear from the teachers.
[02:29:30.584 --> 02:29:33.745]  You know, I want to hear from everybody across the board, so that's how you can help.
[02:29:34.285 --> 02:29:38.227]  And then, I'm going to take all that information, I'm going to go to Washington, and I'm going to win for them.
[02:29:38.607 --> 02:29:38.887]  Wow.
[02:29:38.947 --> 02:29:39.987]  VoteAntonio.com.
[02:29:40.047 --> 02:29:41.708]  Antonio Sabato Jr., impressive.
[02:29:42.468 --> 02:29:43.549]  Everybody should get behind you.
[02:29:43.569 --> 02:29:44.249]  I know I am.
[02:29:44.289 --> 02:29:44.889]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:44.909 --> 02:29:45.809]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:29:46.069 --> 02:29:47.770]  Please join us every few weeks whenever you'd like.
[02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:49.010]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.351 --> 02:29:49.751]  Thank you, sir.
[02:29:49.771 --> 02:29:50.751]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[02:29:50.771 --> 02:29:51.151]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.572 --> 02:29:53.492]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.992 --> 02:29:55.593]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.513 --> 02:29:59.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.610 --> 02:30:24.266]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Flyover America, an InfoWars original series where we're going to be traveling around the United States talking to Flyover America, the people who feel like they have had their voices ignored by their government, by the mainstream media, and by the people on the coast.
[02:30:24.726 --> 02:30:29.930]  So we're going to be talking to the deplorables, finding out why they actually supported Trump,
[02:30:30.310 --> 02:30:35.371]  So come along with us on this journey as we discover Flyover America.
[02:30:35.711 --> 02:30:42.392]  Throughout our travels, we will be making scheduled stops to talk with those who want to tell their story.
[02:30:42.912 --> 02:30:52.774]  Like us and follow our progress on Facebook at Flyover States of America for meeting locations, updates, and even sneak peeks.
[02:30:53.274 --> 02:30:56.775]  And if you have a story to tell, come tell it.
[02:30:57.895 --> 02:31:01.098]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Fly Over America!
[02:31:02.899 --> 02:31:11.906]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:11.987 --> 02:31:20.113]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:20.393 --> 02:31:25.095]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:25.256 --> 02:31:31.999]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:32.059 --> 02:31:39.142]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:39.243 --> 02:31:46.086]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:46.246 --> 02:31:50.611]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:50.731 --> 02:31:53.994]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:31:54.134 --> 02:32:00.261]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:00.441 --> 02:32:02.603]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:02.683 --> 02:32:04.965]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:07.127 --> 02:32:18.174]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:32:18.254 --> 02:32:23.177]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:32:23.297 --> 02:32:27.280]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:30.402]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:32:30.462 --> 02:32:35.204]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:32:35.224 --> 02:32:46.810]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:48.351]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:32:48.531 --> 02:32:49.271]  This is so key.
[02:32:49.532 --> 02:32:53.834]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:32:53.854 --> 02:32:55.915]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:32:56.215 --> 02:32:58.976]  You know, MSNBC got caught with their code name for the president, the trash man.
[02:33:25.234 --> 02:33:27.515]  And I made the point, yeah, The Trashman carries out the trash.
[02:33:27.995 --> 02:33:29.015]  It's a very enduring name.
[02:33:30.656 --> 02:33:34.517]  And then Hillary came out with this new book, her last book literally sold like 10,000 copies.
[02:33:35.477 --> 02:33:36.737]  I mean, that's joke level.
[02:33:38.958 --> 02:33:40.379]  Trump's like selling 5, 10 million.
[02:33:41.299 --> 02:33:42.519]  That shows you who's really popular.
[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:48.301]  And she's calling the book, What Happened?
[02:33:51.553 --> 02:33:53.554]  And it's basically, well, I'll tell you what happened.
[02:33:53.574 --> 02:33:54.214]  People hate you.
[02:33:54.695 --> 02:33:55.875]  People know you're a liar.
[02:33:55.915 --> 02:33:57.076]  People know you're a fraud.
[02:33:57.836 --> 02:33:58.957]  People know you're a scammer.
[02:33:59.037 --> 02:34:00.598]  People rejected you.
[02:34:01.078 --> 02:34:04.120]  They rejected all the crimes you and your husband have committed.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:11.223]  The looting Haiti, all the wars, the funding radical Islam, the Obamacare, the Hillarycare, all of it.
[02:34:13.765 --> 02:34:15.106]  So that's the title, What Happened?
[02:34:16.766 --> 02:34:17.727]  And people have trolled it.
[02:34:20.543 --> 02:34:33.600]  And they've taken the book cover and changed it with thousands of different really hilarious things until you realize it's not hilarious because it's a chronicle of the incredible crimes and it's nothing but a clear-cut indictment.
[02:34:35.882 --> 02:34:38.883]  Crystal clear of how much they've gotten away with.
[02:34:39.443 --> 02:34:53.548]  I saw a video Paul did, I guess live on air Tuesday when he was hosting, where he chronicled some of the things Hillary's done and it gave me a headache because I was thinking of all these other crimes they've committed, so many, it made me have sorrow.
[02:34:56.872 --> 02:35:11.431]  For the supporters of the Democratic Party, because you've got Paul Ryan and the slimy Republican bluebloods and Mitch McConnell's horrible evil people that wrote Obamacare for big insurance companies to screw you over and to loot the economy!
[02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:22.148]  And then bankrupt it, and have a truly socialist-fascist model, where then there'd be one coverage group per sector, and then they could charge you whatever they wanted.
[02:35:22.388 --> 02:35:37.215]  So, big banks, fascists, making unlimited profits, with a socialist model, with the idiot constituents, thinking we're trying to take away their toy.
[02:35:37.235 --> 02:35:40.417]  It'd be like if you had a dog toy with cyanide on it.
[02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:44.873]  A little rope they play tug-of-war on.
[02:35:45.473 --> 02:35:49.294]  If the dog knew it was poison, the dog wouldn't run up and grab it and bite on it.
[02:35:49.614 --> 02:35:53.435]  But you sit there and play tug-of-war with them, you're not gonna get your free goodies!
[02:35:53.576 --> 02:35:54.936]  Oh, Trump's taking it all!
[02:35:55.236 --> 02:35:58.797]  You're just chomping for the poison, just begging for it!
[02:35:59.657 --> 02:36:04.679]  And then I see these weird, pseudo-intellectual, arrogant, stupid liberals.
[02:36:05.717 --> 02:36:16.068]  And the shows they all watch, like NPR and stuff, that have these real soft, pretentious voices, and it's all the same thing, regurgitated over and over again, and then I see...
[02:36:17.588 --> 02:36:38.079]  The big fitness and athletic groups in the country going that way and I see other talk show hosts that I've known getting real pseudo intellectual where they sit there and do interviews and have on another social justice warrior and virtue signal back and forth and talk real soft and talk about how they have the answers but other people don't and other people tend to
[02:36:39.893 --> 02:36:44.356]  Overanalyze things and, you know, there's really not conspiracies in the world.
[02:36:44.656 --> 02:36:49.520]  Because what are they going to do when 90% of what I've warned of has already happened?
[02:36:51.341 --> 02:37:03.470]  And then I'm telling you the rest that's going to happen because the globalist, futurist, have a plan that they are building using our compliance.
[02:37:04.628 --> 02:37:08.411]  So yes, exactly what I tell you is going to basically happen.
[02:37:08.431 --> 02:37:12.854]  When I say exactly, there's a wide spectrum of things that they're doing and planning.
[02:37:13.454 --> 02:37:15.976]  And in the general direction, we're dead on.
[02:37:16.216 --> 02:37:18.658]  Do I know the date, the month, the exact way it's implemented?
[02:37:18.718 --> 02:37:18.898]  No.
[02:37:19.138 --> 02:37:25.403]  But I know the people running things said they got a plan, and let me tell you something, they've been doing it!
[02:37:32.662 --> 02:37:35.504]  And I know Trump is really fighting it.
[02:37:37.725 --> 02:37:40.366]  There's a super squid, giant squid that's attached to us.
[02:37:40.707 --> 02:37:43.208]  He's already hacked off three of the eight tentacles.
[02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:49.232]  And he's trying to hack off the other ones with a hatchet.
[02:37:50.472 --> 02:37:55.215]  And we're sitting there bitching on the deck of a boat going, we should do it a little bit faster.
[02:37:55.235 --> 02:37:58.257]  He's got like suckers around his neck, he's bleeding.
[02:37:59.625 --> 02:38:01.529]  Look how lazy he is!
[02:38:01.549 --> 02:38:03.553]  I don't even know what to say because you know why?
[02:38:03.673 --> 02:38:04.474]  I'm in the arena too.
[02:38:05.771 --> 02:38:07.791]  And I am enjoying their attacks.
[02:38:08.371 --> 02:38:10.952]  And that's why you gotta know that Trump's a real champion.
[02:38:10.992 --> 02:38:11.932]  He's enjoying it, too.
[02:38:12.592 --> 02:38:17.513]  They keep saying he's down, he's depressed, he's mentally ill, he's got Alzheimer's, early-onset dementia.
[02:38:17.933 --> 02:38:23.434]  It's all garbage to demoralize you, just like Tokyo Rose in World War II.
[02:38:23.834 --> 02:38:27.375]  GIs you're losing, GIs it's all over, GIs there's nothing you can do.
[02:38:27.395 --> 02:38:28.175]  That's all they're doing.
[02:38:28.215 --> 02:38:31.776]  I'm gonna go to your calls, Steven and Jesse and Eric and Felipe and Carlos and others.
[02:38:33.676 --> 02:38:34.356]  But know this.
[02:38:37.728 --> 02:38:44.771]  I've got really mixed emotions about this stuff because I really want to reach out to liberals.
[02:38:48.432 --> 02:38:51.433]  And I want to show them in the white papers how they're conned.
[02:38:51.493 --> 02:38:54.054]  I want to show them in the WikiLeaks how they're conned.
[02:38:54.474 --> 02:38:57.936]  I want to prove it to them and say, listen, I'm not saying go with the Republicans.
[02:38:57.976 --> 02:39:01.457]  I'm not saying go with mainline, you know, bullying Christians.
[02:39:03.592 --> 02:39:04.652]  Because that's who they, you know, hate.
[02:39:05.352 --> 02:39:07.353]  Look what you've been maneuvered into supporting.
[02:39:08.073 --> 02:39:15.334]  Orthodox radical Islam, anti-free speech initiatives, big corporate, you know, takeovers, monopolies.
[02:39:15.854 --> 02:39:17.854]  Really, you're attacking the ACLU now?
[02:39:17.874 --> 02:39:27.616]  I mean, you've gone so far that at least the ACLU, with all of its problems, politically has some basic pillars.
[02:39:30.257 --> 02:39:32.197]  And was not for banning the white supremacist speech.
[02:39:33.749 --> 02:39:37.891]  Now, in a way, though, they're kind of with the Democrats and folks who are kind of handling it, manipulating it.
[02:39:37.911 --> 02:39:39.391]  I mean, that thing was this $53 bill.
[02:39:39.411 --> 02:39:46.994]  But, no, I mean, the ACLU, when we've been trying to have a rally and somebody's trying to ban it, has filed suit or threatened to file suit.
[02:39:47.895 --> 02:39:56.338]  When we're just having a pro-gun rally or a 9-11 rally, exposing the fact that our government stood down and worked with Islam to do it, to take our rights.
[02:39:57.139 --> 02:39:59.920]  So, I wouldn't call the ACLU
[02:40:01.252 --> 02:40:02.713]  The evil Democrats at this point.
[02:40:03.133 --> 02:40:12.458]  I mean, used to, they were the radical Democrats, but at least they've got their lawyers, so they've got some code, understanding that if you don't write a free speech, you lose everything.
[02:40:13.038 --> 02:40:14.219]  This is a pretty big step.
[02:40:14.519 --> 02:40:15.880]  This is the biggest step you can take.
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.822]  This is into really naked authoritarianism.
[02:40:20.102 --> 02:40:27.246]  And then I see Brian Stelter and all the rest of the CNN guys going, well, free speech has gone too far, it's time to get rid of it.
[02:40:28.979 --> 02:40:33.222]  And it's so obvious what they're doing, and I'm like, wow, what do you guys got planned?
[02:40:35.644 --> 02:40:38.466]  And then I find out they're going around shopping and overthrow Trump.
[02:40:38.526 --> 02:40:39.426]  And I tell you, it's happening.
[02:40:39.787 --> 02:40:49.473]  And then word for word, they come out from under rocks and go on CNN and MSNBC and say, we're going to use continuity of government to overthrow him outside of the law.
[02:40:49.933 --> 02:40:50.374]  Get ready.
[02:40:52.015 --> 02:40:53.476]  And man, I know it's serious because
[02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:55.781]  This hadn't happened in a long time.
[02:40:56.261 --> 02:41:03.546]  I've had some of the big cheeses and stuff call me up and say, Alex, this is your last chance to roll over.
[02:41:04.426 --> 02:41:08.189]  You know, most of the time you do that and take the deal, you're the first person they hang.
[02:41:08.609 --> 02:41:13.672]  So, I'm not doing it for moral reasons, but I'm also doing it for Machiavellian reasons.
[02:41:14.033 --> 02:41:16.134]  You people are very dishonorable.
[02:41:16.814 --> 02:41:19.276]  I wouldn't make a deal with you if my life depended on it.
[02:41:20.217 --> 02:41:21.578]  Because you're not going to chump me.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:23.080]  Not happening.
[02:41:23.701 --> 02:41:24.621]  Full frontal assault.
[02:41:25.001 --> 02:41:25.881]  You want to bang heads.
[02:41:26.021 --> 02:41:27.142]  We're going head up.
[02:41:27.442 --> 02:41:28.082]  Game of chicken.
[02:41:28.683 --> 02:41:32.464]  I've already taken my hands off the steering wheel and it's locked and loaded on autopilot.
[02:41:32.884 --> 02:41:45.710]  All I'm doing is jamming down the accelerator and making sure that car goes straight up the middle lane right towards you and I can't wait to either collide with you at 300 miles an hour because we're both going 150.
[02:41:47.611 --> 02:41:52.054]  I can't wait to either do that or have you turn off and flip down the side of the road politically.
[02:41:52.314 --> 02:41:53.194]  Either way, you're going down.
[02:41:53.435 --> 02:41:53.795]  You understand?
[02:41:54.295 --> 02:42:04.842]  I'm either driving this car and this engine right through you, and you're going to go right through me, politically, or you are going to chicken out and you're going to turn.
[02:42:05.122 --> 02:42:06.603]  I'm not going to stop.
[02:42:08.311 --> 02:42:10.074]  I'm enjoying this, you understand that?
[02:42:10.855 --> 02:42:12.037]  It's the opposite of being a coward.
[02:42:12.417 --> 02:42:15.602]  I enjoy putting myself out in the open with you people.
[02:42:16.304 --> 02:42:18.307]  I enjoy being fearless.
[02:42:18.447 --> 02:42:21.572]  I enjoy rubbing your little pedophile noses in it.
[02:42:23.669 --> 02:42:34.476]  So, you just get ready, because you can feel it, and you know it, and that's why they're freaking out, because they can feel your commitment, my commitment, our commitment is just rock solid.
[02:42:35.317 --> 02:42:43.102]  It's there, it's not going anywhere, and it's expanding, and these little pedophiles, and these are the type of folks that are into kidnapping kids, so just remember that.
[02:42:44.083 --> 02:42:46.725]  When you wonder what type of folks they are, they are
[02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:50.149]  The enemy of life.
[02:42:50.229 --> 02:42:51.630]  They've shown it.
[02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:54.431]  I mean, they are absolute trash.
[02:42:57.472 --> 02:42:58.432]  Divorced from God.
[02:42:59.112 --> 02:43:00.073]  Divorced from everything good.
[02:43:00.093 --> 02:43:00.873]  And they're not going to stop.
[02:43:00.933 --> 02:43:07.515]  So, I suggest... I'll never forget the films in Nazi Germany.
[02:43:09.736 --> 02:43:13.317]  And, you know, I know how they got people not to fight back as they marched them in to shoot them in those pits.
[02:43:13.477 --> 02:43:15.738]  They'd tell them, your wives and daughters are back at this other camp.
[02:43:16.138 --> 02:43:17.298]  If you resist, we'll kill them.
[02:43:17.439 --> 02:43:18.559]  They're going to kill them too.
[02:43:21.738 --> 02:43:22.698]  But see, I thought through that.
[02:43:22.718 --> 02:43:24.459]  At the time, you're kind of starving.
[02:43:24.499 --> 02:43:25.279]  You're there, whatever.
[02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:26.820]  You're being run into this pit.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:28.040]  Well, I guess you're going to die.
[02:43:29.021 --> 02:43:29.961]  You're fatalistic.
[02:43:30.021 --> 02:43:32.142]  See, and I'm not judging the folks that did that.
[02:43:32.482 --> 02:43:33.042]  Here's the deal.
[02:43:33.082 --> 02:43:36.964]  If I'm in a death camp, and they've got my family somewhere else, I'm going to fight you.
[02:43:38.324 --> 02:43:42.086]  And see, if everybody had that attitude, there wouldn't be folks getting marched into pits.
[02:43:43.426 --> 02:43:46.087]  I've had Hollywood folks say, be easy on Soros.
[02:43:46.107 --> 02:43:48.508]  You know, he did what he had to do to survive under the Nazis.
[02:43:49.628 --> 02:43:50.629]  And I look at them and I say,
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:53.481]  Really, because I wouldn't do that.
[02:43:54.301 --> 02:43:55.481]  I've already been in those positions.
[02:43:56.682 --> 02:43:58.002]  Myself, my family being threatened.
[02:43:58.022 --> 02:44:01.344]  You know, the powers that be, the power structure coming after me, my life, everything.
[02:44:01.624 --> 02:44:02.584]  Hey Alex, you back off.
[02:44:02.624 --> 02:44:04.765]  We'll leave you, your family, your kids, all of you alone.
[02:44:04.785 --> 02:44:07.746]  We're gonna just, can all stop right now if you just back off.
[02:44:09.224 --> 02:44:09.724]  Yeah, right.
[02:44:09.744 --> 02:44:10.925]  It's gonna stop.
[02:44:10.985 --> 02:44:11.145]  No.
[02:44:11.405 --> 02:44:13.425]  You're gonna be able to march me later into that pit.
[02:44:13.805 --> 02:44:13.965]  See?
[02:44:14.205 --> 02:44:15.666]  So, we're gonna do this on my terms.
[02:44:15.726 --> 02:44:15.906]  See?
[02:44:16.546 --> 02:44:21.288]  This is gonna all be done right here on my terms, and I'm not... And going back 20 plus years ago, I saw this coming.
[02:44:21.588 --> 02:44:22.748]  Classical authoritarianism.
[02:44:23.008 --> 02:44:24.709]  And I said, what's the classical way to fight it?
[02:44:25.009 --> 02:44:26.029]  Information warfare.
[02:44:26.349 --> 02:44:27.109]  Total resistance.
[02:44:27.629 --> 02:44:33.011]  We hope to fix things peacefully, but we're making every mass preparation through the people.
[02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:39.471]  To defeat your authoritarian operation.
[02:44:40.691 --> 02:44:50.375]  And you are so cynical and so inbred and so crazy, if you believe every one of your calls in a moment you're going to execute this overthrow, you really are stupid.
[02:44:50.535 --> 02:44:55.757]  Just like you thought you were going to win that night, you thought you'd steal all those states and you were able to steal five, but six, they caught you.
[02:44:56.597 --> 02:44:57.157]  They caught you.
[02:45:01.279 --> 02:45:04.660]  Just because you print up 250,000 Madam President Newsweeks,
[02:45:05.725 --> 02:45:08.106]  With fake photos of her, you know, the night of the victory.
[02:45:09.026 --> 02:45:10.226]  They even had all that choreographed.
[02:45:19.448 --> 02:45:23.209]  And of course, here's the good part.
[02:45:26.010 --> 02:45:27.450]  They don't want to stop playing chicken.
[02:45:27.470 --> 02:45:32.351]  Because they'd be slowing down and pulling off the road.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:38.342]  But they can't stop, and that ensures when we drive through them at full speed, they'll be defeated.
[02:45:39.342 --> 02:45:45.685]  That just means whoever's driving the car to take them down, and that's to the men of this country, you better understand you gotta be committed to this.
[02:45:46.385 --> 02:45:48.366]  And it's gonna feel good, you know that, don't you?
[02:45:49.967 --> 02:45:59.551]  And seconds before we run into them, you can see those eyes, when they finally realize, when they finally understand that we're doing what we're doing because we're not selfish,
[02:46:01.274 --> 02:46:03.756]  They're doing what they're doing because they crave power.
[02:46:05.037 --> 02:46:06.158]  And we crave bringing them down.
[02:46:06.198 --> 02:46:09.281]  Now, I'm not going to belabor this, because I barely even plug anymore.
[02:46:09.301 --> 02:46:10.803]  We need to fund our operation.
[02:46:11.924 --> 02:46:18.530]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:46:19.617 --> 02:46:22.619]  We've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:46:22.779 --> 02:46:26.702]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:46:27.282 --> 02:46:29.844]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:46:29.884 --> 02:46:35.128]  We've never offered super male vitality, no concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:46:35.988 --> 02:46:38.789]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:46:39.129 --> 02:46:46.711]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:46:47.051 --> 02:46:48.131]  Unprecedented.
[02:46:48.351 --> 02:46:49.332]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:46:49.752 --> 02:46:57.734]  It is 55% off and we have X2 and BioTrue mustard seed delivered, super high quality, organic.
[02:46:58.394 --> 02:47:00.836]  Selenium, it's electrochemical, just like the iodine.
[02:47:01.296 --> 02:47:08.421]  Those two products are also discounted massively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:47:09.881 --> 02:47:16.606]  We're giving you both Survival Shield X2, niacin, iodine, and BioTruth Selenium for a massive 45% off when you visit InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time.
[02:47:17.571 --> 02:47:18.612]  Yeah, this isn't going to run long.
[02:47:19.092 --> 02:47:25.097]  These two formulas are the perfect super combo for supporting a healthy thyroid and supercharging your health overall.
[02:47:25.617 --> 02:47:27.719]  Just research what true iodine does and what selenium does.
[02:47:28.199 --> 02:47:31.101]  Selenium helps support immune system, DNA production.
[02:47:31.121 --> 02:47:32.482]  Just look at the cancer studies.
[02:47:32.762 --> 02:47:33.403]  Search it yourself.
[02:47:33.723 --> 02:47:34.864]  Thyroid health and eyesight.
[02:47:35.604 --> 02:47:38.447]  True iodine helps support healthy hormone levels.
[02:47:38.867 --> 02:47:40.948]  BuzzFeed had it tested and said it's pure iodine.
[02:47:40.968 --> 02:47:42.209]  It's not potassium.
[02:47:42.249 --> 02:47:42.970]  It's not sodium.
[02:47:43.210 --> 02:47:43.811]  It's pure.
[02:47:43.831 --> 02:47:45.272]  And they go, that's weird.
[02:47:45.312 --> 02:47:46.453]  We've never seen that before.
[02:47:47.073 --> 02:47:49.794]  Well, that's because nobody else has got pure iodine from the deep earth crystals.
[02:47:51.154 --> 02:47:54.475]  It's weird, it's just, just, like, look how they spin stuff.
[02:47:54.655 --> 02:47:55.855]  It's just iodine.
[02:47:56.135 --> 02:47:57.155]  Yeah, it's true!
[02:47:58.155 --> 02:47:59.516]  It's not bound up in something.
[02:47:59.996 --> 02:48:01.496]  It turns blue, not red on paper.
[02:48:01.976 --> 02:48:04.136]  True iodine, because that's what color iodine is, is blue-purple.
[02:48:04.277 --> 02:48:04.917]  Not red, folks.
[02:48:05.337 --> 02:48:09.118]  True iodine helps support healthy hormone levels, healthy metabolic system, and much more.
[02:48:09.498 --> 02:48:14.079]  Even the CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[02:48:14.419 --> 02:48:15.819]  But the globalists like it because it lowers IQ.
[02:48:16.699 --> 02:48:21.181]  Help fund InfoWars and fight the globalists and get the great products that really are life-changing.
[02:48:21.442 --> 02:48:27.945]  Get Survival Shield, XU, Niacin, Iodine, and Biotrich Selenium for 45% off individually or together at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:48:45.043 --> 02:48:46.825]  But again, Super Mel Vitality.
[02:48:46.865 --> 02:48:48.628]  We can't do the female because it's almost sold out.
[02:48:48.648 --> 02:48:50.090]  It was the last sale I did.
[02:48:50.130 --> 02:48:52.232]  We had that when Super Mel was out.
[02:48:52.292 --> 02:48:55.296]  We had Super Female, so we discounted it to $29.95, 55% off.
[02:48:55.377 --> 02:48:56.538]  And again, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:01.672]  This is a long process.
[02:49:02.212 --> 02:49:03.773]  It's done through cold pressing the herbs.
[02:49:03.873 --> 02:49:06.456]  Almost no one else does that until it goes into an oil.
[02:49:06.756 --> 02:49:13.521]  Then they age it for, I'm not going to give the proprietary system away, but it's not a super long time, but it's more than six months.
[02:49:14.222 --> 02:49:16.864]  And then it's why each one has its own bouquet.
[02:49:17.345 --> 02:49:18.566]  Each one has its own flavor.
[02:49:18.626 --> 02:49:21.708]  Each people say, well, why is it really dark brown this time and only light brown this time?
[02:49:21.788 --> 02:49:25.291]  It's because it's different with the herbs and the cold pressing.
[02:49:26.212 --> 02:49:33.596]  They're not just, you know, absolutely boiling it up and heating it up to get everything out of it and then calling what it is, you know, the key herbs.
[02:49:33.936 --> 02:49:42.760]  Cold pressing takes, depending on the herb, sometimes ten times more of an herb when you're actually putting it in giant industrial presses and smashing the oil out cold.
[02:49:43.081 --> 02:49:49.424]  Instead of putting a bunch of it in a vat, slicing it all up, blending it up, and calling it the essence of something, it's not.
[02:49:51.411 --> 02:49:56.073]  You have to smash it out, and yeah, most of it gets thrown away, because it's like olive oil.
[02:49:56.093 --> 02:49:57.554]  You're not eating olives, you're eating the oil.
[02:49:58.514 --> 02:49:59.175]  That's the same thing.
[02:49:59.215 --> 02:50:02.676]  They're smashing it out, and it's cold-pressed.
[02:50:03.197 --> 02:50:05.478]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[02:50:05.498 --> 02:50:14.502]  People say, well, I know these compounds work, because it's admitted in science, and these are other... What you sell, BuzzFeed said, is already best-selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[02:50:14.822 --> 02:50:16.043]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:50:16.063 --> 02:50:20.365]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:50:21.661 --> 02:50:22.301]  Duh!
[02:50:22.782 --> 02:50:24.802]  Duh!
[02:50:24.822 --> 02:50:25.563]  They just don't get it.
[02:50:25.583 --> 02:50:28.204]  You think I just want to go out and find some new thing and not be sure?
[02:50:28.224 --> 02:50:30.485]  Now, BioPQQ's the big raise.
[02:50:30.505 --> 02:50:31.506]  You know, it's great DNA for us.
[02:50:31.546 --> 02:50:33.647]  That's selling out, so that's a longer sale.
[02:50:34.067 --> 02:50:36.888]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:50:37.908 --> 02:50:40.830]  And just know, commit to fund our operation.
[02:50:40.890 --> 02:50:42.110]  Commit to buy the products.
[02:50:42.491 --> 02:50:44.131]  Commit to pray for us and spread the links.
[02:50:44.151 --> 02:50:45.132]  Newswars.com.
[02:50:45.852 --> 02:50:49.354]  And know, you are funding total maniacs.
[02:50:50.114 --> 02:50:53.256]  Who are front-line kamikaze mission for you.
[02:50:53.296 --> 02:50:54.377]  And I'm not whining.
[02:50:54.417 --> 02:50:55.998]  I mean, thank you for the honor.
[02:50:56.278 --> 02:51:01.321]  But don't you want your fist, we are your fist, when we smash into their teeth, to have full power?
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:07.061]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:07.081 --> 02:51:14.007]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[02:51:14.067 --> 02:51:16.849]  So we're already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[02:51:17.009 --> 02:51:17.970]  Tommy, welcome back.
[02:51:18.090 --> 02:51:18.570]  Hello, Paul.
[02:51:18.610 --> 02:51:19.291]  Thanks for having me.
[02:51:19.311 --> 02:51:19.971]  Good to have you back.
[02:51:20.031 --> 02:51:27.517]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terrorist
[02:51:27.657 --> 02:51:30.419]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[02:51:30.479 --> 02:51:35.662]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[02:51:35.723 --> 02:51:39.425]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[02:51:39.565 --> 02:51:46.530]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:54.095]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[02:51:55.999 --> 02:51:57.060]  We see this every year.
[02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:00.021]  We see what's called the Ramadan Bombathon.
[02:52:01.942 --> 02:52:05.184]  Which you see the figures coming through daily and they excel.
[02:52:05.544 --> 02:52:12.948]  We see most attacks as instructed during the holy or unholy or very violent month of Ramadan.
[02:52:13.568 --> 02:52:24.594]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[02:52:25.014 --> 02:52:26.955]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[02:52:27.635 --> 02:52:34.379]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[02:52:34.975 --> 02:52:37.477]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[02:52:37.777 --> 02:52:44.962]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[02:52:46.295 --> 02:52:48.398]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[02:52:48.458 --> 02:52:50.580]  The details are young Muslim men.
[02:52:51.021 --> 02:52:52.142]  They stopped a Muslim man.
[02:52:52.242 --> 02:52:53.343]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[02:52:53.544 --> 02:52:54.344]  And he said, Muslim.
[02:52:54.605 --> 02:52:55.846]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[02:52:56.467 --> 02:52:58.649]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[02:52:59.170 --> 02:52:59.991]  So they left him.
[02:53:00.291 --> 02:53:00.952]  They walked on.
[02:53:01.192 --> 02:53:02.093]  They stopped the next man.
[02:53:02.514 --> 02:53:03.275]  What religion are you?
[02:53:03.455 --> 02:53:04.096]  I'm Christian.
[02:53:04.316 --> 02:53:04.636]  Bang.
[02:53:04.977 --> 02:53:05.918]  They finally beat him.
[02:53:05.938 --> 02:53:07.039]  His girlfriend tried to stop him.
[02:53:12.842 --> 02:53:24.307]  If the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets asking Muslims if they were Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously,
[02:53:24.707 --> 02:53:28.391]  That would be a national outrage as it is.
[02:53:28.732 --> 02:53:32.116]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section.
[02:53:32.576 --> 02:53:35.279]  And these guys told me they're going to be in jail.
[02:53:35.299 --> 02:53:37.562]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[02:53:38.023 --> 02:53:40.345]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months.
[02:53:40.846 --> 02:53:43.449]  And no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[02:53:43.889 --> 02:53:53.515]  Can anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because this is what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[02:53:53.735 --> 02:53:55.956]  And when they said yes, they were all violently beaten.
[02:53:55.976 --> 02:53:56.537]  Could you imagine?
[02:53:57.197 --> 02:53:57.677]  Imagine!
[02:53:57.697 --> 02:54:02.120]  It wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.
[02:54:26.092 --> 02:54:32.053]  You know, I realized during the break that I've got all this incredible science news, technology news, really cool stuff happening.
[02:54:33.453 --> 02:54:39.734]  And I'm going to go back to what I used to do years ago where I covered just interesting topics and things, not just the social justice warriors.
[02:54:39.814 --> 02:54:54.117]  But we're in the middle of a revolution with them trying to take over society and trying to tell us what words to use and telling the ACLU they can't tweet an image of a cute little blonde baby saying, fighting for America's future.
[02:54:56.001 --> 02:54:58.362]  And then people are triggered by that and say, you're white supremacist.
[02:54:58.382 --> 02:55:01.043]  See, just being white is white supremacist now.
[02:55:02.344 --> 02:55:07.106]  It's total and complete scientific manipulation.
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:22.811]  And then turning minorities into the equivalent of super crazed KKK members, but against whites, and then having weird white leftists that are called white allies that like manage it all.
[02:55:23.771 --> 02:55:26.734]  I mean, it's like beyond a re-education camp.
[02:55:28.547 --> 02:55:30.788]  And then now they've got liberal businesses everywhere.
[02:55:30.828 --> 02:55:31.909]  They're challenging them to do this.
[02:55:32.569 --> 02:55:34.730]  Challenge people to see if there's white supremacists.
[02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:37.551]  So you walk into a florist and go, like a dozen red roses, please.
[02:55:37.931 --> 02:55:39.572]  Sir, you're not a KKK member, are you?
[02:55:40.553 --> 02:55:41.633]  Well, no.
[02:55:41.653 --> 02:55:44.294]  Well, you're not with Hitler, are you?
[02:55:44.354 --> 02:55:45.815]  Let me gesticulate.
[02:55:45.855 --> 02:55:46.615]  Let me bow down.
[02:55:46.635 --> 02:55:48.276]  Let me prostrate myself to you.
[02:55:48.356 --> 02:55:49.457]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:55:50.402 --> 02:55:53.383]  And it's scientific and they know what they're doing.
[02:55:53.623 --> 02:55:54.524]  Good Lord!
[02:55:55.504 --> 02:55:59.545]  How do we create this amount of just scumbag bullies?
[02:56:02.006 --> 02:56:09.489]  And then led by a bunch of crazy corrupt Democrats that are funding dictators and slave factories in China and radical Islam and none of that matters.
[02:56:09.549 --> 02:56:11.850]  It's all just whites, whites, whites are evil.
[02:56:13.251 --> 02:56:19.253]  And it's meant to turn white people into total race baiting basket cases like the minorities.
[02:56:21.189 --> 02:56:24.793]  I got a clip of Martin Luther King coming up I want to play when we introduce John Rappaport.
[02:56:24.893 --> 02:56:26.315]  I'm going to go a little bit in the next hour.
[02:56:27.608 --> 02:56:33.810]  But I can't go too long, I've got a bunch of key meetings about stuff we're launching here, but we're putting everything in right now in the fight.
[02:56:34.151 --> 02:56:37.932]  New shows, David Knight, weekday mornings, new shows starting next week.
[02:56:38.292 --> 02:56:39.393]  We need your hopes and prayers.
[02:56:39.613 --> 02:56:48.736]  And I'm not bitching and complaining, I'm saying I love you, and I appreciate all your help, folks, but we are all in, and the war is now, and they are getting ready to try to kill Trump the next month.
[02:56:49.176 --> 02:56:52.978]  They've said it themselves, and I told you you'd see them heat up like this before they did.
[02:56:53.698 --> 02:56:58.041]  And my goodness, they are following an exact profile for the attack.
[02:56:59.242 --> 02:57:05.206]  They could drug him and say he collapsed, they could kill him, or they make car bomb a building, say that his listeners did it or his supporters.
[02:57:05.266 --> 02:57:13.031]  I mean, you can see the cards they got, the cards they were dealt, the cards they've played before, and we know this, we're in the zone right now.
[02:57:13.972 --> 02:57:15.393]  Danger Will Robinson.
[02:57:16.053 --> 02:57:19.876]  So people ought to be hitting their knees before the good Lord above.
[02:57:21.135 --> 02:57:25.996]  People argue about God's name, Yahweh, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, God the Father, the Holy Spirit.
[02:57:26.036 --> 02:57:27.337]  Everybody knows who God is.
[02:57:27.397 --> 02:57:28.117]  We love God.
[02:57:28.137 --> 02:57:30.238]  We have a relationship with God, the Holy Spirit.
[02:57:30.798 --> 02:57:31.878]  And we know who the devil is.
[02:57:32.018 --> 02:57:32.498]  And it's real.
[02:57:32.518 --> 02:57:37.520]  The only thing I fear is being separated from God.
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:42.501]  And that doesn't mean I'm up here high and mighty and doesn't mean I don't sin.
[02:57:42.841 --> 02:57:43.601]  But I love God.
[02:57:45.042 --> 02:57:45.902]  And I can feel God.
[02:57:47.302 --> 02:57:48.743]  And I can also feel the enemy.
[02:57:48.783 --> 02:57:49.663]  And let me tell you, the enemy
[02:57:51.383 --> 02:57:53.705]  The enemy has got dead kids on its breath.
[02:57:54.706 --> 02:57:55.727]  So you just think about that.
[02:57:57.528 --> 02:57:59.950]  And they have tortured the daylights out of me and it's made me stronger.
[02:58:00.370 --> 02:58:02.672]  But I gotta tell you, these people are bad news.
[02:58:03.233 --> 02:58:05.415]  Jesse in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:58:05.455 --> 02:58:05.775]  Go ahead.
[02:58:11.004 --> 02:58:12.025]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:58:12.045 --> 02:58:18.090]  Hey, I just wanted to ask you, man, and get your thoughts on getting some credit from Trump, man.
[02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:26.297]  You do such a great job, and I know it's controversy about bringing Trump on the show and whatnot, but how about Trump speaking out for you one time?
[02:58:26.617 --> 02:58:28.198]  Like the other night, he mentioned Hannity.
[02:58:28.939 --> 02:58:30.220]  That's safe for them to do.
[02:58:30.380 --> 02:58:32.302]  They can misrepresent what I say, and I understand.
[02:58:32.322 --> 02:58:33.103]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:58:33.143 --> 02:58:33.523]  Stay there, Jesse.
[02:58:33.543 --> 02:58:34.544]  Here's the deal.
[02:58:35.748 --> 02:58:41.996]  Trump offered to come on my show in January on a phone call with me, and I said... I told him, sir, you don't need to do that.
[02:58:42.877 --> 02:58:43.598]  It was my decision.
[02:58:43.838 --> 02:58:44.939]  It's my decision.
[02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:46.401]  That's how honorable he is.
[02:58:47.202 --> 02:58:48.143]  They can misrepresent it.
[02:58:48.644 --> 02:58:50.506]  They take my satire out of position.
[02:58:51.187 --> 02:58:51.768]  That's why he's not on.
[02:58:54.338 --> 02:58:55.699]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:58:55.999 --> 02:58:57.279]  You can't survive without it.
[02:58:57.480 --> 02:58:58.380]  But where do you get it?
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:04.443]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:04.663 --> 02:59:10.386]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:10.586 --> 02:59:27.448]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:27.828 --> 02:59:29.970]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:30.330 --> 02:59:31.511]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:31.791 --> 02:59:32.552]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:32.832 --> 02:59:33.452]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:33.752 --> 02:59:35.574]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:59:55.669 --> 02:59:59.771]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:00.291 --> 03:00:01.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:22.602]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:36.149 --> 03:00:37.950]  John Rappaport is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:00:37.970 --> 03:00:39.591]  I want to finish with some of your calls.
[03:00:39.991 --> 03:00:41.652]  I don't want to sound like a bigwig here, okay?
[03:00:43.113 --> 03:00:47.776]  The enemy's coming after me because they got my phone's tapped, it's been in the news, and they know what we're doing, okay?
[03:00:49.517 --> 03:00:52.598]  And what we're doing is legal and lawful, but we don't want to give up sources.
[03:00:53.759 --> 03:00:58.402]  We knew that they're going to do this mental ill stuff four months ago, three months ago, because
[03:00:59.696 --> 03:01:06.441]  Roger Stone talks to top reporters and they've had editorial meetings where they tell them the phases of how they're going to take Trump down.
[03:01:07.702 --> 03:01:11.124]  And I've got my other sources that said the word is they're going to do a COG on him.
[03:01:11.144 --> 03:01:16.928]  I started telling you that eight months ago when he was president-elect and how they would build it out and then when they would launch it.
[03:01:17.128 --> 03:01:18.409]  And now everybody sees it happening.
[03:01:18.629 --> 03:01:21.932]  So I get what you're saying, Jesse, that I should get some credit from Trump, but you know,
[03:01:26.718 --> 03:01:31.083]  He called me in January and I was on honeymoon with my wife.
[03:01:31.103 --> 03:01:48.662]  I've been with her like three years with her and he wanted to talk to her and stuff and congratulations and all that and he said I'm gonna come on soon blah blah let's set it up and I'd already been invited to some places I'm gonna leave it at that media has a heyday with this stuff and I just said to the president I said listen
[03:01:51.801 --> 03:01:52.942]  You don't need to come on the show.
[03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:53.682]  You're very busy.
[03:01:53.782 --> 03:01:54.283]  They twist it.
[03:01:54.303 --> 03:01:55.163]  They take it out of context.
[03:01:55.443 --> 03:01:57.624]  And I'm going to support you as long as you deliver on the promises.
[03:01:57.965 --> 03:02:02.267]  And let's talk about the tax cuts, Obamacare, securing the borders, getting off the back of Christians.
[03:02:02.647 --> 03:02:03.448]  We talked about that.
[03:02:04.148 --> 03:02:07.470]  And I said, well, listen, you don't have to pat me on the head.
[03:02:07.930 --> 03:02:09.811]  I know you're very busy making hundreds of phone calls a day, sir.
[03:02:09.851 --> 03:02:11.212]  You don't need to call me anymore.
[03:02:14.074 --> 03:02:18.116]  Because I wanted to be the one person that understood the position he's in and just said, hey, I'm committed, buddy.
[03:02:18.336 --> 03:02:19.557]  I'm not here because I'm a sycophant.
[03:02:19.817 --> 03:02:20.898]  I'm committed because you're delivering.
[03:02:21.923 --> 03:02:24.184]  Now, there's been other communications and things since then.
[03:02:24.204 --> 03:02:24.924]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:02:25.204 --> 03:02:26.745]  But the point is, I'm in the battlefield.
[03:02:26.805 --> 03:02:27.385]  I'm in a war.
[03:02:27.646 --> 03:02:31.067]  I don't need the President to talk to me when I'm out here on the front line fighting.
[03:02:31.347 --> 03:02:35.549]  He doesn't need to come pat me on the head and make me think he cares about me, so I stay on board.
[03:02:35.769 --> 03:02:37.230]  I'm on board because of what he stands for.
[03:02:38.211 --> 03:02:40.112]  So the media's already made heydays of this before.
[03:02:40.392 --> 03:02:42.272]  Like, oh, Jones didn't want Trump on.
[03:02:42.592 --> 03:02:44.873]  Oh look, Trump's so pathetic, Jones didn't want him.
[03:02:45.193 --> 03:02:47.034]  That is, of course I want Trump on the show.
[03:02:47.554 --> 03:02:52.916]  I've done the calculus of how they misrepresent, and how they twist everything, and all the things they do.
[03:02:53.916 --> 03:02:57.357]  And I thought it's 50-50 whether it's good for the country and my children or not.
[03:02:58.077 --> 03:03:02.179]  And so, I'm gonna say, don't worry about coming on my show.
[03:03:04.479 --> 03:03:06.140]  Let me just get you information.
[03:03:08.942 --> 03:03:09.823]  And that's what I do.
[03:03:12.764 --> 03:03:13.445]  And they know that.
[03:03:13.485 --> 03:03:15.126]  They've talked about it on Fox and CNN.
[03:03:15.406 --> 03:03:16.867]  They've obviously got my phones tapped.
[03:03:18.588 --> 03:03:19.769]  They know what memos.
[03:03:19.809 --> 03:03:20.649]  They know everything.
[03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:26.973]  And the point is, is the president has to go get random cell phones to call people.
[03:03:26.993 --> 03:03:28.154]  He's completely surrounded.
[03:03:28.394 --> 03:03:29.855]  We're beyond any epic movie.
[03:03:29.875 --> 03:03:31.296]  We're beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[03:03:31.316 --> 03:03:32.276]  This is so real.
[03:03:32.497 --> 03:03:33.497]  This is so insane.
[03:03:36.488 --> 03:03:40.769]  I get a lot of folks say, oh my gosh, you know, Trump quotes you and, and, and everybody blah, blah, blah.
[03:03:41.730 --> 03:03:43.010]  And his sons, you know, retweet you.
[03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.930]  It doesn't matter.
[03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:45.951]  It's not about being in the club.
[03:03:47.191 --> 03:03:48.992]  It's about defeating the globalist.
[03:03:49.752 --> 03:03:51.453]  And so that, that's all.
[03:03:51.513 --> 03:03:57.475]  The classy thing to do is to be the only guy not asking for anything from the president.
[03:03:59.455 --> 03:04:04.177]  When he's calling up without you ever telling him or him knowing to know you just got married a day before.
[03:04:05.472 --> 03:04:06.513]  That's how classy he is.
[03:04:07.134 --> 03:04:09.656]  Every police officer gets killed in this country, he calls.
[03:04:10.577 --> 03:04:12.219]  Almost every military person.
[03:04:12.279 --> 03:04:16.202]  The guy is an insane dynamo of energy.
[03:04:17.406 --> 03:04:21.908]  That's why they say he's senile, or he's doddering, he's a liar, because he's the opposite of that.
[03:04:22.369 --> 03:04:25.270]  Now, do I disagree with this escalation in Afghanistan?
[03:04:25.791 --> 03:04:27.612]  We'll probably see that it's a bad idea.
[03:04:27.652 --> 03:04:29.353]  He said his instincts said it, but he has to do it.
[03:04:29.993 --> 03:04:36.436]  He's not perfect, and I won't support him into oblivion, but you think about what Rand Paul said, who never supported anybody else.
[03:04:36.476 --> 03:04:42.680]  He said, thank God Donald Trump's in there every day, because we'd have had that mad dog, crazy person, Hillary, in there.
[03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:44.241]  So it's not a lesser of two evils.
[03:04:45.293 --> 03:04:54.459]  It's where you got somebody who means well, who's fallible, who's not evil, versus maniac bureaucracy that are endangering the whole planet.
[03:04:54.499 --> 03:04:55.540]  Jesse, I'm going to come back to you.
[03:04:55.620 --> 03:04:57.121]  Eric, Felipe, Carlos, Stephen.
[03:04:57.321 --> 03:05:02.004]  We'll get to all of the co-hosts in a few minutes here with John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com.
[03:05:12.833 --> 03:05:14.318]  This memo will bring down the traitors.
[03:05:14.780 --> 03:05:18.331]  McMasters doesn't want you... Deep State doesn't want you to read this memo.
[03:05:19.815 --> 03:05:21.056]  I mean, talk about traitors.
[03:05:21.076 --> 03:05:25.477]  You've got McMaster granting Susan Rice her same level of security clearance.
[03:05:25.617 --> 03:05:29.839]  At the same time, Trump is actively saying, we need to find the leakers.
[03:05:30.199 --> 03:05:31.100]  I'm being surveilled.
[03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:32.200]  Oh no, you're not.
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:33.181]  That's a big lie.
[03:05:33.201 --> 03:05:34.341]  How are you going to lie to the people?
[03:05:34.441 --> 03:05:36.842]  No, they wiretapped Trump Tower.
[03:05:37.242 --> 03:05:44.545]  And so at the same time that Trump is saying this to the American people, McMaster is saying, I don't think Susan Rice did anything wrong.
[03:05:44.625 --> 03:05:48.147]  I'm going to allow her to still have her same level of security clearance.
[03:05:48.767 --> 03:05:49.768]  It's insane!
[03:05:49.888 --> 03:05:51.951]  Why are the neocons surrounding Trump?
[03:05:52.171 --> 03:05:53.032]  What do they have on him?
[03:05:53.172 --> 03:05:53.893]  What's happening?
[03:05:54.453 --> 03:06:04.664]  Well again, David admit in the memo, as I've said on air without the memo, the Bolsheviks, same globalist operatives, they created a state within a state for years and Russia only controlled Moscow.
[03:06:05.305 --> 03:06:09.810]  And then they got everybody through time to turn in their guns through propaganda, then they slaughtered millions of people.
[03:06:10.270 --> 03:06:13.053]  So they admit that it is a malice strategy.
[03:06:13.093 --> 03:06:14.494]  That's what the weatherman taught Obama.
[03:06:14.735 --> 03:06:21.041]  They are all carrying out a malice strategy with deep staters and cowards like McMasters and others that Trump picked.
[03:06:21.121 --> 03:06:27.988]  They get approached by deep state, they get scared, and they join with it because they want to play golf and do whatever while we're being carted off to death camps.
[03:06:28.368 --> 03:06:32.030]  And, you know, pot-bellied liberals are kicking our brains out and raping our families, literally.
[03:06:32.410 --> 03:06:37.632]  That's what the left talks about, how they're going to rape us, how they're going to murder us, how they're going to have all these little nobodies.
[03:06:37.992 --> 03:06:42.234]  This is their existential dream of power, is to run around desiccating on everybody.
[03:06:44.110 --> 03:06:46.951]  Well, people need to look no further than Venezuela and what happened.
[03:06:46.971 --> 03:06:49.911]  That's the exact same thing that they did there just several years ago.
[03:06:50.012 --> 03:06:51.112]  They got rid of the guns.
[03:06:51.172 --> 03:06:53.973]  Everyone turning your guns because we want to be a peaceful nation.
[03:06:53.993 --> 03:07:07.576]  And then just about a year or so later, we saw the total collapse there where the government was actually purging people who are eating dogs and giraffes out of the zoo, purging them because they don't have the guns or anything to fight back.
[03:07:09.296 --> 03:07:12.338]  Yeah, it only shows their hand even so more.
[03:07:12.538 --> 03:07:15.420]  When the minute you start telling the truth, they try to slap you down.
[03:07:15.460 --> 03:07:19.984]  The minute they start sharing anything that has a headline that's anti them, they try to ban it.
[03:07:20.264 --> 03:07:26.528]  They are going to be forcing their hand so much that they're showing us, they're exposing us what their actual plans are.
[03:07:26.828 --> 03:07:31.271]  They're trying to ban us, they're trying to shut us down, they're trying to fire people for speaking the truth.
[03:07:31.532 --> 03:07:33.413]  That's only going to mean that more people are going to hear it.
[03:07:33.433 --> 03:07:35.154]  And Posobiec, we're not the radicals saying all this.
[03:07:35.194 --> 03:07:36.875]  They're on C-SPAN.
[03:07:37.876 --> 03:07:44.839]  At the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer, Brennan, and Clapper saying a violent overthrow is coming in the next few months.
[03:07:45.139 --> 03:07:46.319]  Don't wait for impeachment.
[03:07:46.359 --> 03:07:47.360]  We're now moving.
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:50.241]  And then Al Gore goes on the Late Late Show and says the same thing.
[03:07:50.601 --> 03:07:52.101]  I mean, they are doing it!
[03:08:05.899 --> 03:08:08.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:08.541 --> 03:08:13.764]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:15.565 --> 03:08:17.286]  Well, he launched the site 15 years ago.
[03:08:17.346 --> 03:08:18.346]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:08:18.366 --> 03:08:19.887]  He's an author, researcher, artist.
[03:08:20.428 --> 03:08:23.589]  Works for some of the biggest publications and TV programs as an investigative journalist.
[03:08:23.649 --> 03:08:24.890]  He's John Rappaport.
[03:08:26.411 --> 03:08:29.013]  And, as usual, I end up cutting into his time because I like to talk to him.
[03:08:29.053 --> 03:08:30.914]  Plus, we've got a bunch of callers I promised I'd go to.
[03:08:33.849 --> 03:08:35.731]  I don't sit here and pre-script stuff when I do an interview.
[03:08:35.771 --> 03:08:47.846]  Like I was sitting there saying I tacitly will give the president time to have a build-up for a pull-out because some of my sources say it's a build-up to confuse them as a pull-out to try to have a negotiation in Afghanistan.
[03:08:48.006 --> 03:08:51.791]  But a lot of good sources and Pachinick has run major CIA operations.
[03:08:51.811 --> 03:08:52.872]  I mean, that's a fact.
[03:08:53.653 --> 03:08:53.853]  I don't
[03:09:07.046 --> 03:09:07.866]  He says it's horrible.
[03:09:08.547 --> 03:09:09.167]  Okay, fine.
[03:09:09.467 --> 03:09:10.788]  Then let's see what's happening.
[03:09:11.588 --> 03:09:20.313]  I've just never seen the establishment throw itself at somebody like this and lie and turn everything upside down and then they're trying to destroy me at the same time.
[03:09:20.613 --> 03:09:24.255]  You can't help but have kinship with somebody who you're being attacked with.
[03:09:25.419 --> 03:09:26.340]  Second only to Trump.
[03:09:26.380 --> 03:09:27.421]  And I'm not complaining.
[03:09:27.942 --> 03:09:29.043]  It's surreal though.
[03:09:29.103 --> 03:09:36.230]  I asked for this fight and they've got like eight or nine TV shows they admit are based around me where they misrepresent who I am.
[03:09:36.250 --> 03:09:39.594]  And then I see the zombies on the street in Austin.
[03:09:40.779 --> 03:10:09.145]  When I go in the trendy areas, and again, most areas 9 out of 10 folks, you know, that talk to me are supporters, but now it's really vicious people that run up and threaten to attack me, and then as soon as I turn, they run like they're a cat that's been startled, you know, a cat that saw a cucumber, and then I go, please talk to me, I just want to tell you what I really said, and they go, no, shut up, and then laugh at me like it's junior high and I'm not in the cool club, and they just are victims!
[03:10:10.410 --> 03:10:13.733]  And then CNN and all of them announced, go out, bully Trump supporters.
[03:10:14.173 --> 03:10:15.334]  Ask people who they support.
[03:10:15.635 --> 03:10:16.676]  Get in people's faces.
[03:10:16.976 --> 03:10:18.798]  Don't give them service if you're a florist.
[03:10:19.118 --> 03:10:20.879]  Don't give them service if you're a coffee shop.
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:24.623]  That's part of that thing they were doing that they dropped at
[03:10:25.942 --> 03:10:36.006]  Starbucks six months ago, where they said, tell us that you believe in racial profiling, and you believe there's racism, and say you're sorry, and if you're white, give us your testimony of how you admit you're bad.
[03:10:36.406 --> 03:10:38.326]  I mean, this is re-education camp.
[03:10:38.647 --> 03:10:52.732]  This is when you're in a sports stadium, you know, in Eastern Europe, because the Russians took over in 1967, and they've got movie screens projecting propaganda, telling you your founding fathers were dirtbags, and that Jesus rots in hell.
[03:10:52.852 --> 03:10:53.072]  I mean,
[03:10:54.278 --> 03:10:57.160]  This is Red Dawn level crazy town, okay?
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:04.103]  I mean, it's so crazy that I can't believe they've gotten to this point without a shooting war.
[03:11:04.243 --> 03:11:05.584]  And I'm not calling for a shooting war.
[03:11:07.325 --> 03:11:10.366]  And then they're everywhere saying they're preparing to kill the president.
[03:11:10.886 --> 03:11:15.289]  And then I remember talking to Stone, who was talking to his sources, I talked to him today, said go ahead and tell it.
[03:11:16.189 --> 03:11:19.431]  He didn't just guess back on May 16th that they were going to
[03:11:20.489 --> 03:11:30.672]  We were at dinner, myself, my parents, and he, and my children, at the JW Marriott, and he goes, I need to step out and make a phone call.
[03:11:31.032 --> 03:11:32.313]  I'm being called by a major newspaper.
[03:11:33.193 --> 03:11:50.058]  He goes, one of his old sources, comes back, he starts telling me all this stuff, he gets another call, comes back, gets another call, comes back, and then later he goes, yeah, I just checked it, he didn't, they sent the memo out, we're gonna do Russia, then we're gonna do money laundering, then we're gonna do racism, that's why they just made up Charleston,
[03:11:51.363 --> 03:11:51.843]  Charlesville.
[03:11:52.423 --> 03:11:55.084]  And then they said we're going to do he's got dementia.
[03:11:55.284 --> 03:11:56.185]  And then you see it today.
[03:11:56.285 --> 03:12:03.587]  I mean, do you know what it's like, folks, to know they're planning to kill the president, and then they're going to go after everybody else once they've done that?
[03:12:04.047 --> 03:12:05.828]  A lot of people are saying, well, we better roll over.
[03:12:06.328 --> 03:12:09.629]  That's what the Republicans are doing, because people are threatening to kill them.
[03:12:10.848 --> 03:12:24.099]  And the way it happens is, you know, you can keep all that stuff you got, Mitch McConnell, you can keep your mistress, you can keep all those stocks you got 20 years ago illegally, we got records, you can keep all that, brother, or we're gonna kill you on the same day we kill Trump.
[03:12:24.119 --> 03:12:26.721]  Now, you gonna tell the New York Times that Trump should be removed?
[03:12:27.542 --> 03:12:29.544]  And Mitch McConnell goes out, and you know what, he does it!
[03:12:30.024 --> 03:12:30.625]  He does it!
[03:12:31.954 --> 03:12:34.035]  But somebody like Trump, they really can't find anything.
[03:12:34.935 --> 03:12:37.216]  They really can't find anything on somebody like me, so what are they going to do?
[03:12:37.496 --> 03:12:48.220]  John Rappaport, I hate to make ourselves the center of attention, gonzo journalism here, but a new five-day-a-week Comedy Central show based on me, where the guy says outrageous, racist crap?
[03:12:48.820 --> 03:12:55.182]  I mean, there's got to be a lawsuit here where they build these straw men, say it's based on you, and then put this crap out.
[03:12:59.145 --> 03:13:00.166]  I'm with you, Alex.
[03:13:00.886 --> 03:13:04.069]  It's just mind boggling that it's got to this point.
[03:13:04.289 --> 03:13:12.074]  In other words, it's like they had 500,000 crazy people locked up somewhere, right?
[03:13:12.935 --> 03:13:18.719]  And then on the same day, they said, OK, let them all out now because we got them all programmed.
[03:13:19.554 --> 03:13:39.007]  And they're going to say the craziest bleep in the world and they're going to do the craziest things and the media will be behind them and make it look as if it's sane to do all this insanity that in any other situation people would just laugh off and walk away from.
[03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:40.288]  It's like that.
[03:13:40.468 --> 03:13:41.549]  It's like they had this
[03:13:43.214 --> 03:13:47.737]  You know, camp, hidden somewhere with these 500,000, a million people, whatever they are.
[03:13:48.298 --> 03:13:50.619]  And maybe they're called colleges and universities.
[03:13:51.100 --> 03:13:54.002]  Because this has been cooking for a long time at those places.
[03:13:54.302 --> 03:13:55.203]  You're so smart.
[03:13:55.263 --> 03:13:58.085]  That is exactly what I was going to say this morning when I was working out.
[03:13:58.485 --> 03:14:23.814]  I thought, these are the cult programming centers, the media backs it up, now the alien eggs are breaking open, the face suckers are coming out, it was all set for Hillary already, but since she's not in, they're still going with the admitted censorship plan as if she's still in, and they're all dug in, and they don't care, and they're committed, and then again, as you said, the media then backs up the insanity
[03:14:25.014 --> 03:14:27.637]  And these folks are like watching a virtual reality movie.
[03:14:27.877 --> 03:14:30.159]  They really believe they're Captain America fighting us.
[03:14:30.499 --> 03:14:32.961]  As I said a month ago, and you're the Red Skull, I'm the Red Skull.
[03:14:32.981 --> 03:14:42.048]  And it turns out the new demonstrations are being led by these live-action adventure people actually dressed as Captain America now.
[03:14:42.088 --> 03:14:46.672]  There's videos of like a hundred people dressed as Captain America beating up Trump supporters.
[03:14:47.132 --> 03:14:48.914]  They think they're fighting Red Skull.
[03:14:49.414 --> 03:14:51.075]  They are literally insane!
[03:14:52.176 --> 03:14:52.597]  Correct.
[03:14:53.097 --> 03:14:54.118]  Literally insane.
[03:14:55.134 --> 03:14:58.637]  So, listeners, you've got to ask yourself, how does that happen?
[03:14:59.557 --> 03:15:00.978]  This isn't an overnight thing.
[03:15:01.919 --> 03:15:03.860]  This is a long preparation.
[03:15:04.601 --> 03:15:07.803]  And, you know, you know the guys, Alex.
[03:15:07.863 --> 03:15:09.725]  I mean, you could have them on at the drop of a hat.
[03:15:09.825 --> 03:15:24.015]  University professors who have seen this coming for a long time, where their own colleagues are just pushing, pushing socialism, Marxism, collectivism, hatred.
[03:15:25.156 --> 03:15:38.025]  Uh, the whole idea that somehow if your skin happens to be light flesh colored, whatever, this is an immediate indication that, you know, you are a killer.
[03:15:38.365 --> 03:15:39.726]  And so you have to be destroyed.
[03:15:40.587 --> 03:15:42.568]  And they had it all in the bag, they thought.
[03:15:43.692 --> 03:15:45.873]  They thought, OK, smooth transition to Hillary.
[03:15:46.173 --> 03:15:47.314]  This is going to be a slam dunk.
[03:15:47.774 --> 03:15:50.515]  I can still see George Clooney sitting up there on stage.
[03:15:50.555 --> 03:15:52.596]  I'm sure you remember the footage at the podium.
[03:15:52.616 --> 03:15:53.977]  Trump's not going to be president?
[03:15:54.037 --> 03:15:55.117]  Come on!
[03:15:55.498 --> 03:15:56.318]  Exactly.
[03:15:56.358 --> 03:16:00.340]  He's smirking and he's going, you know, Trump's not going to be president, right?
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:03.041]  And then all of a sudden, there it is.
[03:16:03.701 --> 03:16:05.122]  The shock of a lifetime.
[03:16:05.742 --> 03:16:11.165]  Everything the media was doing to make sure that Hillary got in fails completely.
[03:16:12.174 --> 03:16:19.080]  Now they are totally under the gun, the media, and make no mistake about it, these people have also been prepared.
[03:16:19.641 --> 03:16:32.052]  All these folks on MSNBC, CNN, and so forth, it's like, we don't care who Trump is, all we know is whoever's in the White House that's not Hillary is the devil, and we have to destroy him
[03:16:32.685 --> 03:16:36.468]  Whatever way we can, take them out, kill them if necessary, whatever.
[03:16:36.488 --> 03:16:39.811]  And here's the deal, I've got four children, you've got a family.
[03:16:39.991 --> 03:16:41.632]  I personally am not scared.
[03:16:41.652 --> 03:16:49.939]  I just feel like I'm not doing enough to stop the disaster because they admit they're getting ready to kill him and that means they're going to go to full martial law.
[03:16:50.380 --> 03:16:55.064]  And I mean, I'm not going to go to some re-education camp with a bunch of pot-bellied pedophiles around me.
[03:16:55.364 --> 03:16:56.405]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[03:16:56.485 --> 03:16:57.826]  How do we stop these maniacs?
[03:16:58.086 --> 03:17:06.428]  Because they've got to know, if they already train-wrecked crazy enough to run Hillary, when Joe Biden, you know, for all his problems, comes off like a regular guy, probably would have beat Trump.
[03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:07.669]  They're so arrogant.
[03:17:07.709 --> 03:17:11.530]  They ran a... Her new book on tape was like, hell all, I'm Hillary!
[03:17:11.730 --> 03:17:14.411]  I mean, it's just, they're so disconnected.
[03:17:14.791 --> 03:17:19.412]  Don't they get, they're trying to run an operation that even if Hillary would have got in, would have failed.
[03:17:19.852 --> 03:17:21.473]  Now it's really not gonna make it.
[03:17:21.613 --> 03:17:22.673]  It's gonna blow up.
[03:17:23.533 --> 03:17:25.394]  It's like watching a bunch of crazy monkeys
[03:17:25.854 --> 03:17:32.098]  Or, you know, Lilliputians marching flamethrowers into a TNT factory.
[03:17:32.359 --> 03:17:33.359]  It's not gonna go well.
[03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:35.281]  No, it's not.
[03:17:35.301 --> 03:17:36.681]  It's not gonna go well.
[03:17:38.022 --> 03:17:41.465]  I keep thinking, you know, I gotta put this in here.
[03:17:42.726 --> 03:17:45.588]  Rest in peace to BBC reporters.
[03:17:46.728 --> 03:17:48.650]  Liz McKeon, 2017, they claim she died of a stroke at 52.
[03:17:48.730 --> 03:17:49.010]  1999, Jill Dando.
[03:17:55.766 --> 03:17:58.148]  Shot to death on her doorstep at home.
[03:17:59.369 --> 03:18:05.674]  Both of them were investigating pedophile rings in England, UK, Jimmy Savile.
[03:18:06.654 --> 03:18:09.316]  Both of them were pushing the envelope at the BBC.
[03:18:09.917 --> 03:18:14.600]  Both of them were going after the same kind of people that we're talking about here.
[03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:17.643]  This is not a story that I suddenly, you know, diverted into.
[03:18:17.663 --> 03:18:18.804]  This is big.
[03:18:19.224 --> 03:18:21.746]  Just four days ago, three days ago, Liz McKeon,
[03:18:22.606 --> 03:18:31.469]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, she quits the BBC in 2013 because she keeps pushing, saying this whole pedophile thing is much wider than Jimmy Seville.
[03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:34.570]  We got names of celebrities, big time people.
[03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:37.471]  These are the same people we're talking about.
[03:18:37.911 --> 03:18:43.633]  These are the people that are desperate to protect their secrets and their crimes, their hideous crimes.
[03:18:44.353 --> 03:18:47.474]  And these two women at the BBC, dead.
[03:18:48.487 --> 03:18:56.749]  Well, you say what you want about David Icke.
[03:18:56.989 --> 03:19:01.191]  He worked there on the Top Morning Show, the equivalent of Good Morning America for a decade.
[03:19:01.211 --> 03:19:02.991]  He was a top world champion goalie.
[03:19:04.031 --> 03:19:05.392]  He was a liberal New Ager.
[03:19:06.403 --> 03:19:07.424]  And then he learned about this.
[03:19:07.464 --> 03:19:19.413]  He was on my show like 15 years ago saying Gordon Heath and all these people would take little girls in with plastic and slit their throats and he was told this by high-level folks and and I didn't believe and I would delay him back then.
[03:19:19.453 --> 03:19:32.224]  I never do that with guests but you know if somebody says something about a public figure and I've never seen it in the news and I mean every once in a while I'll tell a host or a guest hey we're not going there you can't prove that because you know I mean I'll get sued for saying the sky's blue and
[03:19:32.964 --> 03:19:36.285]  All these years later, it came out word for word what he was saying.
[03:19:36.325 --> 03:19:40.107]  And Savelle, he said Savelle, first guy I ever heard say it, had dungeons?
[03:19:40.627 --> 03:19:47.290]  And a dungeon in his house and had sex with dead kids and would kidnap kids and kill them and ran the charities, just like Sandusky and all this.
[03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:48.210]  And guess what?
[03:19:48.410 --> 03:19:49.191]  It all came out true.
[03:19:49.211 --> 03:19:50.411]  John DeCamp died a few weeks ago.
[03:19:50.791 --> 03:19:52.472]  John DeCamp was one of the other guys.
[03:19:52.512 --> 03:19:53.813]  I said, hey, watch it during a break.
[03:19:53.953 --> 03:19:54.913]  I've never done that to you, probably.
[03:19:55.493 --> 03:20:01.696]  But he was saying, oh, in Boys Town, oh, in Penn State, they run a child kidnapping deal and they, you know, they take kids and sell them there.
[03:20:02.742 --> 03:20:03.242]  And you know what?
[03:20:04.103 --> 03:20:05.584]  Like a decade later, I'm like, wait a minute.
[03:20:06.765 --> 03:20:11.407]  John DeCamp, and I called DeCamp up and learned that he literally did have Alzheimer's and couldn't come on.
[03:20:11.748 --> 03:20:13.949]  I'm sorry, Alex, my brain's gone.
[03:20:14.049 --> 03:20:14.950]  I remember you a little bit.
[03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:16.371]  But you know, what a sweetheart.
[03:20:16.771 --> 03:20:19.272]  The point was, is that guy was on target.
[03:20:19.312 --> 03:20:20.253]  And why was he on target?
[03:20:20.433 --> 03:20:22.034]  Because he was in the CIA.
[03:20:22.334 --> 03:20:23.335]  That's why he was.
[03:20:23.755 --> 03:20:30.960]  He was in the CIA in Vietnam and after, and he was blowing the whistle because he knew about it and there were good people in the government exposing it.
[03:20:31.400 --> 03:20:33.802]  I don't want to lionize the CIA, but it's a big group.
[03:20:34.262 --> 03:20:40.566]  It's people in the CIA and the FBI and the NSA that actually fought back and exposed Hillary and the WikiLeaks.
[03:20:40.626 --> 03:20:41.546]  It wasn't the Russians.
[03:20:41.807 --> 03:20:43.488]  And that's what the globalists better understand.
[03:20:43.988 --> 03:20:46.650]  It's not just Clapper and Brennan up on TV saying we're going to kill Trump.
[03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:49.813]  They just represent con artists trying to look confident.
[03:20:50.073 --> 03:20:54.017]  The majority of people in these agencies understand, and a lot of them aren't even angels.
[03:20:54.437 --> 03:20:57.860]  But they know globalists want to end the prosperity now, and you know what?
[03:20:57.981 --> 03:21:00.143]  They don't want to give up their houses in Corvettes.
[03:21:00.443 --> 03:21:02.345]  They don't want to screw their daughter and sons over.
[03:21:02.585 --> 03:21:16.214]  They may have done bad stuff, a lot of them, but they're not ready to chop America's head off and say that all white people are the devil, because that's where this is going, is in the total Soviet-style collapse, and everybody better decide which side you're on.
[03:21:16.454 --> 03:21:23.078]  Collapse, degradation, re-education camps, giant wars, or America and prosperity and trying to reform it.
[03:21:23.319 --> 03:21:24.599]  What do you think, John Rappaport?
[03:21:26.241 --> 03:21:31.384]  DeCamp, as I recall, was it Colby who had a CI who was trained?
[03:21:32.597 --> 03:21:45.826]  Who finally sat down with him one day, you know, when DeCamp was at the end of his rope saying, you know, I've tried every possible thing that I can do to expose this high-level pedophile ring that, of course, extends into Washington, D.C.
[03:21:45.906 --> 03:21:47.567]  and big-time names and all of that.
[03:21:48.408 --> 03:21:50.369]  And Colby sat down with him and said, John,
[03:21:51.067 --> 03:21:56.591]  You just got to understand there are some things that you can't push through to a conclusion.
[03:21:57.111 --> 03:21:58.132]  You will be stopped.
[03:21:58.192 --> 03:21:59.172]  You will be blocked.
[03:21:59.252 --> 03:22:00.813]  They won't let you do it.
[03:22:01.194 --> 03:22:03.315]  You've got to come to terms with that.
[03:22:03.375 --> 03:22:04.536]  That's what this is.
[03:22:04.976 --> 03:22:11.921]  This is one of those things where, and this is a guy, you know, head of the CIA who's saying this, right?
[03:22:12.341 --> 03:22:14.782]  And by the way, I mean, the camp was Operation Phoenix.
[03:22:15.163 --> 03:22:17.684]  He wasn't on the cream puff CIA division.
[03:22:18.465 --> 03:22:18.605]  No.
[03:22:20.012 --> 03:22:22.353]  So that's where all of this went.
[03:22:22.714 --> 03:22:29.317]  And that's what happened to these two fearless women reporters at the BBC.
[03:22:30.218 --> 03:22:33.320]  I mean, 1999, Jill Dando was murdered.
[03:22:33.960 --> 03:22:35.361]  Case still unsolved.
[03:22:36.152 --> 03:22:44.581]  And then you've got the scum at Snopes coming in on this latest one with Liz McKeon saying, well, there's no evidence that she died of anything but a stroke.
[03:22:45.062 --> 03:22:49.406]  And as evidence, we know that all of the press... By the way, by the way, it's not five.
[03:22:49.446 --> 03:22:57.375]  It's like 10 Russian diplomats and ambassadors have died the last year, all in their pools or heart attacks or run over by cars.
[03:22:58.656 --> 03:23:02.801]  One of the worst parts of this for the so-called liberals was it didn't really matter who Trump was in a way.
[03:23:21.109 --> 03:23:25.551]  You know, if you just listen to what he said during the campaign, let's end globalism.
[03:23:25.871 --> 03:23:32.034]  Let's end all the free trade treaties that are, you know, nothing but just allowing corporations to run the world.
[03:23:32.715 --> 03:23:37.657]  Let's end open borders because I don't care whether you want a wall or you don't want a wall.
[03:23:37.977 --> 03:23:46.561]  If you don't vet the people coming in, you're going to get horrendous conditions, never mind the overwhelming state budgets that can't handle all this and so forth.
[03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:49.182]  And, you know, he's talking about these basic things.
[03:23:49.222 --> 03:23:50.503]  Let's bring jobs back to America.
[03:23:50.663 --> 03:23:52.725]  Let's have bulkhead doors on submarines.
[03:23:53.505 --> 03:23:59.790]  Right, so it doesn't matter that to the liberals it didn't matter so much that it was Trump.
[03:24:00.730 --> 03:24:04.113]  All that mattered was the words that were coming out of his mouth.
[03:24:04.253 --> 03:24:04.493]  Why?
[03:24:05.143 --> 03:24:09.665]  Because other nations would get the same idea, like Brexit, for example.
[03:24:09.705 --> 03:24:20.270]  In other words, people in other countries would suddenly say, you know, it seems like what's been going on here for all these years is that our country is caving into globalist influences.
[03:24:20.350 --> 03:24:21.791]  We don't have a country anymore.
[03:24:22.291 --> 03:24:24.773]  What would our country be if we took it back?
[03:24:24.933 --> 03:24:27.014]  What would it be if it were actually ours?
[03:24:27.454 --> 03:24:33.537]  How could we build prosperity at home and forget about trying to go out and cure everybody else's problems?
[03:24:34.017 --> 03:24:36.458]  And this message spread like wildfire.
[03:24:36.538 --> 03:24:40.520]  Well, this is like a silver bullet to the globalist vampire.
[03:24:40.900 --> 03:24:43.041]  It didn't matter that it was Trump saying this.
[03:24:43.121 --> 03:24:47.643]  What mattered was somebody running for president was saying it with a chance to win.
[03:24:47.663 --> 03:24:48.704]  And that's my next point.
[03:24:48.824 --> 03:24:57.147]  Don't they get that they can destroy Trump, and that'll only make him bigger, and that he's only a guy surfing a big wave, and bigger waves are coming in against them?
[03:24:57.367 --> 03:24:58.248]  Don't they get that?
[03:24:59.908 --> 03:25:00.069]  No.
[03:25:00.089 --> 03:25:01.609]  I don't think they do.
[03:25:02.189 --> 03:25:03.370]  But that's absolutely right.
[03:25:04.221 --> 03:25:11.246]  You know, like I've said before when we've talked, one of the places you can trace all this back to is Ron Paul.
[03:25:12.226 --> 03:25:24.714]  You know, when he was running for president and the networks cut him off at the knees, refused to let him say anything during the few debates he took part in, and then just cancelled him out of all the other debates because they said, well, you don't have enough support.
[03:25:24.994 --> 03:25:28.597]  And he said, well, I don't have enough support because you're not letting me on television.
[03:25:28.617 --> 03:25:29.717]  And they just said, ah, shut up.
[03:25:29.757 --> 03:25:30.378]  Go home, Ron.
[03:25:31.167 --> 03:25:44.496]  Here he is saying, audit the Fed, the invention of crazy money out of nothing by the banksters, bring the troops home, end this whole thing of American empire, stop globalism, make America strong at home.
[03:25:45.397 --> 03:25:51.061]  Millions of people began, from the left, from the right, from everywhere, began to resonate with this message.
[03:25:51.141 --> 03:25:56.905]  Well, a lot of those people got behind Trump because the words were sounding
[03:25:57.717 --> 03:25:58.919]  Pretty much the same.
[03:25:58.979 --> 03:26:01.241]  Those people are still out there and more.
[03:26:11.087 --> 03:26:15.472]  There used to be people at Huffington Post and other places that had reasonable liberal arguments.
[03:26:15.973 --> 03:26:17.594]  I wasn't even a mainline Republican.
[03:26:17.635 --> 03:26:18.936]  I would see their view, see their view.
[03:26:19.216 --> 03:26:20.398]  Didn't like either power structure.
[03:26:20.738 --> 03:26:23.341]  But now you don't see reasonable leftist articles anymore.
[03:26:23.742 --> 03:26:26.665]  It's all just frothing, one-upping each other.
[03:26:27.085 --> 03:26:29.008]  Who can be calling for more violence?
[03:26:29.368 --> 03:26:31.310]  Who can be calling us more made-up names?
[03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:35.922]  I just wonder how much further does this go, this spectacle?
[03:26:36.222 --> 03:26:39.005]  And I really know it's backfiring on them.
[03:26:39.065 --> 03:26:40.606]  So do you agree with that, A?
[03:26:40.666 --> 03:26:42.688]  And B, what does this then expand into?
[03:26:42.948 --> 03:26:43.769]  What does this lead to?
[03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:46.571]  Well, it is backfiring like crazy.
[03:26:46.591 --> 03:26:48.633]  I mean, it's like an elastic.
[03:26:49.474 --> 03:26:52.977]  It only goes so far before it snaps back because
[03:26:53.889 --> 03:26:58.474]  Millions of people are being totally alienated by what these lunatics are doing.
[03:26:58.894 --> 03:27:04.440]  They may not be standing on street corners saying, I'm alienated, but they sure are.
[03:27:04.981 --> 03:27:07.123]  And their numbers are building.
[03:27:07.523 --> 03:27:12.849]  I'll tell you one liberal publication that shocked me down to my toes in the last week or two.
[03:27:13.329 --> 03:27:13.950]  The Nation.
[03:27:15.084 --> 03:27:16.365]  Many of you, I'm sure, have heard it.
[03:27:16.405 --> 03:27:18.888]  It's maybe the oldest liberal publication in America.
[03:27:18.948 --> 03:27:19.708]  Well, look it up!
[03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:33.080]  In the last 10 days, they've published a very long investigative piece saying that the entire narrative of Trump, Russia, Russia influencing the election, is pure insanity.
[03:27:33.700 --> 03:27:35.722]  Total bull bleep.
[03:27:37.003 --> 03:27:40.425]  By consulting experts and saying, is this a hack?
[03:27:40.545 --> 03:27:41.266]  Was it a leak?
[03:27:41.346 --> 03:27:46.549]  The Wikipedia, you know, I mean the WikiLeaks emails of Clint, uh, DNC and so forth.
[03:27:47.050 --> 03:27:49.211]  And all the experts said, no, this is not a hack.
[03:27:49.251 --> 03:27:50.992]  This is a leak from the inside.
[03:27:51.372 --> 03:27:52.013]  The nation.
[03:27:53.114 --> 03:28:00.440]  The oldest liberal publication in America printed this article, and of course, hey, major media, we're not going to pick up on this, are you kidding?
[03:28:00.881 --> 03:28:07.987]  One of our allies just lowered the boom and said, the whole Russian Trump story is a total fabrication.
[03:28:08.608 --> 03:28:09.388]  And that's the point.
[03:28:10.171 --> 03:28:18.433]  People wanting to keep their intellectual honesty to a point, just from their own point of pride, how far can all this race stuff go?
[03:28:18.513 --> 03:28:23.914]  It's, I mean, they go, he never decried this, he decried it in all the tweets, all four statements, it's just not true!
[03:28:24.154 --> 03:28:33.456]  And you see headlines, bikers are protesting Trump, because they couldn't get any antifun to protest in Phoenix, so they point cameras at Trump crowds and say they're protesting Trump.
[03:28:33.516 --> 03:28:39.717]  I mean, how many times do you get caught lying before something happens to you?
[03:28:41.834 --> 03:28:42.214]  I don't know.
[03:28:42.954 --> 03:28:49.597]  I don't know what the answer to that is, except they're just, you know, CNN, MSNBC, they're just digging their own graves.
[03:28:50.277 --> 03:28:51.518]  They think they're on top.
[03:28:52.438 --> 03:28:58.261]  They're just like a bunch of psychotic children that are being called news reporters.
[03:28:58.281 --> 03:28:59.201]  Listen, you just said it.
[03:28:59.241 --> 03:29:00.482]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[03:29:00.562 --> 03:29:02.182]  I love coasting with you, but Jon Rappaport's here.
[03:29:02.202 --> 03:29:05.644]  Probably have his own show soon, as soon as we get more crew members hired to run it.
[03:29:07.478 --> 03:29:25.662]  I've run into people I've hired, people I've worked with, people I've known over the years, that as soon as they get a little bit of power, they believe driving a sports car, wearing a sports jacket, makes them like this Mr. Fancy Pants, and they don't care actually about really being successful, they want the image of it, and they get caught up in the image versus the real thing.
[03:29:25.923 --> 03:29:35.565]  And I look at CNN, MSNBC with their ratings, you know, in the last decade, and the toilet, and the rest of it, but they really believe because they get bigger and bigger panels, three people, ten people, fifteen people,
[03:29:35.845 --> 03:29:41.990]  That the more people they have in a consensus, that like it's magic tricks, it's gonna make everybody else buy into it.
[03:29:42.450 --> 03:29:45.893]  And it gets more shrill, more desperate, and people are rejecting it.
[03:29:45.933 --> 03:29:50.977]  So where do they go when it collapses, when they finally realize their own dope's a load of bull?
[03:29:51.377 --> 03:29:54.099]  Steve, Eric, Felipe, Carlos, I'm going to you.
[03:29:54.499 --> 03:29:58.943]  It's NoMoreFakeNews.com with John Rappaport.

[03:30:42.434 --> 03:30:50.537]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:30:50.837 --> 03:30:55.520]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:30:55.700 --> 03:31:02.444]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:02.504 --> 03:31:09.589]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:09.669 --> 03:31:16.533]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:16.693 --> 03:31:21.036]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:31:30.862 --> 03:31:31.563]  Available at
[03:31:32.003 --> 03:31:40.507]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, DNA Force is the flagship.
[03:31:40.887 --> 03:31:49.451]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.
[03:31:49.811 --> 03:32:06.908]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.

[03:32:31.600 --> 03:32:32.980]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:32:36.312 --> 03:32:39.193]  Accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[03:32:40.273 --> 03:32:45.514]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[03:32:45.554 --> 03:33:02.638]  This is the Info War.
[03:33:02.978 --> 03:33:04.039]  He comes in teeth.
[03:33:08.610 --> 03:33:10.671]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.711 --> 03:33:12.292]  Because there is a war on.
[03:33:12.752 --> 03:33:14.433]  Or you're mine.
[03:33:14.774 --> 03:33:18.756]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[03:33:18.796 --> 03:33:20.337]  There was something so.
[03:33:20.597 --> 03:33:23.498]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[03:33:24.379 --> 03:33:25.920]  Even though your voice had an echo.
[03:33:26.420 --> 03:33:27.161]  So much space.
[03:33:29.218 --> 03:33:39.345]  As you get in the globalist mindset, it's so cramped, so neurotic, that only when you're performing, the group think, even feel like you're alive.
[03:33:39.365 --> 03:33:45.450]  I want all the fake liberals, all the fake conservatives, all of you to know, let me say it, I've been over the mountain.
[03:33:45.730 --> 03:33:46.130]  I've seen it.
[03:33:47.071 --> 03:33:47.931]  I've seen the promised land.
[03:33:49.192 --> 03:33:55.157]  And it's not a utopia, it's where our imperfection is our perfection, and where as Martin Luther King said, I'm gonna play this clip,
[03:33:56.021 --> 03:34:01.326]  We are not about our skin color, but about what we stand for and what we do in our lives.
[03:34:01.606 --> 03:34:07.031]  And I can totally grasp what he was saying and totally believe that because it's common sense.
[03:34:07.251 --> 03:34:14.978]  I go eat food where I want, I go listen to music where I want, I go stay where I want because the people are cool, not because of what color they are.
[03:34:16.659 --> 03:34:19.982]  And the modern left and the corporate social engineers have taken all that
[03:34:20.842 --> 03:34:32.652]  And projected a Nazi ideology of race control and race identification, where everything is about what color you are, onto what they're doing, and then they're the classical Nazis by the very definition.
[03:34:33.556 --> 03:34:40.783]  Race-based tribalism, but then projecting it back onto us, their enemies, the classical liberals, a.k.a.
[03:34:40.823 --> 03:34:50.553]  Thomas Jefferson, their sworn enemy, because the American system, though never realized, in ideals, is coffin nails to their
[03:34:52.638 --> 03:34:58.821]  So here is a man being removed at major universities across the country because he didn't mention gays or transgenders.
[03:34:59.061 --> 03:35:00.522]  That wasn't even an issue then.
[03:35:00.823 --> 03:35:05.385]  But it doesn't matter because it's not all inclusive of all 175 genders.
[03:35:06.606 --> 03:35:07.947]  He is a Nazi now!
[03:35:08.667 --> 03:35:09.568]  And I'm not joking!
[03:35:10.629 --> 03:35:13.951]  We have the article on newswars.com.
[03:35:14.844 --> 03:35:16.686]  Where the ACLU apologized.
[03:35:16.706 --> 03:35:17.367]  We're sorry.
[03:35:17.748 --> 03:35:22.573]  We tweeted an image of a two-year-old baby that's white saying, think about America's future.
[03:35:22.613 --> 03:35:23.054]  You're right.
[03:35:24.616 --> 03:35:25.076]  You're right.
[03:35:26.959 --> 03:35:27.379]  You're right.
[03:35:29.061 --> 03:35:29.682]  We're sorry.
[03:35:29.942 --> 03:35:30.543]  It's racist.
[03:35:31.644 --> 03:35:33.186]  You talk about white genocide.
[03:35:37.092 --> 03:35:37.853]  I'm not stupid.
[03:35:37.893 --> 03:35:38.774]  I know it's like a prison.
[03:35:38.794 --> 03:35:42.498]  We put the whites in one area, the blacks in another, the Hispanics or Asians in different ones.
[03:35:43.019 --> 03:35:45.701]  I get what they're doing, but man, are we really this dumb?
[03:35:46.602 --> 03:35:54.731]  And of course, there is this Western white man's burden that's a little bit condescending of Rutger Kipling and white Christians where we think, you know,
[03:35:55.908 --> 03:35:58.730]  Either we're super virtuous or no, we were the super evil.
[03:35:58.830 --> 03:36:07.657]  No, the other racial groups that are just humans, they act just like us, just as bad or worse, depending on the group or people, the different cultural stuff.
[03:36:08.177 --> 03:36:11.359]  And you know, it turns out minorities can act like real asshole racists.
[03:36:11.439 --> 03:36:12.060]  Excuse my French.
[03:36:12.120 --> 03:36:13.641]  I mean, they can really get real.
[03:36:13.781 --> 03:36:14.041]  Really?
[03:36:14.081 --> 03:36:14.762]  You didn't think so?
[03:36:15.382 --> 03:36:22.885]  So we're like sitting here with the left, the Democratic Party, who's having their statues removed and blaming Republicans and white people and Trump for their statues.
[03:36:23.366 --> 03:36:28.348]  They're then blaming everybody else but themselves as their history's removed.
[03:36:28.648 --> 03:36:30.569]  They're projecting who they are onto us.
[03:36:32.770 --> 03:36:36.972]  And then now, we're just thinking, oh, well, the minorities will be virtuous.
[03:36:36.992 --> 03:36:37.532]  They'll understand.
[03:36:37.572 --> 03:36:38.052]  No, they won't.
[03:36:39.433 --> 03:36:43.895]  On average, they'll act just as bad as any other group that's hyped up into a racial operation.
[03:36:46.195 --> 03:36:49.536]  That's why it's important to be politically incorrect now on purpose.
[03:36:49.656 --> 03:36:54.378]  Even though I have so many liberal sentiments myself that I don't like doing it, it's got to be done.
[03:36:54.678 --> 03:36:56.878]  Because we've got to move the Overton window back.
[03:36:57.079 --> 03:36:59.079]  They're saying the word mother and father is evil and hurtful?
[03:36:59.759 --> 03:37:01.640]  Or family existing is bad?
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:03.981]  We've got to then pull the Overton window over here.
[03:37:04.941 --> 03:37:06.181]  I am happy to join with you today
[03:37:35.306 --> 03:37:45.956]  In what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
[03:37:50.820 --> 03:37:51.601]  I have a dream.
[03:37:51.621 --> 03:37:57.066]  That my four little children
[03:37:59.086 --> 03:38:05.570]  One day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[03:38:06.051 --> 03:38:07.592]  I have a dream today!
[03:38:07.752 --> 03:38:09.773]  Not by the content of their skin.
[03:38:09.813 --> 03:38:16.237]  Listen, all of this propaganda is all about what group you're in now.
[03:38:16.297 --> 03:38:17.078]  With this faith,
[03:38:18.144 --> 03:38:29.351]  We will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
[03:38:31.252 --> 03:38:44.961]  Let freedom ring, and when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city,
[03:38:46.107 --> 03:39:07.386]  We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
[03:39:07.726 --> 03:39:11.810]  I notice that one group that's not acceptable now in the whole liberal pantheon is Christians.
[03:39:13.906 --> 03:39:16.327]  Well, it's going to get worse before it gets better, but
[03:39:42.066 --> 03:39:55.273]  I think it's going to get better because it's going to reach a point where it's so ridiculous and so insane that people are going to stand up on their hind legs and say no, because they're going to have to.
[03:39:56.454 --> 03:40:00.136]  That's, you know, where that's where all this is heading.
[03:40:01.797 --> 03:40:06.720]  If nothing happens, you know, the steamroller comes down the street and nobody gets out of the way.
[03:40:06.780 --> 03:40:07.860]  It just keeps on going.
[03:40:08.981 --> 03:40:09.081]  But
[03:40:09.784 --> 03:40:12.586]  There reaches a point where that's not going to be alright anymore.
[03:40:14.408 --> 03:40:19.933]  And the globalists are betting on the fact that they can just keep on doing this forever.
[03:40:20.633 --> 03:40:22.174]  But you can see the desperation.
[03:40:22.815 --> 03:40:25.437]  I mean, there's real desperation there.
[03:40:26.118 --> 03:40:28.440]  Because their whole operation is being exposed.
[03:40:29.260 --> 03:40:30.281]  Completely exposed.
[03:40:31.022 --> 03:40:32.023]  And there's more coming.
[03:40:34.605 --> 03:40:37.328]  Any two nations can sit down and hammer out a trade deal.
[03:40:37.728 --> 03:40:38.229]  For example.
[03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.829]  Anybody.
[03:40:39.230 --> 03:40:39.730]  It's simple.
[03:40:40.951 --> 03:40:45.316]  It's so revolutionary that our president... ...that they call globalism free trade.
[03:40:45.336 --> 03:40:46.597]  You don't need all these treaties.
[03:40:47.842 --> 03:40:52.768]  Every nation can be as self-sufficient as it can be, and then trade for what they need.
[03:40:53.068 --> 03:41:05.583]  Well, this is exactly the opposite of what globalism wants, because this whole idea of free trade is just an entree into, we are the octopus, we control everything, cradle to grave of the entire planet.
[03:41:05.903 --> 03:41:07.104]  This is where we're going.
[03:41:07.124 --> 03:41:07.305]  Wow.
[03:41:09.090 --> 03:41:11.191]  What you're saying is so profound, but so simple.
[03:41:11.691 --> 03:41:22.075]  Trump's crime, good or bad, is that he's being the president and saying, we'll make deals on an individual basis, not sign it over to some corporate board that's secret and Congress can't see it.
[03:41:22.355 --> 03:41:27.137]  And then the left is screaming, he's a Nazi because he's trying to transfer power back to the people.
[03:41:27.177 --> 03:41:28.157]  That's ridiculous.
[03:41:29.318 --> 03:41:29.798]  Exactly.
[03:41:30.678 --> 03:41:32.759]  Bringing jobs, some jobs back.
[03:41:32.939 --> 03:41:34.920]  I don't know how many he's going to be able to bring back.
[03:41:35.791 --> 03:41:39.952]  But bringing significant numbers of jobs back to people that didn't have jobs.
[03:41:39.972 --> 03:41:41.133]  So let me ask you this on the calls.
[03:41:41.273 --> 03:41:42.353]  What is the formula then?
[03:41:42.373 --> 03:41:44.554]  Because the globals can be sophisticated.
[03:41:44.834 --> 03:41:48.295]  They have a lot of old doddering, you know, people like Pelosi and stuff up there that don't know what planet they're on.
[03:41:48.315 --> 03:41:52.576]  But their corporate controllers, it's in the WikiLeaks, they said, we're going to use race war to keep control of the public.
[03:41:52.796 --> 03:41:53.417]  Keep them desperate.
[03:41:53.457 --> 03:41:55.697]  I mean, it's really horrible hate letter to humanity.
[03:41:55.737 --> 03:41:57.238]  But they've got to know
[03:41:58.078 --> 03:42:18.992]  That the dumb downness of this isn't working on smart people, so all they've got is really gullible people, but they seem to be dumbing it down more and more and more and more piratically, but I don't mean in a piratical way, but more as a parrot, a parrot radical way, to squirping the same things and just screaming and throwing toddler fits as if it's going to finally make a submit.
[03:42:19.313 --> 03:42:22.855]  And my experience is all it's doing is waking people up that wouldn't have been involved.
[03:42:23.696 --> 03:42:24.136]  Exactly.
[03:42:26.215 --> 03:42:29.196]  They're saying everybody's dumb, so everybody's going to submit.
[03:42:29.616 --> 03:42:30.416]  Well, that's not true.
[03:42:30.976 --> 03:42:44.500]  Because the fact of the matter is, all over America right now as we speak, there are black people and brown people and yellow people and white people working in jobs side by side, like they always have for the last 40, 50 years, whatever.
[03:42:45.501 --> 03:42:46.081]  It's happening.
[03:42:46.121 --> 03:42:47.021]  It happens every day.
[03:42:48.126 --> 03:42:49.167]  And they're getting married!
[03:42:49.347 --> 03:42:50.307]  And they're having kids!
[03:42:50.867 --> 03:42:51.267]  Yeah!
[03:42:51.488 --> 03:42:52.088]  And they're going to church!
[03:42:52.108 --> 03:42:58.991]  So they look at all this stuff, and they look at all this insanity, and they look at each other and they just say, what are these people out of their minds?
[03:42:59.891 --> 03:43:02.473]  You're you, I'm me, we get along, what's the problem?
[03:43:03.173 --> 03:43:07.795]  You know, the problem, if there's any problem for us, is where's the jobs?
[03:43:09.336 --> 03:43:10.116]  That's the problem.
[03:43:10.660 --> 03:43:12.902]  So they want us to get into a what?
[03:43:12.962 --> 03:43:17.406]  A race war with each other when we work side by side in the same place?
[03:43:18.467 --> 03:43:24.973]  What we want is jobs to work side by side in the same place and apparently they don't want to give that to us.
[03:43:25.413 --> 03:43:28.336]  They'd rather we just get out on the street and start killing each other.
[03:43:28.356 --> 03:43:36.743]  That's not going to play for very long because the overwhelming majority of Americans understand, just like Martin Luther King said,
[03:43:37.529 --> 03:43:39.090]  That everybody likes to ignore.
[03:43:39.130 --> 03:43:41.372]  The content of your character.
[03:43:41.412 --> 03:43:42.813]  Well, that's an individual thing.
[03:43:42.913 --> 03:43:45.956]  Sorry, it's not a skin color thing.
[03:43:46.016 --> 03:43:47.557]  It's not a religion thing.
[03:43:48.117 --> 03:43:51.000]  Content of character is an individual thing.
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:53.982]  I work next to you at a job, you work next to me.
[03:43:54.022 --> 03:43:57.105]  Wasn't that the ultimate libertarian statement by Martin Luther King?
[03:43:57.585 --> 03:43:58.826]  Yeah, I thought so.
[03:43:59.647 --> 03:44:02.789]  I thought it was the main point of the whole thing, that speech.
[03:44:03.450 --> 03:44:04.971]  That's what he was talking about.
[03:44:06.736 --> 03:44:10.779]  And there are more and more people who do judge by content of character.
[03:44:11.860 --> 03:44:16.843]  Who say, don't tell me about this guy in terms of his race or his religion or whatever.
[03:44:17.004 --> 03:44:19.726]  You know the guy, you stand up for the guy.
[03:44:19.766 --> 03:44:20.306]  Is he dependable?
[03:44:20.326 --> 03:44:21.767]  Okay, well then he's okay with me.
[03:44:21.907 --> 03:44:23.088]  Content of character.
[03:44:23.128 --> 03:44:24.489]  Isn't that how anybody operates?
[03:44:24.569 --> 03:44:27.651]  It's off word of mouth or the way the food tastes.
[03:44:27.691 --> 03:44:29.433]  You go to a restaurant, you get sick, you don't go back.
[03:44:29.653 --> 03:44:31.074]  You go to a restaurant, it tastes great, you go back.
[03:44:32.188 --> 03:44:36.492]  Somebody tells you that you respect, hey, go to this restaurant, it's tremendous food.
[03:44:36.552 --> 03:44:38.874]  You go there, you say, yeah, it was terrific, okay.
[03:44:39.515 --> 03:44:42.057]  Content of character has nothing to do with anything else.
[03:44:42.077 --> 03:44:45.581]  And see, you just said it, the globals are trying to sabotage normal human...
[03:44:47.406 --> 03:44:51.387]  Contact and transmission of conversation.
[03:44:51.407 --> 03:44:54.909]  That's the real electrochemical, real human internet.
[03:44:55.109 --> 03:44:59.691]  They're trying to sabotage it with a jamming transmission of race, race, race, race, race, race!
[03:44:59.951 --> 03:45:02.572]  Because they know if we come together, we're going to reject them.
[03:45:03.852 --> 03:45:04.412]  Exactly.
[03:45:04.572 --> 03:45:05.493]  That's the whole deal.
[03:45:05.593 --> 03:45:06.333]  That's what happens.
[03:45:07.412 --> 03:45:13.137]  Well, did you actually meet the person who's supposed to be the horrible person who's of race X?
[03:45:13.617 --> 03:45:17.640]  Yeah, actually, I went to this restaurant, we sat down, we started talking, he's a pretty good guy.
[03:45:17.660 --> 03:45:24.005]  Yeah, probably get together, you know, whatever, shoot pool, you know, and that's the end of that story.
[03:45:24.585 --> 03:45:28.789]  It's the person-to-person communication that overwhelms everything else.
[03:45:29.395 --> 03:45:44.780]  And these maniacs and lunatics and idiots in the press, just like you say, they're trying to block that transmission of truth between people that has everything to do with content of character and say, no, it has to do with your race.
[03:45:44.820 --> 03:45:45.881]  You can't escape race.
[03:45:46.221 --> 03:45:46.841]  It's everywhere.
[03:45:46.901 --> 03:45:47.501]  It's inside.
[03:45:47.561 --> 03:45:48.121]  It's outside.
[03:45:48.161 --> 03:45:48.962]  That's all there is.
[03:45:49.582 --> 03:45:50.022]  Baloney!
[03:45:50.626 --> 03:46:02.889]  And that's why they go, oh look, Lynch Hall, oh it's a photo of a white kid, oh look, they're literally creating mentally ill basket cases where people are now just seeing clouds and thinking it's Hitler.
[03:46:03.709 --> 03:46:04.949]  Right, or stereotypes.
[03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:11.731]  That's why BuzzFeed says is milk racist, or that's why Atlantic Monthly says the Eclipse is racist.
[03:46:11.751 --> 03:46:12.691]  You go, that's insane.
[03:46:12.971 --> 03:46:16.472]  Yes, they are wounding people with insanity.
[03:46:17.435 --> 03:46:17.615]  Yeah.
[03:46:17.815 --> 03:46:18.996]  They needed to do it.
[03:46:19.056 --> 03:46:20.256]  People go, that doesn't make sense.
[03:46:20.976 --> 03:46:21.836]  You don't understand.
[03:46:21.856 --> 03:46:23.177]  This is their mission.
[03:46:24.877 --> 03:46:25.318]  That's right.
[03:46:25.618 --> 03:46:26.938]  They don't want it to make sense.
[03:46:26.998 --> 03:46:31.900]  They just want to kowtow you into submission with this.
[03:46:31.940 --> 03:46:32.160]  Yeah.
[03:46:33.044 --> 03:46:40.849]  The eclipse is racist because, well, the solar system must be racist then, and if the solar system is, the galaxy and then the universe.
[03:46:40.889 --> 03:46:43.290]  So the whole universe is racist.
[03:46:43.911 --> 03:46:45.512]  Okay, now we've established that.
[03:46:45.852 --> 03:46:47.473]  So who's going to buy that, really?
[03:46:48.033 --> 03:46:49.854]  Nobody is going to really buy that.
[03:46:50.575 --> 03:46:53.036]  They're just cutting their own throats.
[03:46:53.597 --> 03:46:57.479]  And this two-year-old or one-year-old baby, that's a blonde baby right there,
[03:46:58.502 --> 03:47:00.203]  What is that baby gonna grow up to be?
[03:47:00.684 --> 03:47:01.444]  Nobody knows.
[03:47:01.504 --> 03:47:03.085]  That's called content of character.
[03:47:03.546 --> 03:47:04.406]  That's what counts.
[03:47:04.807 --> 03:47:09.790]  Not the fact that it's blonde, it's got blue eyes, white skin, this and that, bap bap bap.
[03:47:10.531 --> 03:47:16.515]  You know, they're just liars and losers that think they can be winners.
[03:47:16.575 --> 03:47:19.377]  And how dare them project onto a child evil?
[03:47:19.638 --> 03:47:19.838]  Yeah.
[03:47:21.039 --> 03:47:21.699]  How dare they?
[03:47:21.859 --> 03:47:22.140]  Good God.
[03:47:22.180 --> 03:47:22.640]  How dare they?
[03:47:23.521 --> 03:47:24.001]  How dare they?
[03:47:24.871 --> 03:47:27.613]  It's just, it's, it's... And then the ACLU apologized.
[03:47:28.094 --> 03:47:29.014]  Eric, thanks for holding.
[03:47:29.034 --> 03:47:31.496]  You're on the air with Jon Rappaport, who I love coming and stealing the show with.
[03:47:31.556 --> 03:47:33.438]  I love co-hosting with Jon Rappaport.
[03:47:33.458 --> 03:47:35.119]  He's really one of the smartest guys I know.
[03:47:35.259 --> 03:47:37.160]  Eric, in California, you're on the air.
[03:47:38.842 --> 03:47:45.447]  Yeah, um, you know, Trump is everything that the American people thought and wanted Obama to be.
[03:47:45.967 --> 03:47:47.828]  You know, they just don't see it yet.
[03:47:48.409 --> 03:47:50.670]  And it's being hidden from them by the media.
[03:47:51.251 --> 03:47:53.933]  But, you know, I'm worried that they, you know, they might try that attack.
[03:47:54.383 --> 03:47:59.386]  That they tried in Cuba on Trump and then tried to claim that he's mentally unfit.
[03:47:59.646 --> 03:48:00.207]  You know what I mean?
[03:48:00.287 --> 03:48:01.027]  Really smart.
[03:48:01.207 --> 03:48:02.468]  You mean poison him or something?
[03:48:04.069 --> 03:48:11.454]  Yeah, you know, not kill him, but, you know, make him so he's, you know, incapacitated in some type of way.
[03:48:11.594 --> 03:48:12.434]  Eric, you're really smart.
[03:48:12.454 --> 03:48:13.535]  I don't just have to kiss your ass.
[03:48:13.595 --> 03:48:13.955]  It's true.
[03:48:14.656 --> 03:48:19.399]  My gut says they're going to poison him with something that puts him out of commission, that they have a big power struggle.
[03:48:20.179 --> 03:48:21.060]  What do you think, Rappaport?
[03:48:23.295 --> 03:48:24.476]  Uh, you know, it's possible.
[03:48:24.596 --> 03:48:25.577]  I sure hope not.
[03:48:25.737 --> 03:48:27.739]  I mean, I hope he's got some food tasters.
[03:48:28.059 --> 03:48:28.419]  I would.
[03:48:29.740 --> 03:48:39.849]  Well, I was about to say, and we're going to skip this break, that's what I'm saying is that they don't want to make him a martyr and just gun him down like Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or JFK or Bobby.
[03:48:41.270 --> 03:48:43.291]  They're going to drug him and say he's mentally ill or something.
[03:48:43.311 --> 03:48:44.572]  Is that what you were getting at, Eric?
[03:48:46.114 --> 03:48:51.338]  Yeah, you know, they have all types of different game plans, you know, but I think that's something that's definitely in their playbook.
[03:48:53.311 --> 03:49:02.444]  You know, and also, you know, they did their problem, though, honestly, because that would be a real detrimental to the movement, because Trump, one thing that we have that they don't have is a leader.
[03:49:03.105 --> 03:49:04.207]  They have no leadership.
[03:49:04.227 --> 03:49:05.589]  You know, they have they have all these.
[03:49:05.970 --> 03:49:07.832]  What's that cheese?
[03:49:07.852 --> 03:49:09.655]  Was it not enough cheese or whatever?
[03:49:10.037 --> 03:49:15.744]  They have all these soldiers and not no leaders though, you know, and no movement could survive without it.
[03:49:15.764 --> 03:49:16.565]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:49:16.625 --> 03:49:17.346]  Why is that?
[03:49:17.366 --> 03:49:24.314]  Because it seems like anybody halfway real, Biden's not perfect, but he's blue collar and I kind of think has a little bit of a heart for the economy.
[03:49:24.334 --> 03:49:26.236]  Not that he's not a good guy, he's a bad guy, but...
[03:49:26.957 --> 03:49:27.978]  They didn't even want Biden.
[03:49:28.038 --> 03:49:29.399]  Biden would have beat Trump, maybe.
[03:49:29.719 --> 03:49:37.425]  Why don't they want anybody with real, human... I mean, you hear Hillary, and who would... I mean, she sounds like a witch, and she's evil.
[03:49:37.465 --> 03:49:40.247]  Why would anybody... Why don't they have anybody real?
[03:49:40.667 --> 03:49:42.349]  And where do you think this is going, Eric?
[03:49:43.730 --> 03:49:51.916]  Well, you know, it's funny you said about Hillary, because, you know, Hillary's trying to come out with this book, trying to badmouth Trump, and then destroy his credibility, or whatever.
[03:49:52.415 --> 03:49:54.056]  And you know, it's like this, man.
[03:49:54.096 --> 03:49:58.858]  If she can't stand Trump standing behind her, then how is she supposed to take on North Korea?
[03:49:59.018 --> 03:50:14.725]  Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or,
[03:50:16.836 --> 03:50:17.456]  They're exposed.
[03:50:17.576 --> 03:50:18.557]  They're completely exposed.
[03:50:18.677 --> 03:50:21.638]  Every move they make is more exposure, you know?
[03:50:21.698 --> 03:50:26.240]  And that's been their secret the whole time, is that it was a secret and nobody knew about it.
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:29.762]  Oh, I've meant to say that so many times, I never... Exactly.
[03:50:29.842 --> 03:50:34.544]  They always built this world government on stealth, and now none of it's there, Rappaport!
[03:50:34.824 --> 03:50:35.764]  I mean, what are they gonna do?
[03:50:37.145 --> 03:50:37.445]  Yeah.
[03:50:38.105 --> 03:50:39.366]  It comes out into the open.
[03:50:39.406 --> 03:50:42.647]  That's what happens when somebody runs for president and says, guess what?
[03:50:43.587 --> 03:50:54.523]  The media are idiots and there's this thing called globalism and they're taking away your jobs and they're trying to say that America is only part of a larger structure and let's not do that.
[03:50:55.564 --> 03:50:56.446]  Let's not do that.
[03:50:56.606 --> 03:50:58.028]  Let's France be France.
[03:50:58.621 --> 03:50:59.622]  Germany be Germany.
[03:50:59.662 --> 03:51:00.822]  America be America.
[03:51:01.423 --> 03:51:02.343]  We can make deals.
[03:51:02.403 --> 03:51:03.264]  We can get along.
[03:51:03.304 --> 03:51:06.706]  We don't have to be in some cosmic... That's the key.
[03:51:06.766 --> 03:51:10.348]  We don't need some secret corporate group to make our deals.
[03:51:10.668 --> 03:51:12.909]  We're gonna make our deals and they're gonna be out in the open.
[03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:14.390]  Beautiful points, Eric.
[03:51:14.430 --> 03:51:14.991]  Anything else?
[03:51:15.731 --> 03:51:17.072]  I mean, autonomy, you know?
[03:51:17.812 --> 03:51:18.533]  Well, yeah, thank you.
[03:51:18.953 --> 03:51:19.893]  No, no, Eric, you're awesome.
[03:51:19.913 --> 03:51:20.334]  Anything else?
[03:51:21.966 --> 03:51:25.710]  Um, you know, yeah, you know, basically, you know, I'm a Californian, man.
[03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:28.312]  You know, I'm from the East Coast, but I've been living in California.
[03:51:28.652 --> 03:51:29.873]  Man, the liberals, I'm surrounded.
[03:51:29.893 --> 03:51:31.435]  I'm like an enemy territory, man.
[03:51:31.455 --> 03:51:38.901]  You know, you can't even, I'm, seriously, with Ian and Tifa and all these different people, man, they, you know, I feel like my life is in danger just because of the liberals.
[03:51:38.921 --> 03:51:39.762]  Some of them are nice, though.
[03:51:39.782 --> 03:51:40.363]  Don't get me wrong.
[03:51:40.383 --> 03:51:41.203]  Some of them are good people.
[03:51:41.964 --> 03:51:43.826]  Some are nice, and then some are like piranhas.
[03:51:45.054 --> 03:51:46.316]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:51:47.237 --> 03:51:48.318]  And you know, they're looking for Hitler.
[03:51:48.338 --> 03:51:55.727]  They need to look no further than Hillary or John Clapper, you know, trying to come out and badmouth him, talking about all this speech, this and that.
[03:51:56.187 --> 03:51:57.689]  Seriously, man, it's a joke, man.
[03:51:58.009 --> 03:52:01.994]  Honestly, the real American people know what time it is, man.
[03:52:02.014 --> 03:52:02.555]  Seriously, man.
[03:52:02.575 --> 03:52:04.277]  And the ones that don't, it's like the snowball effect.
[03:52:05.888 --> 03:52:09.410]  The Alex Jones-Trump combination, man, is deadly, man.
[03:52:09.430 --> 03:52:10.271]  They can't stop it, man.
[03:52:10.291 --> 03:52:10.551]  You know?
[03:52:10.811 --> 03:52:11.812]  Seriously, man.
[03:52:11.892 --> 03:52:12.872]  Well, I hope you're right, Eric.
[03:52:12.892 --> 03:52:13.433]  You're awesome.
[03:52:13.493 --> 03:52:14.733]  I'm just... I'm very humble here.
[03:52:14.954 --> 03:52:16.214]  I just see the common sense of it.
[03:52:16.254 --> 03:52:16.495]  It's just...
[03:52:17.506 --> 03:52:22.487]  But we got to say the Afghanistan thing, and I'm going to go to Felipe and Carlos and Steven right now, but just 60 seconds on this.
[03:52:23.067 --> 03:52:23.728]  I got to say it.
[03:52:23.788 --> 03:52:25.588]  I mean, he said it was bad to be in Afghanistan.
[03:52:25.628 --> 03:52:26.428]  We shouldn't be there.
[03:52:27.188 --> 03:52:32.070]  And I understand that we can't just pull out because then it'll be like Vietnam with them hanging off helicopters.
[03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:35.430]  So I heard he was going to like beef it up and then pull out all the way.
[03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:38.191]  But other folks say he really thinks we can win this thing.
[03:52:38.991 --> 03:52:41.492]  That's, I think, a really big mark against Trump.
[03:52:44.513 --> 03:52:46.113]  Can I say one thing real quick?
[03:52:46.153 --> 03:52:46.373]  Yes, sir.
[03:52:46.877 --> 03:52:48.257]  That's what I heard.
[03:52:48.297 --> 03:52:51.978]  I heard it's actually a pullout the next year and he knew that we want to negotiate before it happens.
[03:52:51.998 --> 03:52:53.018]  Let's see what Rappaport thinks.
[03:52:53.038 --> 03:52:57.639]  Rappaport, what do you think about the situation and Trump's announcement in Afghanistan?
[03:53:16.109 --> 03:53:22.153]  Well, just on the surface, looking at what he's proposing and so forth, you can't win a war in Afghanistan.
[03:53:22.594 --> 03:53:23.815]  I mean, that's out of the question.
[03:53:24.455 --> 03:53:29.839]  You know, I guess you could destroy the entire country, just reduce it to dust, yeah.
[03:53:30.199 --> 03:53:36.844]  But short of that, the history of the country shows you can't win a war there that's lasting.
[03:53:36.904 --> 03:53:37.725]  It's impossible.
[03:53:38.545 --> 03:53:41.528]  Because it's not a country, it's like a hundred plus tribes.
[03:53:42.176 --> 03:53:43.737]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:53:43.797 --> 03:53:52.404]  So it's not like you're dealing with a government that collapses and everybody goes, oh, okay, you're now the government, all right, we submit.
[03:53:52.484 --> 03:53:57.428]  No, it's, you know, it's got people everywhere, up in the mountains, up in the hills.
[03:53:57.769 --> 03:54:00.251]  The Soviets, you know, proved that.
[03:54:00.271 --> 03:54:01.432]  And they're all killing each other.
[03:54:01.492 --> 03:54:02.212]  Great points, Eric.
[03:54:02.252 --> 03:54:04.154]  Felipe, Felipe in California.
[03:54:04.174 --> 03:54:05.135]  Another call from Felipe.
[03:54:05.435 --> 03:54:06.796]  Thanks for holding so long, my friend.
[03:54:06.816 --> 03:54:08.017]  I apologize for having you hold that long.
[03:54:08.919 --> 03:54:09.600]  No problem, man.
[03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:21.691]  I've been praying for the President, and ever since you've been promoting Young Jeopardy, I tried out the Starter Pack, and I tried out X2, and I tried out BrainForce, and they've been amazing.
[03:54:21.731 --> 03:54:23.192]  I lost a bunch of weight.
[03:54:23.232 --> 03:54:24.814]  My friends don't even recognize me.
[03:54:25.034 --> 03:54:27.116]  Okay, so I went to the...
[03:54:28.597 --> 03:54:29.398]  We're good to go.
[03:54:52.556 --> 03:54:54.497]  The fear in his eyes was just unmistakable.
[03:54:54.557 --> 03:54:55.657]  It was weird.
[03:54:55.817 --> 03:54:57.498]  I don't like that look in people's eyes.
[03:54:57.518 --> 03:54:59.638]  I don't usually get looked at like that.
[03:55:00.558 --> 03:55:02.179]  And everyone else was pretty cool.
[03:55:03.019 --> 03:55:13.402]  I'll tell you that more people outside of the rally and outside of the protesters came to talk to me about what was going on and about their support for the show.
[03:55:13.562 --> 03:55:20.684]  So you're well-loved in Venice, despite how it looks, despite the weird communist groups it attracts.
[03:55:21.504 --> 03:55:24.947]  Uh, the vast majority of people don't want these people there.
[03:55:25.007 --> 03:55:27.388]  They look like tourists, they sounded like tourists.
[03:55:28.229 --> 03:55:29.690]  Oh yeah, they shut the anti-fi in.
[03:55:29.710 --> 03:55:30.270]  I'm going to be clear.
[03:55:32.072 --> 03:55:34.593]  Half the public in Seattle didn't know who I was.
[03:55:35.094 --> 03:55:39.817]  Of the half that did say hi, 90% were listeners and positive of every race, color, and creed.
[03:55:42.458 --> 03:55:44.740]  Maybe 1 out of 10, 15 people wanted to kill me.
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:47.642]  So what I'm saying is it's like a lunatic asylum got released.
[03:55:48.062 --> 03:55:52.946]  It's what I'm saying is they've suddenly activated and they're ready to physically attack you.
[03:55:55.464 --> 03:55:56.545]  Well, I got lucky.
[03:55:57.045 --> 03:55:59.246]  I only saw like three real Antifa there.
[03:55:59.326 --> 03:56:02.948]  I asked them where the protest rally was because they started marching.
[03:56:03.448 --> 03:56:12.473]  It went from against white supremacy to being a protest against an HBO confederate show.
[03:56:13.317 --> 03:56:14.818]  And I was like, what's going on with you?
[03:56:14.838 --> 03:56:15.999]  Like, you guys know anything about this?
[03:56:16.279 --> 03:56:18.761]  And only one guy got to see it or whatever.
[03:56:18.801 --> 03:56:20.222]  So he was saying, we have to go against this.
[03:56:20.242 --> 03:56:21.543]  And I'm like, whatever.
[03:56:21.563 --> 03:56:23.264]  They were a little bit confused.
[03:56:23.284 --> 03:56:25.246]  I was about to say, I don't even understand all that stuff.
[03:56:25.266 --> 03:56:26.507]  But thank you for the call, Felipe.
[03:56:26.527 --> 03:56:33.152]  I mean, most people, I couldn't believe how many Japanese-Americans, there's a lot of them in Seattle, and Chinese-Americans.
[03:56:34.631 --> 03:56:38.294]  Or just because a lot of Chinese that have come to America were persecuted or Falun Gong.
[03:56:38.754 --> 03:56:41.396]  I go to this one Chinese food restaurant that Falun Gong owned.
[03:56:41.957 --> 03:56:44.459]  And I was wondering why they kept buying me dinner the few times I went there a year.
[03:56:44.499 --> 03:56:48.422]  And finally I noticed it was Falun Gong literature, the Epoch Times.
[03:56:48.462 --> 03:56:50.223]  And then I talked to the owner and they're big listeners.
[03:56:50.523 --> 03:56:53.626]  They say that family killed in China for just being peaceful Buddhists.
[03:56:54.086 --> 03:56:54.987]  Like Buddhist light.
[03:56:55.467 --> 03:56:58.069]  And so again, it's not about race, it's about character.
[03:56:58.129 --> 03:56:58.710]  Right, Rappaport?
[03:56:59.369 --> 03:57:00.549]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[03:57:00.789 --> 03:57:01.349]  Exactly.
[03:57:01.690 --> 03:57:02.530]  That's what it's about.
[03:57:03.230 --> 03:57:08.871]  And I was amused by Felipe's comments, because I know Venice, California.
[03:57:09.591 --> 03:57:16.573]  It's very hard to corral all the people, the diverse piece.
[03:57:16.633 --> 03:57:17.513]  Talk about diversity.
[03:57:17.533 --> 03:57:18.694]  You want to see some diversity?
[03:57:19.094 --> 03:57:22.154]  Walk down the Venice boardwalk in California and in L.A.
[03:57:22.595 --> 03:57:24.315]  on a Sunday afternoon in the summer.
[03:57:25.415 --> 03:57:28.336]  You can't get people to line up
[03:57:28.996 --> 03:57:32.377]  You got people that are so far on the left that they're on the right.
[03:57:32.497 --> 03:57:33.658]  And yeah, and vice versa.
[03:57:33.998 --> 03:57:39.780]  You know, they've gone so far off the scale that they're... Anything that's big, they're against it, right?
[03:57:40.280 --> 03:57:44.081]  So it's... I understand how that rally changed over there.
[03:57:44.381 --> 03:57:51.264]  Yeah, because people generally look at each other and they say, okay, so what kind of a person is he or she or whatever?
[03:57:51.744 --> 03:57:52.204]  That's it.
[03:57:52.804 --> 03:57:55.225]  That's where it starts on a human level.
[03:57:55.945 --> 03:57:57.786]  And so these lunatics on the news
[03:57:58.757 --> 03:58:00.840]  I want to tell you, no, it doesn't start there.
[03:58:00.860 --> 03:58:03.765]  It starts with this big picture that we're presenting to you.
[03:58:04.246 --> 03:58:06.690]  This is good and this is evil and that's it.
[03:58:06.810 --> 03:58:08.132]  That's all you can look at.
[03:58:09.053 --> 03:58:10.275]  And people are going to reject that.
[03:58:10.395 --> 03:58:11.337]  They don't buy that.
[03:58:12.018 --> 03:58:12.218]  You know?
[03:58:14.212 --> 03:58:14.812]  We're out of time.
[03:58:14.852 --> 03:58:16.273]  I apologize to Steve and Carlos.
[03:58:16.313 --> 03:58:17.593]  Call us back tomorrow and we'll get to you.
[03:58:17.613 --> 03:58:20.635]  John, let's talk the next few days about trying to get you a regular show here.
[03:58:20.995 --> 03:58:25.317]  I'm about to go live 18 hours and 24 hours a day, and I'd like to have you part of that.
[03:58:25.697 --> 03:58:36.801]  NoMoreFakeNews.com, InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com are our sites, but it is an incredible, exciting time to be alive, and I'm all about the character of people's deeds and what they stand for, not what color they are.
[03:58:37.282 --> 03:58:38.442]  God bless you, everybody.
[03:58:38.482 --> 03:58:39.823]  Thank you so much to the Gray Crew.
[03:58:40.363 --> 03:58:41.043]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:41.083 --> 03:58:42.124]  David Nights tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[03:58:42.144 --> 03:58:42.384]  Central.
[03:58:45.937 --> 03:58:49.723]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:54.069 --> 03:58:59.838]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable
