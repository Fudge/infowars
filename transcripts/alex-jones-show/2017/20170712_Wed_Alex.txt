[00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.474]  We're good.
[00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:38.566]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have total proof that this entire attack on Donald Trump Jr.
[00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:40.107]  is a total hoax.
[00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:45.551]  The breathless media that's given us so many other big lies is acting like this is the end.
[00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.812]  Because it's the end for them.
[00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.953]  They are the regional party.
[00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:51.735]  They're losing control.
[00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:59.406]  That's why they have Scarborough, who's never really a Republican, saying he's leaving them to create this illusion because they're imploding.
[00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:04.634]  But first, another scumbag, another authoritarian is fearing for his future as well.
[00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:05.876]  John Bowne reports.
[00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:07.515]  Triggered.
[00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:17.545]  North Korea has declared that Washington has reached the tipping point of nuclear war after the United States and South Korea held a live-fire drill against Pyongyang.
[00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:25.033]  According to the Telegraph, long-range B-1B Lancer bombers reportedly flew close to the heavily fortified border
[00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:35.037]  Between two Koreas and dropped 2,000 pound bombs, North Korea's Rodong propaganda newspaper warned not to play with fire on a powder keg.
[00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:44.862]  Of course, North Korea escalated tensions after launching an ICBM test on the 4th of July that showed significant progress in North Korea's attempt to threaten Alaska.
[00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:46.903]  I must say that today is a dark day.
[00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:53.869]  It is a dark day because yesterday's actions by North Korea made the world a more dangerous place.
[00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:59.931]  Their illegal missile launch was not only dangerous, but reckless and irresponsible.
[00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:04.532]  It showed that North Korea does not want to be part of a peaceful world.
[00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:10.760]  They have cast a dark shadow of conflict on all nations that strive for peace.
[00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:22.149]  Yesterday's act came from the same vicious dictator who sent a young college student back home to his parents, unresponsive and in a coma.
[00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:36.313]  For Americans, the true nature of the North Korean regime was painfully brought home with the images of two guards holding Otto Warmbier up as they transported him from a prison he should never have been in.
[00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:45.902]  Otto Warmbier is but one person out of millions who have been killed, tortured, or deprived of their human rights by the North Korean regime.
[00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:53.250]  North Korea once again launched a ballistic missile in blatant violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
[00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:56.762]  This is totally unacceptable.
[00:02:57.722 --> 00:03:05.564]  Japan launched a strong protest directly against North Korea immediately after the launch and condemned the act in the strongest terms.
[00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:13.606]  Here, I express once again our strong condemnation of this utterly unacceptable provocation.
[00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:22.892]  Japan demands that North Korea immediately cease all ballistic missile and nuclear development programs and provocations.
[00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:27.756]  Japan will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.
[00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:33.046]  Although missile defense systems in Alaska have been deployed, the U.S.
[00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:38.069]  Missile Defense Agency will undergo testing of those anti-ballistic missile systems.
[00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.732]  The test was conducted on the 30th of May out in the Pacific.
[00:03:42.352 --> 00:03:45.294]  Here's a blue water chart that depicts the test construct.
[00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:49.296]  The ground-based interceptor was fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
[00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:54.760]  It was tracked by a TIPI-2 on Wake Island and the SPX in the northwest Pacific.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.862]  Giving the interceptor solution to Vandenberg to intercept a target launched from the Kwajalein Atolla in the Marshall Islands.
[00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:08.603]  The red indicates the target flyout and the green indicates the GBI from Vandenberg.
[00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:15.485]  Reuters reported that the United States plans on carrying out new tests on its THAAD missile defense system in Alaska.
[00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:17.346]  This according to two U.S.
[00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:17.906]  officials.
[00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:18.506]  No one
[00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:34.112]  Except the military-industrial complex wants yet another war in a foreign land ultimately paid for by the blood and sweat of American lives after decades of failed attempts to decapitate the head of one of the most brutal regimes in history.
[00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.333]  The potential for a strike by U.S.
[00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.474]  and South Korea's special forces has ratcheted up
[00:04:39.814 --> 00:04:55.642]  As reports of Kim Jong-un's appearances have decreased, and South Korean Assembly Member Lee Ko-woo reports Kim is so engrossed with collecting information about the decapitation operation, so engrossed that he is reportedly moving only at dawn.
[00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:58.583]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.574]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:46.544]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:48.706]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:56.433]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:05:56.753 --> 00:05:59.716]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.496]  It's amazing!
[00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:06.904]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:11.228]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:18.455]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:06:19.096 --> 00:06:22.239]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:42.527]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:46.709]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:57.713]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:06:58.514 --> 00:07:03.636]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:10.518]  To celebrate this July 4th, I want to ask everybody to redouble their efforts, to spread the word, and to take action against tyranny.
[00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.780]  We have store-wide free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com through July 4th.

[00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:33.307]  So for myself, the InfoWars crew, and my family, I want to wish you all a wonderful 4th of July, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:40.188]  We accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.974]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:47.437]  This is the Infowar.
[00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:13.200]  I call this an information war.
[00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:41.365]  And it is.
[00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:43.786]  But information's a big word.
[00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:46.767]  If you look at mainstream media, it's hoax war.
[00:08:47.987 --> 00:09:00.190]  Every time they give us another Russia nothing burger, it doesn't matter how many internal videos we have from CNN or MSNBC admitting they know it's a fraud, they just continue to recycle the same old lies.
[00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.891]  Last night it's breaking!
[00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:08.653]  Trump had a beauty pageant in Russia and shook hands with a Russian billionaire.
[00:09:08.993 --> 00:09:09.893]  Here's the photo.
[00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:12.404]  We saw that a year ago.
[00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:13.945]  Last July.
[00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.006]  We saw that a month ago.
[00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:16.427]  We saw that yesterday.
[00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:21.231]  They just keep recycling the same six or seven nothing burgers.
[00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:23.913]  If we had Donald Trump Jr.
[00:09:25.514 --> 00:09:27.135]  talking about selling out U.S.
[00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:38.744]  concessions on uranium for $30 million, or selling out missile secrets to China or Russia, I would say
[00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:44.248]  That we need to basically arrest him.
[00:09:47.149 --> 00:10:02.334]  But instead, ladies and gentlemen, Hillary skates having illegal servers, deleting 30 plus thousand emails, meeting secretly with Putin, selling out to Gazprom and other big interests.
[00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:18.826]  Russia buying off the Clintons is a very small piece of the tens of billions their foundation's gotten and the crimes they've committed, from child sex trafficking to looting, money that's given to charities.
[00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:20.588]  I mean, you name it, they've done it.
[00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.275]  Missile secrets to China.
[00:10:23.575 --> 00:10:24.957]  Missile secrets to North Korea.
[00:10:25.317 --> 00:10:28.800]  Nuclear reactors that can create A-bomb fissile material.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.223]  That mainstream news, type in, thank the Clintons for North Korea's nukes.
[00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:34.985]  I mean, that's even the New York Times.
[00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:40.449]  You're talking serious espionage, but they're globalists.
[00:10:40.469 --> 00:10:42.091]  They're selling everybody out.
[00:10:43.532 --> 00:10:48.116]  And as long as you're selling out all the nation states and screwing people over, the globalists are all for it.
[00:10:49.411 --> 00:11:01.161]  But the claims that he met for 15-20 minutes with this Russian lawyer, who it does turn out is hooked up with the Kremlin, and who 4chan has now found and confirmed.
[00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:02.502]  We went to her Facebook and Twitter.
[00:11:02.842 --> 00:11:03.283]  It's true.
[00:11:03.343 --> 00:11:09.008]  This Russian lawyer that said she had dirt on Hillary but didn't?
[00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:27.047]  Turns out 4chan, we're posting it to InfoWars.com right now, has been in anti-Trump rallies, not once, but at least twice, out front, front tower, even holding up women with hijab signs, part of the George Soros funded operation.
[00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:30.635]  So is she a double agent, a triple agent?
[00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:31.216]  We don't know.
[00:11:31.276 --> 00:11:35.443]  But back over the weekend, Drudge had the headline, the first to make the point, was Donald Jr.
[00:11:35.523 --> 00:11:36.004]  set up.
[00:11:36.685 --> 00:11:41.854]  There's these dozens and dozens of email exchanges and, you know, come see this, come see that.
[00:11:41.894 --> 00:11:43.056]  Yeah, they've got dirt on Hillary.
[00:11:44.884 --> 00:11:49.526]  And they spin the whole thing like, see, it's proof of the collusion.
[00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:56.289]  First, it was that the Russians had physically hacked the election and stolen it with bots and gotten into computers.
[00:11:56.709 --> 00:12:05.733]  That's what Hollywood and the EU and the mainstream media and the Saudi Arabians and the Pope and the globalists were doing, ganging up on America, saying we couldn't have Trump.
[00:12:06.394 --> 00:12:08.735]  What they're guilty of, they accuse us of.
[00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.911]  But if Donald Jr.
[00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:20.241]  is reached out to by a Russian that says they have evidence of Hillary being a Russian agent, he would be derelict in his duty as a citizen.
[00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:23.365]  He would be a lazy slob.
[00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:25.127]  I think he would be complicit!
[00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:28.217]  If he didn't at least report it or go check it out.
[00:12:28.818 --> 00:12:33.901]  Now what did the Washington Post, Think Progress, and all the Democratic Party outlets say yesterday?
[00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:45.989]  They spun what I said when I said he deserves a medal for going out and investigating Russian spies, claiming that I said he was going to investigate her as a Russian spy, the Russian lawyer.
[00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:48.911]  No, I clearly said Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:51.652]  See, they want to make it sound like it makes no sense.
[00:12:51.952 --> 00:12:53.853]  Look, Jones has the funniest theory.
[00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.374]  He says that Trump Jr.
[00:12:55.394 --> 00:12:57.255]  was checking to make sure she wasn't a Russian spy.
[00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:08.340]  No, we know she was a Russian spy, and we know she's been caught with the Russian ambassador, and caught at Soros events, and caught being a basic globalist.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.741]  You don't think the Russians aren't infiltrated with those same people?
[00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:15.223]  Double players, triple players, double agents, triple agents?
[00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:19.367]  That's what the Washington Post and all of them have articles out about.
[00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:21.848]  The worst spin is from Alex Jones.
[00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:22.829]  Look how pathetic.
[00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.510]  Oh really?
[00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.652]  It's pathetic to say Hillary has Russia ties that are admitted?
[00:13:27.992 --> 00:13:28.992]  Even in the New York Times?
[00:13:29.273 --> 00:13:30.994]  Hillary's Russia problem?
[00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:34.536]  30 plus million to give over a third of our uranium?
[00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:36.877]  Making gas deals to sell us out?
[00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.379]  She's the one selling out our industry.
[00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:40.919]  Selling out our infrastructure.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.401]  Selling out critical minerals.
[00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.742]  Critical components.
[00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:49.584]  But Russia is a minor player, as I've hammered.
[00:13:50.825 --> 00:14:11.838]  It's the Communist Chinese that are the ones that, since the 70s, have an official government plan to have their own people migrate here, leave their families there under Chinese control, and then keep a leash
[00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:14.827]  On the people that are here in the U.S.
[00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:16.648]  by their family members that are there.
[00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:20.749]  And I have a stack of news on that subject today.
[00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:25.371]  Chinese intelligence networks in the United States include 25,000 spies.
[00:14:25.792 --> 00:14:28.113]  It's way more than that.
[00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:32.655]  Report 25,000 Chinese spies embedded in the U.S.
[00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:33.355]  Bill Gertz.
[00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:39.998]  Chinese billionaire warns America China has 25,000 spies who are ready to destroy the United States.
[00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:45.504]  Max Slavo and, of course, Jamie White, writing for InfoWars.com.
[00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:50.226]  So that's all coming up, the real threats, the real issues.
[00:14:52.688 --> 00:15:00.632]  First, I want to get to a clip of Donald Trump back on July 27th of last year, a little less than a year ago, 11 and a half months ago.
[00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:03.683]  And what did he say there?
[00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:10.510]  He didn't say it in some meeting for 15 minutes, 20 minutes with a Russian lawyer who promised to have dirt on Hillary.
[00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.631]  Opposition research.
[00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:13.593]  He didn't have it in some hallway.
[00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:14.875]  He didn't have it at some banquet hall.
[00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:18.539]  He had it at a press conference.
[00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:35.783]  And he said, I've never met Putin, I don't have Russian interest, I know nothing about Russia, but I know this, I don't care who's got the emails, they're illegal, there's 30,000 of them, and I don't care who's got it, some guy in a basement or the Russians, if you can find them, release them!
[00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:39.436]  The media spun that he was saying, hack Hillary, Russia.
[00:15:39.796 --> 00:15:40.336]  No, don't worry.
[00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:42.576]  She knew she was putting classified stuff on a server.
[00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:46.897]  She then had plausible deniability, like putting a briefcase under a park bench.
[00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:52.118]  Then the KGB comes in 1972 and, you know, picks up the microfiche.
[00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:54.159]  It's the same garbage.
[00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:59.300]  Oh, I actually left the plans in a McDonald's bag and then threw it in a trash can.
[00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:03.389]  And then that way, the FBI's there videotaping and are taking photos.
[00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:06.931]  Oh, you didn't know the Russians were going to come by and get that out of the trash.
[00:16:09.953 --> 00:16:13.075]  But they know we have a political memory of fighting the Russians.
[00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:27.025]  And so they play up on that when it was the Democrats who were always in bed with the Russians because they shared the socialist, communist ideology with the Russians and basically have adopted it here, long after the Russians
[00:16:27.984 --> 00:16:28.524]  Got rid of it.
[00:16:29.185 --> 00:16:31.366]  They got rid of the disease, partially.
[00:16:32.086 --> 00:16:32.806]  Gave it to us.
[00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:37.148]  But, in the beginning, the globalists and Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:39.169]  Morgan gave it to them in 1917.
[00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:41.230]  So, we gave them the disease.
[00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.151]  They got really sick and almost died.
[00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:44.552]  Tens of millions did.
[00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:46.192]  But it came back.
[00:16:46.332 --> 00:16:48.073]  It blew back, like it always does.
[00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:49.694]  What comes around, goes around.
[00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:50.534]  Karma.
[00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:51.975]  You reap what you sow.
[00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:57.413]  I hope you can find Hillary's missing emails.
[00:16:57.473 --> 00:16:59.016]  He said that openly!
[00:16:59.036 --> 00:17:01.180]  Oh, but see, Donald Jr.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.386]  did in private what his father did publicly.
[00:17:04.646 --> 00:17:05.828]  The search for truth.
[00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:08.714]  Opposition Research.
[00:17:09.014 --> 00:17:31.241]  The Democrats and this very Russian lawyer, who we now have at George Soros events and Trump demonstrations, anti-Trump demonstrations, this very lady, now it turns out is connected to the Democrat Party think tank, Opposition Research Firm, that produced the PP Water Sports pissgate.
[00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:33.802]  It's totally fake and people are being sued over.
[00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:36.887]  See how far that goes?
[00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:39.030]  See how it just gets worse and worse?
[00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:46.041]  She's involved with the group, with the Salacious Steel dossier.
[00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:47.744]  London Independent is reporting.
[00:17:49.912 --> 00:17:51.073]  Fusion GPS.
[00:17:51.574 --> 00:17:53.215]  She's involved at Soros events.
[00:17:53.255 --> 00:17:55.717]  She's involved at protests against Trump.
[00:17:56.458 --> 00:18:02.583]  She's involved in all this garbage trying to manipulate political movements the Russians are manipulating.
[00:18:02.904 --> 00:18:04.145]  Liberal movements.
[00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.367]  That's the movements they've always had success with.
[00:18:09.184 --> 00:18:12.127]  Trying to get purchased with conservative movements, but it's not working.
[00:18:12.388 --> 00:18:14.410]  Of course the Russians are trying to play both sides.
[00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.012]  They don't know who's going to be in power.
[00:18:16.252 --> 00:18:19.756]  That was the Russian statement last year, was we don't care who gets elected.
[00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:21.899]  The deep state's still going to want war with us.
[00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:22.940]  Russia was right.
[00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:31.190]  But regardless, it's the Communist Chinese that have penetrated us via the Clintons first and foremost.
[00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:37.458]  Now let's go ahead and play Trump doing in public what they're saying is the end of the world for Donald Jr.
[00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:39.321]  The only crime of Donald Jr.
[00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:40.722]  is not being more hardcore.
[00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:44.064]  It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia.
[00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:44.944]  It is so far-fetched.
[00:18:44.964 --> 00:18:45.924]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:47.284]  Honestly, I wish I had that power.
[00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.322]  I'd love to have that power.
[00:19:11.322 --> 00:19:14.044]  But Russia has no respect for our country.
[00:19:14.824 --> 00:19:17.886]  And that's why, if it is Russia, nobody even knows it's probably China.
[00:19:19.607 --> 00:19:21.168]  Or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.
[00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:24.790]  But it shows how weak we are.
[00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.092]  It shows how disrespected we are.
[00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:32.114]  Assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major
[00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:39.864]  It's a total sign of disrespect for our country.
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:47.148]  Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore, and they certainly have no respect for our leader.
[00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:48.929]  So I know nothing about it.
[00:19:48.949 --> 00:19:50.890]  It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.
[00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.070]  Yes.
[00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:53.056]  What do I have to get involved with Putin for?
[00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:54.077]  I have nothing to do with Putin.
[00:19:54.097 --> 00:19:55.157]  I've never spoken to him.
[00:19:55.197 --> 00:19:57.699]  I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
[00:19:58.159 --> 00:20:05.964]  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.
[00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:10.728]  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
[00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:19.153]  So, Trump has the pure instincts of a thoroughbred, real McCoy, Americana, God-loving.
[00:20:19.994 --> 00:20:21.075]  You've done nothing wrong.
[00:20:22.338 --> 00:20:23.879]  You don't have the 30,000 emails.
[00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:25.299]  You're not in bed with the Russians.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.981]  Hillary is in bed with their companies.
[00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:32.323]  Hillary is in bed with their weapons producers for the uranium, all of it.
[00:20:32.703 --> 00:20:33.964]  She's caught red-handed.
[00:20:34.164 --> 00:20:39.546]  The Podestas, all of them, selling us out seven ways to Sunday.
[00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:51.572]  Obama kills the Russia investigation during the campaign because he knows it leads to the Podesta brothers and Hillary and himself and George Soros because they've all been screwing each other over and selling the country out.
[00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:53.736]  And so they're scared.
[00:20:53.776 --> 00:20:54.557]  Trump gets elected.
[00:20:54.597 --> 00:20:55.238]  What are they going to do?
[00:20:55.658 --> 00:20:57.420]  Double down with the Russia narrative.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.563]  Because they were always worried about the Russia narrative.
[00:20:59.723 --> 00:21:00.884]  They know what was in the emails.
[00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:03.467]  So in case it came out, they'd already put it on Trump.
[00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:07.051]  And then once he got in, they got even more scared, so they had to keep putting it on him.
[00:21:07.251 --> 00:21:11.196]  But there's Trump saying, if you have the emails, release the emails.
[00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:12.657]  I don't know who's got them.
[00:21:12.677 --> 00:21:13.397]  Probably China.
[00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:14.718]  Probably somebody in their basement.
[00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:16.359]  But whoever's got them, release them!
[00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:18.620]  The story is the illegal server.
[00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:20.241]  The story is the illegal emails.
[00:21:20.482 --> 00:21:23.483]  The story is the WikiLeaks emails with all the crimes they're committing.
[00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:25.585]  And rigging the election.
[00:21:25.765 --> 00:21:27.526]  And rigging the polls.
[00:21:27.826 --> 00:21:30.908]  And rigging the debates.
[00:21:33.189 --> 00:21:34.070]  And selling us out.
[00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.892]  So what do you do when your whole world's coming down?
[00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:41.523]  You just hoax it again and say Trump's in bed with the Russians.
[00:21:41.783 --> 00:21:44.725]  And of course, as Paul Watson said, how do we know it's pure bull?
[00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:48.828]  They're saying we're funded and directed by the Russians.
[00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:53.888]  At the Federal Elections Commission with no proof and that they want to have hearings.
[00:21:53.988 --> 00:21:55.090]  Oh, I bet you do.
[00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.432]  Please throw me in that briar patch.
[00:21:57.712 --> 00:21:58.213]  Please!
[00:21:58.533 --> 00:21:58.994]  Please!
[00:21:59.334 --> 00:21:59.835]  Please!
[00:22:00.135 --> 00:22:00.615]  Please!
[00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:01.336]  Please!
[00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:06.802]  I don't get one red stinking cent from the Rooskies.
[00:22:07.323 --> 00:22:09.405]  I get it from our audience and everybody knows it.
[00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.046]  What a load of crap.
[00:22:12.054 --> 00:22:38.072]  If the Russians are trying to make us Christian, and pro-Second Amendment, and cutting back the illegals coming across 60 plus percent now in just six and a half months, and three trillion in the stock market, and rebuilding our military, and firing all these VA people, and getting billionaires involved to make massive hundred million dollar donations into the VA, and just, and getting us out of the unelected TPP, and getting us out of the carbon tax,
[00:22:39.722 --> 00:22:45.124]  I mean, if that's what the Russians are doing, wow, thank you, Mr. Putin, but it's not.
[00:22:45.525 --> 00:22:46.925]  It's ridiculous.
[00:22:50.066 --> 00:22:52.648]  But again, they're starving for anything.
[00:22:53.008 --> 00:22:54.488]  CNN's exposed as a fraud.
[00:22:54.528 --> 00:22:56.149]  The Meemers are destroying them.
[00:22:56.169 --> 00:23:03.372]  Their ratings go from almost nothing to just absolutely, almost unreadable on the graph.
[00:23:03.792 --> 00:23:06.053]  And their answer is, they've been waiting with this.
[00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:07.594]  Big question, how'd they get
[00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:25.126]  The whole email chain from both sides, from Donald Trump Jr., called the National Security Agency under Obama with a giant illegal dragnet, spying on thousands of prominent people with live-time real humans listening.
[00:23:25.466 --> 00:23:28.008]  Tens of millions have everything they do being recorded.
[00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:36.124]  I mean, Sheriff Arpaio's office, when they left, released just a snapshot of a few thousand public figures' names.
[00:23:36.424 --> 00:23:38.986]  Michael Savage, Alex Jones, Donald Trump.
[00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:43.728]  Let me tell you something, I never had the nerve to call his private apartment at Mar-a-Lago, but I have the number.
[00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:47.670]  I've got the numbers at Trump Tower, not just the general number, the other one.
[00:23:50.316 --> 00:23:52.557]  Those are all numbers that were on that NSA thing.
[00:23:53.457 --> 00:23:59.539]  They had an office phone number that I had a landline, that I only use for radio interviews, that nobody else had.
[00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:03.220]  And that number said Alex Jones' office number.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.320]  They even knew my private phone number.
[00:24:07.201 --> 00:24:11.902]  And this was six years ago, under Obama, in the middle of his administration.
[00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:16.522]  They're not listening to me to see if I'm a rooskie, folks.
[00:24:17.183 --> 00:24:21.630]  They're listening because they know I'm exposing their criminal activity.
[00:24:26.617 --> 00:24:28.500]  These people are sick.
[00:24:30.578 --> 00:24:35.359]  And they work for special interests that want to dominate and want to control America.
[00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:37.920]  We've been the biggest, baddest, freest country in the world.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.540]  You control us, you control the world.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:46.242]  They want to loot us, they want to rob us, and then they want to have us so poor and so stupid, we can't resist, even politically.
[00:24:47.422 --> 00:24:52.504]  But all that's failing, and so everything they do is classical military to demoralize us.
[00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:55.805]  We're failing, we're losing, we're pathetic.
[00:24:56.645 --> 00:24:57.465]  It's all over.
[00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:04.043]  They've got all these illegal wiretaps going, all this spying.
[00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:05.785]  Those are the big scandals.
[00:25:06.966 --> 00:25:15.354]  It just came out yesterday that Comey perjured himself to Congress, even in the Hill newspaper reported it, and it was a classified memo he should have given the Attorney General.
[00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:21.199]  Those are real felonies just like Hillary's server that she used
[00:25:22.364 --> 00:25:24.806]  As a giant data dump to sell the country out.
[00:25:25.046 --> 00:25:29.510]  You don't just think the Office of Personnel Management hack of now 21 million U.S.
[00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:35.234]  government folks and the entire database of spies, agents, assets was given to the Chinese.
[00:25:36.415 --> 00:25:39.417]  You don't just think they got in and got all that in one database.
[00:25:39.457 --> 00:25:40.999]  It's not even supposed to be in one database.
[00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:44.862]  It was given to them as a sellout, just like the Panama Canal.
[00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:51.729]  Just like 99% or 98% of rare earth minerals, we've been sold out on purpose.
[00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.011]  We've been set up by the globalists.
[00:25:54.191 --> 00:26:00.356]  That's why Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs sends out tweets going, how's your infrastructure week going?
[00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:01.877]  America's pathetic.
[00:26:01.957 --> 00:26:03.118]  I just got back from China.
[00:26:03.298 --> 00:26:03.899]  Amazing.
[00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:05.640]  Yeah, try whatever you want.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.044]  And then Atlantic Monthly, the sun is setting on America.
[00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:14.447]  I want to play this two-minute piece when we come back from break, right now.
[00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:17.848]  Powerful piece coming up that Mike Zimmerman put together.
[00:26:18.328 --> 00:26:22.830]  But before we do that, I want to play why he's really the criminal, why they really hate him.
[00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:30.512]  I have this clip of him last week in Poland, we should air every segment, where he said, you'll never overthrow the West, you'll never defeat us.
[00:26:31.073 --> 00:26:34.694]  He's talking about radical Islam, globalism, because they're at war with it.
[00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:37.539]  The left's like, how racist of him?
[00:26:37.579 --> 00:26:38.099]  How evil?
[00:26:38.459 --> 00:26:44.363]  It's the globalists, it's Soros, it's the Islamists that say they're going to overthrow Christianity.
[00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:46.524]  They're going to overthrow our open, free societies.
[00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:48.505]  They're going to not have tolerance.
[00:26:48.665 --> 00:26:53.988]  They're going to make us adopt their liberal, globalist, anti-human, anti-family garbage.
[00:26:55.529 --> 00:27:01.612]  They're the ones saying we're going to overthrow you in Atlantic Monthly and in the New York Times.
[00:27:03.714 --> 00:27:04.914]  Think about their America hate.
[00:27:05.034 --> 00:27:05.515]  I love how
[00:27:06.638 --> 00:27:22.136]  One of the things that happens routinely when I'm out in public, if there's big crowds around, because it is a minority of folks, usually white, trendy yuppies, last time I got caught on tape I was like at the JW Marriott downtown interviewing Roger Stone in a hallway, and a guy walks by and goes, TRAITORS!
[00:27:23.137 --> 00:27:23.598]  I go, excuse me?
[00:27:23.618 --> 00:27:25.159]  He goes, yeah, you work for the Russians!
[00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:27.906]  And I go over and the guy's a big liberal.
[00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:28.987]  They hate America.
[00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:30.148]  They hate free market.
[00:27:30.328 --> 00:27:31.449]  They hate the Second Amendment.
[00:27:31.469 --> 00:27:32.630]  They hate everything we stand for.
[00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.132]  But then now they get to feel good and go, you traitors!
[00:27:37.393 --> 00:27:37.953]  Call me a traitor.
[00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:39.194]  Tell me how I'm a traitor.
[00:27:42.377 --> 00:27:43.317]  Tell me how I'm a traitor.
[00:27:43.678 --> 00:27:44.698]  Tell me how I'm garbage.
[00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:46.720]  Tell me how I'm a piece of filth.
[00:27:49.693 --> 00:27:51.654]  They just go, you're, you're, you're, you're a Russian!
[00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:53.216]  Oh yeah, I'm a Russian.
[00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.077]  It's, it's, it's, they're the globalists.
[00:27:55.117 --> 00:27:56.378]  They're the ones getting rid of the country.
[00:27:56.558 --> 00:27:57.719]  They're the ones overthrowing it.
[00:27:57.879 --> 00:27:58.980]  They're the ones conquering it.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:05.404]  They're the ones that want austerity and a government that gives you welfare or corporate jobs so if you don't play ball, they cut your money off.
[00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:12.149]  They're the people that want you owing your soul to the company store living on one big giant sharecropping plantation.
[00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:16.532]  Gulag Archipelago, Gulag Casino model.
[00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:30.799]  And they know it, and they can't stand you're struggling loose, that the American system is coming back from the brink of death and roaring back like a fiery phoenix, and they're pissing their pants because they belong to the Little Weenie Club.
[00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:33.901]  They belong to the Mount America's Head on the Wall Club.
[00:28:35.575 --> 00:28:42.518]  They want to get together and be part of a society that runs things, instead of individuals that are part of the great animating contest.
[00:28:43.278 --> 00:28:44.438]  They don't want free societies.
[00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:46.939]  They want locked up, controlled societies.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.600]  That's their spirit!
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.721]  And Trump knows it!
[00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:51.941]  And he says, you will never overthrow the West!
[00:28:52.162 --> 00:28:53.602]  You will never overthrow tolerance!
[00:28:53.762 --> 00:28:55.063]  You will never overthrow freedom!
[00:28:55.283 --> 00:28:57.404]  And they go, YES WE WILL!
[00:28:58.064 --> 00:28:59.304]  In all the newspapers!
[00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:00.645]  Declared enemies!
[00:29:00.925 --> 00:29:01.965]  Declared traitors!
[00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:03.206]  Declared scum!
[00:29:04.667 --> 00:29:06.767]  So let's play it like High Noon to Vampires.
[00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:07.968]  Here's what they hate.
[00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:10.408]  Because these words are true.
[00:29:10.608 --> 00:29:11.769]  These words are sunlight.
[00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:13.629]  These words certify him as real.
[00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:15.189]  And you know a man by his enemies.
[00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:15.890]  Here it is.
[00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:25.692]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[00:29:26.212 --> 00:29:28.373]  Our values will prevail.
[00:29:28.813 --> 00:29:30.753]  Our people will thrive.
[00:29:31.073 --> 00:29:34.094]  And our civilization will triumph.
[00:29:34.654 --> 00:29:39.515]  And Russia has now dialed into the West, decided to go with the West, because Russia is both the West and the East.
[00:29:41.455 --> 00:29:47.157]  Russia is now becoming Christian, paying people to have kids, not letting them sexualize children, arresting the pedophile rings.
[00:29:48.417 --> 00:29:50.297]  The world's life instinct is coming back.
[00:29:50.357 --> 00:29:52.398]  Now when we return, powerful peace.
[00:29:52.678 --> 00:29:55.678]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.598 --> 00:29:59.279]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:13.528]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[00:30:14.128 --> 00:30:17.308]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[00:30:17.728 --> 00:30:24.189]  And that's why whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:32.551]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:34.092]  And it gets worse.
[00:30:34.452 --> 00:30:45.560]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:53.086]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[00:30:53.766 --> 00:31:06.091]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president.
[00:31:06.612 --> 00:31:18.517]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[00:31:19.037 --> 00:31:31.368]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:39.696]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[00:31:40.296 --> 00:31:47.118]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[00:31:47.738 --> 00:31:57.941]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[00:31:58.642 --> 00:32:02.843]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[00:32:04.565 --> 00:32:08.086]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:32:08.546 --> 00:32:14.588]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:17.789]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.170]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.811]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:25.611]  The left
[00:32:25.951 --> 00:32:26.892]  ...controls culture.
[00:32:26.932 --> 00:32:27.893]  They control art.
[00:32:27.973 --> 00:32:29.214]  They control entertainment.
[00:32:29.494 --> 00:32:36.600]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.041]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:32:39.522 --> 00:32:43.385]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:32:43.445 --> 00:32:45.507]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:32:46.127 --> 00:32:51.513]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:32:51.773 --> 00:32:58.020]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.781]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:32:59.942 --> 00:33:01.123]  It's available right now.
[00:33:01.443 --> 00:33:03.625]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:14.136 --> 00:33:18.265]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:18.987 --> 00:33:20.290]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:33.012 --> 00:33:45.943]  If you just joined us, I played it in the second segment, Donald Trump back in July of last year saying, if there's evidence of Hillary with the Russians, that the Russians have, or there's evidence of where the missing emails are, I don't care who's got it, release them.
[00:33:46.764 --> 00:33:47.885]  They've committed the crimes.
[00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:51.426]  Russia, if you have the emails, release them.
[00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:55.028]  China, a guy in your bedroom, whoever's got them, release them.
[00:33:55.268 --> 00:33:57.069]  The issue is she committed the crime.
[00:33:57.429 --> 00:33:58.790]  She had the server illegally.
[00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.151]  She had the classified information illegally.
[00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:02.752]  She deleted it illegally.
[00:34:03.032 --> 00:34:05.073]  Let's not let them change the subject.
[00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:06.833]  That's the fact.
[00:34:07.434 --> 00:34:08.614]  That's the issue.
[00:34:08.894 --> 00:34:10.535]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:34:10.655 --> 00:34:12.036]  deserves a medal.
[00:34:12.947 --> 00:34:17.788]  We have to stop being intimidated by MSM because they're the big glitzy establishment media.
[00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:26.331]  I swear it's only people that are quasi-establishment, like old Republicans and Democrats and people, that still think they have any power.
[00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:32.353]  All Megyn Kelly did attacking us was make people love us more and give us more support.
[00:34:33.153 --> 00:34:35.713]  People are like patting me on the back saying, man you're taking a lot of heat.
[00:34:36.254 --> 00:34:37.154]  Taking a lot of heat!
[00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:39.957]  From disgraced scum?
[00:34:40.977 --> 00:34:42.578]  It's wonderful to have filth!
[00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:48.462]  Imagine in 1944 if I was alive and Hitler came out and said Alex Jones is horrible and evil.
[00:34:49.362 --> 00:34:50.783]  You think people would be buying me lunch?
[00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:55.146]  These people are a joke!
[00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:58.308]  And Megyn Kelly's nosedive continues!
[00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:01.750]  And it wasn't because they didn't want to see Infowars.
[00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.891]  Our ratings just go up and up.
[00:35:03.191 --> 00:35:06.733]  It's that they identified themselves as going after the populist.
[00:35:08.413 --> 00:35:13.216]  And I may stumble and I may sometimes be a train wreck, but folks know I'm swinging for the fences.
[00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.336]  I'm going all in.
[00:35:14.756 --> 00:35:16.397]  I'm so committed, I just love it!
[00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:19.018]  The Animating Contest of Liberty is incredible!
[00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:27.803]  I got so much energy, I'm as high as a kite on history, on will, on courage, on not being a slave, on commitment.
[00:35:29.144 --> 00:35:30.444]  So stop thinking me, folks.
[00:35:30.524 --> 00:35:33.026]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away from taking on these people.
[00:35:33.854 --> 00:35:44.697]  Bunch of pedophiles, bunch of pedophile apologists, bunch of radical Islamicist pushers, bunch of scum that loves misery and wants to pull us down with them, and it ain't happening.
[00:35:45.798 --> 00:35:49.359]  They absolutely hate it when Trump says they want to overthrow the West, they're going to fail.
[00:35:49.579 --> 00:35:51.320]  They're the ones saying overthrow the West.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:58.642]  And folks, the thing is, it's not people from Mexico, or people from Brazil, or people from South Africa that want to overthrow the West.
[00:35:59.884 --> 00:36:06.907]  It's the intellectual elites who want to overthrow the idea of the middle class and the Renaissance.
[00:36:08.127 --> 00:36:11.349]  They want to overthrow the ladders up for everybody.
[00:36:11.689 --> 00:36:12.589]  They're greedy.
[00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:13.910]  They're hateful.
[00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.991]  It's not people in the third world that want to overthrow the West until they get here and get brainwashed.
[00:36:19.312 --> 00:36:20.452]  They want to get here.
[00:36:21.973 --> 00:36:27.355]  And they wouldn't be a problem getting here if they don't have disease, if they're not criminals,
[00:36:28.447 --> 00:36:49.342]  And if they're not indoctrinated by George Soros and the globalists, the problem is they've been victims of globalism, then they bring the victims in and blame the average person for what happened to them under globalism, when the globalists are trying to exploit everyone and trying to get rid of the final checks and balances that have made us the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:36:49.382 --> 00:36:52.644]  We're not perfect, but believe me, we're heads above the rest.
[00:36:53.485 --> 00:36:54.185]  Now here's a piece.
[00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:59.001]  That is in a way an ode to the Dana Loesch piece in the NRA.
[00:36:59.021 --> 00:37:01.301]  I'm going to put out a lot of these style ads I've done in the past.
[00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:02.262]  I'm going to do it in the future.
[00:37:03.322 --> 00:37:04.283]  Just an ad for freedom.
[00:37:05.283 --> 00:37:09.345]  Nobody's paying for this ad, except I want my children to have a Second Amendment.
[00:37:09.805 --> 00:37:14.287]  And they are, they've had Black Lives Matter come out and say to the NRA, you better take
[00:37:15.222 --> 00:37:18.183]  That video down that Dana Loesch put out that is mild.
[00:37:19.023 --> 00:37:21.864]  She says, the clenched fist of truth, meaning information warfare.
[00:37:22.064 --> 00:37:23.124]  They said that means violence.
[00:37:23.424 --> 00:37:26.485]  It's BLM and all those groups funded by the globalists that are calling for violence.
[00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.186]  We're winning the info war.
[00:37:28.506 --> 00:37:31.747]  We're not putting out hashtag hunt Democrats like you are.
[00:37:32.587 --> 00:37:34.688]  We know the Republican establishment's the enemy as well.
[00:37:35.048 --> 00:37:37.069]  And we're going to politically expose them.
[00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:44.751]  They're desperate to stop Trump's agenda of revival of the economy because it will sell the idea of Americana again.
[00:37:45.998 --> 00:37:49.621]  We're going to try to make people so successful, they turn their backs on collectivism.
[00:37:51.122 --> 00:38:03.173]  See, Americans have never experienced true collectivism, so they think Venezuela, they think Cuba, they think North Korea, they think places that are under that scourge are wonderful.
[00:38:03.673 --> 00:38:05.935]  Somebody left to say, I want to be like England, free healthcare.
[00:38:07.116 --> 00:38:12.661]  Paul Watson had a strep like five years ago, for months, and they wouldn't let him see a doctor.
[00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:16.923]  They give him a little pack of aspirin and stuff and say, go home.
[00:38:19.084 --> 00:38:26.148]  And then he had to get government approval because the government clinics wouldn't give him service, but then see a private doctor.
[00:38:26.368 --> 00:38:31.070]  You have to get approval with your money to go pay for a private doctor.
[00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.751]  Talk about a classist system.
[00:38:33.971 --> 00:38:38.895]  But you have bitching and complaining idiots, and the lap of choice, and the lap of luxury.
[00:38:39.675 --> 00:38:45.260]  Thousands of restaurants per town, thousands of choices, entertainment everywhere, food overflowing.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.080]  But!
[00:38:47.121 --> 00:38:55.888]  Stupid shows like the Kardashians, where people see yachts and, you know, closets the size of your house, and then you feel guilty that you don't have that.
[00:38:56.268 --> 00:38:57.849]  Those people are miserable!
[00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.771]  Hollywood is miserable!
[00:39:04.158 --> 00:39:10.542]  But folks out at some little cow pond fishing, drinking shoddy pop and frying chicken, they're happy.
[00:39:12.243 --> 00:39:15.005]  Now, why does the left hate America?
[00:39:17.427 --> 00:39:22.590]  Because they're funded by very, very evil groups that want to bring down the idea of prosperity.
[00:39:23.251 --> 00:39:24.051]  They want feudalism.
[00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:24.952]  They want serfdom again.
[00:39:25.312 --> 00:39:26.673]  Here is the special report.
[00:39:27.193 --> 00:39:27.914]  It's red-linked.
[00:39:29.555 --> 00:39:31.876]  It's red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:33.544 --> 00:39:38.205]  And I'm asking everyone to post this video on your Facebook, on the Twitter, to retweet it.
[00:39:38.325 --> 00:39:50.888]  I'm asking everyone, Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone, everybody out there, Matt Drudge if he wants to get it out, everybody to get this video out because it goes further than the Dana Loesch video.
[00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:56.189]  It identifies what they're doing but then explains it's globalists that want to overthrow the country.
[00:39:56.509 --> 00:39:57.469]  The why.
[00:39:58.029 --> 00:39:59.190]  Why are they doing it?
[00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.770]  The final equation.
[00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.632]  Why the left hates America.
[00:40:06.455 --> 00:40:11.761]  A discussion on rising anti-American rhetoric and what's behind it.
[00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:14.745]  Learn what's behind it.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.081]  Get this video out.
[00:40:17.161 --> 00:40:20.504]  It's posted on Infowars.com right now.
[00:40:20.824 --> 00:40:21.305]  Here it is.
[00:40:22.005 --> 00:40:31.233]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:34.255]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[00:40:35.416 --> 00:40:41.878]  And that's why whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:42.218 --> 00:40:50.280]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:51.800]  And it gets worse.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.861]  These ruthless social engineers
[00:40:54.241 --> 00:41:03.351]  ...have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[00:41:03.712 --> 00:41:10.779]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:23.783]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for a resistance to our elected president.
[00:41:24.344 --> 00:41:36.207]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:49.091]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[00:41:49.571 --> 00:41:57.514]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[00:41:57.994 --> 00:42:04.796]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers,
[00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:15.649]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.556]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.171]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:26.692]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:29.333]  We have a bunch of special guests today.
[00:42:29.773 --> 00:42:36.396]  Roger Stone just landed and is going to be in studio with us in the second hour today.
[00:42:36.416 --> 00:42:42.379]  He can obviously give you a lot of inside scoop on what's going on with Jared Kushner, what's going on with Donald Trump Jr.
[00:42:42.519 --> 00:42:43.079]  and others.
[00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:45.040]  But they want Donald Trump Jr.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.921]  out of the White House.
[00:42:47.441 --> 00:42:52.464]  They want to claim he's a Russian spy because he wanted to meet with a Russian who
[00:42:54.437 --> 00:42:57.499]  Told them they had dirt on Hillary that she'd sold out to Russia.
[00:42:57.819 --> 00:42:59.420]  Isn't that what any citizen would do?
[00:42:59.921 --> 00:43:01.902]  Or anybody in a campaign for opposition research?
[00:43:02.182 --> 00:43:06.965]  That's what Hillary went over to Russia and the UK and tried to get Russians to make stuff about Trump.
[00:43:06.985 --> 00:43:08.666]  But that wasn't meeting with Russians.
[00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:10.087]  That wasn't colluding with Russians.
[00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:18.893]  And now we have the article up on Infowars.com confirmed.
[00:43:19.193 --> 00:43:21.775]  We have Geo located as well, along with 4chan.
[00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:36.100]  This lawyer has been photographed at multiple George Soros sponsored Linda Sarsour Islamic feminist marches in front of Trump Tower in Chicago and other cities.
[00:43:37.321 --> 00:43:42.965]  And those photos are now up on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:47.028 --> 00:43:54.690]  And Paul Watson has an article dealing with the fact that, again, she was caught meeting with the Russian ambassador, even though she says she has no connection to the Russian government.
[00:43:55.911 --> 00:44:01.512]  We're going to be looking at all of this coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:03.653 --> 00:44:07.254]  Now, before I go any further, I want to play a Mark Dice report.
[00:44:09.082 --> 00:44:12.483]  And then I'm going to come back and get into the latest on Donald Trump Jr.
[00:44:12.503 --> 00:44:16.025]  and where I think all that's going, and the latest on North Korea and so much more.
[00:44:16.345 --> 00:44:19.386]  Also what's happening with Obamacare, what's happening with tax cuts.
[00:44:19.846 --> 00:44:22.127]  That's all coming up ahead of all these guests we have today.
[00:44:22.147 --> 00:44:23.528]  I want to play this report.
[00:44:24.508 --> 00:44:26.509]  Not liking Amy Schumer is sexist.
[00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:31.311]  Again, her show has one star less on Netflix, so they take away the star rating program.
[00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:35.532]  They force feed her on the front pages of Netflix, Amazon, everywhere.
[00:44:35.852 --> 00:44:36.733]  You rejected
[00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:47.360]  You don't want to hear this man-hating, you know, person that tries to teach women their identity as loving Hollywood and, you know, hating men so that men turn further away from women and vice versa.
[00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:50.142]  Men are then taught to be arrested development idiots as well.
[00:44:50.582 --> 00:44:52.843]  This is all an attack on the species, killing chivalry.
[00:44:53.583 --> 00:44:56.945]  But Mark Dice breaks it all down, not liking Amy Schumer to sexist.
[00:44:56.965 --> 00:44:57.325]  Here it is.
[00:44:58.356 --> 00:45:06.701]  Just a heads up, there's gonna be some foul language in this video because we're talking about the demonic pig, Amy Schumer, and I'm gonna play a clip or two of some of her stand-up.
[00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:10.443]  And guys, if you don't think it's hilarious, you are sexist.
[00:45:10.703 --> 00:45:12.745]  This according to InStyle Magazine.
[00:45:13.225 --> 00:45:16.127]  Dudes, Amy Schumer is not too vulgar.
[00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:17.948]  You are just sexist.
[00:45:18.268 --> 00:45:24.111]  Victoria Morehouse writes, The first time it happened, I was sitting at a bar with the guy I had been seeing and his friends.
[00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:29.073]  I mentioned that I had just seen Trainwreck and thought it was the most hilarious thing I had ever seen.
[00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.394]  And then I cried from laughing so hard.
[00:45:31.954 --> 00:45:32.895]  Who was in it again?
[00:45:33.035 --> 00:45:35.016]  One of the friends asked from across the table.
[00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:41.799]  When I told him who the star and writer was, Amy Schumer, he responded, Oh, I don't think she's funny.
[00:45:42.099 --> 00:45:43.079]  My jaw dropped.
[00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:45.200]  We don't all have the same sense of humor.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:51.482]  Some people hate The Office and I think it's a comedic masterpiece, but I was slightly shocked by this dude's response.
[00:45:51.962 --> 00:45:54.243]  Inside Amy Schumer was a viral sensation.
[00:45:54.523 --> 00:45:58.744]  How could this guy not appreciate her for the comedy giant she is?
[00:45:59.284 --> 00:46:07.608]  I rattled off her list of accomplishments, her hilarious sketches, her endlessly retweeted jokes, and his response stopped me dead in my tracks.
[00:46:08.228 --> 00:46:09.609]  She's too vulgar, he said.
[00:46:10.009 --> 00:46:10.789]  My face reddened.
[00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:11.950]  I was incensed.
[00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.910]  Too vulgar!
[00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.151]  What does that even mean?
[00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:16.732]  Of course, the truth is I knew exactly what it meant.
[00:46:17.292 --> 00:46:19.874]  And Amy Schumer has dealt with the issue straight on!
[00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:25.057]  Too vulgar is a criticism I've heard levied against Schumer more than just one night at the bar.
[00:46:25.537 --> 00:46:28.759]  I've had other guys casually tell me that her jokes can be gross.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:39.026]  And part of me wonders if it's just because she's getting real about her vagina, and if you've read the first chapter of The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, you would know what I'm talking about.
[00:46:39.226 --> 00:46:41.789]  Let's check out some of this hilarious vulgar comedy.
[00:46:42.009 --> 00:46:46.394]  Here's a clip from her latest stand-up special, which got one star on Netflix.
[00:46:46.814 --> 00:46:51.800]  This is the part, by the way, if there's children in the room, you're gonna want to turn down the volume or just watch this at a later time.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.161]  Don't get me wrong, you guys.
[00:46:53.882 --> 00:46:54.623]  We love your c***.
[00:46:55.623 --> 00:46:56.444]  Only complaint?
[00:46:56.704 --> 00:46:57.724]  We want more of it!
[00:46:58.505 --> 00:46:58.865]  Mark!
[00:47:00.006 --> 00:47:00.306]  Mark!
[00:47:00.586 --> 00:47:00.806]  Mark!
[00:47:01.086 --> 00:47:02.987]  We want to do snow angels in it!
[00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:04.328]  Yay!
[00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.512]  Yay!
[00:47:10.612 --> 00:47:14.774]  I'm sorry, but the last thing I want to hear about is Amy Schumer talking about having sex.
[00:47:15.094 --> 00:47:16.815]  Excuse me now while I go puke!
[00:47:17.216 --> 00:47:19.997]  Gee, I wonder why her special got one star on Netflix.
[00:47:20.217 --> 00:47:22.058]  Maybe she'll be funnier in this Bud Light commercial.
[00:47:22.238 --> 00:47:24.620]  Because beer commercials are usually pretty funny, right?
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.961]  Bud Light Party here to discuss equal pay.
[00:47:26.981 --> 00:47:29.301]  Women don't get paid as much as men and that is wrong.
[00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:31.022]  And we have to pay more for the same stuff.
[00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:31.422]  What?
[00:47:31.442 --> 00:47:31.822]  Yeah.
[00:47:31.962 --> 00:47:32.462]  Cars.
[00:47:32.782 --> 00:47:33.022]  What?
[00:47:33.362 --> 00:47:34.083]  Dry cleaning.
[00:47:34.343 --> 00:47:34.583]  What?
[00:47:34.943 --> 00:47:35.503]  Shampoo.
[00:47:35.663 --> 00:47:35.923]  What?
[00:47:36.443 --> 00:47:38.144]  You pay more but get paid less?
[00:47:38.204 --> 00:47:39.224]  That is double wrong!
[00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:41.925]  I'm calling everyone I know and I'm telling them about this!
[00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:42.865]  This has got to stop!
[00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:52.348]  That's Seth Rogen, by the way, who just made fun of a Donald Trump supporter while he's still laid in the hospital recovering from being stabbed nine times from a liberal terrorist.
[00:47:52.768 --> 00:47:54.869]  Bud Light proudly supports equal pay.
[00:47:54.889 --> 00:47:57.490]  That's why Bud Light costs the same no matter if you're a dude or a lady.
[00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.811]  Yeah, Mom, you have to pay more for a car than Dad!
[00:47:59.971 --> 00:48:01.152]  No one treats my mom like this!
[00:48:01.752 --> 00:48:03.673]  By the way, this is not a Saturday Night Live skit.
[00:48:03.933 --> 00:48:05.533]  This is a real Bud Light commercial.
[00:48:05.833 --> 00:48:12.376]  Somebody actually thought it would be a good idea to market beer by promoting feminism and the gender pay gap hoax!
[00:48:12.696 --> 00:48:16.498]  Here's Amy Shamu explaining why so many people just don't like Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:16.818 --> 00:48:23.106]  If you say the name Hillary Clinton, you know, in America, you get incredible responses.
[00:48:23.306 --> 00:48:27.191]  There'll be those who love her, and there'll be those with visceral hatred on their faces.
[00:48:27.211 --> 00:48:32.638]  Well, that's what I'm saying with the not being informed, because those people aren't informed.
[00:48:34.147 --> 00:48:37.528]  You know, they... If you go, why don't you like Hillary?
[00:48:37.568 --> 00:48:39.648]  They'll go, she lied about her emails.
[00:48:39.828 --> 00:48:41.089]  What else is she gonna lie about?
[00:48:41.749 --> 00:48:44.369]  People get one fact and that's what they latch on to.
[00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.790]  It was just that one little fact.
[00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.910]  Just that one little thing.
[00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:51.231]  Of course, it had nothing to do with the fact that she's one of the most corrupt politicians in history!
[00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:55.592]  Just in case you didn't know, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is Amy Schumer's uncle.
[00:48:55.812 --> 00:48:58.773]  So, liberal psychosis apparently runs in the family.
[00:48:58.973 --> 00:49:04.057]  Speaking of that mental disorder, here comes a shameless plug for my new Liberalism Find It Gear t-shirts.
[00:49:04.377 --> 00:49:07.339]  Get yours in the link in the description below from my new online store.
[00:49:07.559 --> 00:49:07.999]  I'm Mark Dice.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.700]  Thanks for watching.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.502]  Subscribe to my channel if you're new and check back here every day for new reports.
[00:49:11.842 --> 00:49:12.783]  And I'll see you soon.
[00:49:13.543 --> 00:49:13.904]  There you go.
[00:49:13.924 --> 00:49:14.604]  He's a great guy.
[00:49:14.624 --> 00:49:15.405]  Be sure and support him.
[00:49:16.164 --> 00:49:23.726]  Speaking of support, ladies and gentlemen, we've got on really soft, nice, high-quality fabric, really comfortable, high-quality shirts.
[00:49:24.346 --> 00:49:24.986]  It's only $19.95.
[00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:26.726]  CNN is fake news.
[00:49:27.127 --> 00:49:29.347]  On the back it says Infowars.com is real news.
[00:49:29.707 --> 00:49:31.108]  Infowars.com on the right shoulder.
[00:49:31.708 --> 00:49:37.949]  A great way to spread the word and stand up to the globalists and meet like-minded people and exercise your First Amendment.
[00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:40.850]  We have CNN as terrorists as well.
[00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.912]  With Kathy Griffin on the front, it's all there.
[00:49:44.532 --> 00:49:54.719]  Also, DNA Force, with the organically produced Bio, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more, is back in stock after five plus months, being sold out.
[00:49:54.799 --> 00:49:57.341]  It is 20% off, out of the gates.
[00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:02.344]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very best we could come out with, possibly.
[00:50:02.745 --> 00:50:09.170]  Most people only sell this at medical facilities, just because this type of stuff isn't sold at Whole Foods of this caliber.
[00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:14.514]  People only expect this type of quality from medical facilities, even though it's not prescription.
[00:50:14.994 --> 00:50:19.538]  Bio, PQQ, CoQ10, the other compounds are so amazing.
[00:50:19.938 --> 00:50:21.359]  DNA Force, back in stock.
[00:50:21.379 --> 00:50:22.740]  Your purchase funds the operation.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.281]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:50:24.922 --> 00:50:27.404]  We have the Z-Shield with the Shilajit.
[00:50:28.284 --> 00:50:32.307]  And other compounds, the zeolites that take the heavy metals and toxins out, that's 30% off.
[00:50:32.547 --> 00:50:34.889]  We have free shipping extended throughout the month of July.
[00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:39.692]  And we have got a bunch of specials that are going to have to end soon on Super Metal Vitality.
[00:50:40.533 --> 00:50:42.914]  And on things like Brain Force, because they're about to sell out.
[00:50:43.255 --> 00:50:46.257]  Looks like more will be in at the end of the month, but I can't sell out of these things.
[00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:49.379]  So I'm going to go back to full price on those by the end of the week.
[00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:50.900]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139X2.
[00:50:55.824 --> 00:50:58.450]  The deep earth source of iodine that nobody else has got.
[00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.795]  It's available at Infowarslife.com as well.
[00:51:01.075 --> 00:51:01.577]  We'll be back.
[00:51:11.676 --> 00:51:13.097]  My friends, we have done it.
[00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:19.839]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[00:51:20.459 --> 00:51:25.982]  This is the answer to the globulous war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[00:51:26.282 --> 00:51:32.504]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[00:51:32.724 --> 00:51:33.064]  Doctor?
[00:51:33.084 --> 00:51:34.625]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:51:35.045 --> 00:51:39.547]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[00:51:42.438 --> 00:51:46.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[00:51:46.882 --> 00:51:47.462]  Thank you, Dr. Group.
[00:51:48.383 --> 00:51:50.785]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[00:51:51.286 --> 00:51:52.507]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[00:51:53.227 --> 00:51:53.988]  This is the move.
[00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.449]  This is unprecedented.
[00:51:55.469 --> 00:51:58.292]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[00:51:58.572 --> 00:51:59.132]  Oh my God!
[00:51:59.152 --> 00:51:59.993]  What the hell?
[00:52:00.213 --> 00:52:00.914]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:01.875]  Get out of here!
[00:52:01.895 --> 00:52:02.415]  Shut this down!
[00:52:02.435 --> 00:52:03.216]  This is not safe!
[00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:04.237]  This is not... Hold on!
[00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:04.897]  Settle down!
[00:52:05.358 --> 00:52:05.458]  Get...
[00:52:05.738 --> 00:52:06.498]  Get another doctor.
[00:52:06.538 --> 00:52:07.079]  Something's wrong.
[00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:08.019]  Something's wrong with him.
[00:52:08.039 --> 00:52:08.559]  Help him.
[00:52:08.579 --> 00:52:10.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[00:52:10.681 --> 00:52:11.561]  I take it personally.
[00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:12.922]  Do not have those problems.
[00:52:13.582 --> 00:52:16.103]  Again, these are authorized verbs.
[00:52:16.483 --> 00:52:17.364]  Well known to be safe.
[00:52:18.745 --> 00:52:19.765]  Please, doctor.
[00:52:20.145 --> 00:52:20.986]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[00:52:21.206 --> 00:52:23.867]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut the commercial for just a moment.
[00:52:24.087 --> 00:52:24.587]  Cut, cut, cut.
[00:52:24.647 --> 00:52:25.688]  Get everybody out of here.
[00:52:30.134 --> 00:52:31.435]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:32.515]  It's awesome.
[00:52:32.975 --> 00:52:34.816]  Just not this awesome.
[00:52:35.176 --> 00:52:35.497]  Oh my God!
[00:52:35.577 --> 00:52:36.777]  What the hell?
[00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:39.939]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[00:52:40.499 --> 00:52:46.482]  It is satire to illustrate in a satirical way the incredible power of Super Male Vitality.
[00:52:47.628 --> 00:52:55.675]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[00:52:56.156 --> 00:53:00.159]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:03.563]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[00:53:03.583 --> 00:53:05.084]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[00:53:05.124 --> 00:53:06.045]  It takes some focus.
[00:53:06.805 --> 00:53:08.287]  Up, up, and away!
[00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:19.456]  Securing super-male and super-female vitality has never been easier.
[00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:24.057]  Because in the month of July, it's 30% off and free shipping.
[00:53:24.377 --> 00:53:31.099]  Get hungry to defeat the globalists and fund the tip of the spear while securing super-male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:40.141]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:44.922]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:47.413]  This is the Infowar.
[00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:28.895]  So, we got a president trying to cut taxes, trying to repeal Obamacare, and the same scumbag Republicans that helped write Obamacare with the Democrats, they're blocking it!
[00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:32.107]  But they can't stop him killing the TPP.
[00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:33.887]  It would totally transfer our sovereignty.
[00:54:34.328 --> 00:54:41.250]  Or the big carbon tax that was over $10 billion a year, just kicking it off that we were supposed to pay.
[00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:44.611]  It ratchets up to almost a trillion dollars a year by 2030.
[00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:56.796]  We're talking about a $100 trillion tax per decade, according to Davos, on the world via carbon taxes, but only Western Europe and the United States are under it.
[00:54:58.237 --> 00:54:59.257]  So he's done so much.
[00:54:59.277 --> 00:55:01.178]  I mean, a good Supreme Court justice?
[00:55:01.258 --> 00:55:03.279]  Imagine, we'd have Hillary right now.
[00:55:04.479 --> 00:55:08.881]  But it's an American sport now to just expect they're corrupt and just hate your leaders.
[00:55:09.281 --> 00:55:14.283]  Well, if America does that, there's going to be a civil war in this country and the globalists are going to lose it.
[00:55:14.583 --> 00:55:16.424]  But I believe we can fix things peacefully.
[00:55:17.324 --> 00:55:19.025]  Because the New World Order has overreached.
[00:55:19.665 --> 00:55:21.105]  The entire Trump Jr.
[00:55:21.145 --> 00:55:22.106]  thing is a hoax.
[00:55:22.866 --> 00:55:24.607]  If he was selling out our uranium,
[00:55:25.703 --> 00:55:26.466]  Are missile secrets?
[00:55:27.228 --> 00:55:29.476]  Are in rooms being documented?
[00:55:30.444 --> 00:55:31.124]  Being recorded?
[00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:33.525]  Selling out interest for money?
[00:55:33.805 --> 00:55:36.246]  I'd say execute him for treason.
[00:55:36.926 --> 00:55:45.269]  But when Cain, who is a globalist, treasonous minion of Hillary, calls it treason, boy, that is certainly taking one to know one, huh?
[00:55:45.729 --> 00:55:48.911]  Because it's Cain and the globalists that have been involved in all this.
[00:55:49.591 --> 00:55:50.411]  Trump Jr.
[00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:51.411]  deserves a medal.
[00:55:51.832 --> 00:55:58.014]  He deserves an award for trying to go ferret out the proof of Hillary selling us out to the communists.
[00:55:59.014 --> 00:56:00.595]  Chinese and the Russians.
[00:56:02.216 --> 00:56:04.618]  That's what Trump said publicly on July 27, 2016.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:15.925]  But see, he said it publicly so they couldn't spin it like it was bad, because they know they're changing the subject from her criminal activity on to Russians.
[00:56:16.225 --> 00:56:19.908]  He's saying, I don't know who's got the information, but he says release it.
[00:56:20.368 --> 00:56:23.050]  Here is President Trump last year.
[00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:27.702]  It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia.
[00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:30.324]  It is so far-fetched, it's so ridiculous.
[00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:31.805]  Honestly, I wish I had that power.
[00:56:33.005 --> 00:56:34.146]  I'd love to have that power.
[00:56:35.166 --> 00:56:37.888]  But Russia has no respect for our country.
[00:56:38.648 --> 00:56:41.729]  And that's why, if it is Russia, nobody even knows it's probably China.
[00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:45.011]  Or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.
[00:56:46.552 --> 00:56:48.593]  But it shows how weak we are.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.603]  It shows how disrespected we are.
[00:56:53.663 --> 00:57:03.712]  Assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country.
[00:57:04.492 --> 00:57:10.997]  Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore, and they certainly have no respect for our leader.
[00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:12.719]  So I know nothing about it.
[00:57:12.739 --> 00:57:14.720]  It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.
[00:57:15.572 --> 00:57:16.893]  What do I have to get involved with Putin for?
[00:57:16.913 --> 00:57:17.933]  I have nothing to do with Putin.
[00:57:17.973 --> 00:57:18.993]  I've never spoken to him.
[00:57:19.053 --> 00:57:21.534]  I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
[00:57:21.994 --> 00:57:29.797]  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.
[00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:34.579]  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.541]  Now what we need is for Donald Jr.
[00:57:39.561 --> 00:57:43.983]  to come out and have a press conference with his father and say, just as my father said last year,
[00:57:45.387 --> 00:58:09.195]  Publicly, whoever has evidence of a crime, be it the Vietnamese, be it the Germans, be it the Mexicans, be it folks in Argentina, Russia, doesn't matter, Israel, you've got evidence of a crime, espionage, missing children, drug running, whatever it is, why call 911, call 311.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:18.987]  It isn't them trying to get the Russians to manipulate the election, getting into machines.
[00:58:19.067 --> 00:58:20.909]  It's give us the evidence of a crime.
[00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:22.992]  That's not hacking an election.
[00:58:23.252 --> 00:58:26.776]  That's what Hillary was trying to do with her dossier, her pee-pee gig that was made up.
[00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:30.701]  But it's okay when Hillary goes to Russia and makes stuff up.
[00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:32.544]  When we actually try to find out the truth, oh, we're bad.
[00:58:34.212 --> 00:58:38.578]  But see, the conservative media piles on at Fox News, all trying to undermine the president.
[00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:40.701]  The only person not doing it is Sean Hannity.
[00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:42.944]  Infowars.com, spread that link.
[00:58:43.264 --> 00:58:44.185]  We're in an info war.
[00:58:44.626 --> 00:58:46.128]  We're going to win this against these enemies.
[00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:47.490]  They're the outsiders.
[00:58:47.971 --> 00:58:48.792]  They're the globalists.
[00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:49.873]  They're the threat.
[00:58:50.053 --> 00:58:51.375]  And they hate you and your family.
[00:58:51.435 --> 00:58:51.776]  Know that.
[00:58:54.286 --> 00:59:00.149]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:01.570]  The contest is simple.
[00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:07.112]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[00:59:07.312 --> 00:59:14.496]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[00:59:14.656 --> 00:59:21.218]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:21.318 --> 00:59:31.181]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[00:59:31.381 --> 00:59:38.924]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:59:39.124 --> 00:59:49.088]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[00:59:49.209 --> 00:59:52.550]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:53.550]  This is Kit Daniels.
[00:59:56.392 --> 01:00:00.494]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.314]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.655 --> 01:00:11.556]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:11.596 --> 01:00:14.820]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:33.434 --> 01:00:41.658]  Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, just now that we're getting a clearer picture of her, looks like she's a double or triple agent of Deep State.
[01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:43.399]  Probably not even a Russian agent.
[01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:50.923]  Hanging out at Soros events, hanging out at anti-Trump rallies, hanging around with the Democratic Party.
[01:00:52.463 --> 01:00:57.306]  We've got the report up on Infowars.com from Adan Salazar.
[01:00:57.766 --> 01:00:59.607]  And then after that, I don't have my mouse.
[01:01:00.498 --> 01:01:04.499]  My mouse has disappeared out of here.
[01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:09.260]  So maybe during the next break I can get a new mouse or something so that I can pull that up for folks.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:09.881]  But there it is.
[01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:10.861]  Photos!
[01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:13.662]  Russian lawyer attended Chicago anti-Trump rally.
[01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:22.184]  Photos suggest that the globalist operative is a Democrat and an anti-Trump operative.
[01:01:23.157 --> 01:01:25.079]  Thank you, I now have the article in my hands.
[01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:26.760]  Well, I mean, it's beyond that.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:32.725]  She also said that she didn't know any Russians in the government, and then she's photographed with a Russian ambassador.
[01:01:33.746 --> 01:01:38.891]  But you know somebody by their fruits, and she looks like she is a deep state operative.
[01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:40.072]  Most people are!
[01:01:40.092 --> 01:01:41.753]  Because then you play both sides, you see.
[01:01:41.773 --> 01:01:43.715]  The globalists are against all nation states.
[01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:47.638]  Multiple photos of her from her own account.
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:52.831]  And then she tells him she's got all this dirt on Hillary, and then she doesn't.
[01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:59.933]  Then they want them to talk about sanctions, which they could then claim is illegal, but they wouldn't talk about that.
[01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:02.854]  So isn't that just special?
[01:02:03.434 --> 01:02:08.175]  Out at the old George Soros events, holding up pictures of women in hijabs.
[01:02:10.296 --> 01:02:11.976]  Linda Sorcerer signs.
[01:02:14.237 --> 01:02:16.998]  So, she has been a busy little beaver
[01:02:18.387 --> 01:02:19.808]  They have another Soros-funded protest.
[01:02:19.848 --> 01:02:35.683]  The White House demands prosecution for Donald Trump, but never for Hillary and the illegal server and the emails and selling us out to the foreign powers and her and Bill giving the fizzle material and reactors in North Korea and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:02:35.983 --> 01:02:37.545]  But what's Trump's big crime?
[01:02:37.565 --> 01:02:40.408]  I'm going to play this and then come back with Roger Stone and get into a bunch of these clips.
[01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:53.431]  It's saying you will not overthrow the West, because the globalists are saying in Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times, we hate Christians, we hate white people, we hate Protestants, we hate Catholics, and we're going to overthrow the West.
[01:02:53.711 --> 01:03:09.145]  And the best way is put our pedophile Pope in, and then get all his other pedophiles in there, and then totally take over the church that way, and overturn religion, and overturn everything, and bring in your globalism, and sexualize children like they're doing to the public schools.
[01:03:10.973 --> 01:03:13.574]  Trump can't reverse the decline of white Christian America.
[01:03:13.994 --> 01:03:15.475]  And again, they make it all racial.
[01:03:15.515 --> 01:03:17.416]  What about the decline of the West?
[01:03:17.996 --> 01:03:21.258]  The globalists don't want any people that are middle class or wealthy.
[01:03:21.538 --> 01:03:25.520]  And I know I keep hammering and hammering that, but here he is in Poland last week.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.161]  We should air this every segment.
[01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:28.521]  This is his big crime.
[01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:31.923]  I mean, they're on the news on CNN going, look how racist this is, how hateful.
[01:03:32.203 --> 01:03:35.785]  Yes, we're not just totally open to Islam, which won't let us go to their countries.
[01:03:37.266 --> 01:03:39.727]  We don't want to bring people in that are not tolerant.
[01:03:40.592 --> 01:03:44.613]  You know, if North Korea bordered Texas, would we want to just merge with North Korea?
[01:03:44.653 --> 01:03:45.473]  The answer's no.
[01:03:46.254 --> 01:03:47.614]  It's not compatible.
[01:03:49.155 --> 01:03:50.075]  It's not compatible.
[01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:51.935]  Here is that clip.
[01:03:52.816 --> 01:04:01.718]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:10.101]  Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.
[01:04:12.785 --> 01:04:16.487]  All right, we're going to go to break and come back with Roger Stone in studio.
[01:04:16.507 --> 01:04:22.210]  And we're going to lay out cold-bloodedly really where Trump is.
[01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.231]  But I want to break something down.
[01:04:25.331 --> 01:04:28.653]  I don't put a good face on things, as everybody knows, just to put a good face on it.
[01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:34.856]  Trump is really delivering as much as he can with a Republican leadership that's blocking
[01:04:35.799 --> 01:04:36.860]  The Patriot Republicans.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.982]  The answer is don't vote out the Republicans.
[01:04:39.702 --> 01:04:54.275]  Vote out the Establishment Republicans and replace them with Patriots and vote out more Democrats because we are within millimeters of getting big tax cuts and really being able to repeal Obamacare, not having another screwjob like the one Paul Ryan brought forward.
[01:04:54.636 --> 01:04:56.037]  Why would the Republican leadership do that?
[01:04:56.077 --> 01:04:59.099]  Because they helped write the screwjob with the Democrats.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.742]  That's why it's so sad that Democrats don't understand that.
[01:05:03.618 --> 01:05:06.559]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.880]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.181]  It is rampant out there.
[01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.042]  Here are some of its main exhibitors.
[01:05:12.962 --> 01:05:13.802]  Barack Obama.
[01:05:14.423 --> 01:05:20.965]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against.
[01:05:21.286 --> 01:05:22.286]  Washington fat cats.
[01:05:22.526 --> 01:05:23.887]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[01:05:24.067 --> 01:05:25.289]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:30.874]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because of the healthcare bill he lied about.
[01:05:31.114 --> 01:05:32.275]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[01:05:32.475 --> 01:05:34.998]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:40.343]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[01:05:41.423 --> 01:05:48.086]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[01:05:48.386 --> 01:05:57.449]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife under investigation for bank fraud.
[01:05:57.569 --> 01:05:59.230]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.
[01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.670]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:01.951 --> 01:06:02.831]  This is Owen Troyer.
[01:06:03.311 --> 01:06:04.753]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:06:04.913 --> 01:06:07.315]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[01:06:07.515 --> 01:06:14.802]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:06:15.002 --> 01:06:25.312]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:06:25.632 --> 01:06:33.216]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:43.441]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:06:43.681 --> 01:06:45.602]  And this part is most important.
[01:06:45.743 --> 01:06:52.206]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:06:52.546 --> 01:06:54.508]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:06:54.528 --> 01:06:57.150]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.512]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:07:00.532 --> 01:07:02.353]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:41.840]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:07:42.361 --> 01:07:45.943]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:07:46.503 --> 01:07:56.996]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:02.923]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:08:12.282 --> 01:08:16.183]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:17.123 --> 01:08:22.024]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.047 --> 01:08:41.207]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:42.617 --> 01:08:51.683]  It's very fortuitous that Roger Stone last week was already scheduled to be here working on a lot of behind-the-scenes journalism with us for the next three days here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:52.123 --> 01:08:52.823]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:52.843 --> 01:08:54.104]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:55.585]  He'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:56.326 --> 01:09:05.331]  We have, thanks to 4chan, and my own crew did some geolocating with the photos and found her in Chicago, New York, and other areas at anti-Trump rallies.
[01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:08.513]  And we found her with the Russian ambassador.
[01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:10.515]  She said she didn't know anybody in the Russian government.
[01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:14.238]  Though she held out, she did, when she reached out to Donald Trump Jr.
[01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:15.580]  last June.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:33.098]  And now we have this Veselnitskaya lady, who has the classic cutout of a Soros operative, who then plays both sides, popping in and out at all these Soros anti-Trump events, just like Drudge Instinct was right over the weekend saying, was Trump Jr.
[01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:33.559]  set up?
[01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.360]  But only set up in a psy-op.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.061]  From my gut level, before we even went on Hannity last night, I said this is opposition research.
[01:09:40.481 --> 01:09:41.722]  That's what I said on the show yesterday.
[01:09:42.122 --> 01:09:56.687]  I said that the Clintons went and did opposition research with this Democratic Party group and the Steele dossier in Russia, trying to get Russians to basically be false informants and say that they'd pee-peed on the president.
[01:09:57.387 --> 01:09:59.067]  Now that's admittedly discredited.
[01:09:59.127 --> 01:10:00.168]  McCain's getting sued.
[01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:01.488]  Suits in Europe.
[01:10:01.548 --> 01:10:03.929]  BuzzFeed's being sued for their fictional garbage.
[01:10:04.369 --> 01:10:07.310]  So you've got this lady tied into working with that group.
[01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.070]  You've got her at all these Soros events.
[01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:10.350]  You've got her caught lying.
[01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:14.471]  He's in the meeting with her 15-20 minutes, but he made a mistake on Hannity.
[01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.092]  He said, well, I should have done a little different.
[01:10:16.132 --> 01:10:16.292]  No!
[01:10:16.892 --> 01:10:21.377]  You deserve a medal, an award for going out and trying to get the evidence of Hillary.
[01:10:21.397 --> 01:10:22.538]  She sold out the uranium.
[01:10:22.938 --> 01:10:24.260]  She sold out the Gazprom.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.823]  There's hundreds of millions of dollars in the foundation from Russian companies.
[01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:30.145]  You've got, and the expert's right here, Roger Stone.
[01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:31.607]  This is insane.
[01:10:32.007 --> 01:10:37.373]  And Trump got it right a month after his son met with him in July of last year when he said, I know nothing about Russia.
[01:10:37.873 --> 01:10:45.559]  Russia, you know, isn't involved in this, but if the Russians do have it, or the Chinese, or somebody in, you know, their basement or in their bed, release it!
[01:10:45.599 --> 01:10:47.921]  They changed the subject from the criminal emails.
[01:10:48.342 --> 01:10:52.005]  They changed the subject from the fact that she had 30,000 of them illegally.
[01:10:52.265 --> 01:11:00.151]  They changed the subject she got caught lying saying they weren't classified, or that Comey just got caught with declassified memos that he was supposed to give the Attorney General.
[01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:04.515]  All this is happening, but first, if you just joined us, here's Trump publicly.
[01:11:04.755 --> 01:11:06.196]  Why'd you never hear about this again?
[01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:10.698]  He's public, he says it's you, you committed the crime, not me.
[01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:12.259]  If the Russians got it, release it.
[01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:15.400]  If the Russians know where kidnapped kids are, they should release it.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.381]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:11:17.961 --> 01:11:19.402]  He set it out in the open.
[01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:28.865]  They want to have Fox News even come out on his flank and criticize him, so that he then peepees his pants, a real pissgate, and then says, well maybe I should have done it better.
[01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:29.305]  Different!
[01:11:29.445 --> 01:11:30.545]  You've done nothing!
[01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:32.786]  They're the scum that sold us out to globalism.
[01:11:33.026 --> 01:11:34.827]  They're the ones that sold us out to the shycoms.
[01:11:35.027 --> 01:11:39.148]  It's the Clintons, even the New York Times admits, that gave the reactors in North Korea and the missiles.
[01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:40.348]  They're the plague.
[01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.429]  They're the traitors.
[01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:45.390]  They're the... She helped write the TPP that Trump just pulled out of.
[01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:48.931]  We're going to play that clip of Trump saying, give me the emails.
[01:11:50.632 --> 01:12:02.504]  Do you agree with me, Roger Stone, that he needs to go on the offense and that this is a nothing burger again unless we let the Republican establishment and Pence and all them run a Jedi mind trick on us that this is something.
[01:12:02.564 --> 01:12:05.767]  For me, this is them running on fumes.
[01:12:06.628 --> 01:12:19.358]  Alex, as you know, I was in Washington yesterday, and I've got to tell you, in the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I have never seen more fake hysteria, more stern and drang about nothing.
[01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:20.699]  Let's be very clear.
[01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:21.820]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:26.004]  has done nothing improper, nothing illegal, and nothing wrong.
[01:12:26.624 --> 01:12:27.465]  Why is he targeted?
[01:12:27.925 --> 01:12:32.648]  Because he's the strongest and one of the most effective spokesmen for his father's campaign.
[01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:40.474]  Because he constantly retweets things from Infowars.com and other alternative credible news sources.
[01:12:40.874 --> 01:12:42.495]  Because he's a warrior, that's why.
[01:12:43.296 --> 01:12:52.983]  And frankly, if in the middle of a presidential campaign, and I've been in ten of them, someone contacts you and says, I have negative information on your opponent,
[01:12:53.783 --> 01:12:57.304]  And you do not seek to get that information.
[01:12:57.785 --> 01:12:59.205]  You're guilty of malpractice.
[01:12:59.865 --> 01:13:02.787]  This is a struggle for the presidency of the United States.
[01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:04.767]  Well, you're aiding and abetting if it's a crime.
[01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.008]  But there's no crime here.
[01:13:06.068 --> 01:13:06.868]  Where is the crime?
[01:13:06.908 --> 01:13:07.609]  There is no crime.
[01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:09.229]  What I'm saying is, Hillary's committed the crimes.
[01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:14.171]  If he's going to get evidence of her with the Russians, he's got a responsibility to at least tell the FBI.
[01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:18.453]  But if you, inside the Beltway, in today's Washington Post,
[01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:20.234]  It's Kafka-esque.
[01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:21.656]  It's like they're in another planet.
[01:13:21.796 --> 01:13:23.117]  Well, they know that.
[01:13:23.137 --> 01:13:26.801]  They're trying to flip us into their false phantom zone.
[01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:39.675]  What's interesting is that a long discussion in today's Washington Post about whether this somehow constitutes a campaign finance reform violation, whether Donald Trump Jr.
[01:13:39.735 --> 01:13:41.436]  received something of value
[01:13:42.297 --> 01:13:43.718]  And therefore it should have been reported.
[01:13:44.159 --> 01:13:50.323]  This is the most back-assed, incredibly false, thin argument I've ever seen.
[01:13:50.623 --> 01:13:52.705]  There is no violation of law here.
[01:13:53.165 --> 01:13:53.786]  Here's the point.
[01:13:54.747 --> 01:13:55.868]  This is all they have.
[01:13:56.528 --> 01:14:00.371]  The whole Russian narrative now boils down to this.
[01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.432]  Next thing, what are they going to say?
[01:14:02.512 --> 01:14:07.295]  That the Trump family dog came in contact with a Russian wolfhound while in the kennel?
[01:14:07.896 --> 01:14:11.178]  I mean, this has gotten to the point of absurdity.
[01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:15.621]  Now, I would say that the White House knew about this a week ago.
[01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:19.504]  Frankly, they should have released it themselves just before the weekend.
[01:14:20.084 --> 01:14:24.027]  They have made, in my opinion, what could have been a two-day story a five-day story.
[01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:41.292]  But the bottom line of which, there's no violation of law here, and there is most certainly no collusion with the Russians to affect the election, because there was no document, there was no evidence, at least not from this woman, of evidence of wrongdoing.
[01:14:41.872 --> 01:14:52.358]  If you look at the circumstances under which the woman lawyer got into the country, I think there's a strong indication, as you say... That's right, her visa was up for six months, so clearly Obama and them let her back in.
[01:14:52.478 --> 01:14:54.580]  Somebody pulled strings to get her back in the country.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:08.368]  That would, I think, play into the idea that you just put forward, that this was a setup, a way to try to compromise Donald Trump Jr., who, again, I assert, has done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[01:15:09.248 --> 01:15:14.773]  This is what all of the House and Senate investigations have come to?
[01:15:14.893 --> 01:15:17.696]  This is what Adam Schiff and Mark Warner have?
[01:15:17.716 --> 01:15:19.457]  Well, I would say they don't have much.
[01:15:19.898 --> 01:15:21.239]  There's no violation of law here.
[01:15:21.699 --> 01:15:23.801]  I don't even think there's anything politically wrong.
[01:15:24.442 --> 01:15:27.645]  Well, I know one thing for absolute 100% certain.
[01:15:30.185 --> 01:15:44.842]  They came out with the Federal Elections Commission Commissioner lady yesterday and said they took rumors from a congressional hearing four months ago from the House Armed Services Committee that were then rumors in the clatching
[01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:56.255]  And then put it out that I'm under counter-espionage investigation by the FBI along with Matt Grudge and Breitbart, and that we need to be hauled before Congress to explain how we got Russian money.
[01:15:56.855 --> 01:15:59.516]  I mean, this is literally like something out of a comic book.
[01:15:59.776 --> 01:16:01.597]  I've gotten zero money from the Russians.
[01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:03.858]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:04.778]  They know that.
[01:16:05.119 --> 01:16:07.760]  They know we're mainly funded by listeners buying products from us.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.000]  This is desperate.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:09.861]  When they start saying
[01:16:10.621 --> 01:16:15.744]  That I'm the reason they lost the election, and the Russians fund me, and told me what to say.
[01:16:16.264 --> 01:16:18.506]  I mean, this is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:27.251]  Then, in the middle of an election, all about how the Clintons are involved with the Russians, they turn the narrative around, back onto Trump.
[01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:28.832]  It's just crazy.
[01:16:28.912 --> 01:16:30.673]  I mean, I want to be called before Congress.
[01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:31.873]  Of course, they won't do it.
[01:16:31.893 --> 01:16:33.354]  They're all a bunch of scum.
[01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:37.817]  They know full well there's nothing going on here with the stupid Russians.
[01:16:38.544 --> 01:16:40.585]  You know Alex, you should wish that they would call you.
[01:16:40.645 --> 01:16:45.867]  You would decimate them because they talk with a complete absence of any facts whatsoever.
[01:16:46.327 --> 01:16:48.528]  The idea... Oh, I saw stuff all over Twitter in the news.
[01:16:49.048 --> 01:16:54.370]  Ah, Roger Stone and Alex Jones are going to be arrested now because Donald Trump Jr.
[01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:58.411]  met with a Russian to find out if Hillary was a Russian spy.
[01:16:58.431 --> 01:17:01.072]  And I said he did his job to see if she's a spy.
[01:17:01.432 --> 01:17:06.034]  So the Washington Post said that I said Trump went to check to see if this woman was a spy.
[01:17:06.374 --> 01:17:07.435]  No, I said Hillary!
[01:17:07.615 --> 01:17:10.317]  Again, the level of lying, it's pure desperation.
[01:17:10.558 --> 01:17:12.639]  It's the double standard that's more disturbing.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.425]  In other words, we know for a fact that the Ukrainian government worked with Hillary in an attempt to undermine Donald Trump.
[01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:20.847]  But that's not page one in the Washington Post.
[01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:24.370]  Donnie released these emails.
[01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:25.731]  What about Hillary's emails?
[01:17:26.111 --> 01:17:32.477]  Maybe if Donnie had used bleach and a sledgehammer on his server, we wouldn't have this problem.
[01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:33.738]  This isn't absurd.
[01:17:33.778 --> 01:17:36.799]  And they said that you were being sarcastic in the Washington Post.
[01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:37.439]  I don't think you were.
[01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:39.060]  It's time to indict Comey.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.061]  He had classified info and lied to Congress.
[01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:42.382]  It's time to indict Obama.
[01:17:42.562 --> 01:17:43.622]  It's time to indict Hillary.
[01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:44.082]  Indict!
[01:17:44.142 --> 01:17:44.463]  Indict!
[01:17:44.543 --> 01:17:44.843]  Indict!
[01:17:45.063 --> 01:17:47.464]  Go on the offense with this scum because here's the deal.
[01:17:47.884 --> 01:17:50.125]  We all know the big enchilada and I want you to comment on both these.
[01:17:50.605 --> 01:17:51.566]  He has the trifecta.
[01:17:51.826 --> 01:17:53.808]  He has the legislative, the executive, the judicial.
[01:17:54.048 --> 01:17:55.909]  He has 30-plus of the states.
[01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.611]  He has almost all the legislatures.
[01:17:57.891 --> 01:17:59.613]  America is explosively awake.
[01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:00.613]  That's why D.C.
[01:18:00.673 --> 01:18:06.738]  is panicking with all this faux consternation and, see, we've got you, vitriol, because they're out of gas.
[01:18:06.919 --> 01:18:09.901]  Every time they say this is the total proof, it's all over.
[01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:14.325]  You know, I've got Bloomberg saying, you know, Trump supporters have egg on their face.
[01:18:14.345 --> 01:18:14.925]  Here's the headline.
[01:18:15.186 --> 01:18:17.948]  Trump's defeated defenders can only whimper.
[01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:24.811]  That's like Tokyo Rose as we're dropping A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki telling the Allies they just lost the war.
[01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:33.254]  It is a load of delusional BS and only if they can hoax the American people into believing this can they defeat Trump.
[01:18:33.314 --> 01:18:39.336]  The problem is the Republican leadership, we'll put Pence on behind us, is trying to maneuver that into reality.
[01:18:39.536 --> 01:18:40.997]  How big is the danger, Roger Stone?
[01:18:41.277 --> 01:18:44.078]  I think the danger is not insubstantial.
[01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:50.121]  If you're familiar with Stone's rules, you probably know my most important rule, which is you never win on defense.
[01:18:50.782 --> 01:19:03.529]  We know for an absolute fact that the super-secret FISA court condemned the Obama administration days before Trump became president for the wholesale, unconstitutional, illegal surveillance
[01:19:04.549 --> 01:19:07.831]  Of perhaps tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[01:19:08.372 --> 01:19:14.695]  This is a serious crime as opposed to, say, meeting with a Russian woman lawyer who provides nothing.
[01:19:15.396 --> 01:19:19.518]  So it's time for Mr. Clapper, Mr. Brennan, Ms.
[01:19:19.599 --> 01:19:23.001]  Rice, Valerie Jarrett, and yes, the President himself,
[01:19:23.581 --> 01:19:26.123]  To go in front of a grand jury and say what they knew about this.
[01:19:26.723 --> 01:19:27.824]  That's how you win this.
[01:19:28.184 --> 01:19:37.009]  Donald Trump needs to direct the Attorney General to begin a wholesale investigation into illegal surveillance of American citizens.
[01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:39.611]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[01:19:39.631 --> 01:19:40.171]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:41.552]  The FISA court said this.
[01:19:41.752 --> 01:19:45.755]  No one even asked, where do the New York Times get all these emails of Donnie Jr.? ?
[01:19:46.877 --> 01:19:48.378]  Yeah, it's extraordinary, isn't it?
[01:19:48.478 --> 01:19:50.099]  Who could possibly have leaked those?
[01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:51.419]  Gee, I wonder.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:20:02.925]  I mean, the leaking going on from the Obama holdovers that are still serving in this government, and the fact that the administration hasn't moved quickly enough to fill the seats, is compounding the problem.
[01:20:02.945 --> 01:20:03.606]  It's crazy, it's crazy.
[01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:26.831]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[01:20:28.152 --> 01:20:43.682]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[01:20:44.622 --> 01:20:58.213]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[01:20:59.294 --> 01:21:06.240]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:10.011]  That our species has never even imagined.
[01:21:10.851 --> 01:21:18.534]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[01:21:19.994 --> 01:21:28.237]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[01:21:29.037 --> 01:21:33.319]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[01:21:34.419 --> 01:21:36.380]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[01:21:37.438 --> 01:21:51.581]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, the people of the world.
[01:21:52.101 --> 01:22:02.043]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.844]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[01:22:07.662 --> 01:22:09.823]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[01:22:10.823 --> 01:22:15.065]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:16.346]  It's why they hate me.
[01:22:16.606 --> 01:22:17.486]  It's why they hate you.
[01:22:17.786 --> 01:22:20.548]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:26.650]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[01:22:27.191 --> 01:22:32.393]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead.
[01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:37.511]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[01:22:37.531 --> 01:22:40.893]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[01:22:41.313 --> 01:22:47.377]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[01:22:47.897 --> 01:22:54.982]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:57.649]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:03.915]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbridge Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[01:23:04.575 --> 01:23:10.240]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:16.485]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[01:23:16.785 --> 01:23:20.208]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:20.268 --> 01:23:22.169]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:38.268]  Long lasting sale in the history of Infowars because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[01:23:38.648 --> 01:23:44.872]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[01:23:45.373 --> 01:23:52.037]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[01:23:52.578 --> 01:23:54.379]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:10.596]  You look like an angel.
[01:24:11.256 --> 01:24:14.581]  Walk like an angel.
[01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:17.464]  Talk like an angel.
[01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:19.607]  But I got my way.
[01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:30.048]  Coming up in the next longer segment with Roger Stone here in studio, I'm gonna open the phones up for your specific questions for Roger Stone at 800-259-9231.
[01:24:30.068 --> 01:24:34.632]  800-259-9231 specifically on what's happening with Donnie Jr., what's happening with the globalists.
[01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:36.634]  Trump is defeating ISIS right now.
[01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:37.195]  That is a big plus.
[01:24:44.096 --> 01:24:55.766]  Bill Gertz reports, China's intelligence networks in the United States include 25,000 spies, Chinese billionaire warns they're ready to destroy the U.S., and that they've totally penetrated the Democratic Party.
[01:24:56.066 --> 01:25:01.991]  We have this WikiLeak coming up in the next segment, where you have the Chinese ambassador meeting secretly with the Clinton.
[01:25:03.092 --> 01:25:03.593]  We're good.
[01:25:19.608 --> 01:25:20.668]  Go on offense.
[01:25:21.328 --> 01:25:23.529]  You see, I think the left's plan is very simple.
[01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:33.192]  They are hoping to win control of the House in the 2018 election and therefore impeach our president based on trumped up charges put forward by Mr. Mueller.
[01:25:34.152 --> 01:25:38.793]  In Washington yesterday, I heard that Mueller may take as long as two years to wrap up his probe.
[01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.773]  You can see what they're buying time for.
[01:25:40.813 --> 01:25:42.234]  They're buying time for the election.
[01:25:42.654 --> 01:25:46.335]  Therefore, if they want to impeach our president, it's time to jail their president.
[01:25:46.815 --> 01:25:56.139]  What did Barack Obama know and when did he know it when it came to the illegal surveillance cited by the FISA court only days before Donald Trump became president?
[01:25:56.579 --> 01:25:57.579]  What did Clapper know?
[01:25:57.699 --> 01:25:58.640]  What did Brennan know?
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.660]  What did Rice know?
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:07.303]  Somebody authorized this operation to spy on the American people and violate their civil rights.
[01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:09.804]  And it's now admitted that they targeted all the political opposition.
[01:26:09.824 --> 01:26:11.065]  Yeah, I think it's an absurdity to think
[01:26:36.642 --> 01:26:55.457]  That we are going to not do anything about the fact that the Deputy Director of the FBI paid $50,000 in our taxpayer money for a phony dossier doctored up to accuse Donald Trump of sexual impropriety in Moscow that has now been proven to be a total fabrication.
[01:26:55.697 --> 01:26:56.778]  Those are your tax dollars.
[01:26:56.818 --> 01:26:59.141]  And this lawyer, this woman, is tied to it.
[01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:00.182]  What does she sound like to you?
[01:27:00.522 --> 01:27:09.472]  Getting in when she doesn't have a visa six months after, hanging out at Soros events, protests against Trump, working with the group that put out the PPGate dossier.
[01:27:09.872 --> 01:27:12.135]  Yeah, there's no question she's an agent.
[01:27:12.415 --> 01:27:15.539]  And this is smelling more and more like a setup.
[01:27:16.159 --> 01:27:23.483]  Notice that they go on the record in emails claiming to have all kinds of negative information on Hillary, then she produces nothing of the kind.
[01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:25.144]  That's how you know it's a setup.
[01:27:25.464 --> 01:27:27.265]  The purpose was to get the meeting.
[01:27:27.845 --> 01:27:38.091]  I am surprised about one thing, and that is comments today in the Washington Post by veteran Republican opposition researcher Gary Maloney, who's a good man.
[01:27:38.471 --> 01:27:41.593]  And he correctly says, it should have been handled by a cutout.
[01:27:42.253 --> 01:27:45.254]  Why would you put the candidate's family in the line of fire?
[01:27:45.655 --> 01:27:49.316]  Why not send a low-level operative to determine whether there was anything hidden?
[01:27:49.336 --> 01:27:51.017]  Well, it shows Trump leads from the front.
[01:27:51.778 --> 01:28:01.142]  Well, it shows that this was a grassroots campaign, and that they don't have the vast experience of presidential politics that the Clintons have.
[01:28:01.162 --> 01:28:01.943]  Which is what we want.
[01:28:02.023 --> 01:28:03.663]  All they're trying to do is deliver on their promises.
[01:28:03.703 --> 01:28:04.384]  Well, they're honest.
[01:28:04.664 --> 01:28:07.865]  The point is they're honest, and Donnie handled this in an honest way.
[01:28:08.246 --> 01:28:10.567]  And he's been honest about it since the story broke.
[01:28:11.227 --> 01:28:13.008]  They're trying to crucify this guy.
[01:28:13.028 --> 01:28:13.088]  Why?
[01:28:13.428 --> 01:28:14.489]  Because he's one of us.
[01:28:14.969 --> 01:28:15.950]  Because he's effective.
[01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:16.970]  Because he's tough.
[01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:18.931]  Because he's not afraid to fight the left.
[01:28:19.191 --> 01:28:23.774]  If you go back and look through his Twitter feed, look how often he reposts InfoWars.com.
[01:28:24.234 --> 01:28:24.994]  It's extraordinary.
[01:28:25.635 --> 01:28:27.195]  They absolutely hate his guts.
[01:28:27.696 --> 01:28:32.598]  They absolutely are totally... If you need some help with your phone... No, I got it.
[01:28:32.658 --> 01:28:33.038]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:33.919]  We'll work on it during the break.
[01:28:33.979 --> 01:28:34.979]  It's a systemic issue.
[01:28:34.999 --> 01:28:36.420]  We're going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:36.900]  I got it.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.601]  We're going to investigate it.
[01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:39.402]  This is important.
[01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:43.646]  We're live teleprompter free folks.
[01:28:45.547 --> 01:28:51.209]  When we come back I want to get into the real threats where you see this going but I don't just say this to try to be positive everybody knows that.
[01:28:51.670 --> 01:29:01.173]  I think Trump's totally turned the corner the last few months and they are completely panicking and going crazy and and their constituents are acting like mental patients running around attacking people.
[01:29:01.893 --> 01:29:02.154]  On the 14th
[01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:18.292]  Michael Caputo, who is a long-time associate of mine, you might call him a protege, started on Congressman Jack Kemp's staff as a lowly driver, rose to be Kemp's press secretary, an extraordinarily able young guy, is going to be hauled in front of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:29:18.332 --> 01:29:18.652]  Why?
[01:29:19.173 --> 01:29:21.294]  Because he once lived in Russia.
[01:29:21.934 --> 01:29:35.480]  There's no evidence of contact between him and the Russian state, but it is true that he was sent to Russia by the Clinton administration, being funded by the CIA, in an effort to help the election of Boris Yeltsin.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:42.783]  You told me about this back when it was still secret, but just to be clear, he is CIA, he was hired to CIA to go in to the energy company,
[01:29:43.163 --> 01:29:45.264]  And now they're even burning their own person.
[01:29:45.504 --> 01:29:49.326]  They're so desperate to look for some type of Russia connection.
[01:29:49.606 --> 01:29:51.327]  We'll be right back and break all this down.
[01:29:51.347 --> 01:29:51.807]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.067 --> 01:29:52.768]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:10.080]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.362]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:30:13.682 --> 01:30:18.884]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:30:19.305 --> 01:30:25.267]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:30:25.407 --> 01:30:28.529]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.150]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:34.512]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:30:34.692 --> 01:30:37.553]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:39.194]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:30:39.294 --> 01:30:42.495]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:30:42.755 --> 01:30:45.076]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:46.337]  It's in powder form.
[01:30:46.417 --> 01:30:49.118]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:30:49.298 --> 01:30:49.898]  I take this.
[01:30:50.018 --> 01:30:51.719]  This is the product that I take.
[01:30:51.819 --> 01:30:53.800]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.401]  We fight the Globals.
[01:30:55.421 --> 01:30:56.262]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:31:04.184 --> 01:31:10.047]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:31:10.247 --> 01:31:11.748]  The contest is simple.
[01:31:11.768 --> 01:31:17.010]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:24.394]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:31:24.534 --> 01:31:31.115]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:31.215 --> 01:31:41.097]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:31:41.277 --> 01:31:48.839]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:31:49.039 --> 01:31:58.986]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:31:59.106 --> 01:32:02.448]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[01:32:02.468 --> 01:32:03.449]  This is Kit Daniels.
[01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:06.751]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:32:08.412 --> 01:32:14.116]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:18.699]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.861]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:23.141]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:32:23.781 --> 01:32:26.342]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:32:27.303 --> 01:32:27.663]  Or more.
[01:32:27.743 --> 01:32:29.623]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:32:30.164 --> 01:32:31.644]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:32:31.764 --> 01:32:35.105]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:32:35.205 --> 01:32:36.966]  It's actually scary.
[01:32:37.865 --> 01:32:47.927]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:32:48.927 --> 01:33:01.710]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[01:33:09.594 --> 01:33:11.776]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:12.116 --> 01:33:14.598]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:14.898 --> 01:33:17.300]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.183 --> 01:33:24.125]  It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia.
[01:33:24.505 --> 01:33:25.706]  It is so far-fetched.
[01:33:25.806 --> 01:33:26.727]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:33:26.827 --> 01:33:28.228]  Honestly, I wish I had that power.
[01:33:29.429 --> 01:33:30.590]  I'd love to have that power.
[01:33:31.591 --> 01:33:34.293]  But Russia has no respect for our country.
[01:33:35.074 --> 01:33:38.116]  And that's why, if it is Russia, nobody even knows it's probably China.
[01:33:39.855 --> 01:33:41.416]  Or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.
[01:33:42.936 --> 01:33:45.037]  But it shows how weak we are.
[01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:50.020]  It shows how disrespected we are.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.361]  Assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major
[01:33:53.716 --> 01:34:00.119]  It's a total sign of disrespect for our country.
[01:34:00.879 --> 01:34:07.401]  Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore, and they certainly have no respect for our leader.
[01:34:07.962 --> 01:34:09.182]  So I know nothing about it.
[01:34:09.202 --> 01:34:11.143]  It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.
[01:34:11.163 --> 01:34:11.323]  Yes.
[01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:13.313]  What do I have to get involved with Putin for?
[01:34:13.333 --> 01:34:14.354]  I have nothing to do with Putin.
[01:34:14.374 --> 01:34:15.415]  I've never spoken to him.
[01:34:15.455 --> 01:34:17.958]  I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
[01:34:18.418 --> 01:34:26.207]  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.
[01:34:27.168 --> 01:34:30.892]  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
[01:34:32.011 --> 01:34:42.400]  Now that's July 27th of last year, about a month after Donnie met with a woman who we now know hangs out with the Soros groups and is part of the PPGate Democratic Party, a fake dossier, a steal group.
[01:34:43.441 --> 01:34:48.666]  We now know that she got back in the country even though her visa was up six months.
[01:34:49.126 --> 01:34:50.347]  I mean, she's being protected.
[01:34:50.788 --> 01:34:53.891]  She looks like a classic foundation mole, playing both sides.
[01:34:55.792 --> 01:34:57.052]  I mean, this is what Don Jr.
[01:34:57.072 --> 01:34:57.653]  should have done.
[01:34:57.673 --> 01:34:59.913]  He said, yeah, where's my award?
[01:35:00.033 --> 01:35:01.334]  It's Hillary working with the Russians.
[01:35:01.394 --> 01:35:03.774]  It's not me trying to sell the country out to the Russians.
[01:35:03.834 --> 01:35:06.395]  And let's put the WikiLeaks back on screen here.
[01:35:06.835 --> 01:35:08.396]  This is from the WikiLeaks, confirmed.
[01:35:08.416 --> 01:35:09.616]  They're not denying these are real.
[01:35:10.316 --> 01:35:11.737]  Chris Cuomo says you're not allowed to read it.
[01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:13.117]  But here it is.
[01:35:13.657 --> 01:35:15.918]  And we have China Intelligence Network's
[01:35:16.914 --> 01:35:17.855]  In the United States, 25,000.
[01:35:17.975 --> 01:35:19.537]  It's a lot more than that.
[01:35:19.878 --> 01:35:25.284]  Chinese ambassador, private off the record, set up for a meeting with the Clinton campaign during a run-up to the U.S.
[01:35:25.304 --> 01:35:25.684]  election.
[01:35:25.704 --> 01:35:27.386]  Let's just indict her ass, because here's the deal.
[01:35:28.187 --> 01:35:30.690]  It isn't like the two old parties kissing cousins.
[01:35:32.037 --> 01:35:32.858]  Selling out America.
[01:35:33.178 --> 01:35:39.962]  Trump's done the cardinal sin of really trying to make the country great, trying to turn the economy back on, trying to be the corporate guy that, you know, does the American turnaround.
[01:35:40.122 --> 01:35:41.703]  It's a smart move for him and his family and the world.
[01:35:41.983 --> 01:35:45.185]  You know, it's a good move as a decent person, not as a monopoly man.
[01:35:45.705 --> 01:35:50.408]  So doesn't he just turn that around with the shycoms, the Clintons giving the reactors in North Korea?
[01:35:50.648 --> 01:35:54.751]  I mean, he's got so many smoking gun, open and shut cases.
[01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:56.153]  They want a political war.
[01:35:56.173 --> 01:35:58.197]  They're all calling for his death, calling for our death.
[01:35:58.557 --> 01:35:59.779]  All this, it's time to go after them.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.421]  They're weak.
[01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:05.409]  The only way we're in trouble is letting them sit there, plotting his murder, plotting his death.
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:06.071]  Let me explain something.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.824]  Megyn Kelly had 10 million viewers the first week she hosted her show.
[01:36:10.204 --> 01:36:11.566]  Three weeks in, she hosted it with me, 3.3.
[01:36:11.927 --> 01:36:16.452]  It's now at 2 million viewers, lower than anything on broadcast TV.
[01:36:16.693 --> 01:36:17.073]  Okay?
[01:36:17.454 --> 01:36:18.155]  She's gone.
[01:36:18.635 --> 01:36:19.296]  It's the same thing.
[01:36:19.336 --> 01:36:21.639]  CNN had a dead cat bounce for a few months.
[01:36:21.919 --> 01:36:23.061]  They're at almost zero.
[01:36:23.321 --> 01:36:24.042]  They're done.
[01:36:24.283 --> 01:36:25.004]  They're a fraud.
[01:36:25.444 --> 01:36:28.747]  Everybody knows a cornered rat is dangerous.
[01:36:29.087 --> 01:36:33.792]  And I'm telling you, we need to politically dispatch this un-American cancer now.
[01:36:34.132 --> 01:36:35.573]  I'm the opposite of an authoritarian.
[01:36:35.834 --> 01:36:37.415]  They say hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:36:37.715 --> 01:36:39.197]  They say kill Trump, kill his family.
[01:36:39.417 --> 01:36:40.418]  They say come after me.
[01:36:40.698 --> 01:36:41.839]  They say kill the police.
[01:36:42.079 --> 01:36:43.380]  They say bring in martial law.
[01:36:43.541 --> 01:36:44.522]  They say put the U.N.
[01:36:44.582 --> 01:36:45.663]  over our police review boards.
[01:36:46.043 --> 01:36:46.884]  I got an idea!
[01:36:47.344 --> 01:36:48.305]  You're not American.
[01:36:48.586 --> 01:36:49.347]  You're scum.
[01:36:49.527 --> 01:36:51.029]  You want to overthrow our free society.
[01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:52.751]  You say you want to overthrow the West.
[01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:55.614]  How about you get your ass locked up in prison?
[01:36:55.754 --> 01:36:56.415]  And I'm serious.
[01:36:56.495 --> 01:36:57.136]  We can do it.
[01:36:57.416 --> 01:36:58.458]  We got Trump elected.
[01:36:58.658 --> 01:37:00.761]  We have to remove the cancer now.
[01:37:01.371 --> 01:37:02.191]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:37:02.231 --> 01:37:05.992]  Look, the president needs to realize the awesome investigative powers that he has.
[01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:07.993]  The power to indict.
[01:37:08.893 --> 01:37:13.615]  This is what the left did to Richard Nixon in the 70s, and now the shoe is on the other foot.
[01:37:14.075 --> 01:37:18.016]  You have substantial evidence of egregious crime.
[01:37:18.456 --> 01:37:22.798]  Again, the wholesale surveillance of American citizens.
[01:37:23.738 --> 01:37:28.561]  Is not some conspiracy theory cooked up by Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:35.485]  This is per the FISA court in a stinging decision days before Trump became president.
[01:37:35.505 --> 01:37:39.207]  You see, they figured once Hillary was elected, they'd be able to cover this all up.
[01:37:39.968 --> 01:37:43.270]  Once Hillary was elected, all their crimes would be beyond reach.
[01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:45.931]  But things didn't go the way they wanted, to say the least.
[01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:50.034]  And now it's time for the president to turn the tables on his tormentors.
[01:37:51.215 --> 01:38:00.922]  John Brennan and Ray Clapper have been the principal architects of this entire phony Russian fairy tale.
[01:38:02.062 --> 01:38:09.167]  It's time for them to start answering questions under oath about the widespread surveillance and wiretapping of average Americans.
[01:38:09.948 --> 01:38:10.928]  Why were they doing this?
[01:38:11.308 --> 01:38:12.009]  Who approved it?
[01:38:12.289 --> 01:38:13.090]  When did it start?
[01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:14.190]  Is it ongoing?
[01:38:14.811 --> 01:38:16.472]  There are criminal indictments there.
[01:38:16.492 --> 01:38:20.555]  It's time for the president to turn the table on his critics.
[01:38:21.355 --> 01:38:29.823]  At the same time, Alex, I'm concerned that the Trump State Department continues to be infiltrated with Soros operatives.
[01:38:30.264 --> 01:38:36.830]  This woman, Fiona Hill, was the subject of discussion last night's dinner when a number of conservative leaders got together.
[01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:44.117]  She is single-handedly blocking efforts to take on the Soros apparatus through Eastern Europe.
[01:38:44.986 --> 01:38:46.607]  Why is she in this administration?
[01:38:47.128 --> 01:38:50.991]  Why in the world would Rex Tillerson appoint her to anything?
[01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:58.917]  I mean, her credentials, Council on Foreign Relations, Harvard, Soros, Open Society Institute.
[01:38:59.317 --> 01:39:01.519]  Does that sound like a Trump appointee to you?
[01:39:01.899 --> 01:39:03.100]  Doesn't sound like one to me.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.100]  And I want to be clear.
[01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:06.722]  We talk about an open, free society for open, free people.
[01:39:07.183 --> 01:39:12.327]  When he talks about open society, he means no borders, global government, total Islamic invasion, and
[01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:20.176]  You know, expanding on this, Trump has not gone after the vaccine investigation the way he said he would.
[01:39:20.336 --> 01:39:21.217]  That's kind of stalled.
[01:39:21.737 --> 01:39:28.963]  Also, he's not started investigations and hearings on the IRS, and he needs to, you know, go after people that are still there, that are holdovers.
[01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:40.533]  I mean, they're still, I see articles all the time, raiding mom-and-pop shops that have no criminal record, with no investigation, no judge, no jury, not even their own procedures, as a rogue agency.
[01:39:41.333 --> 01:39:42.474]  So, you know, here's the deal.
[01:39:42.494 --> 01:39:48.616]  I understand we have to have taxes in this country, but we need to repeal the Income Tax Act of 1913 and go back to constitutional tax.
[01:39:48.876 --> 01:39:52.517]  So I think those are areas in a bully pulpit where he could do a better job.
[01:39:52.777 --> 01:39:55.718]  Well, the other one is obvious, and that is the Clinton Foundation.
[01:39:55.738 --> 01:39:58.359]  The Clinton Foundation is not a charity, never was.
[01:39:58.399 --> 01:39:59.900]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:04.702]  And as you know, Alex, it was the vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:40:05.402 --> 01:40:07.784]  So, no person is above the law.
[01:40:07.844 --> 01:40:10.006]  The left tells us that endlessly.
[01:40:10.707 --> 01:40:14.050]  What then of Bill and Hillary Clinton and that criminal enterprise?
[01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:16.052]  Well, that's my question, because we kind of glossed over this.
[01:40:16.072 --> 01:40:16.913]  You brought it up a bunch.
[01:40:17.173 --> 01:40:18.835]  But let's drill into this and then take some phone calls.
[01:40:21.397 --> 01:40:43.937]  She'd meet with the communist Chinese ambassadors, sell out everybody, have the secret server, delete all the emails, Wiener's getting caught with pedophile stuff, Clinton's on Lolita Expresses, they rob all the money out of Haiti, she destabilizes the Middle East for Al Qaeda and ISIS, brags about that, all these illegal crimes, spying on everybody, a trail of dead bodies, and then
[01:40:45.069 --> 01:40:48.793]  She's still going to lead the Democrats in 2018 with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:40:48.833 --> 01:40:51.856]  It shows the total mental illness disconnect.
[01:40:52.176 --> 01:40:54.418]  And I think it shows the mental illness disconnect with Russia.
[01:40:54.758 --> 01:40:59.543]  Everybody I talk to, except a few delusional liberals, are so sick of Russia, they know it's absolute crap.
[01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:05.969]  You see all the videos inside CNN where everybody from Van Jones to the producers say it's totally made up crap.
[01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:07.371]  Trump's right, it's a witch hunt.
[01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:08.632]  I don't know.
[01:41:24.833 --> 01:41:25.894]  We're going Americana.
[01:41:25.914 --> 01:41:27.035]  We're not going right-wing, folks.
[01:41:27.055 --> 01:41:31.898]  We're going populist, Americana, free market, JFK policies on the economy.
[01:41:31.938 --> 01:41:32.638]  That's what Trump's doing.
[01:41:32.818 --> 01:41:34.319]  It's carbon copy JFK, okay?
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.201]  And if Trump gets his tax cuts through, we're gonna explode.
[01:41:37.582 --> 01:41:40.904]  The economy's already puttering back, but it's gonna come back hard.
[01:41:41.164 --> 01:41:44.626]  That's why their whole globalist system is going down.
[01:41:44.887 --> 01:41:46.708]  So they're gonna put everything they can
[01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:47.328]  Yes.
[01:42:03.936 --> 01:42:05.717]  Think about how Trump's championing that.
[01:42:05.977 --> 01:42:08.037]  He is a godsend, people.
[01:42:08.317 --> 01:42:13.839]  You can find stuff he's doing that isn't perfect, which we bring up, but I'm surprised he can get anything done, Stone.
[01:42:14.139 --> 01:42:16.559]  Imagine where we'd be if Hillary was here, because you said it earlier.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.361]  They plan to have her in to shut down the free press, to prosecute people.
[01:42:21.681 --> 01:42:23.281]  Pelosi met with the Attorney General.
[01:42:23.641 --> 01:42:25.402]  She wanted me arrested, as an example.
[01:42:25.662 --> 01:42:29.623]  They've got the FBI criminally investigating me, and people say, how am I handling it?
[01:42:31.284 --> 01:42:37.347]  Wonderfully, the criminal globalists want to put me in jail because I'm effective against them.
[01:42:37.628 --> 01:42:43.070]  I am a total American, totally committed to this country, and the globalist scum know it!
[01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:44.751]  And they know we're never going to stop!
[01:42:44.951 --> 01:42:46.752]  And they know we're kicking their ass!
[01:42:46.933 --> 01:42:48.053]  And they know you're awake!
[01:42:48.273 --> 01:42:49.594]  And they know we're rising!
[01:42:49.934 --> 01:42:51.275]  We must crush their spirit!
[01:42:51.395 --> 01:42:52.716]  We must demoralize them!
[01:42:52.936 --> 01:42:54.116]  They're the goddamn enemy!
[01:42:54.156 --> 01:42:54.657]  Excuse me.
[01:42:55.077 --> 01:42:55.537]  Delay that.
[01:42:55.977 --> 01:42:58.799]  I'm just so sick of these... These people hate us, Roger.
[01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:00.960]  Well, we need to take the fight to them, Alex.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:07.725]  Look, 5 o'clock in the morning there needs to be a knock on the door at the homes of Mr. Brennan, Mr. Clapper, Ms.
[01:43:07.785 --> 01:43:08.566]  Rice, Ms.
[01:43:08.586 --> 01:43:14.890]  Jarrett, and yes, I'm sorry to say this, President Barack Obama himself, because no person is above the law.
[01:43:15.331 --> 01:43:21.655]  And what they have done with this wholesale spying on Americans makes Watergate look like nothing!
[01:43:22.816 --> 01:43:25.058]  I mean, where is the outrage from the left?
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:31.113]  I'd be looking to a patriot like Trey Gowdy, who I think is one of the standouts on the committees.
[01:43:31.935 --> 01:43:33.459]  Why didn't he take the FBI job?
[01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:35.789]  I can't answer that question.
[01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:39.191]  He would have been an excellent choice, a much better choice than I think the fellow we got.
[01:43:40.152 --> 01:43:42.514]  I think it's important to refocus this.
[01:43:43.334 --> 01:43:45.856]  How many foreign nationals did John Podesta meet with?
[01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:47.257]  How many Chinese?
[01:43:47.337 --> 01:43:48.138]  How many Russians?
[01:43:48.618 --> 01:43:52.761]  How many other... Trump should have press conferences where he reads them off!
[01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:56.945]  I mean, it is... Okay, my son met to see why she's meeting with the Russians to say...
[01:43:58.474 --> 01:43:59.855]  Can we give an award to Donald Jr.?
[01:44:00.676 --> 01:44:01.397]  He deserves one.
[01:44:01.797 --> 01:44:03.458]  But I'm not just turning that around.
[01:44:03.798 --> 01:44:04.139]  Really!
[01:44:04.579 --> 01:44:06.160]  He's trying to expose spies!
[01:44:06.361 --> 01:44:09.783]  He's done nothing wrong, immoral or illegal here.
[01:44:09.863 --> 01:44:10.224]  Nothing.
[01:44:10.484 --> 01:44:13.186]  But you wouldn't know that... Except saying he would have done things differently.
[01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:14.327]  Which is true.
[01:44:14.367 --> 01:44:15.488]  He probably should have sent a minion.
[01:44:15.908 --> 01:44:17.509]  Yeah, they should have sent a cutout.
[01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:18.730]  That's what I would have done.
[01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:22.912]  It would have come to nothing because the meeting was a nothing burger.
[01:44:23.433 --> 01:44:35.620]  But all of these millions of dollars they have spent and all of the thunderings of the Adam Schiff's and this pain in the neck Eric Swalwell who's Pelosi's bitch.
[01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:45.009]  You know, the constant dissembling about Russian collusion without an iota of evidence, and then they turn up this?
[01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:46.251]  Where's the collusion?
[01:44:46.411 --> 01:44:47.352]  And let's expand on this.
[01:44:47.412 --> 01:44:48.533]  How did this affect the election?
[01:44:48.593 --> 01:44:49.574]  In what way was the election?
[01:44:49.594 --> 01:44:49.834]  It didn't.
[01:44:49.894 --> 01:44:50.355]  It was nothing.
[01:44:50.595 --> 01:44:50.976]  Exactly.
[01:44:50.996 --> 01:44:51.957]  So let's expand on this.
[01:44:52.517 --> 01:44:53.879]  And he meant no bad intent by it.
[01:44:53.959 --> 01:44:54.720]  It's totally normal.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.520]  I would do it myself.
[01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:57.261]  Let's expand on this then.
[01:44:57.741 --> 01:45:02.202]  Why are they so delusional to say Hillary will be the face of the Dems in 2018?
[01:45:02.282 --> 01:45:03.983]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:45:04.043 --> 01:45:04.703]  Well, we should hope.
[01:45:04.963 --> 01:45:06.163]  I mean, really, we should hope.
[01:45:06.203 --> 01:45:19.686]  First of all, I will put out the Clinton's War on Women in a new edition available at the Infowars.com store, if that should be the case, with several new chapters about Chelsea and how she's been grifting since the election.
[01:45:19.706 --> 01:45:22.167]  But Clintonism is like as popular as
[01:45:22.907 --> 01:45:23.588]  That's herpes!
[01:45:23.708 --> 01:45:25.289]  Leprosy, I would say.
[01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:27.511]  I want to go back and clarify something earlier.
[01:45:28.292 --> 01:45:31.495]  Michael Caputo testifying before the House Committee on the 14th.
[01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:34.758]  Technically he was working for, I think, the USIA.
[01:45:35.819 --> 01:45:37.741]  But he was really funded by the CIA.
[01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:38.782]  Our goal?
[01:45:39.222 --> 01:45:41.845]  To affect the Russian election and elect Boris Yeltsin.
[01:45:42.105 --> 01:45:45.689]  So in other words, the United States was interfering in their election.
[01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:47.951]  Why are we pretending this doesn't happen?
[01:45:48.391 --> 01:45:53.777]  But now they're burning him, knowing it was a CIA contract, trying to use that.
[01:45:53.957 --> 01:45:56.920]  That's their evidence it's some CIA cutout they sent in.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.122]  He has two sins.
[01:45:58.242 --> 01:46:03.347]  He once lived in Russia while working for the United States government, and he had a beautiful ex-wife.
[01:46:04.088 --> 01:46:05.149]  wife who was Russian.
[01:46:05.569 --> 01:46:07.070]  He had no contact with the Russians.
[01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:10.653]  This is one of the worst, most egregious smear I've ever seen.
[01:46:10.954 --> 01:46:13.155]  Michael Caputo is a patriotic American.
[01:46:13.516 --> 01:46:15.917]  He is a solid conservative Republican.
[01:46:15.977 --> 01:46:17.519]  He was an early Trump supporter.
[01:46:17.859 --> 01:46:21.502]  And they have not one iota of evidence of wrongdoing on his part.
[01:46:21.762 --> 01:46:23.964]  Why is he being dragged in front of a House committee?
[01:46:23.984 --> 01:46:25.445]  Because they have nothing.
[01:46:26.105 --> 01:46:30.369]  You know, Nancy Pelosi again yesterday said that George W. Bush was president.
[01:46:33.077 --> 01:46:34.218]  That's 13 times I count.
[01:46:34.238 --> 01:46:36.940]  Well, I think Maxine Waters must be writing her talking points.
[01:46:37.321 --> 01:46:41.964]  I mean, the Democratic leadership in the House is just pathetic.
[01:46:41.984 --> 01:46:43.445]  I mean, look at that loon ball.
[01:46:43.525 --> 01:46:45.487]  He can barely move her face, you notice that?
[01:46:45.907 --> 01:46:47.128]  Yeah, total Botox.
[01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:52.512]  We have like some narcissistic person who probably has a shriveled brain syndrome.
[01:46:53.715 --> 01:47:02.562]  Well, she has recruited this lightweight mannequin, Eric Swalwell, who I can't wait to see when I go before the House Committee on the 24th.
[01:47:02.622 --> 01:47:05.084]  I hope he has the cojones to show up.
[01:47:05.124 --> 01:47:12.851]  By the way, I know it's whoever lines up, but I will send a camera person or somebody to document it if you can get them in with you.
[01:47:13.451 --> 01:47:14.852]  Well, they have very strict rules.
[01:47:14.872 --> 01:47:19.355]  You know, they don't want a public hearing, as you know, because I will expose them in public.
[01:47:19.375 --> 01:47:21.016]  They don't mind trashing you in public.
[01:47:21.537 --> 01:47:25.299]  Congresswoman Speier says, and I quote, Stone has worked for the Kremlin.
[01:47:25.339 --> 01:47:25.940]  We know that.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.881]  No, Congresswoman, I haven't.
[01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:28.581]  That's a lie.
[01:47:28.861 --> 01:47:30.743]  Apologize or I'll see you in court.
[01:47:31.283 --> 01:47:33.485]  You have no idea how many of these I have, Alex.
[01:47:33.805 --> 01:47:35.446]  Flat, false statements.
[01:47:35.786 --> 01:47:37.967]  And by the way, I know you've talked to lawyers, and I've talked to mine, too.
[01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:42.308]  They say juries, especially saying somebody's a traitor, will rule for us.
[01:47:42.368 --> 01:47:44.269]  I mean, these are pretty much open and shut.
[01:47:44.609 --> 01:47:49.270]  Because saying somebody is a frickin' foreign agent, if you don't have proof, it's a big deal.
[01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:52.211]  Now Obama, Hillary Clinton, all of them, they are.
[01:47:52.271 --> 01:47:54.532]  They're pieces of globalist scum.
[01:47:55.782 --> 01:47:59.807]  But it is true that they're protected when they make these false charges on the House floor.
[01:48:00.148 --> 01:48:06.516]  It is not so clear that they can demean American citizens, no matter how publicly they're known, when they're off the House floor.
[01:48:07.016 --> 01:48:09.980]  So I hope to have my day in Washington.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.103]  Well, what about this slimeball, whatever her name is?
[01:48:13.163 --> 01:48:17.145]  Over at the Federal Elections Commission saying they want to criminally investigate me.
[01:48:17.265 --> 01:48:24.447]  Well, it's this FCC power grab where they say maybe it's a violation of campaign finance that he got valuable data.
[01:48:24.647 --> 01:48:28.788]  So now information is currency according to the Federal Election Commission.
[01:48:29.028 --> 01:48:31.509]  So if you get some info, you violated law.
[01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:40.072]  That sounds like the biggest power grab, mission creep, galactic level, cult level control, and this same doddering ding-dong.
[01:48:40.592 --> 01:48:44.214]  Is saying they know I'm getting money from the Russians.
[01:48:44.614 --> 01:48:45.274]  No, lady!
[01:48:45.874 --> 01:48:46.154]  No!
[01:48:46.695 --> 01:48:48.335]  No, you stupid piece of crap!
[01:48:48.495 --> 01:48:51.657]  And there's no evidence, there's no precedent for that argument.
[01:48:52.037 --> 01:48:57.939]  That information, you know, is something of value in this case under the federal election law.
[01:48:57.959 --> 01:48:59.040]  I mean, she is a piece of crap!
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.200]  Don't know her, but I would say this.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.661]  Where are the Republican commissioners?
[01:49:03.261 --> 01:49:08.002]  Why don't any of them step up and say, this is nonsense, that there's no violation of law here?
[01:49:08.482 --> 01:49:12.663]  See, Donald Trump's biggest problem is not liberal Democrats, it's establishment Republicans!
[01:49:12.763 --> 01:49:13.643]  It is, it is.
[01:49:13.663 --> 01:49:27.026]  But when I say that Clinton sold us out of the Communist Chinese, it's confirmed they gave him the missiles, and the re-entry, and the MIRV technology, and the guidance, and Lorall and Hughes, and it's confirmed ABB, and it's confirmed the reactors in North Korea.
[01:49:27.286 --> 01:49:28.106]  It's confirmed!
[01:49:28.426 --> 01:49:32.490]  And that they took $600,000 in illegal Chinese campaign contributions.
[01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:38.075]  And then just yesterday, again, the Saudis admit that they funded 20% of Hillary's campaign.
[01:49:38.775 --> 01:49:40.457]  Where's the investigation into that?
[01:49:40.737 --> 01:49:43.119]  When are we going to look into foreign financing?
[01:49:43.139 --> 01:49:45.541]  Well, we've all just got to start writing the articles and banging the drum.
[01:49:45.581 --> 01:49:46.122]  That's what we do.
[01:49:46.582 --> 01:49:47.823]  And just force it out there.
[01:49:47.843 --> 01:49:53.046]  We're going to go to break, come back and talk to Cody, Declan, Justin, Zach, Alyssa, and others with Roger Stone.
[01:49:53.526 --> 01:49:54.907]  Roger Stone is here with us in the studio.
[01:49:54.967 --> 01:49:56.688]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:49:56.728 --> 01:49:58.089]  He's got StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:49:58.369 --> 01:50:02.992]  Before I go any further, briefly, some of our best-selling supplements and pharmaceuticals are back.
[01:50:03.472 --> 01:50:08.035]  MycoZX hits the fungus, the candida, the mold that is in the gut, unlike any other probiotic.
[01:50:08.075 --> 01:50:09.296]  The others just deal with bacteria.
[01:50:09.556 --> 01:50:10.797]  You take it with our
[01:50:12.052 --> 01:50:12.212]  I don't
[01:50:32.356 --> 01:50:35.078]  175 clinical studies on BioPQQ alone.
[01:50:35.518 --> 01:50:36.099]  Amazing!
[01:50:36.139 --> 01:50:37.340]  It costs 3-4 times this.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.581]  In medical clinics, it isn't even as strong.
[01:50:39.821 --> 01:50:42.143]  This is our Rolls-Royce product, DNA Force.
[01:50:42.523 --> 01:50:43.364]  DNA Force.
[01:50:43.684 --> 01:50:47.907]  It is available at InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:47.927 --> 01:50:58.794]  And when you fund us, you are funding the white-hot sword of truth, taking down the globalists savagely, one hack and one stab at a time, committed to victory.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:51:01.195]  And boy, are we having victory thanks to your support.
[01:51:01.476 --> 01:51:02.016]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.183 --> 01:51:02.415]  Yes.
[01:51:08.283 --> 01:51:12.747]  Shot Congress Representative Steve Scalise was actively seeking to stop pedophilia.
[01:51:12.907 --> 01:51:15.770]  He had come out and said human trafficking is as easy as ordering a pizza.
[01:51:15.810 --> 01:51:18.072]  That's code word to us, letting us know he knows.
[01:51:18.632 --> 01:51:23.376]  It's over 10,000 arrests of pedophiles, several thousand that had kids in cages.
[01:51:23.657 --> 01:51:27.620]  Hundreds in LA, hundreds in San Francisco, any major city, hundreds.
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:32.504]  So we now have Scalise, we learned weeks ago, was coming out saying we're going after the pedophiles.
[01:51:32.825 --> 01:51:33.966]  Then this happens, here's the clip.
[01:51:34.346 --> 01:51:44.795]  This week, the House took strong actions to stand up for the victims of human trafficking, passing tough bills to provide them protection and to target child predators.
[01:51:45.636 --> 01:51:48.458]  Let's work together to get these bills signed into law.
[01:51:48.998 --> 01:51:52.521]  And there were over 400 pedophile arrests in his state just alone last year.
[01:51:53.622 --> 01:51:59.744]  Now, again, you've got Huffington Post writers, it's all up on InfoWars.com, saying, you know, it's time for organized resistance.
[01:51:59.764 --> 01:52:03.905]  You've got other writers, major papers saying, you know, too bad there weren't more of this guy.
[01:52:04.165 --> 01:52:07.066]  Matt Bracken, what do you make of the situation where we're currently at?
[01:52:07.106 --> 01:52:14.468]  Because you've been accurately predicting this, and they are really gearing up for it, and it's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[01:52:14.528 --> 01:52:18.069]  The left-wing mainstream media is absolutely instigating it.
[01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:22.731]  You could almost say stage-managing it, you know, with the help from the Democrats in Congress.
[01:52:24.312 --> 01:52:31.518]  Gateway Pundit has a great story up today about the New York Times article in April 12th this year.
[01:52:31.538 --> 01:52:36.442]  I saw that yesterday where they advertised where they are and that there's not much security.
[01:52:36.682 --> 01:52:48.892]  Right, so for a guy like Hodgkinson who left Illinois as a killer, but the New York Times handed him the information, this is where to go where they'll have very minimal security.
[01:52:48.932 --> 01:52:49.433]  It said, you know,
[01:52:50.073 --> 01:52:54.895]  Maybe some Capitol Police sitting in a black SUV at the ballpark.
[01:52:55.435 --> 01:53:03.218]  Well, that gives you another, you know, 350 degrees of a big fenced-in area away from the black SUV where you can take your shots from.
[01:53:03.238 --> 01:53:05.799]  The New York Times should get an assist on this hit.
[01:53:05.939 --> 01:53:08.000]  They absolutely should get credit for it.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:14.282]  And it's so ironic because the paragraph above the paragraph where it says, you know, that they are practicing at this field,
[01:53:15.063 --> 01:53:22.891]  It said, well, security officials are very cautious about giving out details because they, you know, say it could compromise security.
[01:53:23.312 --> 01:53:26.635]  And in the next paragraph, the New York Times says, you know, wink, wink.
[01:53:27.396 --> 01:53:33.283]  But if you really wanted to get a bunch of congressmen without much security, here's where you would do it.
[01:53:33.463 --> 01:53:34.584]  Imagine if Fox News
[01:53:35.605 --> 01:53:42.170]  Or Breitbart or Infowars had done an article on Hillary Clinton's security.
[01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:50.856]  And in this article about Hillary Clinton's security, mentioned, let's say, you know, tennis clubs she liked to go to with only a close friend.
[01:53:51.376 --> 01:53:51.857]  Exactly.
[01:53:51.977 --> 01:53:56.240]  Oh, here's where Hillary, you know, goes once a week to play bridge, right here at the corner of this.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:57.201]  There's not much security.
[01:53:57.481 --> 01:53:58.501]  There'll just be one car.
[01:53:58.522 --> 01:54:00.403]  So if you just come into the alley, you can get her right there.
[01:54:05.339 --> 01:54:11.545]  Trouble so hard, ooh Lordy my, trouble so hard.
[01:54:12.005 --> 01:54:16.129]  Don't nobody know my trouble with God.
[01:54:16.429 --> 01:54:20.733]  Don't nobody know my trouble with God.
[01:54:20.953 --> 01:54:26.498]  Ooh Lordy my, trouble so hard, ooh Lordy my.
[01:54:27.469 --> 01:54:36.358]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[01:54:36.898 --> 01:54:44.826]  Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.
[01:54:47.288 --> 01:54:50.511]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, going to your phone calls in this segment.
[01:54:51.531 --> 01:54:56.654]  And the next, then we have the man that infiltrated the big American Muslim organization.
[01:54:57.194 --> 01:55:01.977]  To break down what they're actually up to, we'll look at Linda Sarsour and George Soros and more.
[01:55:02.017 --> 01:55:06.939]  Then Roger Stone will be back hosting the fourth hour.
[01:55:07.499 --> 01:55:13.282]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today here in studio with us.
[01:55:14.023 --> 01:55:16.364]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:55:16.384 --> 01:55:17.165]  We got Declan.
[01:55:17.925 --> 01:55:19.446]  Declan is, I guess, about
[01:55:20.427 --> 01:55:21.829]  Thank you very much for having me, Alec.
[01:55:37.037 --> 01:55:53.506]  I was just thinking, with North Korea obviously now having a missile that can basically hit anywhere on the globe, is there any way we're going to be able to convince the West that, you know, the biggest threat maybe isn't white supremacists but outside of the West?
[01:55:55.531 --> 01:55:58.854]  Islam coming into the country hasn't seemed to really faze them at all.
[01:55:59.254 --> 01:55:59.754]  Well, that's right.
[01:55:59.814 --> 01:56:02.016]  Why is the left so hateful, Roger Stone?
[01:56:02.336 --> 01:56:03.757]  Why do they embrace radical Islam?
[01:56:03.777 --> 01:56:05.838]  Why do they embrace North Korea, Communist China?
[01:56:06.158 --> 01:56:08.540]  Why do they not want us to even have weapons to defend ourselves?
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:17.606]  What is the mental illness of these untraveled, ignorant buffoons, these boobies, to want to constantly cozy up to our enemies?
[01:56:17.966 --> 01:56:21.989]  You know, I think my friend Ian Coulter is right when he says liberalism is a mental illness.
[01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:42.561]  The idea that the party of John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman, a party that was staunchly anti-communist, although liberal perhaps on domestic policies, would now not stand up for gay people or Christians or Jews against Islamic terrorism, it's almost unthinkable.
[01:56:43.261 --> 01:56:47.604]  Where do they think the voter constituency is for this whacked out idea?
[01:56:47.944 --> 01:56:53.708]  How do they expect to win any elections when they won't stand up for American citizens and our safety and our security?
[01:56:53.748 --> 01:56:57.851]  Why do they want to kill the Golden Goose and why does the Republican establishment play along with them?
[01:56:58.769 --> 01:57:01.211]  I think that's for financial reasons, to be honest with you.
[01:57:01.251 --> 01:57:02.933]  Look, we know how Washington works.
[01:57:03.013 --> 01:57:04.594]  It's all about getting re-elected, Alex.
[01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:07.938]  It's all about milking the special interests for the next election.
[01:57:08.418 --> 01:57:12.422]  Yeah, they go on TV and they pretend to fight, then they all go out to dinner afterwards.
[01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:14.824]  But the difference is, Trump doesn't go out to dinner afterwards.
[01:57:14.864 --> 01:57:21.830]  He wears the American pin when they're wearing the G20 pin, but then he actually delivers, and they go, oh look, he didn't go along with them.
[01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:23.432]  That's great, we should celebrate that!
[01:57:23.612 --> 01:57:24.713]  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[01:57:24.753 --> 01:57:26.574]  He's not part of the Washington buddy system.
[01:57:26.814 --> 01:57:30.296]  He's not part of a broken system that's brought this country to its knees.
[01:57:30.896 --> 01:57:37.820]  He's not responsible for endless foreign wars, or the erosion of our civil liberties, or the massive debt and spending.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.081]  No, he was against the Iraq war.
[01:57:39.181 --> 01:57:41.122]  Declan, any other points from Australia?
[01:57:43.474 --> 01:57:47.416]  Yes, I read an article saying that you think ManBearPig is real.
[01:57:47.596 --> 01:57:50.137]  I didn't think you would, but any comments on that?
[01:57:50.157 --> 01:57:51.818]  You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:57:51.838 --> 01:57:55.539]  The media is so deceptive that they said that I said Donald Jr.
[01:57:55.579 --> 01:57:57.080]  met with her to see if she was a spy.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:00.041]  I said he met with her to see if they had evidence of Hillary being a spy.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.600]  And they just totally lying.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.981]  Or then I say there are human animal chimeras and it's an MIT magazine and they say that I say that's on Mars.
[01:58:08.241 --> 01:58:08.822]  Never said that.
[01:58:09.262 --> 01:58:12.162]  So I mean the media has reached a new level of lying.
[01:58:12.562 --> 01:58:13.722]  I appreciate your call, Declan.
[01:58:13.742 --> 01:58:14.623]  You want to comment to that?
[01:58:14.663 --> 01:58:18.943]  I mean, do you agree it's reached to just a crescendo of hysterical lying, Roger Stone?
[01:58:19.003 --> 01:58:21.324]  Well, see, they're so used to having a monopoly, Alex.
[01:58:21.344 --> 01:58:23.084]  They're so used to being unchallenged.
[01:58:23.204 --> 01:58:25.265]  They're so used to being one voice.
[01:58:25.405 --> 01:58:26.945]  ABC, NBC, CBS.
[01:58:27.705 --> 01:58:31.789]  CNN and sadly now Fox, they move in lockstep.
[01:58:32.729 --> 01:58:38.354]  And since they thought they had the only megaphone, their lies have gotten bigger and bigger and more egregious.
[01:58:38.374 --> 01:58:44.820]  Well that's like CNN saying there was no rioting in Hamburg or in the, what was the town over in Germany where they had the G20?
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:46.261]  Or Frankfurt.
[01:58:46.341 --> 01:58:50.144]  Or 1,200 women weren't raped immediately after the first wave of Syrian refugees.
[01:58:50.164 --> 01:58:53.407]  Remember they made fun of Trump and said, what happened last night in Sweden?
[01:58:54.301 --> 01:58:59.203]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:00:17.569 --> 02:00:22.512]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.867 --> 02:00:34.088]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[02:00:35.789 --> 02:00:37.851]  Let's talk to Justin in the great state of Texas.
[02:00:37.951 --> 02:00:39.492]  Justin, you're on the air with Roger Stone.
[02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:40.173]  Go ahead, my friend.
[02:00:42.294 --> 02:00:43.935]  Mr. Stone?
[02:00:45.036 --> 02:00:45.396]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:45.557 --> 02:00:46.157]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:00:47.658 --> 02:00:47.958]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:47.978 --> 02:00:57.686]  I just wanted to ask you guys about the current Senate hearings for Christopher Wray and how, while all the Senators are pointing out that
[02:00:58.892 --> 02:01:03.977]  Um, Comey, you know, obviously stood out and disparaged an innocent person that had no charges against them.
[02:01:04.558 --> 02:01:12.246]  There's synchronized attacks in the commercial breaks where Adam Schiff comes out and does the exact same thing, disparaging a person with no charges against them.
[02:01:13.499 --> 02:01:15.081]  Yeah, Adam Schiff is a disgrace.
[02:01:15.121 --> 02:01:20.606]  The fact that this guy's even in the Congress is confounding because he is such a lightweight.
[02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.869]  He's the Sammy Glick of American politics.
[02:01:23.889 --> 02:01:28.354]  This guy's on the make and he somehow thinks he's going to get a California
[02:01:29.314 --> 02:01:29.535]  U.S.
[02:01:29.575 --> 02:01:32.877]  Senate seat, which will, I assure you, never happen.
[02:01:33.778 --> 02:01:47.768]  I'm somewhat disturbed by the President's choice of Christopher Wray, not only because of his closeness to Governor Chris Christie, but more precisely, I think the President would have been better served by an FBI director who he knew.
[02:01:48.488 --> 02:01:53.234]  Somebody who he had a long-term relationship with and therefore had some trust in.
[02:01:53.555 --> 02:01:59.281]  This is why I thought former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would be an ideal choice.
[02:01:59.782 --> 02:02:00.603]  Non-political.
[02:02:01.064 --> 02:02:03.487]  Widely respected in the law enforcement community.
[02:02:03.807 --> 02:02:07.331]  But someone that Donald Trump knows personally, has known for many years.
[02:02:08.432 --> 02:02:14.634]  I still stick to my prediction, by the way, that the President will imminently, within days, have a second U.S.
[02:02:14.694 --> 02:02:23.356]  Supreme Court seat to fill, because I am told that Justice Kennedy's resignation will come any day now.
[02:02:24.156 --> 02:02:35.259]  I think some have urged him to go in late July as opposed to early July, but I predicted this here on InfoWars over two months ago, and this is coming, which means the President
[02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:41.611]  Who, by the way, is the first president to successfully confirm a U.S.
[02:02:41.651 --> 02:02:49.095]  Supreme Court nominee in the first hundred days of his presidency, will have a second opportunity to completely shape the country.
[02:02:49.115 --> 02:02:49.315]  All right.
[02:02:49.395 --> 02:02:50.475]  Justin, thank you so much.
[02:02:50.515 --> 02:02:51.496]  Great, great questions.
[02:02:52.036 --> 02:02:53.877]  Let's talk to another caller here.
[02:02:53.897 --> 02:02:59.979]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Sue in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:59.999 --> 02:03:00.780]  You're on the air, Sue.
[02:03:02.409 --> 02:03:03.489]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:05.150]  It's great to talk to you.
[02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:13.053]  The only thing that I really wanted to say is that Donald Trump Jr., what he did was just, he was working in his father's campaign.
[02:03:13.293 --> 02:03:17.395]  He must have had hundreds of people come in with multiple requests.
[02:03:17.795 --> 02:03:22.217]  But in Hillary's campaign, David Brock actually put forward
[02:03:22.737 --> 02:03:33.246]  An organization paying money to people to come up with dirt on Donald Trump and somehow... Oh yeah, they ran off to Russia and Europe and talked to hundreds of Russians.
[02:03:33.306 --> 02:03:35.448]  Why are they allowed to talk to Russians but nobody else can?
[02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:42.493]  Well, and we know from the WikiLeaks disclosures that Hillary herself was involved in the Dirty Tricks operation.
[02:03:43.073 --> 02:03:43.754]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:03:43.774 --> 02:03:47.275]  Didn't Nixon go down because they... They rigged the debates!
[02:03:47.375 --> 02:03:48.736]  They rigged the polls!
[02:03:48.876 --> 02:03:50.577]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[02:03:50.777 --> 02:03:51.698]  Oh, but Donnie Jr.
[02:03:51.718 --> 02:03:56.200]  met for 20 minutes with some Russian lawyer that we now know is hooked up with Soros events.
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.981]  In a meeting that was a nothing burger.
[02:03:58.061 --> 02:04:00.522]  No, the double standard here is shocking.
[02:04:00.582 --> 02:04:01.102]  Absolutely.
[02:04:01.202 --> 02:04:02.023]  And almost laughable.
[02:04:02.083 --> 02:04:02.783]  Sue, go ahead, sorry.
[02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:23.967]  David Brock has probably still got that in operation, no doubt, but in the same respect, also about the server, about Hillary's server, why is the Hillary Clinton DNC front organization like CrowdStrike the only organization that was able to see the email?
[02:04:23.987 --> 02:04:25.608]  That's right, that's right.
[02:04:25.628 --> 02:04:30.689]  The NSA and FBI wanted in their servers and they wouldn't let them and Obama block the Russia investigation.
[02:04:30.909 --> 02:04:32.229]  They're the ones that obstructed.
[02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:33.450]  That's exactly true.
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:39.614]  In other words, you cannot assert that the Russians hacked the DNC server if you can't examine the server.
[02:04:40.014 --> 02:04:41.736]  And they would let the FBI ever examine the server.
[02:04:41.856 --> 02:04:42.676]  Twenty times.
[02:04:43.237 --> 02:04:47.219]  So, CrowdStrike makes up this lie, which they can't sustain.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:50.282]  Now, there was no Russian hacking of the DNC.
[02:04:50.302 --> 02:04:53.064]  Well, the truth is, the Democrats are selling out to anybody and everybody.
[02:04:53.664 --> 02:04:54.925]  People say, why did they hit America so much?
[02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:57.627]  Because only traitors like this would do horrible things like this.
[02:04:57.927 --> 02:05:00.435]  And Bill and Hillary Clinton would steal a hot stove.
[02:05:00.616 --> 02:05:01.499]  Great, great point.
[02:05:01.539 --> 02:05:02.241]  I'm glad you raised that.
[02:05:04.118 --> 02:05:05.540]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:06.641]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:06.901 --> 02:05:07.822]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:08.122 --> 02:05:13.346]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:13.446 --> 02:05:26.997]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:27.057 --> 02:05:28.439]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:29.339 --> 02:05:30.800]  Spreading disease around.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:33.342]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:33.442 --> 02:05:34.703]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:34.743 --> 02:05:35.844]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:05:35.864 --> 02:05:36.925]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:37.216 --> 02:05:41.520]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:44.883]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:44.903 --> 02:05:48.086]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:48.126 --> 02:05:49.127]  It just came back in yesterday.

[02:07:01.979 --> 02:07:05.563]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.

[02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:41.114]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what I did for them, because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[02:07:41.194 --> 02:07:44.156]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:08:16.138 --> 02:08:16.899]  Big Brother.
[02:08:17.259 --> 02:08:18.500]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:20.141]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:21.001 --> 02:08:22.402]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:22.662 --> 02:08:23.803]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:24.323 --> 02:08:28.826]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.141 --> 02:08:53.278]  Roger Stone's riding a shotgun with us for another 30 minutes, and then Dr. Jerome Corsi's got breaking news on the latest Google wars, and the big billionaire is asking Google to start censoring info wars, along with the Federal Elections Commission.
[02:08:54.412 --> 02:08:58.313]  Says we're under criminal investigation and wants InfoWars basically shut down.
[02:08:59.073 --> 02:09:02.414]  It just shows how wildly out of control and evil they are.
[02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:04.294]  Of course, it's the Streisand effect.
[02:09:05.355 --> 02:09:12.956]  Since Megyn Kelly came after me and the media declared me the most evil person in America with a bunch of made-up stuff I didn't say, guess what happened?
[02:09:13.077 --> 02:09:14.917]  More affiliates, more listeners.
[02:09:15.017 --> 02:09:21.298]  Our reach on Facebook is the second highest it's ever been except for the week of the election and it's only going up.
[02:09:21.679 --> 02:09:22.879]  I mean, InfoWars is
[02:09:23.439 --> 02:09:24.179]  Exploding!
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:28.001]  Our video views, our page reads, it is incredible.
[02:09:28.041 --> 02:09:35.005]  Because, you know, we had a peak at the election, and then we had a new plateau that was a larger audience than before the election, but it was pretty much flat.
[02:09:35.145 --> 02:09:39.508]  Now it's skyrocketing up, and the only reason I mention that before we go to our next guest is...
[02:09:40.228 --> 02:09:43.433]  Roger Stone, you were just talking during the break without even me mentioning Megyn Kelly.
[02:09:44.034 --> 02:09:46.498]  I was telling you our numbers are way up and I was showing you some of the numbers.
[02:09:46.538 --> 02:09:49.883]  You said, yeah, I think it's the fact that it was the destruction of Megyn Kelly.
[02:09:50.284 --> 02:09:51.305]  Again, it wasn't me.
[02:09:51.686 --> 02:09:55.452]  It was how over the top the hit piece was totally blew up in their face.
[02:09:55.592 --> 02:10:01.354]  Yeah, no, you exposed them up front and I think it was a brilliant strategy to frame the thing before they showed it.
[02:10:02.134 --> 02:10:12.156]  And then by releasing the actual full audio tapes, you demonstrated where they were going to cut and paste and misrepresent and take things out of context.
[02:10:12.317 --> 02:10:15.197]  I look, that war is over and I think you won.
[02:10:15.677 --> 02:10:17.118]  What I find interesting, Alex, is
[02:10:17.998 --> 02:10:22.199]  As Fox is going down, InfoWars is going up.
[02:10:22.399 --> 02:10:26.280]  You predicted that here a year ago, and I was like, it's really happening.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:37.703]  As one of the two Murdoch brothers absolutely heads this drive to make Fox into the Sky Channel, to take any conservative balance out of their news coverage,
[02:10:38.803 --> 02:10:39.964]  He's destroying the brand.
[02:10:40.064 --> 02:10:43.126]  He's destroying the reason that people go to Fox.
[02:10:43.626 --> 02:10:49.690]  It's only a matter of time before patriots like Sean Hannity or Judge Andrew Napolitano or Judge Jeanine Pirro.
[02:10:49.710 --> 02:10:50.351]  Tucker Carlson.
[02:10:50.491 --> 02:10:52.232]  Tucker Carlson, that they're no longer there.
[02:10:52.912 --> 02:10:57.395]  Tucker Carlson, if you ask me, is the, I mean, that's their flagship show now.
[02:10:57.455 --> 02:11:03.359]  And I don't want to get Tucker in trouble, but I've talked to some of the folks at Fox, not Tucker, but I mean, they are on a very short leash now.
[02:11:03.779 --> 02:11:06.080]  I mean, Hannity gets chewed out when he stands up for Trump.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:06.881]  I mean, it is bad.
[02:11:08.088 --> 02:11:12.371]  Look, you know, the great thing about Tucker is that he's the same person on the air as he is.
[02:11:12.771 --> 02:11:13.371]  He is.
[02:11:13.411 --> 02:11:16.693]  He's just even-tempered, but he destroys the left.
[02:11:17.033 --> 02:11:18.774]  And he does it with a smile on his face.
[02:11:19.075 --> 02:11:20.415]  He does it as a gentleman.
[02:11:20.435 --> 02:11:21.116]  There's no shouting.
[02:11:21.136 --> 02:11:22.096]  Well, where do they go now?
[02:11:24.269 --> 02:11:29.811]  Obviously they're allied with radical Islam, and that's why our next guest joins us.
[02:11:29.831 --> 02:11:30.712]  I hope I pronounced it right.
[02:11:30.732 --> 02:11:35.654]  He did a great job when he was on last week with Owen Shoyer here on The Nightly News.
[02:11:35.694 --> 02:11:42.236]  Chris Gobitz, I hope that's the correct way to pronounce it, twitter forward slash at UTT underscore USA.
[02:11:42.736 --> 02:11:43.897]  He infiltrated
[02:11:45.154 --> 02:11:52.996]  Care, that's the big national Muslim group, that's the so-called civil rights group, and he found out it's basically Hamas.
[02:11:53.116 --> 02:12:08.361]  Well, Linda Sarsour, she was on the news last week twice at speeches at a Hamas rally saying, you do not assimilate if you're a Muslim, and you've always got to be angry, and you've always got to be upset, and we need a jihad against Trump.
[02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:13.343]  So Chris, you've got a lot of courage infiltrating this group.
[02:12:13.383 --> 02:12:13.923]  Tell folks
[02:12:14.683 --> 02:12:16.004]  Who CARE really is.
[02:12:16.064 --> 02:12:21.346]  I've got some of the articles that were basically written after they went over all your research.
[02:12:22.006 --> 02:12:29.430]  We've got understandingthethreat.com, CARE is Hamas, Jihad is warfare against non-Muslims show.
[02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:36.673]  Chris, tell us about yourself and tell us about your long-term infiltration and the groundbreaking information you discovered.
[02:12:37.515 --> 02:12:37.775]  Sure.
[02:12:37.835 --> 02:12:40.057]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:12:40.177 --> 02:12:48.105]  First of all, I spent six straight months doing undercover research with Hamas doing businesses care, the Council on American Islamic Relations.
[02:12:48.845 --> 02:12:52.949]  And I posed as a Muslim convert in order to do this project.
[02:12:53.309 --> 02:12:56.132]  The book Muslim Mafia was written about that experience.
[02:12:56.853 --> 02:13:03.839]  And look, when we say in understanding the threat that carries a Hamas organization, that's not just our opinion.
[02:13:04.219 --> 02:13:12.904]  That's based on evidence entered into the largest terrorism financing and Hamas trial ever successfully prosecuted in American history, the U.S.
[02:13:12.924 --> 02:13:19.508]  v. Holy Land Foundation trial, where the Department of Justice identified CAIR as a Hamas organization.
[02:13:19.889 --> 02:13:24.011]  And for your listeners, Hamas is the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:13:24.431 --> 02:13:30.215]  There has never been a question from its very founding that CAIR was a Hamas organization.
[02:13:30.855 --> 02:13:58.895]  In 1993, there was a Philadelphia meeting that the FBI surveilled, and they said, per their own statement, the FBI, that was entered into evidence into the Holy Land Foundation trial, that every single member of this 1993 Philadelphia meeting was a member of Hamas, and two of those people at that meeting, Omar Ahmed and Nihat Awad, were the co-founders of CAIR, the Council on American Islamic Relations, and they founded it one year after that Hamas meeting.
[02:13:59.475 --> 02:14:01.597]  Again, Chris Kobatz is our guest.
[02:14:02.277 --> 02:14:04.819]  Amazing story and your infiltration.
[02:14:04.839 --> 02:14:08.882]  Where's the best place for people to learn about what's really going on at CARE?
[02:14:09.062 --> 02:14:11.404]  There's a lot of resources, but you're one of the leading experts.
[02:14:12.204 --> 02:14:15.026]  Well, you can go to our website, understandingthethreat.com.
[02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:17.588]  There's a tab called Resources and Writings.
[02:14:17.989 --> 02:14:21.031]  Free PDFs that are available to people to do their own research.
[02:14:21.431 --> 02:14:36.935]  But we have a document called Care is Hamas that has 30 statements of fact showing unequivocally based off statements by the FBI and evidence into terrorism finance trials showing unequivocally that Care is a Hamas organization.
[02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:39.635]  Which leads us right into Linda Sarsour.
[02:14:41.096 --> 02:14:41.916]  Let's talk about her.
[02:14:41.936 --> 02:14:43.096]  I'm going to play some clips in a moment.
[02:14:43.376 --> 02:14:44.576]  Most folks know who she is.
[02:14:45.077 --> 02:14:46.637]  She's just so brazen though.
[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:47.350]  Yeah.
[02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:49.391]  Well, of course she is.
[02:14:49.411 --> 02:14:50.191]  She's a jihadi.
[02:14:50.531 --> 02:15:06.316]  She's a jihadi that literally makes the speaking rounds at Muslim Brotherhood conferences, which the Muslim Brotherhood, to be very clear, is no different than Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State or the Taliban or both of them.
[02:15:06.356 --> 02:15:07.677]  Shabab fill in the blank.
[02:15:07.957 --> 02:15:10.938]  They all have the exact same agenda, which is
[02:15:14.684 --> 02:15:17.806]  Linda Sarsour speaks at Muslim Brotherhood conferences.
[02:15:18.406 --> 02:15:30.493]  She was speaking at an Islamic Society of North America, which the Department of Justice identified as a Muslim Brotherhood organization that was funneling money to Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization.
[02:15:30.813 --> 02:15:36.617]  And Colonel Schaeffer, who's briefed Congress in classified briefings, but also in public briefings, laid out five years ago the fact that 97%
[02:15:38.758 --> 02:15:39.078]  I think
[02:16:00.849 --> 02:16:07.735]  Just the main political brotherhood arm of the entire Wahhabist, which is what, I guess 80% of Islam is Sunni.
[02:16:08.175 --> 02:16:11.117]  And so what you've got is a global Sunni expansion operation.
[02:16:11.518 --> 02:16:18.263]  And are you saying from your infiltration, CARE is basically a Hamas-slash-Muslim Brotherhood organization?
[02:16:19.125 --> 02:16:19.746]  Unequivocally.
[02:16:20.046 --> 02:16:21.928]  CARE is a Hamas organization.
[02:16:21.988 --> 02:16:28.854]  Now, when we talk about Jihad, Alex, we have to understand that Jihad is total warfare from a Sharia perspective.
[02:16:29.254 --> 02:16:37.782]  Social, cultural, political, military, intelligence gathering, espionage, treason, political influence operations, and media manipulation.
[02:16:38.242 --> 02:16:46.850]  CARE primarily focuses here in the United States on political influence operations and media manipulations, and they are experts at this.
[02:16:48.510 --> 02:16:51.574]  And I don't need to believe you that infiltrated, or even the FBI.
[02:16:51.614 --> 02:16:57.262]  I can actually play Linda Sarsour, who a bunch of her family are in prison in Israel, members of Hamas.
[02:16:57.322 --> 02:16:57.723]  Here it is.
[02:16:58.621 --> 02:17:04.666]  Sisters and brothers, it's been 16, almost 17 years since the horrific attacks of 9-11.
[02:17:05.187 --> 02:17:10.512]  And we still, as a community, find ourselves unprepared in so many moments.
[02:17:10.592 --> 02:17:12.974]  Why, sisters and brothers, why are we so unprepared?
[02:17:13.034 --> 02:17:19.159]  Why are we so afraid of this administration and the potential chaos that they will ensue on our community?
[02:17:19.179 --> 02:17:20.881]  And we already saw their potential
[02:17:21.201 --> 02:17:37.054]  When they come out every few weeks, Muslim Ban 1, Muslim Ban 2, Muslim Ban 3, they are relentless, they are persistent and consistent, and want to see how much we as a community can endure, and want to see who our friends are, and how hard we're going to fight back against this administration.
[02:17:37.594 --> 02:17:48.163]  And I hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers.
[02:17:51.727 --> 02:18:01.178]  Why do you think the left is making this bizarre alliance with the most radical, out of control, virulent, cancerous forms of Islam?
[02:18:01.218 --> 02:18:02.719]  I mean, what planet are they from?
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:11.886]  They have to be assuming the total breakdown of our democratic system because there's no voting constituency in America for what they're embracing.
[02:18:12.386 --> 02:18:16.369]  So they have to be assuming that there'll be, in our near future, no elections.
[02:18:16.909 --> 02:18:20.051]  That we're moving to a globalist takeover of this country.
[02:18:20.071 --> 02:18:21.032]  That's not authoritarianism!
[02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:22.253]  And Islam's authoritarian.
[02:18:22.733 --> 02:18:23.253]  Exactly.
[02:18:23.273 --> 02:18:25.615]  Islam are the authoritarians.
[02:18:25.995 --> 02:18:36.201]  There's no other logical explanation because from a political point of view, there's no way that you would think that this is going to lead to an expansion of your voting coalition.
[02:18:36.882 --> 02:18:40.083]  Chris Kobach, the guy that infiltrated CARE, the only guy to really ever do it.
[02:18:40.464 --> 02:18:42.025]  I mean, is that accurate, what Stone just said?
[02:18:42.825 --> 02:18:45.510]  Absolutely, and I'd just like to expand on it a little bit.
[02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:52.941]  On the surface, it's hard for people to imagine, why would a leftist be aligning themselves with jihadis?
[02:18:53.041 --> 02:18:54.143]  And it's very simple.
[02:18:54.463 --> 02:18:57.428]  We just have to read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
[02:18:58.069 --> 02:18:58.329]  Thank you.
[02:19:15.726 --> 02:19:22.570]  That is why hard left Marxists and the left in general are willing to work with jihadis because they have the exact same goal.
[02:19:22.690 --> 02:19:28.653]  Tear down the system and out of that tearing down, out of that chaos, they will have their revolution.
[02:19:29.033 --> 02:19:32.015]  The jihadis believe they'll create an Islamic state under Sharia.
[02:19:32.395 --> 02:19:35.377]  The leftists believe they're going to have some sort of Marxist utopia.
[02:19:35.637 --> 02:19:39.179]  But in the meantime, they will work together to destroy this nation.
[02:19:39.439 --> 02:19:41.060]  So the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[02:19:41.826 --> 02:19:42.226]  That's right.
[02:19:42.706 --> 02:19:48.709]  Well, let's come back and talk about what it was like infiltrating, how long you did it, and what care is really, really up to.
[02:19:48.849 --> 02:19:53.651]  All I know is if the Middle East, our Muslim areas are so great, why don't you just go over there?
[02:19:53.791 --> 02:19:54.951]  We don't want to have Sharia law.
[02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:57.172]  We don't want to cut our daughters' genitals off.
[02:19:57.352 --> 02:19:59.313]  We don't want to have our wives wear beekeeper suits.
[02:19:59.353 --> 02:19:59.913]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:20:00.173 --> 02:20:00.894]  We just don't want it.
[02:20:00.914 --> 02:20:01.834]  And why the left loves it?
[02:20:02.194 --> 02:20:03.015]  It's their sick people.
[02:20:03.555 --> 02:20:10.357]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[02:20:10.437 --> 02:20:11.438]  You are fake news.
[02:20:33.578 --> 02:20:35.140]  Your organization's terrible.
[02:20:35.381 --> 02:20:36.482]  False and fake.
[02:21:05.049 --> 02:21:05.469]  Ha!
[02:21:05.949 --> 02:21:06.310]  Ha!
[02:21:06.730 --> 02:21:07.110]  Ha!
[02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:08.491]  La!
[02:21:09.291 --> 02:21:09.651]  La!
[02:21:09.911 --> 02:21:12.412]  La!
[02:21:12.532 --> 02:21:13.093]  Ha!
[02:21:13.153 --> 02:21:13.253]  Ha!
[02:21:13.313 --> 02:21:13.813]  Ha!
[02:21:35.779 --> 02:21:36.039]  I'm good.
[02:22:09.128 --> 02:22:11.690]  Too bad this isn't the wide world of sports!
[02:22:13.031 --> 02:22:14.752]  Use the Schwartz, Lone Star!
[02:22:15.233 --> 02:22:16.234]  Use the Schwartz!
[02:22:16.474 --> 02:22:16.974]  I can't!
[02:22:17.475 --> 02:22:18.255]  I lost the ring!
[02:22:18.575 --> 02:22:19.436]  Forget the ring!
[02:22:19.856 --> 02:22:20.877]  The ring is bucket!
[02:22:21.738 --> 02:22:24.340]  I found it in a Cracker Jack box!
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:26.522]  The Schwartz is in you, Lone Star!
[02:22:26.862 --> 02:22:27.722]  It's in you!
[02:22:28.343 --> 02:22:28.723]  Alright.
[02:22:29.384 --> 02:22:30.204]  I'll try.
[02:22:30.765 --> 02:22:33.067]  Say goodbye to your two best friends.
[02:22:33.727 --> 02:22:35.909]  And I don't mean your hands in the wind of fate.
[02:22:45.899 --> 02:22:50.521]  Pressing the self-destruct button, this ship will self-destruct in three minutes.
[02:22:54.063 --> 02:22:55.203]  All you for this?
[02:22:55.643 --> 02:22:59.265]  Yoo-hoo, Mr. Pirate!
[02:22:59.625 --> 02:23:00.946]  Oh, uh, Redbeard!
[02:23:14.248 --> 02:23:22.121]  Whoever does the best meme by next week, by next Wednesday, that has InfoWars.com included, will get $20,000.
[02:23:22.301 --> 02:23:27.489]  Plus we'll post a lot of the better memes on InfoWars.com and on our Twitter and Facebook.
[02:23:50.096 --> 02:23:50.917]  I'm good.
[02:24:10.738 --> 02:24:11.318]  All right, folks.
[02:24:11.498 --> 02:24:15.480]  Big moves against the First Amendment happening right now with Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them.
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:17.161]  They're also fighting with each other at the same time.
[02:24:17.621 --> 02:24:18.801]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:18.881 --> 02:24:26.484]  I've got to get our guest, Chris Gobach, back on for a full hour soon and have him send a lot of his documentation, articles.
[02:24:26.544 --> 02:24:27.204]  I've seen a lot of it.
[02:24:27.324 --> 02:24:28.345]  It's amazing.
[02:24:28.825 --> 02:24:33.647]  Inside Care, the biggest Islamist group in the country, who
[02:24:35.282 --> 02:24:40.026]  Well, just quite frankly, most of my problems now behind the scenes are powerful, rich Muslims.
[02:24:40.566 --> 02:24:44.009]  The Chobani yogurt owner guy is a Sunni.
[02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:46.971]  And you saw all that made up crud.
[02:24:47.951 --> 02:24:49.993]  He's on the Federal Reserve Board of New York.
[02:24:50.073 --> 02:24:52.515]  I mean, the guy, he's only been there like 15 years.
[02:24:52.995 --> 02:24:54.356]  I mean, there is a takeover.
[02:24:54.376 --> 02:24:57.258]  The thing is, in the Middle East, it's about political power.
[02:24:57.719 --> 02:24:59.240]  This is a desert, most areas.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:00.341]  It's not about what you produce.
[02:25:00.381 --> 02:25:01.562]  It's about getting your head chopped off.
[02:25:02.142 --> 02:25:09.824]  And I'm not trying to be mean here, but I mean, you know, if there was some other cult of a hundred, you know, 1.5 billion, I'd be against it.
[02:25:09.844 --> 02:25:12.005]  And it's just so crazy.
[02:25:12.025 --> 02:25:18.446]  So just in a nutshell, Chris, infiltrating, and then jump at any time you want, Roger, you're about to take a break because you're hosting the fourth hour.
[02:25:20.167 --> 02:25:22.287]  In a nutshell, what did you witness inside CARE?
[02:25:22.367 --> 02:25:22.988]  How did you do it?
[02:25:23.008 --> 02:25:24.228]  It's groundbreaking.
[02:25:25.163 --> 02:25:40.628]  Well, first of all, when I talk about Islam, Sharia, Jihad, I understand that my experience speaking on this issue is from being with Hamas and going to mosques all over the country, particularly in Northern Virginia.
[02:25:41.048 --> 02:25:49.171]  So when I talk about Sharia and the goal of Sharia, which is to subjugate the entire planet under Sharia, and the
[02:25:49.411 --> 02:25:53.074]  And the Muslims could never take Europe before except for Istanbul and other areas.
[02:25:53.214 --> 02:25:54.475]  So they've learned, it's in the Koran, right?
[02:25:54.515 --> 02:25:56.797]  To not tell people you're planning on taking over.
[02:26:13.149 --> 02:26:13.669]  Absolutely.
[02:26:13.709 --> 02:26:21.532]  Look, in Sharia, a Muslim is obliged, not allowed, but obliged to lie if the goal is obligatory.
[02:26:21.612 --> 02:26:23.253]  And jihad is obligatory.
[02:26:23.573 --> 02:26:30.716]  And by the way, speaking of Linda Sarsour, jihad has always been warfare against non-Muslims.
[02:26:31.116 --> 02:26:46.139]  That is the legal definition for 1,400 years, and yet apologists from the Washington Times or Washington Post to Time Magazine are covering it up and saying that she meant a kinder, gentler form of jihad.
[02:26:46.499 --> 02:26:48.159]  And that's just simply not true.
[02:26:48.239 --> 02:26:57.701]  And she's a jihadi speaking at a jihadi conference, the Muslim Brotherhood Conference, and when she speaks about jihad, she knows what jihad means, and everyone in that conference knows what jihad means.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.941]  I love how I saw her hugging on de Blasio last week, where she'd be put in jail, caned or executed for hugging an unrelated man.
[02:27:05.181 --> 02:27:15.163]  I love how they come here to the lap of liberty, and then won't even let pro-life women march in their marches, and then the Muslims play along and are pro-abortion when it's liberal.
[02:27:15.503 --> 02:27:19.144]  It just seems so opportunistic and cockroach-like.
[02:27:19.984 --> 02:27:20.824]  Yeah, it's sinister.
[02:27:20.964 --> 02:27:27.005]  It's absolutely sinister, because they know that if Sharia is ever implemented, we're seeing Sharia implemented
[02:27:30.247 --> 02:27:32.108]  We see it throughout the Middle East.
[02:27:32.649 --> 02:27:42.114]  When it's implemented, all these rights that people like Linda Sarsour have and exploit here in America are gone as soon as the Sharia is implemented.
[02:27:42.335 --> 02:27:43.415]  And she knows that.
[02:27:45.016 --> 02:27:51.661]  But I do see an Islamo, an expert like you, there's usually, there are some queen bees that kind of flutter around and keep the women in line for the men, right?
[02:27:51.861 --> 02:27:53.762]  So she's kind of one of the queen bee women, right?
[02:27:55.015 --> 02:28:13.011]  Yeah, I mean she's definitely a leader in the movement and people look up to her on the left and within jihadi circles and we see Linda Sarsour or anybody at Muslim Brotherhood conferences, speakers, just understand their entire purpose is to destroy the West and America in particular.
[02:28:13.611 --> 02:28:14.572]  It's very interesting.
[02:28:14.873 --> 02:28:18.676]  You have Bill Maher with his show Real Time on HBO.
[02:28:18.756 --> 02:28:27.785]  Now, Bill Maher is wrong politically on virtually everything, but he's a harsh critic of Islam and radical Islam.
[02:28:28.505 --> 02:28:33.711]  They have launched an extraordinary effort to pressure HBO to drop Bill Maher.
[02:28:34.432 --> 02:28:35.593]  An extraordinary effort.
[02:28:35.673 --> 02:28:43.462]  They are being pummeled with complaints about his speaking the truth about the dangers of radical Islam.
[02:28:44.022 --> 02:28:47.505]  So in this particular case, I'm in solidarity with a leftist.
[02:28:48.026 --> 02:28:50.288]  Because on this issue, he's absolutely right.
[02:28:50.408 --> 02:28:52.110]  But they are attempting to censor him.
[02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.530]  That's right.
[02:28:52.570 --> 02:29:01.899]  They've gotten such target psychosis trying to take out patriots that they're willing to ally themselves with Islam when it's a thousand times... I mean, conservatives let liberals do whatever they want.
[02:29:03.064 --> 02:29:04.025]  I'm against censorship.
[02:29:04.045 --> 02:29:05.145]  Censorship's a bad idea.
[02:29:05.166 --> 02:29:07.327]  I don't care how crazy left you are.
[02:29:07.367 --> 02:29:08.528]  You should have the right to speak.
[02:29:08.888 --> 02:29:10.269]  That's not how they see it.
[02:29:11.009 --> 02:29:11.730]  Great point, Roger.
[02:29:12.250 --> 02:29:15.292]  Chris Gobots of UnderstandingTheThreat.com, please come back in the near future.
[02:29:15.492 --> 02:29:16.773]  We've got 30 seconds left.
[02:29:17.013 --> 02:29:22.657]  Am I right in saying, though, they're panicked because they realize the political correctness is worn off and the sleeping giant's awakening?
[02:29:23.539 --> 02:29:29.864]  Oh, look, they're absolutely terrified of the potential that President Trump has to completely dismantle the jihadi network here in America.
[02:29:30.204 --> 02:29:35.628]  But it's going to take Americans all over to get involved, so please feel free to visit us at understandingthethreat.com.
[02:29:35.948 --> 02:29:36.849]  We need you in the fight.
[02:29:37.289 --> 02:29:40.651]  Well, please come back next week or so for a full hour to lay out the infiltrations.
[02:29:40.751 --> 02:29:42.212]  You can send us articles, documents.
[02:29:42.272 --> 02:29:43.713]  I really admire what you've done.
[02:29:43.733 --> 02:29:48.697]  This is true investigative journalism, and I want to understand how you had the idea, why you did it, and it's been so effective.
[02:29:48.937 --> 02:29:50.298]  Thank you so much, Mr. Kobatz.
[02:29:50.338 --> 02:29:52.179]  Again, understandingthethreat.com.
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:53.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:53.761 --> 02:29:54.302]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:29:54.683 --> 02:29:56.787]  We salute your courage.
[02:29:56.947 --> 02:29:57.388]  Absolutely.
[02:29:57.829 --> 02:29:59.432]  I wanted to ask him, does he ever get threats?
[02:29:59.893 --> 02:30:00.194]  You know what?
[02:30:00.575 --> 02:30:01.657]  Come back in 30 seconds on the other side.
[02:30:01.677 --> 02:30:02.478]  I want to ask him that question.
[02:30:03.888 --> 02:30:13.114]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[02:30:13.714 --> 02:30:16.877]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[02:30:17.337 --> 02:30:23.801]  And that's why, whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[02:30:24.121 --> 02:30:32.147]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[02:30:32.947 --> 02:30:33.687]  And it gets worse.
[02:30:34.047 --> 02:30:45.171]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[02:30:45.611 --> 02:30:52.674]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[02:30:53.354 --> 02:31:05.702]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president.
[02:31:06.202 --> 02:31:18.110]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:30.940]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:39.287]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[02:31:39.907 --> 02:31:46.713]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[02:31:47.354 --> 02:31:57.542]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[02:31:58.243 --> 02:32:02.447]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[02:32:04.252 --> 02:32:10.134]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:32:10.314 --> 02:32:11.555]  The contest is simple.
[02:32:11.835 --> 02:32:17.096]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:32:17.296 --> 02:32:24.459]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:32:24.619 --> 02:32:31.201]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:31.301 --> 02:32:41.164]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:32:41.364 --> 02:32:48.907]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:32:49.107 --> 02:32:59.056]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[02:33:02.559 --> 02:33:03.520]  This is Kit Daniels.
[02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:21.666]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:34.781 --> 02:33:43.663]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[02:33:44.183 --> 02:33:52.004]  Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.
[02:33:52.245 --> 02:34:04.167]  See, what they've done is, they've drummed out any culture in the West to then bring in the alien culture of the most radical forms of orthodox, Wahhabist garbage, and
[02:34:05.325 --> 02:34:09.008]  Then all the nice guy stuff's ended, and they're in our face.
[02:34:09.028 --> 02:34:14.934]  So I just wanted to go back to Mr. Gobots of UnderstandingTheThreat.com, who infiltrated Hamas.
[02:34:14.954 --> 02:34:16.695]  I'll get him back for a full hour in the next few weeks.
[02:34:18.056 --> 02:34:31.168]  I know personally, and the average person isn't going to have this happen, because I don't want to do their intimidating for them, but I've just started noticing the last three or four years, I mean, tagging after the sponsors, getting us kicked off Google Ads, getting us kicked off
[02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:37.132]  You know, a lot of different systems coming up, but doors only opened afterwards each time.
[02:34:37.932 --> 02:34:47.077]  But the point is, the Chobani Yogurt guy who's bringing in the refugees, all the rest of it, not Chobani Yogurt, the owner of it is the big proponent bringing them in.
[02:34:48.198 --> 02:34:50.781]  I mean, they are on the Federal Reserve Board.
[02:34:50.821 --> 02:34:51.522]  They're everywhere.
[02:34:51.942 --> 02:34:55.727]  And people that have had family here 300 years, they're not on these boards.
[02:34:55.847 --> 02:34:59.591]  It's like everywhere I turn around, it is hardcore radical Muslims.
[02:34:59.631 --> 02:35:03.515]  And I don't want to get in a fight between Shiite and Sunni, but I mean, it's almost all
[02:35:04.116 --> 02:35:10.341]  The majority, you know, Sunni-backed group, who don't even get along with each other, and they're just everywhere.
[02:35:10.421 --> 02:35:24.893]  So, obviously, our elites, like Roger said and like you said, Mr. Gobots, they want authoritarianism, and just like the mayor of London says, I'm an authoritarian, you're used to it, they believe Islamists, I guess, will fit the bill, enter the outside alien force.
[02:35:25.494 --> 02:35:27.876]  They can use, in fact, I had a member of parliament who's a liberal.
[02:35:28.576 --> 02:35:29.196]  A few years ago.
[02:35:29.536 --> 02:35:34.759]  He said, listen, most of the CPS that come to take your kids aren't from England, and most of them are Muslims.
[02:35:35.319 --> 02:35:39.460]  So it's like they're the outside force you bring in to basically enforce.
[02:35:39.561 --> 02:35:40.341]  Is that accurate?
[02:35:40.421 --> 02:35:45.183]  Just briefly, Mr. Gobach, and then just briefly, have you been threatened after you infiltrated CARE?
[02:35:46.226 --> 02:35:47.728]  Well, absolutely, it's accurate.
[02:35:47.808 --> 02:35:52.192]  And the more you know about this infiltration here in the United States, the worse it gets.
[02:35:52.212 --> 02:36:01.962]  I mean, look, we have Muslim Brotherhood members that have been on the Department of Homeland Security's advisory board with secret clearances.
[02:36:02.503 --> 02:36:06.166]  So imagine the intelligence gathering that they can do and the influence.
[02:36:06.186 --> 02:36:09.190]  Remember the guys running the Democratic Party servers were jihadis.
[02:36:09.850 --> 02:36:10.450]  Absolutely.
[02:36:10.751 --> 02:36:13.712]  This penetration, again, the more you know the worse it gets, Alex.
[02:36:13.732 --> 02:36:14.893]  This penetration is deep.
[02:36:15.693 --> 02:36:16.414]  Is there a threat?
[02:36:16.454 --> 02:36:24.438]  Of course there's a threat, you know, but every American that speaks truthfully about Islam and Sharia and Jihad is going to be threatened.
[02:36:24.538 --> 02:36:29.241]  And so we just simply can't back down here in America or in the West or we will lose this war.
[02:36:30.086 --> 02:36:33.312]  And they hate it because Trump is actually not under the spell anymore.
[02:36:33.332 --> 02:36:38.000]  Like Lord of the Rings analogy, Gondor, he comes out of the spell.
[02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:41.447]  I mean, with Trump, I think we're coming out from under the spell.
[02:36:43.161 --> 02:36:43.801]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:43.821 --> 02:37:01.389]  Look, one of the biggest things symbolically that President Trump has done is cancel the Iftar dinner at the White House, which this is a tradition that goes all the way back to First Lady Hillary Clinton, although the jihadis will tell you it goes back to Thomas Jefferson, and that's just a bold-faced lie.
[02:37:02.910 --> 02:37:03.130]  All right.
[02:37:17.947 --> 02:37:18.488]  We're good to go.
[02:37:33.302 --> 02:37:37.224]  Well, let's talk about this next week if you can, because as you said, care pretty much is a moss.
[02:37:37.544 --> 02:37:39.465]  Sarcer is pretty much a moss, that's provable.
[02:37:39.905 --> 02:37:41.386]  It's time to just take the gloves off.
[02:37:41.686 --> 02:37:46.428]  People masquerading under our civil rights groups don't get to use our open culture to bring it down.
[02:37:46.829 --> 02:37:51.351]  And if folks want the gloves off, let me tell you, the intimidation stuff I've dealt with, that just makes me take the gloves off.
[02:37:52.471 --> 02:37:54.072]  Yeah, no holds barred.
[02:37:54.152 --> 02:37:56.874]  Look, we're at war right now and it's about time we start acting like it.
[02:37:56.894 --> 02:37:58.434]  All right, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:37:58.474 --> 02:37:59.415]  Thank you so much for your courage.
[02:38:00.225 --> 02:38:01.186]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:38:01.206 --> 02:38:01.806]  Looking forward to it.
[02:38:01.826 --> 02:38:02.126]  Thank you.
[02:38:02.166 --> 02:38:03.607]  There goes Chris Kobach.
[02:38:03.627 --> 02:38:10.132]  And again, I did a lot of research before the interview, and then all of a sudden, it's like it's time for the interview, and I'm like, oh, I'm scrambling because that guy's done so much.
[02:38:10.412 --> 02:38:11.793]  You've been an expert on Islam.
[02:38:11.813 --> 02:38:13.994]  You work with the State Department on anti-terrorism, Dr. Corsi.
[02:38:14.394 --> 02:38:17.156]  Everybody knows I was criticized for not being for the Iraq War.
[02:38:17.576 --> 02:38:19.138]  People told me I was this Islamic sellout.
[02:38:19.218 --> 02:38:19.798]  No, I wasn't.
[02:38:20.258 --> 02:38:25.782]  I didn't want to go have the clash of civilizations, knock out the few sexual regimes, and put the very worst in.
[02:38:26.202 --> 02:38:27.143]  I've been proven right.
[02:38:27.663 --> 02:38:30.445]  And now it's a complete mess, and we just gotta cut it off!
[02:38:30.926 --> 02:38:48.559]  Well, I mean, it's... I think this was a great interview, because the determination to have Sharia law put in place is a determination to destroy Western civilization, and Donald Trump's exactly right about it, and it is a threat to the United States and the Constitution.
[02:38:49.259 --> 02:38:51.700]  Because this is a totalitarian... It's a total threat!
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:57.442]  There are jib-wearing Muslims all over the place now, and they're pissed at me in the street, getting in my face!
[02:38:57.662 --> 02:39:00.823]  And if you want to see the outcome of this, just take a look at Europe.
[02:39:01.223 --> 02:39:11.626]  Take a look at Europe now, where Sharia law is getting firmly placed into the structure of, you know, jurisprudence in Great Britain and various other countries.
[02:39:12.466 --> 02:39:14.207]  And as the numbers increase,
[02:39:14.887 --> 02:39:23.393]  The push to get Christianity out, to get the free speech out, to eliminate all the... And it's the left who is the spearhead for them!
[02:39:23.633 --> 02:39:34.080]  And it's amazed me that the left, in terms of its embracing of feminism, is going to tolerate the Islamic disregard and abuse of women.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.448]  Well, the truth is, the West is the place that held women up on a pedestal, and where women have the greatest rights.
[02:39:41.089 --> 02:39:47.458]  And so the truth is, the left just wants control of women, just like marketers do because they buy 80% of goods.
[02:39:47.959 --> 02:39:51.444]  They want to destroy the empowerment of women and everybody else!
[02:39:51.944 --> 02:39:52.984]  And the family.
[02:39:53.624 --> 02:39:55.485]  You take women down, you take it all down.
[02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:56.545]  And that's the point.
[02:39:57.005 --> 02:40:07.807]  This is a clash of civilizations which is irreconcilable as long as Islam stays radical, stays militant, stays jihadist and terrorist.
[02:40:08.367 --> 02:40:15.208]  And ultimately, the lying that's going on, saying, oh no, we're really wanting to get along, that's just first stage.
[02:40:15.828 --> 02:40:19.609]  Second stage is what you begin to see in Great Britain and in Europe.
[02:40:21.229 --> 02:40:22.450]  I couldn't even watch him this morning.
[02:40:22.470 --> 02:40:23.051]  I didn't have time.
[02:40:23.071 --> 02:40:23.871]  I watched like one video.
[02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:28.415]  There were like five in my Twitter feed of local news defending Sharia law.
[02:40:28.795 --> 02:40:30.537]  They're on the street stopping criminals.
[02:40:30.657 --> 02:40:31.357]  Isn't it great?
[02:40:31.678 --> 02:40:35.961]  And they come up to the woman reporter and say, you better cover your face.
[02:40:36.441 --> 02:40:41.505]  Let me tell you, if somebody walks up to my wife or my daughters when I'm around and says that, man, I am.
[02:40:41.886 --> 02:40:43.247]  You're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:40:43.527 --> 02:40:44.448]  Well, I understand.
[02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:53.094]  I think that's going to be a healthy and important reaction from Americans to understand the seriousness of this threat.
[02:40:53.695 --> 02:41:01.281]  Because Islam has no ability to say we're going to coexist with Christianity long term.
[02:41:01.681 --> 02:41:02.682]  It's just infirm.
[02:41:02.742 --> 02:41:04.744]  It's just the lie that's told at the beginning.
[02:41:05.284 --> 02:41:10.228]  And that's where I've said for years we need a reformation within Islam that is not happening.
[02:41:10.528 --> 02:41:12.530]  Well, they say Al-Qaeda is the reformation.
[02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:17.313]  Well, Al-Qaeda again is proof, and I think you see it all through the Middle East.
[02:41:17.353 --> 02:41:29.180]  I mean, the whole idea that you're going to have an Islamic caliphate, which is going to be beheading, going to be intolerant of any lifestyle, including LGBT.
[02:41:29.881 --> 02:41:33.924]  I can't understand why the LGBT agenda... It's crazy, because it's all just a big cult.
[02:41:34.384 --> 02:41:36.605]  And expanding on that, it has nothing to do with LBGT or anything.
[02:41:36.665 --> 02:41:40.468]  It just stands for pull everything down, we're in charge, we'll sort it out later.
[02:41:41.028 --> 02:41:42.289]  Take the Middle East and we'll get into the big...
[02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:43.810]  Yes.
[02:41:44.651 --> 02:41:49.614]  If you look at the Middle East, the globalists are backing the most radical, barbarous Muslims.
[02:41:49.694 --> 02:41:49.994]  Why?
[02:41:50.094 --> 02:41:55.258]  They want disorganized societies that multinationals can come in and exploit.
[02:41:56.792 --> 02:41:58.113]  Well, it's the whole principle.
[02:41:58.133 --> 02:41:59.213]  It goes back to Saul Alinsky.
[02:41:59.234 --> 02:42:00.394]  It goes back to Marxism 101.
[02:42:01.855 --> 02:42:03.716]  You create a chaos.
[02:42:03.756 --> 02:42:05.057]  You create a revolution.
[02:42:05.097 --> 02:42:07.919]  You rub raw on all these discontents.
[02:42:08.419 --> 02:42:12.822]  So Islam is promoted by the globalists precisely because it's anti-American.
[02:42:13.402 --> 02:42:18.985]  And if it brings down America or challenges America, creates chaos, reduces our power, the globalists step in.
[02:42:19.005 --> 02:42:20.486]  And the same, exactly.
[02:42:20.606 --> 02:42:25.369]  The more there's a global crisis, the more they get power, whether it's disease, migration, Islam, whatever it is.
[02:42:25.889 --> 02:42:28.771]  And if you pull back from that and look at what's happening everywhere,
[02:42:29.791 --> 02:42:32.474]  Uh, the globalists, again, want to end the nation-state.
[02:42:32.854 --> 02:42:35.256]  They want to be able to play everybody else off against each other.
[02:42:35.317 --> 02:42:37.919]  And the good news is, the public is resenting it.
[02:42:38.219 --> 02:42:39.661]  The public is resisting it.
[02:42:39.681 --> 02:42:43.064]  Uh, and so that, that's why I really think they're starting to lose.
[02:42:43.384 --> 02:42:45.626]  Well, I do too, and I think losing in a lot of fronts.
[02:42:46.207 --> 02:42:47.728]  And I think this is the beginning of the end.
[02:42:47.788 --> 02:42:51.352]  Even, we see this Russian collusion by the time it gets down to this.
[02:42:52.152 --> 02:42:52.853]  That's my next question.
[02:42:52.873 --> 02:42:55.915]  I want to get into Google, but I don't just put good face on things.
[02:42:55.935 --> 02:42:59.477]  They've had David Brock and Media Matters and Washington Post.
[02:42:59.497 --> 02:43:01.038]  Everybody else say Jones is insane.
[02:43:01.518 --> 02:43:05.681]  You know, he doubled down and said that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:43:05.701 --> 02:43:07.302]  deserves a medal, and then they misrepresented.
[02:43:07.322 --> 02:43:09.904]  They said that I said he went to see if she was a spy.
[02:43:09.964 --> 02:43:16.008]  No, I said he went to get dirt on the spy Hillary, which his dad said a month later in July of last year.
[02:43:16.448 --> 02:43:18.330]  If you've got the evidence, Russia, release it.
[02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:19.831]  Hillary committed the crime.
[02:43:20.131 --> 02:43:21.732]  She's got the emails illegally.
[02:43:22.232 --> 02:43:23.433]  I don't care where it comes from.
[02:43:23.473 --> 02:43:26.776]  Again, if Russia knew where kidnapped kids were, shouldn't they release the info?
[02:43:26.816 --> 02:43:30.959]  If Russia knows where lightning's gonna strike next, they should release it, since they're so magical.
[02:43:31.259 --> 02:43:38.684]  But as he said, whether it's the Chinese, some guy in his bed at home, probably what it was, or whoever, you need to release this information.
[02:43:38.944 --> 02:43:43.387]  See, but they didn't go after him for that, because he did it out in the open and had the moral high ground.
[02:43:43.568 --> 02:43:45.089]  They want to project and act like,
[02:43:46.069 --> 02:43:47.851]  That Junior did something wrong.
[02:43:47.931 --> 02:43:53.435]  I'm not saying give him a medal to double down and do some Jedi mind trick and act like it's no big deal.
[02:43:53.495 --> 02:44:01.101]  I've seen some stalwart conservatives run the headlines, you know, from Bloomberg with, oh, conservatives look like idiots now.
[02:44:01.361 --> 02:44:03.362]  Boy, they, you know, Trump's really been proven wrong.
[02:44:03.723 --> 02:44:03.963]  No!
[02:44:04.523 --> 02:44:04.843]  No!
[02:44:05.023 --> 02:44:07.005]  They were always looking into her Russia connections.
[02:44:07.205 --> 02:44:08.165]  They should be!
[02:44:08.486 --> 02:44:13.329]  Hillary had the fake dossier of the PP gate, trying to get stuff from Russians.
[02:44:13.509 --> 02:44:14.850]  Does that make her a Russian agent?
[02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:16.991]  Because she's going around investigating Trump and Russia?
[02:44:17.351 --> 02:44:17.672]  No!
[02:44:17.932 --> 02:44:20.794]  But when she sold our uranium out, that does!
[02:44:21.634 --> 02:44:31.984]  And Podesta, who we documented had stalked from this company J-O-U-L-E, Joe Lee, through a money laundering front that Russia set up in the Netherlands.
[02:44:32.024 --> 02:44:33.485]  That's not being investigated.
[02:44:33.505 --> 02:44:33.985]  None of it is.
[02:44:34.005 --> 02:44:37.669]  What about this woman's at these Soros rallies and hanging out with the Russian ambassador?
[02:44:37.689 --> 02:44:38.950]  She got caught lying about that.
[02:44:39.891 --> 02:44:42.193]  Obama let her in without a visa.
[02:44:42.473 --> 02:44:44.355]  Sounds like she's some type of Soros operative.
[02:44:44.395 --> 02:44:45.976]  It sounds like it was a setup.
[02:44:46.937 --> 02:44:50.038]  Honey Trap kind of set up to get Donald Trump Jr.
[02:44:50.439 --> 02:44:53.780]  to take a meeting and then have the meeting on false pretenses.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.921]  He didn't himself know what the meeting was really going to be about.
[02:44:57.441 --> 02:44:58.982]  And it was a set up from the beginning.
[02:44:59.022 --> 02:45:00.403]  This was a bait and switch.
[02:45:00.443 --> 02:45:01.863]  He thought he was getting intel on the Clintons.
[02:45:02.224 --> 02:45:03.184]  All he got was the set up.
[02:45:03.564 --> 02:45:05.805]  And, you know, all of Hillary's meetings.
[02:45:05.825 --> 02:45:07.206]  She had meetings with the Chinese.
[02:45:07.646 --> 02:45:10.147]  They had meetings continuously with the Russians.
[02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:12.188]  None of this is being investigated.
[02:45:12.268 --> 02:45:14.329]  It's completely Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:45:14.349 --> 02:45:16.370]  And I think the American public is tired of it.
[02:45:16.390 --> 02:45:16.950]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:20.071]  We're not up here saying Trump turned the corner on this months ago, just to say it.
[02:45:20.351 --> 02:45:21.212]  He's dominating.
[02:45:21.512 --> 02:45:23.173]  His real poll numbers are 65.
[02:45:24.053 --> 02:45:24.913]  That's been proven.
[02:45:25.214 --> 02:45:26.974]  He's devastating the globalists.
[02:45:27.034 --> 02:45:29.535]  The problem is the Republican leadership is blocking
[02:45:30.896 --> 02:45:34.479]  Rand Paul, who's the patriot, says the Senate wants to keep Obamacare now.
[02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:36.260]  They've had two different votes.
[02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:36.821]  Trump's right.
[02:45:36.861 --> 02:45:38.042]  He says just repeal the thing.
[02:45:38.282 --> 02:45:39.703]  Well, it starts with Priebus.
[02:45:39.743 --> 02:45:40.344]  What do we got?
[02:45:40.784 --> 02:45:43.586]  Rens Priebus, still in the White House as chief of staff.
[02:45:43.606 --> 02:45:45.388]  Trump wants to know why he's got so many leaks.
[02:45:45.948 --> 02:45:47.569]  Why the White House is a sieve.
[02:45:47.909 --> 02:45:52.372]  Why Congress is going to pass basically Democrat-lite legislation.
[02:45:52.672 --> 02:45:53.932]  Look to Reince Priebus.
[02:45:54.353 --> 02:45:55.353]  He's where it starts.
[02:45:55.393 --> 02:45:56.194]  He's not loyal.
[02:45:56.514 --> 02:45:57.654]  He never supported Trump.
[02:45:57.995 --> 02:46:01.536]  And he's really supporting a GOP-lite agenda that Trump has.
[02:46:01.576 --> 02:46:03.978]  Well, he's got to know Lewandowski and people, definitely.
[02:46:03.998 --> 02:46:06.939]  My little birds told me where these emails were coming from.
[02:46:09.521 --> 02:46:15.523]  I think it's time for a complete change in the White House personnel from the top.
[02:46:16.043 --> 02:46:19.004]  Well notice, every time he goes on offense, everybody loves it and he wins.
[02:46:19.505 --> 02:46:22.546]  Every time he tries to work with these rats, they're not going to work with him.
[02:46:22.566 --> 02:46:23.386]  They're not going to work.
[02:46:23.406 --> 02:46:24.647]  They had seized the country.
[02:46:25.427 --> 02:46:28.128]  They want to squat on us and pee on us.
[02:46:28.168 --> 02:46:28.969]  They don't want to help.
[02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:38.660]  And Reince Priebus from the beginning has been one of the most negative influences trying to convince Trump to go with an agenda that Trump didn't get elected on.
[02:46:39.181 --> 02:46:44.908]  It's time for Reince to go and other Hillary and Obama loyalists in the White House.
[02:46:45.248 --> 02:46:46.750]  One word, purge.
[02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:48.793]  We need a peaceful night of the long knives.
[02:46:48.993 --> 02:46:50.673]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:46:50.733 --> 02:46:52.734]  And Donald Trump's got to understand this is Washington.
[02:46:52.774 --> 02:46:58.855]  Rule number one in Washington is everybody lies to you from the very beginning, including Rens Prebys.
[02:46:59.215 --> 02:47:01.295]  He's gotten no legislation through Congress.
[02:47:01.676 --> 02:47:03.896]  He's had no stopping a leaks in the White House.
[02:47:04.256 --> 02:47:06.437]  Why do we have Rens Prebys in the White House?
[02:47:07.377 --> 02:47:14.438]  It's to me, Donald Trump's got to wake up and he's got to get loyalists like he had in New York, supporting him in his corporation.
[02:47:14.458 --> 02:47:14.978]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:47:15.038 --> 02:47:15.898]  He's winning now.
[02:47:16.358 --> 02:47:18.379]  They will destroy him if he doesn't purge him.
[02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:24.704]  It's a battle for the presidency because the left wants to impeach Donald Trump.
[02:47:24.744 --> 02:47:27.386]  The left wants to think they can remove him from office.
[02:47:27.886 --> 02:47:31.849]  They're promoting Pence saying, oh, everybody would rather have Pence as president.
[02:47:32.189 --> 02:47:32.590]  Why?
[02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:34.251]  Oh, that's, I mean, it's the Boston Globe.
[02:47:34.271 --> 02:47:34.952]  Let's put it behind us.
[02:47:35.452 --> 02:47:35.832]  I don't know.
[02:47:54.921 --> 02:47:57.403]  Yeah, and then they're going to go after Pence for his religion.
[02:47:57.423 --> 02:48:02.788]  They're going to go after Pence for all... They only promote Pence because they want to get rid of Trump.
[02:48:02.808 --> 02:48:04.489]  Do you think Pence is smart enough to get that?
[02:48:04.689 --> 02:48:08.112]  Oh, Pence is... Pence... I've known Pence for a long time.
[02:48:08.612 --> 02:48:09.853]  Pence is loyal to Trump.
[02:48:10.434 --> 02:48:13.736]  He's on mission... So these fundraiser meetings he's making are to help Trump?
[02:48:13.756 --> 02:48:14.717]  They're to help Trump.
[02:48:15.498 --> 02:48:19.501]  Pence is doing nothing that isn't approved by... I mean, I tend to like Pence.
[02:48:19.621 --> 02:48:21.703]  I don't get a bad feeling about him, and my gut's always right.
[02:48:21.863 --> 02:48:24.386]  I saw Pence maybe a month ago.
[02:48:24.446 --> 02:48:26.769]  We had a very nice little short conversation.
[02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:29.533]  He says he's following everything we're doing, by the way.
[02:48:29.553 --> 02:48:30.434]  Let's not get him in trouble.
[02:48:30.454 --> 02:48:31.055]  Let's not say anything.
[02:48:31.075 --> 02:48:31.856]  Let's not say that.
[02:48:31.896 --> 02:48:32.397]  But at any rate...
[02:48:33.843 --> 02:48:37.465]  The point about Pence is he is who he says he is.
[02:48:37.565 --> 02:48:38.645]  He is a loyalist.
[02:48:39.206 --> 02:48:41.727]  But clearly there are forces trying to manipulate his camp.
[02:48:41.927 --> 02:48:45.188]  They want to divide Trump and Pence.
[02:48:45.749 --> 02:48:47.770]  Just like they want to get rid of Bannon.
[02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:50.391]  Just like they want to stop us with press credentials.
[02:48:50.431 --> 02:48:52.532]  Just like they want to stop and get rid of Donald Jr.
[02:48:52.552 --> 02:48:53.152]  Let me just say this.
[02:48:53.452 --> 02:48:54.853]  This isn't a butt-kissing activity.
[02:48:55.513 --> 02:48:56.834]  He is a force on Twitter.
[02:48:58.855 --> 02:49:04.138]  Anyone who's going to support Donald Trump becomes an immediate enemy to this... Look what they've done to us!
[02:49:04.638 --> 02:49:05.238]  Precisely.
[02:49:05.638 --> 02:49:06.859]  But it's good!
[02:49:06.899 --> 02:49:08.159]  People think they see us getting attacked.
[02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:09.400]  It's good!
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:12.782]  We've never, except for the week of the election, had this many listeners.
[02:49:13.122 --> 02:49:14.242]  I mean, I cannot believe it.
[02:49:14.342 --> 02:49:18.704]  Our numbers... In fact, I want to do a video the next few days showing our Facebook, Twitter, and InfoWars numbers.
[02:49:18.804 --> 02:49:20.385]  It is redonkulous.
[02:49:20.925 --> 02:49:21.906]  And the point is...
[02:49:23.177 --> 02:49:30.141]  This is, you've created here with InfoWars, the most disruptive news service in the world, with a huge following.
[02:49:30.501 --> 02:49:33.503]  Because middle America is not buying this globalist nonsense.
[02:49:33.964 --> 02:49:37.386]  Middle America is not buying- And by disruptive, we mean disrupting their agenda like Trump does.
[02:49:37.466 --> 02:49:38.726]  Disruptive positively.
[02:49:39.107 --> 02:49:41.648]  In other words, exposing the globalist agenda.
[02:49:42.048 --> 02:49:47.852]  Making the middle America aware that this is a, you know, a plan for the very rich to get more rich.
[02:49:48.392 --> 02:49:50.774]  It has nothing to do with, to destroy America,
[02:49:51.454 --> 02:49:53.015]  The Constitution is in their way.
[02:49:53.115 --> 02:49:54.616]  Donald Trump is in their way.
[02:49:55.257 --> 02:49:56.237]  I'm betting on Trump.
[02:49:56.297 --> 02:50:01.901]  I still... Because they like running it as a committee and they like making people poor in their own policy papers.
[02:50:01.981 --> 02:50:02.922]  This is the whole point.
[02:50:03.042 --> 02:50:04.643]  If we can segue into this Google story.
[02:50:04.663 --> 02:50:05.263]  We've got to go to break.
[02:50:05.283 --> 02:50:05.804]  Let's come back.
[02:50:05.824 --> 02:50:06.964]  We'll have two more segments with that.
[02:50:07.004 --> 02:50:07.985]  Then Roger Stone's coming in.
[02:50:08.005 --> 02:50:09.886]  And if he wants you in here, you can expand on that.
[02:50:09.906 --> 02:50:11.607]  You're going to be here tomorrow with us as well.
[02:50:11.648 --> 02:50:12.328]  Dr. Corsi's here.
[02:50:12.348 --> 02:50:16.491]  You're taping with top JFK experts and big pieces that are a warning to Trump.
[02:50:16.791 --> 02:50:18.672]  JFK 2.0 coming up.
[02:50:18.692 --> 02:50:19.633]  We're going to air that next week.
[02:50:19.773 --> 02:50:20.714]  They're taping that today.
[02:50:21.594 --> 02:50:24.958]  Before we go any further, free shipping the month of July, we need your financial support.
[02:50:24.998 --> 02:50:30.403]  We may have record audience, but this economy and everything else, we're not having record sales.
[02:50:30.423 --> 02:50:33.086]  I mean, they're pretty good, but that's enough to keep us going.
[02:50:33.186 --> 02:50:41.714]  I want to expand, so get some DNA Force, get the free shipping, get the MycoZX back in stock, the amazing cutting-edge probiotic that goes after the fungus.
[02:50:42.779 --> 02:50:43.119]  It's been...
[02:51:11.505 --> 02:51:12.906]  My friends, we have done it.
[02:51:13.546 --> 02:51:19.649]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:25.773]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[02:51:26.093 --> 02:51:32.316]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[02:51:32.516 --> 02:51:32.876]  Doctor?
[02:51:32.896 --> 02:51:34.457]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:51:34.838 --> 02:51:39.360]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:45.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[02:51:46.694 --> 02:51:47.255]  Thank you, Dr. Group.
[02:51:48.196 --> 02:51:50.598]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[02:51:51.099 --> 02:51:52.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[02:51:53.041 --> 02:51:53.802]  This is the move.
[02:51:53.842 --> 02:51:55.343]  This is unprecedented.
[02:51:55.363 --> 02:51:58.086]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[02:51:58.386 --> 02:51:58.947]  Oh my God!
[02:51:59.147 --> 02:51:59.787]  What the hell?
[02:52:00.028 --> 02:52:00.728]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[02:52:00.748 --> 02:52:01.689]  Get out of here!
[02:52:01.709 --> 02:52:02.230]  Shut this down!
[02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:03.051]  This is not safe!
[02:52:03.291 --> 02:52:04.052]  This is not... Hold on!
[02:52:04.312 --> 02:52:04.692]  Settle down!
[02:52:05.533 --> 02:52:06.293]  Get another doctor.
[02:52:06.313 --> 02:52:06.914]  Something's wrong.
[02:52:07.154 --> 02:52:07.814]  Something's wrong with him.
[02:52:07.854 --> 02:52:08.354]  Help him.
[02:52:08.374 --> 02:52:10.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[02:52:10.495 --> 02:52:11.355]  I take it personally.
[02:52:11.596 --> 02:52:12.736]  Do not have those problems.
[02:52:13.396 --> 02:52:15.917]  Again, these are authorized herbs.
[02:52:16.297 --> 02:52:18.358]  Well known to be safe.
[02:52:18.558 --> 02:52:19.559]  Please, doctor.
[02:52:19.959 --> 02:52:20.799]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[02:52:20.999 --> 02:52:23.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut to commercial for just a moment.
[02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:24.581]  Cut, cut, cut.
[02:52:24.621 --> 02:52:29.203]  Get everybody out of here.
[02:52:29.943 --> 02:52:31.143]  Super male vitality.
[02:52:31.724 --> 02:52:32.324]  It's awesome.
[02:52:32.804 --> 02:52:34.585]  Just not this awesome.
[02:52:37.011 --> 02:52:39.735]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[02:52:40.296 --> 02:52:46.305]  It is satire to illustrate, in a satirical way, the incredible power of supermale vitality.
[02:52:47.441 --> 02:52:55.488]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[02:52:55.968 --> 02:52:59.972]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:59.992 --> 02:53:03.355]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[02:53:03.375 --> 02:53:04.856]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[02:53:04.876 --> 02:53:05.857]  It takes some focus.
[02:53:06.618 --> 02:53:07.899]  Up, up, and away!
[02:53:15.490 --> 02:53:19.272]  Securing super male and super female vitality has never been easier.
[02:53:19.593 --> 02:53:23.755]  Because in the month of July, it's 30% off and free shipping.

[02:54:10.415 --> 02:54:10.855]  Alyssa.
[02:54:13.177 --> 02:54:13.597]  Brad.
[02:54:13.957 --> 02:54:14.277]  Cody.
[02:54:16.059 --> 02:54:16.539]  Marina.
[02:54:16.599 --> 02:54:17.880]  No, I pronounced everything wrong.
[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:20.101]  Everybody holding for more than an hour now.
[02:54:20.141 --> 02:54:20.741]  I have a rule.
[02:54:21.462 --> 02:54:25.584]  He either gets a bottle of X2 or Rain Force or a free t-shirt.
[02:54:26.005 --> 02:54:27.045]  And I hate doing this to you, Scott.
[02:54:27.065 --> 02:54:28.586]  That's why you got to remind me the callers are there.
[02:54:28.606 --> 02:54:30.287]  Because I hate doing this to Scott.
[02:54:30.307 --> 02:54:31.668]  He's got to get their addresses and info.
[02:54:31.688 --> 02:54:32.549]  But we send it out.
[02:54:33.314 --> 02:54:33.975]  And we're going to do it.
[02:54:34.515 --> 02:54:38.160]  So everybody there gets something of $25 value for holding for an hour.
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:38.981]  I apologize.
[02:54:39.781 --> 02:54:41.884]  I may have to try to just co-host with Roger Stone coming up.
[02:54:41.904 --> 02:54:43.366]  He gets all these calls or they can hang up.
[02:54:43.446 --> 02:54:46.950]  I got Alyssa wants to ask a question that I know you can answer as well.
[02:54:46.970 --> 02:54:47.831]  But let's get into Google.
[02:54:48.171 --> 02:54:50.514]  There's another article about Google today on Infowars.com.
[02:54:50.574 --> 02:54:53.717]  Soros Alliance of tech giants joins Pornhub.
[02:54:54.318 --> 02:54:56.339]  To create day of action protests.
[02:54:56.379 --> 02:54:57.380]  That's an article you wrote.
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:02.583]  Got another one here about Google expose reveals scam behind climate change.
[02:55:02.843 --> 02:55:04.724]  Professors get funding to push global warming.
[02:55:04.984 --> 02:55:05.845]  Well, of course they do.
[02:55:06.345 --> 02:55:07.846]  But I'm confused here.
[02:55:07.866 --> 02:55:08.086]  Yes.
[02:55:08.627 --> 02:55:14.670]  I mean, I know that the term net neutrality is a good thing, but the term they use means a federal takeover of it as a utility.
[02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:16.511]  So then they say we're for net neutrality.
[02:55:16.551 --> 02:55:20.053]  They mean FCC control over the Internet shutting us down.
[02:55:20.113 --> 02:55:22.255]  But then the big giants of Carlos Slim
[02:55:23.115 --> 02:55:23.335]  Right.
[02:55:23.435 --> 02:55:31.282]  And Bezos that owns the Washington Post and Warren Buffett, they all went to Congress and said, help us take over Google and make them promote our news.
[02:55:31.602 --> 02:55:36.186]  So the elite are fighting, Google's fighting, we know Google's picking winners and losers as well.
[02:55:36.866 --> 02:55:38.668]  It's just an orgy of confusion.
[02:55:38.708 --> 02:55:39.268]  What's going on?
[02:55:39.308 --> 02:55:39.849]  Well, okay.
[02:55:39.949 --> 02:55:44.273]  First of all, Google has aligned with Soros and now with Pornhub.
[02:55:44.873 --> 02:55:48.816]  And they're trying to keep these net neutrality rules from the Obama era.
[02:55:48.856 --> 02:55:56.743]  Now net neutrality was an intentionally deceptive phrase that was coined in order to promote censorship.
[02:55:57.303 --> 02:55:58.364]  That's what the left does.
[02:55:58.845 --> 02:56:04.630]  The point is that the internet switching companies, the companies that plug you into the internet,
[02:56:06.060 --> 02:56:10.344]  Verizon, AT&T, your ISP, your Internet Service Provider.
[02:56:11.125 --> 02:56:14.748]  The net neutrality rules only apply to them.
[02:56:15.609 --> 02:56:19.052]  Which means they have to allow everybody to be switched equally.
[02:56:19.072 --> 02:56:21.054]  The Internet giants
[02:56:21.795 --> 02:56:26.458]  Like Google, Facebook, Pornhub, all the Soros fact.
[02:56:26.778 --> 02:56:29.479]  The net neutrality rules do not apply to them.
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:34.022]  Which means they're free to censor conservative content.
[02:56:34.382 --> 02:56:36.844]  And you can see Soros is like this.
[02:56:37.044 --> 02:56:38.825]  A lot of our content is on Pornhub.
[02:56:40.786 --> 02:56:41.106]  Right.
[02:56:41.246 --> 02:56:41.746]  I'm joking.
[02:56:42.106 --> 02:56:46.749]  Pornhub is one of the most filthy sites in the area.
[02:56:46.769 --> 02:56:48.229]  Horrible investigation you've been forced to do.
[02:56:48.709 --> 02:56:56.013]  You know, it's rape, violence to women, all the, you know, sexual deviant behavior.
[02:56:56.333 --> 02:57:01.576]  My issue is, they're trying to take the web over in the name of net neutrality.
[02:57:01.876 --> 02:57:04.737]  I think the Republican plan has some problems too.
[02:57:05.037 --> 02:57:06.878]  The point is, is that both plans look bad to me.
[02:57:06.918 --> 02:57:07.879]  Well, see, first of all,
[02:57:08.599 --> 02:57:25.269]  The basic point of Ajit Pai, who is now heading the FCC, is to say, he's going to say, look, number one, we want to get the major regulation of the Internet out of the FCC.
[02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:28.171]  We want to get it before the Federal Trade Commission.
[02:57:28.591 --> 02:57:30.913]  Now this is a very important issue because Google can be
[02:57:31.810 --> 02:57:38.235]  Eviscerated and should be with antitrust regulations and antitrust investigations just like the EU.
[02:57:38.836 --> 02:57:51.326]  But Google wants to keep the regulation and Soros and Pornhub, their alliance buddy, want to keep the regulation of the FCC under net neutrality because that leaves them free to censor.
[02:57:51.946 --> 02:57:58.188]  And then force the ISPs to take their content as if it were equal to anyone else's.
[02:57:58.689 --> 02:58:03.850]  Pornhub says, well, you know, if we don't have net neutrality, you won't be able to watch your porn on an equal basis.
[02:58:04.431 --> 02:58:07.512]  Well, you know, so you won't be able to watch Google's porn either.
[02:58:07.532 --> 02:58:11.273]  I mean, Google's nonsense, edited, libertarian.
[02:58:11.293 --> 02:58:12.514]  Well, the issue is out.
[02:58:13.174 --> 02:58:17.555]  ISPs already throttle whatever internet connection you've got.
[02:58:17.635 --> 02:58:18.976]  I mean, you're already getting throttled.
[02:58:19.056 --> 02:58:23.839]  Well, and the point is, the internet providers have got to provide on an equal basis to everyone.
[02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:24.579]  That's fine.
[02:58:24.759 --> 02:58:26.320]  Sure, but what about the bigger issue?
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:29.222]  I'm sure you saw this in the news on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:58:30.182 --> 02:58:39.448]  You got the big rich billionaire owner of newspapers all running, asking the government to make them, to make Google force-feed their garbage.
[02:58:39.508 --> 02:58:41.669]  It sounds like what Soros wanted last year in WikiLeaks.
[02:58:41.829 --> 02:58:43.972]  It's all a censorship initiative.
[02:58:44.032 --> 02:58:50.119]  Let's talk about when we come back in 70 seconds because I try to figure this out and it's confusing as is.
[02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:53.302]  We'll be right back with the third hour, fourth hour.
[02:58:54.048 --> 02:58:58.271]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[02:59:56.026 --> 03:00:01.969]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.092 --> 03:00:08.153]  We are, we are, we're back live.
[03:00:09.088 --> 03:00:10.989]  We got a long way to go.
[03:00:11.009 --> 03:00:12.270]  It's show time to get there!
[03:00:14.411 --> 03:00:15.151]  Black Max 10.
[03:00:15.211 --> 03:00:16.252]  I'm from New York City.
[03:00:18.493 --> 03:00:21.774]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[03:00:21.874 --> 03:00:23.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.676 --> 03:00:28.638]  All right.
[03:00:28.898 --> 03:00:30.078]  I've studied both sides of this.
[03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:32.560]  I agree that Obama's net neutrality push
[03:00:33.786 --> 03:00:36.530]  Openly was a takeover of the internet, censorship control.
[03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:47.905]  We know Google, we know Facebook, we know Twitter, with their mods, with their systems, are already censoring libertarian patriot, pro-Trump, pro-gun, pro-Christian, or critical of Islam information.
[03:00:47.945 --> 03:00:48.245]  We know!
[03:00:48.626 --> 03:00:50.247]  They're censoring, they have no moral high ground.
[03:00:50.567 --> 03:00:51.408]  I get your point.
[03:00:51.828 --> 03:00:58.331]  And I get that regular ISPs and smaller ones, they're not allowed to throttle back info or even micro-censor.
[03:00:58.631 --> 03:00:59.712]  The big boys are.
[03:01:00.072 --> 03:01:06.556]  And so there's a fight going on with the big giants, but they pretty much are in agreement they want to start censoring people more.
[03:01:06.856 --> 03:01:07.937]  So navigate this for me.
[03:01:07.957 --> 03:01:11.098]  You've written a bunch of articles about it just today on InfoWars.com.
[03:01:11.218 --> 03:01:13.079]  It comes down to this.
[03:01:13.139 --> 03:01:15.541]  There are switches that plug you into the internet.
[03:01:16.101 --> 03:01:20.022]  So Verizon is an internet service provider, AT&T, there's many of them.
[03:01:20.742 --> 03:01:26.384]  The net neutrality rules only apply to them, saying you've got to handle everybody's content equally.
[03:01:26.884 --> 03:01:27.525]  Got to be fair.
[03:01:28.105 --> 03:01:31.706]  Okay, now when it comes to the big content providers,
[03:01:32.466 --> 03:01:35.047]  Like Google, which is not an internet service provider.
[03:01:35.067 --> 03:01:36.247]  It's a content provider.
[03:01:36.667 --> 03:01:38.628]  Net neutrality doesn't apply to them.
[03:01:38.948 --> 03:01:39.708]  They can censor.
[03:01:40.208 --> 03:01:44.309]  And now they're aligning with Pornhub because it's the porn industry.
[03:01:44.349 --> 03:01:54.272]  And that's the biggest porn site, and they're the ones, like Matt was saying during the break, one of our producers, they got HDDVD to fail with Blu-ray, I guess because the porn community liked Blu-ray.
[03:01:54.472 --> 03:01:54.912]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:01:56.132 --> 03:02:02.979]  We've got Soros embracing the porn community in order to keep his net neutrality rules in place so that they can censor.
[03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:04.780]  Okay, that's the problem.
[03:02:05.661 --> 03:02:13.428]  And it's not net neutrality because, you know, censorship is... I mean, I understand we should just have a flat deal that, you know, nobody throttles content.
[03:02:14.349 --> 03:02:17.833]  But then they say, well, if it violates terms of services, and they say... See, the point is,
[03:02:18.893 --> 03:02:30.979]  The censorship that Google is doing, because of its giant size, they want to institutionalize with these rules so they will forever be able to be in charge of what's allowed to be printed on the internet and not.
[03:02:31.419 --> 03:02:32.519]  That's the whole point of Netflix.
[03:02:32.539 --> 03:02:34.160]  And that's what Soros says in the WikiLeaks.
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:40.383]  He says once the UN runs things, that's why Europe's going after Google, is to intimidate them into more censorship.
[03:02:40.603 --> 03:02:48.755]  And they're bringing the porn community in because the porn community is a very big community and Google doesn't mind associating with the porn community.
[03:02:48.775 --> 03:02:49.236]  Come on!
[03:02:49.556 --> 03:02:55.645]  They're all gonna censor, they're all gonna produce content that's, you know, distasteful to a vast majority.
[03:02:56.466 --> 03:03:02.691]  And they're also clever on picking phrases like net neutrality, which sound like you ought to be in favor of it, until you realize... No, I understand the waterfront.
[03:03:02.711 --> 03:03:05.714]  There's a bunch of power groups trying to take over the internet right now.
[03:03:17.463 --> 03:03:24.065]  Why did Obama and the globalists transfer power of our system to the UN and a multinational directorate?
[03:03:24.145 --> 03:03:30.827]  And when you've got Google, and Soros, and Facebook... I know, but they've transferred it into this no-man's land, and now there's the fight to take it over.
[03:03:30.967 --> 03:03:33.408]  Okay, but look at how it shapes up.
[03:03:33.908 --> 03:03:39.790]  Google, Soros, Facebook, Twitter, Pornhub, all on the side of net neutrality.
[03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:41.370]  It's got to say there's something wrong here.
[03:03:41.871 --> 03:03:42.731]  That's censorship.
[03:03:43.311 --> 03:03:48.513]  Wait, whereas you've got Agent Pi, Trump, saying let's repeal the Obama rules.
[03:03:48.573 --> 03:03:50.414]  No more... We definitely want to go back to the way it was.
[03:03:50.454 --> 03:03:55.256]  We want to repeal the Obama, turn it into a public utility, give it to everybody free.
[03:03:55.316 --> 03:03:56.717]  That way it's not free, they control it.
[03:03:56.857 --> 03:04:02.879]  And regulate it through the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, which can begin applying anti-trust on... Sure.
[03:04:02.899 --> 03:04:04.860]  Let me ask you this in 60 seconds.
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:11.303]  What do you make of the Federal Elections Commission trying to claim we're Russian agents and wanting to haul us before Congress?
[03:04:11.363 --> 03:04:17.387]  Well, the Federal Election Commission's also wanting, these are the Democratic members of the FEC, and they also want to investigate Drudge.
[03:04:17.927 --> 03:04:20.669]  They want to investigate any Libertarian or any Conservative.
[03:04:20.689 --> 03:04:23.691]  But I mean, they're just outrageous Soviet-level dum-dums.
[03:04:23.912 --> 03:04:27.254]  Yes, but see, it's very... Hell, we don't need to be influenced by Russia, we've got you!
[03:04:27.734 --> 03:04:33.116]  If it were Hillary Clinton in office, there'd be an effort right now to shut down Drudge, shut down... Sure, we knew that.
[03:04:33.216 --> 03:04:35.337]  I just can't believe they climb out from under these rocks.
[03:04:35.417 --> 03:04:37.238]  And they're still in the FCC.
[03:04:37.438 --> 03:04:38.438]  They're not going to give up.
[03:04:38.858 --> 03:04:40.899]  It's why we've got to be able to fight back.
[03:04:41.159 --> 03:04:42.200]  We are fighting back.
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:43.500]  We're going to expand.
[03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:46.461]  We're going to be in a much bigger configuration.
[03:04:46.941 --> 03:04:50.383]  And that's going to be more threatening when... Well, we'll expand the list for those who keep supporting us.
[03:04:50.503 --> 03:04:51.023]  All right, Doc.
[03:04:51.483 --> 03:04:55.568]  We got Roger Stowe coming in to host from the InfoWars studio in the ATX.
[03:04:55.588 --> 03:04:56.990]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:58.592]  They're trying to censor the site.
[03:04:58.632 --> 03:05:00.214]  Please get the articles and videos and spread them.
[03:05:00.514 --> 03:05:02.197]  And our new video, Why Liberals Hate America.
[03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:06.352]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[03:05:07.233 --> 03:05:08.674]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[03:05:08.974 --> 03:05:09.975]  It is rampant out there.
[03:05:10.295 --> 03:05:11.836]  Here are some of its main exhibitors.
[03:05:12.757 --> 03:05:13.578]  Barack Obama.
[03:05:14.218 --> 03:05:20.743]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against.
[03:05:21.083 --> 03:05:22.084]  Washington fat cats.
[03:05:22.324 --> 03:05:23.685]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[03:05:23.866 --> 03:05:25.087]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[03:05:25.327 --> 03:05:30.672]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because of the healthcare bill he lied about.
[03:05:30.912 --> 03:05:32.073]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[03:05:32.253 --> 03:05:34.796]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[03:05:35.096 --> 03:05:40.121]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[03:05:41.201 --> 03:05:47.883]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[03:05:48.163 --> 03:05:57.225]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself, with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife, under investigation for bank fraud.
[03:05:57.345 --> 03:05:59.025]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.

[03:06:43.457 --> 03:06:55.939]  We're talking our non-nano zinc high-powered sunscreen along with Emrix Essentials bug spray that's totally organic and natural and works way better than chemical brands I've personally used.

[03:07:36.758 --> 03:07:42.724]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[03:08:15.518 --> 03:08:20.226]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:52.011 --> 03:08:55.032]  It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia.
[03:08:55.412 --> 03:08:56.612]  It is so far-fetched.
[03:08:56.712 --> 03:08:57.652]  It's so ridiculous.
[03:08:57.732 --> 03:08:59.133]  Honestly, I wish I had that power.
[03:09:00.333 --> 03:09:01.473]  I'd love to have that power.
[03:09:02.474 --> 03:09:05.194]  But Russia has no respect for our country.
[03:09:05.974 --> 03:09:09.035]  And that's why, if it is Russia, nobody even knows it's probably China.
[03:09:10.756 --> 03:09:12.336]  Or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.
[03:09:13.856 --> 03:09:15.917]  But it shows how weak we are.
[03:09:16.937 --> 03:09:19.859]  It shows how disrespected we are.
[03:09:20.639 --> 03:09:31.025]  Assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country.
[03:09:31.805 --> 03:09:38.329]  Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore, and they certainly have no respect for our leader.
[03:09:38.889 --> 03:09:40.110]  So I know nothing about it.
[03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:42.051]  It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.
[03:09:42.892 --> 03:09:44.234]  What do I have to get involved with Putin for?
[03:09:44.254 --> 03:09:45.255]  I have nothing to do with Putin.
[03:09:45.275 --> 03:09:46.317]  I've never spoken to him.
[03:09:46.377 --> 03:09:48.860]  I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
[03:09:49.321 --> 03:09:57.091]  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.
[03:09:58.072 --> 03:10:01.895]  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
[03:10:02.735 --> 03:10:06.137]  Now, why wasn't that a big issue last year?
[03:10:06.237 --> 03:10:10.640]  Because he was out in the open, she committed the crime, she had the illegal servers, she had the missing emails.
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:12.862]  He said, I don't know who has it, but whoever has it...
[03:10:13.542 --> 03:10:19.366]  Just go ahead and release the information, because she's the one that's committed the crimes.
[03:10:19.386 --> 03:10:31.655]  But somehow, they've turned all this around, Roger, where his son, a month earlier, has a meeting to see if she's a Russian spy, and people just act like that's us colluding with the Russians, when that's what we do, is interface with all these governments.
[03:10:31.675 --> 03:10:33.577]  That's all the proof they've got.
[03:10:33.617 --> 03:10:38.521]  I know I've been harping on this quite a bit, but I tell you, I think this is the last gasp here.
[03:10:39.221 --> 03:10:46.651]  Well, as you know, Alex, the president, then candidate Trump, was very widely criticized for that particular comment.
[03:10:46.791 --> 03:10:55.161]  Frankly, I thought it was brilliant because it underlined again that Hillary Clinton had some 33,000 emails that were completely missing.
[03:10:55.871 --> 03:10:58.374]  That have disappeared.
[03:10:58.394 --> 03:10:59.915]  And I think he made a key point.
[03:11:00.396 --> 03:11:04.720]  The President's been very consistent about the fact that there probably was hacking in this election.
[03:11:05.301 --> 03:11:11.007]  By the Saudis, the Chinese, the Israelis, the Russians, the North Koreans, God knows how many.
[03:11:11.027 --> 03:11:12.008]  It was a total free-for-all.
[03:11:12.228 --> 03:11:12.988]  There's no question.
[03:11:13.728 --> 03:11:19.250]  But that doesn't mean that there was any effective collusion between the Russian state and the Trump campaign.
[03:11:19.790 --> 03:11:21.490]  This literally did not exist.
[03:11:22.050 --> 03:11:34.073]  What this really is, more than anything else, of course, is a pathetic excuse for the fact that Hillary Clinton had all these huge institutional, financial, built-in advantages, and she still lost.
[03:11:34.173 --> 03:11:38.834]  That's right, and I don't see this ever working, unless the Trumps
[03:11:39.853 --> 03:11:40.253]  Bye bye.
[03:11:55.348 --> 03:11:56.349]  Infowars.com.
[03:11:56.409 --> 03:11:57.270]  It needs to go viral.
[03:11:57.571 --> 03:12:06.200]  Turns out she photographed herself at Trump Tower repeatedly protesting as an anti-Trumper with Linda Sarsour-Hajib garbage, showing she's hooked in with Soros.
[03:12:06.501 --> 03:12:07.902]  She met with the Russian ambassador.
[03:12:07.922 --> 03:12:08.903]  There's information on that.
[03:12:09.204 --> 03:12:13.488]  She overstayed her visa six months and was allowed to come back into the country.
[03:12:13.508 --> 03:12:15.591]  A lot of signs here she's a Soros cutout.
[03:12:15.971 --> 03:12:19.334]  You know, this is where I think InfoWars has been out ahead of everybody else.
[03:12:20.175 --> 03:12:22.197]  This is smelling more and more like a setup.
[03:12:22.457 --> 03:12:26.361]  This is smelling more and more like entrapment, where Don Jr.
[03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:29.063]  is only trying to do the right thing by his father's campaign.
[03:12:29.684 --> 03:12:37.031]  I've been in ten presidential campaigns, Alex, and when someone contacts you and says, I have devastating information of wrongdoing by your opponent,
[03:12:37.651 --> 03:12:38.732]  And you don't meet with them.
[03:12:39.292 --> 03:12:40.272]  That's malpractice.
[03:12:40.933 --> 03:12:47.917]  It's the accuracy and the documentability of the information that's important, not the source.
[03:12:48.797 --> 03:12:51.519]  Well, they've never had anything Russian.
[03:12:51.919 --> 03:12:55.621]  And then, I mean, you've got the Clintons meeting with the Russians, selling out uranium.
[03:12:56.001 --> 03:12:57.462]  You've got a meeting with the Communist Chinese.
[03:12:57.522 --> 03:13:00.944]  I mean, it's a free-for-all of them selling people out.
[03:13:02.004 --> 03:13:09.714]  And again, I think the Republicans should be less apologetic and Trump should be going after the Republican leadership.
[03:13:10.434 --> 03:13:12.076]  I'm going to get out of here soon and let you host the hour.
[03:13:12.096 --> 03:13:13.899]  You're not here visiting with us and working with Infowars.
[03:13:13.939 --> 03:13:17.663]  But doing a real prognosis on Trump.
[03:13:18.584 --> 03:13:20.885]  I think with what he's up against, he's over-delivered.
[03:13:21.585 --> 03:13:35.549]  You know, just seven months, six and a half months in, with the economy, with TPP, with the carbon taxes, with 60 plus percent of the illegals being down from last year, with thousands of companies moving back, hundreds of millions in new jobs.
[03:13:36.209 --> 03:13:42.451]  But if he could just get the tax cuts and just get Obamacare repealed, which he's pushing for, but being sabotaged by Republicans.
[03:13:42.471 --> 03:13:46.592]  So I think the bigger threat than MSM, because it's such a joke, and a bigger
[03:13:47.432 --> 03:13:48.456]  Threat of the Democratic Party?
[03:13:48.577 --> 03:13:51.709]  I think it's the Republicans and the moles and the leakers.
[03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.710]  I agree with you.
[03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:56.331]  I think, frankly, tax reform is the key.
[03:13:56.771 --> 03:14:02.613]  If he can get a real uplift in the economy between now and the 2018 election, then that thwarts their game plan.
[03:14:02.913 --> 03:14:04.714]  They want to take a majority in the House.
[03:14:04.754 --> 03:14:06.995]  Then it doesn't matter what Mueller puts forward.
[03:14:07.495 --> 03:14:09.556]  They will use it as a hook for impeachment.
[03:14:09.936 --> 03:14:10.996]  That's their game plan.
[03:14:11.356 --> 03:14:13.257]  That's the game plan we must defeat.
[03:14:13.777 --> 03:14:15.618]  And they know the Russian thing's not there, as they've said.
[03:14:15.638 --> 03:14:17.098]  It may take them a year, two years longer.
[03:14:17.118 --> 03:14:18.299]  And Mueller's saying,
[03:14:18.979 --> 03:14:23.446]  And they're standing him up like he's God, he's Christ, he's the arbiter of reality.
[03:14:23.906 --> 03:14:27.952]  They want that so they can again hopefully get the House and then bring down Trump.
[03:14:28.313 --> 03:14:34.181]  While he has the trifecta, and as you said Justice Kennedy, imminent retirement,
[03:14:35.416 --> 03:14:36.276]  What does he need to do?
[03:14:36.317 --> 03:14:38.678]  Well, I think he needs to go after the IRS and have hearings.
[03:14:39.018 --> 03:14:40.419]  He needs to go after Obama with hearings.
[03:14:40.439 --> 03:14:41.599]  He needs to go after Hillary with hearings.
[03:14:41.979 --> 03:14:43.180]  He needs to go after them.
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:52.805]  How dare them with the Muslim Brotherhood open the borders up and let the UN be under State Department control or the State Department or UN control and vet what refugees come here.
[03:14:53.145 --> 03:15:00.209]  He needs to take everything they're attacking on and turning it around because everything they attack on, religiously, is their weak points.
[03:15:00.549 --> 03:15:01.030]  They know.
[03:15:01.230 --> 03:15:02.252]  Oh, we're weak on Russia?
[03:15:02.292 --> 03:15:02.913]  Blame it on Trump.
[03:15:03.214 --> 03:15:04.736]  You know, they're weak on bringing in terrorists?
[03:15:04.836 --> 03:15:05.698]  Turn it around on Trump.
[03:15:05.938 --> 03:15:07.321]  He needs to get on the offensive.
[03:15:07.541 --> 03:15:10.666]  I think it should start with a criminal investigation of Linda Sarsour.
[03:15:11.550 --> 03:15:21.132]  Well, again, the Circa News stories of about a month ago, outlining how the FBI abused surveillance and wiretapping.
[03:15:21.572 --> 03:15:24.873]  I guess wiretapping is an outdated comment, but surveillance.
[03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:25.933]  Electronic surveillance.
[03:15:26.574 --> 03:15:29.354]  Of Americans, and how they accessed that data.
[03:15:29.694 --> 03:15:35.996]  To me, that's the greatest vulnerability of the left, the greatest vulnerability of the Obama gang.
[03:15:36.916 --> 03:15:53.567]  It's interesting because the Globe of Publications, which as you know is owned by the National Enquirer, has a terrific piece this week on how Hillary is tied to Mueller, how Hillary is tied to Comey, and how she has been orchestrating this effort to smear the President on Russia.
[03:15:53.987 --> 03:15:58.450]  Better reporting, by the way, than you'll ever find in the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[03:15:58.490 --> 03:15:59.690]  Well, I want you to get more into that.
[03:15:59.730 --> 03:16:01.592]  Let me just say this in closing for this segment.
[03:16:03.086 --> 03:16:08.049]  People in the media like to make a big deal out of my thought processes, and they constantly now misrepresent what I've said.
[03:16:08.169 --> 03:16:11.912]  I mean, it's just, you read something in the paper, you better go watch the actual clip.
[03:16:12.292 --> 03:16:15.454]  Because I said he was investigating Hillary for being a spy, he was doing his job.
[03:16:15.835 --> 03:16:21.819]  They turned it into, he was investigating Donald Jr., the Russian, to see if she was a spy.
[03:16:22.239 --> 03:16:25.021]  I mean, so they do everything to make it sound quirky, weird, crazy.
[03:16:25.041 --> 03:16:27.422]  Because if you actually tune in, you hear the common sense.
[03:16:29.162 --> 03:16:34.064]  Expanding on all this, the big controversy is the fact that the NSA is spying on everybody.
[03:16:34.284 --> 03:16:37.385]  But I want to explain my perspective and how my brain works.
[03:16:38.166 --> 03:16:44.108]  I used to get told like 10 years ago by people in big syndicated radio and others, hey Alex,
[03:16:44.508 --> 03:16:49.092]  You're left alone because they think the public are cowards, and they think you're doing the intimidation for them.
[03:16:49.492 --> 03:16:50.493]  Well, I didn't believe that.
[03:16:50.593 --> 03:16:55.238]  I thought if people knew how bad things were, they would get involved and wake up, because that's how I am.
[03:16:55.498 --> 03:16:57.379]  You tell me there's a problem, my house is on fire.
[03:16:57.700 --> 03:16:59.802]  I don't just give up, I try to put it out or get out of the house.
[03:17:00.522 --> 03:17:04.525]  And so I always just approach things from the truth, not the Machiavelli way.
[03:17:04.565 --> 03:17:08.728]  Now that I'm 43 years old, been through a lot, I can't help but be Machiavelli.
[03:17:08.768 --> 03:17:12.430]  I mean, I do things because they're right, but I can see the Machiavelli perspective.
[03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:18.774]  I never put good faces or bad faces on things to try to cheerlead or to create a hoax.
[03:17:19.334 --> 03:17:24.438]  I really went with what I thought was going on, just almost, you know, at a robotic level.
[03:17:25.475 --> 03:17:27.336]  Now I realize everything is hype.
[03:17:27.617 --> 03:17:29.898]  They know they're a horrible party, totally hated.
[03:17:29.938 --> 03:17:31.340]  They know they've been hated for decades.
[03:17:31.660 --> 03:17:32.841]  They know they're falling apart.
[03:17:33.201 --> 03:17:37.504]  They know their minions are the most alone, pathetic people that have fake bots as friends.
[03:17:37.745 --> 03:17:43.669]  That's in the Facebook documents that came out in Australia, where they target liberals, try to keep them desperate, try to keep them alone.
[03:17:44.210 --> 03:17:47.452]  I mean, it's so incredible that they know they're scum.
[03:17:47.552 --> 03:17:48.493]  They know they're hated.
[03:17:48.733 --> 03:17:53.417]  They know they're mercenaries working for these rich, inbred elites that are totally psychopathic and insane.
[03:17:53.977 --> 03:17:54.838]  And so that's the thing.
[03:17:54.858 --> 03:17:59.860]  When I get up here and say we're winning, globalists admit they're in free fall in their own internal publications.
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:01.821]  We really are kicking butt.
[03:18:01.841 --> 03:18:08.044]  It doesn't mean they can't get a stab at it and win, but overall they could destroy Trump, me, Roger Stone.
[03:18:08.484 --> 03:18:10.345]  They're not putting the genie back in the bottle.
[03:18:10.405 --> 03:18:11.866]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[03:18:12.206 --> 03:18:13.727]  Humanity wants prosperity.
[03:18:14.007 --> 03:18:16.048]  Globalism doesn't for the average person.
[03:18:16.288 --> 03:18:17.529]  And that's why it's dead on arrival.
[03:18:17.569 --> 03:18:18.729]  We'll skip this break for more time.
[03:18:19.249 --> 03:18:19.930]  And that's why.
[03:18:20.959 --> 03:18:25.862]  It's more important than ever that everyone out there watching and listening financially support us.
[03:18:25.882 --> 03:18:28.243]  Because I might plug a minute each hour.
[03:18:28.503 --> 03:18:32.345]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment because that's where the real advertising is.
[03:18:32.365 --> 03:18:33.826]  It isn't the breaks during the ads.
[03:18:33.886 --> 03:18:34.887]  You don't listen to most of those.
[03:18:35.107 --> 03:18:35.727]  Some of them are great.
[03:18:35.827 --> 03:18:36.568]  Sometimes you do.
[03:18:37.088 --> 03:18:38.289]  Mainly you listen to live plugs.
[03:18:38.569 --> 03:18:40.590]  Most people do them every segment.
[03:18:41.070 --> 03:18:42.891]  I could have sponsors every segment.
[03:18:43.031 --> 03:18:43.551]  I don't do it.
[03:18:43.911 --> 03:18:46.372]  I plug enough to fund things, but I want to expand.
[03:18:46.732 --> 03:18:48.752]  I'm hiring people, but I need more money.
[03:18:48.812 --> 03:18:49.893]  We got products you need.
[03:18:49.993 --> 03:18:55.594]  You need to stop bringing glyphosates and the hundreds of chemicals that run off on average, and even in well water, or tap water is worse.
[03:18:55.914 --> 03:18:57.295]  You need our gravity-fed systems.
[03:18:57.335 --> 03:18:57.995]  Four different brands.
[03:18:58.015 --> 03:18:58.695]  They're all excellent.
[03:18:58.955 --> 03:18:59.996]  They're apples and oranges.
[03:19:00.016 --> 03:19:03.717]  Some are better at this and better than that, but they all take stuff down to non-detectable or close to it.
[03:19:04.657 --> 03:19:05.458]  That's number one.
[03:19:05.538 --> 03:19:08.900]  You need our air filtration systems for your house, put out by Alexa Pure.
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:09.420]  They're excellent.
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:12.502]  You need DNA Force, back in stock, sold out almost six months.
[03:19:13.142 --> 03:19:21.708]  You need our amazing probiotics, 30% off when you get them, with the MycoZX, the Targets, what nobody else out there does, the Fungus, the Candida, the mold that's growing in your guts.
[03:19:22.208 --> 03:19:22.729]  It's all there.
[03:19:22.809 --> 03:19:28.693]  Stuff you need, then you help yourself, help your family, and fund the white hot sword of truth.
[03:19:29.074 --> 03:19:29.634]  Infowars.
[03:19:29.694 --> 03:19:31.255]  Store.com is the umbrella site.
[03:19:31.696 --> 03:19:33.457]  Infowarslive.com is the sub-site.
[03:19:33.737 --> 03:19:35.919]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:19:37.300 --> 03:19:39.862]  Get your CNN is fake news shirt on the back.
[03:19:39.962 --> 03:19:41.503]  Infowars.com is real news.
[03:19:41.944 --> 03:19:43.064]  Meet like-minded people.
[03:19:43.465 --> 03:19:44.546]  Stand up for free speech.
[03:19:44.646 --> 03:19:51.131]  It does so much to demoralize the enemy when they see Infowars.com stickers that every order gets stuck everywhere.
[03:19:51.952 --> 03:20:00.660]  When they see you wearing the shirts, and then they come over every once in a while if you're in a few of the blue state enclaves, they might get in your face, laugh back at them.
[03:20:01.021 --> 03:20:05.565]  When you don't fall like they do to treading disappear pressure, they piss themselves.
[03:20:05.605 --> 03:20:06.726]  Sorry for the French, it's true.
[03:20:07.187 --> 03:20:08.788]  It's all a peer pressure war.
[03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:15.352]  But as libertarians, as conservatives, as Christians, we don't ever instinctively care what others think.
[03:20:15.592 --> 03:20:16.792]  We have an internal compass.
[03:20:17.113 --> 03:20:23.996]  We have to realize everything they hit us with is a window into how weak they are and how they're fad-driven.
[03:20:24.396 --> 03:20:26.517]  And you've just got to understand, they'll walk over to my table.
[03:20:27.372 --> 03:20:28.493]  I still go to downtown Austin.
[03:20:28.733 --> 03:20:31.715]  When I go to libertarian or conservative areas, I get my food bought for me, literally.
[03:20:32.255 --> 03:20:42.262]  But when I go to liberal areas on purpose, every two or three times I go out to eat, you know, maybe once a month, it happens, they walk over, they go, boo, you're pathetic, everyone hates you, and the waiter hates you, and we hate you.
[03:20:42.643 --> 03:20:47.626]  And I go, good, I really love that, I know you're driven by peer pressure, and I think that gets to me, I'm not in junior high.
[03:20:47.646 --> 03:20:52.790]  In fact, I was kind of tired, I have some adrenaline now, thank you for coming over and reminding me how pathetic my opposition is.
[03:20:53.370 --> 03:20:55.472]  Then they literally don't know what, then try to shake my hand, I go, no.
[03:20:56.345 --> 03:20:56.786]  Get out of here.
[03:20:57.426 --> 03:20:59.168]  And they deflate.
[03:20:59.588 --> 03:21:02.892]  Because you have to understand, folks, these are the lowest of the low followers.
[03:21:03.212 --> 03:21:06.676]  We don't hate them, but in large numbers, these lemmings are dangerous.
[03:21:06.716 --> 03:21:07.196]  Roger Stone.
[03:21:07.457 --> 03:21:14.424]  You know, Alex, I remember just a couple weeks ago I was with you, we were walking through a hotel, and some Brit accosted you.
[03:21:14.724 --> 03:21:15.585]  Started screaming at you.
[03:21:15.605 --> 03:21:16.486]  He goes, you're traitors!
[03:21:16.506 --> 03:21:17.207]  You're Russians!
[03:21:18.328 --> 03:21:23.150]  First of all, this guy would have been speaking Russian, but for the United States of America and for patriots like us.
[03:21:23.930 --> 03:21:30.712]  But you're absolutely right about something else you said earlier, and that is the lies are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:21:31.132 --> 03:21:32.933]  They no longer feel restrained.
[03:21:32.993 --> 03:21:37.534]  They can say all kinds of things and put words in your mouth, things that you didn't say.
[03:21:37.995 --> 03:21:47.538]  Yesterday, on the first anniversary of Seth Rich's death, his parents yet again appealed to the public not to discuss this in any way and not to dig into it.
[03:21:48.098 --> 03:21:49.599]  I simply post this question.
[03:21:50.259 --> 03:21:57.703]  Am I the only one who finds it odd that Seth Rich's parents don't seem to have any interest whatsoever in knowing who killed their son?
[03:21:57.743 --> 03:21:58.704]  Well, I have a memory.
[03:21:58.864 --> 03:22:00.765]  They, at first, they were questioning.
[03:22:01.025 --> 03:22:02.045]  They were on the news.
[03:22:02.366 --> 03:22:06.448]  That's why I edited it with hashtag payoff question mark.
[03:22:07.290 --> 03:22:08.311]  I raised a question.
[03:22:08.731 --> 03:22:09.712]  Headline in Newsweek.
[03:22:10.132 --> 03:22:12.294]  Stone says rich parents paid off.
[03:22:12.634 --> 03:22:13.535]  I didn't say they were.
[03:22:13.915 --> 03:22:14.876]  I asked where they were.
[03:22:14.916 --> 03:22:16.077]  Well, it's more than that.
[03:22:16.157 --> 03:22:22.962]  I mean, take the wife who was on the National Security Council as a top aide to Michael Hastings, who we know was a cutout.
[03:22:23.002 --> 03:22:24.143]  He was in intelligence agencies.
[03:22:24.163 --> 03:22:26.485]  I'm not going to get into the details, but I've talked to folks that were there.
[03:22:27.085 --> 03:22:29.087]  And the people that were at the funeral, she's like, oh, they killed him.
[03:22:29.107 --> 03:22:29.927]  I'm going to get these bastards.
[03:22:30.448 --> 03:22:33.710]  A couple months later, she goes on Piers Morgan and says, he died completely natural.
[03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:34.191]  No big deal.
[03:22:34.211 --> 03:22:34.891]  Everybody go to sleep.
[03:22:35.372 --> 03:22:36.412]  They threaten people.
[03:22:36.452 --> 03:22:37.193]  It's not just payoff.
[03:22:37.673 --> 03:22:38.454]  That's possible.
[03:22:38.754 --> 03:22:44.396]  What I find interesting, though, about this whole thing is Seth Rich is not some low-level employee.
[03:22:44.696 --> 03:22:52.419]  He's the head of the division from which documents are stolen and they end up at- And the news calls him this young boy got shot, no big deal.
[03:22:52.439 --> 03:22:53.440]  So when he's murdered,
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:59.065]  For you not to question whether that's suspicious, it's a suspension of any common sense.
[03:22:59.445 --> 03:23:09.233]  No journalist in their right mind could not find this suspicious and see an obvious correlation between the stolen documents at the Democratic National Committee.
[03:23:09.694 --> 03:23:12.776]  We still need justice and the truth for Seth Ridge.
[03:23:13.337 --> 03:23:14.298]  I want you to take over.
[03:23:14.318 --> 03:23:15.018]  You've got a lot to cover.
[03:23:15.038 --> 03:23:15.639]  He hosted an hour.
[03:23:15.679 --> 03:23:16.980]  He did a great job there, an hour and a half.
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:19.242]  Look into your crystal ball long term.
[03:23:21.912 --> 03:23:27.835]  Are there any other little Russian tidbits or giblets that you've got?
[03:23:27.955 --> 03:23:31.317]  Because, you know, most of the stuff's off-record when we talk, some of it isn't.
[03:23:32.057 --> 03:23:37.560]  I mean, how much can we get into about what was known by folks about who may have met with who?
[03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:39.641]  I mean, we know it's all a nothing burger.
[03:23:40.021 --> 03:23:43.483]  Because you're saying this is the end of it, this is all they've got, unless it's totally manufactured.
[03:23:43.523 --> 03:23:45.744]  Is there any other shoes left to drop here, Roger?
[03:23:45.764 --> 03:23:49.486]  I have known about this allegation regarding Don Jr.
[03:23:49.526 --> 03:23:50.507]  for about 10 days.
[03:23:51.267 --> 03:23:59.756]  I had hoped that the White House would move proactively to put it out on the Friday before the holiday, which I think would have minimized the coverage of a nothing story.
[03:24:01.097 --> 03:24:09.967]  There is some question about the three White House advisors who were cited in the Washington Post story as being sources of the Post story.
[03:24:10.447 --> 03:24:16.969]  The overwhelming consensus inside Trump world is that Corey Lewandowski, who has an animus towards Don Jr.
[03:24:17.009 --> 03:24:17.889]  because Don Jr.
[03:24:17.929 --> 03:24:22.751]  helped remove him as the Trump campaign manager, is one of these sources.
[03:24:23.271 --> 03:24:25.772]  If that is true, it is despicable.
[03:24:26.292 --> 03:24:29.335]  To attack the President's family when Don Jr.
[03:24:29.415 --> 03:24:31.656]  has done nothing illegal or immoral.
[03:24:32.017 --> 03:24:34.959]  They're picking him, Alex, because he's a fan of Infowars.
[03:24:35.219 --> 03:24:36.580]  Because he's a warrior.
[03:24:36.841 --> 03:24:39.643]  Because he's not afraid to call out CNN as fake news.
[03:24:39.663 --> 03:24:46.128]  Because he's loyal to America and prosperity and Christianity and a free, open society.
[03:24:46.308 --> 03:24:47.509]  And he stands up for his father.
[03:24:47.749 --> 03:24:48.830]  He stands up for his family.
[03:24:49.090 --> 03:24:49.991]  There's something to admire.
[03:24:50.011 --> 03:24:53.314]  You know, I couldn't believe that they actually had a writer who was just Paul Kellen.
[03:24:54.668 --> 03:24:58.312]  Actually said, meeting Russians for dirt on Clinton, it may be immoral, but it's not illegal.
[03:24:58.372 --> 03:24:59.714]  It's not immoral, he deserves a medal.
[03:24:59.954 --> 03:25:08.543]  But unless the only article out of hundreds at CNN that admits it's not illegal, it's opposition research, what about Hillary's people meeting with a bunch of Russians looking for dirt?
[03:25:08.763 --> 03:25:09.784]  Why is she allowed to?
[03:25:10.444 --> 03:25:13.987]  Well, largely because the Republicans refuse to pick up that rock and throw it.
[03:25:14.467 --> 03:25:16.149]  That's the real, there's the real problem.
[03:25:16.169 --> 03:25:24.016]  Why are Republicans so intimidated by the knock-kneed, dweeby CNN, MSNBC?
[03:25:24.076 --> 03:25:25.837]  I mean, those people are jokes.
[03:25:26.198 --> 03:25:27.559]  They have almost no viewers.
[03:25:27.959 --> 03:25:32.083]  Every time they attack me, we get more listeners and revenue goes up.
[03:25:32.183 --> 03:25:35.385]  I mean, it's like, please, throw me in the briar patch.
[03:25:35.465 --> 03:25:37.167]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[03:25:37.327 --> 03:25:39.649]  I think a lot of them are living in the political past.
[03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:48.077]  I think a lot of them are living in the age when the mainstream media had a monopoly stranglehold on the dissemination of political information.
[03:25:48.917 --> 03:25:51.760]  And they still quake when they get the morning Washington Post.
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:53.482]  This morning's Washington Post
[03:25:54.862 --> 03:25:57.103]  It was like an Atlas and Wonderland experience.
[03:25:57.283 --> 03:25:59.164]  It's so far from the truth.
[03:25:59.184 --> 03:26:04.825]  Let me tell you, there were like four articles that I was in, and I just scanned them, and it was literally all lies.
[03:26:05.526 --> 03:26:06.446]  It was just made up.
[03:26:06.706 --> 03:26:07.486]  Just made up.
[03:26:07.526 --> 03:26:08.127]  Come on, Alex.
[03:26:08.187 --> 03:26:09.847]  Everybody knows you're funded by the Russians.
[03:26:09.867 --> 03:26:11.088]  They're paying for this whole thing.
[03:26:11.168 --> 03:26:11.988]  Everybody knows that.
[03:26:12.228 --> 03:26:14.929]  Plus all the bots that are passing your stuff.
[03:26:15.209 --> 03:26:17.450]  This is the most... Meanwhile, they're blocking us everywhere.
[03:26:17.530 --> 03:26:18.650]  They admittedly have bots.
[03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:20.991]  Hollywood, all the foreign governments against us.
[03:26:21.571 --> 03:26:30.135]  One of the things you pointed out early in the campaign is consistently, through this campaign, they have accused us of exactly what they're doing.
[03:26:30.935 --> 03:26:31.795]  It's systematic.
[03:26:32.396 --> 03:26:36.797]  They're the ones, David Brock and his ilk, are the ones using bots, smearing people.
[03:26:37.037 --> 03:26:37.778]  We don't do that.
[03:26:38.098 --> 03:26:38.818]  We're not doing that.
[03:26:38.838 --> 03:26:39.378]  You know how we know?
[03:26:39.398 --> 03:26:40.579]  Media matter talking points.
[03:26:40.759 --> 03:26:41.159]  I've seen it.
[03:26:41.459 --> 03:26:57.590]  Will pop up in seconds on hundreds of news articles that all pop up in the same five minutes, all written the same, just scrambled with people's names on them, all scrambling talking points, and then the same comments all pop up, and they're so lazy, it's even the same handles!
[03:26:57.930 --> 03:27:04.656]  Yes, but it shakes your face when it's Fox picking up the Media Matters talking points, and we've seen that with Brett Baier.
[03:27:04.676 --> 03:27:09.441]  One of the things I'm going to talk about in the next hour is what's going on at Fox?
[03:27:09.581 --> 03:27:15.727]  Fox was once a beacon for truth and accurate coverage, and it has become as bad as CNN.
[03:27:15.967 --> 03:27:20.652]  Because it was there to control conservatism and libertarianism and then, you know, make money off of it.
[03:27:20.672 --> 03:27:21.373]  It was contained.
[03:27:21.413 --> 03:27:22.114]  They were going to win.
[03:27:22.514 --> 03:27:36.230]  Now they know they've lost and so they're desperately killing the golden goose in hopes that'll stop us and all it'll do is further wake folks up and transfer and distribute that to other big sites and make us even stronger.
[03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:40.312]  The Fox viewership down by one-third.
[03:27:40.972 --> 03:27:41.433]  One-third!
[03:27:41.493 --> 03:27:42.533]  That's devastating.
[03:27:43.233 --> 03:27:46.955]  And it's because more and more they're sticking to the mainstream media lie.
[03:27:46.975 --> 03:27:52.318]  I was watching it this morning and it was like, you'd have thought Donald Jr.
[03:27:52.358 --> 03:27:53.419]  was caught raping babies.
[03:27:54.523 --> 03:28:03.306]  I mean, you've got some patriots there, like Steve Doocy, for example, and Judge Napolitano, Judge Pirro, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson.
[03:28:03.786 --> 03:28:05.666]  But that's not round-the-clock.
[03:28:05.786 --> 03:28:06.527]  They're standouts.
[03:28:07.227 --> 03:28:11.868]  Overall, though, they're taking on the same case cast as CNN in their coverage.
[03:28:12.048 --> 03:28:12.528]  Don Jr.
[03:28:12.568 --> 03:28:13.309]  in big trouble!
[03:28:13.709 --> 03:28:15.709]  Everybody thought Russia was fake, but not now!
[03:28:16.350 --> 03:28:20.551]  He once met with a Russian to see if—they would say that—to see if Hillary was corrupt.
[03:28:21.131 --> 03:28:22.591]  It's like he met with one.
[03:28:22.652 --> 03:28:23.952]  He met with one.
[03:28:24.532 --> 03:28:27.294]  Well, how many Chinese did John Podesta meet with?
[03:28:27.574 --> 03:28:29.736]  How many foreign nationals did he meet with?
[03:28:29.976 --> 03:28:30.616]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:28:30.637 --> 03:28:36.641]  The Chinese at espionage are great at it because they just burrow into every business and then pass the info out they admit.
[03:28:36.661 --> 03:28:40.524]  I mean, that's what, then they make money from the Chinese government giving it to them.
[03:28:40.964 --> 03:28:42.085]  I mean, and we just let them do it.
[03:28:42.885 --> 03:28:44.107]  It's political correctness!
[03:28:44.547 --> 03:28:49.032]  The Russians are relatively ham-handed in their understanding of American politics.
[03:28:50.033 --> 03:28:52.936]  And there's still no evidence that would hold up in a U.S.
[03:28:52.996 --> 03:28:53.377]  court of law.
[03:28:53.397 --> 03:28:54.938]  By the way, even Hillary said that, as you know, a month ago.
[03:28:54.958 --> 03:29:03.327]  But she said that we, and me specifically, that we created the talking point, then the Russians gave us the money and the intel, and then we put it back out.
[03:29:03.928 --> 03:29:05.390]  You didn't know he commanded the Russians, too?
[03:29:05.531 --> 03:29:09.797]  Yeah, no, it's... it's... These people live on a different planet than the rest of us.
[03:29:10.338 --> 03:29:12.080]  There's no longer any common sense.
[03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:14.844]  Do you think Hillary really believes the Russians stole it from her?
[03:29:15.672 --> 03:29:16.473]  She's that mentally ill?
[03:29:16.793 --> 03:29:27.844]  Yeah, well first of all, no one is ever going to admit that they are an abject failure, and she doesn't want to admit that people hate her, and that people don't trust her based on her record of lies and corruption.
[03:29:28.384 --> 03:29:39.856]  So she and Robbie Mook and John Podesta, they have to come up with some reason why they... And I'm sorry, I don't usually judge a book by its cover, but that collection of Abedin and Weiner, they all look like space aliens from the Dark Crystal.
[03:29:40.672 --> 03:29:45.753]  I mean, the word is you've got to be super ugly to be around her because she likes ugly people.
[03:29:46.173 --> 03:29:47.234]  She likes pedophiles, too.
[03:29:47.254 --> 03:29:47.714]  She loves them.
[03:29:48.034 --> 03:29:48.734]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:48.794 --> 03:29:52.095]  Roger Stone's hosting as we battle the pedophile empire of Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:52.415 --> 03:29:53.315]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.816 --> 03:29:55.416]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.336 --> 03:29:59.017]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:06.423 --> 03:30:16.407]  His book is Dear Reader about the Dear Leader, the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il, who, again, is the third-generation hereditary dictator of the communist hellhole.
[03:30:16.427 --> 03:30:21.330]  I think you should give it to all your liberal friends so they can learn about the wonders of this.
[03:30:21.350 --> 03:30:24.951]  But we just saw Mr. Warmbier die of injuries to stay in there.
[03:30:25.011 --> 03:30:33.255]  But the democracy of North Korea, as they call it, they claim that it had nothing to do with their custody, that he died on the flight, or got brain damage on the flight over.
[03:30:33.275 --> 03:30:35.836]  So joining us, of course, they would never lie, Michael Malice
[03:30:35.896 --> 03:30:37.037]  Tell us about the dear leader.
[03:30:37.137 --> 03:30:40.419]  What is the essence of North Korea and our dear leader?
[03:30:40.479 --> 03:30:47.264]  North Korea practices what they preach, by which I mean they think human life does not matter except as a function of the government.
[03:30:47.644 --> 03:30:50.666]  Your entire life has to be at the leader's behest.
[03:30:50.726 --> 03:30:56.410]  They explicitly say the leader gives the citizens sociopolitical life, so human beings don't matter.
[03:30:56.830 --> 03:31:01.594]  So you see this not only with Otto Warmbier, who is a very tragic story and was very clearly a murderer,
[03:31:02.054 --> 03:31:08.919]  But you saw this in the 90s when they allowed 1 to 2 million of the world population to starve rather than let the government lose their control of power.
[03:31:09.039 --> 03:31:10.880]  You know, we're blessed in this country.
[03:31:10.900 --> 03:31:13.282]  A lot of people don't realize how bad governments can be.
[03:31:13.742 --> 03:31:17.385]  They think it's income taxes or they think it's, you know, something like Bloomberg stuff.
[03:31:17.825 --> 03:31:18.306]  It's not.
[03:31:18.526 --> 03:31:23.691]  It can get so bad and we're so used to it being so good here that we get oblivious.
[03:31:23.931 --> 03:31:31.598]  North Korea is really, if people want to understand just how bad government can be, this is how it's been for 70 years with this country and these poor people.
[03:31:31.738 --> 03:31:33.119]  They have concentration camps.
[03:31:33.139 --> 03:31:36.282]  You can see the concentration camps on Google Earth.
[03:31:36.302 --> 03:31:37.944]  There's 100, 200,000 people in them right now.
[03:31:38.424 --> 03:31:41.367]  And another, I know after the break we can talk at length, but
[03:31:42.107 --> 03:31:44.389]  There's levels of hell that we can't even imagine.
[03:31:44.409 --> 03:31:51.335]  So whenever you see the media reporting on how funny they are, this is a country of hostages where everyone has a gun to the back of their head at all times.
[03:31:51.675 --> 03:31:58.020]  And if someone put a gun to the back of your head, Alex, or mine, you would do some wacky stuff too, just to keep yourself and your family alive.
[03:31:58.360 --> 03:32:03.882]  Once people understand what North Korea is really like, they will realize this is complete hell on earth, like you said.
[03:32:04.142 --> 03:32:06.043]  This is not aspirational for anyone.
[03:32:06.363 --> 03:32:10.285]  And that's the reason I wrote the book, because the media gets it wrong so often.
[03:32:10.625 --> 03:32:16.928]  They like to portray North Korea as this carnival, as a sideshow, as this wacky kind of country where everyone gets along and everything's nice.
[03:32:16.948 --> 03:32:20.149]  Yeah, they only show the parades and things and say, look at these funny people.
[03:32:20.949 --> 03:32:21.950]  It's like Disney World, right?
[03:32:21.970 --> 03:32:23.810]  Like, hey, who doesn't like a parade, right, Alex?
[03:32:23.850 --> 03:32:25.271]  Like, hey, parades all day.
[03:32:25.551 --> 03:32:26.591]  It's not parades all day.
[03:32:26.831 --> 03:32:29.492]  These are, you know, like the baton death march.
[03:32:29.953 --> 03:32:33.514]  So I said, the books out there were either too depressing or too scholarly.
[03:32:33.554 --> 03:32:35.655]  I said, there's got to be a book where you can read
[03:32:36.335 --> 03:32:44.841]  In an entertaining way, understand what is going on there and understand behind this facade of, you know, having a good time and it's this, you know, military superpower.
[03:32:45.101 --> 03:32:48.263]  They're really the worst place on earth and it didn't happen overnight.
[03:32:48.483 --> 03:32:51.205]  There's so many levels to how they control the people.
[03:32:51.265 --> 03:32:52.606]  It's not just the telephones.
[03:32:52.646 --> 03:32:53.727]  It's not just the television.
[03:32:53.767 --> 03:32:55.408]  It's not just the education system.
[03:32:55.608 --> 03:33:01.032]  It's just so stacked and so covered that it seems your heart just has to break for the North Korean
[03:33:13.138 --> 03:33:13.659]  News.
[03:33:14.220 --> 03:33:15.041]  Analysis.
[03:33:15.561 --> 03:33:16.222]  Reports.
[03:33:16.943 --> 03:33:19.126]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.647 --> 03:33:22.430]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:24.270 --> 03:33:24.891]  Welcome back.
[03:33:25.371 --> 03:33:33.277]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in now for Alex Jones and we're gonna go to your calls because I think this is one of the best things on InfoWars.
[03:33:33.678 --> 03:33:43.145]  I like the back-and-forth from patriots who want to call in and ask questions or make a point and this dialogue I think is very important for activists to have.
[03:33:43.686 --> 03:33:47.269]  So why don't we start with Alyssa in Oregon.
[03:33:47.289 --> 03:33:48.910]  You've been holding Alyssa.
[03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:49.731]  What's on your mind?
[03:33:51.351 --> 03:33:51.992]  Hi, Roger.
[03:33:52.312 --> 03:33:54.274]  It's an honor to be on the phone with you, sir.
[03:33:56.216 --> 03:34:00.800]  Now, I don't know how much contact you are able to have with the Trump White House.
[03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:02.622]  I know you have high-level sources.
[03:34:03.503 --> 03:34:11.611]  But has Donald Trump been able to sit down with Jeff Sessions at all and kind of put pressure on him to start pushing indictments?
[03:34:11.911 --> 03:34:13.893]  Because it seems like Jeff Sessions is kind of
[03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:16.091]  Not really doing a whole lot.
[03:34:16.652 --> 03:34:18.114]  I mean, it's been months of this.
[03:34:18.274 --> 03:34:22.178]  You know, we have known criminals just running their mouths.
[03:34:22.878 --> 03:34:25.081]  The list of crimes goes on and on and on.
[03:34:25.501 --> 03:34:31.888]  And we have people like Linda Tharstor actively acting with sedition against the White House.
[03:34:32.068 --> 03:34:34.130]  And nothing happens to these people.
[03:34:34.731 --> 03:34:35.852]  You raise an excellent point.
[03:34:37.452 --> 03:34:39.773]  Yeah, no, I think you raise an excellent point, Alyssa.
[03:34:39.933 --> 03:34:55.638]  I would like the Attorney General, who I think is fundamentally a good man, to stop worrying about the 29 states that have legalized marijuana in some form and start worrying about treason at the highest levels of the Obama-Clinton administration.
[03:34:56.218 --> 03:35:12.128]  We now have definitive proof, backed up by the FISA Court, that tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, because it's redacted, of Americans were under active surveillance, and that the FBI, under James Comey, abused that information.
[03:35:12.688 --> 03:35:15.470]  This is a criminal indictment waiting to happen.
[03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:17.031]  What did Comey know?
[03:35:17.511 --> 03:35:18.532]  What did Rice know?
[03:35:18.552 --> 03:35:20.133]  What did Clapper know?
[03:35:20.673 --> 03:35:21.794]  What did Brennan know?
[03:35:21.874 --> 03:35:25.156]  And yes, what did Barack Obama know?
[03:35:25.996 --> 03:35:31.399]  Frankly, I had expected the Attorney General, who's a hard charger, to be more aggressive.
[03:35:31.979 --> 03:35:33.940]  President Trump has the whip hand.
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:39.763]  He has the power to turn the tables on his critics and scatter them.
[03:35:40.283 --> 03:35:45.465]  Send some of them to jail for egregious, illegal, unconstitutional activities.
[03:35:46.006 --> 03:35:47.386]  It's an excellent point, Alyssa.
[03:35:47.686 --> 03:35:52.449]  Let's hope the President will call in his AG shortly and get him straightened out.
[03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:56.433]  Let's go to Brad in Louisiana.
[03:35:56.493 --> 03:35:57.654]  Brad, what's on your mind?
[03:35:57.674 --> 03:35:59.516]  Hey, greetings.
[03:35:59.556 --> 03:36:00.998]  Good afternoon to you, Roger.
[03:36:01.038 --> 03:36:10.849]  Well, sir, speaking generally, people who are leftist proponents typically seem to be devoid of morality and civility.
[03:36:11.912 --> 03:36:15.455]  It seems as though they're kindred spirits with, uh, Islamics.
[03:36:15.956 --> 03:36:32.089]  Nothing that they do or say can, uh, be trusted, it seems, and anyone who participates in human trafficking, uh, child sacrifice, pedophilia, or satanic rituals, I mean, how can they rise above lying because that's their father, right?
[03:36:32.189 --> 03:36:32.549]  Satan?
[03:36:33.190 --> 03:36:36.232]  I want to say kudos to Alyssa because she, she has, uh,
[03:36:37.633 --> 03:36:39.634]  Let me just segue my question.
[03:36:40.095 --> 03:36:45.237]  Politicians, the clergy and the wealthy and weak-minded seem to have this propensity.
[03:36:45.957 --> 03:36:52.641]  So how could we ever believe what people of this ilk state while under oath?
[03:36:53.401 --> 03:37:07.384]  Especially when using the Bible as a standard, if they, and probably the questioner, are merely leftists performing for their dark master, who's definitely not the American people.
[03:37:07.784 --> 03:37:13.406]  It seems as though congressional questioning has become a force to me.
[03:37:13.886 --> 03:37:15.346]  How do you feel about it?
[03:37:15.862 --> 03:37:18.503]  Well, I think you raise a very good point.
[03:37:18.543 --> 03:37:31.790]  You'll remember that the Director of Intelligence, Mr. Clapper, under Obama, went before the Congress and testified under oath that there was no metadata collection program.
[03:37:32.530 --> 03:37:42.676]  He was forced to apologize and retract in the face of a perjury indictment when Edward Snowden released documents showing that Clapper was lying.
[03:37:43.476 --> 03:37:54.585]  So, the establishment leaders, the insiders in the neocon deep state have no qualms whatsoever about going before the U.S.
[03:37:54.645 --> 03:37:56.827]  Congress and lying under oath.
[03:37:57.668 --> 03:38:04.113]  I'm headed to the House Intelligence Committee for a closed-door hearing, unfortunately, on July 24th.
[03:38:05.814 --> 03:38:17.342]  There's a number of members of that committee who have made flat, definitive, false statements about me, about Wikileaks, and about what I knew at certain points in the election.
[03:38:17.802 --> 03:38:22.525]  So we're going to have an opportunity to straighten them out and to straighten out the public record.
[03:38:23.146 --> 03:38:27.148]  My disappointment, once again, is that this hearing will not be in public.
[03:38:27.228 --> 03:38:29.350]  They had no trouble smearing me in public.
[03:38:29.830 --> 03:38:35.294]  They had no problem, as one member of the committee said, Stone is on the payroll of the Kremlin.
[03:38:36.055 --> 03:38:38.037]  No Congresswoman, I'm not.
[03:38:38.558 --> 03:38:39.359]  Apologize.
[03:38:39.940 --> 03:38:52.698]  So I'm looking forward to that confrontation and I guarantee you some fireworks and you're going to be able to hear about it exclusively first here on InfoWars.
[03:38:53.578 --> 03:38:55.679]  Thank you very much for your call.
[03:38:56.579 --> 03:38:59.960]  Let's go to Cody in Montana, Big Sky Company.
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:05.501]  Let me also say our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:39:05.561 --> 03:39:09.622]  If you want to call in and get your question, now is the time.
[03:39:10.182 --> 03:39:12.583]  This is a dialogue for patriots.
[03:39:12.683 --> 03:39:15.364]  Call in now and I'll try to handle your question.
[03:39:15.844 --> 03:39:16.564]  Cody, go ahead.
[03:39:18.584 --> 03:39:20.025]  Hey there, this is Cody.
[03:39:20.065 --> 03:39:21.185]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:39:22.463 --> 03:39:23.544]  Here's my question.
[03:39:24.664 --> 03:39:43.051]  Two years ago, the worst I thought about the news was that CNN is just biased, Fox is just biased, but now it's gotten to the point where they're blatantly lying so bad, they're exposing themselves, saying stuff that can be proven wrong in two seconds by using Google, just banking on people being misinformed.
[03:39:43.151 --> 03:39:51.194]  My question is, InfoWars is gaining a lot of traction, and as people become more informed and informed, I'm wondering,
[03:39:51.736 --> 03:40:06.239]  If you're able to kind of put it into perspective, maybe, at what stage we are in the war, and as the elites and the globalists crumble and continue to fall, do you think they might stage, like, a huge offensive?
[03:40:06.639 --> 03:40:12.281]  Like, maybe a big terrorist attack, a dirty bomb, or something like that, to try to maintain power?
[03:40:12.341 --> 03:40:13.301]  How do you see this going?
[03:40:13.703 --> 03:40:15.725]  Well, Alex Jones is absolutely right.
[03:40:15.805 --> 03:40:16.466]  We're winning.
[03:40:17.127 --> 03:40:18.568]  That's what's terrifying them.
[03:40:18.949 --> 03:40:34.905]  You see, the technological advances that now allow more than half of the American people to get their political news through the internet really threatens the stranglehold the mainstream media has had on political discourse in this country.
[03:40:35.626 --> 03:40:36.526]  And they don't like it.
[03:40:37.026 --> 03:40:41.368]  They liked it when they were the only voice, and they could not be contradicted.
[03:40:41.848 --> 03:40:46.489]  And frankly, if it didn't happen on one of the three big networks, it didn't happen at all.
[03:40:47.170 --> 03:40:51.471]  Now, these technological advances have given rise to a vibrant
[03:40:52.171 --> 03:40:59.637]  Robust alternative media across the board, not just conservative media, but an alternative media across the board.
[03:41:00.297 --> 03:41:11.466]  That's why the tech left is moving aggressively using a series of techniques and other computer tricks, including manipulation of the algorithms.
[03:41:12.767 --> 03:41:17.589]  Throttling and a number of other techniques to limit our reach.
[03:41:18.029 --> 03:41:20.311]  To strangle free expression.
[03:41:20.671 --> 03:41:22.572]  To kill the First Amendment.
[03:41:23.092 --> 03:41:25.653]  This is the most important fight that we face.
[03:41:26.234 --> 03:41:37.720]  I urge you to go to FreeOurInternet.com where there is a non-profit organization that is fighting for a truly neutral internet.
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:39.261]  Now, this is complicated.
[03:41:39.921 --> 03:41:44.002]  Because the left expropriates our rhetoric.
[03:41:44.042 --> 03:41:50.365]  They would tell you they're the ones who are for a free, unfettered internet.
[03:41:50.685 --> 03:41:54.246]  When in fact, they are the arbiters of censorship.
[03:41:54.746 --> 03:42:06.090]  Whether it is in the name of fake news, where President Barack Obama signed a defense appropriation that included a section setting up, in essence, a ministry of truth.
[03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:08.773]  A national censorship board.
[03:42:09.234 --> 03:42:17.868]  And when we in turn are paying lefty organizations like Snopes as if they are the arbiters of truth.
[03:42:18.369 --> 03:42:20.332]  So they are in a panic.
[03:42:21.309 --> 03:42:25.052]  And in their panic, they resort to censorship.
[03:42:25.532 --> 03:42:25.852]  Why?
[03:42:26.213 --> 03:42:30.015]  Because they can no longer argue the issues on the merits.
[03:42:30.436 --> 03:42:34.058]  They can no longer argue the issues based on the facts.
[03:42:34.599 --> 03:42:37.481]  And therefore, they seek to silence us.
[03:42:38.161 --> 03:42:39.422]  Not going to happen, folks.
[03:42:39.963 --> 03:42:43.766]  Not as long as we, here at InfoWars, have breath in our bodies.
[03:42:44.226 --> 03:42:46.167]  Thank you very much for your call, Cody.
[03:42:46.267 --> 03:42:49.470]  Let's go to Mariano in California.
[03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:52.181]  Hey Roger, how's it going?
[03:42:52.641 --> 03:42:53.001]  Excellent.
[03:42:53.141 --> 03:42:53.762]  Great to be here.
[03:42:54.763 --> 03:42:57.905]  Okay, one thing before I get to my question.
[03:42:58.105 --> 03:43:11.296]  I'd like to thank you and Alex and the whole team and InfoWars for waking me up because I thought I voted for the lesser of two evils in Hillary, but I made a gigantic mistake, obviously.
[03:43:13.932 --> 03:43:15.654]  It's never too late for salvation.
[03:43:15.694 --> 03:43:16.355]  Let me say that.
[03:43:16.615 --> 03:43:17.676]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:43:18.157 --> 03:43:18.837]  Exactly.
[03:43:18.957 --> 03:43:19.658]  A couple questions.
[03:43:20.619 --> 03:43:25.904]  One, update on your group regarding the marijuana legalization.
[03:43:25.984 --> 03:43:30.189]  And two, what are your opinion on Jerry Brown running California like if it's a country?
[03:43:31.202 --> 03:43:32.164]  Well, I'm glad you asked.
[03:43:32.184 --> 03:43:37.530]  You refer, of course, to the United States Cannabis Coalition, the USCC.
[03:43:37.970 --> 03:43:41.815]  You can go to UnitedStatesCannabisCoalition.com.
[03:43:41.835 --> 03:43:44.899]  The website is now up where you can donate.
[03:43:45.439 --> 03:43:49.524]  We are a coalition of Republicans and Democrats.
[03:43:50.245 --> 03:43:54.206]  Liberals and conservatives, libertarians and progressives.
[03:43:54.666 --> 03:44:09.590]  The group includes prominent Democrats like Orlando attorney John Morgan, who single-handedly legalized medicinal marijuana in my home state of Florida, and a number of other prominent Republicans and Democrats.
[03:44:10.190 --> 03:44:14.511]  And we have a narrow focus, which is just to persuade the president
[03:44:15.211 --> 03:44:21.135]  To stick to his pledge to support states' rights on the question of marijuana.
[03:44:21.495 --> 03:44:26.318]  To support the states' right to make their own decision, as 29 states have done.
[03:44:27.238 --> 03:44:31.501]  Surprisingly, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has
[03:44:32.421 --> 03:44:51.573]  Done kind of a bait-and-switch, meaning Sean Spicer, the White House spokesperson, said only recently that the focus of the Justice Department was just on recreational marijuana in the nine states that have legalized same.
[03:44:52.233 --> 03:44:56.275]  But then, only weeks ago, Jeff Session asked the U.S.
[03:44:56.335 --> 03:45:04.718]  Congress, essentially, for permission to prosecute in the 29 states that have legalized medicinal marijuana.
[03:45:05.178 --> 03:45:16.843]  In essence, he wanted to overturn a Dana Rohrbacher-inspired rider that was attached to the budget that, right now, prevents the Attorney General from such a crackdown.
[03:45:17.683 --> 03:45:41.774]  I don't have to tell you that such a crackdown would not only deprive millions of Americans of their medicine, medicine that they believe, and there's great evidence, helps their physical condition, it would cost states and counties hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in lost revenues, and of course it would kill thousands of jobs.
[03:45:42.174 --> 03:45:45.276]  This is not the way to make America great again.
[03:45:45.936 --> 03:45:53.618]  President Donald Trump has been a consistent critic of the war on drugs as an ignominious expensive failure.
[03:45:54.198 --> 03:46:01.800]  As long as 20 years ago he said he was for the legalization of marijuana as a solution to this problem.
[03:46:02.301 --> 03:46:03.601]  So all I seek to do
[03:46:04.221 --> 03:46:07.202]  is to persuade the president to stick to his guns.
[03:46:07.262 --> 03:46:08.622]  He was right in the campaign.
[03:46:09.022 --> 03:46:10.122]  He's right now.
[03:46:10.582 --> 03:46:19.744]  Do not let Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly divert the president from his strong commitment.
[03:46:21.805 --> 03:46:23.565]  That's my wife, but she's going to have to wait.
[03:46:24.225 --> 03:46:24.565]  All right.
[03:46:24.665 --> 03:46:27.266]  Thank you very much for your question, Mariano.
[03:46:27.346 --> 03:46:31.307]  Let's go to Zach in my home state of Florida.
[03:46:33.174 --> 03:46:34.474]  How are you doing, Roger?
[03:46:34.514 --> 03:46:35.435]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:46:36.395 --> 03:46:39.196]  I just wanted to make a quick point before I had a question for you.
[03:46:39.856 --> 03:46:44.918]  Alex asked earlier, why are they putting Hillary out there to head up the midterm elections?
[03:46:44.978 --> 03:46:52.681]  My opinion on that is, that is a signal to people aligned with her politically within the federal government that have been there 10 plus years.
[03:46:53.459 --> 03:46:53.819]  I think so.
[03:47:07.998 --> 03:47:16.443]  And it was a signal for them to just stay put, we're going to get past this, and we'll be able to carry this out, and you will get your promotion through the chain of command from the time you've put in.
[03:47:16.564 --> 03:47:17.564]  That's my opinion on that.
[03:47:18.265 --> 03:47:33.134]  And my question to you is, do you think that there needs to be a—we talk about purging the D-State—should there be a deeper purging, meaning going two, three people down, two, three positions down, from leads of departments and things of this nature?
[03:47:34.155 --> 03:47:37.277]  Or is Trump letting this play out because it is so deep?
[03:47:37.959 --> 03:47:41.740]  And he's kind of just getting what he can done at an executive level.
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:45.021]  We're going to let the states have the power and back them from the White House.
[03:47:46.262 --> 03:47:49.043]  Well, I have a little different take on what's going on here.
[03:47:49.063 --> 03:47:56.085]  You see, I think Hillary Clinton and her husband are promoting themselves to be the face of the Democratic Party in the next midterm election.
[03:47:56.125 --> 03:48:04.008]  But the truth is, most rank and file Democrats that I know, and I know many, they're fed up with the Clintons and they see them as losers.
[03:48:05.508 --> 03:48:10.272]  Barack Obama and his wife control the machinery of the Democratic Party.
[03:48:10.933 --> 03:48:18.378]  Anyone who thinks that there is no animosity between the Obamas and the Clintons has not read my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[03:48:19.339 --> 03:48:26.485]  It is important to understand that that internal struggle in the Democratic primary is ongoing.
[03:48:27.105 --> 03:48:38.307]  Bernie Sanders has refused to rule out another presidential bid if he's not in prison over the current corruption investigation that he and his wife are embroiled in.
[03:48:39.267 --> 03:48:42.888]  The Clintons have overstayed their welcome.
[03:48:43.368 --> 03:48:45.909]  She is not politically viable.
[03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:51.830]  And frankly, I pray night and day that she is the face of the Democratic Party in 2018.
[03:48:53.775 --> 03:49:02.239]  As far as the departments are concerned, this has been a great failure so far, and I lay this at the feet of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
[03:49:02.939 --> 03:49:10.783]  Essentially what you have in Washington today is the Obama administration with a few Trump appointees at the very top of every department.
[03:49:11.383 --> 03:49:17.906]  When I worked on the transitions for President Reagan and President Bush, we had a plan in place to hit the ground running.
[03:49:18.227 --> 03:49:28.832]  We knew what the top 10 most important jobs in government to be filled were, and we knew that they had to be done quickly to take over the government.
[03:49:29.012 --> 03:49:33.495]  So, that is what is needed, and the time is well past.
[03:49:33.755 --> 03:49:35.336]  The time is now.
[03:49:35.716 --> 03:49:37.677]  Thank you, Zach, for your call.
[03:49:38.397 --> 03:49:42.020]  I want to reiterate one thing Alex Jones said that I think is very important.
[03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:49.945]  You see, normally on television there's enormous pressure from the sponsors about what you can and cannot say on the air.
[03:49:50.485 --> 03:49:52.987]  You don't have that here at InfoWars.
[03:49:53.427 --> 03:49:55.549]  We are true only to ourselves.
[03:49:56.149 --> 03:50:05.856]  The products you find at the InfoWars store are carefully tested, carefully selected, and they are the very best of their genre.
[03:50:06.616 --> 03:50:12.040]  If you're looking for premium zinc to boost the immunity system, go to the InfoWars store.
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:14.421]  You'll find the best product on the market.
[03:50:14.902 --> 03:50:22.987]  But when you go to the InfoWars store, you not only help InfoWars and yourself, you help fund the fight for freedom.
[03:50:23.327 --> 03:50:27.250]  You help fund the fight for the First Amendment and for a free press.
[03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:30.432]  So please, hit the InfoWars.com store.
[03:50:30.772 --> 03:50:33.954]  We need your support and we very much appreciate it.
[03:50:34.355 --> 03:50:36.376]  I'm Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:50:37.184 --> 03:50:37.730]  Be right back.
[03:51:03.865 --> 03:51:11.507]  It's more critical than ever to recommit to financially support the broadcast and to get great products back in exchange, a 360 win.
[03:51:11.787 --> 03:51:13.748]  Emrix Essentials Outdoor Special.
[03:51:14.028 --> 03:51:26.511]  We're talking our non-nano zinc high-powered sunscreen along with Emrix Essentials bug spray that's totally organic and natural and works way better than chemical brands I've personally used.
[03:51:26.811 --> 03:51:33.173]  Help fund this organization that you know has been successful fighting tyranny on every front.
[03:51:41.016 --> 03:51:42.416]  My friends, we have done it.
[03:51:43.057 --> 03:51:49.159]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[03:51:49.779 --> 03:51:55.281]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[03:51:55.601 --> 03:52:01.823]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[03:52:02.043 --> 03:52:02.383]  Doctor?
[03:52:02.403 --> 03:52:03.963]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:52:04.364 --> 03:52:08.865]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[03:52:11.755 --> 03:52:15.038]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[03:52:16.219 --> 03:52:16.780]  Thank you, Dr. Groot.
[03:52:17.721 --> 03:52:20.123]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[03:52:20.604 --> 03:52:21.825]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[03:52:22.566 --> 03:52:23.307]  This is the move.
[03:52:23.347 --> 03:52:24.788]  This is unprecedented.
[03:52:24.808 --> 03:52:27.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[03:52:27.891 --> 03:52:28.472]  Oh my God!
[03:52:28.672 --> 03:52:29.353]  What the hell?
[03:52:29.553 --> 03:52:30.253]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[03:52:30.273 --> 03:52:31.034]  Get out of here!
[03:52:31.214 --> 03:52:31.735]  Shut this down!
[03:52:31.755 --> 03:52:32.536]  This is not safe!
[03:52:32.816 --> 03:52:33.577]  This is not... Hold on!
[03:52:33.817 --> 03:52:34.217]  Settle down!
[03:52:35.058 --> 03:52:35.819]  Get another doctor.
[03:52:35.859 --> 03:52:36.419]  Something's wrong.
[03:52:36.679 --> 03:52:37.680]  Something's wrong with him helping.
[03:52:37.900 --> 03:52:39.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[03:52:40.001 --> 03:52:40.882]  I take it personally.
[03:52:41.102 --> 03:52:42.262]  Do not have those problems.
[03:52:42.923 --> 03:52:45.424]  Again, these are authorized herbs.
[03:52:45.804 --> 03:52:46.685]  Well known to be safe.
[03:52:48.066 --> 03:52:49.086]  Please, doctor.
[03:52:49.467 --> 03:52:50.327]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[03:52:50.527 --> 03:52:53.209]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut the commercial for just a moment.
[03:52:53.409 --> 03:52:53.909]  Cut, cut, cut.
[03:52:53.969 --> 03:52:55.050]  Get everybody out of here.
[03:52:59.455 --> 03:53:00.696]  Super male vitality.
[03:53:01.237 --> 03:53:01.838]  It's awesome.
[03:53:02.298 --> 03:53:04.140]  Just not this awesome.
[03:53:04.500 --> 03:53:05.161]  Oh my God!
[03:53:05.421 --> 03:53:06.102]  What the hell?
[03:53:06.543 --> 03:53:09.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[03:53:09.826 --> 03:53:15.832]  It is satire to illustrate in a satirical way the incredible power of super male vitality.
[03:53:16.966 --> 03:53:24.993]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[03:53:25.493 --> 03:53:29.477]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53:29.497 --> 03:53:32.880]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[03:53:32.900 --> 03:53:34.401]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[03:53:34.441 --> 03:53:35.362]  It takes some focus.
[03:53:36.123 --> 03:53:37.404]  Up, up, and away!
[03:53:45.012 --> 03:53:53.261]  Securing super male and super female vitality has never been easier because in the month of July it's 30% off and free shipping.
[03:53:53.702 --> 03:54:00.329]  Get hungry to defeat the globalists and fund the tip of the spear while securing super male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:54:05.655 --> 03:54:10.817]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[03:54:11.197 --> 03:54:14.198]  Right here, on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.598 --> 03:54:17.519]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:54:20.319 --> 03:54:20.940]  Welcome back.
[03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:24.641]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:54:25.541 --> 03:54:31.303]  There's a very important special election going on in Alabama that I want to bring your attention to.
[03:54:32.361 --> 03:54:55.432]  When Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned from the Senate to join the Trump cabinet, Robert Bentley, the Republican governor of Alabama, then under investigation in a sex and corruption scandal that would ultimately drive him from office into prison, appointed Attorney General Luther Strange to the U.S.
[03:54:55.472 --> 03:54:55.792]  Senate.
[03:54:56.877 --> 03:55:09.481]  Now, there's an inherent conflict in that Mr. Strange was supposed to be investigating Governor Bentley at the exact time he was soliciting this appointment.
[03:55:10.381 --> 03:55:23.885]  Now, Mitch McConnell and the Republican establishment are rolling out the big guns, arm-twisting and pressuring conservatives and conservative organizations to get behind Luther Strange.
[03:55:24.565 --> 03:55:29.351]  The problem is that there's substantial evidence that Mr. Strange is corrupt.
[03:55:29.871 --> 03:55:43.347]  We've only recently learned that after a $25,000 contribution from Drummond Coal, Luther Strange, as Attorney General, called off an environmental investigation.
[03:55:44.028 --> 03:56:00.796]  And then, a year later, after he was re-elected Attorney General, he took another $25,000, which under Alabama election law, could constitute a bribe in view of the fact that Attorney General then, Strange, had no campaign debt.
[03:56:01.756 --> 03:56:05.360]  Also in this race is Congressman Mo Brooks.
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:16.230]  Congressman Brooks is a vicious Trump critic, attacking the president not only when he was the Republican nominee, but after the election.
[03:56:16.691 --> 03:56:18.472]  Certainly no Trump supporter there.
[03:56:19.013 --> 03:56:23.717]  The bright spot in this election is Dr. Randy Brinson.
[03:56:24.338 --> 03:56:30.422]  Dr. Randy Brinson is a former chairman of the Alabama Christian Coalition.
[03:56:31.402 --> 03:56:41.788]  Like Donald Trump, he's an outsider, a medical doctor who has a substantial experience as an entrepreneur, businessman, and job creator.
[03:56:42.228 --> 03:56:48.032]  But more importantly, Randy Brinson is the man that Donald Trump needs from Alabama.
[03:56:48.732 --> 03:56:49.593]  Luther Strange?
[03:56:50.054 --> 03:57:00.364]  You can count on him to stand with Mitch McConnell and those who even today are blocking the President's plan for health care reform.
[03:57:00.845 --> 03:57:02.246]  Let me put it another way.
[03:57:02.867 --> 03:57:10.935]  Luther Strange is supported by the very people who are opposing President Trump's agenda in the United States Senate.
[03:57:12.077 --> 03:57:28.513]  I also want to mention to you that Saturday the 15th at 6 o'clock I will be in Las Vegas with my friends Congressman Ron Paul, Sean Stone, Adam Kokesh and others in a rally for freedom for the Bundys.
[03:57:28.953 --> 03:57:34.219]  The story of the Bundy ranchers and the oppressive foot of the federal government
[03:57:34.799 --> 03:57:38.262]  Uh, is one that the American people don't know enough about.
[03:57:39.643 --> 03:57:47.649]  17 men who rallied in support of the Bundys await trial, uh, but are refused pre-trial release.
[03:57:48.089 --> 03:57:53.073]  They have been held in some cases for more than a year in prison awaiting trial.
[03:57:53.573 --> 03:57:57.296]  This is, of course, a violation of due process.
[03:57:57.717 --> 03:58:06.044]  So join me this Saturday, July 15th at 6 o'clock at the Rainbow Garden Inn in Las Vegas.
[03:58:06.384 --> 03:58:08.205]  We are going to rally for freedom.
[03:58:08.586 --> 03:58:10.227]  Congressman Ron Paul will be there.
[03:58:10.387 --> 03:58:13.610]  Again, Sean Stone, Adam Kokesh, and myself.
[03:58:14.050 --> 03:58:16.893]  We need to see you there in the fight for freedom.
[03:58:17.313 --> 03:58:18.234]  I look forward to it.
[03:58:18.614 --> 03:58:21.095]  Thank you so much for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:58:21.515 --> 03:58:24.076]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:58:24.537 --> 03:58:27.118]  And remember, victory or death!
[03:58:45.820 --> 03:58:49.583]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.565 --> 03:58:59.429]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:58:59.629 --> 03:59:00.610]  The contest is simple.
[03:59:00.850 --> 03:59:06.214]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:59:06.394 --> 03:59:13.779]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:59:13.919 --> 03:59:20.502]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:20.582 --> 03:59:30.466]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:59:30.647 --> 03:59:38.210]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:59:38.410 --> 03:59:48.332]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:59:48.492 --> 03:59:51.833]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[03:59:51.853 --> 03:59:52.813]  This is Kit Daniels.
[03:59:55.674 --> 03:59:59.675]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
