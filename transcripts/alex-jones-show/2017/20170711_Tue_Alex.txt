[00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:05.734]  We've got it.
[00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:12.219]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.381]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:22.327]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:39.155]  It's 7-11!
[00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:48.679]  Already the 11th day of July 2017 on this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.220]  On this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.542]  I want to be very very clear with the listeners and viewers right now.
[00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.072]  We're witnessing the greatest witch hunt in U.S.
[00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:04.592]  history.
[00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:19.097]  The most transparent, the most fraudulent, the most upside down, the most twisted compendium of fraud that I have ever seen in modern history.
[00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:33.131]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen the entire Russia narrative shot down with each new piece of disinformation, each new red herring, each new hoax.
[00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:47.704]  But I get up this morning and I learned from Ellen L. Weintraub, Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, what I already knew from four months ago.
[00:01:50.425 --> 00:02:05.708]  I am under criminal espionage investigation by the FBI for taking money from Russians or Russian-owned companies.
[00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:15.968]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are almost exclusively funded by private sales of books, videos, t-shirts, supplements, water filters, storable foods.
[00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:16.728]  Everybody knows that.
[00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:25.395]  The rest is totally transparent, third-party Google and AdBlade and all these other sites.
[00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:32.560]  We have third parties that handle our comments on InfoWars.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.361]  That's called DISCUS.
[00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:35.983]  We do everything third-party so it's all completely transparent.
[00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:41.781]  I've never gotten one scintilla of money from Russia.
[00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.202]  I've never gotten any directives from Russia.
[00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:56.867]  Hillary finally got it right when she said that Russia didn't come up with a way to beat her, that Infowars did, and the Russians picked it up.
[00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:02.749]  Now that's not true, but at least she gets that I wag the dog, not the other way around.
[00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:06.182]  My listeners defeated you, which?
[00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:08.363]  America defeated you, which?
[00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:30.538]  And they say in the letter that InfoWars, Drudge and Breitbart, because before they just said in the Armed Services Committee in the House months ago, we'll play the clip coming up, that Russia, RT, Ruppley, those are both Russian, and InfoWars are under FBI investigation.
[00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.400]  And then it was confirmed by McClatchy.
[00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:52.877]  This is a member, a commissioner, Ellen L. Weintraub, on the Federal Elections Commission, saying, in the letter, calling for congressional hearings, that we're under investigation for espionage.
[00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:55.499]  Now, let me tell you something right now.
[00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:02.004]  Like I told Congressman Schiff in a flowerly way, I meant metaphysically in the info war, that we will
[00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:10.265]  defeat them with the truth and beat them up one side and down the other with logic peacefully in the market of ideas.
[00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.472]  I welcome being called to Congress and I will only testify in public.
[00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:34.232]  And I'm begging you scum that put this type of garbage out to put me in Congress because I'm going to bring up all your Russian connections and your communist Chinese connections and I'm going to politically give you your Waterloo.
[00:04:34.772 --> 00:04:36.893]  I'm going to destroy you politically.
[00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:40.654]  I love this un-American desperation by you.
[00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:42.835]  This is outrageous!
[00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:46.016]  But here's the best part.
[00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.337]  They want us shut down.
[00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:49.204]  Oh yes!
[00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:53.252]  I mean, if they couldn't make us more of superstars now.
[00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:56.758]  I mean, I fully embrace these false charges.
[00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.361]  I love this.
[00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:01.246]  You just jumped a Megalodon shark.
[00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.035]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:09.418]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:10.739]  It is rampant out there.
[00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:12.621]  Here are some of its main exhibitors.
[00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:14.423]  Barack Obama.
[00:05:15.044 --> 00:05:21.712]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against.
[00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:23.074]  Washington fat cats.
[00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:24.676]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.097]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:31.784]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because of the healthcare bill he lied about.
[00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:33.205]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:35.988]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.395]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:49.278]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:58.822]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife under investigation for bank fraud.
[00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:00.622]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.
[00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:03.103]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:04.284]  This is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:15.770]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.890]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.071]  Why is this so good?
[00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:23.592]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:37.237]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:38.678]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:06:39.578 --> 00:06:41.020]  Spreading disease around.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.603]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:06:43.683 --> 00:06:44.944]  These are all parasites.
[00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.086]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.147]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:51.792]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:06:51.992 --> 00:06:55.176]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:58.318]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:06:58.338 --> 00:06:59.339]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.280]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.380]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.462]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:08.124]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:10.265]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:12.607]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.750]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:21.073]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:28.277]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:32.079]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:52.426]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:56.528]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:07:57.088 --> 00:08:07.554]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:13.557]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:20.521]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.494 --> 00:08:32.056]  I am extremely honored right now.
[00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:38.640]  I feel like I just won an Oscar, a Pulitzer Prize, a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.102]  But to be honest, I wouldn't want one of those prizes.
[00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:47.124]  Those are awards that come from the criminal, parasitic, globalist system.
[00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:49.486]  No, the award I've won
[00:08:50.655 --> 00:09:04.897]  Is being shingled out by the globalist criminals that have hijacked this country and that have taken over our government and have been selling our jobs and industry and secrets out to authoritarian regimes like Communist China.
[00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:14.126]  And who admit they have a plan of deindustrialization and poverty to bring the American people to heal or to submission.
[00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:15.527]  That is globalism.
[00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:19.048]  I am so honored that we've rebooted America together.
[00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:24.009]  I am so honored that we're in the fight of our lives and we have the upper hand in the initiative now.
[00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:33.212]  I am so honored to see the sleeping giant rise from its great slumber, now becoming fully awake and electricity pulsing from its eyes.
[00:09:35.510 --> 00:10:02.811]  I am honored, very, very, very, very honored to have the Federal Elections Commission call for a group of hearings against myself, Matt Drudge, and of course Breitbart, and admitting that we're under criminal FBI investigation for espionage
[00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:04.643]  I think so.
[00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:45.763]  The actual operatives point their dirty, low-down, slimy, cowardly fingers at me and other true Americana patriots like Drudge and Breitbart, and say that we are under criminal investigation for espionage, and that they want us subpoenaed, and that they want us drugged before Congress.
[00:10:45.803 --> 00:10:46.723]  Here's the problem, though.
[00:10:47.164 --> 00:10:48.284]  They did poison.
[00:10:48.364 --> 00:10:49.404]  I saw the medical report.
[00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:51.645]  The Secret Service asked him not to make it public.
[00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.566]  Of Roger Stone, who was hit with polonium.
[00:10:55.787 --> 00:11:00.431]  Right when they were going to call him before Congress, they wanted to kill him so they could blame him for everything and have him dead.
[00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:00.951]  Didn't work.
[00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:03.133]  Didn't get enough of it into him.
[00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:07.496]  And they've tried this with other folks they want to scapegoat.
[00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:15.361]  So the problem is, they may try to kill Drudge and myself and others before they have the hearings.
[00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:17.183]  But I'm just pointing that out.
[00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:18.924]  If it does happen, it's very, very obvious.
[00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:22.017]  But we win that way, either way.
[00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.618]  This is unbelievable.
[00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:46.530]  Now, a few months ago, about four months ago, they had hearings in the House Armed Services Committee and had a Board of Governors member of the FCC, under the Directorate of the Central Intelligence Agency, it's all right here, come in and say that there's a criminal espionage investigation against R.T.
[00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.871]  Ruppley and the Nympho Wars.
[00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:50.446]  He says, of course, InfoWars.
[00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:52.746]  Oh, yes, of course, InfoWars.
[00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:54.747]  I hardly watch RT.
[00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.128]  We post some of their stories.
[00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.808]  It's like we post, you know, Associated Press stories.
[00:12:00.089 --> 00:12:03.190]  RT's kind of leftist and milquetoast.
[00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.871]  I don't really like it.
[00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:06.751]  Everybody knows that.
[00:12:10.993 --> 00:12:16.955]  But again, they had that CIA report back in January.
[00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:27.944]  Turns out it wasn't 17 agencies, it was three Democratic hacks, put it together, said 17 agencies agreed with it, that said, oh, four years ago, RT had a report criticizing Hillary.
[00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:30.005]  Oh my goodness, there's the total proof!
[00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.508]  A foreign TV system criticized Hillary.
[00:12:32.808 --> 00:12:34.550]  Oh my gosh, that's why she lost!
[00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:40.175]  She had Hollywood, Saudi Arabia, the EU, most of Wall Street, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan.
[00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:46.434]  All the big universities, most of the newspapers, all pushing for her, but she lost.
[00:12:46.794 --> 00:12:48.635]  She rigged the debate questions.
[00:12:49.055 --> 00:12:50.255]  She ran the major media.
[00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:51.316]  She had fake polls.
[00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:56.239]  She had the whole world against Trump and the American people, but failed.
[00:12:57.539 --> 00:13:00.621]  And now they want to blame me?
[00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:05.549]  Here's the headline, and I read this this morning, and I thought, is it really that bad?
[00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:15.518]  But I knew they admitted the criminal investigation then, but then it was in McClatchy, just a footnote, when they called the FBI, they said, yes, criminal investigation, and they'd said it in Congress, and we've got those clips coming up.
[00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:21.904]  But then I actually read the letter from Ellen L. Weintraub.
[00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.706]  Boy, you ought to read about this lady.
[00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:24.607]  Look at her.
[00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:27.670]  If you're a TV viewer, infowares.com forward slash show.
[00:13:29.957 --> 00:13:35.699]  There's another person that's all into, she's on the Federal Elections Commission and she says this and she says that.
[00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:40.460]  These are the same people that say churches don't have a right to be pro-life because that's political.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:48.782]  The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:50.683]  Then it gets into the press and everything else.
[00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:58.945]  Congress has no jurisdiction, but the Democrats have intimidated Christian churches, conservative churches, libertarian churches, patriot churches into having no
[00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:02.467]  Not our system of open free-to-practice religion!
[00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:26.464]  But again, they turn that around where Republicans are trying to pass laws saying churches can endorse political candidates or have political views.
[00:14:26.764 --> 00:14:28.045]  Pro-Second Amendment, you name it.
[00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.145]  Of course they can!
[00:14:29.325 --> 00:14:35.828]  The Democratic Party never stopped their churches from being open, globalist combines.
[00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:39.169]  But again, this lady says we need to be shut down.
[00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.650]  We need to be arrested.
[00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:45.252]  We need to be whole before Congress.
[00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:53.909]  Because, with no evidence, I'm getting money from the Russians or subsidiaries.
[00:14:53.969 --> 00:15:06.353]  They're hoping they can go through any sponsors we have, from third-party AdBlade and all these other, you know, third-party everybody else has, and hope some company advertised on there was some Russian connection.
[00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:11.775]  The good news is, those are all third-party sites I have nothing to do with, and that's only about 25% of our revenue.
[00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:15.316]  All the rest of it is supplied by you, the listeners and viewers.
[00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:17.902]  Maybe they'll go through your name, see if you're a Russian.
[00:15:18.443 --> 00:15:33.655]  But the answer to this is, ladies and gentlemen, is to show the witch hunt, the intimidation, the McCarthyism to the next power, tyranny and beyond, in a desperate last gasp move.
[00:15:35.396 --> 00:15:42.561]  FBI counterintelligence investigators were probing whether far-right sites like Breitbart and Infowars had coordinated with Russian
[00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:47.084]  Bonets to blitz social media with anti-Clinton stories.
[00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:48.385]  Oh my gosh.
[00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:49.725]  So here's the new ones.
[00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:50.545]  That's McClatchy.
[00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:57.748]  The Examiner, New Fears, Drudge, InfoWars, Breitbart, Conface, Dim, FEC, Inquisition.
[00:15:57.788 --> 00:15:58.528]  That's their words.
[00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:18.626]  In a revived bid by a top Federal Elections Commission Democrat could lead to an inquisition against conservative media outlets like Drudge Report, Infowars, and Breitbart that take political advertising and are overseen by right-leaning owners and editors.
[00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:24.187]  See, Hollywood, CNN, Bezos can get $600 million from the
[00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:28.615]  CIA to run the Washington Post and attack the president, myself and others.
[00:16:29.096 --> 00:16:30.136]  But all that's okay.
[00:16:30.737 --> 00:16:37.462]  The fact that we're right-leaning and we're over media and we're open about our political views means why?
[00:16:37.602 --> 00:16:40.204]  It violates the election laws.
[00:16:40.324 --> 00:16:41.084]  No it doesn't!
[00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.485]  But they don't care.
[00:16:43.806 --> 00:16:48.770]  They want to create that illusion and then connect it to Russia to bring in criminal charges.
[00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:52.993]  The answer is we need to get more aggressive, more in their face.
[00:16:55.908 --> 00:16:58.530]  Not become intimidated by it and be less political.
[00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.151]  Political is the First Amendment.
[00:17:00.412 --> 00:17:03.994]  You have the frothing CNN admitting its mission is to bring down Trump.
[00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:05.616]  The frothing Washington Post.
[00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.737]  The frothing New York Times.
[00:17:08.077 --> 00:17:19.987]  Owned by a Mexican kingpin, probably the second or first most rich man in the world, up to his eyeballs in muck and slime, making $10 billion off U.S.
[00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:22.228]  taxpayers off the Obama phone.
[00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:23.970]  Eight years of that garbage.
[00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.411]  Over a billion a year.
[00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:27.933]  In a government contract.
[00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:28.533]  Profit.
[00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:40.084]  Oh yes, the Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, the Russians financing Hillary, the Russians, hundreds of millions to her foundation, 30 plus million to the Podestas for uranium.
[00:17:40.424 --> 00:17:45.989]  They, secret meetings with Putin, companies with Russians, traveling to Russia every month for years.
[00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.751]  Secret servers.
[00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:49.532]  None of that's under investigation.
[00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:50.433]  No.
[00:17:51.414 --> 00:18:07.589]  No, InfoWars, promoting the Second Amendment, securing our borders, standing up against random acts of cop killing, standing up against Black Lives Matter funded by the globalists, and we, oh yes, I love this, this is so ridiculous.
[00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.131]  This is so delicious.
[00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:14.455]  And it goes on to say,
[00:18:16.926 --> 00:18:32.497]  The plan set for discussion at the FCC's meeting Thursday, we gotta watch this live, could open the door to political subpoenas targeting the websites, I love it, with editorial news decisions and their owners, maybe even Matt Drudge and Alex Jones, according to an expert analysis.
[00:18:34.218 --> 00:18:35.039]  Well, we've been listed.
[00:18:36.442 --> 00:18:38.005]  Again, this is just pure intimidation.
[00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:40.128]  We give in to this, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.811]  But it's the mouse that roared.
[00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:42.513]  It's a joke.
[00:18:43.074 --> 00:18:47.281]  It's like a two-year-old saying they're going to beat up Mike Tyson in his prime, you know, in 1987, 88.
[00:18:51.124 --> 00:18:57.446]  She said the tracking foreign influence in elections could be the FEC's finest hour.
[00:18:57.627 --> 00:18:58.087]  Oh, yes.
[00:18:58.507 --> 00:19:03.829]  Adding, I believe that this commission can indeed rise to the challenge of understanding what happened in 2016.
[00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:05.109]  You lost.
[00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.710]  People hate you.
[00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:12.332]  And plugging any legal or procedural holes that could allow foreign actors to interfere with future elections.
[00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:18.655]  In her effort targeting foreign influence in federal and state elections, Commissioner Ellen Weintraub
[00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:20.730]  We're good to go.
[00:19:38.214 --> 00:19:39.095]  Investigation.
[00:19:39.976 --> 00:19:57.913]  The report also points out, this is the letter to Congress, to Russia ties to conservative ownership and funding as the political target of investigations, citing a McClatchy report, said FBI counterterrorism investigations, counterintelligence investigators, were probing whether far-right sites like Breitbart News, InfoWars, and coordinated with Russian outlets.
[00:19:58.213 --> 00:20:02.598]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, will there be an investigation if I'm coordinating with Pluto?
[00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:26.418]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time have all agreed on one great thing.
[00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:43.267]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[00:20:44.232 --> 00:20:57.804]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed, we're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[00:20:58.885 --> 00:21:05.831]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point.
[00:21:06.721 --> 00:21:09.603]  That our species has never even imagined.
[00:21:10.444 --> 00:21:17.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:27.836]  That vision was then manifest in 1945, when two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[00:21:28.657 --> 00:21:32.920]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.002]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[00:21:37.028 --> 00:21:51.179]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, the people of the world.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:22:01.648]  But President Trump, in his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[00:22:02.649 --> 00:22:05.471]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:09.414]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:14.677]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[00:22:15.037 --> 00:22:15.958]  It's why they hate me.
[00:22:16.218 --> 00:22:17.098]  It's why they hate you.
[00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:20.140]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.243]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:31.986]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our republic is coming back from the dead,
[00:22:32.938 --> 00:22:37.101]  I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:40.483]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[00:22:40.903 --> 00:22:46.987]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:54.593]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount all the other major nutraceuticals and products
[00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.239]  Between 20 and 30 percent.
[00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:03.504]  In fact, some of the discounts are as high as 40 percent on some of the Enbridge Essentials, so we're going to continue those as well.
[00:23:04.164 --> 00:23:09.829]  Until they sell out, while supplies last, the lowest discounts are 10 percent.
[00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:16.093]  The highest discounts are 40 percent to celebrate the victories we've had against the Globalist.
[00:23:16.374 --> 00:23:19.056]  That's InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:21.317]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense
[00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.892]  Long lasting sale in the history of Infowars.
[00:23:29.572 --> 00:23:37.857]  Because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening, the spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[00:23:38.257 --> 00:23:41.259]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together.
[00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:44.480]  Because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[00:23:44.981 --> 00:23:51.625]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:53.986]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[00:24:19.887 --> 00:24:27.476]  You have the Democrats, along with the Republican establishment, that have completely sold this country out to multinational interests.
[00:24:27.496 --> 00:24:35.224]  They try to transfer what little power Congress and the states had to the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, and other treasonous operations.
[00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:37.206]  Trump has pulled us out of that.
[00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.602]  He has put Saudi Arabia and the EU in line.
[00:24:40.943 --> 00:24:44.565]  He has said no to the G20 dictating our internal operations.
[00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:58.873]  He has gotten three trillion in the stock market, hundreds of billions in new jobs, over a thousand companies to move back to the United States, 60 plus percent reduction in illegals coming across the border, all in just six months, and killed the global carbon tax.
[00:24:59.813 --> 00:25:03.537]  And so the outsiders that have hijacked this country are upset.
[00:25:03.798 --> 00:25:04.298]  They're mad.
[00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:05.920]  So they're saying he's a Russian spy.
[00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:09.023]  They're saying I'm a Russian spy.
[00:25:09.684 --> 00:25:10.765]  They're saying Drudge is.
[00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:21.256]  And now the Democrats have announced that they want expanded congressional hearings and criminal investigations of yours truly, Breitbart News Service and Matt Drudge.
[00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:28.036]  As involved in criminal espionage on the payroll of Vladimir Putin.
[00:25:28.737 --> 00:25:34.461]  These people have brought the term witch hunt to a whole new level.
[00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:44.634]  Now a lot of people think, oh my gosh, you've got mainstream news after you, you've got Democrats after you, this is scary, let's avoid conflict.
[00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:47.175]  I'm trying to draw conflict.
[00:25:47.675 --> 00:25:49.436]  I'm trying to draw these traitors out.
[00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:58.959]  They're the ones that sold us out to the globalists, they're the ones that sold us out to the multinationals, they're the ones up to their eyeballs with the Russians, and over their head with the CHICOMS!
[00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:04.421]  The Democrats that gave the reactors and the fissile material and the missile secrets to North Korea!
[00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:11.498]  The Clintons are like beyond Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.
[00:26:12.418 --> 00:26:18.940]  I mean, George Soros, in the last Bond movie, the Quantum Group is Soros' group.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.022]  That's literally, MI6 admitted they helped write the script, that's George Soros!
[00:26:25.662 --> 00:26:27.183]  He's a literal Bond villain!
[00:26:27.683 --> 00:26:33.525]  Trying to finance riots and cop killing and overthrow the Middle East and open the borders of Europe, he's behind it all!
[00:26:34.764 --> 00:26:38.906]  And he's a Nazi collaborator still alive at almost 90!
[00:26:38.966 --> 00:26:41.347]  David Rockefeller died this year.
[00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:42.907]  Brzezinski died this year.
[00:26:43.968 --> 00:26:45.748]  They're falling like dominoes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:46.008 --> 00:26:48.649]  God and time is having its way with them.
[00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:50.110]  Death, the great equalizer.
[00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.351]  But I am so pleased by this.
[00:26:55.592 --> 00:27:03.075]  This is such an act of desperation to have McClatchy, to have Congress, to have Washington Examiner reporting on it, to have the letter
[00:27:04.138 --> 00:27:06.540]  From the Commissioner, Ellen L. Weintraub.
[00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:09.082]  Put this lady on screen for TV viewers.
[00:27:11.023 --> 00:27:16.427]  Come out and basically say I'm a Russian agent.
[00:27:16.447 --> 00:27:20.931]  Yeah, and I'm a monkey's uncle too, lady.
[00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:29.070]  You know what, I think I'm going to go to Russia sometime this year, just to make a big deal out of this that I'm not following their intimidation and their garbage.
[00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:37.294]  You know, since I'm supposedly controlled by this place, I've been to Spain, I've been to Italy, I've been to England, I've been to Central America, but I've never been to Russia.
[00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:40.336]  I ought to go see this wonderland.
[00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:51.824]  That made my ancestors on both sides come over on the Mayflower, and made my ancestors help start and win the Revolutionary War, and made my ancestors literally kick off the Texas Revolution.
[00:27:52.064 --> 00:27:54.224]  My ancestors literally started the whole thing.
[00:27:54.564 --> 00:27:56.405]  Got the orders from Jackson, everything.
[00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:58.186]  Raised Colonel Travis's son, all of it.
[00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:02.947]  I just didn't know... I didn't know it was the Russians did all that!
[00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:13.918]  I didn't know it was my ancestors related to the Tudors and directly related to all the rest of the folks from England and the invention of the stock market.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.401]  I didn't know all that.
[00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:18.982]  I didn't understand that.
[00:28:19.162 --> 00:28:24.026]  I thought it all came, you see, from my Russian bosses, Comrade Jones.
[00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:30.891]  A whole nother level, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:32.632 --> 00:28:33.573]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:37.028]  I didn't do anything in my life.
[00:28:37.209 --> 00:28:38.189]  The Russians did it all.
[00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.610]  They started in full wars 22 years ago.
[00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.590]  In fact, my mother didn't give birth to me.
[00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.211]  Putin did.
[00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:45.611]  And Putin wiped my butt when I was a baby.
[00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:47.912]  No, the truth is, Hillary lost.
[00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:48.793]  The globalists lost.
[00:28:49.013 --> 00:28:50.673]  They got caught trying to steal the election.
[00:28:50.853 --> 00:28:52.634]  They tried to steal six states.
[00:28:52.694 --> 00:28:53.734]  They did steal five.
[00:28:54.194 --> 00:28:58.796]  This same lady, Gottlieb, Weintraub, all of them.
[00:29:00.136 --> 00:29:00.757]  Who's the other one?
[00:29:02.622 --> 00:29:09.468]  The other one attacking me, Armstrong, admittedly working with the CIA through the Board of Governors, saying, I'm clearly a Russian agent under investigation.
[00:29:09.628 --> 00:29:10.949]  Those clips are coming up in the next segment.
[00:29:14.852 --> 00:29:24.660]  She's the one that called out Trump saying, I demand that you come out and show your evidence, President, that there were illegals voting.
[00:29:27.863 --> 00:29:29.645]  And then, of course, it turned out that that violated
[00:29:30.785 --> 00:29:31.585]  All sorts of ethics.
[00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:38.407]  I mean, this lady is a Democratic Party slimeball operative at every single level.
[00:29:39.388 --> 00:29:42.609]  And, when we come back, I'll play the clips of them again.
[00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:45.750]  Now they say, I'm commanding the Russians, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.651]  I'm commanding the Russians, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:50.611 --> 00:29:53.752]  I mean, this is the next level insanity, because they're the traitors.
[00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:55.672]  They're the enemy.
[00:29:56.153 --> 00:29:57.553]  They're the outsiders.
[00:29:57.573 --> 00:30:00.394]  They say that we are what they are.
[00:30:03.894 --> 00:30:09.776]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[00:30:09.956 --> 00:30:11.477]  The contest is simple.
[00:30:11.697 --> 00:30:16.538]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[00:30:16.738 --> 00:30:24.121]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[00:30:24.261 --> 00:30:30.845]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:40.810]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[00:30:41.011 --> 00:30:48.555]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:30:48.755 --> 00:30:58.691]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[00:30:58.852 --> 00:31:02.197]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[00:31:02.317 --> 00:31:03.159]  This is Kit Daniels.
[00:31:04.178 --> 00:31:10.342]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:31:10.722 --> 00:31:13.604]  Dr. Griff, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:31:13.944 --> 00:31:19.148]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:31:19.568 --> 00:31:25.532]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:31:25.672 --> 00:31:28.814]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:30.415]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:31:30.615 --> 00:31:34.759]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:31:34.939 --> 00:31:37.822]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:31:37.882 --> 00:31:39.464]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.727]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:45.350]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.591]  It's in powder form.
[00:31:46.691 --> 00:31:49.394]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.575]  I take this.
[00:31:50.695 --> 00:31:51.976]  This is the product that I take.
[00:31:52.097 --> 00:31:54.078]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:55.639]  We fight the Globals!

[00:32:04.221 --> 00:32:05.601]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:07.161]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:08.262]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:08.562 --> 00:32:14.323]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:14.543 --> 00:32:20.264]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:20.444 --> 00:32:37.317]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:39.839]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:41.400]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.421]  Easy assembly.
[00:32:42.701 --> 00:32:43.322]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:43.622 --> 00:32:45.444]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:09.281 --> 00:33:13.002]  You're listening to The Antidote for Fake News.
[00:33:13.583 --> 00:33:15.543]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.944 --> 00:33:22.726]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away.
[00:33:23.026 --> 00:33:30.149]  I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me.
[00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:51.415]  Yeah, once people ran to the Democrats, now they run from you.
[00:33:51.455 --> 00:34:01.019]  But it must be the Russians' fault that folks don't like Black Lives Matter shooting cops every week in the back of the head for no reason, or running around claiming everybody's racist.
[00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:20.806]  Or George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, funding radical Islam to take over the Middle East and then invade Europe and bragging about it, or trying to bankrupt the economy, trying to turn our coal plants off so our power prices double, or having the Ninth Circuit rule that American flags can't be worn in California schools because they're hateful.
[00:34:21.807 --> 00:34:23.048]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:34:23.088 --> 00:34:24.169]  The insanity!
[00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:30.133]  There were articles all over the news yesterday saying, Jones has bashed transsexuals.
[00:34:30.653 --> 00:34:33.075]  I said I'm a libertarian, I'm not bashing anybody.
[00:34:33.816 --> 00:34:43.325]  I know it makes it more of a treat, you know, if people make themselves the center of attention, like a little kid standing in front of the television, everybody tries to watch the Super Bowl, but it's a bunch of grandstanding.
[00:34:44.606 --> 00:34:51.432]  And I said, the Daily Mail and Associated Press and others that reported, a man gives birth for the first time.
[00:34:52.406 --> 00:34:56.987]  And I knew it would be a woman who thinks she's a man that has a uterus and had a baby.
[00:34:57.307 --> 00:34:58.667]  You, atomically.
[00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:00.527]  You, you, you, you, genetically.
[00:35:00.947 --> 00:35:02.608]  You have a uterus.
[00:35:02.928 --> 00:35:03.888]  You have hormones.
[00:35:04.008 --> 00:35:05.148]  You are a woman.
[00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:07.049]  Mentally, you may think you're a man.
[00:35:07.369 --> 00:35:09.369]  You may even have brain characteristics like a man.
[00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:09.969]  I get that.
[00:35:10.289 --> 00:35:11.869]  But you have a uterus.
[00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:16.870]  That is how, in the mammal kingdom, we know you are the female.
[00:35:18.511 --> 00:35:20.811]  But I was reading on the Democratic Party run
[00:35:23.942 --> 00:35:24.543]  Media matters.
[00:35:25.004 --> 00:35:25.724]  Soros funded.
[00:35:26.906 --> 00:35:28.368]  It was the most unintentional comedy.
[00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:33.595]  All these people in their own echo chamber, most of it bots, saying, look how insane he is.
[00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:34.957]  Yes, he's crazy.
[00:35:35.017 --> 00:35:35.498]  Ha ha.
[00:35:35.778 --> 00:35:36.800]  Poor ignorant fool.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.505]  He doesn't know that if a woman says she's a man, she is.
[00:35:42.346 --> 00:36:01.970]  They were saying, I'm crazy, I'm bigoted, I'm nuts, I'm hateful, because I said it's a woman, it's a woman, it's a woman, and then they're in such a cult where they control reality, they believe, that they say that it's really a man and that a man had a baby.
[00:36:04.209 --> 00:36:11.876]  And then I said, no, the only place you have other creatures having babies other than in a woman, in a person, is in cows.
[00:36:12.616 --> 00:36:13.757]  Pull up MIT for them.
[00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:18.081]  Humanoids gestating on farms across the United States.
[00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:19.843]  MIT, last year.
[00:36:20.323 --> 00:36:21.384]  Hundreds of publications.
[00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:22.285]  And I said,
[00:36:24.517 --> 00:36:29.478]  They've got all sorts of weird cross-species things growing that aren't human, that are humanoid.
[00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:34.600]  And I said, other than that, the only place you have babies being created is in women.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.480]  There it is.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.781]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:38.781]  research farms.
[00:36:39.001 --> 00:36:45.143]  But Media Matters will edit that out and say, Jones, insanely again, claimed that there's such a thing as chimeras.
[00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.703]  He's totally insane.
[00:36:47.604 --> 00:36:48.404]  And a Russian agent.
[00:36:49.064 --> 00:36:49.344]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:49.564 --> 00:36:50.805]  Who sounds like a kook?
[00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:51.705]  Not me.
[00:36:54.687 --> 00:36:56.268]  But don't worry, more insanity's coming.
[00:36:57.348 --> 00:37:06.711]  If you just joined us, it's on Infowars.com, it's on DrudgeReport.com, because we're effective, we're under attack.
[00:37:07.512 --> 00:37:11.713]  New fears, Drudge Infowars Breitbart could face dim FEC inquisition.
[00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:13.494]  There's no could face it.
[00:37:13.974 --> 00:37:21.537]  They say we're under criminal investigation for getting money from the Russians with no evidence, and I've got no money from the Russians.
[00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:25.463]  Again, because they're losers.
[00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:30.029]  They lost the election.
[00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:32.834]  So Ellen L. Weintraub
[00:37:34.258 --> 00:37:38.061]  He knows full well that Podesta's up to his eyeballs with Russian and Chinese connections.
[00:37:38.761 --> 00:37:39.442]  So is Hillary.
[00:37:40.162 --> 00:37:40.843]  And so what do they do?
[00:37:40.923 --> 00:37:44.646]  They turn the narrative around and say Trump is involved with the Russians.
[00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:48.128]  The only way Trump was involved was saying, hey, I don't care who has the WikiLeaks.
[00:37:48.209 --> 00:37:48.769]  It's illegal.
[00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:50.030]  It was an illegal server.
[00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.432]  I don't care if it's some kid in the basement or it's the Russians.
[00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:53.252]  Release it.
[00:37:53.673 --> 00:37:58.957]  And so his son, for five minutes, met with some lawyer and said, do you have the evidence of them being Ruski spies?
[00:37:59.597 --> 00:38:00.977]  That's what an American does!
[00:38:01.257 --> 00:38:02.438]  It's what a Patriot does!
[00:38:02.718 --> 00:38:08.319]  A Ruski agent doesn't start meeting with every Russian they can find to say, hey, is it true she's on your payroll?
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.420]  That's what a Patriot does!
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.201]  But again, invert reality!
[00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:17.682]  You got folks trying to make the country great.
[00:38:17.702 --> 00:38:20.963]  63%, it was 40-something, percent down in illegals coming across.
[00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:22.643]  The economy exploding back.
[00:38:23.964 --> 00:38:24.984]  Felons being deported.
[00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:29.096]  Radical jihadists from seven countries not being let in.
[00:38:29.376 --> 00:38:38.701]  The economy trying to falter as the Federal Reserve tries to stop the recovery.
[00:38:38.761 --> 00:38:41.982]  I mean, we're in a fight for the future of this country.
[00:38:42.663 --> 00:38:46.604]  And they're piling on, saying, you better watch your speech or we'll shut you down.
[00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:53.288]  And they're calling for us to be shut down, saying we illegally got money from foreign powers with no evidence, they say.
[00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:57.651]  To manipulate the election, another made-up fantasy hoax.
[00:38:58.891 --> 00:39:09.757]  But they're just expanding it like they did in the 60s with churches to say, via pure bullying and outside of law, you're not allowed to have political speech as a radio host.
[00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:11.898]  And that's when they brought in the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:27.698]  That was unconstitutional, and it was an FCC regulation, pure Mafia Don intimidation, saying if you're a radio station or TV station, you better not give political endorsements, and you better not come out with your views, you better leave it neutral.
[00:39:27.978 --> 00:39:29.479]  But we all know it wasn't neutral.
[00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:44.570]  So the black churches, and the liberal churches, and the 100% liberal PBS's, and ABC's, and NBC's, and CBS's, and the New York Times, and the Washington Post, and the LA Times, and the Chicago Tribune, and the Miami Herald, and the Dallas Morning News.
[00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.493]  Every one of them, not liberal, but establishment, posing as liberal.
[00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:52.909]  Was allowed to then create full spectrum dominance in America.
[00:39:53.650 --> 00:40:07.705]  Total control over the media to take a libertarian, Americana, constitutional, conservative, rugged individual, George Washington, John Wayne country and turn it into
[00:40:09.605 --> 00:40:25.171]  The mess we see today, and the mess is angry at what's still strong, still honorable, still productive, and misery loves company and wants to pull down the final pillars of the nation using class envy, class warfare, existential envy.
[00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:31.453]  It's destroyed Venezuela, destroyed North Korea, destroyed Russia, destroyed China, destroyed many other countries.
[00:40:32.894 --> 00:40:33.234]  And so,
[00:40:34.617 --> 00:40:48.023]  Out of their desperation, the globalists that have hijacked the nation, the face sucker that we're now cutting loose, that we're now removing, is desperately trying to cling on by the last tentacle, trying to strangle the host!
[00:40:51.044 --> 00:41:02.089]  And we're just removing that last tentacle, and it is in full panic mode, and it's announcing that those of us trying to remove the parasite, that we are the outside power.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.001]  Trying to take care of our veterans.
[00:41:05.301 --> 00:41:06.642]  Trying to secure the Second Amendment.
[00:41:06.882 --> 00:41:08.042]  Trying to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:41:08.082 --> 00:41:09.023]  Trying to cut taxes.
[00:41:09.263 --> 00:41:10.684]  Trying to un-stall the economy.
[00:41:11.004 --> 00:41:12.745]  Trying desperately at the wheel.
[00:41:13.145 --> 00:41:14.986]  Trump is just battling in these storms.
[00:41:15.186 --> 00:41:16.887]  And he's actually starting to get us out of the storm.
[00:41:17.087 --> 00:41:18.088]  And we see sun.
[00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:19.989]  And we see a crack in the clouds.
[00:41:20.209 --> 00:41:21.650]  And the Democrats are, NO!
[00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.171]  Everybody get the wheel!
[00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:23.731]  Stop him!
[00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:27.533]  And they're trying to turn us back in to the tempest.
[00:41:27.773 --> 00:41:29.074]  Turn us back into the maelstrom.
[00:41:29.254 --> 00:41:30.675]  Turn us back into the squall.
[00:41:30.895 --> 00:41:32.376]  Turn us back into the typhoon!
[00:41:33.507 --> 00:41:36.129]  But everything they've got, it's ours!
[00:41:36.189 --> 00:41:36.489]  No!
[00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:47.535]  And all their pathetic minions who have no identity and only have bots that are friends on Facebook and Twitter live in this echo chamber that they're losing their power.
[00:41:47.775 --> 00:41:48.636]  They're losing their future.
[00:41:48.676 --> 00:41:49.656]  You never had power.
[00:41:49.836 --> 00:41:50.697]  You never had a future.
[00:41:50.797 --> 00:41:52.118]  You were given worthless degrees.
[00:41:52.298 --> 00:42:01.003]  You're part of a trendiness to be all alone with your fake facsimile and fake friends and the latest downloads of political correctness that you suck into your brain.
[00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:09.469]  Democrats, imagine if Republicans were saying that the Democrats were all Russian-run, which they were partially.
[00:42:09.669 --> 00:42:11.650]  The Russians weren't 10% of what the Chinese did.
[00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:15.652]  Imagine trying to push this whole narrative.
[00:42:16.072 --> 00:42:26.497]  And see, when I reach out to you, liberals, you think you're powerful, and I'm doing this because your decisions matter now, and because I need you to join me to win.
[00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.747]  We're going to beat you one way or another.
[00:42:30.087 --> 00:42:32.309]  I'm reaching out to you because you're in a cult.
[00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:33.891]  You're brainwashed.
[00:42:34.111 --> 00:42:34.932]  You're controlled.
[00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:36.193]  You're manipulated.
[00:42:36.473 --> 00:42:37.514]  You've been conditioned.
[00:42:37.694 --> 00:42:39.176]  Your friends aren't really your friends.
[00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.017]  You're all a bunch of followers.
[00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:42.734]  You're sad.
[00:42:43.074 --> 00:42:44.394]  Hillary calls you losers.
[00:42:44.614 --> 00:42:47.035]  She calls you basement-dwelling baristas.
[00:42:47.635 --> 00:42:53.476]  She says we need to keep them in the dark and desperate, and only believing in us, hoping for a future.
[00:42:54.116 --> 00:42:55.716]  I say believe in yourself!
[00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:57.277]  Believe in your ancestors!
[00:42:57.437 --> 00:42:58.777]  Believe in God!
[00:42:58.797 --> 00:43:00.557]  That'll deliver!
[00:43:00.937 --> 00:43:02.277]  Not Hillary Clinton!
[00:43:02.437 --> 00:43:08.559]  Do you believe that wicked witch, stealing 97% of the money from all the Haitian charities, running the whole thing?
[00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:11.039]  Do you believe that monster that first represented pedophiles?
[00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:13.137]  When she was first a lawyer?
[00:43:13.318 --> 00:43:16.049]  You think all the crimes she's committed, I came, I saw, he died?
[00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.194]  Her Brian Williams?
[00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:23.691]  Lies about how she was in all this combat in Serbia and Croatia?
[00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:40.974]  Do I have to list the lies and the evil of this woman again, allied with the most radical forms of Islam, with Soros, a Nazi collaborator, with Linda Sarsour, her Hamas family, with a bunch of her family in prison for terrorism, openly calling for jihad and getting women to put hijabs on at rallies?
[00:43:41.354 --> 00:43:47.055]  I mean, what type of fantastical, whacked-out, booby behavior is that?
[00:43:50.973 --> 00:43:54.654]  And if you're ignorant about the language, when I say booby, I don't mean breast, I mean dumb pirate.
[00:43:54.774 --> 00:43:55.274]  A booby.
[00:43:55.614 --> 00:43:56.174]  A boob.
[00:43:59.135 --> 00:44:01.315]  Do you understand you're in a simulation?
[00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:07.677]  The Democratic Party, globalism, all this is a screwjob that they make you think you're in the in crowd when you adopt it.
[00:44:07.917 --> 00:44:13.658]  It's called being a sucker, a chump, a schmuck, a rube, an idiot, a mark.
[00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:20.117]  But I tell you this about millennials and older folks and Generation Z, all of them.
[00:44:20.898 --> 00:44:24.380]  There's this spirit of never admitting you're wrong and being delusional in your own head.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.321]  When I'm wrong, I admit it.
[00:44:25.702 --> 00:44:26.923]  When I make a mistake, I admit it.
[00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:28.784]  When I fail at something, it's my fault.
[00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:29.905]  I want to make it better.
[00:44:30.205 --> 00:44:30.906]  I want to get better.
[00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:36.470]  But I've noticed with trendies and folks, they're just delusional.
[00:44:37.451 --> 00:44:40.194]  And I can't tell you, I knew a talk show host on GCN,
[00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:45.836]  Like, 15 years ago, and I know several other people that would get the Nigerian emails.
[00:44:46.536 --> 00:44:47.517]  I've told this story many times.
[00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:59.705]  And they'd go, Prince Abubu, or Abibi, or Bambubu, or whatever the stupid name is at the time, is, you know, really likes me, wants to give me $100,000, I just gotta give him $5,000.
[00:44:59.745 --> 00:45:02.047]  They want to believe their ships come in, and you go, that's a con game.
[00:45:02.487 --> 00:45:05.289]  Once you give them that money, they're gonna want double, but they're gonna claim more money's coming.
[00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:10.433]  And once they know they've got you, they know you're gonna keep wanting to invest, believing that, you know, finally you'll make good.
[00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:13.633]  And they'll just go, you're jealous that my ship's come in.
[00:45:16.174 --> 00:45:16.734]  You go, okay.
[00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:23.699]  And then after they've had 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 sucked out of them, what do they do?
[00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:26.681]  They never talk to you again, and you're the bad guy.
[00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:33.145]  There was a talk show host on GCN, I heard him on air one day, and was on a local station playing it.
[00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:43.365]  And I heard this talk show host in the afternoon going, I just got contacted by a Nigerian prince and, you know, if I give him $10,000, he's going to give me $100,000 or whatever it was.
[00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:44.765]  And this is really great.
[00:45:44.785 --> 00:45:45.646]  He really likes the show.
[00:45:47.147 --> 00:45:54.371]  That's what they do back then before really social media is they'd also target public figures and other people because they can get intel on you and then tell you, oh, the prince likes you.
[00:45:55.232 --> 00:45:57.193]  And I call him and I get on the board during a break.
[00:45:58.314 --> 00:45:59.575]  And I never really talked to the guy.
[00:45:59.595 --> 00:46:01.216]  I didn't know the host was obsessed with me and jealous.
[00:46:01.936 --> 00:46:04.938]  And I told the host, I said, listen, that's a con.
[00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:06.279]  That's not real.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.082]  And I later heard, about a week later, I went and found the archive.
[00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:14.744]  He said, oh, Alex Jones called me and told me not to do this.
[00:46:14.824 --> 00:46:15.585]  He's jealous.
[00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:16.546]  I am investing.
[00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:18.247]  And the prince does need more money.
[00:46:19.027 --> 00:46:20.028]  But I'm going to get even more later.
[00:46:20.068 --> 00:46:23.590]  And later I heard that he got like huge amounts of money from this guy.
[00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.212]  And the guy had a nervous breakdown after it.
[00:46:27.068 --> 00:46:30.410]  And was never heard of or seen again after his money sucked out of him.
[00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:32.432]  And man, it's the craziest thing.
[00:46:32.552 --> 00:46:33.813]  I can't get through to you.
[00:46:35.634 --> 00:46:40.217]  And so, I just want to have people that are on the fence listening about this to realize how you've been conned.
[00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:50.144]  Because... I mean, what Trump's doing is the exact economic plan of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
[00:46:51.343 --> 00:46:57.847]  Which is a classic Americana reboot operation, and they're not letting him execute but a small part of it.
[00:46:58.308 --> 00:47:02.391]  If he executed the whole thing, I mean, tax receipts would double at the IRS within one year.
[00:47:05.393 --> 00:47:07.474]  If they cut the taxes, that's what happens usually for about three years.
[00:47:07.494 --> 00:47:09.075]  It's got to be big, though.
[00:47:09.415 --> 00:47:10.276]  Create exuberance.
[00:47:10.836 --> 00:47:13.278]  Just Trump getting in created that effect.
[00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:15.840]  They're starting to push the effect back.
[00:47:17.307 --> 00:47:22.325]  And the left will celebrate that as things fall apart more because they want to blow it all up so they can control it.
[00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:36.104]  And if you just joined us, I'm honored to have lying scum, filth, trash, who know their filth, who know they work for foreign combines, that hate this country.
[00:47:36.284 --> 00:47:43.788]  You don't get into the globalist groups unless you hate America, you know you're conquering it, you hate the average person, you're a social engineer, and you have disdain for everyone.
[00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:45.629]  They only hire nasty scum.
[00:47:45.669 --> 00:47:48.370]  You go read the WikiLeaks, it's like something out of a cartoon.
[00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.591]  I hate the public.
[00:47:49.611 --> 00:47:52.152]  Yeah, this scum, we're gonna rip them off.
[00:47:52.372 --> 00:47:53.813]  I mean, it's like demons wrote it.
[00:47:54.053 --> 00:47:55.754]  Because who else would do stuff like this?
[00:47:55.994 --> 00:47:56.855]  Who else would steal?
[00:47:57.515 --> 00:47:59.397]  All the money from the Haitians and crap like that.
[00:48:00.898 --> 00:48:02.600]  While they kidnap the kids, on record.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.721]  AP report.
[00:48:05.162 --> 00:48:05.482]  Scum!
[00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:14.150]  And they're never going to stop until we just cut them off politically and realize they are like mentally ill people on a street corner.
[00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:16.312]  Or people in Supermax prisons, man.
[00:48:16.492 --> 00:48:17.873]  You don't go in the jail cell with them.
[00:48:18.114 --> 00:48:19.495]  You cut them off from society.
[00:48:19.655 --> 00:48:20.556]  They're never going to stop.
[00:48:20.676 --> 00:48:21.417]  They're bad people!
[00:48:22.574 --> 00:48:23.595]  The millions of it.
[00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:27.520]  The losers who think that they're part of it because they go along with it.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.102]  You're the biggest chumps of them all.
[00:48:31.107 --> 00:48:56.492]  So I am honored to have the enemies of America, the trash of the earth, the defenders of the pedophile combine, saying I'm the big enemy and I'm the most dangerous and I'm the horrible person up there with Drudge and Breitbart, because we are rewriting and rebooting the talking points of Americana and wealth and prosperity and genuineness and people working together and brotherly love and sisterly love and honor and true open societies and true tolerance.
[00:48:58.049 --> 00:49:03.433]  Not submission to the political correctness of Islam, or the political correctness of the college poison.
[00:49:04.533 --> 00:49:16.821]  I am so honored, I am so blessed, in my life, to have the scum of the earth, sworn enemies of you and your family, sworn enemies of my blood, sworn enemies.
[00:49:22.325 --> 00:49:23.206]  This is pure victory.
[00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:27.010]  Outrageous lies spewed from the mouth of serpents!
[00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:29.492]  Praise God and thank Christ!
[00:49:30.073 --> 00:49:34.096]  Let's go out to break with them trying to claim info wars is behind everything and the enemy here it is.
[00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:51.190]  So within one hour, one hour of the Access Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour the Russians, say WikiLeaks, same thing, dumped the
[00:49:52.765 --> 00:49:53.746]  John Podesta emails.
[00:49:54.927 --> 00:49:56.468]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[00:49:57.248 --> 00:50:13.179]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[00:50:13.419 --> 00:50:14.740]  It was based in Boston.
[00:50:15.141 --> 00:50:19.023]  You know, the Russian company had a very small investment in it.
[00:50:19.384 --> 00:50:21.025]  And you could keep saying that they gave me
[00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:25.089]  I'm just following all the widely reported information here, John.
[00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:27.711]  There's also Hillary Clinton, obviously.
[00:50:28.152 --> 00:50:34.638]  Maria, maybe you're looking at widely reported information from InfoWars, but it is not true.
[00:50:34.778 --> 00:50:35.199]  No, I'm not.
[00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:38.422]  This is Politico, this is the New York Times, this is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:38.462 --> 00:50:38.682]  No, it's not.
[00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.903]  That's what I'm looking at, John.
[00:50:40.064 --> 00:50:42.786]  Are there other RTs operating in the U.S.?
[00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:45.149]  Can you describe them, list them?
[00:50:46.787 --> 00:50:47.268]  Sure, thank you.
[00:50:47.428 --> 00:50:58.303]  So, you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:03.910]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers for those modalities.
[00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:18.473]  And if you read where that former FCC Board of Governors member came from, it's a program run by the CIA put into place by Obama in his last months in office.
[00:51:18.893 --> 00:51:22.314]  Propaganda bill in Congress could give America its very own Ministry of Truth.
[00:51:23.514 --> 00:51:25.215]  Zero Hedge links directly to the bill.
[00:51:26.815 --> 00:51:34.898]  And then Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, which specifically lists InfoWars.
[00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:37.426]  And now the CIA is going to counter us.
[00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:53.399]  Then you saw the CIA in the news, in public affairs yesterday at the Washington Post, pretty much an internal publication of the government, saying that Mike Cernovich is dangerous and Mike Cernovich has real intel and is targeting them.
[00:51:53.479 --> 00:51:57.722]  No, you're targeting us, bringing the country down, trying to sabotage the president.
[00:51:58.663 --> 00:51:59.904]  You work for the globalists.
[00:52:00.444 --> 00:52:05.188]  You put a bunch of Soros people in, and the White House
[00:52:06.354 --> 00:52:12.916]  Sources are reaching out to real, loyal American media to counter-target you.
[00:52:13.216 --> 00:52:14.517]  See, this is a two-way street.
[00:52:14.737 --> 00:52:18.798]  You attack America, you put out lies, we attack back with truth.
[00:52:19.338 --> 00:52:20.859]  And we smash you.
[00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:25.840]  We have more audience, we have the truth, we're fearless, and you can't beat us.
[00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:27.961]  Put me in prison, I'm a martyr.
[00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:28.801]  Kill me, I'm a martyr.
[00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:30.422]  Attack me, demonize me, I'm a martyr.
[00:52:31.334 --> 00:52:38.296]  The only thing you can do is endorse me to hurt me, and that won't work, because you'd have to endorse your own fall.
[00:52:39.097 --> 00:52:40.017]  Here's the good news.
[00:52:40.197 --> 00:52:42.017]  You already fell.
[00:52:43.598 --> 00:52:44.378]  You're scum!
[00:52:45.499 --> 00:52:46.399]  You're trash!
[00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:47.999]  You're filth!
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.760]  You're a joke!
[00:52:52.150 --> 00:53:06.399]  I always wondered why the leftist sites like Mentally Ill celebrate Alex is a coward, Trump's a coward, Drudge is a coward, they're scum, they're not effective, they're liars, they're criminals, because that's what they are.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.464]  And even though they know it doesn't affect us, we know it's bots, we know it's disinfo, that's all, but admit it, it's for their little
[00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:22.674]  Tiny minions, just little scared, trying to cozy up next to the mommy bird of the New World Order that hates their guts and is using them.
[00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:40.380]  They want to think they're in the in crowd, so they just keep doing this ghost dance, this hallucination that losers do, that they're in charge and they're winning, when every metric, every scientific fact, every gauge, every determiner, every bellwether,
[00:53:41.798 --> 00:53:49.744]  Every signature, every sign, every utterance, every movement shows the tide rushing out against you.
[00:53:50.084 --> 00:53:55.328]  Disdain, hardening, true institutional hatred for you.
[00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.612]  Nothing, nothing, nothing will restore you.
[00:53:59.992 --> 00:54:01.753]  Nothing, nothing will help you.
[00:54:03.034 --> 00:54:03.415]  Nothing!
[00:54:04.536 --> 00:54:10.900]  In fact though, your resistance, ununto collapse, is actually the buoying fire
[00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:14.339]  Which strengthens and tests our marrow.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:27.172]  And the fire you've lit to consume us is the very fire now burning you away from us and removing you to be nothing but vapor spewed into the stratosphere.
[00:54:31.598 --> 00:54:45.163]  Then like seeds of nuclei in the heavens, you will produce the rain that will fall to the verdant fields of liberty and grow the new crop of freedom.
[00:54:47.544 --> 00:54:49.905]  You are the potash in the atmosphere.
[00:54:52.285 --> 00:54:56.187]  The distorted, the twisted, the evil, the failed, the fallen, burned!
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.981]  And then thrown into the sky as God turns you to good.
[00:55:04.142 --> 00:55:06.063]  After your consciousness has been shredded.
[00:55:06.843 --> 00:55:07.663]  Ha ha ha!
[00:55:08.003 --> 00:55:11.585]  The doom you wish for us is the doom for you!
[00:55:11.605 --> 00:55:15.026]  The day of doom is here!
[00:55:15.046 --> 00:55:16.807]  For you!
[00:55:18.618 --> 00:55:36.950]  Because you were only one level of the test, preparing us to face the population explosion, the AI, the earth changes, and the massive struggles to come that we'll look back on this time as a time of great peace compared to the future.
[00:55:38.817 --> 00:55:46.358]  But God always tests those and gives those who are faithful a chance to prepare and grow and be ready for what's coming.
[00:55:47.119 --> 00:56:03.602]  And now we live in a fantastical time that is so amazing, it is just incredible to be separate from those that are anathema like Ellen L. Weintraub and her wicked family line, her fallen weakness.
[00:56:04.943 --> 00:56:18.149]  We should all pray for her, and how weak and twisted and evil she is, and how she would be an instrument to fight the Republic, an instrument trying to commit the fall of the Renaissance.
[00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:28.354]  A true servant of her father, Lucifer, the devil, the serpent, the old serpent, Leviathan, Baphomet.
[00:56:31.676 --> 00:56:31.856]  Now,
[00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:37.746]  Briefly, we need funding against the globalists.
[00:56:37.786 --> 00:56:42.629]  We are not funded by the Russians, George Soros, or stimulus money like NBC and MSNBC.
[00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:45.791]  We're not funded by the big globalist corporations like CNN.
[00:56:45.811 --> 00:56:47.312]  We are funded by you!
[00:56:48.153 --> 00:56:50.794]  And we bring you the very best gravity-fed systems.
[00:56:50.834 --> 00:56:54.417]  Everybody should be filtering their water and the best systems for your showers, for your bathtubs.

[00:58:24.778 --> 00:58:26.440]  And CNN is a terrorist organization.
[00:58:26.821 --> 00:58:29.064]  It's important to exercise your free speech in their face.
[00:58:29.604 --> 00:58:32.088]  More importantly, to meet like-minded patriots in your area.
[00:58:32.148 --> 00:58:33.269]  It's an amazing fabric.
[00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.891]  Super high quality, the new shirt.
[00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:35.372]  I really love it.
[00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:47.556]  Okay, hour number two with special guests and more inside the imploding Vatican pedophile rings as more enemy forces hit the dirt and as we score more decisive mass wins.
[00:58:47.576 --> 00:58:50.977]  You're gonna really get sick of winning, winning, winning, winning.
[00:58:53.743 --> 00:58:56.667]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[00:58:57.548 --> 00:58:58.989]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.291]  It is rampant out there.
[00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:02.153]  Here are some of its main exhibitors.
[00:59:03.074 --> 00:59:03.915]  Barack Obama.
[00:59:04.536 --> 00:59:11.083]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against.
[00:59:11.424 --> 00:59:12.425]  Washington fat cats.
[00:59:12.645 --> 00:59:13.987]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[00:59:14.187 --> 00:59:15.408]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[00:59:15.668 --> 00:59:20.974]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because of the healthcare bill he lied about.
[00:59:21.235 --> 00:59:22.396]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:59:22.576 --> 00:59:25.119]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[00:59:25.399 --> 00:59:30.445]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[00:59:31.525 --> 00:59:38.209]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[00:59:38.489 --> 00:59:47.553]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife under investigation for bank fraud.
[00:59:47.673 --> 00:59:49.334]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.
[00:59:49.634 --> 00:59:51.795]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:52.075 --> 00:59:52.956]  This is Owen Schroer.
[00:59:55.959 --> 01:00:00.061]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:01.902]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:10.346]  We are on the march.
[01:00:10.466 --> 01:00:14.288]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:17.029]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.131 --> 01:00:23.512]  Look at this headline up on Infowars.com from RT.
[01:00:23.652 --> 01:00:26.533]  Ooh, criminal investigations in Congress.
[01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:29.934]  FBI criminally investigating.
[01:00:29.954 --> 01:00:31.535]  Look, I posted an RT story.
[01:00:32.615 --> 01:00:37.717]  Anti-Trump feminist tells companies not to ensure Russian ambassador's life.
[01:00:38.257 --> 01:00:41.698]  Intense Russophobia has overwhelmed U.S.
[01:00:42.898 --> 01:00:45.119]  response to the Kremlin.
[01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:54.069]  And it goes on to have the left saying, don't even, you know, do business with Russians.
[01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.352]  They're all just devils.
[01:00:56.054 --> 01:00:57.477]  Talk about scapegoats.
[01:00:57.557 --> 01:00:58.098]  Talk about...
[01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:01.362]  Xenophobia!
[01:01:01.442 --> 01:01:02.663]  Talk about stereotypes!
[01:01:02.703 --> 01:01:04.164]  Just talk about ridiculous!
[01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:14.854]  I'm going to stop talking about this soon, because we've got big Vatican news coming up with Leo Zagami, and also Craig Scheuer, former Navy SEAL with the Dev Group, and TV host and expert.
[01:01:14.874 --> 01:01:22.822]  He's been watching investigations of the pedophile networks, the big busts that are going on, and the fact that once the police bust them, the media won't cover it.
[01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:24.263]  In fact, guys, I meant to do this.
[01:01:24.283 --> 01:01:25.724]  Will you print me the LA Times?
[01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:34.285]  The KTLA and all that about, you know, the hundreds of pedophiles arrested, including kids in cages and women enslaved, but then there was no coverage after.
[01:01:34.305 --> 01:01:35.246]  There's been a bunch of busting.
[01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:41.189]  Sandusky's son and the head of Penn State getting indicted and just a bunch of the latest pedophile news.
[01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:42.990]  What's his name?
[01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:46.892]  Uma Abedin's beard.
[01:01:48.252 --> 01:01:48.893]  Anthony Weiner.
[01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:53.154]  Yeah, Weiner and the stuff we broke about the sexting and procuring of young girls.
[01:01:53.174 --> 01:01:54.575]  Oh, and the U.N.
[01:01:54.595 --> 01:01:57.896]  report about the thousands of Asians enslaved in sex slavery, many of them killed.
[01:01:58.697 --> 01:02:05.780]  And just a lot of that, because, you know, they say after Pizzagate that they basically made up, that we covered a little bit, and I just clarified, that pedophilia doesn't exist.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.683]  And then they've got lots of stuff, you know, sexualizing kids on the news and the rest of it.
[01:02:10.043 --> 01:02:11.124]  NABLA's part of the U.N.
[01:02:11.184 --> 01:02:12.005]  You know, they want your kids.
[01:02:12.045 --> 01:02:16.328]  They want to have a 60-year-old guy come knock on your door and, you know, invite your 5-year-old daughter out.
[01:02:16.368 --> 01:02:18.030]  And, you know, it's her right to go with them.
[01:02:19.311 --> 01:02:21.312]  It's the school's right to inject your kids with vaccines.
[01:02:21.673 --> 01:02:26.837]  I mean, this is the wall of fraud they're engaged in, hoping you're weak-minded and will go along with it.
[01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:30.240]  So they're going to be joining us because we should cue it up.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.481]  Remember, it was three days before the media broke it.
[01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:33.622]  We had Leo Zegami on.
[01:02:34.571 --> 01:02:36.632]  Breaking the big gay orgy, cocaine orgy.
[01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:39.314]  He's got all the details, the next big shoes to drop.
[01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:42.016]  He'll join us from Rome coming up and riding shotgun.
[01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:59.267]  Craig Sawyer, who's involved, will show his website with, what is it, 12 different intelligence agencies, MI6, German intelligence, US, CIA, FBI, you name it, who are aware of all this and are working on ways to legally leak the busts that are going on without compromising the trials.
[01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:02.689]  The problem is, gag orders are being put in on all these.
[01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.953]  And a lot of the judges, some of them are good, some of them are bad.
[01:03:06.354 --> 01:03:07.195]  It's all being killed.
[01:03:08.096 --> 01:03:10.499]  Because it goes up to the higher ups above it.
[01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:12.982]  That's why you see the head of Penn State going down and others.
[01:03:13.042 --> 01:03:14.484]  I mean, this is big.
[01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:21.495]  In fact, I'd expect a lot of these people that are in custody to, you know, die in prison, like Paterno, magically.
[01:03:21.515 --> 01:03:24.436]  You know, might have gotten indicted, but he died.
[01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:25.937]  I'm not saying Paterno did anything.
[01:03:26.277 --> 01:03:27.117]  Oh no, certainly not.
[01:03:27.577 --> 01:03:33.779]  They were just raping kids, Sandusky and others, at high noon in the field house, in the showers.
[01:03:34.279 --> 01:03:40.341]  But it was, it was kids that have had troubled pasts and a special, special
[01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:42.355]  System.
[01:03:42.756 --> 01:03:43.216]  Charity.
[01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:51.640]  Where the poor young children would get to, that had already been raped, that no one would believe, who already had physically been abused, so you couldn't see the signs, because they were already there.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.802]  They would be supplied for overnight visits with the rich and powerful.
[01:03:56.883 --> 01:04:00.784]  And now we know the Deputy Pope was procuring hundreds of little boys that they would rape.
[01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.345]  He would test drive them.
[01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.086]  But this is all liberal.
[01:04:04.166 --> 01:04:07.148]  And see, that's why the liberal publications are mad at us.
[01:04:07.588 --> 01:04:09.709]  Because they want to make it just like one more sexual preference to
[01:04:11.138 --> 01:04:21.543]  Like Salon did last year, or this year, where they show a five-year-old girl twirling around in a leotard, in a tutu, with a weirdo drooling, saying he's sexually aroused by it.
[01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.732]  Again, they've got to tell you what they're into.
[01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:26.734]  They've got to tell you how it is.
[01:04:26.774 --> 01:04:27.995]  They want to throw in your face first.
[01:04:28.235 --> 01:04:39.605]  But they pushed a little too hard with Podesta's brother in the Washington Post in 2007, showing pictures of little kids with their butts naked, paddled red, and saying, I'll show what I want.
[01:04:39.685 --> 01:04:40.946]  I don't care if you don't like it.
[01:04:41.387 --> 01:04:42.968]  I'm going to show you my deviant art.
[01:04:43.889 --> 01:04:50.554]  As he walked around looking like, well he looks like the mayor of New York who's one of his top assistants got caught being a pedo.
[01:04:50.734 --> 01:04:52.636]  They all got that pedo grin, don't they?
[01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.258]  That Jack O'Lantern, I mean I'm not saying they're pedos or anything.
[01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:59.601]  I'm just saying they really look like big fat demon slobs, don't they?
[01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:02.183]  They make your stomach turn, your hair stand up.
[01:05:03.584 --> 01:05:07.306]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[01:05:08.187 --> 01:05:09.628]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[01:05:09.928 --> 01:05:10.929]  It is rampant out there.

[01:05:22.056 --> 01:05:23.077]  Washington fat cats.
[01:05:23.277 --> 01:05:24.638]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[01:05:24.818 --> 01:05:26.038]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:31.621]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because the healthcare bill he lied about.
[01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.021]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.743]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:41.065]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[01:05:42.165 --> 01:05:48.850]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:58.215]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself, with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife, under investigation for bank fraud.
[01:05:58.316 --> 01:05:59.997]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.
[01:06:00.277 --> 01:06:02.438]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:02.718 --> 01:06:03.599]  This is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:03.999 --> 01:06:04.459]  Not a group.
[01:06:04.519 --> 01:06:05.920]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.040]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:08.221]  Why is this so good?
[01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:13.744]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:06:13.824 --> 01:06:27.390]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:28.831]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:06:29.731 --> 01:06:31.172]  Spreading disease around.
[01:06:31.252 --> 01:06:33.734]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:06:33.834 --> 01:06:35.095]  These are all parasites.
[01:06:35.135 --> 01:06:36.235]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:37.296]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:06:37.596 --> 01:06:38.817]  You have the neem in there.
[01:06:38.877 --> 01:06:41.919]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:45.281]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:06:45.421 --> 01:06:48.464]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:06:48.484 --> 01:06:49.485]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:06:49.545 --> 01:06:50.086]  LivingDefense.

[01:07:11.232 --> 01:07:12.714]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:16.420]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.201]  Big waiting list.
[01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:20.986]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:07:21.107 --> 01:07:21.988]  Nobody's got something this good.
[01:07:22.228 --> 01:07:29.072]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.
[01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:36.716]  Probiotic MycoZx contains 7 of the world's most powerful organic and wild crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:07:36.816 --> 01:07:42.519]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx and ForageLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:45.082]  10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:51.288]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago now it's epidemic.
[01:07:51.308 --> 01:07:56.494]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on air and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:59.537]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:13.142]  We're now kicking off hour number two, broadcasting worldwide with Craig Sawyer and Leo Zagami.
[01:08:13.162 --> 01:08:15.124]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.181]  We've got the satanic pedophile network on the run.
[01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:30.684]  Trump is delivering on his promise to go after him and all the other patriots have seen that as the signal.
[01:08:31.104 --> 01:08:33.706]  Because believe me, they come after you when you fight them to engage them.
[01:08:33.726 --> 01:08:39.989]  So the war is on against orthodox radical Islam, itself obsessed with pedophilia and the satanic pedophile networks.
[01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.611]  Here's Leo Zagami, investigative journalist in Rome.
[01:08:43.211 --> 01:08:51.575]  Three days before it broke in the Western news and became a firestorm about the gay cocaine orgy at the office of the Inquisition.
[01:08:51.915 --> 01:08:55.036]  That's the internal Vatican political police.
[01:08:55.416 --> 01:08:56.537]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:08:58.113 --> 01:09:17.298]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[01:09:17.518 --> 01:09:23.640]  The police broke in and found a gay orgy and they were using cocaine and they basically
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:32.103]  We had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal, who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[01:09:32.483 --> 01:09:43.847]  So there is also an internal war here, and of course nobody wanted to show the face of this priest, but I wanted to show it to your viewers.
[01:09:44.507 --> 01:09:46.588]  He's called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi.
[01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:53.716]  And only very few media, I think only RT probably just mentioned the name of Kapozzi's boss.
[01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:56.700]  So there you go.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.824]  And Zegami was reporting at first on his site, leozegami.com.
[01:10:00.844 --> 01:10:07.891]  He's written a whole bunch of books predicting that this Cardinal would become the new Pope.
[01:10:08.251 --> 01:10:11.535]  Of course, that is the current Pope, Pope Francis.
[01:10:11.915 --> 01:10:18.261]  And that his aide-de-camp, his number two guy, they say he's the number three, really the number two in actual power,
[01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:30.465]  George Pell has now returned to Australia to face the charges of hundreds of young boys raped and then procured and pimped out over 40 plus years.
[01:10:31.925 --> 01:10:34.926]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's only the gateway.
[01:10:35.206 --> 01:10:36.186]  Then it's Satanism.
[01:10:36.446 --> 01:10:37.486]  That's ABC News.
[01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:40.647]  They are so upset now that the dam is falling.
[01:10:41.847 --> 01:10:46.428]  Trump, of course, four years ago said, we need to take pedophiles, we need to have quick trials, we need to execute them.
[01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:48.289]  Okay?
[01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:52.451]  Got to do something about these missing children grabbed up by perverts.
[01:10:52.891 --> 01:10:54.931]  Too many incidents, fast trial, death penalty.
[01:10:55.692 --> 01:10:57.592]  You got the Clintons and Jerry Sandusky.
[01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:02.273]  And the head of Penn State just getting indicted and Sandusky's son.
[01:11:02.693 --> 01:11:05.114]  Then you've got the Lolita Express and Jerry Epstein.
[01:11:05.454 --> 01:11:16.977]  And you've got We First Broke, even the day before Breitbart did with Eric Prince and his law enforcement sources, former head of Blackwater, head of XZ, whatever you want to call it today, saying, yes,
[01:11:17.932 --> 01:11:22.596]  They're procuring kids on these planes, and yes, Wiener's got sexting to a bunch of kids.
[01:11:22.937 --> 01:11:23.737]  We told you that!
[01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:24.618]  It broke later.
[01:11:24.638 --> 01:11:26.360]  He's pled guilty to it.
[01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:28.762]  That's just the low-level stuff.
[01:11:29.382 --> 01:11:30.343]  He's a Renfield.
[01:11:30.383 --> 01:11:34.347]  He goes out from our intel, and the reports we've got, and is gathering.
[01:11:35.648 --> 01:11:37.410]  So, joining us for the rest of the hour,
[01:11:38.846 --> 01:11:39.546]  Are we good to go?
[01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:05.757]  Trying to get financing to interface with law enforcement because the missing part of the puzzle is no media will run it.
[01:12:06.397 --> 01:12:12.158]  You see the hundreds of pedophiles arrested here, hundreds there, dozens of kids found in cages, KTLA.
[01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:18.880]  There's hundreds of these busts and then it all disappears into the quote legal system and the media doesn't follow it up.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.241]  You think they'd be all over it at these hearings, covering it, burrowing into who it is.
[01:12:23.501 --> 01:12:25.461]  Trump's rolled up the first and second level.
[01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:27.302]  Now it's all gummed up in the courts.
[01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:32.561]  The cover-up's taking place and anybody trying to investigate it, they're trying to shut down.
[01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:32.982]  But now...
[01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:36.212]  We're blowing big, giant holes in it.
[01:12:36.512 --> 01:12:43.357]  Let's go to Leo Zegami to give us any updates on what's happening and then we'll also co-host here with Craig Sawyer of the Saw Man.
[01:12:43.377 --> 01:12:45.118]  We'll also give you his website as well.
[01:12:45.638 --> 01:12:47.220]  Leo, I kind of set the table here.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:56.366]  You said last week when you broke all this news on Monday that your intel sources all over Europe say, no, it's Trump's impetus and green lighting linking up with other agencies.
[01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:58.048]  Is that what Craig Sawyer is saying?
[01:12:58.288 --> 01:13:02.531]  We should show you his site and, you know, show all the agencies that are involved, patriots that are involved.
[01:13:02.751 --> 01:13:06.952]  Just to understand how big this fight for the heart and soul of the world is right now.
[01:13:07.032 --> 01:13:08.172]  Leo Zagami, what's the latest?
[01:13:09.492 --> 01:13:15.354]  Well, thank you for having me back on because there is a lot of news coming from the Vatican of interest.
[01:13:15.634 --> 01:13:29.697]  First of all, the mysterious death of a cardinal, Joachim Meissner, who was one of the four cardinals who last year sent this letter challenging the Pope, basically, which we have mentioned, if you remember, in the past
[01:13:30.257 --> 01:13:31.298]  We're good to go.
[01:13:47.515 --> 01:13:58.664]  Once they broke in with the story of the raid of the Orgy, which was not actually people connected to Mueller, but rather people connected to Pope Francis.
[01:13:59.064 --> 01:14:05.549]  And Pope Francis, instead of getting Mueller on the case, he just kicks him out.
[01:14:05.949 --> 01:14:09.032]  And it's very interesting also the fact that he kicks him out
[01:14:09.552 --> 01:14:28.338]  In a very harsh way, which is unprecedented for somebody who is the head of the congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, because he invites him there, he makes him talk and give his points, and then in the end he just says, OK, your job is not renewed, you can leave.
[01:14:28.678 --> 01:14:37.741]  And he just goes out of the room and basically to an astonished Cardinal Mueller, who thought maybe he will come back bringing a token for him or something,
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:50.249]  Actually, Cardi, there was at that point Father Gershwin, Gail Gershwin, who has been for many years the secretary of Ratzinger, who has to go there and take him out of the room because the guy was literally shocked.
[01:14:50.269 --> 01:14:55.833]  I understand you're giving us inside baseball, but just talk to me like I'm five years old because this is complex stuff.
[01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:56.733]  You're an expert.
[01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:57.754]  You live outside the Vatican.
[01:14:57.774 --> 01:14:58.134]  You're there.
[01:14:58.154 --> 01:14:58.995]  You're a journalist.
[01:14:59.435 --> 01:15:04.738]  Specifically, what do you make of the Pope then firing a bunch of traditionalists once he got caught again?
[01:15:04.778 --> 01:15:06.198]  Is that him retaliating?
[01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:15.303]  And what do you make of his right-hand man, the Cardinal of Australia, returning back to face the charges of the mass pedophile ring?
[01:15:16.499 --> 01:15:39.041]  Well, all these people, including Cardinal Pell and also the new Archbishop Luis Saladaria, the Jesuit who has taken the place of Cardinal Muller as the head of the inquisition of the Holy Office after this big scandal, they are all connected to a secret group called the Mafia of San Gallo, nicknamed the Mafia of San Gallo, which is a
[01:15:39.421 --> 01:15:40.602]  We're good to go.
[01:16:01.073 --> 01:16:11.361]  And now they are literally dismantling all the conservative process, all the conservative leaders of the church, because they are, of course, progressive liberals.
[01:16:11.421 --> 01:16:19.086]  They are working... And all these busts, a conservative counter-strike trying to take them out, and is that why he's accelerating his purge?
[01:16:19.206 --> 01:16:20.928]  A. B. Will this work?
[01:16:21.408 --> 01:16:23.770]  How does the civil war appear to be going, Leo Zegami?
[01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:29.936]  Well, the war against these people, as I said, will leave some people on the ground.
[01:16:30.357 --> 01:16:34.780]  Because I think it's very suspicious, the death of Cardinal Meissner.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:42.966]  And I think also that we're going to see some very big things happening soon in Australia with Cardinal Pell going in front of a court.
[01:16:43.106 --> 01:16:46.549]  Imagine a cardinal who is number two, number three in the Vatican.
[01:16:46.829 --> 01:16:49.611]  Arriving in front of a court of law in Australia.
[01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:54.355]  This is unprecedented and it will give some definitely... So will this bring down the conservative Catholic Church?
[01:16:54.395 --> 01:16:55.716]  What's left of the real Catholic Church?
[01:16:56.116 --> 01:17:03.262]  Or will this bring down the people that use their pedophile rings to blackmail control into it as even the London Guardian admits four years ago?
[01:17:03.522 --> 01:17:04.703]  What's going to end up happening Leo?
[01:17:05.848 --> 01:17:11.769]  Well, this depends on the intelligence agencies which are backed now by Trump in this war against the pedophiles.
[01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:17.090]  If we really want to go after the pedophiles, Pope Francis is our enemy number one.
[01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:24.312]  Because Pope Francis has done nothing to fight pedophilia, but has done again and again just acts of cover-up.
[01:17:24.572 --> 01:17:28.852]  Sure, but what I'm saying is it appears they're beginning to lose and we're beginning to win, or is that too preemptive?
[01:17:29.833 --> 01:17:31.313]  Is it too early to say that, Leo Zegami?
[01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:34.662]  They're still very powerful, Alex.
[01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:36.464]  So this is an ongoing war.
[01:17:36.704 --> 01:17:38.465]  And we're going to see what happens.
[01:17:38.506 --> 01:17:46.512]  But I hope that with the help of Trump, the intelligence agencies around the world finally are going to unleash mayhem against the Vatican.
[01:17:46.672 --> 01:17:56.060]  Because even the Italian police told me, Leo, we are just waiting for a backup from America, from anybody in power, so we can go in the Vatican and arrest them.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.141]  Exactly, so we're reaching that tipping point.
[01:17:58.421 --> 01:18:02.124]  Craig Sawyer, Vets4ChildRescue.org, PedicleInsider.com.
[01:18:02.164 --> 01:18:07.768]  We've got two minutes to break, but give us your approximation of where we are in the war against the pedophile Satanist.
[01:18:09.241 --> 01:18:11.461]  Well, I think it's a matter of information, Alex.
[01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:20.603]  The American people can only be subjugated by a minority group of tyrants as long as we allow that power over us.
[01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:25.944]  So I think knowledge is power, and the genie has just recently started to leak out of the bottle.
[01:18:25.964 --> 01:18:34.926]  So I think the American public, and globally, are just starting to become aware of this pervasive scourge against our youth.
[01:18:35.006 --> 01:18:36.686]  So I think it's really all about
[01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:40.864]  Advising, educating and informing the people.
[01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:42.845]  I think that's just now starting to happen.
[01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:49.030]  I think there's going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth, so to speak, as people digest just how far this has gotten.
[01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:58.537]  And once people can digest it and realize that it's actually happening, formulate exactly how we're going to link arms and unite to stand up against it.
[01:18:58.877 --> 01:19:04.822]  Now, I want to talk to them about, when we come back, with Leo and you, about the big picture, but also what you've both gone through.
[01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:08.324]  Leo's been grabbed, arrested, I mean, you name it for this stuff, he's been proven right.
[01:19:09.726 --> 01:19:15.070]  But they've tried to block you on PayPal, on other systems, I've seen them not even let you get donations.
[01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:20.174]  I've given, when you, you've got shows on History Channel, Discovery, I mean, you're, you know, you're totally respected.
[01:19:20.414 --> 01:19:22.476]  They are not letting you organize this.
[01:19:22.516 --> 01:19:25.258]  They are so scared of you trying to make a film with law enforcement.
[01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:30.627]  But that is empowering because the people are starting to see it now.
[01:19:30.707 --> 01:19:34.050]  The enemy, if you will, are showing their hands.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:41.956]  So now the American public are seeing that this is real and that there are people that want to keep this suppressed.
[01:19:42.056 --> 01:19:46.360]  And it's quite honestly, it's taking people off with this whole pedo pal.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.901]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:19:48.941 --> 01:19:49.701]  You are fake news!
[01:20:33.414 --> 01:20:34.976]  Your organization's terrible.
[01:20:35.196 --> 01:20:36.338]  False and fake.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.322]  I love things that could be nothing but.
[01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:05.301]  Ha!
[01:21:05.762 --> 01:21:06.142]  Ha!
[01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:06.923]  Ha!
[01:21:07.884 --> 01:21:08.284]  La!
[01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:09.466]  La!
[01:21:09.746 --> 01:21:12.228]  La!
[01:21:12.348 --> 01:21:12.909]  Ha!
[01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:13.069]  Ha!
[01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:13.229]  Ha!
[01:21:35.514 --> 01:21:35.634]  Yes.
[01:22:08.943 --> 01:22:11.485]  Too bad this isn't the wide world of sports!
[01:22:12.866 --> 01:22:14.567]  Use the Schwartz, Lone Star!
[01:22:15.027 --> 01:22:16.048]  Use the Schwartz!
[01:22:16.288 --> 01:22:16.788]  I can't!
[01:22:17.269 --> 01:22:18.069]  I lost the ring!
[01:22:18.369 --> 01:22:19.290]  Forget the ring!
[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:21.632]  The ring is pumpkin!
[01:22:21.652 --> 01:22:24.133]  I found it in a crackerjack box!
[01:22:24.233 --> 01:22:26.335]  The Schwartz is in you, Lone Star!
[01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.535]  It's in you!
[01:22:27.555 --> 01:22:28.516]  Alright.
[01:22:29.197 --> 01:22:30.017]  I'll try.
[01:22:30.577 --> 01:22:32.919]  Say goodbye to your two best friends.
[01:22:33.519 --> 01:22:35.541]  And I don't mean your pals in the Winterfell.
[01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:50.333]  Pressing the self-destruct button, this ship will self-destruct in three minutes.
[01:22:53.877 --> 01:22:56.740]  All you for this?
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.082]  Yoo-hoo, Mr. Pirate!
[01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:01.204]  Oh, uh, Redbeard!
[01:23:13.038 --> 01:23:13.579]  Yeah.
[01:23:14.059 --> 01:23:21.927]  Whoever does the best meme by next week, by next Wednesday, that has InfoWars.com included, will get $20,000.
[01:23:22.007 --> 01:23:27.332]  Plus, we'll post a lot of the better memes on InfoWars.com and on our Twitter and Facebook.
[01:23:49.726 --> 01:23:50.448]  I don't know.
[01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:28.055]  There are a lot of big fights happening right now, but make no mistake, this is the first 21st century major information war, cyber war.
[01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:41.322]  It's being directed by globalists that are allied with corrupt forces in the Vatican, orthodox radical Islam, the main Sunni contingent, the socialists and globalists in the EU, Hollywood.
[01:24:41.402 --> 01:24:46.745]  But the glue that ties it all together, people like Meryl Streep, you know, praising
[01:24:48.865 --> 01:24:49.305]  We're good to go.
[01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:15.507]  ISIS, a staple in the people that have taken over the Vatican, a staple in the takedown of Protestant churches, a staple in the colleges at Penn State, the high schools.
[01:25:15.867 --> 01:25:16.548]  It's pedophilia.
[01:25:17.088 --> 01:25:17.629]  It's real.
[01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:19.290]  It went on in the time of Rome.
[01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:20.491]  It's going on now.
[01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:21.853]  And it's their cult.
[01:25:23.374 --> 01:25:25.716]  And it's all coming out in the open.
[01:25:27.158 --> 01:25:28.639]  And people are sick of it.
[01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:32.382]  Now coming up, I was just watching during the break, Democrat senators
[01:25:33.453 --> 01:25:36.116]  Flipping out on CNN, going, this is incredibly serious.
[01:25:36.176 --> 01:25:42.462]  Donald Jr., Russians did influence the election because they met with one lady who wanted to talk about sanctions.
[01:25:42.482 --> 01:25:46.146]  They're like, no, we want to talk about Russian connections to Hillary, which are now confirmed.
[01:25:46.666 --> 01:25:47.567]  That's Donald Jr.
[01:25:47.607 --> 01:25:50.470]  doing his job so that he's trying to find Russian spies.
[01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.891]  He's now a Russian spy.
[01:25:52.392 --> 01:25:53.133]  So that's coming up.
[01:25:53.233 --> 01:25:55.795]  All these wars tie together.
[01:25:56.856 --> 01:25:56.996]  Now,
[01:25:57.947 --> 01:26:05.129]  We're talking to Craig Sawyer, tacticalinsider.com, former Navy SEAL patriot, and we also have Leo Zagami, leozagami.com.
[01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.809]  This is a brief segment, so I want to get quick comments from both of you.
[01:26:08.589 --> 01:26:15.651]  Going back to Craig Sawyer, talking to your sources, I know you want to get into ongoing investigations and things, but in general, the PETO's know they're under attack.
[01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:18.931]  They know their first and second lines are getting arrested all over the world.
[01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:20.312]  Australia, you name it.
[01:26:20.332 --> 01:26:21.052]  This is global.
[01:26:23.132 --> 01:26:24.453]  What's the intel from your sources?
[01:26:24.473 --> 01:26:26.433]  How's the war against these people going?
[01:26:28.103 --> 01:26:29.483]  Well, it's going well.
[01:26:30.124 --> 01:26:42.087]  I'd like it if there would be a little bit more acknowledgement by the President publicly, so that those that don't have access to it can kind of recognize that this is happening.
[01:26:42.127 --> 01:26:45.268]  There are reports out there, but it's not mainstreamed so much.
[01:26:45.288 --> 01:26:49.710]  So I think that would be tremendously helpful if he'd just say, hey, yeah, this is what we're doing.
[01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:53.211]  There are a lot of arrests made, and just kind of give a little nod of acknowledgement to that.
[01:26:54.011 --> 01:26:59.594]  But a lot of good people working very hard and I think though more importantly that swamp's got to be drained Alex.
[01:26:59.855 --> 01:27:07.859]  A lot of it, a lot of the federal system does not yet work well because there's so many that are involved that are causing log jams in these investigations.
[01:27:07.879 --> 01:27:16.044]  So I think the sooner that swamp gets drained from the top, the sooner we can have a cascading success rate of
[01:27:17.937 --> 01:27:22.661]  Legitimizing these agencies and being more effective with these investigations and arrests.
[01:27:22.921 --> 01:27:24.082]  The bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:25.483]  The bottom of the swamp.
[01:27:25.983 --> 01:27:31.027]  We saw 474 arrested, 28 sexually exploited children, many of them found in cages.
[01:27:31.107 --> 01:27:33.849]  KTL-5, that was back in early...
[01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:35.390]  February.
[01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:36.831]  February 1st.
[01:27:37.311 --> 01:27:39.252]  No coverage of that after that ever.
[01:27:39.552 --> 01:27:40.632]  We sent reporters there.
[01:27:41.593 --> 01:27:44.734]  The LA County said we're not allowed to talk.
[01:27:45.054 --> 01:27:46.715]  There's a total shutdown from our sources.
[01:27:46.735 --> 01:27:47.836]  They've never seen anything like it.
[01:27:48.176 --> 01:27:51.097]  That's just one bust of over 10,000 pedophiles.
[01:27:51.317 --> 01:27:51.957]  A playpen.
[01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:56.799]  Over 150,000 users with real child porn, kids kidnapped, you name it.
[01:27:57.359 --> 01:27:58.440]  The FBI busted that.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.240]  Nothing on that.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.761]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:28:02.816 --> 01:28:07.502]  You know, that type of blackout is not a service to the American people, man.
[01:28:07.942 --> 01:28:21.278]  If the American citizens think that the mainstream media is there to provide them a service, I would encourage them only to look at who owns those networks and give consideration as to what their political views really are.
[01:28:22.138 --> 01:28:28.021]  And understand that they're not going to inform the American public in a way that empowers us.
[01:28:28.522 --> 01:28:35.325]  So we've got to start reading on our own, paying attention to these reports, and not expecting to be spoon-fed any longer.
[01:28:35.425 --> 01:28:45.231]  Times are changing, and now that it's out of the bottle, we're seeing that there's a genuine mass deception campaign that's been going on, so we need to wake up to it.
[01:28:46.158 --> 01:28:50.426]  We're going to break in about a minute and 15 seconds, but what are the other big pieces of news?
[01:28:50.446 --> 01:28:52.630]  I know you've always got a ton of stuff coming up after the break.
[01:28:54.141 --> 01:29:03.987]  Well, we have done a poll, not a pool, because my wife always says that I pronounce it in the wrong way, about Pope Francis, which has given astonishing results.
[01:29:04.207 --> 01:29:14.014]  If you want, we can talk about it after the publicity, because it's incredible what the Italians have said about Pope Francis in this poll, which includes three questions.
[01:29:14.394 --> 01:29:20.698]  And the first question was if they believe that Pope Francis was actually elected in a genuine way.
[01:29:21.258 --> 01:29:24.823]  And I must say that the answer is pretty astonishing, because...
[01:29:27.415 --> 01:29:29.797]  Wheels within wheels, plans within plans.
[01:29:29.837 --> 01:29:30.637]  Stay with us.
[01:29:56.514 --> 01:29:59.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.817 --> 01:30:07.359]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:13.861]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.261 --> 01:30:17.063]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:17.423 --> 01:30:20.464]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:20.644 --> 01:30:24.086]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.426 --> 01:30:24.866]  The left
[01:30:26.026 --> 01:30:35.849]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:38.309]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:38.789 --> 01:30:42.650]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:50.772]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:51.032 --> 01:30:53.713]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[01:30:54.133 --> 01:30:57.279]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.339 --> 01:30:59.042]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.202 --> 01:31:00.384]  It's available right now.
[01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.909]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:03.965 --> 01:31:09.832]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:31:10.032 --> 01:31:11.254]  The contest is simple.
[01:31:11.554 --> 01:31:16.800]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.189]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:31:24.329 --> 01:31:30.911]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:40.874]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:31:41.074 --> 01:31:48.617]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:31:48.817 --> 01:31:58.748]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:31:58.908 --> 01:32:02.232]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[01:32:02.252 --> 01:32:03.213]  This is Kit Daniels.

[01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:27.128]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[01:32:27.248 --> 01:32:31.452]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[01:32:31.872 --> 01:32:37.496]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[01:32:37.936 --> 01:32:43.260]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal and you got yourself an entire meal.

[01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:19.212]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:33:19.692 --> 01:33:23.634]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:30.858 --> 01:33:32.079]  Oh, we're riding on the storm.
[01:33:32.099 --> 01:33:35.600]  Big time.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.582]  That's why you see North Korea out of control all of a sudden.
[01:33:39.602 --> 01:33:40.323]  That's why you see
[01:33:42.931 --> 01:33:47.075]  Top Abe the Pope, number two, number three guy, depending on how you look at it.
[01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.977]  Busted running, giant child kidnapping, rape gangs.
[01:33:51.398 --> 01:33:55.001]  Now going under criminal charges today in Australia, turning himself in to the police.
[01:33:57.383 --> 01:33:58.024]  It's amazing.
[01:33:59.019 --> 01:34:05.783]  That's why you see them claiming this Russia investigation over Trump and then his son putting out his emails and they say, why'd he dox himself?
[01:34:06.163 --> 01:34:07.264]  Because he didn't do anything.
[01:34:07.784 --> 01:34:08.885]  They met with thousands of people.
[01:34:08.905 --> 01:34:10.065]  Of course they met with some Russian lawyer.
[01:34:10.286 --> 01:34:11.806]  Do you have evidence she's working with the Russians?
[01:34:12.247 --> 01:34:14.108]  That's what Hillary was running around trying to get stuff on Trump.
[01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.089]  But again, that's collusion.
[01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:25.514]  Like, I saw a Russian once or a person born in Russia out of 80-something people here in my office, an Army vet, great patriot, works in my office.
[01:34:25.554 --> 01:34:27.035]  My gosh, we're under suspicion.
[01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:28.216]  A Russian works here.
[01:34:31.325 --> 01:34:33.147]  Melania is from Eastern Europe, you can't trust her.
[01:34:35.349 --> 01:34:37.251]  This is the mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:39.894 --> 01:34:45.801]  This is the total mental illness, and now he's released the emails, and you look at them, and it's a ten minute meeting.
[01:34:47.236 --> 01:34:50.277]  It's nothing, but they're the ones that have the Russian connections.
[01:34:50.297 --> 01:34:57.659]  We're going to tie all this together here in just a moment with Craig Sawyer, former Navy SEAL and Patriot, and obviously TV host and tactical trainer.
[01:34:57.899 --> 01:35:00.279]  Petitclinsutter.com, vets4childrescue.org.
[01:35:00.339 --> 01:35:03.700]  We'll get more into how they tried to shut him down and where the fight's going.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.941]  Leo Zagami, leozagami.com, investigative journalist in Rome.
[01:35:06.961 --> 01:35:13.723]  I want to both talk about stuff they've been through trying to cover the pedophiles, because that's when you really know how much power they've got, when all hell
[01:35:14.443 --> 01:35:18.927]  Breaks loose right as they're trying to normalize pedophilia, you know, just the last few years.
[01:35:19.368 --> 01:35:23.772]  We're really kind of messing up their oatmeal here.
[01:35:23.812 --> 01:35:28.716]  We're kind of, you know, pissing in their Cheerios because this is supposed to be their big coming out now.
[01:35:29.737 --> 01:35:32.700]  And I've got news today where they're trying to sexualize small children in the news.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:33.881]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:35:33.941 --> 01:35:34.262]  Briefly.
[01:35:35.575 --> 01:35:36.416]  We're listener-supported.
[01:35:36.436 --> 01:35:37.657]  We're not funded by the Russians.
[01:35:38.038 --> 01:35:39.419]  We're not funded by the Easter Bunny.

[01:35:43.724 --> 01:35:50.232]  Whether it's CNN, it's fake news shirt, great to spread the word, meet like-minded people, InfoWars.com on the back says real news.
[01:35:51.954 --> 01:35:56.077]  Whether it is a Hillary for Prison shirt, we have a new limited edition of that.

[01:36:14.411 --> 01:36:18.074]  And we have all of our main nootropic and high quality supplements discounted.

[01:36:52.757 --> 01:36:54.879]  It's been sold out for almost five months, six months.
[01:36:54.999 --> 01:36:59.483]  It's back in and it goes great with Biome Defense, our high-quality probiotic that we keep refrigerated.
[01:37:00.163 --> 01:37:03.925]  That is 30% off when you get those together, and that funds the operation.
[01:37:03.945 --> 01:37:05.306]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:37:05.606 --> 01:37:10.408]  DNA Force is finally back in stock after, again, five-plus months being out as well.
[01:37:11.088 --> 01:37:14.950]  It's got the CoQ10, the NaArlopoic acid, the BioPQQ.
[01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:19.713]  These are the real organic derived forms of it, not the fake synthetic ones that cost even more.
[01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:24.712]  And we've got a 20% discount on that out of the gates, even though we can't keep it in stock.
[01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.353]  Just want to pass that on to you.
[01:37:26.934 --> 01:37:29.756]  And again, it's really amazing.
[01:37:29.796 --> 01:37:36.803]  Read about the 175 studies at InfoWarsLive.com, why DNA Force is so amazing, the BioPQQ, and more.
[01:37:37.103 --> 01:37:37.624]  Whatever you do.
[01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:38.924]  Take advantage of it.
[01:37:38.964 --> 01:37:46.766]  We also have D Magazine and Newsweek and a bunch of Washington Post making fun of the fact that we sell fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:37:47.446 --> 01:37:48.286]  My dad developed it.
[01:37:48.306 --> 01:37:49.986]  He's a dentist and an oral surgeon.
[01:37:50.947 --> 01:37:56.048]  The hydrofluorosilicic acid they put in toothpaste is toxic, causes brain damage, bone cancer.
[01:37:56.108 --> 01:37:56.948]  That's Harvard studies.
[01:37:57.308 --> 01:37:58.448]  Just search engine it for yourself.
[01:37:58.508 --> 01:37:59.288]  Lower IQs.
[01:38:00.048 --> 01:38:01.849]  And you need a little bit of calcium fluoride.
[01:38:01.869 --> 01:38:03.029]  That's not what they put in the toothpaste.
[01:38:03.269 --> 01:38:07.370]  We have it fluoride-free with the colloidal silver and with the high-quality iodine.
[01:38:08.274 --> 01:38:09.255]  And nobody else has got it.
[01:38:09.275 --> 01:38:10.977]  It's made by the same folks that make Tom's of Maine.
[01:38:11.057 --> 01:38:11.578]  It's amazing.
[01:38:11.918 --> 01:38:13.220]  Super blue, back in stock.
[01:38:14.241 --> 01:38:17.325]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:17.365 --> 01:38:26.816]  Now, I'll try to give these guys the floor in this next 15 minutes or so we've got before we go to break to cover the waterfront, what they want to talk about.
[01:38:27.574 --> 01:38:33.296]  Dealing with the pedophile empire being drug out in the open, literally in big trouble, the Vatican reeling.
[01:38:33.716 --> 01:38:34.896]  This is unprecedented.
[01:38:34.916 --> 01:38:45.539]  This is a hundred times bigger than cardinals and priests being caught before because now we know these are the guys that covered it up being caught being absolute child raping demons.
[01:38:46.319 --> 01:38:49.680]  So what goes beneath the swamp?
[01:38:50.865 --> 01:38:51.345]  Please go ahead.
[01:39:19.449 --> 01:39:21.371]  All right, well, what's behind it, Alex?
[01:39:21.411 --> 01:39:22.112]  Well, it's power.
[01:39:22.372 --> 01:39:24.855]  It's just a struggle for power.
[01:39:24.895 --> 01:39:30.581]  Some of these misguided elites are struggling for something meaningful.
[01:39:30.641 --> 01:39:34.305]  They want power and influence, and they're going about it completely the wrong way.
[01:39:34.345 --> 01:39:38.230]  And it's nothing new, but the public's just now starting to learn about it.
[01:39:41.017 --> 01:39:42.879]  It's an ugly revelation.
[01:39:42.899 --> 01:39:46.882]  It's hard for people to kind of accept that it's happening and deal with it.
[01:39:47.382 --> 01:39:54.667]  So that's step one, is really causing people to recognize that it is happening, then how to confront and put it down.
[01:39:56.346 --> 01:40:10.261]  Grief that we've been going up against, and as soon as we announced the launch of Vets for Child Rescue, we started getting chatter on the internet of people that were panicking and planning their attacks against us.
[01:40:10.361 --> 01:40:11.563]  And sure enough,
[01:40:12.843 --> 01:40:17.165]  And one of the things that they were going to go against is discredit any fundraising that we tried to do.
[01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:22.267]  And by the way, they don't know that you're a federal officer, not just a guy that's been in SEAL Team 6, all the rest of it.
[01:40:22.527 --> 01:40:24.028]  And you have TV shows, you're well-known.
[01:40:24.048 --> 01:40:25.888]  I mean, you've got intel on these people.
[01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:27.289]  You know what they're doing.
[01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:29.350]  And they're so ignorant, they don't understand that.
[01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:33.075]  Yeah, well, I don't know if it's that they don't understand that.
[01:40:33.135 --> 01:40:36.380]  I think it's just they can't, they have to run and hide.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:41.387]  They've got to try to fight to hold what little they've got left because truth is coming, you know.
[01:40:41.407 --> 01:40:43.210]  So you're saying they're cornered, they're cornered now.
[01:40:44.264 --> 01:40:45.185]  Well, they are.
[01:40:45.325 --> 01:40:46.987]  Now, it's just starting.
[01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:50.090]  Look, you asked earlier where we're at in this battle.
[01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:53.874]  The American public has not even stepped foot on this battlefield yet.
[01:40:53.914 --> 01:41:05.326]  So, I kind of liken myself in a way to a modern-day Paul Revere, but instead of saying the British are coming, I'm saying the pedophiles are already here, and it's a global epidemic and problem.
[01:41:05.806 --> 01:41:07.187]  But we've got to be aware.
[01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.889]  I've got to let everybody know.
[01:41:08.969 --> 01:41:12.852]  We have to let everybody know that this is going on so that we can combat it.
[01:41:12.932 --> 01:41:15.495]  So we've had our fundraising attack.
[01:41:15.575 --> 01:41:19.818]  Man, GoFundMe would not even publish our campaign.
[01:41:20.579 --> 01:41:27.225]  And then you caring, as you remember, Alex stopped our campaign while I was live on the air with you and donations were coming in.
[01:41:27.325 --> 01:41:28.746]  And then AmericasFund.me
[01:41:30.007 --> 01:41:32.869]  Stepped in and ran the rest of our campaign and did it honorably.
[01:41:32.929 --> 01:41:38.133]  So I want everybody to recognize that americasfund.me did an honorable and straight job.
[01:41:39.354 --> 01:41:49.982]  And then PayPal went to go transfer donations from our website into the Vets for Child Rescue account and they said, nope, we're going to sit on this for 180 days.
[01:41:50.622 --> 01:41:55.026]  And they wouldn't, they disabled my ability to email them and then they hung up on me when I called.
[01:41:55.806 --> 01:42:00.668]  So I notified our legal team and I had our legal team start writing up messages.
[01:42:00.708 --> 01:42:10.393]  But before our legal team could even present them with a letter, people took to social media and started a pedo pal, hashtag pedo pal campaign.
[01:42:10.413 --> 01:42:16.196]  And hundreds, if not thousands of people were deleting their PayPal accounts because of what PayPal did to us.
[01:42:16.976 --> 01:42:20.838]  And then within 48 hours of that campaign, PayPal sent me another
[01:42:21.999 --> 01:42:31.667]  I mean, you're a guy that's like one of the main guys on two or three big shows.
[01:42:32.067 --> 01:42:33.128]  You're a well-known author.
[01:42:33.168 --> 01:42:34.849]  You're a well-known famous Navy SEAL.
[01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:40.494]  I mean, how in the world do they then, all these groups, not say you're legitimate.
[01:42:40.514 --> 01:42:41.254]  I saw the letters.
[01:42:41.775 --> 01:42:43.536]  We publish them saying you're not legitimate.
[01:42:43.556 --> 01:42:44.837]  This is, you know, a fraud or whatever.
[01:42:45.258 --> 01:42:45.698]  It's crazy.
[01:42:45.738 --> 01:42:47.620]  No, they're legitimately in real time.
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.549]  Scared, and I don't want to bring myself up, but I want the audience to know what I do with my charity is stuff like this behind the scenes.
[01:42:53.909 --> 01:43:00.119]  When they tried to censor you, I gave $10,000, then they censored that, I gave $90,000, and we haven't really talked since then.
[01:43:00.139 --> 01:43:02.042]  Obviously, were you able to get that?
[01:43:02.779 --> 01:43:18.109]  Yes sir, that is in our account and in safe keeping and we're finalizing, probably today, the contract with the executive producer, the production company that's actually going to shoot the documentary series.
[01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:20.491]  And one way or another, it's going to get released.
[01:43:20.551 --> 01:43:22.712]  Even if TV won't release it, it's going to be released.
[01:43:23.053 --> 01:43:32.599]  Working with law enforcement, the final link was getting media that would actually cover, but doing it with law enforcement so it's done right, to actually expose that the media won't cover all these pita busts.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.240]  Absolutely.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:42.148]  Look, we've got to just walk the American public through in a practical, factual way to let them see what really happens.
[01:43:43.089 --> 01:43:46.692]  There need be no exaggeration here.
[01:43:47.553 --> 01:43:55.040]  We just have to walk them through and show them what's going to, what's, what actually has been happening so that they can understand and accept it.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.743]  And we've got some of the greatest people out there that have been through
[01:43:58.463 --> 01:44:05.489]  Hell, in this situation have been part of the healing of some of these victims and people from every aspect of it.
[01:44:05.549 --> 01:44:11.815]  So I'm thankful at the forward progress and the access and the allies that we've assembled in this fight.
[01:44:11.875 --> 01:44:21.343]  So it's... Yeah, talk about some of the other patriots, not just here but around the world, without their names obviously, that are involved and how chomping at the bit, good guys inside government are ready to go after this.
[01:44:22.557 --> 01:44:36.227]  Yeah, well a lot of the rank and file in the federal law enforcement community are doing great work and in some cases they are only able to do so much because their boss or their boss's boss may be complicit or corrupt.
[01:44:36.288 --> 01:44:45.094]  So, like I said, those creating the logjam throughout the chain of command and federal law enforcement have to be purged.
[01:44:45.214 --> 01:44:47.956]  They have to be removed and there's got to be a deliberate process.
[01:44:48.857 --> 01:44:54.663]  You know, President Trump, I give him credit for being aggressive and trying to clean the swamp as quickly as he can.
[01:44:55.203 --> 01:45:06.634]  But as you know, Alex, a lot of his cabinet are not yet in place because those that have been put in a position to grant the clearances have been compromised and corrupted.
[01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:11.398]  Expanding on that, Trump is so good about not talking about military or law enforcement operations.
[01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:17.484]  That he goes too far sometimes not giving himself any, you know, positive propaganda.
[01:45:17.624 --> 01:45:18.485]  I mean, it's what it is.
[01:45:18.805 --> 01:45:20.787]  So he won't talk about the pedo raids and stuff.
[01:45:21.188 --> 01:45:24.731]  Obviously, and I know this for a fact, because he doesn't want any info known about it by the enemy.
[01:45:24.991 --> 01:45:26.092]  They already know what's happening.
[01:45:26.112 --> 01:45:32.158]  He needs to declare the good work he and many others have been doing so that folks understand this is a real focal point.
[01:45:32.498 --> 01:45:35.241]  Another reason a lot of people won't fight the pedo stuff is they're not pedos.
[01:45:35.641 --> 01:45:36.903]  They know the pedos and the people
[01:45:37.363 --> 01:45:38.764]  You know, they're really behind him, the Satanists.
[01:45:39.325 --> 01:45:44.570]  They will really come after you, but the answer is all of us standing up, then we will overpower them, we will crush them.
[01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:46.432]  Leo Zagami, let me ask you this question.
[01:45:47.112 --> 01:45:55.020]  You're a leading expert, you've gone through hell, you never really talk about it, you know, to write your books that are available on your website that are so good, you know, breaking down the inside structure of this.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.982]  What is beneath the pedophiles in the swamp?
[01:45:58.263 --> 01:46:01.666]  What's at the very bottom of the rat hole?
[01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:20.508]  Well, in the last few days, definitely it's clear that the Jesuits and certain irregular, deviated, twisted Masonic lodges that operate outside of the boundaries of regular Freemasonry are operating in favor of these pedophilia rings.
[01:46:21.008 --> 01:46:28.153]  And the new target, you were asking me before who is the new target of investigations of the people who are going after these pedophiles.
[01:46:28.213 --> 01:46:33.457]  Well, it's been suggested to me that the new target for investigation now is Archbishop
[01:46:33.977 --> 01:46:38.660]  Francisco Luis Ladaria, who is the new head of the Holy Office.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:49.468]  Because apparently he has a lot of skeletons in the cupboard, especially he has covered the pedophile monster Don Gianni Trotta.
[01:46:50.088 --> 01:46:55.012]  So already that should be enough to not have him as leader of the Catholic faith.
[01:46:55.532 --> 01:46:58.414]  But he's also involved directly in the peddling.
[01:46:58.734 --> 01:47:01.216]  So Pope Francis is really
[01:47:01.556 --> 01:47:05.920]  He's actively involved with these peddlerings, and he doesn't have any excuse anymore.
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:11.845]  He's in the face of everybody that is covering up these people, and it's a constant scandal in the Vatican.
[01:47:11.905 --> 01:47:14.648]  And it's not only Cardinal Pell, but many others.
[01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:26.759]  Now, Coco Palmiero, the one who was involved with the gay orgy that broke in, because his guy, Luigi Capozzi, was found writing Fragrant, having a gay orgy with cocaine, and now he's in rehab.
[01:47:27.219 --> 01:47:37.263]  Well, Coco Palmiero is one of the key figures in this peddling, and he's also one of the electors of Pope Francis, and a member of this mafia of Sangallo.
[01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:50.489]  I posted on my website an article called Jesuit and Pedophiles Take Over the Catholic Faith, guided by a secret Masonic lodge, in which a cardinal from Belgium, this cardinal from Belgium is called Gottfried Daniels,
[01:47:51.389 --> 01:47:59.391]  Says that he was a member of this club, of this mafia club, and he openly says it during a conference.
[01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:18.255]  So if you go and check this video, for all those supposed journalists out there who don't want to do their work, well, they will find out that this cardinal is openly stating he's part of the secret group known as the Mafia of Sangallo, which is the peddling headquarters for the Vatican.
[01:48:20.094 --> 01:48:25.579]  Why is the Pope so arrogant to fire all the Christians and Conservatives, all the real Catholics that are fighting him?
[01:48:25.919 --> 01:48:41.574]  It's so obvious, when the day after the gay orgy breaks, and days after his deputy Pope gets caught running the child procurement centers, and reportedly raping hundreds of children, now they're saying, in these indictments, to fire his opposition, doesn't he know how guilty that looks?
[01:48:43.277 --> 01:49:04.389]  Well, in this poll that we just terminated, 2,000 people said, 84% of the total people, when they were asked if Pope Francis is respecting the morals and the doctrine of the Catholic faith, 84% of Italians said that he's not respecting the Catholic faith and he's supposed to be the Pope!
[01:49:05.562 --> 01:49:06.624]  This is incredible.
[01:49:06.984 --> 01:49:09.747]  I mean, we've never been in front of a situation of this kind.
[01:49:09.767 --> 01:49:16.655]  Sure, how did Catholics handle it four months ago when he said to the Catholic newspaper, it makes me sick to my stomach when I hear about Europe's Christian roots.
[01:49:16.955 --> 01:49:18.036]  Let more Muslims in.
[01:49:18.337 --> 01:49:20.859]  I mean, this guy ought to go be an imam in Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:21.775 --> 01:49:41.597]  Well Alex, the second question, which is the last one of this poll, well it wasn't the last one, but in my exposure now it's the last one, saw 96% of Italians equal to 2,300 votes, stating that Pope Francis is damaging Italy with his actions, letting in all these Muslims and these immigrants.
[01:49:42.157 --> 01:49:59.622]  So, now that we, the Scenarii Economici and Professor Antonio Maria Rinaldi, we have done this poll, you will see tomorrow in all the Italian newspapers, and probably even the Vatican will have to react to this poll, because it is giving us results which are unprecedented.
[01:49:59.642 --> 01:50:08.465]  96% of Italians think the Pope is illegitimately forcing on us, these immigrants, so basically they don't think of him as a good Pope.
[01:50:09.105 --> 01:50:09.445]  All right.
[01:50:09.985 --> 01:50:15.126]  We're going to break in about 45 seconds, but starting off, Craig, what's your view of this whole Russia situation?
[01:50:15.146 --> 01:50:16.766]  I mean, I think it's clearly a witch hunt.
[01:50:17.827 --> 01:50:20.547]  Well, from my sources, it is a witch hunt.
[01:50:21.067 --> 01:50:23.428]  I think it's just a matter of desperation, Alex.
[01:50:23.488 --> 01:50:35.910]  It's just a revelation of how little they have to fight with against an outsider like President Trump, who is in to actually and genuinely restore power to the American people and drain the swamp.
[01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:44.217]  The longer they hold on to this Russian concussion, we call it, the more damage they do to themselves.
[01:50:44.257 --> 01:50:49.882]  So it's actually, it's popcorn worthy to watch them struggle and try to maintain that narrative at this point.
[01:50:49.902 --> 01:50:50.102]  I agree.
[01:50:50.142 --> 01:50:53.625]  It's been toxic since day one and even their own constituents say that's why they're turning against them.
[01:50:53.685 --> 01:50:57.729]  Now they're going to have Hillary and Pelosi and Obama run the midterm elections.
[01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:00.351]  I mean, just don't they ever figure it out?
[01:51:00.432 --> 01:51:01.252]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.272 --> 01:51:01.733]  Stay with us.
[01:51:11.061 --> 01:51:12.462]  My friends, we have done it.
[01:51:13.102 --> 01:51:19.206]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[01:51:19.827 --> 01:51:25.350]  This is the answer to the globulous war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[01:51:25.650 --> 01:51:27.912]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager.
[01:51:28.352 --> 01:51:31.874]  Dr. Edward Group is here to test his greatest invention.
[01:51:32.095 --> 01:51:32.435]  Doctor?
[01:51:32.455 --> 01:51:33.996]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:51:34.416 --> 01:51:38.919]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[01:51:41.803 --> 01:51:44.964]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[01:51:44.984 --> 01:51:46.824]  Thank you, Dr. Group.
[01:51:47.765 --> 01:51:50.045]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[01:51:50.645 --> 01:51:51.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[01:51:52.606 --> 01:51:53.346]  This is the move.
[01:51:53.386 --> 01:51:54.826]  This is unprecedented.
[01:51:54.846 --> 01:51:57.647]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[01:51:57.927 --> 01:51:58.507]  Oh my God!
[01:51:58.707 --> 01:51:59.368]  What the hell?
[01:51:59.588 --> 01:52:00.348]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:52:00.548 --> 01:52:01.068]  Get out of here!
[01:52:01.148 --> 01:52:01.768]  Shut this down!
[01:52:01.788 --> 01:52:02.568]  This is not safe!
[01:52:02.848 --> 01:52:03.609]  This is not... Hold on!
[01:52:03.849 --> 01:52:04.249]  Settle down!
[01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.850]  Get another doctor.
[01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:06.450]  Something's wrong.
[01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:07.391]  Something's wrong with him.
[01:52:07.411 --> 01:52:07.931]  Help him.
[01:52:07.951 --> 01:52:09.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[01:52:10.053 --> 01:52:10.933]  I take it personally.
[01:52:11.153 --> 01:52:12.294]  Do not have those problems.
[01:52:12.955 --> 01:52:15.456]  Again, these are authorized verbs.
[01:52:15.857 --> 01:52:16.737]  Well known to be safe.
[01:52:18.118 --> 01:52:19.119]  Please, doctor.
[01:52:19.519 --> 01:52:20.380]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:23.242]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut to commercial for just a moment.
[01:52:23.462 --> 01:52:23.962]  Cut, cut, cut.
[01:52:24.022 --> 01:52:24.943]  Get everybody out of here.
[01:52:29.506 --> 01:52:30.768]  Super Male Vitality.
[01:52:31.268 --> 01:52:31.889]  It's awesome.
[01:52:32.349 --> 01:52:34.191]  Just not this awesome.
[01:52:34.552 --> 01:52:35.213]  Oh my God!
[01:52:35.453 --> 01:52:36.134]  What the hell?
[01:52:36.574 --> 01:52:39.317]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[01:52:39.878 --> 01:52:45.864]  It is satire to illustrate in a satirical way the incredible power of Super Male Vitality.
[01:52:46.997 --> 01:52:55.045]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[01:52:55.546 --> 01:52:59.530]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:59.550 --> 01:53:02.933]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[01:53:02.953 --> 01:53:04.455]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[01:53:04.495 --> 01:53:05.416]  It takes some focus.
[01:53:06.176 --> 01:53:07.438]  Up, up, and away!
[01:53:15.063 --> 01:53:18.824]  Securing super-male and super-female vitality has never been easier.
[01:53:19.164 --> 01:53:22.165]  Because in the month of July, it's 30% off.
[01:53:22.565 --> 01:53:23.725]  And free shipping.
[01:53:23.745 --> 01:53:25.185]  Get hungry to defeat the globalists.
[01:53:25.505 --> 01:53:30.467]  And fund the tip of the spear while securing super-male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:30.507 --> 01:53:39.529]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:44.270]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[01:53:45.679 --> 01:53:46.770]  This is the Infowar.
[01:54:16.421 --> 01:54:25.003]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[01:54:27.043 --> 01:54:36.045]  I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
[01:54:36.425 --> 01:54:40.906]  Alright, I want to ask both our guests specifically to get into the whole Russia situation because
[01:54:43.055 --> 01:54:47.618]  Like Craig Sawyer just said, if you just joined us, it's the Russian concussion.
[01:54:47.678 --> 01:54:49.619]  I hadn't heard that term and it makes perfect sense.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.942]  All the evidence says Hillary and Podesta and all them were involved, the Russians.
[01:54:54.482 --> 01:54:56.343]  They were still minor players, but it was espionage.
[01:54:56.363 --> 01:54:57.164]  That's what the Russians do.
[01:54:57.184 --> 01:54:58.185]  That's what our government does.
[01:54:58.625 --> 01:54:59.986]  The Chinese though are just like...
[01:55:01.101 --> 01:55:02.342]  Absolutely in our business.
[01:55:02.622 --> 01:55:05.863]  But all these foreign powers, all this foreign money, dumping money into Hillary.
[01:55:06.363 --> 01:55:07.264]  Trump got none of it.
[01:55:07.364 --> 01:55:08.764]  None of the big foreign banking money.
[01:55:08.844 --> 01:55:09.144]  None of it.
[01:55:09.785 --> 01:55:10.025]  None.
[01:55:10.045 --> 01:55:13.426]  And then they turn around and say, he's got all these foreign influences.
[01:55:13.786 --> 01:55:17.848]  And I didn't even ask Craig this, but it's up on Infowars.com right now, Craig.
[01:55:18.808 --> 01:55:27.672]  Ellen L. Weintraub, Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, talks about how I'm being criminally investigated.
[01:55:28.112 --> 01:55:29.553]  They want to call me before Congress.
[01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:40.093]  And the FBI says it's investigating me for espionage, for being run by the Russians and financed by them, which I'm not, and not one cent.
[01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:44.275]  And that Drudge and Infowars and Breitbart could face, quote, inquisition.
[01:55:45.055 --> 01:55:50.118]  And then it just goes on to have McClatchy saying, yes, we're being criminally looked at, but there's no evidence.
[01:55:50.158 --> 01:55:51.618]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:55:51.818 --> 01:55:54.219]  The American people beat Hillary, not the Russians.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.540]  I don't even speak five words of Russian.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.541]  I know the word babushka means grandma, doesn't it?
[01:55:58.581 --> 01:55:59.902]  Or in other words, vodka.
[01:56:00.662 --> 01:56:01.843]  I mean, what do you make of this, Craig?
[01:56:01.863 --> 01:56:03.423]  What do you make of this, Mr. Zegami?
[01:56:05.144 --> 01:56:06.484]  Well, again, it's desperation.
[01:56:06.624 --> 01:56:11.787]  It's pathetic if you look at it from an informed perspective.
[01:56:13.107 --> 01:56:20.030]  But it's sad and concerning, you know, from an American citizen's viewpoint or those that may not have an inside look.
[01:56:20.110 --> 01:56:26.072]  So, look, I think as the prosecutions increase in D.C.
[01:56:26.172 --> 01:56:27.773]  and the swamp begins to be drained,
[01:56:29.274 --> 01:56:30.835]  They'll get on the run.
[01:56:30.935 --> 01:56:37.321]  What I'm passing word to the President through my contacts is that we need fire superiority for the side of good.
[01:56:37.941 --> 01:56:44.187]  The lies cannot be allowed to be just launched in rapid succession without return fire.
[01:56:44.227 --> 01:56:48.010]  These subversives need to be investigated and prosecuted.
[01:56:48.551 --> 01:56:51.713]  Once that starts happening, it will accelerate.
[01:56:52.634 --> 01:56:59.496]  Fires and these attackers will be on the run and truth can prevail as that swamp starts to drain and things will improve.
[01:56:59.677 --> 01:57:02.157]  Leo Zegami, isn't it the perfect projection?
[01:57:02.518 --> 01:57:05.399]  They know they're the globalists, they know they're the ones killing our sovereignty.
[01:57:06.399 --> 01:57:11.921]  Italy just voted months ago to not let the EU put an army there and the EU said we don't care, we're still going to march an army in.
[01:57:12.261 --> 01:57:14.842]  They're the globalists, they're the ones taking our sovereignty.
[01:57:15.842 --> 01:57:17.383]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:57:17.803 --> 01:57:23.384]  But I've known in your own country they've removed what other presidents claiming that they were Russian puppets, right?
[01:57:23.604 --> 01:57:25.265]  This was first used in Italy, wasn't it?
[01:57:26.765 --> 01:57:36.968]  Well, of course, the connection, privilege, friendship between Putin and Berlusconi was often put into discussion by the left-wing judiciary system.
[01:57:37.635 --> 01:57:39.258]  I think it's the same in America.
[01:57:39.278 --> 01:57:52.056]  You have a judiciary system that unfortunately is completely left-wing and will never be biased because since the end of the 60s when the liberals took over the universities and the people teaching in those universities
[01:57:52.401 --> 01:57:52.721]  We're good.
[01:58:08.792 --> 01:58:09.612]  Thank you.
[01:58:24.618 --> 01:58:25.099]  Exactly!
[01:58:25.179 --> 01:58:25.639]  Bingo!
[01:58:25.699 --> 01:58:26.059]  Bingo!
[01:58:26.099 --> 01:58:27.080]  That's why they're so panicked.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.203]  Trump's barely trying to turn the tide with a good Supreme Court justice and a few others.
[01:58:31.243 --> 01:58:32.704]  We'd be done if it wasn't for Trump.
[01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:34.666]  That's why they're fighting so hard to remove him.
[01:58:34.686 --> 01:58:40.870]  Let's do five more minutes with both of you and what you think as experts we should do next to ensure we defeat these globalists.
[01:58:41.091 --> 01:58:42.191]  The audience is listening.
[01:58:42.432 --> 01:58:43.432]  They're wanting directives.
[01:58:43.512 --> 01:58:44.553]  I'm wanting directives from them.
[01:58:44.833 --> 01:58:46.655]  We're all in this together, side by side.
[01:58:46.675 --> 01:58:48.656]  Hour number three, straight up.
[01:58:48.696 --> 01:58:50.037]  Joel Scalzin on North Korea.
[01:58:50.377 --> 01:58:50.818]  Stay with us.
[01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:58.332]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.181]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.

[01:59:55.615 --> 02:00:01.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.841 --> 02:00:10.849]  It's the battle for western civilization.
[02:00:11.509 --> 02:00:12.711]  Even Atlantic Monthly said that.
[02:00:13.231 --> 02:00:15.034]  They said Trump will fail, we will fall.
[02:00:15.855 --> 02:00:16.756]  They will fall.
[02:00:17.357 --> 02:00:22.443]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.844 --> 02:00:28.985]  They're trying to make sure the third world doesn't have the birthright of civilization, doesn't have the birthright of freedom.
[02:00:29.345 --> 02:00:32.706]  We're going to defeat that and unite people around liberty and prosperity.
[02:00:33.366 --> 02:00:35.487]  But first, we've got to defeat the different tyrannies that are there.
[02:00:36.607 --> 02:00:42.448]  Greg Sawyer, former Navy SEAL, TV host, Discovery Channel, History Channel, you name it, weapons expert, trainer.
[02:00:42.988 --> 02:00:46.709]  He's here, he's been involved with law enforcement, been a federal officer in his own right as well.
[02:00:47.924 --> 02:00:49.065]  Fighting the pedophile rings.
[02:00:49.586 --> 02:00:50.687]  And of course, Leo Zagami.
[02:00:50.727 --> 02:00:53.370]  I want to ask you just both in the two minutes we have left for each of you.
[02:00:53.631 --> 02:00:54.492]  Leo Zagami first.
[02:00:55.012 --> 02:00:56.014]  Other shoes to drop.
[02:00:56.514 --> 02:00:57.696]  What people should be doing.
[02:00:57.736 --> 02:00:59.237]  What you think we should be doing.
[02:00:59.658 --> 02:01:01.240]  How critical this time is in history.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:02.141]  Other points you'd like to make.
[02:01:03.493 --> 02:01:09.376]  We should focus on what Trump is actually doing good for us, for all of us, with his actions.
[02:01:09.816 --> 02:01:13.458]  His everyday actions in government are great.
[02:01:13.478 --> 02:01:17.819]  They are establishing more possibilities for work for everybody.
[02:01:17.859 --> 02:01:23.222]  They are fomenting world peace, not world war like Obama used to do.
[02:01:23.482 --> 02:01:27.564]  And Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize by those idiots in Norway.
[02:01:27.984 --> 02:01:36.050]  So, I mean, I think that the same people should give actually a Nobel Peace Prize to Donald Trump for what he's doing.
[02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:40.053]  This is absolutely honest and it should be done.
[02:01:40.073 --> 02:01:55.425]  In any case, I think that as we go on, we need to be more aware and, of course, forget all this trivial that is pushed on us by the liberal media and focus on the essential of life and on those beliefs that
[02:01:56.025 --> 02:01:57.747]  We have in common with the Russians.
[02:01:57.907 --> 02:02:00.810]  The Russians are part of our Western society.
[02:02:01.050 --> 02:02:03.032]  They're not Muslims, they are Christians.
[02:02:03.112 --> 02:02:04.313]  And this is a great thing.
[02:02:04.874 --> 02:02:12.001]  Unfortunately, we have a Pope that opposes all this, that opposes the Russian Orthodox Church.
[02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:22.269]  In fact, there has been last year a meeting of all the Orthodox churches that was actually sabotaged by the CIA and the Vatican when Obama was still in power.
[02:02:22.569 --> 02:02:25.591]  We want instead all the Christians to come together.
[02:02:25.651 --> 02:02:36.540]  That would be a great thing if we have to really fight for a civilization which has done great things for everybody because it's thanks to our civilization that we have the freedom of speech up until now.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:44.705]  If they want to silence Infowars, if they want to silence Breitbart and everybody else, well, they're simply demonstrating who they are.
[02:02:45.345 --> 02:02:51.769]  They are basically the descendants of those people who were like the Soviets, the Soviet Union.
[02:02:51.809 --> 02:02:52.230]  Exactly.
[02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:53.470]  They're the threat, not the Russians.
[02:02:53.490 --> 02:02:55.592]  They become what the Russians were, and I want to say that.
[02:02:56.272 --> 02:02:59.153]  It's not just like he's piece-piece, run up a white flag to bad people.
[02:02:59.433 --> 02:03:01.434]  He's saying radical Islam wants a fight, they got one.
[02:03:01.774 --> 02:03:04.915]  Russia's not doing anything, wants to work with us in business, then they're not the enemy.
[02:03:04.975 --> 02:03:06.276]  We need to do that.
[02:03:06.756 --> 02:03:08.836]  Great points, Leo Zegami, leozegami.com.
[02:03:09.117 --> 02:03:10.997]  Your books are there, you're really an amazing person.
[02:03:11.037 --> 02:03:11.537]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:11.998 --> 02:03:14.018]  A minute and a half left, Craig Sawyer.
[02:03:15.479 --> 02:03:21.481]  Well, Alex, my father told me after I became a Navy SEAL, he said, son, the truth is the most powerful weapon you will ever wield.
[02:03:22.432 --> 02:03:24.435]  And I realized there was a lot of wisdom there.
[02:03:24.475 --> 02:03:25.856]  The man knew what he was talking about.
[02:03:25.916 --> 02:03:32.545]  And I think so that's that's job one is inform the American public so that we can unite to put this thing down.
[02:03:32.645 --> 02:03:37.171]  And I think the sooner the DOJ can can start to drain that swamp.
[02:03:38.011 --> 02:03:44.096]  The sooner things will get better, and it's got to be a deliberate fight that we can't be soft on these hardcore criminals.
[02:03:44.176 --> 02:03:45.638]  It's not like they're just misguided.
[02:03:46.358 --> 02:03:50.381]  They're hostile to everything that we hold sacred, and so we have to prosecute.
[02:03:50.401 --> 02:03:52.723]  The American public will not stand for anything less.
[02:03:52.803 --> 02:03:58.528]  We deserve prosecutions of all those who are subverting our country and our Constitution.
[02:03:58.548 --> 02:04:00.149]  Oh yeah, what do you make of Linda Sorcerer?
[02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:03.752]  Bunch of family in prison for terrorism saying, wage jihad, don't assimilate.
[02:04:03.993 --> 02:04:05.394]  Let's kick our ass out of here, man.
[02:04:06.345 --> 02:04:09.807]  Yeah, we need not tolerate those who are just hostile and intolerant.
[02:04:09.907 --> 02:04:12.268]  So, you know, that's a misnomer.
[02:04:12.468 --> 02:04:15.590]  You know, we're tolerant, but we're not tolerant against intolerance.
[02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:17.210]  So it's gotten silly.
[02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:22.413]  Look, talking about the projection, we need only look to the left.
[02:04:23.313 --> 02:04:32.398]  Whenever they project anything on to Donald Trump, we need to take a serious legal look at them because that's what they are actually guilty of and that they've
[02:04:32.398 --> 02:04:36.519]  They've demonstrated that more and more as they've gotten more desperate over the recent months.
[02:04:36.599 --> 02:04:43.142]  So I think that projection piece is something that's a truth that we need to look at very, very closely from now on.
[02:04:44.062 --> 02:04:45.262]  Well said, Craig Sawyer.
[02:04:45.362 --> 02:04:46.143]  Thank you so much.

[02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:17.746]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.271]  Well, we're now into hour number three.
[02:08:26.311 --> 02:08:29.913]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour from London, England.
[02:08:30.013 --> 02:08:31.494]  Always informative, always riveting.
[02:08:32.154 --> 02:08:33.715]  Lively news tonight, seven o'clock central.
[02:08:36.112 --> 02:08:48.125]  Joining us for the rest of the hour, riding shotgun towards the end of the hour, will be Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's here in town with us working on some documentaries, is Joel Skousen, former Marine Corps officer, fighter pilot, Vietnam era.
[02:08:48.866 --> 02:08:55.973]  Of course, best-selling author, researcher, editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com, JoelSkousen.com.
[02:08:57.099 --> 02:08:59.061]  I wanted to get him on last week.
[02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:04.726]  I tried to try to get him on to talk about the North Korea situation, which he's been saying for 15 years or longer.
[02:09:04.766 --> 02:09:08.971]  He believes we the trigger for World War Three, and he's moved his timetable.
[02:09:09.994 --> 02:09:15.718]  You know, a little bit closer than he used to say 2020 is the real danger zone because of what Kim Jong-un's been up to.
[02:09:16.139 --> 02:09:27.487]  I've talked to a lot of folks that have been in-country, people that have been in China, people that are in the Pentagon, Central Command, you name it, and they say more and more they think Kim Jong-un is really operating on his own.
[02:09:28.268 --> 02:09:29.949]  China's been using him as a puppet, obviously.
[02:09:30.029 --> 02:09:35.093]  Russia's now been getting a little bit more aggressive towards him, saying that, you know, they are a clear and present danger.
[02:09:36.194 --> 02:09:38.636]  You've got also the big Russia investigation, which
[02:09:39.707 --> 02:09:57.801]  They have the Federal Elections Commission Commissioner, Ellen L. Weintraub, who's a total Democratic Party operative, saying she wants congressional hearings, she wants expanded criminal investigations of the ongoing FBI counter-espionage operation.
[02:09:57.861 --> 02:10:02.925]  Here, I've got the actual quote here out of McClatchy here.
[02:10:04.206 --> 02:10:05.667]  Counterintelligence investigators.
[02:10:07.108 --> 02:10:08.474]  Where they want to subpoena my funding?
[02:10:08.514 --> 02:10:09.578]  Well, they're going to be welcome to it.
[02:10:09.598 --> 02:10:11.707]  I'm going to testify in open Congress, though.
[02:10:12.848 --> 02:10:14.269]  And I just can't wait.
[02:10:14.329 --> 02:10:19.873]  I mean, we're funded 75% or more by direct sales of books, videos, things like World Affairs Briefs, a documentary.
[02:10:20.934 --> 02:10:23.156]  We've been producing another one for a while, but it's got behind schedule.
[02:10:23.176 --> 02:10:30.121]  But the documentary, Strategic Relocation, the book Strategic Relocation, thousands of high-quality items we sell, supplements, you name it.
[02:10:30.782 --> 02:10:32.283]  I mean, zero Russian funding.
[02:10:32.303 --> 02:10:34.805]  But they say, Drudge is under investigation.
[02:10:34.865 --> 02:10:35.405]  Breitbart is.
[02:10:35.545 --> 02:10:36.626]  I'm proud of that.
[02:10:37.207 --> 02:10:38.207]  They lost the election.
[02:10:38.268 --> 02:10:39.268]  They work for the globalists.
[02:10:39.508 --> 02:10:40.289]  They work for the EU.
[02:10:41.892 --> 02:10:42.713]  For the Saudi Arabians.
[02:10:42.993 --> 02:10:44.574]  They work for the big Goldman Sachs J.P.
[02:10:44.594 --> 02:10:44.874]  Morgans.
[02:10:44.914 --> 02:10:48.236]  They're the ones with the Trans-Pacific Partnership trying to sell out our sovereignty.
[02:10:48.276 --> 02:10:48.697]  Not me!
[02:10:48.717 --> 02:10:49.998]  I am so honored!
[02:10:51.428 --> 02:10:56.131]  To have the pedophile apologist media pointing at me and saying I'm the enemy.
[02:10:56.251 --> 02:10:57.211]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:10:57.251 --> 02:10:58.432]  I'm not putting a good face on that, folks.
[02:10:58.592 --> 02:10:59.733]  I am honored by this.
[02:11:00.413 --> 02:11:04.356]  Though I'm concerned because a lot of times they kill people before they can testify.
[02:11:04.396 --> 02:11:05.656]  They did try to kill Roger Stone.
[02:11:06.357 --> 02:11:08.078]  I was allowed to see the medical stuff.
[02:11:08.098 --> 02:11:10.159]  He did have the Secret Service come to his house, an FBI.
[02:11:10.499 --> 02:11:11.740]  They asked him not to release the info.
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.761]  I don't know why he did, but I was involved.
[02:11:13.821 --> 02:11:14.442]  I saw all that.
[02:11:15.182 --> 02:11:15.522]  They did.
[02:11:15.582 --> 02:11:17.904]  He thinks they shot him with a gelatin dart.
[02:11:18.184 --> 02:11:18.464]  It hit him.
[02:11:18.484 --> 02:11:19.585]  He was bleeding in his backyard.
[02:11:20.225 --> 02:11:22.707]  But it didn't go all the way through, he thinks.
[02:11:22.747 --> 02:11:23.988]  I mean, this is serious business.
[02:11:24.029 --> 02:11:26.711]  So, whatever happens, happens.
[02:11:26.911 --> 02:11:29.333]  But this is... I mean, McCarthy was going after a real communist.
[02:11:30.174 --> 02:11:37.541]  And when he discovered that the Deep State was working to prop up the Soviet Union, then that's when he got removed.
[02:11:38.582 --> 02:11:39.102]  That's a fact.
[02:11:39.883 --> 02:11:41.324]  Then he classified the Russian files in 2000.
[02:11:43.763 --> 02:11:51.129]  This, ladies and gentlemen, and of course, Joel Skousen's uncle, Cleon Skousen, FBI agent, mayor of, what was it, Salt Lake?
[02:11:51.369 --> 02:11:59.295]  I mean, he was the first guy to expose how the big megabanks were actually working with the communists as a system to get rid of free market and competition.
[02:11:59.815 --> 02:12:08.002]  But here we are now, with them openly saying, Infowars Breitbart can face democratic FEC inquisition.
[02:12:08.262 --> 02:12:09.863]  But see, they probably won't let them have the hearings.
[02:12:10.343 --> 02:12:12.085]  They'll just keep having Hillary come out and say,
[02:12:13.217 --> 02:12:17.399]  Infowars advised the Russians, and then they gave Alex the info.
[02:12:17.759 --> 02:12:19.459]  Because the Russians couldn't figure out how to do this.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:27.422]  It's such a fraud to say we couldn't restore our country, we couldn't reboot America, we couldn't promote free market versus communism.
[02:12:28.103 --> 02:12:31.164]  It should be easy selling snow cones in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
[02:12:32.168 --> 02:12:35.232]  Venezuela, North Korea, Communist China, Russia.
[02:12:35.512 --> 02:12:37.014]  I mean, who would want to live under this?
[02:12:37.815 --> 02:12:39.477]  And they just can't believe they lost.
[02:12:39.517 --> 02:12:42.241]  And now they want Hillary to be the head of the Democratic Party in 2018.
[02:12:42.281 --> 02:12:44.984]  Along with Pelosi.
[02:12:45.104 --> 02:12:45.765]  Won't step down.
[02:12:46.025 --> 02:12:46.926]  Or Maxine Waters.
[02:12:47.327 --> 02:12:48.508]  Totally disconnected.
[02:12:49.289 --> 02:12:53.570]  Hubris and arrogance, I think, is one of our greatest pluses they have, but also one of the great dangers.
[02:12:54.011 --> 02:13:00.653]  So, we've got this whole traffic to North Korea, the big Vatican scandal, the Russia scandal, all of this swirling around.
[02:13:00.693 --> 02:13:04.254]  Joel Skousen always has really thought-provoking, deep analysis of this.
[02:13:04.514 --> 02:13:10.136]  He's welcome to tackle any of those big points first, or if he's got a wild card he wants to bring up, that's fine.
[02:13:10.396 --> 02:13:11.496]  Joel, great to have you here with us.
[02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:13.037]  Didn't know you were working with the Russians, did you?
[02:13:15.595 --> 02:13:16.515]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:13:16.936 --> 02:13:30.580]  Let me comment on this latest Russian scandal because there's something very, very strange about it in the sense that the lawyer, too young to be involved with the high-level government thing like people are claiming.
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.381]  In any case, Ms.
[02:13:34.421 --> 02:13:38.042]  Natalia Velenskaya is, in fact,
[02:13:39.142 --> 02:13:44.046]  You know, claimed that she had information about Russian involvement in the Clinton campaign.
[02:13:44.446 --> 02:13:50.732]  Now, if she were representing Russia, why would she point the finger at Russia toward the Clinton campaign?
[02:13:50.812 --> 02:14:01.721]  In other words, this sounds to me like this whole thing was a plant from the deep state to get someone who they could represent as representing Russia, but the whole story doesn't make sense.
[02:14:02.541 --> 02:14:05.684]  Why would she point the finger at her own government if she was representing them?
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:14.350]  So I think this was, in fact, shows that they don't have any good evidence of Russian involvement in the election, and they went back and... Well, that's what Drudge thinks.
[02:14:14.410 --> 02:14:15.371]  He thinks Don Jr.
[02:14:15.392 --> 02:14:16.753]  was set up, but Don Jr.
[02:14:16.793 --> 02:14:18.255]  came in and came out of the meeting real quick.
[02:14:18.475 --> 02:14:21.159]  He was ducking in and out of meetings trying to find dirt on Hillary.
[02:14:21.319 --> 02:14:22.561]  That's what you do in a campaign.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.461]  No, no, that's right.
[02:14:24.921 --> 02:14:25.982]  But I think he was set up.
[02:14:26.082 --> 02:14:33.469]  I think he was set up by, you know, the deep state working through this bygone producer from Britain.
[02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:36.392]  I mean, who has access to the Trump campaign?
[02:14:37.073 --> 02:14:43.860]  You know, good people like us don't have access, but some screwball producer and then he comes up with, you know,
[02:14:45.762 --> 02:14:46.602]  He's released emails.
[02:14:46.642 --> 02:14:47.764]  They tricked him into the meeting.
[02:14:47.804 --> 02:14:49.305]  He knew it was Bull and got out.
[02:14:49.646 --> 02:14:50.947]  He said, I'm not talking about sanctions.
[02:14:51.247 --> 02:14:54.231]  I want to know about Russian spies, which is what any citizen should do.
[02:14:56.155 --> 02:15:00.237]  Well, there's the story, of course, of all the leaks of the actual emails within the White House.
[02:15:00.297 --> 02:15:03.939]  I mean, Trump ought to be livid about the fact that these leaks are going on now.
[02:15:04.279 --> 02:15:06.900]  They may not, in fact, be coming out of the administration.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:16.725]  They may be coming out of the NSA directly, who monitors all everybody's emails and then fed to them as to the New York Times as if they are from that.
[02:15:16.805 --> 02:15:25.329]  But this is just it's amazing how the media can continue to push this Russian stuff when, in fact, this thing just doesn't make any sense at all.
[02:15:25.509 --> 02:15:34.633]  And nobody in the press points out, or even asks the question, why would Zelenskaya finger the Russian government if she was working for the Russian government?
[02:15:35.414 --> 02:15:37.054]  Nobody asks the appropriate question.
[02:15:37.074 --> 02:15:37.995]  Total oxymorons!
[02:15:41.336 --> 02:15:41.957]  Let's pull back.
[02:15:42.377 --> 02:15:45.740]  Trump is backing off, putting in some really bad folks that push vaccines.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:46.581]  He backed off on that.
[02:15:46.881 --> 02:15:48.282]  He's not going after the IRS enough.
[02:15:49.003 --> 02:15:49.603]  Let's just be honest.
[02:15:49.623 --> 02:15:52.025]  Let's talk about what he's doing that isn't as good.
[02:15:52.045 --> 02:15:54.848]  He isn't firing enough people, but I understand.
[02:15:54.868 --> 02:15:55.929]  I can barely run my own company.
[02:15:56.249 --> 02:15:57.330]  You know, much less what Trump's doing.
[02:15:57.410 --> 02:16:07.737]  Overall, though, killing TPP, getting us out of the carbon tax with the climate deal, with the Paris Treaty, getting exuberance back in the markets, getting jobs back.
[02:16:08.497 --> 02:16:09.858]  He's doing so many good things.
[02:16:09.898 --> 02:16:12.319]  I mean, I don't want to be an instant gratification person.
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:14.141]  I'm going to say he's doing better than I thought.
[02:16:14.501 --> 02:16:17.923]  But overall, then, how would you score the president?
[02:16:18.323 --> 02:16:20.585]  And how would you say the lay of the land is right now?
[02:16:23.154 --> 02:16:25.236]  Well, I think he has done those very good things that you said.
[02:16:25.256 --> 02:16:26.297]  He stopped the TPP.
[02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:30.282]  He has energized the investigation on illegal aliens voting.
[02:16:30.302 --> 02:16:35.327]  And of course, now the left is going to the states to thwart any of that investigation by Chris Colombo.
[02:16:35.387 --> 02:16:37.410]  Everybody but Alaska is refusing to give it up.
[02:16:38.243 --> 02:16:38.663]  That's right.
[02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:42.226]  Even conservative states like Utah are refusing to give up the information.
[02:16:42.246 --> 02:16:45.269]  So this is very, very strange.
[02:16:45.809 --> 02:16:49.312]  But there are some good things, like the carbon and the climate change.
[02:16:49.332 --> 02:16:50.694]  That's going nowhere right now.
[02:16:51.254 --> 02:16:58.840]  But on foreign policy, I'm afraid Trump has been totally snuckered by the globalists and the neocons, and everything he's doing, especially in Syria.
[02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:05.286]  You know, there was a story this past week, which got a lot of press, even in the alternative medium,
[02:17:06.552 --> 02:17:09.394]  Uh, about the leak that came out of the, uh, from the U.S.
[02:17:09.454 --> 02:17:14.196]  Army officer and intelligence officer to, uh, you know, the U.K.
[02:17:14.236 --> 02:17:22.040]  journalist, uh, who's very, very famous, uh, and, you know, he was snookered, though, by his own intelligence people.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:35.307]  He correctly got a leak from our own people, troops, uh, actually troops, officers in the intelligence center and a security advisor saying that, uh, that Syria did not do the chemical weapons attack and the U.S.
[02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:35.767]  knew that.
[02:17:36.798 --> 02:17:42.980]  And then, you know, he goes to his intelligence sources to confirm it.
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.900]  And they realize, oh, we can't tell him this is a lie.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.021]  We can't because he knows and this thing smells like a truth.
[02:17:49.061 --> 02:17:56.943]  And so what we're going to tell him is that we worked for 48 hours to convince Donald Trump that Syria didn't do it, but he was so incensed.
[02:17:57.583 --> 02:18:04.791]  By the propaganda in the media that he decided he was going to disregard our advice and he went ahead and bombed Syria anyway with the Tomahawk missiles.
[02:18:05.432 --> 02:18:07.174]  That is absolutely untrue!
[02:18:09.099 --> 02:18:23.793]  There was no evidence whatsoever that intelligence people, who would have also been briefing Nikki Haley of the UN, that Syria didn't do it, and have everyone within the administration, from Donald Trump to Sean Spicer to Nikki Haley, condemning Syria for the chemical attack.
[02:18:23.813 --> 02:18:29.178]  There's no way that would happen, had all the intelligence forces been saying that he hadn't.
[02:18:29.218 --> 02:18:30.639]  But it shows how they work.
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:36.370]  In other words, they came into something, then turn around and blame it on him, even though we all remember those two days up to it.
[02:18:36.650 --> 02:18:38.915]  They said the intelligence shows it was Assad.
[02:18:39.175 --> 02:18:40.197]  The media was saying that.
[02:18:41.257 --> 02:18:41.717]  That's right.
[02:18:42.218 --> 02:18:47.562]  And everybody in the administration admitted that, including Nikki Haley, who's a lightweight.
[02:18:47.582 --> 02:18:49.544]  I don't know what she's doing at the UN.
[02:18:50.344 --> 02:19:04.636]  In any case, the important thing is, when people like Bill Gertz, who's a legitimate conservative, go to the Pentagon, he has go-to sources that give him conservative-oriented information.
[02:19:05.777 --> 02:19:09.100]  But the trouble is, these people are permitted to leak
[02:19:10.154 --> 02:19:12.055]  Because they never leak about conspiracy.
[02:19:12.655 --> 02:19:17.138]  But they're permitted to leak so that they can, in fact, skew the thing when it's necessary.
[02:19:17.218 --> 02:19:29.004]  And so when, you know, when the UK journals came up with legitimate leak of information that Syria didn't do it, they had to skew it by saying, we told Trump the truth and then Trump didn't believe us.
[02:19:29.084 --> 02:19:30.765]  And that is absolutely untrue.
[02:19:31.385 --> 02:19:32.026]  They're lying.
[02:19:32.066 --> 02:19:32.866]  Well, they do everything.
[02:19:32.906 --> 02:19:36.449]  Like, they announce, oh, two nuclear subs landed in South Korea as a show of force.
[02:19:36.810 --> 02:19:42.114]  Then two weeks later, it's on the news, Trump gave away where our subs were in a call to the President of the Philippines.
[02:19:42.595 --> 02:19:43.636]  And he didn't give away where they were.
[02:19:43.676 --> 02:19:48.179]  They just take everything and turn it into that he's a bumbling buffoon.
[02:19:48.199 --> 02:19:49.581]  I want to ask you about North Korea.
[02:19:50.101 --> 02:19:52.003]  I want to get into what's happening with the economy.
[02:19:52.063 --> 02:19:53.124]  I want to get into the whole Vatican.
[02:19:53.824 --> 02:19:57.526]  For more than 6,000 years of recorded human history, historians, chroniclers of their time,
[02:20:23.584 --> 02:20:26.085]  Have all agreed on one great thing.
[02:20:27.405 --> 02:20:42.949]  And it's that there are critical times in history where more happens in just a few years to change the future destiny of humanity's trajectory that happened in the previous hundred.
[02:20:43.890 --> 02:20:52.592]  And with all of the advanced technology, with all of the incredible innovations that limited free market civilization has developed,
[02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:57.472]  We're seeing an acceleration of that great turning.
[02:20:58.553 --> 02:21:09.299]  We are approaching a mass jump point, tipping point, decision point, that our species has never even imagined.
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:17.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, the equations that gave us atomic weapons and nuclear power were developed by Max Planck in 1900.
[02:21:19.285 --> 02:21:21.426]  That vision was then manifest in 1945
[02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:27.482]  When two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
[02:21:28.302 --> 02:21:32.584]  That's 1900 quantum mechanics in the human mind.
[02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:35.686]  Theoretical, then put into action.
[02:21:36.706 --> 02:21:50.853]  Today, the elites of the globe have been in consensus, from China to Europe to the United States, that they were going to hoard all the advanced technologies and keep them back from the American people, the people of the world.
[02:21:51.393 --> 02:21:52.334]  But President Trump
[02:21:53.695 --> 02:22:01.319]  In his inaugural speech, foreshadowed the fact that we are about to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:05.141]  And that's because many of the secrets have already been discovered.
[02:22:06.942 --> 02:22:09.104]  And many others have been discovered and suppressed.
[02:22:10.104 --> 02:22:14.346]  And that simple, basic fact is why the globalists hate Trump.
[02:22:14.727 --> 02:22:15.627]  It's why they hate me.
[02:22:15.887 --> 02:22:16.768]  It's why they hate you.
[02:22:17.048 --> 02:22:19.829]  Because you innately have the spark of the universe in you.
[02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:22.211]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, each of us
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.901]  Has the sea of the universe within our heart, within our soul.
[02:22:26.461 --> 02:22:36.783]  To celebrate our comeback, to celebrate the fact that our Republic is coming back from the dead, I'm going to extend the 4th of July specials throughout the month of July.
[02:22:36.803 --> 02:22:40.164]  Now to be clear, the free shipping will continue.
[02:22:40.584 --> 02:22:46.646]  A lot of these products like X2, Supermail, Lung Cleanse, Selenium and others are very close to selling out.
[02:22:47.146 --> 02:22:50.067]  But when those sell out, I will continue to discount
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:51.680]  We're good to go.
[02:23:07.625 --> 02:23:09.485]  The lowest discounts are 10%.
[02:23:10.346 --> 02:23:15.747]  The highest discounts are 40% to celebrate the victories we've had against the globalists.
[02:23:16.027 --> 02:23:22.148]  That's Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:23:22.648 --> 02:23:33.510]  Undoubtedly, this is going to be the most intense, long-lasting sale in the history of Infowars, because right now, the quickening, the acceleration of awakening,
[02:23:34.281 --> 02:23:37.524]  The spiritual unlocking is white hot.
[02:23:37.924 --> 02:23:40.927]  And I am just honored to be here with you all together.
[02:23:41.868 --> 02:23:44.130]  Because as one caller said, we're not just the tip of the spear.
[02:23:44.651 --> 02:23:51.297]  This audience of patriots of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want to be free are the sword of truth.
[02:23:51.837 --> 02:23:53.599]  And I am humbled to be associated with you all.
[02:24:11.826 --> 02:24:14.988]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[02:24:15.008 --> 02:24:19.792]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[02:24:20.572 --> 02:24:24.455]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:24:25.195 --> 02:24:28.598]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:40.908]  This Nitskia guy or lady, however you pronounce her name, I'm from Texas, I can't pronounce Russian, even though I'm supposedly this big Russian agent and get all my money in orders from the Russians.
[02:24:41.228 --> 02:24:42.529]  I wish somebody was giving me orders.
[02:24:42.969 --> 02:24:49.255]  It turns out she's connected and has worked with the group that put out the fake PP dossier.
[02:24:50.154 --> 02:24:52.835]  So, that's being pointed out by the London Telegraph and others.
[02:24:52.895 --> 02:24:54.195]  In fact, we're printing the article right now.
[02:24:54.675 --> 02:25:06.459]  So, Joel Skousen was pointing out how ridiculous this is and how this reeks of a setup, but then she's supposedly this Russian government person promising to meet to expose Hillary's Russian ties that we now know are confirmed.
[02:25:06.839 --> 02:25:13.961]  There it is, Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., linked to investigation group behind salacious Steele dossier.
[02:25:14.501 --> 02:25:15.602]  So, she is clearly a
[02:25:16.582 --> 02:25:18.344]  Just dumb dumb cut out.
[02:25:18.664 --> 02:25:19.885]  Probably a useful idiot.
[02:25:20.505 --> 02:25:23.067]  Joel, were you aware of that when you said you thought she was a cut out?
[02:25:23.087 --> 02:25:24.389]  Because this pretty much proves it.
[02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:27.651]  No, I had not seen that yet, Alex.
[02:25:28.212 --> 02:25:33.236]  But I just took it from the fact that a government agent would not finger the Russian government.
[02:25:33.436 --> 02:25:35.478]  I mean, it just doesn't make logical sense.
[02:25:36.018 --> 02:25:38.420]  Somebody has to be really stupid to buy into that.
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:43.544]  And I'm just shocked that the media doesn't ask those kinds of questions.
[02:25:43.604 --> 02:25:45.326]  Of course, we know they don't want to, you know,
[02:25:45.586 --> 02:25:49.029]  Right now on CNN Fox, they're acting like Donald Trump Jr.
[02:25:49.329 --> 02:25:51.530]  has been caught with 45 dead bodies in his basement.
[02:25:51.871 --> 02:25:56.174]  I mean, I think he deserves an award for trying to track down foreign espionage.
[02:25:57.475 --> 02:25:58.936]  Yeah, and he didn't take the bait.
[02:25:59.836 --> 02:26:01.237]  It really is a non-story.
[02:26:01.978 --> 02:26:05.180]  And so, they're not going to give him any credit, but they call it a smoking gun.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:07.342]  This isn't a smoking gun of anything at all, Alex.
[02:26:08.410 --> 02:26:16.198]  And as I said, you know, the previous story that we talked about was Seymour Hersh, the UK investigative journalist.
[02:26:16.739 --> 02:26:23.746]  I mean, this is such a sad thing when true information comes out, won't get printed, does not get printed in the U.S.
[02:26:23.806 --> 02:26:27.951]  except in your publication, my publication, but it got printed by Develp.
[02:26:29.821 --> 02:26:40.788]  The only reason they printed that is because Hirsch ended up blaming Trump for it, not blaming the intelligence for bearing this story.
[02:26:41.249 --> 02:26:44.151]  They want to make him look like a booby, and he's not.
[02:26:44.411 --> 02:26:48.574]  His problem is, he really trusts the military and lionizes it, which is great people.
[02:26:48.894 --> 02:26:51.698]  But at the top, as you said, it's just as political as anywhere.
[02:26:51.738 --> 02:26:55.543]  What would your advice be to Trump, then, as we see this North Korea thing?
[02:26:55.603 --> 02:26:57.126]  Is this a trap for Trump?
[02:26:57.386 --> 02:26:58.768]  Who's really behind Kim Jong-un?
[02:26:58.788 --> 02:27:00.070]  I know you've got amazing sources.
[02:27:02.182 --> 02:27:10.670]  Well, I personally think, and I know there are several conservatives that agree with me, that Kim Jong-un is a serious threat.
[02:27:11.972 --> 02:27:18.598]  I believe, ultimately, that the Chinese have a lot of control, either through threat or other ways.
[02:27:19.058 --> 02:27:21.981]  But, you know, Kim Jong-un has his own set of generals and things.
[02:27:22.061 --> 02:27:23.843]  I think the generals are tied to Russia.
[02:27:25.524 --> 02:27:34.390]  But it is clear to me that Russia and China, especially China, did put a handle for a period of time on Kim Jong-un to keep him on the reservation.
[02:27:34.430 --> 02:27:36.791]  Then he went off the reservation with his latest missile test.
[02:27:37.532 --> 02:27:44.296]  He's even been threatening China now, and China really has been cutting off coal shipments that they've been selling to them, that North Korea's been selling.
[02:27:44.736 --> 02:27:46.137]  So what do you make of his belligerence?
[02:27:46.157 --> 02:27:49.479]  Does it look like he's mentally deteriorating because his missiles are getting better?
[02:27:49.499 --> 02:27:50.880]  I mean, what are Trump's options?
[02:27:52.438 --> 02:28:01.524]  Well, I think, frankly, that Trump, you know, has been talked into, and there are threats by Russia and China that you've got to keep the military option off the table.
[02:28:02.284 --> 02:28:07.487]  And his advisors are telling Trump not to do anything rash, to give diplomacy a chance.
[02:28:08.408 --> 02:28:13.391]  So it appears that the globalists still want the North Korea preserved as a trigger later on.
[02:28:13.431 --> 02:28:14.852]  They want a strategy of tension.
[02:28:14.912 --> 02:28:16.153]  They want to continue to encourage it.
[02:28:16.833 --> 02:28:17.273]  That's right.
[02:28:17.754 --> 02:28:19.115]  But it looks as if
[02:28:20.335 --> 02:28:27.843]  The negotiation is really off the table because Kim Jong-un has said my nuclear program and the missile program is not negotiable.
[02:28:28.383 --> 02:28:34.249]  So what is there to go back to the table to, Alex, if the missile program and the nuclear program is not on the table?
[02:28:34.769 --> 02:28:40.254]  So I think Trump is going to be forced to give it a couple of weeks or so to see if anything materializes.
[02:28:40.855 --> 02:28:44.919]  But I think by the time August comes around, he's not going to let
[02:28:45.583 --> 02:28:47.606]  North Korea get away with more missile tests.
[02:28:47.767 --> 02:28:53.156]  I think he's going to do a surgical strike against, it'll be a conventional strike, not nuclear.
[02:28:54.142 --> 02:29:03.206]  I think his military advisors are going to try to placate him by saying, well, go ahead and hit then his missile preparation bases, the landing and launching sites.
[02:29:03.687 --> 02:29:07.748]  He could hit the fuel depots where they manufacture fuel for these rockets.
[02:29:07.769 --> 02:29:09.689]  He can hit the rocket manufacturing things.
[02:29:09.769 --> 02:29:12.611]  But will he respond then by attacking Seoul?
[02:29:13.231 --> 02:29:14.732]  Now, that's the big question.
[02:29:15.152 --> 02:29:19.174]  I personally believe that because the trigger event for World War III is too early,
[02:29:20.365 --> 02:29:29.471]  And Kim Jong-un is such an egotist, he's going to have to retaliate, that the best that China is going to be able to do is get him to do a limited retaliation.
[02:29:30.031 --> 02:29:33.093]  He might throw some missiles, for example, at US ships in the region.
[02:29:33.133 --> 02:29:34.935]  He might throw a missile at Guam.
[02:29:35.695 --> 02:29:36.556]  Even at Hawaii.
[02:29:36.856 --> 02:29:41.878]  This is important, stay there because you've been coming on 18, 19 years and never said the clock's this close.
[02:29:41.999 --> 02:29:51.224]  I agree and I've got my sources in the military and in Florida in the military and they say the word is Trump's getting ready to hit North Korea and they've been told it's going to happen.
[02:29:52.484 --> 02:29:55.466]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.406 --> 02:29:59.088]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.198 --> 02:30:10.381]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:30:10.741 --> 02:30:13.642]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:30:13.982 --> 02:30:19.164]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:30:19.585 --> 02:30:25.567]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:30:25.707 --> 02:30:28.828]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:30:28.988 --> 02:30:30.429]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:30:30.649 --> 02:30:34.793]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:30:34.973 --> 02:30:37.836]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:30:37.916 --> 02:30:39.498]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:30:39.578 --> 02:30:42.781]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:30:43.061 --> 02:30:45.384]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:30:45.664 --> 02:30:46.625]  It's in powder form.
[02:30:46.725 --> 02:30:49.408]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:30:49.428 --> 02:30:50.209]  I take this.
[02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:52.010]  This is the product that I take.
[02:30:52.131 --> 02:30:54.092]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:30:54.913 --> 02:30:55.693]  We fight the Globals.
[02:30:55.713 --> 02:30:56.573]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:31:04.695 --> 02:31:07.135]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:31:07.735 --> 02:31:11.456]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:31:11.956 --> 02:31:18.657]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:31:19.297 --> 02:31:22.458]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:31:23.178 --> 02:31:42.807]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:46.889]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:31:47.449 --> 02:31:57.937]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:31:58.737 --> 02:32:03.861]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:32:04.699 --> 02:32:10.586]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:32:10.766 --> 02:32:12.008]  The contest is simple.
[02:32:12.288 --> 02:32:17.374]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:32:17.554 --> 02:32:24.943]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:32:25.063 --> 02:32:31.666]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:31.746 --> 02:32:41.630]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:32:41.811 --> 02:32:49.354]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:32:49.554 --> 02:32:59.500]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:02.982]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[02:33:03.002 --> 02:33:03.963]  This is Kit Daniels.
[02:33:05.084 --> 02:33:12.088]  Train best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refuse to fight.
[02:33:12.568 --> 02:33:16.671]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch.
[02:33:18.928 --> 02:33:19.568]  Then fight!
[02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:22.029]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:23.910]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:24.411 --> 02:33:25.251]  For your mind.
[02:33:26.772 --> 02:33:27.552]  Fight the power!
[02:33:29.293 --> 02:33:30.113]  Fight the power!
[02:33:30.413 --> 02:33:31.114]  What is the power?
[02:33:31.174 --> 02:33:33.695]  The entire world government's against Trump and the American people.
[02:33:34.215 --> 02:33:35.495]  The nationalism's rising.
[02:33:36.156 --> 02:33:37.616]  Globalism doesn't want us to be prosperous.
[02:33:37.636 --> 02:33:38.817]  It wants us to be under their control.
[02:33:38.837 --> 02:33:40.098]  It wants to run our lives.
[02:33:40.118 --> 02:33:41.018]  It wants to end free will.
[02:33:41.918 --> 02:33:45.000]  I love how the devil sells this idea that he's going to give everybody free will.
[02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:47.501]  You know, like all the sexy cheerleaders and everything.
[02:33:47.521 --> 02:33:48.481]  You know that idea?
[02:33:48.581 --> 02:33:49.002]  It's not.
[02:33:49.422 --> 02:33:50.002]  It's bondage.
[02:33:50.042 --> 02:33:50.983]  It's not having free will.
[02:33:51.303 --> 02:33:54.764]  Finding shotgun with us is Dr. Jerome Corsi for his questions and comments.
[02:33:55.145 --> 02:33:56.705]  Paul Watson coming up in the next hour.
[02:33:57.105 --> 02:33:58.706]  Corsi's going to produce a special this week.
[02:33:58.726 --> 02:34:01.848]  We're going to air next week with some of the top JFK experts in the country.
[02:34:02.288 --> 02:34:06.350]  Really looking at JFK, the conclusive evidence of who killed him, and a warning to Trump.
[02:34:07.310 --> 02:34:10.392]  Because barring that, or them tricking him into some military operation,
[02:34:11.612 --> 02:34:17.218]  I don't see, I don't see what hope they have of stopping this reawakening.
[02:34:18.559 --> 02:34:30.471]  Now, expanding on that though, they want him to get in a war in Syria, and he's getting led by the nose into that, and Trump talked to folks I know very close, and he said, oh no, they're not going to do that, I'm not going to let them, and days after we tell you Trump has said that,
[02:34:32.698 --> 02:34:38.822]  Back in April, the last time I really directly talked to a high-level source was even at that, he said the exact same thing in the news.
[02:34:39.382 --> 02:34:41.324]  So, that's what's going on here.
[02:34:42.084 --> 02:34:43.786]  But when you look at North Korea, he is a madman.
[02:34:43.846 --> 02:34:45.307]  He's running things on his own now.
[02:34:45.747 --> 02:34:49.910]  He is threatening to nuke and I'm going to blow up Japan, I'm going to blow up South Korea's soul.
[02:34:50.691 --> 02:34:54.774]  I don't want war, but the danger is letting him get the long-range weapons.
[02:34:54.794 --> 02:34:56.595]  Why did the Clintons in the 90s give him weapons?
[02:34:59.477 --> 02:35:03.598]  The official material, the reactors, why did they do it?
[02:35:03.978 --> 02:35:06.079]  Because they said they want strategic tension.
[02:35:06.699 --> 02:35:10.340]  They want the strategic patience that Skousen and Dr. Corsi talked about.
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:11.840]  Now Trump says that's over.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:13.201]  Why is it over?
[02:35:13.881 --> 02:35:14.521]  Why is it over?
[02:35:14.561 --> 02:35:19.542]  Because they're building that region into the future to somehow checkmate the United States.
[02:35:19.562 --> 02:35:20.483]  You've talked about this forever.
[02:35:22.455 --> 02:35:24.717]  Joel Skousen and Dr. Corsi, pop in anytime you want.
[02:35:25.057 --> 02:35:27.839]  Finish your point you were getting to as we went to break.
[02:35:27.859 --> 02:35:32.362]  Because the word is, and it's from Trump, is that they feel like it's a clear and present danger.
[02:35:32.402 --> 02:35:36.425]  He's got a loaded gun to our head, to Japan, South Korea, you name it.
[02:35:36.946 --> 02:35:41.309]  Russia's even saying their missiles are now a threat, creeping away from North Korea.
[02:35:41.689 --> 02:35:43.230]  Is the balance of power shifting?
[02:35:43.591 --> 02:35:47.714]  What really happened in that two hour, 15 minute Trump-Putin meeting?
[02:35:48.314 --> 02:35:49.555]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief.
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:36:01.690]  Trump has made too many statements that he's not going to let Trump or North Korea be a threat to the United States through its ballistic missiles or nuclear program.
[02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:05.474]  He's made too many of those statements to not carry through with those.
[02:36:05.755 --> 02:36:11.942]  And because I think that there's no way that there can be legitimate negotiations, I think it's inevitable that Trump does strike.
[02:36:12.482 --> 02:36:22.132]  The best that his globalist advisors can do is to try to limit that strike to a small conventional strike so that there isn't an excuse for a third world war.
[02:36:22.192 --> 02:36:26.096]  Now, I'm not completely convinced that China has lost control here.
[02:36:26.156 --> 02:36:27.597]  They have a tremendous amount of control.
[02:36:27.697 --> 02:36:31.961]  North Korea simply cannot survive without... Couldn't they just go ahead and assassinate him then?
[02:36:31.981 --> 02:36:33.403]  I mean, couldn't his generals get him out of the way?
[02:36:34.366 --> 02:36:35.507]  That's right, but they don't want to.
[02:36:35.587 --> 02:36:41.509]  Remember, they want the crazy man to be in charge of North Korea, because it is their trigger event.
[02:36:41.529 --> 02:36:42.990]  It has long been their trigger event.
[02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:48.012]  And what better way to have a crazy man start the war than, it's not our fault, says China and says Russia.
[02:36:48.592 --> 02:36:50.093]  And so... The possibility is in our ability.
[02:36:50.874 --> 02:36:51.255]  That's right.
[02:36:51.295 --> 02:36:54.238]  They have a vested interest in keeping Kim Jong-un here.
[02:36:54.658 --> 02:36:58.002]  The trouble is, the danger is, that he can go off the reservation.
[02:36:58.603 --> 02:37:01.346]  But I think there's several scenarios that we need to discuss.
[02:37:01.526 --> 02:37:03.288]  One, Trump is going to strike.
[02:37:03.749 --> 02:37:05.271]  I think it's going to be a limited strike.
[02:37:06.252 --> 02:37:11.338]  Cruise missiles at the launch sites of the missiles, the manufacturing sites of the missiles, and perhaps
[02:37:12.378 --> 02:37:25.145]  The entrances to the underground nuclear facilities, not the reactor itself on a first go around because you can deny them access even though they're underground by burying the entrances in rubble.
[02:37:25.345 --> 02:37:29.948]  I mean, it's going to take them a week and you can send in another cruise missile later on and deny them access.
[02:37:30.128 --> 02:37:30.428]  I agree.
[02:37:30.488 --> 02:37:32.750]  You were a fighter-bomber pilot in Vietnam.
[02:37:32.770 --> 02:37:34.311]  You know your stuff.
[02:37:34.411 --> 02:37:35.252]  A naval aviator.
[02:37:35.512 --> 02:37:36.233]  So you know your stuff.
[02:37:36.373 --> 02:37:42.798]  I, as a layperson, have studied the more high-tech, obviously neutron bombs, or directed energy weapons they've got.
[02:37:42.818 --> 02:37:45.720]  Not just directed energy, but directed radiation weapons.
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:49.242]  I've studied the bunker-busting smaller nukes they've got.
[02:37:49.703 --> 02:37:50.583]  I'm not a warmonger.
[02:37:50.724 --> 02:37:51.564]  You're not a warmonger.
[02:37:51.624 --> 02:37:54.086]  Everybody knows I was against the Iraq War and all of this.
[02:37:54.106 --> 02:37:57.128]  It was a destabilization move to bring in the radical jihadis later.
[02:37:58.402 --> 02:37:58.542]  I don't
[02:38:15.692 --> 02:38:15.872]  Yes.
[02:38:33.402 --> 02:38:35.163]  Zap all those people in those bases.
[02:38:35.384 --> 02:38:39.087]  He's got to take out the command bases in major cities.
[02:38:39.327 --> 02:38:43.430]  He's got to take out their terminals on the border with Russia and China.
[02:38:43.650 --> 02:38:45.872]  He's got to destroy their ships in port.
[02:38:46.112 --> 02:38:54.198]  We've got to have a full-scale attack to destroy and decapitate North Korea, and then finally fix the problem and send a message to everybody that America is back in business.
[02:38:54.498 --> 02:38:57.261]  If we're going to hit them, I think the only safe move is total commitment.
[02:38:57.461 --> 02:38:58.762]  What do you say about that, Joel Skousen?
[02:38:59.690 --> 02:39:04.053]  Well, I agree that we need to take and disarm North Korea through military action.
[02:39:04.113 --> 02:39:11.097]  And that means all of the 20,000 North Korean troops aimed at Seoul and other things.
[02:39:11.137 --> 02:39:12.178]  There are tunnel entrances.
[02:39:12.218 --> 02:39:12.638]  The U.S.
[02:39:12.658 --> 02:39:14.760]  has satellite intelligence on all that stuff.
[02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:22.803]  But there's no way I think that we're going to get a full-scale decapitation here if it happens.
[02:39:22.843 --> 02:39:24.244]  I think it's going to be a limited strike.
[02:39:24.744 --> 02:39:27.525]  We may not have to in the sense that the U.S.
[02:39:27.565 --> 02:39:31.067]  military is going to say, to what degree is Kim Jong-un going to retaliate?
[02:39:31.627 --> 02:39:39.290]  I mean, as I said, he can do a partial retaliation and I think that's what... Why do you think he won't go do what he said and attack Seoul with the artillery?
[02:39:40.495 --> 02:39:45.117]  Because if China doesn't back him up, he's going to get destroyed.
[02:39:45.858 --> 02:39:48.359]  He cannot win a war against the United States military.
[02:39:48.379 --> 02:39:50.020]  So you think he may not be completely insane?
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:53.101]  No, I absolutely think he's not insane.
[02:39:53.181 --> 02:39:54.302]  He's an egotist.
[02:39:54.362 --> 02:39:57.123]  He is trying to save face.
[02:39:57.163 --> 02:40:00.084]  He is a blustering egotist.
[02:40:00.925 --> 02:40:01.845]  But he's not insane.
[02:40:02.225 --> 02:40:05.767]  And the people I've talked to that really know North Korea say he's not insane.
[02:40:06.067 --> 02:40:09.309]  But the point is, if you're going to go,
[02:40:10.524 --> 02:40:16.429]  And take on the United States with missiles and take on and obliterate South Korea, you're going to have to have the backing of China.
[02:40:16.449 --> 02:40:16.589]  Sure.
[02:40:16.629 --> 02:40:17.590]  Do you think the U.S.
[02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:19.451]  doesn't want to show the world all the treaties it's violated?
[02:40:19.471 --> 02:40:21.613]  Because you agree with me and I've talked to people that were involved.
[02:40:21.633 --> 02:40:27.037]  I mean, clearly, they've got energy-directed radiation weapons that are the real tip of the spear here.
[02:40:27.057 --> 02:40:30.700]  I mean, couldn't they, in a matter of hours, pretty much neutralize that DMZ?
[02:40:31.636 --> 02:40:33.157]  Well, I don't think they would use that, though.
[02:40:33.177 --> 02:40:36.700]  They're going to keep those in reserve until the big war comes.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:38.001]  They wouldn't use those.
[02:40:38.021 --> 02:40:39.482]  Will you briefly speak to those?
[02:40:39.562 --> 02:40:40.523]  Of course, he wants to pop in.
[02:40:40.543 --> 02:40:50.491]  I mean, obviously, you agree with my researches from what they admitted in the literature in the 70s and 80s about these high-tech neutron bomb type devices is really one of the biggest holes.
[02:40:51.011 --> 02:40:57.777]  Oh, yeah, they've got them and they've had them and they've got space-based interceptors that could stop any nuclear attack, but they won't use them.
[02:40:58.437 --> 02:41:00.959]  I think we're going to absorb a nuclear strike in this first war.
[02:41:00.979 --> 02:41:03.100]  But Russia and China aren't ready to take on the U.S.
[02:41:03.501 --> 02:41:04.962]  And you look at what Russia has done.
[02:41:04.982 --> 02:41:11.826]  I mean, they could have used a lot of S-400s and S-300s against the Tomahawk missile strike, and they did not use their missiles.
[02:41:11.866 --> 02:41:13.948]  They did not use their anti-jamming technology.
[02:41:13.968 --> 02:41:16.049]  How do you know Russia isn't listening to you and others?
[02:41:16.069 --> 02:41:16.889]  Because I know they listen.
[02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:19.111]  Well, of course they're listening.
[02:41:19.992 --> 02:41:21.933]  Whether or not they believe me is another thing.
[02:41:21.973 --> 02:41:24.314]  But remember, it's in their DNA to strike the West.
[02:41:24.855 --> 02:41:27.697]  And even though I say the West is setting them up,
[02:41:28.732 --> 02:41:31.816]  To absorb a nuclear... But hasn't it been the West that's been striking Russia?
[02:41:35.159 --> 02:41:35.900]  Well, in what way?
[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:39.865]  No, I mean, Napoleon, Hitler... I mean, I get Russia has been expansionist at some periods.
[02:41:41.806 --> 02:41:46.989]  Well yeah, and look, Russia has got major preparations for a major nuclear war going on.
[02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:50.091]  And I mean, look at the Satan 2 missile system that's being deployed.
[02:41:50.111 --> 02:41:51.452]  And we've disarmed our missiles.
[02:41:51.773 --> 02:41:55.135]  We've taken our Minuteman 3s down from three warheads to one warhead.
[02:41:55.155 --> 02:41:56.095]  To a Tyson attack.
[02:41:56.796 --> 02:42:00.018]  Yeah, I think, to feign weakness in order to get an attack.
[02:42:00.058 --> 02:42:03.140]  Again, the Satan warhead would destroy a landmass the size of Texas.
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:04.741]  Dr. Corsi, you're chomping at the bit.
[02:42:04.861 --> 02:42:07.683]  It's, I mean, there's a couple of elements to add into this.
[02:42:07.743 --> 02:42:08.524]  First of all, China.
[02:42:09.284 --> 02:42:11.505]  Focus is also South China Sea.
[02:42:11.525 --> 02:42:12.746]  Let's not forget about that.
[02:42:12.766 --> 02:42:21.310]  I mean, China has got its own natural sphere of influence concerns over Southeast Asia, and that's at play here too.
[02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:28.974]  China, I don't think, really wants to have a major war over North Korea, but China's not going to rein in North Korea.
[02:42:29.814 --> 02:42:31.155]  It's going to be extremely difficult.
[02:42:32.055 --> 02:42:34.096]  Always, any war is impossible.
[02:42:34.136 --> 02:42:35.977]  And if we're going to launch an attack, doesn't it have to be all out?
[02:42:36.177 --> 02:42:37.178]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:42:37.238 --> 02:42:41.940]  As you see, again, I think Trump will launch, at least initially, a limited strike.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:45.982]  I think he'll try to make a point and do the least he can.
[02:42:46.002 --> 02:42:47.983]  And then see if North Korea responds bigger.
[02:42:48.143 --> 02:42:50.023]  And see if he can't then start the discussion.
[02:42:50.464 --> 02:42:52.685]  In other words, the point is, let me get your attention.
[02:42:53.550 --> 02:42:54.850]  Okay, now I've got your attention.
[02:42:55.310 --> 02:42:56.911]  These are the things we have to talk about.
[02:42:57.431 --> 02:43:00.592]  And I think, let me get your attention strike.
[02:43:01.112 --> 02:43:02.532]  China would hold.
[02:43:03.312 --> 02:43:06.693]  I think North Korea would probably not respond in a massive way.
[02:43:06.713 --> 02:43:09.674]  It's still very iffy.
[02:43:09.694 --> 02:43:14.515]  Do you agree with Skousen that once he realizes we're serious, he might back down?
[02:43:14.855 --> 02:43:18.119]  Well, yes, I think the first step is get his attention.
[02:43:18.519 --> 02:43:19.560]  Get China's attention.
[02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:21.783]  Let them know that this is no longer the United States.
[02:43:21.803 --> 02:43:22.744]  Man, I got four kids.
[02:43:22.844 --> 02:43:28.010]  I just can't believe that in the next month, clearly, I mean, the next month, two months, I mean, they say Trump's time's running out.
[02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:31.393]  Then Kim Jong-un says, oh, it's your fault you're dancing around on a powder keg.
[02:43:31.714 --> 02:43:33.756]  It's Kim Jong-un dancing around on a powder keg.
[02:43:33.976 --> 02:43:43.988]  Well, and look, also, you've got all this collusion nonsense with the, you know, the GOP colluding, Trump colluding with the Russians is nonsense.
[02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:52.178]  What the Russians are thinking, though, is if Trump can be destabilized, if there's any way to destabilize Trump, Russia takes that to their...
[02:43:52.398 --> 02:44:01.183]  I don't usually agree with Lindsey Graham, but he even said like a month ago on CNN, he said, we have all these communiques with Russian ambassadors and people on the phone to Russia going, we have Trump.
[02:44:01.503 --> 02:44:02.564]  He works for us now.
[02:44:02.884 --> 02:44:03.744]  We've penetrated him.
[02:44:03.784 --> 02:44:05.105]  And Graham says he's heard these.
[02:44:05.125 --> 02:44:09.147]  And he goes, there's no way they'd say that over an open line unless it was on purpose to hurt Trump.
[02:44:09.248 --> 02:44:09.548]  Precisely.
[02:44:09.568 --> 02:44:10.808]  So it gets really sophisticated.
[02:44:10.828 --> 02:44:11.569]  What do you think, Skousen?
[02:44:13.069 --> 02:44:22.872]  Well, I think it's important to realize that, you know, Trump is heavily manipulated and he doesn't have the background to see through a lot of what's going on here, but he does see clearly what's going on in North Korea.
[02:44:23.332 --> 02:44:36.556]  Syria is another situation that we need to talk about in the sense that, you know, the Russians correctly, Putin in his two-hour meeting correctly got him to establish a no-conflict zone in southern Syria.
[02:44:36.756 --> 02:44:39.717]  And this was Russia's job to preempt the U.S.
[02:44:39.737 --> 02:44:41.978]  strategy, which is to put in enough troops
[02:44:42.498 --> 02:44:44.559]  The plan has always been to break that off.
[02:45:03.247 --> 02:45:09.871]  The point is, again with Jack Kennedy, from Laos and then Vietnam, the generals were always pushing war.
[02:45:10.352 --> 02:45:14.094]  Always saying, go to war, we can do this, Bay of Pigs.
[02:45:14.634 --> 02:45:18.257]  You had, you know, the generals all wanting to go into a major war.
[02:45:18.837 --> 02:45:23.200]  And this is the same push that's going on with Trump right now.
[02:45:23.755 --> 02:45:27.937]  Well yeah, I mean, Syria's not aiming ICBMs at people saying, here's a gift, I'm gonna blow you up.
[02:45:28.617 --> 02:45:31.499]  And our government helped start that, so we morally need to pull out.
[02:45:31.519 --> 02:45:36.981]  So I mean, going back to Skousen, because this is important to hear over the next three days, I mean, I want to hear from both of you, but we're running out of time.
[02:45:37.401 --> 02:45:40.022]  What's your main point on Syria?
[02:45:41.303 --> 02:45:53.536]  Well, the whole purpose in US and British intelligence taking about half of the Syrian rebels and calling them ISIS and creating this new threat of ISIS was to get US troops back into Syria.
[02:45:53.816 --> 02:45:56.379]  And that's exactly what's happened in the name of the advisors.
[02:45:56.399 --> 02:45:59.202]  You have a lot of special forces in there and the US can infiltrate
[02:45:59.662 --> 02:45:59.762]  Yes.
[02:46:18.174 --> 02:46:22.936]  Sure, who's behind the shoot down of the Syrian aircraft and the bombing of their armored columns?
[02:46:22.956 --> 02:46:25.957]  Is that Deep State trying to suck Trump in deeper?
[02:46:26.057 --> 02:46:32.479]  Or did Trump really agree with Putin in that meeting, or at least tacitly, to split up Syria with Russia?
[02:46:35.489 --> 02:46:45.282]  Well he did agree to allow the Russians to have military police monitoring and that semi-control over southern Syria and the U.S.
[02:46:45.302 --> 02:46:49.347]  globalists have got to be very disturbed with what Trump agreed to.
[02:46:49.367 --> 02:46:52.571]  So would you say Trump is being a peacemaker overall in Syria?
[02:46:53.604 --> 02:46:55.064]  Yeah, after he talks to Trump.
[02:46:55.104 --> 02:46:57.805]  I mean, Putin really did make some points with Trump.
[02:46:57.845 --> 02:47:04.346]  He had Trump going very, very strongly towards making peace, and he undid a lot of the damage of his own advisors.
[02:47:04.366 --> 02:47:22.869]  Which shows Trump has been truthful that he does want to stabilize the Nile-to-water war, but McMaster, who three months ago was on TV saying, we're going to take out Assad too, literally arrogantly ignored the president and arrogantly did what he wanted on Fox News and CNN, which shows McMaster is literally doing whatever he wants, which is not a good point for Trump.
[02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:27.572]  And remember also, at one point, Kennedy got close to Khrushchev.
[02:47:27.693 --> 02:47:29.054]  And what that did to the U.S.
[02:47:29.114 --> 02:47:32.456]  military was it made it feel like it was losing control.
[02:47:32.476 --> 02:47:34.738]  This was another trigger point for the U.S.
[02:47:34.798 --> 02:47:35.358]  military.
[02:47:35.378 --> 02:47:38.521]  I agree, but the Russians were communists then!
[02:47:38.641 --> 02:47:39.542]  But see, I'm saying...
[02:47:40.422 --> 02:47:46.108]  Trump and Putin I think could resolve a lot of problems together and would be very successful doing it.
[02:47:46.448 --> 02:47:51.053]  The military is going to come back and warmonger and going to push Trump in another direction.
[02:47:51.574 --> 02:47:58.621]  What I'm saying is a limited strike in North Korea and by the way occupying the Middle East is a fool's errand.
[02:47:58.641 --> 02:48:01.644]  I mean the best thing you can do in the Middle East is let them all fight against each
[02:48:01.664 --> 02:48:03.825]  Yeah, no, we shouldn't have ever put the radical Muslims in.
[02:48:03.885 --> 02:48:05.945]  Under Obama, we went even worse.
[02:48:06.045 --> 02:48:06.706]  It made it even worse.
[02:48:06.786 --> 02:48:09.807]  Let me ask you this, Doc, and then Joel Skousen.
[02:48:10.307 --> 02:48:13.048]  Briefly, if you're Trump, then what would you do about these two messes?
[02:48:13.388 --> 02:48:15.669]  Which again, we don't want to be interventionists, but it's dragging us into it.
[02:48:15.949 --> 02:48:16.509]  What would you do?
[02:48:16.529 --> 02:48:17.789]  Then we'll get Joel Skousen to tell us.
[02:48:18.129 --> 02:48:18.490]  Limited.
[02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:20.530]  Limited strike, get their attention.
[02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:23.311]  Limited involvement in the Middle East.
[02:48:23.631 --> 02:48:24.592]  Plan to pull out.
[02:48:24.812 --> 02:48:27.813]  I don't see permanent invasion or permanent occupation.
[02:48:27.853 --> 02:48:28.953]  I think it's a fool's errand.
[02:48:29.113 --> 02:48:32.017]  Man, that sounds... I'm telling you, with North Korea, though, I agree with what you guys are saying.
[02:48:32.057 --> 02:48:33.459]  That tends to be what'll probably happen.
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:37.284]  But what about rolling the dice with this guy?
[02:48:37.584 --> 02:48:39.527]  Just letting him have that military in place?
[02:48:39.567 --> 02:48:41.289]  We always can do that if it doesn't work.
[02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:42.070]  That's the backup.
[02:48:42.171 --> 02:48:45.054]  If it doesn't work, it's... I'm gonna get your attention now.
[02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:47.557]  We're polite to you to try to get your attention.
[02:48:47.597 --> 02:48:49.138]  If you don't want to do that, we'll go the other way.
[02:48:49.158 --> 02:48:51.100]  Well, that's another question for Joe Skousen.
[02:48:51.481 --> 02:48:53.963]  And then expanding on that question of what would you do if you were Trump?
[02:48:54.363 --> 02:49:02.891]  Do we have the forces in place that aren't the secret weapons to take out much of the North Korean military that's concentrated along the DMZ?
[02:49:02.991 --> 02:49:05.233]  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[02:49:05.794 --> 02:49:09.337]  You might have to use tactical nukes to do the broad area weapons or
[02:49:11.027 --> 02:49:13.649]  But clearly, I think there's going to be a two-stage approach.
[02:49:13.909 --> 02:49:22.955]  What I would recommend, one, hit him in a minimal thing, first of all, to not just make a statement, but to incapacitate his nuclear and his missile program.
[02:49:23.395 --> 02:49:24.256]  Watch him react.
[02:49:24.696 --> 02:49:27.098]  Use the reaction to take out the rest of his military.
[02:49:27.538 --> 02:49:32.402]  I would not go in with a first strike without preparing... Of course, that's true.
[02:49:32.422 --> 02:49:35.704]  He's got so many decoys, the first strike lures out the real weapons.
[02:49:36.625 --> 02:49:37.705]  Yes, and then take them out.
[02:49:38.586 --> 02:49:40.147]  Kim Jong-un needs to be defanged.
[02:49:40.678 --> 02:49:48.162]  In Syria, what I would do is get Trump to stop all aid to the Syrian rebels whatsoever.
[02:49:48.602 --> 02:49:49.163]  Agreed.
[02:49:49.183 --> 02:49:49.763]  Please.
[02:49:49.783 --> 02:49:51.444]  Let the Assad take care of it.
[02:49:51.504 --> 02:49:54.805]  But I would also say, you know, Iran is not the enemy.
[02:49:54.865 --> 02:50:01.149]  The globalists, the neocons, are trying to take out Syria as a prelude to taking out Iran.
[02:50:01.489 --> 02:50:03.150]  The entire nuclear agreement
[02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:04.411]  It's a trap.
[02:50:04.731 --> 02:50:07.654]  It isn't a giveaway to Iran.
[02:50:07.734 --> 02:50:15.100]  In fact, it has got so many gotchas in it that allows the Security Council to declare war against Iran at any time the U.S.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:22.206]  decides that Syria is destabilized enough that we can go ahead and take Iran without Syria being a retaliatory threat to Israel.
[02:50:23.404 --> 02:50:24.145]  Doc, do you agree with that?
[02:50:42.108 --> 02:50:54.096]  Go through a process of containing Iran and going through a process of letting Iran know if they do develop a nuclear weapon, if they get to the point where North Korea is today, then they're going to go down the same path.
[02:50:54.356 --> 02:50:55.116]  Let me ask you this.
[02:50:55.156 --> 02:50:57.498]  What do you guys think Trump's Saudi visit was about?
[02:50:57.878 --> 02:51:00.320]  And then why did all the Islamic terror kick off once he went there?
[02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:01.400]  He'll be right back.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:01.961]  Stay with us.
[02:51:09.198 --> 02:51:11.380]  Joining us now is Mark Dice.
[02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:13.302]  I'm sure you know all about him by now.
[02:51:13.362 --> 02:51:16.204]  Just reached over a million subscribers on YouTube.
[02:51:16.564 --> 02:51:17.745]  New videos every day.
[02:51:17.765 --> 02:51:18.866]  He's also an author.
[02:51:18.986 --> 02:51:22.189]  His latest book is The Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[02:51:22.529 --> 02:51:26.092]  I don't know how much longer they can cling on to this conspiracy theory about Russia.
[02:51:26.112 --> 02:51:27.994]  I mean, they might drag it on another few months.
[02:51:28.174 --> 02:51:30.316]  It's been seven months now since
[02:51:32.381 --> 02:51:34.964]  You don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something.
[02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:35.804]  Is that a fair statement?
[02:51:35.824 --> 02:51:37.186]  I don't as I sit here.
[02:51:37.206 --> 02:51:37.406]  Thank you.
[02:51:37.426 --> 02:51:38.066]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:51:55.142 --> 02:51:57.623]  You can hope horrible things onto someone.
[02:51:57.663 --> 02:51:58.543]  That's not a threat.
[02:51:58.563 --> 02:51:59.664]  That's not a direction.
[02:52:00.284 --> 02:52:02.125]  I took it as a direction.
[02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:08.947]  As the President of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[02:52:09.607 --> 02:52:11.448]  I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.
[02:52:11.468 --> 02:52:13.729]  You may have taken it as a direction, but that's not what he said.
[02:52:13.769 --> 02:52:14.269]  Correct, right?
[02:52:14.569 --> 02:52:15.169]  It's just insane.
[02:52:15.189 --> 02:52:20.411]  Even Chris Matthews has admitted that the whole Russia collusion conspiracy theory has come apart.
[02:52:20.851 --> 02:52:29.518]  The assumption of the critics of the President, of his pursuers you might say, is that somewhere along the line in the last year, the President had something to do with colluding with the Russians.
[02:52:29.578 --> 02:52:35.103]  Something to do with helping hand, encouraging them, feeding their desire to affect the election in some way.
[02:52:35.443 --> 02:52:40.427]  Some role they played, some conversation he had with Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort or somewhere.
[02:52:40.828 --> 02:52:43.270]  And yet what came apart this morning was that theory.
[02:52:43.610 --> 02:53:01.500]  Let's not forget, during some of his previous testimony at another time, several months ago, he said that people will occasionally in the Justice Department say that, quote, we don't think there's a crime here, or, you know, they'll give, quote, their opinions to us, but never a directive to actually close a case.
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:03.341]  And some of his language was so bizarre.
[02:53:03.701 --> 02:53:09.544]  Captain Courageous, uh, Oh Lordy, I mean, golly gee, Mr. Comey, this
[02:53:10.064 --> 02:53:11.565]  I just don't see a case here.
[02:53:12.026 --> 02:53:15.448]  The guy, he needs to go away, crawl back into the hole that he came out of.
[02:53:15.769 --> 02:53:19.792]  His bag's under his eyes so big, I could put my groceries in them.
[02:53:19.912 --> 02:53:29.839]  And if we're gonna go off of the intent being one of the primary reasons for indicting someone, President Trump did not intend that hoping was a direct order.
[02:53:29.919 --> 02:53:34.002]  And if he wasn't spelling it out in his words, then what was he doing?
[02:53:34.123 --> 02:53:36.024]  Sending him signals via email?
[02:53:36.204 --> 02:53:37.245]  I don't know.
[02:54:09.215 --> 02:54:10.556]  You ain't seen nothing yet, folks.
[02:54:10.596 --> 02:54:12.216]  Paul Watson's coming up the next hour.
[02:54:12.236 --> 02:54:15.037]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:54:15.077 --> 02:54:16.718]  The new sites, Infowars.com.
[02:54:17.158 --> 02:54:19.479]  Our backup sites, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:23.141]  A few other questions I didn't get to with Joel Skousen.
[02:54:23.201 --> 02:54:25.602]  What is mainstream media going to do now that they have almost no viewers?
[02:54:26.102 --> 02:54:28.063]  CNN, even mainstream media, admits he's dead.
[02:54:28.103 --> 02:54:29.083]  They've all turned on it.
[02:54:29.643 --> 02:54:35.425]  Comey, it turns out, The Hill reports, lied and it was a classified memo and didn't give it to the Justice Department.
[02:54:35.445 --> 02:54:36.186]  That was a felony.
[02:54:37.126 --> 02:54:39.267]  Everything they accused Trump of, they've done in triplicate.
[02:54:39.867 --> 02:54:46.068]  We're not vindictive people, but Trump, I think, and the Justice Department, I mean, it's their job.
[02:54:46.188 --> 02:54:48.188]  We need to start seeing indictments of Democrats.
[02:54:48.729 --> 02:54:49.729]  Finally go after them.
[02:54:50.149 --> 02:54:51.789]  This country's in a soft civil war.
[02:54:52.869 --> 02:54:57.670]  They've got, you know, the Black Lives Matter group running around saying kill cops and everything, trying to start a civil war.
[02:54:58.291 --> 02:54:59.291]  I mean, I'm not a person
[02:55:00.271 --> 02:55:01.613]  I'm anti-police state, by the way.
[02:55:02.013 --> 02:55:04.096]  They're the ones trying to create a civil war to bring in a real one.
[02:55:04.416 --> 02:55:08.060]  Joel Skousen, what do you make of the state of the media, Comey, all of this?
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:11.765]  I mean, what does Trump do to take the gloves off, or what's your advice to him?
[02:55:13.103 --> 02:55:16.585]  Well, first of all, he's got to realize that they're destabilizing him constantly.
[02:55:16.605 --> 02:55:23.550]  The White House is in constant disarray, constantly on the defensive, and they can't do anything positive.
[02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:34.017]  Trump doesn't have any time to actually sit down and figure out what's going on in the world because he is fighting one defensive battle after another, and they're going to just keep this up constantly.
[02:55:34.317 --> 02:55:41.122]  That's why they don't release any of the results, and they won't probably, of this Russian investigation, because they don't have anything.
[02:55:41.502 --> 02:55:44.283]  I agree, and don't you agree this isn't about worshipping Trump?
[02:56:04.551 --> 02:56:05.291]  He is real.
[02:56:05.351 --> 02:56:06.052]  He's not perfect.
[02:56:06.092 --> 02:56:06.472]  None of us are.
[02:56:06.492 --> 02:56:07.392]  He's under massive attack.
[02:56:07.712 --> 02:56:10.893]  We can't be babies like the media wants us to be and want instant gratification.
[02:56:11.213 --> 02:56:13.354]  It's up to us to make sure Congress gets in line.
[02:56:13.594 --> 02:56:15.975]  It's up to us to make sure we get more patriots elected.
[02:56:16.255 --> 02:56:24.698]  It's up to us to pray for Trump and realize this is real and he is completely surrounded and we can't sit here like armchair quarterbacks and bitch and complain.
[02:56:24.898 --> 02:56:25.798]  We've got to take action.
[02:56:26.418 --> 02:56:30.502]  And let me say also, I think Trump is gaining knowledge of how the system works.
[02:56:30.962 --> 02:56:35.066]  I think every day he gets a clearer idea of how he's subverted from within.
[02:56:35.086 --> 02:56:40.390]  The Clinton and the Obama appointees are there to subterfuge him constantly.
[02:56:40.410 --> 02:56:46.476]  And I think within the next six months he's going to take control of the bureaucracy much more firmly, including justice.
[02:56:47.116 --> 02:56:47.977]  Well, they're feeling the heat.
[02:56:48.017 --> 02:56:54.081]  They had the CIA and Public Affairs yesterday saying, shut down Cernovich, shut down Independent Media, shut down Jones.
[02:56:54.401 --> 02:56:56.263]  They're identifying who our deep state people are.
[02:56:56.543 --> 02:56:58.524]  Well, yeah, we're getting that directly from the White House and they know it.
[02:56:58.865 --> 02:57:00.266]  We know where they're eating, what they're doing.
[02:57:00.306 --> 02:57:03.288]  I mean, there is a fight going on and Trump's giving them rope.
[02:57:03.408 --> 02:57:04.649]  Closing comments, Joel Skousen.
[02:57:05.799 --> 02:57:08.861]  Well sadly, I think they're going to keep the heat on Trump.
[02:57:09.001 --> 02:57:13.504]  They're surveilling everything he does, waiting for an impeachable offense.
[02:57:14.064 --> 02:57:18.226]  They're going to throw the book at him, and he is never going to have one minute of rest.
[02:57:18.386 --> 02:57:23.890]  So I don't see him ever sitting down with a game plan of taking back from the bureaucracy.
[02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:28.012]  The bureaucracy is totally lost to Trump, including the State Department.
[02:57:28.032 --> 02:57:29.673]  But he is hitting Supreme Court justices.
[02:57:29.733 --> 02:57:31.194]  I mean, there are some good things happening.
[02:57:31.494 --> 02:57:33.877]  And he always looks like he's losing until he wins.
[02:57:33.937 --> 02:57:34.918]  I've said that about Trump.
[02:57:35.219 --> 02:57:38.383]  Don't you think, though, he's turned... I mean, I think he's turned the corner on the Russia thing.
[02:57:38.403 --> 02:57:40.045]  I mean, that's... or... what do you think, Joel?
[02:57:41.161 --> 02:57:43.503]  Yeah, I think he had a good relationship with Putin.
[02:57:43.623 --> 02:57:45.164]  Putin is not our enemy in Syria.
[02:57:45.204 --> 02:57:49.287]  They are our enemy in terms of a global conflict and preparing for that in the future.
[02:57:49.827 --> 02:57:57.812]  I just want to make one closing comment before I leave about Dr. Corsi's comment about the military being aggressive.
[02:57:57.852 --> 02:57:59.473]  It isn't really the military.
[02:57:59.613 --> 02:58:03.196]  These people are yes-men to the higher leaders who are globalists.
[02:58:03.676 --> 02:58:06.797]  And Neocons, they're the ones that have an aggressive agenda.
[02:58:07.417 --> 02:58:08.917]  I'm not saying that.
[02:58:09.037 --> 02:58:10.097]  I agree with that, of course.
[02:58:10.197 --> 02:58:11.597]  Alright, World Affairs Brief.
[02:58:11.717 --> 02:58:12.738]  People should subscribe to it.

[02:58:40.063 --> 02:58:41.103]  Thank you, Joel Skousen.
[02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:42.884]  Pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[02:58:43.164 --> 02:58:43.724]  Thank you, Joel.
[02:58:43.764 --> 02:58:43.964]  Great.
[02:58:44.024 --> 02:58:46.345]  I'm a great... Thank you for listening to GCS.
[02:58:46.365 --> 02:58:46.965]  Yeah, he's awesome.
[02:58:46.985 --> 02:58:47.965]  He's just so smart.
[02:58:47.985 --> 02:58:48.945]  We'll be right back, Fourth Hour.
[02:58:53.917 --> 02:59:02.947]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:03.028 --> 02:59:11.137]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:11.417 --> 02:59:16.119]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:16.279 --> 02:59:23.002]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:23.082 --> 02:59:30.164]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:30.264 --> 02:59:37.107]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:37.287 --> 02:59:41.629]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.769 --> 02:59:45.011]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:45.151 --> 02:59:51.294]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:51.454 --> 02:59:53.675]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:56.157 --> 03:00:02.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.587 --> 03:00:15.630]  Another time, in the Age of Wonder.
[03:00:17.010 --> 03:00:19.632]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[03:00:20.652 --> 03:00:25.695]  With your host, Paul Joseph Watson, from deep in the heart of London.
[03:00:26.495 --> 03:00:31.538]  Our Britannic Majesty's Kingdom.
[03:00:32.298 --> 03:00:34.800]  As if you're receiving this transmission, you're the resistance.
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:36.080]  Paul's coming up at 8 after.
[03:00:36.821 --> 03:00:38.302]  Always locked and loaded and ready to go.
[03:00:39.502 --> 03:00:40.964]  We've had quite a transmission today.
[03:00:41.004 --> 03:00:41.886]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:42.206 --> 03:00:44.810]  Okay, you're down here to shoot a JFK special we're going to air next week.
[03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.411]  Right.
[03:00:45.431 --> 03:00:47.334]  Just as a warning to Trump, that's the new angle on it.
[03:00:47.594 --> 03:00:50.018]  Looking at deep state, looking at the same things he faced.
[03:00:50.439 --> 03:00:52.181]  You know, you look at JFK, I know you knew.
[03:00:53.724 --> 03:01:01.171]  Dr. Corsi, looking at this, JFK really had an Americana, America first, cut the taxes thing.
[03:01:01.191 --> 03:01:02.092]  And I've studied Trump.
[03:01:02.552 --> 03:01:05.374]  So much of what he's doing is classic American reboot.
[03:01:05.715 --> 03:01:06.756]  It looks like JFK.
[03:01:07.036 --> 03:01:20.107]  Well, and in fact, Steve Miller, who is one of his top speechwriters and worked with Jeff Sessions as top aide for years, has crafted many of Trump's best speeches after JFK's speeches.
[03:01:20.868 --> 03:01:24.529]  And in fact, Trump and JFK shared a lot in common.
[03:01:24.789 --> 03:01:27.049]  They both understood negotiation.
[03:01:27.069 --> 03:01:29.650]  And by the way, I still bet on Trump.
[03:01:30.090 --> 03:01:32.610]  Trump is going to come out... Hold on, I think he's doing better than ever.
[03:01:32.850 --> 03:01:35.091]  Yeah, I think he's finally, he's getting his bearings.
[03:01:35.631 --> 03:01:37.651]  I mean, Trump always looks like he's going to lose.
[03:01:37.691 --> 03:01:39.732]  Well, we're certainly demoralizing the left right now.
[03:01:39.752 --> 03:01:42.632]  Yeah, and also, Trump is figuring out the game.
[03:01:42.672 --> 03:01:45.613]  Now once he's got the game figured out, he's going to take control of the game.
[03:01:46.013 --> 03:01:50.314]  He's a brilliant negotiator, and New York is not Washington.
[03:01:50.734 --> 03:01:54.556]  But if you can survive in New York, you know, it's like the song says, you can survive anywhere.
[03:01:54.976 --> 03:02:01.799]  And Trump has had to deal with the banks, he's had to deal with all kinds of criminals, he had to deal with labor unions, and he's still thrived.
[03:02:01.939 --> 03:02:04.740]  And he's going to do the same in the White House.
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:06.081]  But hold on, I want to be clear.
[03:02:06.301 --> 03:02:10.342]  Skousen was covering negatives to get it to the president and get it out in the ether.
[03:02:11.163 --> 03:02:12.723]  We've turned the corner on Russia.
[03:02:13.143 --> 03:02:14.144]  I'm not being a cheerleader.
[03:02:14.444 --> 03:02:24.047]  We're winning big time despite the fact he's totally surrounded just by his bully pulpit, just by trade, just by exuberance, just by the peace deal with Russia.
[03:02:25.111 --> 03:02:26.272]  Just by TPP.
[03:02:26.633 --> 03:02:27.734]  I say just, just, just.
[03:02:27.974 --> 03:02:29.395]  Just 3 trillion in the stock market.
[03:02:29.615 --> 03:02:31.017]  Just 300 billion in new jobs.
[03:02:31.257 --> 03:02:32.979]  Just over a thousand factories moving back.
[03:02:33.259 --> 03:02:34.600]  Just turning the coal back on.
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:36.622]  He's done dramatic things.
[03:02:36.802 --> 03:02:37.463]  Huge things.
[03:02:37.543 --> 03:02:41.367]  And in the next six months he's going to take the illegal aliens voting, the dead people voting.
[03:02:41.387 --> 03:02:42.448]  He's blown it all wide open.
[03:02:42.828 --> 03:02:43.288]  I don't
[03:03:01.095 --> 03:03:03.957]  That's why public affairs is already crapping its drawers.
[03:03:24.167 --> 03:03:24.367]  Right.
[03:03:24.487 --> 03:03:27.752]  By 20 to 40 percent, you're going to clean out the bureaucracy.
[03:03:28.152 --> 03:03:29.574]  And that's going to start at the top.
[03:03:30.094 --> 03:03:31.616]  Trump is not going to fill positions.
[03:03:31.636 --> 03:03:32.678]  He's going to get a hold of it.
[03:03:33.078 --> 03:03:38.024]  He's well aware he's got, within his own staff, he's got people like Priebus.
[03:03:38.044 --> 03:03:39.106]  He's got to get rid of Priebus.
[03:03:39.166 --> 03:03:40.587]  He gave Priebus until July 4th.
[03:03:40.627 --> 03:03:41.809]  Why is Priebus not out yet?
[03:03:41.909 --> 03:03:46.730]  They always tell him, they come and say, oh, you can't do it now, we've got this vote going on in Congress, we need Priebus.
[03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:48.391]  Priebus isn't going to do anything.
[03:03:48.431 --> 03:03:52.431]  Priebus is a... Trump needs to call out Paul Ryan and use his power.
[03:03:52.451 --> 03:03:54.972]  The people showing the polls, they know it's the Republicans blocking things.
[03:03:55.232 --> 03:03:56.352]  We've beaten the Democrats.
[03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:58.453]  Our problem is the Republican scumbags.
[03:03:58.733 --> 03:04:03.234]  And liberals should get on board with Trump for his economic plan that's JFK, you idiots!
[03:04:03.454 --> 03:04:05.955]  Well, Trump is going to get control of the Congress.
[03:04:05.995 --> 03:04:06.635]  He's going to, I think,
[03:04:07.618 --> 03:04:09.719]  They're going to already stay two weeks into August.
[03:04:09.759 --> 03:04:11.019]  That was announced this morning.
[03:04:11.439 --> 03:04:16.400]  And so Trump is going to get a bill out of this on health care, and he's going to get a tax cut.
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:17.761]  That's right.
[03:04:17.801 --> 03:04:20.501]  Why is Congress taking off record amounts to try to stall Trump?
[03:04:20.741 --> 03:04:23.962]  Well, and also Congress does take off historic amounts of time.
[03:04:24.742 --> 03:04:27.523]  It's one of the jobs that you hardly work at all.
[03:04:27.603 --> 03:04:29.784]  They argue they've got to go back and see their constituents.
[03:04:30.184 --> 03:04:30.804]  The point is,
[03:04:31.664 --> 03:04:36.547]  Congress can be managed by a president who understands the game, and Trump is going to understand the game.
[03:04:37.008 --> 03:04:41.791]  He's going to manage Congress, and he's going to... All right, tape some on this for the Nightly News tonight.
[03:04:41.811 --> 03:04:42.932]  You're going to be here the next couple days.
[03:04:42.952 --> 03:04:49.597]  We're going to get your JFK experts in and tape stuff so we can really produce it, and we're going to air it next week on two different hours of the transmission.
[03:04:49.637 --> 03:04:50.977]  Roger Stone's coming to town as well.
[03:04:51.258 --> 03:04:52.238]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[03:04:52.499 --> 03:04:52.999]  Great pleasure.
[03:04:53.039 --> 03:04:53.259]  Thank you.
[03:04:53.279 --> 03:04:53.439]  You bet.
[03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:57.762]  Infowars.com writer, sitting on the part of the Washington Bureau that's already set up now.
[03:04:58.042 --> 03:04:59.503]  Paul Watson, straight ahead.
[03:04:59.543 --> 03:05:00.044]  Stay with us.
[03:05:03.484 --> 03:05:06.425]  This is a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[03:05:07.286 --> 03:05:08.726]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[03:05:09.026 --> 03:05:10.027]  It is rampant out there.
[03:05:10.347 --> 03:05:11.888]  Here are some of its main exhibitors.
[03:05:12.828 --> 03:05:13.648]  Barack Obama.
[03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:20.811]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against.
[03:05:21.152 --> 03:05:22.152]  Washington fat cats.
[03:05:22.392 --> 03:05:23.733]  Multi-million dollar book deals.
[03:05:23.933 --> 03:05:25.154]  Multi-million dollar mansions.
[03:05:25.394 --> 03:05:30.738]  Meanwhile, the little guy is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford because of the healthcare bill he lied about.
[03:05:30.979 --> 03:05:32.140]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:34.862]  A man committed to warning you about the perils of global warming.
[03:05:35.142 --> 03:05:40.186]  Right after he flies to you on his G-20 jet airplane, then cascades off into the great blue on a superyacht.
[03:05:41.266 --> 03:05:47.949]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[03:05:48.229 --> 03:05:57.293]  Bernie Sanders, the head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife, under investigation for bank fraud.
[03:05:57.413 --> 03:05:59.073]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.
[03:05:59.374 --> 03:06:01.534]  Stay informed at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:01.815 --> 03:06:02.695]  This is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:03.106 --> 03:06:03.566]  Not a group.
[03:06:03.626 --> 03:06:05.028]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:06:05.068 --> 03:06:06.149]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:06:06.409 --> 03:06:07.330]  Why is this so good?
[03:06:07.610 --> 03:06:12.854]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:06:12.934 --> 03:06:26.505]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:06:26.545 --> 03:06:27.927]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:06:28.827 --> 03:06:32.848]  Spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:06:32.928 --> 03:06:34.189]  These are all parasites.
[03:06:34.249 --> 03:06:35.349]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:06:35.369 --> 03:06:36.389]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:36.709 --> 03:06:41.010]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:06:41.230 --> 03:06:44.371]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:44.551 --> 03:06:47.592]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:47.612 --> 03:06:48.592]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:06:48.652 --> 03:06:50.533]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:50.593 --> 03:06:51.613]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:08:01.076 --> 03:08:07.761]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[03:08:15.191 --> 03:08:17.315]  He never gives up.
[03:08:17.416 --> 03:08:18.959]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.999 --> 03:08:19.860]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:21.964]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:08:22.545 --> 03:08:23.527]  Worldwide.
[03:08:23.828 --> 03:08:24.469]  That's right.
[03:08:24.509 --> 03:08:25.932]  Paul Watson is taking over in this hour.
[03:08:27.671 --> 03:08:36.175]  But I first wanted to get his take on the announcements by the Federal Elections Commission that there is a criminal investigation of Matt Drudge, George Truly, and Breitbart.
[03:08:36.555 --> 03:08:39.937]  A criminal investigation that I killed the Easter Bunny.
[03:08:40.057 --> 03:08:42.879]  No, that the Russians fund us and command us.
[03:08:43.639 --> 03:08:46.600]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this was first in McClatchy months ago.
[03:08:46.660 --> 03:08:49.922]  They had some congressional hearings about it, but now they said they want hearings.
[03:08:50.202 --> 03:08:51.143]  Well, I dare them!
[03:08:52.176 --> 03:08:55.319]  I dare them to bring us in and to have me testify.
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:09:09.814]  I can't wait to talk about the globalists selling out our country to all the foreign interests, the TPP, the communist Chinese, the Russians, Hillary's connections, and the fact that we have zero funding and zero connections to Russians other than Daria, who does a great job.
[03:09:10.895 --> 03:09:12.817]  Yes, she's Russian.
[03:09:13.217 --> 03:09:14.299]  Talk about a witch hunt.
[03:09:14.639 --> 03:09:16.941]  This is a total insane asylum.
[03:09:17.262 --> 03:09:20.305]  We'll get Paul Watson's take on that in a moment, then he'll take over.
[03:09:20.525 --> 03:09:21.706]  He's got a big guest as well.
[03:09:21.967 --> 03:09:24.790]  But first, here's a mash-up of Hillary and others.
[03:09:26.477 --> 03:09:42.385]  So within one hour, one hour of the Access Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour the Russians, say WikiLeaks, same thing, dumped the John Podesta emails.
[03:09:43.578 --> 03:09:45.079]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[03:09:45.099 --> 03:09:45.880]  That were pedestrians.
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:10:01.793]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[03:10:01.873 --> 03:10:02.093]  Oh really?
[03:10:02.113 --> 03:10:03.394]  It was based in Boston.
[03:10:04.135 --> 03:10:07.678]  You know, the Russian company had a very small investment in it.
[03:10:08.038 --> 03:10:09.700]  And you could keep saying that they gave me
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:13.761]  I'm just following all the widely reported information here, John.
[03:10:13.781 --> 03:10:15.822]  There's also Hillary Clinton, obviously.
[03:10:15.862 --> 03:10:23.305]  Maria, maybe you're looking at widely reported information from InfoWars, but it is not true.
[03:10:23.425 --> 03:10:23.845]  No, I'm not.
[03:10:23.865 --> 03:10:27.066]  This is Politico, this is the New York Times, this is the Wall Street Journal.
[03:10:27.126 --> 03:10:27.346]  No, it's not.
[03:10:27.366 --> 03:10:28.547]  That's what I'm looking at, John.
[03:10:28.707 --> 03:10:31.428]  Are there other RTs operating in the U.S.?
[03:10:31.948 --> 03:10:33.789]  Can you describe them, list them?
[03:10:35.436 --> 03:10:35.916]  Sure, thank you.
[03:10:36.096 --> 03:10:46.938]  So, you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[03:10:48.059 --> 03:10:52.580]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers for those modalities.
[03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:56.961]  And in the full clip, Hillary says that Russia gets their info from me.
[03:10:57.541 --> 03:10:58.741]  This is crazy.
[03:10:59.221 --> 03:11:03.162]  Now they've got a woman connected to the group that put out the PPGate story that's been discredited.
[03:11:04.810 --> 03:11:06.452]  Meeting, and Trump Jr.
[03:11:06.472 --> 03:11:12.399]  wanted to know about Russia tries to expose Hillary, so that's his evidence of working with the Russians, even though she doesn't work with the Russians.
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:14.502]  This whole thing is a giant setup.
[03:11:15.243 --> 03:11:19.348]  It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[03:11:19.808 --> 03:11:23.753]  And now they want the Federal Elections Commission to shut up conservative talk radio.
[03:11:24.656 --> 03:11:34.862]  And they've got Google having Carlos Slim, Bezos, and Warren Buffett coming and saying, shut down our competition on Google, force feed our news to the public.
[03:11:35.242 --> 03:11:36.743]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[03:11:37.083 --> 03:11:38.644]  We are routing these people.
[03:11:38.684 --> 03:11:40.185]  This is comical.
[03:11:40.505 --> 03:11:41.646]  This is insane.
[03:11:42.606 --> 03:11:44.887]  Hillary, it's your emails that destroyed you.
[03:11:44.907 --> 03:11:46.228]  It doesn't matter who released them.
[03:11:46.488 --> 03:11:47.369]  You're a criminal.
[03:11:47.789 --> 03:11:49.250]  Paul, what do you make of all this?
[03:11:49.290 --> 03:11:51.151]  And did you get your orders from Putin today?
[03:11:53.359 --> 03:11:57.941]  I mean, Alex, I was probably on RT three, four years ago, a couple of times.
[03:11:58.141 --> 03:12:01.842]  I don't even respond to their emails if they want me on, and that was probably two years ago.
[03:12:02.363 --> 03:12:04.203]  Absolute, complete BS.
[03:12:04.444 --> 03:12:10.066]  This is the moment when I knew for sure, 100%, that this Russia collusion crap
[03:12:10.626 --> 03:12:11.587]  Was total BS.
[03:12:11.667 --> 03:12:18.912]  When it ensnared us, Alex, not being facetious, but you know, Infowars is like an 18-wheeler steaming down the highway.
[03:12:19.272 --> 03:12:20.733]  We can barely manage ourselves.
[03:12:20.753 --> 03:12:22.515]  There ain't nobody running this thing.
[03:12:22.555 --> 03:12:23.415]  We're a runaway.
[03:12:24.076 --> 03:12:25.197]  I don't tell you what to do.
[03:12:25.417 --> 03:12:26.978]  We're just fighting for freedom.
[03:12:28.169 --> 03:12:31.471]  Oh, I mean, it's all up in the air every single day.
[03:12:31.511 --> 03:12:32.992]  We just pound it out every single day.
[03:12:33.252 --> 03:12:38.135]  As if for a minute we would even have the chance to take orders from the Kremlin.
[03:12:38.435 --> 03:12:39.856]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:12:39.876 --> 03:12:43.338]  But what's crazy is they're the ones that all took orders from Hillary in the campaign.
[03:12:43.598 --> 03:12:47.521]  They're the ones that don't take a crap unless they're given authorization by Podesta.
[03:12:48.914 --> 03:12:49.334]  Exactly.
[03:12:49.354 --> 03:12:57.901]  And the only thing that RT did five, six years ago, which really pissed them off, was they had airport signs which said, question more.
[03:12:57.941 --> 03:12:58.461]  Remember that?
[03:12:58.501 --> 03:12:59.482]  That was a huge scandal.
[03:12:59.742 --> 03:13:05.246]  How dare a news outlet invite people to question what they're being told by public officials?
[03:13:05.666 --> 03:13:09.008]  So from then on, RT was marked as the enemy.
[03:13:09.468 --> 03:13:12.570]  Even though we don't agree with them on a lot of stuff, they did a lot of SJW stuff.
[03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:14.732]  But it's exactly, it's too much liberal crap.
[03:13:15.312 --> 03:13:17.213]  As if we don't do things on our own.
[03:13:17.594 --> 03:13:20.595]  As if the American people didn't reject Hillary.
[03:13:20.916 --> 03:13:22.917]  And they're so arrogant, she's gonna be the face of 2018.
[03:13:22.977 --> 03:13:23.617]  Did you hear that?
[03:13:26.141 --> 03:13:28.282]  Well, good luck to them if they're going with that.
[03:13:28.322 --> 03:13:46.132]  But again, they had a tweet last week which was retweeted by several prominent journalists, which they were basically triggering and butthurt over the fact that RT wasn't talking about something negative about Trump when all the other news networks in America were, because they dared to have their own editorial position.
[03:13:46.172 --> 03:13:49.194]  That's right, it's a cult that doesn't like anybody that's independent.
[03:13:49.214 --> 03:13:50.715]  It's a cult that doesn't like independents.
[03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:56.996]  Yeah, so obviously we're going to cross over on some subjects with RT because we're independent.
[03:13:57.276 --> 03:14:00.760]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN.
[03:14:01.061 --> 03:14:03.483]  We're not funded by George Soros like Media Matters.
[03:14:03.864 --> 03:14:08.429]  So we're going to cross over on some things where we, God forbid, have an independent view.
[03:14:08.769 --> 03:14:12.753]  Don't you love how the young turds have been funded by Gulf State Dictatorships?
[03:14:13.114 --> 03:14:14.115]  And so has CNN.
[03:14:14.355 --> 03:14:18.519]  We're talking quarter million per production on CNN by Gulf State Dictators.
[03:14:18.559 --> 03:14:19.640]  These people are a joke.
[03:14:19.820 --> 03:14:20.781]  Let me ask this last question.
[03:14:20.801 --> 03:14:23.004]  I'm getting out of here because you're the reason we're all watching, Paul.
[03:14:24.184 --> 03:14:25.225]  I love talking to you here on air.
[03:14:25.245 --> 03:14:26.566]  We talk more on air than we talk off air.
[03:14:26.586 --> 03:14:29.248]  We're both so busy and we're not getting our Kremlin orders actually.
[03:14:29.948 --> 03:14:45.279]  Looking at this, what do you make of CNN claiming, I saw you tweet this on Sunday and I looked it up, that there was no violence by the left, it was all wonderful and liberal in Frankfurt, Germany at the G20, when all the rest of the mainstream media called it an orgy of violence, almost 500 cops in the hospital.
[03:14:46.299 --> 03:14:52.746]  People burned up, it looked like a bombing zone, you know, like Dresden or something in World War II.
[03:14:53.206 --> 03:14:57.991]  Why would CNN tell lies they know are manifestly discrediting?
[03:14:59.363 --> 03:15:07.290]  Because they're all tied into the same system, which is this idea that there's legitimate, authentic protest against, essentially, it was Trump.
[03:15:07.330 --> 03:15:16.638]  I mean, you had de Blasio over there ignoring the funeral of a slain NYPD officer to go and grandstand in front of a bunch of violent communists.
[03:15:16.678 --> 03:15:17.819]  That's exactly who they were.
[03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:24.084]  CNN took one little protest, one little side protest that probably lasted for an hour, which was largely
[03:15:24.384 --> 03:15:26.106]  Peaceful, by a completely different group.
[03:15:26.326 --> 03:15:28.207]  And said, oh look, Hamburg was completely peaceful.
[03:15:28.447 --> 03:15:36.954]  You've got centre-right columnists, conservative respected columnists in Germany coming out and saying, the left is turning into the equivalent of Islamic terrorists.
[03:15:36.994 --> 03:15:39.456]  It's only a matter of time before they start blowing things up.
[03:15:39.876 --> 03:15:43.119]  And the CNN, to have the nerve to say it was peaceful.
[03:15:43.399 --> 03:15:53.207]  But Alex, that's why more people watch 40-year-old reruns of Yogi Bear than they do CNN's top shows, because people are sick of it and it doesn't resonate with anyone.
[03:15:53.467 --> 03:16:00.117]  And they're out today denying that as well, that more people watch Nickelodeon cartoons when it's proven by the ratings.
[03:16:00.458 --> 03:16:01.960]  I'm going to get into that clip as well.
[03:16:02.541 --> 03:16:03.863]  So it's completely insane.
[03:16:04.304 --> 03:16:05.225]  The Don Jr.
[03:16:05.245 --> 03:16:05.505]  thing.
[03:16:06.267 --> 03:16:07.989]  So let me get this straight, Alex.
[03:16:08.650 --> 03:16:11.933]  Russia and Trump had this deep collusion, right?
[03:16:11.973 --> 03:16:15.596]  They had deep communication and ties right up until the election.
[03:16:15.856 --> 03:16:17.437]  Yet you've got Don Jr.
[03:16:17.877 --> 03:16:22.941]  in June, four months before the election, saying, oh, OK, I'll meet with this woman, whoever she is.
[03:16:23.342 --> 03:16:30.087]  Some crackpot who had no information whatsoever, who even Bloomberg admits has no connection to the Russian government.
[03:16:30.347 --> 03:16:36.292]  So they were so deeply in bed that he's forced to meet with a crackpot who's not even related to the Russian government.
[03:16:36.332 --> 03:16:40.395]  But she's obviously a useful idiot of the Piscate dossier group.
[03:16:40.615 --> 03:16:45.319]  They just threw a bunch of kooks at them hoping one of them would end up meeting with them and that's all they've got.
[03:16:45.539 --> 03:16:49.823]  And now they're running around breathlessly on CNN like the Holy Grail has been discovered.
[03:16:51.226 --> 03:16:54.868]  Yeah, it's gone from Russia hacked the election, to Don Jr.
[03:16:55.169 --> 03:17:00.652]  reluctantly met with a crackpot for half an hour, and was disappointed, and it was a complete waste of time.
[03:17:00.893 --> 03:17:02.674]  So they've gone from that to that.
[03:17:02.754 --> 03:17:06.997]  If that's all they've got left, then they're running out of bullets, Alex, and it's quite pathetic.
[03:17:07.237 --> 03:17:08.318]  But maybe Don Jr.
[03:17:08.358 --> 03:17:15.702]  should have just deleted the emails, you know, bleach-bit the emails, like Hillary Clinton did, and the media would be fawning all over them.
[03:17:15.723 --> 03:17:17.624]  Or taking hammers to the hard drives.
[03:17:18.769 --> 03:17:24.112]  Yeah, that's also a respectable way to handle private information, important information.
[03:17:24.152 --> 03:17:25.612]  You do that, you get away with it, it's fine.
[03:17:25.972 --> 03:17:29.034]  You casually meet with somebody who turns out to be a crackpot.
[03:17:29.354 --> 03:17:34.817]  How many people have you met, Alex, that want to talk about projects and stuff that it just turns out to be a complete waste of time?
[03:17:34.837 --> 03:17:39.059]  It doesn't mean you're colluding in bed with the government from the country which they're from.
[03:17:39.079 --> 03:17:39.419]  Exactly.
[03:17:39.479 --> 03:17:40.299]  I'm skipping this, Bracey.
[03:17:40.319 --> 03:17:40.919]  I have more time.
[03:17:40.980 --> 03:17:41.680]  Paul, take over.
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:42.160]  Great job.
[03:17:42.460 --> 03:17:43.761]  Paul Watson, go ahead.
[03:17:45.279 --> 03:17:46.160]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:48.681]  We've got a guest coming on at the bottom of the hour, by the way.
[03:17:48.721 --> 03:17:49.942]  That is Peter Sweden.
[03:17:49.962 --> 03:17:57.547]  You've probably seen some of his videos to talk about latest goings-on in the liberal basket case that is Sweden and what that means for the rest of Europe.
[03:17:58.228 --> 03:17:59.588]  Continuing with the news now.
[03:18:00.269 --> 03:18:01.610]  Huge nothing burger.
[03:18:01.690 --> 03:18:03.431]  They tried to sensationalize it.
[03:18:03.871 --> 03:18:05.092]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:18:05.292 --> 03:18:06.193]  cut ahead of them.
[03:18:06.753 --> 03:18:11.574]  The New York Times, that is, by releasing the emails before they could write their big bombshell story.
[03:18:12.174 --> 03:18:16.996]  It was basically that he met with this lawyer who was not connected to the Kremlin at all.
[03:18:17.136 --> 03:18:21.957]  Even Bloomberg admits that in an article entitled Trump's Low-Level Russian Connection.
[03:18:21.997 --> 03:18:24.177]  The lawyer who met Donald Trump Jr.
[03:18:24.497 --> 03:18:27.058]  was no Kremlin power broker.
[03:18:27.538 --> 03:18:30.301]  So even they admit that she had no connection to the Kremlin.
[03:18:30.682 --> 03:18:35.487]  Oh, but according to the New York Times, she's a senior Russian government official.
[03:18:35.948 --> 03:18:37.690]  Complete and total BS.
[03:18:38.070 --> 03:18:42.075]  The very fact that he even entertained the notion of meeting with this woman...
[03:18:42.595 --> 03:18:50.017]  As late as June 2016, four months before the presidential election, proves that there was no deep collusion.
[03:18:50.337 --> 03:19:03.981]  If there were back channels, if there were serious ties between the Russians and the Trump administration, with the Russians feeding them info, colluding with them, scheming with them to steal the election, why on earth would Donald Trump Jr.
[03:19:05.041 --> 03:19:10.467]  Even be interested in meeting with a crackpot who said she had information.
[03:19:10.768 --> 03:19:12.550]  Turns out she had nothing whatsoever.
[03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:16.714]  She wanted to talk more about Russian abortion, I think was the subject.
[03:19:17.155 --> 03:19:23.042]  This actually disproves collusion between Trump and Russia because there's no way he'd even entertain this.
[03:19:23.582 --> 03:19:25.424]  If that collusion existed.
[03:19:25.984 --> 03:19:34.992]  Total nothing, Berger, just like Van Jones and the rest of them at CNN said last week and the week before in the video releases by James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:19:35.553 --> 03:19:44.421]  So again, this was not connected to any hacking, there was no pre-existing backchannel between Trump and Russia, and nothing came of this meeting.
[03:19:44.461 --> 03:19:45.982]  It was a complete waste of time.
[03:19:46.262 --> 03:19:50.486]  The people at the meeting were all on their phones within 5-10 minutes because
[03:19:50.506 --> 03:19:50.826]  We're good.
[03:20:06.178 --> 03:20:07.359]  All right, we're skipping the break.
[03:20:07.799 --> 03:20:17.647]  So I was talking about opposition research, political opposition research, completely normal, completely routine in every, not only presidential election, but election in general.
[03:20:18.147 --> 03:20:22.351]  Oh, well, they're forgetting something quite important, which is this, and this is a Daily Caller headline.
[03:20:22.931 --> 03:20:26.894]  Everybody's forgetting that Clinton allies did the same thing as Don Jr.
[03:20:27.074 --> 03:20:30.477]  Not only did they do the same thing, they did it to a far more sustained level.
[03:20:31.610 --> 03:20:43.095]  Many journalists reacted breathlessly to a New York Times report on Sunday revealing that President Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., met with a Russian lawyer who indicated she had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
[03:20:43.935 --> 03:20:44.636]  Donald Jr.
[03:20:44.676 --> 03:20:57.161]  admitted to the June 26 meeting to which he brought campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump advisor Jared Kushner, who were both on their phone within five minutes because it became obvious that she had no information of any importance whatsoever.
[03:20:58.462 --> 03:21:23.184]  But if you go back to January, which this article points out, it was revealed in Politico that some of the Ukrainian government's anti-Trump activities during the election, which included a veteran DNC operative who previously worked in the Clinton White House, Alexander Shalupa, worked with Ukrainian government officials, actually directly with the Ukrainian government, unlike this Russian lawyer.
[03:21:23.929 --> 03:21:32.353]  ...and journalists from both Ukraine and America to dig up Russia-related opposition research on Trump and Manafort.
[03:21:32.754 --> 03:21:39.177]  She also shared her anti-Trump research with both the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
[03:21:40.037 --> 03:21:53.224]  So you've got an individual working with the DNC on behalf of Hillary Clinton, meeting, scheming with foreign government officials to dig up political opposition research on Donald Trump.
[03:21:54.465 --> 03:21:56.065]  To a far more sustained degree.
[03:21:57.306 --> 03:22:12.410]  Chalupa, again working for the DNC on behalf of Hillary Clinton, met with Ukrainian Ambassador Valery Chaly and one of his aides, Oskar Shulyar, at the Ukrainian Embassy in March 2016 to talk about unearthing Paul Manafort's Russian connections.
[03:22:13.131 --> 03:22:14.671]  Chalupa admitted to Politico.
[03:22:15.031 --> 03:22:17.252]  Four days later, Trump officially hired Manafort.
[03:22:17.955 --> 03:22:35.295]  So this was a sustained relationship between an individual working for the DNC on behalf of Hillary Clinton meeting with foreign government officials to dig up political opposition research on Donald Trump to try and sabotage, to try and sink his presidential campaign.
[03:22:36.035 --> 03:22:37.417]  How is that any different?
[03:22:38.263 --> 03:22:39.924]  From what Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:40.004 --> 03:22:40.884]  is accused of doing.
[03:22:41.204 --> 03:22:52.948]  It's exactly the same, but it's not even on the same level, given that this relationship between the DNC and the Ukrainian government was sustained for far longer time.
[03:22:53.108 --> 03:22:53.949]  Whereas Trump Jr.
[03:22:53.989 --> 03:22:57.270]  met up with this woman, what, for a period of an hour maybe?
[03:22:57.390 --> 03:22:58.890]  Nothing came of it whatsoever.
[03:22:59.871 --> 03:23:00.431]  That's it!
[03:23:01.211 --> 03:23:03.392]  Complete nothing burger.
[03:23:04.119 --> 03:23:16.595]  He released the emails, he jumped ahead of the New York Times, but still, they went with the Trump derangement syndrome narrative, which is, oh my god, this is bombshell, this is shocking, this is treason.
[03:23:17.276 --> 03:23:21.441]  If it's treason, then everyone in the DNC who worked with this individual
[03:23:22.685 --> 03:23:28.247]  Who in turn worked with the Ukrainian government, foreign government officials, then they're guilty of treason as well.
[03:23:29.067 --> 03:23:32.889]  Bottom line is, everybody does this during a political campaign.
[03:23:32.969 --> 03:23:35.030]  It's completely par for the course.
[03:23:36.050 --> 03:23:37.371]  Was Donald Trump Jr.
[03:23:37.451 --> 03:23:40.312]  enthusiastic about digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton?
[03:23:40.332 --> 03:23:40.812]  Well, yes.
[03:23:41.952 --> 03:23:43.033]  Nobody would deny that.
[03:23:44.332 --> 03:23:51.635]  Should he have said it at the start instead of saying the conversation was just about, what was it, Russian abortion in the United States, or adoption, I forget which?
[03:23:52.076 --> 03:23:52.896]  Yeah, maybe he should.
[03:23:53.456 --> 03:23:59.039]  But he released the email, this is the content of it, and they're treating it like it's a new Watergate.
[03:23:59.599 --> 03:24:01.900]  Again, absolute nothingburger.
[03:24:02.181 --> 03:24:05.082]  They've gone from Russia hacking the election
[03:24:05.976 --> 03:24:10.001]  You know, suggesting that they directly had influence in the actual voting machines.
[03:24:10.061 --> 03:24:19.914]  Remember the fake Washington Post story about Russian hackers infiltrating the electrical grid turned out to be complete nonsense, no fact-checking done whatsoever.
[03:24:20.315 --> 03:24:21.196]  They've gone from that...
[03:24:22.163 --> 03:24:24.124]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:24:24.524 --> 03:24:39.571]  got an email and had a one-hour meeting with a crackpot who had no information whatsoever in the context of the fact that the DNC did that to the exact same degree, in fact more sustained, with Ukrainian government officials.
[03:24:39.671 --> 03:24:41.632]  Exactly the same thing.
[03:24:42.092 --> 03:24:44.893]  But again, it's not about the actual detail of the story.
[03:24:45.193 --> 03:24:51.256]  It's about the hysterical Trump derangement syndrome reaction after the fact.
[03:24:52.639 --> 03:25:07.712]  Bottom line is, if there were serious back channels, serious collusion between the Trump administration and the Russian government before the election, with the intention of manipulating, swinging the election, why on earth would Donald Trump Jr.
[03:25:08.333 --> 03:25:15.599]  need to meet this one lawyer, who even Bloomberg admits had no connection to the Kremlin, for a conversation?
[03:25:16.801 --> 03:25:20.686]  If he already was in bed with Putin, why on earth would he need this?
[03:25:21.026 --> 03:25:26.893]  He was very enthusiastic about potentially digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton, as we all were during that time period.
[03:25:27.253 --> 03:25:34.001]  Why on earth would he need to get so enthusiastic about that if they were already tied at the hip with the Kremlin?
[03:25:34.953 --> 03:25:38.436]  Absolutely incredible media hysteria once again.
[03:25:38.757 --> 03:25:39.658]  They're desperate.
[03:25:40.018 --> 03:25:43.021]  Now you've seen it with the investigation into Infowars as well.
[03:25:43.441 --> 03:25:55.413]  As soon as I saw that story, which we first reported on months ago, which was first in Politico months ago, that the FBI was looking into Infowars collusion with the Russians,
[03:25:56.823 --> 03:26:01.849]  That is the moment I knew 100% that it was total BS.
[03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:10.438]  As I said to Alex earlier, I'm not being facetious, but this organisation is an 18-wheeler steaming down the highway at 100 miles an hour.
[03:26:11.159 --> 03:26:14.683]  You know, we're pretty much left to our own devices to get on with what we want.
[03:26:15.663 --> 03:26:28.336]  You know, some people are given guidance, but it's not an organised system to the degree where a government can come in and start directing people about without evidence of that coming out.
[03:26:29.557 --> 03:26:38.606]  The simple fact that we cover some of the same stories as RT, as does the entirety of the independent media, that's basically all they've got.
[03:26:39.642 --> 03:26:50.225]  As well as Hillary Clinton's constant whining and butthurt when she gets up on stage and blames WikiLeaks and Infowars, who are basically the same thing as the Russians for swinging the election.
[03:26:50.665 --> 03:26:53.226]  Just like the Trump thing, nothing whatsoever.
[03:26:53.306 --> 03:26:54.306]  Complete hot air.
[03:26:54.727 --> 03:26:56.607]  Complete nothing burger.
[03:26:57.267 --> 03:27:01.769]  They've gone from Russia hacked the election to this, and quite frankly, it's pathetic.
[03:27:02.929 --> 03:27:04.950]  The only thing I would say about Don Jr.
[03:27:05.010 --> 03:27:08.951]  is, since he released these emails a few hours ago, and since the
[03:27:10.788 --> 03:27:12.589]  Media jumped on it like hyenas.
[03:27:13.270 --> 03:27:14.651]  He's been quite quiet on Twitter.
[03:27:14.691 --> 03:27:16.672]  He's retweeted a few people last time I checked.
[03:27:16.712 --> 03:27:23.577]  He needs to get on the offensive as well, because if you allow them to take control of the narrative, they can take it in any direction they want.
[03:27:24.358 --> 03:27:26.199]  They're good at whipping up hysteria.
[03:27:26.539 --> 03:27:29.862]  They've done it time and time again, which is why Donald Trump Jr.
[03:27:30.202 --> 03:27:31.623]  needs to get on the offensive.
[03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:43.518]  With the true narrative, which is a complete nothing-burger, as now I see, people like Bill O'Reilly, people like Governor Mike Huckabee, are also pointing out.
[03:27:43.558 --> 03:27:48.301]  In fact, let's read a couple of their tweets, because they went up just in the past hour or so.
[03:27:48.361 --> 03:27:51.444]  Governor Mike Huckabee said about this scandal.
[03:27:52.224 --> 03:27:54.907]  Liberal media in a frenzy because Donald Trump Jr.
[03:27:54.947 --> 03:27:56.167]  released all his emails.
[03:27:56.248 --> 03:27:57.328]  Should have deleted them.
[03:27:57.749 --> 03:27:59.130]  We know that's fine with them.
[03:27:59.670 --> 03:28:00.451]  Yeah, if he did that,
[03:28:01.184 --> 03:28:03.265]  Maybe the media would be fawning all over him.
[03:28:03.806 --> 03:28:14.712]  We know they wouldn't, because they literally go to dinner parties in each other's houses on a regular basis, and Politico's Glenn Thrush begs for John Podesta's approval before he even writes an article.
[03:28:15.173 --> 03:28:17.714]  Oh, but there's no collusion between those two parties.
[03:28:17.774 --> 03:28:18.274]  No, no, no.
[03:28:19.155 --> 03:28:20.316]  Bill O'Reilly said this.
[03:28:21.587 --> 03:28:22.429]  Trump Jr.
[03:28:22.469 --> 03:28:23.871]  smart to release emails.
[03:28:24.212 --> 03:28:27.979]  Tabloid guy set him up with a Russian lawyer who promised Hillary dirt.
[03:28:28.420 --> 03:28:29.301]  She didn't deliver.
[03:28:29.702 --> 03:28:30.644]  That's the story.
[03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:35.113]  And again, this tabloid guy that set him up looks like a complete slob.
[03:28:35.453 --> 03:28:42.438]  This is hardly a professional, surreptitious operation where they're scheming behind the scenes with the Kremlin.
[03:28:42.959 --> 03:28:46.441]  It looks like basically a complete waste of time.
[03:28:47.062 --> 03:28:55.648]  We've all had meetings with people who promise important information, whether it's political or working on projects or whatever, and it turns out to be a total waste of time.
[03:28:55.908 --> 03:28:57.330]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:28:58.356 --> 03:29:00.318]  But that's some of the reaction coming into it.
[03:29:01.018 --> 03:29:07.945]  The only advice I would give to Donald Trump Jr, and he might have already taken this, is to get on the offensive himself with this narrative.
[03:29:08.385 --> 03:29:19.736]  Because you can bet your bottom dollar that the media will take it in any direction they want, with an emphasis on complete hysteria, as they do every single time, but we'll continue to track it.
[03:29:20.336 --> 03:29:20.857]  We have
[03:29:21.829 --> 03:29:24.011]  In the next segment, Peter Sweden coming on.
[03:29:24.051 --> 03:29:26.133]  He is a YouTuber, of course, from Sweden.
[03:29:26.173 --> 03:29:27.434]  I believe he's in the UK now.
[03:29:27.794 --> 03:29:32.838]  But he's planning on going to Sicily to document what's going on with the migrant crisis there.
[03:29:33.218 --> 03:29:42.926]  Of course, we have Sweden, the liberal basket case of the world, the one example of a country that is a warning, not only to the rest of Europe, but to America itself.
[03:29:43.667 --> 03:29:45.188]  So we're going to get into that and more.
[03:29:45.628 --> 03:29:49.691]  On the flip side, it's the Alex Jones Show fourth hour with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:29:50.192 --> 03:29:50.732]  We'll be back.
[03:29:50.812 --> 03:29:51.373]  Don't go away.
[03:29:52.418 --> 03:29:53.338]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.819 --> 03:29:55.419]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:59.121]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.923 --> 03:30:07.465]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:30:07.925 --> 03:30:13.968]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:30:14.368 --> 03:30:17.169]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:17.550 --> 03:30:20.531]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:20.751 --> 03:30:24.194]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:30:24.515 --> 03:30:26.276]  The left controls culture.
[03:30:26.296 --> 03:30:27.277]  They control arts.
[03:30:27.357 --> 03:30:28.579]  They control entertainment.
[03:30:28.879 --> 03:30:35.966]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:36.026 --> 03:30:38.428]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:30:38.909 --> 03:30:42.772]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:30:42.832 --> 03:30:44.894]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:30:45.515 --> 03:30:50.877]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:30:51.138 --> 03:30:57.380]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:30:57.460 --> 03:30:59.161]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:30:59.301 --> 03:31:00.482]  It's available right now.
[03:31:00.802 --> 03:31:02.983]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:04.813 --> 03:31:09.716]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:31:10.517 --> 03:31:13.439]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:31:14.119 --> 03:31:16.921]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:31:17.542 --> 03:31:22.425]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[03:31:22.785 --> 03:31:29.089]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[03:31:29.449 --> 03:31:34.613]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:31:35.273 --> 03:31:38.715]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:31:39.276 --> 03:31:47.100]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[03:31:47.661 --> 03:31:52.003]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[03:31:52.343 --> 03:31:56.286]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.

[03:32:03.649 --> 03:32:06.070]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:32:06.671 --> 03:32:10.393]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:32:10.913 --> 03:32:17.617]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:32:18.258 --> 03:32:21.400]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:32:22.120 --> 03:32:41.648]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:32:42.248 --> 03:32:45.890]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:32:46.390 --> 03:32:56.874]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[03:32:57.695 --> 03:33:02.817]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:33:05.871 --> 03:33:12.683]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.903 --> 03:33:16.609]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:21.374 --> 03:33:23.276]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.296 --> 03:33:28.622]  Before we go to our guest, I want to tell you about the great specials available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:28.662 --> 03:33:38.432]  We still have the 4th of July Summer Mega Special running where you get massive discounts off the likes of Brain Force, Supermail Vitality, Survival Shield X2.
[03:33:39.373 --> 03:33:40.855]  We're good to go.
[03:33:55.027 --> 03:33:58.831]  In the offing based on complete nothing burger nonsense once again.
[03:33:58.851 --> 03:34:01.695]  We're constantly under attack because we're independent.
[03:34:01.975 --> 03:34:08.322]  That terrifies the life out of them because they've never had that authenticity and never will.
[03:34:08.802 --> 03:34:12.626]  We're beholden only to our audience which is why, even though we're not perfect,
[03:34:13.487 --> 03:34:15.608]  We're at least trying to tell the truth.
[03:34:16.169 --> 03:34:17.129]  That terrifies them.
[03:34:17.369 --> 03:34:19.511]  What does that tell you about the mainstream media?
[03:34:19.731 --> 03:34:20.631]  Please support us.
[03:34:20.931 --> 03:34:24.573]  We can only survive with your continued support, getting the products.

[03:34:32.778 --> 03:34:34.679]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:35.079 --> 03:34:37.741]  Support this network as it's under increasing attack.
[03:34:38.381 --> 03:34:40.603]  Today, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:42.253 --> 03:34:43.274]  Now let's go to our guest.
[03:34:43.374 --> 03:34:46.817]  He is at PeterSweden7 on Twitter.
[03:34:46.837 --> 03:34:48.739]  You've probably seen some of his YouTube videos.
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:55.725]  He's been documenting the impact of the migrant crisis on Sweden as well as a number of other issues.
[03:34:56.806 --> 03:34:59.368]  Before I go to our guest though, I just want to read this out of Breitbart.
[03:34:59.388 --> 03:35:02.311]  Now this was out in June, so this is probably about a month old now.
[03:35:02.731 --> 03:35:05.013]  Sex attacks at Swedish festivals have risen 1,000%.
[03:35:07.256 --> 03:35:11.844]  A new report has revealed that sex attacks at Swedish festivals have increased as much as 1,000% in 2016.
[03:35:12.285 --> 03:35:16.732]  So that's last year's figures, a trend which does not appear to be changing.
[03:35:17.844 --> 03:35:28.187]  Now, since that report came out, we had a number of other sexual assaults at Swedish music festivals, including the Brevala 2018 festival.
[03:35:28.927 --> 03:35:41.590]  It was funny that they reacted by cancelling the festival, but then a Swedish comedian and a radio host came out and said, oh, why don't we solve this rash of sexual assaults by just banning all men?
[03:35:42.270 --> 03:35:43.752]  Because that's the solution, isn't it?
[03:35:44.012 --> 03:35:49.438]  Kind of like when they proposed banning vehicles after the Stockholm truck terrorist attack.
[03:35:49.458 --> 03:35:52.881]  I mean, Peter, is the problem here all men?
[03:35:53.322 --> 03:35:57.787]  Or is it certain kinds of men with certain beliefs about women?
[03:35:57.847 --> 03:35:59.548]  Which do you think is the real problem here?
[03:35:59.568 --> 03:36:01.791]  Well, thanks very much for having me on, Paul.
[03:36:03.191 --> 03:36:09.775]  Yes, it's... I don't think it is blondes, blue-eyed Swedish people that are behind this.
[03:36:09.815 --> 03:36:15.378]  People like me, that's... Pretty certain it's not those kind of people we're talking about here.
[03:36:15.738 --> 03:36:21.521]  It's... There was actually a police report from the 2015 VR Stockholm Festival which saw loads of rapes.
[03:36:26.716 --> 03:36:34.438]  I don't have an exact figure in my head, but it was somewhere in the 30, 40, 50 sexual assaults they had at that festival.
[03:36:35.618 --> 03:36:40.399]  And according to a police report, every single attacker there were migrants.
[03:36:40.979 --> 03:36:47.221]  Of course, this didn't make it into the press or the newspapers, but this was a leaked police report that came out.
[03:36:48.241 --> 03:36:53.202]  And if you look at the people that are behind
[03:36:55.124 --> 03:37:03.630]  Most of these rapes and attacks in Sweden, it's almost every single instance where you can, where you are able to find the name and the identity of the attacker.
[03:37:03.890 --> 03:37:06.291]  It's almost always migrants.
[03:37:07.772 --> 03:37:16.958]  Particularly, you know, you have Mohammed, you have Hassan, Bashir, you know, this kind of very Middle Eastern sounding names.
[03:37:18.223 --> 03:37:24.629]  Which is exactly what Peter Springer said, the cop who blew the whistle on crimes that he was dealing with, the ex-police chief.
[03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:26.491]  It was always Middle Eastern names.
[03:37:26.891 --> 03:37:33.138]  Some of these rapes and sexual assaults in these music festivals, which have been going on for years now, not just this summer.
[03:37:33.778 --> 03:37:34.978]  Absolutely horrific.
[03:37:35.018 --> 03:37:36.959]  We're not just talking about groping.
[03:37:37.419 --> 03:37:43.541]  In one instance, I remember they literally raped a woman in the middle of a field in front of a stage.
[03:37:43.941 --> 03:37:47.522]  I mean, it led to big acts pulling out these concerts altogether.
[03:37:47.562 --> 03:37:49.483]  I think Mumford & Sons was one of them.
[03:37:50.083 --> 03:37:53.624]  Now they're saying, oh, we're just going to cancel the concert or we can ban all men.
[03:37:54.104 --> 03:38:00.826]  But again, the other angle to this, and you alluded to this, is the ethnicity of these individuals is coming out again and again.
[03:38:01.086 --> 03:38:03.027]  The solution to that is not to ask,
[03:38:03.777 --> 03:38:08.760]  Wired certain individuals with certain ethnicities, certain backgrounds, carrying out these assaults.
[03:38:09.141 --> 03:38:16.485]  The solution, and we've seen this in Germany as well, they're now saying they're just going to cover up ethnicity in crime reports altogether.
[03:38:16.505 --> 03:38:20.088]  In fact, here's a headline out of Spicer, which I want to read to you.
[03:38:20.488 --> 03:38:22.209]  Sweden to ban alternative media.
[03:38:22.589 --> 03:38:29.174]  By changing the constitution, the Swedish government wants to prohibit websites that reveal the ethnicity of convicted criminals.
[03:38:29.918 --> 03:38:42.063]  So it appears that instead of addressing the issues raised by critics of mass immigration, Peter, the government is simply attempting to ban criticism of mass immigration altogether, right?
[03:38:42.983 --> 03:38:44.384]  Yes, you're 100% correct.
[03:38:44.804 --> 03:38:54.208]  The Swedish government, which is a socialist government, and I would say they're voting on communism, they're that authoritarian.
[03:38:55.559 --> 03:39:08.031]  They're looking to ban alternative media like Fria Tider, who are reporting on the ethnicity or race or religion of people that are convicted of crime.
[03:39:08.732 --> 03:39:17.481]  And then, because Fria Tider, for example, is a very good alternative news source in Sweden, which I work with a bit.
[03:39:18.689 --> 03:39:23.193]  And they are quite good at digging up some information, some court cases.
[03:39:23.213 --> 03:39:25.615]  You can see who some of these attackers are.
[03:39:25.635 --> 03:39:33.521]  So, for example, you have... There was one Afghan guy who raped a 13-year-old girl.
[03:39:33.541 --> 03:39:37.524]  And he got, what was it, three months prison.
[03:39:38.304 --> 03:39:41.006]  And this was completely unreported in the mainstream media.
[03:39:41.847 --> 03:39:45.149]  But these guys managed to dig up the info and you could see that it was a...
[03:39:46.314 --> 03:39:48.716]  I'm also one of these migrants from Afghanistan.
[03:39:50.938 --> 03:39:53.139]  Yeah, no, I mean, that is a great website.
[03:39:53.199 --> 03:39:57.023]  I translate a lot of articles from Friartida, I think you said it was.
[03:39:57.563 --> 03:40:06.350]  Yeah, and I mean, the other aspect of this is when these victims get raped in many cases, and we've seen this in the Calais migrant camps as well,
[03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:08.811]  They actually apologise for being raped.
[03:40:08.871 --> 03:40:17.536]  So they don't want to complain about being raped, some of these individuals, because they fear they might be seen as racist simply for complaining about being raped.
[03:40:17.576 --> 03:40:24.981]  And that's also reflected with the authorities who, as you said, these rapists are sometimes out within three months.
[03:40:25.461 --> 03:40:29.783]  We're talking about migrants who sexually molest children in some cases.
[03:40:30.224 --> 03:40:35.527]  Oh, but they claim to be minors themselves, so they can't be hit with the full brunt of the law.
[03:40:36.147 --> 03:40:45.989]  And then we had a study in Sweden, it was, I think it was, what was it, two-thirds of self-proclaimed child migrants, I think it was around that number, maybe higher, maybe even 75%.
[03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:56.432]  They did studies, they did bone density studies into the migrants claiming to be children in Sweden and found that it was either two-thirds or three-quarters were adults.
[03:40:56.792 --> 03:41:03.779]  They were completely lying, and they lie to get away with crimes to get away with lesser punishments, right?
[03:41:03.799 --> 03:41:06.862]  And that was a Swedish government study, correct?
[03:41:08.015 --> 03:41:12.376]  Yes, that's from the Swedish police actually, that study that you just quoted there.
[03:41:13.517 --> 03:41:20.578]  And yes, if you look at almost every single one of these rape attacks, they always claim to be children.
[03:41:21.219 --> 03:41:30.241]  And in almost every single instance, the court just takes them on a road and sentences them as children basically.
[03:41:31.862 --> 03:41:32.622]  So for example,
[03:41:33.675 --> 03:41:35.036]  I have one example recently here.
[03:41:35.116 --> 03:41:37.699]  A 16-year-old girl that was gang raped by three migrants.
[03:41:39.240 --> 03:41:41.542]  Two of them claimed to be under 18.
[03:41:41.682 --> 03:41:47.847]  One guy got 10 months youth care.
[03:41:47.907 --> 03:41:49.228]  Not prison, but youth care.
[03:41:49.709 --> 03:41:51.470]  Another guy got one year's youth care.
[03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:55.834]  I mean, youth care is quite nice in Sweden.
[03:41:55.874 --> 03:42:00.178]  You're locked in a building, but you get everything you want.
[03:42:00.777 --> 03:42:02.458]  You know, PlayStation and everything.
[03:42:02.478 --> 03:42:03.979]  It's not like a prison at all.
[03:42:04.359 --> 03:42:06.881]  It's a youth care.
[03:42:06.901 --> 03:42:12.324]  They just have to claim to be under 18 to be children and they get these sentences in Sweden.
[03:42:12.344 --> 03:42:12.884]  It's insane.
[03:42:13.965 --> 03:42:15.126]  Because of political correctness.
[03:42:16.167 --> 03:42:16.847]  Exactly.
[03:42:17.268 --> 03:42:18.568]  It's the tolerance.
[03:42:18.588 --> 03:42:19.689]  You have to believe them.
[03:42:20.169 --> 03:42:29.874]  I mean, there's this whole atmosphere in Sweden, and it was emphasised after Trump came out with his last night in Sweden thing, which, of course, the left and the liberal media all jumped on.
[03:42:29.894 --> 03:42:32.935]  They were like, oh my God, look, he's been proven spectacularly wrong.
[03:42:33.256 --> 03:42:38.558]  The very next night, there were huge riots, mass burnings of cars, as happened all the time.
[03:42:39.099 --> 03:42:42.140]  Oh, and the media suddenly didn't want to talk about Sweden.
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:43.841]  They suddenly changed the subject after
[03:42:44.341 --> 03:42:48.945]  Real events began to prove Donald Trump right, and they tried to... It became a bit inconvenient.
[03:42:48.985 --> 03:42:51.267]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:42:52.267 --> 03:42:54.989]  Yeah, it became a bit inconvenient to report on Sweden all of a sudden.
[03:42:55.009 --> 03:43:04.397]  Yeah, it's... It's been... When you mention these kind of riots in Sweden, that's happening a lot more than you think.
[03:43:05.598 --> 03:43:12.203]  So Rinkeby, which... which there were riots the night after Trump's tweet,
[03:43:13.196 --> 03:43:15.077]  Or where he spoke at the rally.
[03:43:16.458 --> 03:43:19.460]  Rinkeby is just 15 minutes from where I'm in the UK at the moment.
[03:43:19.500 --> 03:43:22.762]  But Rinkeby is just 15 minutes from where I used to live in Sweden.
[03:43:23.563 --> 03:43:25.744]  And so I know these areas pretty well.
[03:43:26.505 --> 03:43:30.407]  And these areas are... You don't want to go in these areas.
[03:43:30.427 --> 03:43:32.088]  They are no-go zones for a reason.
[03:43:33.069 --> 03:43:39.433]  So the police, for example, whenever they go into these no-go zones, they always have special helmets to protect them from rocks.
[03:43:40.373 --> 03:43:41.594]  They have, you know,
[03:43:42.563 --> 03:43:44.204]  This is terrible for society, isn't it?
[03:44:02.322 --> 03:44:06.746]  Some of these no-go zones are 90, 95, almost 100% Muslim.
[03:44:06.766 --> 03:44:14.173]  So it's very much a separate society and they don't interact with the rest of society and that creates a lot of problems.
[03:44:15.683 --> 03:44:25.868]  And even to discuss those problems in Sweden is not only seen as politically correct, but, you know, they're now talking about knocking on people's doors and naming and shaming them in newspapers.
[03:44:26.128 --> 03:44:31.270]  The thing about the no-go zones is it's not just police, it's ambulance workers who are being attacked.
[03:44:31.350 --> 03:44:32.751]  They're being pelted by roses.
[03:44:33.591 --> 03:44:35.433]  Firefighters?
[03:44:35.453 --> 03:44:39.977]  But the left media says, oh, they're not no-go zones because the police do go there.
[03:44:40.258 --> 03:44:43.801]  Yeah, they have to wear frigging body armor and get rocks thrown at their head.
[03:44:44.101 --> 03:44:46.143]  That's the very essence of the no-go zone.
[03:44:46.403 --> 03:44:49.306]  If you do go there, then you're going to get violently attacked.
[03:44:49.566 --> 03:44:50.947]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:44:51.228 --> 03:44:54.851]  And as you said, it was actually the very night that Trump gave that speech
[03:44:55.311 --> 03:44:57.515]  Last night in Sweden, there were these huge riots.
[03:44:57.915 --> 03:45:00.359]  The left was completely embarrassed by that.
[03:45:00.619 --> 03:45:03.643]  They suddenly stopped talking about Sweden pretty often after that.
[03:45:04.144 --> 03:45:10.953]  We've got an article here just illustrating the cultural impact that this has had, not just from a security perspective.
[03:45:11.554 --> 03:45:17.677]  New study, at least 150,000 genitally mutilated women in Sweden.
[03:45:18.698 --> 03:45:20.779]  150,000 victims of female genital mutilation.
[03:45:21.159 --> 03:45:27.563]  And of course, most of those individuals will already have been victims of FGM before coming into the country.
[03:45:27.923 --> 03:45:30.424]  So this is the culture that they're importing.
[03:45:30.845 --> 03:45:32.225]  We had another story, Peter.
[03:45:32.286 --> 03:45:38.369]  Swedish government orders clinic to end treatment for rape victims in favour of treating migrants.
[03:45:38.689 --> 03:45:50.398]  So they actually shut down a government clinic in Stockholm, devoted at least partly to treating female rape victims, of which there are many more in Sweden over the past three, four years, as we've seen.
[03:45:50.858 --> 03:45:56.623]  The rape rate has skyrocketed after they changed the definition of rape.
[03:45:56.643 --> 03:46:01.566]  So that whole argument, oh, that's just because they changed the definition, that's complete nonsense.
[03:46:01.606 --> 03:46:03.528]  It kept on skyrocketing after that, correct?
[03:46:05.069 --> 03:46:14.754]  Yes, the left always goes on about this changing definition of the rape, and that's supposedly the reason why rape has increased so much.
[03:46:15.374 --> 03:46:25.779]  Well, if you look at this year, so far the first six months in 2017, we had a 14% increase of rapes in Sweden compared to the same period last year.
[03:46:26.959 --> 03:46:31.922]  So yes, even with the so-called new definition, it's still continued to
[03:46:33.042 --> 03:46:35.504]  It's like a rocket, the rape statistics.
[03:46:35.584 --> 03:46:47.874]  So in total, the first six months this year, we had 3,430 rapes, of which 43% of those were actually, the victims were actually children.
[03:46:47.894 --> 03:46:51.256]  So we're actually talking about pedophilia here.
[03:46:52.097 --> 03:46:54.299]  You would think that's an insane number.
[03:46:55.054 --> 03:46:56.816]  And we think that Sweden is a small country.
[03:46:56.836 --> 03:46:58.597]  It's only 10 million people living in Sweden.
[03:46:59.158 --> 03:47:01.320]  The statistic gets really, really bad.
[03:47:01.340 --> 03:47:15.773]  And if you look at other crimes as well, such as violent shooting, and other violent crimes that has continued to rise over the years as more migrants are poured in Sweden as well, which I say,
[03:47:17.088 --> 03:47:24.650]  These two things combined would tend to kind of debunk this whole thing about very broad definition of rape that the left keeps claiming.
[03:47:25.890 --> 03:47:33.672]  Because the statistics of violent crime has continued to rise at the same rate, roughly, as the statistic with rape.
[03:47:33.812 --> 03:47:44.214]  And because they correlate with the amount of migrants coming in, I would say that the so-called broad definition of rape that the left talks about isn't really
[03:47:45.766 --> 03:47:51.750]  That isn't really valid, I would say it's a kind of... it's fake news.
[03:47:52.691 --> 03:47:57.254]  Exactly, it doesn't explain the spike after that definition was changed.
[03:47:57.914 --> 03:48:02.838]  Because it kept going up and on in correlation with the migrants coming in.
[03:48:02.858 --> 03:48:05.119]  Also, 90% Peter, 90% of shootings in Sweden, we have this article,
[03:48:11.698 --> 03:48:12.158]  We're good to go.
[03:48:39.498 --> 03:48:44.182]  I have a feeling that the Swedish Democrats will win the next election, that's my gut feeling.
[03:48:44.202 --> 03:48:53.169]  A lot of Swedish people are beginning to, at least more and more Swedish people are beginning to wake up and are quite upset at the situation in Sweden.
[03:48:54.930 --> 03:49:03.916]  As for them being conservative, not that conservative compared to America maybe, but very conservative compared to other parties in Sweden.
[03:49:04.997 --> 03:49:07.338]  They are the most right-wing kind of big party.
[03:49:07.398 --> 03:49:09.940]  Anything right and bad was conservative in Sweden.
[03:49:09.960 --> 03:49:12.902]  So you think they've got a good chance?
[03:49:12.962 --> 03:49:15.804]  I mean, this really emphasizes it for me.
[03:49:16.444 --> 03:49:17.405]  It's so bad.
[03:49:18.118 --> 03:49:21.580]  You know, you've got people claiming there's no problem in Sweden because of mass immigration.
[03:49:21.620 --> 03:49:26.602]  If that was the case, why is the only anti-mass immigration party the biggest party?
[03:49:26.822 --> 03:49:29.683]  That kind of suggests that Sweden has some problems, right?
[03:49:30.908 --> 03:49:34.169]  Yeah, I think you're onto something there.
[03:49:35.390 --> 03:49:41.752]  And especially if you look at, the Swedish Democrats are actually the third biggest party among migrants as well.
[03:49:42.692 --> 03:49:57.217]  But if you look only at the Swedish people, ethnic Swedish people, how they vote, there's no statistic on that, but I would definitely say that's probably well over 50% of ethnically Swedish people who are going to vote for a Swedish Democrat in the next election.
[03:49:58.695 --> 03:50:01.577]  And even among migrants, as I said, they are the third biggest party.
[03:50:02.877 --> 03:50:12.782]  But you know, there's so many migrants in Sweden now that they all vote for a left-leaning socialist government who will continue to have open borders.
[03:50:13.683 --> 03:50:15.864]  So all of the migrants obviously vote for the left.
[03:50:16.444 --> 03:50:18.385]  So they won't vote for the Swedish Democrats.
[03:50:20.206 --> 03:50:20.606]  Exactly.
[03:50:20.646 --> 03:50:22.147]  Now you're going to Sicily soon.
[03:50:22.207 --> 03:50:26.489]  Tell us what you hope to learn there, because that is really ground zero of what's happening, right?
[03:50:27.526 --> 03:50:28.287]  Correct, yes.
[03:50:28.347 --> 03:50:31.509]  I'm going to Sicily in about a week's time.
[03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:36.172]  Because in Sicily is the front line of the migrant crisis.
[03:50:36.232 --> 03:50:39.435]  So I want to go there on the ground to see what's actually happening.
[03:50:39.515 --> 03:50:43.778]  Because that's the first stop of all the problems that we see in Western Europe.
[03:50:43.798 --> 03:50:47.861]  Because all the migrants, many of the migrants, they come up from Africa.
[03:50:48.502 --> 03:50:55.727]  And they get put out in these little dingy rubber boats by human traffickers outside the coast of Libya.
[03:50:56.989 --> 03:50:58.972]  Hold on, I thought we got a break coming up.
[03:50:58.992 --> 03:51:01.596]  We'll be back with Peter Sweden after this break.
[03:51:01.796 --> 03:51:03.178]  Infowars.com, stay tuned.

[03:51:13.072 --> 03:51:13.893]  Barack Obama.

[03:51:21.397 --> 03:51:22.397]  Washington fat cats.

[03:51:31.222 --> 03:51:32.303]  Leonardo DiCaprio.

[03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:42.170]  George Clooney.
[03:51:42.431 --> 03:51:48.195]  A man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the open borders of Europe, so moved back to the United States.
[03:51:48.475 --> 03:51:49.296]  Bernie Sanders.
[03:51:49.556 --> 03:51:57.502]  The head commie who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is except himself, with his multiple houses and cars, and with his wife, under investigation for bank fraud.
[03:51:57.662 --> 03:51:59.263]  Don't fall victim to political fraud.

[03:54:12.598 --> 03:54:15.759]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.359 --> 03:54:20.200]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:54:22.201 --> 03:54:23.921]  Final segment of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:23.941 --> 03:54:25.802]  We're talking to Peter Sweden.
[03:54:25.862 --> 03:54:27.002]  Peter, you were cut off there.
[03:54:27.022 --> 03:54:28.843]  You were talking about your trip to Sicily.
[03:54:28.903 --> 03:54:33.144]  Tell us again about that and how people can find you on Twitter and YouTube.
[03:54:34.778 --> 03:54:46.203]  Yes, so I'm going to Sicily here in a week's time, roughly, where I will be reporting on the front lines of the marine crisis, because that's ground zero for the marine crisis.
[03:54:46.243 --> 03:54:53.307]  So I want to see what's actually happening there, because that's where all the miners are coming up to the rest of Europe, to Germany, France, the UK, Sweden.
[03:54:53.327 --> 03:54:57.329]  So I'll be going on the ground and reporting
[03:54:58.826 --> 03:55:02.957]  Reporting on the ships coming in, you know, see if we can get some interviews with some of the migrants perhaps.
[03:55:04.079 --> 03:55:06.826]  Probably see if we can interview some of the workers, the NGO workers.
[03:55:08.675 --> 03:55:11.397]  Interviewing locals there, see what they think about what's going on.
[03:55:12.578 --> 03:55:19.403]  And, you know, we'll be able to see what's actually going on the ground because the mainstream media simply isn't covering this stuff.
[03:55:19.884 --> 03:55:20.885]  They keep quiet about it.
[03:55:22.065 --> 03:55:36.737]  And because these NGO vessels, they go, as you talked about in your video earlier, the NGO vessels, they go down to the coast of Libya and they pick these migrants up, basically a taxi service up to Europe, up to Italy.
[03:55:37.666 --> 03:55:41.328]  Exactly, and they're in communication with the criminal people smugglers.
[03:55:41.388 --> 03:55:43.769]  We need these people arrested and prosecuted.
[03:55:43.809 --> 03:55:45.470]  That's the only thing that's going to fix it.
[03:55:45.890 --> 03:55:52.172]  Maybe you can get some actual footage of the migrant boats coming in and the fact that the vast majority of them are fighting-age males.
[03:55:52.232 --> 03:55:53.993]  Of course, the media doesn't show you that.
[03:55:54.273 --> 03:55:59.296]  They find a few women and children and that's what's on the evening news because they want to control that narrative.
[03:55:59.996 --> 03:56:02.417]  Peter, tell people where they can find you on Twitter and YouTube.
[03:56:03.553 --> 03:56:06.194]  Yeah, I'm on Twitter, at PeterSweden7.

[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:20.402]  I don't use it as much, but I'm there as well, at Peter Sweden there.
[03:56:21.906 --> 03:56:26.211]  Okay, and I encourage people to support your trip to Sicily by donating.
[03:56:26.231 --> 03:56:32.998]  We'll be sure to get you back on the show after that to get your report on ground zero of the contrived migrant crisis.
[03:56:33.058 --> 03:56:34.439]  Peter, thanks for joining us today.
[03:56:34.459 --> 03:56:35.901]  Thanks for having me on.

[03:57:24.277 --> 03:57:25.497]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:57:31.422 --> 03:57:33.143]  Let's get into a couple of final news stories.
[03:57:34.783 --> 03:57:39.264]  Sick viral YouTube video shows parents explaining masturbation to young children.
[03:57:39.484 --> 03:57:40.625]  We can't play the video.
[03:57:40.805 --> 03:57:41.805]  It's completely graphic.
[03:57:41.865 --> 03:57:42.565]  It's disgusting.
[03:57:43.525 --> 03:57:48.226]  Another example of the media making sexualization of children normal.
[03:57:48.706 --> 03:57:50.827]  You saw them give a platform, salon.com.
[03:57:51.644 --> 03:57:52.645]  We're good to go.
[03:58:11.634 --> 03:58:14.917]  Google-owned YouTube decided to make Trend.
[03:58:15.217 --> 03:58:22.823]  They control that trending list, it's not organic, so they deliberately picked a video where children as young as 8 years old are shown.
[03:58:24.125 --> 03:58:29.768]  By their, quote, parents, even though it doesn't appear that way in some of the cases, talking about this despicable stuff.
[03:58:30.128 --> 03:58:32.209]  Don't sexualize kids that young.
[03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:33.090]  It's disgusting.
[03:58:33.150 --> 03:58:33.590]  It's sick.
[03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:34.510]  It has to stop.
[03:58:34.971 --> 03:58:38.152]  That's going to wrap it up for this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:38.192 --> 03:58:39.133]  Nightly News coming back.
[03:58:39.233 --> 03:58:40.974]  Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow.
[03:58:41.474 --> 03:58:43.515]  InfoWars.com, thanks for joining us.
[03:58:45.596 --> 03:58:49.538]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.672 --> 03:58:59.534]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:58:59.734 --> 03:59:01.255]  The contest is simple.
[03:59:01.475 --> 03:59:06.316]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:59:06.496 --> 03:59:13.879]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:59:14.039 --> 03:59:20.601]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:20.701 --> 03:59:30.584]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:59:30.764 --> 03:59:38.327]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:59:38.507 --> 03:59:48.452]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:59:48.592 --> 03:59:51.934]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[03:59:51.954 --> 03:59:52.934]  This is Kit Daniels.
[03:59:55.816 --> 03:59:59.718]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
