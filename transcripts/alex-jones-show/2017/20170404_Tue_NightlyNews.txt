[00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.572]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:22.675]  It is Tuesday, April 4th, 2017.
[00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:25.639]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.564]  Tonight!
[00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.926]  What a difference a president makes!
[00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:42.750]  Since Donald Trump has stepped into the White House, illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border has dropped a staggering 67%.
[00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:59.336]  Meanwhile, Border Patrol and police are preparing for a hostile environment in San Diego, as they prepare to establish buffer zones around the construction of Trump's wall.
[00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:07.923]  Back then, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice ordered intelligence agencies to spy on Donald Trump.
[00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:13.327]  But according to CNN's Don Lemon, I'm just insulting your intelligence.
[00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:16.290]  There is no evidence that backs up the President's original point.
[00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.633]  All that plus much more, up next, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:36.732]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:37.492]  I take this.
[00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:38.773]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:43.096]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:47.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.041]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.922]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:05.304]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.184]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.145]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.446]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:14.866]  I love it.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.629]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.810]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.778]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.420]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.882]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:04.124 --> 00:03:08.227]  Well, this Susan Rice scandal is the biggest thing since Watergate.
[00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:13.612]  So big, in fact, that if you turned on the mainstream media right now, they wouldn't even be talking about it at all.
[00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.853]  They're doing everything they can to bury it.
[00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:22.299]  Like clockwork, we have another alleged gas attack, sarin gas attack there in Syria.
[00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.499]  You know, who knows?
[00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.041]  That could have happened a while ago, but they just decided to roll it out now if it even happened at all.
[00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:39.047]  And of course, there's this other bombshell revelation that a Blackwater employee met with the Russians in the Seychelles to try to establish a backdoor channel with the Trump team.
[00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:48.430]  How convenient that this scandal drops today when this bombshell is breaking all over the Obama administration.
[00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.090]  I'm going to pull a Don Lemon and you know what?
[00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:00.132]  I am going to ignore your news altogether because it is fake news and it doesn't need to be broadcast over our airwaves because it show fake news.
[00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:04.513]  So we're going to move on to the latest real news here with this border battle.
[00:04:04.613 --> 00:04:09.394]  We will have a little bit more on Susan Rice coming up with Mike Cernovich who actually forced
[00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:12.038]  He broke another huge story here on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:26.879]  But again, back to this border battle.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.967]  So we've got the former border commissioner telling Congress today that illegal immigration is actually down 67% under Trump.
[00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:36.428]  So that is incredible.
[00:04:36.488 --> 00:04:41.452]  Now the Washington Times tried to get confirmation on those numbers from Customs and Border Protection.
[00:04:42.453 --> 00:05:01.773]  But they say, you know, a drop anywhere close to the 67% figure cited would be stunning, suggesting that the early steps the president has taken to free up the agents to actually enforce immigration laws at the interior and the border, and of course this promise to build the wall, has deterred tens of thousands of would-be crossers.
[00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:04.977]  Down 67% as the same this time last year.
[00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:06.238]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.570]  And on that wall, contractors who are actually putting in bids are now bracing for a very hostile environment.
[00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.514]  Protesters want to be there on both sides of the wall.
[00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:18.595]  More than 500 companies
[00:05:20.297 --> 00:05:26.060]  So far have bid to build the wall and some of these contractors have expressed concerns for their safety.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.662]  Michael Evangelista Isasaga, he's the chief executive of the Penta Group here in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:42.227]  He said he's received about a dozen death threats since publicly expressing interest in bidding, including one from a woman who said she's going to hire a private investigator to trail him.
[00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:47.910]  And this contractor said, you know, he wanted to do his part because building a wall is imperative
[00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.031]  I don't think so.
[00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:18.269]  So a lot of interested companies are actually expecting a violent backlash and they're wondering, they're asking the government if some border patrol agents are going to come to their aid immediately, if they'll rush in if they find themselves in a hostile attack.
[00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:25.852]  They're also asking if their employees will be able to carry firearms in states with very tight gun control restrictions.
[00:06:25.872 --> 00:06:26.473]  So, so far...
[00:06:27.313 --> 00:06:35.737]  Officials have said that the Border Patrol and local police are going to establish a buffer zone around the construction sites if that's necessary.
[00:06:36.237 --> 00:06:45.081]  And the San Diego Police and the Sheriff's Department, they're going to respect everybody's constitutional rights as long as they're peaceful, law-abiding protesters there.
[00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.343]  But again, very interesting to note that the wall is being built in the 100-mile
[00:06:50.763 --> 00:06:57.767]  Constitution-free zone, so it'll be very interesting to see how those constitutional rights are respected there at the border wall.
[00:06:57.827 --> 00:07:02.549]  But let's move on now to a story that is incredibly important to tell.
[00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:14.336]  It's noteworthy not just because of the brutality of this story, but the viciousness that was committed by illegal immigrants was actually committed by illegal immigrant
[00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:15.336]  Gang members.
[00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:23.401]  And these are MS-13 gang members who are moving away from the coast and they're now moving to these rural areas to commit these crimes.
[00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:30.505]  And you guessed it, sanctuary cities where they are being protected by these don't ask policies.
[00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:36.288]  Now I was able to interview the investigative journalist who was able to tie all of this information together.
[00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:53.995]  To say, you know what, this dead 17-year-old boy that you found face down in the dirt just so happened to be a victim of crime from the MS-13 gang members that they don't want to tell you about because this is an area where they're really trying to push for this open immigration.
[00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.257]  So this is my interview from earlier today with Jason Kessler.
[00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:57.817]  Take a listen.
[00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:04.371]  Just a bit of a warning, the story that you are about to hear might be very disturbing to some viewers.
[00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:08.356]  This is a story about the murder of 17-year-old Raymond Wood.
[00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:12.401]  His body was found mutilated by MS-13 gang members.
[00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.424]  Now some of his family is speaking out.
[00:08:14.484 --> 00:08:15.505]  They feel it's important.
[00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:26.690]  That these ghastly details of the story get out to the American people so that people can understand just the severity of the Latin gang issue that we're facing here in this country.
[00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.511]  Take a listen to Dale Wood, Raymond Wood's uncle.
[00:08:31.732 --> 00:08:33.833]  His hands were cut off.
[00:08:34.694 --> 00:08:35.834]  His throat was cut.
[00:08:37.415 --> 00:08:39.415]  His tongue was poured into his throat.
[00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:42.517]  He was stabbed 16 times.
[00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:45.158]  Ran over three times.
[00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.661]  How do you do that to a child?
[00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:52.301]  How do you do that to anybody?
[00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:56.704]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:08:57.244 --> 00:09:00.786]  I mean, it's definitely not human.
[00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:02.707]  These are monsters.
[00:09:03.973 --> 00:09:05.774]  And now my guest today is Jason Kessler.
[00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:10.397]  You're an investigative journalist as well as the president of Unity and Security.
[00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:16.681]  It's a non-profit working to put America first as far as immigration policy is concerned.
[00:09:17.622 --> 00:09:18.002]  Thank you.
[00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:22.405]  Welcome to the show and please give us some details on this story.
[00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:27.288]  You were actually able to connect the dots in this crime that a community really wanted to hide.
[00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:29.203]  Sure.
[00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:29.443]  Yeah.
[00:09:29.483 --> 00:09:31.444]  Thank you for having me back on InfoWars.
[00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:32.504]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:09:32.564 --> 00:09:34.805]  I wish it was under better circumstances.
[00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:44.008]  I was contacted by some friends in the Lynchburg, Virginia area who were telling me about this horrific crime that had happened in the area.
[00:09:44.448 --> 00:09:48.629]  And there were so many rumors swirling around, people didn't know what to make of it.
[00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:53.511]  What had happened was a young man, Raymond Wood, only 17 years old,
[00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:55.972]  We're good to go.
[00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:13.809]  And at first they weren't saying there was a connection to the crime.
[00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.472]  They were saying that these men were detained because they were illegal.
[00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:28.861]  Then a third man, Jose Correa Ventura, was arrested and they said that it was in connection to a murder in Montgomery County, Maryland, way back in July of 2016.
[00:10:28.922 --> 00:10:30.803]  This guy had been on the run.
[00:10:31.183 --> 00:10:38.930]  And in that case, MS-13 gang members had lured a young man into the woods using a woman promising sex.
[00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.471]  And when the young man
[00:10:41.246 --> 00:10:43.026]  Got into the rural area.
[00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:44.547]  They stabbed him 40 times.
[00:10:45.087 --> 00:10:56.290]  So all three of these men were then connected by Immigration's Customs Enforcement to the MS-13 gang, which is El Salvadoran.
[00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:04.492]  It was originally started in Los Angeles, but now it's international and sometimes they're guided by the Mexican cartels.
[00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:10.093]  So I think what sets the story apart from the deluge of
[00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:11.500]  We're good to go.
[00:11:31.684 --> 00:11:41.848]  Sixteen times, ran over three times, and then they pulled his tongue through his neck in what's called a Colombian necktie.
[00:11:43.249 --> 00:11:54.834]  It's supposed to be a very brutal type of murder that sends a message to anybody that they do business with or anybody in the drug world that they have to be feared and respected.
[00:11:56.043 --> 00:12:06.990]  And this is a 17-year-old boy who, you know, I don't know anything about him, but it's pretty hard to think that he's really involved in gang-related crime there.
[00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:17.457]  So why do you think there was, why do you think people were attempting to maybe cover up the connection between the gang members and this gruesome crime?
[00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:19.458]  Why do you think there is such a hesitation?
[00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:27.519]  Well, first of all, as far as the motive goes, the police have confirmed that it was narcotics related, so I'll let that speak for itself.
[00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:33.304]  That, you know, despite whether people are involved in
[00:12:34.764 --> 00:12:38.087]  Narcotics whatsoever, they don't deserve to have this kind of fate.
[00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:42.970]  And we need to protect American citizens from people who are trying to do this.
[00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:51.576]  But I think that the people, the good people of Bedford County and of Lynchburg and rural Virginia, they wanted this to get out.
[00:12:51.657 --> 00:12:56.240]  They were lighting up the Facebook message board saying, hey, somebody's got to do something.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.482]  These MS-13 people have infested our community.
[00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:04.743]  There's a lot of them living in the trailer parks, I've been told.
[00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:07.343]  They're going to the schools.
[00:13:07.784 --> 00:13:14.105]  And the Sheriff of Bedford County, Mike Brown, has been blowing the whistle for 20 years trying to get people to take this serious.
[00:13:14.806 --> 00:13:18.707]  And so I hope this will be the incident that opens their eyes.
[00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:48.927]  As far as why the media wasn't making this connection, I think that whenever the mainstream media gets a hold of a narrative, no matter how shocking that conflicts with liberal, progressive, multiculturalism, this kind of stuff, that might make illegal immigration or immigration in general look like it might not be the best thing in the world, then they want to wait forever until they report it because they don't want to report it.
[00:13:49.727 --> 00:13:56.010]  Absolutely, and we see that over and over again because we know they don't want to shy away from telling stories about crime.
[00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:10.075]  That's a ratings bonanza, but when it's something that is going to actually give pause to people who are going to be voting for immigration policy either way, are actually going to be showing up to their elected representatives and saying, hell no,
[00:14:10.795 --> 00:14:13.116]  To, you know, open borders.
[00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:14.637]  That's where it's going to give them pause.
[00:14:14.677 --> 00:14:20.000]  And so you're saying that this is a very noteworthy story beyond the brutality of this crime.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.442]  It's not just another illegal alien crime committed.
[00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:36.969]  It is massively brutal, but it's a troubling trend where we're seeing the MS-13 gang members moving away from the East Coast and moving into these more like the suburb areas or rural areas.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:45.868]  Yeah, I started investigating this because a lot of people who were telling me about it were saying, well, we've known about the MS-13 problem for years.
[00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.731]  We've known that their home base on the East Coast is Maryland.
[00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:56.959]  For me, I was most recently investigating Antifa and these sort of spoiled middle class kids, and I thought they were bad.
[00:14:57.319 --> 00:15:14.745]  When I started looking into MS-13, I saw this is a whole other level of torture, a lot of times directed by the Mexican cartels, of mutilation, of mass murder, revenge, extortion, it's terrible.
[00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:20.540]  I've been able to find articles from Fox News, from Washington Post.
[00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:27.284]  One of the Washington Post articles was called Gangs Find Bukala Territory in Rural Virginia.
[00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:32.648]  So what's going on is these guys might be in these urban areas and if
[00:15:33.388 --> 00:15:34.289]  We're good to go.
[00:15:52.523 --> 00:15:58.087]  Where people are maybe skeptical of people they don't know, especially if they don't speak the language and so forth.
[00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:04.392]  But essentially, it's become stigmatized to question people who are illegal immigrants.
[00:16:04.552 --> 00:16:08.856]  And you have all these liberal people showing up at airports and so forth.
[00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:10.277]  We're good to go.
[00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:36.393]  There's no doubt that it's allowed these stone cold killers to exist within our communities and people avert their eyes and they just say it's none of my business.
[00:16:36.754 --> 00:16:39.057]  I think people need to start making it their business.
[00:16:39.117 --> 00:16:42.723]  I think that they need to contact their representatives and
[00:16:43.724 --> 00:16:52.472]  Make sure that there are resources for ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, to look into these people and look into their immigration statuses.
[00:16:52.893 --> 00:17:02.041]  And we need to push for our elected representatives in Congress, Senate, and for Donald Trump to build the wall and to enforce the laws as they're written.
[00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.585]  Because there's a lot of laws out there that are saying that it's
[00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:12.989]  It could be a felony to harbor illegal immigrants, and that includes helping them find housing, helping them find employment.
[00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:21.393]  So these people who are doing that are allowing these murderers and rapists and so forth to live within the communities.
[00:17:21.453 --> 00:17:25.115]  They don't have to be checked by customs when they're coming across the border.
[00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:34.260]  They don't have to be checked by employer when they're getting a job, and they're not forced to learn the language or assimilate in any way, shape or form.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.442]  Well, and right, and we're actually seeing that just recently with this Rockville rape, of course, in Maryland.
[00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:42.783]  They go to these communities where it's a don't ask community.
[00:17:42.843 --> 00:17:45.544]  We'll even let you in the schools even though you're 20 years old.
[00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:46.805]  You can be there with the ninth graders.
[00:17:47.325 --> 00:17:48.405]  Jason, thank you so much.
[00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:49.666]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:52.007]  Everyone go to unityandsecurity.org.
[00:17:52.047 --> 00:17:56.809]  You can donate there and you give a lot of information about how they can support their politicians.
[00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:57.209]  Thank you.
[00:17:57.625 --> 00:18:00.986]  Yeah, I will just say real quick that we are also an activist organization.
[00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:18.009]  So if anybody wants to get involved in their communities to make change in those organizations, in our country, to fight back against illegal immigration, you can contact me at jason at unityandsecurity.org and you can become a regional coordinator to make changes to make sure Donald Trump keeps his promises.
[00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:19.530]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:20.810]  Thank you.
[00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:09.360]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:15.986]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.397]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.519]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.344]  It works!
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:48.907]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:58.509]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.330]  A total 360 win!
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.192]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:04.252]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.438]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.119]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:21.699]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:28.943]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:36.767]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.289]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.915]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.038]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.740]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.321]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.522]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.542 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.934]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.238]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.462]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:28.143]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:33.345]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:37.106]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:44.908]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:48.309]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my feet.
[00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.970]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:56.867]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[00:21:56.888 --> 00:21:58.231]  No fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.462]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:08.843]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:20.105]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.405]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:27.546]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.047]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:33.287]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.389]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.750]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.631]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:52.772]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.682]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:04.778 --> 00:23:07.280]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.665]  We're here in Los Angeles, California, outside of the Catholic Archdiocese.
[00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:26.057]  Now, this is a place where recently, actually not too long ago, in 2007, they settled a case that involved 508 victims of molestation.
[00:23:26.097 --> 00:23:31.642]  These were mostly all children that were molested by priests and members of the Catholic Order.
[00:23:32.122 --> 00:23:35.123]  Now, this was a huge figure that they settled for.
[00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:46.566]  It was around $660 million, which is an absolute record-breaking amount of money that went toward these victims for the trauma and abuse that they underwent.
[00:23:46.906 --> 00:23:50.767]  Now, the big controversial thing here is, how did so many
[00:23:51.287 --> 00:23:54.109]  Children get molested, and how did it go on for so long?
[00:23:54.149 --> 00:24:08.919]  Well, there were efforts to cover it up by the church, and this is just an example of how these, you know, positions of power and these organizations out there, they are going to do anything they can to cover things up for the betterment of their organization.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:19.407]  Just as you would see members of different political parties covering things up, and members of elite circles in Hollywood are going to do things to cover things up.
[00:24:19.787 --> 00:24:21.368]  So just another example, guys.
[00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:30.575]  I mean, pedophilia is a major problem in the city of Los Angeles, in California in general, and in the United States of America.
[00:24:31.315 --> 00:24:35.258]  Also, this is continuing because even in 2013 there was a case where
[00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:38.840]  Four children that have been molested.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.324]  We're now asking for a settlement of $10 million again for more molestation cases.
[00:24:45.424 --> 00:24:52.509]  I mean, how many of these people haven't even come forward and I'm sure it's still probably happening to this day.
[00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:57.572]  So we will keep you guys updated on more of our investigation as we go along.
[00:24:57.992 --> 00:25:00.894]  I'm Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[00:25:04.172 --> 00:25:06.753]  Let's go to Millie Weaver, joining us from California.
[00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:07.573]  She's been all over the state.
[00:25:07.613 --> 00:25:08.734]  I'll ask her where she's at.
[00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:10.014]  Looks like L.A.
[00:25:10.054 --> 00:25:10.314]  to me.
[00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:16.156]  Investigating the admitted 474 reported pedophiles, including kids and enslavement.
[00:25:16.476 --> 00:25:17.437]  They've been to the Sheriff's Department.
[00:25:17.457 --> 00:25:18.797]  They're doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work.
[00:25:18.837 --> 00:25:20.138]  When they come back, you'll be hearing about.
[00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:23.479]  But Millie, thank you so much for sitting there for 15 minutes with Mike Cernovich.
[00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:26.720]  We got him on a little bit late, but I tell you, this is all coming together, isn't it?
[00:25:27.697 --> 00:25:28.297]  Yes, it is.
[00:25:28.357 --> 00:25:29.478]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:31.359]  You know, we're out here in California.
[00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:38.002]  California has the highest number of reported cases of human trafficking out of all the states in the United States.
[00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:41.744]  So, we're just out here investigating, seeing what we can find.
[00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:51.950]  We're going to be talking with various law enforcement agencies as well as non-profit groups that actually first-hand rescue children from these sex traffickers.
[00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:58.915]  And we're even going to be talking with someone that's going to take us into the deep web where they sell these children online.
[00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:02.618]  It's pretty disturbing, but you know, we have Hollywood out here.
[00:26:02.678 --> 00:26:14.267]  We've had people like Corey Feldman come out speaking about pedophilia problems within Hollywood, and there's a lot of rumors, a lot of stories about massive pedophile rings amongst the Hollywood elite, Alex.
[00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:16.054]  Well, there's been a lot of busts, too.
[00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:18.516]  Yeah, nearly 500 arrests in California human trafficking raids.
[00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:20.157]  They call it human trafficking on Reuters.
[00:26:20.217 --> 00:26:21.077]  It's little kids.
[00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:26.501]  28 children reported missing, kidnapped, forced into prostitution.
[00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:27.282]  Okay?
[00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:29.303]  So this is confirmed.
[00:26:29.323 --> 00:26:32.145]  This is just one of over 3,000 arrests that have happened since Trump.
[00:26:32.165 --> 00:26:36.608]  I want to commend your courage and the crew, Zimmerman and others, for being out there, as well as Gavin.
[00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:43.533]  But I got to thank the listeners, the audience, our affiliates, for supporting us to be able to do this, Millie.
[00:26:44.397 --> 00:26:55.124]  Yeah, well, thank you listeners out there that are funding this because we're actually being able to really investigate, go and expose these pedophile networks out there.
[00:26:55.184 --> 00:27:03.510]  I mean, just being told a little bit with our anonymous source about the way they sell these children online, some of the gruesome stuff.
[00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.411]  I mean, we're not going to actually be showing any of that.
[00:27:05.451 --> 00:27:12.116]  We're not going to be seeing it firsthand, but we will take you guys in and show the websites where they're in fact
[00:27:12.356 --> 00:27:13.658]  The dark web.
[00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:14.319]  The dark web.
[00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:16.341]  And you're gonna obviously blur out his face.
[00:27:16.361 --> 00:27:20.487]  This is a respected person that's actually saved folks, involved with good folks in the federal government.
[00:27:20.827 --> 00:27:25.473]  I gotta tell you though, the special forces, the good people in the FBI, CIA, they're all ready to go.
[00:27:25.493 --> 00:27:29.057]  I mean, Trump has green-lighted a move against these people.
[00:27:29.318 --> 00:27:30.179]  That's why they're panicking.
[00:27:31.354 --> 00:27:33.095]  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty disturbing.
[00:27:33.215 --> 00:27:35.677]  Anyone would get motivated to want to try and stop this.
[00:27:35.757 --> 00:27:41.582]  And you know, Alex, if good men just turn the blind eye and they don't do anything, then evil will triumph.
[00:27:41.962 --> 00:27:43.103]  That's just what happens.
[00:27:43.443 --> 00:27:47.787]  So more people need to get out there and start, you know, going out and trying to fight this.
[00:27:47.827 --> 00:27:59.996]  And that's why we're going to be talking with law enforcement so that they can give us tips on signs to look for and how to report these type of situations when you see a child or a young girl or boy that you think is being trafficked.
[00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:02.390]  Absolutely, and you've got a lot.
[00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:07.016]  You've got a person that has been involved in finding child traffickers, pedophiles on the dark web or deep web.
[00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:10.439]  And we have another report, L.A., that goes directly to rescued victims.
[00:28:10.479 --> 00:28:11.180]  Also work with L.A.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.961]  County Sheriff's Department.
[00:28:12.321 --> 00:28:13.022]  Tell me about that.
[00:28:13.062 --> 00:28:13.543]  What's going on?
[00:28:13.563 --> 00:28:14.524]  I'm talking to the Sheriff's Department.
[00:28:15.356 --> 00:28:24.424]  Well, as far as talking with the Sheriff's Department, they've actually been very reciprocative and helping us go ahead and set up interviews.
[00:28:24.484 --> 00:28:38.556]  They've actually seemed pretty excited about getting that message out there and having more people hear from them that they really are fighting this and that they want to give people tips on how to stop this, which would lead to more busts for them.
[00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:42.379]  Because a lot of times what happens is these children or these young girls
[00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:45.622]  They are too afraid to come forward and say something themselves.
[00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:52.469]  A lot of them will actually defend their traffickers because they're afraid these traffickers threaten their families.
[00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:53.550]  Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.390]  Yes, exactly.
[00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.472]  They are terrified to come forward.
[00:28:56.733 --> 00:29:03.920]  So it actually is going to require your everyday citizens on the street paying attention to what's going on around them.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.242]  I mean, if you see some young girl with some
[00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:13.172]  Some older guy that looks kind of bizarre and maybe he's flying her to somewhere else and you're noticing something's off here.
[00:29:13.212 --> 00:29:14.735]  They don't look like they could be related.
[00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:19.522]  You know, it might be good to report something or, you know, have that looked into.
[00:29:19.642 --> 00:29:22.106]  And the problem is, is most people just mind their own business.
[00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:30.348]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:29:30.388 --> 00:29:44.970]  We are here in Los Angeles, California where we have been sent on a special mission to investigate human sex trafficking and particularly children being trafficked by pedophiles and to pedophile elites.
[00:29:45.331 --> 00:29:57.493]  So we're going to be investigating this guys and I just wanted to bring up a recent story that just came out last Friday where three university students were busted for engaging in prostitution.
[00:29:58.524 --> 00:30:01.426]  A case of foolish college kids hustling some bucks.
[00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:03.927]  Something they'll regret much later in life.
[00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:04.868]  What are you studying?
[00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:09.511]  I'm a biology major with a minor in criminal justice.
[00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.332]  Maybe it's a good thing you got arrested.
[00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:12.613]  Maybe it'll change your way.
[00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:15.294]  Hopefully you won't get arrested again and lead a new path.
[00:30:15.615 --> 00:30:16.935]  Just focus on school.
[00:30:16.976 --> 00:30:17.496]  You'll do well.
[00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:21.749]  Now, there were two females and one male.
[00:30:22.209 --> 00:30:26.693]  Samara Charlatan, 19, and Acacia Friedman, 23.
[00:30:26.853 --> 00:30:30.896]  And then, of course, there was Mari Noon, who was the male that was trafficking them.
[00:30:31.297 --> 00:30:41.866]  Now, what's interesting about this story is that one of the girls, Acacia Friedman, she herself actually can be seen on Facebook with her profile picture.
[00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:45.128]  Including her and Bill Clinton.
[00:30:45.188 --> 00:30:45.808]  That's right.
[00:30:45.848 --> 00:30:52.192]  So why is Bill Clinton being pictured with this girl who is a university student that prostitutes herself?
[00:30:52.552 --> 00:31:02.338]  Well, we've seen in the past of accusations against Bill Clinton for engaging in prostitution where he's, you know, hired prostitutes such as Danny Williams' mom.
[00:31:02.378 --> 00:31:07.121]  Danny Williams himself claiming that he himself is the son of Bill Clinton.
[00:31:07.441 --> 00:31:10.123]  So is this just another example of, you know,
[00:31:10.623 --> 00:31:25.079]  Prostitution and human trafficking and where we see these elites surrounding themselves with these these trafficked people and the other interesting thing here in this story is that this girl Samara Charlatan also was going to school
[00:31:26.661 --> 00:31:28.763]  To study criminal justice.
[00:31:29.243 --> 00:31:44.214]  So, are we seeing this whole blackmail circle, this blackmail culture, where before you get into a position of power, you allow blackmail to be obtained on yourself so that you can be controlled?
[00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:47.977]  Because, say this girl, if she never got busted in prostituting herself,
[00:31:48.417 --> 00:31:57.545]  Say she then became a judge or a criminal prosecutor, do you think she's actually going to be going after those human traffickers out there?
[00:31:57.845 --> 00:32:03.250]  Or do you think that those human traffickers are going to be able to hold that blackmail over her head?
[00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:13.259]  So this is just a prime example of some of the stuff we're seeing where people are compromised to where they can't do their job and they can't go ahead and go after these human sex traffickers.
[00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:17.800]  Just stay tuned because we are going to be investigating human trafficking out here.
[00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:24.283]  We are going to be talking to law enforcement agencies that were involved in a massive human trafficking statewide bust.
[00:32:24.683 --> 00:32:33.966]  We're going to be talking to non-profit organizations that first-hand help rescue children that are being sexually trafficked in the city of LA.
[00:32:35.466 --> 00:32:47.358]  And we're even going to be talking to someone who's going to remain anonymous, but that is going to show us the dark web where children are sold routinely on a daily basis to the highest bidder.
[00:32:47.558 --> 00:32:50.841]  We are going to be showing you what the mainstream media will not.
[00:32:51.041 --> 00:32:53.704]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.966]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:05.006]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:06.587]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.887 --> 00:33:07.688]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:08.608]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:11.209]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.130]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.752]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.992 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.030]  Please.
[00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:34.312]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:40.105]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:41.345]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:42.866]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:50.289]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.992]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.032 --> 00:36:59.973]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:14.481]  You turn on the news, it's like the evil, the horribleness.
[00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:17.603]  Our country just isn't open to anybody that wants to come here.
[00:37:18.404 --> 00:37:27.854]  I mean, you've got all these Mexican bishops saying, it is a act of treason against Mexico to build a wall.
[00:37:28.214 --> 00:37:35.361]  If you're Mexican in America, Mexicans who helped build Trump wall, traitors, top archdiocese says.
[00:37:35.702 --> 00:37:41.948]  The point is, is that the globalists have taught Western nations to not be tribal, to not be nationalist, to not be race based.
[00:37:41.988 --> 00:37:44.050]  I don't understand why it needs to be a racial conversation.
[00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:51.379]  I don't understand why, if you disagree with someone on immigration policy, that person needs to be racist, needs to be committing ethnic cleansing.
[00:37:51.739 --> 00:37:54.202]  And the head of the New York City Council made that claim today.
[00:37:54.622 --> 00:37:56.605]  You don't speak for her, but I want to know what you think of that.
[00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:59.146]  Well, I really respect the head of the New York City.
[00:37:59.547 --> 00:38:00.367]  She's amazing.
[00:38:00.427 --> 00:38:01.428]  She's an incredible leader.
[00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:06.191]  She's the first Hispanic to ever hold that position and I look forward to seeing what she does next in her career.
[00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:12.134]  You and I can both agree that the problem is around comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:38:12.194 --> 00:38:14.716]  Do me the favor of addressing what she actually said.
[00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:16.357]  You'll need to ask her directly.
[00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:21.342]  Why does it always take a turn into racial demagoguery?
[00:38:21.362 --> 00:38:26.329]  You're accusing Trump of being a racial demagogue and then when people say things like ethnic cleansing, murdering people because of their race?
[00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:27.090]  Come on now.
[00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.551]  That's a horrible thing to say.
[00:38:28.571 --> 00:38:29.913]  I'm not going to speak for the speaker.
[00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:31.775]  We have some of the most open laws in the country.
[00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:33.717]  And we're being exploited!
[00:38:34.157 --> 00:38:38.441]  And then people are frothing in race-based garbage that they've been programmed by.
[00:38:38.461 --> 00:38:44.847]  We have the WikiLeaks with the Democratic Party heads saying, let's use racial politics, let's accelerate culture war.
[00:38:45.688 --> 00:38:49.152]  They're the racists, not even the idiots that are involved in the racism on the ground.
[00:38:49.172 --> 00:38:54.837]  Whether it's some La Raza person or some idiot KKK person, it's all the same propaganda, just from a different perspective.
[00:38:55.117 --> 00:38:56.277]  These people don't want to talk to you.
[00:38:56.518 --> 00:38:57.238]  That's the problem.
[00:38:57.578 --> 00:39:00.899]  They sit there and say they don't have double standards and that they're not hypocritical.
[00:39:01.219 --> 00:39:05.160]  They'll come up to you and just yell and scream like you're just, you're nobody.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.901]  We hate you.
[00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:06.601]  You're racist.
[00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:08.061]  You're misogynist, homophobic.
[00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:09.682]  I have black friends.
[00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:10.562]  I have white friends.
[00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:11.762]  I have Mexican friends.
[00:39:12.023 --> 00:39:13.743]  And supposedly I'm a racist.
[00:39:14.223 --> 00:39:14.523]  Wow.
[00:39:14.603 --> 00:39:15.244]  That's crazy.
[00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:16.484]  My family is black.
[00:39:16.504 --> 00:39:17.184]  We're all mixed.
[00:39:17.504 --> 00:39:17.784]  Okay.
[00:39:18.025 --> 00:39:19.585]  So it has nothing to do with race.
[00:39:19.725 --> 00:39:21.906]  I think Trump is really just trying to get
[00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:28.048]  The sovereignty back in America when he's talking about the borders like he's not saying let's import all Muslims.
[00:39:28.068 --> 00:39:29.129]  Let's import all Mexicans.
[00:39:29.149 --> 00:39:30.910]  He's talking about the drug pushers.
[00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.750]  He's talking about the criminals.
[00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.991]  He's talking about them.
[00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:46.236]  He's not talking about good people that are going to work every day and paying their bills and there's just too many of these misconceptions generated by the hype of the mainstream media and people just kind of buy into it because of the herd mentality.
[00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:49.818]  For him, building this wall isn't about what you might think.
[00:39:50.218 --> 00:39:52.079]  You're Hispanic.
[00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:53.640]  80% of your workers are Hispanic.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.122]  Was it difficult to approach this project?
[00:39:56.922 --> 00:39:57.262]  It was.
[00:39:57.302 --> 00:39:58.643]  We had to do a lot of soul-searching.
[00:39:58.663 --> 00:40:00.064]  This is a hot-button issue.
[00:40:00.104 --> 00:40:02.505]  People are very adamant on one side or the other.
[00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:04.006]  There's a really hard-leaning one in the middle.
[00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:12.471]  The whole reason that we decided to do this project is because of the concerns that we had where other companies were proposing more lethal designs.
[00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:17.635]  So you're talking about like the electrified fences, the use of electricity?
[00:40:17.695 --> 00:40:18.516]  Yeah, things like that.
[00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:19.777]  Very concerning for us.
[00:40:19.877 --> 00:40:30.366]  Our hope is that by securing our borders, enforcing the laws on the books, we will finally have the appetite to pass new laws, comprehensive immigration reform, to bring these people out of the shadows.
[00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:31.848]  So step one, build the wall.
[00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:33.969]  Step two, start talking about immigration.
[00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.392]  Step one has to be securing our borders.
[00:40:37.025 --> 00:40:51.059]  But the point is, is that you can't have the big foundations and the universities brainwashing everybody that comes in to have the chip on their shoulder and to hate America and to hate white people until that brainwashing stops.
[00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:58.047]  You have to stop the massive flood, legal or illegal, because of the brainwashing.
[00:40:58.087 --> 00:40:59.088]  This is very simple.
[00:41:07.245 --> 00:41:09.207]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:41:09.227 --> 00:41:12.869]  Now, 90% of the media is consumed with fake news.
[00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.332]  This entire Trump-Russia connection is completely and totally ridiculous.
[00:41:16.372 --> 00:41:22.257]  They're lacking in doing their job, and they're not telling the American people what good things the Trump administration's actually doing.
[00:41:22.717 --> 00:41:25.920]  Like maybe the 1500 pedophiles that have been arrested under him so far.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.222]  Or the fact that illegal immigration is down 67%.
[00:41:29.323 --> 00:41:30.905]  Now that's the main topic of today.
[00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:30.905]  67%.
[00:41:32.086 --> 00:41:33.647]  That's a large number.
[00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:35.869]  Now why has that number gone up so much?
[00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:37.831]  Why have we stopped that many people?
[00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:39.973]  Because under Trump people know, hey,
[00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:41.354]  We're not playing games.
[00:41:41.554 --> 00:41:42.434]  No more freebies.
[00:41:42.774 --> 00:41:44.075]  No more sanctuary cities.
[00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:49.578]  And if you do want to be part of a sanctuary city and you're a local official here, we're going to cut that money to you.
[00:41:49.918 --> 00:41:53.921]  So eventually people in these other countries are going, nah, I'll stay here.
[00:41:54.361 --> 00:41:55.502]  I'll fight for my own country.
[00:41:55.562 --> 00:41:57.142]  I'll try to make Honduras great again.
[00:41:57.423 --> 00:42:00.905]  I'll try to make Mexico great again, instead of coming up here and leeching off of us.
[00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:08.269]  Now, one of the things that's a huge portion of this as well is the fact that the Trump administration has essentially freed the federal agents.
[00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:24.043]  To be able to do their job, to take off these invisible handcuffs that the Obama administration has had on them for so long and allow them to actually go and stop people crossing the border illegally, detaining them, deporting them, creating dossiers and finding out if these are repeat offenders or, you know,
[00:42:24.764 --> 00:42:26.206]  Thanks for watching!
[00:42:40.268 --> 00:42:41.148]  How's it going to get built?
[00:42:41.188 --> 00:42:49.250]  Well, today there's going to be bids submitted into the Trump administration to find out which companies are going to be picked to actually go and build the wall.
[00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:53.071]  But whatever companies pick today aren't going to actually build the entire wall.
[00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.232]  They're actually going to have sections that they're going to go build on.
[00:42:55.632 --> 00:42:58.273]  And then from there, they're going to find out who has the best idea.
[00:42:58.573 --> 00:43:02.554]  And then from there, I believe, based off this article, is go and build that wall.
[00:43:03.014 --> 00:43:07.235]  Now, one of the concerns is, is these contractors are worried that they're going to be
[00:43:07.956 --> 00:43:10.454]  It's going to be a hostile environment that possibly...
[00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:27.829]  Angry Mexicans are going to attack, or crazy leftists like Antifa and other organizations, Black Lives Matter, are going to go and attack these contractors, much like we saw at the North Dakota pipeline protest that was going on, where people were being attacked for being out there, just contractors doing their jobs, things like that.
[00:43:28.269 --> 00:43:35.433]  One potential bidder on the President Trump border wall with Mexico wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack.
[00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.594]  That's a good concern, and a good question.
[00:43:37.954 --> 00:43:39.695]  Another asked if they would be allowed
[00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:47.440]  to carry guns in states like California that have extremely strict gun laws and if they would indemnify them for using deadly force.
[00:43:47.981 --> 00:43:56.486]  Now with bids due today on their first design contracts, interesting companies are preparing for the worst if they potentially get picked for this lucrative job.
[00:43:56.887 --> 00:43:57.127]  A U.S.
[00:43:57.167 --> 00:44:06.994]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of details that haven't been made public yet said four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.
[00:44:07.674 --> 00:44:16.338]  And these prototypes will be built around San Diego, within 120 feet of the border, on a quarter mile, 400 meter strip of federally owned land.
[00:44:16.759 --> 00:44:26.363]  And then from there, the government will estimate spending around $200,000 to $500,000 on each prototype to find out which idea is going to work out the best.
[00:44:26.923 --> 00:44:28.924]  And then you have people like El Paso.
[00:44:29.305 --> 00:44:33.607]  The city council wants to vote on a resolution that touches on the border wall.
[00:44:34.287 --> 00:44:42.931]  And by touch on it, they want to say that it's bad because it's going to affect taxpayer money, hurt the environment and contribute to climate change.
[00:44:43.511 --> 00:44:46.652]  This is the same narrative we see time and time again.
[00:44:47.012 --> 00:44:50.374]  These leftists always want to blame everything on climate change.
[00:44:50.534 --> 00:44:51.814]  Everything affects climate change.
[00:44:52.094 --> 00:44:53.575]  Climate change affects ISIS.
[00:44:53.995 --> 00:44:56.536]  A wall being built affects climate change.
[00:44:56.936 --> 00:44:59.237]  This is the complete and totally ridiculous world we live in.
[00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:02.139]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:02.439 --> 00:45:03.019]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:45:10.265 --> 00:45:11.165]  Can you give us a question?
[00:45:11.185 --> 00:45:11.526]  Don't be rude.
[00:45:11.546 --> 00:45:12.126]  You're attacking us.
[00:45:12.386 --> 00:45:13.366]  Can you give us a question?
[00:45:13.386 --> 00:45:14.407]  Don't be rude.
[00:45:14.427 --> 00:45:15.787]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:45:15.807 --> 00:45:17.008]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:45:17.028 --> 00:45:17.768]  Can you stay categorical?
[00:45:17.788 --> 00:45:18.748]  You are fake news.
[00:45:18.868 --> 00:45:19.129]  Sir.
[00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:21.790]  Round two.
[00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.590]  Fight.
[00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:23.290]  Go ahead.
[00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.871]  Should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:45:24.911 --> 00:45:26.011]  What do you think, Peter?
[00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:28.272]  Peter, should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:45:28.432 --> 00:45:28.852]  Sit down.
[00:45:28.872 --> 00:45:29.553]  Sit down.
[00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:30.813]  We'll get it.
[00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:35.175]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir.
[00:45:35.235 --> 00:45:37.256]  I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:45:37.296 --> 00:45:39.017]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[00:45:39.057 --> 00:45:39.837]  I know, but aren't you...
[00:45:42.353 --> 00:45:43.474]  Flawless victory.
[00:45:44.835 --> 00:45:48.138]  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[00:45:48.418 --> 00:45:48.998]  It's fake.
[00:45:49.258 --> 00:45:53.081]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:53.842]  And they are.
[00:45:54.182 --> 00:45:55.643]  They are the enemy of the people.
[00:45:56.664 --> 00:45:58.465]  Because they have no sources.
[00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:02.348]  They just make them up when there are none.
[00:46:02.649 --> 00:46:09.454]  The dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:10.395]  The fake news.
[00:46:11.212 --> 00:46:14.454]  They dropped off the word fake.
[00:46:14.775 --> 00:46:20.679]  And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy.
[00:46:20.719 --> 00:46:22.740]  They take the word fake out.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.641]  So I'm not against the media.
[00:46:25.002 --> 00:46:26.403]  I'm not against the press.
[00:46:27.143 --> 00:46:29.385]  I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them.
[00:46:29.985 --> 00:46:35.309]  But I am only against the fake news media or press.
[00:46:35.449 --> 00:46:35.729]  Fake.
[00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.350]  Fake.
[00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.531]  You have to leave that word.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.434 --> 00:48:49.475]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:50.496]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.556 --> 00:48:51.157]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.517 --> 00:48:59.066]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.086 --> 00:48:59.967]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.987 --> 00:49:00.027]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.837 --> 00:49:10.340]  Well, the biggest scandal since Watergate is brewing right now.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:16.444]  Now, Obama's former National Security Advisor Susan Rice is squirming, physically squirming in her chair.
[00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:17.505]  She is under fire.
[00:49:17.525 --> 00:49:21.708]  This is a lady who has no problem lying, okay?
[00:49:21.728 --> 00:49:24.490]  You'll recall she took the fall for the Benghazi scandal.
[00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:34.017]  The Obama administration sent her out to all the Sunday talk shows where she just basically said that the Benghazi scandal was the result of a YouTube video.
[00:49:34.117 --> 00:49:34.637]  Big lie.
[00:49:34.717 --> 00:49:35.878]  She has no problem lying.
[00:49:36.238 --> 00:49:40.581]  She said, I didn't even get the information from the intelligence community.
[00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:42.402]  They just gave me the talking points and I went out.
[00:49:42.442 --> 00:49:44.564]  So this is basically what she's done again.
[00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:47.246]  She has the audacity to say she knows nothing.
[00:49:47.466 --> 00:49:48.327]  I know nothing.
[00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:57.033]  Well, now she's actually physically squirming in her seat when she's being asked if she's willing to testify under oath that she knows nothing.
[00:49:57.073 --> 00:50:00.855]  And so we'll just roll the video of her talking to Andrea Mitchell.
[00:50:00.895 --> 00:50:04.378]  But you know, these people are all part of the establishment there.
[00:50:04.898 --> 00:50:05.218]  I think so.
[00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.730]  I think?
[00:50:40.563 --> 00:50:41.003]  We're good to go.
[00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:11.817]  Not the big news that caused Susan Rice to unmask the names of these Americans.
[00:51:12.217 --> 00:51:26.981]  Now in response to a question from NBC News, the reporter Andrea Mitchell, Susan Rice denied that she prepared any of these spreadsheets of these surveilled telephone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides.
[00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:31.622]  The Daily Caller actually reported on this that she had ordered
[00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.083]  We're good to go.
[00:51:56.684 --> 00:52:00.066]  So here again, she's saying, oh, I deny that, Andrea Mitchell.
[00:52:00.086 --> 00:52:04.868]  And of course, Andrea Mitchell, wife of Alan Greenspan, is, you know, well in bed.
[00:52:04.948 --> 00:52:06.869]  She's going to take whatever story comes her way.
[00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:13.352]  And so DiGenova told the Daily Caller that what was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms.
[00:52:13.412 --> 00:52:21.897]  Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals.
[00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:30.700]  So again, this involved no illegal activity, these phone conversations, but, you know, the Russians, they hacked into our election.
[00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:33.041]  But this is very interesting.
[00:52:33.301 --> 00:52:42.325]  So the red states actually saying, you know, look, dear CNN, why do you have a former Obama appointee reporting on the Susan Rice revelation?
[00:52:42.986 --> 00:52:46.707]  Because again, we're seeing the establishment media sort of rally around this.
[00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:48.408]  They're trying to kill the story.
[00:52:49.088 --> 00:52:59.150]  And so this is their reporter, Jim Sciutto, and he tweets out, Justin, the idea that Ambassador Rice improperly sought the identities of Americans is false.
[00:52:59.831 --> 00:53:01.311]  Person close to Rice tells me.
[00:53:02.011 --> 00:53:03.871]  Oh, well, gee, let's do a little digging.
[00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:05.052]  I wonder who that is.
[00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:08.212]  The person close to Rice is likely somebody he knows.
[00:53:08.593 --> 00:53:14.294]  Before Sciutto worked at the White House, he worked at ABC alongside Ian Officer Cameron.
[00:53:15.356 --> 00:53:16.877]  Who's married to Susan Rice?
[00:53:17.057 --> 00:53:22.599]  So, hmm, I wonder who his anonymous close source is there.
[00:53:22.639 --> 00:53:24.980]  I mean, obviously we don't have confirmation on that, but come on.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.741]  So I'm sure he's totally non-biased there, Jim Sciutto.
[00:53:28.221 --> 00:53:31.262]  And then obviously, too, we've got CNN going on a rampage.
[00:53:31.342 --> 00:53:39.826]  Don Lemon is basically announcing that he would ignore the news at all costs, saying that he is not even going to give it any
[00:53:40.606 --> 00:53:41.926]  And he thought it's unimportant.
[00:53:41.946 --> 00:53:43.207]  He's going to totally write it off.
[00:53:43.667 --> 00:53:44.827]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:53:44.847 --> 00:53:48.988]  We've got John McCain as well defending her as if he has any credibility left.
[00:53:49.548 --> 00:53:55.049]  So we had Mike Cernovich on the show today, who was actually being called a fake news investigative journalist.
[00:53:55.089 --> 00:53:57.830]  He forced this story out into the spotlight.
[00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:09.172]  And he has some details about why these establishment media and the deep state, why all they might be rallying around their people and why they might be afraid.
[00:54:10.012 --> 00:54:11.233]  And have sat on this story.
[00:54:12.713 --> 00:54:20.817]  So I've actually, I've been waiting to break this story out, but I couldn't break the story until I had a big scoop like Susan Rice.
[00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:31.202]  But the whole reason I broke the Susan Rice story is because I wanted to break the story and I wanted to break the story on your show because we have the whole enchilada, the pedophile networks of the deep state.
[00:54:31.542 --> 00:54:33.623]  So I'm going to break it down for you real quick.
[00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:41.611]  The reason Trump can't get his people hired is because the security clearances are being jammed up and not going through.
[00:54:41.631 --> 00:54:48.898]  The reason they're not going through is that the people who administer the polygraph in Deep State are actually part of the pedophile ring.
[00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:54.696]  And they only want pedophiles in Deep State because they're compromised and they can be blackmailed.
[00:54:55.077 --> 00:54:59.321]  So everything that we thought that Trump was making a mistake, he actually wasn't.
[00:54:59.682 --> 00:55:03.906]  The people who administer the polygraphs in Deep State are all part of the pedophile network.
[00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:06.609]  They only want to hire people.
[00:55:07.378 --> 00:55:10.161]  Oh, I've had CIA people say they can't come on anymore.
[00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:11.562]  Their whole lives have been ruined.
[00:55:11.582 --> 00:55:13.724]  I mean, they're coming after everybody.
[00:55:13.764 --> 00:55:16.246]  This pedophile thing is what they're afraid of.
[00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:31.736]  Yeah, so this is the real thing.
[00:55:32.157 --> 00:55:35.357]  We now know that that is how Deep State is sabotaging Trump.
[00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:45.020]  Now, I talked to the person who had investigated, and I worked at my Detailed Source Network, and he had told me that where this happens initially is in swingers clubs.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:54.103]  And these swinger clubs are outside of Washington, D.C., and what happens is they find people who are into wife swapping and other kinds of activities.
[00:55:56.616 --> 00:56:04.040]  Well, that's why we're breaking these deep state stories.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.141]  That's why people are coming to you and coming to me.
[00:56:06.481 --> 00:56:07.922]  Because they want them out.
[00:56:08.022 --> 00:56:11.764]  And they realize that the Susan Rice story, Bloomberg sat on it.
[00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:13.565]  The Washington Post sat on it.
[00:56:13.905 --> 00:56:15.186]  Nobody wanted to run it.
[00:56:16.046 --> 00:56:17.328]  Anybody who isn't a pedophile.
[00:56:31.564 --> 00:56:31.784]  Yeah.
[00:56:32.024 --> 00:56:34.025]  We're all being spied on.
[00:56:34.065 --> 00:56:35.805]  That's why everybody has to be very careful.
[00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:38.925]  They call us empowered individuals they don't control.
[00:56:38.946 --> 00:56:40.586]  Red-blooded Americans are all being spied on.
[00:56:40.746 --> 00:56:44.227]  That's, again, how they compromise people and the media.
[00:56:44.647 --> 00:56:49.808]  Because Operation Mockingbird proved that the CIA controls a lot of media.
[00:56:49.848 --> 00:56:55.729]  A lot of media people, again, they aren't, it's kind of sad, Alex, but they aren't actually pedophiles themselves.
[00:56:56.389 --> 00:56:56.970]  We're good to go.
[00:57:16.522 --> 00:57:19.204]  First up to them, they're thinking this is a good thing.
[00:57:19.664 --> 00:57:25.328]  Next thing you know, they wake up and all they see is a picture of them next to a naked child.
[00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:27.450]  And they're going to write what they're told to write.
[00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:39.299]  So that's why most of the media is controlled by deep state is because most of the people who are in media, they're not actually into children, but they've been compromised and exposed by deep state and they've been set up.
[00:57:39.319 --> 00:57:39.819]  That's right.
[00:57:39.859 --> 00:57:41.080]  Let's explain how this works.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.920]  Let's explain how this works.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.382]  None of this is from other sources and historically this has happened.
[00:57:44.422 --> 00:57:45.243]  It's been documented.
[00:57:47.884 --> 00:57:51.305]  Look what followers they are, not even wanting to be attacked by the media.
[00:57:51.605 --> 00:57:55.486]  Can you imagine when they learn they got tricked into having sex with a 16-year-old girl?
[00:57:56.046 --> 00:57:59.007]  Or they got drugs and they brought in, you know, naked toddlers or whatever?
[00:57:59.027 --> 00:58:03.388]  Or, you know, had a toddler chained up and they're in the room with it?
[00:58:03.848 --> 00:58:05.008]  Can you imagine?
[00:58:05.368 --> 00:58:08.009]  They say, I'll do anything you ever want.
[00:58:08.429 --> 00:58:10.609]  And that's all about domination and control.
[00:58:10.929 --> 00:58:13.610]  And as Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in one of his books, I think it was the Technotronic Era,
[00:58:14.676 --> 00:58:15.417]  I've read a bunch of them.
[00:58:16.097 --> 00:58:17.899]  He admitted we control organized crime.
[00:58:18.159 --> 00:58:18.980]  That is the deep state.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.761]  We control the pedophiles.
[00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:21.722]  He said we control it all.
[00:58:22.083 --> 00:58:24.385]  Because, oh, then we can control it and keep it small.
[00:58:25.025 --> 00:58:25.586]  What a lie.
[00:58:25.666 --> 00:58:29.189]  They're the ones that have proliferated it because it's their control system.
[00:58:29.529 --> 00:58:36.936]  And so that's why they're normalizing pedophilia in the news, normalizing it in the media, because they want to get more people into it so they have more compromised people.
[00:58:38.217 --> 00:58:43.403]  Right, and all they did when they went after you and went after me, and they don't understand how people like you and I think.
[00:58:43.883 --> 00:58:46.846]  They don't understand that I know that we are at war and I will die.
[00:58:46.866 --> 00:58:48.488]  I will die for the truth.
[00:58:48.508 --> 00:58:51.471]  So I don't care if some stupid articles they write about me.
[00:58:51.531 --> 00:58:54.334]  Right now the whole media, they think they're having- All they do is make us bigger.
[00:58:54.374 --> 00:58:54.975]  They don't get it.
