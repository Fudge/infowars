[00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.467]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:23.428]  It's Thursday, January 5th, 2017.
[00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.049]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:39.576]  Tonight, shocking video emerges of a group of angry black thugs who kidnapped and torture a mentally disabled man live on Facebook.
[00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:47.600]  But according to Simone Sanders at CNN, it was Donald Trump who should be blamed for the hate crime.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.343]  We cannot callously go about classifying things as a hate crime.
[00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:59.787]  Was this for hate of Donald Trump, the president elected because of the things that he had said, or was this for pure hate of white people?
[00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:09.273]  Meanwhile, the politically corrupt Chicago Police Department downplays the incident and says it was just a bunch of kids making stupid decisions.
[00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:11.548]  Then, U.S.
[00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:16.931]  intelligence officials testify about the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC.
[00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:21.514]  All that plus much more, up next on the Infowars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:05.789]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:18.093]  I'm your host, Owen Troyer, and this morning there was a hearing on Capitol Hill regarding the Russian influence, interference, hacking, whatever you want to call it, in the presidential election.
[00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:25.436]  Now, they did not offer any new evidence to prove their point in this hearing, something we expected them to do.
[00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:27.257]  They did say that next week
[00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:28.217]  We're good to go.
[00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:51.607]  We're going to play some highlights for you here to open the nightly news, but let me just say this.
[00:03:52.167 --> 00:04:02.479]  John McCain, Clapper and Graham and others, they were laughing during this hearing, mucking it up and laughing, having a good time during this hearing.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.982]  You better not be starting World War 3 then, okay?
[00:04:06.182 --> 00:04:08.964]  Because that is no laughing matter.
[00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.126]  That is sick and twisted.
[00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.827]  You're up here making jokes about propaganda to start World War 3.
[00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:15.509]  But of course, we'll see.
[00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.691]  You claim you're going to prove it with more releases next week.
[00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:25.936]  You know, and also, I'm not going to include Tim Kaine in my highlights because Tim Kaine is such a crud, piece, scum of crap.
[00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.397]  I can't believe how low that guy is.
[00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:29.078]  So I'm just going to go ahead and leave him out.
[00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:34.850]  Let's go ahead and roll to the first clip of John McCain speaking about Russian influence in this election.
[00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.511]  So how is this an attack on our democracy?
[00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:54.732]  Our democracy is the vote that took place in order to get Donald Trump elected.
[00:04:54.932 --> 00:05:04.615]  You want to talk about an attack on our democracy, you talk about rigged elections with voting machines, black box voting, illegal voters, non-citizen voters, dead voters.
[00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:06.495]  That's an attack on our democracy.
[00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.937]  No voter ID laws, so anybody can just run into a poll and vote.
[00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:11.538]  That's an attack on our democracy.
[00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:18.083]  Exposing truth that then influences opinion is not an attack on the democracy.
[00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:33.773]  It's amazing how they play these word games and use these terms to prey on ignorant Americans to really make them feel that they're under an attack that they're not actually under, or to divert the attention of who's actually attacking our democracy to the Russians.
[00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:34.774]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:38.630]  Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation.
[00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:47.426]  There is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.
[00:05:48.601 --> 00:06:01.353]  So again, this is John McCain trying to, you know, foment more hatred of Russia, make the American people feel like they need to be afraid of Russia so that they can build up this war with Russia, but he talks about foreign interference of our elections.
[00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:12.104]  Again, they have not denied the validity of the content of the emails which exposes the DNC is the ones that are actually tampering and trying to rig elections.
[00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:12.764]  So again,
[00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:24.611]  They're up here talking about undermining the democracy, rigging elections, when it was the DNC that got caught red-handed doing it, not just with WikiLeaks, but also with Project Veritas.
[00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:25.672]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:32.636]  And of course, helping Bashar Assad slaughter civilians in Syria for more than a year with impunity.
[00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:41.261]  The same is true for China, Iran, North Korea, and any other adversary that has recently felt emboldened to challenge the world order.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.142]  So here he is trying to play confidence man up here.
[00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:47.583]  Don't challenge the new world order!
[00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:48.904]  Don't challenge the world order!
[00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:50.225]  We're in charge!
[00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:52.767]  How dare you undermine the world order!
[00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:58.530]  But he also, he takes a moment to attack Assad here too because we gotta go to war with Syria as well.
[00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.232]  Let's recall here John McCain.
[00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:12.177]  It was ISIS funded by Barack Obama claiming them to be moderate rebels that were slaughtering and beheading people in Syria, okay?
[00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:16.819]  You are blatantly lying about that and why are you covering for Barack Obama?
[00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:33.625]  Why are you using what happened in Syria to try to push this Russian narrative more when you know damn well what happened in Russia and it was Barack Obama's funded terrorist groups that were the ones committing those atrocities in Syria.
[00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:34.666]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:49.462]  In addition to stealing information from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and cherry-picking what information it leaked to the media, the Russian government also created and spread fake news and conspiracies across the vast social media landscape.
[00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:55.966]  At the very least, the effect of Russia's actions was to erode the faith of the American people in our democratic institutions.
[00:07:57.358 --> 00:08:09.829]  So Russia is trying to erode the faith in the American people's confidence in the election by exposing what the DNC did to try to erode the integrity of the election.
[00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:11.631]  This is truly unbelievable stuff.
[00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.634]  And he's going on saying that Russia is making fake news now.
[00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:18.277]  Provides zero examples, folks.
[00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:20.680]  Provides zero examples.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.526]  Again, all of these claims that they're making have zero examples.
[00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:26.309]  Not one example was given.
[00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.634]  Just a bunch of lip service to the false narrative.
[00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:30.676]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:08:31.852 --> 00:08:39.654]  Furthermore, what Russia did to the United States in 2016, it already does, has done rather, and continues to do in Europe.
[00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:47.276]  These activities are ongoing now in Europe as Europe prepares for elections.
[00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:48.917]  Is that a fair assumption?
[00:08:49.297 --> 00:08:49.537]  It is.
[00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:54.839]  Look at how they're trying to string all of this together to build World War 3.
[00:08:55.359 --> 00:09:00.461]  Attack Russia, be afraid of Russia, Russia's hacking, Russia's meddling, Russia's making fake news.
[00:09:01.282 --> 00:09:03.923]  Assad, Syria, slaughtering civilians.
[00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:06.944]  Russia in Europe trying to undermine their elections now.
[00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:10.946]  They're weaving this web to try to build World War 3.
[00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:13.087]  We are not buying it anymore.
[00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.728]  I can't, you know, I'm sitting here and I'm watching this hearing
[00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:17.568]  And I'm so sickened.
[00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:19.889]  And then I see Josh Earnest make a statement.
[00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.771]  And I'm just, I'm so, I'm done with these people, okay?
[00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.732]  I'm so done to get these people out of my government.
[00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:27.092]  I want real people.
[00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:28.553]  I want real Americans.
[00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:32.495]  I want honest people that have integrity, that don't scheme behind people's backs.
[00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:33.795]  They don't have agendas.
[00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:37.397]  So that's why they can't tell the American people about how they got their information.
[00:09:37.737 --> 00:09:38.377]  Give me a break.
[00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:39.257]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:43.239]  The name Mr. Assange has popped up.
[00:09:44.111 --> 00:09:53.974]  And I believe that he is the one who's responsible for publishing names of individuals that work for us that put their lives in direct danger.
[00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:54.814]  Is that correct?
[00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:57.155]  Yes, it has.
[00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:07.638]  And do you think that there's any credibility we should attach to this individual, given his record of... Not in my view.
[00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:09.339]  Not in your view.
[00:10:11.062 --> 00:10:11.726]  Emma Rogers?
[00:10:12.853 --> 00:10:14.021]  I second those comments.
[00:10:15.606 --> 00:10:19.989]  So they think that Julian Assange is here compromising the safety of some Americans.
[00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:26.633]  Let's recall, Hillary Clinton set up a private server with classified information on it, okay?
[00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:27.613]  That's a fact!
[00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:28.894]  She lied about that!
[00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:36.259]  How come nobody's talking about the Americans' lives that were put at risk because of the classified documents that Hillary Clinton had on an illegal server?
[00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:43.423]  But I love how John McCain is sitting here like, Mr. Assange apparently did this, Mr. Assange, like he has no idea
[00:10:43.683 --> 00:10:44.844]  Who Julian Assange is.
[00:10:45.184 --> 00:10:46.485]  Give me a break, John McCain.
[00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:53.490]  You know exactly who Julian Assange is and why he's your enemy, because he's taking down the New World Order that you're associated with.
[00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.431]  But then, they always do this.
[00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:57.152]  They just say, discredited.
[00:10:57.812 --> 00:10:58.993]  They have no proof.
[00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:05.858]  They gave you no evidence, no names, no instances where what they said Assange did, allegedly did, actually happened.
[00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.699]  So they just say, he's discredited.
[00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:08.279]  Do you agree?
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:08.720]  Yes.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.520]  He's discredited.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.061]  Do you agree?
[00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:10.501]  Yes.
[00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.842]  Okay, then he's discredited.
[00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:15.083]  No proof, no excuse, just that's what we said.
[00:11:15.423 --> 00:11:16.643]  Don't challenge our order.
[00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:17.584]  We're in charge.
[00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:18.464]  Roll to the next one.
[00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:26.767]  I do think that public trust and confidence in the intelligence community is crucial.
[00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:39.531]  And both in this country and I think the dependence that other countries, other nations have on the U.S.
[00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:40.411]  intelligence community.
[00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.695]  Let me explain to you what James Clapper is saying right there.
[00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:53.339]  We need to have a monopoly on intelligence, and we also need to have a monopoly on sharing that intelligence with you.
[00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:54.920]  Don't you see what they're trying to do?
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:03.304]  They're trying to literally control all information, all intelligence, and any information that goes against their narrative
[00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:05.945]  They're going to discredit as Russian hacking.
[00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:07.905]  They're going to discredit as fake news.
[00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:11.886]  They have to have a monopoly on intelligence.
[00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:17.447]  It doesn't matter that James Clapper has been wrong before.
[00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:23.609]  It doesn't matter that James Clapper Intel has sent us into wars that we didn't belong in.
[00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.550]  And we'll cover that later with Leanne McAdoo later on the nightly news.
[00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.190]  So none of that matters.
[00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.870]  Okay?
[00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:37.176]  They need to have a monopoly on intel so that they can control the narrative, they can control wars, and they can control you.
[00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:38.838]  We're not having it anymore.
[00:12:39.078 --> 00:12:39.398]  Okay?
[00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:40.259]  We're done with it.
[00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:41.920]  And we know you talked about the info war.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.841]  We're going to talk about that later in this segment.
[00:12:44.022 --> 00:12:45.022]  Let's roll to the next video.
[00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:50.066]  Well, it says radio, and a lot of people don't listen to radio like they used to.
[00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:50.486]  No, yeah.
[00:12:50.827 --> 00:12:51.047]  No.
[00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:51.567]  Okay.
[00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:56.231]  Well, actually, radio is a very popular mode in many parts of the world.
[00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:57.512]  Radio's big in your world?
[00:12:59.878 --> 00:13:07.939]  So here's Senator Graham... This is another one of those punks that just... Just, I cannot stand these people anymore.
[00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:11.840]  Telling us how radio is basically a dead industry.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.660]  Nobody listens to radio anymore.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.881]  He's laughing, joking.
[00:13:15.621 --> 00:13:16.361]  Oh, radio.
[00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:17.581]  Oh, you listen to radio?
[00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:18.561]  Who listens to radio?
[00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:20.422]  I got news for you, bud.
[00:13:20.442 --> 00:13:22.302]  I got news for you, Lindsey Graham.
[00:13:22.582 --> 00:13:23.102]  Guess what?
[00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:27.323]  Radio, talk radio, has more influence than you!
[00:13:28.563 --> 00:13:30.124]  Oh, how does that make you feel?
[00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:35.868]  See, whatever comes out of your mouth, people are already going to discount as propaganda, as lies.
[00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:41.732]  Because you've been proven nothing more than a total shill, nothing more than a liar, since you've been serving this country.
[00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:43.413]  So, that's the irony here.
[00:13:43.753 --> 00:13:57.823]  You think that you're going to laugh, and by you laughing arrogantly is somehow going to discredit radio, people aren't going to listen to the radio anymore, but you know that the radio, talk radio, this program, other programs, have more influence than you.
[00:13:58.563 --> 00:14:05.429]  And that's why you're up here with James Clapper saying, we need to have a monopoly on intelligence because radio's kicking your ass!
[00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:06.850]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.814]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it is time now not to throw pebbles but to throw rocks.
[00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.436]  I wish we were not here.
[00:14:15.236 --> 00:14:17.198]  If it were up to me, we'd all live in peace.
[00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:17.678]  Oh really?
[00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:20.380]  But Putin's up to no good and he better be stopped.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.705]  And Mr. President-elect, when you listen to these people, you can be skeptical.
[00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.412]  But understand, they're the best among us, and they're trying to protect us.
[00:14:31.853 --> 00:14:34.395]  So, Lindsey Graham wants war with Russia.
[00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:38.137]  It's no longer time to throw pebbles, which is what he says is going on now.
[00:14:38.257 --> 00:14:39.919]  It's time to throw rocks.
[00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:43.761]  Oh, you know, if it was up to me, I'd want to stay in peace.
[00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:49.004]  If it was up to me, I wouldn't want this to go on, even though I'm up here fomenting war based on a false narrative.
[00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:50.585]  If it was up to me, I wouldn't want any of this.
[00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:51.946]  But it's time to go to war.
[00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:53.627]  If it was up to me, I wouldn't have war.
[00:14:53.848 --> 00:14:55.589]  But if it was up to me, I'd say go to war.
[00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:57.930]  I mean, how does this guy get away with this?
[00:14:57.991 --> 00:14:59.812]  How do these people continue to get elected?
[00:14:59.892 --> 00:15:01.153]  Rahm Emanuel in Chicago?
[00:15:01.513 --> 00:15:05.657]  How do these people continue to get elected, folks, is beyond me.
[00:15:05.777 --> 00:15:07.058]  I pray to God.
[00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:13.704]  I pray to God the American people can wake up and stop electing these pathetic scumbags into office like Lindsey Graham.
[00:15:13.964 --> 00:15:14.824]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:17.707]  This is them complaining that the info war is kicking their ass.
[00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:37.531]  I agree, General, and I think one of the areas where we're lacking and lagging more than any other area is social media.
[00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:41.655]  We know these young people in the Baltics are the same as young people here.
[00:15:42.435 --> 00:15:47.379]  They get their information off the internet, and we have really lagged behind there.
[00:15:48.524 --> 00:15:49.585]  We're kicking your ass.
[00:15:50.365 --> 00:15:53.748]  Your politics, your policies, and your lies are just like you.
[00:15:54.428 --> 00:15:56.670]  Old, dying, and on their way out.
[00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.871]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:15:59.617 --> 00:16:19.409]  I think it's clear that we have tremendous concerns about the Russian hacking in our elections, and I think it's more than ironic that we have a president-elect who kept talking about our elections being rigged, which I would consider trying to interfere with our elections to be a part of a rigged kind of an election at the same time.
[00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:29.718]  So again, she thinks it's ironic that Trump mentions rigged elections, points to the actual proof of rigged elections, but then she says Russia's rigging elections with no proof, and she thinks that's ironic.
[00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:31.359]  No, you're the definition of irony.
[00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:36.323]  Now listen to this double-think, double-speak out of James Clapper.
[00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:37.344]  This is unbelievable.
[00:16:39.726 --> 00:16:46.012]  Well, the Russians have a long history of interfering in elections, theirs and other people's.
[00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:46.813]  Just like we do.
[00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:53.793]  You know, people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw publicly too many rocks.
[00:16:54.894 --> 00:17:04.705]  Russia has clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture by increasing cyber espionage operations, leaking data stolen from these operations.
[00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:05.626]  Cyber espionage!
[00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:06.767]  Listen to this, very key.
[00:17:08.342 --> 00:17:08.442]  Oh!
[00:17:30.889 --> 00:17:33.510]  So it wasn't espionage or it wasn't an attack?
[00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:56.702]  It upped the cost against China after an enormous cyber attack against our nation.
[00:17:56.722 --> 00:18:04.625]  We did not retaliate against an act of espionage any more than other countries necessarily have retaliated against us.
[00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:05.905]  But that's what you said Russia did.
[00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:07.226]  It was an act of espionage.
[00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:10.068]  Because this was an act of espionage.
[00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.730]  Oh, was it or not?
[00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.693]  We and other nations conduct similar acts of espionage.
[00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:16.113]  Right.
[00:18:16.213 --> 00:18:23.760]  So if we're going to punish each other for acts of espionage, that's a different policy issue.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.121]  That's what you said Russia did.
[00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:30.866]  People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw publicly too many rocks.
[00:18:32.373 --> 00:18:37.436]  Is there a difference between espionage and interfering in an election?
[00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:46.702]  Yes, espionage implies, to me at least, a passive collection, and this was much more activist.
[00:18:47.023 --> 00:18:51.445]  So, when it comes to espionage, we better be careful about throwing rocks.
[00:18:52.026 --> 00:18:55.688]  When it comes to interfering in our election, we better be ready to throw rocks.
[00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:56.529]  Do you agree with that?
[00:18:57.329 --> 00:18:58.170]  That's a good metaphor.
[00:19:01.584 --> 00:19:06.287]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States.
[00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:15.653]  And that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:16.854]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:18.675]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:22.337]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.846]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.206 --> 00:22:44.918]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:49.060]  There will be mistakes, but what we do try to do, as we did after the
[00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:26.514]  During a Senate hearing today, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, once again confirmed that the U.S.
[00:23:26.674 --> 00:23:37.738]  officially believes that the Russian government was involved in not only propagating fake news, but also fake news websites during the 2016 presidential election.
[00:23:38.138 --> 00:23:41.221]  So of course, this is the exact same assessment that they made in October.
[00:23:41.582 --> 00:23:43.183]  They didn't present any new evidence.
[00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:44.625]  They said that we're going to have to wait.
[00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:49.510]  Our curiosity, we're just going to have to quell that until early sometime next week.
[00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.454]  The president is being shown their alleged evidence today.
[00:23:53.594 --> 00:23:56.337]  Donald Trump is going to be receiving that briefing tomorrow.
[00:23:57.197 --> 00:24:05.299]  My question is, why in the hell is Lion James Clapper being upheld as some unimpeachable bastion of truth-telling?
[00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:13.222]  This is the same man that famously lied under oath when he was asked about the NSA spying on innocent Americans.
[00:24:13.482 --> 00:24:21.104]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:24:22.484 --> 00:24:22.924]  No, sir.
[00:24:24.405 --> 00:24:24.885]  It does not.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.681]  Not wittingly.
[00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:36.428]  James Clapper also had his fingerprints all over the weapons of mass destruction report that led to a war in Iraq under false pretenses.
[00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:54.422]  In light of your saying that you are even more resolute now in your conclusion about Russian involvement in this hacking, that comparing it to the judgment made about weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq situation is totally a red herring, totally wrong.
[00:24:58.303 --> 00:25:01.126]  I, yes, I agree with that.
[00:25:01.286 --> 00:25:04.368]  My fingerprints were on that National Intelligence Estimate.
[00:25:04.428 --> 00:25:05.809]  I was in the community then.
[00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.012]  That was 13 years ago.
[00:25:10.153 --> 00:25:22.043]  We have done many, many things to improve our processes, particularly with respect to National Intelligence Estimates, in order to prevent that from happening again.
[00:25:22.776 --> 00:25:26.161]  Clapper played a very important role in that estimate.
[00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:31.969]  From 2001 to 2006, he headed the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
[00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:38.799]  This was the Pentagon unit that was responsible for interpreting spy satellite photos and other technically gathered intelligence.
[00:25:38.979 --> 00:25:47.963]  In October of 2003, James Clapper said that it was unquestionably true that Iraq moved weapons of mass destruction to Syria.
[00:25:48.383 --> 00:26:03.810]  He said he was providing a personal assessment, but he said the obvious conclusion one draws was that there, quote, may have been people leaving the scene, fleeing Iraq, and unquestionably, I am sure, material, end quote.
[00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:16.973]  So no further evidence was ever provided to support the general statement at the time, much like we still have yet to see any evidence to support their assessment that Russia interfered with our election.
[00:26:17.313 --> 00:26:24.194]  Now, even former Bush advisor Karl Rove cited Clapper's theory in his book as the excuse of why we went to war in Iraq.
[00:26:24.214 --> 00:26:27.175]  So now, once again, we are being asked to take
[00:26:27.475 --> 00:26:34.781]  Lying James Clapper on his word, on his personal assessment, something that could potentially take us into war with Russia.
[00:26:35.161 --> 00:26:42.908]  So what's more, today Clapper also expressed concern that President-elect Donald Trump is disparaging U.S.
[00:26:42.988 --> 00:26:47.591]  intelligence and he's potentially damaging public confidence.
[00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:54.337]  No, what is continually damaging the public confidence are your faulty assessments and lying under oath.
[00:26:54.757 --> 00:27:05.779]  That's what's causing the public to have a very healthy skepticism of these intelligence reports, especially when they could lead us into another war that American citizens do not want.
[00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:09.259]  Now, once again, Mr. Clapper offered no new details.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.141]  They said that their assessment is now even more resolute, whatever that means, that the Russians carried out the attack on the election.
[00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:23.942]  And they did indeed promise us an unclassified version of this report on the matter early next week.
[00:27:24.502 --> 00:27:32.077]  They also said it's going to include the motive of President Vladimir Putin of Russia in carrying it out.
[00:27:49.206 --> 00:28:03.893]  The bleeding heart left represented and echoed by the sycophantic mainstream media with all of its intended demagoguery is growing an internal threat to the future's safety.
[00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:04.933]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.246 --> 00:28:39.974]  Scalping him, beating him, and forcing him to repeat F Donald Trump and F white people.
[00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:41.776]  And it's Groundhog Day again as the same woman
[00:28:48.203 --> 00:29:01.636]  CNN contributor Simone Sanders repeats her defense of more blatant hate crimes as she recently did when back in November of 2016 a Trump supporter was pulled from his car and violently beaten.
[00:29:01.656 --> 00:29:05.860]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.681]  Oh my goodness!
[00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:07.502]  Poor white people!
[00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:07.842]  Please!
[00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:07.962]  Stop!
[00:29:08.783 --> 00:29:09.444]  Stop it, Carly.
[00:29:09.484 --> 00:29:12.488]  In my opinion, we don't need white people leaving the Democratic Party right now.
[00:29:12.508 --> 00:29:16.813]  I even hear Salome say that a white person should not leave the Democratic Party.
[00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:19.195]  What could be more racist than that?
[00:29:19.396 --> 00:29:23.440]  We cannot callously go about classifying things as a hate crime.
[00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:28.166]  When someone is repeatedly telling you that your community is the worst of the worst,
[00:29:28.206 --> 00:29:46.768]  If you had white teens who had tortured and brutalized an African-American young man, and those white teens had talked about Obama and had been laughing, I don't think we would be having a conversation about how, oh, our political discourse is so toxic and, you know, maybe these kids saw things on Twitter about Obama.
[00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:47.968]  That is not a hate crime.
[00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:51.230]  Hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity.
[00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.972]  That's what this is.
[00:29:57.012 --> 00:29:57.572]  It's evil.
[00:29:57.652 --> 00:29:58.372]  It's brutality.
[00:29:58.392 --> 00:30:00.193]  It's man's inhumanity to man.
[00:30:00.433 --> 00:30:02.554]  I don't think it's evil.
[00:30:02.794 --> 00:30:14.342]  And for some reason it's okay to the producers at CNN to promote this viewpoint because the victims fit the bill to fuel dangerous racial tensions in America.
[00:30:14.662 --> 00:30:19.125]  Is mainstream media that arrogant to think that Americans are that gullible?
[00:30:19.445 --> 00:30:27.371]  Or is active sedition now the way these overpaid media puppets are going to ultimately destroy their rickety platform
[00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:31.693]  With their 6% trust rating according to Pew Research.
[00:30:31.953 --> 00:30:42.197]  And although the Chicago Police said they were appalled by the teenage attacker's actions, the police spokesman still went on to downplay the hate crime aspect of the recorded events.
[00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:43.358]  They're 18.
[00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:45.639]  Kids make stupid decisions.
[00:30:45.699 --> 00:30:50.681]  I shouldn't call them kids, they're legally adults, but they're young adults and they make stupid decisions.
[00:30:51.741 --> 00:31:02.288]  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate crime is, if we seek a hate crime, to determine whether or not this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.
[00:31:02.568 --> 00:31:08.492]  But now, according to ABC7 in Chicago, hate crime charges are being filed.
[00:31:08.712 --> 00:31:28.857]  Jordan Hill, 18 of Carpentersville, Tesfaye Cooper, 18 of Chicago, Brittany Covington, 18 of Chicago, and Tanisha Covington, 24 of Chicago, were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and residential burglary.
[00:31:28.937 --> 00:31:33.558]  Hill was also charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.
[00:31:33.838 --> 00:31:36.939]  These are the people Simone Sanders would defend.
[00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:38.139]  Where will it end?
[00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:43.741]  Will the defense of racist hate crimes morph into the defense of Sharia law in America?
[00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:47.102]  A circumvention of the Constitution of the United States?
[00:31:47.442 --> 00:31:56.444]  While the treason of the mainstream media apparatus goes unchecked by the monolithic surveillance state that's purpose becomes clearer every day.
[00:31:56.784 --> 00:32:03.566]  A purpose not of the defense of the rights and safety of American citizens, but a tunnel vision purpose
[00:32:03.806 --> 00:32:04.508]  We're good to go.
[00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:24.920]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.641]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:27.341]  Okay?
[00:32:27.642 --> 00:32:30.503]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:32.404]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:32.424 --> 00:32:33.705]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:34.766]  This is Texas.
[00:32:35.006 --> 00:32:35.807]  You want to threaten me?
[00:32:35.827 --> 00:32:36.987]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:37.027 --> 00:32:37.668]  You understand that?
[00:32:37.828 --> 00:32:43.551]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:44.011 --> 00:32:47.854]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:03.484]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:03.504 --> 00:33:07.914]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.729]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:31.567]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[00:35:31.927 --> 00:35:33.389]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.

[00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:37.592]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.434]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:35:39.774 --> 00:35:42.797]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[00:35:43.077 --> 00:35:44.278]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:46.500]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:59.372]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.

[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.241]  It's like lightning in a bottle!

[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:50.437]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.414]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:09.895]  Well, I'm Margaret Hale, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:09.955 --> 00:37:17.000]  I'm joined by Jack Berkman, and he is the attorney representing Mary Rich, the mother of murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.601]  Jack, thank you for joining the InfoWar.
[00:37:19.762 --> 00:37:29.848]  We are wanting to talk about what you think really happened to Seth, and if his murder has any connection to the DNC leak, which I'm of the belief that it does.
[00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:31.529]  What's your opinion about this?
[00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.330]  We have a lot of breaking news, Margaret.
[00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.871]  We have things just evolving.
[00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:47.059]  In the last two weeks, I have received two calls, one on either December 26th or 27th, the other one two days ago, two nights ago.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:38:01.666]  Both of the callers essentially saying the same thing, and that is that they believe, and I believe these callers are credible, although more research needs to be done, that Seth had uncovered information
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:13.787]  That the Russians had done the hacking into the DNC and that therefore Seth was killed by the Russians and specifically the killings were ordered by Putin himself.
[00:38:14.847 --> 00:38:17.869]  So it is some level of breaking news.
[00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:19.790]  It is kind of the first step.
[00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.232]  Hopefully it's the first step in solving this case.
[00:38:23.712 --> 00:38:24.553]  Lots more to go.
[00:38:25.213 --> 00:38:31.437]  As I've said all along, it's you and the media who are important because you get this information out and that's what we need.
[00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:38.021]  I mean, Jack, just looking at this logically, though, isn't it a more plausible assumption, a more credible thought?
[00:38:38.882 --> 00:38:43.523]  You know, the DNC had everything to gain by keeping any information secret.
[00:38:43.563 --> 00:38:47.325]  What do the Russians possibly have to gain by killing the DNC leaker?
[00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:48.785]  I mean, that just doesn't add for me.
[00:38:50.926 --> 00:38:52.087]  Again, Margaret, it's hard to know.
[00:38:52.147 --> 00:38:55.490]  I'm not coming at this from any kind of an ideological perspective.
[00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.511]  I'm a Republican.
[00:38:56.551 --> 00:38:57.531]  Seth is a Democrat.
[00:38:57.591 --> 00:39:03.736]  My job for the family, representing the family, is getting to the truth, getting to the bottom of the matter through any means possible.
[00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:04.617]  That's what I do.
[00:39:05.097 --> 00:39:07.699]  Short answer is, I really don't know why.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:17.787]  Both of these callers suggested that Seth had discovered this information first, that he was in possession of this information long before anyone else.
[00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:22.311]  And that the Russians wanted him out of the way.
[00:39:22.712 --> 00:39:28.598]  Apparently they saw him as some kind of indispensable part of it all, and they saw him as a threat.
[00:39:29.059 --> 00:39:31.802]  We just don't know much more than that now.
[00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:36.867]  Both of these callers suggested to me that they would get back to me, and we are waiting.
[00:39:37.548 --> 00:39:38.509]  What does his family think?
[00:39:40.492 --> 00:39:41.013]  They don't know.
[00:39:41.433 --> 00:39:43.236]  We're all kind of in limbo right now.
[00:39:43.436 --> 00:39:44.718]  What we need is information.
[00:39:44.938 --> 00:39:47.723]  We need more information and we need to drive this story forward.
[00:39:47.923 --> 00:39:55.213]  You know, the way these things work, Margaret, you get, you have the first two people come forward, then the next five people come forward, then the next ten people come forward after that.
[00:39:55.934 --> 00:39:57.576]  And you get closer to your answer.
[00:39:57.616 --> 00:39:58.817]  That's the way all of this works.
[00:39:58.877 --> 00:39:59.037]  Right.
[00:39:59.077 --> 00:40:00.198]  Okay, but just walk me through this.
[00:40:00.218 --> 00:40:04.862]  So anybody looking at a murder investigation, Kathy Lanier was the DNC police chief at the time.
[00:40:04.942 --> 00:40:09.506]  She was quietly promoted to a cushy job in security, making four or five times her salary.
[00:40:09.546 --> 00:40:10.527]  I forget the exact number.
[00:40:10.987 --> 00:40:11.067]  Yeah.
[00:40:28.591 --> 00:40:37.975]  You know, there isn't a confirmation of that, because Assange won't confirm who actually leaked the information to WikiLeaks, but it is the assumption that he actually leaked the information.
[00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:50.239]  Now, where the Russians come in, and this really, it gets under my skin, because obviously I lived and worked in Russia, and knowing, they don't have anything to gain from killing the source of a hack.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:56.762]  Just looking at this from a reporter from Mayan, and the only people that have anything to gain would be
[00:40:57.182 --> 00:41:03.006]  The Democrats purporting this lie that Russia was involved in hacking our election and hacking the DNC.
[00:41:03.106 --> 00:41:06.549]  You're asking all good logical questions that any lawyer would ask.
[00:41:06.629 --> 00:41:13.854]  If you were an attorney presenting this case to a judge and jury, those are questions a lawyer would ask in terms of ascertaining motive.
[00:41:13.894 --> 00:41:15.916]  The short answer is, I just don't know.
[00:41:16.416 --> 00:41:17.937]  All of this is in its infancy.
[00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:19.818]  We have no idea.
[00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:21.580]  What I need is more information.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.161]  I think we have a good start.
[00:41:23.841 --> 00:41:25.943]  I think these guys are credible and we're going to go from here.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.341]  Why did you put up the money?
[00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:29.902]  Do you really think somebody's going to come after that money?
[00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:36.726]  Well, I put up the money anticipating just a circumstance like we have now.
[00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.167]  Like, take these two people.
[00:41:38.327 --> 00:41:40.608]  Crackpots calling you with anonymous tips?
[00:41:40.788 --> 00:41:42.709]  Well, I've gotten calls from crackpots.
[00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.830]  Again, it is what it is.
[00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:51.615]  My belief, for whatever, I've been a lawyer 25 years, you can tell me, you can take my word for whatever it's worth.
[00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:53.095]  I don't believe they are crackpots.
[00:41:54.818 --> 00:42:03.365]  When someone comes forward, when the person who knows how this happened eventually comes forward, they're probably going to have to get out of town.
[00:42:03.405 --> 00:42:04.766]  If they're in Washington, D.C.
[00:42:04.786 --> 00:42:08.789]  or wherever they are, they're going to have to skedaddle or somebody's going to whack them.
[00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:20.758]  And that's why I put up this money so that people coming forth would feel secure, would feel secure and would feel comfortable and confident in having the resources to get out of the way.
[00:42:22.193 --> 00:42:24.474]  Well, Jack, I know you've been in media a very long time.
[00:42:24.815 --> 00:42:35.521]  We understand the body count around the Clintons and I, for one, believe that they are responsible, in part, just my opinion, for a lot of that body count surrounding them, people asking the wrong questions.
[00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:35.741]  Who knows?
[00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:36.942]  You may, in fact, be right.
[00:42:36.962 --> 00:42:38.363]  You and Alex Jones may be right.
[00:42:38.403 --> 00:42:39.063]  I mean, who knows?
[00:42:39.543 --> 00:42:40.844]  I'm not saying you are.
[00:42:40.864 --> 00:42:41.765]  I'm not saying you aren't.
[00:42:41.805 --> 00:42:42.365]  I'm a lawyer.
[00:42:42.425 --> 00:42:44.926]  My mind works in terms of evidence.
[00:42:45.046 --> 00:42:48.869]  My only purpose here today is to present this evidence to you.
[00:42:49.389 --> 00:42:56.253]  I want to get this story out there so you have two guys come forward, then the next two come forward, then the next five come forward.
[00:42:56.313 --> 00:42:57.713]  That's how these cases work.
[00:42:57.854 --> 00:42:59.875]  Did you talk to them directly, Jack?
[00:42:59.895 --> 00:43:00.795]  Oh yes.
[00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:02.376]  Oh no, they called me.
[00:43:02.596 --> 00:43:04.017]  Were they American citizens?
[00:43:04.628 --> 00:43:04.908]  Yes.
[00:43:05.028 --> 00:43:05.629]  Well, who knows?
[00:43:06.509 --> 00:43:08.850]  They have no discernible trace of an accent.
[00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:16.974]  They appear, for whatever my judgment is worth, once again, to be Native American speakers of English.
[00:43:17.354 --> 00:43:17.594]  Okay.
[00:43:17.794 --> 00:43:20.456]  And that's all I know.
[00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:25.366]  Okay, so the DNC, do they even care?
[00:43:25.486 --> 00:43:28.348]  I mean, are you working with the DNC, with Donna Brazile, with anyone?
[00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:30.829]  I talked to Donna Brazile a couple of times, a bunch of times actually.
[00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:31.590]  She's been helpful.
[00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.192]  I mean, I think she genuinely wants to help.
[00:43:34.292 --> 00:43:35.493]  I think she's working now.
[00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:37.514]  I don't know the details.
[00:43:37.534 --> 00:43:40.977]  The Nebraska Democratic Party is going to put some money up, I think, enhancing the reward.
[00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:42.958]  I look for the reward to soon be over $250,000.
[00:43:43.018 --> 00:43:45.040]  That's a lot of money.
[00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:49.563]  You know, and that's a very positive thing.
[00:43:49.923 --> 00:43:50.684]  I think they've been helpful.
[00:43:53.972 --> 00:43:55.072]  Look, I'm in the other party.
[00:43:55.693 --> 00:43:57.074]  We're on the other side of the fence.
[00:43:57.194 --> 00:43:59.596]  I'm over where your guy Alex Jones is.
[00:44:00.997 --> 00:44:04.700]  But look, this could have happened to any one of my staff.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.683]  I have young Republicans, young Democrats, young Independents work for me.
[00:44:08.783 --> 00:44:12.346]  People of all shapes, sizes, creeds, colors, ideologies.
[00:44:12.806 --> 00:44:14.487]  It's not about one party or the other.
[00:44:14.507 --> 00:44:16.629]  This could have happened to any one of us.
[00:44:16.669 --> 00:44:17.870]  That's why I'm involved.
[00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.331]  I don't want it to happen to any of us.
[00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:22.593]  I mean, look, Jack, this isn't coming from an ideological standpoint.
[00:44:22.613 --> 00:44:23.914]  This is coming from a human standpoint.
[00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:27.956]  Everybody wants to know who killed Seth Rich and why, specifically.
[00:44:28.137 --> 00:44:30.418]  And I have a difficult time believing.
[00:44:30.578 --> 00:44:33.940]  I lived four blocks from where he was murdered in Washington, D.C.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:34.661]  for years.
[00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:45.168]  I have a hard time believing, with all of the security cameras on every inch, on every corner of every building in that area, why there wasn't a single camera that picked up him being murdered.
[00:44:45.648 --> 00:44:47.009]  I have a serious problem with that.
[00:44:47.969 --> 00:44:54.114]  You may know this, you've studied this, we have one piece of footage that shows, that's where we learned there were two people involved.
[00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:56.535]  We have the pant legs in the scuffle.
[00:44:56.936 --> 00:44:59.597]  We have some noise, some of it audible, some of it not.
[00:44:59.617 --> 00:45:01.098]  There's not a lot there.
[00:45:02.139 --> 00:45:05.281]  We've been over this again, the police were helpful with this.
[00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:09.144]  There's just sadly, all we really have is the one piece of video and it's brief.
[00:45:09.684 --> 00:45:13.067]  Why do you think the police declared it a robbery?
[00:45:14.904 --> 00:45:15.624]  Oh, who knows?
[00:45:15.704 --> 00:45:26.468]  The police, you know, any Metropolitan Police Department, not just ours, wants to be done with these cases if they can't solve them quickly because they've become political and public relations.
[00:45:26.488 --> 00:45:28.389]  Do you think that they were pressured to be done with them?
[00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:30.369]  Oh, pressured.
[00:45:30.389 --> 00:45:31.169]  This one in particular?
[00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.611]  Right now they're probably being pressured to keep it going because the mayor is worried about re-election.
[00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:37.871]  I'm sure they're pressured to keep this whole thing going.
[00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:42.132]  You know, these cases go into the cold case file fast.
[00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:48.634]  I think because of my involvement, my job is to keep the pressure on them and keep the media pressure and media focus on this.
[00:45:49.254 --> 00:45:53.435]  Jack, who are you for viewers who may not recognize you and what's motivating you?
[00:45:54.437 --> 00:45:58.119]  Viewers who wouldn't wreck... Margaret, you mean there are viewers who wouldn't wreck computer lore?
[00:45:58.139 --> 00:46:00.680]  Oh, I'm an attorney and a lobbyist in Washington.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.861]  I host a radio show called Behind the Curtain.
[00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:06.882]  But for people who want to know why you're doing this, Jack, I guess that's my question.
[00:46:06.942 --> 00:46:13.145]  Not who are you and your credentials, but who are you in terms of, you know, you mentioned it, you're a Republican.
[00:46:13.425 --> 00:46:17.727]  What vested interest do you have in even, you know, representing the rich family?
[00:46:18.167 --> 00:46:21.349]  Margaret, this is one of those rare instances where somebody's actually telling you the truth.
[00:46:21.389 --> 00:46:22.109]  Can you believe it?
[00:46:23.009 --> 00:46:24.150]  I stand by what I said.
[00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.671]  I'm doing this because it could have happened to any one of us.
[00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:29.552]  It could have happened to any one of the young people who work for me.
[00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:31.994]  We're all in one big political fraternity.
[00:46:32.034 --> 00:46:32.794]  It's one nation.
[00:46:33.214 --> 00:46:33.874]  It's one nation.
[00:46:34.034 --> 00:46:36.536]  Democratic Party, they're not the enemy.
[00:46:36.856 --> 00:46:39.617]  They're just the loyal opposition in the United States.
[00:46:39.657 --> 00:46:40.578]  This is one country.
[00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:42.078]  We're not supposed to hate the Democrats.
[00:46:42.378 --> 00:46:44.479]  Jack, I hate to cut you off.
[00:46:44.519 --> 00:46:45.440]  That's an excellent point.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.420]  We are out of time.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.662]  I am joined by Jack Berkman, the attorney representing
[00:46:50.263 --> 00:46:53.041]  The family of the murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich.
[00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:53.585]  Thank you, Margaret.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:02.303]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:18.658]  The surveillance state architects were proudly peacocking their smoke and mirrors routine on Capitol Hill today.
[00:49:18.958 --> 00:49:24.502]  The Senate Armed Service Committee brought together by none other than ISIS confidant and U.S.
[00:49:24.643 --> 00:49:28.145]  veterans nemesis Arizona Senator John McCain.
[00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:37.432]  In October our intelligence agencies concluded unanimously that quote the government the Russian government directed compromises of emails from U.S.
[00:49:37.492 --> 00:49:38.974]  persons and institutions
[00:49:39.614 --> 00:49:40.575]  Including from U.S.
[00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:42.036]  political organizations.
[00:49:42.577 --> 00:49:56.890]  They also assess that, quote, disclosures of alleged hacked emails were consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian directed efforts, and that these thefts and disclosures were intended to interfere with the U.S.
[00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.111]  election process.
[00:49:58.711 --> 00:50:04.557]  As we do, we must recognize that the recent Russian attacks are one part of a much bigger cyber problem.
[00:50:06.278 --> 00:50:13.165]  Russian cyber attacks have targeted the White House, the Joint Staff, the State Department, our critical infrastructure.
[00:50:13.545 --> 00:50:15.607]  Despite the indifference of some to this matter.
[00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:23.871]  Our nation needs to know in detail what the intelligence community has concluded was an assault by senior officials of a foreign government on our electoral process.
[00:50:24.612 --> 00:50:27.594]  Our electoral process is the bedrock of our system of government.
[00:50:28.294 --> 00:50:41.742]  An effort to manipulate it, especially by a regime with values and interests so antithetical to our own, is a challenge to the nation's security, which must be met with bipartisan and universal condemnation, consequences, and correction.
[00:50:42.629 --> 00:50:46.291]  The biggest frustration in me is speed, speed, speed.
[00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:48.551]  We have got to get faster.
[00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:50.012]  We've got to be more agile.
[00:50:51.012 --> 00:50:58.055]  And so for me, at least within my span of control, I'm constantly asking the team, what can we do to be faster and more agile?
[00:50:58.375 --> 00:50:59.636]  How do we organize ourselves?
[00:50:59.676 --> 00:51:01.477]  What's the construct that makes the most sense?
[00:51:02.257 --> 00:51:05.638]  We can't be bound by history and tradition here, so to speak.
[00:51:05.678 --> 00:51:07.399]  We have to be willing to look at alternatives.
[00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:26.216]  And just when the stench of hypocrisy began to fumigate the room, National Defense Director James Clapper, a man who previously blatantly lied to Congress... Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:28.018]  No, sir.
[00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:30.019]  It does not?
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.761]  Not wittingly.
[00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:40.717]  There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly.
[00:51:40.877 --> 00:51:42.198]  Now why do you say he was lying there?
[00:51:42.238 --> 00:52:01.350]  Because the letter that he sent to Congress to which you referred a few minutes ago which was dated March 28th and released yesterday admitted that they roam through the content of phone calls and the content of emails and the content of text messages without a warrant in direct contradiction to what he said to that
[00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.252]  Help us understand, had the supposed invasion into the Vermont utility been, in fact, an invasion by a foreign power?
[00:52:27.595 --> 00:52:31.397]  And ascribed to that was shutting it down.
[00:52:32.877 --> 00:52:38.439]  If that had been the case, what would be some of the options that we would do?
[00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:49.102]  Had it been from, say, malware planted by a foreign power, I think that something would be very situational dependent as to what to do about it.
[00:52:49.382 --> 00:52:50.743]  As I indicated in my remarks,
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.005]  Perhaps a cyber reaction to a cyber act may not be the best course of action.
[00:52:58.185 --> 00:53:11.698]  And the narrative continued as Cyber Security Representative Texas Representative Mike McCaul announced that the cyber security operations would be compacted into yet another agency under the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:15.321]  I think Mitch McConnell said it after I said it that Russia's not our front.
[00:53:16.002 --> 00:53:30.166]  A lot of our interests are not aligned and certainly not in the region where we find Russia being aggressive in Crimea and Ukraine and the Baltic States and now back in the Middle East since the first time since Afghanistan.
[00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:39.889]  So I think Russia's been very aggressive and weakness invites aggression and I think that's what we've seen the last eight years.
[00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:43.050]  Get ready for the next shoe to drop, America.
[00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:52.976]  Once the foxes in the henhouse have their eggs in one basket, it won't be long before another feast on our Bill of Rights will be served.
[00:53:53.516 --> 00:53:55.498]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:54:00.962 --> 00:54:04.484]  It is a story we first broke here on Fox 32 News.
[00:54:04.564 --> 00:54:10.507]  And tonight, there is breaking information on the victim of a torture case, broadcast live on Facebook.
[00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:16.330]  Yeah, Vinny, it's a case out of Chicago, but it's the number one trending topic on Twitter here in Atlanta right now.
[00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:23.053]  And we want to warn you, the video, the details of what happened are shocking and very exciting.
[00:54:23.073 --> 00:54:23.653]  Donald Trump!
[00:54:23.673 --> 00:54:24.914]  Don't f**king lie to me!
[00:54:25.014 --> 00:54:25.194]  What?
[00:54:25.214 --> 00:54:26.955]  F**k all of you bitches!
[00:54:29.239 --> 00:54:29.400]  Go?
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:29.782]  Go!
[00:54:33.499 --> 00:54:38.702]  Many people took to Facebook outraged, wondering whether this will be considered a hate crime.
[00:54:39.062 --> 00:54:41.223]  I think some of it is just stupidity.
[00:54:41.643 --> 00:54:46.085]  You know, people just ranting about something that they think might make a headline.
[00:54:46.426 --> 00:54:52.429]  I don't think that, at this point, we don't have anything concrete.
[00:54:52.609 --> 00:55:03.114]  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate crime is, if we seek a hate crime, to determine whether or not this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.
[00:55:03.454 --> 00:55:04.475]  Oh my brother great.
[00:55:04.675 --> 00:55:09.198]  I know I should knock your ass out right now.
[00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:09.698]  Stand up.
[00:55:09.718 --> 00:55:10.038]  Stand up.
[00:55:10.058 --> 00:55:10.639]  Stand up one.
[00:55:10.679 --> 00:55:11.259]  Let me see.
[00:55:22.326 --> 00:55:33.094]  This is absolutely sickening, but I'm gonna say something that's probably not very popular.
[00:55:33.755 --> 00:55:37.778]  We cannot callously go about classifying things as a hate crime.
[00:55:38.198 --> 00:55:39.279]  Motive here matters.
[00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:45.343]  What I heard is both people on both sides should just cut it all out and a hate crime is not the same thing as protesting.
[00:55:45.403 --> 00:55:46.544]  We have to be very deliberate about it.
[00:55:46.604 --> 00:55:50.928]  Adam, what do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:55:51.028 --> 00:55:51.489]  Oh my goodness!
[00:55:51.509 --> 00:55:51.969]  Poor white people!
[00:55:51.989 --> 00:55:52.189]  Please!
[00:55:52.209 --> 00:55:52.370]  Stop!
[00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.790]  Your ass, bro.
[00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:53.831]  Now that's your bill, bro.
[00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:54.271]  Now take this!
[00:55:54.312 --> 00:55:54.692]  Now watch out, bro!
[00:55:54.712 --> 00:55:54.932]  Watch out!
[00:55:54.952 --> 00:55:55.272]  Now take this!
[00:55:55.313 --> 00:55:55.593]  Now take this!
[00:55:55.613 --> 00:55:55.913]  Now take this!
[00:55:55.933 --> 00:55:56.273]  Now take this!
[00:55:56.293 --> 00:55:56.734]  Now take this!
[00:55:56.754 --> 00:55:57.114]  Now take this!
[00:55:57.134 --> 00:55:57.435]  Now take this!
[00:55:57.455 --> 00:55:57.795]  Now take this!

[00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:18.785]  I just want to remind folks that we cannot sit here and ignore the poor.
[00:56:19.385 --> 00:56:27.471]  At least for the last year, on very public display, the worst parts of America have been brought from the fringe into the mainstream.
[00:56:27.831 --> 00:56:29.793]  So that affects people on both sides.
[00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:45.887]  We've talked about white nationalists and white supremacists and the KKK, but there are also, when this inflammatory rhetoric is out there, when someone is repeatedly telling you that your community is the worst of the worst, it brings out the worst of the worst in people.
[00:56:46.127 --> 00:56:53.453]  Police believe he went willingly initially, but that is clearly not the case based on three videos posted to social media.
[00:56:53.873 --> 00:56:56.295]  What you are about to see is disturbing.
[00:56:56.836 --> 00:57:02.120]  At one point, the victim is held at knife point and told to curse President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.523]  The men can be heard saying they want this to go viral.
[00:57:06.063 --> 00:57:10.527]  Another video shows the group forcing the victim to drink water from a toilet.
[00:57:10.947 --> 00:57:14.409]  Throughout these videos, the victim is kicked, hit, and cut.
[00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:19.392]  Police believe he was released after being held anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.
[00:57:19.953 --> 00:57:23.695]  Officers found him walking along Lexington and Homan on the west side.
[00:57:24.035 --> 00:57:29.238]  You know, Don, at the end of the day, you just try to wrap your head around evil.
[00:57:29.398 --> 00:57:30.039]  That's what this is.
[00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:33.601]  It's evil, it's brutality, it's man's inhumanity to man.
[00:57:33.801 --> 00:57:35.622]  I don't think it's evil.
[00:57:36.523 --> 00:57:37.383]  I don't think it's evil.
[00:57:37.423 --> 00:57:39.825]  I think these are young people and I think they have bad homes ready.
[00:57:40.245 --> 00:57:41.566]  Get the f*** out of Trump!
[00:57:41.666 --> 00:57:43.066]  Get the f*** out of him, boy!
[00:57:43.867 --> 00:57:49.249]  Get the f*** out of him, you b****!
[00:57:49.429 --> 00:57:49.649]  Goof!
[00:57:49.749 --> 00:57:49.910]  Go!
[00:57:53.925 --> 00:58:00.051]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you have witnessed the craziness in our government and in our media that's going on right now.
[00:58:00.431 --> 00:58:06.596]  But the good news is, I think that this is actually waking Americans up and bringing Americans together.
[00:58:06.656 --> 00:58:11.801]  They're sitting here like, well, surely Trump can't be worse than the people who are sitting here smearing him all day.
[00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:13.903]  And we've got some numbers that might indicate that.
[00:58:13.943 --> 00:58:15.945]  There were some Rasmussen polls that came out today.
[00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:20.008]  57% of Democrats want Trump to succeed.
[00:58:20.048 --> 00:58:20.988]  I think that's good news.
[00:58:21.028 --> 00:58:22.790]  They're saying, hey, let's give Trump a chance.
[00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:27.993]  He certainly can't be as bad as the liars in the government and the mainstream media make him out to be.
[00:58:28.254 --> 00:58:29.895]  Let's give him a chance and see what happens when he gets in.
[00:58:30.415 --> 00:58:36.580]  Dolce and Gabbana gets heat for dressing Melania Trump and they say, you know what, screw you.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.200]  We're going to do it.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:41.083]  We don't have to listen to your politically correct liberal crybaby nonsense.
[00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:43.085]  Here's something for the Obama legacy.
[00:58:43.305 --> 00:58:47.729]  As Obama era closes, goal to end veteran homelessness is unmet.
[00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:48.390]  What do you know?
[00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:51.513]  Another promise from Barack Obama doesn't come through.
[00:58:51.673 --> 00:58:55.377]  I promise that the InfoWars Nightly News will be back tomorrow night 7 p.m.
[00:58:55.417 --> 00:58:55.778]  Central.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
