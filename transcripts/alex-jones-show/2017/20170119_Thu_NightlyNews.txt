[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.576]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:24.880]  It is Thursday, January 19th, 2017, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.000]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:37.469]  Tonight, the fake news network CNN has a message for anti-Trump rioters and agitators.
[00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:45.175]  If Donald Trump is killed during the inauguration, Obama's appointee will become president.
[00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:59.091]  Meanwhile, a $20,000 donor to the DNC and friend of the Clintons has been arrested for posting a death threat to Donald Trump on Twitter.
[00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.011]  Dumbass.
[00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:09.654]  Then, InfoWars prepares for Inauguration Day as the radical left plot chaos and destruction in Washington.
[00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:16.796]  All that plus a pardon from Barack Obama that only Bill Ayers would appreciate.
[00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:22.183]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:08.726]  Well, the network that is bringing you all of the fake news is now apparently dealing in hypotheticals.
[00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:14.430]  That's right, CNN is now getting slammed for encouraging violence with this bizarre report.
[00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:19.814]  Now, this was entitled, Disaster Could Put Obama Cabinet Member in the Oval Office.
[00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:26.459]  So this report admits that there is no specific threat targeting the inauguration, but it goes on to speculate
[00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:33.940]  About who would be in charge if an attack hit the incoming president just as the transfer of power is underway.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.781]  Take a listen.
[00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:41.282]  The designated presidential successor will not attend the inauguration, ready to step in if something happens.
[00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:45.603]  But it won't be a Trump cabinet secretary, since none of them have been confirmed yet.
[00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.683]  It will be an Obama appointee.
[00:03:48.023 --> 00:03:51.244]  Does the line of succession switch to the new president's lineup at noon?
[00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.387]  In the inauguration, you have two lines of succession.
[00:03:54.547 --> 00:04:04.919]  One for the Barack Obama administration, which is still in place, and one which really won't be in place until Donald Trump is inaugurated, comes into office, and actually formally nominates and the Senate confirms his people.
[00:04:05.404 --> 00:04:06.085]  Did you get that?
[00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:16.218]  So the report really emphasizes that a president from the prior administration would be put in office, an Obama appointee, if there's some sort of a tragedy.
[00:04:16.518 --> 00:04:21.785]  So is this that tragedy or anything could happen scenario that Michael Moore was alluding to?
[00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:23.345]  So, this is a report.
[00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:29.466]  It's teasing this potential foreign attack by asserting that it would create chaos and high theater.
[00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:31.347]  Oh, you could only wish, CNN.
[00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:35.768]  But it started airing clips from ABC's designated survivor show.
[00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:46.630]  And this is where Kiefer Sutherland plays an obscure cabinet secretary who is unexpectedly thrust into the presidency after an attack at the Capitol during a State of the Union address.
[00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.014]  So wow, they're playing clips of some predictive programming that could potentially incite some sort of violence at the inauguration.
[00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:56.815]  This is very dangerous.
[00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.316]  Of course, the network is under fire.
[00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:05.540]  A lot of people on YouTube gave this many, many thumbs down, but they're saying, you know, totally not suggesting anything here, huh, CNN?
[00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:11.864]  So leftist terrorists now know who they need to take out so that the Dems can stay in power.
[00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:13.445]  Irresponsible journalism.
[00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:14.846]  Absolutely it is.
[00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:25.194]  And if this shoe was on the other foot, if CNN, you know, if this was Hillary Clinton about to swear, take the oath and swear into office, do you think they'd be putting this report out?
[00:05:25.374 --> 00:05:26.014]  I don't think so.
[00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:30.678]  Because let's just flash back to a few months ago before the election,
[00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:41.023]  When Donald Trump was talking about Hillary Clinton threatening the Second Amendment and how she was so dangerous and he said, you know, perhaps some Second Amendment people can take her out.
[00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:48.027]  And of course, he was talking about the NRA and their lobbyists being able to get to the constituents and get her out of there.
[00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:53.190]  But no, the media went into an uproar and said that Donald Trump was hinting at an
[00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.671]  We're good to go.
[00:06:19.973 --> 00:06:24.056]  Seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy and crisis.
[00:06:24.436 --> 00:06:34.822]  So I wonder if any of these people are going to be speaking out against CNN's irresponsible journalism and basically letting any crazy person who might have this idea to take out Donald Trump saying, hey, by the way,
[00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:39.963]  If you do it, somebody President Obama appoints will be put in power.
[00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:49.386]  Someone like the crazy person who was arrested by Miami Beach Police on Tuesday for allegedly threatening President-elect Donald Trump online.
[00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:50.286]  Guess what?
[00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:55.127]  He's a member of a prominent Northeast family close to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:59.409]  So here's someone who could be encouraged to take out Donald Trump at the inauguration.
[00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:00.169]  This guy,
[00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.251]  Dominic Popolo Jr.
[00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:16.224]  He once gave $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee, and he sat near Hillary Clinton when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother, who died in one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:21.850]  So here's someone who has a long history with Hillary Clinton, very connected to her, and has already
[00:07:22.771 --> 00:07:30.096]  Now been put in jail for some obviously very serious threats that he was making on Twitter to threaten Trump's life.
[00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:45.927]  So actually a reporter, Ashley Beckford, was in New York recently and she just filed a quick report on just how impossible and how really difficult it is for Secret Service to protect Donald Trump and his family as he's moving out of New York into D.C.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:59.075]  I'm here at Trump Tower in New York City, and as you can see through the press corral, the free speech zone, there is a huge amount of police here.
[00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:01.999]  There's a huge police presence here at Trump Tower.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:15.947]  One of the representatives of the New York Police Department, the NYPD, John Miller, said that this actually protecting Trump presents an unprecedented challenge.
[00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:25.293]  They've never seen anything like it in the history of New York City to have to protect a president-elect and a president seen to be inaugurated
[00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:26.894]  In New York City.
[00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:37.185]  He has said Donald Trump has vowed that he will travel on a regular basis between New York City and the White House to his home here in Trump Tower.
[00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:39.168]  So there you have it.
[00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:41.330]  We have a huge security presence.
[00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.895]  You're not even allowed to walk on that side of the street unless you're specifically going to Trump Tower.
[00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:53.302]  You see there's reporters for fake news just gathered here at all times, I guess of the day and night, I don't know.
[00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:59.268]  Just waiting for Trump, just waiting to see what will happen with his presidency.
[00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:02.991]  And here we have a long shot of the tower.
[00:09:03.632 --> 00:09:04.233]  It's huge!
[00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.359]  Let's make America great again, folks.
[00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:19.225]  But these hypothetical assassination scenarios are, you know, that's not enough drama for the mainstream media.
[00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:31.597]  They actually want to go on and just put the fear in people who are planning on attending the inauguration by warning of inauguration drone bombing and saying it's just not even safe to be there.
[00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:33.619]  So this was on Thursday Today Show.
[00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.880]  This was a report indicating that U.S.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:46.167]  Secret Service has put in place several anti-drone efforts out of concern that an eye-inspired flying IED will smash into the crowd or worse.
[00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:56.374]  And they're reporting a quoted official from DroneShield and he goes on to say, attending the inauguration is not something that I would feel safe at.
[00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:59.596]  So just putting that fear that any time a drone could take someone out.
[00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:04.718]  So this today's show report was headlined, Drone Danger at Inauguration.
[00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:07.579]  Dealing with a new high-flying security threat.
[00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:13.642]  Noting that these drone bombs are seen flying over coalition forces in Iraq at least once a day.
[00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:20.285]  And we know that they've been talking a lot about how ISIS could get their hands on something like this and they would target crowds, target the stadiums.
[00:10:20.725 --> 00:10:26.648]  And so they really kind of strike it home by saying, when strapped with a bomb, a worst-case scenario,
[00:10:27.008 --> 00:10:27.128]  Yes.
[00:10:45.038 --> 00:10:49.499]  A virtual fortress on Thursday ahead of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.
[00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:54.860]  Police cars are lining much of Pennsylvania Avenue all along the parade route.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.920]  Workers are unloading crowd control fences from trucks.
[00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.141]  So they're working on barricades as well.
[00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:10.643]  But they are expecting an unprecedented number of protests, rallies, very much more than what is typical at recent presidential inaugurations.
[00:11:11.283 --> 00:11:11.583]  I don't know.
[00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:46.031]  Kind of in response and they're very aware of this disrupt J-20 group which has vowed to stage mass demonstrations at each of the 12 security checkpoints and block access to the festivities at the National Mall.
[00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:48.253]  So they've already said they wanted to make it as
[00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:52.075]  As difficult as possible for anyone to attend the inauguration.
[00:11:52.635 --> 00:11:53.215]  But guess what?
[00:11:53.415 --> 00:12:05.519]  Cops that are working at this inauguration are already prepped to handle this mass chaos because they think there's going to be an unprecedented number of arrests and they want to avoid chaos in the jails.
[00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:16.542]  So their secret weapon is going to be mobile booking stations where they can issue citations and then release the demonstrators back on the street if they haven't committed any
[00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:17.582]  Anything
[00:12:37.032 --> 00:12:41.075]  Craziness going down there, but our guys are on the ground to capture it all.
[00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:41.476]  Who knows?
[00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:46.419]  But any crimes of assault, battery, or worse will almost guarantee a ride to jail.
[00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:52.364]  So, you know, this is the kind of stuff that they are teaching at this Disrupt J20 group.
[00:12:52.384 --> 00:13:05.334]  They actually held several seminars to coach people on how to do things, illegal things, and not get in trouble, or how to get in the least amount of trouble, or commit just enough crime that you
[00:13:05.874 --> 00:13:07.915]  You know, they maybe won't give you a ride to jail.
[00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:14.519]  So this was actually an activist meeting held at American University in Washington, D.C.
[00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:17.900]  There was a lawyer there offering tips on how to handle getting arrested.
[00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:25.024]  So these legal training sessions are being offered by the anti-Trump activists calling themselves Disrupt J20.
[00:13:25.044 --> 00:13:29.687]  Of course, James O'Keefe and Project Veritas expose the inner workings of this group.
[00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:45.159]  And so people who attended the seminar were actually asked to sign a waiver alleviating the university of any potential legal action because they say, I'm pretty sure you guys are being taught how to commit crimes here on our university and we want nothing to do with this.
[00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:51.964]  But they say, we're bringing widespread civil resistance to the streets of Washington, D.C.
[00:13:52.084 --> 00:13:54.667]  Protests, direct actions, even parties.
[00:13:55.527 --> 00:13:58.831]  And this is one of the organizers is a radical activist.
[00:13:58.891 --> 00:14:01.674]  He's been involved in radical activism for about 20 years.
[00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:05.899]  And he says, we're not just organizing some boring ass march.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.701]  We want direct action.
[00:14:08.662 --> 00:14:13.168]  So, you know, this direct action is described as
[00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:24.256]  Non-violent and less often violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the direct action participants.
[00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:39.548]  And you can see there with the b-roll the types of property that has been deemed offensive to anyone who's taking part as they're burning down trees, knocking out electrical grids, beating each other up, setting fire in the street, blocking traffic.
[00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:44.632]  So, you know, but this is the kind of stuff that the mainstream media isn't really talking about.
[00:14:44.692 --> 00:14:49.095]  They're bringing you these hypothetical scenarios, but they're not even talking at all about the J-20.
[00:14:49.115 --> 00:15:09.512]  The only time they even actually reported on the Project Veritas video exposing what these people were planning was to say that James O'Keefe made the whole thing up, that he was inciting these people and getting them to say things on camera, and then reporting from the perspective of these J-20 participants that they fed James O'Keefe false information.
[00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:36.583]  So here, on the one hand, you have the mainstream media completely making stuff, potential hypothetical scenarios of assassinations and IEDs coming from drone bombs, when they're not telling you at all about actual planned civil resistance that is going to take place in Washington, D.C., basically setting themselves up to be complicit if any type of stampede scenario happens or anything like that.
[00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.164]  They should be teaching people about
[00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:43.007]  You know, how to protect yourselves or stand back from any of these crazy protesters.
[00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:51.213]  But I think someone who's, you know, on a lot of these flyers with these J-20 activists is the bomb maker Bill Ayers.
[00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:57.237]  And he's going to be there taking part in this civil disobedience.
[00:15:57.577 --> 00:16:02.599]  But he actually took to Twitter to celebrate Obama's clemency of Oscar Lopez Rivera.
[00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:12.122]  So this is, you know, old friend Barack Obama, good friend there with Bill Ayers, the bomb maker, but he commuted the federal prison sentence
[00:16:12.922 --> 00:16:16.424]  Who, of Oscar Rivera, who's another bomb-making terrorist.
[00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:25.747]  He was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 1981 on charges of seditious conspiracy, robbery, and transportation of firearms and explosive charges.
[00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:34.551]  The group that he was working with carried out around 130 bombings across the U.S., killing six people and injuring dozens more.
[00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:40.436]  And actually, Bill Clinton first offered to grant this guy clemency in 1999.
[00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:48.282]  Despite the group's use of violence, Clinton said he felt that the terrorist sentences were just too harsh given their crimes.
[00:16:48.302 --> 00:16:54.067]  You know, killing people, setting off bombs everywhere, causing tremendous chaos, and committing acts of domestic terror.
[00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:55.968]  You know, we should take it easy on them.
[00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:57.189]  They're just misunderstood.
[00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:06.555]  But the reason why Clinton didn't grant him clemency then was because Rivera refused to comply with the condition that he disavow the use of terrorism.
[00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:13.059]  So this guy decides to stay in prison for another couple of decades because he will not disavow the use of terrorism.
[00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.020]  So what does President Obama do?
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.922]  Grant some clemency, probably doesn't even have any conditions for this guy.
[00:17:19.463 --> 00:17:25.467]  So, Mr. Weather Underground, who also used bombs to advance a terrorist agenda, Bill Ayers, is celebrating that.
[00:17:25.987 --> 00:17:39.057]  And again, this is sort of another message to whistleblowers or to anyone, you know, with the commuting Chelsea Manning sentence, kind of letting anyone that's going to be dealing with Donald Trump's administration know,
[00:17:39.577 --> 00:17:41.438]  Hey, you want to set off a few bombs?
[00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:43.559]  You know, target the Pentagon or whatever?
[00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:44.619]  It's fine.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.401]  Some president in the future will grant you clemency.
[00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:59.326]  And in fact, just like Bill Ayers, you'll go on to enter the world of academia and become a community activist in Chicago and could actually become friends with the future president of the United States.
[00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:03.708]  So I feel like he's kind of sending a message to any of these activists saying, you know what?
[00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:04.569]  Don't worry about it, guys.
[00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:06.730]  I was a little trouble there in D.C.
[00:18:08.732 --> 00:18:15.077]  But activists be warned, the CIA has actually unveiled new rules for collecting information on Americans.
[00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:22.323]  They had to release this in response to a lot of people saying that they were violating the privacy and civil rights of the American people.
[00:18:22.844 --> 00:18:25.226]  But they have unveiled these new procedures.
[00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:30.410]  They're going to keep all your information on file for at least five years and screw you and your civil rights.
[00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.673]  We'll be right back with more InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.692]  We will make America great again!
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.

[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.

[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:18.060]  Alright, Rob Dew here outside D.C., or just outside the offices of the Daily Caller, which are up there on the 9th floor, and we just interviewed Roger Stone, and he's going to tell you about his brand new book, The Making of a President, and it's about Donald J. Trump scoring a big political upset.
[00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:21.383]  Don't worry about that, this mic's awesome, it'll catch all your vocals.
[00:23:21.423 --> 00:23:22.344]  Here you go, here you go Roger.
[00:23:22.364 --> 00:23:22.724]  Great.
[00:23:23.904 --> 00:23:24.405]  Thanks, Rob.
[00:23:39.744 --> 00:23:44.106]  Harry Truman's come-from-behind surprise victory over Tom Dewey.
[00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:53.530]  Trump mounted a Herculean effort against all odds being outspent five and six to one to become President of the United States.
[00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.391]  So this is the definitive inside story.
[00:23:57.052 --> 00:24:05.836]  And we focus on how we've reached the tipping point where the mainstream media has lost its monopoly control of political information in America.
[00:24:06.616 --> 00:24:19.439]  And now, more Americans are going to net-based sites like InfoWars, Breitbart, The Daily Caller, Vox, Vice, and so many others for a different point of view.
[00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:26.581]  And that, more than anything else, provides the leverage for the upset victory by Donald Trump.
[00:24:29.262 --> 00:24:31.862]  Tell people where they can get the book and a little bit about it.
[00:24:31.902 --> 00:24:32.963]  What else is inside?
[00:24:33.043 --> 00:24:34.043]  A little secret, maybe?
[00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:50.406]  Well, the book reveals, among other things, that former President Richard Nixon was the first one to see the possibilities of a Trump presidency, and how Donald Trump did seriously look at running for president in 2000, 200, 2012.
[00:24:53.689 --> 00:24:55.431]  But how the time was really not right.
[00:24:55.692 --> 00:24:58.536]  That 2016 was the perfect storm.
[00:24:59.837 --> 00:25:04.163]  2016 was the correct confluence of events that made his election possible.
[00:25:04.443 --> 00:25:08.128]  Now, you can get this book by going to the InfoWars.com store.
[00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:10.511]  You can get it by going to Amazon.
[00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:15.877]  You can get it by going to Barnesandnoble.com where it's available for pre-order.
[00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:20.782]  And yes, I will be happy to sign the book for anyone who buys it.
[00:25:21.342 --> 00:25:23.605]  If you steal it, well, I might sign it anyway.
[00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.910]  Alright, thanks a lot.
[00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.911]  This is Rob Dew with InfoWars.com.
[00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:29.711]  There's Roger Stone.
[00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:31.833]  He's going off to do another interview with Vice.
[00:25:31.853 --> 00:25:34.094]  He's been doing marathon interviews today.
[00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:37.176]  People are coming up to Roger on the street, shaking his hand.
[00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:46.423]  He is truly, I think he was instrumental in getting Donald Trump elected for the 2016 campaign season for President of the United States.
[00:25:46.543 --> 00:25:47.643]  Tomorrow is the inauguration.
[00:25:47.944 --> 00:25:51.026]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:55.228]  Be sure you pick up your copy of The Making of a President at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:55.268 --> 00:25:55.869]  We'll see you later.
[00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.710]  This is Michael Zimmerman for InfoWars.com.
[00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.651]  We're here at the Make America Great Again welcome event the day before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.
[00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.232]  We have two protesters over here.
[00:26:06.312 --> 00:26:06.932]  Let's go talk to them.
[00:26:23.604 --> 00:26:28.605]  So, hey guys, we have thousands of people here, and then, uh... So who are you with?
[00:26:29.146 --> 00:26:30.926]  I'm not allowed to take video.
[00:26:30.946 --> 00:26:31.286]  What's that?
[00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:32.487]  I'm not allowed to take video.
[00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:33.247]  Of who?
[00:26:33.507 --> 00:26:34.287]  People out on the street?
[00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:35.267]  Sure, take video of me.
[00:26:35.287 --> 00:26:35.928]  What do you want to know?
[00:26:35.948 --> 00:26:36.328]  That's fine.
[00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:38.908]  We're just saying, we're wanting... Oh, I know, you can!
[00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:39.749]  You can take video of me!
[00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:42.349]  We're just wanting to speak with protesters out there.
[00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.870]  Sure!
[00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.850]  And, we see you're protesting too.
[00:26:46.331 --> 00:26:50.872]  Uh, sure, I'm protesting the right to a five dollar footlong for subway.
[00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:54.040]  I think that should be what we need in this world.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.500]  Yeah.
[00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:56.201]  You work for ABC?
[00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:56.901]  I do.
[00:26:57.681 --> 00:26:57.962]  Alright.
[00:26:58.722 --> 00:27:00.663]  So you're stopping us from talking to people?
[00:27:00.783 --> 00:27:02.163]  No, I'm not stopping you from talking to people.
[00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:03.324]  I'm actively talking to you.
[00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.131]  Can you stop us?
[00:27:06.251 --> 00:27:06.672]  No, I can't.
[00:27:06.732 --> 00:27:07.773]  Legally, can you stop us?
[00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.535]  No, I never said I could, but I can stand here.
[00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:10.857]  You said, I'm going to stop you.
[00:27:10.897 --> 00:27:12.559]  No, I said I'm going to stand here.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.262]  Is that because you're with ABC?
[00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:19.088]  That's because I'm... I have the right to stand here, right?
[00:27:19.148 --> 00:27:21.571]  But do you have the right to keep us from talking to someone on the street?
[00:27:21.591 --> 00:27:23.033]  No, you're not... Feel free!
[00:27:23.213 --> 00:27:23.594]  Okay, cool.
[00:27:24.014 --> 00:27:25.154]  So we're just going to scoot down over here.
[00:27:25.194 --> 00:27:28.635]  So would you like to say anything about why you're out here protesting or anything like that?
[00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:36.117]  We are against, I am against mass deportations, a Muslim registry, climate change denial, and the further corruption of finance and politics.
[00:27:37.098 --> 00:27:37.398]  Right on.
[00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:40.539]  So, there's thousands of people inside, not many out here.
[00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:43.039]  Are you all with any groups or did you just come out here on your own today?
[00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.060]  No, I'm here on my own.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:44.800]  Awesome.
[00:27:45.649 --> 00:28:06.725]  So we just we just wanted to ask a few simple questions here and you seemed really well just what I asked him all I wanted to do is ask you a question sir and you you really yeah it was a great answer I just wanted to know why y'all were out here what you're doing and you just jumped on us you're like I'm not gonna let you talk to anybody so yeah sure say that in the context of what I said I am very against the inauguration of President Donald J Trump
[00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:10.425]  Yeah, and I understand that that's a feeling that obviously a lot of people have.
[00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:17.034]  A lot of people are coming down here to DC in support of the inauguration of President Trump, but also there's going to be a record number of protesters.
[00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:21.800]  So we'll see over the next day or two how everything pans out here with the inauguration of President Donald Trump.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.102]  For more reports, go to m4wards.com.
[00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:38.858]  BroadviewReportingForAirForce.com in front of the National Archives building, which is right there.
[00:28:38.878 --> 00:28:41.899]  And I've got a guy carrying around a Trump flag.
[00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:45.840]  I wonder if this is going to elicit any response from anyone.
[00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:51.863]  So far, I haven't seen too many protesters in the area.
[00:28:51.903 --> 00:28:52.963]  There's the National Archives.
[00:28:52.983 --> 00:28:54.704]  This is a Navy memorial.
[00:28:54.764 --> 00:28:58.466]  Pretty neat looking world with some masts.
[00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:00.867]  There it is.
[00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:03.368]  I'm actually out here waiting for Roger Stone to show up.
[00:29:04.212 --> 00:29:11.239]  To go to our secret location where we have our central DC command center.
[00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:19.288]  Very deep behind enemy lines, but hopefully by tomorrow that will be different with the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[00:29:20.369 --> 00:29:21.590]  Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:29:26.034 --> 00:29:31.255]  Rob Dewey with InfoWars.com and I was showing you a video earlier of this guy with the Trump flag.
[00:29:31.275 --> 00:29:31.936]  Well here he is.
[00:29:31.976 --> 00:29:34.616]  This is Donald Trump's 45th President Inauguration.
[00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:35.997]  January 20th, 2017.
[00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:37.797]  Sir, what's your name?
[00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:38.337]  Kobe.
[00:29:38.537 --> 00:29:39.297]  Kobe, where are you from?
[00:29:39.557 --> 00:29:39.998]  Texas.
[00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:43.578]  And so tell me a little bit about the group you're here with and what are you guys doing?
[00:29:43.618 --> 00:29:44.879]  You've got to show your friends here.
[00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:50.957]  We're like in a school program called Close Up, and I came to see Trump get elected.
[00:29:51.337 --> 00:29:51.797]  And win!
[00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:52.738]  He did win!
[00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:53.398]  Inaugurated.
[00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:54.398]  Inaugurated.
[00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:54.918]  What's your name, sir?
[00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:56.438]  I'm Ray Dorda from Miami, Florida.
[00:29:56.598 --> 00:29:56.799]  Yeah?
[00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:58.959]  And why did you vote for Trump?
[00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.600]  I wasn't old enough to vote for Trump, but I probably would have.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.620]  Yeah, so you guys are all in high school?
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:03.820]  Yeah.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.160]  Yes, sir.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.541]  Okay, so what has attracted you to Trump being president?
[00:30:07.761 --> 00:30:09.122]  Why do you like, want to hear, see that?
[00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:11.762]  Because he's, he just knows success.
[00:30:11.782 --> 00:30:14.243]  He knows what has to be done in order for
[00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:17.504]  For the country to be successful and for everyone else to be successful.
[00:30:17.844 --> 00:30:21.286]  And I believe that being successful is something that everyone wants to do and be.
[00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.307]  So, I mean, it's just, it was a no-brainer.
[00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:24.488]  My family.
[00:30:24.728 --> 00:30:25.128]  What about you?
[00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:29.170]  Well, first off, I hate Hillary Clinton, so it was easy there.
[00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.171]  But I think that Trump is something new.
[00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.892]  I think that Trump is something new.
[00:30:32.952 --> 00:30:34.653]  I think that the country needed something new.
[00:30:34.673 --> 00:30:36.154]  It was just going in the same direction.
[00:30:36.214 --> 00:30:37.034]  Nothing was changing.
[00:30:37.374 --> 00:30:39.816]  And I feel like he's going to give us a step forward.
[00:30:40.698 --> 00:30:41.938]  All right, sir, you want to add anything to that?
[00:30:42.218 --> 00:30:45.119]  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna agree with my buddy there, Ray.
[00:30:45.139 --> 00:30:49.620]  Yeah, I agree with the successful part that, you know, he knows a lot about business.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:31:08.865]  And right now, the state that the country's in, I think we need somebody that's, you know, going to pick us up, pick us off our feet and, you know, bring us back to, you know, a successful, I guess, I don't know how to word it, but, you know, I just, I'm really, really excited to be here.
[00:31:08.885 --> 00:31:09.645]  You know, Trump's a,
[00:31:10.905 --> 00:31:16.509]  I was a whole household is very Republican and you know we are looking forward to this president.
[00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:21.192]  That was actually my next question did you guys are you guys all your households were they all Trump supporters?
[00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:26.275]  Every single person in my family from my grandma to my aunt to me to my mom we all voted for Trump.
[00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:32.660]  My dad actually voted for Hillary along with my mom and it was
[00:31:34.104 --> 00:31:38.408]  He's Republican, my mom's Democrat, and he just didn't like what Trump's police said for my arrest.
[00:31:38.628 --> 00:31:42.351]  I'm pretty sure the rest of my family voted for Trump though, and I would have voted for Trump if I was eligible.
[00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:43.632]  Alright, what about you?
[00:31:43.992 --> 00:31:46.094]  I was the only person that supports Trump in my family.
[00:31:47.235 --> 00:31:47.855]  That's interesting.
[00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.998]  It wasn't like that, I guess it kind of wasn't my family too.
[00:31:51.038 --> 00:31:52.219]  A lot of my family voted for Hillary.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.862]  Has anybody messed with you guys for wearing your Trump gears?
[00:31:56.062 --> 00:31:56.363]  Oh yeah.
[00:31:57.063 --> 00:31:57.744]  What's that been like?
[00:31:57.944 --> 00:31:59.906]  Previously, we were just sitting here in a couple of
[00:32:01.264 --> 00:32:08.850]  I would say liberals came in on their bikes and decided to harass us, calling us, just saying bad words.
[00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:11.092]  Now, have you been harassing anyone since you've been here?
[00:32:11.132 --> 00:32:11.773]  Absolutely not, no.
[00:32:12.454 --> 00:32:16.577]  I apparently are apparel defense people, but it's not my problem.
[00:32:17.478 --> 00:32:20.862]  You know I don't like the shirts people wear all the time and I don't go harass them.
[00:32:21.002 --> 00:32:21.843]  Have you been harassed too?
[00:32:21.943 --> 00:32:29.532]  Yeah these guys came up on a bike and then I called them out because they were calling us out told me to stand up I stood up and they rode away so typical liberal.
[00:32:32.575 --> 00:32:33.276]  There you go.
[00:32:33.296 --> 00:32:34.236]  That's how I found it, too.
[00:32:34.256 --> 00:32:36.297]  Whenever you stand up to these people, they do back down.
[00:32:36.618 --> 00:32:38.579]  They are kind of afraid of confrontation.
[00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:41.100]  That's why if they do attack you, it'll be from behind.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.562]  So watch your back while you're out there, guys, and enjoy the day.
[00:32:43.602 --> 00:32:47.444]  Tomorrow, it's been Rob Dewey reporting in front of the National Archives in Washington, D.C.
[00:32:47.825 --> 00:32:51.707]  Tomorrow is the inauguration of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States.
[00:32:51.747 --> 00:32:53.488]  Can I get a Make America Great Again on three?
[00:32:53.708 --> 00:32:54.429]  One, two, three.
[00:32:54.449 --> 00:32:57.631]  Make America Great Again!
[00:32:57.671 --> 00:32:57.751]  Woo!
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:03.586]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.207 --> 00:33:07.914]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.729]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:31.567]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.

[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:59.372]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.

[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[00:37:04.564 --> 00:37:12.489]  In a grand display of arrogance, the growing number of Democrats boycotting the inauguration has reached 61.
[00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:14.530]  The inauguration's not about Republicans.
[00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.670]  It's not about Donald Trump.
[00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.991]  The inauguration's about America.
[00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:18.972]  Why would you abandon America?
[00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:26.683]  Well, if you're a member of Congress, if you work that hard to get to be part of the system... Yeah, but Newt, they're trying to score political points.
[00:37:27.324 --> 00:37:29.866]  Yeah, but all they're doing is making themselves look small and silly.
[00:37:30.006 --> 00:37:35.270]  I'm just trying to tell you about things that this new president, who you disagree with, has said and ask you if you agree or not.
[00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:43.236]  So he says, and I'm quoting, "...will empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of infrastructure."
[00:37:43.616 --> 00:37:44.137]  Are you against that?
[00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:48.753]  I'm not getting, I just did to you earlier, that was for infrastructure.
[00:37:48.773 --> 00:37:49.893]  I stated that clearly up front.
[00:37:49.913 --> 00:37:53.335]  More for financial reform to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit.
[00:37:53.435 --> 00:37:54.436]  Probably for that too, I would think.
[00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:54.876]  Right?
[00:37:55.716 --> 00:37:57.517]  Well, hey, I'm open for that too.
[00:37:58.098 --> 00:37:58.438]  There you go.
[00:37:58.478 --> 00:38:00.319]  Look, I'm not, I'm not here to say Trump's going to do all this.
[00:38:00.339 --> 00:38:01.259]  I'm not here to say Trump's great.
[00:38:01.299 --> 00:38:05.121]  I'm merely here to say, you're just telling me you want to find common ground.
[00:38:05.602 --> 00:38:07.883]  You haven't bothered to read what the guy has said.
[00:38:08.463 --> 00:38:11.365]  I'm throwing some things at you and suggesting that maybe you've got more in common than you think.
[00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:32.818]  And to add to that monumental hubris and poor sportsmanship of the failed Democratic Party, in an unprecedented report, Mockingbird Media's right arm, CNN, ominously toyed with the idea of the possibility of a major catastrophic event, or at the very least, Donald Trump's assassination during the inauguration.
[00:38:33.078 --> 00:38:46.027]  Tonight, due to a quirk in America's rules for succession, questions remain about just who would be in charge if an attack hit the incoming president, vice president, and congressional leaders just as the transfer of power is underway.
[00:38:46.228 --> 00:38:51.491]  Adding to the confusion, by noon Friday, all of Obama's cabinet secretaries are expected to resign.
[00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:54.934]  So far, the protesters have made good on their threats.
[00:38:55.294 --> 00:39:04.917]  As an LGBTQ dance party was in full swing in front of Vice President-elect Mike Pence's Chevy Chase residence as promised.
[00:39:05.197 --> 00:39:06.998]  We are here and we will dance.
[00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:14.620]  Protesters are being bused in for a day of complete chaos and have promised terroristic level disturbances.
[00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:22.223]  Beginning with the gassing of the Deplorable tonight before the inauguration and the disruption of the metro rail system.
[00:39:22.503 --> 00:39:28.551]  Yeah, if you had a frickin' pint of butyric acid, I don't care how big the building is, it's closed and it's staying closed for a long time.
[00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:29.372]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.775]  Um, and this stuff is, like, it's very efficient.
[00:39:31.915 --> 00:39:36.041]  It's very, very smelly, it lasts a long time, and a little of it goes a long way.
[00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:39.205]  If you were repeating the original smell, you could use...
[00:39:39.946 --> 00:39:41.087]  We're good to go.
[00:39:57.108 --> 00:39:58.649]  Um, the train's pulled up.
[00:39:58.809 --> 00:40:03.891]  One person's going to just walk right into the train as a true bitch.
[00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:07.293]  And on the other end of the platform, walk along the door.
[00:40:07.333 --> 00:40:07.693]  Darn.
[00:40:07.773 --> 00:40:13.115]  It takes 15 seconds, and everyone can leave, because literally, you can't go anywhere.
[00:40:13.155 --> 00:40:14.476]  You can't go anywhere.
[00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:17.497]  It's inked, and you're in a really thin chain.
[00:40:17.637 --> 00:40:19.138]  You're in a really thin chain.
[00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:26.941]  So sorry the Trump administration never existed.
[00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:30.945]  It's gonna have to be people Obama appoints.
[00:40:31.746 --> 00:40:37.572]  And it turns out Obama has people designated waiting at a facility outside of
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:50.888]  The District of Columbia, at Site R out in Maryland, and then also out in Colorado, in Colorado Springs, they've got the new government just waiting.
[00:40:51.508 --> 00:40:58.733]  It hadn't even been activated in a long time, but magically for this inauguration it's been activated and the people are in the bunkers.
[00:40:59.134 --> 00:41:00.615]  Is this a little bit suspicious?
[00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:11.811]  With the activation of the continuity of government in place, all that remains is for the events leading to the coup of a Donald Trump presidency to begin firing.
[00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:13.992]  You can't win, Darth.
[00:41:14.852 --> 00:41:20.953]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:41:21.053 --> 00:41:22.994]  John Bowne, for InfoPiece.com
[00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:36.911]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:44.994]  As you can see, we have Trump Tower behind me, and there are many levels of barricades actually protecting Donald Trump.
[00:41:45.354 --> 00:41:52.037]  I'm honored to be standing with my Make America Great Again hat in front of Trump Tower, Donald Trump's home.
[00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:58.860]  We know that he will be traveling on a regular basis between New York and his home at the White House.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.081]  And as you can see, through the press corral,
[00:42:02.501 --> 00:42:03.663]  The free speech zone.
[00:42:04.624 --> 00:42:07.927]  There is a huge amount of police here.
[00:42:07.967 --> 00:42:10.911]  There's a huge police presence here at Trump Tower.
[00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:16.898]  One of the representatives of the New York Police Department, the NYPD,
[00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:24.801]  John Miller said that this actually protecting Trump presents an unprecedented challenge.
[00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:35.745]  They've never seen anything like it in the history of New York City to have to protect a president-elect and a president soon to be inaugurated in New York City.
[00:42:36.505 --> 00:42:42.093]  One is securing the President of the United States when he's in New York, or right now the President-elect.
[00:42:42.714 --> 00:42:49.564]  And the other is doing it on what could be a very regular basis at what we consider practically the center of the Earth.
[00:42:50.325 --> 00:43:00.514]  He has said Donald Trump has vowed that he will travel on a regular basis between New York City and the White House to his home here in Trump Tower.
[00:43:00.854 --> 00:43:05.438]  You're not even allowed to walk on that side of the street unless you're specifically going to Trump Tower.
[00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:12.784]  You see there's reporters for fake news just gathered here at all times, I guess of the day and night, I don't know.
[00:43:14.145 --> 00:43:15.546]  Create some fake news about him.
[00:43:15.806 --> 00:43:17.187]  Just waiting for Trump.
[00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:20.548]  Just waiting to see what will happen with his presidency.
[00:43:20.568 --> 00:43:27.111]  Are you doing a documentary?
[00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.413]  No, I'm reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:33.254]  Are you familiar with InfoWars.com?
[00:43:33.855 --> 00:43:34.795]  Alex Jones Show?
[00:43:35.636 --> 00:43:37.376]  Oh, you must have heard of Alex Jones, no?
[00:43:38.097 --> 00:43:38.517]  Okay.
[00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:40.018]  Bye, NBC.
[00:43:41.112 --> 00:43:48.775]  Yes, this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the massacre at Aurora, Colorado were actually fake.
[00:43:49.115 --> 00:43:56.538]  They were faked as an excuse to take away our guns and enslave us to the giant wasps who hive beneath the UN building or whatever.
[00:43:56.839 --> 00:43:59.180]  It's the same guy who says the Boston bombing was also fake.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.020]  It was faked for political purposes.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.902]  The same guy who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster actually happened.
[00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:07.363]  He doesn't believe there was actually an Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:22.418]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube... well, he has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube, and that sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply, I think, racist strain is being tapped into.
[00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:24.560]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.183]  And I wasn't hurt that they called me names myself.
[00:44:27.243 --> 00:44:28.944]  I was hurt that they were so evil.
[00:44:29.775 --> 00:44:40.183]  That they were such a pack of willful crooks preying on America with their trendy, non-threatening voices and ironic glasses.
[00:44:40.764 --> 00:44:44.607]  All meant by PSYOP generals to annihilate this country!
[00:44:45.908 --> 00:44:48.450]  Alright, NBC has never heard of Infowars.
[00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.452]  Of course, they're fake news, so it's not very surprising.
[00:44:52.052 --> 00:44:52.513]  Makes sense.
[00:44:54.451 --> 00:45:04.255]  Here outside of Trump Tower you can see the high police presence here and all the barricades just cutting off the streets to protect Donald Trump.
[00:45:04.335 --> 00:45:07.676]  And here we have a long shot of the tower.
[00:45:08.317 --> 00:45:08.917]  It's huge!
[00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:16.137]  So there you have it.
[00:45:16.177 --> 00:45:17.978]  We have a ton of security barriers.
[00:45:18.058 --> 00:45:21.960]  We have a ton of different ways that he's going to be protected.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.362]  You have tons of NYPD officers.
[00:45:25.462 --> 00:45:37.528]  Even though they said this is an unprecedented challenge to protect Donald Trump, I believe that they will make it their mission to make sure that Trump stays safe and they will succeed so that he can make America great again.
[00:45:37.548 --> 00:45:42.411]  Unfortunately, you've grown up
[00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:51.817]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:45:52.137 --> 00:45:54.399]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:56.640]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:45:57.261 --> 00:46:00.043]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:46:01.564 --> 00:46:04.286]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:46:04.446 --> 00:46:08.048]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:10.130]  Everything that's been done
[00:46:11.325 --> 00:46:27.838]  With torture, mendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:29.660]  That's it.
[00:46:30.811 --> 00:46:39.333]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:43.834]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:46:44.194 --> 00:46:52.776]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:55.197]  This is all about converting us
[00:46:55.737 --> 00:47:01.274]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:02.290]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:11.625]  Well, we are less than 24 hours away from Donald Trump becoming the 45th president of the United States of America.
[00:49:11.705 --> 00:49:15.866]  And now we're also hearing that he is going to get right to work.
[00:49:15.966 --> 00:49:21.587]  In fact, he may sign as many as 200 executive orders on the third day in office.
[00:49:22.147 --> 00:49:25.688]  So I guess he is kind of taking a note from his predecessor there.
[00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:30.990]  So these executive orders are going to be targeting a wide range of Obama administration policies.
[00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:32.610]  This includes
[00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:33.330]  Yes.
[00:49:48.604 --> 00:49:48.664]  Yes.
[00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.991]  We're good to go.
[00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:44.428]  It literally lit a pile of trash on fire.
[00:50:44.448 --> 00:50:45.449]  It was the cover of Drudge.
[00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:54.215]  And there seems to be a fear circulating among the shadow community of immigrants that are not documented to race and make sure that they make it to the border beforehand.
[00:50:54.255 --> 00:51:02.742]  Now, countering that, undocumented workers, we have these mass sanctuary cities here in America, Chicago being one, San Francisco, even New York City.
[00:51:03.242 --> 00:51:06.865]  And there was an article up at the New York Times that specified that people
[00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:27.576]  Sanctuary cities that are soft on immigration are getting advice, namely from the ACLU, to make sure that their policies that are illegal and they don't comply with what the American will wants, that they stay intact and they can sort of operate under the guise that they are, you know, these sanctuary communities that are already abiding within legal communities, which they are not, by the way.
[00:51:27.636 --> 00:51:31.398]  They are totally illegal and they are not in line with what the American people want.
[00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:41.180]  These undocumented immigrants, for example, are seeking a means of legal avenue, if you will, to make sure that they can stay in the country and work.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:53.904]  I want to point out, Leanne, I was looking at the numbers earlier, the number two source of income for Mexico, namely, is remittance, which means that they're taking money illegally from our community and putting it into theirs.
[00:51:54.304 --> 00:51:57.885]  Regardless of how you feel, compassion or otherwise, this is a legal issue.
[00:51:57.905 --> 00:51:59.165]  You promised to tackle it.
[00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:01.646]  And I'm hopeful that he will tackle it.
[00:52:01.686 --> 00:52:02.766]  You mentioned the third day.
[00:52:03.066 --> 00:52:08.588]  He promised to start signing those orders the first day he's in office, and I suspect that this will be one of them.
[00:52:08.868 --> 00:52:09.068]  Right.
[00:52:09.588 --> 00:52:19.652]  And so people are kind of pointing out, and especially we know how the media just loves Donald Trump, and of course they're going to want to continue fomenting this fear that a lot of undocumented immigrants have.
[00:52:19.972 --> 00:52:35.311]  So we're going to expect to see a lot of imagery of workplace raids and people being deported and just sort of this imagery that's going to really foment a lot of people's fears and this unrest and this people kind of protesting Donald Trump saying, not my president.
[00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:36.072]  Right now.
[00:52:36.212 --> 00:52:38.254]  And also we have a lot of people getting
[00:52:38.835 --> 00:52:47.201]  Quite bold in the way that they're standing up to enforce these sanctuary cities and say, you're not going to take this away from our city.
[00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:48.662]  We are going to remain a sanctuary city.
[00:52:49.042 --> 00:52:50.303]  We actually have video.
[00:52:50.323 --> 00:52:56.907]  There was a Hispanic activist in Rialto, California, talking there to a group of people.
[00:52:57.127 --> 00:53:00.650]  And he was in a room full with some older white folks.
[00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.972]  And he was like, look, you guys are not from here.
[00:53:04.072 --> 00:53:06.193]  And frankly, you got about five years left.
[00:53:06.293 --> 00:53:07.654]  So your opinion doesn't matter.
[00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:08.595]  Let's take a listen.
[00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:11.558]  White people were the minority.
[00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:19.144]  The reality is that Black and Latinos are the majority of the city, and that is representative of the city, right?
[00:53:19.244 --> 00:53:22.467]  And that's going to continue to be the case in the future generations.
[00:53:23.528 --> 00:53:25.230]  And we've got to talk about the future, right?
[00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:31.475]  I mean, it's kind of mean for me to say it, but these people have probably like five years left, and you know... Wow.
[00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:39.252]  So here he is telling these white people, you're the minority here, your opinion doesn't matter.
[00:53:39.652 --> 00:53:47.696]  Obviously, if the shoe was on the other foot, and you would have had a community with majority white people telling the minorities there, your opinion doesn't matter in this community.
[00:53:48.057 --> 00:53:49.977]  There would be total outrage.
[00:53:50.578 --> 00:53:54.040]  But here, you know, it's this Make America Mexico Again mentality.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:10.190]  There are maps within that article that show how the America is kind of becoming Mexico again slowly but surely based on a lot of these border, I'm sorry, sanctuary city policies and you're kind of seeing it creep up.
[00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:11.331]  You're absolutely right.
[00:54:11.351 --> 00:54:12.811]  So what we're seeing is, and you know what?
[00:54:12.911 --> 00:54:14.913]  I don't care what color you are, frankly.
[00:54:14.993 --> 00:54:18.154]  If you're black, yellow, white, or brown, I don't care.
[00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:22.437]  This is a legal issue here and we're talking about, you know, a sovereign nation.
[00:54:22.517 --> 00:54:23.577]  We are a sovereign nation.
[00:54:23.657 --> 00:54:25.058]  And I love Mexico.
[00:54:25.078 --> 00:54:26.179]  I love the Mexican people.
[00:54:26.479 --> 00:54:27.440]  This is not about that.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.980]  This is not a hit piece by any means.
[00:54:29.021 --> 00:54:36.805]  This is about respecting the sovereignty of a nation and coming in a process that is legal and making sure that our economy, you know,
[00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:40.749]  I was looking at my tax forms two days ago and talking to our HR lady.
[00:54:40.769 --> 00:54:44.413]  You know, we are really paying the brunt of this illegal immigration issue.
[00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:47.216]  And it's small town, local communities that are doing it.
[00:54:47.537 --> 00:54:52.763]  We're talking about our educational structure, our healthcare system, our roads, in every possible way.
[00:54:53.143 --> 00:54:58.227]  Our policing and our jails, everything about us suffers because of this illegal immigration issue.
[00:54:58.247 --> 00:55:04.611]  And I think that Trump's position reflects, well, we know that it reflects the counted vote of 65 million.
[00:55:04.911 --> 00:55:09.254]  The estimated vote is 72 million people actually agree with him on this issue.
[00:55:09.755 --> 00:55:11.176]  And he's promised to tackle it.
[00:55:11.216 --> 00:55:14.398]  And look, again, this is not a race issue.
[00:55:14.438 --> 00:55:16.479]  This is not a, you know, a Hispanic issue.
[00:55:16.499 --> 00:55:17.320]  This is an issue of
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.885]  Securing the border, making sure that our communities thrive, and people coming through a process legally.
[00:55:22.925 --> 00:55:27.189]  We've had this issue at the forefront for at least 18 years in this country.
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:29.631]  I've been covering it for the last three and a half myself.
[00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:31.432]  It's a very exhaustive issue.
[00:55:31.512 --> 00:55:33.214]  Obama, he promised to do a lot of things.
[00:55:33.494 --> 00:55:40.240]  The only thing that he really did was create these jails, if you will, where people are held for a long time without due process.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.401]  It doesn't serve anybody.
[00:55:41.741 --> 00:55:44.083]  We finally have a person at the helm willing to tackle it.
[00:55:44.824 --> 00:55:50.788]  And the fact that this is a fear-based issue, we need to take it out of emotion and start looking at it from a legal perspective.
[00:55:51.308 --> 00:55:57.412]  And frankly, this undocumented worker issue, we've got these sanctuary cities that are not complying with federal law.
[00:55:57.472 --> 00:56:03.676]  Now it's up to him to make sure that they actually begin to comply with the issue at hand, which is they have a president to answer to.
[00:56:03.716 --> 00:56:04.717]  We all do, frankly.
[00:56:05.297 --> 00:56:06.858]  And he promised to tackle it, Leigh-Anne.
[00:56:06.998 --> 00:56:08.179]  I'm confident that he will.
[00:56:08.219 --> 00:56:09.600]  Forgive my soapbox, by the way.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.541]  This is an important issue to me.
[00:56:11.841 --> 00:56:14.104]  Yeah, people need to start getting passionate about it.
[00:56:14.144 --> 00:56:23.073]  And of course, he has talked a lot about cutting federal funding for cities that are continuing to be sanctuary cities in violation of federal law.
[00:56:23.733 --> 00:56:27.237]  But here's just one scenario of how this is going to be an issue.
[00:56:27.677 --> 00:56:28.118]  We're good to go.
[00:56:46.621 --> 00:56:55.944]  Typically, the federal law requires that they do, but if you're in a sanctuary city, the police are not allowed to turn people who are here illegally over to U.S.
[00:56:55.984 --> 00:57:14.590]  immigration authorities, but I guess they went ahead and did it anyway, and so now he is suing the city of San Francisco, which this is kind of in line with what you were talking about, the ACLU and other groups actively working with people to teach them how to file lawsuits like this and working on their behalf.
[00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:23.237]  Right, and not only that, but I want to talk on the tax issue for a moment because I pay about 36% of my income in taxes and I'm really sick and tired of it.
[00:57:23.737 --> 00:57:27.940]  And frankly, we're talking about an economic issue here, an IRS issue.
[00:57:28.881 --> 00:57:35.006]  We want to see people step out of the shadows and become legal, law-abiding citizens of this nation that contribute to the economy, contribute to the wealth.
[00:57:35.606 --> 00:57:38.609]  And there's a new era of prosperity that's coming to the U.S.
[00:57:38.649 --> 00:57:40.250]  I firmly believe that in the next eight years.
[00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:43.933]  We want to see this field be part of that economic prosperity.
[00:57:44.274 --> 00:57:47.957]  But at the same time, we have to secure our border or we aren't a nation.
[00:57:48.037 --> 00:57:49.098]  It's pure and simple.
[00:57:49.118 --> 00:57:51.520]  These aren't racial issues at all here.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.201]  This is purely a legal issue.
[00:57:53.221 --> 00:58:03.010]  And going back to what you were saying for a moment about the sanctuary cities and the five years left, I want to highlight that article because this is not, this alt-left Mexican supremacist
[00:58:03.811 --> 00:58:07.195]  You know, first of all, who are you to comment, frankly?
[00:58:07.235 --> 00:58:12.161]  Because there has to be standing, legally speaking, to be able to talk on these legal matters.
[00:58:12.321 --> 00:58:14.003]  And frankly, you know what?
[00:58:14.584 --> 00:58:15.726]  I'm very confident.
[00:58:15.746 --> 00:58:19.631]  I've been looking at videos all day long of Washington, D.C., of Trump on the ground.
[00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:21.113]  He's currently at the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:58:22.094 --> 00:58:29.461]  We firmly believe this man has a heart for this nation, and we want to see the nation thrive, and that includes people that also have a heart for this nation.
[00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:36.367]  And I firmly believe that the 13 to 15 million people that are here in this country, I want to believe that the majority do have a heart for this nation, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:36.908]  They really do.
[00:58:37.128 --> 00:58:37.348]  Right.
[00:58:37.468 --> 00:58:38.710]  Well, in the case, of course, of this...
[00:58:40.774 --> 00:58:44.537]  This guy was making was that the Constitution is for all people worldwide.
[00:58:44.677 --> 00:58:46.719]  It's the law of the land for the whole globe.
[00:58:46.759 --> 00:58:49.161]  So it fits for everyone, which I wish that was the case.
[00:58:49.321 --> 00:58:50.282]  But you know, it's not.
[00:58:50.903 --> 00:58:53.465]  Well, Margaret, thank you so much for that passionate plea there.
[00:58:53.505 --> 00:58:54.926]  And thank you all so much for tuning in.

[00:59:01.352 --> 00:59:01.652]  See you then.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
