[00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:50.684]  The official death of the establishment media is finally here and incoming President Donald Trump says his administration will make it a routine to bypass the dinosaur mainstream media in 2017 and make public policy announcements directly on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
[00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:56.808]  Then, Rand Paul wants you to know where ISIS gets its weapons.
[00:00:58.703 --> 00:01:03.967]  And the Washington Post wants Donald Trump to stop reading InfoWars.
[00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:17.876]  He will stay on message for seven days and then all of a sudden three in the morning he reads InfoWars and you know it sends off a tweet and goes off and then everyone has to go to the family and say can you get him back on the wagon?
[00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:22.759]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:08.784]  Well, one of the big questions on everyone's mind is, will Donald Trump continue to use social media when he becomes the president?
[00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:10.526]  And the answer is yes.
[00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:16.710]  Indeed, he's going to be going around the establishment media, going directly to the people via his social media accounts.
[00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.853]  And of course, the establishment media is shaking in their boots.
[00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:22.595]  They've become even more obsolete.
[00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:27.758]  He is going to be making public policy announcements directly on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
[00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.880]  The fact of the matter is, when he tweets, he gets results.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.061]  He's got 45 plus million people following him on all of his social media accounts.
[00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:38.942]  He doesn't need to go through the mainstream media channels.
[00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:51.045]  And in fact, this unprecedented move is designed to limit the mainstream media's role as an information filter by reaching the American people directly through social media.
[00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:52.926]  So this is unprecedented.
[00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:57.427]  Here we have the establishment going, well, how in the world are we going to be able to filter and control the news?
[00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:58.928]  Perfect example.
[00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:03.351]  Let's walk it back a little bit to September 30th.
[00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:15.000]  The New York Times issued this bombshell report about this leaked audio revealing what Secretary of State John Kerry was telling Syrians behind closed doors.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.722]  Ooh, you're thinking, wow, this is going to be really good.
[00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:19.423]  We're going to get something juicy here.
[00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:25.268]  What John Kerry was telling the Syrians behind closed doors wasn't different than what he was telling the American people.
[00:04:25.988 --> 00:04:35.058]  And it goes on to say, you know, he complained to the small group of Syrian civilians that his diplomacy had not been backed by a serious threat of military force.
[00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:44.789]  He was frustrated with his inability to end the Syrian crisis, you know, and they actually go the extra step there and take out these audio clips.
[00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.975]  In this article, basically allowing you to see the juiciest details of this leaked audio, and frankly, none of it's really that juicy at all.
[00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:01.418]  Well, fast forward to today, and WorldNetDaily has got the
[00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:11.757]  The full leaked audio, it's actually coming out of conservative Treehouse blog, it featured portions of Kerry's statements that wasn't featured in the New York Times.
[00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:18.201]  In fact, this was much juicier than John Kerry being frustrated over his inability to stop the Syrian crisis.
[00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:26.387]  This is actually the fact that Kerry was announcing that regime change was Obama's only objective in Syria.
[00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:32.291]  And in fact, the administration not only hoped that ISIS would carry out the task,
[00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.532]  It gave arms to the jihadist army and its allies.
[00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:41.934]  So here, indeed, Donald Trump is being made fun of by calling Obama and Hillary Clinton the founders of ISIS.
[00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:45.516]  Here, in this leaked audio, they are admitting that, indeed.
[00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:50.057]  And you weren't getting that from the hacks at the New York Times.
[00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:55.739]  It's just like when CNN tried to put out that narrative that it was illegal to go and look at the WikiLeaks.
[00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.900]  Only they could tell you what was in WikiLeaks.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.121]  And I'm sure we would have gotten to the bottom
[00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.247]  Of all the juiciest details, if we would have just allowed CNN to filter through our news.
[00:06:04.628 --> 00:06:07.773]  But let's take a listen to what you weren't allowed to hear.
[00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:08.926]  U.S.
[00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:15.749]  counterterrorism officials asking why are ISIS fighters driving so many similar trucks and where are they getting them from?
[00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:20.531]  Hillary Clinton has described already the meeting in the White House over two years ago.
[00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:25.273]  Everyone in the national security team recommended arming ISIS.
[00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:31.876]  You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis and you were arguing against it.
[00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:32.856]  But who wasn't listening?
[00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.737]  I think the administration.
[00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:37.778]  But what we're trying to do is help.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.641]  Syrians can fight for their own country.
[00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:45.903]  And we've been spending a lot of money and a lot of effort to try to help do this.
[00:06:47.604 --> 00:06:50.345]  So, there's an opposition there.
[00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:51.786]  The opposition is doing very well.
[00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:55.428]  And if they're not serious, then we will help the opposition more.
[00:06:56.587 --> 00:07:04.415]  Intelligence officials in Pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist network Islamic State has admitted receiving funds transferred via the U.S.
[00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:06.517]  He made the confession while being interrogated.
[00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:13.844]  Today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:15.746]  I don't think it was a willful decision.
[00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:19.491]  A willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:21.834]  Right, a willful decision to do what they're doing.
[00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:27.420]  Which you have to really ask the President, what is it that he actually is doing?
[00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:35.459]  As I've said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly, but the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:44.189]  So with the additional steps I ordered last month, we're speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar province.
[00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.769]  Now U.S.
[00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:49.451]  military aircraft have dropped ammunition in areas held by ISIL terror group in Iraq.
[00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:57.855]  According to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists, American helicopters dropped boxes of weapons in Yathrib and Balad districts in the Salahuddin province.
[00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:08.059]  In the last eight years, Obama completely sold us out to the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians and others, and launched a program all over the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, Far Asia, you name it.
[00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:10.260]  We saw that Daesh was growing in strength.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.800]  And we thought Assad was left.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.941]  We thought, however, we could probably
[00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:48.964]  Now, the public didn't know what was going on, but our military did.
[00:08:49.664 --> 00:08:52.405]  They began five years ago, and Sy Hersh has now broken this.
[00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:54.967]  Last year, we first broke it, but he confirmed it all.
[00:08:54.987 --> 00:08:58.769]  We had the direct sources from NATO, from the CIA.
[00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:01.410]  I mean, from low level and high level, we had it from every angle.
[00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.752]  When you cross him, he's going to fight you to the end.
[00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:04.813]  It's a war to the end.
[00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:06.796]  He's fighting ISIS.
[00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:08.217]  He's fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:09.278]  He's fighting Al-Nusra.
[00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:11.341]  These are people that hang in garages.
[00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:12.782]  Some of the horrible stuff that happens.
[00:09:13.102 --> 00:09:17.447]  He's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people.
[00:09:17.487 --> 00:09:19.109]  So, our Joint Chiefs
[00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:20.413]  We're good.
[00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:50.113]  Some of the groups we advocate as moderate have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government, no Christians or Alawites as a minority sect.
[00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:57.264]  She asked that Bashar Assad and about 12% of the people living in Syria belong to.
[00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:00.167]  None of them could be allowed to live in the country.
[00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:04.771]  They were talking about genocidal, you know, genocidal cleaning.
[00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:11.097]  After Libya fell, we began to funnel stuff that in an earlier article I called the rat line.
[00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:20.362]  A lot of arms from Libya into Turkey, and from Turkey, the gentleman running Turkey, Erdogan, is a total, complete supporter of ISIS.
[00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:23.024]  I don't think there's any question of that, even though we deny that.
[00:10:23.384 --> 00:10:24.525]  Our intelligence soldiers.
[00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:29.368]  What I wrote about is the fact that two and a half years ago, the Joint Chiefs decided, well,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.363]  They can't convince the White House and the State Department with intelligence.
[00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:36.524]  They're just going to begin to do what they can do.
[00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:40.187]  So the Russians basically came into Syria because the U.S.
[00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:46.611]  military said, we're telling Obama if he doesn't back off, we're going to release the fact that we know they've been funding him, giving him missiles, you name it.
[00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.052]  Benghazi was the last straw.
[00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:50.173]  Russia said, OK, we're going to come in.
[00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:51.214]  Trump is right.
[00:10:51.494 --> 00:10:53.956]  Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS.
[00:10:53.976 --> 00:10:57.038]  They founded it because it's really Al Qaeda to confuse the name.
[00:10:57.258 --> 00:11:09.007]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.549]  Obama as the leader of ISIS.
[00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:14.251]  ISIS is honoring
[00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:16.515]  President Obama.
[00:11:38.104 --> 00:11:40.025]  Leaving out the part where the U.S.
[00:11:40.305 --> 00:11:49.648]  is now arming and funding these terrorist groups, these so-called moderate rebels, which you're only really hearing about at InfoWars and, you know, Breitbart sites like this.
[00:11:49.768 --> 00:11:50.148]  That's right.
[00:11:50.328 --> 00:12:00.391]  And it was the New York Times that went through and selectively pulled things out of this so-called off-the-record discussion that he was having with people from Syria.
[00:12:00.711 --> 00:12:01.211]  But you know what?
[00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:03.292]  This is 2017.
[00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:06.013]  Things are not going to be off the record, Leigh-Anne.
[00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:11.156]  Julian Assange saying you're going to see a lot more in 2017 from WikiLeaks than you did in 2016.
[00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:13.577]  We're going to put them on the record.
[00:12:13.637 --> 00:12:22.423]  These people's Machiavellian machinations that they're doing to create unrest, to create regime change, to set the Middle East on fire.
[00:12:22.523 --> 00:12:23.764]  This is now being exposed.
[00:12:23.804 --> 00:12:24.804]  People are going on the record.
[00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:25.925]  They're blowing the whistle on them.
[00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:28.607]  One of the reasons I believe that Barack Obama
[00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:29.367]  We're
[00:12:44.787 --> 00:12:44.987]  That's
[00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:04.324]  And that's what we've been saying all along.
[00:13:04.344 --> 00:13:09.888]  They're willing to create ISIS no matter what the consequences, so that they could overthrow Assad.
[00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:13.571]  And this goes back several years to the ones that were laid out.
[00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:16.873]  We had these seven nations that they were going to go through and overthrow these nations.
[00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:26.060]  But this is like Madeleine Albright saying when she was asked, was it worth the death of a half million kids to achieve this objective, these sanctions that you put against Iraq?
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.881]  Oh yeah, it was worth it.
[00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:29.842]  And that's the cold-blooded calculation that they're doing.
[00:13:29.882 --> 00:13:43.686]  So as we see this heart-wrenching situation with the Aleppo boy, with all these people who are displaced and now being flooded into Europe, understand this was the deliberate policy of Obama, of Clinton, of Kerry.
[00:13:44.046 --> 00:13:52.849]  This is a cold-blooded ruthlessness, a creation of this regime that would create these executions and broadcast them on social media.
[00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:56.950]  This was what they wanted, and now this is being exposed.
[00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:07.136]  Right, and of course what we're being shown here by the establishment media with Aleppo is we're not being shown the people actually celebrating and that they want for things to get back to normal.
[00:14:07.156 --> 00:14:09.738]  They're celebrating even President Assad.
[00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:16.783]  Not saying that he's a great guy, but better than all of these different proxy armies coming in trying to overthrow their government there.
[00:14:17.243 --> 00:14:24.948]  These people have been under attack for many years now and we're not, we're only seeing the side of the story that fits the agenda with the current administration.
[00:14:25.168 --> 00:14:32.149]  Well, we've been saying at Infowars that ISIS was the surrogate of the CIA and of the neocon warmongering establishment.
[00:14:32.229 --> 00:14:35.050]  And now what we're seeing also is it's not just the Democrats.
[00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:41.451]  But when you look at this conservative treehouse story, they show pictures of McMullen, not just McCain.
[00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:50.573]  We know, we talked a great deal about McCain meeting with the Al-Qaeda rebels and they were saying, oh, they're moderates, they're not Al-Qaeda, they're something different.
[00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:52.074]  No, they are Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:52.114 --> 00:14:54.294]  They eventually outed themselves as Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:54.714 --> 00:15:00.699]  But then there were these other characters who became very well known in just the last few months as Never Trumpers.
[00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.681]  People like McMullen that they tried to use in Utah.
[00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:04.702]  They thought it was going to be close.
[00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:10.047]  They could block Trump from getting an electoral college majority by using Evan McMullen in Utah.
[00:15:10.447 --> 00:15:13.469]  He was there meeting with the rebels just like McCain.
[00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.811]  And this is something that at Infowars we talked about in 2013.
[00:15:16.412 --> 00:15:20.415]  Remember we had the soldiers and sailors saying we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:28.966]  They were trying to sell this false narrative that only the Syrian government could have created this sarin gas attack, therefore we needed to get involved in the war.
[00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:30.147]  Same thing we're seeing now.
[00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:36.936]  Only the Russians could have revealed this true information about Hillary Clinton that cost her the election.
[00:15:37.697 --> 00:15:38.718]  We fought against that.
[00:15:38.798 --> 00:15:40.220]  We made that clear.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.964]  And then, of course, we had international organizations say, no, it didn't have to be Syria.
[00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:45.265]  We had Russia saying that.
[00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:46.606]  And eventually, U.S.
[00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:48.488]  intelligence said the same thing.
[00:15:48.528 --> 00:15:49.589]  And now we're seeing that.
[00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:56.817]  We've got good people in the military, good people in intelligence coming out, and they're going to put these people on the record and expose what they've done.
[00:15:57.017 --> 00:16:20.105]  Right and of course you know we had Rand Paul and and his father Ron Paul coming out saying look where ISIS is getting its weapons from they've got billions of dollars worth of US Humvees cash they stole from the from the US to pay their soldiers we have the video where there's just a long line of these ISIS soldiers and we're all thinking well if there was ever a time to take them out that would have been it how'd you get this footage of them but but now we see
[00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:24.889]  We can show the footage of that, but we can't do anything to take them out in their Toyota trucks as they're carrying weapons around.
[00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:32.975]  The JV team has somehow outsmarted us, and then here, lo and behold, they're wanting ISIS to grow, thinking that they're going to be the proxy army of the U.S.
[00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:37.178]  to complete their job, their agenda of regime change there in Syria.
[00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:52.802]  Just like you said, you know, here we are, InfoWars, talking about this in 2013, very unpopularly, because you have a sarin gas attack and there's all this footage with these young children, you know, going through the throes of this chemical attack.
[00:16:53.383 --> 00:16:57.183]  And we're saying, wait a minute, this is all of the evidence here of a false flag.
[00:16:57.243 --> 00:17:01.404]  And so very unpopular at the time, but it was necessary.
[00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:05.725]  And frankly, I think it stopped us going to war with Syria officially.
[00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:06.486]  I believe so.
[00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:09.867]  They're parachuting weapons down.
[00:17:10.047 --> 00:17:10.467]  Right.
[00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:12.327]  As well as not attacking them.
[00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:20.790]  And we had testimony from some news organizations reported that you had a Chechen rebel leader saying, hey, we were fighting the Russians as Islamists.
[00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.771]  They told us, hey, the action is over here in Syria.
[00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:23.951]  The CIA brought us in.
[00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:24.751]  They trained us.
[00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:25.391]  They equipped us.
[00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:26.652]  We see this over and over again.
[00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:29.353]  Dropping it down with parachutes or pulling back and giving it to them.
[00:17:29.373 --> 00:17:33.654]  As if the military would accidentally drop them weapons many times that we are aware of.
[00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:34.194]  That's right.
[00:17:54.124 --> 00:17:54.545]  Hold that there.
[00:17:54.805 --> 00:17:55.846]  Invite incursions.
[00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:56.807]  What did we do?
[00:17:57.308 --> 00:17:58.710]  We invited incursions.
[00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:04.857]  They are trying to push a new escalated Cold War and sanctions and doing it with a fake news story.
[00:18:05.298 --> 00:18:12.947]  At the time he was saying that about InfoWars, it was the Washington Post that was pushing this fake story about the cyber hack of the US power grid.
[00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:13.888]  Totally false.
[00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:14.388]  That's right.
[00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:15.970]  Talk about catastrophic for the nation.
[00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:24.137]  You're putting out fake news that could potentially launch World War 3 and get a bunch of people in a panic thinking that the Russians are hacking our grid.
[00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:24.998]  The grid's going down.
[00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:26.319]  Everyone's going to go hide in their bunker.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.520]  And that's the difference.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.185]  They create the fake news that gets millions of people killed, that starts World War 3.
[00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:33.586]  And tanks markets.
[00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:35.026]  Yes, exactly.
[00:18:35.607 --> 00:18:41.751]  And, you know, just like you said, Julian Assange has come out once again saying, we've told you again and again and again, it was not the Russians.
[00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.853]  We did not receive any of this information from the Russians.
[00:18:45.173 --> 00:18:48.855]  But he did say, prepare if you thought 2016 was a big deal.
[00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.518]  2017 is going to be a showdown.
[00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.179]  They say the information coming is going to blow you away.
[00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:56.720]  So you know what?
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.703]  I think that that's really the good news here is that there's nowhere to hide.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.

[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.

[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:23:03.595 --> 00:23:04.255]  Could the U.S.
[00:23:04.455 --> 00:23:09.357]  aviation industry be involved in a large-scale cover-up involving asbestos?
[00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:10.497]  There's an article up.
[00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:13.998]  It was sent by our nightly news director, Rob Dew, insisting someone cover it.
[00:23:14.478 --> 00:23:17.039]  I am more than happy to cover this, as I'm a frequent flyer.
[00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:19.040]  I traveled this weekend over the New Year holiday.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.380]  I felt lethargic.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.441]  My head was hurting.
[00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:30.923]  And when I read this Asbestos of the Sky, the aviation industry's darkest cover-up, and it goes into how the air might be killing you, in fact.
[00:23:31.604 --> 00:23:35.985]  Essentially, this problem comes from the need to supply the jetliners with warm, compressed air.
[00:23:36.525 --> 00:23:37.145]  We're good to go.
[00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:19.437]  And it's a neurotoxin that affects the human brain, which goes hand-in-hand with this article that he also sent regarding these American Airlines flight attendants that were treated at a Florida hospital after complaining of a foul odor in the plane and saying that all of them had headaches and that there was a really strange smell coming out of the ventilation system.
[00:24:20.057 --> 00:24:24.558]  Also an incident out of Southwest Airlines, there was a plane flying from San Antonio, Texas to Orlando.
[00:24:25.325 --> 00:24:35.553]  It actually made an emergency landing after the oxygen masks fell from the ceiling and it was determined that the plane was in fact diverted because of an air issue.
[00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:39.876]  Also an American Airbus with 89 people on it and crew.
[00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:41.578]  They actually landed safely.
[00:24:41.818 --> 00:24:45.521]  Also an emergency landing and medical personnel checked out the crew members.
[00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:47.382]  Also involving air.
[00:24:47.462 --> 00:24:54.308]  So it looks like the airlines knowingly, potentially knowingly, allegedly knowingly,
[00:24:54.928 --> 00:24:57.671]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:25:19.716 --> 00:25:28.443]  I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies.
[00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:34.228]  Now, it is no secret that the President-elect and I have some pretty significant differences.
[00:25:34.557 --> 00:25:36.619]  Citing hacking and harassment of U.S.
[00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:43.305]  diplomats, Obama ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russians in a move that surprised even seasoned observers.
[00:25:43.506 --> 00:25:54.516]  This expulsion of 35 diplomats, the closure of two compounds run by the Russian Foreign Ministry here in the United States in some very, very tough language, is a rather remarkable development.
[00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.097]  This is a dangerous time.
[00:25:56.177 --> 00:26:07.764]  All I'm saying is pray, call Congress, call talk radio, whatever you got to do, just make a big noise and say, listen Soros and Obama, you start a war, buddy, we blame you!
[00:26:08.445 --> 00:26:09.646]  What do you make of all this?
[00:26:09.686 --> 00:26:10.686]  I mean, where are we going?
[00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:11.987]  How do we stop this?
[00:26:12.007 --> 00:26:16.130]  Because they are so afraid that we might get a president who just isn't out to get us.
[00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.832]  They're going to do everything they can to try to stop it.
[00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:21.914]  Go to USA Today the day after Trump won.
[00:26:22.755 --> 00:26:25.562]  The headline read to the words to the effect
[00:26:26.172 --> 00:26:31.055]  It was a day or two after that he's going into office with 70-something lawsuits.
[00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:39.739]  Rather than praising that we have a new president, as they did when Obama won, or any president wins, it's been constant attacks.
[00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.301]  As I said to you, you remember, go back.
[00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:44.422]  The first thing was they were going to do a recount.
[00:26:45.022 --> 00:26:48.624]  Second, they were going to influence the Electoral College.
[00:26:48.664 --> 00:26:50.765]  That took up weeks of the media.
[00:26:50.885 --> 00:26:51.826]  It's brainwashing.
[00:26:52.126 --> 00:26:55.548]  But I really want to stay on this because it's very important, the brainwashing.
[00:26:55.808 --> 00:27:01.853]  Days after this Russian hack of power plants is discredited and retracted, they got huevos saying it's still ongoing.
[00:27:02.293 --> 00:27:02.874]  Exactly.
[00:27:02.894 --> 00:27:06.957]  So they're lying, and they keep it lying because here's the deal.
[00:27:07.437 --> 00:27:11.661]  Trump didn't only beat Clinton, he beat Obama.
[00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:12.682]  We talked about this.
[00:27:13.062 --> 00:27:16.344]  He beat Obama, they lost the Senate, and they lost the House.
[00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:20.508]  They lost a bunch of governors and 900 plus House seats in the States.
[00:27:21.138 --> 00:27:21.799]  Exactly.
[00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:25.022]  So it was a reflection on Obama's legacy.
[00:27:25.042 --> 00:27:28.025]  He beat Silicon Valley.
[00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:34.552]  They had the best algorithms, they had the best of everything working for Clinton, as WikiLeaks showed us with Jeff Schmidt.
[00:27:34.932 --> 00:27:36.634]  And he also beat Hollywood.
[00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:50.988]  He beat the Katzenbergs, the Spielbergs, he beat the Cloonies, he beat the Eros, he beat the entertainment industry, he beat Beyonce, he beat Jay-Z, he beat the mainstream media, he beat all of them.
[00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:55.873]  That's why they're crying like babies and trying to do everything to stop him.
[00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:56.614]  And I agree.
[00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:58.916]  They may be crazy enough to do anything.
[00:27:58.936 --> 00:27:59.496]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:27:59.796 --> 00:28:00.457]  Who stops them?
[00:28:00.477 --> 00:28:02.298]  Because I know the intelligence agencies aren't perfect.
[00:28:02.498 --> 00:28:04.080]  They're against Obama and Hillary.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.241]  I mean, I hope they understand.
[00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:06.802]  I've been told by high-level sources, Gerald.
[00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:07.783]  I mean, high-level.
[00:28:08.283 --> 00:28:10.085]  Army, CIA, you name it.
[00:28:10.425 --> 00:28:14.869]  If they keep pushing, they're going to release damaging information that makes WikiLeaks look tame.
[00:28:15.229 --> 00:28:22.095]  I would also suggest that the people that Trump's brought in, particularly the military people, they've been brought in for a reason.
[00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:26.001]  Because they can see what's going on and they anticipated this.
[00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:26.822]  You're dead on.
[00:28:26.862 --> 00:28:28.323]  They are in fortress mode.
[00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:30.904]  Trump's looking nice to the public, but they know what's going on.
[00:28:30.924 --> 00:28:33.646]  I mean, they're basically at DEFCON 2 right now.
[00:28:33.686 --> 00:28:34.787]  We're 18 days out.
[00:28:34.827 --> 00:28:38.709]  They're clearly creating an atmosphere to block Trump, to kill him, to arrest him.
[00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.191]  I mean, McCain is saying he's a Russian agent.
[00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:42.352]  He's calling for war.
[00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:44.433]  Current events form future trends.
[00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:48.416]  Tracking trends is a way of seeing where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[00:28:48.757 --> 00:28:50.458]  Let's go back to how we got here.
[00:28:50.878 --> 00:28:57.203]  Right after the election, it's been non-stop, let's hate Trump, let's try to get rid of him, he's a disgrace to America.
[00:28:57.223 --> 00:28:59.525]  I mean, so you can see where it's going.
[00:29:00.066 --> 00:29:03.428]  And now we're gonna go up to the inauguration and it's anything goes.
[00:29:03.448 --> 00:29:11.395]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:29:14.229 --> 00:29:15.789]  Well, look what time it is.
[00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:18.790]  It's time for me to say, I told you so.
[00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:24.311]  Because Barack Hussein Obama's birth certificate is a total fraud.
[00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:29.412]  It is, without a doubt, an illegal forged document.
[00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:36.134]  And before you start calling me a birther, or a conspiracy theorist, or say that this is fake news,
[00:29:36.894 --> 00:29:37.774]  Let me prove it to you.
[00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:39.375]  All right, this will only take a few minutes.
[00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:40.916]  I say we have some fun with this.
[00:29:41.636 --> 00:29:45.078]  And I promise this is going to be very, very interesting, so check it out.
[00:29:45.518 --> 00:29:52.501]  And for those of you out there who think anyone who questions Obama's birth certificate, well, that we should be wearing tinfoil hats.
[00:29:53.001 --> 00:30:08.048]  This is your opportunity to prove us wrong here at InfoWars, make me look like a dumbass, and finally put a nail in the coffin or finally debunk this Obama birth certificate conspiracy theory once and for all.
[00:30:08.368 --> 00:30:10.229]  So, let's get started, shall we?
[00:30:10.329 --> 00:30:10.890]  First up...
[00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:18.187]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the man in charge of the investigation, steps up to the plate.
[00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:37.079]  And I tell you what, he hit a home run last week when he held a press conference where criminal investigators made a breaking announcement about the legitimacy of the birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the ghost president of the United States.
[00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:42.207]  Every official in Hawaii, Democrat and Republican,
[00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:54.850]  Every news outlet that has investigated this confirmed that yes, in fact, I was born in Hawaii, August 4th, 1961 in Kapiolani Hospital.
[00:30:55.310 --> 00:31:00.312]  You can just see by turning it on and off, you know, there's different letters all over this that have been added into it.
[00:31:00.552 --> 00:31:07.854]  Obama's birth certificate has been proven by two leading experts in forensic fraud documentation to be a forgery.
[00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:09.655]  Mr. Hayes told me, right off the bat,
[00:31:11.089 --> 00:31:12.650]  I'm an Obama supporter.
[00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.991]  I voted for him twice.
[00:31:14.011 --> 00:31:18.615]  He goes, and I will never do anything to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:24.480]  What I had said to him was, Reid, I am not asking you to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.184]  I'm asking you to take a look at this document and clear it and tell me there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:31:31.085 --> 00:31:32.306]  Would you at least do that?
[00:31:34.027 --> 00:31:34.888]  And he took a look at it.
[00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:38.491]  And when he called me back, he told me, Mike,
[00:31:39.904 --> 00:31:41.245]  I can't clear this.
[00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:42.486]  There's something wrong with it.
[00:31:42.546 --> 00:31:59.378]  The evidence noted herein is clear and convincing proof that the Obama certificate of live birth posted on WhiteHouse.gov on April 27, 2011 is a fraudulently manufactured document.
[00:31:59.538 --> 00:32:02.280]  Were there forensic labs who refused to cooperate?
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.203]  That is like they don't want nothing to do with it and they said no way we're going to investigate this?
[00:32:06.743 --> 00:32:07.223]  Yeah, like about 200.
[00:32:11.294 --> 00:32:14.776]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:32:14.856 --> 00:32:18.237]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:32:18.297 --> 00:32:23.120]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.041]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:32:26.161 --> 00:32:32.104]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:32.304 --> 00:32:35.885]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:38.906]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:57.251]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:57.271 --> 00:32:58.632]  InfoWars.com
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.268]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:09.489]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:10.810]  I quit working out.
[00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.471]  I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:19.033]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy.
[00:33:19.073 --> 00:33:21.014]  I started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:23.215]  I started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.015]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:06.295]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.281]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.402]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:20.105]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:30.553]  And I want to invite all of the info workers of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.587]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.859]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.561]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.983]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.571]  Next week, Part 3.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.993]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product, thousands of items.
[00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:51.797]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.837 --> 00:36:56.780]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.241 --> 00:36:59.262]  And that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.602 --> 00:37:00.763]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:01.384]  You're awesome.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:24.022]  It was absolutely amazing to see that at the same time the Washington Post was selling this irresponsible lie about the Russians hacking our power supply, they were also, our power grid, they were also going on Face the Nation and talking about how dangerous Infowars and Donald Trump were.
[00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:25.764]  Truly amazing.
[00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:37.172]  And of course, as I mentioned, David Frum, the Bush neocon who never saw a war that he didn't support, wringing their hands about the fact that Donald Trump has appointed some generals.
[00:37:37.232 --> 00:37:40.595]  As I pointed out in the last segment, you know, we've had some good generals as president.
[00:37:41.223 --> 00:37:42.464]  We've had George Washington.
[00:37:42.745 --> 00:37:43.846]  We've had Andrew Jackson.
[00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:57.461]  We had Eisenhower, who warned us about the military-industrial complex, did more to stop it than any of the civilian people that we've had since then, because we've seen the military-industrial complex advancing.
[00:37:57.702 --> 00:37:59.364]  And these same people, these neocons,
[00:37:59.864 --> 00:38:08.626]  Who have supported setting the Middle East on fire so they can bring in a mass exodus of people who do not want to be a part of our culture.
[00:38:08.646 --> 00:38:09.867]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[00:38:10.247 --> 00:38:22.850]  These same people who have supported the militarization of the police and the centralization of all police control out of Washington, these same people are talking about how it's awful that Donald Trump has generals there.
[00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:28.752]  But I want to take a look at some of the details of what they said because it was very interesting.
[00:38:29.653 --> 00:38:34.679]  What the Washington Post editor said, as well as Michelle Norris of the Race Card Project.
[00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:36.421]  I couldn't believe that's what she called it.
[00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:40.365]  I don't know what the Race Card Project is, but that's basically what they're playing all the time.
[00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:45.330]  And after I talk about this, I also want to talk about what happened today with draining the swamp.
[00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:50.113]  I think Donald Trump made a huge step towards draining the swamp today.
[00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:52.115]  I was very happy to see what happened.
[00:38:52.315 --> 00:38:59.339]  We're also going to talk about how the Muslims rang in the New Year from Turkey throughout Europe as well.
[00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:06.403]  But real quickly, I want to go back to this story about the Washington Post editor who is complaining about the fact that
[00:39:06.983 --> 00:39:16.993]  Donald Trump will be on message, he says, for seven days, and all of a sudden, in the middle of the night, he reads Infowars, and he tweets some stuff out that he says can tank markets and invite incursions.
[00:39:17.914 --> 00:39:20.797]  What was the Washington Post doing at the same time?
[00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:27.544]  They were trying to start a war with Russia, saying that we've got them hacking our power grid.
[00:39:28.823 --> 00:39:38.110]  Underscoring the phony narrative that they've been pushing for Obama all of this time, that the Russians have been doing everything, saying we need to have sanctions, we need to take some actions.
[00:39:38.611 --> 00:39:44.576]  This is the irresponsible behavior of the Washington Post at the same time they're complaining about InfoWars.
[00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:45.917]  And of course, at that time...
[00:39:46.477 --> 00:39:47.418]  We were exposing it.
[00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:50.460]  We had a great story right away from Mikhail Vailin at InfoWars.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:57.985]  Then we had this woman from the Race Card Project talking about how bad it was that they didn't have control of the media.
[00:39:58.005 --> 00:39:59.606]  And I want to read you this quote that she said.
[00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:06.090]  She says, as journalists, we have to learn how to operate in a world where there is no longer a common set of facts.
[00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:07.411]  Think about that.
[00:40:07.611 --> 00:40:08.112]  What's she saying?
[00:40:08.812 --> 00:40:11.833]  She's not really saying that you've got your facts, I've got my facts.
[00:40:11.893 --> 00:40:12.073]  No.
[00:40:12.553 --> 00:40:13.914]  There's one set of facts, folks.
[00:40:13.974 --> 00:40:17.755]  People can have opinions, and we can argue about that in the free market of ideas.
[00:40:18.255 --> 00:40:20.716]  But see, they didn't have a free market of ideas.
[00:40:21.196 --> 00:40:25.277]  I grew up in a time where we had ABC, CBS, NBC, and NPR, and that was it.
[00:40:25.897 --> 00:40:28.838]  And they were all reading off of a government script.
[00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:30.886]  They all cover the same stories.
[00:40:31.247 --> 00:40:33.549]  They all have the same take on the same stories.
[00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.733]  They never question the government's official story.
[00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:39.155]  Never question it, no matter how absurd it was.
[00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:45.602]  If you questioned it, if you questioned the magic bullet that killed JFK, then you were a conspiracy theorist.
[00:40:46.283 --> 00:40:47.264]  That's where that came from.
[00:40:47.624 --> 00:40:56.290]  That was to shut down any questioning of the common set of facts that were coming out of our common government propaganda.
[00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:57.691]  So that's what they don't like.
[00:40:57.711 --> 00:41:00.534]  They don't like the fact that they don't control the agenda.
[00:41:00.554 --> 00:41:04.076]  That's what she's talking about when she says there's no more common facts.
[00:41:04.096 --> 00:41:10.341]  Then she goes on and says, people get their news in such a way that it usually affirms or confirms everything they already believe.
[00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:14.064]  Now the phrase for that is a confirmation bias.
[00:41:15.017 --> 00:41:20.540]  See, they say, you've got a bias, and you're going to be drawn to news that confirms your bias.
[00:41:20.881 --> 00:41:23.362]  And I would say, well, what about your bias?
[00:41:23.883 --> 00:41:26.404]  What about the bias of the race card project?
[00:41:26.764 --> 00:41:29.746]  What about the bias of the Washington Post or the New York Times?
[00:41:30.447 --> 00:41:32.048]  You see, they have a bias as well.
[00:41:33.063 --> 00:41:34.004]  There's two types of people.
[00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.888]  Those who acknowledge their bias and those who don't.
[00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:44.155]  And they are deceiving either themselves or you when they don't acknowledge their bias.
[00:41:44.415 --> 00:41:48.019]  They're biased in terms of what they even choose to report on.
[00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:49.541]  That reflects your own personal bias.
[00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:50.802]  What you think is important.
[00:41:50.822 --> 00:41:51.963]  What you don't think is important.
[00:41:51.983 --> 00:41:52.684]  What you agree with.
[00:41:52.724 --> 00:41:54.726]  What you totally reject out of hand.
[00:41:55.347 --> 00:42:08.615]  And I'm telling you, we are better positioned at Infowars to fight the Washington Post and the New York Times because they have existed in an environment for a very long time where no one questioned their pronouncements.
[00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:11.517]  China is going to be the big enemy, folks.
[00:42:11.957 --> 00:42:12.898]  You can mark your words.
[00:42:12.938 --> 00:42:17.561]  That's why Obama is trying to start a war right now with Russia.
[00:42:18.709 --> 00:42:26.695]  And folks, this news is so big, so out of control, so real, that I don't feel like I'm doing any of this justice.
[00:42:27.395 --> 00:42:28.416]  I know you feel the same way.
[00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:45.928]  I mean, we're sitting here, those of us that are politically engaged, politically informed, those of us that care, those of us that know about the different geopolitical systems, and Pakistan and India are threatening to kill each other and having missile tests, and North Korea is more out of control than ever, with some snot-nosed crazy person running it, Kim Jong-un.
[00:42:46.328 --> 00:42:48.070]  I see the same arrogance in Obama's eyes.
[00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.853]  Another threat that President Obama mentioned was ISIS.
[00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:54.935]  Well, who on earth armed them?
[00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:58.518]  Who helped to arm the Syrians that were fighting against Assad?
[00:42:58.878 --> 00:43:03.001]  Who created the necessary political climate that facilitated the situation?
[00:43:03.942 --> 00:43:06.624]  Who pushed for the delivery of arms to the area?
[00:43:07.865 --> 00:43:10.988]  Do you really not understand as to who is fighting in Syria?
[00:43:11.348 --> 00:43:14.729]  They're clearly shooting down Russian aircraft using their proxy armies.
[00:43:15.089 --> 00:43:15.950]  Service to air missiles.
[00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:17.970]  They're clearly killing their ambassadors.
[00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:23.772]  And Obama says they're about to retaliate against Russia for the imaginary hacking, which they admit wasn't physical.
[00:43:24.032 --> 00:43:26.933]  They say Russian propaganda affected the U.S.
[00:43:27.393 --> 00:43:28.474]  I was banned off RT.
[00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:33.358]  Four years ago, because they had their license in the U.S.
[00:43:33.438 --> 00:43:36.660]  threatened by the State Department, and I told you all that.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.844]  People are like, oh yeah, right Alex, like the State Department's involved in what you're doing on air.
[00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:43.886]  Notice my name is named by Hillary.
[00:43:44.306 --> 00:43:48.670]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.311]  I'm named by the President.
[00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:51.852]  I'm named in Congress.
[00:43:52.552 --> 00:43:54.214]  They signed a law Friday night.
[00:43:54.694 --> 00:44:02.701]  Saying they're gonna put the Board of Governors of the FCC under the control of the Defense Department, the State Department, and the CIA, and they're coming after Drudge, Breitbart, and InfoWars.
[00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:04.583]  They're talking about banning the President off Twitter.
[00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.745]  This is serious business, folks.
[00:44:06.985 --> 00:44:08.146]  I don't just say these things.
[00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:13.410]  I didn't even care when I went on RT, but they've said, we can't have you anymore, this is off-record, we've been threatened.
[00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:18.315]  They've been involved for a long time, claiming Russia's involved domestically.
[00:44:19.693 --> 00:44:22.255]  When Russia has almost no footprint here politically.
[00:44:22.335 --> 00:44:25.418]  I mean, they've got one of the weakest propaganda corps in the world.
[00:44:26.378 --> 00:44:28.360]  China's got tens of thousands of front companies.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.102]  Their propaganda is in every big movie you see, folks.
[00:44:31.603 --> 00:44:34.445]  A close second, Saudi Arabia involved in our politics.
[00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:38.688]  The Pope, the Vatican, with all the millions of Catholics being told to vote against Trump.
[00:44:39.769 --> 00:44:45.093]  This was crazy foreign multinational intervention against Americans trying to get Americana back.
[00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:49.237]  And we were all told it was our fault.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:45:02.979]  And that we were Russian agents and now, Washington Post, the big propaganda organ, Obama administration is close to announcing measures to punish Russia for election interference.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:10.043]  The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election.
[00:45:10.243 --> 00:45:11.444]  It's not just being stated as facts.
[00:45:11.484 --> 00:45:17.987]  See, kind of like Obamacare is free, and 2 plus 2 equals whatever they say, and you didn't build your business, and nobody wants your guns.
[00:45:18.528 --> 00:45:20.529]  See, the media has gone from lying to pure lying.
[00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:31.294]  The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U.S.
[00:45:31.334 --> 00:45:31.735]  officials.
[00:45:32.585 --> 00:45:41.614]  The administration is finalizing the details which are expected to include covert action that will probably invoke cyber operations, involve cyber operations, the official said.
[00:45:41.634 --> 00:45:46.218]  An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week.
[00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:50.722]  They are going to openly start turning the power off in Russia, folks.
[00:45:51.403 --> 00:45:56.586]  And they've got it embedded in chips worldwide, and starting a war ahead of Trump getting in.
[00:45:56.726 --> 00:46:03.090]  And Russia's sitting there with their planes being shot down, their diplomats being killed, their ambassadors being killed, just being punched in the face.
[00:46:04.991 --> 00:46:05.471]  Gonna do something?
[00:46:05.651 --> 00:46:05.731]  Boom!
[00:46:05.751 --> 00:46:06.392]  Gonna do something?
[00:46:06.432 --> 00:46:06.852]  Gonna do something?
[00:46:07.072 --> 00:46:07.512]  Gonna do something?
[00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:20.900]  Russia's just sitting there with its country on the verge of collapse, infiltrators all over the place, all these countries surrounding it with jihad attacks, and just sitting there taking it, racing, waiting for Trump to get in, hoping he takes the foot off Russia's neck.
[00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.671]  They're going to shoot down more planes in the next 22 days.
[00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:26.632]  They're going to launch, they're going to kill more ambassadors.
[00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:30.194]  They're going to, and I guess Russia's going to probably start killing NATO people.
[00:46:32.335 --> 00:46:35.536]  It's NATO and the globalists and the EU that have hijacked America.
[00:46:35.857 --> 00:46:36.917]  Russia understands the players.
[00:46:37.697 --> 00:46:43.180]  You go on national Russian TV, the people that advise Putin are on there explaining the whole thing, they get it completely.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.361]  And US intelligence gets what's happening.
[00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:49.323]  We've been hijacked by a multinational combine that wants to get us into a war with Russia.
[00:46:49.763 --> 00:46:51.344]  That sold us out to Communist China.
[00:46:56.516 --> 00:46:58.621]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:47:03.044 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:49:08.709 --> 00:49:10.550]  Owen Schroyer for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:19.093]  I'm joined in the studio by Maggie Howell, and fake news is now a narrative that has become a household name around America and even around the world.
[00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:29.177]  Now, the recent development comes after Ray Dalio, a chairman and chief investment officer at Bridgewater Associates LP, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world,
[00:49:29.597 --> 00:49:36.239]  wrote a little piece on LinkedIn, the fake and distorted news epidemic and Bridgewater's recent experience with the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:43.382]  Now, before I get into the nuts and bolts about his piece that he wrote, I'm curious, Maggie, do you think this is more of the Trump effect?
[00:49:43.422 --> 00:49:47.223]  Do you think that Dalio writes this piece outside of the Trump movement?
[00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:47.743]  I don't.
[00:49:47.763 --> 00:49:56.212]  I think that a lot of people have felt this way for a very long time, but fear of recrimination gets them to their core and they've never been able to speak out like they have now.
[00:49:56.652 --> 00:50:00.255]  Look, we are under the illusion that we have a free press in this nation.
[00:50:00.295 --> 00:50:00.696]  We don't.
[00:50:01.897 --> 00:50:08.323]  We're seeing these professional journalists that actually control a narrative and they have a major agenda that's being exposed.
[00:50:09.044 --> 00:50:09.685]  I love this!
[00:50:09.705 --> 00:50:10.766]  We've got a hedge fund manager.
[00:50:10.826 --> 00:50:11.206]  Who knew?
[00:50:11.246 --> 00:50:12.107]  I thought all these guys were
[00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:15.150]  You know, liberal or financing and didn't really care.
[00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.671]  It turns out they've got great opinions.
[00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:18.053]  He's a classic example.
[00:50:18.453 --> 00:50:21.436]  My assumption is that they're more of him just like this.
[00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:27.141]  You want to say something, but that fear factor as they express it privately, but they never come out and say it publicly.
[00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:27.482]  He did.
[00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:35.596]  And it is interesting how those of us who have put the glasses on are starting to kind of see who's on our side, who's not, who's clueless.
[00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:46.425]  But just to get into what he wrote, I'm quoting from his piece here, I just recently read the Wall Street Journal's article about Bridgewater and was surprised by its intentional distortions.
[00:50:46.885 --> 00:50:51.349]  This is not just a fringe media problem, it is a mainstream media problem.
[00:50:51.389 --> 00:50:54.031]  There is no discussion underway about how to rectify it.
[00:50:54.511 --> 00:51:05.258]  Well, I would say that you rectify it by doing the research yourself, deciding for yourself who is trustworthy, who's not, or just for yourself what's real and what's not.
[00:51:05.358 --> 00:51:08.400]  And of course we know who the real fake news is.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:17.966]  He goes on, the Associated Press said that only 6% of Americans surveyed have a lot of trust in media, and a Gallup study showed that Americans' trust in media has dropped to an all-time low.
[00:51:18.006 --> 00:51:18.967]  That's what you're talking about.
[00:51:19.087 --> 00:51:20.509]  Gee, I wonder why.
[00:51:20.609 --> 00:51:24.675]  Maybe it's because they're all lying to you and we're finally fed up with it.
[00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:28.139]  You know, I don't know if you noticed this CNN piece that's circulating on Twitter.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:33.727]  There's actually a CNN journalist, a professional journalist, getting his ear pierced on national television.
[00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:36.889]  That's apparently news.
[00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:39.150]  Meanwhile, this man hits it on the head.
[00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.551]  He talks about the confluence of reality as being dangerous.
[00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:42.791]  I could not agree with him more.
[00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:43.612]  It is dangerous.
[00:51:43.652 --> 00:51:45.272]  That's the name of Milo's new book.
[00:51:45.432 --> 00:51:46.973]  This is dangerous stuff.
[00:51:47.013 --> 00:51:47.713]  It's distorted.
[00:51:49.294 --> 00:51:51.335]  It's what the globalists want, frankly.
[00:51:51.355 --> 00:51:54.216]  And we get to beat the hell and pierce a little bit of this.
[00:51:54.276 --> 00:51:56.357]  And it's frankly really satisfying.
[00:51:56.377 --> 00:51:56.797]  I like it.
[00:51:56.957 --> 00:52:00.600]  Wait, pierced like some journalists get their ears pierced on live television?
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.621]  No, I digress.
[00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:08.748]  He goes on, the failure to rectify this problem is due to there not being any systematic checks on the news media quality.
[00:52:09.188 --> 00:52:13.492]  I would actually say that the real problem here is that people have lost
[00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:21.495]  Consciousness, and they cannot actually decide or decipher what's propaganda, what's real and what's fake, or they just don't care.
[00:52:21.535 --> 00:52:23.236]  But I think that this is something we're starting to see.
[00:52:23.276 --> 00:52:30.059]  He says, I am compelled to say what many people have expressed privately, like you're saying, the quality of news media is declining.
[00:52:30.399 --> 00:52:32.500]  Those in the news media have an enormous amount of power.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:37.141]  The news industry is unique in not having its standards of behavior specified or overseen.
[00:52:37.181 --> 00:52:40.883]  Well, now we're starting to see this, or at least what we see the government want to do with this.
[00:52:41.503 --> 00:52:44.486]  And this confluence of realities is dangerous.
[00:52:44.546 --> 00:52:45.486]  This is what we've been saying.
[00:52:45.526 --> 00:52:50.010]  The mainstream media is one of the most dangerous things going because of the propaganda and the power it has.
[00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.450]  That's right.
[00:52:50.891 --> 00:52:53.453]  And we know that you brought some real news stories of the day.
[00:52:53.513 --> 00:52:57.736]  They involve businesses, business development, the wall, for example.
[00:52:57.776 --> 00:53:02.420]  And we've seen the mainstream media come out and say, look, Trump's not going to, you know, he's not going to be a job creator.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.701]  They attack him, they pummel him.
[00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:04.462]  You know what?
[00:53:04.562 --> 00:53:06.203]  He has already started to create a nice
[00:53:06.763 --> 00:53:08.365]  Yeah, companies are coming back.
[00:53:08.405 --> 00:53:11.809]  There was a company in Ohio, a Chinese company, they manufacture glass.
[00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:15.814]  You know, in the millions and millions of dollars they're investing in jobs in Ohio.
[00:53:16.114 --> 00:53:17.075]  Anna, you've got a story.
[00:53:17.155 --> 00:53:18.757]  I couldn't believe this one when I read it.
[00:53:18.817 --> 00:53:20.579]  It's like, is this honestly happening?
[00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:22.381]  Are we getting to this now or did you want to go to something else?
[00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:41.075]  Well here's the thing, and you're talking about the Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan, CEO cites Trump policies, and we've had many cases of this now with companies either keeping some manufacturing in America, not building a plant overseas, deciding to keep it in America, so Trump has already cashed in on that.
[00:53:41.935 --> 00:53:45.097]  But you know, the other thing about this here, before we move on to the wall,
[00:53:46.178 --> 00:53:46.458]  Yes.
[00:54:05.578 --> 00:54:13.323]  So now he is influencing these companies to stay in America, but also he's making a big story out of it.
[00:54:13.403 --> 00:54:14.664]  He's pushing it on Twitter.
[00:54:14.984 --> 00:54:16.365]  The media is picking it up.
[00:54:16.745 --> 00:54:21.008]  So now the CEO of Fox goes, or the CEO of Ford goes on Fox, does an interview.
[00:54:21.288 --> 00:54:22.549]  The Ford logos are in the background.
[00:54:22.569 --> 00:54:23.470]  He's talking about his company.
[00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.312]  Now all of a sudden there's this new sort of like
[00:54:27.112 --> 00:54:34.118]  You know, organic marketing where it's like, all of these companies are going to start getting this recognition because they're keeping their manufacturing in America.
[00:54:34.178 --> 00:54:35.799]  Oh, and we know that he's pro-growth.
[00:54:35.859 --> 00:54:38.941]  His pro-growth policies are, you know, nothing new to us.
[00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:40.002]  But you mentioned this.
[00:54:40.102 --> 00:54:41.163]  It was a brilliant strategy.
[00:54:41.243 --> 00:54:44.946]  Bypasses the gatekeepers, the mainstream media, professional journalists.
[00:54:44.966 --> 00:54:47.108]  He's bypassed all of them, effectively.
[00:54:47.308 --> 00:54:48.128]  This is how he won.
[00:54:48.169 --> 00:54:49.389]  He took to Twitter and won.
[00:54:49.409 --> 00:54:50.670]  You know, he was criticized for it.
[00:54:51.071 --> 00:54:53.633]  And Rosie O'Donnell really slammed him repeatedly.
[00:54:53.933 --> 00:54:56.534]  I mean, weirdos like that, but he did it effectively.
[00:54:56.554 --> 00:55:03.595]  And look, this Ford CEO, he actually had to come to the forefront of mainstream media because of Trump's tweeting.
[00:55:03.615 --> 00:55:04.556]  That's amazing.
[00:55:05.076 --> 00:55:07.476]  And again, now people are looking at Ford.
[00:55:08.136 --> 00:55:10.037]  Maybe they're thinking about getting a Ford car.
[00:55:10.117 --> 00:55:10.357]  True.
[00:55:10.377 --> 00:55:13.358]  Ford Tough in America, not built in Mexico.
[00:55:13.438 --> 00:55:14.798]  What a novel idea right there.
[00:55:14.858 --> 00:55:16.778]  Speaking of Mexico, I love this story.
[00:55:17.499 --> 00:55:18.819]  You know, we heard a lot of naysayers.
[00:55:18.859 --> 00:55:20.459]  Trump's not going to really build a wall.
[00:55:20.479 --> 00:55:23.000]  It's going to be a virtual wall, like a virtual reality game.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.302]  More like a drone style.
[00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.004]  That's simply not true.
[00:55:27.064 --> 00:55:28.926]  This is in Reuters, if you can believe it.
[00:55:29.566 --> 00:55:34.071]  Trump's team is seeking agency records on border barriers and surveillance.
[00:55:34.772 --> 00:55:45.543]  And these documents, they're talking about the transition team and DHS and how they're assessing what they can do in terms of building a border wall and barrier construction.
[00:55:45.563 --> 00:55:46.104]  This is new.
[00:55:46.744 --> 00:55:46.844]  And
[00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:05.380]  That's the most basic thing you can do at the border to protect your country.
[00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:07.762]  I don't think anyone should deny that.
[00:56:08.522 --> 00:56:09.382]  But it's interesting.
[00:56:09.402 --> 00:56:11.463]  There's this other story that came across today.
[00:56:11.863 --> 00:56:17.006]  Obama releases 220 illegal alien kids per day as border crisis escalates.
[00:56:17.486 --> 00:56:29.952]  Over a 30-day period, the Obama administration processed and turned loose an astonishing 6,623 non-citizen children who'd recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully, averaging more than 220 per day.
[00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:37.358]  I think the question moving forward is, especially if Trump does end up building the wall, is this going to stop this?
[00:56:37.458 --> 00:56:38.519]  Is this going to stop the drugs?
[00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:49.991]  Now, if he doesn't have, now we'll talk about Ryan who got sworn in today, if he doesn't have Congress in the house with him, if he has people that are trying to go around him and keep these things going, the wall's not going to help.
[00:56:50.071 --> 00:56:53.194]  He needs cooperation to really maintain border policy.
[00:56:53.234 --> 00:56:58.557]  He needs lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get their hands out of their pockets and do something about this issue.
[00:56:58.837 --> 00:57:00.598]  You know, the DREAM Act, not effective.
[00:57:00.618 --> 00:57:03.880]  All these ridiculous blanket-type policies, not effective.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.803]  You mentioned these kids, and you and I have talked about this at length on InfoWars.
[00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.223]  I know Alex has talked about it.
[00:57:09.484 --> 00:57:11.665]  We've got a major crisis going on in this country.
[00:57:12.065 --> 00:57:12.305]  I think?
[00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:47.647]  Well, Trump wants to be the President of the United States, not the President of non-citizens of the United States.
[00:57:47.707 --> 00:57:52.790]  Now, Paul Ryan was sworn in today, and this story is from Bloomberg.
[00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.711]  Ryan re-elected Speaker as he tries to forge peace with Trump.
[00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:57.672]  Now, you know, he's batted heads with Trump.
[00:57:57.692 --> 00:57:59.392]  He's agreed with Trump, but he was sworn in today.
[00:57:59.712 --> 00:58:00.673]  It was a nice speech.
[00:58:00.773 --> 00:58:01.453]  It was unifying.
[00:58:01.493 --> 00:58:03.474]  He even mentioned coming back to self-government.
[00:58:03.794 --> 00:58:08.296]  So, I say that I'm going to give Paul Ryan a chance as the Majority House Speaker.
[00:58:08.356 --> 00:58:18.481]  That's really big of you, but if you recall right before the election, it was rumored that he was leading a coup to expose Trump with this tape regarding Pussygate, if you will.
[00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:22.483]  I actually appreciated Chuck Schumer because we know where he stands.
[00:58:22.523 --> 00:58:23.944]  He comes out of the gate and slams Trump.
[00:58:24.004 --> 00:58:25.024]  At least you know where he stands.
[00:58:25.044 --> 00:58:31.368]  With Paul Ryan, you're like, you kind of are a Republican, but I'm not really sure because you kind of seem like a saboteur.
[00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:37.871]  Anyway, speaking of Trump detractors, Owen does this amazing impression of Donald Trump.
[00:58:38.551 --> 00:58:43.315]  And we're running out of time, but I would love for you to do it for our lovely audience listening.
[00:58:43.335 --> 00:58:44.776]  It's Rosie O'Donnell, folks.
[00:58:44.836 --> 00:58:46.658]  Nobody cares about Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:58:47.038 --> 00:58:52.823]  She needs to go back to SeaWorld where she belongs, and that's where she can entertain the audience, over there at SeaWorld.
[00:58:52.843 --> 00:58:58.127]  So Rosie O'Donnell, I suggest you stay off Twitter and keep it right here, folks, at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
