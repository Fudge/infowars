[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.790]  Total fact.
[00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.373]  The next generation would be justified in looking back at us and asking, what were you thinking?
[00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:05.714]  Couldn't you hear what the scientists were saying?
[00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.975]  Couldn't you hear what Mother Nature was screaming at you?
[00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:13.260]  But studies by scientists, astrophysicists, you name it, prove humans don't even affect 1% of it.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.824]  And Al Gore and his global corporate carbon taxes are absolutely not the solution to save us.
[00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:25.670]  From Paramount Classics comes a film that has shocked audiences everywhere they've seen it.
[00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.290]  I am Al Gore.
[00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.534]  I used to be the next president of the United States.
[00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.413]  In 2006, Al Gore put out the film An Inconvenient Truth.
[00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:48.978]  Now in 2017, An Inconvenient Truth Part 2 is set to hit screens across the world.
[00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.623]  We are about to fully debunk his previous film and, of course, his current film.
[00:00:55.923 --> 00:01:01.247]  And we've also gotten a synopsis, a spoiler sneak peek, of what's in the film.
[00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.649]  And, of course, we have the trailer here for review.
[00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:22.029]  An Inconvenient Load of Manure Part 2 by Mr. Gore sets him up as the savior of the world and someone who is on a pedestal above the people who must be listened to like he is Jesus Christ or Moses speaking from the mountaintop.
[00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:36.812]  Throughout the new sequel, we are treated to fawning minions literally holding his hand and crying in joy that they have met the Christ-like figure, the archetypal savior of the world.
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:50.514]  The film begins as our guru, Al Gore, leads us through what's happening in the world and his attempts to save it, and how the evil antichrist, Donald Trump, has come to overheat the planet and kill us all.
[00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:54.985]  It's supposed to be 70 degrees today, it's freezing here!
[00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:59.509]  Speaking of global warming, where is We Need Some Global Warming?
[00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.611]  It's freezing!
[00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:11.219]  Gore tells us in that down-home Tennessee accent that this is our home, this is Earth, and we've hit the peak of human development.
[00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.122]  We're not gonna get on rocket ships and fly to Mars.
[00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:19.566]  Don't let anybody tell you that we're gonna get on rocket ships and live on Mars.
[00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.800]  This is our home.
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.501]  The film is decidedly anti-America.
[00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:34.406]  We're shown how the world has unanimously come together through the UN and Al Gore to save the planet from evil carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:38.168]  But only the evil America and Donald Trump stands in the way.
[00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:48.918]  The truth is, India, China, Mexico and over 150 other countries are exempt from the carbon taxes that Europe, Australia and the United States are under.
[00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:54.303]  So of course they have dirty burning coal, they have all these other systems with no regulations.
[00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.127]  Of course they want more regulations on us so they can shut us down.
[00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:00.288]  And that's what this is really all about.
[00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:07.834]  The carbon taxes were developed in the 1980s by then-Senator Al Gore and Ken Lay of Enron fame.
[00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:10.956]  A way to tax the carbon cycle on the planet.
[00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:14.738]  People know oxygen's good, they know sunlight's good, they know water's good.
[00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:20.943]  But the fourth part, carbon dioxide has a scary sounding name, like carbon monoxide.
[00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:23.705]  So this life-giving trace gas,
[00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:28.430]  That's at the lowest level it's ever been recorded on this planet is demonized.
[00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.297]  And then if we pay carbon taxes to Al Gore's carbon trading company, we'll all be saved.
[00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:45.149]  And of course, just like Obamacare, all the major companies like General Electric are exempt from the regulations, shutting down their competitors.
[00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:56.035]  After the devil Donald Trump is introduced to us in the film, we then see Al Gore telling you that he made a prediction that lower Manhattan would be flooded by a hurricane.
[00:03:56.375 --> 00:04:06.477]  The most criticized scene in the movie An Inconvenient Truth was showing that the combination of sea level rise and storm surge would flood a 9-11 memorial site.
[00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:09.198]  And people said, what a terrible exaggeration.
[00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:14.079]  Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City last night, flooding the World Trade Center site.
[00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:17.557]  That happens every decade or so on record.
[00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:30.450]  But he predicts specifically an area by the World Trade Center destruction where they put in a slurry wall and an area designed for the hurricanes that come in and routinely flood the area.
[00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:34.334]  So he manufactures this one prophecy that came true.
[00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:41.276]  But of course, his new film doesn't get into his big prediction in 2006 that didn't come true.
[00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:51.378]  And that was that both the northern and southern ice caps, Arctica and Antarctica, would be completely melted by 2013-2014.
[00:04:51.458 --> 00:05:03.960]  He would use satellite footage that's time-lapse, showing it shrinking in the spring and summer, but he'd cut there and not showing it get big in the fall and winter.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.582]  That's what the ice caps do.
[00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:11.867]  The ice caps of Mars get bigger and smaller during its winter and its summers as well.
[00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:23.042]  Another big one in his previous film was the implication that polar bears couldn't swim when they were out hunting on ice flows, and that the ice was all disappearing and they wouldn't have a home.
[00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:39.290]  Al Gore knows full well that the glaciers shrink again in the summer, expand in the winter, and that polar bears are the best land animal swimmers in the world, measured swimming over 300 miles, hunting seal, walrus, and of course, whale.
[00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:44.228]  But again, he knows his young audience, mainly school children, don't know that.
[00:05:44.548 --> 00:05:46.849]  So it tugs at the strings of their hearts.
[00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.134]  He also doesn't tell them that polar bear populations are up five times what they were measured in the 1950s.
[00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:56.315]  But of course, that's another big lie.
[00:05:57.116 --> 00:06:01.559]  First, it was going to be the great ice age in the 70s and 80s that we needed carbon taxes for.
[00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.461]  Then it was going to be the great warming phase in the 90s and 2000s.
[00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:06.382]  But the last 16, 17 years conclusively,
[00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:11.705]  The decline in temperature has happened.
[00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:17.167]  That's why six years ago in Copenhagen at the UN Summit, they had to quote, hide the decline.
[00:06:17.547 --> 00:06:19.548]  And all of that came out in Climategate.
[00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:27.772]  But Al Gore hopes you forget that, and just believe he's the second coming of Christ, and pay him billions, making him the carbon billionaire.
[00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:29.912]  It is right to save humanity.
[00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:32.814]  It is wrong to pollute this earth.
[00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.875]  It is right to give hope to the future generations.
[00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:45.666]  He talks about the despair of global destruction and the forest fires and all the rest of it, but says, don't worry, there's hope.
[00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:51.567]  Global governance and world carbon taxes paid to him and other select corporations.
[00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:53.408]  Let's look at those forest fires.
[00:06:54.168 --> 00:07:04.770]  It's admittedly forest service policy not letting farmers and ranchers cut fire breaks in the last 60 years that has caused huge mega fires to continue to spread.
[00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.352]  There's always been wildfires, as long as there's been plants and lightning.
[00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:12.656]  And it's part of the carbon cycle and produces a lot of nitrogen and other things for the soil.
[00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:24.065]  But again, Al Gore points cameras at these forest fires and shows humans driving through them and implies that forest fires are something new on this planet.
[00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:29.327]  He says the great change we've seen is the solar farms and the big wind farms.
[00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:31.348]  But if you look at the statistics, it's clear.
[00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:36.290]  Solar produces far less energy than coal, oil, or natural gas.
[00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:48.535]  But it's still much better than wind, who produces the least amount of energy system out there and creates absolute devastation to wildlife in the areas where it's being implemented.
[00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:58.731]  But the reason Al Gore's for it is that he and his friends, through government contracts, are making hundreds of billions of dollars off the wind farms and off the solar farms.
[00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:00.955]  But there's something even more insidious here.
[00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:24.465]  They get to imply that they're cutting edge, that they are there promoting new technologies when they're the ones blocking fish infusion, zero-point energy, carburetors where you can go a hundred miles on a single gallon, and so many other systems of so-called disruptive technologies we know the globalists have been blocking the development and deployment of in the last 60 years.
[00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:34.698]  I saw on the news just a few days ago that Bill Nye's latest episode of his TV show was about how we shouldn't have more than one child, like China, and how we should be penalized if we do.
[00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.400]  And then I noticed the name of the show.
[00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:37.822]  I hadn't seen it on Netflix.
[00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:39.825]  Bill Nye Saves the World.
[00:08:40.782 --> 00:08:47.648]  When I saw that trailer for Al Gore's new film a few weeks ago, I was intending to shoot this review and call it, Al Gore Saves the World.
[00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:51.472]  But you actually look at the people pushing the modern environmental agenda.
[00:08:51.792 --> 00:09:03.103]  It's all about cutting off human resources, all about saying humans are cast as the bad guys, except for the elite who are busy reducing our population and enslaving us all for our own good.
[00:09:03.963 --> 00:09:09.687]  Al Gore and Bill Nye are a bunch of eugenicist globalists on record.
[00:09:10.207 --> 00:09:11.428]  This is not about the environment.
[00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:31.320]  It's about making carbon the evil, instead of genetic engineering, cross-human animal chimeras, open-air pollination of cross-species pharmacological crops, massive rise of new bacteria and mutated viruses that threaten not just human life, but human life on the face of this globe.
[00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:37.919]  This movement is in the tradition of every great movement that has advanced humankind.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:48.009]  They want a system, a new dark age for the general public, where they use environmentalism and political correctness to shut down free thought and bring in a great psychological tyranny.
[00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.954]  We need to expose Al Gore's last film and his latest fraud for what it is.
[00:09:53.715 --> 00:10:04.905]  A piece of sophistic fraud meant to demonize humanity, make us hate ourselves, and turn off our life force so the parasite globalists can rule and control us into the future.
[00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:10.736]  DNA Force.
[00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:13.977]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:10:14.017 --> 00:10:15.038]  DNA Force.
[00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:23.140]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.242]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:29.282]  DNA Force.
[00:10:29.322 --> 00:10:31.143]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:46.267]  Because it's already here.

[00:11:28.192 --> 00:11:29.893]  I'm David Knight, here with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.094]  We are past the 24-hour mark.
[00:11:32.174 --> 00:11:37.557]  I don't know how many hours we're into it, but we've got another four or five hours left of the marathon broadcast, so we've got a lot of news.
[00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.538]  We've had a revision.
[00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:47.542]  Of course, it has to be signed by President Trump, no question about that, but we'll see what happens to it in the Senate.
[00:11:47.562 --> 00:11:50.344]  We're going to take a look at the details of that health care bill.
[00:11:50.704 --> 00:11:55.467]  We're also going to take a look at some of the back and forth and the French debate that I think is very
[00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:56.267]  Yes, we are.
[00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.072]  Or a Storm Trooper mask into Ashwaubenon High School.
[00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:27.855]  And this is obviously not Lake Wobegon High School where everybody is above average because they had a below average response to this.
[00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:33.497]  They had a concerned parent call the police because they saw somebody walking in with unusual clothing.
[00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.239]  Remember, this is just a Storm Trooper mask.
[00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:40.460]  In case you get scared, it wasn't the full outfit.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.281]  They were not dressed in a blue TSA uniform or a SWAT team uniform.
[00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.562]  The real Storm Troopers.
[00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:48.782]  But they got freaked out about that.
[00:12:49.443 --> 00:12:53.684]  They said there was no actual... This came out of the Ash Public Safety.
[00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:54.544]  They tweeted this out.
[00:12:54.944 --> 00:12:58.646]  They said there was no actual threat at the high school.
[00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:02.147]  And when they said that, they spelled there as T-H-E-I-R.
[00:13:02.587 --> 00:13:03.707]  Just saying, okay?
[00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:06.248]  So the only threat is that these are the people educating your children.
[00:13:06.468 --> 00:13:07.029]  Exactly!
[00:13:07.089 --> 00:13:09.111]  This is the people at the school putting this out.
[00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:10.413]  There's no actual threat.
[00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:14.318]  At the high school, a student came to school wearing a Star Wars costume with a mask.
[00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:17.282]  That was their complete Twitter sentence there.
[00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:21.187]  So don't be alarmed if you see somebody wearing a Stormtrooper mask.
[00:13:21.207 --> 00:13:24.811]  But do be alarmed if you see the kind of stuff that we're seeing repeatedly.
[00:13:25.874 --> 00:13:27.034]  And the airplane crew.
[00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:34.197]  See, when you have a stormtrooper environment at the airport, it eventually works its way into society.
[00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:46.701]  And I read a long recollection from a lady who lived in East Germany talking about how people in their ordinary, everyday capacity, when you would meet them as an individual to individual, they were fine.
[00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:55.233]  But once they got into their job as a retail store clerk, or if they're behind the counter at a bakery, they got very officious and bossy.
[00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:55.613]  Why?
[00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:59.119]  Because they lived in an authoritarian society.
[00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:02.504]  And once they got into a position of even just a little bit of power,
[00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:07.117]  They wanted to turn that abuse on other people, because they had been abused so much.
[00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:12.562]  I think that's what we're seeing here, because we've seen United Airlines, we've seen American Airlines, now we see Delta Airlines.
[00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:23.732]  Remember the United Airlines, that was the first one, doctor who, they smashed him up, broke some teeth and things like that, drug him off the flight, because they had overbooked the flight.
[00:14:24.272 --> 00:14:25.213]  They had overbooked the flight.
[00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:29.998]  And of course, the government tells the airlines that they can overbook the flight,
[00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:35.102]  And then they have a limit that they don't necessarily have to go up to.
[00:14:36.002 --> 00:14:38.744]  They say that, and I think they have changed this now.
[00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:40.646]  There's talk about having changed that.
[00:14:41.186 --> 00:14:47.932]  But at the time of the United flight, it was, I think, four times the amount of the ticket or something like $1,200 or $1,300.
[00:14:50.003 --> 00:14:53.365]  They didn't have to go beyond that, and they didn't have to go up to that point.
[00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:58.508]  They could just call in the stormtroopers, who would just smash you and drag you off the plane as we saw with that doctor.
[00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:07.493]  Then we had the American Airlines situation, where they had a guy who got very officious, smashed a woman in the face with the stroller, baby stroller.
[00:15:07.513 --> 00:15:08.994]  She's got her hands full of toddlers.
[00:15:09.394 --> 00:15:12.216]  She's trying to stow the trailer, but they have a policy.
[00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:13.137]  I have rules here.
[00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:17.638]  Do what I say, and give this to me and I'll smash you in the face with it, which is what he did.
[00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:20.383]  And a guy from Texas, a church deacon, said,
[00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:22.123]  Knock that off.
[00:15:22.163 --> 00:15:23.944]  You try that with me, that'll be the last thing you do.
[00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.525]  The guy said, yeah, yeah, do something about that.
[00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:26.726]  You saw that re-encounter, right?
[00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:28.708]  So the guy still didn't want to back down.
[00:15:29.368 --> 00:15:30.989]  And now we've had Delta today.
[00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:32.070]  We had Delta staff.
[00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.032]  This came off a couple of weeks ago.
[00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:36.314]  And it was just loaded onto YouTube.
[00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:45.301]  Delta staff told a California couple they could be jailed and lose their children, their son, age two, if they don't give up their seat.
[00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:47.562]  You will have to give up your seat or you're going to go to jail.
[00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:48.903]  Your wife is going to go to jail.
[00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:50.405]  And we'll take your kids from you.
[00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:51.818]  Incredible.
[00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:52.438]  That's the state.
[00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:53.759]  Because you won't give up your seat.
[00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:55.459]  Yeah, that they oversold.
[00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:58.200]  And the guy said they were due to travel from Hawaii to L.A.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.720]  last week.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.421]  They were told to relinquish the seat of their youngest son, who was two years old.
[00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:07.722]  The mother said, as a mother, you have to have, you have a one-year-old and a two-year-old.
[00:16:07.782 --> 00:16:09.582]  It doesn't matter whether that's true or false.
[00:16:09.642 --> 00:16:13.683]  It just puts fear in me because they're telling me they're going to take my children.
[00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:19.645]  And so they told, she had a car seat that was on top of the seat, said, you'll have to sit on one of your parents' knees.
[00:16:19.665 --> 00:16:20.645]  We're going to take that car seat.
[00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:21.445]  We don't want that in there.
[00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:25.047]  After a long debate, they agreed to it, but then they threw him off the plane anyway.
[00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.247]  Yeah, they said it's too late.
[00:16:26.307 --> 00:16:26.947]  It's too late now.
[00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:29.088]  You finally acquiesced to our commands.
[00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:29.988]  It's too late.
[00:16:30.008 --> 00:16:31.049]  You've made us all mad.
[00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:32.389]  You've ruffled all of our feathers.
[00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:33.610]  Isn't this amazing?
[00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:39.472]  And then they try and say that that's not the policy, that any child under two has to be in the parent's seat.
[00:16:39.952 --> 00:16:42.654]  But then you go to their website and it says the exact opposite.
[00:16:42.694 --> 00:16:50.881]  It says, for your convenience, for your safety, we really recommend you buy an additional seat for your child and get it a child booster seat or whatever.
[00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:52.242]  So they're contradicting themselves.
[00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:57.226]  Well, again, it's just these arbitrary rules, just as they see happening to them on a daily basis by the TSA.
[00:16:57.747 --> 00:17:00.970]  I have a rule, I've drawn a line here, and if you cross over that,
[00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.752]  Then there is no reasonable limit to my response.
[00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:08.955]  I can beat you, I can kill you if I want to, because we see the police doing that on a regular basis.
[00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.417]  A minor infraction, you're selling loosies on the sidewalk.
[00:17:12.437 --> 00:17:14.639]  We can kill you if you resist us or talk back to us.
[00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:18.341]  And so what they had to do, they did not give them a refund.
[00:17:18.982 --> 00:17:20.763]  They were forced to book a hotel room.
[00:17:21.143 --> 00:17:23.585]  They were forced to buy a plane ticket the next day.
[00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:27.067]  And of course, you know, that's going to be very expensive if you don't buy your plane ticket in advance.
[00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:28.328]  From Hawaii, more or less.
[00:17:28.888 --> 00:17:29.549]  Why so?
[00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:31.431]  Anyway, that's amazing.
[00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:35.235]  They said as we were leaving the plane they had four or five passengers waiting for a seat.
[00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:47.228]  Look, if the airlines want to do that as a business model, and they do, then they ought to bear the economic brunt of it and just understand they're gonna have to pay more if everybody shows up, if they want to keep doing it.
[00:17:47.268 --> 00:17:50.572]  That ought to be the way that they arbitrate that, but you don't have
[00:17:50.712 --> 00:17:51.272]  We're good.
[00:18:20.712 --> 00:18:22.413]  It's not airports, it's transportation.
[00:18:22.913 --> 00:18:29.197]  And as they take over our roads, and believe me, they are going to do it if you don't wake up and demand that they not do it.
[00:18:29.237 --> 00:18:34.720]  Because we have a coalition of the most powerful economic interests in our country and outside of our country.
[00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:37.242]  We have a decaying infrastructure.
[00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:42.794]  They're looking to get that rebuilt partially with private funds.
[00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:45.237]  They will be turning to foreign corporations to get that done.
[00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:51.426]  But then we also have an alliance between Big Otto and Silicon Valley to want to take over your driving.
[00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:52.227]  So we're going to have...
[00:18:53.248 --> 00:18:54.229]  Highways that we don't own.
[00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:56.370]  We're going to have cars that we don't own.
[00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:02.734]  We're going to have a tax and track regime that is going to be run like the officious airports that I cannot stand.
[00:19:02.814 --> 00:19:04.816]  So, just keep that in mind.
[00:19:05.236 --> 00:19:09.719]  The real storm troopers are very well entrenched and they are advancing on us.
[00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.700]  And we have to have a rebel alliance.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:25.186]  Absolutely and it's interesting because we're seeing as people are now filming these encounters and so they're able to push back so people could actually see how violent it got with that doctor that was ripped off the plane and how his blood was pouring from his face.
[00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:34.370]  Someone got that on video and that was how it was able to really put the pressure on the airlines even though the CEO came out and issued two terrible apologies.
[00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:41.354]  And so now they said that they're no longer going to kick people off the plane if they've already boarded the plane.
[00:19:41.374 --> 00:19:44.116]  So obviously you said this video came out a few weeks prior to that.
[00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:46.437]  I'm just worried that people are going to get accustomed to it.
[00:19:46.738 --> 00:19:47.358]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[00:19:47.418 --> 00:19:48.419]  Because when they first came out...
[00:19:49.096 --> 00:19:54.099]  With their manhandling sexual assault on children, we had a big pushback against it.
[00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:55.600]  InfoWars is a big part of that.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.061]  We organized a opt-out.
[00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:58.722]  Remember that?
[00:19:58.902 --> 00:20:02.884]  The very first Thanksgiving they had the scanners in, we organized an opt-out.
[00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:03.504]  And what did they do?
[00:20:03.564 --> 00:20:10.328]  On the busiest travel day of the year, when they tell us that they have to have these procedures for our security, they just shut everything down.
[00:20:10.348 --> 00:20:11.489]  Let everybody walk through the machine.
[00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:14.251]  Because they didn't want to have that kind of protest.
[00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:14.731]  Shut it down.
[00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:19.214]  Infowars was at the very center of organizing that, but that was the way that they pushed it out.
[00:20:19.274 --> 00:20:27.741]  And so now we do occasionally see people who complain about the way that they are manhandled or molested by the TSA, but people get used to it.
[00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:36.927]  Well, when you opt out, because I, unless I'm in a rush, I usually always opt out and I, you know, kind of in a snarky way request the TSA free massage.
[00:20:37.868 --> 00:20:48.436]  And now, to just make you realize how much you're inconveniencing them for not stepping through their little microwave machine, they really pat you down really hard, really aggressively.
[00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:53.019]  That's kind of their way, like you said, they get that little bit of a power, and they get on the power trip.
[00:20:53.541 --> 00:20:56.002]  They also like to tell you, when you tell them, I don't want to go through the radiation.
[00:20:57.063 --> 00:20:59.484]  You know, I don't want any of this stuff, quite frankly.
[00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:02.006]  But they make you stand over by the machine.
[00:21:02.126 --> 00:21:02.346]  Right.
[00:21:02.486 --> 00:21:04.987]  Which is, I said, I'm not standing there.
[00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:06.648]  I'm not standing by that machine.
[00:21:06.988 --> 00:21:10.150]  I'm doing this because I don't want to be irradiated.
[00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.811]  So you get into all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:12.972]  You have to stand up to this.
[00:21:13.012 --> 00:21:14.913]  You have to have civil disobedience.
[00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:19.635]  And not like these people who didn't stand up when the doctor is being dragged off the plane.
[00:21:19.735 --> 00:21:22.877]  No one stood up like we saw that Texas Deacon did.
[00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:30.462]  I was really happy to see that, and I was not surprised that he was from Texas, because people from Texas are much less likely to put up with that kind of nonsense.
[00:21:30.882 --> 00:21:33.524]  Another piece of news, and we'll go to a story from you here.
[00:21:34.324 --> 00:21:42.209]  We had a story come out from New American, another study by John Lott, who does a lot of gun and violence statistics.
[00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:43.890]  He said, half of U.S.
[00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.232]  murders happen in only 2% of the counties.
[00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:47.873]  Let me repeat that.
[00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:49.995]  Half of the murders in the U.S.
[00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:54.039]  happen in only 2% of the counties.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.005]  And as a matter of fact, it goes up to two-thirds happen in only 5% of the counties.
[00:21:59.465 --> 00:22:03.270]  He said more than half of the counties had no murders at all.
[00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.234]  And of course, guess where you're more likely to have murders and violence?
[00:22:07.574 --> 00:22:09.036]  Where you have gun controllers.
[00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:14.259]  Urban areas that have low gun ownership amongst the citizenry quote experience much higher murder rates.
[00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:14.739]  We know that.
[00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.440]  We can see that in Chicago.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.820]  We see that in Washington.
[00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:18.901]  We see that in New York.
[00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:27.285]  While so much of the country that has very high gun ownership rates have zero, zero murders.
[00:22:27.425 --> 00:22:32.008]  So just more statistical evidence showing that there is an inverse correlation
[00:22:32.648 --> 00:22:34.889]  Between gun ownership and violence.
[00:22:35.469 --> 00:22:37.210]  It makes it go down.
[00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.711]  Every study shows this, but this is very impressive.
[00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:43.733]  Only 2% of the counties in the United States have half of all the U.S.
[00:22:43.773 --> 00:22:44.033]  murders.
[00:22:44.053 --> 00:22:46.234]  You can see that full story at New American.
[00:22:46.254 --> 00:22:52.856]  Now David, weren't you telling me, I know we kind of like to talk here behind the scenes, and you were explaining the Wild Wild West really wasn't that wild.
[00:22:52.956 --> 00:22:59.599]  Everyone used to open carry, and it kind of kept all the crime down because everyone could see everyone was packing, so you really weren't looking.
[00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:04.565]  Well, yeah, there's a book out called Gunfighters, Vigilantes, and something else.
[00:23:04.605 --> 00:23:10.511]  But basically, you see, Hollywood created the image that we have of the Wild West.
[00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:15.517]  And every time somebody talks about freedom, they always say, oh, we don't want the Wild West when it comes to such and such.
[00:23:15.557 --> 00:23:16.177]  Fill in the blank.
[00:23:16.237 --> 00:23:19.841]  It's what the antithesis of what the Democrats want is the Wild West.
[00:23:19.862 --> 00:23:21.063]  Yeah, the Wild West of the Internet.
[00:23:21.223 --> 00:23:25.845]  Yeah, the reality is, is that most people did not get involved in it.
[00:23:25.925 --> 00:23:31.987]  Most of it was gunfighters, people who were gambling or involved in prostitution or whatever.
[00:23:32.027 --> 00:23:34.268]  So it's basically that type of thing.
[00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:36.288]  It was not the image that you see in Hollywood.
[00:23:36.308 --> 00:23:37.209]  It was really pretty rare.
[00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:43.211]  And it was a small group of people, just kind of like we see today, that drug dealers are shooting each other.
[00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:46.972]  But in those days, they didn't really have drive-by shootings.
[00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:48.833]  We didn't get that kind of stuff until we got Prohibition.
[00:23:49.213 --> 00:23:50.395]  We got alcohol prohibition.
[00:23:50.415 --> 00:23:58.745]  That's when you started having people spraying innocent people with bullets and then it got even worse after 46 years now we have of drug prohibition.
[00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:02.550]  The violence against the general population is getting much worse.
[00:24:04.215 --> 00:24:10.056]  And we have a, they're telling me we have an Alex Jones and Anthony Cumia video that is coming up.
[00:24:10.096 --> 00:24:11.437]  We're going to play after the break.
[00:24:11.637 --> 00:24:13.597]  We're just still a few more minutes out from the break.
[00:24:14.257 --> 00:24:15.257]  You got some more stories, Leigh-Anne?
[00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:27.080]  Well, and the story, what we can talk about, so this Anthony Cumia clip with Alex Jones, they're basically talking about conservative media persecution and the attack on Alex Jones and of course Colbert attacking Trump.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.462]  Um, so we've got some stories kind of about that today after the break.
[00:24:30.482 --> 00:24:38.167]  And after that video, we'll talk a little bit about the latest attack on Alex Jones and InfoWars comes directly from BuzzFeed.
[00:24:38.328 --> 00:24:38.868]  Fake news.
[00:24:38.928 --> 00:24:40.989]  They put out that P dossier.
[00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:44.912]  Of course, they're like the the the biggest news story of the year.
[00:24:44.972 --> 00:24:47.254]  Frankly, that was fake news came from BuzzFeed.
[00:24:48.694 --> 00:24:53.036]  We look up fake news, you should see BuzzFeed right there in the definition.
[00:24:53.376 --> 00:24:57.997]  Of all people, to criticize somebody for BuzzFeed to do that?
[00:24:58.057 --> 00:24:58.337]  Come on.
[00:24:58.377 --> 00:25:01.578]  We do put our sources of information there.
[00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:04.959]  We tell you, we show you, as Alex is going down this list of all the things that
[00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:11.585]  People always criticize us for, you know, he's talking about chimeras and other things, but we're showing mainstream news articles!
[00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:12.886]  Right, it's real!
[00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:19.472]  They're constantly saying it's a conspiracy theory until ten years after the fact they're like, well, turns out Alex was right!
[00:25:20.093 --> 00:25:23.296]  Or people are trying to read your mind, or they're watching you through your computer!
[00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:26.317]  That was the one they used to laugh, bend over, double laughing.
[00:25:26.377 --> 00:25:29.699]  Oh, you guys, you paranoid ten-fold hat conspiracy theorists.
[00:25:29.719 --> 00:25:35.702]  You think that people are trying to read your mind, that they're doing brain research, or they're watching you on the monitor.
[00:25:35.722 --> 00:25:36.843]  Or they want to micro-kick you.
[00:25:37.063 --> 00:25:37.663]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.244]  Who would think that they would want to do that today?
[00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.744]  It's not funny anymore, is it?
[00:25:40.764 --> 00:25:41.145]  Right.
[00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:42.545]  Are you upset about it?
[00:25:42.565 --> 00:25:43.906]  Do you want to do something about it?
[00:25:43.966 --> 00:25:47.568]  I mean, it's another one of these things, like we're talking about we need a rebel alliance.
[00:25:47.648 --> 00:25:50.989]  We need to inform people, and people need to get upset about this.
[00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.990]  You should get upset about it.
[00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.512]  To just break in to you guys and agree with you, does that ever make this point?
[00:25:57.733 --> 00:26:02.716]  30 years ago, they admitted that they were creating animal-human clones at the embryonic level.
[00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:07.378]  For decades they've been admittedly implanting them in cows and things to grow up these humanoids.
[00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.500]  And of course there's animal rights laws and there's human rights laws.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.241]  There's no new alien species laws.
[00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:17.523]  An alien just means not of this world, not of this country, not of this land.
[00:26:17.623 --> 00:26:19.824]  Something new, like a salmon that's part
[00:26:20.998 --> 00:26:26.084]  You know, insect and asparagus, that's what the super salmon are that are extincting the regular salmon.
[00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:27.807]  That's a new alien life form.
[00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:38.580]  And the reason it's so dangerous is it allows diseases that normally wouldn't jump from one flora to one phylum or vice versa or interspecies or the same family.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.561]  Now it can happen.
[00:26:40.302 --> 00:26:46.585]  And the reason they don't like us covering it is, we cover it in a negative light, or in a questioning or a warning light.
[00:26:47.145 --> 00:26:50.706]  Now they're coming out going, oh wonderful, babies with five daddies!
[00:26:51.347 --> 00:26:56.429]  As if it's like pro-gay or pro-lesbian to not have a man or woman come together, but splice men together.
[00:26:57.009 --> 00:26:58.770]  Well, men don't have mitochondrial DNA!
[00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.973]  And they're already making embryos and then killing them before they develop that are all men or all female.
[00:27:05.313 --> 00:27:07.314]  What do you do when you don't splice a woman with a man?
[00:27:08.695 --> 00:27:10.256]  It's just like Bill Nye Science Guy.
[00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:17.000]  His show in the 90s, when they put it on Netflix, they edited out the part where a woman explains X and Y and how the sex is discovered.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.081]  That's knowledge and science.
[00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:20.241]  It's been memory holes.
[00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:24.204]  It's not sexist or homophobic or xenophobic or transphobic.
[00:27:25.054 --> 00:27:32.779]  When they're just waging war on knowledge, and then they say, oh, science is real, and they're George Soros-funded things.
[00:27:32.879 --> 00:27:35.321]  So that's the reality of how hardcore this is.
[00:27:35.361 --> 00:27:36.202]  And we're not perfect.
[00:27:36.282 --> 00:27:36.902]  I'm not perfect.
[00:27:36.922 --> 00:27:40.284]  A lot of the other hosts, I think, are better overall than I am, like Leigh-Anne and David and everybody.
[00:27:40.324 --> 00:27:45.668]  But at the end of the day, we're questioning, at least, and saying, we've got Promethean fire now.
[00:27:45.988 --> 00:27:47.409]  We better have a real discussion about it.
[00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:48.070]  But back to you guys.
[00:27:48.763 --> 00:27:51.907]  Well, you know, Alex, when you're talking about it, people should get upset about it.
[00:27:51.987 --> 00:27:56.852]  And when Alex gets upset about it, they make fun of the fact that he gets upset about something that's truly outrageous.
[00:27:57.153 --> 00:28:03.460]  You know, back in North Carolina and throughout the South, we've had a couple of non-native species introduced.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.043]  Down in Florida, when I lived there, we had hyacinths that were brought in.
[00:28:06.803 --> 00:28:08.365]  The government brought in kudzu.
[00:28:08.545 --> 00:28:10.046]  They thought they were going to solve a problem.
[00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:15.570]  As a matter of fact, we would point out to people with the Libertarian Party, kudzu is a pretty bad problem in some parts of the state.
[00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:19.773]  Those of you who don't know what that is, it comes from, I think it comes from Korea.
[00:28:20.454 --> 00:28:22.515]  And it's a very rapidly growing plant.
[00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:24.237]  It can grow a couple of feet in a day.
[00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:30.959]  And so you see these places where it has just grown this massive jungle that's grown over the trees, grown over cars, that sort of thing.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.181]  And we said, you know, government is like kudzu.
[00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:39.503]  You bring it in to solve a problem and before you know it, it's out of control and it's taken over everything.
[00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:40.443]  And that's true.
[00:28:40.543 --> 00:28:42.324]  And so when we talk about Frankenfish,
[00:28:43.184 --> 00:28:47.225]  Who have DNA in them that's not a different fish.
[00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:52.767]  It's something that is spliced in from plants or something that is totally alien like that.
[00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:54.247]  That is a real concern.
[00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:55.228]  You should be concerned about that.
[00:28:55.248 --> 00:28:56.688]  You should be concerned about your privacy.
[00:28:56.968 --> 00:29:03.250]  You should be concerned about the fact that we have people who demand to know every detail of your private life.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.131]  And you may say, well, I don't have anything that I'm concerned about hiding.
[00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:10.372]  They want to know if their narratives are working with you.
[00:29:10.492 --> 00:29:14.274]  You have to understand that it's not necessarily you as an individual.
[00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:16.576]  It's the society collectively.
[00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:19.978]  They want to know when they create a narrative like the Russians hacked our election.
[00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:22.579]  They want to know if you are buying that.
[00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.401]  Is that narrative ringing true with you?
[00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:26.261]  And
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:48.102]  Americans and know if they're able to move the discussion, move the window of what people are thinking.
[00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:50.162]  So that's the most important part about it.
[00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:52.663]  It's a propaganda operation.
[00:29:53.163 --> 00:29:57.444]  And yes, of course, if you stand up, you will be hammered down.
[00:29:57.864 --> 00:30:00.144]  That's the other part of it that is very dangerous.
[00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:05.946]  People think about that and they think, well, you know, if I don't stand up to them, if I don't do anything, they'll leave me alone.
[00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:06.926]  No, they won't.
[00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:11.291]  They're going to continue to move the hive mind in the direction that they want to do it.
[00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:13.815]  They're going to manipulate it and they're going to measure how effective that's been.
[00:30:13.955 --> 00:30:23.788]  Well, perfect example, David, is with this fire coal bear after he took it too far for even the left and made that homophobic slur when he was attacking Trump.
[00:30:24.881 --> 00:30:26.623]  People did get angry, finally.
[00:30:26.723 --> 00:30:28.345]  And they said, wait a minute, you've gone too far.
[00:30:28.425 --> 00:30:29.125]  File Colbert.
[00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:33.090]  Well, he's come out now and he says he won't apologize for the vulgar Trump joke.
[00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.992]  He would change maybe a few crude words, but he's not going to apologize.
[00:30:36.373 --> 00:30:42.479]  So if you want to talk about kind of moving the pendulum either way, when you actually get mad, they just say, well, we don't care about your feelings.
[00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:45.983]  It doesn't matter when we hurt your feelings or go too far.
[00:30:46.223 --> 00:30:46.603]  That's right.
[00:30:46.703 --> 00:30:53.048]  And of course, you know, he doesn't have to... He can resort to that kind of cheap joke or whatever, if he thinks it's a joke.
[00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:55.751]  Resort to cheap laughter by doing vulgarity.
[00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:59.093]  You know, the interesting thing was, I listened once on vacation with my wife.
[00:30:59.113 --> 00:31:03.377]  We listened to John Cleese talking about his life.
[00:31:03.437 --> 00:31:06.779]  And it was really kind of his study of comedy, his career.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.922]  And he ended it up by saying there's two things that are killing comedy today.
[00:31:10.442 --> 00:31:11.843]  One of them is political correctness.
[00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:14.766]  The other one is vulgarity, because it cheapens everything.
[00:31:15.186 --> 00:31:17.887]  And you real quickly run down to the bottom of the hill.
[00:31:18.127 --> 00:31:24.069]  Once you start resorting to vulgarity rather than good writing, pretty soon you run out of any maneuvering area.
[00:31:24.089 --> 00:31:30.252]  So we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to play this video with Anthony Cumia and Alex Jones.
[00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:30.692]  That's right.
[00:31:30.712 --> 00:31:34.373]  And before we do, I just want to remind you, this is part of our 30-hour marathon broadcast.
[00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:35.754]  We really do appreciate your support.
[00:31:36.554 --> 00:31:42.478]  And in response to that, we've offered some deep discounts on some products that we hope you can use, hope that you'll try if you haven't tried them yet.
[00:31:42.538 --> 00:31:45.720]  Things like Brain Force, 30% off Brain Force Plus.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.082]  We have a wide variety of products that are 20% off.
[00:31:49.122 --> 00:31:57.048]  We have 33% off the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste that has added iodine and nano-silver.
[00:31:57.068 --> 00:32:00.310]  You're not going to find other toothpastes with nano-silver in it.
[00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.551]  You're not going to find it, in my opinion.
[00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:15.223]  Another toothpaste that is not only natural and good for you and is going to fight bacteria in your mouth, fight gum disease that leads to heart disease as well as tooth loss, but I don't think you're going to find another toothpaste that's going to leave your mouth tasting that fresh.
[00:32:15.263 --> 00:32:16.805]  So we hope that you will try these products.
[00:32:17.225 --> 00:32:23.210]  We do appreciate, sincerely appreciate your support, especially at this time when we have the globalists moving against us.
[00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:40.282]  People like Google shutting down our ability to serve ads and also have the Federal Reserve Member, who's a foreign citizen, suing us because we talk about his advocacy of immigrants and refugees coming into this country and talk about his crony capitalism.
[00:32:40.322 --> 00:32:40.883]  How dare us!
[00:32:41.363 --> 00:32:42.804]  How dare us talk about things like that?
[00:32:42.824 --> 00:32:45.205]  Of course, you would never see mainstream media.
[00:32:45.245 --> 00:32:46.486]  Fox News is not going to talk about it.
[00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:48.087]  Certainly, CNN is not going to do it.
[00:32:48.127 --> 00:32:54.951]  And one of the reasons we ran the report was because CBS buried all the negative consequences of the refugee movement.
[00:32:55.111 --> 00:33:02.195]  They buried all that and just talked about how wonderful it was that he provided jobs at Chobani Yogurt for all these people that he advocates bringing in.
[00:33:02.555 --> 00:33:07.556]  Even though we get subsidized labor, subsidized factories that subsidize at your expense.
[00:33:07.616 --> 00:33:10.777]  That's the essential ingredient that is not listed in Chobani yogurt.
[00:33:10.877 --> 00:33:12.197]  It's taxpayer subsidy.
[00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.538]  So we don't get those kind of subsidies.
[00:33:14.578 --> 00:33:15.718]  We don't get government grants.
[00:33:16.198 --> 00:33:20.019]  Our budget is your contribution and what you buy from us.
[00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:25.360]  And so we try to offer you the very best products, the very best prices, and we really do sincerely appreciate your support.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.241]  Let's take a quick break.
[00:33:26.461 --> 00:33:29.461]  We're going to come back with Alex Jones and Anthony Cumia.
[00:33:29.581 --> 00:33:30.142]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:42.993]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:13.457]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:13.517 --> 00:35:16.583]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:19.169]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:35:19.189 --> 00:35:19.530]  Exactly.
[00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.310]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.631]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:35:24.671 --> 00:35:25.811]  We've both talked to them.
[00:35:26.131 --> 00:35:34.993]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:35:35.874 --> 00:35:36.954]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:35:37.294 --> 00:35:38.254]  We refuse to do that.
[00:35:38.634 --> 00:35:40.595]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:47.799]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:48.939]  It's a win-win.
[00:35:49.419 --> 00:35:50.180]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:04.946]  Let's go ahead and go to Anthony Comey, and I apologize, we got him on about 10 minutes late, and he's here, and we got about 20 minutes, and Roger Stone's joining us.
[00:37:04.986 --> 00:37:12.212]  Tell us about your network, how folks listen, and the fact that you had number one show in the country, syndicated in the cities you were in, kicked off the year.
[00:37:12.392 --> 00:37:16.195]  Not because of cussing, but because big corporations didn't like it and control the FCC.
[00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:20.658]  Then kicked off XM, because you call people killing cops animals, and they are animals.
[00:37:20.959 --> 00:37:25.783]  So the fact is, you've been successful over and over again, and now you've been relegated to the internet, which is great.
[00:37:26.383 --> 00:37:31.468]  Uh, not actually, I'm not, but, but, Antony Comia, you know, when you're on my show during the day, you're on a bunch of stations.
[00:37:31.728 --> 00:37:37.754]  The point is, is that, is that it's not that we're losers, we're getting relegated, we're being relegated because they can't compete.
[00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:44.279]  So, explain to people what it's like in this country, trying to get the word out and then what you think of InfoWars and the call to action, my friend.
[00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:44.820]  Sorry, I'm branching.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.803]  Oh my god, no, please, Alex, you, first of all,
[00:37:48.263 --> 00:37:50.164]  Boy, are they coming after you.
[00:37:50.704 --> 00:37:51.425]  I've seen this.
[00:37:52.205 --> 00:38:02.871]  It's happening all over with people that are making a difference and getting to the people and actually giving them something that they can latch on and say, yes, I want to fight.
[00:38:03.232 --> 00:38:04.572]  I want to listen to this guy.
[00:38:04.712 --> 00:38:08.855]  I want to hear an opposing viewpoint from the mainstream media.
[00:38:09.335 --> 00:38:15.238]  And you have been on the forefront of this for so long, and man, they are coming after you.
[00:38:15.558 --> 00:38:34.369]  If anybody thinks this is a coincidence, that all of a sudden a bunch of people that are stirring other people up, that are getting them to think, that are getting them to see that there's another way of thinking than this liberal, progressive crap that we see on a daily basis, they are taking us out of the mix.
[00:38:34.409 --> 00:38:38.731]  They're trying to quiet us because we're dangerous to them.
[00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:48.174]  We are totally against their plan of keeping everybody under wraps, under their feet, their boots on our necks.
[00:38:48.914 --> 00:38:53.795]  And you are a prime example right now of them trying to discredit you.
[00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:55.616]  It's been that way for so long.
[00:38:56.036 --> 00:38:56.276]  Me?
[00:38:56.636 --> 00:39:00.418]  I've been thrown off of every single type of mainstream media there is.
[00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:03.479]  I've had to literally start my network.
[00:39:03.539 --> 00:39:07.700]  Even though you always get top ratings and are always number one, it's because you are effective.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.901]  Your voice and your information carries gravitas.
[00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:12.102]  That's why you're shut down.
[00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:13.768]  That's what it is.
[00:39:13.848 --> 00:39:16.893]  They don't want us to have too much juice.
[00:39:17.374 --> 00:39:18.516]  Too much power.
[00:39:18.896 --> 00:39:23.644]  And the second you start really influencing people, if you're making jokes, maybe it's one thing.
[00:39:23.664 --> 00:39:27.409]  No, the second you start acting like a man trying to have a country for your children, then you're off the air.
[00:39:28.214 --> 00:39:29.074]  Oh, absolutely!
[00:39:29.414 --> 00:39:31.155]  That's a thing of the past.
[00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:32.715]  I'm disgusted.
[00:39:32.755 --> 00:39:41.557]  I watched some amazing documentaries on World War I and II, and Korea, Vietnam, and you just see men acting like men.
[00:39:41.977 --> 00:39:43.837]  And that now is a bad word?
[00:39:44.177 --> 00:39:46.938]  You're not allowed to be a man in this country anymore.
[00:39:46.978 --> 00:39:50.719]  Colleges are saying don't have paintings or murals of muscular men on the sports team.
[00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:52.379]  It's hurtful to those that aren't muscular.
[00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:58.639]  Is every story now worthy of The Onion?
[00:39:59.039 --> 00:40:04.381]  I used to read The Onion, a great parody site, and think, oh, that's hilarious because it's so ridiculous.
[00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:12.823]  Now mainstream media is absolutely outdoing The Onion for the most ridiculous things you'll ever, ever read.
[00:40:13.604 --> 00:40:30.985]  Let me ask you this, because you don't want to get into it, and we don't like to bitch about what's happening to us, but I mean, talk about the persecution you've gone through getting kicked off your hit show that was on for a decade, you know, had in many cases more viewers and listeners than Stern, and then you get kicked off because you stand up against Black Lives Matter going around killing cops.
[00:40:31.735 --> 00:40:38.900]  Yeah, all you have to say is exactly what leaders in the black community have said for years and years and years.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.421]  There's a problem with violence.
[00:40:40.742 --> 00:40:45.265]  There's a problem with out-of-wedlock children.
[00:40:45.885 --> 00:40:47.587]  And you just bring that up.
[00:40:47.947 --> 00:40:50.491]  But I'm not the right person to bring that up.
[00:40:50.551 --> 00:41:00.144]  So when I did, I was called, you know, racist and you're relegated to trying to fight against what labels people are giving you.
[00:41:00.985 --> 00:41:01.406]  No more.
[00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:04.390]  You don't even get to argue that point anymore.
[00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:12.992]  You're now arguing that, oh no, I'm not a racist, I'm not that, and they take you out of the mix for what you originally were trying to discuss.
[00:41:13.072 --> 00:41:17.893]  And I should add, compoundmedia.com, you're so polite when you plug it, compoundmedia.com.
[00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:19.614]  By the way, the purpose is a survival mechanism.
[00:41:19.654 --> 00:41:20.554]  They're huge, they're great.
[00:41:20.994 --> 00:41:23.035]  I want people to be bigger than we are.
[00:41:23.675 --> 00:41:24.856]  And in some cases, a lot of folks are.
[00:41:25.177 --> 00:41:27.379]  Some of their shows, you know, have more views and stuff than we do.
[00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.161]  That is a really good feeling, because I don't like being the only target here.
[00:41:30.181 --> 00:41:32.864]  That seems like that's kind of what's happening, but they kind of pick somebody.
[00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:34.546]  But let's shift gears and jump at any time.
[00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:36.668]  I know you host the last two hours, but, Owen, you know, jump in.
[00:41:36.688 --> 00:41:38.089]  I didn't just have you in here just to, you know, sit there.
[00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:41.012]  I know you're an awesome, awesome reporter, so please jump in.
[00:41:41.813 --> 00:41:43.314]  But talking about this,
[00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:45.276]  Take Stephen Colbert.
[00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:48.457]  He attacked me, that I know of, nine times the last two weeks.
[00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:51.138]  Lied about me, but oh, it's comedy, so it's okay.
[00:41:51.379 --> 00:41:56.661]  Said I was a racist, said I didn't know what my kids' names were, said I didn't know what, you know, two teachers were out of, like, 16 teachers.
[00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:02.764]  You know, after I had lunch, when I'm sitting there on the stand or whatever, and I'm like, literally, I had a bunch of chili, and I can't remember every teacher, sorry.
[00:42:03.664 --> 00:42:04.545]  Nobody can, okay?
[00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:07.646]  But the point is, I'm too busy actually working to be able to teach.
[00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:10.348]  I go to all the conferences, the kids get straight A's.
[00:42:10.588 --> 00:42:11.208]  Isn't that enough?
[00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:12.649]  You know, they're good kids, but
[00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:22.924]  Here he comes and he says, this statement we'll play in a few minutes, which he says that basically he's a holster for Vladimir Putin's Vienna sausage.
[00:42:23.665 --> 00:42:25.846]  And it's somewhat of a family show, but big deal.
[00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:29.388]  That's what was said, saying that he's a minion of Russia and he's bad.
[00:42:29.728 --> 00:42:31.169]  He's totally pushing Russia around.
[00:42:31.189 --> 00:42:32.209]  He's pushing China around.
[00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.450]  He's pushing North Korea around.
[00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:34.791]  This is pure bull.
[00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:35.731]  It was U.S.
[00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:38.253]  intelligence leaked the stuff, you know, like Hillary's saying it's the Russians.
[00:42:38.693 --> 00:42:40.234]  And so WikiLeaks and all this is happening.
[00:42:40.794 --> 00:42:42.456]  But then they're saying, oh, it's homophobic.
[00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:46.399]  They're now even, Anthony, eating their own, when clearly it's not homophobic.
[00:42:46.459 --> 00:42:49.823]  It's saying he's a butt kisser of Putin, which he isn't.
[00:42:49.843 --> 00:42:59.272]  If you call somebody a you-know-what sucker, like I call Congressman Schiff, I said he's a globalist you-know-what sucker, just like when De Niro says it in a movie about somebody.
[00:42:59.412 --> 00:43:01.874]  It means that they're groveling.
[00:43:02.155 --> 00:43:03.736]  It means they're servicing somebody.
[00:43:03.776 --> 00:43:05.218]  It isn't attacking gay people.
[00:43:05.658 --> 00:43:06.879]  We could do that if we wanted to.
[00:43:06.919 --> 00:43:07.499]  It's free speech.
[00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:10.840]  But even Colbert, they're saying, may lose his job over this.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.181]  This is dangerous.
[00:43:12.781 --> 00:43:17.944]  Alex, what you're actually saying here is that the left knows what context is.
[00:43:18.424 --> 00:43:19.504]  Oh my God!
[00:43:19.784 --> 00:43:23.746]  They have no clue about context, comedy, sarcasm.
[00:43:24.106 --> 00:43:30.169]  Everything that's said by anybody is taken at face value and should be dissected like that.
[00:43:30.609 --> 00:43:34.191]  And the discipline should be doled out accordingly.
[00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:37.212]  It's amazing, and I do love watching them eat their own.
[00:43:37.612 --> 00:43:44.514]  I am a First Amendment advocate like no one has seen, and I don't want anybody fired for anything they say.
[00:43:44.794 --> 00:43:52.176]  But if you're delusional enough to think that a... Oh, he celebrated when Bill O'Reilly went, and again, he's not perfect.
[00:43:52.216 --> 00:43:52.616]  Yes, yes!
[00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.017]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:43:54.717 --> 00:44:04.761]  No, they would never think, if you think a network talk show host could get away with saying anything like that about Obama without a public execution, you're out of your mind.
[00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:06.462]  That's the problem I have.
[00:44:06.562 --> 00:44:09.883]  I don't have a problem with Colbert saying whatever he wants about anybody.
[00:44:10.183 --> 00:44:19.867]  I have a problem with the double standard that people like myself and my friends and associates are crucified for making a joke about a minority group or what have you.
[00:44:20.247 --> 00:44:22.428]  And then when it comes around to someone like Colbert,
[00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:23.569]  He gets free reign!
[00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:24.109]  Well, exactly.
[00:44:24.229 --> 00:44:28.972]  I'm from Texas, and I like to make fun of rednecks, and I'm not bashing, but I mean, I've got some family.
[00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:31.334]  They're nice people, but they're literally like the Beverly Hillbillies.
[00:44:31.674 --> 00:44:38.058]  I may sound like there's some other people, but, you know, I'm kind of like Beverly Hillbilly Light, and it's kind of fun, but then I want to make fun of Asian people.
[00:44:38.098 --> 00:44:39.179]  My sister's Asian-adopted.
[00:44:39.199 --> 00:44:39.679]  I love Asians.
[00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:40.580]  It's funny, though.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.541]  You know, the North Korean stuff's sad, but it's funny.
[00:44:43.001 --> 00:44:45.763]  You know, Kim Jong-un, and people say, oh, you're being anti-Asian.
[00:44:45.823 --> 00:44:47.084]  No, it's funny stuff.
[00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:47.504]  It's funny.
[00:44:47.524 --> 00:44:48.545]  I mean, look at Japanese.
[00:44:48.565 --> 00:44:49.486]  They make fun of themselves.
[00:44:50.319 --> 00:44:50.719]  Sure!
[00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:51.599]  Absolutely!
[00:44:51.779 --> 00:44:55.741]  That used to be something that was taken in context of comedy.
[00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:58.301]  You could absolutely do stereotypical jokes.
[00:44:58.321 --> 00:44:59.982]  Remember Belushi doing the samurai?
[00:45:00.522 --> 00:45:01.202]  Absolutely!
[00:45:01.302 --> 00:45:04.063]  No one thought that was hateful.
[00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:04.563]  Sorry.
[00:45:05.184 --> 00:45:05.964]  Can't do that anymore.
[00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:07.044]  That'd be too offensive.
[00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:11.325]  No one thought it was hateful or that you were inciting violence against these people.
[00:45:11.525 --> 00:45:12.526]  They're insane!
[00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:16.367]  The left is mentally ill when it comes to things like this.
[00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:25.656]  There's no more important time than right now to support you over there at InfoWars, me at Compound Media, and other people that are trying to get the truth out there.
[00:45:25.716 --> 00:45:31.000]  We're the only people that really have, and it's weird to say, this amazing opportunity to
[00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:32.722]  Put the truth out there.
[00:45:32.962 --> 00:45:34.744]  We're not beholden to anybody.
[00:45:34.764 --> 00:45:35.986]  You know why they're so scared, Anthony?
[00:45:36.246 --> 00:45:41.772]  If I was surfing through TV and I saw you, not even knowing who you are, guaranteed sitting at your bar at home, that's home, right?
[00:45:42.332 --> 00:45:45.816]  Or your desk or whatever it is, I would stop and watch because it's real.
[00:45:46.336 --> 00:45:51.642]  That's what people used to go to the bar or barbecue or square dancing and talk or go to the soapbox.
[00:45:51.822 --> 00:45:52.743]  We're bringing it back.
[00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:52.983]  Go ahead.
[00:45:53.624 --> 00:45:54.685]  Bringing it right back to that.
[00:45:54.765 --> 00:46:03.813]  And there's no more important time because there is nowhere else to get credible news anymore than what they're calling alternative and trying to discredit.
[00:46:04.174 --> 00:46:10.560]  And you know, I can't say enough how much of an example you are at how they're trying to bring you down.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.322]  You're getting too popular, Alex.
[00:46:13.663 --> 00:46:18.367]  They're seeing that you're influencing a lot of people and that's dangerous ground for them.
[00:46:21.184 --> 00:46:22.305]  All right, we're back here live.
[00:46:22.325 --> 00:46:23.767]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:28.151]  That, of course, was Alex Jones and Anthony Cumia talking about media censorship.
[00:46:28.691 --> 00:46:30.713]  And we really do appreciate your support.
[00:46:30.733 --> 00:46:32.035]  Thank you so much for supporting us.
[00:46:32.095 --> 00:46:37.140]  We are well into our 30-hour marathon broadcast fundraiser.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.841]  And we cannot do this without you, so we really appreciate that.
[00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:44.542]  And again, if you want to take a look at InfoWars Store, we have some massive discounts.
[00:46:45.482 --> 00:46:47.903]  20 to 30 to 33% off various items.
[00:46:47.923 --> 00:46:52.504]  Our toothpaste, the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is 33% off.
[00:46:52.564 --> 00:46:54.924]  I know if you try that, you're going to love that.
[00:46:54.944 --> 00:46:57.025]  That's going to be your go-to toothpaste from here on out.
[00:46:57.845 --> 00:47:06.130]  My other favorite supplement is the other thing that's deeply discounted as well, Brain Force, plus 30% off and a wealth of supplements you'll find there at 20% off.
[00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.251]  So we really do appreciate your support.
[00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.412]  Thank you so much for helping us.
[00:47:09.792 --> 00:47:11.093]  We could not do this without you.
[00:47:11.133 --> 00:47:18.417]  It's very important for us to keep a vibrant discussion going and we are being attacked from all sides.
[00:47:18.717 --> 00:47:20.178]  Talk about some of the fake news articles.
[00:47:20.258 --> 00:47:22.619]  I think all of us are rocking the Brain Force today.
[00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:26.552]  This hour brought to you by BrainForce.
[00:47:27.652 --> 00:47:41.595]  But yeah, I mean the last thing Anthony Cumia said there about just we are having such a powerful effect on the globalists, on the establishment, not just only InfoWars, but everyone out there who's able to challenge the official narrative that they're putting out there.
[00:47:41.655 --> 00:47:44.836]  We are a threat to the global order.
[00:47:45.436 --> 00:47:48.677]  And I don't know if anyone's been checking out Paul Joseph Watson's Twitter feed.
[00:47:48.737 --> 00:47:51.498]  You can see he's really staying close on this French election.
[00:47:51.918 --> 00:47:55.419]  And he's got images of all the magazine racks there.
[00:47:55.979 --> 00:47:57.940]  They're all Macron.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.200]  They're none of Le Pen.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:47:59.760]  It's all him.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.880]  And he's got his shirt off.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.781]  He looks all buff.
[00:48:01.801 --> 00:48:03.921]  And they're all, like, selling this guy.
[00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:08.523]  He's the new leader, just like we had all the glorious covers of Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:08.563 --> 00:48:09.723]  And she was so wonderful.
[00:48:10.123 --> 00:48:11.564]  You could really see they were setting it up.
[00:48:11.604 --> 00:48:15.428]  Meanwhile, Trump was always represented with devil horns and things like that.
[00:48:15.508 --> 00:48:16.369]  Well, he's already won.
[00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:17.990]  I mean, we're several days out from the election.
[00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.672]  It's not going to be held until Sunday.
[00:48:19.712 --> 00:48:22.434]  But according to the mainstream press, he's already won.
[00:48:22.514 --> 00:48:24.456]  We see these news articles from AFP.
[00:48:24.956 --> 00:48:29.120]  Macron convinces the majority of French viewers in the TV debate.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:29.761]  He won the debate.
[00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:30.621]  He's going to win the election.
[00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:31.782]  He's convinced the majority.
[00:48:32.023 --> 00:48:33.144]  And here's another example, Leanne.
[00:48:33.604 --> 00:48:39.948]  The Telegraph, which is a conservative paper in general, but let's pay attention to the labels that they use on people.
[00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:46.313]  So they say, French centrist presidential candidate Macron against far-right rival Le Pen.
[00:48:46.493 --> 00:48:49.415]  Now, the truth is that he's not a centrist.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:52.197]  The truth is that he is a globalist extremist.
[00:48:52.717 --> 00:48:55.900]  The truth is, he's an EU hardliner, okay?
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:07.689]  But they don't use the terms globalist, they don't use the terms extremist, they will not use the term hardliner or even an EU sycophant, because that's really what he is, okay?
[00:49:07.809 --> 00:49:14.995]  But if they were to say French globalist extremist Macron is holding a comfortable lead versus nationalist rival
[00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:16.256]  Marine Le Pen.
[00:49:16.456 --> 00:49:17.857]  See, that's the way I would report it.
[00:49:17.877 --> 00:49:18.537]  Right.
[00:49:18.557 --> 00:49:19.938]  Because I have a bias.
[00:49:20.279 --> 00:49:21.280]  They have a bias, too.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.562]  You need to recognize what their bias is when they're doing this.
[00:49:24.902 --> 00:49:27.725]  And I think it's also interesting to look at the rest of the article here.
[00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:34.210]  They say, it's the elections to the lower House of Parliament which are going to be key to ensuring his party in March.
[00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.730]  Okay?
[00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.852]  E-N-M-A-R-C-H-E.
[00:49:37.212 --> 00:49:39.334]  That literally means move on, folks.
[00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:39.734]  Move on!
[00:49:40.134 --> 00:49:40.935]  That's his party.
[00:49:41.235 --> 00:49:44.519]  It's part of the globalist, the Soros globalist party.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.480]  Move on.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.902]  They translate it into French.
[00:49:47.202 --> 00:49:57.033]  So they say even if he gets a majority, he may be a lame duck president and it may essentially issue in Marine Le Pen five years from now.
[00:49:57.113 --> 00:49:59.275]  So it's very interesting to see how they spend this.
[00:49:59.295 --> 00:50:01.398]  Remember there was an election that I think happened
[00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:03.319]  I don't remember.
[00:50:03.339 --> 00:50:06.821]  I think it was Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:06.861 --> 00:50:11.283]  And those last minute surges in the polls and she had nailed it, convinced all the voters.
[00:50:11.303 --> 00:50:12.744]  Got off work and voted.
[00:50:13.664 --> 00:50:14.925]  And you know that's a key part of it too.
[00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:18.347]  That's another article I've got here from Quartz, a guy named Serge Gallam.
[00:50:18.387 --> 00:50:23.489]  He says, how Marine Le Pen could win even though she is polling lower than 50%?
[00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:32.916]  Look, all of our professional opinion polls, just as we saw with Donald Trump, they're all showing that she is losing 60-40 to Macron.
[00:50:32.936 --> 00:50:36.798]  But he goes, what about the people who are not going to show up?
[00:50:37.399 --> 00:50:38.319]  How do you weight that?
[00:50:38.699 --> 00:50:44.684]  How do you determine, how do you factor in the fact that she has an energized base and he doesn't?
[00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:59.696]  Because one of the things that she said, and it was very true, I thought it hit home, it was singled out at the top of the Drudge Report, the fact that in the debate yesterday, she said, look, this guy is constantly going to Angela Merkel for permission to do everything.
[00:51:00.036 --> 00:51:05.020]  She said, the reality is, you are going to have a France that is going to be ruled by a woman.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.142]  It's either going to be me, or it's going to be Angela Merkel.
[00:51:08.223 --> 00:51:10.905]  And that was right to the point.
[00:51:10.965 --> 00:51:12.406]  That's exactly what's going to be happening.
[00:51:12.586 --> 00:51:16.208]  Right, and so we can see this similar to what we saw in our own election here.
[00:51:16.248 --> 00:51:22.733]  We're seeing that there where they've got their violent protesters out there going against Marine Le Pen's supporters.
[00:51:23.173 --> 00:51:28.937]  Same exact thing that we saw here where they were sending out Bernie Sanders supporters and having them target the Trump supporters.
[00:51:29.517 --> 00:51:56.210]  Supporters and kind of blaming it on the other side But now what we're also seeing prosecutors there in Paris have actually opened up a probe They're wanting to find out if fake news is affecting the French presidential vote and actually Jack Posobiec Was one of the main people that they have targeted I'm sure Paul Joseph Watson as well one of the main people that they have targeted in their algorithms that say look at this is where the main the majority of
[00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:08.066]  People here in France are getting their fake news from, and of course the fake news is anything that is against the establishment order, because really the only fake news is that they're trying to sell Macron as some outsider.
[00:52:08.306 --> 00:52:09.147]  That's fake news!
[00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:13.052]  So the fake news is that it's not Russia that's rigging the election, but it's Jack.
[00:52:14.864 --> 00:52:22.755]  Well, and Obama goes in there as well at the last minute and throws his hat in the ring for his preferred candidate.
[00:52:22.775 --> 00:52:25.458]  I mean, we see how well that went over for Brexit voters.
[00:52:25.759 --> 00:52:29.744]  Well, there's another aspect, another parallel to our election, and of course, remember,
[00:52:30.365 --> 00:52:35.772]  We had Hillary Clinton talking about those people who didn't support her were a basket of deplorables.
[00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:46.285]  Well, he essentially had his own deplorables moment, or I say, I guess we should call it, since it's a French election, the la miserable, you know, call them hateful cowards.
[00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:54.648]  You know, those trashy people, those poor people that are not sharing in the wealth of he and his banker friends.
[00:52:54.928 --> 00:52:55.568]  He says they're here.
[00:52:55.968 --> 00:52:56.628]  It's they.
[00:52:56.988 --> 00:52:59.148]  It's they who are our true enemies.
[00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:01.229]  Powerful, organized, skillful, determined.
[00:53:01.649 --> 00:53:04.089]  You pass them in the streets, on the countryside, or on the web.
[00:53:04.389 --> 00:53:05.670]  Most often, well-hidden.
[00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:11.751]  As hateful as they are cowardly, he said of his opposition, the voters who are energized against him.
[00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:12.431]  Wow!
[00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:49.220]  They put themselves into isolated enclaves or ghettos and that's precisely why George Soros and company want to bring them in.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.963]  They don't want to stop the wars.
[00:53:51.323 --> 00:53:52.685]  They want to keep the wars going.
[00:53:52.705 --> 00:53:55.669]  They want more wars so they can bring in more refugees.
[00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:58.813]  They don't want these people to live in their home peacefully.
[00:53:58.953 --> 00:53:59.934]  Well, and let's think about it.
[00:53:59.954 --> 00:54:07.299]  I mean, France is always basically on the brink of civil unrest because 70 plus percent of the young people there are out of work.
[00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:10.001]  They can't find jobs because of the way the country is set up.
[00:54:10.341 --> 00:54:14.044]  So then you bring in even more people that are going to be competing for these jobs.
[00:54:14.904 --> 00:54:30.545]  Talk about creating division and then the only way that you have to control people is by trying to lay that white guilt on them and call them haters and racists and evil basically deplorables and we see how well that went over when Hillary Clinton pulled that out of her hat.
[00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:31.465]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:33.446]  It really is true.
[00:54:33.506 --> 00:54:49.494]  I mean, when you look at this, when we look at globalism versus nationalism, those of us who are promoting nationalism, we're not, you know, we're supporting the French people who would have self-determination, who would stand up for their culture, for their society, for their laws, for their nation.
[00:54:50.014 --> 00:54:51.435]  It's the globalists who hate all that.
[00:54:51.495 --> 00:54:55.897]  As I said the other day, true multiculturalism is nationalism.
[00:54:56.755 --> 00:54:59.217]  That says that people have a right of self-determination.
[00:54:59.778 --> 00:55:02.900]  They can choose to respect their own culture.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:09.105]  It is the multiculturalists who are trying to homogenize everybody, to eradicate cultures.
[00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:17.773]  And they have certain cultures that they want to bring into the West to eradicate Western culture, Western nations, Western laws, Western society.
[00:55:18.473 --> 00:55:21.214]  So this is a weaponized tool of immigration.
[00:55:21.714 --> 00:55:25.155]  This is not something, they don't have the interests of the refugees at heart.
[00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:27.656]  If they did, they would stop these wars.
[00:55:28.456 --> 00:55:31.117]  You would start to have the left calling for peace.
[00:55:31.157 --> 00:55:33.137]  Do they oppose any of the wars of Obama?
[00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:36.278]  Obama was at war for the entire eight years of his presidency.
[00:55:36.318 --> 00:55:37.119]  First time that's happened.
[00:55:37.559 --> 00:55:39.679]  George Bush tried, but he got a late start.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.401]  And then he was at war with four countries, Obama increased it to seven.
[00:55:44.961 --> 00:55:51.006]  Now we've got the globalist generals, the neocons, and the Trump administration pushing to go to war with two more countries.
[00:55:51.287 --> 00:55:53.488]  We could get it up to nine at once.
[00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:55.730]  Is this insanity?
[00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:58.346]  When are we going to have enough of this?
[00:55:58.426 --> 00:56:00.388]  When are we going to protect our own country?
[00:56:00.728 --> 00:56:02.350]  When are we going to protect our own border?
[00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:07.214]  When are we going to stand up for our own civilization, our own values and culture?
[00:56:07.575 --> 00:56:09.316]  That is what nationalism is about.
[00:56:09.957 --> 00:56:11.919]  And that's why we support the French people.
[00:56:12.399 --> 00:56:13.681]  We want to deal with people.
[00:56:14.021 --> 00:56:15.662]  We want to have trade with people.
[00:56:16.023 --> 00:56:18.665]  We want to do it, however, on a bilateral basis.
[00:56:19.446 --> 00:56:33.556]  Not create these supranational organizations that are a stepping stone to a one world government, a homogenized dictatorship that eradicates cultures, that eradicates civilization, that eradicates our laws.
[00:56:34.176 --> 00:56:34.937]  We don't want that.
[00:56:35.357 --> 00:56:37.459]  We want true multiculturalism.
[00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:38.880]  That's what nationalism truly is.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:39.720]  Right.
[00:56:40.581 --> 00:56:41.722]  I think it's just incredible.
[00:56:42.335 --> 00:56:47.581]  Well, you know, we've also had Obamacare, a movement against Obamacare today with the House.
[00:56:47.601 --> 00:56:49.443]  We're going to take a look at that bill.
[00:56:49.463 --> 00:56:51.926]  We're really close to the top of the hour, so we're going to take a break.
[00:56:51.946 --> 00:56:58.493]  And when we come back, we're going to look at Obamacare, or I guess we should call it now Trumpcare, or Ryancare.
[00:56:58.513 --> 00:56:59.374]  They're celebrating.
[00:56:59.574 --> 00:57:00.215]  Or Fedcare.
[00:57:00.235 --> 00:57:01.116]  Maybe we should call it Fedcare.
[00:57:01.136 --> 00:57:01.817]  Making its way to the Senate.
[00:57:02.117 --> 00:57:04.398]  Do you think the Fed cares about your health care?
[00:57:04.719 --> 00:57:05.999]  Well, we're going to tell you what's here.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:10.842]  Certainly, it is not what I would want to see, but it is far better than what we currently have.
[00:57:10.962 --> 00:57:14.425]  It is far better than anything we would have gotten with Hillary.
[00:57:14.505 --> 00:57:16.026]  She would have made things far worse.
[00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.867]  Obama did enough to make it bad.
[00:57:18.967 --> 00:57:23.190]  So this is an improvement, I believe, if this passes through the Senate.
[00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.691]  I think this is an improvement.
[00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:30.275]  Over Hillarycare, but it is certainly not a replacement of it.
[00:57:30.395 --> 00:57:31.937]  It's not a repeal of it, I should say.
[00:57:31.997 --> 00:57:37.041]  It's more of a managing it around the edges, to try to make it more manageable.
[00:57:37.161 --> 00:57:38.382]  That's what really concerns me.
[00:57:38.442 --> 00:57:50.071]  I do not want to see the principle that government will dictate and control our healthcare, even if they use a lighter hand during Republican administrations than they use during Democrat administrations.
[00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:51.072]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[00:57:51.652 --> 00:57:58.197]  And so we're going to talk about the lifting of this burden a little bit, but of course the structure is going to remain there.
[00:57:58.217 --> 00:58:12.747]  It's kind of like we're stuck with the income tax in the IRS and occasionally we might have somebody who will lighten the burden of that structure for us, but they're not going to get rid of it and take us back to the Constitution or take us back to a real budget.
[00:58:12.767 --> 00:58:14.288]  We're going to continue to have deficits.
[00:58:14.628 --> 00:58:31.265]  So we're going to take a quick break, and again, I want to thank you for your support, remind you that we have discounts from 20 to 30 to 33% on Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, 30% on Brain Force, 20% on, let's see, Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[00:58:31.465 --> 00:58:31.926]  Do we have that?
[00:58:32.666 --> 00:58:34.628]  No, it's actually the Super 12, vitamin B12.
[00:58:34.728 --> 00:58:36.670]  I'm not sure if the nascent iodine is on discount.
[00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:44.579]  There's a wide variety of products that you can see there at InfoWarsStore.com that are on sale, so we appreciate your support.
[00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:52.507]  We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and talk about the health care bill that passed the Republican-controlled House today.
[00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.924]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:06.984]  I try to have a good time.
[00:59:07.605 --> 00:59:08.766]  I'm a happy person overall.
[00:59:09.626 --> 00:59:17.112]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[00:59:18.113 --> 00:59:22.797]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[00:59:23.778 --> 00:59:26.620]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.241]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[00:59:29.298 --> 00:59:40.248]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:44.852]  Now, I never started Infowars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[00:59:45.112 --> 00:59:46.554]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[00:59:47.765 --> 00:59:55.070]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[00:59:55.711 --> 01:00:00.834]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[01:00:01.415 --> 01:00:10.922]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:18.725]  Wednesday, May 3rd, and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:19.625]  on Wednesday.
[01:00:20.645 --> 01:00:25.267]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[01:00:25.947 --> 01:00:31.329]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:43.292]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:46.233]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[01:00:46.573 --> 01:00:48.213]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.634]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[01:00:51.034 --> 01:00:55.956]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[01:00:56.216 --> 01:01:00.997]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[01:01:01.974 --> 01:01:04.356]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:08.459]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:09.020]  That's the goal.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.262]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[01:01:11.342 --> 01:01:11.562]  No.
[01:01:11.982 --> 01:01:17.507]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:21.930]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[01:01:22.771 --> 01:01:23.051]  Thank you.
[01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:40.389]  Also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:51.013]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[01:01:51.493 --> 01:02:05.938]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[01:02:06.398 --> 01:02:11.019]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:16.721]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[01:02:16.741 --> 01:02:18.381]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[01:02:18.641 --> 01:02:24.823]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[01:02:25.223 --> 01:02:35.326]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[01:02:35.806 --> 01:02:38.347]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[01:02:38.827 --> 01:02:41.767]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[01:02:42.147 --> 01:02:48.629]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:54.630]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.830]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.711]  They see the lies.
[01:02:58.031 --> 01:02:59.111]  They see the demonization.
[01:02:59.891 --> 01:03:03.652]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:14.024]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[01:03:14.404 --> 01:03:25.267]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[01:03:25.687 --> 01:03:30.809]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:35.332]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.
[01:03:35.472 --> 01:03:40.517]  Products you need, products that fund our operation, so that we can then expose the globalist program.
[01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:42.519]  It's a total 360 win.
[01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:45.602]  A limited time, DNA Force is now back in stock.

[01:04:03.952 --> 01:04:07.613]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[01:04:07.913 --> 01:04:09.674]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:14.136]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[01:04:14.196 --> 01:04:15.736]  And then finally, let me see if it's still here.
[01:04:15.876 --> 01:04:16.136]  It is.
[01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:18.977]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:22.639]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:28.321]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[01:04:28.661 --> 01:04:29.541]  It's concentrated.
[01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:32.403]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[01:04:32.643 --> 01:04:35.784]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:36.624]  It's amazing.
[01:04:36.984 --> 01:04:38.565]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip,
[01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:40.586]  You get an additional 10% off.
[01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:41.286]  It's a win-win.
[01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:45.587]  You remember to support us each month or every two months or every three months, however you sign up.
[01:04:45.988 --> 01:04:56.832]  You can cancel anytime and you can get 10% off and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[01:04:57.052 --> 01:04:58.592]  These are great renewable resources.
[01:04:58.912 --> 01:05:00.293]  Please continue to support us again.
[01:05:01.457 --> 01:05:02.558]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:05:02.618 --> 01:05:03.258]  I'm determined.
[01:05:03.338 --> 01:05:03.878]  I'm focused.
[01:05:04.399 --> 01:05:12.223]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[01:05:12.623 --> 01:05:14.384]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[01:05:16.032 --> 01:05:16.953]  Turn it up a notch?
[01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:21.117]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[01:05:21.437 --> 01:05:23.719]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[01:05:23.959 --> 01:05:25.121]  We want to go to the stars.
[01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:26.742]  Look how far we've already come.
[01:05:27.002 --> 01:05:28.724]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[01:05:29.004 --> 01:05:31.987]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[01:05:32.247 --> 01:05:35.250]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:39.694]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[01:05:39.994 --> 01:05:41.236]  And let's take action.
[01:05:41.736 --> 01:05:49.773]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:51.316]  But regardless of what you do...
[01:05:52.319 --> 01:06:02.726]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news and the daily show I do and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[01:06:02.746 --> 01:06:08.089]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:16.815]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[01:06:17.175 --> 01:06:19.617]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:06:19.917 --> 01:06:21.158]  Please spread that link.
[01:06:24.062 --> 01:06:25.783]  Alright, welcome back to our live broadcast.
[01:06:25.883 --> 01:06:31.567]  I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo and we have some breaking news, don't we Leanne, about defunding Planned Parenthood.
[01:06:31.848 --> 01:06:33.008]  I didn't think this was going to happen.
[01:06:33.028 --> 01:06:34.589]  I'm really surprised to see this happen.
[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:36.511]  Tell us about the vote that just occurred.
[01:06:36.651 --> 01:06:41.594]  Right, so of course the first attempt to do this failed because it wasn't a complete repeal of Obamacare.
[01:06:41.614 --> 01:06:42.895]  They kind of reworded everything.
[01:06:43.296 --> 01:06:48.960]  So now House Republicans today voted to approve the bill that would defund Planned Parenthood.
[01:06:50.361 --> 01:06:55.265]  The vote was 217 to 212 for this bill to defund Planned Parenthood.
[01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:58.247]  Zero Democrats voted for it.
[01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.168]  Very close.
[01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:02.390]  All the Democrats, folks, voted to kill babies.
[01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.432]  Do you think I'm over the top when I say voted to kill babies?
[01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.755]  Let me tell you what Planned Parenthood itself said in 1952.
[01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:11.177]  I reported this earlier today.
[01:07:11.717 --> 01:07:13.299]  A Planned Parenthood flyer.
[01:07:14.279 --> 01:07:21.223]  Once advertised, potential clients told them that abortion, quote, kills the life of a baby, unquote.
[01:07:21.423 --> 01:07:23.544]  That's Planned Parenthood in 1952.
[01:07:24.745 --> 01:07:25.946]  When Margaret Sanger was around.
[01:07:25.966 --> 01:07:26.586]  Margaret Sanger.
[01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:29.488]  And Margaret Sanger created this organization.
[01:07:30.048 --> 01:07:31.589]  She had the Negro Project.
[01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:33.110]  She was a eugenicist.
[01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:35.511]  She wanted to reduce the number of black people.
[01:07:36.231 --> 01:07:38.173]  She created Birth Control Review.
[01:07:38.694 --> 01:07:40.795]  All of this stuff we've talked about about Margaret Singer.
[01:07:40.835 --> 01:07:42.297]  I'm not a Margaret Singer fan.
[01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:49.903]  However, Margaret Singer repeatedly said that abortion was murder, that abortion was not birth control.
[01:07:50.564 --> 01:08:01.214]  Margaret Singer, and this is a New American article, you can take a look at this and get the detail, considered abortion to be an alternative to birth control, not simply another form of birth control.
[01:08:01.274 --> 01:08:02.375]  And she wrote this, quote,
[01:08:03.015 --> 01:08:06.039]  It is an alternative that I cannot too strongly condemn.
[01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:13.428]  She would later declare abortion immoral because, quote, no matter how early it was performed, it was taking life.
[01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.652]  So she said, I can't condemn it too strongly.
[01:08:17.233 --> 01:08:18.955]  She was not in favor of abortion.
[01:08:19.455 --> 01:08:20.896]  Even though she was a eugenicist.
[01:08:21.456 --> 01:08:24.118]  So she said that it was taking of a human life.
[01:08:24.378 --> 01:08:30.761]  We have flyers from 1952 where Planned Parenthood says that abortion kills the life of a baby.
[01:08:31.322 --> 01:08:35.464]  And we have protesters, as I pointed out earlier today, who said, I kill my baby.
[01:08:35.524 --> 01:08:36.965]  They know precisely what they're doing.
[01:08:37.265 --> 01:08:38.386]  They fooled me for a while.
[01:08:39.066 --> 01:08:42.248]  I'm part of that generation that was listening to Roe v. Wade.
[01:08:43.291 --> 01:08:45.734]  And said, OK, well, you know, I'm a libertarian.
[01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:50.779]  I want people to be able to... It's kind of... I'm not sure when life begins and so forth and so on.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.222]  Until I was running for Congress.
[01:08:53.543 --> 01:08:55.545]  And I had to look at the issue more closely.
[01:08:55.585 --> 01:08:58.448]  And at that time, they were selling partial birth abortion.
[01:08:58.828 --> 01:08:59.990]  What is partial birth abortion?
[01:09:00.714 --> 01:09:01.734]  And I looked at the procedure.
[01:09:02.335 --> 01:09:04.155]  And I said, this is nothing but murder.
[01:09:04.355 --> 01:09:05.736]  This is a full-term baby.
[01:09:05.936 --> 01:09:19.582]  They're pretending the baby has not been born because a bit of the baby, you know, the foot or the top of the head or whatever is still in the mother and they pretend that they can kill this baby, this full-term baby who can survive on its own.
[01:09:20.562 --> 01:09:21.602]  I said, that is murder.
[01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:24.544]  If they're lying to me about that, they're lying to me about the rest of the stuff.
[01:09:25.504 --> 01:09:28.925]  Right, and didn't you say they didn't even actually perform the first abortion there?
[01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.066]  That's right, that's very important.
[01:09:30.506 --> 01:09:31.606]  That's a good point Leanne.
[01:09:31.766 --> 01:09:35.868]  This article points out that Sanger, Margaret Sanger, died in 1966.
[01:09:36.748 --> 01:09:40.809]  They did not have the first abortion by Planned Parenthood until 1970.
[01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:46.232]  Four years later, and it was done in Syracuse, New York.
[01:09:46.572 --> 01:09:49.373]  That was the first time Planned Parenthood had an abortion.
[01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:53.316]  Then, they had Roe v. Wade in 1974.
[01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:57.738]  In 1976, they were performing then 70,000 abortions a year.
[01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:03.641]  So within six years, two years after Roe v. Wade, they only had a single abortion in 1970, their very first.
[01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:09.185]  Then within six years, two years after Roe v. Wade, there are up to 70,000 abortions a year.
[01:10:09.265 --> 01:10:12.547]  Now, there are up to 320,000 abortions a year.
[01:10:12.828 --> 01:10:15.990]  They perform 35% of all the abortions in the United States.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:24.176]  And as I said earlier today, there's about 3,000 children, babies, murdered every day with abortion.
[01:10:24.476 --> 01:10:28.880]  And that's equivalent to having a September 11th every single day.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.282]  And we're not paying any attention to that at all.
[01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:33.985]  We're not reorganizing our society around that, are we?
[01:10:34.245 --> 01:10:35.706]  And yet, you're talking about this bill.
[01:10:36.687 --> 01:10:40.311]  What they did with that, they didn't cut funding for women's health.
[01:10:41.072 --> 01:10:42.473]  That's the lie of the Democrats.
[01:10:42.533 --> 01:10:45.716]  They redistributed it to places that do not kill babies.
[01:10:45.856 --> 01:10:47.278]  That's where you can go for your help.
[01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:48.159]  Right, exactly.
[01:10:48.199 --> 01:10:50.602]  Because that's the big argument that they made this entire time.
[01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:53.345]  That so many low-income people have to go to Planned Parenthood.
[01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:56.169]  It's the only place they can go for birth control or mammograms.
[01:10:56.569 --> 01:11:00.474]  Things that they don't even perform at the majority of Planned Parenthood clinics.
[01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:02.877]  Because people called and they said, well we don't do that here.
[01:11:02.937 --> 01:11:03.998]  We only do abortions.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:13.210]  So this bill is going to eliminate 86% of the federal funding, so that's almost $400 million that's going to Planned Parenthood.
[01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:20.159]  And what they're going to do is redirect the funding to community health centers, which outnumber Planned Parenthood 20 to 1.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.363]  So they also offer a wider array of health care services.
[01:11:24.663 --> 01:11:30.308]  So these are facilities that people have been making the argument there are plenty of community clinics in these towns.
[01:11:30.448 --> 01:11:32.350]  They need some federal funding as well.
[01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:36.694]  It's all going to these mandatory spending programs like Planned Parenthood.
[01:11:36.774 --> 01:11:43.220]  And so they're going to redirect it and this is now going to make its way to the Senate.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.041]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.783]  And we just cannot stress this enough.
[01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:52.811]  We cannot survive as a civilization if we murder the most innocent and helpless among ourselves, okay?
[01:11:53.551 --> 01:12:00.719]  My wife worked as a volunteer for Birth Choice years ago and I told her, I said, people need to understand what's involved here.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.502]  And they, I think, will if they can see what's going on.
[01:12:04.522 --> 01:12:12.648]  And of course, it's interesting to see that in 1952, Planned Parenthood was telling people that went to their clinic that they were taking the life of a baby.
[01:12:12.908 --> 01:12:14.769]  It kills the life of a baby, is what they said.
[01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.930]  And there are flyers.
[01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.432]  And so, people need to understand that.
[01:12:18.472 --> 01:12:25.356]  I said, I think that everybody that's trying to convince kids, what they ought to do, the pro-life people at the time, this is like 25 years ago,
[01:12:26.966 --> 01:12:27.226]  I think?
[01:12:46.312 --> 01:12:57.142]  Organizations like Scientific American and National Geographic have shown pictures and movies of babies in the womb of other species.
[01:12:57.402 --> 01:12:59.604]  We see dogs in the womb.
[01:12:59.624 --> 01:13:01.245]  We see dolphins.
[01:13:01.325 --> 01:13:03.087]  We see all these different animals.
[01:13:03.167 --> 01:13:04.308]  I said, look at how detailed it is.
[01:13:04.328 --> 01:13:06.050]  It's just like a little dog.
[01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.331]  It is a little dog.
[01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:10.432]  And you can see the same thing with the human babies.
[01:13:10.472 --> 01:13:16.575]  You can see them interacting and playing and they have fingerprints and they have a heartbeat and they have a separate sex half the time.
[01:13:17.036 --> 01:13:19.117]  They are separate individual babies.
[01:13:19.137 --> 01:13:20.838]  Right, their own blood type.
[01:13:20.898 --> 01:13:22.318]  Yeah, their own blood type even.
[01:13:22.358 --> 01:13:23.059]  Yeah, than the mother.
[01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:25.380]  So it is not an extension of the mother.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.301]  It is not something that can be just discarded.
[01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:29.882]  So we have to inform people.
[01:13:30.262 --> 01:13:31.183]  There's a lot of ignorance.
[01:13:32.003 --> 01:13:36.192]  And I think that the 4D ultrasounds are going to be very important to that in the future.
[01:13:36.793 --> 01:13:40.741]  But they knew back in 1952, they knew they were taking a human life.
[01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:41.843]  Shame on them.
[01:13:41.864 --> 01:13:42.365]  Shame on them.
[01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:46.005]  And that's the thing that's so interesting when you say people need to understand.
[01:13:46.145 --> 01:13:47.946]  Things like that get memory hold.
[01:13:48.566 --> 01:13:52.687]  Just like we are seeing now with this Netflix editing out the Bill Nye episode.
[01:13:53.088 --> 01:13:57.689]  Just the segment in the episode where he says chromosomes determine gender.
[01:13:58.169 --> 01:14:05.312]  They took that out and it's unknown if they took that out after all this backlash where people are going, well wow Bill Nye, all of a sudden you're talking about
[01:14:06.252 --> 01:14:11.337]  Your sex junk and the gender spectrum, but didn't you used to say chromosomes determine gender?
[01:14:12.178 --> 01:14:16.843]  Just miraculously, that portion of the video is now gone out of the Netflix series.
[01:14:16.863 --> 01:14:19.646]  I'm sure you can still find it on YouTube, but this is it.
[01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:24.191]  It's just a whole rewriting of history, a revision of science.
[01:14:24.511 --> 01:14:26.912]  As I say, he's not a scientist, but he plays one on television.
[01:14:26.952 --> 01:14:27.093]  Right.
[01:14:27.113 --> 01:14:33.676]  And he wears his little bow tie, he does his Pee Wee Herman impersonation, and supposedly being a nerd makes you a scientist.
[01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:34.517]  No, it doesn't.
[01:14:34.597 --> 01:14:35.597]  It doesn't make you a scientist.
[01:14:35.617 --> 01:14:39.380]  Let's talk about the movement with Obamacare today.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.602]  And of course we had the American Health Care Act.
[01:14:44.823 --> 01:14:45.683]  AHCA.
[01:14:45.743 --> 01:14:47.104]  The same as Obama.
[01:14:47.264 --> 01:14:51.427]  You know, with Obama, it wasn't the American Health Care Act, it was the Affordable Health Care Act.
[01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:54.989]  Nobody believes it's affordable anymore, so they called it the American Health Care Act.
[01:14:55.049 --> 01:14:59.472]  And hopefully, it's going to be more of a change than just changing one word.
[01:14:59.552 --> 01:15:00.433]  There are some changes.
[01:15:00.453 --> 01:15:01.674]  We're going to talk to you about it.
[01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:03.755]  But here's what I would have done.
[01:15:04.355 --> 01:15:05.196]  Here's what I would have done.
[01:15:05.396 --> 01:15:14.202]  If I was somebody putting this together, if I was Paul Ryan, or if I was Donald Trump, I would have replaced it by saying the power is not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.
[01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:20.783]  Nor prohibited to it by the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
[01:15:20.903 --> 01:15:22.404]  In other words, the Tenth Amendment.
[01:15:22.804 --> 01:15:29.126]  I would have said, we've got a Constitution, you can't hold a gun to somebody's head and force them to buy your mandated insurance policy.
[01:15:29.486 --> 01:15:35.468]  And they're fighting within the Republican Party as to whether or not they're going to extend the Tenth Amendment to state government.
[01:15:35.509 --> 01:15:36.469]  Certainly, forget about
[01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:40.130]  People having a choice as to what they're going to buy in their insurance policy.
[01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:46.352]  They're fighting about whether or not they're going to allow individual states to opt out of their mandate.
[01:15:46.412 --> 01:15:51.354]  So whether it's Obamacare, or whether it is Ryancare, or whether it is Trumpcare,
[01:15:52.054 --> 01:15:53.315]  It is still Fed care.
[01:15:53.775 --> 01:16:04.662]  And the federal government has no authority under the Constitution if we want to, again, I just want to point out that we don't have a government that pays any attention to the Constitution, to the clear wording of the Constitution.
[01:16:04.882 --> 01:16:06.743]  They have no authority to force us to do this.
[01:16:07.103 --> 01:16:14.048]  And you are not going to get affordable health care if you have mandates instead of marketplaces.
[01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:18.011]  You're not going to have affordable health care if you have coercion instead of choice.
[01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:27.818]  You're not going to have it if you take away the mechanism that has given us advances, that has given us lower costs, and it has.
[01:16:28.319 --> 01:16:29.460]  Our increasing cost
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.362]  And healthcare is just like our increasing cost in education.
[01:16:33.762 --> 01:16:36.124]  It's increasing because it was subsidized.
[01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:38.305]  And because of the insurance structure that we got there.
[01:16:38.345 --> 01:16:39.586]  Not because we had a free market.
[01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:40.887]  We had a free market before.
[01:16:41.327 --> 01:16:46.771]  It started to explode in cost once we started putting insurance companies and their third party payers.
[01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:51.434]  But I just want to say, we have Jimmy Kimmel out there.
[01:16:52.406 --> 01:16:56.567]  With his lies and his deceptions, it was really reprehensible what he did.
[01:16:57.128 --> 01:17:07.231]  Talking about his son, his infant son, who needed open heart surgery, and saying that if they did away with pre-existing condition, then poor people would not have open heart surgery for their children.
[01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:09.092]  That was a blatant lie.
[01:17:09.652 --> 01:17:10.512]  A blatant lie.
[01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:11.353]  Even if
[01:17:12.193 --> 01:17:18.559]  You didn't have parents who had insurance coverage, and of course, he's wealthy enough that he could, that he has insurance coverage.
[01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:20.881]  He's wealthy enough he could have paid for it out of pocket.
[01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:35.735]  And the reality is, is that at that same hospital, that Ben Shapiro talked about this, conservative commentator, he said, my child had, as an infant, that same surgery, at that same hospital, with that same doctor.
[01:17:36.638 --> 01:17:39.219]  And it is a private charity hospital.
[01:17:39.499 --> 01:17:39.799]  Wow.
[01:17:39.839 --> 01:17:41.939]  Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.
[01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:44.260]  They have a $233 million budget.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:52.242]  And instead of Jimmy Kimmel saying, I am so grateful that we have people who will voluntarily help those who need help.
[01:17:52.822 --> 01:17:54.782]  And there are people who need help with their health care.
[01:17:55.042 --> 01:18:02.084]  And there are structures that have been there well before Obamacare to take care of the poor and indigent who cannot afford health care.
[01:18:02.364 --> 01:18:05.065]  That's the purpose of that hospital, the Children's Hospital of L.A.
[01:18:05.885 --> 01:18:06.645]  That's their purpose.
[01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:10.867]  And instead of writing a check to them in gratitude, what does Jimmy Kimmel do?
[01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:16.209]  He lies and turns this into propaganda for a system of theft.
[01:18:17.129 --> 01:18:19.410]  This is funded by theft, folks.
[01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:22.091]  Jerome Corsi's been talking about this since February.
[01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.352]  There's another easy way, besides the 10th Amendment, to get rid of Obamacare.
[01:18:25.573 --> 01:18:32.195]  And that is to say that you're going to stop the Justice Department from fighting to keep this theft going.
[01:18:32.235 --> 01:18:33.976]  They have a court case called Burwell.
[01:18:34.716 --> 01:18:37.177]  This was never funded by the Congress.
[01:18:37.217 --> 01:18:42.599]  Instead, what they did was they stole the money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors.
[01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:46.640]  They robbed Fannie and Freddie to pay Hillary and Barry.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.641]  It's a theft, just like in Venezuela.
[01:18:49.861 --> 01:18:51.581]  And so you can stop that right now.
[01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:53.102]  You can stop that theft.
[01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:56.543]  They want to talk about the 24 million people who have health care.
[01:18:56.843 --> 01:19:02.005]  Well, they have that health care because they're stealing from investors who were lied to by the federal government.
[01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:06.147]  And these are not fat cat investors necessarily.
[01:19:06.887 --> 01:19:07.908]  It's you maybe.
[01:19:08.268 --> 01:19:08.849]  Your neighbors.
[01:19:09.069 --> 01:19:12.591]  Small individual investors can invest in Freddie and Fannie as well.
[01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:15.272]  So you don't have to be a wealthy individual to invest in that.
[01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:17.553]  People invest into that in pools.
[01:19:17.834 --> 01:19:19.635]  You have to understand you're going to have rationing.
[01:19:20.195 --> 01:19:25.098]  And that rationing is either going to be done by economic means or it's going to be done by political means.
[01:19:25.658 --> 01:19:31.202]  If it is done by political means, you're going to have lines and you're going to have kind of a TSA health care.
[01:19:31.462 --> 01:19:39.148]  If it is done by economic means, then you're going to have reforms, if you've got a free market reform, you're going to have reforms that are going to help people to get that health care.
[01:19:39.468 --> 01:19:44.752]  So, in general, I really reject the idea that the federal government should be at all involved in health care.
[01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:46.493]  They shouldn't be involved in education either.
[01:19:46.553 --> 01:19:49.776]  There's so many different things that the federal government should not be involved in.
[01:19:49.896 --> 01:19:54.999]  I hate to see us just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic when we're still headed for the iceberg.
[01:19:55.019 --> 01:19:56.781]  We don't have a budget.
[01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.383]  We have an increasing deficit.
[01:20:00.049 --> 01:20:02.311]  We don't have an Office of Management and Budget.
[01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.592]  They're not managing anything.
[01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.793]  They don't have a budget.
[01:20:04.993 --> 01:20:10.517]  They just continue to increase the debt because they continue to run a deficit every year.
[01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:16.382]  So when they talk about this continuing resolution and the fact that we're now $20 trillion in debt, that's not getting us anywhere.
[01:20:16.442 --> 01:20:18.283]  But we'll get to some of the details.
[01:20:18.444 --> 01:20:20.105]  Just your comments on my rant.
[01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:27.130]  I mean that's a great rant and it's true if they hadn't have stolen money from Fannie and Freddie then it would have completely collapsed.
[01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:30.552]  Obamacare would have been a total failure that it was supposed to be.
[01:20:30.572 --> 01:20:41.520]  I mean what did they get up to a billion dollars on that failed website that had all those kinks in it and lost all people's information to the ether and it would have totally collapsed.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.323]  And then, of course, now they're making the argument, oh, well, we don't want to, we want to avoid a government shutdown.
[01:20:46.563 --> 01:20:47.824]  Let the government shut down.
[01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:48.024]  Yes.
[01:20:48.084 --> 01:20:53.208]  We know it's only going to be those, the agencies that are just kind of extraneous agencies anyway that we don't need.
[01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:54.168]  Let it shut down.
[01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:54.869]  We might actually go down.
[01:20:54.889 --> 01:20:55.929]  Non-essential agencies.
[01:20:56.270 --> 01:21:00.112]  Why do we worry about funding non-essential agencies in the first place?
[01:21:00.492 --> 01:21:02.674]  I want to see the government shut down from our health care.
[01:21:02.934 --> 01:21:05.376]  I want to see the government shut down from our education.
[01:21:05.796 --> 01:21:09.759]  We can fund it at the local level because we need to control it at the local level.
[01:21:09.799 --> 01:21:11.560]  We need to control our health care ourselves.
[01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:14.004]  It's only been a couple of years that we've had this.
[01:21:14.064 --> 01:21:15.306]  Why is this ingrained?
[01:21:15.346 --> 01:21:18.251]  Why has this become a third rail like Social Security?
[01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.253]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:21:19.313 --> 01:21:21.016]  Okay, so what is in this bill?
[01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:32.023]  As we read earlier today, Representative Tom Garrett, who was kind of on the fence at the time, I don't know which way he went, he's a Republican from Virginia, he said he doesn't know how many of his fellow lawmakers had read this.
[01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:42.692]  He said when he was asked today, he said, well let me put it this way, people in my office have read, some people in my office have read all parts of the bill, but I don't think any individual has read the whole bill.
[01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:46.535]  So I guess you can fool some of the people with some of the bill.
[01:21:46.795 --> 01:21:49.098]  Some of the time, but you can't fool all the people with all the bill.
[01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:51.602]  I guess that's what we would have to say to paraphrase that.
[01:21:51.923 --> 01:21:56.589]  So we don't really know exactly what's on this bill, but we can give you a broad sense of it.
[01:21:56.630 --> 01:22:01.477]  The devil is going to be in the details, but let's tell you a little bit about the sense of what's going on with this.
[01:22:02.788 --> 01:22:12.875]  Right now we've got articles mainly from mainstream media that is opposed to any adjustment to the government's move towards a single-payer system because that's where this is all headed.
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.797]  So we've got some information here from CNN and Washington Post.
[01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:19.179]  So we'll try to read between the lines as to what's really going on here.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:26.704]  And of course the first thing they say is it would erase the coverage gains of the last few years and leave 24 million more people uninsured by 2026.
[01:22:26.804 --> 01:22:31.508]  Okay, well, again, those people got their insurance.
[01:22:32.088 --> 01:22:32.749]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.688 --> 01:23:11.473]  They are going to, instead of offering a stick and saying, you're going to have a mandate, you've got to buy into this insurance policy, they're going to offer you a carrot.
[01:23:12.094 --> 01:23:22.800]  So they're going to remove the mandate and they're going to say, if you buy your insurance, we're going to give you a carrot and we're going to allow you to take a tax credit, not a deduction.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.020]  But a tax credit.
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:28.883]  You understand that if you have a deduction, that is before you figure your taxes.
[01:23:28.943 --> 01:23:38.127]  So if you've got a deduction and you're in a 10% tax bracket, then that means that only 10% of that deduction is actually going to result in a dollar for dollar savings.
[01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:41.068]  So if you've got a $100 deduction and a 10% tax bracket, you're going to save $10 in taxes.
[01:23:42.369 --> 01:23:48.410]  If it's a tax credit and you take a $100 tax credit, that saves you $100 in your taxes.
[01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:51.851]  Now those credits are going to be based on people's ages.
[01:23:52.271 --> 01:24:00.413]  So the younger you are, the less of a credit you're going to get because insurance companies are going to charge you less as a younger person than they're going to charge you for insurance if you're older.
[01:24:00.773 --> 01:24:03.514]  So it's going to go from $2,000 to people that are in their 20s to $4,000 for those who are in their 60s, for example.
[01:24:07.455 --> 01:24:11.798]  Then they're going to adjust that down based on your income level.
[01:24:11.878 --> 01:24:16.200]  So once you get up to certain income levels, they're going to start phasing out those tax credits.
[01:24:16.581 --> 01:24:19.142]  They're also going to have health savings accounts.
[01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:23.525]  Again, an incentive rather than a mandate or a stick.
[01:24:23.865 --> 01:24:24.185]  Okay?
[01:24:24.205 --> 01:24:26.927]  So they're going to try to encourage you to do this rather than put that in there.
[01:24:26.947 --> 01:24:28.568]  And I've got to say, when we look at the tax code,
[01:24:29.554 --> 01:24:37.239]  The government, I thought it was the height of hypocrisy for the government to talk about the unaffordability of health care.
[01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:42.282]  At the same time, they would not even allow you to deduct unless you itemized.
[01:24:42.322 --> 01:24:44.424]  You couldn't deduct any of your health care costs.
[01:24:44.464 --> 01:24:55.371]  And even if you itemized, they would deduct, I think it was the first 10%, if I remember correctly, the first 10% of your adjusted gross income would be removed from your health care deductions.
[01:24:55.411 --> 01:24:56.572]  And then what you had left
[01:24:57.032 --> 01:24:57.432]  We're good to go.
[01:25:26.952 --> 01:25:37.899]  Understand that if we're going to say that the insurance companies have to insure pre-existing conditions, that's like saying that you can have car insurance that you can buy after you have an accident.
[01:25:38.905 --> 01:25:39.806]  That's not insurance.
[01:25:40.086 --> 01:25:41.427]  That's an entitlement program.
[01:25:41.487 --> 01:25:42.528]  That's a welfare program.
[01:25:42.548 --> 01:25:43.809]  So just call it what it is.
[01:25:43.929 --> 01:25:48.053]  It's an entitlement program, it's a welfare program, it's a mandate on the insurance companies.
[01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:52.437]  But it is not insurance if you're going to force them to do pre-existing insurance.
[01:25:52.477 --> 01:25:58.742]  Now what they've done again is they've offered a stick to try to get people to sign up for that.
[01:25:59.383 --> 01:26:06.268]  If you do not sign up, you can still get insurance coverage, but if you have a lapse, the insurance
[01:26:06.949 --> 01:26:14.452]  Companies would be able to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums if you let it lapse for 63 days.
[01:26:15.132 --> 01:26:18.894]  And then they would be able to levy this 30% surcharge for one year.
[01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.975]  But they would still have to cover you with a pre-existing condition.
[01:26:22.015 --> 01:26:24.957]  You see how screwed up this is when the federal government gets involved in it?
[01:26:25.217 --> 01:26:29.218]  They start creating these artificial, you know, 63 days.
[01:26:29.498 --> 01:26:32.760]  Oh, you couldn't pay for 63 days at a surcharge.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.867]  So that's the kind of situation that we get into when the government starts mandating this from Washington.
[01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.690]  So I don't like seeing that.
[01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:49.942]  And when we look at some of the things that are going out, they're taking out taxes on insurance companies, taxes on drug makers, because you know that doesn't make health care more affordable, does it?
[01:26:50.282 --> 01:26:55.507]  When you start taxing medical devices, that makes medical expenses go up.
[01:26:55.967 --> 01:26:57.269]  So it doesn't make it more affordable.
[01:26:57.389 --> 01:26:59.551]  So some of that makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:04.235]  But they're concerned because they're taking away the subsidies that were really not subsidies.
[01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:08.319]  They were really theft because they were sweeping this out of Fannie and Freddie.
[01:27:08.359 --> 01:27:09.720]  So that would be an important thing.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.983]  But it is important that they're getting rid of the mandate.
[01:27:12.023 --> 01:27:13.084]  So it's kind of like
[01:27:13.885 --> 01:27:21.294]  We were hoping that we might and we voted for somebody who would get rid of the income tax and abolish the IRS.
[01:27:21.574 --> 01:27:28.062]  We used to say that when we ran for office in the Libertarian Party and then of course we had some Republican candidates who said that as well.
[01:27:29.093 --> 01:27:32.796]  But we voted for that and instead what we get is an adjustment of the tax rates.
[01:27:32.896 --> 01:27:34.337]  That's what we're seeing now with Obamacare.
[01:27:34.377 --> 01:27:35.558]  We've wanted it repealed.
[01:27:36.078 --> 01:27:36.758]  Just get it out of here.
[01:27:36.939 --> 01:27:38.640]  It's none of the business of the federal government.
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:39.760]  It's not their business.
[01:27:40.341 --> 01:27:42.222]  They shouldn't be involved in this one way or the other.
[01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:44.664]  And instead what we got was a little bit of relief.
[01:27:44.844 --> 01:27:48.727]  We got an adjustment of the rates at which they're going to tax us.
[01:27:48.747 --> 01:27:52.950]  We got an adjustment and a little bit of reprieve from the mandates that they've given us.
[01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:54.912]  And then quite frankly, it's not enough.
[01:27:55.072 --> 01:27:56.293]  I don't feel like celebrating.
[01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.134]  I understand that they got this thing through.
[01:27:58.174 --> 01:28:01.397]  It's the first time that Trump and the Republicans have been able to pass something.
[01:28:02.905 --> 01:28:10.110]  But it's kind of like, you know, okay, so the Lions beat the Tigers, and so we're all going to have a pep rally in the Rose Garden.
[01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:11.891]  I can't get excited about that.
[01:28:12.271 --> 01:28:14.312]  I still want to see this repealed.
[01:28:14.592 --> 01:28:16.394]  I still want to see the federal government out of this business.
[01:28:16.474 --> 01:28:16.674]  Right.
[01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:21.657]  It's a little too early to celebrate, but they all seemed very pleased with themselves at the press conference today.
[01:28:21.937 --> 01:28:22.097]  Yeah.
[01:28:22.377 --> 01:28:26.480]  It is something, and it is better than we would have gotten, far better than we would have gotten from Hillary Clinton.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.600]  She would have made things far worse.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.120]  Absolutely.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:31.362]  But that is setting the bar so incredibly low.
[01:28:31.702 --> 01:28:34.204]  So incredibly low to say, well, it's better than Hillary.
[01:28:34.224 --> 01:28:35.905]  Better than Hillary?
[01:28:35.985 --> 01:28:36.065]  What?
[01:28:36.105 --> 01:28:37.626]  It's better than being boiled in oil.
[01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:43.589]  You know, they're robbing me blind and beating me, but they could have ripped me to shreds and, you know, hung me from a cross or something.
[01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:45.190]  I guess, you know, but, I mean, that's the...
[01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:46.891]  I don't know.
[01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:50.534]  I just look at this stuff that we're getting now and it's not what I had hoped.
[01:28:50.615 --> 01:28:52.036]  It's not what I had voted for.
[01:28:52.156 --> 01:29:01.805]  So hopefully something will change at some point in the future, but I'm looking very pessimistic that we're ever going to see health care go back to a marketplace.
[01:29:02.086 --> 01:29:04.088]  It was a great plan that Donald Trump ran on.
[01:29:04.128 --> 01:29:07.651]  He had a seven-point plan when he was talking about competition and information.
[01:29:07.671 --> 01:29:08.472]  I think it was too simple.
[01:29:08.732 --> 01:29:08.972]  Yeah.
[01:29:09.132 --> 01:29:16.096]  His plan was too simple and then he got in there and I think, you know, he kind of made that point the other day when he said, I thought this would be a little bit easier when I got in.
[01:29:16.116 --> 01:29:22.879]  I knew what needed to be done, but then you get in there with all those bureaucrats and they're like, no, that's too simplified.
[01:29:22.939 --> 01:29:24.660]  We can't simplify the tax code.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.861]  Where will we throw all these hundreds of thousands of pages?
[01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:29.102]  Yes, tremendous opposition.
[01:29:29.142 --> 01:29:30.042]  We knew this was going to happen.
[01:29:30.062 --> 01:29:34.204]  Tremendous opposition from the establishment Republicans in Congress.
[01:29:34.224 --> 01:29:35.045]  We knew that was going to happen.
[01:29:35.865 --> 01:29:50.976]  At the very beginning I said, you know, I hate to see him, I understand why he had to support Paul Ryan because if he didn't they were going to have a brokered convention and they were going to pull some trick to get him out of there, but I said his biggest opposition is going to be Ryan, but I was kind of wrong.
[01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:56.100]  Some of his biggest opposition is coming from the people that he put in his cabinet and that's his fault.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.101]  That's his fault.
[01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:58.463]  He should not have put those people in.
[01:29:58.803 --> 01:30:01.306]  He should not have had Paul Ryan do the first plan.
[01:30:01.907 --> 01:30:08.836]  And this falls far, far short of what I had hoped to see, which was to get the government out of health care.
[01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:09.177]  Right.
[01:30:09.457 --> 01:30:10.178]  That's what we need to say.
[01:30:10.198 --> 01:30:11.219]  All right, we're going to take a quick break.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.923]  And again, we thank you so much for your support.
[01:30:13.943 --> 01:30:23.396]  30% off Brain Force Plus, 33% off Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, 20% off of, let's see, it's our Super 12.
[01:30:23.437 --> 01:30:23.737]  Secret 12.
[01:30:24.138 --> 01:30:24.358]  Super 12.
[01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:24.819]  Winter Sun.
[01:30:27.721 --> 01:30:29.422]  DNA Force back in stock.
[01:30:29.482 --> 01:30:35.726]  Get some DNA Force and then you might not really need to dip into your American Health Care Act fund.
[01:30:35.766 --> 01:30:36.827]  That's right.
[01:30:36.867 --> 01:30:37.687]  Be proactive.
[01:30:37.707 --> 01:30:43.951]  Because no matter what you do, if you don't take care of your health, it is far more cost effective.
[01:30:44.611 --> 01:30:56.798]  To eat the right foods and, you know, spend more money for organic food, to spend the money to filter your water, to buy supplements that are going to help you and things that are going to get rid of the toxins in your life.
[01:30:56.818 --> 01:31:05.623]  That is far more cost effective than any kind of money that you're going to spend on health care and far more effective than any insurance that you can buy.
[01:31:05.723 --> 01:31:06.823]  It really is a kind of insurance.
[01:31:06.863 --> 01:31:07.463]  So there you go.
[01:31:07.483 --> 01:31:12.704]  You can insure yourself and you can help to support the InfoWar and we really do appreciate your support.
[01:31:13.104 --> 01:31:15.245]  Those of you who have stood by us, we thank you so much.
[01:31:15.265 --> 01:31:17.125]  We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.
[01:31:28.747 --> 01:31:32.788]  We are looking for a few good men and women to join the team.
[01:31:37.196 --> 01:31:49.204]  It's no secret that InfoWars has been called alarmingly popular by the Washington Post and downright dangerous by hearings in the Armed Services Committee and the House of Representatives.
[01:31:50.164 --> 01:31:54.767]  The criminal globalists that have hijacked our country are angry that Americana is coming back.
[01:31:55.228 --> 01:32:01.872]  That people that know our free market system and our Judeo-Christian background builds the very best civilizations.
[01:32:02.152 --> 01:32:03.293]  And they want to stifle that.
[01:32:03.533 --> 01:32:04.614]  They want to shut that down.
[01:32:05.134 --> 01:32:14.770]  But it is our bonafide genuineness and our will to stand against these tyrants that is trumping their intimidation, their lies, and their fraud over and over again.
[01:32:15.854 --> 01:32:28.968]  We don't have a huge war chest, but listeners have supported us, so we're going to be able to hire some more reporters, some more editors, some more researchers in the coming months as we launch a whole bunch of new shows, documentary films, websites, you name it.
[01:32:29.468 --> 01:32:36.976]  So if you are a webmaster, web builder, investigative journalist, author, researcher, news anchor, you name it.
[01:32:37.657 --> 01:32:58.522]  And you want to join the InfoWars team, please send your resumes, your video reels, your background, your beliefs, your manifesto to jobs at InfoWars.com and we will certainly try to work with you and hopefully have the capital to hire some of you to be members of our team here in Austin, Texas.
[01:32:58.962 --> 01:33:05.784]  But also we're looking for auxiliary reporters to work in different parts of the United States, but also across the world.
[01:33:06.204 --> 01:33:10.668]  So whether it's actually working for us or collaborating, there are a lot of opportunities.
[01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:20.858]  Please, if you're writers, researchers, investigative journalists, video editors, you name it, we are looking for a few good men and women to join the team.
[01:33:21.499 --> 01:33:25.261]  We're gonna be hiring some male reporters, but particularly female reporters.
[01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:37.688]  So again, to be here in Austin, or in your neck of the woods in Russia, Japan, Mexico, Chile, the United States, send your resume and your work to jobs at infowars.com.
[01:33:38.289 --> 01:33:42.251]  We're taking it to the next level in the face of globalist tyranny, and we're winning.
[01:33:43.652 --> 01:33:48.958]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:33:49.118 --> 01:33:49.719]  I take this.
[01:33:49.979 --> 01:33:51.001]  My family takes this.
[01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:55.346]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:33:55.386 --> 01:33:59.831]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:59.991 --> 01:34:04.555]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:34:04.635 --> 01:34:05.676]  I don't feel good.
[01:34:05.756 --> 01:34:09.279]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:34:09.499 --> 01:34:12.161]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:34:12.201 --> 01:34:17.525]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:34:18.006 --> 01:34:20.448]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:34:20.968 --> 01:34:24.391]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:34:24.511 --> 01:34:26.693]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:34:26.753 --> 01:34:27.113]  I love it.
[01:34:27.253 --> 01:34:29.857]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:34:30.057 --> 01:34:31.018]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:34:31.058 --> 01:34:36.686]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:34:36.706 --> 01:34:38.629]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:34:38.889 --> 01:34:39.650]  It's a win-win.
[01:34:40.131 --> 01:34:40.912]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:50.482]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:50.702 --> 01:34:57.123]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:34:57.343 --> 01:35:05.625]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:35:05.905 --> 01:35:14.672]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:35:14.932 --> 01:35:20.676]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:35:21.016 --> 01:35:21.496]  It works.
[01:35:21.777 --> 01:35:30.081]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:35:30.101 --> 01:35:39.626]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[01:35:39.986 --> 01:35:40.546]  A total 360 win.
[01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:43.960]  Welcome back to our live coverage.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:36:00.728]  I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo, and we've got a lot of other articles to cover, but we've been talking at the beginning of the hour, a surprise vote that I did not see coming, and that was the narrow vote to defund Planned Parenthood.
[01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:02.069]  Tell us again about that, Leanne.
[01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:08.852]  About $217 to $212 in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.
[01:36:08.953 --> 01:36:14.436]  They're going to defund about 86% of the mandatory spending that was going to Planned Parenthood.
[01:36:14.456 --> 01:36:16.097]  That's almost $4 million.
[01:36:16.417 --> 01:36:21.340]  And they are going to redirect those funds to some community health clinics that actually
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:21.520]  I don't
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.983]  Low cost birth control, etc.
[01:36:54.704 --> 01:36:57.447]  They just don't kill babies.
[01:36:57.587 --> 01:36:58.148]  Right.
[01:36:58.308 --> 01:37:03.694]  And that, as you pointed out before, is what Planned Parenthood said to their clients who came in in 1952.
[01:37:03.774 --> 01:37:05.015]  They were clear about that.
[01:37:05.035 --> 01:37:08.139]  It wasn't until 1970 that they did their first abortion.
[01:37:08.559 --> 01:37:12.143]  Margaret Sanger, even though she was a eugenicist, did not kill babies.
[01:37:12.204 --> 01:37:15.087]  She said, I cannot condemn it strongly enough.
[01:37:15.528 --> 01:37:18.291]  The practice of abortion, she said, is not birth control.
[01:37:18.852 --> 01:37:25.319]  But now we have 320-some-odd-thousand abortions being done in the United States every year.
[01:37:26.801 --> 01:37:29.644]  It's absolutely amazing where this has happened, but that's a great move.
[01:37:29.764 --> 01:37:35.510]  Unexpected, because we just saw a couple of days ago, old Hillary Clinton came out of the closet, and where did she go?
[01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:38.713]  First place she went was Planned Parenthood, and what did she talk about?
[01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:40.215]  A handmaid's tale.
[01:37:40.835 --> 01:37:49.905]  And how this just hits all the buttons of the feminists, because they talk about, they take our rights away, and the first thing you see in the trailer is, all the women are told,
[01:37:50.265 --> 01:38:01.598]  You, at the beginning of the institution of the American male Christian patriarchy that they fantasize here in this dystopian reality, the first thing they do is send the women home from their jobs.
[01:38:01.778 --> 01:38:06.384]  So they take the women out of their, kick them out of their jobs, and then they tell them that they gotta have babies.
[01:38:08.206 --> 01:38:10.748]  And then they tell them, you know, it's a, we're under terrorist attack.
[01:38:10.768 --> 01:38:16.591]  Well, of course, all this, they're bringing in Muslims and that's where the real Handmaid's Tale is, is in Saudi Arabia.
[01:38:16.871 --> 01:38:21.534]  They bring in Muslims because they want to create chaos, division, a clash of cultures.
[01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:25.997]  They want to bring in terrorism so they can use that to do things like the Patriot Act.
[01:38:26.537 --> 01:38:27.658]  It's absolutely amazing!
[01:38:27.678 --> 01:38:38.728]  Well, I think also, too, Hillary Clinton was accepting, like, the Woman of the Century Award or some kind of... I mean, they've got to give her something because they really funneled a lot of money into her winning the election, which she did not.
[01:38:38.748 --> 01:38:40.189]  It's like, well, here, you just win the...
[01:38:40.666 --> 01:38:41.887]  Yeah, 100th year, 100th anniversary.
[01:38:41.927 --> 01:38:43.547]  Female of the century, you know.
[01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:45.108]  Come on, please.
[01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:45.588]  She looks pathetic.
[01:38:45.608 --> 01:38:56.593]  100th anniversary of Planned Parenthood, and since they didn't really start doing it until 1970, so, you know, for about, what was that, 50, 53 years or so?
[01:38:56.613 --> 01:38:56.593]  60?
[01:38:58.253 --> 01:38:59.854]  Whatever, I'm live on radio, so.
[01:38:59.894 --> 01:39:02.635]  Yeah, the math is not working here in the 27th hour.
[01:39:02.675 --> 01:39:07.417]  Half of a century, or better than half of their existence there, they did not do abortion.
[01:39:07.537 --> 01:39:07.757]  Right.
[01:39:07.977 --> 01:39:08.978]  Now it's a sacrament.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:21.185]  And then, along with this Handmaid's Tale, you really pointed out, and I think your report was called The Handmaid's Berka, and these women completely silent about the actual atrocities going on.
[01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:24.646]  They keep saying that The Handmaid's Tale has something to do with America.
[01:39:24.826 --> 01:39:28.068]  It's this dystopian view of what America looks like in the future.
[01:39:28.488 --> 01:39:32.530]  Meanwhile, right now, what's going on, there is a story.
[01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:41.895]  Uh, out of Yahoo News, so it's probably coming from Reuters or something, but it says, route to Raqqa dotted with discarded veils and burned cars.
[01:39:41.995 --> 01:39:54.623]  And there's this picture there of all of these burqas that women flung off as they were fleeing ISIS, because of course they were, when ISIS came and took over their town, they forced them to wear these veils and these burqas.
[01:39:54.663 --> 01:39:57.025]  The women there didn't typically wear them.
[01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:00.687]  And so, as you can see, as they're fleeing ISIS, they tuck off
[01:40:01.027 --> 01:40:03.167]  Took off their burkas and so that happened.
[01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:04.048]  There, that's a picture.
[01:40:04.628 --> 01:40:06.708]  Here's another story coming out of the Guardian.
[01:40:07.248 --> 01:40:11.829]  Majority of men in the Middle East survey believe a woman's place is in the home.
[01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:19.171]  And they go on to talk about all of this stereotypical sexist activity going on there in the Middle East.
[01:40:19.191 --> 01:40:25.152]  The majority of men think, you know, women should be, they need a male to escort them anywhere.
[01:40:25.172 --> 01:40:27.993]  They can't be out in public or they're asking for it.
[01:40:28.613 --> 01:40:31.096]  Well, in Saudi Arabia, you have to have a male guardian.
[01:40:31.116 --> 01:40:34.179]  That could be either your husband, or your father, or even a brother.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:40.246]  And there's many cases where they complain because of abuse of somebody, even their brother.
[01:40:40.486 --> 01:40:45.172]  And one particular instance, the lady ran away, and they captured or brought her back in the family.
[01:40:45.992 --> 01:40:48.373]  Uh, moved against her and they wound up imprisoning her.
[01:40:48.773 --> 01:41:01.077]  The amazing thing is, to see this picture of Hillary Clinton two days ago at the 100th anniversary of Planned Parenthood, saying stuff about Handmaid's Tale, that this dystopian future is just around the corner, where they're going to take- In Trump's America.
[01:41:01.417 --> 01:41:09.360]  Women's rights are going to go away and so forth, and yet she had somebody who is an advocate for Sharia law, and you want to know what that looks like?
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.781]  That is Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:11.041 --> 01:41:12.602]  They operate under Sharia law.
[01:41:13.022 --> 01:41:17.344]  That is the dystopian reality that is here now.
[01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:30.409]  It's not a future reality, but she has people introducing her at the Democrat National Convention just before, as she's taking the nomination, who advocate something that is far worse than this fictional dystopian novel.
[01:41:30.789 --> 01:41:32.110]  That's the amazing thing to me about it.
[01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:49.560]  Or like putting up this Linda Sarsour who's like this Sharia law advocate as just this new feminist icon out there and she's walking down the red carpet and things and you're right, it's like they're pushing that type of Sharia law in this country and saying it's misunderstood, people don't understand it here.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:56.422]  But then telling us that Trump is going to create... They put Saudi Arabia on the UN Commission on Women's Rights.
[01:41:56.562 --> 01:41:56.822]  Right.
[01:41:56.842 --> 01:42:10.207]  But the other story that came out yesterday was the lady who was a translator for the FBI and she goes to... says she's taking a trip somewhere else because she didn't want them to know where she was going.
[01:42:10.227 --> 01:42:14.948]  She went to Turkey, she crossed over into Syria and she married this guy... The ISIS, right?
[01:42:14.988 --> 01:42:16.689]  Yeah, the ISIS terrorist that she's studying.
[01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:20.171]  And now things are not working out too well for her.
[01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:26.015]  She sends back this message saying, this is horrible, I'm done, this is unbelievably harsh and so on.
[01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:31.719]  She's now experiencing the reality that all of these feminists are going to experience.
[01:42:31.759 --> 01:42:37.663]  Part of the Handmaid's Tale is the persecution of lesbians, but even in Margaret Atwood's
[01:42:38.584 --> 01:42:39.265]  Imagination.
[01:42:39.806 --> 01:42:50.379]  You don't see the harsh treatment that is the reality in Saudi Arabia of not just lesbians, but anybody, male or female, that's homosexual, throwing them off of roofs and so forth.
[01:42:50.759 --> 01:42:53.362]  You know, they totally ignore that.
[01:42:53.723 --> 01:42:55.144]  They are like this translator.
[01:42:55.785 --> 01:43:03.452]  Who is so in love with the political correctness, you know, this other culture, that they have absolutely no understanding of the reality of it.
[01:43:03.472 --> 01:43:11.199]  And one of the videos of the man that she fell in love with, the ISIS jihadist that she was investigating, he was like holding a freshly decapitated head.
[01:43:11.259 --> 01:43:12.961]  So she knew what she was getting herself into.
[01:43:12.981 --> 01:43:14.763]  He wasn't some saint.
[01:43:15.063 --> 01:43:20.627]  Well, it isn't like Hillary Clinton and the women's movement doesn't understand about Sharia law either.
[01:43:20.707 --> 01:43:23.749]  It's not like they don't know what's going on in Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:23.789 --> 01:43:23.969]  Right.
[01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:24.589]  She's been there.
[01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:25.570]  She bows down.
[01:43:25.670 --> 01:43:27.852]  Yeah, she's been there, so she knows what that's about.
[01:43:27.872 --> 01:43:43.702]  Well, actually, Paul Joseph Watson tweeted out an article that there was a feminist that, she's a feminist activist, women's rights advocate, and she was working for women's rights in Turkey, and she fell in love with a Muslim man there, and so then she flew back to Turkey.
[01:43:43.722 --> 01:43:44.743]  Did he make yogurt or something?
[01:43:46.104 --> 01:43:51.787]  And then turns out she's got this whole Facebook thing that he beat her, he raped her repeatedly.
[01:43:51.847 --> 01:43:54.408]  She's like, he never once stopped to ask for my consent.
[01:43:54.868 --> 01:44:00.151]  He would silence her, tell her to be quiet, and would lock her in the house, turned off her Wi-Fi.
[01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:07.875]  And she, you know, was with him for months as she, and she was just like, he repeatedly stopped the advocacy work that I was trying to do there.
[01:44:07.895 --> 01:44:09.196]  Duh!
[01:44:09.316 --> 01:44:10.016]  Surprise!
[01:44:10.236 --> 01:44:11.337]  What did you think?
[01:44:11.397 --> 01:44:11.897]  And that's it.
[01:44:11.937 --> 01:44:12.878]  That's kind of the, um,
[01:44:13.958 --> 01:44:27.986]  The disease, kind of that mental disease where these feminists, they don't see that the very thing they're fighting for is what's happening with this group that they've suddenly just love and are keeping all this praise on.
[01:44:28.286 --> 01:44:30.368]  Well, they hate America.
[01:44:30.868 --> 01:44:31.588]  They hate men.
[01:44:31.888 --> 01:44:32.849]  They hate Christianity.
[01:44:33.129 --> 01:44:35.671]  So that's their straw man, if you will.
[01:44:36.391 --> 01:44:38.615]  And yet they can't see the reality of what's going on there.
[01:44:38.775 --> 01:44:48.270]  One of the things in Margaret Atwood's novel is the fact that, or they talked about the Hulu production, you get to see women who have not been taught to read and they have to go shop and so it's very difficult for them to do that.
[01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.771]  Well, guess what?
[01:44:49.509 --> 01:44:50.570]  You can't go shopping.
[01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:54.491]  There's all kinds of restrictions on going shopping in Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:54.511 --> 01:44:55.432]  First of all, you can't drive.
[01:44:55.492 --> 01:44:57.993]  Secondly, you can't go into a dressing room and try anything on.
[01:44:58.813 --> 01:45:00.594]  They completely outlaw that.
[01:45:00.774 --> 01:45:03.575]  You can't go into a building in public.
[01:45:03.615 --> 01:45:05.676]  You can't go into mixed entrances.
[01:45:05.736 --> 01:45:08.697]  They have different entrances for men and for women in Saudi Arabia.
[01:45:09.177 --> 01:45:10.838]  This is the reality that's going on.
[01:45:10.998 --> 01:45:29.167]  I mean David, that picture, that Stark, just to put it in perspective, at the Women's Conference, when they were talking about Saudi Arabia being inducted into the Women's Rights Council, they held a Women's Conference, and it was only men in there, because the women weren't allowed to be in the same room as the men.
[01:45:29.207 --> 01:45:35.750]  So the women here, as a part of this Women's Conference, were in another room, coming to you via satellite.
[01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:38.131]  I mean, that's what we're dealing with.
[01:45:38.411 --> 01:45:52.937]  The picture of these women who have the black, full-faced burkas on, and contrast that with their dystopian future where they have women who have these white hats on and the bright red outfits and it's like, oh this is horrible, they've got to wear a uniform and everything.
[01:45:52.957 --> 01:45:58.680]  But it's, you know, if they were to dress like that in Saudi Arabia, they'd be beaten by the religious police in Saudi Arabia!
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.322]  These women, the Martha's, there you go, the Martha's or whoever they are, I don't
[01:46:03.482 --> 01:46:04.563]  I don't know exactly what it was.
[01:46:04.663 --> 01:46:05.424]  I don't know.
[01:46:05.444 --> 01:46:07.145]  I've mentioned it once before on radio.
[01:46:07.165 --> 01:46:17.754]  I don't know if you heard me, but my wife was an extra in the 1990 version of that movie that had, what's his name, the actor that I like.
[01:46:17.774 --> 01:46:20.836]  So anyway, she was an extra and she didn't know what that story was about.
[01:46:20.856 --> 01:46:27.522]  Can you imagine Karen being an extra in a movie like that that pushed abortion and this feminism stuff?
[01:46:27.702 --> 01:46:29.383]  She found out what it was and she never went back.
[01:46:29.803 --> 01:46:31.685]  But it was absolutely crazy.
[01:46:31.725 --> 01:46:36.188]  So, you know, you look at stuff like that and just the way they're divorced from reality.
[01:46:36.208 --> 01:46:37.488]  But here's another example of this.
[01:46:38.469 --> 01:46:42.612]  Sean Hannity was talking about Comey's testimony and here's a good example of how
[01:46:44.099 --> 01:46:45.440]  The mainstream media spends stuff.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:57.205]  Did you know that even though we saw all the headlines from mainstream media, many of them did not want to talk even about the fact that Huma Abedin was sending classified documents to her husband.
[01:46:57.425 --> 01:46:58.425]  Many of them didn't cover that.
[01:46:58.465 --> 01:47:00.146]  But they would cover that maybe and talk about it.
[01:47:00.586 --> 01:47:02.987]  But they didn't, most of them, did not tell you this.
[01:47:03.748 --> 01:47:07.289]  That Comey said he didn't think she did so with criminal intent.
[01:47:07.329 --> 01:47:08.410]  Where have we heard that before?
[01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:09.590]  With Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:10.771]  She goes to set up
[01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:17.665]  This private server and she puts all these classified documents on that are above top secret.
[01:47:18.752 --> 01:47:20.854]  The most highly classified documents.
[01:47:20.874 --> 01:47:23.116]  She doesn't have any kind of security on that.
[01:47:23.616 --> 01:47:25.438]  And of course, she didn't have any criminal intent.
[01:47:25.538 --> 01:47:26.339]  It doesn't matter.
[01:47:27.019 --> 01:47:31.002]  She signed documents that detailed what she was supposed to do.
[01:47:31.363 --> 01:47:32.984]  People told her what she was supposed to do.
[01:47:33.084 --> 01:47:39.870]  She signed that paperwork that said that she understood that you have to exercise certain care with classified documents.
[01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:42.712]  And she completely thumbed her nose at that.
[01:47:43.173 --> 01:47:44.234]  At all of our secrets.
[01:47:44.634 --> 01:47:56.404]  And so you want to talk about Julian Assange, you want to talk about Ed Snowden, not until you put Hillary Clinton in jail do you even talk about Ed Snowden or Julian Assange.
[01:47:56.444 --> 01:48:01.729]  First of all, Julian Assange, what got them so upset about this Vault 7 thing is what embarrassed the CIA so much.
[01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.912]  I don't even think they violated any classified documents there.
[01:48:05.272 --> 01:48:08.215]  If those hacks were classified documents,
[01:48:08.755 --> 01:48:12.539]  Then the CIA would be guilty of distributing classified documents.
[01:48:12.559 --> 01:48:16.142]  You know, kind of like Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin.
[01:48:16.422 --> 01:48:17.944]  Oh, but they didn't mean to.
[01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:18.544]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:18.564 --> 01:48:21.747]  They're not violating any copyright either because they wanted to keep it secret.
[01:48:21.767 --> 01:48:22.448]  Sorry, officer.
[01:48:22.488 --> 01:48:24.330]  I didn't realize the speed limit was only 35.
[01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:26.052]  It's just amazing.
[01:48:26.172 --> 01:48:26.932]  It's just amazing.
[01:48:26.992 --> 01:48:29.415]  So it's not a crime if Hillary does it.
[01:48:29.575 --> 01:48:31.757]  It's not a crime if her surrogates do it.
[01:48:31.957 --> 01:48:32.417]  Exactly.
[01:48:32.838 --> 01:48:43.123]  Well, we've only got about 10 minutes left here in our 3 to 5, and then we're going to be passing the torch over to Millie Weaver, Owen Schroer, Kit Daniels.
[01:48:43.143 --> 01:48:46.845]  They're going to be doing a roundtable, probably taking your phone calls as well.
[01:48:47.585 --> 01:48:50.047]  I wanted to get to this last little story here with BuzzFeed.
[01:48:50.907 --> 01:48:52.228]  Another day, another hit piece.
[01:48:52.768 --> 01:49:06.444]  So BuzzFeed, one of these authors, Charlie Weasel we're calling him, was sent on a mission to cover InfoWars and Alex Jones and he's doing this hit piece basically insulting
[01:49:08.265 --> 01:49:19.670]  Insulting all of us who work here, anyone who would actually listen and watch InfoWars, and that's why I'm really pissed off about this, because basically they're making the argument that I have to have a hive mind to be working here, all of us.
[01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:27.573]  We must have a hive mind, which is totally untrue, we're teleprompter free, we're not told what to think or what to say, and we don't all agree with each other.
[01:49:27.813 --> 01:49:28.934]  We're telling you false information.
[01:49:28.974 --> 01:49:29.955]  We don't do any research.
[01:49:30.175 --> 01:49:31.096]  We're just shooting from the hip.
[01:49:31.116 --> 01:49:32.117]  We're making this stuff up.
[01:49:32.517 --> 01:49:34.039]  That's everything that's in this BuzzFeed thing.
[01:49:34.059 --> 01:49:37.282]  So, it's a slap in the face, as Leanne said, to all of us who work here.
[01:49:38.063 --> 01:49:40.845]  People who make stuff up actually work at a place called BuzzFeed.
[01:49:41.005 --> 01:49:42.347]  You know, the dossier.
[01:49:42.667 --> 01:49:43.468]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:43.808 --> 01:49:46.411]  Someone on Twitter actually calls them peep orders.
[01:49:46.471 --> 01:49:48.492]  So, they're not reporters, they're peep orders.
[01:49:49.213 --> 01:50:08.969]  And but so one of the one of the big points they make in here and some people like Oliver Darcy what they were taking oh my gosh they talk about how one of these rogue ex-employees we don't know who they are was saying how Jones seemed to be concerned if Obama actually lost the election in 2012 because then what would we talk about
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:10.680]  This guy!
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.041]  What would you talk about without InfoWars?
[01:50:13.201 --> 01:50:14.982]  What assignment would you be sent on?
[01:50:15.402 --> 01:50:22.864]  All of these people, that's their mission, is to listen to the Alex Jones Show every single day, watch the nightly news, watch all of our reports, and then they report on it!
[01:50:22.944 --> 01:50:24.285]  We're keeping them in business!
[01:50:24.785 --> 01:50:25.145]  But then...
[01:50:25.925 --> 01:50:34.773]  So then, we would actually have more to talk about probably if Hillary Clinton was president, because there's no telling what kind of tyranny she'd be unleashing on a daily basis against us.
[01:50:34.833 --> 01:50:41.538]  I mean, we're complaining because they're not taking the yoke of Obamacare off of us sufficiently, because they're not repealing it.
[01:50:41.559 --> 01:50:43.981]  But can you imagine what Hillary Clinton would be doing?
[01:50:44.001 --> 01:50:47.884]  I mean, we'd be going on to full-on gun control, the first thing she'd be doing.
[01:50:48.144 --> 01:50:49.425]  We would have all been shut down.
[01:50:49.445 --> 01:50:50.786]  Internet would have been shut down.
[01:50:50.806 --> 01:50:51.907]  First Amendment gone.
[01:50:51.947 --> 01:50:52.708]  Second Amendment gone.
[01:50:52.808 --> 01:51:00.874]  Obama kind of already made that clear that they were going to bring it back to just those three news cable outlets that you could trust, you know, back in the good old days.
[01:51:01.534 --> 01:51:15.265]  And then so the same time that they're doing this hit piece on us, there's some stories coming out that these leaked screenshots from a former employee there, you might know him more popularly as Baked Alaska, but it's Tim
[01:51:15.825 --> 01:51:17.287]  TREADSTONE GILLIONAIRE!
[01:51:35.686 --> 01:51:48.662]  They didn't respond, but eventually they did to Paul Joseph Watson and said, this is ludicrous claim that it suggests we're biased just because our editors want to assassinate President Trump.
[01:51:48.942 --> 01:51:51.545]  So this is the kind of people that they have working at BuzzFeed News.
[01:51:54.288 --> 01:51:57.930]  Our ex-employees aren't going rogue and making viral videos.
[01:51:58.451 --> 01:52:14.120]  On YouTube, like many of the top trending videos are all of BuzzFeed's ex-staffers who are making the viral videos, taking the skills that they learned at BuzzFeed, how to create viral videos, and they're making viral videos about how much they hated working for.
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:24.972]  Let's talk about that a little bit, because they have former employees who go on the record, who go on YouTube, who use their name, who show their faces, talking about BuzzFeed.
[01:52:25.192 --> 01:52:26.253]  What does BuzzFeed do?
[01:52:26.414 --> 01:52:30.698]  BuzzFeed gets anonymous reporting to slander InfoWars.
[01:52:31.239 --> 01:52:31.640]  Exactly.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:32.641]  That's the parody that we have.
[01:52:33.061 --> 01:52:52.909]  Exactly, and like, that's, they, uh, they did try to contact, I think, everyone here, um, and I just ignored them because I knew no matter what I said, it was gonna get taken out of context, just like, uh, someone talked about how, uh, there was an exceptional night and Alex went in and shot a bow, crossbow into a bunch of DVDs and stuff, which,
[01:52:53.749 --> 01:52:57.571]  When crazy stuff like that happens around here, that's freaking awesome.
[01:52:57.591 --> 01:53:00.432]  Like, who wouldn't want to have a boss that's just like, yeah!
[01:53:00.472 --> 01:53:00.712]  Woo!
[01:53:01.172 --> 01:53:04.614]  You know, it's... I remember the time that Alex... So when they were like, oh, see how crazy he is?
[01:53:05.236 --> 01:53:15.939]  I remember the time Alex got a laser and they were over there in the warehouse with a laser setting fire to Star Wars toys and putting that out as a video.
[01:53:16.199 --> 01:53:23.780]  We do have fun here sometimes and it's one way that you keep from going insane when you work such long hours like 30 hour marathons.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:27.981]  So we do have some fun with it sometimes and we don't apologize for that.
[01:53:28.521 --> 01:53:30.242]  But we do work very hard to get it right.
[01:53:30.862 --> 01:53:36.727]  And we do do a lot of research here and I don't have any apologies to make and I don't really care what BuzzFeed says.
[01:53:36.827 --> 01:53:46.675]  I'm more concerned about getting my freedom back than to try to get into a peeing contest with BuzzFeed because I guess they would win that.
[01:53:46.755 --> 01:53:48.035]  They're the experts on that.
[01:53:48.095 --> 01:53:50.936]  They're the ones who wrote the dossier on peeing.
[01:53:51.296 --> 01:53:55.137]  So I'm not going to get into a contest with them on that.
[01:53:56.237 --> 01:53:56.777]  Exactly.
[01:53:56.797 --> 01:53:58.317]  I mean, we just kind of laughed at it.
[01:53:58.377 --> 01:54:01.058]  But it's just, I mean, this is what we're dealing with.
[01:54:01.078 --> 01:54:03.038]  That's the kind of narrative that they want to put out here.
[01:54:03.058 --> 01:54:08.699]  They have people that it is their job to now look at every single thing that we say and put out with a fine tooth comb.
[01:54:09.799 --> 01:54:12.800]  Anything that goes out, just like with this Chobani, you'll see that they didn't
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:18.684]  They didn't report on what was actually said in the report and all of the valuable information.
[01:54:18.784 --> 01:54:22.547]  Nobody actually broke it down and said, wow, who is this guy?
[01:54:22.567 --> 01:54:24.709]  That's a lot of good detail in this reporting.
[01:54:25.049 --> 01:54:27.631]  It was just the only thing they focused on was that.
[01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:28.952]  Well, that's the important thing.
[01:54:29.012 --> 01:54:30.974]  The important thing is that we see every day
[01:54:31.554 --> 01:54:38.619]  There's another attack on Alex, another attack on Infowars in general, and we're having an effect, as they say.
[01:54:38.659 --> 01:54:42.441]  You know you're over the target when you're getting the flack, and so we really do appreciate your support.
[01:54:42.481 --> 01:54:43.962]  We thank you so much for standing with us.
[01:54:44.383 --> 01:54:57.992]  That's one of the reasons that we're doing this 30-hour broadcast, is because we're being attacked economically, we're being attacked, our credibility is being attacked, we're being attacked legally with frivolous lawsuits, and I'm telling you, this Chobani yogurt lawsuit is frivolous.
[01:54:58.032 --> 01:55:00.914]  We're going to continue, no matter how much you doubt.
[01:55:00.934 --> 01:55:01.194]  You know what?
[01:55:01.614 --> 01:55:20.969]  If they were able to shut down InfoWars, I would go on social media and I would continue to rage against crony capitalism, against the Federal Reserve, against the fact that a foreign citizen who is connected because of his friends at Davos, connected to Soros and others, that he can get this kind of subsidy.
[01:55:20.989 --> 01:55:28.454]  As I said before, it's outrageous to me that he could get started with a small business loan, quote unquote, small business loan of $800,000.
[01:55:31.176 --> 01:55:39.929]  I've interviewed people that have opposed the Small Business Loan Program because they do give money to their friends.
[01:55:40.049 --> 01:55:43.293]  They do give most of their money to really big corporations.
[01:55:43.454 --> 01:55:45.116]  And so he gets $800,000, he turns around and spends $700,000 of it.
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:55.684]  Lobbying for his senators to get subsidized factories, to get into the school lunch program.
[01:55:56.184 --> 01:55:57.565]  They picked Greek yogurt.
[01:55:57.585 --> 01:56:00.907]  Not just yogurt, but Greek yogurt is what Michelle Obama picked.
[01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.108]  And we were told that we had to get the sugar content down.
[01:56:03.148 --> 01:56:11.333]  But if you look at the reports about yogurt, and even about Chobani's Greek yogurt, some of the kids' yogurts that they have, as much sugar as a candy bar.
[01:56:11.693 --> 01:56:14.935]  So it doesn't really... But they have their privileged position there.
[01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:17.158]  And so, that's what I don't like.
[01:56:17.218 --> 01:56:24.389]  I don't like people who come into our country and tell us that the workers that he's bringing in as refugees are better than American workers.
[01:56:24.449 --> 01:56:25.009]  I don't like that.
[01:56:25.598 --> 01:56:29.020]  I don't like the idea that somebody can come into this country and get a subsidy.
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:30.601]  I was in business for myself.
[01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:32.782]  My father was in business for himself.
[01:56:32.962 --> 01:56:34.923]  Both of my grandfathers were in business for themselves.
[01:56:34.943 --> 01:56:36.064]  And you know how we stayed in business?
[01:56:36.584 --> 01:56:40.667]  We fought tooth and nail against the government that was trying to rob us at every turn.
[01:56:41.267 --> 01:56:44.569]  And they robbed us, these robber barons, and they give it to other people.
[01:56:44.609 --> 01:56:47.951]  It's bad enough when they give it to robber barons who are Americans.
[01:56:48.011 --> 01:56:54.935]  It's even worse when they give it to people who aren't even American citizens and then put them on the board that manipulates our currency, the Federal Reserve.
[01:56:55.515 --> 01:56:56.495]  That is outrageous.
[01:56:56.595 --> 01:56:59.496]  I never got $8 from the federal government.
[01:56:59.656 --> 01:57:08.159]  This guy getting $800,000 and then spending it on politicians so he can get subsidized factories, subsidized workers, get subsidized training of his workers.
[01:57:08.399 --> 01:57:08.719]  Come on.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.340]  I've had enough of that.
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.381]  And we're going to continue to talk about that.
[01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:13.761]  And you're not going to shut me up.
[01:57:14.341 --> 01:57:16.262]  You're not going to shut up InfoWars.
[01:57:16.802 --> 01:57:21.884]  I know that those of you who are watching are going to stand with us, but you're not going to shut me up, InfoWars or not.
[01:57:22.395 --> 01:57:24.097]  None of us are going to shut up about that kind of stuff.
[01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:24.938]  It's outrageous.
[01:57:25.218 --> 01:57:26.500]  And you shouldn't shut up about it either.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:28.001]  You should get the message out.
[01:57:28.101 --> 01:57:29.142]  You should pass this out.
[01:57:29.523 --> 01:57:30.604]  And we appreciate you doing that.
[01:57:30.644 --> 01:57:35.810]  But of course, they're also trying to shut down you sharing articles about InfoWars by the censorship that we have there.
[01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:37.572]  So we're being opposed on a lot of different...
[01:57:38.439 --> 01:57:38.779]  Thank you.
[01:57:55.467 --> 01:58:03.050]  We have 20% off Secret 12, that's our vitamin B12 formulation, and a whole lot of other things that you'll find there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:03.250 --> 01:58:08.253]  And we're going to take a break, and then when we come back, Leanne and I will not be here.
[01:58:08.313 --> 01:58:11.174]  We will have a roundtable discussion.
[01:58:11.274 --> 01:58:12.134]  And who's going to be here again?
[01:58:12.154 --> 01:58:19.437]  It'll be Millie Weaver, Owen Schroyer, and Kit Daniels, and they have got a lot to talk about, and I believe they're also going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:58:19.477 --> 01:58:20.758]  Sorry, we didn't get to that in this hour.
[01:58:21.314 --> 01:58:22.295]  Alright, thank you so much.
[01:58:22.596 --> 01:58:26.280]  That's it for the two of us, and of course, join us again tomorrow.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:33.309]  We have a lot, several more hours of this 30-hour broadcast, but of course, we'll be here tomorrow for the radio show at 11 Central.
[01:58:45.205 --> 01:58:47.066]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[01:58:47.226 --> 01:58:48.147]  I try to have a good time.
[01:58:48.767 --> 01:58:49.948]  I'm a happy person overall.
[01:58:50.808 --> 01:58:58.373]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[01:58:59.374 --> 01:59:04.116]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[01:59:05.097 --> 01:59:07.959]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[01:59:08.239 --> 01:59:09.600]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[01:59:10.677 --> 01:59:21.729]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:26.374]  Now I never started in full wars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[01:59:26.654 --> 01:59:28.116]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[01:59:29.315 --> 01:59:36.700]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:42.524]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[01:59:43.104 --> 01:59:52.711]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[01:59:53.351 --> 02:00:00.600]  Wednesday, May 3rd and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[02:00:01.001 --> 02:00:01.461]  on Wednesday.
[02:00:02.532 --> 02:00:07.195]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[02:00:07.876 --> 02:00:13.360]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:25.389]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news but have not actually heard the message.
[02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:28.392]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[02:00:28.712 --> 02:00:30.375]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[02:00:30.675 --> 02:00:32.838]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[02:00:33.238 --> 02:00:38.205]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host's character.
[02:00:38.465 --> 02:00:43.352]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[02:00:44.278 --> 02:00:46.679]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[02:00:47.079 --> 02:00:50.820]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:51.400]  That's the goal.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:53.660]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:53.940]  No.
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:59.962]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:04.423]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[02:01:05.342 --> 02:01:05.402]  I'm
[02:01:20.282 --> 02:01:23.083]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[02:01:23.403 --> 02:01:33.806]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:48.890]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:54.012]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[02:01:54.333 --> 02:01:59.755]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[02:01:59.775 --> 02:02:01.456]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[02:02:01.716 --> 02:02:07.979]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:18.565]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[02:02:19.045 --> 02:02:21.626]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[02:02:22.086 --> 02:02:25.086]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:31.988]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[02:02:33.188 --> 02:02:38.069]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[02:02:38.429 --> 02:02:40.289]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[02:02:40.349 --> 02:02:41.170]  They see the lies.
[02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:42.590]  They see the demonization.
[02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:47.391]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:48.834 --> 02:02:57.640]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:09.007]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[02:03:09.447 --> 02:03:14.610]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:03:15.831 --> 02:03:19.193]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.

[02:03:52.084 --> 02:03:53.905]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[02:03:54.385 --> 02:03:58.386]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[02:03:58.426 --> 02:03:59.066]  And then finally,
[02:03:59.246 --> 02:03:59.987]  Let me see if it's still here.
[02:04:00.147 --> 02:04:00.387]  It is.
[02:04:00.787 --> 02:04:03.269]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:06.973]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[02:04:07.693 --> 02:04:12.718]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[02:04:13.058 --> 02:04:13.939]  It's concentrated.
[02:04:13.999 --> 02:04:16.821]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[02:04:17.081 --> 02:04:20.264]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[02:04:20.384 --> 02:04:21.085]  It's amazing.
[02:04:21.465 --> 02:04:25.108]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[02:04:25.208 --> 02:04:25.749]  It's a win-win.
[02:04:26.269 --> 02:04:30.152]  You remember to support us each month, or every two months, or every three months, however you sign up.
[02:04:30.552 --> 02:04:41.501]  You can cancel anytime, and you can get 10% off, and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us, and also get the products that obviously run out, that you've got to replenish.
[02:04:41.741 --> 02:04:43.282]  These are great renewable resources.
[02:04:43.603 --> 02:04:44.723]  Please continue to support us.
[02:04:44.804 --> 02:04:47.305]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:04:47.366 --> 02:04:48.006]  I'm determined.
[02:04:48.086 --> 02:04:48.626]  I'm focused.
[02:04:49.147 --> 02:04:54.091]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us,
[02:04:55.595 --> 02:04:57.043]  We don't have a chance in hell.
[02:04:57.466 --> 02:04:59.256]  But if you get behind us like you've already done...
[02:05:00.899 --> 02:05:01.820]  Turn it up a notch?
[02:05:02.501 --> 02:05:06.024]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[02:05:06.364 --> 02:05:08.646]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[02:05:08.906 --> 02:05:10.068]  We want to go to the stars.
[02:05:10.468 --> 02:05:11.709]  Look how far we've already come.
[02:05:11.969 --> 02:05:13.711]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[02:05:14.011 --> 02:05:17.014]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[02:05:17.274 --> 02:05:20.297]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[02:05:20.597 --> 02:05:24.801]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:26.343]  And let's take action.
[02:05:26.843 --> 02:05:34.956]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:35.216 --> 02:05:36.518]  But regardless of what you do...
[02:05:37.541 --> 02:05:48.023]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[02:05:48.063 --> 02:05:53.444]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[02:05:53.904 --> 02:06:02.265]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[02:06:02.625 --> 02:06:05.086]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:06:05.386 --> 02:06:06.626]  Please spread that link.
[02:06:07.666 --> 02:06:14.533]  You want to fight?
[02:06:14.753 --> 02:06:15.574]  You're getting it!
[02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:23.771]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Defense of Free Speech Special.
[02:06:23.851 --> 02:06:30.533]  We are in the last leg of this 30-hour broadcast, powered by you at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:30.553 --> 02:06:33.914]  Well, we've got a bunch of news to cover here in the final couple of hours.
[02:06:33.934 --> 02:06:40.356]  We're going to be joined by Matt Bracken in the 6 o'clock hour, as well as Alex Jones to bring this one home.
[02:06:40.416 --> 02:06:42.677]  He will be joining us at the conclusion of this.
[02:06:43.479 --> 02:06:46.522]  But we're going to first start talking about President Obama.
[02:06:47.322 --> 02:06:52.347]  Oh, President Obama, he just, well, former President Obama, he still thinks he's the president of something.
[02:06:52.967 --> 02:07:02.055]  And today, you could see him, you probably did see him on Twitter, talking about, in French, how you need to support Macron.
[02:07:02.856 --> 02:07:07.658]  This is Obama meddling in French's, in the French election.
[02:07:08.138 --> 02:07:10.820]  And WikiLeaks was quick to point this out, guys.
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:12.100]  What do you think about that?
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:23.686]  How about the nerve of former President Barack Obama to want a full investigation on his desk before the night of the election, looking into Russia and Trump ties.
[02:07:24.506 --> 02:07:29.389]  And here he is, he can be seen here, endorsing the French presidential candidate Macron.
[02:07:29.429 --> 02:07:33.272]  Of course, he went to Europe and supported the EU as well, but how dare Russia?
[02:07:34.393 --> 02:07:36.354]  Of course, not metal in our elections.
[02:07:36.394 --> 02:07:37.835]  How about the nerve of this guy, guys?
[02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:38.736]  Exactly.
[02:07:38.796 --> 02:07:46.201]  He actually even endorsed Hillary Clinton, and that really didn't, you know, fare too well for her, so it's not that much of a surprise.
[02:07:46.641 --> 02:07:51.585]  And remember, he also endorsed Remain for Brexit as well.
[02:07:52.807 --> 02:07:53.468]  Look what happened.
[02:07:53.488 --> 02:07:56.013]  So he's a huge loser, basically, is what you're telling me.
[02:07:56.113 --> 02:07:57.455]  Well, he's on the wrong side of history.
[02:07:57.495 --> 02:08:01.863]  I mean... But, you know, the elites, they have this notion that they know best.
[02:08:02.084 --> 02:08:04.629]  That, you know, the populations just roll, you know, rabble.
[02:08:05.441 --> 02:08:05.841]  That's right.
[02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:17.830]  It was like when the celebrities all during the American election this last year, they all came out saying that, you know, vote for Hillary Clinton because we're celebrities and we know better than you guys.
[02:08:18.230 --> 02:08:24.855]  Well, at least Nigel Farage has apparently endorsed Le Pen, which is pretty awesome.
[02:08:24.935 --> 02:08:27.497]  He actually endorsed Trump as well.
[02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:33.301]  And maybe this is a little bit of a foreshadowing of how the French election is going to pan out.
[02:08:33.322 --> 02:08:33.862]  What do you think?
[02:08:34.102 --> 02:08:43.889]  Well if that isn't it, the fact that they're already blaming Russia, they're out, BBC is blaming, or it was Sky News I think today, blaming fake news already for the results as well.
[02:08:44.269 --> 02:08:48.252]  So they're greasing the skids, they're getting ready for the same excuses, they've been demonizing Le Pen.
[02:08:48.272 --> 02:08:55.657]  It's the same tricks they tried to run on the President Trump's campaign, the same tricks they tried to run in our election in 2016.
[02:08:55.937 --> 02:09:00.280]  The same tricks that failed because the people turned out in that great of numbers.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:01.381]  That's the question.
[02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:03.062]  Is Le Pen's
[02:09:04.890 --> 02:09:15.335]  Well, I think it's hers to lose, but if she's going to lose it, it's because it's a rigged election.
[02:09:15.355 --> 02:09:20.618]  You know, you see, like, I think I saw the map that the rural county... Wait a second, though.
[02:09:20.638 --> 02:09:22.519]  CNN told me this was McCrimes to lose.
[02:09:23.059 --> 02:09:23.780]  Oh, that's CNN.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:24.220]  Fake news.
[02:09:26.428 --> 02:09:38.593]  But yeah, I saw a map, and I'm saying counties, but it's actually the provinces, however you call it in France, that the rural areas strongly favored Le Pen, especially in the South, because they're the ones that are getting all the migrants.
[02:09:38.793 --> 02:09:40.153]  Paris is already a lost cause.
[02:09:40.874 --> 02:09:44.175]  You know, the big cities, just like in the U.S., they're already pretty much lost causes.
[02:09:44.535 --> 02:09:51.278]  Just like in Trump, you know, Trump won all the counties in the rural areas of the U.S., so it was basically the same thing that happened in France.
[02:09:51.704 --> 02:09:52.084]  That's right.
[02:09:52.104 --> 02:10:00.591]  So the question is, will the rural people have a louder voice during this French election like we have seen with the past 2016 election?
[02:10:00.952 --> 02:10:04.715]  And you know, this article just came out that's really actually interesting.
[02:10:04.755 --> 02:10:05.515]  It ties into this.
[02:10:06.056 --> 02:10:12.561]  It talks about how Democratic strategists are now claiming they know why Hillary Clinton lost the election.
[02:10:12.741 --> 02:10:14.963]  Did they already say it was because of Russian hacking?
[02:10:15.103 --> 02:10:19.007]  Well, this is at least, okay, let's just hear what their excuse is this time.
[02:10:19.507 --> 02:10:31.598]  They're saying that the reason Hillary Clinton lost is because the voters who had supported President Barack Obama in 2012 actually backed Trump in the 2016 election.
[02:10:31.738 --> 02:10:34.721]  Yeah, I believe Pennsylvania and Ohio were the best examples of that.
[02:10:34.861 --> 02:10:39.185]  They counted for more than two-thirds of the reason why Clinton lost.
[02:10:39.225 --> 02:10:44.210]  So what happened was all these people who had voted for Obama then voted for Trump.
[02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:46.052]  I mean it was a significant percentage.
[02:10:46.092 --> 02:10:51.938]  I remember seeing on the Drudge Report right after the election there was an article about how Trump would have beat Obama in 2012.
[02:10:53.499 --> 02:10:57.282]  And basically now, months later, the Democrats are finally admitting that.
[02:11:23.759 --> 02:11:24.500]  Printed this story.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.203]  They're saying 70% of Obama voters went for Trump?
[02:11:28.263 --> 02:11:37.171]  Yeah, and this is actually according to Matt Cantor, a senior vice president of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group.
[02:11:37.651 --> 02:11:47.459]  In his group's analysis, about 70% of Clinton's failure to reach Obama's vote total in 2012 was because she lost these voters.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:54.063]  So she, you know, the Russians is not really, you know, that's not why they lost.
[02:11:54.083 --> 02:11:57.785]  You know, you got Russians, you got fake news, you got racism, you got bigotry.
[02:11:57.865 --> 02:11:59.126]  Those are all the real reasons.
[02:11:59.146 --> 02:12:03.949]  Yeah, but it wasn't so much that she lost the voters, it was the Democratic Party in general that lost the voters.
[02:12:03.969 --> 02:12:09.852]  You know, they had this impenetrable wall, blue wall, of Michigan, Wisconsin, all these Rust Belt states.
[02:12:10.728 --> 02:12:29.076]  But, you know, she didn't even bother to campaign in those states because the Democrats, their whole narrative about being about the working working class, you know, it's unraveling because now they switch sides and they're pushing immigrants, you know, open borders and whatnot, which is completely goes contrary to protecting American jobs.
[02:12:29.317 --> 02:12:31.758]  Well, and she honestly might not even have had the
[02:12:32.518 --> 02:12:33.258]  Physical health.
[02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:34.138]  Yeah, that's a good point too.
[02:12:34.158 --> 02:12:35.739]  To be able to do those campaigns.
[02:12:35.779 --> 02:12:37.879]  I mean, she was obviously unhealthy.
[02:12:38.019 --> 02:12:39.040]  She had to take time off.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.660]  We saw the coughing spells.
[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.660]  We saw the seizure, collapsing, everything.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:44.941]  Of course, that's probably just fake news.
[02:12:45.021 --> 02:12:51.102]  I didn't even know until after the election that she didn't even bother to campaign in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[02:12:51.122 --> 02:12:51.642]  That's big.
[02:12:51.842 --> 02:12:58.224]  Those are two states that, if she thinks that she's already got it in the bag and she's having health problems, then yeah, she wouldn't campaign in those states.
[02:12:58.632 --> 02:13:15.409]  Well it looks like she let her ego or her head get to her but you know those those came out surprisingly in Trump's favor and I'm wondering if some of the polls out there in the French election should be just as suspect as the polling that happened during our election.
[02:13:15.449 --> 02:13:15.810]  No doubt.
[02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:19.413]  Because this whole election is seen as a referendum for the EU.
[02:13:21.235 --> 02:13:24.059]  And there's other European elections coming up too that could spell the end of it as well.
[02:13:36.598 --> 02:13:39.219]  They're all starting to, I think, see what they did.
[02:13:39.259 --> 02:13:41.839]  They're all starting to see how they're not that popular.
[02:13:41.919 --> 02:13:43.659]  They don't control the narrative like they used to.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:45.680]  And some people are humbling themselves.
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:54.822]  I don't know if that's the case for this star in particular, but Miley Cyrus admits her wild antics may not have convinced Trump fans to vote for Hillary.
[02:13:55.342 --> 02:13:55.722]  Wow.
[02:13:56.022 --> 02:13:58.002]  She finally figured it out, guys.
[02:13:58.582 --> 02:14:00.043]  She finally figured it out.
[02:14:00.083 --> 02:14:01.063]  So we'll give her a little credit.
[02:14:01.263 --> 02:14:08.228]  It's like when you have all these awful people, okay, going out and endorsing Hillary Clinton, it's not going to help her.
[02:14:08.528 --> 02:14:24.300]  I mean, we had Jay-Z hold a concert where he had a bunch of other rappers go out there and rap a bunch of vulgar language, calling women all kinds of derogatory names and slurs, and Hillary Clinton's like, oh, I endorse Jay-Z, and Jay-Z endorses me.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:32.628]  I remember a couple days before the election Hillary had a campaign event in Cleveland with I think LeBron James and he's a hometown hero there.
[02:14:33.008 --> 02:14:34.189]  They couldn't even fill up the stadium.
[02:14:34.209 --> 02:14:41.156]  We had a source inside the stadium to send us a photo of it and it's like nobody there.
[02:14:41.376 --> 02:14:44.679]  And there were people outside literally saying come in we got LeBron in here come on.
[02:14:44.719 --> 02:14:46.301]  And then all the Getty's photos and like the
[02:14:46.661 --> 02:14:52.505]  Local media photos showing the event, they had to use zoomed in lenses to even like, to kind of hide the fact that no one's there.
[02:14:52.946 --> 02:14:58.270]  We had, I'll admit it, I mean myself included, I had a ton of conspiracy theories during Hillary's campaign.
[02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:04.254]  Was she doing fake events, you know, was there projectors involved and all kinds of weird stuff that we saw on videos.
[02:15:05.195 --> 02:15:07.336]  No, I mean it was weird stuff but I was just covering the videos we saw.
[02:15:08.417 --> 02:15:21.185]  There's been more pictures that have come out that were released by Hillary's campaign that show they clearly doctored pictures from her events because you can see it, it's actually the same trick that NASA uses on some of their pictures of Earth.
[02:15:21.645 --> 02:15:26.428]  They take an image of a cloud or a group of clouds and then they just copy and paste and copy and paste.
[02:15:26.628 --> 02:15:30.471]  They did that and you can find multiple times where the Clinton campaign did that at
[02:15:30.791 --> 02:15:30.951]  Yes.
[02:15:47.551 --> 02:16:06.793]  Only their favorite mainstream media photographers could go on it and it literally lifted them up so they could have an angle over the rafters to try and make it look like she had more support than she did because if they would have gotten a picture from behind it would have showed the giant gap of empty space in this little tiny high school
[02:16:07.293 --> 02:16:09.334]  Which was the case every time.
[02:16:09.635 --> 02:16:11.016]  But it all makes sense to me now.
[02:16:11.576 --> 02:16:13.778]  The whole thing was just a Hollywood stunt.
[02:16:13.818 --> 02:16:15.539]  The falling down, the coughing.
[02:16:15.599 --> 02:16:17.140]  She was just acting the whole time.
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:20.082]  Well no, that part's real.
[02:16:20.542 --> 02:16:25.386]  The Hollywood stage magic was out there to try and make her look better than she was.
[02:16:26.767 --> 02:16:28.368]  You can only fake it so much, guys.
[02:16:29.164 --> 02:16:32.446]  Well, I don't know if you guys follow Rob Schneider on Twitter.
[02:16:32.887 --> 02:16:36.309]  This is a guy who I think is actually probably a Democrat, but really just a liberal.
[02:16:36.990 --> 02:16:37.890]  He's a Republican.
[02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:38.711]  He's really just a liberal.
[02:16:38.731 --> 02:16:39.351]  He's a Republican.
[02:16:39.412 --> 02:16:41.313]  He abandoned the Democratic Party.
[02:16:41.533 --> 02:16:43.635]  I don't know if I would say he's a Republican.
[02:16:43.735 --> 02:16:44.135]  He did.
[02:16:44.355 --> 02:16:46.777]  He officially announced that he abandoned it back in like 2013.
[02:16:46.837 --> 02:16:48.218]  Let's look into that.
[02:16:48.558 --> 02:16:50.720]  I'm definitely saying he is a renounced Democrat.
[02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:53.542]  At the very least, he's definitely not a social justice warrior.
[02:16:53.582 --> 02:16:55.303]  But he's a true liberal, is what he is.
[02:16:55.363 --> 02:16:56.384]  No, he's a Republican.
[02:16:56.544 --> 02:16:57.925]  No, you're misunderstanding what I'm saying, Milley.
[02:16:57.965 --> 02:16:58.285]  Trust me.
[02:16:58.365 --> 02:16:59.685]  He's a true liberal.
[02:16:59.745 --> 02:17:04.788]  He's freedom of thought, freedom of ideas, what an original liberal is.
[02:17:05.588 --> 02:17:13.471]  If you want to take the construction of conservatism versus liberalism and just on policy, he falls on the liberal end of the spectrum for most stuff.
[02:17:13.491 --> 02:17:14.112]  And that's fine.
[02:17:14.132 --> 02:17:15.652]  That's how Democrats usually vote.
[02:17:15.672 --> 02:17:17.513]  Now they've completely lost touch with those people.
[02:17:17.893 --> 02:17:21.395]  And that's why Rob Schneider has left the Democratic Party, as you're alluding to.
[02:17:21.835 --> 02:17:25.480]  But he has been absolutely destroying the Democrats on Twitter.
[02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:27.303]  It's been one of the most beautiful things.
[02:17:27.663 --> 02:17:30.247]  Now he comes out and he has said that U.S.
[02:17:30.447 --> 02:17:33.291]  needs a restraining order against Hillary Clinton.
[02:17:33.652 --> 02:17:36.055]  I think that that is one of the funniest things he's said yet.
[02:17:39.921 --> 02:17:42.082]  I want justice to be done to Hillary Clinton.
[02:17:42.282 --> 02:17:47.244]  I think that the Clinton Foundation needs to be investigated for massive money laundering and crimes in Haiti.
[02:17:47.884 --> 02:17:50.346]  I think that Hillary Clinton herself needs to be investigated.
[02:17:50.426 --> 02:17:52.586]  Obviously, she's guilty on the emails.
[02:17:52.647 --> 02:17:55.448]  Why she doesn't have to face justice on that, I don't know.
[02:17:55.508 --> 02:17:58.489]  Why she doesn't have to face justice for her time in the State Department, I don't know.
[02:17:58.829 --> 02:18:01.390]  This was something that I thought Trump would at least get the ball moving on.
[02:18:01.410 --> 02:18:02.031]  He hasn't yet.
[02:18:02.511 --> 02:18:07.773]  But it does seem like most of the American people, even people that voted for Hillary Clinton, would like to see her investigated.
[02:18:07.833 --> 02:18:12.714]  The American people would like to see Hillary Clinton in an orange pantsuit, okay?
[02:18:12.734 --> 02:18:14.135]  That's what we all want to see.
[02:18:14.155 --> 02:18:15.535]  Add one more to the cast of that popular show.
[02:18:15.555 --> 02:18:17.696]  We want to see Hillary for prison.
[02:18:17.736 --> 02:18:21.877]  That's what everyone has been chanting at the Trump rallies all throughout the campaign season.
[02:18:21.897 --> 02:18:24.898]  At the county fair she saw people dressing up like pumpkins dressed like Hillary in a...
[02:18:25.518 --> 02:18:40.728]  Well, what people really want to see is they don't want to see people that are above the law and have special, you know, pull and powers and that they can get away with committing crimes that we all know nobody
[02:18:40.908 --> 02:18:42.229]  Here's an interesting point.
[02:18:42.249 --> 02:18:43.470]  The elites don't like that either.
[02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:52.737]  The reason, I said this before the election, that the elites would prefer Trump over Hillary just because of the fact that Hillary was too obvious in her criminality.
[02:18:53.057 --> 02:18:57.360]  You know, she said in the Goldman Sachs speech that you can have a public policy and a private policy.
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:59.702]  What she was actually describing was NWO.
[02:19:00.042 --> 02:19:01.043]  It was in her email, too.
[02:19:01.083 --> 02:19:01.643]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:01.663 --> 02:19:02.884]  It was shadow government.
[02:19:03.404 --> 02:19:07.728]  Now you have our system of government, then you have the power behind the scenes, you know, the private government.
[02:19:08.348 --> 02:19:14.691]  But she was so obvious in everything that she did, and the elites, they rule through deception.
[02:19:14.791 --> 02:19:22.355]  It's hard to deceive the population when, you know, you have a person like Hillary that's basically doing everything, committing crimes.
[02:19:22.416 --> 02:19:28.279]  I think you're right though, but I think they would have just brought her in and it just would have been a scorched earth type of four years, just burn it all to the ground.
[02:19:28.399 --> 02:19:34.002]  I don't know if you guys saw the most recent thing, but Hillary was interviewed, I'm not sure if this was today, but it was this week.
[02:19:35.111 --> 02:19:36.852]  Women for Women International.
[02:19:36.932 --> 02:19:42.537]  She does an interview and she was asked, I put this video in the thing guys, I don't know if you guys had time to get it.
[02:19:42.577 --> 02:19:43.377]  If you did, let me know.
[02:19:43.417 --> 02:19:44.338]  If not, it's no big deal.
[02:19:44.819 --> 02:19:54.426]  But she was asked, you know, what is something, I guess, I don't remember how it was phrased, but what is something that you wish could have came up during the debates or what is something that you feel like kind of got left out?
[02:19:54.446 --> 02:19:55.427]  What's your regrets, you know?
[02:19:55.467 --> 02:19:55.667]  Yeah.
[02:19:56.047 --> 02:20:01.411]  And she says she was so prepared, she was waiting for someone to ask her about jobs.
[02:20:01.791 --> 02:20:03.472]  Of course she was prepared.
[02:20:03.512 --> 02:20:04.773]  She was giving the questions beforehand.
[02:20:04.813 --> 02:20:10.757]  But Kit, well, that's true, but Kit, so she's on the show and this woman's like, what are you, and she's like, man, I was really excited.
[02:20:10.777 --> 02:20:12.998]  I was really ready to be asked about jobs.
[02:20:13.038 --> 02:20:13.939]  I had everything ready.
[02:20:14.259 --> 02:20:16.140]  And the crowd gets going and she's really upset.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:16.961]  You know, she's really upset.
[02:20:17.001 --> 02:20:18.042]  She worked so hard.
[02:20:18.362 --> 02:20:22.805]  She studied so hard for that question and she's just, she was so ready and she just never got it.
[02:20:22.985 --> 02:20:25.247]  Oh, but it turns out that she did.
[02:20:26.227 --> 02:20:27.868]  She did get asked about jobs.
[02:20:28.288 --> 02:20:29.589]  Multiple times.
[02:20:29.669 --> 02:20:30.309]  Oh my gosh.
[02:20:30.690 --> 02:20:31.370]  Can you believe?
[02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:34.252]  I mean, again, it's just like the nerve of Obama, the nerve of Hillary Clinton.
[02:20:34.752 --> 02:20:36.573]  This is why the Democrats are failing, guys.
[02:20:37.213 --> 02:20:44.357]  I remember a couple years ago, she said that she had a childhood dream that she wanted to be an astronaut, but she was basically told that because she's a woman, she couldn't.
[02:20:44.597 --> 02:20:47.379]  I'm thinking to myself, there's no way she ever wanted to be an astronaut.
[02:20:48.396 --> 02:20:50.958]  I don't even think she even knows half her lies anymore.
[02:20:51.518 --> 02:20:54.040]  She's totally demented.
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:21:01.425]  It's like, woe is me, palm fronting, virtue signaling, you know, oh I wanted to be it but I couldn't because I'm a woman.
[02:21:01.446 --> 02:21:05.709]  I think she's really just genuinely an absolute evil-minded woman.
[02:21:05.729 --> 02:21:12.373]  A true criminal, I don't know about mastermind, but like just driven by criminality all the time.
[02:21:12.393 --> 02:21:13.054]  That's a good point.
[02:21:13.154 --> 02:21:15.796]  I think she craves power but she's not quite a mastermind.
[02:21:15.956 --> 02:21:17.157]  I don't think she's a mastermind.
[02:21:17.177 --> 02:21:22.060]  I think that she is just a criminal, just nasty, just teeth grinding.
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:25.023]  And I think it gets to a point with a lot of these people where...
[02:21:25.882 --> 02:21:28.463]  You know, once you get in deep, it's kind of like the whole blackmail thing.
[02:21:28.503 --> 02:21:32.004]  It's why they'll try to set you up and then lock you in a dungeon with a kid or something for blackmail.
[02:21:32.224 --> 02:21:32.824]  It's the same thing.
[02:21:32.904 --> 02:21:49.008]  Once you get in with this stuff, once you get in with these bankers, once you've got one money laundering operation, or one charity that's doing something that's sketchy, or this, that, or the other thing you did in the State Department, it's just, it's Pandora's box, it's a snowball effect, and you turn out to be like Hillary Clinton.
[02:21:49.028 --> 02:21:53.610]  I remember Alex had Bill Clinton's ex-girlfriend on the show before the election.
[02:21:53.650 --> 02:21:55.090]  Yeah, that they dated for a while.
[02:21:55.290 --> 02:21:55.770]  Yeah.
[02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:59.733]  The really revealing thing about the interview was the fact that the way she was describing Hillary.
[02:21:59.893 --> 02:22:01.014]  Yeah, nasty, stunk.
[02:22:01.295 --> 02:22:03.896]  Well, basically she had the same personality then as she does now.
[02:22:04.517 --> 02:22:05.297]  She still stinks.
[02:22:05.438 --> 02:22:06.779]  That's why a fly lands on her nose.
[02:22:06.799 --> 02:22:09.721]  They smell like sulfur, right?
[02:22:10.081 --> 02:22:14.324]  But she had this whole craving for power even at that time when she was in her early 20s.
[02:22:14.584 --> 02:22:16.386]  This has been a lifelong pursuit of her.
[02:22:17.048 --> 02:22:19.850]  Hey, that's right guys, we don't need to go to that Hillary clip, we already talked about it.
[02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:22.491]  And I think the audience is well aware of Hillary lying.
[02:22:22.511 --> 02:22:24.452]  I mean, just how absurd, again, that's what I'm saying.
[02:22:25.213 --> 02:22:32.137]  Just the notion that the American people would be so stupid that you can say, oh, I really wish somebody would have asked me about jobs.
[02:22:33.197 --> 02:22:35.619]  First of all, there were three debates, right?
[02:22:35.739 --> 02:22:37.420]  You don't think that jobs got brought up once?
[02:22:40.137 --> 02:22:41.157]  Election was all about jobs.
[02:22:41.277 --> 02:22:45.158]  It was the first question at Hofstra University in New York.
[02:22:45.658 --> 02:22:46.398]  The first debate.
[02:22:46.438 --> 02:22:47.218]  The first question.
[02:22:47.439 --> 02:22:49.079]  Well I can tell you what she didn't... She was waiting.
[02:22:49.119 --> 02:22:50.039]  I mean, ugh.
[02:22:50.059 --> 02:22:52.119]  Just think how drugged up she probably was at that debate.
[02:22:52.139 --> 02:22:52.560]  That's true.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:53.400]  She probably doesn't even remember.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:54.620]  Well she doesn't even ask the question.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:57.621]  She gets asked about jobs and then she talks about how important the election is.
[02:22:57.641 --> 02:22:58.661]  Doesn't even address jobs.
[02:22:58.681 --> 02:23:01.381]  Well I can tell you what she didn't want to be asked about.
[02:23:01.461 --> 02:23:03.802]  She did not want to be asked about the emails.
[02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:14.049]  The emails that she was sending on her private server, which were criminal, so she did not like that, and she did not like when Trump said that she needed to be locked up in jail.
[02:23:14.149 --> 02:23:16.570]  He's like, well if I'm president, you're gonna be put in jail.
[02:23:16.951 --> 02:23:18.932]  And so, I mean, what do you guys think about that?
[02:23:18.972 --> 02:23:23.855]  Does it seem like Trump is kind of backpedaled from that campaign statement?
[02:23:23.915 --> 02:23:31.541]  I tell ya, every story that you see, I've got stories here that make Trump look good, make Trump look bad, and I'm just kind of at this point,
[02:23:32.381 --> 02:23:34.565]  It's just like a waiting game, honestly.
[02:23:34.626 --> 02:23:39.595]  It's too early, it's in the first quarter, you know, and it's just like... Well, I love using automotive...
[02:23:41.826 --> 02:23:43.468]  Compare it to automobiles, which is my hobby.
[02:23:44.148 --> 02:23:48.853]  To me, Trump's like, he's building this, he's trying to restore America, he's trying to restore this rusted out hot rod.
[02:23:49.714 --> 02:23:53.117]  And people are like, well why don't you have the hot rod done for the show on Sunday?
[02:23:53.177 --> 02:23:55.599]  Well yeah, because he's having... Yeah, why haven't you got the gas can yet?
[02:23:55.619 --> 02:24:01.966]  The gas, this, that... Well, he's got all the floor pans rusted out, the frame rails rusted out, you know, he's got all these parts that he can't find anymore.
[02:24:02.466 --> 02:24:04.949]  So yeah, it's amazing what he's done so far.
[02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:06.491]  I like that analogy.
[02:24:06.611 --> 02:24:08.594]  That's exactly the word I was looking for.
[02:24:08.634 --> 02:24:10.877]  He's inherited a mess.
[02:24:11.077 --> 02:24:12.419]  A huge mess.
[02:24:12.439 --> 02:24:18.126]  I mean, we've got this mess with North Korea and a lot of people are thinking, well, this just kind of sprung up out of nowhere.
[02:24:18.406 --> 02:24:20.449]  Relations were kind of fine with North Korea.
[02:24:20.669 --> 02:24:21.790]  Well, and let's remember too.
[02:24:44.537 --> 02:24:56.742]  Well, I mean, if Donald Trump, let me put it this way, if Donald Trump, if there is still a chance, and I think for a lot of people, they don't think that, they don't feel the same way about Donald Trump now than they did on November 8th.
[02:24:56.862 --> 02:24:58.023]  I would say the same for myself.
[02:24:58.083 --> 02:25:01.905]  I'm not saying I'm totally against him, I'm definitely not saying that, but what I'm saying is,
[02:25:03.234 --> 02:25:06.955]  Most people probably feel differently about Trump now than they did when they voted on November 8th.
[02:25:07.295 --> 02:25:10.376]  Some people have an extreme distaste for Donald Trump now.
[02:25:10.836 --> 02:25:11.696]  But here's what I would say.
[02:25:12.496 --> 02:25:27.340]  If there is still a chance that Donald Trump is the man that we thought he was and that we elected on November 8th, not getting behind him now or not giving him a chance and being patient to finish his first term in office is not going to help him.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.081]  Well, here's the deal, okay?
[02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:30.602]  And this is what we've found.
[02:25:30.722 --> 02:25:34.144]  Republicans tend to be extremely picky.
[02:25:34.564 --> 02:25:41.768]  We hold our politicians to a very high standard and we look at them with a magnifying glass.
[02:25:42.068 --> 02:25:45.730]  You don't see the Democrats doing that with their politicians at all whatsoever.
[02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:48.771]  They just all get behind like a bunch of minions.
[02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:52.531]  Whoever the Democratic person is, they get them in, and then guess what?
[02:25:52.631 --> 02:25:55.012]  We get Democratic policies being pushed through.
[02:25:55.332 --> 02:25:56.392]  And here's the bottom line.
[02:25:56.652 --> 02:26:08.075]  You may not agree with every single thing that Trump is doing, and you may think that you yourself could do a better job, but I highly doubt it given how corrupt the government is and Washington is right now.
[02:26:08.575 --> 02:26:14.502]  But the bottom line is basically he's doing what he can with what he has and it's going to take time.
[02:26:14.522 --> 02:26:15.824]  It is not so easy.
[02:26:15.964 --> 02:26:18.166]  And number one, he's not a globalist.
[02:26:18.667 --> 02:26:20.770]  I mean, he's done things to get rid of TPP.
[02:26:21.551 --> 02:26:26.537]  He's doing things that if Hillary had gotten in... They're proposing to defund Planned Parenthood now?
[02:26:27.233 --> 02:26:27.473]  Yeah!
[02:26:27.693 --> 02:26:45.810]  So, I mean, we're seeing huge steps and strides forward toward, you know, conservative belief systems, whereas if we had Hillary Clinton, because we wanted to sit there and nitpick Donald Trump about his little imperfections here and there, we would have Hillary Clinton and we would have bad things happening.
[02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:47.732]  Well, but the thing is, I think the issue is, it's not little things.
[02:26:47.772 --> 02:26:49.813]  I think that's the problem that people have.
[02:26:49.853 --> 02:26:50.594]  It's not little things.
[02:26:50.654 --> 02:26:51.235]  It's big things.
[02:26:51.315 --> 02:26:52.596]  It's lying about false flags.
[02:26:54.625 --> 02:27:00.370]  That's a line in the sand for people when his administration lies about chemical gas attacks in Syria.
[02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:14.461]  When you've got what appears to be more oil wars forming in the Middle East, and Rex Tillerson in his cabinet, when you've got Soros now perhaps manipulating Kushner, or Chinese banks, or whatever banks are manipulating Kushner, and now Ivanka has all this say.
[02:27:14.921 --> 02:27:16.503]  Those are the things that people are worried about.
[02:27:16.983 --> 02:27:22.166]  But if Trump is truly independent and the man that we thought he was, he needs his support base more than ever.
[02:27:22.206 --> 02:27:24.987]  The question is, does he realize that?
[02:27:25.547 --> 02:27:34.092]  Or has he kind of entered the politician mindset that the flyover country isn't really important, the constituents aren't really important, just focus on dealing with the big cats?
[02:27:34.172 --> 02:27:37.293]  We need to put more faith in Trump's support base more so than Trump.
[02:27:37.313 --> 02:27:39.254]  Trump is one man, he's just the president.
[02:27:39.274 --> 02:27:44.257]  The president doesn't have that much power, but what really excites me is the Americans who put Trump into power.
[02:27:45.057 --> 02:27:49.480]  You know, you got Generation Z now that's, you know, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:55.104]  To me, that's something that I would never have guessed that would have happened considering what we've seen with the Millennials.
[02:27:55.504 --> 02:28:00.127]  And now they're already freaking out about the 2018 American elections, blaming Russia for those.
[02:28:00.167 --> 02:28:01.128]  They haven't even happened yet.
[02:28:02.029 --> 02:28:13.242]  Well, it's easy to get really excited about Generation Z because we're starting to see a little bit of a turnaround back toward conservatism, but this is the most concerning thing.
[02:28:13.402 --> 02:28:16.546]  The millennials are going to be the largest generation.
[02:28:16.566 --> 02:28:19.349]  I mean, they outnumber the baby boomers now.
[02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:25.154]  And they are going to be coming into positions of power, and they have drastically different beliefs.
[02:28:25.234 --> 02:28:32.579]  They're on the extreme liberal, even Marxist, Communist, Socialist, and a lot of them identify with Bernie Sanders type policies.
[02:28:32.899 --> 02:28:36.702]  And we're also seeing millennials having kids, and their kids are now starting to grow up.
[02:28:37.322 --> 02:28:57.255]  What do we have to look forward to if we let things continue, if we let schools continue to indoctrinate children, if we let these media shows, these TV networks indoctrinate children with cartoons and all this propaganda, the music propaganda, the media propaganda, what are we going to have?
[02:28:57.656 --> 02:29:06.001]  Because at the end of the day, Generation X and Generation Z, they're not going to be able to even outvote the millennials mixed with the older people.
[02:29:07.142 --> 02:29:08.604]  I'm a millennial.
[02:29:08.744 --> 02:29:09.986]  We still have hope, okay?
[02:29:10.006 --> 02:29:11.428]  The millennials are not dead yet.
[02:29:11.488 --> 02:29:19.598]  Let's paraphrase Princess Leia to Darth Vader, you know, the stronger they close their fists, you know, the more systems are going to slip out of their fingers.
[02:29:19.618 --> 02:29:21.140]  That's the same thing with the millennial thing.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.483]  In fact, with the doctrination, with the cultural Marxism.
[02:29:23.703 --> 02:29:25.385]  We just need to wake up the millennials.
[02:29:25.445 --> 02:29:29.990]  Because of what you just said about the millennials makes our generation having more power.
[02:29:30.271 --> 02:29:40.582]  They push their narrative so hard that it doesn't surprise me that you see 4chan and reddit, especially 4chan that's really controlling the election as far as
[02:29:41.283 --> 02:29:42.946]  They are resisting narratives.
[02:29:43.046 --> 02:29:44.348]  They are questioning things.
[02:29:44.388 --> 02:29:45.630]  They are thinking for themselves.
[02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:48.013]  We actually have a free market of ideas on the internet.
[02:29:48.033 --> 02:29:50.076]  That's exactly why they're attacking the internet.
[02:29:50.336 --> 02:29:53.822]  Never forget about the power of memes.
[02:29:54.262 --> 02:29:56.646]  Folks, this is the Defense of Free Speech special.

[02:30:18.281 --> 02:30:19.062]  Didn't get much sleep.
[02:30:19.662 --> 02:30:21.583]  I was hitting a wall right before I went on air.
[02:30:21.764 --> 02:30:24.025]  Some of the crew kind of saw me slouching around.
[02:30:24.045 --> 02:30:27.067]  They basically shoved BrainForce down my throat.
[02:30:27.087 --> 02:30:28.428]  They said, get on air, Schroyer.
[02:30:28.988 --> 02:30:30.489]  And I was perked up, ready to go.

[02:31:11.249 --> 02:31:11.810]  And how about this?

[02:31:22.096 --> 02:31:24.677]  They are poisoning the water, whether intentionally or not.
[02:31:25.758 --> 02:31:27.158]  That's irrefutable.
[02:31:27.499 --> 02:31:34.983]  The water is full of poison, full of chemicals, whether it be additives like fluoride or glyphosates.
[02:31:35.583 --> 02:31:37.285]  You gotta filter your water, folks.
[02:31:37.505 --> 02:31:38.626]  And that deal right there, $237.
[02:31:38.667 --> 02:31:39.047]  Look at that.

[02:31:42.911 --> 02:31:43.312]  4.8-star review.
[02:31:43.332 --> 02:31:44.333]  That's almost a 5-star review.
[02:31:55.365 --> 02:31:56.486]  It really works amazing.
[02:31:56.506 --> 02:32:03.730]  You know, I just got one recently and I've just been putting tap water in it and it's amazing how nice tasting it comes out.
[02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:06.492]  I don't taste any chlorine, any fluoride, anything like that.
[02:32:06.872 --> 02:32:07.472]  It's amazing.
[02:32:07.512 --> 02:32:07.972]  I've stopped.
[02:32:07.992 --> 02:32:16.938]  I used to go out and buy bottled water all the time, but bottled water isn't really that great for you because it's got the chemicals, the plastics leaching, and it tends to be...
[02:32:17.598 --> 02:32:23.480]  It usually tends to be acidic as well, whereas actually tap water tends to be alkaline at least.
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:30.202]  So when I put it through this Pro-Pure, it just comes out great and I've been feeling great just kind of as an experiment trying it out.
[02:32:30.822 --> 02:32:33.643]  It's really great guys, so it's on sale.
[02:32:33.703 --> 02:32:34.783]  Get it while it's on sale.
[02:32:35.163 --> 02:32:36.244]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:32:37.546 --> 02:32:41.990]  That's how you fund us to go 30 hours of a live broadcast.
[02:32:42.010 --> 02:32:46.935]  Guys, let's do a news blitz here before we get to the top of the hour, and we're joined by Matt Bracken.
[02:32:48.256 --> 02:32:49.438]  I don't know if you guys saw, so...
[02:32:50.714 --> 02:33:04.502]  The new GOP bill passes the House today, and big celebration, they had everybody down on the hill, all the Republicans, everybody worked hard, everybody glad-handing each other, Paul Ryan's the big hero, Trump's rewarding Paul Ryan.
[02:33:05.222 --> 02:33:08.204]  And I'm sitting here and I'm thinking two things, and I'd like to hear your guys' thoughts.
[02:33:08.764 --> 02:33:10.145]  My first thing that I'm thinking is...
[02:33:11.212 --> 02:33:12.113]  What are we celebrating?
[02:33:12.634 --> 02:33:13.976]  Nothing really got done here.
[02:33:14.737 --> 02:33:24.870]  You hurtled one obstacle, and I guess the fact... See, this to me is like saying, we've been losing so long, we finally got a victory and we're winning.
[02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:27.934]  It's like there's an old saying in sports, act like you've been there before.
[02:33:28.855 --> 02:33:34.099]  They're acting like they've never won anything before the way they were celebrating this new bill getting passed.
[02:33:35.159 --> 02:33:37.841]  Like I said, glad handing, hugging, shaking their head, everybody smiles.
[02:33:38.602 --> 02:33:40.383]  There's still more obstacles, guys.
[02:33:40.903 --> 02:33:43.065]  So I'm not really understanding the big celebration.
[02:33:43.125 --> 02:33:48.008]  I'm not saying it wasn't an accomplishment, but let's, you know, let's not pop the bottles of champagne just yet.
[02:33:48.749 --> 02:33:54.552]  And then the other thing that I also realized is this seems to be a tactic of Donald Trump's, and it really does make sense.
[02:33:55.573 --> 02:33:58.917]  Analyzing Trump's presidency to this point right now, what are we at?
[02:33:58.937 --> 02:34:00.960]  Like day 110 or something like that?
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:02.041]  I think 105.
[02:34:02.081 --> 02:34:02.041]  105?
[02:34:03.322 --> 02:34:08.689]  He really is making an effort to bring everyone together.
[02:34:08.809 --> 02:34:09.169]  It's like...
[02:34:10.202 --> 02:34:15.804]  When we go out on the streets and we talk to Antifa or we talk to the Trump protesters or whatever, it's like talking to a wall.
[02:34:16.464 --> 02:34:30.607]  And we've reached a point where we don't try to really bother to talk sense with them or engage in political discourse because they really don't have anything to say and it really just becomes put a mic in their face and let them expose themselves for how dumb and pathetic they are.
[02:34:31.488 --> 02:34:32.248]  But Trump
[02:34:33.615 --> 02:34:40.977]  Has this deep, I think, drive to really actually try to make a deal with the brick wall.
[02:34:41.497 --> 02:34:45.999]  He actually wants to convince Nancy Pelosi that he's a good guy and he cares about the country.
[02:34:46.279 --> 02:34:47.359]  He wants to get Pelosi.
[02:34:47.419 --> 02:34:48.199]  He wants to get Schumer.
[02:34:48.539 --> 02:34:56.762]  I'm saying even the people, even the farthest against him, he's trying to cut deals across the board and he feels like if he can slowly but surely
[02:34:57.742 --> 02:35:07.071]  Bring on some of these Democrats, bring on some of these never-Trump-er neocons, make some deals, even if his voter base hates it, even if it goes against some of the promises he made on the campaign.
[02:35:07.611 --> 02:35:17.541]  I think that right now he feels like if he can be some sort of popular guy in politics, in the House, in the Senate, in Washington, that he can get his agenda
[02:35:17.981 --> 02:35:18.361]  Passed.
[02:35:18.401 --> 02:35:20.063]  And then maybe he comes back to his base.
[02:35:20.424 --> 02:35:22.746]  But right now, I kind of feel like that's where he's at.
[02:35:22.866 --> 02:35:24.168]  Trying to make friends.
[02:35:25.229 --> 02:35:29.353]  Maybe not necessarily with all the Swamp Creatures, but just trying to fit in, basically.
[02:35:29.574 --> 02:35:30.715]  Well, he has to.
[02:35:30.895 --> 02:35:32.497]  It's called diplomacy.
[02:35:32.517 --> 02:35:37.863]  He has to kind of get these guys to want to work with him to pass things that he wants to do.
[02:35:38.263 --> 02:35:39.404]  He has to have some bit of
[02:35:40.225 --> 02:35:45.426]  You know, people working together and coming together, a little bit of agreements when it comes to stuff like that.
[02:35:45.446 --> 02:35:51.548]  But you know, I'm still not going to be completely happy and satisfied until Obamacare is completely gone.
[02:35:51.868 --> 02:35:54.709]  I just think it was a bad idea from the beginning.
[02:35:55.209 --> 02:35:56.489]  Get rid of it all together.
[02:35:57.190 --> 02:36:05.412]  There should not be any law requiring people to have to buy into health insurance, especially when these, you know, health insurance companies keep
[02:36:05.732 --> 02:36:07.433]  Raising up the price more and more and more.
[02:36:07.734 --> 02:36:18.701]  And the health insurance is only going to get more expensive in the country because people are continuing to eat GMOs, just horrible foods.
[02:36:18.782 --> 02:36:27.628]  I mean, people are just eating like, you know, sodas and all this junk and candy and stuff filled with high fructose corn syrup, filled with all kinds of preservatives.
[02:36:27.828 --> 02:36:29.329]  They're not taking care of themselves.
[02:36:29.709 --> 02:36:31.871]  You know, it's only going to get worse from here, guys.
[02:36:31.971 --> 02:36:34.153]  And we've got the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:36:34.173 --> 02:36:35.835]  We've got the probiotics to help take care of that.
[02:36:35.855 --> 02:36:36.736]  They're on sale right now.
[02:36:36.796 --> 02:36:38.017]  Biome Defense, 20% off.
[02:36:38.037 --> 02:36:39.879]  Living Defense, 20% off.
[02:36:39.919 --> 02:36:41.101]  Folks, we're going to take a quick break.
[02:36:41.381 --> 02:36:42.062]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:36:42.082 --> 02:36:48.168]  This is the final stretch run of the Infowars Defense of Free Speech 30-hour broadcast special.
[02:36:48.428 --> 02:36:49.049]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:49.109 --> 02:36:51.412]  Matt Bracken and Alex Jones in the next hour.
[02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:04.823]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[02:37:05.003 --> 02:37:05.924]  I try to have a good time.
[02:37:06.544 --> 02:37:07.725]  I'm a happy person overall.
[02:37:08.586 --> 02:37:16.153]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[02:37:17.153 --> 02:37:21.878]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[02:37:22.858 --> 02:37:25.741]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[02:37:26.001 --> 02:37:27.382]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[02:37:28.430 --> 02:37:39.505]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[02:37:40.606 --> 02:37:44.151]  Now, I never started Infowars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[02:37:44.431 --> 02:37:45.893]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[02:37:47.102 --> 02:37:54.468]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[02:37:55.108 --> 02:38:00.293]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[02:38:00.873 --> 02:38:10.481]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[02:38:11.101 --> 02:38:18.348]  Wednesday, May 3rd and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[02:38:18.769 --> 02:38:19.269]  on Wednesday.
[02:38:20.310 --> 02:38:24.975]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[02:38:25.655 --> 02:38:31.101]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[02:38:31.721 --> 02:38:43.167]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[02:38:43.967 --> 02:38:46.149]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[02:38:46.489 --> 02:38:48.130]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:50.591]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[02:38:50.991 --> 02:38:55.974]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[02:38:56.234 --> 02:38:59.776]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society,
[02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:01.131]  Goodwill.
[02:39:02.051 --> 02:39:04.432]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[02:39:04.852 --> 02:39:08.573]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[02:39:08.633 --> 02:39:09.174]  That's the goal.
[02:39:09.314 --> 02:39:11.434]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[02:39:11.494 --> 02:39:11.714]  No.
[02:39:12.135 --> 02:39:17.736]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[02:39:18.217 --> 02:39:22.178]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[02:39:22.978 --> 02:39:23.138]  Okay.
[02:39:37.995 --> 02:39:40.836]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[02:39:41.177 --> 02:39:51.562]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[02:39:52.062 --> 02:40:06.649]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[02:40:07.109 --> 02:40:11.772]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[02:40:12.092 --> 02:40:17.535]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[02:40:17.555 --> 02:40:19.216]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:25.740]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:36.326]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[02:40:36.806 --> 02:40:39.387]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[02:40:39.847 --> 02:40:42.848]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[02:40:43.208 --> 02:40:49.750]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:55.832]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[02:40:56.192 --> 02:40:58.053]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[02:40:58.113 --> 02:40:58.933]  They see the lies.
[02:40:59.273 --> 02:41:00.353]  They see the demonization.
[02:41:01.134 --> 02:41:04.935]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic, than InfoWars.com.
[02:41:06.601 --> 02:41:15.408]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[02:41:15.808 --> 02:41:26.777]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[02:41:27.197 --> 02:41:32.361]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:41:33.602 --> 02:41:36.943]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.
[02:41:37.083 --> 02:41:42.185]  Products you need, products that fund our operation, so that we can then expose the globalist program.
[02:41:42.285 --> 02:41:44.205]  It's a total 360 win.
[02:41:44.645 --> 02:41:47.326]  A limited time, DNA Force is now back in stock.
[02:41:47.806 --> 02:41:52.948]  We have the Defend Free Speech Mega Special getting Brain Force, our best-selling nootropic for 30% off.
[02:41:53.948 --> 02:41:55.830]  We have Secret 12 at 20% off.
[02:41:56.191 --> 02:41:59.034]  We have Living Defense, a parasite cleanse, 20% off.
[02:41:59.334 --> 02:42:02.217]  Biome Defense, our great probiotic, 25% off.
[02:42:02.618 --> 02:42:05.561]  Bio PCA for skin and nails, top formula.
[02:42:05.861 --> 02:42:09.545]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[02:42:09.866 --> 02:42:11.648]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[02:42:12.128 --> 02:42:16.152]  Winter sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[02:42:16.192 --> 02:42:17.753]  And then finally, let me see if it's still here.
[02:42:17.893 --> 02:42:18.154]  It is.
[02:42:18.554 --> 02:42:21.036]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[02:42:21.457 --> 02:42:24.720]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:30.485]  Fluoride free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[02:42:30.825 --> 02:42:31.706]  It's concentrated.
[02:42:31.766 --> 02:42:32.547]  My dad is a
[02:42:32.867 --> 02:42:34.589]  Cause I retired dentist oral surgeon.
[02:42:34.829 --> 02:42:38.012]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[02:42:38.132 --> 02:42:38.832]  It's amazing.
[02:42:39.213 --> 02:42:42.856]  And again, when you sign up for auto ship, you get an additional 10% off.
[02:42:42.956 --> 02:42:43.577]  It's a win win.
[02:42:44.037 --> 02:42:51.064]  You remember to support us each month or every two months or every three months, however you sign up, you can cancel anytime and you can get 10% off and then.
[02:42:52.765 --> 02:42:59.248]  Don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[02:42:59.489 --> 02:43:01.029]  These are great renewable resources.
[02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:02.470]  Please continue to support us.
[02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:05.032]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:43:05.112 --> 02:43:05.752]  I'm determined.
[02:43:05.852 --> 02:43:06.372]  I'm focused.
[02:43:06.913 --> 02:43:14.817]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[02:43:15.217 --> 02:43:16.998]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:19.560]  Turn it up a notch?
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.781]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[02:43:24.121 --> 02:43:26.401]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[02:43:26.642 --> 02:43:27.822]  We want to go to the stars.
[02:43:28.222 --> 02:43:29.462]  Look how far we've already come.
[02:43:29.722 --> 02:43:31.462]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[02:43:31.763 --> 02:43:34.763]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[02:43:35.023 --> 02:43:38.044]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[02:43:38.344 --> 02:43:42.545]  Let's tell Ted Turner he could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[02:43:42.845 --> 02:43:44.085]  And let's take action.
[02:43:44.605 --> 02:43:52.742]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:43:52.962 --> 02:43:54.305]  But regardless of what you do...
[02:43:55.305 --> 02:44:05.812]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[02:44:05.832 --> 02:44:11.216]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[02:44:11.676 --> 02:44:20.042]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[02:44:20.402 --> 02:44:22.883]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:44:23.184 --> 02:44:24.425]  Please spread that link.
[02:44:29.809 --> 02:44:33.793]  This is the Defense of Free Speech 30-hour broadcast.
[02:44:33.833 --> 02:44:35.814]  We are in the tail end of it right now.
[02:44:36.315 --> 02:44:40.238]  In just a bit, we're going to be joined by Matt Bracken and then Alex Jones will join us.
[02:44:40.298 --> 02:44:47.024]  I think he's really fired up with a new story in the Washington Compost that came out today, so I'm looking forward to discussing that with him.
[02:44:47.364 --> 02:44:48.305]  But guys, you know, this is
[02:44:49.466 --> 02:44:50.887]  The Defense of Free Speech special.
[02:44:51.588 --> 02:44:53.069]  We all support free speech.
[02:44:53.989 --> 02:44:58.452]  And we have talked about free speech and specifically in the political realm.
[02:44:58.513 --> 02:45:00.374]  It's starting to cause rifts in family.
[02:45:00.954 --> 02:45:03.896]  And then there was this story yesterday in CBS.
[02:45:04.257 --> 02:45:07.339]  Political talk is causing problems at work now too.
[02:45:07.739 --> 02:45:12.422]  So you can't talk politics at dinner because your family's going to fight like cats and dogs.
[02:45:12.802 --> 02:45:17.704]  You can't go out in the city of Austin and talk politics because someone's going to get offended and scream at you.
[02:45:18.005 --> 02:45:20.666]  I've shown that in videos we put on Infowars YouTube channel.
[02:45:21.006 --> 02:45:25.208]  And now you can't talk political at work because you're going to offend somebody.
[02:45:25.569 --> 02:45:29.050]  Guys, free speech, you can't even talk politics in this country.
[02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:33.753]  Yeah, this is a chilling effect on free speech because when you think about it, if you can't talk openly
[02:45:34.233 --> 02:45:45.407]  Then you're isolated and that's exactly what the elite want because people when they they can't like the Trump movement for example if all the Trump voters never talked amongst themselves it would never have happened
[02:45:46.403 --> 02:45:50.969]  And that's probably why Trump made the hats, made the shirts, so that we knew we could wear that out.
[02:45:51.009 --> 02:45:55.674]  To force people to, you know, run into each other at a rally and start communicating.
[02:45:55.774 --> 02:45:59.098]  Because if people are too scared to talk, then they're never going to share ideas.
[02:45:59.479 --> 02:46:02.562]  They're going to feel like they're a minority against the elite.
[02:46:02.823 --> 02:46:03.964]  They're never going to join forces.
[02:46:04.084 --> 02:46:04.385]  That's true.
[02:46:04.425 --> 02:46:05.346]  But let's get real, guys.
[02:46:05.726 --> 02:46:12.651]  We all know that the ones that, at the end of the day, are the ones getting offended are typically the liberals.
[02:46:13.091 --> 02:46:25.961]  I mean, I've seen this happen in prior workplaces, which, other than at InfoWars, I mean, everyone else tended to have liberal points of views, and if you were a conservative and you voiced your opinion,
[02:46:26.681 --> 02:46:32.247]  You offended or triggered your co-workers and then you got in trouble for it.
[02:46:32.347 --> 02:46:42.058]  It's like, where do you ever see, okay, could you imagine a bunch of conservatives all sitting there at work and all of a sudden a liberal comes in and says, oh, you know, well, I think, nah, nah, nah.
[02:46:42.358 --> 02:46:44.321]  They would just go, okay, cool, and just walk away.
[02:46:44.341 --> 02:46:47.584]  Well, that's a good point, too, and I think that the proof is in the pudding because
[02:46:48.570 --> 02:46:51.011]  It all changed when Trump became president.
[02:46:51.391 --> 02:46:53.432]  When Obama was president, it was okay.
[02:46:53.472 --> 02:46:55.292]  They wouldn't be offended because they were winning.
[02:46:55.792 --> 02:46:56.593]  They had the high ground.
[02:46:56.613 --> 02:46:57.513]  We have Obama.
[02:46:57.533 --> 02:46:59.393]  Obama's the hero, so it doesn't really matter what you think.
[02:46:59.433 --> 02:47:00.494]  You're just a racist anyway.
[02:47:00.514 --> 02:47:01.314]  We got Obama in.
[02:47:01.614 --> 02:47:16.839]  But now that they're losing, now that they actually see that they're losers, now that they see Obama lied, then now that this is where you start to get to a psychological aspect where their character feels hurt and they don't want anybody to point that out.
[02:47:17.793 --> 02:47:22.995]  Yeah, it's like they're getting to the point where they're going from just talk to violence.
[02:47:23.255 --> 02:47:24.255]  They're hitting that point.
[02:47:24.295 --> 02:47:24.555]  Yeah.
[02:47:24.895 --> 02:47:26.896]  This is arrested development.
[02:47:27.076 --> 02:47:30.597]  The SJWs tend to be very emotionally erratic.
[02:47:31.158 --> 02:47:35.719]  I mean, we've seen the video evidence out there.
[02:47:35.739 --> 02:47:38.980]  It shows that there's something psychological behind it.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:41.141]  I mean, there's got to be some mental illness.
[02:47:41.161 --> 02:47:46.143]  When you have children that basically grow up at a daycare center,
[02:47:47.003 --> 02:47:49.486]  The daycare center is practically the third parent.
[02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:51.247]  You get an award just for showing up?
[02:47:51.328 --> 02:47:51.528]  Yeah.
[02:47:52.108 --> 02:47:52.909]  I mean, yeah.
[02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:55.011]  You used to have to show up every day to get an award.
[02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:55.352]  Yeah.
[02:47:55.872 --> 02:48:05.702]  You know, kids that lack of one or two parents or they don't spend time with either parent, they tend to have more psychological issues growing up than ones that have a stable family.
[02:48:06.262 --> 02:48:07.343]  Yeah, this is true and this is...
[02:48:07.944 --> 02:48:10.065]  That's been proven by psychological studies.
[02:48:10.085 --> 02:48:12.587]  That's not just rhetoric the kid's talking about there.
[02:48:12.627 --> 02:48:13.507]  This is actually a fact.
[02:48:13.747 --> 02:48:19.971]  And of course we know, part of the agenda with Agenda 21 and globalism, you have to eliminate the family.
[02:48:19.991 --> 02:48:21.331]  You can't have strong families.
[02:48:21.371 --> 02:48:22.072]  They won't want that.
[02:48:22.112 --> 02:48:23.513]  They'll want to stay independent.
[02:48:23.633 --> 02:48:25.273]  Also, notice the wording.
[02:48:25.474 --> 02:48:26.574]  Notice triggering.
[02:48:26.894 --> 02:48:28.875]  That has seemed to be on a rise.
[02:48:28.955 --> 02:48:30.496]  Everybody's using triggering.
[02:48:30.736 --> 02:48:31.817]  Oh, that triggers me.
[02:48:32.037 --> 02:48:33.278]  You're kind of triggering me right now.
[02:48:33.638 --> 02:48:38.101]  They're using a psychological term that kind of has been associated with mind control.
[02:48:38.121 --> 02:48:39.542]  So I do think that's a little bit weird.
[02:48:39.562 --> 02:48:40.083]  That's true.
[02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:42.044]  Or like PTSD as well.
[02:48:42.084 --> 02:48:42.484]  Yeah.
[02:48:42.544 --> 02:48:43.225]  It's the same thing.
[02:48:43.265 --> 02:48:43.885]  PTSD.
[02:48:44.005 --> 02:48:45.146]  Let's move forward with this one.
[02:48:45.186 --> 02:48:48.889]  Here's another, this is kind of a chilling effect on free speech too, Kit.
[02:48:49.409 --> 02:48:56.174]  Netflix, everyone's talked about this now, but Netflix edits a Bill Nye episode to remove segments saying chromosomes determine gender.
[02:48:56.474 --> 02:48:58.976]  So everybody's made the joke, seen the meme.
[02:48:59.356 --> 02:49:07.541]  In the 1990s, if you talked about Bill Nye the Science Guy or his views on sex or gender and chromosomes, it was simple.
[02:49:07.641 --> 02:49:10.402]  He broke it down with science and biology.
[02:49:10.522 --> 02:49:12.343]  What makes a man and what makes a woman?
[02:49:12.664 --> 02:49:14.525]  Well, he's come quite a far way.
[02:49:15.245 --> 02:49:26.531]  But, with everybody calling him out, showing the old episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy, showing them on the internet, showing all the times where he talked about science and X and Y and men and women, now they're trying to delete all that.
[02:49:26.551 --> 02:49:34.335]  They're trying to erase that history, get that off the record, because it shows how much of a sellout, I guess, more than anything, Bill Nye really is.
[02:49:34.655 --> 02:49:44.200]  Well, see, science has long been co-opted by the government, because science has this aura of credibility with the scientific method and whatnot.
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:55.922]  That's why they tried to push global warming because the public was, it was one of the narratives that they thought the public could buy more because it was under the guise of scientists, you know, the appeal to authority policy.
[02:49:56.602 --> 02:50:10.125]  So yeah, that's, it doesn't really surprise me that much with the whole Bill Nye thing because you have this whole scientism thing that's been going on for the past 15-20 years with global warming where the scientists are the new priest class that we must worship, we must obey.
[02:50:10.145 --> 02:50:11.985]  Even though you couldn't name one of them.
[02:50:12.445 --> 02:50:23.614]  You know what's interesting here, is if you actually did some research on Bill Nye the Science Guy, you would find out that his mom has a lot of history in the intelligence.
[02:50:24.174 --> 02:50:30.980]  I mean, she worked for the intelligence agencies, so it's kind of interesting to see some of his early childhood information that's out here.
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:34.703]  So wait a second, if his mother was in intelligence, how come Bill Nye didn't get any?
[02:50:35.410 --> 02:50:43.218]  I think he might have tried, but it says out there that he tried to apply for NASA to be an astronaut, but he was denied several times.
[02:50:43.238 --> 02:50:51.125]  So apparently Bill Nye the science guy was not smart enough to be an astronaut, but he's smart enough to be out there and be a TV show host.
[02:50:51.165 --> 02:50:51.446]  He's great.
[02:50:51.466 --> 02:50:52.867]  He's good with the kids.
[02:50:56.010 --> 02:51:00.334]  And look, honestly, I don't think anybody ever had a problem with him when he did his old science stuff.
[02:51:00.394 --> 02:51:01.935]  I think it was kind of goofy, kind of quirky.
[02:51:01.976 --> 02:51:02.636]  Kids liked it.
[02:51:02.676 --> 02:51:03.577]  Teachers liked showing it.
[02:51:03.617 --> 02:51:04.558]  It got the kids' attention.
[02:51:04.598 --> 02:51:07.220]  I don't think there was any propaganda in it, at least as far as I know.
[02:51:07.821 --> 02:51:11.985]  But now, of course, we see him a totally different Bill Nye here 20 to 10 years later.
[02:51:12.245 --> 02:51:13.346]  Hey, how about this one, guys?
[02:51:14.287 --> 02:51:15.408]  When are we going to start seeing this?
[02:51:15.428 --> 02:51:16.028]  I tell ya.
[02:51:17.350 --> 02:51:25.996]  Model Chrissy Teigen says Trump should pay for her Botox and medical bills because of the crippling anxiety that he has brought to her.
[02:51:26.336 --> 02:51:26.556]  What?
[02:51:26.956 --> 02:51:27.437]  Listen to this.
[02:51:27.497 --> 02:51:29.438]  Now, see, we're hearing this, guys.
[02:51:29.918 --> 02:51:33.040]  Pay for my Botox, pay for my gender reassignment surgery.
[02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:34.441]  Okay, so, but we're hearing this.
[02:51:34.561 --> 02:51:35.282]  We're hearing that.
[02:51:36.483 --> 02:51:46.411]  They've been pushing this narrative for a long time, and this just shows you that all of these people in Hollywood that we've fawned over are nothing more than just general fops, like most of the general population.
[02:51:46.971 --> 02:51:55.379]  Chrissy Teigen, I'm sorry, Chrissy, to have to insult you like this, but you're a complete intellectual dolt.
[02:51:56.955 --> 02:51:58.617]  This shows you the brainwashing.
[02:51:59.057 --> 02:52:00.719]  It's the mainstream media, folks.
[02:52:01.219 --> 02:52:04.683]  It's the mainstream media that has been pushing the divide.
[02:52:05.004 --> 02:52:07.647]  It is the mainstream media that's been lying about Donald Trump.
[02:52:07.927 --> 02:52:10.270]  It's the mainstream media that's been lying about everything.
[02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:11.591]  Fomenting this divide.
[02:52:11.911 --> 02:52:13.113]  Fomenting this civil war.
[02:52:13.393 --> 02:52:14.955]  Fomenting violence in the streets.
[02:52:15.576 --> 02:52:16.637]  Charging Antifa.
[02:52:16.917 --> 02:52:18.078]  Bringing these people on the air.
[02:52:18.258 --> 02:52:21.420]  Somebody charges Trump's stage, CNN brings him on for an interview.
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:25.102]  The father of the Orlando shooting killed 49 people.
[02:52:25.302 --> 02:52:28.204]  He gets to do an interview with CNN because he supports Hillary Clinton.
[02:52:28.624 --> 02:52:32.966]  The mainstream news, Chrissy Teigen, is why you have crippling anxiety.
[02:52:33.387 --> 02:52:36.048]  Because you take mainstream news literally, okay?
[02:52:36.368 --> 02:52:39.890]  So you want to know why you have this anxiety, Chrissy?
[02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:41.651]  Look in the mirror, okay?
[02:52:42.132 --> 02:52:44.033]  And maybe quit obsessing with yourself.
[02:52:44.753 --> 02:52:48.355]  Get over the fake news and you'll figure out you're just fine.
[02:52:48.776 --> 02:52:50.176]  Why do you want Botox?
[02:52:50.256 --> 02:52:51.417]  You're a good-looking woman.
[02:52:52.258 --> 02:52:53.719]  So you've got two problems, Chrissy.
[02:52:54.139 --> 02:53:02.124]  One, you're so self-absorbed because you're a model that you cannot just accept the beauty you have and you have to strive for more.
[02:53:02.384 --> 02:53:04.725]  So you already got that that's causing you crippling anxiety.
[02:53:04.765 --> 02:53:06.006]  That's our culture here in America.
[02:53:06.026 --> 02:53:06.987]  I'm sorry that that happened.
[02:53:07.307 --> 02:53:22.492]  Two, you follow the mainstream news which has been lying to you about Donald Trump, lying to you about his agenda, lying to you about his policy, and now this has given you crippling anxiety because you don't know what the heck is going on and you think it's Donald Trump's fault.
[02:53:22.732 --> 02:53:26.133]  So Chrissy, look in the mirror, try to set yourself straight.
[02:53:26.453 --> 02:53:31.675]  Maybe John Legend, who I think that apparently they're dating, maybe John can set you straight.
[02:53:31.995 --> 02:53:32.415]  Hey John.
[02:53:33.410 --> 02:53:34.831]  They're married, okay.
[02:53:34.891 --> 02:53:38.553]  Hey, John, I know you love your wife.
[02:53:38.853 --> 02:53:42.716]  Just tell her to quit talking and thinking about politics, okay?
[02:53:43.316 --> 02:53:44.057]  She'll be better off.
[02:53:44.117 --> 02:53:48.920]  If she really has crippling anxiety, which is probably a stretch of the imagination to begin with,
[02:53:49.640 --> 02:53:53.542]  Maybe she should turn off the television and quit obsessing over her body.
[02:54:05.769 --> 02:54:14.671]  Emotional issues, obviously liberals have just decided to blame every single problem they have on Donald Trump.
[02:54:14.711 --> 02:54:15.972]  He's become their scapegoat.
[02:54:16.012 --> 02:54:18.993]  I'm so tired of hearing these stories, I don't even want to say anything about this.
[02:54:19.133 --> 02:54:22.674]  She does actually have postpartum depression, so that could be a little bit of it.
[02:54:22.694 --> 02:54:23.394]  She has what?
[02:54:23.594 --> 02:54:24.954]  She has postpartum depression.
[02:54:25.394 --> 02:54:26.475]  Postpartum depression?
[02:54:27.095 --> 02:54:27.615]  Okay, well...
[02:54:28.115 --> 02:54:28.956]  Yeah, it's a real thing.
[02:54:29.196 --> 02:54:32.238]  Okay, well, that doesn't mean that Trump should pay for your Botox.
[02:54:32.278 --> 02:54:34.740]  It's not post-Trump election depression.
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:36.781]  Yes, exactly, which is how they want to spin it.
[02:54:37.161 --> 02:54:45.547]  Postpartum depression can actually be linked to certain vitamin omega-3 deficiencies as well, so it could just be she's not taking care of herself.
[02:54:45.567 --> 02:54:47.909]  No, let's not talk about why people are getting depressed.
[02:54:47.969 --> 02:54:52.652]  Let's just blame it on the politician in office, and I don't even like saying Trump's a politician.
[02:54:52.672 --> 02:54:53.073]  But look, though.
[02:54:54.241 --> 02:54:56.122]  Alright kid, I'm sorry to have to do this to you.
[02:54:56.143 --> 02:54:56.803]  I know you hate this.
[02:54:57.564 --> 02:55:02.647]  She says, I'm so effing tired of this maniacally insane incompetent president.
[02:55:04.188 --> 02:55:05.970]  Who's really maniacally insane here?
[02:55:10.393 --> 02:55:15.037]  What in her life can she directly attribute to Trump?
[02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:16.310]  Nothing.
[02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:17.871]  Her lack of Botox?
[02:55:18.171 --> 02:55:18.871]  Well, maybe.
[02:55:19.351 --> 02:55:20.292]  She wants Trump to pay for it.
[02:55:20.312 --> 02:55:21.092]  She hasn't gotten it yet.
[02:55:21.692 --> 02:55:22.513]  I really don't get it.
[02:55:22.713 --> 02:55:23.233]  Here's the thing.
[02:55:23.833 --> 02:55:27.795]  If you have a problem with Donald Trump and you don't like his presidency, that's fine.
[02:55:28.235 --> 02:55:29.196]  That's perfectly fine.
[02:55:29.516 --> 02:55:39.040]  But to sit here and throw out this ridiculous notion that he's maniacally insane and he's causing you crippling anxiety, that's where you prove yourself to be maniacally insane.
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:39.800]  Yourself.
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:42.321]  And of course we're seeing this in Hollywood.
[02:55:42.341 --> 02:55:43.101]  Alright, we'll get over this.
[02:55:43.121 --> 02:55:43.742]  This is getting absurd.
[02:55:45.723 --> 02:55:49.167]  After I stand up for Donald Trump, I have to sit here and scratch my head over this one.
[02:55:49.748 --> 02:55:55.936]  Did you guys know that Donald Trump offered to officiate Joe and Mika's wedding?
[02:55:56.717 --> 02:55:58.099]  Now this is an interesting story.
[02:55:58.139 --> 02:56:00.301]  I don't think too many people have talked about it, but apparently...
[02:56:01.308 --> 02:56:06.890]  When Donald Trump found out that Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were getting married, he wanted to be involved.
[02:56:06.930 --> 02:56:08.831]  He talked about how they could do it at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:56:08.871 --> 02:56:10.092]  It was going to be a big thing.
[02:56:11.693 --> 02:56:15.254]  And then Kushner said, hey, I can actually do the ceremony.
[02:56:15.334 --> 02:56:16.775]  I can actually marry you.
[02:56:17.115 --> 02:56:18.676]  So you had Kushner and Trump.
[02:56:20.076 --> 02:56:23.138]  First of all, here's the thing that rubs me the wrong way about this, guys.
[02:56:23.178 --> 02:56:23.858]  I'd like to hear what you think.
[02:56:25.509 --> 02:56:35.439]  The very notion of this story implies the fact that you've got Kushner, Donald Trump, Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough hanging out together rubbing elbows.
[02:56:36.079 --> 02:56:36.360]  Okay?
[02:56:37.781 --> 02:56:43.747]  Mika Brzezinski told you that it's her job to determine what you think.
[02:56:43.807 --> 02:56:44.848]  She said that live on air.
[02:56:46.318 --> 02:56:53.862]  Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been defaming Donald Trump ever since he decided to run for the office of United States President.
[02:56:54.343 --> 02:56:55.864]  Why are these people rubbing elbows?
[02:56:56.966 --> 02:56:59.047]  And why is Jared Kushner talking about marrying them?
[02:56:59.727 --> 02:57:00.768]  It's just very strange.
[02:57:00.868 --> 02:57:05.050]  And I don't think this plays on the same level as Hillary Clinton being at Donald Trump's wedding.
[02:57:05.130 --> 02:57:06.411]  I know that that's where people will go with this.
[02:57:06.831 --> 02:57:08.072]  I don't play this at the same level.
[02:57:08.352 --> 02:57:09.452]  But I'd like to hear what you guys think.
[02:57:09.753 --> 02:57:12.274]  Well, it's like, keep your enemies closer.
[02:57:12.454 --> 02:57:18.657]  I mean, Trump, what Trump's going to do is the psychological... So you think it's what I was saying earlier, he wants everybody to come together, kumbaya.
[02:57:18.717 --> 02:57:20.158]  Yeah, that's one aspect of it.
[02:57:20.258 --> 02:57:25.381]  The other aspect of it is that if someone's going to officiate your wedding, psychologically,
[02:57:26.021 --> 02:57:35.324]  You're never going to be as vicious towards that person as you would have been otherwise because there's always going to be, well, you know, I'm somewhat friendly with them, you know, despite, you know, they were at my wedding.
[02:57:35.664 --> 02:57:38.424]  Did they even take him off up on the air?
[02:57:38.664 --> 02:57:38.904]  No.
[02:57:38.924 --> 02:57:41.385]  So it was it was probably out of humor.
[02:57:41.445 --> 02:57:43.406]  It's like, oh, here, let me let me.
[02:57:43.526 --> 02:57:44.966]  I kind of like Chris Angle.
[02:57:45.026 --> 02:57:46.226]  I kind of like Chris Angle.
[02:57:48.467 --> 02:57:52.251]  He officiated the wedding, but he banned MSNBC from showing up.
[02:57:52.491 --> 02:57:54.333]  We do the best weddings.
[02:57:54.393 --> 02:57:55.474]  Do we not do the best weddings?
[02:57:55.494 --> 02:57:59.398]  It's probably a joke because he can't really officiate it.
[02:57:59.858 --> 02:58:00.859]  Don't you have to be a priest?
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:02.701]  No, you can be a wedding officiate.
[02:58:02.721 --> 02:58:03.562]  You don't have to be a priest.
[02:58:04.042 --> 02:58:07.366]  So you don't have to, you can just sign them off like anyone can do it?
[02:58:07.386 --> 02:58:09.067]  You have to get a, you have to get a document.
[02:58:09.087 --> 02:58:10.249]  There's a little process you go through.
[02:58:10.269 --> 02:58:10.869]  What were you guys saying?
[02:58:10.909 --> 02:58:11.310]  I didn't hear you.
[02:58:12.401 --> 02:58:13.202]  Yeah, anyone can do it.
[02:58:13.262 --> 02:58:20.714]  You do have to get a government, some government documents, but anybody can legally marry people once you go through that process.
[02:58:21.075 --> 02:58:22.557]  Hey, alright guys, what time?
[02:58:22.978 --> 02:58:24.300]  We got Matt Bracken on the other side.
[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:25.903]  You guys want to just take a break right now?
[02:58:29.628 --> 02:58:30.929]  Okay, so here's the deal, folks.
[02:58:31.450 --> 02:58:36.995]  We are about to enter the final hour of the 30-hour Infowars Defense of Free Speech.
[02:58:37.876 --> 02:58:39.037]  It's been quite a ride.
[02:58:39.537 --> 02:58:44.962]  I know that everybody here has been working really hard, especially the staff and the crew behind the scenes that don't get near enough credit.
[02:58:45.563 --> 02:58:45.803]  But...
[02:58:46.784 --> 02:58:56.368]  They make it possible and you make it possible by going to InfoWarsStore.com and hey, you buy a great product, you get a great product and you support what we do here.
[02:58:56.388 --> 02:58:57.008]  It's a win-win.
[02:58:57.028 --> 02:59:11.633]  That's what Alex Jones loves to do and that's why he does these broadcasts so that we can get a bigger audience, reach more people, tell you about our great products and expand in the face of the real fake news like CNN and MSNBC.
[02:59:11.653 --> 02:59:13.134]  30% off Brain Force.
[02:59:13.154 --> 02:59:15.495]  You can see all the specials right there on the screen.
[02:59:16.095 --> 02:59:19.178]  We haven't even talked about the T-shirts, Trump Pants, T-shirts, hats.
[02:59:19.498 --> 02:59:20.319]  How about the toothpaste?
[02:59:20.339 --> 02:59:21.681]  I haven't even mentioned the toothpaste.
[02:59:22.161 --> 02:59:23.262]  Super Blue Toothpaste.
[02:59:23.282 --> 02:59:25.344]  You know, that's actually on sale too right now, isn't it?
[02:59:27.146 --> 02:59:25.344]  $10.
[02:59:27.847 --> 02:59:30.069]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:59:30.609 --> 02:59:37.396]  This product right here is going to compete, I think, with nascent iodine as our most popular.
[02:59:37.436 --> 02:59:38.537]  Well, you've got Brain Force too.
[02:59:39.398 --> 02:59:51.244]  This, Brain Force, and I think Nace and Iodine are going to be the three products that are going to be flirting with 4.8, 4.9 ratings their entire span, which is tough to do because these products are no joke.
[02:59:51.624 --> 02:59:52.385]  We take a break.
[02:59:52.505 --> 02:59:54.626]  Visit our store at infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:54.646 --> 02:59:59.508]  We will be back on the other side with Matt Bracken, and don't forget, Alex Jones joins us in about a half an hour.
[03:00:10.684 --> 03:00:14.055]  You love to fight?
[03:00:14.898 --> 03:00:15.621]  You're getting it!
[03:00:22.173 --> 03:00:29.256]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[03:00:29.636 --> 03:00:42.841]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[03:00:43.789 --> 03:00:55.013]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[03:00:55.674 --> 03:01:01.636]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[03:01:02.396 --> 03:01:10.784]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[03:01:11.404 --> 03:01:19.612]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[03:01:22.290 --> 03:01:28.119]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.
[03:01:28.279 --> 03:01:33.466]  Introducing Caveman, where cutting-edge science meets ancient super nutrients.
[03:01:33.707 --> 03:01:36.711]  Secure your bottle right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:01:37.332 --> 03:01:41.718]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:01:41.818 --> 03:01:52.752]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:01:52.912 --> 03:01:57.834]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:01:57.954 --> 03:02:00.475]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:02:00.535 --> 03:02:02.035]  It helps detoxify.
[03:02:02.255 --> 03:02:05.096]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:02:05.136 --> 03:02:09.878]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:02:09.898 --> 03:02:16.140]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:21.462]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:02:21.482 --> 03:02:22.262]  I'm taking it now.
[03:02:22.602 --> 03:02:22.842]  We're good.
[03:02:37.691 --> 03:02:43.194]  InfoWars is proud to announce the official InfoWars Live app, available now for iPhone and Android.

[03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:22.725]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion and in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[03:03:22.965 --> 03:03:27.730]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[03:04:07.744 --> 03:04:17.687]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:04:17.947 --> 03:04:19.888]  And this part is most important.
[03:04:20.008 --> 03:04:26.450]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:04:26.810 --> 03:04:27.890]  That means it's clean.
[03:04:28.250 --> 03:04:29.191]  That means it's pure.
[03:04:29.371 --> 03:04:32.051]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[03:04:32.271 --> 03:04:34.852]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:04:38.753 --> 03:04:44.074]  The reason InfoWars Life has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:04:44.234 --> 03:04:44.814]  I take this.
[03:04:45.075 --> 03:04:46.115]  My family takes this.
[03:04:46.195 --> 03:04:50.436]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:04:50.496 --> 03:04:54.697]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:04:55.097 --> 03:04:59.640]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:00.780]  I don't feel good.
[03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:04.382]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:05:04.622 --> 03:05:07.264]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:05:07.304 --> 03:05:12.627]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:05:13.107 --> 03:05:15.528]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:05:16.069 --> 03:05:19.490]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:05:19.611 --> 03:05:21.792]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:05:21.852 --> 03:05:22.192]  I love it.
[03:05:22.352 --> 03:05:24.955]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:05:25.176 --> 03:05:26.137]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:05:26.177 --> 03:05:31.804]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:05:31.824 --> 03:05:33.746]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:05:34.007 --> 03:05:36.049]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:05:46.633 --> 03:05:51.197]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[03:05:51.598 --> 03:05:58.024]  And now your host for the next two hours, Alex Jones and his guest, Anthony Cumia, Roger Stone, and many others.
[03:06:14.634 --> 03:06:15.574]  Welcome back.
[03:06:15.974 --> 03:06:19.996]  This is the final hour of the Defense of Free Speech 30-hour broadcast.
[03:06:20.116 --> 03:06:22.156]  Owen Schroer, Millie Weaver, Kit Daniels with you.
[03:06:22.576 --> 03:06:24.597]  We will be joined by Alex Jones shortly.
[03:06:24.617 --> 03:06:28.038]  We're still hoping to get in touch with Matt Bracken, but we don't have him right now.
[03:06:28.098 --> 03:06:31.339]  So Millie, you have a video ready that you wanted to show the audience.
[03:06:31.499 --> 03:06:43.751]  Yes, actually recently, just yesterday, Tucker Carlson did an interview on his show with a woman who was advocating for female genital mutilation or female circumcision.
[03:06:44.151 --> 03:06:54.181]  Now what was so interesting about this is that this woman was trying to pitch that we should have female circumcision in America in the name of gender equality.
[03:06:54.761 --> 03:06:55.541]  I can imagine his face.
[03:07:14.667 --> 03:07:19.912]  He was sucking on a lemon because he was like, well no, you know, female genital mutilation is wrong.
[03:07:19.972 --> 03:07:20.532]  It's horrible.
[03:07:20.573 --> 03:07:21.834]  We do not want that in the country.
[03:07:22.314 --> 03:07:33.184]  But every argument that he had, that she had for female circumcision or against it, you could have the exact same for or against male circumcision as well.
[03:07:33.765 --> 03:07:36.407]  So it was just kind of interesting and I wanted to play this clip because
[03:07:37.328 --> 03:07:39.650]  It really opens this philosophical debate up.
[03:07:40.291 --> 03:07:53.243]  What do we do in this situation where we have these feminists now who are claiming that it's unconstitutional to not allow female circumcision in America because of the sex of the child?
[03:07:53.644 --> 03:07:55.906]  They're claiming it's not gender equality.
[03:07:56.406 --> 03:07:57.407]  So are we going to see
[03:07:58.248 --> 03:08:03.414]  Females all of a sudden being circumcised in America in the name of equality.
[03:08:03.854 --> 03:08:06.917]  On the other hand... Well, I think it would be not in the name of equality.
[03:08:06.937 --> 03:08:08.579]  It would probably be in the name of a religion.
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:14.926]  But I think that... Well, they're trying to get it passed because currently right now, female circumcision is against the law.
[03:08:15.466 --> 03:08:16.507]  It's banned in America.
[03:08:16.788 --> 03:08:20.572]  They're trying to get that law reversed because they're saying it's unconstitutional.
[03:08:21.112 --> 03:08:25.076]  Now as far as, that's the other interesting aspect here, freedom of religion.
[03:08:25.756 --> 03:08:27.318]  How does religion play in here?
[03:08:27.358 --> 03:08:38.428]  Because we know that Jewish people and Muslim people and certain other people in society, it's their religious belief to practice circumcision and male circumcision as well.
[03:08:38.968 --> 03:08:40.029]  So it's just kind of interesting.
[03:08:40.069 --> 03:08:44.213]  So I wanted to roll this clip and we can add a commentary while it's going.
[03:08:44.653 --> 03:08:46.295]  So let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[03:08:46.994 --> 03:08:50.518]  Dr. Amduh chose to undergo what she calls female circumcision as an adult.
[03:08:50.539 --> 03:08:58.689]  She's also an anthropologist and in effect defends the practice of FGM, saying Western society is wrong to view it as inherently impressive.
[03:08:59.189 --> 03:09:00.411]  Dr. Amduh joins us tonight.
[03:09:00.952 --> 03:09:01.813]  Dr. Amduh, thanks for coming on.
[03:09:02.193 --> 03:09:03.573]  Thank you for having me, Tucker.
[03:09:03.613 --> 03:09:08.815]  So I'll concede this subject makes me so uncomfortable that I don't like to do segments on it.
[03:09:08.995 --> 03:09:16.457]  But I also think it's really important because I think it's so horrifying that something like this is perpetrated on young girls as the father of young girls.
[03:09:17.218 --> 03:09:20.499]  So you seem like a reasonable person and a well-educated person.
[03:09:21.219 --> 03:09:23.020]  It's amazing to me that anyone could defend this.
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:24.420]  On what grounds would you defend this?
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:30.126]  So when you opened just now you said that I defend FGM and I don't defend FGM.
[03:09:30.247 --> 03:09:31.648]  I don't defend mutilation.
[03:09:31.728 --> 03:09:34.151]  I would never defend the mutilation of anyone.
[03:09:35.392 --> 03:09:38.115]  I don't identify with the term FGM.
[03:09:38.156 --> 03:09:40.198]  So basically she doesn't see it as mutilation.
[03:09:40.238 --> 03:09:42.500]  I don't know anybody in my family who does or my community.
[03:09:42.561 --> 03:09:43.642]  She sees it as circumcision.
[03:09:44.082 --> 03:09:45.863]  Yeah, I don't know if I agree with that.
[03:09:46.023 --> 03:09:47.603]  Yeah, no, it's barbaric.
[03:09:47.843 --> 03:09:57.407]  I would say the great majority of women who are affected by what I call female circumcision practices do not see themselves as mutilated.
[03:09:57.467 --> 03:09:59.247]  That's typical feminist argument.
[03:09:59.267 --> 03:10:01.468]  Let's change wording.
[03:10:01.548 --> 03:10:01.888]  That's right.
[03:10:01.908 --> 03:10:05.509]  You know, we have feminists wanting women to wear burkas and cover their heads.
[03:10:05.589 --> 03:10:09.931]  So now we're seeing feminists thinking that female babies should be circumcised.
[03:10:10.271 --> 03:10:12.352]  I think we do need to have a discussion on what it is.
[03:10:12.392 --> 03:10:14.033]  Here's what I don't understand.
[03:10:14.073 --> 03:10:15.853]  Because I'm taking a different angle of this.
[03:10:15.873 --> 03:10:17.394]  Why are people pushing for this?
[03:10:36.414 --> 03:10:37.435]  The liberal notion?
[03:10:37.555 --> 03:10:39.517]  Was that the end of the clip, guys?
[03:10:39.997 --> 03:10:51.687]  I get the liberal notion that, okay, I mean, yes, technically we allow, I mean, okay, you can use whatever semantics you want, male genital mutilization, we call it circumcision, we allow that to happen.
[03:10:52.328 --> 03:10:54.309]  Okay, so why can't we allow that to happen to girls?
[03:10:54.369 --> 03:11:00.475]  I guess that if you want to make that liberal standpoint and say it's not equal,
[03:11:01.681 --> 03:11:02.542]  I will listen.
[03:11:02.642 --> 03:11:04.764]  I will say, okay, you know what, maybe you have a point there.
[03:11:04.784 --> 03:11:06.065]  But here's what I don't understand.
[03:11:06.866 --> 03:11:08.227]  Why are people pushing for this?
[03:11:08.467 --> 03:11:09.768]  Why is she out here bringing this up?
[03:11:09.808 --> 03:11:11.850]  Why is she saying, we need this!
[03:11:11.890 --> 03:11:12.851]  We need this equality!
[03:11:13.131 --> 03:11:14.112]  Why does it have to be brought up?
[03:11:14.132 --> 03:11:15.493]  Why can't you just let it sit there?
[03:11:15.633 --> 03:11:20.057]  Well, because we have feminists out there now grandstanding on all these Muslim causes.
[03:11:20.117 --> 03:11:21.618]  I mean, we're seeing them say, oh, well, women have it hard.
[03:11:21.638 --> 03:11:22.219]  You think that's what this is?
[03:11:22.239 --> 03:11:23.099]  You think this is another push?
[03:11:23.119 --> 03:11:26.882]  Because they have done that for so long now that they're just doing that by default.
[03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:30.973]  Basically, I was thinking about doing a video on this myself.
[03:11:31.093 --> 03:11:33.975]  It's like feminists, they empower Islam.
[03:11:34.456 --> 03:11:36.577]  It's weird because Islam doesn't empower feminists.
[03:11:36.737 --> 03:11:39.220]  It's part of the brainwashing.
[03:11:39.260 --> 03:11:42.142]  Let's go back to this clip because it gets really interesting.
[03:11:42.282 --> 03:11:42.903]  See, I'm just curious.
[03:11:43.083 --> 03:11:50.449]  Does this woman really care about female genital mutilization that much or does she just want to be a good liberal, a good social justice warrior?
[03:11:50.799 --> 03:11:51.639]  Well, let's find out.
[03:11:52.519 --> 03:12:05.902]  In the media, in the mainstream media, and obviously through activist efforts and women's groups, it's the idea of the most horrific type of procedure, which is type 3.
[03:12:06.142 --> 03:12:12.944]  WHO classifies this as type 3 infibulation that involves the suturing and sewing up of the labia majora.
[03:12:13.604 --> 03:12:21.246]  This is a very rare procedure that is confined basically to a specific part of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Horn of Africa.
[03:12:21.586 --> 03:12:28.368]  It makes up less than 10% of the entire prevalence of the procedures in Sub-Saharan Africa.
[03:12:28.488 --> 03:12:32.048]  How can we ban female genital mutilation?
[03:12:32.148 --> 03:12:33.949]  Excuse me, I keep mispronouncing that word.
[03:12:34.449 --> 03:12:37.531]  She referred to it as a minor operation or as a NIC.
[03:12:37.831 --> 03:12:40.153]  Keep this in mind though.
[03:12:40.193 --> 03:12:44.256]  You can abort your entire baby!
[03:12:46.637 --> 03:12:47.998]  Everything is just so screwed up.
[03:12:48.078 --> 03:12:49.779]  I can't even deal with this.
[03:12:49.839 --> 03:13:00.727]  The other problem with this is that girls, when they had this procedure, when they grow up, they typically have mental problems because it's not natural.
[03:13:01.007 --> 03:13:04.388]  Well, the other question is, well, what about boy babies?
[03:13:05.209 --> 03:13:06.329]  Well, I went down in Houston.
[03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:09.351]  Well, there's controversy now about male circumcision.
[03:13:09.391 --> 03:13:15.713]  Well, I was going to say, you were in Houston, there were protesters out there protesting against the circumcision of males.
[03:13:15.853 --> 03:13:18.414]  They were literally dressed up in blood.
[03:13:18.454 --> 03:13:21.496]  Exactly, and my whole thing on it is, well,
[03:13:22.496 --> 03:13:25.078]  Should we be making those choices for children?
[03:13:25.539 --> 03:13:32.364]  You know, people want to talk about women's rights and men's rights, but what about children's rights?
[03:13:32.785 --> 03:13:38.289]  Because if a child does not have the right, they don't have the ability to say, no, I don't want this and stand their ground.
[03:13:38.609 --> 03:13:40.091]  And a lot of the babies do.
[03:13:40.151 --> 03:13:44.134]  I mean, even in the male circumstances, they have to trap them down because they fight.
[03:13:44.174 --> 03:13:45.275]  They're like, get away, get off.
[03:13:45.335 --> 03:13:50.239]  If they can take away consent from children now with this, it's going to pave the way to pedophile rights.
[03:13:50.359 --> 03:13:50.799]  That's right.
[03:13:50.859 --> 03:13:56.622]  I mean, what if some of these satanic groups decide to say, it's our religious practice to have sex with children?
[03:13:56.882 --> 03:13:57.162]  Oh, sure.
[03:13:57.182 --> 03:13:59.784]  It's our religious practice to sacrifice children.
[03:14:00.004 --> 03:14:05.487]  So at what point do human rights draw the line over religious rights?
[03:14:05.847 --> 03:14:08.108]  I mean, it's a very delicate balance.
[03:14:08.288 --> 03:14:11.610]  And this is the ultimate debate that it comes down to with every issue.
[03:14:11.691 --> 03:14:18.976]  And I guess my issue is why, it's just, our priorities are so out of whack.
[03:14:19.036 --> 03:14:21.558]  We can't even operate on a level playing field.
[03:14:21.618 --> 03:14:22.859]  It's like we don't even know what we're doing.
[03:14:23.319 --> 03:14:29.164]  How can we have policies in America where you can abort your baby, okay, you can abort your baby,
[03:14:29.764 --> 03:14:36.008]  But as soon as that baby is born, you can't do this to them, you have to put a vaccine in them, then all of a sudden it's out of your hands.
[03:14:36.308 --> 03:14:40.030]  But if you want to kill that baby before it's born, then you have the right to do that.
[03:14:40.210 --> 03:14:43.812]  But as soon as that baby is born, you don't have the right to do anything to it.
[03:14:43.892 --> 03:14:51.717]  So that's why you have to put drastic restrictions on abortion and even outlaw it completely, because you could use that same argument.
[03:14:53.298 --> 03:14:56.401]  People were talking about after having a child, aborting it.
[03:14:56.421 --> 03:14:57.723]  It's like, okay, you mean killing it?
[03:14:58.103 --> 03:15:01.427]  So, you know, you'd want to reel that in drastically.
[03:15:01.447 --> 03:15:10.457]  But as far as children's rights, I mean, what if we had a people who decided it was their religion to tattoo the baby's entire face?
[03:15:10.737 --> 03:15:11.617]  Okay, let's just say that.
[03:15:11.637 --> 03:15:15.018]  Let's just say, tattoo their face, it's permanent, it's painful.
[03:15:15.438 --> 03:15:21.560]  Should we allow that practice to go on in the United States because of religion?
[03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:22.781]  Freedom of religion?
[03:15:22.981 --> 03:15:23.961]  Or do we draw a line?
[03:15:23.981 --> 03:15:25.441]  Like, and how do we draw these lines?
[03:15:25.482 --> 03:15:29.603]  Because we've already done it with female circumcision, so why do we allow that?
[03:15:29.623 --> 03:15:31.083]  Well, hopefully we never get to that point.
[03:15:31.103 --> 03:15:36.985]  It's just, to me, the liberals are so desperate at this point that they're literally taking up the cause of female genital mutilation.
[03:15:37.145 --> 03:15:40.688]  And the feminists, to me, they're not even framing this as a religious debate.
[03:15:40.848 --> 03:15:42.570]  I mean, this is just a barbaric feminist thing.
[03:15:42.590 --> 03:15:43.090]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:44.171]  They'll just take any cause.
[03:15:44.191 --> 03:15:45.312]  They will literally take any cause.
[03:15:45.332 --> 03:15:46.653]  Hey, we've got a guest we've got to get to, guys.
[03:15:46.914 --> 03:15:49.716]  We've got Matt Bracken ready to go on Skype.
[03:15:50.036 --> 03:15:51.578]  Let's bring on Matt Bracken.
[03:15:51.598 --> 03:15:59.905]  You know, Matt, you could probably talk about the female oppression with the genital mutilation that goes on in the Middle East and the oppression of women that goes on over there.
[03:16:00.185 --> 03:16:01.686]  It looks like they're trying to bring this here.
[03:16:01.786 --> 03:16:03.208]  Every day we hear new stories, Matt.
[03:16:05.251 --> 03:16:08.013]  I would have to start going back to the Tucker Carlson interview.
[03:16:08.033 --> 03:16:09.834]  Do you believe that woman?
[03:16:10.275 --> 03:16:15.058]  You know, about the different levels of female genital mutilation?
[03:16:15.078 --> 03:16:16.679]  I mean, do you trust her?
[03:16:17.159 --> 03:16:19.141]  Because, you know, they lie to little girls.
[03:16:19.161 --> 03:16:20.161]  We're not talking about infants.
[03:16:20.181 --> 03:16:28.287]  We're talking about, you know, like 9, 10, 11-year-old girls are told they're going to see, you know, Aunt Sarah somewhere, and they're just going to feel a little nick.
[03:16:28.945 --> 03:16:40.889]  And it's a complete lie to lure her into feeling safe enough to where they can then hold her down and basically put her into a position where she can't defend herself.
[03:16:42.219 --> 03:16:58.004]  Comparing female genital mutilation to male circumcision, I think, is pretty bogus because it's not only a religious ritual, but there's proven scientific, medically documented advantages, especially in countries with poor hygiene.
[03:16:58.324 --> 03:17:02.365]  This might not apply in modern Europe, but in sub-Saharan Africa,
[03:17:03.655 --> 03:17:12.408]  Thousands of years ago or today, there's a far lower incidence of diseases for males who are circumcised.
[03:17:13.146 --> 03:17:14.807]  Just because of the lack of hygiene.
[03:17:15.067 --> 03:17:21.969]  Well, a lot of those, a lot of those, like some of the myths surrounding circumcision have been debunked.
[03:17:22.010 --> 03:17:27.532]  I mean, they've actually said that, they used to say that it prevented them from masturbating a lot.
[03:17:28.172 --> 03:17:30.193]  And that turned out not to be true.
[03:17:30.273 --> 03:17:31.733]  No, it's a health thing.
[03:17:31.773 --> 03:17:32.534]  I mean, it's a health thing.
[03:17:32.574 --> 03:17:35.835]  Like a lot of the old, like restrictions against pork, for example.
[03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:48.358]  You know, went back to living in a desert place with very limited water and that, you know, there was diseases associated with pork and also that the pigs were very bad.
[03:17:48.378 --> 03:17:52.681]  If you have a small oasis with only a spring, you can't have pigs wallowing in it.
[03:17:53.321 --> 03:17:56.643]  So there are reasons for some of these things that go back in antiquity.
[03:17:57.044 --> 03:18:06.310]  But as far as it being a terrible mutilation of boys, to compare that to the type of female genital mutilation that Ayaan Hirsi Ali suffered,
[03:18:06.890 --> 03:18:15.974]  Would be to cut off say the last two inches of the male part, you know to completely obliterate the Sexual enjoyment for life.
[03:18:16.234 --> 03:18:29.899]  Well, there are different there are different levels though in you know Because you did ask about that there are different there are there there's parts where they just cut out like the the labia There's parts when they sew together and there's parts where they completely remove the clitters so different
[03:18:30.419 --> 03:18:32.861]  But it's all an oppression of women though.
[03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:33.241]  Yes.
[03:18:33.381 --> 03:18:34.642]  It's all an oppression of women.
[03:18:34.662 --> 03:18:38.404]  They're not oppressing men by circumcising them, they're oppressing women by this.
[03:18:38.424 --> 03:18:41.005]  They're doing it to obliterate their sexual response.
[03:18:41.045 --> 03:18:43.327]  They don't want women to enjoy sex.
[03:18:43.847 --> 03:18:47.129]  In fact, they... Women can't enjoy anything in these cultures.
[03:18:47.489 --> 03:18:47.869]  Anything.
[03:18:47.949 --> 03:18:58.636]  And in fact, if a woman is experiencing pain during sex, they find that great because it'll inhibit her from going outside of the marriage, the arranged forced marriage,
[03:18:59.136 --> 03:19:01.757]  To maybe fool around because sex is gonna be hell for her.
[03:19:02.298 --> 03:19:08.701]  The only reason that she has sex is to make more male babies and more male baby incubators that are women.
[03:19:09.201 --> 03:19:11.102]  That's the only reason for women to have sex.
[03:19:11.562 --> 03:19:16.725]  There's a saying, I have a friend that served in Iraq and Afghanistan bunches of times.
[03:19:17.445 --> 03:19:26.888]  And he said there's a saying in Pashtun that, you know, that you've heard probably, you know, that the boys are for pleasure and women are for babies.
[03:19:27.288 --> 03:19:36.251]  But there's a saying, you know, about if you can't find a boy, then you find a goat.
[03:19:36.271 --> 03:19:38.512]  And if you can't find a goat, you find an old shoe.
[03:19:39.312 --> 03:19:41.313]  And if you can't find an old shoe, you find a woman.
[03:19:41.849 --> 03:19:44.450]  So, you know, they're just really messed up in that department.
[03:19:44.770 --> 03:19:54.194]  Well, you know, what's interesting is that in these countries, they tend to circumcise the boys at a later date, a later age, and the girls at a later age.
[03:19:54.734 --> 03:19:58.936]  And it is pretty traumatic for both the children to have that happen to them.
[03:19:58.996 --> 03:20:00.457]  They both experience the pain.
[03:20:01.217 --> 03:20:07.480]  Whereas in the Western world, it is when the baby, it's usually a male child when he is
[03:20:08.320 --> 03:20:28.711]  A big part of this is a cultural aspect also, which is like a mass cult indoctrination, like a mass Stockholm Syndrome, where it's sort of like when hazing rituals at universities or within the military
[03:20:29.301 --> 03:20:36.644]  They tend to add one layer by layer, get worse and worse until somebody dies, you know, or somebody, you know, is crippled.
[03:20:37.664 --> 03:20:42.606]  And then there's a big investigation and hazing is outlawed, then it creeps back in.
[03:20:43.006 --> 03:20:46.448]  Well, who does this female genital mutilation?
[03:20:46.528 --> 03:20:46.928]  It's not men.
[03:20:47.868 --> 03:20:52.951]  It's generally women, their aunts, their cousins, that hold the girl down.
[03:20:53.332 --> 03:20:56.253]  It was done to them, and we're going to do it to you.
[03:20:56.273 --> 03:20:59.055]  But that's the same mentality that's used for the boys.
[03:20:59.255 --> 03:21:03.498]  Most of the time the fathers want it done to their sons because they want them to be the same as them.
[03:21:04.078 --> 03:21:05.079]  It's not a group thing.
[03:21:05.639 --> 03:21:10.821]  In this Minnesota case, it was an actual medical doctor trained, I believe, in America.
[03:21:11.321 --> 03:21:29.447]  But in the Middle East and in Sub-Saharan Africa, this is a ritual, like something that Indians would do in a sweat lodge, where two or three young girls, 9, 10, 11 years old, are tricked and lured into a tent, where they're basically jumped.
[03:21:30.006 --> 03:21:38.432]  By the rest of the female, the tribal, you know, their aunts and sisters and older sisters and cousins, they're jumped and held down.
[03:21:39.053 --> 03:21:52.803]  So it's like a group beatdown situation and their mental excuse is, you'll never be married because men will find you disgusting and sexually perverted if you still have your clitoris.
[03:21:53.713 --> 03:21:59.176]  We have to remove it from you so that you can at least get married like we got married.
[03:21:59.196 --> 03:22:03.418]  I mean, imagine how screwed up this entire culture is.
[03:22:03.498 --> 03:22:04.358]  Wow, I'm shocked.
[03:22:04.398 --> 03:22:11.602]  Why do I hear all these stories about women trying to escape Saudi Arabia and then they get captured and they're afraid they're going to get killed when they go back by their family?
[03:22:12.381 --> 03:22:13.041]  This is terrible.
[03:22:13.341 --> 03:22:20.704]  Well, don't you think it's pretty bizarre that you have these feminists advocating for female circumcision in America?
[03:22:20.724 --> 03:22:22.565]  Well, let me even go more broadly.
[03:22:22.605 --> 03:22:27.527]  It's like, why are feminists pushing all these Islamic policies and these Islamic culture?
[03:22:28.530 --> 03:22:36.013]  Well, we're seeing a we're seeing a blending actually, because remember, both of these are totalitarian total control systems.
[03:22:36.113 --> 03:22:37.314]  So they have that in common.
[03:22:37.754 --> 03:22:39.815]  They both they both depend on lies.
[03:22:39.835 --> 03:22:42.416]  You know, you it's the ends justify the means.
[03:22:42.936 --> 03:22:45.317]  So both of them have systems for
[03:22:46.261 --> 03:22:50.863]  Introducing socialism or Islamism in stages.
[03:22:50.943 --> 03:23:05.431]  They both have a systematized process of inculcating these ideas, not just saying, look buddy, when we're in charge, there's going to be a hammer and sickle, there's going to be a gulag, and you'll probably be in front of a firing squad.
[03:23:05.791 --> 03:23:07.612]  They don't sell communism that way.
[03:23:08.032 --> 03:23:12.894]  They don't sell Islam by saying, at the end of the road is hardcore Sharia.
[03:23:13.595 --> 03:23:14.075]  They both
[03:23:14.764 --> 03:23:19.449]  They both sell it, and I guess this Linda Sarsour character, she's like the perfect amalgam.
[03:23:20.169 --> 03:23:24.033]  She's actually saying socialism is great, Sharia law is great.
[03:23:24.173 --> 03:23:26.175]  Oh, if you knew more about it, you would love it.
[03:23:26.575 --> 03:23:27.897]  They don't tell you the truth.
[03:23:28.177 --> 03:23:30.159]  Both of these groups lie about it.
[03:23:30.639 --> 03:23:32.161]  They're both allied together.
[03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:37.496]  I think that each thinks that at the end of the day, their system will be on top.
[03:23:37.556 --> 03:23:45.786]  They just have to destroy freedom, destroy Western civilization, and then it'll be a battle royale between Islamism and socialism.
[03:23:46.086 --> 03:23:47.768]  But I can tell you how that one works out.
[03:23:48.108 --> 03:23:50.872]  Islam always works because they're the head choppers.
[03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:58.558]  In fact, the famous terrorist from the 70s, Carlos de Jekyll, converted in prison to Islam.
[03:23:58.939 --> 03:24:14.172]  He actually wrote an open letter to Obama after he was inaugurated, you know, a la Akbar Obama, it's time for you to come out and convert publicly because only Islam plus socialism can beat capitalism.
[03:24:14.753 --> 03:24:17.195]  So in the end of the day, socialists
[03:24:18.186 --> 03:24:22.269]  Aren't going to fight for socialism the way that Muslims will fight for Islam.
[03:24:22.769 --> 03:24:26.431]  So in that final battle, you can see it playing out in Europe.
[03:24:26.772 --> 03:24:29.974]  All of those Antifa's, they'll be at the mosque.
[03:24:30.414 --> 03:24:34.617]  Because if you really fervently believe in Islam, nobody's going to change your mind.
[03:24:35.157 --> 03:24:37.279]  But if you're a socialist, what do you really believe in?
[03:24:37.299 --> 03:24:40.761]  You're going to die for Marxism?
[03:24:41.565 --> 03:24:50.268]  If you're told, look, if you want to keep your head on your shoulders, all you've got to do is say this 10-word prayer called the Shahada, you're in the club!
[03:24:50.688 --> 03:24:55.170]  It's just like socialism with a little bit of praying five times a day.
[03:24:56.210 --> 03:25:02.092]  Who's going to say, no, I'd rather have my head chopped off because I believe so strongly in Karl Marx?
[03:25:03.235 --> 03:25:04.676]  But people would do that.
[03:25:04.716 --> 03:25:06.918]  People would say, I'd rather have my head chopped off.
[03:25:07.399 --> 03:25:08.320]  Christians would say that.
[03:25:08.860 --> 03:25:09.821]  I can see that happening.
[03:25:10.041 --> 03:25:16.507]  I don't think that most of these socialism commies marching in the street probably even know who Karl Marx is, to be honest with you.
[03:25:16.547 --> 03:25:18.689]  But I think that you just nailed it on the head.
[03:25:19.608 --> 03:25:23.030]  And I'm gonna actually make a WWE analogy as ridiculous as that sounds.
[03:25:23.690 --> 03:25:26.752]  It's all of these people aligning against capitalism.
[03:25:27.052 --> 03:25:29.594]  See, everybody's been told capitalism is the enemy.
[03:25:30.034 --> 03:25:33.776]  Everybody's been told capitalism is the reason for everything gone wrong in the world.
[03:25:34.036 --> 03:25:35.177]  That it's all capitalists.
[03:25:35.217 --> 03:25:39.420]  And if we get rid of the bad capitalists, well we can actually start fixing the world again with socialism.
[03:25:40.180 --> 03:25:43.264]  But then of course, as you said, these groups are allied together.
[03:25:43.344 --> 03:25:46.728]  So you've got the socialists, the communists and the Islamic people all allied together.
[03:25:47.028 --> 03:25:53.836]  It's like if you've got the one big guy in the ring that you can't beat unless you tag up with the other guys.
[03:25:54.156 --> 03:25:54.997]  So everybody says
[03:25:55.177 --> 03:25:59.260]  Alright, you know, maybe we don't get along, but we're both going to get crushed by this guy.
[03:25:59.360 --> 03:26:02.381]  So let's tag, let's tag up, let's team up for it together.
[03:26:02.682 --> 03:26:03.962]  Let's take down capitalism.
[03:26:04.263 --> 03:26:08.665]  And then as you said, once they take down capitalism, they'll both kind of be there in a power struggle.
[03:26:09.045 --> 03:26:14.869]  And the socialists and commies who we see on the street are so weak-kneed, they'll cater right over to Islam and Islam will take over.
[03:26:14.909 --> 03:26:16.430]  I think that that's the equation.
[03:26:16.590 --> 03:26:27.220]  I doubt that they could actually win against the conservative groups out there because even the other day in Austin, we had this giant group of conservatives went out there fully armed.
[03:26:27.661 --> 03:26:29.483]  Okay, these are ex-military members.
[03:26:29.523 --> 03:26:31.224]  These are people who are law enforcement.
[03:26:31.625 --> 03:26:36.790]  I mean, on their time off, going out there and the commies were absolutely terrified.
[03:26:36.810 --> 03:26:37.711]  You could see it in their eyes.
[03:26:38.351 --> 03:26:46.773]  I mean, as far as the reality of some Muslim Sharia law takeover in the United States, it's not going to be met without an extreme resistance.
[03:26:47.253 --> 03:26:51.074]  And it's a political will, and the resistance was Donald Trump.
[03:26:51.114 --> 03:26:52.995]  Go ahead, Matt Bracken.
[03:26:53.115 --> 03:26:56.416]  This is the big citadel of civilization in America.
[03:26:57.396 --> 03:27:02.077]  You can make fun of McDonald's and Disney World, but this is the final redoubt, the last rampart.
[03:27:04.078 --> 03:27:04.918]  If you go back 1,400 years,
[03:27:06.719 --> 03:27:12.221]  One empire after another has gone up against Islam and lost.
[03:27:12.862 --> 03:27:19.524]  Islam has beaten stronger, smarter, wealthier people over and over again.
[03:27:19.945 --> 03:27:29.889]  When the Mongols invaded all the way into Europe and the Balkan area, the Kublai Khan, guess what?
[03:27:30.409 --> 03:27:32.670]  A couple hundred years later, guess what their religion was?
[03:27:33.524 --> 03:27:34.966]  In Crimea, Islam.
[03:27:35.466 --> 03:27:44.277]  So they are very strong militarily, scientifically, they came right through, but when they rubbed up against Islam, Islam won.
[03:27:45.146 --> 03:27:45.966]  You look at Turkey.
[03:27:46.066 --> 03:27:49.508]  Turkey's what, 98% or 95% Muslim now?
[03:27:50.028 --> 03:27:51.068]  It used to be Christian.
[03:27:51.408 --> 03:27:54.489]  It used to be one of the strongest parts of the Christian world.
[03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:59.211]  And now Erdogan is warning about how he's going to Islamify the rest of Europe violently.
[03:27:59.911 --> 03:28:00.912]  And they've done it before.
[03:28:00.952 --> 03:28:02.412]  Why wouldn't they believe that?
[03:28:02.712 --> 03:28:06.774]  When the scrawny desert Arabs, I just, physically scrawny,
[03:28:07.586 --> 03:28:20.439]  When across the Mediterranean, the southern shore of the Mediterranean, when they got to the to Western West Africa, Northwest Africa, the Maghreb, the Atlas Mountains, they ran into a group of people called the Berbers.
[03:28:21.135 --> 03:28:25.496]  And the Berbers outweighed them and were inches taller.
[03:28:25.616 --> 03:28:26.616]  They were fighters.
[03:28:26.856 --> 03:28:28.097]  They were warriors.
[03:28:28.197 --> 03:28:35.419]  The Berbers were amazing people in every way, man for man, stronger, tougher, smarter than the Arabs.
[03:28:35.879 --> 03:28:37.399]  But the Arabs were cohesive.
[03:28:37.439 --> 03:28:38.720]  The Berbers were divided.
[03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:44.801]  The Arabs took over one valley at a time, forcibly converted them.
[03:28:45.441 --> 03:28:48.302]  And a generation later, their children are fervent
[03:28:48.891 --> 03:28:49.431]  We're good to go.
[03:29:12.933 --> 03:29:19.981]  It was Berbers who had been Islamified in just a couple of decades and then invaded Spain and took over.
[03:29:20.342 --> 03:29:22.064]  So that's my fear in Europe.
[03:29:24.202 --> 03:29:27.925]  One empire, one people after another has been taken down by Islam.
[03:29:27.965 --> 03:29:30.606]  It's very hard to defeat this strategy.
[03:29:30.827 --> 03:29:32.047]  It's a conquest strategy.
[03:29:32.348 --> 03:29:34.309]  It's a relentless conquest strategy.
[03:29:34.329 --> 03:29:37.091]  It uses terrorism, lies, any tactic.
[03:29:37.511 --> 03:29:39.492]  It's fair game against non-Muslims.
[03:29:39.932 --> 03:29:44.636]  But what happens if the Germans and the French become Islamified?
[03:29:44.856 --> 03:29:51.300]  We're not going to be talking about inbred, first cousin, you know, Saudis.
[03:29:51.660 --> 03:29:52.801]  We're going to be talking about
[03:29:53.633 --> 03:29:59.279]  Half Dolph Lundgrens that are now fervent, you know, the zeal of the convert.
[03:29:59.460 --> 03:30:09.871]  They're going to be fervent Muslims and they're going to have the smarts of, you know, von Braun and the DNA of the, you know, the German warriors.
[03:30:10.191 --> 03:30:12.734]  And they're going to be tough to beat.
[03:30:12.774 --> 03:30:14.376]  You know, imagine the Turks
[03:30:15.566 --> 03:30:16.847]  They used to be Christians.
[03:30:16.947 --> 03:30:20.609]  Did the Christians say, we're going to roll over and become Islam?
[03:30:20.989 --> 03:30:23.110]  They probably laughed, like in Europe they laugh.
[03:30:23.210 --> 03:30:25.692]  Oh, we could never be taken over by Muslims.
[03:30:26.152 --> 03:30:26.652]  Look at them.
[03:30:26.692 --> 03:30:27.573]  They're backward.
[03:30:27.773 --> 03:30:29.174]  They only read one book.
[03:30:29.574 --> 03:30:33.676]  You know, they don't use toilet paper, shall we say.
[03:30:34.056 --> 03:30:34.737]  Who won?
[03:30:34.757 --> 03:30:36.258]  It's such an archaic
[03:30:41.258 --> 03:30:46.763]  form of conquering, such an archaic form of invasion, that most people wouldn't even understand it.
[03:30:46.803 --> 03:30:47.704]  They wouldn't even think of it.
[03:30:47.964 --> 03:30:52.328]  It's always more effective to conquer someone culturally than it is militarily.
[03:30:52.368 --> 03:30:53.449]  We talk about the Turks.
[03:30:54.050 --> 03:31:06.441]  The Byzantines, they lost Anatolia over about three, four hundred years because the Turks, yeah you had a battle of Manzikert, but then you had the first crusade and the Christians basically took over most of the land back.
[03:31:07.082 --> 03:31:12.346]  But what they weren't able to do was take Turkey back culturally.
[03:31:12.827 --> 03:31:19.412]  You know, by the time of the fall of Constantinople, like 300-400 years later, the whole region was already Islam.
[03:31:20.973 --> 03:31:21.353]  Right.
[03:31:21.514 --> 03:31:25.837]  And you can see a similar process played out in the 20th century with socialism.
[03:31:26.498 --> 03:31:30.201]  Antonio Gramsci, an Italian socialist in the 1920s.
[03:31:30.241 --> 03:31:31.101]  Yeah, cultural Marxism.
[03:31:32.833 --> 03:31:35.395]  He said, Lenin, you're all wet.
[03:31:35.455 --> 03:31:36.395]  This isn't going to work.
[03:31:36.436 --> 03:31:42.039]  You're not going to, you know, sneak spies into Europe and take over, you know, bring Bolshevism to Europe.
[03:31:42.099 --> 03:31:42.840]  It will never work.
[03:31:43.821 --> 03:31:50.065]  What he said was, we have to get inside of the institutions and poison the roots.
[03:31:50.529 --> 03:31:56.193]  We have to make them hate their religion, hate their patriotism, and then the structure will fall from within.
[03:31:56.693 --> 03:31:57.774]  Ramsey was right.
[03:31:58.014 --> 03:32:13.103]  So it was a stealth invasion of the institutions, the long march through the institutions, that won, which has put us in a position where our universities are now like a Chinese Cultural Revolution little Red Book factory.
[03:32:13.966 --> 03:32:33.935]  It goes back to the whole Islam thing is that the communists in South America, they always struggled to overthrow the government because, or at least get the people into communism because the Catholic Church was so strong in each country that they couldn't take over the country without taking over the Catholic Church.
[03:32:34.395 --> 03:32:36.716]  And now they did just that.
[03:32:36.756 --> 03:32:38.477]  They took over from inside.
[03:32:38.677 --> 03:32:40.017]  Now you have liberation theology.
[03:32:40.037 --> 03:32:41.258]  Now you have Pope Francis.
[03:32:43.240 --> 03:32:44.242]  That's way in a helicopter.
[03:32:56.883 --> 03:33:08.457]  Yeah, it's a Vatican coup, and that's why we have a Marxist Pope, you know, holding that, you've seen that picture of him holding the hammer and sickle crucifix, which is an abomination.
[03:33:08.817 --> 03:33:17.147]  Pope John Paul II would have, you know, used that thing like a hammer and split Evo Morales's head open if Evo Morales had handed it to him.
[03:33:17.287 --> 03:33:22.308]  Yeah, I think that the entire Vatican at this point is an abomination in my opinion.
[03:33:22.348 --> 03:33:23.048]  Those are my words.
[03:33:23.108 --> 03:33:24.868]  But you know Matt, I'd like to ask you one question.
[03:33:24.888 --> 03:33:25.889]  We're waiting for Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.929 --> 03:33:28.189]  I'm not sure if Alex wants to join Matt with us guys.
[03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:29.909]  If you could just give me an update on Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.969 --> 03:33:31.650]  I just sent a message to Nico.
[03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:36.251]  Tell me how they can pull this off and what do you think, if this was an overall plan.
[03:33:36.291 --> 03:33:37.411]  We know how the globalists work.
[03:33:37.751 --> 03:33:40.351]  We know how they create chaos and then take advantage of it.
[03:33:43.373 --> 03:33:44.493]  Well, I just want to point this out.
[03:33:44.513 --> 03:33:45.454]  I want to hear your thoughts on this.
[03:33:45.474 --> 03:33:59.938]  So, they use the September 11th attacks to demonize Muslims, demonize Islam, and create the war on terror, and our excuse to inject ourselves into the Middle East for a greater conflict in that region.
[03:33:59.998 --> 03:34:09.321]  Okay, so that happens, and now we've got this war, now we've got these, you know, we can't fly without getting our bodies scanned and all this stuff because of radical Islamic terror.
[03:34:09.801 --> 03:34:10.822]  But now here we are,
[03:34:11.582 --> 03:34:19.027]  And they're using social justice virtue signaling to open borders and tolerance of these people to bring them in!
[03:34:20.167 --> 03:34:28.593]  How can they have this blatant flip right in the public's eye, right in the mainstream media, without anybody ever addressing it?
[03:34:28.693 --> 03:34:30.134]  Nobody ever addresses this, Matt.
[03:34:30.354 --> 03:34:40.340]  They use 9-11, they demonize these people, say we're at war with them, say it's radical Islam that crashed the towers, but now here we are 15 years later and we're saying, oh this is wrong,
[03:34:40.580 --> 03:34:44.363]  We're being racist, we're being Islamophobe, we need to have open borders and be tolerant.
[03:34:44.543 --> 03:34:45.483]  How did we get to this point?
[03:34:45.523 --> 03:34:58.953]  And because now that they're here, they have people advocating to change our social norms and customs to put female circumcision in so that it can be part of their religious practice in America.
[03:35:01.351 --> 03:35:05.015]  There are some things that you can look at and see that it's like a litmus test.
[03:35:05.175 --> 03:35:06.116]  It's an up or down.
[03:35:06.656 --> 03:35:09.059]  Like, you know, Trump ran on building the wall.
[03:35:09.119 --> 03:35:10.240]  Is there going to be a wall built?
[03:35:10.300 --> 03:35:10.540]  No.
[03:35:11.341 --> 03:35:12.482]  This is the deep state.
[03:35:12.642 --> 03:35:13.643]  Did he want to build a wall?
[03:35:13.703 --> 03:35:13.964]  Yes.
[03:35:14.084 --> 03:35:16.286]  But the deep state is more powerful than the president.
[03:35:16.666 --> 03:35:23.293]  So they used 9-11, I wouldn't say to demonize Islam because they, you know, they still are very politically correct about that.
[03:35:23.894 --> 03:35:37.857]  But they used the 9-11 to basically ramp up the security state, you know, to turn us into as much of a police state as possible, to control us, you know, to spy on us, to search us, to make kids used to being searched.
[03:35:39.398 --> 03:35:42.879]  But you see, if they really wanted to protect the country, there'd be a wall.
[03:35:42.899 --> 03:35:45.339]  There's no wall, there won't be a wall, it's all BS.
[03:35:45.579 --> 03:35:46.880]  So I hear what you're saying, but...
[03:35:48.504 --> 03:35:51.886]  They did say that it was radical Islam that brought down the towers.
[03:35:52.146 --> 03:35:57.669]  So why is it that we just ignore that false narrative that they sold us now and we have to be open and tolerant of them?
[03:35:58.329 --> 03:36:06.033]  Well, you don't think that it was radical Islam that... I'm saying, what I'm saying is it was the United States government that probably allowed this to happen.
[03:36:06.073 --> 03:36:07.734]  There were inside sources that allowed it to happen.
[03:36:07.754 --> 03:36:08.695]  That's my opinion.
[03:36:08.735 --> 03:36:12.917]  I don't think that all this could have just happened via Osama Bin Laden in a cave.
[03:36:14.006 --> 03:36:20.509]  I think you're wrong, and I think that there's a few markers that are really important to study, like looking at the border wall.
[03:36:20.569 --> 03:36:21.530]  Is there a wall being built?
[03:36:21.570 --> 03:36:22.130]  Yes or no?
[03:36:22.510 --> 03:36:29.033]  Well, before the attack, I would say that it's a combination of incompetence and politically correct cowardice.
[03:36:30.073 --> 03:36:35.696]  Don't underestimate the power of politically correct cowardice
[03:36:36.388 --> 03:36:43.474]  To cause us to lose our minds or to absolutely put ourselves in a vulnerable situation.
[03:36:43.854 --> 03:36:47.898]  The 20th hijacker, I think his name began with a Z, I can't remember.
[03:36:48.658 --> 03:36:50.720]  He had only taken like Cessna lessons.
[03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:57.726]  He went to Minneapolis to the company that has the world's greatest 747 simulator.
[03:36:58.426 --> 03:37:01.709]  And he tried to pay in cash, like a briefcase full of hundreds.
[03:37:02.532 --> 03:37:07.555]  The company thought this was so amazingly suspicious that they called the FBI.
[03:37:07.996 --> 03:37:12.038]  Said we have something that is just outrageously superstitious or suspicious.
[03:37:12.439 --> 03:37:17.682]  This guy wants to learn to fly a 747, doesn't want to learn to land, and he tried to pay in cash.
[03:37:18.162 --> 03:37:19.804]  And he's only flown a Cessna before.
[03:37:20.384 --> 03:37:22.966]  So the FBI has the whole case on a platter.
[03:37:23.026 --> 03:37:23.506]  Here it is.
[03:37:23.966 --> 03:37:24.647]  Here's the case.
[03:37:25.267 --> 03:37:26.288]  He's got a laptop.
[03:37:27.136 --> 03:37:28.957]  The whole plot is inside the laptop.
[03:37:29.237 --> 03:37:41.462]  The FBI gets the laptop, and the legal minds within the FBI, their own attorneys, said, the guy was a parole on visa overstay, I believe.
[03:37:41.522 --> 03:37:42.782]  So they had a reason to pull him in.
[03:37:43.523 --> 03:37:44.783]  Now they've got his laptop.
[03:37:45.063 --> 03:37:48.905]  He's trying to take 747 lessons, paying with cash.
[03:37:49.845 --> 03:37:53.887]  And the FBI, because of political correct cowardice, said,
[03:37:54.611 --> 03:37:56.553]  This is going to look like Islamophobia.
[03:37:56.693 --> 03:37:58.955]  All we've got him for is a visa overstay.
[03:37:59.475 --> 03:38:01.697]  They would not look inside his laptop.
[03:38:01.737 --> 03:38:03.699]  They wouldn't open his hard drive.
[03:38:04.379 --> 03:38:07.722]  After the 9-11 happens, the whole plot's inside of his laptop.
[03:38:09.232 --> 03:38:15.637]  Did this mean that somebody high up within the Pentagon or the CIA said, sure, let's let 9-11 happen?
[03:38:16.117 --> 03:38:16.978]  I don't believe so.
[03:38:17.098 --> 03:38:18.859]  I think they were so petrified.
[03:38:19.179 --> 03:38:26.425]  They were such politically correct cowards that they wouldn't even look in a super suspicious Saudis laptop.
[03:38:27.846 --> 03:38:31.309]  I'm not discounting what you're saying, and I think that the way you broke it down makes sense.
[03:38:31.389 --> 03:38:42.300]  However, I would just add that it wasn't political correctness that magically left a passport sitting on top of a pile of rubble, and it wasn't political correctness that brought the towers down in free fall.
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:50.225]  However, I do hear what you're saying and I do think that that actually does make sense as far as one aspect of the whole picture.
[03:38:50.245 --> 03:38:54.368]  I've had this guest on, Lewis Buff Perry, who actually worked on the investigation.
[03:38:54.408 --> 03:39:00.772]  He worked with agents during the 9-11 investigation and he actually claimed that
[03:39:01.332 --> 03:39:28.247]  It was, he goes along with what you're saying, it actually was an Islamic extremist attack that was carried out and that the 20th hijacker Masawi was part of organizing it but that in fact he was never intended to be a 20th hijacker because it was always supposed to be 19 because in the Quran it talks about 19 angels, 19 angels biblically or Quranically you know prophesied to bring down this Western world and that in fact
[03:39:28.647 --> 03:39:48.338]  He claimed that Moussaoui was actually going to be part of an even greater attack that would happen subsequently after, but because he was caught that didn't end up happening, but that it was actually Islamic orchestrated, but that doesn't discount the probability and the facts out there that show that the government did.
[03:39:48.358 --> 03:39:57.203]  They may have actually had knowledge of it and they may have actually allowed it to happen because they wanted it to happen for their own means and agenda.
[03:39:58.160 --> 03:40:04.124]  I would have to see evidence of that, but the fact that they wouldn't even look in his laptop is pretty damning to me.
[03:40:05.625 --> 03:40:10.788]  We could spend the next 19 hours on the forensic analysis of 9-11.
[03:40:11.049 --> 03:40:11.429]  I love it.
[03:40:11.989 --> 03:40:12.650]  Here's the thing.
[03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.630]  Here's the thing.
[03:40:14.511 --> 03:40:14.931]  For 1400 years,
[03:40:17.216 --> 03:40:19.838]  Islam has been like a brush fire.
[03:40:19.858 --> 03:40:22.820]  Have you ever seen a brush fire that just starts out where there's no wind?
[03:40:22.880 --> 03:40:24.001]  It grows like a ringworm.
[03:40:24.041 --> 03:40:25.021]  It just grows outward.
[03:40:25.602 --> 03:40:27.283]  It's dead and barren inside.
[03:40:28.103 --> 03:40:30.565]  No inventions, no patents, no books, no nothing.
[03:40:31.218 --> 03:40:40.403]  Yet it burns down and takes over stronger, smarter, richer countries time after time after time.
[03:40:40.763 --> 03:40:49.448]  And frequently, they will ally themselves with another empire against a greater third empire that's further down the road.
[03:40:50.308 --> 03:40:53.410]  The empire that's right up against Islam will get a good deal.
[03:40:54.251 --> 03:41:00.494]  They think they're, you know, being strengthened against their enemy further up the line, the Austro-Hungarians or whoever.
[03:41:01.365 --> 03:41:02.586]  But they're just being used.
[03:41:03.066 --> 03:41:06.768]  So throughout history, this is a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.
[03:41:06.828 --> 03:41:09.370]  The Islamic ringworm expands outward.
[03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:20.197]  It needs to dig into, and they even say this, it needs to dig into new healthy tissue because it's like barren scar material behind the ring.
[03:41:20.997 --> 03:41:22.218]  But as it expands out,
[03:41:23.288 --> 03:41:25.928]  Each healthy new country says, we're stronger than that.
[03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:27.529]  It's just a brush fire.
[03:41:27.929 --> 03:41:28.609]  It's nothing.
[03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.809]  It's weak.
[03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:30.549]  It's stupid.
[03:41:30.589 --> 03:41:31.369]  It's inbred.
[03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:34.210]  There's no way it can pose a threat to us.
[03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:41.151]  And for 1400 years, one nation, one people, one empire, after another, has fallen to it.
[03:41:41.551 --> 03:41:44.072]  Because it's a really perfect strategy.
[03:41:44.672 --> 03:41:51.933]  What Muhammad did, what he figured out, was almost the antithesis of Christianity in this extent.
[03:41:52.708 --> 03:41:55.110]  It appeals to man's dark angels.
[03:41:55.650 --> 03:42:01.455]  It says to men, hey, you want to rob, rape, plunder, and pillage and keep the loot?
[03:42:02.376 --> 03:42:05.198]  You can do that as long as it's to spread Islam.
[03:42:05.838 --> 03:42:06.699]  You capture women?
[03:42:07.059 --> 03:42:07.840]  They're yours.
[03:42:08.540 --> 03:42:09.741]  You want more than one wife?
[03:42:09.941 --> 03:42:10.422]  Fine.
[03:42:10.482 --> 03:42:11.683]  You'll want to beat your wife?
[03:42:11.823 --> 03:42:12.223]  Fine.
[03:42:12.243 --> 03:42:14.425]  You want to keep her locked in her house for her whole life?
[03:42:15.025 --> 03:42:15.466]  Fine.
[03:42:16.366 --> 03:42:19.849]  This appeals to the dark side of man's nature.
[03:42:20.575 --> 03:42:21.596]  It's very appealing.
[03:42:21.836 --> 03:42:22.276]  Who wouldn't?
[03:42:22.477 --> 03:42:27.600]  And if you get killed in battle, 72 virgins are waiting in paradise.
[03:42:28.241 --> 03:42:29.362]  These guys believe it.
[03:42:29.542 --> 03:42:31.263]  It's not something that they laugh about.
[03:42:31.343 --> 03:42:33.085]  You can laugh, but they believe it.
[03:42:33.465 --> 03:42:35.747]  That's why they're happy when they blow themselves up.
[03:42:36.247 --> 03:42:40.050]  That's why they'll go on a knife attack, which is almost like a suicide by cop.
[03:42:40.586 --> 03:42:44.629]  Because a knife attack is a quick road to the 72 virgins.
[03:42:45.149 --> 03:42:46.410]  They really believe it.
[03:42:46.931 --> 03:42:48.912]  And that makes it very powerful.
[03:42:49.913 --> 03:42:52.735]  It's like the Kamikazes in Japan, only maybe worse.
[03:42:53.235 --> 03:42:54.556]  Because they can't be turned off.
[03:42:55.256 --> 03:43:00.320]  There's no emperor of Islam that can say, the war's over.
[03:43:01.001 --> 03:43:01.581]  Call it off.
[03:43:02.432 --> 03:43:03.993]  It's a kamikaze book.
[03:43:04.053 --> 03:43:14.142]  The Koran is like a kamikaze manual that says, in the manual, anybody who takes one sentence out of the kamikaze manual must be killed.
[03:43:14.963 --> 03:43:16.044]  So how do you reform it?
[03:43:16.604 --> 03:43:18.946]  It's like a perfect system for conquest.
[03:43:19.386 --> 03:43:20.848]  Well, that is Matt Bracken.
[03:43:20.888 --> 03:43:25.432]  Thank you so much, Matt, for joining us in the final hour of our Defense of Free Speech special.
[03:43:25.532 --> 03:43:26.773]  Great stuff as usual, Matt.
[03:43:27.500 --> 03:43:27.720]  Thanks.
[03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:29.741]  You know, and we've got some stories here.
[03:43:29.761 --> 03:43:32.362]  I'm about to kick to a video of Alex, but, you know, I had these stories.
[03:43:32.422 --> 03:43:34.063]  I wasn't even, I didn't even plan on covering this.
[03:43:34.103 --> 03:43:35.064]  I just happened to have these stories.
[03:43:35.364 --> 03:43:49.191]  There's a father who goes to a, some parent-teacher conference and complains about how they're forcing their kids to learn Islam in school, but if they tried to teach them Jewish heritage or Christianity, that got banned from the school.
[03:43:49.451 --> 03:43:51.514]  But now they want to force him to learn Islam.
[03:43:51.874 --> 03:43:55.238]  And so this is a video, we don't have to play it, of the father really mad about that.
[03:43:55.278 --> 03:43:56.880]  They had to haul him off the stage.
[03:43:57.141 --> 03:44:06.993]  Then there's this video of an imam in Germany standing on a podium and talking about how the Islamic State and everybody is going to take over Germany and all their daughters will marry German.
[03:44:07.293 --> 03:44:08.273]  So you've got that going on.
[03:44:08.293 --> 03:44:09.234]  So all this stuff is real.
[03:44:09.274 --> 03:44:12.635]  Father in prison for genital cutting is deported in Ethiopia.
[03:44:12.655 --> 03:44:13.516]  So all this is going on.
[03:44:13.796 --> 03:44:19.218]  Oh, and by the way, the TSA is now warning about truck attacks by terrorists in the United States.
[03:44:19.258 --> 03:44:20.258]  So that's one cult.
[03:44:20.519 --> 03:44:25.941]  But now there's another cult in the United States, the liberal cult.
[03:44:26.441 --> 03:44:29.402]  And this is what a teacher said about Alex Jones.
[03:44:29.422 --> 03:44:31.083]  Are we going to Alex or are we going to go to the video?
[03:44:32.163 --> 03:44:35.665]  OK, so here's a video of a teacher threatening Alex Jones.
[03:44:37.503 --> 03:44:41.046]  You're saying someone that gets up there and speaks, you want to kill them?
[03:44:41.466 --> 03:44:41.566]  No.
[03:44:41.586 --> 03:44:42.507]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:44:42.607 --> 03:44:44.288]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:44:44.408 --> 03:44:45.769]  No, you authoritarian bastard.
[03:44:45.789 --> 03:44:46.750]  Stay right here.
[03:44:46.890 --> 03:44:52.574]  If I have nowhere to vent what I have to say, let me do it here because it doesn't matter.
[03:44:52.955 --> 03:44:54.376]  Alex Jones needs to be killed.
[03:44:54.516 --> 03:44:55.216]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:44:55.236 --> 03:44:55.637]  Yeah, I am.
[03:44:56.217 --> 03:44:58.579]  So what do you got against free speech?
[03:44:58.919 --> 03:45:00.480]  What do you got against free speech, lady?
[03:45:01.201 --> 03:45:04.043]  I want to listen to the people on the other side.
[03:45:04.083 --> 03:45:05.985]  Now, this is totally different than what you think.
[03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:07.190]  Okay?
[03:45:07.211 --> 03:45:11.254]  I want Alex Jones to be taken out for brainwashing.
[03:45:11.734 --> 03:45:12.415]  Not free speech.
[03:45:12.455 --> 03:45:14.437]  I believe in free speech.
[03:45:14.457 --> 03:45:16.338]  You know what we were just doing?
[03:45:16.479 --> 03:45:18.701]  We were speaking freely and openly.
[03:45:18.781 --> 03:45:24.646]  And right now- But you're saying you want to stop someone who has a news program that millions of people listen to?
[03:45:25.186 --> 03:45:28.289]  And you want to go ahead and eliminate his brain?
[03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:29.890]  You want to get him killed?
[03:45:30.350 --> 03:45:32.993]  You want to basically, you want to eliminate free speech?
[03:45:33.013 --> 03:45:40.038]  How do you hold, how do you say you support free speech and at the same time want to stop someone from practicing it?
[03:45:40.239 --> 03:45:45.263]  Would you please tell me how you hold those two thoughts in your head and can justify them?
[03:45:46.893 --> 03:45:48.833]  He's getting very aggressive.
[03:45:48.893 --> 03:45:54.515]  When someone does something against my first amendment, you better believe I'm going to get aggressive.
[03:45:54.555 --> 03:45:58.555]  Now you tell me, how in the hell do you justify- No, I'm good.
[03:45:58.636 --> 03:45:58.976]  I'm good.
[03:45:59.076 --> 03:45:59.956]  I'm good, Andres.
[03:46:00.076 --> 03:46:05.997]  So now, you're talking about free speech, and I'm speaking freely to you.
[03:46:06.017 --> 03:46:07.577]  Are you going to listen to my free speech?
[03:46:07.597 --> 03:46:10.418]  I want to hear you qualify what you just said.
[03:46:11.617 --> 03:46:13.298]  I want you to hear it.
[03:46:13.318 --> 03:46:20.903]  And it doesn't matter, because you're a stranger to me, and I speak to both of your boundaries.
[03:46:21.323 --> 03:46:21.483]  Okay.
[03:46:21.703 --> 03:46:25.505]  My son has been completely brainwashed by this a**hole.
[03:46:25.525 --> 03:46:26.486]  And so you want to kill him?
[03:46:27.668 --> 03:46:31.851]  Rather than listen to what the man has to say, maybe he's saying something that makes sense.
[03:46:32.292 --> 03:46:33.493]  Maybe your son is right.
[03:46:33.833 --> 03:46:35.674]  You want to kill free speech.
[03:46:36.075 --> 03:46:38.497]  You don't even give your son credit to have his own mind.
[03:46:38.937 --> 03:46:39.858]  You are that bad.
[03:46:40.218 --> 03:46:43.401]  You don't give a **** about your son or anybody else, lady.
[03:46:43.721 --> 03:46:46.443]  All you care about is some- Shut up.
[03:46:46.903 --> 03:46:47.384]  Or what?
[03:46:47.644 --> 03:46:48.445]  Or what, you mother******?
[03:46:49.225 --> 03:46:50.126]  Or what?
[03:46:50.566 --> 03:46:51.146]  Or what?
[03:46:51.446 --> 03:46:53.887]  I'm not at all affected by your upset.
[03:46:54.648 --> 03:46:58.910]  And you're not all affected by my being upset.
[03:46:58.930 --> 03:47:00.770]  I think you're the brain damaged one, lady.
[03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:03.832]  You're the one that's pissing all over the First Amendment.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:06.460]  I see.
[03:47:06.480 --> 03:47:06.841]  Let's go.
[03:47:07.201 --> 03:47:07.381]  I see.
[03:47:07.421 --> 03:47:08.521]  You better seek help!
[03:47:09.402 --> 03:47:11.162]  I see.
[03:47:11.202 --> 03:47:13.283]  I see what I do.
[03:47:13.303 --> 03:47:14.264]  See what goes on?
[03:47:14.324 --> 03:47:16.244]  What, the free speech that you want to kill?
[03:47:16.545 --> 03:47:19.866]  I suppose you're all for that Berkeley riots.
[03:47:19.906 --> 03:47:21.407]  For them stopping Ann Coulter.
[03:47:21.707 --> 03:47:23.307]  Is she bad too, should we tell her?
[03:47:23.588 --> 03:47:25.088]  How about Milo, the comedian?
[03:47:25.108 --> 03:47:27.989]  No, Andresa, why can't you give me five feet?
[03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:29.890]  And they stopped in Berkeley too.
[03:47:29.930 --> 03:47:30.771]  You want him killed?
[03:47:31.031 --> 03:47:33.732]  How many people you want killed that you don't agree with, lady?
[03:47:34.492 --> 03:47:41.275]  Tell me how much totalitarian Nazi bull**** you got in you.
[03:47:41.615 --> 03:47:42.515]  Oh, I get it perfectly.
[03:47:42.996 --> 03:47:44.936]  I get it perfectly.
[03:47:45.337 --> 03:47:48.058]  Can you stop talking the other way?
[03:47:48.098 --> 03:47:51.259]  Can you stop talking the other way?
[03:47:53.732 --> 03:47:56.194]  Oh, you could stay here all day and try to justify that.
[03:47:56.214 --> 03:48:03.040]  No, I'm not here to try to justify it to you.
[03:48:03.380 --> 03:48:11.687]  To me, I'm interested in the views of other people, and I see the people that listen to Alex Jones have a very finite view of what goes on in this world.
[03:48:11.788 --> 03:48:12.348]  How do you know?
[03:48:12.388 --> 03:48:13.749]  Do you listen to him?
[03:48:13.809 --> 03:48:15.391]  Have you listened to him?
[03:48:15.591 --> 03:48:15.911]  Absolutely.
[03:48:15.971 --> 03:48:16.331]  Really?
[03:48:16.392 --> 03:48:17.833]  So what do you find objectionable?
[03:48:17.853 --> 03:48:20.675]  Name one thing you find objectionable.
[03:48:20.735 --> 03:48:21.296]  Name it.
[03:48:23.266 --> 03:48:24.167]  How's it brainwashing?
[03:48:24.247 --> 03:48:27.849]  All he does is show other people's newscasts and he analyzes it.
[03:48:28.289 --> 03:48:30.711]  I don't know that he's 100% correct.
[03:48:30.771 --> 03:48:33.113]  How do you know he's brainwashed anybody?
[03:48:34.028 --> 03:48:37.289]  Because of the passion that comes out of the people.
[03:48:37.329 --> 03:48:41.090]  When you start screwing with the First Amendment, you better believe there's passion.
[03:48:41.210 --> 03:48:41.870]  Excuse me.
[03:48:41.890 --> 03:48:43.910]  Do you see my fingers?
[03:48:44.130 --> 03:48:46.611]  It's a different level.
[03:48:46.631 --> 03:48:47.731]  Oh, yes, you're so calm.
[03:48:47.891 --> 03:48:49.172]  Oh, you are so calm.
[03:48:49.492 --> 03:48:50.352]  It's so reasonable.
[03:48:50.592 --> 03:48:52.292]  But you're completely off base.
[03:48:52.632 --> 03:48:55.753]  I've seen people kill people without raising a heartbeat.
[03:48:55.993 --> 03:49:01.294]  And I see you talking about killing someone that wants to go ahead and practice free speech.
[03:49:01.635 --> 03:49:02.995]  You're such a calm woman.
[03:49:03.635 --> 03:49:04.055]  I don't care.
[03:49:04.075 --> 03:49:05.216]  Yes, let's kill him.
[03:49:05.416 --> 03:49:06.877]  Yes, let's kill him.
[03:49:07.017 --> 03:49:09.238]  It's almost like I'm watching an animal right now.
[03:49:09.278 --> 03:49:10.439]  It is so weird.
[03:49:10.479 --> 03:49:11.239]  No, no, no.
[03:49:11.279 --> 03:49:11.800]  No, no, no.
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:13.260]  Should I be killed too?
[03:49:14.241 --> 03:49:14.561]  No.
[03:49:14.701 --> 03:49:15.602]  You want to do that?
[03:49:16.602 --> 03:49:17.143]  Alex Jones.
[03:49:17.263 --> 03:49:20.945]  You want to try and kill me when we get this big collude to try and kill me?
[03:49:20.965 --> 03:49:22.146]  No.
[03:49:22.786 --> 03:49:24.467]  Get the hell out of my sight.
[03:49:26.767 --> 03:49:27.847]  You make me sick!
[03:49:28.368 --> 03:49:28.908]  Let's go.
[03:49:29.268 --> 03:49:29.588]  Wow.
[03:49:29.889 --> 03:49:37.593]  There was another mentally ill Trump hater who says she's for free speech but wants Alex Jones dead.
[03:49:37.773 --> 03:49:41.015]  I've witnessed these people before as we are now joined by Alex Jones.
[03:49:41.356 --> 03:49:42.576]  Alex, I've witnessed these people.
[03:49:42.997 --> 03:49:46.419]  They say they're for free speech and then they chant to have you shut up.
[03:49:46.759 --> 03:49:48.140]  It's amazing how that works, Alex.
[03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:49.520]  That's right.
[03:49:49.540 --> 03:49:51.882]  We're in the final 10 minutes before we air this.
[03:49:52.566 --> 03:49:53.807]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:49:53.827 --> 03:49:55.389]  That'll be the capping hour, I guess, hour 35.
[03:49:55.429 --> 03:50:03.396]  We're gonna do 30 hours, but folks wanted to go through the great crew, yourself, the rest of the crew, who a lot of them have been working 20 hours in the last 30-something hours.
[03:50:03.416 --> 03:50:04.617]  Want to commend the crew.
[03:50:05.117 --> 03:50:06.498]  Want to commend the viewers, everybody.
[03:50:06.598 --> 03:50:07.940]  Record listenership, viewership.
[03:50:08.740 --> 03:50:10.962]  Millions of new people tuning in in the last few days.
[03:50:11.603 --> 03:50:15.526]  And, of course, we'll be back tomorrow, myself, David, and not everybody else, with the regular show, 11 a.m.
[03:50:15.947 --> 03:50:16.687]  to 3 p.m.
[03:50:16.707 --> 03:50:18.229]  on InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:50:18.329 --> 03:50:19.570]  But Michael Dibari,
[03:50:20.490 --> 03:50:20.910]  Yes, we are.
[03:50:39.932 --> 03:50:41.673]  It reaches hundreds of thousands of people a year.
[03:50:41.713 --> 03:50:48.718]  He plays my radio show on little loudspeakers that are below the decimal level that you're allowed to have there in New Orleans.
[03:50:49.239 --> 03:50:50.259]  Most people appreciate him.
[03:50:50.420 --> 03:50:51.500]  A lot of people, though, threaten him.
[03:50:51.540 --> 03:50:52.401]  He's been attacked before.
[03:50:52.821 --> 03:50:54.562]  But he's got cameras to protect himself.
[03:50:55.063 --> 03:50:56.244]  And we're going to try to get him on the show.
[03:50:56.264 --> 03:51:00.126]  But I want him to start being a contributor now that we're about to launch a bunch of new shows here in the next few months.
[03:51:00.627 --> 03:51:03.629]  We should cut live for like 20 minutes or so when he's on the street.
[03:51:04.105 --> 03:51:07.709]  Show what he's doing with his cameras and give him an even better equipment so we'd have better audio.
[03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:15.356]  But here's this woman in this NPR voice comes over and, you know, she says that she comes over this NPR voice.
[03:51:15.416 --> 03:51:17.198]  She says, oh, I want to see him taken out.
[03:51:17.218 --> 03:51:18.019]  I want to see him dead.
[03:51:18.039 --> 03:51:19.120]  I want to see him killed.
[03:51:19.140 --> 03:51:20.541]  And then she's like, oh, you're an animal.
[03:51:20.802 --> 03:51:21.623]  You're getting upset.
[03:51:22.023 --> 03:51:25.887]  I'm hearing an NPR voice saying, let's kill people.
[03:51:26.616 --> 03:51:28.377]  But you're getting upset.
[03:51:28.437 --> 03:51:29.018]  It's a cult.
[03:51:29.578 --> 03:51:31.580]  And she's mad her son listens to the show.
[03:51:32.020 --> 03:51:33.861]  Yeah, our show isn't brainwashing, lady.
[03:51:34.142 --> 03:51:35.683]  It's showing people like you.
[03:51:35.843 --> 03:51:36.964]  I don't hate you personally.
[03:51:37.604 --> 03:51:39.546]  Admit that Stephen Colbert reads off a teleprompter.
[03:51:39.886 --> 03:51:41.527]  Admit you're brainwashed by the big corporate media.
[03:51:42.087 --> 03:51:43.468]  Admit vaccines are killing people.
[03:51:43.689 --> 03:51:45.330]  Admit we funded radical jihad groups.
[03:51:45.730 --> 03:51:47.331]  Admit that world government's out in the open.
[03:51:47.752 --> 03:51:49.513]  And that's why InfoWars is under attack.
[03:51:51.311 --> 03:51:52.612]  Washington Post today came out.
[03:51:52.752 --> 03:51:53.613]  What was the term, Buckley?
[03:51:53.673 --> 03:51:56.716]  And they said, uh, what, like, like, disturbingly popular?
[03:51:56.736 --> 03:51:57.857]  That was the term.
[03:51:57.897 --> 03:51:59.718]  Disturbingly popular, Alex Jones.
[03:52:00.058 --> 03:52:01.960]  Disturbingly popular on CNN.
[03:52:02.561 --> 03:52:03.101]  Alarming.
[03:52:03.401 --> 03:52:05.143]  You're alarmingly popular, Alex.
[03:52:05.680 --> 03:52:06.220]  That was the word.
[03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:07.641]  I was going for, remember, teleprompter-free.
[03:52:07.941 --> 03:52:08.461]  But you've got it.
[03:52:08.601 --> 03:52:12.283]  Alarmingly, excuse me, I'm saying dangerously, alarmingly popular.
[03:52:12.303 --> 03:52:14.424]  We really do have 45 million people a week on average.
[03:52:14.684 --> 03:52:15.925]  Big Weeks, 80-something million.
[03:52:16.345 --> 03:52:17.225]  Those are real people.
[03:52:17.886 --> 03:52:18.566]  All over the world.
[03:52:18.766 --> 03:52:21.127]  And I have corporate guys go, yeah, half your audience is overseas.
[03:52:21.147 --> 03:52:22.048]  You don't get any money for it.
[03:52:22.408 --> 03:52:25.309]  I don't care that we don't have people buying stuff overseas, hardly.
[03:52:25.609 --> 03:52:28.431]  It's about reaching them, defeating globalism.
[03:52:28.851 --> 03:52:29.951]  Well, Penn's probably going to win.
[03:52:29.971 --> 03:52:33.113]  If not, she'll win the next election in, you know, three and a half years.
[03:52:33.763 --> 03:52:43.445]  All this great stuff's happening, and I'm going to show you a few news articles that tie into all this, but I'm labeling this live piece, Alex Jones' final broadcast.
[03:52:43.805 --> 03:52:51.087]  Now, technically, it's the final broadcast and the 35-hour transmission, but you never know when your last broadcast is.
[03:52:51.107 --> 03:52:52.127]  You never know when your last day is.
[03:52:52.147 --> 03:52:57.869]  You never know if you're going to get hit by a car, die of cancer, a lightning bolter, a meteorite's going to hit you, or some robber kills you.
[03:52:58.209 --> 03:52:59.669]  You never know.
[03:53:00.373 --> 03:53:03.855]  How long you're going to be alive or you're going to eat some bad shellfish or whatever.
[03:53:04.236 --> 03:53:11.061]  And so I'm just telling folks, I'm just a ragtag hillbilly from Texas and we've changed the world through our crew and you as supporters.
[03:53:11.441 --> 03:53:16.905]  Think of what we can do together in the future as everything we've talked about comes out in the open now.
[03:53:17.425 --> 03:53:22.369]  You hear what's going to be in the news a year before it happens in many cases at InfoWars.com.
[03:53:22.489 --> 03:53:25.591]  Let's look at a few articles before we go in about seven minutes.
[03:53:26.091 --> 03:53:28.992]  Uh, to the nightly, uh, news that they really put together really good.
[03:53:29.012 --> 03:53:32.233]  This has all been live, but they taped the nightly news, a bunch of really powerful pieces.
[03:53:32.693 --> 03:53:36.774]  Infowars.com, video, crazed leftist wants Alex Jones killed for brainwashing people.
[03:53:37.014 --> 03:53:37.994]  Now, that's not my opinion.
[03:53:38.014 --> 03:53:38.734]  That's not fake news.
[03:53:38.974 --> 03:53:39.794]  You just saw her.
[03:53:40.595 --> 03:53:42.175]  You just saw her, Stacey.
[03:53:42.195 --> 03:53:43.295]  We actually show you.
[03:53:44.355 --> 03:53:51.117]  We don't put out, like, BuzzFeed, claiming that I secretly voted for Obama and that I wanted Hillary to win.
[03:53:51.437 --> 03:53:54.618]  I went and voted for the Republican primary, and I voted for Trump on video.
[03:53:55.512 --> 03:53:56.892]  I mean, I'm a registered Republican voter.
[03:53:57.913 --> 03:53:59.693]  But BuzzFeed says they talked to somebody.
[03:53:59.713 --> 03:54:01.314]  Yes, they took a crap and looked at the toilet.
[03:54:01.714 --> 03:54:02.214]  Talked to it.
[03:54:02.454 --> 03:54:04.435]  Mr. Hankey, you know, from South Park.
[03:54:04.695 --> 03:54:08.096]  And Mr. Hankey told him, you know, that Kuckle the Clown's real.
[03:54:08.576 --> 03:54:09.196]  So here we go.
[03:54:09.696 --> 03:54:10.457]  There's that video.
[03:54:12.017 --> 03:54:18.259]  Law and Order, SVD did a Pizzagate episode about fake news and, you know, how dangerous it is, how evil Alex Jones is.
[03:54:19.363 --> 03:54:20.825]  Meanwhile, I never created the Pizzagate story.
[03:54:20.845 --> 03:54:22.046]  That was the media's creation.
[03:54:22.467 --> 03:54:31.537]  Off of this report from WikiLeaks, the convicted pedophile, the Pedophile Island, this is even the Daily Beast, the billionaire pedophile who could bring down Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[03:54:31.977 --> 03:54:33.219]  Well, it was Bill Clinton involved.
[03:54:33.820 --> 03:54:36.883]  Going to the Sheik's houses, going to the pedophile island, convicted pedophile.
[03:54:37.283 --> 03:54:38.544]  That's how they compromise people.
[03:54:38.584 --> 03:54:39.485]  Trump just knew him.
[03:54:39.505 --> 03:54:44.589]  There's been like one party that was a public party with him, but that's how they try to compromise you right here.
[03:54:44.929 --> 03:54:46.170]  Oh, so Pizzagate isn't real.
[03:54:46.590 --> 03:54:50.514]  That's what we were talking about in the emails and Weiner with the pedophilia that came out in the news.
[03:54:51.074 --> 03:54:52.215]  Okay, we told you that first.
[03:54:52.275 --> 03:54:52.495]  Boom!
[03:54:53.076 --> 03:54:54.797]  Ex-Alex Jones staffer thinks he voted.
[03:54:54.957 --> 03:54:55.317]  Thinks!
[03:54:56.278 --> 03:54:58.520]  He thinks I voted for Chinese jet pilots from Pluto.
[03:54:58.840 --> 03:54:59.541]  Thinks he voted.
[03:55:00.661 --> 03:55:02.343]  For Obama to keep ratings going.
[03:55:03.063 --> 03:55:05.165]  Our ratings have been bigger than ever with Trump.
[03:55:05.545 --> 03:55:06.766]  Like, three, four times.
[03:55:07.327 --> 03:55:08.588]  And since he got in, they got bigger.
[03:55:09.388 --> 03:55:14.772]  I've made the point on air that, who knows, we might have more listeners than Hillary had gotten in, but there'd be nuclear war.
[03:55:15.873 --> 03:55:21.518]  I mean, there's these lies that we're actors and we're fake as we change the world, when they're the fakes.
[03:55:22.999 --> 03:55:26.302]  Any conspiracy theorists rejoining forces, that could be good or bad for Trump.
[03:55:26.622 --> 03:55:27.903]  They're going to stay in the Washington Post.
[03:55:28.582 --> 03:55:29.162]  Everybody.
[03:55:29.242 --> 03:55:30.543]  Infowars is hiring.
[03:55:30.843 --> 03:55:31.984]  Thanks for your support, folks.
[03:55:32.024 --> 03:55:32.704]  See us grow.
[03:55:33.124 --> 03:55:34.725]  See us take on the globalists.
[03:55:34.745 --> 03:55:35.706]  You got front row seats.
[03:55:35.726 --> 03:55:36.546]  You're in the arena.
[03:55:38.127 --> 03:55:40.468]  It goes on and on and on.
[03:55:40.568 --> 03:55:42.489]  So here's what I'm getting at, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:43.550 --> 03:55:46.191]  We're changing the world because you're changing the world.
[03:55:46.789 --> 03:55:48.991]  The attacks on InfoWars are attacks on you.
[03:55:49.292 --> 03:55:51.134]  The globalists don't want you to have a focal point.
[03:55:51.514 --> 03:55:53.216]  They don't want you to have a place to make change.
[03:55:53.476 --> 03:55:58.442]  They don't want you to have a place where you can send in videos like this fella did and the lady saying she wants me dead.
[03:55:59.983 --> 03:56:02.026]  How can they compete with stuff raw like that?
[03:56:02.446 --> 03:56:03.287]  How can they compete?
[03:56:04.281 --> 03:56:04.441]  I don't
[03:56:22.857 --> 03:56:24.358]  With whistleblowers giving us intel.
[03:56:24.658 --> 03:56:27.539]  They want to shut us down because they can't handle it.
[03:56:27.719 --> 03:56:29.580]  And they don't want us speaking out about what they're doing.
[03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:31.120]  So they want to intimidate us.
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:32.661]  So the battle is now.
[03:56:32.681 --> 03:56:33.761]  And if people support us.
[03:56:34.161 --> 03:56:35.862]  If they spread the articles and spread the links.
[03:56:36.162 --> 03:56:38.063]  And get around Facebook and Twitter censorship.
[03:56:38.323 --> 03:56:39.343]  And do it via email.
[03:56:39.383 --> 03:56:40.344]  And do it via person.
[03:56:40.724 --> 03:56:41.784]  And promote our local stations.
[03:56:41.884 --> 03:56:42.685]  And start your own show.
[03:56:42.965 --> 03:56:43.685]  Call into C-SPAN.
[03:56:44.971 --> 03:56:46.572]  Uh, you know, do your own podcast, whatever.
[03:56:46.752 --> 03:56:48.293]  All of it together will bring them down.
[03:56:48.653 --> 03:56:52.294]  None of us are perfect, but they want to try to destroy me to intimidate you.
[03:56:52.514 --> 03:56:53.515]  They're not destroying us.
[03:56:53.835 --> 03:56:58.357]  We're only getting bigger and stronger under this attack because a bunch of discredited scum are attacking us.
[03:56:58.557 --> 03:56:59.077]  Here's the key point.
[03:56:59.097 --> 03:57:03.979]  I'm gonna throw it back to you guys for a few minutes before you go to the, uh, nightly news to cap off 35 hours.
[03:57:04.279 --> 03:57:05.000]  Turned into 35, it was 30.
[03:57:06.772 --> 03:57:13.898]  The mercenaries at the Daily Beast, and all their places, and Time Magazine, and Newsweek, New York Times, many of them tell me off-record, we know we're mercenaries.
[03:57:14.099 --> 03:57:15.119]  We know it's all corrupt.
[03:57:15.139 --> 03:57:16.541]  We know you're not right-wing or left-wing.
[03:57:16.741 --> 03:57:17.422]  We know you're right.
[03:57:17.942 --> 03:57:22.246]  We're enamored with InfoWars, and your crew, and Paul Joseph Watson, and all the rest of your people.
[03:57:23.405 --> 03:57:24.325]  We wish we were real.
[03:57:24.566 --> 03:57:25.566]  You're the real journalist.
[03:57:25.886 --> 03:57:29.108]  We wish we could say what we wanted, do what we wanted, and cover what we want.
[03:57:29.268 --> 03:57:30.628]  We're just hired hacks.
[03:57:31.069 --> 03:57:32.870]  So they're not just attacking us to demonize us.
[03:57:32.890 --> 03:57:40.453]  They've been ordered to do so by a bunch of nine-year-old men, you know, who are totally out of their minds, like Prince Philip and the late David Rockefeller.
[03:57:41.434 --> 03:57:48.237]  But they literally have to sit at us and throw their lies at us because they have to sit there and watch us live while they sleep.
[03:57:49.059 --> 03:57:54.642]  They have to sit there and watch themselves lose, and watch themselves pump more lies for old that don't work anymore.
[03:57:55.162 --> 03:57:56.843]  And they see us trying to tell the truth.
[03:57:57.303 --> 03:58:05.807]  And they see us with giant, swelling audiences, being real journalists, real old-fashioned, Mickey Spillane, gumshoes, and, and, and...
[03:58:06.511 --> 03:58:11.052]  You know, shoe-leather reporters, and they can't stand the fact that we're free.
[03:58:11.312 --> 03:58:13.593]  And that's why nobody could compete with the American system.
[03:58:13.753 --> 03:58:22.955]  It wasn't perfect, but it's where everybody wanted to come, the flower of the Renaissance, because you had a chance to actually build something a lot better than Europe or other feudalist monopoly systems.
[03:58:23.235 --> 03:58:31.637]  And we're the return of Americana, the return of freedom, of all peoples coming together, and the great college of ideas and free will and open society.
[03:58:32.177 --> 03:58:44.628]  And they can't stand it so they lie about us and they demonize us and they pretend to be reporters and they send people here to make up ridiculous stories that are 90% total fiction because they're desperate and they need you to buy into their fiction.
[03:58:44.828 --> 03:58:47.310]  And they say that I'm a fiction when I'm not a fiction.
[03:58:47.470 --> 03:58:53.355]  We cover the real world, the real things that are happening, the real things that come true because we've got our finger on the pulse.
[03:58:53.515 --> 03:58:56.338]  We're real intellectuals and they can't stand it.
[03:58:56.778 --> 03:59:00.342]  Back to the incredible crew, miles away in the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:59:00.582 --> 03:59:01.183]  Spread the link.
[03:59:01.203 --> 03:59:01.924]  Spread the articles.
[03:59:01.984 --> 03:59:04.527]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:59:04.627 --> 03:59:05.327]  Buy the products.
[03:59:05.368 --> 03:59:05.768]  They're great.
[03:59:05.788 --> 03:59:06.449]  You need them anyway.
[03:59:07.310 --> 03:59:09.713]  Infowarsstore.com, be part of the revolution.
[03:59:10.093 --> 03:59:12.776]  Funding us, taking action, is what it's all about.
[03:59:12.796 --> 03:59:16.360]  The Islamists have spent 30, 40, 50% on propaganda.
[03:59:16.780 --> 03:59:18.362]  Each person does, for Islam.
[03:59:18.542 --> 03:59:21.485]  If you promote freedom, we would defeat these people.
[03:59:21.525 --> 03:59:22.746]  The globalists and all of them.
[03:59:22.947 --> 03:59:23.968]  The George Soros's.
[03:59:24.188 --> 03:59:28.212]  Women putting on hijabs for feminism and sexually mutilating their daughters.
[03:59:28.432 --> 03:59:29.874]  It's a load of horse manure.
[03:59:30.566 --> 03:59:31.246]  I love our crew.
[03:59:31.326 --> 03:59:31.967]  I love our listeners.
[03:59:32.007 --> 03:59:32.727]  I love our supporters.
[03:59:32.767 --> 03:59:34.088]  We're all brothers and sisters together.
[03:59:34.268 --> 03:59:35.109]  We're all humans.
[03:59:35.509 --> 03:59:37.610]  We all bleed red blood, and I love you all.
[03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:44.994]  Back to the crew, and then InfoWars Nightly News kicks off to end the 35-hour transmission, and then we'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[03:59:45.054 --> 03:59:45.374]  Central.
[03:59:45.414 --> 03:59:46.895]  But don't take free speech for granted.
[03:59:47.175 --> 03:59:48.016]  It's under attack.
[03:59:48.176 --> 03:59:49.857]  When they attack us, they're attacking you.
[03:59:50.097 --> 03:59:53.719]  So never forget, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:59:54.301 --> 03:59:57.304]  That is the leader of InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[03:59:57.504 --> 03:59:59.206]  Kit Daniel, thank you for joining us.
[03:59:59.306 --> 04:00:00.868]  Millie Weaver, thank you for joining us.
[04:00:00.968 --> 04:00:05.833]  We close the 30-hour broadcast special right here, right now.
[04:00:05.893 --> 04:00:07.295]  We kick it to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:00:07.535 --> 04:00:10.318]  Don't forget, Alex Jones will be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[04:00:10.358 --> 04:00:10.699]  Central.
[04:00:10.739 --> 04:00:13.201]  Thank you guys so much for supporting us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[04:00:13.381 --> 04:00:13.662]  Thank you.
[04:00:14.736 --> 04:00:20.038]  ...our broadcast, but because of your support, we are going to take InfoWars to the next level.
[04:00:20.078 --> 04:00:27.201]  We're going to expand our staff, and we're going to flex our muscles in the face of the globalists even more, because that's what you want.
[04:00:27.261 --> 04:00:43.247]  But please, sit back, enjoy the highlights from what was the 30-hour broadcast special, The Defense of Free Speech, and make sure you get out there and execute your right to free speech, because that is how we defend our rights, by executing them in the face of the tyrants.
[04:00:56.003 --> 04:01:01.345]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[04:01:01.505 --> 04:01:02.085]  I take this.
[04:01:02.345 --> 04:01:03.366]  My family takes this.
[04:01:03.466 --> 04:01:07.747]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[04:01:07.767 --> 04:01:12.209]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[04:01:12.349 --> 04:01:16.910]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[04:01:16.990 --> 04:01:18.050]  I don't feel good.
[04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:21.631]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[04:01:21.871 --> 04:01:24.512]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[04:01:24.572 --> 04:01:29.874]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[04:01:30.354 --> 04:01:33.254]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[04:01:33.314 --> 04:01:36.735]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[04:01:36.855 --> 04:01:39.056]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[04:01:39.096 --> 04:01:39.456]  I love it.
[04:01:39.616 --> 04:01:42.217]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[04:01:42.417 --> 04:01:43.398]  Survival Shield X2.
[04:01:43.438 --> 04:01:49.060]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[04:01:49.080 --> 04:01:50.961]  It's got a five-star rating.
[04:01:51.201 --> 04:01:51.961]  It's a win-win.
[04:01:52.421 --> 04:01:53.222]  Infowarslife.com.
[04:02:39.053 --> 04:02:44.654]  I wasn't going to talk about this, because I get attacked a good 50 times a day in print, you know, every day on national news.
[04:02:44.834 --> 04:02:51.216]  But they had this Charlie Worzel guy, or Weasel guy, follow me around the last few months, one of many.
[04:02:52.036 --> 04:02:54.376]  And his article's called, Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones.
[04:02:54.416 --> 04:02:56.677]  I just scanned over this in the last 10 minutes since it came out.
[04:02:57.057 --> 04:03:00.237]  It is literal, literal fiction.
[04:03:00.257 --> 04:03:01.298]  He sent me all these questions.
[04:03:01.338 --> 04:03:07.659]  I refused to answer them today, final questions, because it was all just so much of it just didn't even have anything to do with reality.
[04:03:08.479 --> 04:03:09.200]  And look at this.
[04:03:09.300 --> 04:03:10.482]  I just opened it to page 6.
[04:03:11.763 --> 04:03:15.267]  He just kept saying, oh my God, if Obama loses, we're out of business.
[04:03:17.390 --> 04:03:18.271]  Talking about 2012.
[04:03:18.491 --> 04:03:23.337]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're supposed to go talk to former employees.
[04:03:23.637 --> 04:03:27.342]  This is the biggest load of crap the world has ever seen.
[04:03:30.752 --> 04:03:36.177]  He goes on to say, but others close to Jones during that time said that despite a growing audience, the broadcaster was insecure.
[04:03:36.317 --> 04:03:37.058]  Insecure?
[04:03:37.659 --> 04:03:42.143]  Two former colleagues said Jones reserved his greater resentment for Rush Limbaugh.
[04:03:43.615 --> 04:03:51.458]  The jealousy was so intense that Jones began to crib his now famous Crushed Gravel voice from the talk radio legend.
[04:03:51.758 --> 04:03:52.198]  Crib it!
[04:03:52.738 --> 04:03:53.759]  Limbaugh doesn't have a voice like me.
[04:03:53.779 --> 04:03:55.319]  He has a big, booming, sweet voice.
[04:03:55.539 --> 04:03:55.939]  Mine's fine.
[04:03:56.239 --> 04:04:04.522]  Ladies and gentlemen, I spent a quarter million dollars on Rush Limbaugh advertising books and videos and supplements trying to prop him up when they're trying to bring him down.
[04:04:04.963 --> 04:04:07.744]  GCN put me on 18, 19 years ago.
[04:04:07.844 --> 04:04:09.464]  I wanted to be on at night like I was.
[04:04:09.504 --> 04:04:10.865]  They took me off, put me on during the day.
[04:04:11.265 --> 04:04:11.745]  I hated it.
[04:04:12.955 --> 04:04:17.920]  I have, I am not in comp, everyone knows I'm not in competition with anybody except the globalists to stop them.
[04:04:18.120 --> 04:04:24.566]  And I just open this up and they just have anonymous people what, you know, I'm raping, you know, warthogs now.
[04:04:24.926 --> 04:04:25.987]  I mean, I just flipped through it.
[04:04:26.047 --> 04:04:27.269]  It's total crap.
[04:04:28.450 --> 04:04:28.730]  Excuse me.
[04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:31.573]  And I won't talk about myself all day, but God, it's getting crazy.
[04:04:32.273 --> 04:04:35.857]  You know, the nighttime shows, the comedy shows, everything.
[04:04:37.273 --> 04:04:39.935]  Made-for-TV movies, everything just attacking.
[04:04:40.135 --> 04:04:44.218]  Only X-Files said that they think I'm a good guy and had a good character in the show, they said based on me.
[04:04:44.238 --> 04:04:46.939]  And I don't want to make it about me, but they are obsessed.
[04:04:51.382 --> 04:04:56.646]  Somebody should be prosecuted for letting Anthony Weiner have access to classified information.
[04:04:56.686 --> 04:04:58.147]  Does that make general sense?
[04:04:58.987 --> 04:04:59.848]  It could be a crime.
[04:04:59.868 --> 04:05:00.788]  It would depend upon what the...
[04:05:05.692 --> 04:05:11.959]  And here's another hypocrite, Comey, nauseous to think FBI impacted presidential election.
[04:05:12.159 --> 04:05:14.001]  Oh, he feels so nauseous about it.
[04:05:14.262 --> 04:05:21.770]  And we got some clips about him complaining and whining to Maxine Waters and Lindsey Graham and all these other turds that are out there trying to run your life.
[04:05:22.671 --> 04:05:24.973]  But again, it's like, it all goes back to Hillary.
[04:05:25.013 --> 04:05:26.635]  Well, the headline's not even real.
[04:05:26.695 --> 04:05:27.756]  This is a fake headline.
[04:05:27.776 --> 04:05:33.001]  The headline should be, Huma frickin' Abedin gave 6,000 classified emails to her perverted husband.
[04:05:33.181 --> 04:05:33.401]  Right.
[04:05:33.421 --> 04:05:34.342]  That should be the headline.
[04:05:34.642 --> 04:05:38.946]  And it's not because, oh, we want to turn it and make it about how he feels bad.
[04:05:38.966 --> 04:05:41.449]  It's all about his feelings, not about what he did.
[04:05:41.849 --> 04:05:42.269]  Yeah.
[04:05:58.457 --> 04:06:05.784]  Former political campaign aides go in and find out who was the rat, who was against her when she lost the first election in 2008.
[04:06:07.485 --> 04:06:12.489]  That was when she first learned, oh wow, as long as I can control this server, I can go in and see everything.
[04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:16.813]  So then she wanted to set up her own private server so that no one could do that to her.
[04:06:17.754 --> 04:06:24.023]  And so she knew exactly what she, she wasn't some innocent little grandma that thought it would be easier to set up her own private server.
[04:06:24.444 --> 04:06:25.585]  That's what it all goes back to.
[04:06:25.625 --> 04:06:34.418]  So when she comes out being totally pathetic, blaming it, I was on my way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter and the Russian Wikileaks.
[04:06:34.718 --> 04:06:35.018]  Thank you.
[04:06:35.038 --> 04:06:36.119]  They caught us cheating.
[04:06:51.625 --> 04:06:54.168]  You wouldn't have had to be investigated by the FBI.
[04:06:54.909 --> 04:06:57.532]  We would have won if they hadn't caught us cheating.
[04:06:57.693 --> 04:06:59.275]  That's literally what she's saying.
[04:06:59.415 --> 04:07:03.100]  Hillary Clinton, we would have won if they hadn't caught us cheating.
[04:07:03.240 --> 04:07:07.425]  I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids.
[04:07:09.158 --> 04:07:10.319]  All right, let's go to this clip.
[04:07:10.339 --> 04:07:16.306]  This is Lindsey Graham talking about Wiener not having appropriate clearance to get these class 6,000 classified emails.
[04:07:16.326 --> 04:07:17.688]  But, you know, their intentions were okay.
[04:07:17.708 --> 04:07:21.212]  So, hey, can I get classified email now if their intentions are good?
[04:07:21.252 --> 04:07:22.093]  Yeah, my intentions are good.
[04:07:22.293 --> 04:07:24.616]  You know how retarded you sound, James Comey?
[04:07:25.377 --> 04:07:25.657]  Ridiculous.
[04:07:25.677 --> 04:07:27.239]  We can't even get a friggin' FOIA request.
[04:07:31.673 --> 04:07:35.875]  Anthony Weiner of 2016 should not have access to classified information.
[04:07:38.697 --> 04:07:39.437]  Yes, that's the first.
[04:07:39.477 --> 04:07:41.598]  Would you agree with me that that's not illegal?
[04:07:41.698 --> 04:07:43.039]  We've got really bad laws.
[04:07:45.380 --> 04:07:48.121]  Well, if he hadn't... Well, he got it somehow.
[04:07:48.141 --> 04:07:50.382]  It would be illegal if he didn't have appropriate clearance.
[04:07:50.563 --> 04:07:53.204]  Well, do you agree with me he didn't have appropriate clearance?
[04:07:54.284 --> 04:07:56.886]  If he did have appropriate clearance, that'd even be worse.
[04:07:57.802 --> 04:08:02.344]  I don't believe at the time we found that on his laptop that he had any kind of... Yeah, I agree.
[04:08:02.404 --> 04:08:05.005]  So, for him to get it should be a crime.
[04:08:05.945 --> 04:08:11.187]  Somebody should be prosecuted for letting Anthony Weiner have access to classified information.
[04:08:11.227 --> 04:08:12.648]  Does that make general sense?
[04:08:13.528 --> 04:08:14.408]  It could be a crime.
[04:08:14.428 --> 04:08:17.429]  It would depend upon what the people... Do you agree with me that it should be?
[04:08:17.449 --> 04:08:20.350]  That anybody that will ask Anthony Weiner has classified information probably should be prosecuted.
[04:08:20.410 --> 04:08:22.270]  I mean, I thought it was bad enough that I had to alert everyone.
[04:08:22.310 --> 04:08:24.550]  If our laws don't cover that, they probably should.
[04:08:24.570 --> 04:08:28.411]  There's no Anthony Weiner statue, but it is... Oh, no Anthony Weiner statue.
[04:08:28.431 --> 04:08:29.551]  We'll take his joke.
[04:08:29.652 --> 04:08:30.912]  All right, good.
[04:08:30.952 --> 04:08:32.792]  That's how you deflect with the humor.
[04:08:32.832 --> 04:08:35.873]  I can't get classified information and it not be a crime by somebody.
[04:08:36.853 --> 04:08:37.153]  Wow.
[04:08:37.413 --> 04:08:41.315]  Well, hey, she needed him to print it out for her, okay?
[04:08:41.335 --> 04:08:43.255]  So that, you know, it was innocent there.
[04:08:43.355 --> 04:08:48.097]  So if someone wants to forward me their classified docs, I will print them out for you.
[04:08:48.637 --> 04:08:49.197]  So that's fine.
[04:08:49.457 --> 04:08:50.678]  I think... Colby said that's not illegal.
[04:08:50.858 --> 04:08:55.699]  I think there's a guy got one classified report sent to him, and he was in the Army.
[04:08:56.359 --> 04:08:58.700]  And he got, they took his pension away, they took everything away.
[04:08:59.140 --> 04:09:00.401]  And there was no talk of
[04:09:01.261 --> 04:09:06.767]  Of what you're going to do with it, your intention was with these emails.
[04:09:07.127 --> 04:09:07.908]  Let's go to the next clip.
[04:09:07.988 --> 04:09:09.630]  This is how he got the emails.
[04:09:10.491 --> 04:09:11.933]  Clinton didn't give them to him.
[04:09:11.953 --> 04:09:13.014]  Her intentions are pure.
[04:09:14.355 --> 04:09:18.740]  Was there classified information on former Congressman Weiner's computer?
[04:09:18.980 --> 04:09:19.200]  Yes.
[04:09:20.402 --> 04:09:21.302]  Who sent it to him?
[04:09:22.962 --> 04:09:34.270]  His then spouse, Huma Abedin, appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him, for him, I think, to print out for her, so she could then deliver them to the Secretary of State.
[04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:38.533]  Did former Congressman Weiner read the classified material?
[04:09:42.816 --> 04:09:43.637]  I don't think so.
[04:09:44.137 --> 04:09:50.478]  I don't think we've been able to interview him because he has pending criminal problems of other sorts.
[04:09:50.978 --> 04:09:54.819]  But my understanding is that his role would be to print them out as a matter of convenience.
[04:09:55.179 --> 04:09:57.440]  If he didn't read them, would he have committed a crime?
[04:09:58.940 --> 04:09:59.560]  Potentially.
[04:10:00.941 --> 04:10:02.701]  Would his spouse have committed a crime?
[04:10:03.821 --> 04:10:04.722]  Again, potentially.
[04:10:04.742 --> 04:10:06.142]  It would depend upon a number of things.
[04:10:06.702 --> 04:10:09.523]  Is there an investigation with respect to the two of them?
[04:10:10.599 --> 04:10:12.802]  There was, it is, we completed it.
[04:10:13.724 --> 04:10:16.027]  Why did you conclude neither of them committed a crime?
[04:10:17.088 --> 04:10:18.831]  Because with respect to Ms.
[04:10:18.911 --> 04:10:25.239]  Abbott in particular, we didn't have any indication that she had a sense that what she was doing was in violation of the law.
[04:10:27.136 --> 04:10:28.497]  She didn't have much sense about it.
[04:10:28.657 --> 04:10:35.443]  But we need to make them the leaders, put them in the most powerful positions, and then they can just keep on.
[04:10:35.503 --> 04:10:36.364]  Why is it always like this?
[04:10:36.624 --> 04:10:40.447]  These elite people get to break the law, do whatever they want, and oh, they didn't know.
[04:10:40.527 --> 04:10:41.648]  Nobody knows anything.
[04:10:42.168 --> 04:10:46.232]  But you know, if I do something, they say ignorance is not a defense.
[04:10:46.452 --> 04:10:47.333]  Ignorance is not a defense.
[04:10:48.173 --> 04:10:50.134]  That's what you hear judges say whenever you go into a courtroom.
[04:10:50.154 --> 04:10:52.195]  You say, well, I didn't know the speed limit was 35 miles an hour.
[04:10:52.215 --> 04:10:54.475]  And they go, ignorance isn't an excuse, sir.
[04:10:54.496 --> 04:10:55.856]  You're going to have to pay a fine.
[04:10:56.296 --> 04:11:02.178]  But that's because I'm a lowly citizen, and she's whom she probably has her genitals cut off.
[04:11:02.218 --> 04:11:03.339]  Her mom was for that.
[04:11:03.379 --> 04:11:06.000]  So she probably got her little things hacked away as well.
[04:11:06.820 --> 04:11:09.021]  And I'm sure the feminists are going to love that one.
[04:11:11.883 --> 04:11:17.490]  It's really disgusting when you hear it described, what they do to these poor little ladies in the Sudan as they come of age.
[04:11:18.010 --> 04:11:20.553]  But, you know, they're Muslims, so we have to let them do whatever they want.
[04:11:20.593 --> 04:11:21.714]  No, they don't even come of age.
[04:11:21.755 --> 04:11:27.001]  These are like young girls, three to seven years old, that this is happening to.
[04:11:27.819 --> 04:11:32.543]  And so people want to make the argument about, well, what about circumcision with little boys and stuff?
[04:11:32.563 --> 04:11:36.226]  But it's, which, you know, there's a little bit of bit to that argument as well.
[04:11:36.326 --> 04:11:42.470]  But this is like mutilating these genitals, cutting it off and then sewing it up.
[04:11:42.530 --> 04:11:46.213]  Sometimes they sew it up so tight, they get infections, they can't urinate.
[04:11:46.293 --> 04:11:50.397]  Like this is, it's not like a circumcision of a little boy.
[04:11:50.537 --> 04:11:51.517]  It's completely different.
[04:11:51.597 --> 04:11:51.858]  And it's,
[04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:53.371]  Barbaric.
[04:11:53.631 --> 04:11:56.273]  And hey, we can argue the fact, I don't think we gave out the number yet.
[04:11:56.294 --> 04:11:58.776]  We're about 426, so we're going to end this about 5.
[04:11:58.856 --> 04:12:00.878]  We're going to take 6 calls.
[04:12:00.898 --> 04:12:02.620]  512-646-4426.
[04:12:02.640 --> 04:12:04.522]  512-646-4426.
[04:12:06.384 --> 04:12:09.867]  We'll take a few calls here coming up as we finish out with these clips.
[04:12:10.287 --> 04:12:12.069]  Now here's where we get the big kahuna.
[04:12:12.089 --> 04:12:12.510]  This is the
[04:12:12.910 --> 04:12:16.232]  This is him talking about he's nauseous and oh, he feels so bad.
[04:12:16.912 --> 04:12:17.933]  This is kind of a long clip.
[04:12:18.473 --> 04:12:19.594]  Maybe we'll pop out of it.
[04:12:20.034 --> 04:12:27.098]  And then we got one which I thought was his coup d'etat of basically saying we need an army of trolls.
[04:12:27.639 --> 04:12:30.020]  That's a good army of trolls, but we'll get to that in a second.
[04:12:30.660 --> 04:12:34.222]  This is Comey talking about, I think he's talking with Dianne Feinstein.
[04:12:34.703 --> 04:12:36.924]  And I think she interrupts him and he interrupts her.
[04:12:36.964 --> 04:12:38.965]  It's kind of funny watching them go back and forth.
[04:12:39.505 --> 04:12:41.527]  Clip of Comey talking about the 6,000 emails.
[04:12:41.547 --> 04:12:41.987]  Let's roll it.
[04:12:42.779 --> 04:12:49.153]  Why didn't you just do the investigation as you would normally, with no public announcement?
[04:12:50.314 --> 04:12:51.175]  Great question, Senator.
[04:12:51.195 --> 04:12:51.535]  Thank you.
[04:12:52.635 --> 04:13:00.660]  October 27th, the investigative team that had finished the investigation in July, focused on Secretary Clinton's emails, asked to meet with me.
[04:13:01.320 --> 04:13:12.546]  So I met with them that morning, late morning in my conference room, and they laid out for me what they could see from the metadata on this fella Anthony Weiner's laptop that had been seized in an unrelated case.
[04:13:13.306 --> 04:13:26.210]  What they could see from the metadata was that there were thousands of Secretary Clinton's emails on that device, including what they thought might be the missing emails from her first three months as Secretary of State.
[04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:29.110]  We never found any emails from her first three months.
[04:13:29.591 --> 04:13:37.713]  She was using a Verizon BlackBerry then, and that's obviously very important, because if there was evidence that she was acting with bad intent, that's where it would be in the first three months.
[04:13:37.733 --> 04:13:38.373]  But they weren't there.
[04:13:38.613 --> 04:13:39.934]  Look, can I just finish my answer, Senator?
[04:13:39.954 --> 04:13:40.034]  Yeah.
[04:13:40.614 --> 04:13:50.520]  And so they came in and said, we can see thousands of emails from the Clinton email domain, including many, many, many from the Verizon Clinton domain, BlackBerry domain.
[04:13:50.980 --> 04:13:53.261]  They said, we think we got to get a search warrant to go get this.
[04:13:53.582 --> 04:13:55.123]  And the Department of Justice agreed.
[04:13:55.143 --> 04:13:56.383]  We had a notice of BlackBerry.
[04:13:56.543 --> 04:13:58.645]  She said, again, she just had the one...
[04:13:59.565 --> 04:14:00.685]  And then I faced a choice.
[04:14:00.925 --> 04:14:08.407]  And I lived my entire career by the tradition that if you can possibly avoid it, you avoid any action in the run-up to an election that might have an impact.
[04:14:08.707 --> 04:14:11.288]  Whether it's a dog catcher election or President of the United States.
[04:14:11.788 --> 04:14:15.929]  But I sat there that morning and I could not see a door labeled no action here.
[04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:19.270]  I could see two doors and they were both actions.
[04:14:19.570 --> 04:14:22.151]  One was labeled speak, the other was labeled conceal.
[04:14:22.171 --> 04:14:23.891]  Because here's how I thought about it.
[04:14:23.911 --> 04:14:26.312]  I'm not trying to talk you into this, but I want you to know my thinking.
[04:14:27.072 --> 04:14:32.954]  Having repeatedly told this Congress, we are done and there's nothing there, there's no case there, there's no case there.
[04:14:33.595 --> 04:14:44.699]  To restart in a hugely significant way, potentially finding the emails that would reflect on her intent from the beginning, and not speak about it would require an act of concealment, in my view.
[04:14:44.719 --> 04:14:47.040]  And so I stared at speak and conceal.
[04:14:47.180 --> 04:14:48.760]  Speak would be really bad.
[04:14:48.780 --> 04:14:50.661]  There's an election in 11 days.
[04:14:50.961 --> 04:14:52.322]  Lordy, that would be really bad.
[04:14:52.782 --> 04:14:55.103]  Concealing, in my view, would be catastrophic.
[04:14:56.023 --> 04:14:57.504]  He's got such a wimp.
[04:14:57.544 --> 04:15:00.946]  He had 6,000 emails and he left his people walking about free.
[04:15:00.966 --> 04:15:03.728]  He should have put her in jail.
[04:15:03.988 --> 04:15:09.832]  He should have put her in jail and then people wouldn't have been like, well, why'd you do it if there was nothing there?
[04:15:09.852 --> 04:15:12.493]  There was something there, but you let her get off free.
[04:15:12.513 --> 04:15:13.194]  Oh, they're working so hard.
[04:15:18.817 --> 04:15:22.321]  Of new emails they found classified information on Anthony Weiner.
[04:15:23.021 --> 04:15:26.405]  Somehow her emails are being forwarded to Anthony Weiner.
[04:15:26.845 --> 04:15:28.367]  Somehow we don't know.
[04:15:28.487 --> 04:15:31.950]  We're such good investigators we can't figure that out.
[04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:33.271]  He just needed him to print it.
[04:15:33.312 --> 04:15:35.494]  On his mom's classified printer.
[04:15:35.534 --> 04:15:39.718]  Thanks to the wizardry of our technology we've only had to personally read 6,000
[04:15:40.979 --> 04:15:42.881]  Didn't her cleaning lady print emails?
[04:15:42.921 --> 04:15:44.642]  That's what you're referring to.
[04:15:45.183 --> 04:15:46.984]  We found a lot of new stuff.
[04:15:47.505 --> 04:15:51.568]  We did not find anything that changes our view of her intent.
[04:15:52.169 --> 04:15:54.151]  So we're in the same place we were in July.
[04:15:54.171 --> 04:16:00.857]  It hasn't changed our view, and I asked them lots of questions, and I said, okay, if that's where you are, then I also have to tell Congress that we're done.
[04:16:01.557 --> 04:16:02.638]  Look, this is terrible.
[04:16:02.858 --> 04:16:06.560]  It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election.
[04:16:06.660 --> 04:16:12.264]  Yeah, not the fact that you found 6,000 classified emails and that she didn't turn everything over to the FBI.
[04:16:12.284 --> 04:16:13.525]  That didn't make you nauseous.
[04:16:13.665 --> 04:16:15.746]  And stare at this, and tell me what you would do.
[04:16:16.186 --> 04:16:16.927]  Would you speak?
[04:16:17.247 --> 04:16:18.088]  I would seal.
[04:16:18.508 --> 04:16:19.208]  Lock her up.
[04:16:19.248 --> 04:16:20.429]  Lock her up.
[04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:21.950]  Lock her up.
[04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:24.071]  Seriously, that's what we would do.
[04:16:24.131 --> 04:16:26.093]  I know what more than half the country wants.
[04:16:26.613 --> 04:16:27.914]  I would make the same decision.
[04:16:28.274 --> 04:16:31.735]  Yeah, except for that maybe you... On October 28th from the Congress.
[04:16:31.755 --> 04:16:33.655]  Wouldn't the letter get off the street?
[04:16:33.675 --> 04:16:34.696]  By the way, people forget this.
[04:16:34.736 --> 04:16:35.896]  I didn't make a public announcement.
[04:16:36.336 --> 04:16:40.057]  I sent a private letter to the chairs and the rankings of the oversight committees.
[04:16:40.417 --> 04:16:42.857]  I know it's a distinction without a difference in the world of things.
[04:16:43.058 --> 04:16:47.899]  Did you really think they weren't going to leak it to the press?
[04:16:48.079 --> 04:16:48.879]  You know how this goes.
[04:16:48.959 --> 04:16:50.719]  It was the reason I made that choice.
[04:16:51.439 --> 04:16:52.600]  And it was a hard choice.
[04:16:52.760 --> 04:16:54.680]  I still believe, in retrospect, the right choice.
[04:16:54.780 --> 04:16:56.001]  As painful as this has been.
[04:16:56.021 --> 04:16:57.721]  And I'm sorry for the long answer.
[04:16:58.121 --> 04:16:59.422]  Yeah, we're not sorry.
[04:16:59.542 --> 04:17:00.182]  I'm so sorry.
[04:17:00.302 --> 04:17:01.523]  It makes me nauseous.
[04:17:03.344 --> 04:17:06.006]  No, it would have made me nauseous if she would have been our president.
[04:17:06.026 --> 04:17:25.297]  If this doesn't scare you, just hearing that, that someone in our government could take 6,000 classified emails, that's just part of it, and give it to somebody else who is pulled out of office, under investigation for child pornography, and they could be on his computer, and they don't get in trouble.
[04:17:26.215 --> 04:17:30.717]  Okay, what makes you think they're not going to attack our free speech, which they're doing right now?
[04:17:31.277 --> 04:17:33.157]  What makes you think they're not going to try to shut us down?
[04:17:33.557 --> 04:17:37.739]  What makes you think they're not going to make stuff up to try and get us to shut up?
[04:17:38.319 --> 04:17:39.640]  Because that's what they're concerned with.
[04:17:40.120 --> 04:17:47.382]  They're concerned about people like us talking about people like that, who get away with crime after crime, nothing happens to them.
[04:17:50.663 --> 04:17:51.303]  You want to fight?
[04:17:51.544 --> 04:17:51.984]  You're getting it!
[04:17:52.004 --> 04:17:52.764]  You're getting it!
[04:17:57.995 --> 04:17:59.576]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[04:17:59.816 --> 04:18:01.277]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[04:18:01.698 --> 04:18:01.978]  Okay?
[04:18:02.278 --> 04:18:05.160]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[04:18:05.340 --> 04:18:07.042]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[04:18:07.062 --> 04:18:08.403]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[04:18:08.703 --> 04:18:09.403]  This is Texas.
[04:18:09.644 --> 04:18:10.464]  You wanna threaten me?
[04:18:10.524 --> 04:18:11.645]  You can go straight to hell.
[04:18:11.665 --> 04:18:12.305]  You understand that?
[04:18:12.466 --> 04:18:18.270]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[04:18:18.650 --> 04:18:22.453]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[04:18:25.297 --> 04:18:33.059]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[04:18:33.259 --> 04:18:39.700]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[04:18:39.920 --> 04:18:48.202]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[04:18:48.482 --> 04:18:57.247]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[04:18:57.507 --> 04:19:03.250]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:04.070]  It works!
[04:19:04.351 --> 04:19:12.656]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[04:19:12.816 --> 04:19:22.223]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[04:19:22.563 --> 04:19:23.063]  A total 360 win!
[04:19:25.151 --> 04:19:26.913]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman?
[04:19:26.933 --> 04:19:28.996]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[04:19:29.056 --> 04:19:32.461]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[04:19:32.922 --> 04:19:35.906]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[04:19:35.926 --> 04:19:36.507]  I'm 42.
[04:19:36.547 --> 04:19:39.431]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[04:19:39.611 --> 04:19:41.073]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[04:19:42.994 --> 04:19:44.135]  No, I'm not.
[04:19:44.155 --> 04:19:44.835]  I'm terrible.
[04:19:44.875 --> 04:19:45.415]  I'm terrible.
[04:19:45.515 --> 04:20:00.480]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years, and this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[04:20:00.520 --> 04:20:04.002]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[04:20:05.382 --> 04:20:10.625]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[04:20:10.665 --> 04:20:13.767]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[04:20:14.148 --> 04:20:15.449]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[04:20:15.829 --> 04:20:16.749]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:18.230]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[04:20:18.250 --> 04:20:25.435]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[04:20:28.377 --> 04:20:33.621]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[04:20:33.681 --> 04:20:35.382]  I felt it immediately.
[04:20:35.402 --> 04:20:37.623]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[04:20:37.723 --> 04:20:40.785]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[04:20:40.805 --> 04:20:41.946]  It tastes good to me.
[04:20:41.966 --> 04:20:45.989]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[04:20:46.029 --> 04:20:48.190]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[04:20:50.772 --> 04:20:51.853]  Bone broth!
[04:20:51.913 --> 04:20:57.058]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[04:20:57.078 --> 04:21:00.821]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[04:21:00.861 --> 04:21:08.628]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[04:21:08.688 --> 04:21:12.051]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my own thing.
[04:21:12.071 --> 04:21:13.873]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[04:21:14.574 --> 04:21:17.296]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street.
[04:21:17.316 --> 04:21:20.560]  I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[04:21:20.580 --> 04:21:21.861]  No fear, nothing.
[04:21:22.844 --> 04:21:30.188]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, Find the Globalist is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[04:21:30.908 --> 04:21:32.569]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:43.834]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[04:21:43.874 --> 04:21:45.115]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[04:21:45.175 --> 04:21:50.017]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[04:21:52.998 --> 04:21:54.779]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[04:21:54.819 --> 04:21:57.020]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[04:21:57.040 --> 04:22:05.124]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[04:22:05.144 --> 04:22:08.465]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[04:22:08.505 --> 04:22:11.346]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[04:22:11.446 --> 04:22:16.489]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[04:22:17.549 --> 04:22:24.433]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[04:22:25.753 --> 04:22:28.135]  How do we keep President Trump honest?
[04:22:32.418 --> 04:22:49.542]  I mean, look, we'd be idiots if we didn't say, thank God we got Gorsuch, thank God that they didn't get the Supreme Court, thank the good Lord above that we've got 300 billion in new jobs coming in and 3 trillion plus in the stock market and China's respecting us again and we're getting some better deals there and all these new companies are coming back, on and on and on and on and on.
[04:22:49.582 --> 04:22:51.783]  I mean, the first 70 days were almost perfect.
[04:22:51.863 --> 04:22:53.143]  I was just like floating on a cloud.
[04:22:53.583 --> 04:22:56.904]  And 70 days in, I thought, oh, is that just a shill that Bannon's out?
[04:22:58.505 --> 04:22:59.506]  The course changes.
[04:22:59.606 --> 04:23:01.067]  Now who is advising the president?
[04:23:01.107 --> 04:23:05.532]  I know he hears a bunch of people and then he makes the decisions, but clearly course changed.
[04:23:05.872 --> 04:23:08.495]  Is that because the whole government was just blocking in both parties?
[04:23:08.735 --> 04:23:09.756]  He couldn't get people in?
[04:23:10.137 --> 04:23:11.378]  There was a government revolt?
[04:23:11.438 --> 04:23:12.599]  We know the deep state did that.
[04:23:12.619 --> 04:23:13.240]  That's admitted.
[04:23:13.881 --> 04:23:15.222]  And then now he's having to compromise?
[04:23:15.242 --> 04:23:15.963]  Is that what's happening?
[04:23:15.983 --> 04:23:20.348]  Because I still see a lot of good he's doing, but you can see now that it's not a purist movement.
[04:23:21.235 --> 04:23:23.615]  I think he's being willfully misled, Alex.
[04:23:23.675 --> 04:23:24.416]  Here's what I know.
[04:23:24.736 --> 04:23:26.896]  I've known Donald Trump for almost 40 years.
[04:23:27.816 --> 04:23:32.717]  And when he has all the information, he almost invariably makes the right decision.
[04:23:33.337 --> 04:23:46.220]  It is only when he does not have all the information or the information that he's been given has been colored or altered or manipulated to give him a false impression that mistakes are made.
[04:23:46.920 --> 04:23:57.209]  We know for a fact that every single one of his advisors urged him to send 150,000 ground troops, boots on the ground, in Syria.
[04:23:57.810 --> 04:24:01.032]  And fortunately, there was one man in the White House who didn't like that idea.
[04:24:01.473 --> 04:24:04.255]  One man who said, no, that's a terrible public policy.
[04:24:04.616 --> 04:24:05.677]  No, we're not doing that.
[04:24:06.317 --> 04:24:07.817]  That man was Donald J. Trump.
[04:24:08.378 --> 04:24:11.979]  So my confidence continues to be with the president.
[04:24:12.539 --> 04:24:15.980]  And my opposition is to those who mislead him.
[04:24:16.640 --> 04:24:22.722]  I picked up today's New York Times today to read about Ivanka Trump's agenda for the next four years.
[04:24:23.722 --> 04:24:24.963]  Ivanka had an agenda?
[04:24:25.903 --> 04:24:26.383]  Who knew?
[04:24:27.303 --> 04:24:28.324]  I saw her at the convention.
[04:24:28.344 --> 04:24:29.524]  I thought she was terrific.
[04:24:30.084 --> 04:24:30.624]  I like her.
[04:24:30.985 --> 04:24:32.125]  I think she is terrific.
[04:24:32.465 --> 04:24:35.286]  But now suddenly she's unveiling an agenda?
[04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:38.190]  Who voted for Ivanka Trump?
[04:24:38.930 --> 04:24:41.391]  Who voted for Jared Kushner?
[04:24:42.092 --> 04:24:44.633]  Who voted for any of these globalists?
[04:24:45.814 --> 04:24:55.058]  And then we have news today that Richard Grinnell, who no one, I think, fought harder and more effectively for Donald Trump.
[04:24:55.118 --> 04:25:03.482]  Grinnell, a former diplomat under the Bush administration, but a guy who's come full circle, who understands the danger of the globalists,
[04:25:03.942 --> 04:25:04.622]  We're good to go.
[04:25:21.573 --> 04:25:22.273]  Nomination.
[04:25:22.734 --> 04:25:28.217]  We learned today that that appointment has been nixed by Rex Tillerson.
[04:25:28.237 --> 04:25:38.663]  And I am told that it is because he objects to the fact that Grinnell, despite the fact that he is learned and distinguished in experience, is openly gay.
[04:25:39.463 --> 04:25:41.284]  Now, that's not what I voted for.
[04:25:41.304 --> 04:25:42.525]  Not me.
[04:25:43.405 --> 04:25:44.346]  I'm a libertarian.
[04:25:44.406 --> 04:25:46.387]  I don't care about your sexual orientation.
[04:25:46.888 --> 04:25:50.810]  I care about your philosophy and your experience and your qualifications.
[04:25:51.210 --> 04:25:53.151]  This is very disappointing.
[04:25:53.792 --> 04:25:57.274]  And making it even worse, Alex, is the people surrounding
[04:25:58.371 --> 04:25:59.572]  Secretary Tillerson.
[04:26:00.172 --> 04:26:01.252]  They're never Trumpers.
[04:26:01.973 --> 04:26:06.415]  The people tell him that he can't hire Grinnell, a Trump loyalist.
[04:26:07.095 --> 04:26:08.696]  They're never Trumpers.
[04:26:09.316 --> 04:26:22.963]  This is a real blow to those who understand loyalty, to those who understand the quality and the character of Rick Grinnell, a man who has earned this job, in my opinion.
[04:26:24.861 --> 04:26:28.011]  CNN says we're exploding and we're dangerous.
[04:26:28.372 --> 04:26:31.160]  That's right, we're almost nine hours in right now.
[04:26:31.180 --> 04:26:32.243]  I'll be here for the next few hours.
[04:26:34.390 --> 04:26:36.972]  Of course, I've got Owen Schroyer here with me right now.
[04:26:37.012 --> 04:26:44.118]  We've got Anthony Cumia, legendary talk show host, censored more than even Howard Stern, for his conservative statements, by the way.
[04:26:44.558 --> 04:26:47.221]  Cuss words are okay, I guess, on talk radio, but not conservatism.
[04:26:47.601 --> 04:26:48.281]  He's going to be joining us.
[04:26:48.341 --> 04:26:49.963]  And Roger Stone's got big breaking news.
[04:26:50.003 --> 04:26:52.605]  Mike Cernovich dropped huge bombs today.
[04:26:53.145 --> 04:27:01.952]  And, you know, I apologize to Mike Cernovich for saying that one of his sources was, he didn't get mad at me, but I was partially wrong, was Donald Trump Jr.
[04:27:03.747 --> 04:27:05.408]  I was just saying the media's already said that.
[04:27:05.568 --> 04:27:06.889]  He tweets him all the time.
[04:27:07.289 --> 04:27:09.190]  We know he's one of the biggest patriots inside.
[04:27:09.931 --> 04:27:13.813]  And I know that... I know who Cernovich's people are.
[04:27:13.853 --> 04:27:15.594]  They're high-level staffers.
[04:27:15.634 --> 04:27:16.675]  We have some of the same ones.
[04:27:16.715 --> 04:27:19.897]  But he, for some reason, they return his calls all the time.
[04:27:19.917 --> 04:27:21.858]  And I guess he works them better than I do, which is fine.
[04:27:21.898 --> 04:27:23.319]  I'm glad Cernovich is there.
[04:27:24.059 --> 04:27:26.381]  But it is true that it's not Donald Jr.
[04:27:26.421 --> 04:27:28.422]  giving him the big scoops.
[04:27:28.602 --> 04:27:31.404]  It's just Donald Jr., I guess, that got him introduced to a bunch of people.
[04:27:32.104 --> 04:27:39.347]  But it's making him so mad, and CNN has come out with a big report that's one of the only accurate ones I've ever seen them do.
[04:27:39.687 --> 04:27:40.887]  It's quasi-accurate.
[04:27:41.387 --> 04:27:52.091]  And this is what I was told by a major New York Times writer, another filmmaker slash major Hollywood writer and journalist, and then now some other phone calls.
[04:27:52.131 --> 04:27:54.912]  They're being very nice right now, and they're saying,
[04:27:56.972 --> 04:28:05.436]  Stop getting into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the 300 missing billion, which the Treasury Secretary came out two days ago and said we were right, broke it two months ago, and just leave Muslims alone.
[04:28:05.696 --> 04:28:06.616]  I am leaving Muslims alone.
[04:28:06.636 --> 04:28:08.257]  I didn't want to start the wars, I wanted to stir them up.
[04:28:08.637 --> 04:28:20.642]  But I don't want the most radical Muslims brought over, unvetted from seven countries, where they just, the local imams run the passports, you know, and you drive in a bus with a bunch of chickens on it to a bombed out airport, then they fly here one flight a week.
[04:28:20.702 --> 04:28:22.143]  What the, in Hades is that?
[04:28:22.623 --> 04:28:30.686]  I love how they blame you when you were the first one to try to take the heat off of Muslims for 9-11 and put the mirror right at the American government for false flags.
[04:28:32.427 --> 04:28:35.688]  Exactly, but the media then misrepresented what I said.
[04:28:36.448 --> 04:28:38.029]  Criminal elements of our government
[04:28:38.809 --> 04:28:52.274]  Like Mr. Brennan, who is an admitted Wahhabist, have sold out to the Saudis, and the Saudis and Prince Bandar and all the rest of them were heavily involved, and then their enemy, when we had 9-11, Iraq, got attacked.
[04:28:52.854 --> 04:28:53.555]  That was wrong.
[04:28:53.675 --> 04:28:54.515]  We blamed Iraq.
[04:28:54.895 --> 04:28:55.515]  It was wrong.
[04:28:55.855 --> 04:28:56.536]  It's a fraud.
[04:28:56.836 --> 04:28:57.636]  That's the history.
[04:28:57.856 --> 04:28:58.496]  That's a fact.
[04:28:58.557 --> 04:28:59.457]  It's come out in Congress.
[04:28:59.697 --> 04:29:04.439]  And I've had Walter Jones on probably 15 times, one of the best members of Congress, from North Carolina.
[04:29:05.319 --> 04:29:07.402]  Who has seen the secret 28 pages.
[04:29:08.203 --> 04:29:10.106]  Senator Graham, seen 28 pages.
[04:29:10.206 --> 04:29:11.628]  We've interviewed him once on camera.
[04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:13.931]  That he was an RNC or something.
[04:29:14.712 --> 04:29:20.940]  And the Transportation Secretary Panetta, all of them have come out and said there was a stand down.
[04:29:21.721 --> 04:29:23.482]  Ordered because the Saudis were involved.
[04:29:23.943 --> 04:29:32.048]  The government then had a NORAD takeover drill, putting all these inputs onto the screens of NORAD and the FAA, where they thought it was a hijacking drill.
[04:29:32.528 --> 04:29:38.552]  They ordered the F-16s to fly at intercept at stallout speed, like 250 miles an hour.
[04:29:39.192 --> 04:29:40.533]  I've interviewed all the people involved.
[04:29:40.893 --> 04:29:44.335]  I had Colonel Don DeGranpre, who was a CIA weapons shipper.
[04:29:45.736 --> 04:29:48.839]  On, and he had been at the Pentagon and met with the generals.
[04:29:48.879 --> 04:29:51.581]  He even gave me the names of the pilots that refused orders.
[04:29:52.622 --> 04:29:58.366]  The general higher-up refused orders in the Air Force and ordered two AIM-9s, Sidewinder missiles, into Flight 93.
[04:29:58.786 --> 04:30:03.070]  There was no let's roll and stewardesses at 30-something thousand feet on regular cell phones.
[04:30:03.490 --> 04:30:04.411]  All that sounds great.
[04:30:04.431 --> 04:30:04.951]  It was made up.
[04:30:05.571 --> 04:30:08.954]  The Air Force did the right thing because that thing was going right at the Capitol and they blew it up.
[04:30:09.494 --> 04:30:10.275]  But I'm digressing.
[04:30:10.295 --> 04:30:11.136]  I want to get Kumi on.
[04:30:12.492 --> 04:30:15.212]  You sit there and say, oh, the government!
[04:30:15.873 --> 04:30:17.393]  In fact, I would get confronted on CNN.
[04:30:17.433 --> 04:30:19.333]  Are you saying the firefighters and the police were part of it?
[04:30:19.373 --> 04:30:20.233]  No, they were the heroes.
[04:30:22.034 --> 04:30:23.594]  But clearly there were bombs in the buildings.
[04:30:23.674 --> 04:30:25.434]  Clearly Deep State was working with the Muslims.
[04:30:25.674 --> 04:30:29.975]  And now you see Europe opening its borders to the Muslims, 5 million of them, 80% military age men.
[04:30:30.355 --> 04:30:31.355]  You see them working with it.
[04:30:31.375 --> 04:30:40.017]  I mean, I remember the FBI was in the news at the time saying, in late 2001, right after the tax thing, it's like Al-Qaeda has moles in the FBI and CIA.
[04:30:40.057 --> 04:30:41.297]  They know what we're going to do before we do it.
[04:30:41.917 --> 04:30:50.186]  That's because the top people were working with Saudi Arabia coordinating, and I saw it on Larry King Live, a week or two after 9-11, Prince Bandar.
[04:30:50.387 --> 04:30:51.228]  That was Bandar Bush.
[04:30:51.528 --> 04:30:52.589]  He's like best friends with the Bush family.
[04:30:52.609 --> 04:30:53.190]  He's up at any time.
[04:30:53.650 --> 04:30:54.031]  He's brought 9-11.
[04:30:54.071 --> 04:30:55.232]  Owen Troyer.
[04:30:56.286 --> 04:31:00.269]  And Bandar Bush was on CNN on Larry King Live.
[04:31:00.289 --> 04:31:03.852]  Larry King Live says, oh, the murderer, piece of garbage, you know, coward.
[04:31:04.452 --> 04:31:04.972]  Some of it lied.
[04:31:04.992 --> 04:31:06.874]  And he goes, oh, watch yourself.
[04:31:06.934 --> 04:31:08.575]  Somebody's got to go find the archives of this and do it.
[04:31:08.815 --> 04:31:10.216]  Watch yourself, Larry King.
[04:31:10.236 --> 04:31:12.338]  He is a hero in my country.
[04:31:12.398 --> 04:31:13.979]  And King goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[04:31:13.999 --> 04:31:16.041]  And he goes, yes, now you'll understand.
[04:31:16.421 --> 04:31:17.582]  Because they're heroes.
[04:31:17.642 --> 04:31:18.763]  They look good over there.
[04:31:19.883 --> 04:31:21.605]  Then their enemy, Saudi Arabia,
[04:31:22.774 --> 04:31:26.175]  It gets Saudi Arabia's enemy, Iraq gets hit.
[04:31:27.475 --> 04:31:29.716]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this.
[04:31:29.776 --> 04:31:37.938]  And so here I am, exposing it day one, and they're attacking me saying the government did it, no criminal elements did it, and then they claim that I'm saying radical Islam doesn't exist.
[04:31:37.978 --> 04:31:43.840]  No, this whole broadcast is about defense of the West, because a Turkish-slash-Islamic Kurd
[04:31:44.620 --> 04:31:56.824]  Who's on the Federal Reserve Board of New York that runs the whole Federal Reserve, and who gets billions from a school lunch program with a monopoly through his yogurt company, who works with the UN and Peter Sutherland and George Soros to bring in the illegals.
[04:31:57.484 --> 04:31:59.105]  Or excuse me, we don't know he was bringing illegals.
[04:31:59.285 --> 04:32:03.767]  Let's bring in unvetted people, I'm not saying he brings in illegals, into the country.
[04:32:05.247 --> 04:32:07.028]  And then he says, oh, it's the State Department does it.
[04:32:07.048 --> 04:32:08.968]  But he lobbies through the UN and the State Department.
[04:32:09.128 --> 04:32:10.189]  The UN certifies it.
[04:32:11.138 --> 04:32:17.904]  Just makes it up, says it's good, the State Department then brings him in, and then he's suing me saying, I say that Muslims being brought in are bringing TB.
[04:32:18.305 --> 04:32:25.131]  I've had five law firms look at it, two of them we've engaged, they say it's the biggest joke lawsuit they've ever seen, probably done for publicity stuff.
[04:32:25.832 --> 04:32:27.894]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[04:32:28.154 --> 04:32:29.475]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[04:33:25.410 --> 04:33:26.851]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[04:33:29.592 --> 04:33:36.895]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[04:33:37.095 --> 04:33:47.380]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[04:33:47.740 --> 04:33:55.261]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[04:33:55.581 --> 04:34:05.523]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[04:34:05.783 --> 04:34:07.744]  And this part is most important.
[04:34:07.844 --> 04:34:14.265]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[04:34:14.625 --> 04:34:15.786]  That means it's clean.
[04:34:16.066 --> 04:34:17.107]  That means it's pure.
[04:34:17.207 --> 04:34:19.968]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[04:34:20.108 --> 04:34:22.870]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:24.571]  Take action now before we sell out.
[04:34:25.452 --> 04:34:29.834]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[04:34:29.934 --> 04:34:40.861]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[04:34:41.021 --> 04:34:45.943]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[04:34:46.063 --> 04:34:48.564]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[04:34:48.644 --> 04:34:50.124]  It helps detoxify.
[04:34:50.344 --> 04:34:53.186]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[04:34:53.226 --> 04:34:57.987]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[04:34:58.007 --> 04:35:02.129]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[04:35:02.569 --> 04:35:09.573]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[04:35:09.693 --> 04:35:11.114]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[04:35:11.314 --> 04:35:12.055]  This is so key.
[04:35:12.295 --> 04:35:16.598]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[04:35:16.638 --> 04:35:18.719]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[04:35:18.839 --> 04:35:22.301]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[04:35:25.666 --> 04:35:31.829]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[04:35:32.229 --> 04:35:35.091]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[04:35:35.431 --> 04:35:40.633]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[04:35:41.054 --> 04:35:47.037]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[04:35:47.177 --> 04:35:50.298]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[04:35:50.458 --> 04:35:51.919]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[04:35:52.119 --> 04:35:56.262]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[04:35:56.442 --> 04:35:59.305]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[04:35:59.385 --> 04:36:00.966]  It works like an antioxidant.
[04:36:01.046 --> 04:36:04.249]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[04:36:04.529 --> 04:36:06.851]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:08.092]  It's in powder form.
[04:36:08.192 --> 04:36:10.894]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[04:36:11.074 --> 04:36:11.654]  I take this.
[04:36:11.775 --> 04:36:13.476]  This is the product that I take.
[04:36:13.596 --> 04:36:15.558]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[04:36:16.358 --> 04:36:18.039]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.
[04:36:18.339 --> 04:36:24.243]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[04:36:24.443 --> 04:36:32.788]  There's another way of thinking than this liberal, progressive crap that we see on a daily basis.
[04:36:37.882 --> 04:36:43.366]  Let's go ahead and go to Anthony Comey, and I apologize, we got him on about 10 minutes late, and he's here, and we got about 20 minutes, and Roger Stone's joining us.
[04:36:43.386 --> 04:36:50.691]  Tell us about your network, how folks listen, and the fact that you had number one show in the country, syndicated in the cities you were in, kicked off the year.
[04:36:50.891 --> 04:36:54.734]  Not because of cussing, but because big corporations didn't like it and control the FCC.
[04:36:54.994 --> 04:36:59.217]  Then kicked off XM, because you call people killing cops animals, and they are animals.
[04:36:59.537 --> 04:37:04.421]  So the fact is, you've been successful over and over again, and now you've been relegated to the internet, which is great.
[04:37:05.001 --> 04:37:05.301]  Oh my god.
[04:37:05.321 --> 04:37:05.742]  No, please, Alex.
[04:37:05.762 --> 04:37:06.262]  First of all,
[04:37:27.122 --> 04:37:29.024]  Boy, are they coming after you.
[04:37:29.564 --> 04:37:30.305]  I've seen this.
[04:37:30.785 --> 04:37:41.855]  It's happening all over with people that are making a difference and getting to the people and actually giving them something that they can latch on and say, yes, I want to fight.
[04:37:42.235 --> 04:37:43.596]  I want to listen to this guy.
[04:37:43.736 --> 04:37:47.920]  I want to hear an opposing viewpoint from the mainstream media.
[04:37:48.400 --> 04:37:54.367]  And you have been on the forefront of this for so long, and man, they are coming after you.
[04:37:54.687 --> 04:38:10.425]  If anybody thinks this is a coincidence, that all of a sudden a bunch of people that are stirring other people up, that are getting them to think, that are getting them to see that there's another way of thinking than this liberal, progressive crap that we see on a daily basis,
[04:38:10.865 --> 04:38:13.687]  They are taking us out of the mix.
[04:38:13.707 --> 04:38:18.110]  They're trying to quiet us because we're dangerous to them.
[04:38:18.370 --> 04:38:28.537]  We are totally against their plan of keeping everybody under wraps, under their feet, their boots on our necks.
[04:38:28.577 --> 04:38:33.320]  And you are a prime example right now of them trying to discredit you.
[04:38:33.400 --> 04:38:35.141]  It's been that way for so long.
[04:38:35.541 --> 04:38:35.821]  Me?
[04:38:36.162 --> 04:38:39.986]  I've been thrown off of every single type of mainstream media there is.
[04:38:40.326 --> 04:38:43.089]  I've had to literally start my network.
[04:38:43.149 --> 04:38:47.353]  Even though you always get top ratings and are always number one, it's because you are effective.
[04:38:47.373 --> 04:38:50.596]  Your voice and your information carries gravitas.
[04:38:50.736 --> 04:38:51.797]  That's why you're shut down.
[04:38:52.662 --> 04:38:53.463]  That's what it is.
[04:38:53.543 --> 04:38:56.627]  They don't want us to have too much juice.
[04:38:57.108 --> 04:38:58.269]  Too much power.
[04:38:58.650 --> 04:39:03.436]  And the second you start really influencing people, if you're making jokes, maybe it's one thing.
[04:39:03.456 --> 04:39:07.241]  No, the second you start acting like a man trying to have a country for your children, then you're off the air.
[04:39:08.044 --> 04:39:08.925]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:39:09.285 --> 04:39:11.027]  That's a thing of the past.
[04:39:11.767 --> 04:39:12.608]  I'm disgusted.
[04:39:12.648 --> 04:39:21.556]  I watched some amazing documentaries on World War I and II, and Korea, Vietnam, and you just see men acting like men.
[04:39:21.956 --> 04:39:23.857]  And that now is a bad word?
[04:39:24.198 --> 04:39:26.980]  You're not allowed to be a man in this country anymore.
[04:39:27.000 --> 04:39:30.803]  Colleges are saying don't have paintings or murals of muscular men on the sports team.
[04:39:30.863 --> 04:39:32.485]  It's hurtful to those that aren't muscular.
[04:39:36.356 --> 04:39:38.798]  Is every story now worthy of The Onion?
[04:39:39.199 --> 04:39:44.603]  I used to read The Onion, a great parody site, and think, oh, that's hilarious because it's so ridiculous.
[04:39:44.883 --> 04:39:53.110]  Now mainstream media is absolutely outdoing The Onion for the most ridiculous things you'll ever, ever read.
[04:39:53.970 --> 04:40:11.460]  Let me ask you this, because you don't want to get into it, and we don't like to bitch about what's happening to us, but I mean, talk about the persecution you've gone through getting kicked off your hit show that was on for a decade, you know, had in many cases more viewers and listeners than Stern, and then you get kicked off because you stand up against Black Lives Matter going around killing cops.
[04:40:12.213 --> 04:40:19.463]  Yeah, all you have to say is exactly what leaders in the black community have said for years and years and years.
[04:40:19.663 --> 04:40:21.005]  There's a problem with violence.
[04:40:21.305 --> 04:40:25.891]  There's a problem with out-of-wedlock children.
[04:40:26.512 --> 04:40:28.255]  And you just bring that up.
[04:40:28.575 --> 04:40:31.158]  But I'm not the right person to bring that up.
[04:40:31.238 --> 04:40:40.907]  So when I did, I was called, you know, racist and you're relegated to trying to fight against what labels people are giving you.
[04:40:41.748 --> 04:40:42.169]  No more.
[04:40:42.749 --> 04:40:45.192]  You don't even get to argue that point anymore.
[04:40:45.492 --> 04:40:53.883]  You're now arguing that, oh no, I'm not a racist, I'm not the, and they take you out of the mix for what you originally were trying to discuss.
[04:40:53.963 --> 04:40:58.849]  And I should add, compoundmedia.com, you're so polite when you plug it, compoundmedia.com.
[04:40:58.869 --> 04:41:00.591]  By the way, the purpose is a survival mechanism.
[04:41:00.631 --> 04:41:01.532]  They're huge, they're great.
[04:41:01.993 --> 04:41:04.035]  I want people to be bigger than we are.
[04:41:04.676 --> 04:41:05.857]  And in some cases, a lot of folks are.
[04:41:06.197 --> 04:41:08.398]  Some of their shows have more views than we do.
[04:41:08.758 --> 04:41:11.240]  That is a really good feeling, because I don't like being the only target here.
[04:41:11.380 --> 04:41:13.961]  It seems like that's kind of what's happening, but they kind of pick somebody.
[04:41:13.981 --> 04:41:15.662]  But let's shift gears and jump in any time.
[04:41:15.682 --> 04:41:17.783]  I know you host the last two hours, but Owen, jump in.
[04:41:17.823 --> 04:41:19.244]  I didn't just have you in here to sit there.
[04:41:19.264 --> 04:41:22.185]  I know you're an awesome, awesome reporter, so please jump in.
[04:41:22.966 --> 04:41:24.507]  But talking about this,
[04:41:25.527 --> 04:41:26.488]  Take Stephen Colbert.
[04:41:26.528 --> 04:41:29.709]  He attacked me, that I know of, nine times the last two weeks.
[04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:32.411]  Lied about me, but oh, it's comedy, so it's okay.
[04:41:32.651 --> 04:41:37.994]  Said I was a racist, said I didn't know what my kids' names were, said I didn't know what, you know, two teachers were out of, like, 16 teachers.
[04:41:38.594 --> 04:41:44.157]  You know, after I had lunch, when I'm sitting there on the stand or whatever, and I'm like, literally, I had a bunch of chili, and I can't remember every teacher, sorry.
[04:41:45.057 --> 04:41:45.958]  Nobody can, okay?
[04:41:45.978 --> 04:41:49.099]  But the point is, I'm too busy actually working to be able to teach.
[04:41:49.119 --> 04:41:51.821]  I go to all the conferences, the kids get straight A's.
[04:41:52.061 --> 04:41:52.701]  Isn't that enough?
[04:41:52.761 --> 04:41:54.122]  You know, they're good kids, but...
[04:41:54.963 --> 04:42:04.525]  Here he comes and he says this statement we'll play it in a few minutes, which he says that basically he's a holster for Vladimir Putin's Vienna sausage.
[04:42:05.245 --> 04:42:07.465]  And it's somewhat of a family show, but big deal.
[04:42:07.485 --> 04:42:11.026]  That's what was said, saying that he's a minion of Russia and he's bad.
[04:42:11.386 --> 04:42:12.826]  He's totally pushing Russia around.
[04:42:12.866 --> 04:42:13.886]  He's pushing China around.
[04:42:13.926 --> 04:42:15.147]  He's pushing North Korea around.
[04:42:15.627 --> 04:42:16.487]  This is pure bull.
[04:42:16.987 --> 04:42:17.447]  It was U.S.
[04:42:17.487 --> 04:42:19.988]  intelligence leaked the stuff, you know, like Hillary's saying it's the Russians.
[04:42:20.428 --> 04:42:22.008]  And so WikiLeaks and all this is happening.
[04:42:22.568 --> 04:42:24.249]  Look, then they're saying, oh, it's homophobic.
[04:42:24.269 --> 04:42:28.213]  They're now even, Anthony, eating their own, when clearly it's not homophobic.
[04:42:28.293 --> 04:42:31.675]  It's saying he's a butt kisser of Putin, which he isn't.
[04:42:31.695 --> 04:42:41.243]  If you call somebody a you-know-what sucker, like I call Congressman Schiff, I said he's a globalist you-know-what sucker, just like when De Niro says it in a movie about somebody.
[04:42:41.383 --> 04:42:43.865]  It means that they're groveling.
[04:42:44.145 --> 04:42:45.747]  It means they're servicing somebody.
[04:42:45.787 --> 04:42:47.248]  It isn't attacking gay people.
[04:42:47.688 --> 04:42:48.930]  We could do that if we wanted to.
[04:42:48.990 --> 04:42:49.551]  It's free speech.
[04:42:49.611 --> 04:42:52.935]  But even Colbert, they're saying, may lose his job over this.
[04:42:53.155 --> 04:42:54.297]  This is dangerous.
[04:42:54.897 --> 04:43:00.104]  Alex, what you're actually saying here is that the left knows what context is.
[04:43:00.605 --> 04:43:01.666]  Oh my God!
[04:43:01.966 --> 04:43:04.510]  They have no clue about context comedy.
[04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.950]  Sarcasm.
[04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:16.533]  Everything that's said by anybody is taken at face value and should be dissected like that and the discipline should be doled out accordingly.
[04:43:16.893 --> 04:43:19.554]  It's amazing and I do love watching them eat their own.
[04:43:19.974 --> 04:43:26.896]  I am a First Amendment advocate like no one has seen and I don't want anybody fired for anything they say.
[04:43:27.236 --> 04:43:35.242]  But if you're delusional enough to think that a network talk show host could get away with saying anything like that about Obama without
[04:43:44.770 --> 04:43:47.372]  Public execution, you're out of your mind.
[04:43:47.692 --> 04:43:49.093]  That's the problem I have.
[04:43:49.213 --> 04:43:52.556]  I don't have a problem with Colbert saying whatever he wants about anybody.
[04:43:52.856 --> 04:44:02.644]  I have a problem with the double standard that people like myself and my friends and associates are crucified for making a joke about a minority group or what have you.
[04:44:03.044 --> 04:44:05.246]  And then when it comes around to someone like Colbert,
[04:44:05.546 --> 04:44:06.366]  He gets free reign!
[04:44:06.386 --> 04:44:06.927]  Well, exactly.
[04:44:07.027 --> 04:44:11.849]  I'm from Texas, and I like to make fun of rednecks, and I'm not bashing, but I mean, I've got some family.
[04:44:11.869 --> 04:44:14.230]  They're nice people, but they're literally like the Beverly Hillbillies.
[04:44:14.571 --> 04:44:21.014]  I may sound like there's some other people, but, you know, I'm kind of like Beverly Hillbilly Light, and it's kind of fun, but then I want to make fun of Asian people.
[04:44:21.054 --> 04:44:22.134]  My sister's Asian-adopted.
[04:44:22.174 --> 04:44:22.655]  I love Asians.
[04:44:22.735 --> 04:44:23.575]  It's funny, though.
[04:44:23.835 --> 04:44:25.536]  You know, the North Korean stuff's sad, but it's funny.
[04:44:25.556 --> 04:44:28.798]  You know, Kim Jong-un, and people say, oh, you're being anti-Asian.
[04:44:28.858 --> 04:44:30.539]  No, it's funny stuff is funny.
[04:44:30.559 --> 04:44:31.619]  I mean, look at Japanese.
[04:44:31.639 --> 04:44:32.540]  They make fun of themselves.
[04:44:33.413 --> 04:44:33.794]  Sure!
[04:44:34.194 --> 04:44:34.695]  Absolutely!
[04:44:34.755 --> 04:44:34.935]  What?
[04:44:34.975 --> 04:44:38.880]  That used to be something that was taken in context of comedy.
[04:44:39.141 --> 04:44:41.424]  You could absolutely do stereotypical jokes.
[04:44:41.484 --> 04:44:43.166]  Remember Belushi doing the samurai?
[04:44:43.707 --> 04:44:44.408]  Absolutely!
[04:44:44.488 --> 04:44:47.732]  No one thought that was... Sorry.
[04:44:48.373 --> 04:44:49.194]  I can't do that anymore.
[04:44:49.354 --> 04:44:50.154]  That'd be too offensive.
[04:44:50.174 --> 04:44:54.617]  No one thought it was hateful or that you were inciting violence against these people.
[04:44:54.817 --> 04:44:55.837]  They're insane!
[04:44:56.058 --> 04:44:59.760]  The left is mentally ill when it comes to things like this.
[04:44:59.920 --> 04:45:02.381]  You know, and you talk about Stephen Colbert's show.
[04:45:02.502 --> 04:45:10.907]  I remember I watched Stephen Colbert like six, seven, eight years ago, and he would actually make fun of Obama regularly, but he would do it in a tasteful manner.
[04:45:10.927 --> 04:45:11.387]  He did it
[04:45:11.847 --> 04:45:15.869]  Where it was creative, it was funny, it was what you would expect with any president.
[04:45:15.889 --> 04:45:18.731]  Of course, make fun of Trump, of course he's the president, of course he's gonna get made fun of.
[04:45:18.971 --> 04:45:20.032]  But make it tasteful!
[04:45:20.432 --> 04:45:23.714]  Don't make some, you know, crude penis joke that's not funny!
[04:45:24.154 --> 04:45:25.655]  That's the key, it's not funny!
[04:45:25.995 --> 04:45:27.696]  When did Stephen Colbert quit being funny?
[04:45:28.016 --> 04:45:32.078]  It's when all the people... I don't even know if it's the left... When did he become Tuck Buckford?
[04:45:32.459 --> 04:45:33.239]  Tuck Buckford?
[04:45:33.259 --> 04:45:36.101]  Let me put this, let me put this yogurt in my hair.
[04:45:36.781 --> 04:45:47.566]  If they would just stick to comedy, if they would try to be funny instead of trying to make a political message every night, then Stephen Colbert would be... This is what happens when you take steroids and peyote!
[04:45:47.686 --> 04:45:48.446]  This is what happens!
[04:45:49.046 --> 04:45:52.548]  Stephen Colbert has won, I'm pretty sure that he's won multiple Grammys.
[04:45:52.608 --> 04:46:00.011]  I think that his writers have run Grammys because he had a funny show when he was on Comedy Central, and then he got too political, he wanted to make a...
[04:46:04.361 --> 04:46:08.005]  Let me ask this question of Anthony Comey at compoundmedia.com.
[04:46:08.405 --> 04:46:12.950]  Look, I don't like to sit up here and beg the audience to support us, but here's the deal.
[04:46:12.990 --> 04:46:14.332]  Yeah, we'll play Blue Sheet in a minute with audio.
[04:46:16.494 --> 04:46:17.415]  You could never do that today.
[04:46:17.435 --> 04:46:23.202]  In fact, I think I'm going to go back and recreate some skits and then watch the media attack me, because we've got to exercise, kind of like open carry.
[04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:29.553]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[04:46:30.213 --> 04:46:31.794]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[04:46:32.194 --> 04:46:37.177]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[04:46:37.537 --> 04:46:43.001]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[04:46:43.381 --> 04:46:49.965]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[04:46:50.625 --> 04:46:51.766]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[04:46:52.606 --> 04:46:54.567]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[04:46:54.887 --> 04:46:57.829]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[04:46:58.269 --> 04:47:01.891]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[04:47:02.091 --> 04:47:04.652]  It is the base to so many things.
[04:47:04.692 --> 04:47:17.039]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[04:47:17.259 --> 04:47:22.363]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[04:47:22.483 --> 04:47:24.004]  It's bound.
[04:47:24.125 --> 04:47:25.105]  It's not absorbable.
[04:47:25.526 --> 04:47:30.089]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:35.233]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[04:47:35.714 --> 04:47:40.598]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[04:47:40.698 --> 04:47:41.859]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[04:47:41.999 --> 04:47:44.601]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[04:47:44.701 --> 04:47:45.401]  Thanks for having me.
[04:48:07.571 --> 04:48:10.193]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[04:48:10.213 --> 04:48:11.253]  You've got to have water to live.
[04:48:11.594 --> 04:48:12.314]  Iodine is key.
[04:48:12.334 --> 04:48:12.954]  You must have it.
[04:48:13.295 --> 04:48:20.859]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[04:48:20.879 --> 04:48:23.201]  We can answer your questions.
[04:48:23.221 --> 04:48:24.282]  888-253-3139.
[04:48:28.664 --> 04:48:30.726]  Let's bring on Baked Alaska.
[04:48:32.066 --> 04:48:34.088]  And I've got a couple things that I want to talk to you about.
[04:48:35.069 --> 04:48:39.694]  And I'll tell you what, I'll give you, I can't decide, so I'm going to let you decide where we get started.
[04:48:40.115 --> 04:48:51.288]  We can either go right into meme story time, or we can talk about the breaking news that you've been on top of with BuzzFeed Ben and Macy on BuzzFeed.
[04:48:51.328 --> 04:48:52.149]  Where do you want to start?
[04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.870]  Hmm.
[04:48:54.231 --> 04:48:55.091]  Well, wow.
[04:48:55.592 --> 04:48:56.793]  Thanks for having me on, Owen.
[04:48:56.833 --> 04:48:57.934]  This is amazing.
[04:48:57.954 --> 04:49:01.056]  Yeah, there's so much to talk about.
[04:49:01.256 --> 04:49:03.018]  I mean, I say let's start out.
[04:49:03.278 --> 04:49:04.219]  Let's have some fun.
[04:49:04.259 --> 04:49:05.360]  Let's get into the memes.
[04:49:05.780 --> 04:49:06.140]  Okay.
[04:49:06.180 --> 04:49:08.902]  Now, do you want to go first?
[04:49:08.922 --> 04:49:09.783]  Or do you want me to go first?
[04:49:09.823 --> 04:49:12.745]  Because I've got quite a presentation ready to go here.
[04:49:12.765 --> 04:49:16.789]  I think you should kick it off.
[04:49:16.849 --> 04:49:18.550]  So, I sent you the photos.
[04:49:18.710 --> 04:49:19.691]  I hope you have them there.
[04:49:20.011 --> 04:49:21.833]  Do you guys have his photos ready to go?
[04:49:23.496 --> 04:49:23.776]  Yes.
[04:49:24.757 --> 04:49:26.197]  Okay, so let's start with mine.
[04:49:26.378 --> 04:49:26.678]  All right.
[04:49:27.298 --> 04:49:38.844]  This is Welcome to Meme Storytime, brought to you by Owen Schroyer on the 30-hour Defense of Liberty InfoWars special broadcast.
[04:49:39.345 --> 04:49:45.168]  This story starts off in a time where the United States had weak leadership.
[04:49:46.047 --> 04:49:53.513]  It was so weak, in fact, that many of the world leaders didn't even know the name of our very own president.
[04:49:55.214 --> 04:50:00.038]  It was so weak, in fact, that something compelled Donald Trump to run for office.
[04:50:01.119 --> 04:50:03.000]  Nobody understood the high energy.
[04:50:03.621 --> 04:50:05.102]  Nobody knows where he got it.
[04:50:06.063 --> 04:50:06.783]  This man.
[04:50:07.724 --> 04:50:12.068]  All of a sudden, high energy Donald Trump decides to run for office.
[04:50:13.038 --> 04:50:15.080]  Now the mainstream media had to do something.
[04:50:15.760 --> 04:50:17.482]  They had to beat him up all day long.
[04:50:18.402 --> 04:50:21.125]  They didn't know what to do with this man and his high energy.
[04:50:21.785 --> 04:50:31.313]  So the media had to pummel him all day long and he took their beatings all while going about his day and fighting for the American people.
[04:50:31.453 --> 04:50:32.734]  The fake news was all over it.
[04:50:33.715 --> 04:50:37.698]  They had their henchmen making up stories like Brian Williams.
[04:50:38.547 --> 04:50:40.148]  You remember Pussygate.
[04:50:40.468 --> 04:50:41.849]  Yes, that video.
[04:50:42.370 --> 04:50:43.450]  It was all over the news.
[04:50:44.491 --> 04:50:50.575]  While some of the other candidates, well, they weren't even sure what was going on.
[04:50:52.296 --> 04:50:56.359]  Yes, as you can see there, some of the other candidates really, they just were just confused at the whole thing.
[04:50:57.960 --> 04:51:08.187]  But the Democrats decided they were going to continue to try to hoist upon the American people Hillary Clinton, a dead candidate.
[04:51:09.397 --> 04:51:13.579]  Here you can see at the final presidential debate, it could only have been Trump.
[04:51:14.339 --> 04:51:15.760]  There was no other option.
[04:51:18.701 --> 04:51:32.408]  Well, the election night came around and as you can see, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had to take the whining and crying Hillary Clinton off of the flight of American prosperity.
[04:51:33.595 --> 04:51:42.281]  Well, the liberals in Hollywood had to shout at the top of a mountain how it was sexism that brought Hillary down.
[04:51:43.302 --> 04:51:47.405]  But their biggest story was actually Russia.
[04:51:48.465 --> 04:51:56.011]  That's right, all over the news they were bringing on all kinds of pundits to tell us about Trump's Russian ties.
[04:51:57.509 --> 04:51:59.210]  It didn't matter what the story was.
[04:52:00.130 --> 04:52:02.431]  They were going to blame the Democrats.
[04:52:03.131 --> 04:52:04.212]  No matter the story.
[04:52:04.672 --> 04:52:05.532]  No matter the time.
[04:52:06.032 --> 04:52:07.073]  No matter whose fault.
[04:52:08.913 --> 04:52:10.294]  They continued to do this.
[04:52:10.974 --> 04:52:11.834]  No matter what!
[04:52:13.255 --> 04:52:16.676]  Even though it was just like beating a dead horse.
[04:52:17.317 --> 04:52:20.178]  Well, now Obama had to spy on Donald Trump.
[04:52:21.238 --> 04:52:23.439]  Because of the alleged Russian hacking.
[04:52:24.761 --> 04:52:28.702]  So, President Obama and his staff were spying on the President.
[04:52:30.223 --> 04:52:32.283]  This had Kekistan going crazy.
[04:52:33.204 --> 04:52:34.724]  Kekistan could not stand it.
[04:52:35.484 --> 04:52:39.186]  They were all fired up and they were holding meetings to try to make America great again.
[04:52:40.226 --> 04:52:42.266]  This sent the protesters out to the streets.
[04:52:44.047 --> 04:52:49.829]  As you can see, many of the protesters, well, some of their memes don't want to load on us right now.
[04:52:50.029 --> 04:52:50.589]  There we go.
[04:52:51.249 --> 04:52:52.970]  The protesters took to the streets.
[04:52:54.059 --> 04:52:56.821]  They took to the streets in full force, in fact.
[04:52:58.603 --> 04:53:00.644]  And they, well, they got violent.
[04:53:02.766 --> 04:53:03.246]  That's all right.
[04:53:03.266 --> 04:53:04.728]  This is meme story time, folks.
[04:53:05.488 --> 04:53:06.269]  They got violent.
[04:53:06.589 --> 04:53:07.850]  They were stealing signs.
[04:53:08.791 --> 04:53:11.193]  They only liked signs that agreed with their agenda.
[04:53:11.253 --> 04:53:13.495]  If you held up a different sign, they would take it down.
[04:53:14.155 --> 04:53:15.056]  They got violent.
[04:53:15.817 --> 04:53:18.118]  They were burning things, burning buildings.
[04:53:19.600 --> 04:53:20.721]  And, of course, there it is again.
[04:53:20.761 --> 04:53:23.042]  You can see the Democrats here beating the dead horse.
[04:53:23.953 --> 04:53:26.615]  That was the Russian narrative.
[04:53:29.058 --> 04:53:40.568]  So then, all of the sudden, all of the attention was changed as President Trump dropped the mother of all bombs in Afghanistan, changing the focus of attention.
[04:53:41.963 --> 04:53:51.351]  It was then that John McCain and Lindsey Graham finally thought that they were going to get the war that they have always desired.
[04:53:52.011 --> 04:53:59.598]  But then, out of nowhere, it was a Pepsi given to Kim Jong-un.
[04:54:01.104 --> 04:54:03.105]  That brought the people back to reality.
[04:54:03.786 --> 04:54:11.030]  And now, once again in America, as you can see, transgender wins international women's weightlifting title.
[04:54:11.070 --> 04:54:11.891]  That's right, folks.
[04:54:12.131 --> 04:54:17.134]  Once again in America, men can compete with women.
[04:54:17.935 --> 04:54:20.957]  And that is meme story time.
[04:54:22.381 --> 04:54:23.321]  That was pretty good, guys.
[04:54:24.202 --> 04:54:29.724]  We had a couple of hitch-ups, but I would say, for the first meme story time, not bad.
[04:54:30.264 --> 04:54:31.184]  Well done to the crew.
[04:54:32.045 --> 04:54:32.445]  Alright!
[04:54:35.776 --> 04:54:42.039]  I mean, I feel bad because I didn't prepare as much as you did.
[04:54:42.240 --> 04:54:43.600]  I didn't want to put you on the spot.
[04:54:43.900 --> 04:54:45.321]  It was not meant to be that way.
[04:54:45.861 --> 04:54:47.402]  You kind of put me on the spot.
[04:54:47.482 --> 04:54:55.787]  This was like, you know, Oscar-worthy meme story time here, and I have like a PowerPoint slideshow for you.
[04:54:56.027 --> 04:54:58.809]  But, you know, I'll give it my best shot.
[04:54:58.829 --> 04:54:59.869]  We'll give you a handicap.
[04:54:59.949 --> 04:55:01.170]  It's meme magic, baby.
[04:55:03.145 --> 04:55:20.815]  I mean, I just gotta point out, I mean, the fact that we are on the media talking about memes, and yes they're funny, but to say that memes didn't have a huge impact on the 2016 election, you know, you can't argue that fact.
[04:55:21.435 --> 04:55:21.575]  No.
[04:55:21.615 --> 04:55:23.796]  And like you said, it's fun, it's creative, and it brings people together.
[04:55:43.476 --> 04:55:49.680]  You know, you share your rare pepes, you get to talk about how milk is racist with your friends.
[04:55:50.000 --> 04:55:51.682]  Hold on, hold on, wait.
[04:55:52.562 --> 04:55:53.062]  There we go.
[04:55:53.082 --> 04:55:54.403]  Alright.
[04:55:55.824 --> 04:55:56.605]  Had to get that in.
[04:55:56.625 --> 04:55:58.826]  Alright, you ready to go to your memes?
[04:55:58.846 --> 04:56:00.387]  You guys got his memes ready to go?
[04:56:02.369 --> 04:56:06.411]  Yeah, so I'm not sure which ones they have, so I'm just gonna go in the order I see them.
[04:56:08.365 --> 04:56:13.268]  The first meme I have, this is like my top ten that I like right now.
[04:56:13.288 --> 04:56:21.432]  So the first one is, it's the lady at Trump's inauguration just screaming, nooooo!
[04:56:22.293 --> 04:56:23.093]  Have you seen that one?
[04:56:23.793 --> 04:56:28.076]  Is that the girl that's gone totally viral who literally is losing her mind?
[04:56:29.082 --> 04:56:29.822]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:56:29.842 --> 04:56:35.885]  This lady's mind is literally melting while Trump is getting inaugurated.
[04:56:35.945 --> 04:56:37.445]  Just no!
[04:56:37.545 --> 04:56:41.967]  Like, she just cannot believe that she's living on this timeline.
[04:56:43.322 --> 04:56:52.126]  I mean, that to me is a representation of the entire left, that they still cannot accept reality, and they act like little children.
[04:56:52.606 --> 04:56:58.528]  You know, when I didn't vote for Obama, I didn't really like Obama, but I was not screaming like that.
[04:56:58.568 --> 04:57:01.289]  I was not screaming like a child on my knees.
[04:57:01.349 --> 04:57:02.990]  Like, that's sad.
[04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:04.971]  So I like to laugh at that one.
[04:57:05.711 --> 04:57:06.391]  Wait a second.
[04:57:07.311 --> 04:57:10.793]  You're telling me that when you don't get your way, you go, no!
[04:57:15.521 --> 04:57:19.082]  I probably should start doing that.
[04:57:21.603 --> 04:57:24.124]  I should start doing that.
[04:57:24.464 --> 04:57:25.405]  That's what you do, right?
[04:57:25.425 --> 04:57:26.725]  That's what you do.
[04:57:26.745 --> 04:57:28.746]  That's how I got my job here.
[04:57:30.066 --> 04:57:35.131]  You got, I mean, I guess, you know, if you whine very loudly, sometimes you get what you want.
[04:57:35.151 --> 04:57:36.792]  So maybe I should start screaming like that.
[04:57:37.112 --> 04:57:38.634]  Maybe I'd get more things, you know?
[04:57:39.014 --> 04:57:42.437]  But the truth is that you just said it exactly, though.
[04:57:42.477 --> 04:57:44.118]  It's the epitome of the left.
[04:57:44.599 --> 04:57:50.064]  Petulant children who can't accept reality, who whine when they don't get things their way.
[04:57:50.444 --> 04:57:55.448]  See, I'm the type of guy where if I fail at something or I don't accomplish a goal,
[04:57:56.189 --> 04:57:58.190]  I look back and I say, what did I do wrong?
[04:57:58.290 --> 04:57:59.030]  What can I do better?
[04:57:59.090 --> 04:58:00.071]  How can I improve myself?
[04:58:00.111 --> 04:58:01.191]  How can I win next time?
[04:58:01.211 --> 04:58:02.391]  That's not what they do.
[04:58:02.432 --> 04:58:05.473]  They just whine and complain more, because that's how they think they win, I guess.
[04:58:05.513 --> 04:58:06.873]  That's the culture that they were raised in.
[04:58:06.893 --> 04:58:11.815]  You want to fight?
[04:58:12.055 --> 04:58:12.475]  You're getting it!
[04:58:12.495 --> 04:58:13.176]  You're getting it!

[04:59:56.586 --> 05:00:05.375]  It's Thursday, May 4th, 2017, and this is the tail end of our 30-hour broadcast special in defense of free speech.
[05:00:05.756 --> 05:00:16.427]  We had all kinds of great guests on, covering content from all over the geopolitical and social map, and we've got all the highlights from that right here for you tonight.
[05:00:16.747 --> 05:00:20.668]  We want to thank all of those out there who supported us during this 30-hour broadcast.

[05:01:06.445 --> 05:01:11.749]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[05:01:11.929 --> 05:01:12.509]  I take this.
[05:01:12.769 --> 05:01:13.790]  My family takes this.
[05:01:13.890 --> 05:01:18.113]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[05:01:18.173 --> 05:01:22.416]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[05:01:22.756 --> 05:01:27.337]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[05:01:27.417 --> 05:01:28.477]  I don't feel good.
[05:01:28.537 --> 05:01:32.058]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[05:01:32.298 --> 05:01:34.959]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[05:01:34.999 --> 05:01:40.321]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[05:01:40.781 --> 05:01:43.201]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[05:01:43.741 --> 05:01:47.162]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[05:01:47.282 --> 05:01:49.463]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[05:01:49.523 --> 05:01:49.883]  I love it.
[05:01:50.043 --> 05:01:52.646]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[05:01:52.846 --> 05:01:53.827]  Survival Shield X2.
[05:01:53.867 --> 05:01:59.793]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[05:01:59.813 --> 05:02:01.434]  It's got a five-star rating.
[05:02:01.694 --> 05:02:03.897]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:55.149]  I wasn't going to talk about this, because I get attacked a good 50 times a day in print, you know, every day on national news.
[05:02:55.329 --> 05:03:01.711]  But they had this Charlie Worzel guy, or Weasel guy, follow me around the last few months, one of many.
[05:03:02.531 --> 05:03:04.851]  And his article's called, Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones.
[05:03:04.891 --> 05:03:07.172]  I just scanned over this in the last 10 minutes since it came out.
[05:03:07.552 --> 05:03:10.732]  It is literal, literal fiction.
[05:03:10.752 --> 05:03:11.793]  He sent me all these questions.
[05:03:11.833 --> 05:03:18.154]  I refused to answer them today, final questions, because it was all just so much of it just didn't even have anything to do with reality.
[05:03:18.974 --> 05:03:19.695]  And look at this.
[05:03:19.795 --> 05:03:20.975]  I just opened it to page 6.
[05:03:22.256 --> 05:03:25.758]  He just kept saying, oh my God, if Obama loses, we're out of business.
[05:03:27.880 --> 05:03:28.760]  Talking about 2012.
[05:03:28.980 --> 05:03:33.823]  Ladies and gentlemen, they supposedly go talk to former employees.
[05:03:34.124 --> 05:03:37.826]  This is the biggest load of crap the world has ever seen.
[05:03:40.358 --> 05:03:46.670]  It goes on to say, but others close to Jones during that time said that despite a growing audience, the broadcaster was insecure.
[05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:47.551]  Insecure?
[05:03:48.152 --> 05:03:52.641]  Two former colleagues said Jones reserved his greater resentment for Rush Limbaugh.
[05:03:54.116 --> 05:04:01.962]  The jealousy was so intense that Jones began to crib his now famous Crushed Gravel voice from the talk radio legend.
[05:04:02.262 --> 05:04:02.682]  Crib it!
[05:04:03.243 --> 05:04:04.264]  Limbaugh doesn't have a voice like me.
[05:04:04.284 --> 05:04:05.825]  He has a big, booming, sweet voice.
[05:04:06.045 --> 05:04:06.445]  Mine's fry.
[05:04:06.725 --> 05:04:15.031]  Ladies and gentlemen, I spent a quarter million dollars on Rush Limbaugh advertising books and videos and supplements trying to prop him up when they're trying to bring him down.
[05:04:15.472 --> 05:04:18.234]  GCN put me on 18, 19 years ago.
[05:04:18.334 --> 05:04:19.955]  I wanted to be on at night like I was.
[05:04:19.975 --> 05:04:21.376]  They took me off, put me on during the day.
[05:04:21.756 --> 05:04:22.257]  I hated it.
[05:04:23.450 --> 05:04:35.034]  I have, I am not in comp, everyone knows I'm not in competition with anybody except the globalists to stop them and I just open this up and they just have anonymous people, what, and I'm raping, you know, warthogs now?
[05:04:35.414 --> 05:04:37.755]  I mean, I just flipped through it, it's total crap!
[05:04:38.935 --> 05:04:42.056]  Excuse me, and I don't want to talk about myself all day, but God, it's getting crazy.
[05:04:42.737 --> 05:04:46.338]  You know, the nighttime shows, the comedy shows, everything.
[05:04:47.771 --> 05:04:50.433]  Made-for-TV movies, everything, just attacking.
[05:04:50.613 --> 05:04:54.716]  Only X-Files said that they think I'm a good guy and had a good character in the show, they said, based on me.
[05:04:54.736 --> 05:04:57.437]  And I don't want to make it about me, but they are obsessed.
[05:05:01.880 --> 05:05:07.144]  Somebody should be prosecuted for letting Anthony Weiner have access to classified information.
[05:05:07.184 --> 05:05:08.645]  Does that make general sense?
[05:05:09.485 --> 05:05:10.386]  It could be a crime.
[05:05:10.406 --> 05:05:11.286]  It would depend upon what the...
[05:05:16.175 --> 05:05:22.458]  And here's another hypocrite, Comey, nauseous to think FBI impacted presidential election.
[05:05:22.658 --> 05:05:24.479]  Oh, he feels so nauseous about it.
[05:05:24.759 --> 05:05:32.243]  And we got some clips about him complaining and whining to Maxine Waters and Lindsey Graham and all these other turds that are out there trying to run your life.
