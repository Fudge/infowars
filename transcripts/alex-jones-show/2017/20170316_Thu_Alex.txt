[00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.515]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.863]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:20.057]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:22.499]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.142]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:35.187]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:46.358]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:51.459]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.221]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.902]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:05.784]  From the front lines of the Infowar, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:20.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the 16th day of March 2017.
[00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:21.836]  It is Thursday.
[00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:36.045]  We have stories that are so incredible today, that are so amazingly clarifying, it makes my head swim.
[00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.583]  We have footage from Florida.
[00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:40.325]  I saw this yesterday after the show.
[00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.848]  Made phone calls, looked it up, confirmed it really happened.
[00:01:44.008 --> 00:02:00.743]  A congressman goes into the VA, 50 plus days after Trump's in, supposed to be up within a week, and they admit, no, we're not putting up the head of the Veterans Department and the head of the country, Trump, like you're supposed to.
[00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:03.054]  The congressman puts it up.
[00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.198]  A security guard comes over and threatens but then backs off.
[00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:10.423]  Of course the congressman's a veteran who had both his legs blown off at the knees in Afghanistan.
[00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.348]  And they pulled it down the next day.
[00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.110]  It's pulled down.
[00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.231]  So they put it up on
[00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.790]  Tuesday, it was pulled down on Wednesday.
[00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:29.981]  Now Fox News obviously picked it up today and just look, this is the open rebellion of the bureaucracy and the scumbags that have hijacked this country.
[00:02:30.842 --> 00:02:32.985]  Just like this federal judge that came out.
[00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:37.370]  Look, it was iron-tight what happened.
[00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:44.828]  You know, a month ago with his travel ban, a five-year-old could read the law and see the president has way more power than what he even did.
[00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:53.470]  But the Ninth Circuit, the same one that's banned the American flag in schools, and now I guess football games in California, now it's getting banned in Texas, too, because it's offensive.
[00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.931]  Oh, an American flag!
[00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:57.711]  This sounds like a joke, doesn't it?
[00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:01.872]  Trump has come out and said that this is total lawlessness.
[00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:02.973]  In fact, I have the exact quote right here.
[00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:04.433]  We're going to play the video coming up.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.783]  From his latest rally, got a live rally going right now, it's linked on Infowars.com as well.
[00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:15.667]  Judge blocking new immigration order is unprecedented judicial overreach.
[00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:17.768]  That's putting it lightly.
[00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.593]  This is bureaucratic mutiny and it's happening all over where they just ignore what Trump says.
[00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:33.641]  But the thousands of phone calls he's made, thousands a week, quite frankly, hundreds a day, to business owners and foreign corporations and everybody else in the announcement that they're going to
[00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:47.853]  Turned the electricity prices back down through free market and so much more has created in 55 days better numbers than we saw in 1984 and the Reagan recovery that took three years to get launched.
[00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:50.414]  It's unbelievable!
[00:03:51.451 --> 00:04:04.840]  And then there's a paradox, though, of the globalists openly saying they're raising interest rates to stall Trump, that's in the news, and to block America becoming preeminent again, and the American people becoming wealthy again, because the globalists, they have a grand plan and we're not in it.
[00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:12.386]  A middle class, a free country that made us so great, that American reboot, they believe they're going to block.
[00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:19.731]  And so the fight is 5,000 more times electric than when I would go watch Dallas Cowboy games when I was in
[00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:26.556]  Middle school and high school and just thought it was so important that they get that field goal and oh, yeah, they got the field goal.
[00:04:27.177 --> 00:04:28.618]  This really counts folks.
[00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:34.682]  Okay, and I just can't believe more people aren't in the game because this is a game where we're all on the field.
[00:04:35.387 --> 00:04:36.287]  Just got incredible chills.
[00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:38.308]  Wow, it's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:39.308]  This is incredible!
[00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:42.669]  But I gotta tell you, I'm so honored to be at the heart with you.
[00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.451]  The listeners of this broadcast are the true resistance and the real detonator in the American reboot.
[00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:49.331]  That's not talk!
[00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.071]  You need to know what you've done.
[00:04:51.412 --> 00:04:55.053]  You were the detonator that's already shattered the enemy!
[00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:56.393]  They're trying to regroup?
[00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:58.233]  We've gotta press the attack!
[00:04:58.634 --> 00:04:59.754]  Huge news straight ahead!
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.383]  Chris Ruddy got a chance to talk to the President, who he's been friends with for many years, says he was just a real estate mogul, and he can tell us exactly what happened.
[00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:16.204]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.445]  Well, I can't tell you that I know everything that's going on.
[00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.126]  I did meet the President twice on Saturday.
[00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:24.347]  I saw him during the lunch hour, and then at dinner time.
[00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:25.128]  You've met him.
[00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:30.770]  You can tell when he's happy, and I think you can probably pick up when he's not happy, and he didn't seem very happy.
[00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.813]  He seemed to be a little angry about what had happened, and he had tweeted out that morning
[00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:42.957]  Uh, that, uh, Obama had, uh, wiretapped him and surveilled his campaign at Trump Towers.
[00:05:43.738 --> 00:05:48.101]  And he repeated to me, he, he said he knew details of the process of what happened.
[00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:49.822]  He thought it was outrageous.
[00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.964]  It was Watergate-level stuff.
[00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.346]  Uh, it was McCarthyism.
[00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:58.809]  And he wanted to make sure that when we were covering it, the press was covering it.
[00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.650]  Because remember, he just got off the golf course.
[00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.552]  And I said, of course, everybody's talking about it.
[00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:22.550]  And he was not happy and I think it, you know, Obama, I have talked to a lot of people on that Trump campaign and I think there's about a hundred percent consensus of people that worked on that campaign, especially the leadership, that they were surveilled by federal authorities at one point or another.
[00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.252]  Well, I mean, I've rarely seen him angry.
[00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.813]  I mean, there's photos of him coming out of the White House after the argument.
[00:06:28.174 --> 00:06:29.635]  He looks really pissed off.
[00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.996]  We're seeing the angry Donald Trump here.
[00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:33.357]  And I agree with him.
[00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:40.122]  I mean, the Attorney General met as one of the heads of the Armed Services Committee with a Russian twice.
[00:06:40.222 --> 00:06:40.942]  Everybody did that.
[00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:41.643]  Pelosi did.
[00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:42.604]  It's on record.
[00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:44.965]  They asked him if he was involved in the campaign as a surrogate.
[00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:46.887]  If they talked about the campaign, he said no.
[00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:48.848]  So why the hell would he recuse himself?
[00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:54.172]  James Clapper, who was Obama's Chief of National Intelligence, was just on Meet the Press yesterday.
[00:06:54.653 --> 00:07:02.619]  He said they did a massive investigation, they found no evidence, okay, nothing, that showed collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.162]  So why, what is the collusion?
[00:07:06.222 --> 00:07:13.268]  Because Sessions met with the Russian ambassador as an official, as a senator, which is very common at that level.
[00:07:14.048 --> 00:07:20.351]  You know what's even more common is political campaigns meet with foreign diplomats and foreign officials all the time.
[00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:22.472]  Look, I'm for all for investigations.
[00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:23.492]  I'm a member of the press.
[00:07:23.512 --> 00:07:25.653]  I don't care if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:27.874]  Every side should be held accountable.
[00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:35.157]  What I really detest from the media is the fact they only go after Republicans, and they give Democrats a free pass.
[00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:37.498]  I totally agree, and his approval rating is only going up.
[00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:39.079]  I think this is backfiring.
[00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.341]  And Chris Ruddy, CEO and founder of Newsmax.com, I mean, what do you think about this overall climate?
[00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:53.653]  Well, I think it's a difficult climate for the president, but I think the polling numbers, when you have likely voters, it actually comes out pretty good.
[00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:59.477]  Because the public is seeing through some of this, you know, the things that the media is saying, and the Washington establishment.
[00:08:16.887 --> 00:08:21.371]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:28.637]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:35.764]  Every day now is a day long remembered because so much is happening on the side of good and the side of evil.
[00:08:36.144 --> 00:08:39.307]  It's Thursday, already the 16th day of March 2017.
[00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:40.688]  As we move forward into the future.
[00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:49.958]  Well, we have some guests coming up today, and I'll tell you about those a little bit later.
[00:08:50.098 --> 00:08:54.841]  But before I go anywhere, look at the story that is from CNN.
[00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:56.942]  It's one of the top links on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:05.107]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[00:09:05.848 --> 00:09:08.570]  You see, now they're using the proper words.
[00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:10.822]  This is lawyer games.
[00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:22.331]  The New York Times on January 20th, 2017 had the headline that wiretaps picked up Trump officials talking to the Russians.
[00:09:23.953 --> 00:09:36.563]  A wiretap is a 1980s and before term when they would put a tap on the physical copper wire either at the phone switch system or at your house or somewhere in between.
[00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:40.313]  It's digital hubs since then, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:41.194]  Fiber optic.
[00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:48.315]  And they simply redirect that system into a recorded data bank.
[00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:55.616]  Now, they think you're stupid and have no memory.
[00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.536]  Like Gruber said, thank God you're so dumb.
[00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:05.818]  Notice Trump in his latest speech, we're going to play clips of it later, at one of his rallies last night, brought up Gruber.
[00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:12.779]  And said, oh remember Gruber Obamacare, he thinks you're dumb.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.083]  See, Trump's key, he brings up the big...
[00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.391]  At times, they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar.
[00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.533]  He brings up the greatest hints of their corruption, just like we do.
[00:10:23.693 --> 00:10:30.576]  We've got to continue to remember a memory is one of the most important things to be free, to be successful, and to be prosperous.
[00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:34.978]  Everything the globalists do is to annihilate the process of a memory.
[00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:39.460]  The process of learning to train your mind to remember important things.
[00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:46.574]  And it's our job as info warriors, as nationalists, as patriots, to remind folks of that.
[00:10:46.874 --> 00:10:56.180]  And remember, they're playing games now, not just with words, and not just with our memories, but with how they arrange the words.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.582]  Angelina Jolie went to the UN as a UN envoy from the US.
[00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.163]  She needs to be fired from that position.
[00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:05.245]  Her dad's a good guy.
[00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:05.966]  She's a monster.
[00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:09.828]  And said, nationalism can't be confused with patriotism.
[00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:15.013]  Nationalism can't be confused with patriotism, and said it's bad.
[00:11:15.894 --> 00:11:18.555]  Patriotism is nationalism, and she knows that.
[00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:24.899]  But they're turning that into a dirty word, ladies and gentlemen, just like the Ninth Circuit said, you can't have American flags in public schools.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:39.648]  And I saw three articles yesterday, out of three different states, where at football games, basketball games, you name it, people are filing lawsuits, you name it, getting upset, getting angry, demanding that they not see American flags at school events.
[00:11:40.872 --> 00:11:42.093]  That flags be taken down.
[00:11:42.153 --> 00:11:43.453]  I mean, it's just all over the news.
[00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:48.116]  People say, that doesn't make sense.
[00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.316]  You're allowed to have a country.
[00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:58.661]  Oh no, they make it dirty acting like Trump's this weird crazy person that he thinks we should run our own country and shouldn't have some secret TPP negotiated in secret over the last decade.
[00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:04.064]  Part of it written by Hillary Clinton to just suddenly have Obama sign it, Congress can't read it, and then we're under it.
[00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:06.705]  Trump said, I use your false executive order to
[00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:12.425]  Destroy the treaty, pull out of the treaty, and send it back to Congress where treaties were supposed to go.
[00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.105]  A devastating victory.
[00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:16.426]  And let's remember what he did the first two days in office.
[00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:17.506]  But let's go to this article.
[00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:24.008]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:30.111]  Headline should be, House Committee Returns to Reality.
[00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:33.952]  Admits Trump was being surveilled.
[00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:39.052]  But CNN gives you this dry, no big deal headline like, huh?
[00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:40.773]  See, it's not called wiretapping.
[00:12:40.813 --> 00:12:41.794]  It's called surveillance.
[00:12:41.854 --> 00:12:42.975]  It's called intercepts.
[00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:46.478]  It's called data going through the big hubs being recorded.
[00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:48.799]  Everything the president does is recorded.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.123]  Everything the incoming president does, president-elect does is recorded.
[00:12:53.503 --> 00:12:55.845]  Every foreign phone call is publicly recorded.
[00:12:55.945 --> 00:12:59.450]  Recorded and analyzed by 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:07.040]  It is absolutely hardwired into the system, incontrovertible, like the sun rising and setting.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.040]  100%!
[00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:10.765]  Undebatable!
[00:13:10.845 --> 00:13:12.988]  It's like debating that the color red isn't red.
[00:13:16.576 --> 00:13:17.336]  It's just crazy.
[00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:19.177]  So, remember the New York Times?
[00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:23.319]  January 20th, Roger Stone, Manafort, all of them are Russian agents.
[00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:24.579]  We've got the intercepts.
[00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:25.740]  We've got the wiretaps.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.660]  And we've got the transcripts.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.461]  We've got the total proof.
[00:13:29.304 --> 00:13:32.726]  And then everybody's like Manafort and Stoner, like, we never talk to the Russians about stuff.
[00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:34.066]  What are you talking about?
[00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:35.487]  Release it then!
[00:13:35.787 --> 00:13:36.927]  I want to go before the Senate Committee.
[00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:38.148]  Oh, here's some polonium.
[00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:46.231]  Oh, here, let us T-bone your car so you can be dead when we have the event and claim that, you know, the hearing and claim that you're this Russian agent.
[00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:47.832]  But here it is.
[00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:53.875]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.296]  They're all recorded.
[00:13:57.739 --> 00:14:05.862]  But they're supposed to, with the digital systems, block out the name on the file of the audio file or video file, depending on what it is.
[00:14:07.123 --> 00:14:07.743]  This is law.
[00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:09.444]  When it's the president...
[00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:18.535]  And it's picked up at other intercepts or top officials carrying out lawful duties of the United States because you're not supposed to be surveilling the internal people in the U.S.
[00:14:18.555 --> 00:14:19.216]  without a warrant.
[00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:21.758]  But if it's overseas, they claim no warrant needed.
[00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:27.663]  So they spy overseas at the big British NSA hub there in England.
[00:14:28.524 --> 00:14:29.346]  One of the biggest in the world.
[00:14:29.746 --> 00:14:37.481]  They pass it all back to Obama, who circumvented the chain of command so that he himself could have all the data and pass it on to the DNC.
[00:14:38.262 --> 00:14:40.847]  And then the New York Times brags about it, has leaked the info.
[00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:51.772]  And then has the nerve to come out and say, Trump's insane, there were never any wiretaps when their own headlines, the Washington Post's own headlines, CNN's own headlines, all of a sudden.
[00:14:51.952 --> 00:15:00.419]  And I know you know this, but for me, it's crazy to watch Congress go along with this and say, we're going to have investigations, Trump has no proof.
[00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:01.399]  That's what McCain says.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:08.265]  When the House Intelligence Committee head said, no, we've got all the intercepts, we've got all the recordings, we've got all the transcripts, everything, and there's nothing there.
[00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:10.746]  They're not talking to Russians until Flynn
[00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:16.705]  December 15th is told, line up phone calls for the President-elect to talk to the Russians.
[00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:17.686]  Remember?
[00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:18.726]  They're in the news.
[00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:21.987]  Trump said, I'm going to be talking to Putin in the next two weeks.
[00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.147]  It was being set up.
[00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:24.287]  That's normal!
[00:15:24.687 --> 00:15:27.148]  The President's allowed to talk to whoever he wants to!
[00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.889]  But McCain thinks you're an idiot.
[00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:33.505]  McCain thinks you're a moron.
[00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:41.073]  He can meet with the Russian ambassador whenever he wants, but Senator Sessions can't, even though he was higher ranking on the Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee.
[00:15:41.294 --> 00:15:41.794]  So here it is.
[00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:48.782]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[00:15:49.643 --> 00:15:50.984]  Unmasking is what it's called.
[00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:52.106]  That's unmasking
[00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:55.183]  Of the surveillance!
[00:15:55.643 --> 00:15:57.244]  Surveillance!
[00:15:57.724 --> 00:16:00.245]  Surveillance, Rachel Maddow!
[00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.966]  Surveillance!
[00:16:03.367 --> 00:16:05.108]  Glenn Beck saying that none of this happened.
[00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:09.670]  All of you, neocons and neolibs, you're disgusting, and you've been caught again.
[00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.573]  Because anybody that knows how this works, what's even declassified for decades, knows the process!
[00:16:15.113 --> 00:16:16.574]  It's all in stone!
[00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:37.070]  Now, the big news that ties into this, and I'm getting into all the other news, and it's massive, is that yesterday, the full clips on InfoWars.com, John McCain went into the Senate to try to bypass rules if no one objected.
[00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.771]  That's how they got the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, and the income tax in 1913, and other stuff.
[00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:42.752]  Remember three senators?
[00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:44.992]  On December 23rd, everybody was gone for Christmas.
[00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:49.313]  They came and said no one objected, so then they passed it, because they were the chairman of the committees.
[00:16:50.757 --> 00:16:51.179]  Same deal.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.950]  McCain sneaks into the Senate.
[00:16:57.165 --> 00:17:03.149]  And of course, Paul's gotta have people constantly watching C-SPAN, constantly having his aides watching, and say, sure, sure, sure!
[00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:11.855]  That's why all the time you get congressmen or senators on, they've gotta run, especially if they're high-ranking, because they've gotta go vote or object to what's being rammed through.
[00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:16.438]  So, McCain runs in with a treaty that openly sends in billions of weapons and U.S.
[00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:24.463]  troops, and declares that NATO will attack Russia if it continues to be in Ukraine, which has been Russian for 500 years, and reportedly is pretty much where Russia started.
[00:17:24.483 --> 00:17:26.685]  I mean, it's undoubtedly Russian, okay?
[00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:28.787]  Ukraine's gone back and forth.
[00:17:28.807 --> 00:17:32.711]  The other part's more Germanic and they've always been killing each other and it's two different tribes.
[00:17:34.013 --> 00:17:35.274]  The Germans split it in two.
[00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.215]  The Russians split it in two.
[00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:37.416]  It's been going on for hundreds of years.
[00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:40.700]  He knows you're ignorant or he thinks you're ignorant.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.142]  He knows his constituents are.
[00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:43.784]  And so he runs in
[00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:50.268]  And you can tell in the body language, if you're watching the video at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we're about to play it.
[00:17:50.288 --> 00:17:51.950]  I can replay the whole clip right now.
[00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:56.955]  He gets angry and says, Oh, if you object, it means you're working for the Russians.
[00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:01.139]  If you object, it really, really shows who you are.
[00:18:03.381 --> 00:18:03.642]  And then.
[00:18:05.273 --> 00:18:13.041]  Senator Paul just simply says, yes, yes, I object to you just passing this through without having a full hearing or, you know, full committee so it could then go to a full vote.
[00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:15.403]  We're going to have some due process here, McCain.
[00:18:15.763 --> 00:18:16.905]  And McCain goes, that's it!
[00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:17.926]  Respond!
[00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:18.606]  Respond!
[00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:25.313]  The fact that you won't defend it because Rand Paul's walking out shows that you are an agent of Putin and work for him.
[00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.455]  He actually says, you work for Putin at the end.
[00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:28.997]  It's incredible.
[00:18:29.844 --> 00:18:37.787]  When if you watch C-SPAN, you know full well, constantly for hours, especially when a lot of lawmaking's going on, is this person will pop up, if no one objects, if no one objects, slips through.
[00:18:38.107 --> 00:18:40.508]  Or I object, I object, and we'll have little debates about it sometimes.
[00:18:40.748 --> 00:18:46.670]  But most of the time, if you're busy, like Rand Paul is a professional doctor, into screwing around, and he is very effective.
[00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.392]  Not at his rhetoric so much, but what he gets done, he's one of the best senators we've seen in decades.
[00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:52.513]  And a patriot.
[00:18:52.853 --> 00:18:53.213]  Amazing.
[00:18:53.273 --> 00:18:54.653]  I wish he was part of the administration.
[00:18:54.973 --> 00:18:55.794]  But the point is,
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:58.775]  They're starting to get a little bit closer to each other, so that's good.
[00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:00.855]  These are allies made for each other.
[00:19:01.095 --> 00:19:02.396]  They both lead the Liberty Movement.
[00:19:02.436 --> 00:19:03.076]  We need them.
[00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:04.317]  And so that's starting to happen.
[00:19:04.337 --> 00:19:04.777]  Skip the break.
[00:19:06.257 --> 00:19:07.618]  Skip this break for a new listener.
[00:19:07.638 --> 00:19:08.138]  I skip a lot of breaks.
[00:19:08.158 --> 00:19:08.578]  I can't help it.
[00:19:09.659 --> 00:19:12.600]  And those are network breaks, not the local station breaks.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.520]  They get their sponsorship.
[00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:20.191]  But expanding on this, this is a whole new level of deception.
[00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:21.712]  Everything McCain says is a lie.
[00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:27.496]  Oh, this is just a thing to be nice to Ukraine and help it and it got attacked and it's terrible and blah blah blah.
[00:19:29.338 --> 00:19:31.319]  George Soros funded billions.
[00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.041]  The State Department funded five billion.
[00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:39.566]  We have powers in all of them at the State Department bragging three years ago that they overthrew Ukraine and the elected government.
[00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:54.985]  Burned down large parts of cities, started a civil war, started pressing towards the Russian border, and the Russians did send in humanitarian and military for a small area to secure their pipeline that goes out to the Black Sea and out to some other facilities.
[00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:59.710]  And then they say, I'm a Russian agent because I know the facts and researched it.
[00:19:59.770 --> 00:19:59.870]  No.
[00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:27.179]  Rand Paul understands this is an act of war on Russia's doorstep when George Soros and John McCain and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and the normal, usual suspects that funded Al Qaeda, funded ISIS, went and met with the groups, destabilized the Middle East, Africa, blew up Libya, blew up Egypt, a huge civil war, hundreds of thousands dead in Syria.
[00:20:28.473 --> 00:20:29.994]  They're now trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:32.056]  McCain has always said he wants a war with Russia.
[00:20:32.077 --> 00:20:33.458]  This is his big Nebrasky plan.
[00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:34.519]  It's totally insane.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.641]  It's totally out of control.
[00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:39.544]  Russia is not expansionist.
[00:20:39.744 --> 00:20:40.685]  It's China that is.
[00:20:40.885 --> 00:20:46.651]  It's openly threatening to nuke the United States three times so far this week in official government announcements.
[00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:49.407]  They're threatening to nuke our aircraft carriers.
[00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.310]  They're threatening to blow up South Korea.
[00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:59.460]  Kim Jong Un is firing missiles that crash right off the coast of Japan, threatening to nuke Tokyo with, what is it, 20 million people?
[00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:04.066]  And then...
[00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:15.657]  Senator Paul runs in to block it so that he just can't bring it to a full vote without debate and committee hearings with his known warmongering treaty that starts war with Russia.
[00:21:16.197 --> 00:21:17.878]  It's basically a declaration of war with Russia.
[00:21:18.018 --> 00:21:20.940]  That's what Republican analysts, Democratic analysts have all said.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.681]  It's the closest to World War III we've ever been if this happens.
[00:21:24.762 --> 00:21:30.565]  This isn't like the Russians moving missiles into Cuba because we move missiles, you know, nukes, medium-range nukes into Turkey.
[00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:32.226]  This is right up on the border, folks.
[00:21:34.997 --> 00:21:36.477]  And Russia has said it's a red line.
[00:21:37.178 --> 00:21:51.761]  And so, here comes Senator Paul, and this monster, John McCain, has the nerve, the anti-gun, open borders, piece of trash, has the nerve to then call him an agent of Putin at the end.
[00:21:52.081 --> 00:21:58.282]  He goes from saying, don't be manipulated, don't work for Putin, you know, don't help Putin, and then he finally says, oh that's it!
[00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:00.923]  You didn't debate me, you scurried off!
[00:22:01.952 --> 00:22:10.401]  Knowing that when they play that on the news, the general public doesn't watch C-SPAN and doesn't know how, especially in the Senate, those guys are playing games all the time.
[00:22:10.782 --> 00:22:12.524]  It's just like a football game or a chess game.
[00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:18.190]  If somebody isn't looking, you can carry the ball across if you're a senior member of the Senate like John McCain is.
[00:22:20.694 --> 00:22:25.020]  And most of the Senators, again, are lazy and won't actually be up there 18 hours a day.
[00:22:25.341 --> 00:22:34.133]  Rand Paul is routinely up there when stuff's going on, 18 hours a day, like a doctor, professionally in there with his patient, the country, trying to save it.
[00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:34.954]  Literally.
[00:22:35.842 --> 00:22:37.783]  In there just battling, battling, battling.
[00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:40.925]  He sees that patient, blocks McCain, leaves.
[00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:43.767]  McCain acts like he's a coward and is a Russian agent.
[00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:52.372]  This is such an escalation I cannot describe in words how dangerous this is and how unhinged McCain is and how pissed he is that he's not getting his war with Russia.
[00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.333]  But he's been going to Ukraine trying to start a war.
[00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:57.355]  Remember just two weeks ago?
[00:22:58.786 --> 00:23:04.592]  He got chumped when famous Ukrainian pranksters called him and pretended to be the Prime Minister of Ukraine.
[00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:08.156]  And there's McCain on tape saying, yeah, we want to start a war.
[00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:10.098]  We want to attack the Russians for you right now.
[00:23:10.418 --> 00:23:11.820]  I'm trying to get troops in there right now.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.102]  I'm trying to get President Trump, you know, to go along with this.
[00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:14.983]  But who knows what he'll do?
[00:23:15.003 --> 00:23:16.605]  It's like a 10-minute conversation.
[00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:17.506]  You can go listen to the whole thing.
[00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:18.727]  It's John McCain.
[00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:19.268]  He admits it's him.
[00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:21.359]  He's crazy.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.740]  Completely out of his mind.
[00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:28.644]  He just a month ago came scurrying back from Syria because Trump is blowing up the ISIS Al Qaeda forces.
[00:23:29.064 --> 00:23:31.846]  He ran to meet with them and promised them to hold on.
[00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:33.407]  We're going to try to block this.
[00:23:33.908 --> 00:23:36.589]  I mean, the guy is like a super villain.
[00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.751]  He is a super villain.
[00:23:40.521 --> 00:23:43.183]  I think he's so crazy, he actually believes he's helping this country.
[00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:44.163]  He's nuts.
[00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:45.544]  He's nuts.
[00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:49.547]  Him and him and him and Lindsey Graham are reportedly blackmailed too.
[00:23:49.647 --> 00:23:50.987]  I mean, they're just super dangerous.
[00:23:51.468 --> 00:23:56.251]  And let me tell you, if they get in control of this country, people like Trump and myself and others are in deep trouble.
[00:23:56.531 --> 00:23:58.172]  Let me tell you, McCain isn't playing games.
[00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:04.676]  If I've got to point fingers at somebody that I think is behind the 50-plus dead Russians and these black ops squads around the world and rogue groups,
[00:24:05.616 --> 00:24:08.299]  John McCain's you point the finger at because he said he wants war with Russia.
[00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:16.788]  He wants covert action and he's involved in all sorts of deep state stuff and President Trump knows John McCain is the main enemy of this country right now.
[00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:22.862]  President Trump knows it's not Soros, it's not Hillary anymore, it's John McCain.
[00:24:23.823 --> 00:24:24.904]  John McCain.
[00:24:25.384 --> 00:24:26.465]  Next is Paul Ryan.
[00:24:26.825 --> 00:24:41.135]  And notice, it's his own stinking, traitorous, disgusting party that has this big screw job, you know, of the so-called Obamacare fix, that they know Trump's stuck between a rock and a hard place, because if they don't do this, it'll implode the whole economy, because Obamacare is even worse and designed to do that.
[00:24:42.435 --> 00:24:45.778]  But if he doesn't, then he'll be blamed for not repealing it, and he may not have the votes.
[00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:48.375]  So is Trump right or is he wrong?
[00:24:49.635 --> 00:24:56.457]  I think he rallies the troops and gets with Senator Paul and we kill the whole thing lock, stock and barrel.
[00:24:58.257 --> 00:25:04.198]  But right now, let's go to this unprecedented John McCain yesterday in the Senate.
[00:25:04.238 --> 00:25:05.218]  Yesterday evening, here it is.
[00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:15.260]  Mr. President, if there is objection, and I note the Senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this, if there is objection,
[00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.907]  You are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.
[00:25:19.627 --> 00:25:27.610]  You're achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small country that has already been the subject of attempt to- You overthrew it!
[00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.331]  I have no idea- They started it!
[00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:41.736]  Why anyone would object to this, except that I will say, if they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.
[00:25:43.624 --> 00:25:47.967]  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that... Mr. President?
[00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.089]  Is the Senator from Kentucky?
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.130]  I object.
[00:25:53.491 --> 00:25:54.231]  Objection is heard.
[00:25:54.251 --> 00:26:02.657]  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Kentucky leaving the floor... The place is empty.
[00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:04.318]  He sneaks in to do this.
[00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:06.540]  The Senator runs in.
[00:26:08.362 --> 00:26:10.764]  Defeats it, leaves, and again he calls him a coward.
[00:26:10.804 --> 00:26:13.606]  And remember, they're having a meeting to add Montenegro into NATO.
[00:26:15.567 --> 00:26:26.495]  And basically what this new treaty will do, that he's trying to pass through, would have 80% of Ukraine that the Russians aren't in, just handed into NATO, so NATO could then come in and have a war with Russia.
[00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:33.480]  And McCain says he wants to go kick Russia out of Eastern Ukraine.
[00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:40.049]  I mean, it's just totally insane, because that's been part of Russia for 500 years, off and on.
[00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.011]  So, let's go back to the amazing clip.
[00:26:48.112 --> 00:26:58.361]  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Kentucky leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action that he has just taken.
[00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:01.243]  That is really remarkable.
[00:27:01.463 --> 00:27:01.924]  Good policy.
[00:27:02.244 --> 00:27:03.185]  Back it up ten seconds.
[00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:07.388]  Again, stunt after stunt after stunt after stunt.
[00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:09.130]  That's totally normal.
[00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.531]  He's been in the Senate for 20 plus years or longer.
[00:27:11.571 --> 00:27:12.732]  McCain knows how this works.
[00:27:12.752 --> 00:27:13.832]  He sees that every day.
[00:27:13.852 --> 00:27:15.093]  Oh my gosh!
[00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.033]  He just ran out of here!
[00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.174]  He won't even defend it!
[00:27:17.574 --> 00:27:18.135]  Unbelievable!
[00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:19.775]  Trying again to manipulate the audience.
[00:27:19.795 --> 00:27:20.496]  Let's go back to the club.
[00:27:22.537 --> 00:27:30.041]  Leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action that he has just taken.
[00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:32.923]  That is really remarkable.
[00:27:33.923 --> 00:27:36.905]  That a senator blocking a treaty
[00:27:37.984 --> 00:27:50.127]  That is supported by the overwhelming number, perhaps 98 at least, of his colleagues would come to the floor and object and walk away.
[00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:51.507]  And walk away.
[00:27:52.448 --> 00:27:57.769]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[00:27:58.229 --> 00:28:05.271]  He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation
[00:28:06.385 --> 00:28:06.885]  That's not true.
[00:28:06.945 --> 00:28:12.069]  Not having war with Russia after you and Soros and Obama overturned an elected government
[00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:37.734]  Grabbed all the oil fields and gas fields, hogged it all, let Senator Biden, Vice President Biden's son, take over the biggest gas company and keep it for himself.
[00:28:37.814 --> 00:28:39.115]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:28:41.256 --> 00:28:41.976]  But it is McCain.
[00:28:43.397 --> 00:28:45.778]  The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Putin.
[00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:46.278]  You hear that?
[00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:54.641]  And in a two-minute clip, he goes from saying, you're now going along with the wishes and goals of Putin, to you're working for him, see?
[00:28:54.861 --> 00:29:16.469]  And now, the President's working for him, I'm working for him, we're all working for Putin, because we don't want to work with the Nazi collaborator who tried to crash the pound, who's tried to crash our dollar, who's trying to cause wars, who funded the Arab Spring to put radical jihadis in 30-plus countries now, and because we don't want to go into Crimea and start a war with Russia,
[00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:20.022]  We're all... See, we're not Americans.
[00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:21.242]  We don't have birthrights.
[00:29:21.462 --> 00:29:22.683]  We don't care about the country.
[00:29:22.863 --> 00:29:23.823]  We don't want to make it great.
[00:29:23.923 --> 00:29:25.004]  We're all Russians.
[00:29:25.544 --> 00:29:31.906]  No, you're an agent of Al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and the Communist Chinese, and you want to get us pinned down and protracted.
[00:29:32.326 --> 00:29:33.387]  Crisis in the East.
[00:29:33.487 --> 00:29:35.307]  You are a traitor, John McCain.
[00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.408]  You are a Communist Chinese agent.
[00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.870]  Who covered for Hillary and all the stuff she did.
[00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.090]  You're part of the Keating Five.
[00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.932]  You're part of a crime network that is bringing this country down.
[00:29:44.112 --> 00:29:50.016]  You're a communist, Chinese, globalist agent and need to be arrested for high treason by President Trump.
[00:29:52.077 --> 00:29:52.978]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.079]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.682]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:12.341]  Well, it looks like even the establishment mainstream media has to admit that Rachel Maddow's Trump tax scandal is a big nothing burger.
[00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:19.645]  If all we get tonight is that Donald Trump paid 38 million dollars to America's government, that's a good night for Donald Trump.
[00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:20.366]  I'm sorry!
[00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:25.969]  There's just really no way, like I was hoping and praying that it would show, not only did he pay no taxes,
[00:30:26.109 --> 00:30:28.530]  He actually charged the government and got money back!
[00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:43.073]  Sorry to disappoint you, Van Jones, but what you liberals thought was going to be a huge Trump scandal ended up being a big boost to President Donald Trump's reputation as a successful, hard-working American and tax-paying businessman.
[00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:47.814]  And now we know that Trump actually paid a high tax rate of roughly 25%.
[00:30:47.954 --> 00:30:53.315]  Compare that to MSNBC's parent company, Comcast, which paid 24%, Barack Obama, 19%, and Bernie Sanders,
[00:30:55.816 --> 00:30:57.918]  Only paid 18% in taxes.
[00:30:58.098 --> 00:30:59.499]  Read them in weeks, snowflakes.
[00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:02.061]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.874 --> 00:31:05.215]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:10.258]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:31:10.699 --> 00:31:13.621]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:19.264]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:28.310]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.634]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:31:33.894 --> 00:31:40.576]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[00:31:40.876 --> 00:31:45.457]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:31:45.597 --> 00:31:48.758]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:31:48.898 --> 00:31:50.799]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[00:32:03.058 --> 00:32:12.083]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:12.143 --> 00:32:20.247]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:20.547 --> 00:32:25.249]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:32.132]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:32.212 --> 00:32:39.294]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:46.257]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:50.762]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:54.165]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:54.286 --> 00:33:00.432]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:02.254]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:33:13.607 --> 00:33:17.730]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:19.751]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.938 --> 00:33:49.200]  Oh yeah, my friends, some heads are gonna roll.
[00:33:51.182 --> 00:33:59.149]  So, John McCain, the globalist, the guy that got us into NAFTA and GATT and wants your guns and wants open borders and the TPP and doesn't want the public to be able to see it.
[00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:04.587]  And wants the EU to expand all through the border countries of Russia.
[00:34:04.607 --> 00:34:09.089]  And is funding the radical jihadis and actually meeting with Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra.
[00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:16.751]  Leaders that launched a civil war that killed 300,000 plus mainly Christians and non-radical Muslims in Syria.
[00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:21.233]  While he says that Senator Rand Paul now...
[00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:24.986]  Is working directly for Putin.
[00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:27.146]  What an incredible statement.
[00:34:27.486 --> 00:34:32.647]  And by the way, they have rules in the Senate about what you're allowed to say to other Senators that's even stronger in the House.
[00:34:32.907 --> 00:34:36.548]  There should be massive censure of John McCain.
[00:34:36.588 --> 00:34:42.469]  But he's a spoiled thug who's allowed to rip people off and stock scams 30 years ago.
[00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.850]  He's been involved with the missile secrets to Communist China.
[00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.091]  Every dirty sellout of the country.
[00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:49.051]  That monster.
[00:34:50.168 --> 00:34:57.795]  And his monster Democrat wife and his monster Democrat family have just been there wrecking this country as traitors from day one.
[00:34:59.656 --> 00:35:06.983]  And in the Hanoi Hilton, it's well documented, he turned on everybody day one, gave them all the codes, ratted everybody out, they call him a hero.
[00:35:07.023 --> 00:35:07.643]  He's no hero.
[00:35:07.844 --> 00:35:09.825]  People that were there call him a traitor.
[00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:10.906]  That's right.
[00:35:11.807 --> 00:35:12.968]  Hanoi McCain.
[00:35:15.651 --> 00:35:17.092]  Hanoi Hilton McCain.
[00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:25.141]  I've got a lot of other news I want to get to that's really important, but let's play that clip you just joined us one more time.
[00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:27.426]  They start the war in Ukraine.
[00:35:28.147 --> 00:35:30.051]  They know half the population or more is Russian.
[00:35:31.499 --> 00:35:43.184]  They overthrow the government, they try to drive the Russians out, they start ethnic cleansing, the Russians come in to protect their infrastructure and people, and then McCain runs around thinking, you're dumb, and says Putin did it.
[00:35:43.544 --> 00:35:53.329]  And now because our own military and anybody that's a thinking person doesn't want to start a war with Russia, when they're not expanding, House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials
[00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:58.834]  Who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[00:35:59.014 --> 00:36:01.636]  Oh, Trump was under surveillance and Obama ordered it.
[00:36:01.696 --> 00:36:04.938]  That's already known, but they think you're dumb and say, again, Trump's crazy.
[00:36:06.459 --> 00:36:09.461]  But here is John McCain, enemy number one of this country right now.
[00:36:09.822 --> 00:36:10.462]  Enemy number one.
[00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:10.962]  He's the one.
[00:36:11.283 --> 00:36:12.584]  He's the tip of the spear against our heart.
[00:36:13.184 --> 00:36:15.245]  Against our republic returning right now.
[00:36:15.285 --> 00:36:17.467]  He's the face of SORON.
[00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:18.528]  Here he is.
[00:36:19.462 --> 00:36:24.786]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[00:36:25.227 --> 00:36:36.436]  He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians.
[00:36:36.856 --> 00:36:37.777]  So I repeat again.
[00:36:38.717 --> 00:36:42.499]  The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[00:36:43.339 --> 00:36:44.560]  Wow, let's translate that.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.281]  I'm a piece of garbage who thinks I'm invincible.
[00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:55.385]  I've been in power so long, I'm like the VA employees in Florida who 50-something days later wouldn't put up the president's new picture.
[00:36:55.425 --> 00:36:56.406]  It's normally done within days.
[00:36:57.492 --> 00:37:01.556]  And then the congressman came and put it up himself, both his legs blown off in Afghanistan.
[00:37:01.977 --> 00:37:06.601]  They take it down right after he leaves and brag about it and tweet that he's not their president.
[00:37:07.102 --> 00:37:09.144]  Open arrogance by these dirtbags.
[00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:11.547]  VA Hospital refuses to hang photo of President.
[00:37:11.887 --> 00:37:14.369]  Army Ranger Congressman makes on-the-spot correction.
[00:37:15.911 --> 00:37:17.393]  It's now been removed.
[00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:20.376]  As of today, we have an article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.811]  No wonder they won't give you health care.
[00:37:23.831 --> 00:37:34.238]  No wonder, because, I mean, literally, you see some 400-pound security guard just saying, come over to the congressman and start getting in their face saying you can't hang that.
[00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.178]  They say, yeah, we are.
[00:37:35.258 --> 00:37:35.639]  They leave.
[00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:36.239]  They take it down.
[00:37:36.259 --> 00:37:39.701]  And they're not going to put one up until they're all fired.
[00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:43.944]  The leadership at that facility needs to have their asses handed to them today.
[00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:51.904]  The Vice President's the one that should handle it, with the head of Veterans Affairs, who they wouldn't hang his picture up either.
[00:37:52.064 --> 00:38:00.295]  They need to march their butts in there, and call them in there, and shoo them out, and say, who's behind this, and fire it out, and say, you're fired!
[00:38:00.435 --> 00:38:02.517]  And your name's being put out in the news!
[00:38:04.127 --> 00:38:05.048]  Bunch of bullies!
[00:38:05.708 --> 00:38:06.368]  Sick of these people.
[00:38:06.568 --> 00:38:12.932]  They all, oh, oh, Snoop Dogg's nephew says he wants to kidnap Melania and put her into sex slavery.
[00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:18.075]  And the media's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it's cool, it's liberal, you know, sex slavery, like Islam.
[00:38:19.316 --> 00:38:20.076]  Bow wow.
[00:38:22.577 --> 00:38:24.799]  Bow wow needs to take a bow.
[00:38:26.323 --> 00:38:27.423]  Where'd Bow Wow go?
[00:38:27.443 --> 00:38:29.704]  Bow Wow fell down!
[00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:33.945]  Bow Wow wanted to talk about kidnapping women and putting them into sex slavery.
[00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:37.506]  His uncle wants to talk about killing Trump and trying to organize it.
[00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:40.146]  Oh, look what happened to Bow Wow's uncle!
[00:38:40.346 --> 00:38:42.887]  He's so tough, he walks around and says he's a crip.
[00:38:43.107 --> 00:38:44.487]  We're so scared!
[00:38:44.847 --> 00:38:46.908]  We're so scared of you, Snoop!
[00:38:54.628 --> 00:38:58.109]  Oh, Michael Savage got attacked, beat up in front of witnesses, his dog attacked.
[00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:08.233]  He was on the news, TMZ confirmed it, but the national media said pro-Trump radio host Michael Savage claims he was assaulted while having dinner with his toy poodle.
[00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:10.153]  Oh, and Trump claims he's the president too.
[00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:11.334]  They're saying he didn't really get elected.
[00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:18.616]  TMZ called it a melee, but admitted he was attacked and his dog attacked.
[00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:20.545]  Our article got it right.
[00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:23.687]  Michael Savage attacked during dinner outing for supporting Trump.
[00:39:24.067 --> 00:39:26.388]  Anti-Trump lunatic assaults radio hosts.
[00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:33.490]  Because they're a bunch of cowards and fools and wannabe gang members.
[00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.131]  And I mean black, white, old, young.
[00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:36.371]  It's a gang.
[00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:37.452]  It's a cult like the Nazis.
[00:39:39.572 --> 00:39:39.993]  Incredible.
[00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:42.113]  And of course, he was on that very day with us.
[00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:43.374]  Top link on Drudge.
[00:39:44.554 --> 00:39:46.375]  Millions of people read about it, saw the videos.
[00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:50.653]  And they came in sort of screaming, you support Trump, you support Trump.
[00:39:50.693 --> 00:39:54.217]  And then reportedly multiple people got involved attacking him when Savage fought back.
[00:39:54.237 --> 00:39:59.142]  Because see, Savage doesn't have a right to go in the restaurant and eat dinner.
[00:40:02.565 --> 00:40:03.326]  I've had him come over to me.
[00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:08.822]  One guy slapped me on the back of the head thinking he was going to set me up in a fight, and I said, oh, you're really tough.
[00:40:09.322 --> 00:40:12.264]  Had people knock my drink over and go, boo, boo, boo!
[00:40:12.284 --> 00:40:13.625]  He's somebody on video and I'm in D.C.
[00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:14.866]  Boo, boo, boo!
[00:40:15.247 --> 00:40:15.907]  You know, fascist!
[00:40:15.967 --> 00:40:17.148]  Oh, you know the word fascist?
[00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:17.608]  Boo!
[00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:18.649]  Like booing at me.
[00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:19.890]  Oh my God, I'm going to give up!
[00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.791]  You booed at me!
[00:40:20.811 --> 00:40:24.574]  Oh my gosh, you booed!
[00:40:25.114 --> 00:40:27.055]  I mean, Google just took our advertising away.
[00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.136]  That's 3.3 million last year in money we brought in.
[00:40:31.156 --> 00:40:33.481]  It's going to be about 5 million this year.
[00:40:33.501 --> 00:40:36.767]  I mean, if they blew up 5 million in money we were going to bring in...
[00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:40.728]  That's a king's ransom.
[00:40:40.808 --> 00:40:41.768]  I don't even care.
[00:40:42.188 --> 00:40:42.468]  Good.
[00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:46.811]  Everybody's segwaying away from Google Advertising now, and I already learned that censorship was happening.
[00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:48.612]  People are exiting to systems that are even better.
[00:40:49.212 --> 00:40:55.275]  They all will destroy themselves by censoring us, but we're going to be there every step of the way, using their platforms to reach the people with the truth.
[00:40:56.056 --> 00:41:01.579]  We're going to use their systems to reach out to the zombies and unlock their minds to the big war that's happening.
[00:41:02.039 --> 00:41:03.020]  Because history's happening!
[00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:13.732]  Globalism is a complete and utter wicked anti-human monopoly system, and if folks knew the facts, there's no way anybody would be on the side of the globalists.
[00:41:14.212 --> 00:41:15.874]  But they've got dumbed down people, folks.
[00:41:16.514 --> 00:41:24.580]  After Saturday Night Live came out Saturday, and said that I was deeply racist and all this crap, I saw it all over the web suddenly.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.622]  Why doesn't Alex Jones like black people?
[00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:30.584]  Why doesn't he think Denzel Washington's as good as him?
[00:41:30.745 --> 00:41:30.945]  What?
[00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:38.473]  But see, delusionoids think if Alec Baldwin says Alex Jones said that, it must be true.
[00:41:40.073 --> 00:41:46.096]  Or if the Homeland character, who they admit is supposedly me, says the stuff I say and then adds lies to it, it must be true.
[00:41:46.336 --> 00:41:55.160]  This is the total reprobate, bottomless, corrupt evil of these people and they're preying on the dumbest zombies out there.
[00:41:56.254 --> 00:41:57.995]  Can you imagine being so disconnected from reality?
[00:41:58.316 --> 00:42:03.160]  You go, I'd like to kidnap the first lady and put her into sex slavery and make her work for me.
[00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:13.248]  And then Viacom force-feeds that to young people and young women and liberals think radical Islam and gangster rap enslaving women.
[00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:21.334]  So there, you know, been ten men a day in the dirty mattress and putting cigarettes out on them and finally shooting them in the back of the head and throwing them in a river.
[00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:23.096]  That's how you pimp so good.
[00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:33.945]  Oh, it's so manly to swagger around and have no responsibility and just use dumbed-down stupid women and other people as you act tough.
[00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:40.586]  And then you see 4,000 people shot in Chicago last year, almost all of them black, over 2,000 deaths.
[00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:44.827]  You don't say a word about that because you pimp so good for Sumner Redstone.
[00:42:47.487 --> 00:42:51.068]  How you pimp so good, Bow Wow.
[00:42:52.421 --> 00:42:54.662]  Bow Wow gets the war Bow Wow wants.
[00:42:56.363 --> 00:42:59.285]  And over there in Cripville, it'll be a lot worse and the blood's coming after you.
[00:42:59.565 --> 00:43:02.906]  Not a million times worse, but I get it, you're a tough guy.
[00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:10.650]  You act like a man in a little boy's world, and you think kidnapping people's wives and putting them into sex slavery's cool.
[00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.793]  Well, let's just say I bet you're gonna have some bad luck.
[00:43:16.533 --> 00:43:17.034]  Someday,
[00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:24.698]  When you're not expecting it, I think the good Lord is going to visit some justice on Bow Wow.
[00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:34.800]  I think Bow Wow... What's that name they got for zombies?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.121]  They got a show, it's called The Walking Dead.
[00:43:40.021 --> 00:43:41.161]  Amy, let me get back to the news here.
[00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:46.262]  Oh look, the House Intel Committee admits that, oh they were, the government was spying on Trump.
[00:43:46.622 --> 00:43:47.422]  Oh, but they call it...
[00:43:48.766 --> 00:43:50.507]  Picked up on surveillance now.
[00:43:50.787 --> 00:43:52.348]  Oh, Trump was a liar again.
[00:43:52.408 --> 00:43:53.608]  No, completely right again.
[00:43:54.889 --> 00:44:00.671]  And the same committee again says, yeah, we've seen all the intelligence, not even phone calls to the Russians till they're president-elect.
[00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:02.372]  Which you're supposed to do.
[00:44:02.732 --> 00:44:08.894]  So let's go to Rand Paul's response to John McCain, saying that he actually now works for Putin.
[00:44:11.636 --> 00:44:12.336]  You work?
[00:44:13.636 --> 00:44:14.797]  Everybody's a Russian agent now.
[00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.902]  Man, thank God that Russian agent worked with Trump to get the coal power turned back on.
[00:44:20.922 --> 00:44:22.467]  The coal miners are getting their jobs back in Kentucky.
[00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.751]  Thank you, Russia!
[00:44:25.094 --> 00:44:29.775]  By the way, you know who's going to get hurt the most by the coal deal here in the United States?
[00:44:30.295 --> 00:44:33.536]  Do you know who's going to get hurt the worst by the coal deal here in the United States?
[00:44:33.576 --> 00:44:34.076]  The Russians.
[00:44:34.437 --> 00:44:37.037]  The main export they have is natural gas.
[00:44:37.798 --> 00:44:39.638]  Europe doesn't have coal like we do anymore.
[00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:40.358]  We have it.
[00:44:40.418 --> 00:44:41.038]  Ship it to them.
[00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:41.939]  They've got the systems.
[00:44:42.359 --> 00:44:43.919]  It will drive down gas prices.
[00:44:44.059 --> 00:44:48.560]  Oh, by the way, gas prices are the lowest they've been in 20 years, basically, right now.
[00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:53.622]  And they're still going down to less than $2 per British cubic foot, or whatever they call it.
[00:44:54.182 --> 00:44:55.163]  Oh my gosh!
[00:44:55.323 --> 00:44:56.183]  Oh my God!
[00:44:56.564 --> 00:45:01.887]  Trump just did something that will decimate the Russians in their financing.
[00:45:02.848 --> 00:45:03.188]  Oh my!
[00:45:03.348 --> 00:45:03.848]  Oh!
[00:45:04.088 --> 00:45:05.749]  Why did a Russian agent do that?
[00:45:15.032 --> 00:45:17.073]  McCain, you're the enemy of this country.
[00:45:17.493 --> 00:45:23.676]  You're the little whore that sold us out to a hundred different institutions and groups, and you're the one that'll pay, you little coward!
[00:45:24.396 --> 00:45:26.057]  And you know it, and you feel it.
[00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:27.998]  You thought you had this country for decades.
[00:45:28.578 --> 00:45:29.799]  It's running wild.
[00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:30.339]  Do whatever you want.
[00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:42.305]  It won't go on forever, and you can see the end of it now, with populism and nationalism rising everywhere, and you'll never put the genie back in the bottle, McCain, because now you've been identified, and your types have.
[00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:50.409]  I wonder how they'd ever have a private global corporate government and then deny it existed.
[00:45:50.429 --> 00:45:52.051]  See, we force it out in the open.
[00:45:52.071 --> 00:45:54.334]  Here's Senator McCain's response.
[00:45:54.714 --> 00:45:57.137]  No, no, here is the response to Senator McCain from Rand Paul.
[00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:03.035]  Well, you know, I think he makes a really, really strong case, you know, for term limits.
[00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:07.037]  I think maybe he's past his prime.
[00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:11.340]  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.503]  I do think that when we talk about NATO, there can be a rational discussion about the pros and cons of expanding it.
[00:46:18.003 --> 00:46:21.826]  We currently have troops, combat troops, in about six nations.
[00:46:22.286 --> 00:46:26.909]  We have troops actively just stationed in probably a couple dozen others.
[00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:29.071]  We have a $20 trillion debt.
[00:46:29.572 --> 00:46:34.057]  And one of my favorite articles of the last couple years was one that talked about the angry McCains.
[00:46:34.557 --> 00:46:43.367]  And if we put active troops and got involved in combat where McCain wants us to be, they put a little angry McCain on the globe, on the map, and it's virtually every...
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:47:01.108]  So his foreign policy is something that would greatly endanger the United States, greatly overextend us, and there has to be the thought whether or not it's in our national interest to pledge to get involved with war if Montenegro has an altercation with anyone.
[00:47:01.872 --> 00:47:02.192]  That's right.
[00:47:02.212 --> 00:47:03.172]  There's some YouTube glitch.
[00:47:03.192 --> 00:47:07.854]  When you download these videos now, and it's happening to other people, not just us, it does a second pause.
[00:47:08.114 --> 00:47:09.094]  We're not editing these videos.
[00:47:09.114 --> 00:47:09.694]  These are unedited.
[00:47:09.714 --> 00:47:11.175]  They just have these glitches now.
[00:47:11.815 --> 00:47:15.016]  We're trying to find a workaround, but we've looked on the message boards and other places.
[00:47:15.036 --> 00:47:17.897]  If somebody knows, please let us know at ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[00:47:17.937 --> 00:47:21.398]  But getting back to this, yeah, we have to have a debate.
[00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:24.519]  We have to have armed service committee discussions.
[00:47:24.539 --> 00:47:26.300]  We have to talk to the ambassadors.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.061]  We can't just have McCain pass a bill for a treaty to bring
[00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:38.829]  Ukraine that's in a civil war that John McCain literally quarterbacked with Hillary and Obama and George Soros, all bragging about it on CNN.
[00:47:39.169 --> 00:47:40.230]  We have clips of them all bragging.
[00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.673]  They go start a horrible war, they should be getting arrested.
[00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:53.363]  And then people that aren't insane, like President Trump, Senator Paul, go, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:47:53.623 --> 00:47:54.223]  No, we're not.
[00:47:55.137 --> 00:48:00.862]  Russia has said that if they stabilize the country, they'll even pull out of the small area they're in in Ukraine that's right on the Russian border.
[00:48:01.622 --> 00:48:11.030]  Most of the country's already been overrun by the globalists and they have all sorts of weapons and paramilitary troops and EU forces, NATO forces have been fighting Russians for years there.
[00:48:11.271 --> 00:48:14.553]  There's already a ground war going on.
[00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:21.139]  And you look at the map, 80% of the country is being run by the West.
[00:48:22.438 --> 00:48:27.203]  And the Russians have put up perimeters along rivers and strategic points right there and are holding them at that point.
[00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.646]  And McCain just wants to roll in and have a war with Russia.
[00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:37.575]  And they've got these generals that go on Fox News, you can Google it, and say, the answer in Ukraine is attack the Russians, even in Russia, and a bunch of body bags.
[00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:40.258]  Just like Operation Barbarossa in 1942, right?
[00:48:44.028 --> 00:48:45.569]  I mean, it's the same craziness.
[00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.710]  Why?
[00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:47.771]  What is Russia even doing?
[00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:51.594]  It's because the globalists don't want any other power structure they don't control.
[00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:56.177]  And they made deals with China, and they moved our jobs to China, and they're making money off China.
[00:48:56.958 --> 00:48:59.740]  China, they've at least, are partially in bed with.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:09.107]  But meanwhile, China's double-crossing them, announcing deployment of Marines all over the world, and submarines all over, and cruise missiles to attack the U.S., and, you know, is breaking all their agreements.
[00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:12.189]  So, this stuff's really degenerating very, very quickly.
[00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:16.992]  All right, I've got a bunch of news I want to get to here.
[00:49:18.012 --> 00:49:19.853]  Federal judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[00:49:21.594 --> 00:49:24.255]  Violent threats against the president are okay now, that's the Hill.
[00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.556]  Tying into Bow Wow and all the rest of it.
[00:49:26.816 --> 00:49:30.297]  Natural gas prices are about to plunge below $2.
[00:49:30.817 --> 00:49:32.978]  Mutiny at VA hospital, I'm going to go into details on that.
[00:49:33.038 --> 00:49:34.839]  Soros fueling unrest in Macedonia now.
[00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:37.368]  Tried to bring the Muslims in there.
[00:49:38.068 --> 00:49:39.589]  They already got Albania and Kosovo.
[00:49:39.629 --> 00:49:40.289]  Now they want that.
[00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.891]  This guy is literally allied with the radical Muslims.
[00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:45.972]  I mean, he's just horrible.
[00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:46.993]  You can't make this up.
[00:49:47.333 --> 00:49:48.354]  Look at James Bond villain.
[00:49:49.815 --> 00:49:51.315]  Turkey claims they run Europe now.
[00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:56.698]  They're threatening, quote, official Ergun and his top minister claim holy wars will soon begin in Europe.
[00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:00.240]  They say they have the sleeper cells to now blow up and burn up Europe and that Europe is weak.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:00.941]  They're going to take it down.
[00:50:01.261 --> 00:50:02.642]  And of course, the socialists brought him in.
[00:50:02.882 --> 00:50:04.463]  And now Turkey's declaring it's going to conquer Europe.
[00:50:05.023 --> 00:50:06.584]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:07.864]  This is out of their mouths now.
[00:50:08.404 --> 00:50:17.147]  Just crazed people on power trips like McCain and Ergun, who've been in power so long, they're like, we're invincible, we'll do everything, we'll just take over!
[00:50:18.887 --> 00:50:21.128]  And Ergun says, they've already had to pull U.S.
[00:50:21.168 --> 00:50:29.491]  nuclear weapons out of, in the last year, Obama was forced to do it, out of bases there because Ergun was talking about seizing them.
[00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.276]  Oh, that's a great idea!
[00:50:31.576 --> 00:50:35.406]  Start a war with the United States, Ergon, and seize the nuclear weapons, you lunatic!
[00:50:38.573 --> 00:50:39.113]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:40.434]  I must be a Russian agent.
[00:50:40.854 --> 00:50:42.974]  Oh, a Putin agent, because I don't want to have war either.
[00:50:43.634 --> 00:50:44.735]  These people are crazy.
[00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:46.495]  They're completely out of control.
[00:50:46.675 --> 00:50:48.756]  This is the exact climate you see before world wars.
[00:50:48.996 --> 00:50:50.516]  And all the mainline analysts are saying that.
[00:50:50.837 --> 00:50:51.857]  But McCain doesn't care.
[00:50:52.097 --> 00:50:52.937]  Soros doesn't care.
[00:50:52.957 --> 00:50:58.519]  Hillary doesn't care, because they're all demonic, twisted, filthy piles of trash.
[00:50:58.919 --> 00:50:59.579]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:00.019]  Stay with us.
[00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:08.402]  Roger, is this not incredible, my friend?
[00:51:09.642 --> 00:51:15.964]  Alex, I think we are on the cusp of the greatest single political scandal in American history.
[00:51:16.644 --> 00:51:19.305]  The deep state has been hit with a double whammy.
[00:51:20.325 --> 00:51:32.809]  They have gotten caught spying on the nominee of one of the two major parties and their rationale, their phony rationale for that spying has now been disproved.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:56.008]  We now know that the Obama administration, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever and no probable cause, went to the FISA court, the secret, super secret FISA court, first in June, requesting that Donald Trump and his associates, including yours truly, be put under surveillance.
[00:51:56.708 --> 00:51:59.069]  And they were, we believe, denied.
[00:52:00.032 --> 00:52:17.259]  We now know that they went back in October with something more narrowly drawn as far as candidate Trump is concerned, and this secret warrant to spy on the Republican nominee for president was approved.
[00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:20.280]  Here it is, Catherine Herdage.
[00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:23.642]  Top-level state operatives leak Flynn phone call transcripts.
[00:52:23.922 --> 00:52:26.103]  We already know that, but when she goes on Fox News,
[00:52:26.463 --> 00:52:30.168]  She's heavily embedded with the CIA and defense intelligence, you name it.
[00:52:30.448 --> 00:52:34.973]  When that lady, I got a spy chief, gets on there and says that, you know, they're totally turning on him.
[00:52:34.993 --> 00:52:39.359]  And didn't Trump set him up, having them deny it for three days before all this comes out?
[00:52:39.379 --> 00:52:39.959]  Let's be clear.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.461]  This didn't come from the Russians.
[00:52:41.501 --> 00:52:44.004]  This came from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:52:44.245 --> 00:52:45.246]  And I was told a week ago
[00:52:45.626 --> 00:52:47.567]  Get ready for the next hammer to drop next week.
[00:52:47.867 --> 00:52:48.747]  Relax, Alex.
[00:52:49.007 --> 00:52:49.607]  Trump's on it.
[00:52:50.007 --> 00:52:51.488]  And so they want a war with Trump, man.
[00:52:51.528 --> 00:52:52.168]  That is showing.
[00:52:52.208 --> 00:52:52.968]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:52:52.988 --> 00:52:59.170]  The dirty tricks and the tactics of the deep state have now been, you know, exposed for everybody to see.
[00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:03.551]  These criminals have to be dragged in front of a grand jury one by one.
[00:53:04.151 --> 00:53:07.974]  In all honesty, I don't think a congressional inquiry is the way to go.
[00:53:07.994 --> 00:53:15.581]  We need indictments under national security for illegal spying and sabotage for private corporate interests against the United States of America.
[00:53:15.601 --> 00:53:16.462]  It's espionage.
[00:53:16.702 --> 00:53:17.502]  It's a new type though.
[00:53:17.522 --> 00:53:20.165]  It's corporate espionage against the republic.
[00:53:20.385 --> 00:53:21.386]  That's what globalism is.
[00:53:22.864 --> 00:53:39.027]  It is not wise to go to Congress for a totally politicized investigation in which nattering nabobs of negativism, like Elijah Cummings, blather on and on about the CIA and these allegations without a shred.
[00:53:39.147 --> 00:53:47.015]  It's in the CIA data dump that they were trying to set up Trump and his confidants with fake servers from Russia and fake cyber attacks.
[00:53:47.035 --> 00:53:52.720]  So we now know we have the head of the Intelligence Committee in the House saying no evidence, no phone calls, no nothing.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.063]  So they've been caught with a bluff of surveillance.
[00:53:55.403 --> 00:53:56.484]  They did the surveillance.
[00:53:56.764 --> 00:53:59.747]  Now they're trying to say they didn't do it, even though a month ago they bragged they do it.
[00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:01.429]  They are up the creek without a paddle.
[00:54:06.354 --> 00:54:10.337]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[00:54:11.097 --> 00:54:13.259]  Yeah, I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[00:54:13.819 --> 00:54:15.400]  And all the idiots won't be seen with me.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.822]  This hit them 30 years ago where the newspapers lied about you, destroy you.
[00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.343]  Folks know they're a bunch of liars.
[00:54:20.363 --> 00:54:27.248]  It's only the dumbest people imaginable buy Alec Baldwin's lies and all the rest of it against myself and President Trump.
[00:54:27.828 --> 00:54:29.569]  That's the good news, we've got the initiative.
[00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.113]  And that's why they're panicking, because they know their end is near politically.
[00:54:36.653 --> 00:54:37.854]  We hadn't had to fire a shot.
[00:54:39.114 --> 00:54:43.956]  The last refuge of tyrants is war when they're hanging on by their fingernails.
[00:54:46.798 --> 00:54:51.420]  I got too many friends because they read the papers and they want to be seen with me.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.401]  And again, I'm not saying that in a braggadocious way.
[00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:56.542]  The point is they want to intimidate you.
[00:54:56.582 --> 00:54:58.523]  They want to make you feel like you can't be politically involved.
[00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:01.865]  They want to stifle you because they know we're at the tipping point and we're winning.
[00:55:04.522 --> 00:55:04.982]  They're bullies.
[00:55:05.562 --> 00:55:06.623]  They're using peer pressure.
[00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:09.003]  This is such a critical time.
[00:55:11.164 --> 00:55:12.945]  We have the thinkers, they have the stinkers.
[00:55:15.085 --> 00:55:17.766]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm gonna open the phones up and get into all the news.
[00:55:17.786 --> 00:55:22.187]  I'm about to mention some of them I hit, some that I haven't dug into yet, but here's the bottom line.
[00:55:22.868 --> 00:55:27.109]  There is an open mutiny in every major federal agency against President Trump.
[00:55:29.008 --> 00:55:31.030]  There is an open mutiny in the news.
[00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.912]  There's open calls everywhere to kill him.
[00:55:33.432 --> 00:55:41.219]  They are organizing racketeer operations, and I mean that in the very sense of the word, to launch a civil war in this country.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:48.246]  Obama, the last month in, admitted that he was mobilizing and patching agencies with people that didn't even have been there before.
[00:55:49.474 --> 00:55:52.296]  As sleeper cells, to just ignore what Trump says.
[00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:56.940]  So he gets in his first tier, his second tier, then all the rest leak, they lie, they ignore.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.223]  The VA won't hang up his signs, congressman comes in, hangs it up, they take it down.
[00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:03.064]  And they brag, we're not doing it.
[00:56:03.825 --> 00:56:06.827]  McDonald's comes out and says, you know, Trump's scum, he's trash.
[00:56:07.027 --> 00:56:08.428]  They go, oh it's an accident, it's an accident.
[00:56:08.648 --> 00:56:10.510]  Guess who one of their head PR people is, the head.
[00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:11.971]  It's Gibbs, Robert Gibbs.
[00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:14.233]  We got an article coming out where I say it's probably him.
[00:56:14.713 --> 00:56:15.393]  He's a known liar.
[00:56:15.433 --> 00:56:18.075]  He said he lies about the drone program, lies about everything else.
[00:56:18.555 --> 00:56:19.215]  He's at McDonald's.
[00:56:19.235 --> 00:56:21.836]  You don't think McDonald's really hacked out that thing attacking Trump?
[00:56:23.137 --> 00:56:23.717]  Hack attack!
[00:56:23.737 --> 00:56:32.041]  McDonald's blames compromised Twitter account after firing off insulting tweet at Donald Trump, calling him a disgusting excuse of a president with tiny hands.
[00:56:32.181 --> 00:56:34.082]  That's Gibbs, in my opinion.
[00:56:34.382 --> 00:56:35.983]  I think he's the prime suspect, I'll tell you that.
[00:56:36.683 --> 00:56:38.604]  No one else has pointed this out that I know of.
[00:56:39.805 --> 00:56:42.746]  We've got Kit Daniels about to put his article up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:56:44.133 --> 00:56:44.533]  Oh, here it is.
[00:56:44.553 --> 00:56:45.794]  I guess he put it on my desk during the break.
[00:56:45.934 --> 00:56:49.356]  Was Obama insider Robert Gibbs behind McDonald's anti-Trump tweet?
[00:56:49.496 --> 00:56:51.857]  Gibbs, now McDonald's Chief Communications Officer.
[00:56:53.098 --> 00:56:53.218]  Oh!
[00:56:53.498 --> 00:56:55.899]  He certainly then allowed it to happen.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.781]  It's Gibbs!
[00:57:00.582 --> 00:57:01.202]  It's Gibbs.
[00:57:03.983 --> 00:57:04.504]  It's Gibbs.
[00:57:04.624 --> 00:57:08.406]  And that's how you treat the president, eating McDonald's on TV, trying to look provincial.
[00:57:09.451 --> 00:57:10.512]  Truth is, Trump actually likes it.
[00:57:10.532 --> 00:57:12.733]  It's kind of a fetish for some rich guys to eat the best food.
[00:57:12.753 --> 00:57:14.834]  I've seen it before and they like junk food.
[00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:15.354]  It's weird.
[00:57:15.754 --> 00:57:16.774]  People in Hollywood do it too.
[00:57:17.755 --> 00:57:20.076]  You wouldn't catch me near a McDonald's hamburger.
[00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.757]  I get sick if I eat it.
[00:57:22.657 --> 00:57:23.818]  Anyways, I'm not even Mr. Healthy.
[00:57:23.838 --> 00:57:25.459]  I mean, I'll eat big ol' juicy cheeseburgers all day.
[00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:26.159]  That ain't it!
[00:57:27.981 --> 00:57:29.342]  By the way, I haven't plugged once this hour.
[00:57:29.382 --> 00:57:30.222]  We need your support.
[00:57:30.263 --> 00:57:31.183]  We're in a total war.
[00:57:31.203 --> 00:57:33.244]  I mean, we are in a total war.
[00:57:33.525 --> 00:57:34.445]  We have the initiative.
[00:57:34.705 --> 00:57:36.447]  We're starting to win, but we need your prayers.
[00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:37.787]  We need your financial support.
[00:57:37.807 --> 00:57:38.568]  We've got products.

[00:58:16.394 --> 00:58:18.841]  America First is 1776 and fullwords.com.
[00:58:19.302 --> 00:58:22.190]  Out of the gates, half off, $9.95 to help spread the word.

[00:58:38.087 --> 00:58:38.747]  It's a war.
[00:58:38.767 --> 00:58:39.808]  We're starting to win.
[00:58:40.348 --> 00:58:42.508]  Everybody though has to keep pulling and fighting.
[00:58:42.548 --> 00:58:43.749]  And it's fun to do anyways.
[00:58:43.769 --> 00:58:45.269]  We're not going to let them win.
[00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:46.250]  Get ready.
[00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:48.631]  Second hour is going to be power act.
[00:58:49.311 --> 00:58:49.751]  Yeah!
[00:58:53.146 --> 00:58:57.590]  Monsanto's weed killer Roundup is one of the most used agricultural products around the planet.
[00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:02.635]  Its main ingredient, glyphosate, has been controversial as it has been linked to cancer.
[00:59:02.815 --> 00:59:07.379]  In a new lawsuit, Monsanto has been accused of manipulating research to hide the dangers of Roundup.
[00:59:07.519 --> 00:59:17.608]  Yolanda Mendoza, a regular user of Roundup with stage 4 cancer, is one of hundreds suing Monsanto, citing a World Health Organization study that says glyphosate is probably carcinogenic.
[00:59:17.708 --> 00:59:25.431]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge declaring the state legally require Roundup to warn its consumers of the potential to cause cancer.
[00:59:25.631 --> 00:59:28.072]  Remember this from a Monsanto lobbyist.
[00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:32.714]  I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[00:59:32.774 --> 00:59:35.055]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[00:59:35.696 --> 00:59:36.576]  You want to drink some?
[00:59:36.616 --> 00:59:37.356]  We have some here.
[00:59:37.436 --> 00:59:39.297]  I'd be happy to, actually.
[00:59:39.417 --> 00:59:40.758]  Not really, but... Tell the truth.
[00:59:40.818 --> 00:59:42.158]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[00:59:42.358 --> 00:59:43.059]  No, it's not.
[00:59:43.239 --> 00:59:45.420]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.240]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.803]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's Roundup.
[00:59:49.923 --> 00:59:52.265]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:59:54.266 --> 01:00:00.171]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.982 --> 01:00:13.527]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.747 --> 01:00:19.771]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:21.613]  And tell us we should live like Venezuela.
[01:00:22.393 --> 01:00:23.074]  Or North Korea.
[01:00:23.154 --> 01:00:29.117]  And saying they want to openly kill our president and put his wife in sex slavery.
[01:00:29.557 --> 01:00:37.041]  I'm surprised somebody didn't go out to California and find Bow Wow and talk to him.
[01:00:40.383 --> 01:00:43.284]  They take our restraint and kindness for weakness.
[01:00:43.864 --> 01:00:46.326]  You're a bunch of losers.
[01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:55.170]  Those that want to kill Trump and torture his wife, those of you that want to shoot your mouths off, you know you're losers, you know you're scum.
[01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.711]  Alec Baldwin, Bow Wow, all of you are lying trash.
[01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.797]  Just know this, you get the civil war you want, we're trying to stop it.
[01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:15.303]  Your names are at the top of the list to be in a lot of trouble for the sedition and criminal activity you're openly calling for.
[01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:17.945]  Turn a little bit more for Merle Haggard.
[01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:20.306]  Yeah!
[01:01:20.326 --> 01:01:22.887]  Oh, they love our milk and honey!
[01:01:23.008 --> 01:01:25.429]  North Korea, Venezuela, EU.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.168]  Yeah, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[01:01:51.189 --> 01:01:54.934]  Thank you, Merle.
[01:01:54.974 --> 01:01:56.476]  Now, I'm part of legend, died last year.
[01:01:57.941 --> 01:02:00.643]  Now let's think about this.
[01:02:01.724 --> 01:02:02.725]  I don't want to launch wars.
[01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.887]  I don't want to fund Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:05.967]  Those are bad wars.
[01:02:06.408 --> 01:02:18.016]  When we talk about fighting for ideas, fighting by wearing a t-shirt, standing up for free speech, fighting that women not get beat up that are going to Trump events, fighting to just be able to have political views and freedom in this country.
[01:02:19.718 --> 01:02:25.522]  And to see the so-called left and the right-wing establishment all together against Trump and our Americana movement.
[01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:37.601]  And then to have Trump 55 days in, delivering on almost everything he said he'd do, faster than I thought he could do it, with a full-scale mutiny on his hands.
[01:02:40.782 --> 01:02:46.405]  Think of the entitlement of John McCain to now say Senator Rand Paul actually is a Putin agent with no proof.
[01:02:47.465 --> 01:02:49.046]  I mean, talk about walking on the fighting side.
[01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.316]  He is such an arrogant piece of trash.
[01:02:52.816 --> 01:02:57.639]  And you know all the bad stuff McCain did, like I do, a lot of you know as well, that I've been following him for 20 plus years.
[01:02:58.179 --> 01:03:01.901]  McCain's so bad, it's just like, what an arrogant psychopath.
[01:03:05.403 --> 01:03:06.444]  Completely out of his mind.
[01:03:09.566 --> 01:03:12.627]  He's like that one senator, in fact the guy's even in the photo.
[01:03:14.408 --> 01:03:16.430]  Who was the senator, he died right after it, up in
[01:03:17.688 --> 01:03:23.609]  Alaska that thought, the internet, we can shut it down, it's a bunch of tubes, they won't read it!
[01:03:23.629 --> 01:03:36.151]  I mean, McCain is like, a few years away, and I say this sadly, from, you know, walking around in a nursing home going, meh, war, war, meh, meh, war, war.
[01:03:36.171 --> 01:03:37.512]  But, you know, he just wants war!
[01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:40.072]  Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.
[01:03:41.993 --> 01:03:44.193]  At least Iran's been threatening to attack us sometimes.
[01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:46.678]  Russia's not doing anything!
[01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:50.239]  And they've got nuclear weapons, dumbass!
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.461]  I'm going to come right back after this break when I've really got some time.
[01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:56.182]  I'm going to lay out the mutiny that I've already been mentioning.
[01:03:56.202 --> 01:03:57.663]  I'm going to play the clips and more.
[01:03:58.403 --> 01:03:59.924]  And then I'm going to tie in to this.
[01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:02.205]  What are they in a mutiny against?
[01:04:03.946 --> 01:04:04.526]  Prosperity.
[01:04:05.767 --> 01:04:06.507]  A good economy.
[01:04:06.587 --> 01:04:07.868]  A large, growing middle class.
[01:04:09.229 --> 01:04:10.469]  Bringing Americans together.
[01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:13.431]  Healing all these racial and cultural wounds that have been
[01:04:14.688 --> 01:04:15.349]  Reopened.
[01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.172]  And then in some cases that are brand new.
[01:04:18.252 --> 01:04:19.654]  I mean, it's full scale.
[01:04:19.974 --> 01:04:20.815]  I saw the New York Times.
[01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:21.736]  I sent it to Nico.
[01:04:22.117 --> 01:04:23.058]  He probably gave me my stack.
[01:04:23.078 --> 01:04:23.599]  I need to find it.
[01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:25.461]  I didn't go over the whole stack today.
[01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:26.162]  I'm a bad person.
[01:04:26.402 --> 01:04:29.205]  There was a New York Times article where it said,
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.363]  White parents must apologize for their racist kids and must stop your kids from being racist.
[01:04:34.383 --> 01:04:36.264]  It's like saying, black people, you're bad.
[01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:37.284]  Apologize as a group.
[01:04:37.304 --> 01:04:40.306]  Just, you know, Chinese, you're evil as a group.
[01:04:40.346 --> 01:04:40.886]  Apologize.
[01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:55.075]  It's just such race-baiting and invoking the minorities that are the majority now to go into race-based politics and literally run around and henpeck white people as the new persecuted group.
[01:04:55.115 --> 01:04:58.357]  I mean, the Democrats got their butts kicked in the 60s by the Republicans.
[01:04:59.872 --> 01:05:01.653]  Trying to end the race stuff, and they're right back at it.
[01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:10.275]  I wanted to clear up the whole chemtrail thing, because you're- Well, let's do that.
[01:05:10.315 --> 01:05:10.756]  Let's do that.
[01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:12.836]  No one calls it chemtrails in the real world.
[01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:13.756]  I call it chemtrails.
[01:05:14.037 --> 01:05:15.577]  There is manipulation of the weather.
[01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:16.817]  It's mainstream news.
[01:05:17.178 --> 01:05:18.958]  And the media always picks it up and says, I'm crazy.
[01:05:19.018 --> 01:05:21.419]  It's on the Weather Channel that there are secret programs.
[01:05:21.679 --> 01:05:23.380]  It's just so secret, we don't know the details.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.561]  Then other people think every condensation trail is a jet- is an actual-
[01:05:27.901 --> 01:05:29.862]  John O'Brien was at the CFR talking about.
[01:05:45.888 --> 01:05:50.992]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering.
[01:05:51.652 --> 01:05:53.013]  Yeah, you even said this for years.
[01:05:53.214 --> 01:06:03.301]  Eventually, they're going to come out and say that yes, they are spraying the atmosphere with metallic particles, but it's to save us, to save for global warming, to save the planet.
[01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:05.183]  And that's exactly what John O'Brennan did.
[01:06:05.663 --> 01:06:21.093]  He got it from the CFR, and he said, yeah, we're going to start spraying the atmosphere with stratospheric aerosol injections, and it's going to cost $10 billion a year, and there's going to be some countries that are not going to be into it because... And guess who's behind it?
[01:06:21.774 --> 01:06:23.395]  Word for word, you're saying what they put out.
[01:06:23.495 --> 01:06:24.496]  Bill Gates called for this.
[01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:27.618]  Bill Gates is getting government money to then run the program.
[01:06:27.938 --> 01:06:28.398]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.159]  They're running programs to control hurricanes.
[01:06:30.259 --> 01:06:33.221]  It's all in, like, Nature and Science magazine.
[01:06:33.681 --> 01:06:39.384]  But then they go on the news and say, Alex says Obama sent tornadoes to Oklahoma.
[01:06:39.484 --> 01:06:40.044]  No, I didn't!
[01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.645]  So again, they misrepresent what's really going on.
[01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:45.707]  Explain to the people out there who are still non-believers what...
[01:06:46.447 --> 01:06:52.089]  What is the difference between legit contrails and the ones that last all day and completely cover the sky?
[01:06:52.149 --> 01:06:54.849]  Okay, it turns out people think of jet fuel as really volatile.
[01:06:54.889 --> 01:06:55.209]  It's not.
[01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:59.691]  Gasoline is like three times more volatile, more explosive, burns hotter, you name it.
[01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:02.151]  Jet fuel actually is like kerosene.
[01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:04.012]  So you can add a lot of things to kerosene.
[01:07:04.052 --> 01:07:07.153]  They add barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and also some radioactive isotopes.
[01:07:07.173 --> 01:07:11.034]  There's only three big major makers of jet fuel in the United States.
[01:07:11.054 --> 01:07:12.174]  There's some sub ones as well.
[01:07:12.554 --> 01:07:15.055]  And they just, under a national security directive that's secret,
[01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:18.838]  The patents are there, the directive is known, but the details are classified.
[01:07:19.198 --> 01:07:41.677]  They add this to the mix in a government program, they're paid to do it, and then they use the jet engines, uh, the patents, there's like over 20 patents on this, you can Google it, and you get the patent office, to use jet engines to then aerosolize for cloud seeding, and they claim that they're shielding the earth from the sun because we've lost our atmosphere, but then you actually look at what the scientists are doing, it's actually
[01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.959]  You know, hurting the planet, actually keeping heat in, the opposite.
[01:07:45.679 --> 01:07:48.060]  Uh, so it's like they're trying to create global warming, actually.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.422]  Because, again, the ultraviolet radiation goes through the clouds, the other good sun gets blocked and bounces back out.
[01:07:54.043 --> 01:07:58.004]  Those wavelengths get blocked, but the ultraviolet, that comes through, doesn't bounce back out.
[01:07:58.024 --> 01:07:59.765]  Okay, it just heats the Earth up.
[01:08:00.065 --> 01:08:02.606]  So they're trying to heat the Earth up in a big, giant, secret experiment.
[01:08:13.945 --> 01:08:18.095]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:18.816 --> 01:08:20.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:42.952]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm opening the phones up.
[01:08:43.032 --> 01:08:45.532]  And then, media activist Paul Excellant.
[01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:50.834]  Mark Dice is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:56.155]  And of course, we have Anthony Comey, always doing a great job hosting the fourth hour.
[01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.376]  Does that twice a month.
[01:08:57.396 --> 01:09:01.557]  The fourth hour is that great grab bag wild card transmission that's so popular now.
[01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:08.659]  If you just joined us, John McCain came out and said that Rand Paul is an agent of Putin.
[01:09:10.134 --> 01:09:16.339]  No evidence, no nothing, he just doesn't want to have a treaty put through that the United States will invade with NATO.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:25.067]  The war zone, civil war that John McCain and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and George Soros bragged they started three and a half years ago.
[01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:37.098]  I mean, if you want me I can pull up the articles and play Fareed Zakaria, CNN, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Samantha Powers, all bragging they started it over through an elected government.
[01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:46.495]  And tried to steal it from Russia when, for 500 years, the entire East, Crimea, has been part of Russia.
[01:09:47.476 --> 01:09:53.880]  I mean, from what I've researched, they even said that's probably where Russia started was in the Crimea, but it's kind of like, you know, Plymouth Rock or something.
[01:09:54.601 --> 01:09:56.983]  This just shows the level we've gotten to here.
[01:09:58.844 --> 01:10:00.465]  I mean, this is next level.
[01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:03.608]  But it's all part of the mutiny in government
[01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:08.453]  A month ago, Trump comes out with his travel ban from seven countries.
[01:10:08.593 --> 01:10:09.954]  Somalia, Sudan, you name it.
[01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:11.055]  Libya.
[01:10:11.455 --> 01:10:15.858]  Hell holes that don't even have properly working airports and don't have any documentation.
[01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:18.901]  There aren't passports out of Somalia.
[01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:23.565]  It's incredible that we even let people in from there.
[01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:26.547]  That's one of the biggest refugee groups.
[01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:28.329]  Stabbings, murder, shooting.
[01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.610]  I know there's some nice Somali folks.
[01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:34.954]  I get them wanting to flee that hell on earth, but ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:45.804]  The president has the power, but the Ninth Circuit, the same one that banned the American flag in schools in California, in the Ninth Circus, they came out and blocked it.
[01:10:46.105 --> 01:10:52.209]  So he then had all the top lawyers write something beyond bulletproof, because the old border was bulletproof.
[01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:56.452]  This one is like under a mountain of armor.
[01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.495]  It's like under a, you know, six-mile mountain.
[01:10:59.575 --> 01:11:02.757]  I mean, not even nuclear weapons could get it if it was a bunker.
[01:11:03.398 --> 01:11:04.859]  It's that ironclad.
[01:11:06.283 --> 01:11:08.965]  Federal judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:15.049]  This is mutiny and Trump has come out and said this is a rebelling judge.
[01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:18.832]  I'm going to play that clip here in just a moment from his speech last night.
[01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:21.814]  More speeches today to crowds of 50,000 people or more.
[01:11:23.816 --> 01:11:26.358]  Trump said that it's unprecedented judicial overreach.
[01:11:26.738 --> 01:11:30.000]  That is the really kind of a whitewash.
[01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:31.882]  I know he wants to be friends with the judiciary.
[01:11:32.142 --> 01:11:33.163]  News flash, Mr. President.
[01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:39.127]  All over MSM, they're saying they want to kill you and your family and put Melania in sex slavery.
[01:11:40.247 --> 01:11:43.949]  And the media is praising Snoop's nephew, Bow Wow.
[01:11:44.849 --> 01:11:46.450]  Will Bow Wow lose his record contract?
[01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:48.310]  Will Bow Wow get kicked off MTV?
[01:11:48.350 --> 01:12:00.615]  No, he'll be promoted because this group of scum, this group of trash, are trying to organize criminal actions everywhere, where Michael Savage and his dog get beat up in a restaurant yesterday, or the day before yesterday, right after he's on my show.
[01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:02.971]  Screaming, oh, you support Trump.
[01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:05.532]  Videos all over the country, people getting beaten up.
[01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:08.554]  Not just wearing a Trump hat, but just because you're white.
[01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:11.916]  Total race war.
[01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:17.439]  New York Times coming out and saying, you must order white parents stop raising racist kids.
[01:12:19.665 --> 01:12:20.005]  Wow!
[01:12:20.365 --> 01:12:23.366]  This is full-on, and folks, it's not the minorities that are pushing this.
[01:12:24.287 --> 01:12:26.687]  It is the weaponized media, the big banks.
[01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:27.668]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:29.348]  They said, we're losing the culture war.
[01:12:29.648 --> 01:12:30.689]  America's coming together.
[01:12:30.909 --> 01:12:32.329]  The middle class knows what's happening.
[01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.650]  We've got to go to cultural weapons.
[01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:36.811]  That's a... culture war!
[01:12:37.751 --> 01:12:39.452]  It's how empires used to control India.
[01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:42.193]  A few thousand British soldiers controlled India.
[01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:48.335]  Tens of millions of people because they played each little tribe off against each other, each region off against the other.
[01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:54.310]  Federal judges blocked Trump's travel ban.
[01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.050]  Federal judges.
[01:12:55.891 --> 01:13:02.458]  Two federal judges have temporarily blocked President Trump's travel ban, both citing Trump's statements about Muslims during the campaign as part of their rulings.
[01:13:02.498 --> 01:13:03.038]  It doesn't matter.
[01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:04.059]  He has the law.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.481]  He has the official power.
[01:13:05.721 --> 01:13:09.885]  You now claim the First Amendment, saying Congress shall make no law respecting established religion?
[01:13:10.879 --> 01:13:14.303]  It's already a law for 60 plus years the president can do this.
[01:13:14.643 --> 01:13:17.986]  It's adjudicated, it's tested, it's peer-reviewed.
[01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:25.354]  There's massive piles and tens of thousands of cases that you can cite as precedent.
[01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:28.377]  It's so established, it's unbelievable.
[01:13:29.778 --> 01:13:30.318]  They don't care.
[01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.681]  It's called mutiny against the president.
[01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:39.055]  A ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii Wednesday resulted in a temporary restraining order nationwide.
[01:13:39.355 --> 01:13:49.004]  Hours before it was set to go into effect, the decision published Thursday morning, another judge in Maryland specifically blocked a 90-day ban on immigration for citizens in six Muslim-majority countries.
[01:13:51.366 --> 01:13:54.329]  And when there's another terror attack, they'll just cover all that up.
[01:13:54.409 --> 01:13:58.533]  So while we're talking about mutiny, violent threats against the president are okay now?
[01:13:58.713 --> 01:13:59.054]  The Hill.
[01:14:00.319 --> 01:14:01.620]  Here's one from Infowars.com.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:08.765]  After mock assassination, Snoop Dogg nephew, Bow Wow, threatens to pimp Melania Trump.
[01:14:08.825 --> 01:14:09.526]  That's sex slavery.
[01:14:11.467 --> 01:14:21.154]  Ayo, the real Donald Trump, shut your punk ass up talking bleep about my uncle at Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[01:14:21.294 --> 01:14:21.895]  Make her work.
[01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:22.455]  Sex slavery.
[01:14:23.036 --> 01:14:24.237]  Hey, listen, dumbass.
[01:14:24.577 --> 01:14:25.838]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:14:26.298 --> 01:14:27.279]  Your uncle,
[01:14:30.259 --> 01:14:31.199]  We're good to go.
[01:14:52.307 --> 01:14:54.748]  You're going to be living under the jail, my friend.
[01:14:55.168 --> 01:14:58.209]  I don't want you, bow-wow, to live under the jail.
[01:14:58.889 --> 01:15:07.252]  I want you to break the conditioning and not be chomped by George Soros, who is funding unrest in more than 30 countries, all behind radical Islam.
[01:15:07.672 --> 01:15:09.933]  You're like, I like Islam then, it's kind of anti-America.
[01:15:10.233 --> 01:15:11.914]  Yeah, go live over there then, my friend.
[01:15:12.354 --> 01:15:15.015]  Under the Wahhabist religion, black people are subhuman.
[01:15:17.395 --> 01:15:18.796]  So you're gonna, I'm sure, go join it then.
[01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:23.126]  Soros fueling unrest in Macedonia.
[01:15:23.426 --> 01:15:28.327]  Tensions risk leading to conflict with Russia as Senate investigates Soros.
[01:15:29.927 --> 01:15:31.788]  But forget investigating Soros.
[01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:38.029]  We have John McCain saying that anyone that opposes war with Russia is an agent of Putin.
[01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:44.371]  So, let's get to the next piece of mutiny.
[01:15:46.072 --> 01:15:47.572]  Trump must march
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:55.461]  into these VAs and have snap inspections that his photos on the wall.
[01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:56.222]  It's very simple.
[01:15:57.102 --> 01:15:58.162]  This is mutiny, folks.
[01:15:58.182 --> 01:15:59.202]  This is the executive branch.
[01:15:59.442 --> 01:16:00.183]  He's trying to clean it up.
[01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:09.565]  He's trying to really get people in there to actually help and have reviews of the people that work there to give good medical care to our veterans instead of a bunch of snot-nosed brats and thugs that fill the VA.
[01:16:09.745 --> 01:16:10.686]  Are there some good people in there?
[01:16:10.726 --> 01:16:10.966]  Yes.
[01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:12.966]  They're the ones that get pushed to the side.
[01:16:13.066 --> 01:16:15.067]  It is a joke how bad it is.
[01:16:16.987 --> 01:16:19.328]  The death list where a computer just says don't treat somebody?
[01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:21.975]  Don't give them a knee surgery, whatever.
[01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:25.579]  They literally just want to swindle the money for the bureaucracy.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.381]  The globalists hate our veterans.
[01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:28.523]  They hate our patriots.
[01:16:28.723 --> 01:16:29.764]  They hate our republic.
[01:16:30.325 --> 01:16:31.606]  They know who's the most awake.
[01:16:31.846 --> 01:16:37.593]  They know who has the seeds of victory and the seeds of renewal for our republic is our veterans in active duty.
[01:16:38.654 --> 01:16:41.978]  They're trying to convert to a robot, automated, drone army.
[01:16:43.837 --> 01:16:46.999]  Because they don't want to have to have humans that are honorable.
[01:16:47.239 --> 01:16:48.680]  They hate strong men and women.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.961]  They hate dedicated people.
[01:16:50.161 --> 01:16:52.883]  They fear the fact that you're honorable.
[01:16:55.824 --> 01:16:59.867]  Because you carry, in the dark of the night, the light of freedom.
[01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:09.733]  And so, it was already a story that 50 plus days in,
[01:17:11.109 --> 01:17:19.059]  There was no head of the VA, head of the Veterans Affairs Department confirmed weeks and weeks ago.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.081]  No President of the United States hanging up.
[01:17:22.643 --> 01:17:26.368]  And so, they've taken it down where the pictures were hung.
[01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:28.631]  They've taken Obama down.
[01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:33.292]  But there's such a mutiny in government that no pictures have been sent out across the country.
[01:17:33.312 --> 01:17:42.260]  So the congressman, told about this by his constituents, legs blown off in Afghanistan in his own right, Army Ranger, goes in to hang up the proper size official presidential photo.
[01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:45.642]  The security guard comes and gets in their face.
[01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:46.883]  Talk about the arrogance.
[01:17:47.364 --> 01:17:48.805]  These people are completely psychotic.
[01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:55.550]  In their arrogance, they come and get in their face, and then after they leave, they take it down.
[01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:59.594]  I mean, again, and you look at the slugs,
[01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:03.976]  That are actually in their face later trying to stop him.
[01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:06.678]  It just shows the total disconnect.
[01:18:07.678 --> 01:18:08.939]  That they think they're the boss.
[01:18:08.979 --> 01:18:10.160]  They think they can block us.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.542]  They think they can stop us when we're in the right.
[01:18:13.142 --> 01:18:15.524]  When all we want to do is restore the republic.
[01:18:16.264 --> 01:18:17.325]  The apple of the world's eye.
[01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:22.149]  And Trump's just in 50-something days and the economy is going from dying to turning back on.
[01:18:22.769 --> 01:18:24.610]  Like Lazarus back from the dead.
[01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:25.471]  It's unprecedented.
[01:18:30.211 --> 01:18:31.912]  America's coming back from the dead right now.
[01:18:33.153 --> 01:18:33.733]  It's happening.
[01:18:34.193 --> 01:18:35.134]  Legend is happening.
[01:18:35.354 --> 01:18:38.576]  Trump's a business guy who hates corrupt managers and bad employees.
[01:18:38.876 --> 01:18:40.697]  He hates the fact our veterans are being treated like crap.
[01:18:40.897 --> 01:18:41.778]  He's taking action.
[01:18:41.798 --> 01:18:42.538]  Skip the break, please.
[01:18:43.579 --> 01:18:45.180]  Let's play the Fox News report on this.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.521]  We have the full report by Paul Watson at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:48.442 --> 01:18:49.682]  Because this is part of the mutiny.
[01:18:49.923 --> 01:18:52.084]  And it gets into the courts mutiny and all the rest of it.
[01:18:56.627 --> 01:19:00.350]  Mutiny, VA hospital in Florida takes down portrait of President Trump.
[01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:13.200]  But the veterans, the key group, I've been saying, need to tweet your photos or actions like this or whatever, going out and veterans legally and lawfully standing up to the bullies and restoring the republic.
[01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:20.445]  And it could be flying an American flag in your yard wearing a Trump is my president shirt.
[01:19:21.186 --> 01:19:25.249]  Whatever it is, just speak out and be heard or do big things like this congressman did.
[01:19:26.499 --> 01:19:26.959]  Mutiny!
[01:19:26.979 --> 01:19:30.041]  A VA hospital in Florida takes down portrait of President Trump.
[01:19:30.301 --> 01:19:33.362]  Photo removed hours after congressman and local veterans install it.
[01:19:33.963 --> 01:19:46.089]  A Veterans Affairs Hospital, and again they hung it where the old photos were, a Veterans Affairs Hospital in Florida sensationally removed portrait photos of President Trump and Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David
[01:19:47.128 --> 01:19:56.221]  Shulkin at the Republican congressman and army veteran Brian Mast demanded they be installed accompanied by a group of local veterans.
[01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.108]  Mast brought portraits of Trump
[01:20:03.419 --> 01:20:05.220]  I'm sorry, my president's Obama!
[01:20:25.731 --> 01:20:32.519]  The photos were removed because, man, if you don't authenticate, a VA spokesman later said the congressman's actions were inappropriate.
[01:20:33.139 --> 01:20:34.020]  Yeah, the congressman.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.542]  How about we fire all your asses?
[01:20:36.904 --> 01:20:38.345]  How about you fire that spokesperson?
[01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.347]  Guarantee you the head of the VA didn't think that.
[01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:47.036]  A VA spokesman later said the congressman's actions were inappropriate and that the portraits needed to come from the VA's central office.
[01:20:47.797 --> 01:20:50.318]  Notice that the congressman brought the official photos.
[01:20:50.699 --> 01:20:56.403]  No explanation was given for why the portraits hadn't been installed anyway almost two months after the president's inauguration.
[01:20:57.663 --> 01:21:02.527]  Massey lost his legs in an IED blast while serving on the Amnesty and appeared on Fox & Friends this morning to denounce the move.
[01:21:02.747 --> 01:21:06.850]  This is exactly what pisses people off about the government is they don't have
[01:21:09.059 --> 01:21:13.563]  That kind of reactionary capability to just fix a problem immediately.
[01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:16.525]  Here we see they made an even bigger problem out of the situation.
[01:21:16.825 --> 01:21:18.807]  It's because they don't want his photo up.
[01:21:19.267 --> 01:21:21.769]  It's everywhere, all over the country.
[01:21:21.809 --> 01:21:23.550]  The federal judges are in rebellion.
[01:21:23.831 --> 01:21:26.433]  Hollywood, the media are all saying, kill Trump.
[01:21:26.613 --> 01:21:30.596]  But they can't get to him, so instead they beat people to death and attack people.
[01:21:32.617 --> 01:21:34.659]  And go run around burning stuff and attack women.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.141]  We sit there and put up with it.
[01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:42.476]  You think they'd put up with women being beaten with American flags?
[01:21:44.697 --> 01:21:47.077]  If white guys with American flags were beating up a Hispanic lady?
[01:21:47.858 --> 01:21:49.198]  But it's okay which other way around.
[01:21:49.258 --> 01:21:51.058]  And again, I'm not even mad at any of these groups.
[01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:52.239]  Most of these groups aren't involved in this.
[01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:55.920]  It's the media and the globalists trying to invoke this.
[01:22:01.246 --> 01:22:02.067]  And it goes on and on.
[01:22:02.087 --> 01:22:05.250]  The good news is Trump's moving to cut half the funding the U.S.
[01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.991]  does to the U.N.
[01:22:06.412 --> 01:22:19.325]  They're moving to get rid of the so-called arts funding, which is just a bunch of anti-American crap, you know, where they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a crucifix in urine or Virgin Mary with elephant crap smear all over.
[01:22:20.146 --> 01:22:23.068]  Hey, go do your own art, find a free marketplace, dirtbags.
[01:22:23.248 --> 01:22:31.333]  Don't steal old ladies' pensions or take farmers' money in audits so you can give billions of dollars to all the communist and socialist scumbags.
[01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:32.073]  It's over.
[01:22:32.133 --> 01:22:33.074]  We're gutting it all.
[01:22:33.974 --> 01:22:35.295]  You can't give veterans health care?
[01:22:35.475 --> 01:22:37.536]  We're gonna shut all your crap down.
[01:22:37.896 --> 01:22:38.937]  NPR, all of it.
[01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.098]  We're gonna pull the money.
[01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:41.819]  See how you like that?
[01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:42.579]  You wanna fight?
[01:22:42.639 --> 01:22:43.239]  You got one.
[01:22:46.902 --> 01:22:48.863]  But don't forget Bow Wow.
[01:22:50.538 --> 01:22:55.099]  Look at the arrogant, shmugness, and little rich bow-bow bitching about the country and everything.
[01:22:55.119 --> 01:22:56.780]  Now, he's a real man.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.521]  He kidnaps women, he says, and puts them into slavery.
[01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.521]  Everybody goes, wow, that's hard.
[01:23:02.981 --> 01:23:04.042]  Man, that's cool.
[01:23:04.602 --> 01:23:06.322]  Man, that's a great family example there.
[01:23:08.103 --> 01:23:09.783]  That's real nice, tweeting right at the president.
[01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:12.024]  I'll take your wife, put her in sex slavery.
[01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.065]  The left thinks it's really cool.
[01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:19.750]  Isn't that sick?
[01:23:20.911 --> 01:23:26.375]  And, you know, there's a Hill article right here where they just say it's all over, thousands of articles, tweets, you can't get away from it.
[01:23:26.415 --> 01:23:30.297]  Kill the president, kill the president, kill his family, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him.
[01:23:30.518 --> 01:23:32.739]  And then leftists go, well he must be doing something wrong then.
[01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:45.868]  And you're all, the leftists are a bunch of wimps and mental patients and weirdos, literally, who are authoritarian, running around bitching, trying to start a war with the most armed populace in the world, trying to start a war with the veterans.
[01:23:47.594 --> 01:23:48.976]  And George Soros just loves it.
[01:23:48.996 --> 01:23:51.018]  He always just sits back and watches it all burn down.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:24:02.473]  Turn on your TV or browse your news feeds on social media and you'll be bombarded with calls about the sky falling and credible threats of violence against conservative figures.
[01:24:03.053 --> 01:24:04.595]  The FBI investigates a threat to kill.
[01:24:05.566 --> 01:24:08.728]  Milo Yosobos for the audacity to want to speak on a college campus.
[01:24:09.248 --> 01:24:13.410]  Threats against former Labor Secretary's wife caused him to withdraw from the consideration.
[01:24:13.771 --> 01:24:18.453]  Multiple intimidation remarks haunted members of the Trump Voting Electoral College.
[01:24:18.693 --> 01:24:23.336]  President Trump has been the target of declarations of violence on a daily basis.
[01:24:23.376 --> 01:24:24.516]  We mean hundreds of times an hour.
[01:24:25.777 --> 01:24:26.898]  But public ones every day.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.122]  What would happen if I called for somebody to kidnap Bow Wow
[01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:36.750]  And then have people gang rape him.
[01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:37.631]  I'm not calling for that.
[01:24:37.651 --> 01:24:39.811]  The media will probably take that out and say I did, but they're liars.
[01:24:39.831 --> 01:24:40.351]  It's what they do.
[01:24:41.812 --> 01:24:53.414]  What if, what if, what if somebody just called for Bow Wow to be kidnapped into sex slavery and taken to somewhere like Saudi Arabia where they like to rape men as well and just kept him in a closet for the rest of his life and raped him?
[01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.075]  Oh, Bow Wow's a human!
[01:24:56.515 --> 01:24:59.036]  Wow, that's a horrible thing to even talk about something about Bow Wow!
[01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:03.497]  But you want to openly, publicly to a bunch of your followers and snoop
[01:25:06.786 --> 01:25:11.789]  Got a new record coming out called, it was going to be called Dead Dog or Road Kill or something like that.
[01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:15.491]  Or Asking to Die was the name of his new record already coming out.
[01:25:16.012 --> 01:25:17.433]  Asking for it was the name of it.
[01:25:18.633 --> 01:25:20.294]  And you know how it works with the Sleeping Giant?
[01:25:20.555 --> 01:25:26.338]  People push and they push and they run around and then they, oh, the bear trap closes and they cry for their mommy.
[01:25:30.521 --> 01:25:31.861]  I mean, I'm not going to hurt Snoop Dogg.
[01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:32.602]  I don't hurt a fly.
[01:25:32.642 --> 01:25:33.522]  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[01:25:35.575 --> 01:25:39.838]  We're just here trying to restore the Republic and we're trying to do it peacefully and we're having some success.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.982]  But Sumner Redstone wants to back old Bow Wow.
[01:25:45.383 --> 01:25:45.803]  That's another thing.
[01:25:45.843 --> 01:25:51.808]  You guys are all commanded by a bunch of 90-year-old people that reportedly elevators don't go to the top anymore.
[01:25:52.868 --> 01:25:57.512]  That's actually what's so dangerous about this is the average age of the globalist commander is above 85.
[01:25:57.652 --> 01:26:04.998]  The top kingpins, you know, done a lot of stuff, made their bones before I was born, done all this horrible stuff, horrible people.
[01:26:06.158 --> 01:26:10.541]  They're now just battling their kids and people to hold on to their trillions that they've got in the aggregate.
[01:26:11.922 --> 01:26:14.664]  And they're just like, whatever, launch full war, Bow Wow!
[01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:15.945]  Total war!
[01:26:15.985 --> 01:26:17.946]  Teach five-year-olds how to have fellatio!
[01:26:18.627 --> 01:26:20.128]  And that's what Viacom does.
[01:26:21.529 --> 01:26:22.810]  Sexualize the children!
[01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:24.811]  Turn loose hell!
[01:26:26.192 --> 01:26:29.074]  There's major movements fighting pedophilia?
[01:26:30.055 --> 01:26:31.096]  Just normalize it!
[01:26:31.116 --> 01:26:32.817]  They'll accept it if we say it's liberal!
[01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:38.140]  Bow wow!
[01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:51.089]  That sounds like a really safe move to tweet at the president who went up against the globalists, the whole New World Order is victorious, rebuilding our military, has the veterans behind him, is cleaning out the intelligence agencies.
[01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:58.274]  You're so sure you're going to win, Bow Wow, that you're saying you're going to have his wife kidnapped and put into sex slavery.
[01:26:58.774 --> 01:26:59.255]  That's what he says.
[01:27:00.035 --> 01:27:01.016]  Sounds like a good plan.
[01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:05.019]  Going to work out for you, Bow Wow?
[01:27:08.783 --> 01:27:15.494]  But see, for so long these people have been doing whatever they want, like John McCain saying that Senator Paul is now a Russian agent.
[01:27:16.255 --> 01:27:20.682]  That is the most over-the-top, 50 times worse than Joe McCarthy at his worst.
[01:27:22.287 --> 01:27:23.067]  It's just unspeakable.
[01:27:23.167 --> 01:27:26.689]  It's total and absolute complete over-the-top La La Land.
[01:27:27.089 --> 01:27:30.211]  I'm going to open the phones up on any of these subjects specifically I've raised.
[01:27:30.251 --> 01:27:31.331]  That's a big cornucopia.
[01:27:31.351 --> 01:27:32.011]  800-259-9231.
[01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:36.974]  And I'm going to say it again, at least in this first hour of calls we're taking.
[01:27:37.594 --> 01:27:39.455]  First-time callers, have a good phone.
[01:27:39.495 --> 01:27:40.155]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:27:40.215 --> 01:27:40.535]  Be ready.
[01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.116]  I'm going to go to you.
[01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:41.176]  800-259-9231.
[01:27:41.196 --> 01:27:41.236]  800-259-9231.
[01:27:47.435 --> 01:28:01.745]  Because you've got organized green lighting for violence and insurrection and burning and looting run by the corrupt media, the collaborator media that is the opposition party and it's owned by foreign corporations that are in open war with this nation.
[01:28:04.067 --> 01:28:14.655]  With the communist Chinese at Davos and here in the US saying we're going to help you defeat your populist movement and saying Europe we're going to help you and they beat
[01:28:15.919 --> 01:28:16.799]  Probably in a fake election.
[01:28:16.839 --> 01:28:21.040]  The polls were way ahead in the Netherlands and way ahead in places like Austria.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.041]  But they're known for fraud.
[01:28:22.101 --> 01:28:24.141]  So the nationalist leaders have not been winning there.
[01:28:24.161 --> 01:28:24.962]  They're winning everywhere else.
[01:28:25.282 --> 01:28:25.962]  But they're growing.
[01:28:25.982 --> 01:28:26.682]  Their numbers are growing.
[01:28:26.722 --> 01:28:27.222]  It's exciting.
[01:28:27.242 --> 01:28:28.303]  But Gert Wilder's lost.
[01:28:29.023 --> 01:28:29.863]  It's a pyrrhic victory.
[01:28:29.883 --> 01:28:33.184]  There's an article on Infowars.com about Clifford Cunningham dealing with that.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.123]  We're talking about the healthcare bill, where that is, and some good news on that front when we come back.
[01:28:41.343 --> 01:28:45.367]  Before I go any further, we've got a big special running on one of our best-selling products.
[01:28:45.427 --> 01:28:49.970]  It takes all the known organic herbs, concentrates them into super concentrate oils.
[01:28:51.131 --> 01:28:52.692]  I just get better with time from what I've noticed.
[01:28:53.673 --> 01:28:56.836]  Instant Remedial Vitality, and it just has incredible response.
[01:28:57.936 --> 01:29:00.338]  Four point, what is it, 4.5 reviews out of almost 3,000 reviews.
[01:29:04.448 --> 01:29:06.771]  I'm looking.
[01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:07.912]  There's it.
[01:29:07.932 --> 01:29:07.912]  2,325.
[01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:09.253]  I was looking at a distance.
[01:29:09.854 --> 01:29:10.755]  So almost 2,500 reviews.
[01:29:10.795 --> 01:29:16.081]  And you can read them on third-party power reviews, sites, and others.
[01:29:16.782 --> 01:29:18.123]  Why folks love it so much.
[01:29:18.263 --> 01:29:19.585]  Why it's working so good for them.
[01:29:19.925 --> 01:29:22.068]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:29:25.632 --> 01:29:27.793]  Supermail Vitality and Survival Shield X2 are awesome!
[01:29:27.873 --> 01:29:34.297]  I use Supermail Vitality and Survival Shield X2 regularly now since mid-December 2016, and I am almost down 50 pounds.
[01:29:34.818 --> 01:29:35.318]  It's incredible.
[01:29:35.678 --> 01:29:36.979]  I have the drive to exercise.
[01:29:37.019 --> 01:29:37.859]  I feel more balanced.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.281]  I am usually sick several times during the winter.
[01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:43.003]  Absolutely no sickness except for a few days of stiffy sinuses.
[01:29:43.043 --> 01:29:43.483]  Yeah, me too.
[01:29:43.903 --> 01:29:45.244]  I plan to be a user for life.
[01:29:45.284 --> 01:29:49.206]  Thank you, John, the Indycon in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[01:29:49.507 --> 01:29:51.087]  Go read thousands of them for yourself.
[01:29:51.188 --> 01:29:51.868]  It's the real deal.
[01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:52.748]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:54.750]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.732 --> 01:29:58.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.215 --> 01:30:05.576]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:05.796 --> 01:30:10.599]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:30:10.719 --> 01:30:13.982]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:19.625]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:30:20.066 --> 01:30:28.671]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:30:28.891 --> 01:30:33.995]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:30:34.255 --> 01:30:40.879]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[01:30:41.159 --> 01:30:45.762]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:30:45.902 --> 01:30:49.064]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:30:49.204 --> 01:30:51.086]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:30:51.286 --> 01:30:56.609]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:30:56.889 --> 01:30:58.871]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:00.872]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:10.408]  In his latest move to cut into the budget, President Trump has proposed killing all funding for PBS, NPR, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[01:31:10.668 --> 01:31:21.154]  This budget cut would include $445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $148 million from the National Endowments, and $230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[01:31:21.394 --> 01:31:25.857]  This budget cut totals $823 million, .02% of the bloated U.S.
[01:31:25.917 --> 01:31:28.798]  government's $0.02% of the bloated U.S.
[01:31:28.838 --> 01:31:30.860]  government's $4.6 trillion budget.
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:36.683]  Now, the tears will start to flow with this proposition, but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget.
[01:31:36.843 --> 01:31:41.786]  And when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit, sacrifices have to be made.
[01:31:42.006 --> 01:31:47.970]  This is just a proposal, so no, your local library or museum is not shutting down, and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:51.632]  As for some of these operations, the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[01:31:51.692 --> 01:31:56.735]  But for those to which it is, this is a warning sign to start making money or start looking for a new job.
[01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:57.276]  The U.S.
[01:31:57.316 --> 01:31:59.737]  taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[01:31:59.997 --> 01:32:02.339]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.

[01:33:02.803 --> 01:33:03.304]  He trolled him.
[01:33:04.465 --> 01:33:04.926]  He baited him.
[01:33:12.981 --> 01:33:14.262]  I wish I was that smart.
[01:33:14.362 --> 01:33:15.442]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:15.982 --> 01:33:17.063]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:17.243 --> 01:33:18.684]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:18.704 --> 01:33:20.344]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:20.524 --> 01:33:21.865]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:21.885 --> 01:33:22.545]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:22.565 --> 01:33:23.606]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:23.626 --> 01:33:25.226]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:26.927]  I wish I was that smart.
[01:33:27.447 --> 01:33:30.049]  That's the Trump dimension.
[01:33:30.589 --> 01:33:30.969]  It's Trump.
[01:33:57.324 --> 01:33:58.345]  And we are back live.
[01:33:59.265 --> 01:34:05.027]  Seriously though, I'm not up here talking about the fact that Bow Wow's writing checks.
[01:34:05.087 --> 01:34:08.648]  I guarantee you he and his punk family can't cash.
[01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:40.672]  You can't organize violence and say, kill Trump, kidnap his wife, sell her into sex slavery, screw Republicans, screw Libertarians, we're going to come after you, we're going to have a civil war, and then not have people simply say, historically the road you're going down, by every angle, shows total defeat and authoritarianism on you.
[01:34:42.597 --> 01:34:48.302]  See, I grew up around people that didn't shoot their mouths off or act tough or go around trying to start trouble.
[01:34:48.782 --> 01:34:57.769]  People that just wanted to go help folks in the Salvation Army and, you know, just be good citizens but also go out and barbecue and water ski and just mountain climb and be good people.
[01:35:00.392 --> 01:35:03.274]  But I, as I grew up, thought, wow, most people aren't like my family.
[01:35:03.294 --> 01:35:05.496]  They're either lazy or they're stupid or they're scum.
[01:35:06.616 --> 01:35:18.423]  Because people have had it so good in this country, so long, that you have multiple generations of people like Snoop Dogg, fake tough guy rappers, raising people like Bow Wow, that thinks you can tweet at the president.
[01:35:21.745 --> 01:35:22.025]  Ayo!
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:32.045]  At Real Donald Trump, shut your punk ass up, talk and bleep about my uncle at Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[01:35:32.785 --> 01:35:41.530]  Your uncle did a video saying, spray police, shoot police, and simulated killing the president.
[01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:43.491]  Do you understand how this works, jackass?
[01:35:45.492 --> 01:35:51.554]  I mean, if you would have said, we're at war with you, Trump, prepare to be defeated, I would say, okay, you are at war with Trump.
[01:35:51.975 --> 01:35:55.576]  Your family is trying to promote people killing him.
[01:35:55.936 --> 01:35:56.777]  See how that works?
[01:35:57.657 --> 01:35:58.437]  See how that works?
[01:35:59.058 --> 01:36:04.700]  You come up and punch us in the nose, and then the left always bitches, like, if we hit back, we did it.
[01:36:06.072 --> 01:36:08.493]  And you have no rules, like that Alec Baldwin.
[01:36:09.333 --> 01:36:15.656]  The media's all like, how dare Alex Jones say he wants to break the jaw of Alec Baldwin, when all he did was a skit about aliens last Saturday night.
[01:36:15.856 --> 01:36:16.376]  No he didn't!
[01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:23.879]  He did this whole racist skit saying black people weren't humans, and then he learned it from Alex Jones of InfoWars, the talk show host.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:34.363]  I'm not mad that that's gonna actually hurt me in the public, I'm pissed that our country's fallen so far that that kind of crap's allowed.
[01:36:35.467 --> 01:36:38.949]  I know Alec Baldwin has some great brothers and people, they ought to kick his ass!
[01:36:39.369 --> 01:36:48.935]  I know he thinks he's the big brother and the big tough guy, and then that Ron Perlman guy says he wants to fight me because I stood up and said, stop calling me a racist!
[01:36:49.975 --> 01:36:51.056]  You damn liars!
[01:36:51.876 --> 01:36:56.359]  Trying to go tell stupid people in the street that you want to organize into racial attacks against white people.
[01:36:56.719 --> 01:36:57.740]  That's what you're really doing!
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.201]  Which will then scapegoat black people.
[01:37:00.902 --> 01:37:01.643]  I know what you're doing.
[01:37:01.963 --> 01:37:09.830]  You're trying to get everybody, like, in a prison in their groups, and then you, the manager, sit up there and play everybody, and social engineers like Bow Wow knows full well what he's doing.
[01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:11.471]  I didn't even know who Bow Wow was.
[01:37:11.491 --> 01:37:13.253]  I guess a bunch of people around here know who the idiot is.
[01:37:14.534 --> 01:37:15.935]  And I guess he settled some court cases?
[01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:16.676]  I didn't know about that.
[01:37:19.638 --> 01:37:19.859]  Hmm.
[01:37:20.559 --> 01:37:21.200]  Sounds about right.
[01:37:24.102 --> 01:37:25.944]  Now we know why you don't like Trump, Bow Wow.
[01:37:30.168 --> 01:37:32.288]  Well, I tell ya, never seems to end, doesn't it?
[01:37:33.409 --> 01:37:34.669]  Never seems to end.
[01:37:34.689 --> 01:37:40.930]  I don't want to go to your phone calls here, but I tell ya.
[01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:46.811]  Michael Savage was attacked in a restaurant, a nice restaurant where you take your dog.
[01:37:46.831 --> 01:37:48.232]  He talks about taking his dog there.
[01:37:48.272 --> 01:37:49.252]  I don't know why he does that.
[01:37:50.572 --> 01:37:51.732]  Guy comes in, starts screaming at him.
[01:37:51.772 --> 01:37:52.453]  He supports Trump.
[01:37:53.213 --> 01:37:59.154]  Slams him to the ground, a 70-something-year-old man, and then attacks the toy poodle because it fought back for daddy.
[01:38:02.065 --> 01:38:04.686]  Now you attack people's dogs, because it's Michael Savage's.
[01:38:04.926 --> 01:38:06.227]  And then somebody else attacked Savage.
[01:38:07.287 --> 01:38:08.588]  Savage got up and fought back.
[01:38:08.608 --> 01:38:09.428]  Other people had to help.
[01:38:09.948 --> 01:38:14.390]  And then Savage was so classy, he said, fine, don't even arrest this guy.
[01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:16.371]  It's in the TMZ report.
[01:38:16.671 --> 01:38:19.112]  But at the top, it's like, he claims he was attacked.
[01:38:19.152 --> 01:38:20.392]  Or other things say there was a melee.
[01:38:20.432 --> 01:38:21.613]  No, he was attacked.
[01:38:22.093 --> 01:38:27.915]  If you walk up and attack a senior citizen or anybody else, if somebody walks up and hits me in the back of the head, I got attacked.
[01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:30.757]  If I get up and kick their ass, I got attacked.
[01:38:30.917 --> 01:38:31.657]  I have a right to do it.
[01:38:32.725 --> 01:38:36.147]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[01:38:36.167 --> 01:38:40.770]  I'm not going to sit here and let people hit me just because I can take a punch or get up and kick your ass.
[01:38:40.991 --> 01:38:45.193]  You assault me, just understand, I'm going to light you up.
[01:38:47.575 --> 01:38:48.176]  Just understand that.
[01:38:48.316 --> 01:38:51.918]  You're going to get lit up because I'm done playing games with all you people.
[01:38:52.498 --> 01:39:01.865]  See, I'm not pushing offensive violence, but you're getting everybody in a defensive, weaponized posture with a culture and people that created the country
[01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:06.012]  Defeated the enemies and do the hanging.
[01:39:07.774 --> 01:39:12.116]  And the thing is, the people that do the hanging don't want to have to kill you.
[01:39:12.777 --> 01:39:15.298]  They don't want to go out of their way and have to kill you.
[01:39:15.859 --> 01:39:18.500]  They just want you to wake up and at least support free speech.
[01:39:18.861 --> 01:39:20.322]  You can disagree with us wanting to cut...
[01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:27.721]  Poor people with middle class taxes and wanting to give $25 billion to the black colleges, you know, six, seven times what Obama did.
[01:39:28.201 --> 01:39:30.703]  You can try to block us trying to get fair trade deals.
[01:39:31.283 --> 01:39:32.645]  You try to block us doing basic stuff.
[01:39:32.685 --> 01:39:33.786]  Oh, I know, it's horrible, isn't it?
[01:39:34.026 --> 01:39:35.067]  Trying to actually make a good country.
[01:39:36.788 --> 01:39:37.949]  But just don't call for killing us.
[01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:40.051]  And again, I'm trying to explain this to you.
[01:39:41.292 --> 01:39:44.655]  I love how punks and thugs always think we say this because we're weak.
[01:39:45.075 --> 01:39:45.996]  Oh, look, he's scared.
[01:39:46.016 --> 01:39:47.417]  He's hoping he doesn't get capped.
[01:39:50.182 --> 01:39:51.143]  That's why I took on Hillary.
[01:39:51.363 --> 01:39:54.365]  That's why I put airplanes in the air over her saying she's a criminal.
[01:39:54.385 --> 01:40:01.289]  That's why I had people get in their face all over TV on hundreds of programs saying her husband's a rapist and she's a criminal.
[01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:04.812]  It's why I had the people that were raped by her clients on the air.
[01:40:05.993 --> 01:40:11.656]  It's why I put up with all the stuff Hillary has done to me in my life, which I won't even get into.
[01:40:11.676 --> 01:40:15.439]  I've been dealing with Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton for 22 years.
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:20.495]  Well, I started getting attacked 20 years ago, and I don't mean just attacked.
[01:40:20.735 --> 01:40:23.700]  I don't mean just fired off a radio station or my sponsors taken.
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.623]  I mean attacked in parking lots.
[01:40:26.886 --> 01:40:28.888]  I've been told, shut up about Bill Clinton.
[01:40:29.468 --> 01:40:30.629]  Shut up about Waco.
[01:40:30.989 --> 01:40:32.511]  I've experienced it, okay?
[01:40:33.071 --> 01:40:34.032]  Oh, but here's the good news.
[01:40:34.492 --> 01:40:34.693]  See?
[01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:36.014]  I stood up against him.
[01:40:36.074 --> 01:40:37.295]  It was enjoyable, quite frankly.
[01:40:37.935 --> 01:40:41.378]  And I know all you guys in your basement go, oh, look at Alex, the big tough guy, he's claiming all this.
[01:40:41.799 --> 01:40:43.940]  Yeah, I claim we reached billions of people and we got the proof.
[01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:45.241]  And I claim we changed the world.
[01:40:45.382 --> 01:40:46.342]  Our audience changed the world.
[01:40:46.703 --> 01:40:53.929]  Our audience of every race, color, and creed are humans, with red blood, one race, one God, one country, one republic, one world.
[01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:56.127]  And we want freedom!
[01:40:56.548 --> 01:40:57.491]  And we want prosperity!
[01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:58.894]  And we don't want to kill each other!
[01:41:01.656 --> 01:41:04.177]  I believe in Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[01:41:04.297 --> 01:41:05.237]  I believe in unity.
[01:41:05.537 --> 01:41:06.578]  I believe in coming together.
[01:41:06.758 --> 01:41:08.198]  And that's not what the system does.
[01:41:08.298 --> 01:41:24.203]  And the evil MTV, and the evil Hollywood, that's the real enemy, force feeds Bow Wow and Snoop, and all these scum, and all these other rappers, and all these other rock star people, oh they're stars, and all these movie scum, saying, kill Donald Trump!
[01:41:24.624 --> 01:41:25.384]  Rape his wife!
[01:41:26.224 --> 01:41:28.627]  His son's gonna be a mass shooter.
[01:41:28.667 --> 01:41:29.408]  All this crap.
[01:41:29.708 --> 01:41:30.769]  Boycotting their companies.
[01:41:30.949 --> 01:41:32.050]  Boycotting their families.
[01:41:33.732 --> 01:41:38.397]  All because there's still some good people in this country and Trump's trying to deliver on restoring this nation.
[01:41:38.558 --> 01:41:40.560]  They think he's dumb he hadn't joined the globalists.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.982]  They think he's dumb because he believes in something.
[01:41:43.002 --> 01:41:44.484]  Because I know.
[01:41:45.886 --> 01:41:46.526]  The pimps.
[01:41:47.748 --> 01:41:52.674]  The folks that are into themselves like John McCain and Bow Wow, they're all about, I'll take care of myself.
[01:41:53.234 --> 01:41:54.416]  I'm not taking care of anybody.
[01:41:55.137 --> 01:41:56.939]  Damn right I want to sell somebody out.
[01:41:56.959 --> 01:41:58.220]  Damn right I want to be nasty.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.082]  Damn right I want to be low down.
[01:42:05.408 --> 01:42:07.110]  What an empty evil culture.
[01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:09.096]  That's been sold.
[01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:13.018]  I mean, they have magazines like Self and, you know, the yuppies are all into it.
[01:42:13.038 --> 01:42:15.800]  It's all about me, me, me, me, me, me.
[01:42:16.261 --> 01:42:23.005]  And when you do that, you destroy yourself because it's okay to have your own things and have your own space and stand up for what you believe in.
[01:42:23.225 --> 01:42:23.926]  That's absolutely right.
[01:42:24.226 --> 01:42:30.030]  But when you get so selfish, you care about nothing around you, you destroy yourself and your own family and you're not fulfilled.
[01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:34.593]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls, but
[01:42:37.887 --> 01:42:40.748]  I do need to just briefly go through these headlines.
[01:42:41.268 --> 01:42:41.969]  Let me just do that.
[01:42:43.329 --> 01:42:43.990]  Some of these already hit.
[01:42:44.010 --> 01:42:44.510]  A lot I haven't.
[01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:45.230]  Let me just hit these headlines.
[01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:48.792]  Sparrows fueling unrest in Macedonia, funding massive Muslim takeover.
[01:42:49.152 --> 01:42:50.012]  Total invasion forced.
[01:42:50.752 --> 01:42:52.373]  That's Infowars.com with all the links.
[01:42:52.433 --> 01:42:54.974]  Violent threats against the president are okay, according to the news.
[01:42:55.734 --> 01:42:58.576]  Globalist score Pyrrhic victory in Dutch election.
[01:42:58.976 --> 01:43:01.157]  Means a victory you win, but you lose the overall war because of it.
[01:43:01.717 --> 01:43:02.657]  Win the battle, lose the war.
[01:43:02.717 --> 01:43:02.997]  Pyrrhic.
[01:43:03.418 --> 01:43:06.519]  Turkish minister claims holy wars will soon begin in Europe.
[01:43:07.716 --> 01:43:14.641]  So now they said, yes, we were activating our political groups to take over your countries, and yes, we're going to take you over.
[01:43:14.701 --> 01:43:20.724]  Just the total arrogance, because if you're in Europe, the Muslims will march right over to you and just tell you, shut up.
[01:43:20.784 --> 01:43:26.688]  If you're videotaping Churchill or anything, they'll come out of the way and say, you have that camera on, turn it off!
[01:43:26.708 --> 01:43:29.830]  And you're not even aiming it at them, because they're used to Brits that pee down their leg.
[01:43:29.850 --> 01:43:31.311]  I mean, the Brits used to be the type of people around.
[01:43:31.631 --> 01:43:32.892]  They've been conditioned to grovel.
[01:43:32.912 --> 01:43:34.192]  I go, get the hell out of my face!
[01:43:34.212 --> 01:43:34.873]  It's on video.
[01:43:35.998 --> 01:43:37.080]  People seen those live feeds.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.482]  They're like, huh?
[01:43:38.502 --> 01:43:39.884]  I'm like, yeah, you want to fight?
[01:43:39.904 --> 01:43:40.665]  Got your fist ball up.
[01:43:40.685 --> 01:43:41.126]  Let's go!
[01:43:41.146 --> 01:43:45.673]  I'm not looking for a fight, man, but I'm not a doormat for you.
[01:43:45.713 --> 01:43:46.214]  You understand?
[01:43:46.234 --> 01:43:48.477]  Go, go intimidate somebody else.
[01:43:51.269 --> 01:43:55.031]  I'm one of those people that comes from the wild Brits that came over here and created this country.
[01:43:55.692 --> 01:43:57.893]  I've not stayed back over there and been domesticated, okay?
[01:43:58.674 --> 01:44:04.697]  And all the men are playing rugby and games all day, super macho stuff, but won't stand up for their wives, their kids, or nothing!
[01:44:04.937 --> 01:44:09.780]  As a bunch of foreign invaders announce, they're gonna put our heads on pikes and our women belong to them!
[01:44:13.242 --> 01:44:13.683]  It's crazy.
[01:44:14.243 --> 01:44:16.985]  Turkish minister claims holy wars will soon begin in Europe.
[01:44:17.325 --> 01:44:18.025]  London Independence.
[01:44:18.205 --> 01:44:19.126]  Just openly.
[01:44:19.907 --> 01:44:23.069]  Give us anything we want or we got millions of Turks and we're gonna burn your cities down.
[01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:26.632]  And Merkel and all this rollover start peeing on themselves like walruses.
[01:44:27.753 --> 01:44:30.435]  Turkey's plan to camouflage its lobbying activities in the U.S.
[01:44:30.455 --> 01:44:30.975]  Daily Caller.
[01:44:30.995 --> 01:44:31.636]  Now they're doing it here.
[01:44:31.656 --> 01:44:34.898]  Oh yeah, turkeys.
[01:44:35.218 --> 01:44:35.819]  That's incredible.
[01:44:36.239 --> 01:44:40.022]  New York Times editorial gives order to white parents stop raising racist kids.
[01:44:41.067 --> 01:44:45.588]  At least 30 killed in suicide bombings in Damascus Justice Buildings Cafe.
[01:44:45.628 --> 01:44:46.888]  Of course, it's not Islamic, but it is.
[01:44:47.368 --> 01:44:49.309]  Just like the latest attack shooting in Greece.
[01:44:50.369 --> 01:44:53.470]  Teacher quits after Muslim primary school students threaten to behead her.
[01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:54.470]  Government does nothing.
[01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:58.711]  Islamic State expands into North Africa.
[01:45:00.751 --> 01:45:03.912]  Donald Trump's latest approval rating popularity is highest since inauguration.
[01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:09.791]  And it goes on from there.
[01:45:10.632 --> 01:45:11.553]  Let's go to the next stack.
[01:45:13.816 --> 01:45:15.137]  Already covered, Bow Wow.
[01:45:15.157 --> 01:45:16.719]  Let's look at Bow Wow.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.261]  Bow Wow!
[01:45:18.401 --> 01:45:22.645]  After mock assassination, Snoop Dogg nephew Bow Wow threatens to pimp Melania Trump.
[01:45:23.226 --> 01:45:23.847]  Get that article out.
[01:45:26.578 --> 01:45:28.239]  He says we'll have her in sex slavery and run her.
[01:45:28.599 --> 01:45:29.720]  That's real manly, man.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.421]  That's really what you do to women.
[01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:40.367]  That's what real, real men... But our daughters have been taught by the MTV culture that the dumbest, laziest thugs are who's cool.
[01:45:41.808 --> 01:45:44.750]  VA hospital refuses to hang photo of President.
[01:45:45.491 --> 01:45:47.832]  Army Ranger Congressman makes on-the-spot correction.
[01:45:47.852 --> 01:45:48.453]  They take it down.
[01:45:49.553 --> 01:45:49.974]  As U.S.
[01:45:49.994 --> 01:45:52.535]  health plan teeters, Republican rebels demand changes.
[01:45:52.575 --> 01:45:53.016]  Thank God.
[01:45:53.888 --> 01:45:57.929]  Yeah, Paul Ryan, the plan's teetering, and your career and your name, Blue Eyes, with it.
[01:45:58.409 --> 01:45:59.550]  By the way, I call him Blue Eyes.
[01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:00.270]  He looks a little psychopathic.
[01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:01.690]  I don't think it's Blue Eyes, but there's something weird about him.
[01:46:02.131 --> 01:46:03.811]  I shot video in HD the other day.
[01:46:03.851 --> 01:46:04.371]  I haven't shown it yet.
[01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:04.911]  I want to give it to you.
[01:46:05.452 --> 01:46:06.912]  Where he's on TV with a blue-eyed woman.
[01:46:06.932 --> 01:46:07.712]  She looks totally normal.
[01:46:07.912 --> 01:46:10.973]  His eyes look like they're, like, neon blue or, like, glowing.
[01:46:11.093 --> 01:46:12.314]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[01:46:12.614 --> 01:46:16.675]  I'm not literally saying he's a robot when I put this out, but, I mean, I'm going to ask, is he a robot?
[01:46:16.715 --> 01:46:17.155]  It's a joke.
[01:46:18.516 --> 01:46:19.316]  It just didn't look normal.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.821]  Secret Service agents under investigation for taking photos of Donald Trump's sleeping grandson.
[01:46:28.242 --> 01:46:32.523]  Can Paul Ryan pull this off or is he headed for a brutal defeat on health care?
[01:46:32.884 --> 01:46:38.045]  Exclusive, Rand Paul, let's smash Paul Ryan's Obamacare, let's bring it to smithereens.
[01:46:38.785 --> 01:46:40.286]  And McCain calls him a Russian agent for that.
[01:46:42.296 --> 01:46:42.696]  Unhinged.
[01:46:42.736 --> 01:46:44.958]  John McCain says Rand Paul is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[01:46:45.018 --> 01:46:45.719]  That's word for word.
[01:46:46.159 --> 01:46:49.422]  Trump releases his first budget blueprint.
[01:46:49.482 --> 01:46:50.663]  Here are the winners and losers.
[01:46:50.683 --> 01:46:51.604]  This is super news.
[01:46:52.865 --> 01:46:54.747]  America First plan cuts deeply into waste.
[01:46:55.047 --> 01:46:55.888]  Bloated departments.
[01:46:55.908 --> 01:46:56.908]  Zero Hedge breaks it down.
[01:46:56.928 --> 01:46:58.169]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:46:59.090 --> 01:47:03.634]  Trump budget proposal killing all funding for PBS, NPR, and National Endowment for the Arts.
[01:47:03.814 --> 01:47:04.335]  Yeah!
[01:47:05.794 --> 01:47:11.398]  Anti-American globalist groups using our tax money, stealing it from old ladies to fund their anti-American crap.
[01:47:11.698 --> 01:47:12.539]  Shut them off!
[01:47:15.221 --> 01:47:17.742]  Report Trump orders State Department to cut U.N.
[01:47:17.822 --> 01:47:18.723]  funding by half.
[01:47:18.843 --> 01:47:20.765]  Yeah, that's only a start, scum.
[01:47:21.485 --> 01:47:26.128]  White House to bring in top NSA hackers so he knows how it all works and can begin taking control of it.
[01:47:26.829 --> 01:47:27.389]  Ha ha!
[01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:28.710]  That's out of the hill.
[01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:30.832]  Over 33 million U.S.
[01:47:30.932 --> 01:47:34.094]  employees' records, including military personnel, had their data hacked.
[01:47:36.127 --> 01:47:37.147]  Investigate Soros.
[01:47:37.187 --> 01:47:38.348]  Senators ask Tillerson.
[01:47:38.388 --> 01:47:39.188]  It's already beginning.
[01:47:39.428 --> 01:47:40.608]  Criminal investigations of Soros.
[01:47:40.948 --> 01:47:41.449]  Yeah!
[01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.629]  Finally!
[01:47:42.729 --> 01:47:43.589]  Win, win, win!
[01:47:43.809 --> 01:47:46.810]  You're going to get so tired of winning, you're going to say, please stop!
[01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:47.971]  I just don't want to win anymore!
[01:47:47.991 --> 01:47:49.431]  I know that feeling.
[01:47:49.631 --> 01:47:51.032]  You just know you're already winning.
[01:47:51.052 --> 01:47:51.772]  You're defeating the enemy.
[01:47:52.012 --> 01:47:53.572]  You just gotta... Ah!
[01:47:53.892 --> 01:47:54.793]  Oh, so fast!
[01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:56.113]  No time to take a rest!
[01:47:56.753 --> 01:47:58.294]  Because there's no room for second best.
[01:47:58.934 --> 01:48:01.155]  Obama tried to take Andrew Jackson off the 20.
[01:48:01.295 --> 01:48:02.915]  Now Trump is busying his grave.
[01:48:02.935 --> 01:48:04.136]  I want to cover that more in detail coming up.
[01:48:04.156 --> 01:48:05.496]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:48:06.735 --> 01:48:07.896]  I got a bunch of other news on this.
[01:48:07.936 --> 01:48:08.376]  The U.S.
[01:48:08.416 --> 01:48:09.356]  health plan teeters.
[01:48:09.576 --> 01:48:11.457]  Republican rebels demand changes.
[01:48:12.158 --> 01:48:12.898]  Secret Service.
[01:48:14.119 --> 01:48:17.980]  Can Paul Ryan pull this off or is he headed for a brutal defeat?
[01:48:20.922 --> 01:48:22.002]  Got a bunch of other news here.
[01:48:22.022 --> 01:48:23.443]  Got a bunch of stacks.
[01:48:24.984 --> 01:48:25.644]  We got the Gibbs.
[01:48:25.844 --> 01:48:27.405]  Was Gibbs behind the McDonald's tweet?
[01:48:27.725 --> 01:48:28.906]  He's the head of the Twitter account.
[01:48:29.506 --> 01:48:30.707]  There's a bear crap in the woods?
[01:48:30.867 --> 01:48:34.208]  Does Biggs admit he's a known liar and lies to the American people and brags about it?
[01:48:34.248 --> 01:48:35.249]  How dumb we are with Gruber?
[01:48:38.439 --> 01:48:39.779]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.560]  Kimberly in Idaho.
[01:48:42.981 --> 01:48:45.442]  Kimberly, come on down to the InfoWar.
[01:48:46.602 --> 01:48:47.482]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:47.522 --> 01:48:48.143]  How are you?
[01:48:48.283 --> 01:48:48.583]  I'm good.
[01:48:50.083 --> 01:48:51.344]  Oh, I love your passion.
[01:48:51.384 --> 01:48:52.604]  I want to tell you that first.
[01:48:52.684 --> 01:48:57.646]  Well, my dear, we're in a total war with scumbag pedophiles, so we better be fired up.
[01:48:59.367 --> 01:49:04.108]  I just have a couple of things I just wanted to talk to you about.
[01:49:04.568 --> 01:49:05.549]  And the first one is,
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:09.901]  Obviously the Secret Service is not doing a good job.
[01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:16.784]  Why can't Trump have his own security people mixed in?
[01:49:17.724 --> 01:49:18.144]  He does.
[01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:19.405]  It's unprecedented.
[01:49:19.445 --> 01:49:21.285]  He does have a lot of former Special Forces people.
[01:49:22.606 --> 01:49:24.347]  I'm not going to leave it at that.
[01:49:24.387 --> 01:49:25.447]  Folks don't know the details of it.
[01:49:26.767 --> 01:49:27.768]  But expanding on it.
[01:49:29.076 --> 01:49:39.804]  They don't have arrest powers, they don't have a power for indictment, and the courts are just sitting there letting this giant crescendo build towards kill his wife, rape her, put her in sex slavery, kill his family, kill him.
[01:49:40.084 --> 01:49:41.345]  Major newspapers call for it.
[01:49:42.286 --> 01:49:47.770]  And so let me tell you something, I'm not calling for this, but some of these people, they're the ones calling for death and murder.
[01:49:49.191 --> 01:49:53.454]  And the way the universe works is, some of them I think are probably going to start getting hurt.
[01:49:53.474 --> 01:49:53.915]  What do you think?
[01:49:55.484 --> 01:49:58.745]  I think they're going to start getting hurt because what goes around comes around.
[01:49:58.765 --> 01:50:01.266]  What you put out, you will get back tenfold.
[01:50:02.126 --> 01:50:02.527]  That's right.
[01:50:02.587 --> 01:50:05.228]  That's why I'm always very careful not calling for violence.
[01:50:05.268 --> 01:50:07.168]  But I mean, they're calling for violence.
[01:50:07.208 --> 01:50:14.431]  So that's offensively trying to organize attacks on us, total racketeering, total organized conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:16.312]  That's worse than murder one.
[01:50:16.332 --> 01:50:17.112]  That's death penalty.
[01:50:18.038 --> 01:50:20.999]  The conspiracy to commit murder is worse than the other thing.
[01:50:21.019 --> 01:50:22.059]  So, you know, here's the deal.
[01:50:22.079 --> 01:50:25.080]  You can joke around and say, I hope somebody breaks BowBow's neck.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:25.961]  I'm not saying that.
[01:50:26.641 --> 01:50:29.462]  He's saying go out and kill, his uncle's saying kill Trump.
[01:50:29.482 --> 01:50:31.663]  And he says, why are you talking bad about my uncle?
[01:50:31.943 --> 01:50:33.143]  He's only saying kill you.
[01:50:33.783 --> 01:50:34.404]  What's your problem?
[01:50:34.424 --> 01:50:35.584]  We're only saying we want to kill you.
[01:50:35.604 --> 01:50:41.606]  But you see these celebrities that are out there saying these things.
[01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:46.434]  They are just completely wrecking themselves for showing who they really are.
[01:50:46.954 --> 01:50:50.118]  And the American people are sick of it, and they're not buying it.
[01:50:50.178 --> 01:50:50.799]  I hear you, Kimberly.
[01:50:50.819 --> 01:50:51.419]  Do you have more to add?
[01:50:51.439 --> 01:50:52.100]  I kind of ran over you.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.462]  Are you going to hold or say bye-bye?
[01:50:54.263 --> 01:50:54.543]  I do.
[01:50:54.623 --> 01:50:55.604]  I just, um... Stay there.
[01:50:55.624 --> 01:50:56.405]  We'll come back after the break.
[01:50:56.425 --> 01:50:57.126]  Don't hang up, Kimberly.
[01:50:57.406 --> 01:51:00.390]  Then Josh, Andrew, Jason, Linda, and others.
[01:51:00.450 --> 01:51:01.050]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:11.636 --> 01:51:22.761]  So outline for our listeners who are in the bustle of their everyday responsibilities may not be fully aware of what Vault 7 has exposed.
[01:51:24.221 --> 01:51:32.485]  Vault 7 really is a very dramatic revelation, a very dramatic exposure of what the CIA has been up to between 2013 and 2016.
[01:51:32.545 --> 01:51:33.345]  That's Barack Obama's
[01:51:37.667 --> 01:51:41.769]  Second term, remember, the most transparent president in American history.
[01:51:42.189 --> 01:52:00.617]  Well, apparently the most transparent president in American history had ordered the CIA to develop hacks into the iPhone, into the Google Android phone, into the Samsung Smart TV, and even into our cars' computer systems.
[01:52:00.698 --> 01:52:05.180]  But what we don't know, and what many of us suspect, is that the CIA
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.402]  I think the president would be wise to clean house at the CIA as soon as possible.
[01:52:24.888 --> 01:52:30.650]  I was rather surprised that in the inaugural week he went out to Langley and kissed their derriere.
[01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:32.471]  I would not have done so.
[01:52:33.191 --> 01:52:34.712]  They are the enemy.
[01:52:34.892 --> 01:52:38.293]  They are the tip of the spear for the globalists.
[01:52:39.014 --> 01:52:50.278]  And frankly, as they brought John Kennedy down, as they undermined Richard Nixon, they have every intention of undermining and delegitimizing this president.
[01:52:50.818 --> 01:52:59.444]  Now, Jimmy Carter, who was one of the most wildly unpopular presidents inside the CIA, was unpopular for a reason.
[01:52:59.825 --> 01:53:02.006]  And it was because he cleaned house.
[01:53:02.467 --> 01:53:14.335]  He got rid of a lot of the people who had been caught by the church committee committing assassinations and spying on Americans and doing all the things that the law of the land says the CIA should not be doing.
[01:53:14.715 --> 01:53:18.318]  What he ended up doing was firing literally hundreds
[01:53:18.638 --> 01:53:23.179]  of senior operations officers in something called the Friday Night Massacre.
[01:53:23.479 --> 01:53:26.540]  People at the CIA still talk about the Friday Night Massacre.
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:32.822]  The truth of the matter is, every once in a while, you need to carry out a massacre at the CIA.
[01:53:33.202 --> 01:53:43.084]  Because the organization becomes too politicized, it becomes too polarizing, and it ends up working against the interests of the President and the country.
[01:53:43.684 --> 01:53:44.705]  And you have to clean house.
[01:53:45.005 --> 01:53:45.705]  My view is,
[01:53:46.605 --> 01:53:50.350]  Every time a CIA leader opens his mouth, he's lying.
[01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:53.373]  So why in the world would we believe him now?
[01:53:54.614 --> 01:53:55.576]  Yeah, put it another way.
[01:53:55.636 --> 01:53:57.698]  How can you tell they're lying at the CIA?
[01:53:58.519 --> 01:53:59.800]  Their lips are moving.
[01:54:17.222 --> 01:54:20.497]  Tell the folks to burn, make the way to fly.
[01:54:30.776 --> 01:54:43.358]  You know, whenever I get up on air and I expose that Communist China has killed over 100 million of their own people, I end up seeing news articles saying Alex Jones hates Chinese.
[01:54:43.678 --> 01:54:45.359]  Okay, because I don't want to kill 100 million Chinese.
[01:54:45.599 --> 01:54:46.839]  I'm anti-Chinese.
[01:54:46.939 --> 01:54:48.660]  Or because I don't like North Korea.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.780]  I've heard, oh, he doesn't like Koreans.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.440]  Oh, that's why my sister's adopted Korean.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.721]  It's like people that don't know geography or history or anything,
[01:54:55.578 --> 01:54:58.159]  Or sociology, or geopolitical strategy.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:02.842]  They just say racist, homophobe, or you don't like this group, you don't like that group.
[01:55:03.122 --> 01:55:07.024]  Or it's like, oh, you don't like... And I do see some of the racist comments on both sides.
[01:55:07.064 --> 01:55:08.025]  Just stop it, everybody.
[01:55:08.465 --> 01:55:10.746]  On the dog, dog, or Bow Wow, or whatever his name is.
[01:55:12.767 --> 01:55:14.208]  This is getting everybody to fight with each other.
[01:55:14.788 --> 01:55:16.009]  But we have to call it out.
[01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:18.390]  And I get back to the disconnect.
[01:55:19.191 --> 01:55:21.292]  He's like, why are you talking bad about my Uncle Snoop?
[01:55:21.372 --> 01:55:23.153]  I'll kidnap your wife, put her in sex slavery.
[01:55:26.854 --> 01:55:39.679]  The entitlement of that, of these, I guess the millennials or whatever, but everybody, where you just sit there and you say, no connection that his uncle's trying to organize the murder of the president, and then that's what he's doing.
[01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:43.461]  He's advertising and he's pushing and he's calling for spraying police with bullets!
[01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:51.264]  And then he wonders why people are mad at his uncle.
[01:55:52.884 --> 01:55:53.664]  Same thing with Snoop Dogg.
[01:55:53.684 --> 01:55:56.005]  I never talked bad about Snoop Dogg and all this thug garbage.
[01:55:56.285 --> 01:56:00.467]  But you like, you want to kill a president that just gave 25 million dollars to the black colleges?
[01:56:00.487 --> 01:56:03.248]  More than they're giving to the other colleges combined?
[01:56:03.448 --> 01:56:04.669]  You're gonna, I mean, you're just an idiot!
[01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:10.011]  You work for the big banks and Viacom and Sumner Redstone to divide this country.
[01:56:10.231 --> 01:56:12.271]  You're the equivalent of the KKK.
[01:56:12.972 --> 01:56:13.872]  And you make me sick.
[01:56:14.092 --> 01:56:17.073]  Hell, you're not even a black nationalist that actually want to empower black people.
[01:56:17.554 --> 01:56:18.214]  You're a pimp.
[01:56:19.025 --> 01:56:19.685]  You are!
[01:56:19.745 --> 01:56:21.506]  You are a globalist house slave.
[01:56:21.706 --> 01:56:23.247]  But I'll tell you that, everybody's a house slave.
[01:56:23.487 --> 01:56:25.507]  John McCain, all these people, say he's globalist.
[01:56:25.808 --> 01:56:33.971]  And all the liberals that follow this, and the Republicans, and Mitch McConnell, and Blue Eyes over there, Paul Ryan, I'm sick of all of them!
[01:56:34.691 --> 01:56:39.633]  Humanity can do anything we want with the technology and prosperity we have if we just have morals.
[01:56:39.833 --> 01:56:41.633]  But if you don't have morals, you can't have a country.
[01:56:41.874 --> 01:56:43.714]  It's why Christian nations are the most successful.
[01:56:43.954 --> 01:56:48.056]  We're not perfect, but that operating system works the best.
[01:56:49.121 --> 01:56:49.821]  Let's go back to Kimberly.
[01:56:49.841 --> 01:56:50.681]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:56:50.741 --> 01:56:51.542]  I'll get to everybody else.
[01:56:51.762 --> 01:56:52.382]  I'll get to everybody else.
[01:56:52.402 --> 01:56:53.002]  I've got plenty of time.
[01:56:53.282 --> 01:56:54.282]  The ice doesn't come on for a while.
[01:56:54.662 --> 01:56:56.323]  I cut you off earlier.
[01:56:56.343 --> 01:56:57.183]  Go ahead and make a point.
[01:56:58.664 --> 01:56:59.024]  Okay.
[01:56:59.324 --> 01:57:14.888]  So the other thing that I wanted to talk to you about also is I'm really glad that Trump wants to cut the UN funding because for one, we have UN troops here that were brought in by Obama.
[01:57:16.368 --> 01:57:18.569]  Well, it's beyond that.
[01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:28.571]  That's in the Executive Orders and in the Military Resettlement Act, and it's in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, and it's also in a bunch of other programs.
[01:57:28.851 --> 01:57:29.591]  But it's more than that.
[01:57:29.651 --> 01:57:33.552]  Our police are going under it with the Strong Cities Initiative that Lynch said is the U.N.
[01:57:33.592 --> 01:57:38.473]  controlling our local police, through the Justice Department is the enacting power, total treason, total
[01:57:39.313 --> 01:57:43.535]  Absolute, it's so crazy I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's really happening.
[01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:44.156]  Absolutely.
[01:57:44.176 --> 01:57:46.777]  So what they're doing is they're just putting our military under the UN.
[01:57:46.817 --> 01:57:48.878]  It's not like even UN troops, yeah they come here.
[01:57:49.098 --> 01:57:52.920]  It's that our military is going under the system, but now that's stopping.
[01:57:54.681 --> 01:57:55.421]  Thank God.
[01:57:56.102 --> 01:58:06.467]  And the other last thing I wanted to say is I'm really glad that all of these Republican people, Senators and
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.824]  Congressmen have problems with the new healthcare bill that Paul Ryan, who is a Soros stooge.
[01:58:17.164 --> 01:58:19.305]  I'm glad that they're questioning that because
[01:58:20.103 --> 01:58:23.006]  The thing is, that's not insurance either.
[01:58:23.686 --> 01:58:25.127]  How can you bail out?
[01:58:25.167 --> 01:58:26.549]  He built in a bailout.
[01:58:26.569 --> 01:58:30.252]  Oh, it's always the corporate looting, because that's the evil Republicans helped ride Obamacare.
[01:58:30.492 --> 01:58:32.313]  It's just what they wanted, exactly.
[01:58:32.374 --> 01:58:35.937]  The insurance companies directly gang rape you, not just the government.
[01:58:36.377 --> 01:58:38.819]  So it's almost as bad as Obamacare, and that's why...
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.182]  We're going to blow it up together.
[01:58:41.222 --> 01:58:41.803]  It's happening.
[01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:42.765]  We're going to get real reform.
[01:58:42.985 --> 01:58:44.468]  But hey, sorry, everything's not going to be free.
[01:58:45.029 --> 01:58:45.971]  It never was, folks.
[01:58:46.091 --> 01:58:46.832]  It never will be.
[01:58:47.413 --> 01:58:48.676]  It's all BS.
[01:58:48.776 --> 01:58:51.761]  Prosperity and free market is what lowers prices.
[01:58:53.374 --> 01:59:01.496]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[01:59:02.476 --> 01:59:11.299]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:59:11.699 --> 01:59:18.620]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.141]  We now have George Soros
[01:59:21.241 --> 01:59:28.445]  As a goblin on the back and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[01:59:29.206 --> 01:59:33.568]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[01:59:35.809 --> 01:59:42.893]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[01:59:43.253 --> 01:59:43.794]  It's powerful.
[01:59:43.814 --> 01:59:44.894]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:59:45.154 --> 01:59:46.935]  InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:54.594 --> 01:59:58.717]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.217 --> 02:00:00.558]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.719 --> 02:00:06.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:06.482 --> 02:00:12.225]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.406 --> 02:00:18.369]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:30.382]  I'm not going to get into any details here, but I've confirmed what we've known for a while.
[02:00:30.462 --> 02:00:36.724]  The Democratic Party, officially at the highest levels, is poking around trying to bring down InfoWars.
[02:00:38.085 --> 02:00:41.546]  We learned about it from our Trump sources that Pelosi
[02:00:44.011 --> 02:00:49.295]  And her daughter were having meetings with Lynch trying to figure out ways to have me arrested or whatever.
[02:00:49.615 --> 02:00:50.656]  And I knew this was good sources.
[02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:55.219]  The next day she went on Fox and said that I was creating death threats for her, which is total bull.
[02:00:55.239 --> 02:00:57.020]  I don't think I've ever even talked about her daughter.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.842]  Other than the fact she was running the thing to get the unfaithful electors.
[02:01:00.783 --> 02:01:02.783]  And so it's just all part of this thing.
[02:01:02.803 --> 02:01:05.584]  And let me just tell the listeners, we have sharks circling us.
[02:01:06.304 --> 02:01:07.304]  And I think this is great.
[02:01:07.424 --> 02:01:08.924]  I've always wanted to fight with these people.
[02:01:09.485 --> 02:01:10.925]  I'm totally committed.
[02:01:11.465 --> 02:01:12.465]  And we're changing the world.
[02:01:12.525 --> 02:01:15.146]  Just know, InfoWars is at the heart of the resistance.
[02:01:15.906 --> 02:01:24.687]  When we say that, I've talked to retired and other current high-level people in the intelligence community.
[02:01:24.727 --> 02:01:25.647]  I mean, very high.
[02:01:26.147 --> 02:01:27.188]  And they've done all the tracking.
[02:01:27.208 --> 02:01:29.008]  They know with the computers that InfoWars
[02:01:30.219 --> 02:01:31.020]  He is at the tip of the spear.
[02:01:31.681 --> 02:01:32.041]  There it is.
[02:01:32.081 --> 02:01:33.483]  Google the flag offensive content.
[02:01:33.523 --> 02:01:34.064]  Top of drudge.
[02:01:34.424 --> 02:01:36.287]  See, it's breaking by the hour.
[02:01:36.367 --> 02:01:37.829]  Used to be every few months, something big.
[02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:40.071]  Then every week, then every day, now every hour.
[02:01:40.111 --> 02:01:44.537]  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:01:45.018 --> 02:01:49.163]  And they decide what is offensive.
[02:01:52.776 --> 02:01:54.037]  All right, let's go back to the phone calls.
[02:01:54.197 --> 02:01:55.478]  I'm going to get to all your phone calls here.
[02:01:55.918 --> 02:01:58.220]  Josh in Ohio, then Kay and Linda and others.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.302]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:01.923 --> 02:02:02.444]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:02.844 --> 02:02:04.845]  First off, God bless you and your crew.
[02:02:04.865 --> 02:02:06.647]  You guys are incredible.
[02:02:06.707 --> 02:02:07.868]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:02:08.408 --> 02:02:20.317]  I just started listening to you guys about nine months ago and really got plugged into basically the correct side of society, how things should be going.
[02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:34.725]  I, looking at the world, I think there's two ways to kill the liberal agenda, and one of them you mentioned, and thank God Mr. Trump is doing, is cutting funding to the arts communities and all this crap.
[02:02:36.546 --> 02:02:49.530]  I was in college in Ohio here, and it would be a 60 degree day in November, just rain and warm weather would come in, and you'd hear all these liberal people, oh my God, we're going to die, we're going to die, global warming, global warming, wouldn't shut up.
[02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:53.670]  And a week later, there'd be six to eight inches of snow on the ground.
[02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:55.250]  You wouldn't hear a peep out of them.
[02:02:55.450 --> 02:02:58.971]  And notice, it was global freezing in the 70s and 80s, then it was global warming.
[02:02:59.251 --> 02:03:07.513]  Now it's just change, and they've gone to 18 attorney generals the feds have under Obama to see if they can start arresting people that don't agree with climate change.
[02:03:07.793 --> 02:03:09.674]  Of course we all believe in climate change.
[02:03:10.014 --> 02:03:15.315]  Their definition means it's man-made, it's bad, pay Al Gore money, and then they'll save you.
[02:03:16.551 --> 02:03:17.072]  Exactly.
[02:03:17.092 --> 02:03:26.260]  And let me tell you, I'm a marketing guy, and from a marketing standpoint, the only time you look at, okay, let's say Pepsi, for example.
[02:03:26.641 --> 02:03:27.842]  Pepsi's been around forever.
[02:03:27.882 --> 02:03:31.765]  They've never changed the name, ever, because people like it for, you know, whatever reason.
[02:03:32.686 --> 02:03:36.370]  Global climate change, global freezing, global warming, all that.
[02:03:36.810 --> 02:03:38.051]  Why do you change the name?
[02:03:38.712 --> 02:03:39.573]  Because it didn't work.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:54.110]  You keep changing it to try and re-jumpstart a new campaign under a new stupid name, and I tell everybody this, if it worked, if it was such a massive problem and people believed it, why do we keep changing it?
[02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:56.992]  And why does the severity get less and less and less?
[02:03:57.052 --> 02:03:58.534]  Now it's what, extreme weather?
[02:03:59.014 --> 02:04:00.115]  Is that what they call it now?
[02:04:00.135 --> 02:04:02.837]  Is that the big term for it?
[02:04:04.966 --> 02:04:05.507]  Here's the thing.
[02:04:05.527 --> 02:04:07.228]  There are thousands of microclimates.
[02:04:07.469 --> 02:04:08.109]  You look at the numbers.
[02:04:08.169 --> 02:04:08.930]  Hundreds of big ones.
[02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.871]  I forget the exact numbers.
[02:04:10.472 --> 02:04:12.153]  The world's always going through stuff.
[02:04:12.354 --> 02:04:14.836]  I just know the real science from what's even mainline science.
[02:04:15.056 --> 02:04:17.018]  They have all the climate science and then they claim it's settled.
[02:04:17.038 --> 02:04:26.788]  But even the mainline astrophysics or geology or hydrology, it's undebated that carbon dioxide has been hundreds of times higher than it is now.
[02:04:26.888 --> 02:04:27.829]  It's so critical.
[02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:35.479]  They believe it's off-gassing because the Earth isn't having as much volcanic activity as it used to, and that just like Mars, we're losing our atmosphere.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.405]  They've confirmed Mars had oceans, you name it, volcanoes, it lost its atmosphere.
[02:04:39.825 --> 02:04:46.174]  Its gravity is lower, it's a smaller planet, and that's part of it, but the Earth is very old now and is losing its atmosphere.
[02:04:46.454 --> 02:04:47.396]  That's indisputed!
[02:04:47.656 --> 02:04:54.967]  It's almost like God set it up at this critical point where we'd have all this fossil fuel to then actually terraform back, geoengineer to survive.
[02:04:55.208 --> 02:04:55.929]  It's amazing.
[02:04:55.969 --> 02:04:56.770]  It's like a movie.
[02:04:56.991 --> 02:04:58.533]  It's like a simulation, like a video game.
[02:04:58.753 --> 02:04:59.334]  I'm getting chills.
[02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:13.370]  The NSA is tapping directly into the central servers of every major technology company.
[02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:16.252]  I'm talking about Google, I'm talking about Facebook, Apple, etc, etc.
[02:05:16.352 --> 02:05:17.492]  It's all declassified.
[02:05:18.133 --> 02:05:19.073]  It's all declassified.
[02:05:19.093 --> 02:05:20.874]  It's all been documented.
[02:05:21.034 --> 02:05:30.339]  And so in this new revelation we learned that the CIA can use, it can tap into just about any device, even use Samsung televisions and use them as a microphone.
[02:05:30.359 --> 02:05:37.103]  So you're sitting in there in your home and you're just watching television and the government can literally be listening to your conversations.
[02:05:37.503 --> 02:05:37.824]  We're good.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.942]  For so long we've known about this, we've been screaming about this, but nothing has been done.
[02:05:55.962 --> 02:06:00.005]  It's about taking away one of the most powerful weapons of the New World Order.
[02:06:00.325 --> 02:06:01.506]  And it's this surveillance.
[02:06:01.686 --> 02:06:02.947]  It's this monitoring people.
[02:06:03.187 --> 02:06:04.528]  It's this information gathering.
[02:06:04.788 --> 02:06:08.570]  If you take that completely away from them, then they're greatly disarmed.
[02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:11.592]  So the key thing is to end the surveillance.
[02:06:11.812 --> 02:06:14.314]  But literally we are in a civil war.
[02:06:14.674 --> 02:06:16.836]  We're in a struggle for- Yeah, by the way, that's not rhetoric.
[02:06:16.896 --> 02:06:18.617]  I keep telling people, this is not rhetoric.
[02:06:19.835 --> 02:06:26.377]  No, it's not rhetoric at all, because the deep state, the globalists, they're not going to roll over and play dead and give up.
[02:06:26.717 --> 02:06:32.559]  They're going to fight for their lives, because they know they're in the biggest struggle they've faced yet.
[02:06:32.899 --> 02:06:36.200]  The second American Civil War has already started.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:43.682]  Now, it's not involving shooting yet, or that much violence, although we've seen the riots and protests, and I believe they're going to get a lot worse.
[02:06:44.182 --> 02:06:51.785]  But it's a struggle between two ideologies, the ideology of the globalists and the ideology of freedom and liberty and the values of our founding fathers.
[02:06:51.865 --> 02:06:55.806]  And one of those ideologies is eventually going to win and vanquish the others.
[02:06:56.006 --> 02:07:05.069]  And up until now, the globalists, they've had control of the entertainment system, the news, the education system, the political system, most of our politicians.
[02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:07.430]  But now with Trump, we're seeing an uprising.
[02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:09.251]  And so people need to realize we
[02:07:09.711 --> 02:07:16.015]  This Civil War is going to take time to play out, and it's not clear which side is going to ultimately reign victorious.
[02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:19.677]  And that's why the maximum effort now of every man, woman, and child is critical.
[02:07:21.185 --> 02:07:22.006]  Maximum effort.
[02:07:22.126 --> 02:07:23.067]  More than ever before.
[02:07:23.347 --> 02:07:28.411]  And now Donald Trump has given us a beachhead, a foothold in the political realm to start making major changes.
[02:07:28.831 --> 02:07:30.892]  But we've got to actually make those changes.
[02:07:30.932 --> 02:07:32.233]  We've got to keep Trump in office.
[02:07:32.353 --> 02:07:35.536]  That's why they're trying so hard to topple him, because they know they're in danger.
[02:07:35.916 --> 02:07:39.499]  And so it's the struggle, it's the fight of our lives, and people have got to put more energy into this.
[02:07:39.519 --> 02:07:39.779]  That's right.
[02:07:39.799 --> 02:07:42.401]  The fight for America and the future of humanity is happening now, folks.
[02:07:42.461 --> 02:07:43.301]  It's really happening.
[02:07:43.582 --> 02:07:44.182]  That's not hype.
[02:07:44.282 --> 02:07:45.363]  It's beyond any hype I have.
[02:07:45.703 --> 02:07:46.204]  This is it.
[02:07:46.284 --> 02:07:46.905]  Be involved.
[02:07:47.005 --> 02:07:47.385]  Pray.
[02:07:47.706 --> 02:07:48.667]  Be politically involved.
[02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:49.588]  Call and talk radio.
[02:07:49.628 --> 02:07:50.149]  C-SPAN.
[02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:51.811]  Support broadcasts like this.
[02:07:52.572 --> 02:07:53.393]  Call Congress.
[02:07:53.413 --> 02:07:54.034]  Just whatever.
[02:07:54.194 --> 02:07:58.520]  Get aggressive because the enemy media is not going to tell you what's happening.
[02:08:19.754 --> 02:08:23.675]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:25.256 --> 02:08:30.017]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.958 --> 02:08:33.999]  We're now into hour number three broadcasting worldwide.
[02:08:34.019 --> 02:08:35.279]  Gabe in South Carolina.
[02:08:35.839 --> 02:08:38.880]  I'm gonna go to you, Jason, Andrew, Kay, Linda.
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:42.601]  We've got coming up at the bottom of the hour, the one, the only, Mark Dice.
[02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:44.462]  I've got a few clips I want to get to briefly here now.
[02:08:46.703 --> 02:08:47.663]  Angelina Jolie.
[02:08:50.538 --> 02:08:52.519]  She is a tool of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:08:52.759 --> 02:08:55.100]  She has pushed the worst UN programs.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:57.361]  She pushes all the Comey propaganda.
[02:08:57.921 --> 02:09:04.523]  Even though I knew at the time, I've since confirmed with people that were on the ground, that that whole deal in Central Africa, they knew right where he was.
[02:09:04.563 --> 02:09:06.144]  They leave him there as an excuse to be there.
[02:09:06.384 --> 02:09:09.005]  They leave the radical Muslims there as an excuse.
[02:09:09.065 --> 02:09:10.526]  Trump's going to wipe all that out, by the way.
[02:09:10.546 --> 02:09:14.747]  I don't want to give away anything, but it's already known.
[02:09:16.128 --> 02:09:18.409]  Oh, there were terrorist camps in this country that have been taken out.
[02:09:19.656 --> 02:09:20.957]  And believe me, that's not just a statement.
[02:09:20.997 --> 02:09:21.477]  That's happened.
[02:09:21.497 --> 02:09:23.039]  But let's just stop right there.
[02:09:23.459 --> 02:09:25.260]  Obama had let some really bad stuff go on.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.682]  It's hard to believe that things have gotten that bad.
[02:09:27.702 --> 02:09:30.064]  But we're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[02:09:30.924 --> 02:09:34.067]  Angelina Jolie spoke at a U.N.
[02:09:34.127 --> 02:09:35.107]  event, and she's a U.N.
[02:09:35.188 --> 02:09:35.528]  envoy.
[02:09:35.548 --> 02:09:41.853]  I think she should be removed from that position if Trump has the power to do it, though she's actually with the U.N., not with the U.S.
[02:09:43.954 --> 02:09:45.015]  He should pressure the U.N.
[02:09:45.395 --> 02:09:46.316]  if she doesn't speak for us.
[02:09:47.497 --> 02:09:48.898]  And she's running around.
[02:09:50.576 --> 02:09:54.998]  Saying that she warns against nationalism masquerading as patriotism.
[02:09:55.278 --> 02:09:57.699]  That's perfect PR disinfo from the anorexic.
[02:09:58.559 --> 02:10:09.583]  Nationalism masquerading like it's like nationalism's fake, nationalism's not genuine, nationalism's bad, nationalism's a bandit with pantyhose over its face robbing a liquor store.
[02:10:10.717 --> 02:10:11.518]  And shootin' the clerk.
[02:10:12.238 --> 02:10:14.820]  Nationalism masquerading as patriotism.
[02:10:15.301 --> 02:10:20.245]  Patriotism is for your country and your rights and your people and your culture.
[02:10:20.525 --> 02:10:23.948]  So she says nationalism masquerading as nationalism.
[02:10:25.849 --> 02:10:29.592]  The word games they play, it's just mind-blowing.
[02:10:29.613 --> 02:10:32.375]  It's a Breitbart article, videos up on Infowars.com.
[02:10:34.737 --> 02:10:38.240]  There she is speaking in the Foreign Commonwealth, the tax office of the British government.
[02:10:38.933 --> 02:10:39.714]  The British Empire.
[02:10:40.154 --> 02:10:40.514]  Perfect.
[02:10:41.174 --> 02:10:42.395]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip.
[02:10:42.415 --> 02:10:42.816]  Here it is.
[02:10:43.996 --> 02:10:55.084]  We see a rising tide of nationalism masquerading as patriotism and the re-emergence of policies encouraging fear and hatred of others.
[02:10:56.914 --> 02:11:03.199]  We see some politicians elected partly on the basis of dismissing international institutions.
[02:11:03.219 --> 02:11:03.799]  She's so ugly.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.003]  As if our countries have not benefited from cooperation but actually been harmed by it.
[02:11:10.444 --> 02:11:17.629]  We hear some leaders talking as if some of our proudest achievements are in fact our biggest liabilities.
[02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:23.193]  Whether it is the tradition of successfully integrating refugees into our societies
[02:11:24.449 --> 02:11:30.111]  Or the institutions and treaties we have built, rooted in law and human rights.
[02:11:31.912 --> 02:11:39.134]  And by ugly, you can see a woman that has like a Barbie doll frame, but they have that weird vampire thing going on where they're repulsive.
[02:11:39.154 --> 02:11:40.595]  I mean, she's repulsive to me.
[02:11:41.035 --> 02:11:46.417]  And I don't want to make comments about her physiology or physiology, any word, physiology or body or the rest of it.
[02:11:46.837 --> 02:11:48.558]  It's just, I'm telling you, I'm repulsed by her.
[02:11:49.198 --> 02:11:50.979]  And I'm repulsed by her actions and what she does.
[02:11:50.999 --> 02:11:57.441]  And then you read about her, the weird cultism and blood and rituals and the darkness, and she's into some really bad stuff.
[02:11:57.881 --> 02:12:00.622]  She's a very lost person, so we should pray for Angelina Jolie.
[02:12:00.642 --> 02:12:08.205]  But what about, oh, the globalism, the treaties, the agreements, the foreign banks, the TPP that hijacked America and sold us out to Communist China?
[02:12:08.445 --> 02:12:09.445]  You mean that, sweetheart?
[02:12:11.526 --> 02:12:12.887]  Your dad's got to be ashamed of you.
[02:12:13.247 --> 02:12:15.728]  He's out there trying to get our sovereignty back, fighting hard for this country.
[02:12:16.724 --> 02:12:20.026]  I don't like bad-mouthing people's kids, but you're in the arena, lady.
[02:12:20.586 --> 02:12:21.406]  You and Bow Wow.
[02:12:22.627 --> 02:12:23.687]  And we're done.
[02:12:24.828 --> 02:12:27.069]  So you're in the arena politically, you're fair game.
[02:12:27.089 --> 02:12:33.072]  And I think you are a evil-looking person and your actions are evil.
[02:12:33.112 --> 02:12:34.352]  I mean, she's always creeping me out.
[02:12:34.372 --> 02:12:36.994]  People like 20 years ago, Angelina Jolie, so beautiful!
[02:12:37.014 --> 02:12:37.854]  And I'm like, what?
[02:12:39.515 --> 02:12:41.356]  A scarecrow with big injected lips?
[02:12:42.432 --> 02:12:44.933]  It's like some kind of albino goldfish or something?
[02:12:44.973 --> 02:12:45.954]  I mean, I just don't get it.
[02:12:46.614 --> 02:12:47.675]  But again, that's the Hollywood.
[02:12:47.695 --> 02:12:52.237]  This is the image of a woman, a desiccated woman, a desiccated woman, a desiccated woman.
[02:12:53.357 --> 02:13:03.002]  I don't mind women that are skinny if it fits them proportionately, but it's just shrunken women with shrunken souls in a shrunken world with shrunken heads.
[02:13:07.664 --> 02:13:08.665]  I am the anti-shrunken.
[02:13:11.906 --> 02:13:14.047]  I got a few more clips of the President I want to go to.
[02:13:14.347 --> 02:13:15.327]  So many great epic speeches.
[02:13:15.368 --> 02:13:18.169]  He's doing the right thing, getting back on the road, energizing the people.
[02:13:18.189 --> 02:13:24.511]  His approval rating is going up, up, up, up, up, even in their fake polls, where they sample, you know, 15, 20 points more Democrats.
[02:13:24.832 --> 02:13:25.752]  He's at 55, 56.
[02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:29.113]  That's 65, 70.
[02:13:29.854 --> 02:13:31.414]  And that's what they know.
[02:13:31.454 --> 02:13:32.675]  He had such a landslide.
[02:13:32.695 --> 02:13:34.136]  It was devastatingly big.
[02:13:35.836 --> 02:13:36.937]  I told you the polls were fake.
[02:13:36.957 --> 02:13:38.578]  I told you they fixed the major polling companies.
[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:41.600]  Our sources didn't want you to know that.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:46.182]  And by the way, I didn't just have sources in Google, or sources in Facebook, or sources in Bloomberg.
[02:13:48.242 --> 02:13:53.204]  You know only a select group of billionaires get access to those systems, and I have people that have access to it.
[02:13:54.304 --> 02:13:55.964]  And so I was just given gestalt numbers.
[02:13:57.725 --> 02:14:00.966]  But you notice it came true exactly as I said, because we're jacked in.
[02:14:00.986 --> 02:14:01.726]  I mean, I'm jacked in.
[02:14:02.646 --> 02:14:04.687]  In fact, most of the time I'm like, I don't even want to know this.
[02:14:04.827 --> 02:14:05.607]  I shouldn't even know this.
[02:14:05.907 --> 02:14:06.627]  Don't tell me.
[02:14:06.647 --> 02:14:09.148]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:14:10.441 --> 02:14:12.001]  And it gets weirder and weirder.
[02:14:12.021 --> 02:14:13.662]  Let me tell you what the real upper class is.
[02:14:13.742 --> 02:14:15.823]  It's people that are dialed into the real info.
[02:14:16.743 --> 02:14:19.744]  And the globalists want more and more info on everybody else, but less and less about them.
[02:14:21.504 --> 02:14:25.665]  Let's play one clip of Trump and then go to, he's been on the longest, uh, Linda.
[02:14:26.386 --> 02:14:31.347]  And then a bunch of other callers like Kay and Dustin and others.
[02:14:34.386 --> 02:14:36.648]  Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii
[02:15:01.588 --> 02:15:03.449]  Here in Hawaii, it's one of the most beautiful places in America.
[02:15:03.489 --> 02:15:09.552]  Part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court.
[02:15:09.572 --> 02:15:10.313]  80% overturned.
[02:15:12.394 --> 02:15:13.074]  81% sorry.
[02:15:14.155 --> 02:15:16.976]  And I have to be nice, otherwise I'll get criticized.
[02:15:17.076 --> 02:15:18.497]  There's some circuits that overturn like 5%.
[02:15:18.537 --> 02:15:22.799]  You're speaking poorly about our courts.
[02:15:22.959 --> 02:15:24.900]  I'll be criticized by these people.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.342]  I wish the President would say, they're the ones that banned the American flag in California.
[02:15:29.002 --> 02:15:30.183]  I will be criticized.
[02:15:33.803 --> 02:15:34.583]  It's that stupid YouTube glitch.
[02:15:34.623 --> 02:15:35.904]  By the way, it's not us.
[02:15:36.344 --> 02:15:37.785]  YouTube now has these glitches everywhere.
[02:15:38.865 --> 02:15:39.566]  Right on the wall.
[02:15:39.586 --> 02:15:45.929]  I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.
[02:15:46.029 --> 02:15:47.910]  I would never want to do that.
[02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:49.430]  Even though they're enemies.
[02:15:49.911 --> 02:15:50.731]  We have a lot of great courts, too.
[02:15:50.751 --> 02:16:00.156]  The judges just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
[02:16:00.256 --> 02:16:01.756]  They literally don't even have passports.
[02:16:01.996 --> 02:16:02.837]  It's like Road Warrior.
[02:16:03.863 --> 02:16:05.265]  Somalia is worse than roadway.
[02:16:06.206 --> 02:16:12.412]  The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order.
[02:16:14.214 --> 02:16:16.656]  That was also blocked by another judge.
[02:16:17.918 --> 02:16:20.640]  And should have never been blocked to start with.
[02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:22.602]  Yeah, the five-year-old could understand the law.
[02:16:22.983 --> 02:16:23.924]  He has much more authority.
[02:16:25.814 --> 02:16:34.759]  This new order was tailored to the dictates of the Ninth Circuit's, in my opinion, flawed ruling.
[02:16:34.919 --> 02:16:36.039]  And it wasn't good enough.
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:38.161]  And by the way, the President's allowed to challenge courts.
[02:16:38.701 --> 02:16:39.861]  It's historical.
[02:16:40.142 --> 02:16:41.262]  That's weird too.
[02:16:41.682 --> 02:16:47.425]  In the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.
[02:16:49.266 --> 02:16:49.827]  Absolutely.
[02:16:49.847 --> 02:16:51.107]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:16:51.608 --> 02:16:52.948]  Linda in Pennsylvania.
[02:16:53.028 --> 02:16:54.149]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:16:55.154 --> 02:16:58.375]  Hi Alex, and that clip is exactly what I'm calling.
[02:16:58.395 --> 02:17:01.756]  I know, I'll play the clip first, go ahead.
[02:17:02.476 --> 02:17:20.261]  He understands that it's an overreach, the courts are wrong, why can't he ignore this court crap and just go ahead and do the ban regardless of what the courts are saying if they have no substance to their cases?
[02:17:21.576 --> 02:17:22.158]  Absolutely!
[02:17:22.198 --> 02:17:26.086]  I mean, we have the judicial, we have the VA, we have all these agencies in rebellion.
[02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:29.314]  Rex Tillerson, they just won't even follow his orders.
[02:17:30.825 --> 02:17:35.207]  I mean, I think it's time, like when Reagan, you know, ordered the air traffic controllers, you know, fired or, you know, to jail.
[02:17:35.648 --> 02:17:36.428]  This is sedition.
[02:17:37.088 --> 02:17:40.090]  And it's fraud for people to sit there and take their paychecks and not follow it.
[02:17:40.350 --> 02:17:41.751]  But again, they're so entitled.
[02:17:41.791 --> 02:17:43.892]  This is the Generation X, which I'm part of.
[02:17:44.572 --> 02:17:47.794]  And I'm not saying we're all bad, but I mean, just look what we've turned into for the last 200 years.
[02:17:48.454 --> 02:17:49.495]  Because we've had so much freedom.
[02:17:49.855 --> 02:17:53.457]  And then the Millennials and Generation Z, though, seems to be waking up.
[02:17:53.497 --> 02:17:53.977]  It's crazy.
[02:17:54.457 --> 02:17:56.058]  I guess they've hit bottom, kind of like the Russians have.
[02:17:56.078 --> 02:17:56.958]  You've got to come up sometime.
[02:17:57.859 --> 02:17:59.240]  But I just don't even know what to say at this point.
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:17:59.700]  What do you think?
[02:18:00.933 --> 02:18:08.559]  So if these courts keep getting in his way, can we expect to see him just say, you know what, we're going ahead with this?
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:09.961]  Well, he is a Republican.
[02:18:10.911 --> 02:18:12.492]  And I don't agree with everything that Lincoln did.
[02:18:12.512 --> 02:18:14.033]  It was a complex situation.
[02:18:14.073 --> 02:18:15.974]  Both the North and South were manipulated by British intelligence.
[02:18:15.994 --> 02:18:17.354]  I want to skip this break so we have more time.
[02:18:18.375 --> 02:18:19.476]  So actually, the whole thing was bad.
[02:18:19.716 --> 02:18:20.896]  But Lincoln believed he was in the right.
[02:18:20.916 --> 02:18:24.358]  He was certainly overall a very intelligent, overall probably honorable man.
[02:18:24.838 --> 02:18:25.839]  Into a lot of weirdness, though.
[02:18:25.879 --> 02:18:39.266]  But the point is that our first president from Illinois and our first Republican president arrested hundreds of judges, governors, newspaper heads, when they openly were clearly not following the Constitution and blocking him during the Civil War.
[02:18:40.566 --> 02:18:45.189]  So, I love how Obama kept saying he was Lincoln when he's the party of the KKK.
[02:18:45.569 --> 02:18:46.350]  I mean, it's just truth.
[02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:47.170]  I'm sorry it's not.
[02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:48.871]  But here's the truth.
[02:18:48.891 --> 02:18:50.992]  The Republicans lost their soul in the mid-60s.
[02:18:51.693 --> 02:18:59.157]  They were the abolition movement to begin with in the 1800s, and then they got the Republican Party in, and they did it all, and Christians were pushing it.
[02:19:00.177 --> 02:19:04.560]  And then the Democrats figured out with demographics that the Republicans were getting all the minorities.
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:08.342]  I mean, the minorities until like 1960s were like 90% voting for Republicans.
[02:19:09.204 --> 02:19:13.807]  And then suddenly the Democrats switched and started saying, oh, we're the party of minorities.
[02:19:14.327 --> 02:19:15.988]  And strangely enough, minorities bought into it.
[02:19:16.008 --> 02:19:20.951]  The Republicans panicked and said, we'll do the Southern strategy, at least in the South, give them some rhetoric they want.
[02:19:21.392 --> 02:19:27.776]  They kind of reversed what Eisenhower had done with the integration and all of it really fast.
[02:19:27.836 --> 02:19:28.636]  It pissed people off.
[02:19:28.656 --> 02:19:29.457]  There was a backlash.
[02:19:29.977 --> 02:19:32.839]  The Democrats pivoted, jumped to being liberal.
[02:19:33.888 --> 02:19:38.069]  The Republicans then kind of pivoted in the South to kind of now being the new KKK in some areas.
[02:19:38.329 --> 02:19:39.650]  Let's just be honest, they did kind of do it.
[02:19:39.970 --> 02:19:41.490]  But they weren't the real KKK.
[02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:43.611]  The real KKK has and always has been.
[02:19:43.631 --> 02:19:46.852]  And by the way, the KKK folks would rob anybody.
[02:19:47.052 --> 02:19:48.692]  They would go harass poor people.
[02:19:48.732 --> 02:19:49.792]  They would take land from everybody.
[02:19:50.012 --> 02:19:50.773]  It was just a gang.
[02:19:51.393 --> 02:19:53.933]  At first it started as a secret army against the Northring occupation.
[02:19:53.953 --> 02:19:54.874]  It was something completely separate.
[02:19:55.374 --> 02:19:56.594]  Then it turned into what it is today.
[02:19:56.614 --> 02:19:58.075]  But today it's a total joke.
[02:19:58.335 --> 02:19:59.375]  In my grandfather's time.
[02:19:59.795 --> 02:20:04.487]  When he ran as an Eisenhower Republican for county tax assessor and was super popular, he didn't care who you were.
[02:20:04.507 --> 02:20:07.133]  If you were poor, couldn't pay your taxes, you didn't have to pay him.
[02:20:08.018 --> 02:20:13.624]  He had to tell people, like, hundreds a year, don't bring pies to my house, don't, you know, don't do this, no, I can't take money for this, no, I can't do it.
[02:20:14.384 --> 02:20:20.050]  But he wasn't, you know, he was a veteran from World War II, he saw people starving all over Europe, fought the Nazis, he didn't like it.
[02:20:20.370 --> 02:20:30.781]  He came back and bucked his whole family, who weren't KKK, but they were, you know, Southern Democrats, and he was so respected, though, that some of them were still really freaked out, he ended up turning them all around, they ended up becoming Republicans.
[02:20:31.181 --> 02:20:37.985]  But, you know, it's just to sit there and know the real history of what the Republicans did and how they just gave it up to the dirtbag Democrats will make your head spin.
[02:20:38.105 --> 02:20:43.889]  Because all of the country's veterans came home, especially in the South, and said, listen, we've got to uplift people.
[02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:47.891]  We can't just sit there and treat black people like animals and do this anymore.
[02:20:48.311 --> 02:20:49.432]  So the Democrats got smart.
[02:20:49.472 --> 02:20:54.095]  That's why there's letters by LBJ written from the Driscoll Hotel where he lived most of the time with his mistress.
[02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:56.407]  Well, I've interviewed many times before she died.
[02:20:56.447 --> 02:21:07.296]  The point is, I can't even say what's in those letters because MSNBC or Colbert Report will take it and say I said it, but go read LBJ letters about getting the N-words to vote Democrat for a hundred years.
[02:21:07.856 --> 02:21:14.682]  And he's liking these letters going, look at these ugly people, their own hotels and restaurants and segregation has made a whole other economy and they're getting out of control.
[02:21:14.702 --> 02:21:16.864]  Well, let me tell you, the Republicans think they got them.
[02:21:17.324 --> 02:21:24.090]  I'm going to do all this and get money to their women and then we'll set up government housing and we'll get full control of these people.
[02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:26.451]  We'll have them voting Democrat for a hundred years.
[02:21:26.471 --> 02:21:28.211]  Don't worry, I got a plan for these people.
[02:21:28.492 --> 02:21:29.492]  And you've seen it, man.
[02:21:29.692 --> 02:21:31.433]  And then MTV and gangster culture?
[02:21:32.013 --> 02:21:32.753]  Folks are gone.
[02:21:33.034 --> 02:21:34.514]  But so are the white people, you know.
[02:21:34.734 --> 02:21:36.915]  Anybody that listens to MTV or this garbage is gone.
[02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:40.877]  And they know exactly what they're doing, and it is pure weaponized evil.
[02:21:41.477 --> 02:21:44.479]  And LBJ, I'm so proud of Texas, but he was a real Texan.
[02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:46.061]  His family goes back to the very start of it.
[02:21:46.301 --> 02:21:48.643]  Some of my friends, good friends, are related to LBJ very closely.
[02:21:48.663 --> 02:21:49.363]  They're good people too.
[02:21:50.044 --> 02:21:51.545]  LBJ was just a bad seed, man.
[02:21:51.585 --> 02:21:56.769]  He was a gangster, a thug, had hit men all over the place, and just a bad guy, man.
[02:21:56.789 --> 02:21:59.791]  But listen, he didn't just domesticate black people, he domesticated everybody.
[02:22:00.892 --> 02:22:04.215]  LBJ began breaking this country's back like nobody else.
[02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:08.973]  And he went to the social engineers and all of them and just McNamara, you name it.
[02:22:09.333 --> 02:22:13.195]  And they figured out a way to screw this country up and to take our strengths and turn it against us.
[02:22:13.215 --> 02:22:13.575]  Go ahead.
[02:22:16.737 --> 02:22:17.157]  Anything else?
[02:22:17.477 --> 02:22:17.917]  She's gone.
[02:22:18.178 --> 02:22:18.958]  Thank you so much, man.
[02:22:18.998 --> 02:22:19.438]  Great points.
[02:22:20.138 --> 02:22:22.280]  Kay in Maryland, then Dustin, Dave, and DC.
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.000]  Go ahead, Kay.
[02:22:24.401 --> 02:22:26.942]  Hey, it's Kay Blaze from Maryland.
[02:22:27.642 --> 02:22:31.604]  I just want to make a comment on the whole MTV and Snoop Dogg thing.
[02:22:32.104 --> 02:22:32.345]  I'm 33 now.
[02:22:33.658 --> 02:22:39.126]  I probably wrote my first rap back when I was like 15 and I was inspired by Snoop.
[02:22:39.466 --> 02:22:47.237]  Not because he was so awesome, because he said some of the dumbest things that I ever heard in my life in his raps.
[02:22:47.698 --> 02:22:48.219]  And I was like,
[02:22:49.122 --> 02:22:54.404]  If he can say all that stupid stuff, and he's all famous with all this, you know, glam around him.
[02:22:54.624 --> 02:22:59.806]  But you know, I've talked to a lot of the top rappers, you name it, those famous founders of it.
[02:23:00.226 --> 02:23:03.247]  On purpose, there's great empowering rap and hip-hop.
[02:23:03.267 --> 02:23:04.567]  They don't let it get on the charts!
[02:23:05.968 --> 02:23:07.008]  Oh, well, it's coming.
[02:23:07.889 --> 02:23:15.391]  I've got a new jam I just made called Trump Card, and hopefully I get the video for it made up this week or this weekend.
[02:23:15.631 --> 02:23:17.252]  I'm just a normal guy with a
[02:23:18.238 --> 02:23:25.343]  8 hour a day job, cranking it out here for my fam, but I woke all the way up once my son was like 5 months old.
[02:23:25.383 --> 02:23:34.329]  I started looking into vaccines and all that, and it just blew, blew the top hole, blew the whole crater where the rabbit hole was, and then I just kept on going down.
[02:23:34.349 --> 02:23:41.474]  Well let me say this, your phone's a little distorted, back off of it, but I'm going to give you some time here, Kay, in just a moment, just back off the phone, because I want to say this, I was talking to
[02:23:42.475 --> 02:23:43.076]  Millie Weaver.
[02:23:43.796 --> 02:23:45.278]  I've talked to Leanne McAdoo about this for years.
[02:23:45.338 --> 02:23:46.779]  We've never had the crew, the staff.
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:49.262]  Plus, when you start playing people's music, they're great.
[02:23:49.362 --> 02:23:50.323]  They sign a deal.
[02:23:50.723 --> 02:23:55.648]  All of a sudden, this happens almost every time, the label comes after us, even though we help launch people.
[02:23:55.688 --> 02:24:00.133]  We're not asking for anything, but they think, like, we must be involved because we're helping launch something.
[02:24:00.693 --> 02:24:01.534]  I have the audience.
[02:24:01.574 --> 02:24:03.016]  Drudge has an even bigger audience.
[02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:08.044]  To help launch patriotic country music, hip-hop, rap, rock, everything.
[02:24:08.084 --> 02:24:08.944]  It's so good.
[02:24:09.024 --> 02:24:13.726]  People submit it to us, but I just don't have the staff and people to get them to sign forms.
[02:24:13.746 --> 02:24:14.967]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:24:15.007 --> 02:24:16.587]  I've had Willie Nelson say, you can play this song.
[02:24:16.967 --> 02:24:19.949]  I've had Shooter Jennings say, I can play this song.
[02:24:19.989 --> 02:24:20.589]  A bunch of others.
[02:24:21.129 --> 02:24:21.629]  I play it.
[02:24:21.889 --> 02:24:25.291]  Six months later, my YouTube gets shut down because the record company hits me.
[02:24:25.491 --> 02:24:27.812]  I got to go find a contract, have a lawyer call them.
[02:24:28.132 --> 02:24:29.473]  Record company tells me no way.
[02:24:29.533 --> 02:24:29.853]  But listen.
[02:24:30.553 --> 02:24:39.544]  I want to have a whole hour-long show every day bringing back good music, not wanting any money on our side, to literally launch this to win.
[02:24:39.604 --> 02:24:40.666]  You are the secret weapon.
[02:24:40.706 --> 02:24:48.315]  I've heard the best rap, hip-hop, hardcore stuff out there that understands the real paradigm that is so good
[02:24:49.136 --> 02:24:52.298]  But then we never have the time to deal with it, contact them, get it on.
[02:24:52.358 --> 02:25:03.523]  So I, believe me, I need a few crew members, I need the funding to set it up, because I want to end up having a one or two hour show every day with talk radio that's like 80% music, where we play everything.
[02:25:03.543 --> 02:25:04.944]  And I think it's going to be a mega hit.
[02:25:05.424 --> 02:25:08.806]  I just have to get the legal in place, because believe me,
[02:25:09.764 --> 02:25:12.546]  Believe me, Willie Nelson says, play this new song just for you.
[02:25:12.867 --> 02:25:14.028]  Record company gets me a year later.
[02:25:14.808 --> 02:25:16.330]  It just happens all the time.
[02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:18.472]  And so, that's what happens.
[02:25:18.912 --> 02:25:21.414]  But believe me, sir, absolutely is what we want to do.
[02:25:21.434 --> 02:25:23.916]  So tell us about your new record, where people can find it online.
[02:25:23.936 --> 02:25:25.818]  Because I want to find the really good stuff, like Joy Vila.
[02:25:26.879 --> 02:25:27.619]  Take her from, you know...
[02:25:28.587 --> 02:25:31.028]  Number 40,000 on the charts to number one.
[02:25:31.048 --> 02:25:32.689]  And I didn't get a dime for that.
[02:25:32.709 --> 02:25:33.709]  And of course we didn't just do it.
[02:25:33.729 --> 02:25:34.229]  Everybody did it.
[02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.729]  Drudge did it.
[02:25:34.989 --> 02:25:36.170]  The point is this is a war.
[02:25:36.450 --> 02:25:37.290]  I'm looking for the leaders.
[02:25:37.570 --> 02:25:38.431]  I'm looking for people that have courage.
[02:25:38.451 --> 02:25:39.551]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:25:39.811 --> 02:25:41.412]  We're in this together and this is it.
[02:25:41.992 --> 02:25:43.873]  And we're going to sink or we're going to swim together.
[02:25:43.913 --> 02:25:46.774]  We're going to the stars together or we're going to blow ourselves up together.
[02:25:47.154 --> 02:25:49.955]  Doesn't mean we don't have problems and people haven't done stuff to each other or whatever.
[02:25:50.135 --> 02:25:50.615]  It doesn't matter.
[02:25:50.635 --> 02:25:51.496]  We're living today.
[02:25:52.256 --> 02:25:55.577]  And the enemies of freedom worldwide are against Trump because he's real.
[02:25:55.877 --> 02:25:56.878]  Make no mistake about that.
[02:25:57.472 --> 02:25:58.633]  Sorry, Kay, go ahead, I'm ranting.
[02:25:59.754 --> 02:26:03.756]  No, laughing and crying, sweating and bleeding, marching, fighting, whatever.
[02:26:03.816 --> 02:26:05.157]  You know, we in it together.
[02:26:05.177 --> 02:26:10.101]  We gotta rebuild this culture that's been crushed by all this garbage out here on TV and the media.
[02:26:11.013 --> 02:26:25.023]  It's nuts, but with the album that I just released, it's my first one, even though I've been rapping since I was 15, but I just carved out a linoleum stamp and manually stamped each little envelope and put my album in there, masked it up, and was handing it out.
[02:26:25.083 --> 02:26:26.584]  Just handing them out, handing them out.
[02:26:27.024 --> 02:26:28.425]  Not charging nothing, just trying to get them.
[02:26:28.445 --> 02:26:29.085]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:26:29.105 --> 02:26:31.267]  What about digitally putting it out or putting it on YouTube?
[02:26:31.307 --> 02:26:32.107]  I mean, what's the name of it?
[02:26:32.127 --> 02:26:32.808]  How do folks find out?
[02:26:34.507 --> 02:26:36.689]  My YouTube name is Daffy Duck.
[02:26:36.989 --> 02:26:40.771]  I got a couple raps on there, Be More Kind, and a Tom rap.
[02:26:40.831 --> 02:26:58.023]  All I'm saying is, I mean, I get stamping out your own records and sending them off to some stations, but really the obvious way to do it is put it out with an article, post your stuff online, and then send it off to folks, and then tell people, I mean, I would put your first few albums out until you hit traction, saying this is fair use, open to the public.
[02:26:58.283 --> 02:26:59.484]  Then you can do remixes of it,
[02:26:59.824 --> 02:27:01.469]  And actually, you know, make money, which everybody needs.
[02:27:01.489 --> 02:27:02.111]  That's what it's all about.
[02:27:02.131 --> 02:27:04.518]  To be able to fund your family and yourself and your ideas.
[02:27:04.919 --> 02:27:05.862]  We in the Liberty Movement...
[02:27:06.687 --> 02:27:12.692]  The full spectrum of that true open diversity need to make money and need to understand it's okay for us to make money.
[02:27:12.972 --> 02:27:22.040]  And so what I'm saying is you should put it out free and then hype it up, get a name for yourself, and then do paid releases, you know, that are even produced better.
[02:27:22.701 --> 02:27:23.942]  So again, I would challenge you to do that.
[02:27:23.962 --> 02:27:25.523]  We're going to launch this very soon.
[02:27:25.543 --> 02:27:27.845]  And I know it's the way to go.
[02:27:27.905 --> 02:27:29.547]  It's just it's a landmine.
[02:27:29.947 --> 02:27:30.828]  It's a minefield.
[02:27:31.268 --> 02:27:31.929]  But believe me.
[02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:35.352]  We're gonna start a whole new YouTube channel, whole new Facebook, so it's separate.
[02:27:35.733 --> 02:27:38.896]  So if we get copyright issues, there won't be a problem.
[02:27:38.936 --> 02:27:39.396]  God bless you.
[02:27:39.416 --> 02:27:40.718]  I appreciate your call, Kay.
[02:27:43.382 --> 02:27:43.822]  Absolutely.
[02:27:43.862 --> 02:27:46.765]  How we're going to defeat them is making art, making culture.
[02:27:46.785 --> 02:27:49.107]  Because I have been in the room with the executives.
[02:27:49.147 --> 02:27:57.835]  I've heard about it from Hollywood, movie people, executives, major rock stars who were in the rooms and were told, it doesn't matter you're selling 10 million records a year.
[02:27:58.595 --> 02:27:59.856]  We're going to put out gangster rap.
[02:27:59.877 --> 02:28:01.258]  I've talked to the rappers that were in the rooms.
[02:28:01.278 --> 02:28:04.340]  It doesn't matter you're selling 10 million, 15 million records last year.
[02:28:04.901 --> 02:28:06.702]  You're not going to put out this stuff anymore.
[02:28:07.143 --> 02:28:09.085]  You're going to talk about killing and stealing and prison.
[02:28:09.943 --> 02:28:12.225]  To get young people to go live like that, to put them in prison.
[02:28:12.625 --> 02:28:14.106]  Now that's premeditated, and that's evil.
[02:28:15.007 --> 02:28:17.869]  Let's go to Dave, Combat Vet, calling in from South Carolina.
[02:28:17.889 --> 02:28:18.609]  Thanks for holding, Dave.
[02:28:20.151 --> 02:28:21.552]  Yeah, hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[02:28:21.612 --> 02:28:22.092]  Good, my friend.
[02:28:23.293 --> 02:28:23.753]  Good, hey.
[02:28:24.234 --> 02:28:29.237]  Went to the Veteran Center, I mean, Veteran Hospital yesterday in Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:28:29.698 --> 02:28:31.519]  Kind of resonated with what you were talking about.
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:35.622]  The VA, kind of enemy in the gate, so to speak.
[02:28:35.662 --> 02:28:36.843]  Not at the gate, but in the gate.
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.743]  The people, man, they're just so different right now.
[02:28:41.823 --> 02:28:49.451]  One of the guys in the waiting room, in the emergency room, one of the guys was like, oh, that Donald Trump, man, that's a terrible man.
[02:28:51.113 --> 02:28:53.616]  Was that one of the veterans or one of the employees?
[02:28:54.457 --> 02:28:55.477]  One of the employees.
[02:28:55.497 --> 02:28:56.097]  Yo, here's the deal.
[02:28:56.498 --> 02:28:57.398]  They've been lazy.
[02:28:57.438 --> 02:28:58.058]  They've been bad.
[02:28:58.098 --> 02:28:58.998]  They've got death lists.
[02:28:59.058 --> 02:29:01.119]  Obama put them in computers to literally kill people.
[02:29:01.539 --> 02:29:02.499]  So they're executioners.
[02:29:02.519 --> 02:29:04.760]  They're the social engineers over the vets.
[02:29:04.860 --> 02:29:05.900]  They keep the eye on you.
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:06.801]  They take your rights.
[02:29:07.181 --> 02:29:08.081]  You're the enemy.
[02:29:08.141 --> 02:29:09.321]  They are the enemy within the gates.
[02:29:09.361 --> 02:29:10.962]  Not all of them, but the institution.
[02:29:11.502 --> 02:29:14.363]  So they want to test you and try to bully you.
[02:29:14.723 --> 02:29:16.423]  So what you do is you videotape it.
[02:29:16.463 --> 02:29:17.364]  You hidden camera it.
[02:29:17.584 --> 02:29:19.324]  You show the Trump sign isn't up.
[02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:20.384]  You're the vets.
[02:29:20.465 --> 02:29:21.845]  This is the real fight for the homeland.
[02:29:22.245 --> 02:29:24.166]  You get that out, you'll go to the next level.
[02:29:24.186 --> 02:29:24.987]  Let me come right back to you.
[02:29:25.007 --> 02:29:31.971]  I want to hear this, Dave, and then we're going to, of course, the great American and media analyst, Mark Dice, reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[02:29:32.852 --> 02:29:33.452]  So exciting.
[02:29:33.492 --> 02:29:36.454]  After we talk today, we'll talk to Dustin, DC, Chris, Patrick, and others.
[02:29:36.474 --> 02:29:37.995]  I got more Trump clips coming up.
[02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:39.435]  And who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:29:39.656 --> 02:29:42.277]  It's Anthony Cumia from New York City!
[02:29:42.818 --> 02:29:47.080]  Nothing more Americana than New York City when the people of New York are for America.
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:49.702]  It's Blue Ribbon Pride, straight ahead.
[02:29:51.714 --> 02:29:54.736]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.657 --> 02:29:58.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.263 --> 02:30:07.646]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:30:07.746 --> 02:30:18.694]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:30:18.834 --> 02:30:23.757]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:30:23.877 --> 02:30:26.398]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:30:26.458 --> 02:30:27.959]  It helps detoxify.
[02:30:28.179 --> 02:30:31.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:35.803]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:30:35.823 --> 02:30:39.965]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:30:40.385 --> 02:30:47.390]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:30:47.511 --> 02:30:48.952]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:30:49.132 --> 02:30:49.872]  This is so key.
[02:30:50.112 --> 02:30:54.416]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:30:54.456 --> 02:30:56.537]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:30:56.657 --> 02:31:00.120]  Exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:13.146 --> 02:31:21.072]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:21.132 --> 02:31:24.215]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:31:25.029 --> 02:31:26.871]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:31:26.891 --> 02:31:27.211]  Exactly.
[02:31:27.231 --> 02:31:29.013]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[02:31:29.053 --> 02:31:32.376]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[02:31:32.416 --> 02:31:33.698]  We've both talked to them.
[02:31:33.878 --> 02:31:42.847]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[02:31:43.728 --> 02:31:44.829]  We refuse to screw people.
[02:31:45.169 --> 02:31:46.150]  We refuse to do that.
[02:31:46.511 --> 02:31:48.493]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:55.766]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:31:56.167 --> 02:31:56.929]  It's a win-win.
[02:31:57.410 --> 02:31:58.171]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:03.419 --> 02:32:07.863]  Monsanto's weed killer Roundup is one of the most used agricultural products around the planet.
[02:32:08.143 --> 02:32:12.888]  Its main ingredient, glyphosate, has been controversial as it has been linked to cancer.
[02:32:13.088 --> 02:32:17.652]  In a new lawsuit, Monsanto has been accused of manipulating research to hide the dangers of Roundup.
[02:32:17.772 --> 02:32:27.881]  Yolanda Mendoza, a regular user of Roundup with stage 4 cancer, is one of hundreds suing Monsanto, citing a World Health Organization study that says glyphosate is probably carcinogenic.
[02:32:27.961 --> 02:32:35.703]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge declaring the state legally require Roundup to warn its consumers of the potential to cause cancer.
[02:32:35.883 --> 02:32:38.304]  Remember this from a Monsanto lobbyist.
[02:32:38.484 --> 02:32:42.986]  I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[02:32:43.046 --> 02:32:45.927]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[02:32:45.967 --> 02:32:46.827]  You want to drink some?
[02:32:46.867 --> 02:32:47.627]  We have some here.
[02:32:47.687 --> 02:32:48.848]  I'd be happy to, actually.
[02:32:49.388 --> 02:32:51.008]  Not really, but... Tell the truth.
[02:32:51.068 --> 02:32:52.409]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[02:32:52.629 --> 02:32:53.329]  No, it's not.
[02:32:53.489 --> 02:32:55.670]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[02:32:55.770 --> 02:32:56.490]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[02:32:56.730 --> 02:33:00.052]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's Roundup.
[02:33:00.192 --> 02:33:02.513]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:33:05.615 --> 02:33:07.196]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:07.516 --> 02:33:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.461 --> 02:33:20.023]  Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while.
[02:33:21.524 --> 02:33:25.767]  I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile.
[02:33:31.512 --> 02:33:37.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, or M4's Live as we call it.
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:40.401]  Anthony Comey is coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:33:40.882 --> 02:33:44.144]  Mark Dice is a guy that after the show, I'm talking to him on the phone.
[02:33:44.865 --> 02:33:48.227]  I'm saying, Mark, you need to come to Austin, even if you don't want to come work with us or leave San Diego.
[02:33:49.648 --> 02:33:54.232]  We want to put your talents to work here with a whole crew and actually get you syndicated on radio and kick ass.
[02:33:54.252 --> 02:33:55.893]  I know he's got his own life there, his own thing he's doing.
[02:33:55.913 --> 02:33:58.435]  He's like, I can't come to Austin, he told my producer today.
[02:33:58.715 --> 02:34:00.176]  I'm busy doing laundry and stuff.
[02:34:00.256 --> 02:34:00.777]  That's a quote.
[02:34:01.516 --> 02:34:03.677]  Well, I'm going to make Watson probably move here, too.
[02:34:04.377 --> 02:34:05.878]  Watson actually works for me for 16 years.
[02:34:06.318 --> 02:34:09.940]  I want Mark Dice to work with us because, again, he's very talented.
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.141]  He needs a crew behind him.
[02:34:11.161 --> 02:34:13.242]  He can even keep his apartment in San Diego.
[02:34:13.262 --> 02:34:14.783]  He can fly back there a couple months out of the year.
[02:34:16.926 --> 02:34:19.967]  But it's just crazy because we need to promote the best people out there.
[02:34:19.987 --> 02:34:20.827]  But he's doing a great job.
[02:34:21.388 --> 02:34:22.928]  He does a great media analysis.
[02:34:23.428 --> 02:34:26.950]  We played it last night in our expanded coverage where he just destroyed Rachel Maddow.
[02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:28.590]  But what's great is he did it first.
[02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:29.771]  He's like right on it.
[02:34:30.511 --> 02:34:31.631]  It's kind of good he's on the West Coast.
[02:34:31.651 --> 02:34:33.772]  He's a little bit, you know, earlier over there.
[02:34:34.072 --> 02:34:35.993]  Later here he gets out stuff that other people don't.
[02:34:37.132 --> 02:34:38.694]  Very exciting to see what he's doing.
[02:34:58.689 --> 02:35:00.770]  Two things really quick before I lose my train of thought.
[02:35:00.810 --> 02:35:03.591]  Where do I take all the pictures and all the stories I've got?
[02:35:03.631 --> 02:35:05.271]  Because they seem to be lost in translation.
[02:35:05.291 --> 02:35:06.411]  We can't seem to get them anywhere.
[02:35:28.044 --> 02:35:30.485]  My whole unit, we've been struggling a lot trying to get stuff anymore.
[02:35:30.505 --> 02:35:32.605]  Do you have any?
[02:35:32.825 --> 02:35:40.307]  One problem in America is the telephones are so bad now, but I'm saying, are you trying to send us pictures or videos?
[02:35:40.387 --> 02:35:41.608]  I don't know who to send it to.
[02:35:41.928 --> 02:35:43.768]  Yes, send it to Trump Support.
[02:35:43.968 --> 02:35:45.168]  That's where vets send us tips.
[02:35:45.729 --> 02:35:48.149]  Trump Support at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:48.169 --> 02:35:48.929]  We're adding new photos.
[02:35:48.949 --> 02:35:49.790]  We should show it right now.
[02:35:50.650 --> 02:35:51.970]  Every day we're going to create a special link.
[02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:53.411]  We have an article right now about it.
[02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:54.731]  National movement launched.
[02:35:55.251 --> 02:35:57.212]  About troops and veterans to support Trump.
[02:35:57.572 --> 02:35:59.333]  And we're going to create a whole webpage, a whole section.
[02:35:59.353 --> 02:36:00.354]  We have an article right now.
[02:36:00.374 --> 02:36:02.955]  In fact, if you guys go ask Don, we can put it on screen.
[02:36:02.975 --> 02:36:05.557]  And we're going to be adding more photos of troops supporting Trump.
[02:36:05.857 --> 02:36:07.178]  We're going to be doing articles about it.
[02:36:07.578 --> 02:36:13.861]  But just like this veteran congressman goes in with both his legs blown off and puts the sign up, you know, there in Palm Beach, Florida.
[02:36:14.341 --> 02:36:15.442]  That's what veterans can do.
[02:36:15.482 --> 02:36:17.403]  It's not just send us photos saying you support Trump.
[02:36:17.603 --> 02:36:18.824]  It's whatever you think's best.
[02:36:19.798 --> 02:36:22.239]  InfoWars mobilizes grassroots military support for Trump.
[02:36:22.279 --> 02:36:25.801]  Send your photos to TrumpSupport at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:26.441 --> 02:36:28.202]  And that's the article from yesterday.
[02:36:28.222 --> 02:36:29.503]  There's going to be new articles all the time.
[02:36:29.543 --> 02:36:30.283]  You scroll through it.
[02:36:30.624 --> 02:36:32.365]  You see the troops doing it.
[02:36:32.445 --> 02:36:38.067]  You know, famous Navy SEALs, heads of SEAL teams, you name it, coming on the broadcast.
[02:36:38.708 --> 02:36:39.928]  You know, such elite troops.
[02:36:39.948 --> 02:36:41.349]  They can't even tell you what units they were in.
[02:36:41.689 --> 02:36:44.771]  And then just all doing basic stuff and saying, look, we know he's not a Russian agent.
[02:36:46.172 --> 02:36:53.015]  We know that McCain's wrong, saying that Senator Rand Paul's a Russian agent, saying we're going to have war with Russia.
[02:36:53.035 --> 02:36:56.356]  I mean, it's those small steps.
[02:36:56.537 --> 02:36:57.157]  I'm with Trump.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.902]  Let these folks know, they don't speak for you.
[02:37:01.202 --> 02:37:02.423]  And will InfoWars save the world?
[02:37:02.643 --> 02:37:03.564]  Will each vet save the world?
[02:37:03.604 --> 02:37:03.744]  No.
[02:37:03.804 --> 02:37:05.385]  But together, we'll do it.
[02:37:05.425 --> 02:37:06.185]  Dave, God bless you.
[02:37:29.041 --> 02:37:35.525]  I told Paul five, six years ago, you're going to do weekly videos, you're going to come on, you're going to tweet, or I'm going to cut your pay in half.
[02:37:35.605 --> 02:37:36.705]  I pay Paul well, he deserves it.
[02:37:37.306 --> 02:37:38.327]  He said, OK, Alex.
[02:37:38.367 --> 02:37:39.487]  And I sent him the map.
[02:37:39.827 --> 02:37:41.028]  He's better than I am on air.
[02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:42.069]  Let's just admit it.
[02:37:42.629 --> 02:37:43.670]  At least to many audiences.
[02:37:45.111 --> 02:37:46.712]  Mark's as good as I am or better in many ways.
[02:37:47.052 --> 02:37:50.634]  OK, so I said, Mark, stop trying to have national TV shows.
[02:37:50.654 --> 02:37:51.295]  You've already have them.
[02:37:51.315 --> 02:37:51.995]  They don't do anything.
[02:37:52.075 --> 02:37:52.676]  I've done them too.
[02:37:53.036 --> 02:37:53.796]  Be yourself.
[02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:54.697]  You will dominate.
[02:37:55.718 --> 02:37:56.558]  I'm not bragging here.
[02:37:56.598 --> 02:37:57.279]  Now I'm telling Mark.
[02:37:58.390 --> 02:37:59.011]  Move to Texas.
[02:38:00.032 --> 02:38:00.693]  Set you up good.
[02:38:01.073 --> 02:38:02.695]  You can run your own awesome program.
[02:38:02.995 --> 02:38:04.197]  You can share in the victory.
[02:38:04.617 --> 02:38:05.078]  We need him.
[02:38:05.178 --> 02:38:08.161]  Because I don't have the money or crew to set up in San Diego.
[02:38:08.702 --> 02:38:10.664]  I need the best minds, and Mark Dice is one of them.
[02:38:10.724 --> 02:38:12.246]  And I just thought I'd go ahead and say it on air.
[02:38:12.266 --> 02:38:13.727]  There's total transparency here.
[02:38:13.748 --> 02:38:15.630]  I can't even get Mark out here, though.
[02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:17.912]  So find out what you're going to lose, Mark, if you come out here.
[02:38:17.932 --> 02:38:19.013]  You're coming out here in the next few weeks.
[02:38:19.274 --> 02:38:20.755]  Paul's coming here in a few weeks, for two weeks.
[02:38:21.076 --> 02:38:22.898]  You must come to the mothership.
[02:38:23.498 --> 02:38:23.999]  I want you here.
[02:38:24.299 --> 02:38:26.241]  Not to, like, be under my even command.
[02:38:26.982 --> 02:38:27.362]  You're smart.
[02:38:27.382 --> 02:38:28.424]  You don't say stuff you can get sued for.
[02:38:28.564 --> 02:38:29.905]  The kind of guy I need is like an editor.
[02:38:30.185 --> 02:38:32.108]  I want to build a whole other mothership, see.
[02:38:32.448 --> 02:38:33.729]  I want a big mothership factory.
[02:38:33.769 --> 02:38:35.331]  Not that I'm in charge of one mothership.
[02:38:35.491 --> 02:38:35.992]  They can blow that up.
[02:38:36.332 --> 02:38:37.433]  I want to have a big...
[02:38:38.314 --> 02:38:39.234]  Mothership factory.
[02:38:39.254 --> 02:38:41.555]  See, but I need somebody that can command a mothership.
[02:38:41.995 --> 02:38:44.636]  There's only Drudge and InfoWars and Breitbart.
[02:38:45.057 --> 02:38:45.977]  The others aren't even motherships.
[02:38:45.997 --> 02:38:47.097]  We need motherships.
[02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:51.379]  We need command, attack, information, warfare, aircraft carriers.
[02:38:51.739 --> 02:38:52.099]  You understand?
[02:38:52.119 --> 02:38:53.360]  We need weapons platforms.
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:54.200]  We need leaders.
[02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:56.881]  I need you to join the InfoWar, Mark Dice.
[02:38:56.901 --> 02:38:58.222]  You've been a big part of it, but now's the time.
[02:38:58.382 --> 02:38:58.922]  I know I'm ranting.
[02:38:58.942 --> 02:38:59.142]  Go ahead.
[02:39:00.233 --> 02:39:07.519]  Yeah, I thought you'd really made it when Hillary Clinton called you out, but I think it's almost as big of a badge of honor to get called out by Saturday Night Live.
[02:39:07.539 --> 02:39:12.883]  And that just goes to show that they finally are really admitting that they're losing the information war.
[02:39:13.103 --> 02:39:25.593]  And Rachel Maddow's pathetic stunts with her bombshell Donald Trump tax returns, not only was it an absolute egg on her face instance, really eclipsing Geraldo's
[02:39:26.193 --> 02:39:26.754]  We're good to go.
[02:39:45.148 --> 02:39:45.428]  I think so.
[02:39:57.370 --> 02:40:19.573]  She goes on last night on Jimmy Fallon the Tonight Show to not to make fun of herself for over hyping this, not to apologize for this ridiculous clickbait tweet that she sent out hyping up her event, but to actually brag and be egged on and encouraged by Jimmy Fallon about how this was still some supposed big bombshell story.
[02:40:19.973 --> 02:40:21.254]  They, this isn't news.
[02:40:21.294 --> 02:40:21.995]  They're not news.
[02:40:22.255 --> 02:40:23.876]  These are enemy propaganda.
[02:40:23.916 --> 02:40:25.157]  They are conscious, exactly.
[02:40:25.197 --> 02:40:26.278]  That's a great point I hadn't thought of.
[02:40:26.498 --> 02:40:28.420]  They're still trying to sell a dead corpse.
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:29.480]  Everybody's laughing at her.
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:39.348]  The arrogance level of even after they've taken a fraud, sold a hoax, they're now regurgitating the same fraud in a confidence game and it's not working.
[02:40:39.608 --> 02:40:40.769]  What the hell's their problem?
[02:40:41.963 --> 02:40:47.766]  Their audience has become children, and that's why people are flocking to the alternative sources.
[02:40:47.846 --> 02:40:49.707]  That's why people are getting so popular.
[02:40:49.767 --> 02:40:59.212]  Smaller, you know, people like me over the last 10 years have been just slowly chugging along, chugging along like a little engine that could, and now getting some decent viewers, and they're absolutely scrambling.
[02:40:59.452 --> 02:40:59.993]  Ah, come on.
[02:41:00.133 --> 02:41:00.853]  Decent viewers.
[02:41:00.893 --> 02:41:02.054]  You have millions a week.
[02:41:02.754 --> 02:41:03.495]  Please stop.
[02:41:03.615 --> 02:41:04.796]  We're not trying to brag.
[02:41:04.816 --> 02:41:05.336]  I want to be clear.
[02:41:05.356 --> 02:41:06.437]  This isn't about bragging.
[02:41:06.838 --> 02:41:08.259]  But we're bigger than they are.
[02:41:08.619 --> 02:41:12.202]  Drudge is the biggest website in the world, after MSM.
[02:41:12.242 --> 02:41:12.763]  It's number two.
[02:41:12.943 --> 02:41:16.066]  And MSM is like billions of emails or something, so it's not even, it's all BS.
[02:41:16.406 --> 02:41:17.587]  Drudge is the biggest thing in the world!
[02:41:18.288 --> 02:41:21.250]  And they have articles every week, Drudge is dead, Drudge is nothing.
[02:41:21.511 --> 02:41:28.337]  We need to celebrate the fact that we, in the marketplace of ideas, we've won the Super Bowl over and over again, like the Patriots.
[02:41:28.919 --> 02:41:29.759]  There's such phonies.
[02:41:29.819 --> 02:41:36.821]  If you look at some of the CNN hosts and even, you know, some of the folks in the other media outlets, like Geraldo Rivera, he barely has 100,000 Twitter followers.
[02:41:37.201 --> 02:41:45.603]  Someone like the Cuomo over at CNN, he, Chris Cuomo, he has supposedly a million Twitter followers, but he barely has any.
[02:41:45.623 --> 02:41:48.144]  What, 97% of Obama's and Michelle's were fake?
[02:41:48.866 --> 02:41:50.228]  He can barely get a dozen.
[02:41:50.348 --> 02:41:52.410]  I can buy a million Twitter followers tomorrow.
[02:41:52.450 --> 02:41:54.032]  Paul Watson has like 500,000.
[02:41:54.132 --> 02:41:57.675]  I have like 700,000 or something on our channels, or more than that, all of them.
[02:41:57.956 --> 02:42:01.459]  Point is, he has more than the BBC combined in actual reading impressions.
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:02.821]  And now they're starting to block it.
[02:42:02.841 --> 02:42:04.983]  We have to get into censorship though, because here's the deal.
[02:42:05.023 --> 02:42:06.725]  We're kicking their butt up one side and down the other.
[02:42:06.985 --> 02:42:07.746]  They're striking back.
[02:42:08.942 --> 02:42:15.908]  Yeah, and first they tried with the fake news, that didn't work, that backfired, and now they're kind of even regretful that they even launched that term.
[02:42:15.948 --> 02:42:23.254]  And even Jake Tapper, another fake news analyst over at CNN, is admitting that his seven-year-old son calls him fake news in order to taunt him.
[02:42:23.314 --> 02:42:27.417]  And so they kind of regret concocting this label.
[02:42:27.777 --> 02:42:28.858]  But let me ask you that.
[02:42:29.138 --> 02:42:32.101]  Why do you think you're popular with, like,
[02:42:33.723 --> 02:42:38.825]  When I found 30 and up like I am, which is a key thinking demographic up to old folks.
[02:42:39.185 --> 02:42:42.226]  But let's just face it, Paul Watts and people like that are super hot.
[02:42:42.246 --> 02:42:44.587]  People like 10 years old to about 20 or 18.
[02:42:45.087 --> 02:42:46.588]  That's the demographic the Globals really want.
[02:42:47.228 --> 02:42:51.330]  Everywhere at my kids school, other schools, softball games, you name it.
[02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:58.715]  Everyone just runs around, oh you're Alex Jones, you're the one that has Paul Watson, or Gavin McGinnis, or the other people on sometimes, or Pootie Pie or whatever.
[02:42:59.155 --> 02:43:02.337]  So why do you, what's happening there, Mark Dice?
[02:43:02.457 --> 02:43:09.582]  Why is Generation Z on fire, totally recognizing that their parents and the liberals are fake?
[02:43:09.602 --> 02:43:10.042]  What's happening?
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:28.814]  Well, now that they're finally kind of coming of age, they're not necessarily children anymore, and they've been living in this environment that has been trying to control them and tell them what they can and cannot say, and has been feeding them these bizarre narratives that are... But why are you and I then more popular with young folks but also middle-aged?
[02:43:28.854 --> 02:43:31.036]  I mean, why is it these certain shows that are popular with the kids?
[02:43:31.056 --> 02:43:31.276]  Go ahead.
[02:43:32.765 --> 02:43:39.387]  Well, I mean, let's face it, a lot of the information on the smartphones, it's sort of pseudo-synopsis crack.
[02:43:39.647 --> 02:43:42.928]  It just triggers the dopamine receptors in people's brains.
[02:43:42.948 --> 02:43:43.488]  Let's say it.
[02:43:43.508 --> 02:43:45.809]  Paul Watson changes the subject every 15 seconds.
[02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:48.050]  It's great, it's riveting, but it's designed for kids with no attention span.
[02:43:49.542 --> 02:43:52.304]  People's attention spans are literally that of a goldfish.
[02:43:52.384 --> 02:43:55.987]  And that's why people, you know, watch people play video games online.
[02:43:56.047 --> 02:44:01.711]  And so the media is, they're really entertainment, but they're also enemy propaganda.
[02:44:01.751 --> 02:44:09.617]  I mean, realistically, CNN, ABC, CBS, all these major liberal outlets... Wasn't that pure truth when Trump said, they're the enemy media?
[02:44:11.309 --> 02:44:14.051]  They are the enemy of the people because they're not news.
[02:44:14.091 --> 02:44:16.453]  They're not even liberal news outlets.
[02:44:17.213 --> 02:44:19.255]  When you look at BET, at least you know what they are.
[02:44:19.275 --> 02:44:33.965]  They're black entertainment television, which, by the way, speaking of Lil Bow Wow in the previous segment, the founder of BET, now the wife, the co-founder, admits that she's ashamed of what it's become because they started it back in the 80s as a cable channel for black people
[02:44:33.985 --> 02:44:34.385]  We're good to go.
[02:45:00.699 --> 02:45:03.881]  They're realizing that this system has been so phony, so fraudulent.
[02:45:03.901 --> 02:45:04.842]  They're empty inside.
[02:45:04.862 --> 02:45:05.843]  They're not satisfied.
[02:45:05.883 --> 02:45:07.364]  Their relationships are in shambles.
[02:45:07.624 --> 02:45:09.745]  They have no real job prospects.
[02:45:10.165 --> 02:45:13.327]  And so they're trying to find out what it is that's going on.
[02:45:13.367 --> 02:45:16.609]  That's why they're flocking to people like me, people like you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:45:16.810 --> 02:45:24.494]  There's a whole crop of, you know, sort of mid-20-year-old millennials now popping up on YouTube that are getting pretty big audience.
[02:45:24.514 --> 02:45:24.795]  Exactly.
[02:45:24.815 --> 02:45:25.395]  So let me ask you this.
[02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:26.416]  They're going to strike back with censorship.
[02:45:26.436 --> 02:45:27.196]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:45:27.216 --> 02:45:28.217]  But look at Bala's tweet.
[02:45:28.797 --> 02:45:32.759]  His uncle says, you know, kill Trump, shoot the police, spray them with bullets.
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:34.480]  You cover it, we cover it.
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:35.120]  People are pissed.
[02:45:35.521 --> 02:45:45.446]  He then says, yo, or ayo, real Donald Trump, shut your punk ass up talking bleep about my uncle at Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[02:45:45.466 --> 02:45:48.948]  So sex slavery, these millennials don't seem to get.
[02:45:50.023 --> 02:45:58.376]  You're threatening, your uncle's threatening to kill the president, he responds and says it's not nice, and then you act butthurt and say you want to kidnap and rape his wife, basically.
[02:45:58.656 --> 02:46:02.763]  I mean, what the hell do they have no... What is wrong with these people?
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:04.961]  A lot, clearly.
[02:46:05.001 --> 02:46:18.170]  And that's why these major news outlets like CNN, the counterfeit news network, they'll take the most minuscule little thing that Donald Trump said that's perhaps controversial, and they'll talk about it for three days, for five days, for the entire news cycle.
[02:46:18.470 --> 02:46:20.392]  But something like this, it just disappears.
[02:46:20.652 --> 02:46:25.754]  You may recall the thugs that live tortured that poor guy on Facebook Live.
[02:46:26.095 --> 02:46:27.295]  That story disappeared.
[02:46:27.335 --> 02:46:28.556]  It was mentioned literally once.
[02:46:28.636 --> 02:46:33.358]  It was perhaps one segment, a 30-second segment on most of these news outlets.
[02:46:33.658 --> 02:46:34.239]  It disappeared.
[02:46:34.279 --> 02:46:34.719]  It vanished.
[02:46:34.779 --> 02:46:38.901]  Now, the media could take a story like that and talk about it for a week, two weeks.
[02:46:39.101 --> 02:46:41.342]  They could have turned this kid into the next Trayvon Martin.
[02:46:41.642 --> 02:46:44.544]  But that's what they do with their chosen stories.
[02:46:44.564 --> 02:46:46.985]  They'll pick a certain case and they'll blow it up.
[02:46:47.705 --> 02:46:50.206]  Turn the person into a martyr, or turn someone into a hero.
[02:46:50.226 --> 02:46:56.330]  So it's lying by omission, too, because look at the 474 reported pedophiles, 30-plus kids in dungeons confirmed by the police.
[02:46:56.830 --> 02:47:02.433]  You rescue kids in sex dungeons, 30-plus in California and LA.
[02:47:03.094 --> 02:47:04.494]  We know Trump's behind exposing it.
[02:47:04.514 --> 02:47:06.796]  We have him, Eric Prince, CIA, you name it, that are fighting.
[02:47:07.116 --> 02:47:08.497]  I can't get into the details, but it's amazing.
[02:47:08.517 --> 02:47:09.337]  It's a James Bond movie.
[02:47:10.078 --> 02:47:14.060]  It's covered one time that they found 30 kids in slave dungeons.
[02:47:14.730 --> 02:47:27.738]  You can't say that there's not collusion when, if you watch the big three major networks, the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, their evening news shows, they'll have the same stories when it's not a big national story.
[02:47:27.878 --> 02:47:29.999]  It's an isolated incident, a local story.
[02:47:30.019 --> 02:47:37.624]  It'll be one white guy allegedly raped a woman, and they'll just put it out because white guys are rapists, but then they'll cover up a bunch of Muslim rapes.
[02:47:38.652 --> 02:47:54.630]  There's obvious certain stories that are going to be the top stories that everyone's talking about that should be covered on all major news networks, but then there's other stories which are isolated incidences or local issues that they'll pick and then all of a sudden, just mysteriously, they're on all of the major networks.
[02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:58.316]  Sure, and as a media analyst, you're obsessed with that and you should be, but I think the public gets it.
[02:47:58.376 --> 02:48:02.643]  So now we're able, with Drudge and others, to actually look at real news, make it the meme.
[02:48:02.943 --> 02:48:04.065]  That's why they want to block us.
[02:48:04.105 --> 02:48:05.848]  I notice what they kill is our stuff that's going viral.
[02:48:06.228 --> 02:48:09.734]  Now, though, they banned almost all of Paul's articles this week on Facebook.
[02:48:10.074 --> 02:48:12.096]  And all I'm saying is, brother, you have your followers and listeners.
[02:48:12.497 --> 02:48:13.357]  Please do a report about it.
[02:48:13.698 --> 02:48:15.359]  Because if it happens to you, I'm going to talk about you.
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:17.642]  People don't think InfoWorks is too big to not need help.
[02:48:17.942 --> 02:48:19.003]  They're hitting us hard, man.
[02:48:19.063 --> 02:48:22.266]  Facebook, Twitter, they banned almost all polls articles this week.
[02:48:22.827 --> 02:48:24.008]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[02:48:24.028 --> 02:48:25.069]  And they admit they are.
[02:48:25.129 --> 02:48:26.510]  Google announced drug judges today.
[02:48:26.811 --> 02:48:29.313]  They're going to start, quote, blocking fake news.
[02:48:29.333 --> 02:48:30.314]  That means anything that's truthful.
[02:48:30.354 --> 02:48:31.976]  So this is on, man.
[02:48:32.076 --> 02:48:32.917]  What should we do about that?
[02:48:34.532 --> 02:48:35.573]  We need to just ramp it up.
[02:48:35.593 --> 02:48:36.915]  We need to keep exposing them.
[02:48:37.095 --> 02:48:37.856]  And we're just growing.
[02:48:37.876 --> 02:48:43.001]  That's why they're in a panic, really, because your audience, the truth is just spreading and spreading and spreading.
[02:48:43.142 --> 02:48:52.692]  And so we need to actually go old school, like Matt Drudge has been suggesting for some time, instead of using these social media ghettos to rely on to get your information.
[02:48:52.712 --> 02:48:56.296]  Just have blurbs that say, I can't post here, go to my site to see it.
[02:48:57.025 --> 02:48:58.867]  Well, and bookmark InfoWars.com.
[02:48:58.947 --> 02:49:00.948]  Bookmark Drudge Report on your browser.
[02:49:00.968 --> 02:49:05.792]  And instead of just following sites on Facebook, who are obviously going to filter.
[02:49:05.812 --> 02:49:07.394]  Yeah, don't use it as your web portal.
[02:49:07.414 --> 02:49:12.818]  Just like folks went away from using something as their home page or, you know, the old, you know, nav bars at the top.
[02:49:12.858 --> 02:49:15.381]  Just stop using them as your launch page.
[02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:16.842]  That's the end of them if you just do it.
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:25.343]  And that's why I think, you know, Drudge tweeted out last week that the Facebook page for, quote, Official Drudge Report and Matt Drudge were not his.
[02:49:25.403 --> 02:49:27.684]  And so, obviously, they were started by a fan.
[02:49:28.164 --> 02:49:31.385]  And so then people started following it, not knowing whether it was his or not.
[02:49:31.425 --> 02:49:32.646]  They weren't verified pages.
[02:49:32.686 --> 02:49:36.427]  They didn't have the blue check, but they still had 1.2 million followers on one of the pages.
[02:49:36.807 --> 02:49:38.508]  He had an official page of 20 million.
[02:49:39.626 --> 02:49:40.708]  It wasn't Drudge's page.
[02:49:40.748 --> 02:49:41.369]  He didn't start it.
[02:49:41.409 --> 02:49:42.350]  He wasn't posting there.
[02:49:42.751 --> 02:49:47.097]  And so, I think he had it pulled because he doesn't want people... Sure, in a lot of sense.
[02:49:47.157 --> 02:49:48.018]  We had to do that ourselves.
[02:49:48.299 --> 02:49:49.841]  Because I used to let folks have sites in my name.
[02:49:49.861 --> 02:49:53.686]  Then they start putting, like, on purpose, obviously, racist stuff or whatever.
[02:49:53.706 --> 02:49:55.208]  The news is like, why are you doing this?
[02:49:56.365 --> 02:49:57.687]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:49:58.187 --> 02:50:03.954]  That's why he had it pulled, because he doesn't want people to rely on scrolling through your Facebook feed.
[02:50:03.994 --> 02:50:11.643]  It's basically stealing your identity, too, because if you let somebody else... Fan pages are great, but then it becomes a problem when they give it to somebody else and then they want to sabotage it.
[02:50:12.691 --> 02:50:21.222]  Yeah, and then you see instances like what happened with, you know, when people start tweeting out things on parody Twitter accounts or fan Twitter accounts that get mistaken for real tweets.
[02:50:21.262 --> 02:50:26.930]  We see Maxine Waters and other people started talking about a fake tweet that Michael Flynn allegedly posted.
[02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:27.671]  It was from a fake account.
[02:50:28.232 --> 02:50:38.002]  I mean, Tommy Lahren was tweeting, or was trending on Twitter a couple weeks ago because he saw a fake Twitter account, tweeted some racist things, and so everybody starts freaking out, calling her a racist.
[02:50:38.022 --> 02:50:39.363]  She's one of the top trends on Twitter.
[02:50:39.944 --> 02:50:41.225]  That's real fake news.
[02:50:41.586 --> 02:50:45.650]  And that's why we just need to keep talking to people, really get off of these ghettos like Drudge said.
[02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:48.773]  That's why I think you guys are doing so well, having your own platform.
[02:50:49.854 --> 02:50:50.715]  Mark, I agree with you.
[02:50:50.735 --> 02:50:51.556]  Look at this right here.
[02:50:52.337 --> 02:50:55.480]  Was Obama insider Robert Gibbs behind McDonald's anti-Trump tweet?
[02:50:56.081 --> 02:51:00.045]  Gibbs now, uh, McDonald's Chief Communications Officer.
[02:51:00.105 --> 02:51:00.845]  He's over it.
[02:51:01.246 --> 02:51:03.428]  He's the guy that famously said, I lie to the public all the time.
[02:51:03.468 --> 02:51:04.309]  I lie about drones.
[02:51:04.369 --> 02:51:05.250]  I lie about taxes.
[02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:09.955]  I lie and laughs at us like we're dumb effers, like Zuckerberg and Gruber say.
[02:51:10.575 --> 02:51:11.436]  And then you read on.
[02:51:11.456 --> 02:51:12.738]  I mean, he's a prime suspect.
[02:51:13.038 --> 02:51:13.699]  He's over it.
[02:51:13.719 --> 02:51:17.363]  And they put up this anti-Trump tweet about his small hands and how he's a jerk or whatever.
[02:51:17.643 --> 02:51:19.325]  I mean, look, my gut tells me it's Gibbs.
[02:51:19.345 --> 02:51:19.706]  What do you think?
[02:51:20.683 --> 02:51:30.269]  You know, I think that they have a social media manager that uses something like TweetDeck or has multiple Twitter accounts that they're managing through various software, you know, API platforms.
[02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:41.357]  And I think that this was someone who thought that they were logged into their own account, but was actually logged into the McDonald's account, their social media manager, and then didn't realize that they tweeted it from the wrong account.
[02:51:41.637 --> 02:51:46.120]  And that's why McDonald's was very careful saying that, well, Twitter told us
[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:48.281]  We are investigating.
[02:51:48.461 --> 02:51:50.062]  There's no police investigation.
[02:51:50.102 --> 02:51:51.262]  There's no police report.
[02:51:51.562 --> 02:51:54.484]  What Twitter told them, I think they're talking about the flood of responses.
[02:51:54.604 --> 02:52:10.651]  Because if somebody hacked into Twitter's account, the hacker is certainly going to be tech-savvy enough to realize that when you respond to someone's tweet without putting a character in front of the at real Donald Trump, that it only shows up to the people who mutually follow those two accounts.
[02:52:10.951 --> 02:52:18.377]  So if the hacker wanted everybody who was following the McDonald's account to see them slamming Donald Trump, they wouldn't have tweeted just once.
[02:52:18.677 --> 02:52:23.040]  And they certainly wouldn't have just replied to Trump, or they wouldn't have just replied in that manner.
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:24.781]  They would have quoted the tweet.
[02:52:24.802 --> 02:52:26.523]  Sure, why'd they pin it to the top?
[02:52:27.748 --> 02:52:29.009]  Oh, I didn't know that they pinned it to the top.
[02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:32.150]  Okay, well, now that changes everything right there.
[02:52:32.911 --> 02:52:33.711]  I don't even know how it all works.
[02:52:33.851 --> 02:52:34.752]  Matt, you're better at this than I am.
[02:52:34.792 --> 02:52:35.552]  I'm just asking you.
[02:52:36.032 --> 02:52:36.933]  Paul's good at it, isn't he?
[02:52:37.873 --> 02:52:38.694]  So let me ask you this.
[02:52:38.774 --> 02:52:40.494]  What do we do, though, as they start to strangle us?
[02:52:40.514 --> 02:52:49.139]  Look, I get we're getting more radio stations, you know, but let me tell you, they are decimating us on Facebook, on YouTube.
[02:52:49.159 --> 02:52:51.680]  They admittedly have all these governors blocking stuff being spread.
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:55.002]  We have three million subscribers on our channels, two million on one.
[02:52:55.582 --> 02:52:56.983]  Most people don't get the subscription.
[02:52:57.763 --> 02:53:03.027]  I guess people just have to remember, like you said, to pin our page, to remember it and come back to it, and then spread it.
[02:53:03.287 --> 02:53:06.569]  If our listeners just keep spreading articles, keep spreading videos, we'll beat this.
[02:53:06.589 --> 02:53:08.190]  But they just have to know, this is a war.
[02:53:08.450 --> 02:53:10.451]  This isn't about me making more money or Mark Dice.
[02:53:10.792 --> 02:53:11.712]  I'm so happy right now.
[02:53:11.992 --> 02:53:13.173]  I don't ever need more money in my life.
[02:53:13.453 --> 02:53:14.554]  My family's got a ranch.
[02:53:15.114 --> 02:53:16.015]  I don't need anything.
[02:53:16.035 --> 02:53:17.396]  I don't want to have a bunch of crap.
[02:53:17.776 --> 02:53:19.878]  I got a Dodge, a car, I love it.
[02:53:20.758 --> 02:53:26.631]  I want to beat these people that literally think the country belongs to them, that want to brainwash our kids, take full control of society.
[02:53:26.911 --> 02:53:27.973]  They're not leaving us alone.
[02:53:28.013 --> 02:53:28.595]  They're bullies.
[02:53:28.655 --> 02:53:30.519]  So, my full will is against these people.
[02:53:32.307 --> 02:53:35.129]  People need to just go old school again and start communicating again.
[02:53:35.189 --> 02:53:39.954]  I mean, it's become common knowledge that people, it's almost a joke, where people don't talk on the phone.
[02:53:40.014 --> 02:53:54.368]  They just communicate through social media, which is not communicating because in 60 seconds, verbally on the phone or face to face over at a barbecue, you can communicate more information than you could in pretty much 30 minutes tweeting it out or texting
[02:53:54.488 --> 02:53:56.168]  And again, it's human communication.
[02:53:56.489 --> 02:53:58.469]  It's not what somebody else did sending it out.
[02:53:58.489 --> 02:54:03.650]  And I'm not saying don't send our stuff out, but more listeners should create their own YouTube or Facebook accounts or their own site.
[02:54:04.471 --> 02:54:16.574]  And whatever it is, whether it's gardening or whether it's, you know, stargazing or bird watching, whatever it is, or music, just your own humanity that isn't centralized and controlled, that will bring them down.
[02:54:18.764 --> 02:54:22.807]  Going old school, like I said, I can't stress enough to bookmark certain pages.
[02:54:22.988 --> 02:54:30.094]  You go and then check out your three, four, five favorite news sources directly, and then that way you're not being filtered through Facebook.
[02:54:30.194 --> 02:54:33.057]  I tried boosting posts on Facebook.
[02:54:33.077 --> 02:54:34.799]  A lot of people may not be familiar with this.
[02:54:34.839 --> 02:54:35.379]  I've even paid.
[02:54:35.459 --> 02:54:35.960]  It doesn't work.
[02:54:36.932 --> 02:54:37.332]  It's a joke.
[02:54:37.352 --> 02:54:46.001]  For those who aren't familiar, when you have a fan page or a public page like Alex and I have, they restrict the distribution of our posts.
[02:54:46.141 --> 02:54:52.807]  And so in order to allow those posts to be distributed and show up on people's news feeds, they ask us to pay them.
[02:54:52.847 --> 02:54:56.631]  And so you can go through the budget, and I mean, it's something like $4,000, Alex.
[02:54:58.092 --> 02:54:58.853]  Total scam.
[02:54:58.873 --> 02:54:59.734]  We've done it, it doesn't work.
[02:55:00.114 --> 02:55:03.438]  And then meanwhile, our own people go, our listeners go and post it.
[02:55:03.458 --> 02:55:04.639]  They go, oh that's spam, and take it off.
[02:55:05.059 --> 02:55:07.882]  And again, they're taking stuff off our own page.
[02:55:08.543 --> 02:55:12.668]  They won't even let us now, if it's bought, like a senator comes on, they delete that.
[02:55:13.669 --> 02:55:17.553]  I know when something's really credible and really big, they just block it.
[02:55:19.087 --> 02:55:19.607]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:55:19.647 --> 02:55:26.371]  I've had multiple videos demonetized from YouTube, I mean, for well over a year, year and a half, and they say it's sensitive content.
[02:55:26.431 --> 02:55:30.032]  We just, we'll allow you to have it on here, but we're not going to let you run ads on this.
[02:55:30.112 --> 02:55:37.916]  Meanwhile, the same exact story or the same exact clip is shown on CNN's page on some big liberal network.
[02:55:37.936 --> 02:55:39.117]  No, it's just how Hollywood's run.
[02:55:39.157 --> 02:55:40.698]  These big monopolies screwing everybody.
[02:55:40.718 --> 02:55:41.478]  It's all coming to an end.
[02:55:41.918 --> 02:55:43.000]  Undoubtedly, it's coming down.
[02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:45.663]  Even if they try to shut us down, they can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:55:46.083 --> 02:55:47.946]  How do you predict in the next five years?
[02:55:47.966 --> 02:55:48.606]  Look into the future.
[02:55:49.007 --> 02:55:50.048]  How is this all going to end?
[02:55:50.088 --> 02:55:51.029]  What do you see in five years?
[02:55:51.049 --> 02:55:57.557]  You know, I think they're going to try to bring down some other big YouTubers like PewDiePie, only not just entertainers.
[02:55:57.577 --> 02:55:59.520]  I think they're going to start to come after people like you.
[02:56:01.946 --> 02:56:03.567]  Yeah, and they're going to try to hit us financially.
[02:56:03.587 --> 02:56:10.953]  We just saw BuzzFeed publish an article targeting certain news YouTube channels, naming Paul Joseph Watson specifically.
[02:56:11.133 --> 02:56:11.913]  Oh, he's the target.
[02:56:11.933 --> 02:56:12.774]  They're scared of him.
[02:56:13.634 --> 02:56:20.940]  And they're trying to go after us financially, and they're going to say, well, we'll allow you to maybe, you know, still have your channel.
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:22.701]  That's right.
[02:56:22.721 --> 02:56:27.905]  They're telling their people, go flag this, shut down Paul Watson, because his average video gets 5 million views.
[02:56:28.065 --> 02:56:29.306]  They cannot stand it.
[02:56:29.806 --> 02:56:30.727]  They cannot stand it.
[02:56:31.226 --> 02:56:38.353]  When you look at the propaganda they're putting out on the official, you know, YouTube creators' pages, they're always a 50% thumbs down.
[02:56:38.513 --> 02:56:41.477]  I mean, you look at any video... Oh yeah, nobody wants what YouTube's force-feeding.
[02:56:41.997 --> 02:56:44.800]  Well, that's why they kicked Jay Leno off of the NBC Tonight Show.
[02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:46.362]  He was number one for almost 20 years.
[02:56:46.402 --> 02:56:48.023]  They replaced him with Jimmy Fallon.
[02:56:48.043 --> 02:56:51.947]  And that's because, I know behind the scenes, I'll stop with that, the guy's actually a libertarian patriot.
[02:56:51.987 --> 02:56:52.488]  He's a great guy.
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:53.981]  He is a great guy.
[02:56:54.001 --> 02:56:57.644]  He really couldn't tell us politics because he went after everyone pretty equally.
[02:56:57.684 --> 02:57:00.047]  Leno openly is an Americana guy.
[02:57:00.387 --> 02:57:01.688]  The execs didn't like him.
[02:57:01.728 --> 02:57:06.813]  He bucked... I know people that work on the show and people that know Jay, I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:57:07.234 --> 02:57:08.215]  Jay is a patriot.
[02:57:08.775 --> 02:57:09.376]  Jay's a listener.
[02:57:09.396 --> 02:57:11.258]  I've been told six years ago Jay's a listener.
[02:57:11.278 --> 02:57:11.698]  I'm going to stop.
[02:57:11.738 --> 02:57:15.141]  I mean, hell, Jay plugged me 18 years ago on air.
[02:57:15.262 --> 02:57:15.502]  Go ahead.
[02:57:16.454 --> 02:57:35.210]  There's a clip of Jimmy Kimmel on David Letterman back in 2008 or 2009 when Jimmy Kimmel got his own show and he told David Letterman that he was actually surprised and he wishes that Letterman would have told him that he would be lying for a living and he has to lie about liking the television shows.
[02:57:35.230 --> 02:57:36.912]  He has to lie about liking the celebrities.
[02:57:37.172 --> 02:57:40.795]  He has to promote all these different products and television shows.
[02:57:41.115 --> 02:57:43.958]  And that's what these people do, a lot of them, when they sign those things.
[02:57:44.378 --> 02:57:48.682]  Jay Leno isn't a horse, even though he had top ratings, just like Larry King.
[02:57:48.722 --> 02:57:50.444]  Larry King wasn't perfect, but he was his own guy.
[02:57:50.744 --> 02:57:51.705]  They couldn't tell him what to do.
[02:57:51.745 --> 02:57:52.306]  He's gone.
[02:57:52.586 --> 02:57:53.587]  They put in Piers Morgan.
[02:57:53.607 --> 02:57:54.148]  Total failure.
[02:57:54.328 --> 02:57:55.609]  Do five more minutes with us, my friend.
[02:57:56.270 --> 02:57:57.010]  There's Mark Dice.

[02:57:59.793 --> 02:58:01.013]  I guess they go to his Twitter or Facebook.
[02:58:01.194 --> 02:58:02.994]  They're much bigger, but those may be gone next week.
[02:58:03.714 --> 02:58:04.595]  This is a war, folks.

[02:58:27.886 --> 02:58:29.147]  That's at cost, by the way.
[02:58:30.167 --> 02:58:32.749]  And like, competitors have the same amount of one ingredient.
[02:58:32.809 --> 02:58:33.570]  It costs 45 bucks.
[02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:36.091]  This costs a third of that, and it is half off right now.

[02:58:38.273 --> 02:58:39.834]  We'll be back with the fourth hour.
[02:58:39.854 --> 02:58:42.575]  Anthony and Kumi are coming up in about eight minutes, but I'm going to finish up with Mark Dice.
[02:58:42.936 --> 02:58:43.396]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.736 --> 02:58:44.517]  It's a war, folks.
[02:58:44.537 --> 02:58:45.958]  You cannot hype how real this is.
[02:58:46.778 --> 02:58:47.839]  Who'd think, Infowars?

[02:58:56.245 --> 02:58:57.166]  But where do you get it?

[02:59:53.945 --> 02:59:58.058]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:58.580 --> 02:59:59.864]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:26.580]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:27.101 --> 03:00:32.102]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:32.122 --> 03:00:43.544]  All right, Mark Dice is here.
[03:00:43.564 --> 03:00:47.925]  I got more calls, Dustin and Joe and BC and Jim and Patrick, and I apologize, I haven't gotten to you yet.
[03:00:47.945 --> 03:00:50.605]  I need to get to your calls.
[03:00:50.645 --> 03:00:53.306]  We also have another guest host coming up who does a great job, Anthony Cumia.
[03:00:54.884 --> 03:00:57.645]  In closing here, Mark, we're back and forth, we're ranting about this.
[03:00:58.286 --> 03:01:02.548]  I just hope listeners and myself don't miss the fact that history's happening.
[03:01:02.588 --> 03:01:03.668]  The elite is collapsing.
[03:01:04.048 --> 03:01:05.469]  Nationalist movements are exploding.
[03:01:07.170 --> 03:01:10.331]  The rediscovery of humanity and normal human culture is here.
[03:01:10.632 --> 03:01:15.074]  They've tried to jam that, attack that, but people are organically going back to it.
[03:01:15.774 --> 03:01:18.375]  Kind of like bugs you spray with pesticides, some become immune.
[03:01:18.795 --> 03:01:20.256]  I mean, this is an exciting time to be alive.
[03:01:20.296 --> 03:01:22.657]  I mean, again, what more do you want to say?
[03:01:22.697 --> 03:01:23.858]  What else do you see coming in the future?
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:28.003]  This is finally restoring the Republic.
[03:01:28.023 --> 03:01:32.427]  This is what we've been fighting for, for you for 20 years, me for 12 years.
[03:01:32.467 --> 03:01:33.888]  We've had a tremendous victory.
[03:01:33.948 --> 03:01:50.923]  It's exciting to see we're taking back the country, we're taking back the culture, and this small minority, this very loud, active, and well-funded minority of social justice warriors are absolutely scrambling now because they're losing control in every attack that they try to make against us now.
[03:01:51.483 --> 03:01:52.824]  Uh, it just blows up in their face.
[03:01:52.864 --> 03:01:57.388]  We have the President of the United States calling out major news networks as fake news.
[03:01:57.428 --> 03:02:02.273]  The very label that they had literally coined in order to try to demonize- And then they're retreating.
[03:02:02.313 --> 03:02:04.555]  They're retreating saying, don't use it, too late, too late.
[03:02:05.185 --> 03:02:06.846]  They're admitting that it had backfired.
[03:02:06.906 --> 03:02:14.132]  Washington Post, which literally coined the term, is admitting, and Slate and all these other liberals are admitting that it's backfired.
[03:02:14.693 --> 03:02:27.363]  And when the President of the United States is now calling the very creators of this term, the name that they used to try to demonize and shut down the rising alternative independent media, you know that they have a serious problem.
[03:02:27.383 --> 03:02:28.484]  And you can look at their numbers.
[03:02:29.165 --> 03:02:30.426]  Their Twitter followers are fake.
[03:02:30.886 --> 03:02:31.687]  You can look at the likes.
[03:02:31.707 --> 03:02:33.528]  You can buy likes and retweets as well.
[03:02:33.568 --> 03:02:34.588]  But look at the engagement.
[03:02:34.808 --> 03:02:35.969]  Nobody's watching these people.
[03:02:36.029 --> 03:02:36.710]  Nobody cares.
[03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:37.550]  Oh, they're dead.
[03:02:37.570 --> 03:02:39.151]  And big corporations are desperate.
[03:02:39.451 --> 03:02:40.792]  Okay, the old lies didn't work.
[03:02:40.872 --> 03:02:41.633]  Triple the lies.
[03:02:42.093 --> 03:02:45.655]  But now we're seeing liberal brainwashing collapsing on YouTube and Facebook.
[03:02:45.675 --> 03:02:47.596]  Their resistance is collapsing.
[03:02:47.616 --> 03:02:55.201]  I think that's why the... I think that's why the censorship's intensified, trying to bolster their own troops.
[03:02:55.241 --> 03:02:56.902]  But it's like Hitler at the Battle of the Bulge.
[03:02:57.242 --> 03:02:59.003]  He's only slowing down his final defeat.
[03:02:59.974 --> 03:03:12.602]  You know, the liberals are sort of like, Hillary got left at the altar at the wedding, and all the guests arrived, the reception tables were set, the meals were cooked and ready to serve, and then all of a sudden Hillary got left at the altar.
[03:03:12.682 --> 03:03:13.163]  Exactly.
[03:03:13.223 --> 03:03:19.987]  They're still real heartbroken, they're upset, and they keep getting this false sense of hope with the, oh, a recount, we're going to get a recount.
[03:03:20.027 --> 03:03:20.428]  No, you're not.
[03:03:20.528 --> 03:03:22.309]  We're going to have the Electoral College shut them down.
[03:03:22.329 --> 03:03:22.429]  No.
[03:03:22.449 --> 03:03:24.690]  And then they just keep getting more and more desperate like Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:03:24.731 --> 03:03:29.774]  And now the Intelligence Committee came out and said, okay, they were spying on Trump.
[03:03:31.975 --> 03:03:38.498]  Yeah, it's insane and, you know, to say that there's not a shadow government working against him is absurd.
[03:03:38.518 --> 03:03:42.560]  He can't even get his pictures hung up at the VA!
[03:03:43.821 --> 03:03:51.745]  Yeah, the fact that they're so viciously against him goes to show that they're getting desperate because... Does that not certify Trump as pure gold?
[03:03:51.785 --> 03:03:56.847]  That the whole globalist enemy, from the communist Chinese, the Islamists, they're all just crapping themselves?
[03:03:57.527 --> 03:03:58.648]  This is delicious irony.
[03:03:59.694 --> 03:04:00.135]  This is great.
[03:04:00.155 --> 03:04:02.517]  You know, I think this is the reprieve of Nineveh, man.
[03:04:02.637 --> 03:04:06.760]  This was the hand of God stopping the final destruction of this country.
[03:04:07.361 --> 03:04:08.442]  We were right at the edge.
[03:04:08.522 --> 03:04:11.004]  I mean, we were this close to the point of no return.
[03:04:11.024 --> 03:04:14.687]  By the way, I've prayed about this and I know, I've studied history and the Bible.
[03:04:16.069 --> 03:04:17.270]  God didn't do this because of us.
[03:04:17.350 --> 03:04:22.214]  Our ancestors were so good that because of their work, we've been given this final reprieve.
[03:04:22.474 --> 03:04:24.136]  If we don't take this, we'll be destroyed.
[03:04:24.156 --> 03:04:24.376]  Go ahead.
[03:04:25.481 --> 03:04:29.963]  A lot of people fell asleep at the wheel and just sort of let things go and got lost in an entertainment wasteland.
[03:04:30.003 --> 03:04:32.165]  But this is the great awakening now.
[03:04:32.545 --> 03:04:38.988]  And not only is it reflective in the audience that you have, that I have, but it's also showing with the youth.
[03:04:39.148 --> 03:04:48.213]  Because I'm telling you, last year, really six months, I mean, I've seen so many young college kids, millennials, popping up on YouTube and getting involved.
[03:04:48.293 --> 03:04:49.314]  And that's what scares them.
[03:04:50.299 --> 03:04:58.845]  We're seeing a whole new crop of millennial commentators now on Fox News, writers for The Hill, that article that you read about Bow Wow on The Hill that's linked up on Drudge Report.
[03:04:59.086 --> 03:05:00.066]  That was written by a millennial.
[03:05:00.086 --> 03:05:00.887]  That's right, stay there.
[03:05:00.907 --> 03:05:02.268]  I'm going to say bye to you in the break.
[03:05:06.992 --> 03:05:07.612]  Senator, are you there?
[03:05:07.632 --> 03:05:09.133]  I am, Alex.
[03:05:09.173 --> 03:05:09.994]  Thanks for having me.
[03:05:10.214 --> 03:05:11.295]  Well, it's good to have you here.
[03:05:11.395 --> 03:05:12.876]  Wow, so much going on.
[03:05:13.637 --> 03:05:14.337]  Where should we start?
[03:05:14.377 --> 03:05:15.038]  With Obamacare?
[03:05:16.269 --> 03:05:20.954]  Yeah, I mean, it really disturbs me that for six years we've been running to repeal Obamacare.
[03:05:21.175 --> 03:05:28.863]  The American public elected the House Majority Republican in 2010, the Republican Senate 2014, and then the White House in 2016.
[03:05:28.923 --> 03:05:34.910]  They elected us to repeal it, and now what the House leadership's putting forward is simply Obamacare lite.
[03:05:35.090 --> 03:05:37.353]  We had a vote a little bit over a year ago, and every
[03:05:38.013 --> 03:05:38.453]  I don't know.
[03:05:53.644 --> 03:05:54.084]  Wow.
[03:06:17.120 --> 03:06:21.987]  And they leave the Cadillac tax, the tax on really good insurance, stays in place forever.
[03:06:22.247 --> 03:06:25.011]  There is an individual mandate in their bill.
[03:06:25.612 --> 03:06:33.002]  You don't pay the mandate to the government, you don't have to pay a tax if you don't buy insurance, but you pay a penalty to the insurance company.
[03:06:33.522 --> 03:06:40.511]  The insurance companies have their fingers into this bill, and the insurance companies also have bailouts built into them.
[03:06:40.971 --> 03:06:49.202]  If someone's insurance becomes expensive, if someone gets really sick, instead of the insurance company taking the risk, they're pawning the risk off on the taxpayer.
[03:06:49.842 --> 03:06:57.191]  So I think there are enough votes, enough conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and enough conservatives in the Senate to stop this thing.
[03:06:57.211 --> 03:07:00.715]  And then our hope is that we'll vote on a clean repeal.
[03:07:00.935 --> 03:07:05.460]  Let's just repeal Obamacare and forget trying to start new government programs.
[03:07:05.580 --> 03:07:08.982]  If you have the votes to just get rid of the damn thing, let's get rid of it.
[03:07:09.022 --> 03:07:14.466]  We know it was the Republican establishment helped ride it with Mitt Romney a decade ago when he was governor of Massachusetts.
[03:07:14.486 --> 03:07:24.492]  So, Senator Paul, again, I want to just commend you as the only major Republican I've seen so far to come out and point out this is not as good a deal as the Republican leadership is saying.
[03:07:24.532 --> 03:07:26.574]  And Trump's saying, hey, you know, a good start.
[03:07:26.654 --> 03:07:27.134]  I like it.
[03:07:27.174 --> 03:07:28.555]  It's a good negotiation point.
[03:07:28.935 --> 03:07:30.976]  So maybe he doesn't know how bad it is.
[03:07:31.337 --> 03:07:32.958]  Maybe he needs to hear from the listeners and you.
[03:07:33.718 --> 03:07:35.219]  Well, I talked to him yesterday.
[03:07:35.239 --> 03:07:37.640]  He called me up, and we had a great conversation.
[03:07:37.660 --> 03:07:40.442]  He and I are getting along just well, just very fine.
[03:07:40.462 --> 03:07:50.167]  And in that conversation, he said he wanted to hear other ideas, and that, really, I think he understands the legislative process, and the Republican Party is not monolithic.
[03:07:50.187 --> 03:07:55.190]  There are conservatives, there are moderates, there are big government Republicans, and there's the establishment.
[03:07:55.810 --> 03:07:59.813]  And he, more than anybody else, knows that you've got to fight the establishment and the status quo.
[03:08:15.266 --> 03:08:30.876]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[03:08:32.177 --> 03:08:34.278]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:41.954 --> 03:08:43.716]  Hey, we have the Anthony Cumia liners.
[03:08:43.796 --> 03:08:52.124]  Even if I'm like running into his show, we need to run Anthony Cumia live from New York or Florida, where he's at today, joining us with his great media organization.
[03:08:52.144 --> 03:08:53.605]  We're going to tell you about the great work he's doing.
[03:08:55.367 --> 03:08:57.809]  I just want to spend a few minutes with him because I want to pick his brain about what's happening.
[03:08:57.829 --> 03:08:59.150]  Let's cue that clip up.
[03:08:59.190 --> 03:09:02.814]  John McCain says that Rand Paul works for Vladimir Putin.
[03:09:03.194 --> 03:09:06.077]  I thought he worked for Santa Claus, but we'll go to that in a moment.
[03:09:07.734 --> 03:09:10.276]  And you've got all these great job numbers coming in.
[03:09:10.316 --> 03:09:13.359]  You've got the best small business startups since 1984.
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:14.941]  Peak of the Reagan recovery.
[03:09:15.401 --> 03:09:17.763]  You've got the whole world just rushing into the U.S.
[03:09:17.783 --> 03:09:18.864]  now that we're open for business.
[03:09:19.525 --> 03:09:20.286]  All this happening.
[03:09:21.727 --> 03:09:26.771]  And you've got Snoop Dogg saying kill the president, his nephew saying kidnap his wife, put her in sex slavery.
[03:09:27.852 --> 03:09:31.855]  You've got just the, you know, that intro liner.
[03:09:32.536 --> 03:09:36.659]  I've been hearing those type of liners for 20 years, deep behind enemy lines, FEMA Region 6, under globalism.
[03:09:36.679 --> 03:09:38.681]  You know, America is being taken over by multinationals.
[03:09:40.626 --> 03:09:43.347]  And as I say, if Trump succeeds, I won't run those promos anymore.
[03:09:43.807 --> 03:09:46.589]  Intro sang, Deep Behind Enemy Lines, FEMA Region 6.
[03:09:47.209 --> 03:09:48.530]  But I mean, I'm in a U.N.
[03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:49.950]  stronghold, a model U.N.
[03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:56.613]  city, where they have all this social engineering and high taxes, just like New York or San Francisco, and they admit they're doing it to screw the little guy.
[03:09:56.974 --> 03:10:03.437]  And then the VA, not just in Florida, we're learning all over the country, won't hang up Trump pitchers, they won't hang them up in federal buildings.
[03:10:03.697 --> 03:10:06.258]  There's a total revolt of all these lazy jerks.
[03:10:08.154 --> 03:10:18.023]  And then the federal judges, again, connected to the Ninth Circuit, they come out and say, oh, we're just ignoring the travel ban from countries that don't even have passports or airfields that work.
[03:10:18.523 --> 03:10:21.265]  Just random people from basically barbarian hellholes.
[03:10:22.066 --> 03:10:23.648]  Barbarians saying something, actually.
[03:10:24.168 --> 03:10:25.429]  They live better than folks in these countries.
[03:10:25.449 --> 03:10:27.851]  I feel sorry for these folks, but they can't just come here.
[03:10:28.912 --> 03:10:34.954]  And so there's just this open revolt by the shadow state that just thinks it owns everything.
[03:10:35.254 --> 03:10:37.554]  The good news is everything they do turns to crap.
[03:10:38.215 --> 03:10:39.715]  Everything they do blows up in their face.
[03:10:40.795 --> 03:10:41.496]  But they don't care.
[03:10:41.616 --> 03:10:42.996]  They're just moving forward.
[03:10:43.036 --> 03:10:48.518]  So what happens when the immovable object runs into the unstoppable force?
[03:10:50.298 --> 03:10:51.078]  That was a C.S.
[03:10:51.158 --> 03:10:52.259]  Lewis book.
[03:10:52.959 --> 03:10:53.819]  The Unstoppable Force.
[03:10:53.859 --> 03:10:55.639]  I read that like 20 years ago or more than that.
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:56.400]  God, I'm getting old.
[03:10:56.460 --> 03:10:57.280]  I was like 12 years old.
[03:10:59.409 --> 03:10:59.809]  30 years ago.
[03:11:00.350 --> 03:11:02.231]  God Almighty, longer than that.
[03:11:02.371 --> 03:11:03.332]  So here we are.
[03:11:03.572 --> 03:11:04.492]  What's going to happen?
[03:11:05.593 --> 03:11:08.355]  Because everybody's saying kill the president.
[03:11:08.415 --> 03:11:11.237]  Even newspapers say, are you allowed to say that now?
[03:11:11.517 --> 03:11:13.758]  And it's a bunch of wimps.
[03:11:13.778 --> 03:11:21.884]  The biggest armed force in history, 100 plus million armed gun owners, 50 plus million veterans, a lot of military age, who don't want trouble but are done.
[03:11:23.123 --> 03:11:30.188]  And then, Snoop says, kill the president, shoot cops in a video, brags about it in tweets, says, yeah, you ought to die.
[03:11:30.508 --> 03:11:38.773]  His little punk bow-wow comes out and says, ah, shut up, don't criticize my uncle, or I'll kidnap your wife, put her in a gang-rape facility like the Muslims do.
[03:11:38.793 --> 03:11:39.854]  That's what he said.
[03:11:41.395 --> 03:11:46.278]  And he's bitching, like, how dare the president say something back when my uncle says he wants to kill you.
[03:11:47.540 --> 03:11:48.101]  How dare you?
[03:11:48.241 --> 03:11:50.283]  You're supposed to just roll over and let us kill you!
[03:11:50.863 --> 03:11:54.247]  Now, Bow Wow has deleted that, so Anthony Cumia joins us.
[03:11:54.908 --> 03:11:56.529]  Anthony, I'm going to let you take over.
[03:11:56.629 --> 03:11:57.991]  I apologize for jumping into your show.
[03:11:58.431 --> 03:12:04.297]  Of course, it's compoundmedia.com, the Cumia Show, C-U-M-I-A Show on Twitter.
[03:12:04.578 --> 03:12:06.119]  While we're still there, we've been
[03:12:07.108 --> 03:12:10.250]  Strangle back 90% last month on Facebook, Google, Twitter, you name it.
[03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.990]  It's okay.
[03:12:11.010 --> 03:12:11.871]  The listeners are coming to us.
[03:12:11.891 --> 03:12:21.036]  Our numbers have gone up here, but you've been fired off everywhere for, you know, being a conservative or libertarian or just a common sense guy on, you know, you have the top show on XM.
[03:12:21.296 --> 03:12:23.337]  And we had a huge show on XM for like eight years.
[03:12:23.357 --> 03:12:29.581]  And they said, oh, sorry, we're a hundred plus hosts are being kicked off two years ago because Obama wants you off.
[03:12:30.786 --> 03:12:33.107]  They would tell you, are you going to back off Obama or are you going to be off the air?
[03:12:33.427 --> 03:12:35.307]  And we're supposed to just roll over like it's the Soviet Union.
[03:12:35.727 --> 03:12:37.028]  Oh, you know, we're popular.
[03:12:37.228 --> 03:12:38.228]  We're just telling the truth.
[03:12:38.548 --> 03:12:40.408]  Mom and apple pie here just kick us off the air.
[03:12:40.669 --> 03:12:42.809]  The problem is the people now are awake.
[03:12:42.869 --> 03:12:43.689]  They know what's going on.
[03:12:43.709 --> 03:12:44.269]  They're coming to us.
[03:12:44.529 --> 03:12:46.370]  So, so where do you see this whole fight going?
[03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:48.130]  No, no more banner.
[03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:49.951]  I'm going to turn it over to you, Anthony Acumia.
[03:12:49.971 --> 03:12:50.351]  Thank you, sir.
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:51.820]  Thank you.
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:52.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:12:53.080 --> 03:12:53.561]  I love this.
[03:12:54.141 --> 03:12:58.462]  I was getting all pumped up listening to Alex and Mr. Dice there.
[03:12:58.842 --> 03:12:59.922]  It's just amazing.
[03:13:01.323 --> 03:13:03.643]  I feel like re-energized.
[03:13:04.784 --> 03:13:06.784]  We've wanted something like this for so long.
[03:13:06.824 --> 03:13:13.666]  We've been sitting around under at least the eight years of Obama and even before that feeling powerless.
[03:13:14.286 --> 03:13:17.090]  Just feeling so powerless, nothing we could possibly do.
[03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:19.693]  And we didn't say kill anybody when Obama was doing bad stuff.
[03:13:20.234 --> 03:13:22.257]  Imagine if you or I said kill Obama.
[03:13:22.537 --> 03:13:25.341]  It'd be in 500 newspapers or more tomorrow.
[03:13:25.501 --> 03:13:26.162]  We'd be arrested!
[03:13:27.325 --> 03:13:31.489]  The double standard is unbelievable with the left.
[03:13:31.649 --> 03:13:41.259]  That little punk Bow Wow talks about prostituting, sending the first lady, putting her out on the street.
[03:13:41.859 --> 03:13:47.365]  And I was saying on Twitter, I was like, can you imagine if a country artist
[03:13:48.245 --> 03:13:51.586]  You know, because they deem country artists as horrid racists anyway.
[03:13:52.207 --> 03:13:56.908]  A country artist would have said the same thing about Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.
[03:13:57.408 --> 03:14:00.149]  They would have been shunned from society.
[03:14:00.530 --> 03:14:04.231]  Never mind just reprimanded or forced to apologize.
[03:14:04.691 --> 03:14:06.972]  They would have been removed.
[03:14:07.512 --> 03:14:10.394]  From society never to be heard from again.
[03:14:11.075 --> 03:14:12.916]  But that stuff just wasn't happening.
[03:14:13.397 --> 03:14:18.180]  People tried to equate it with Ted Nugent who used to speak...
[03:14:19.540 --> 03:14:21.842]  Actually, quite accurately about Barack Obama.
[03:14:22.123 --> 03:14:25.206]  But people saw that as being horrible and racist and terrible.
[03:14:26.106 --> 03:14:36.616]  Well, the guy, after that, pretty much has to live on his own compound in the middle of nowhere and play guitar for his fans on Periscope.
[03:14:37.137 --> 03:14:38.318]  He has been shunned.
[03:14:38.778 --> 03:14:39.859]  Oh, what about Ted Nugent?
[03:14:39.899 --> 03:14:40.620]  He said some things.
[03:14:40.700 --> 03:14:40.960]  Yeah!
[03:14:41.221 --> 03:14:42.041]  And look where he is!
[03:14:42.802 --> 03:14:45.705]  He had shows cancelled, sponsors that cancelled on him.
[03:14:46.005 --> 03:14:52.611]  Believe me, Ted Nugent is an outcast of society because of his political views.
[03:14:52.951 --> 03:14:57.335]  But because of him, and other people's courage, and you got fired too, we're here.
[03:14:57.375 --> 03:14:58.135]  We kicked their ass.
[03:14:58.536 --> 03:15:02.899]  But a lot of people, including myself, we lost 5 million just last month.
[03:15:02.919 --> 03:15:05.081]  3.3 last year, we're scheduled to make 5 plus million this year.
[03:15:05.341 --> 03:15:09.105]  Google just said, you can't run ads for frickin' multivitamins.
[03:15:09.565 --> 03:15:12.069]  I mean, I go make money outside of here.
[03:15:12.089 --> 03:15:14.814]  I could just be a cold-blooded business guy and make ten times the money.
[03:15:14.834 --> 03:15:15.695]  I'm not stupid.
[03:15:16.437 --> 03:15:18.861]  And, you know, it's just crazy.
[03:15:18.881 --> 03:15:22.607]  I take money from outside to fund the truth, and then they cut that off!
[03:15:23.743 --> 03:15:25.724]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:15:25.764 --> 03:15:26.985]  They're going to great lengths.
[03:15:27.065 --> 03:15:30.847]  As you were explaining before, the desperation is palpable.
[03:15:31.228 --> 03:15:42.654]  It's amazing how desperate the left and globalists and corporations have gotten at this point because they see, uh-oh, they've cracked the surface.
[03:15:43.075 --> 03:15:47.417]  They got a guy in there now who's not one of the regular players.
[03:15:47.838 --> 03:15:48.818]  We are in trouble.
[03:15:48.898 --> 03:15:49.859]  That's their desperation.
[03:15:49.919 --> 03:15:51.480]  And other ones are getting elected everywhere.
[03:15:52.219 --> 03:16:01.684]  Yes, and the usual suspects, the boys club that have been in charge for so long, are freaking out.
[03:16:01.784 --> 03:16:08.508]  And by the way, I'm going to leave here because I don't want to take over, but I'm just going to say this metaphysically, historically, from my gut, everything I've got.
[03:16:09.108 --> 03:16:16.072]  If everybody just keeps pushing forward and taking action and working hard and being good and being classy, but also speaking up and not being intimidated, we're going to win.
[03:16:16.332 --> 03:16:20.715]  Just like against the British, in my very gut, it's going to be a hard fight.
[03:16:21.175 --> 03:16:22.055]  We're going to win
[03:16:39.480 --> 03:16:42.041]  Pipedream globalism, like Peter Thiel has said, is gone.
[03:16:42.281 --> 03:16:42.602]  It's over.
[03:16:42.802 --> 03:16:43.822]  They're already dead.
[03:16:44.102 --> 03:16:48.484]  They're just in a rearguard action buying, you know, redoubts in Tasmania and Kauai.
[03:16:48.604 --> 03:16:49.425]  They admit they're done.
[03:16:49.925 --> 03:16:53.567]  They just hope they can try to reorganize something in some vengeance deal.
[03:16:53.867 --> 03:16:54.607]  They're losers.
[03:16:54.627 --> 03:17:01.430]  And when I say that, it's from the perspective of a winner, who the enemy even credits, our Operation Drudge, you, everybody, as the reason this happened.
[03:17:01.811 --> 03:17:03.712]  We're just the messengers that don't want to be slaves.
[03:17:04.012 --> 03:17:05.693]  I don't care about power or anything.
[03:17:05.713 --> 03:17:06.453]  I want to be independent.
[03:17:06.773 --> 03:17:08.334]  I take it very fundamentally
[03:17:08.854 --> 03:17:11.257]  Personally, that people want to make me their slave.
[03:17:11.517 --> 03:17:12.078]  And my family.
[03:17:12.338 --> 03:17:13.319]  So, they want to fight.
[03:17:13.459 --> 03:17:14.600]  They've got an information war.
[03:17:14.801 --> 03:17:15.762]  They want to start a civil war?
[03:17:15.962 --> 03:17:16.803]  We're not pushing that.
[03:17:16.863 --> 03:17:19.806]  Believe me, guys, a physical fight's much easier against you guys.
[03:17:20.047 --> 03:17:20.707]  I don't want that.
[03:17:21.348 --> 03:17:23.410]  But let me tell you, we're going to win one way or another.
[03:17:23.430 --> 03:17:24.592]  I feel that in my gut.
[03:17:24.932 --> 03:17:26.353]  We're going to skip this break so you have more time.
[03:17:26.373 --> 03:17:29.114]  But take over Anthony Acumia of compoundmedia.com.
[03:17:29.354 --> 03:17:32.435]  Everybody should support the great work you're doing with yourself, Gavin McGinnis, the other guys.
[03:17:32.756 --> 03:17:33.356]  Rock stars.
[03:17:33.636 --> 03:17:35.577]  You know, you're kind of like me, more people 30 and older.
[03:17:35.877 --> 03:17:39.719]  But I got to tell you, Gavin, you know the crew at high school softball games I go to?
[03:17:40.099 --> 03:17:42.080]  Oh, I saw you once on Compound Media.
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:43.781]  Rock stars with the young kids.
[03:17:44.061 --> 03:17:44.701]  That's the truth.
[03:17:44.861 --> 03:17:49.207]  Coveted demographic for folks that don't know that everybody wants forming those minds early.
[03:17:49.447 --> 03:17:50.549]  We're not forming minds.
[03:17:50.769 --> 03:17:52.011]  They've been having their minds formed.
[03:17:52.191 --> 03:17:53.953]  They want the open, free society.
[03:17:54.154 --> 03:17:57.078]  Their genetics, their guts, their spirit gets it.
[03:17:57.118 --> 03:17:58.980]  So Anthony, tell me where you think this is going.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:17:59.341]  Take over.
[03:18:00.543 --> 03:18:01.624]  Great, thanks Alex.
[03:18:02.846 --> 03:18:06.569]  It's one of these situations where we just want the people to be in charge again.
[03:18:07.410 --> 03:18:12.394]  The people have not been in charge for so long, we almost forgot what it was like.
[03:18:13.115 --> 03:18:21.743]  And when you see people being exposed, all those professional politicians that have just been working
[03:18:24.185 --> 03:18:25.746]  A goof on us for so long.
[03:18:25.987 --> 03:18:27.107]  Just a scam!
[03:18:27.468 --> 03:18:31.711]  Getting money, favors, all these things that added up to us being, um...
[03:18:33.877 --> 03:18:34.298]  Slaves!
[03:18:34.738 --> 03:18:38.761]  We really have just been slaves to their whim and will.
[03:18:39.181 --> 03:18:49.069]  And it's great to be able to have these platforms to expose these crooks and criminals for what they are.
[03:18:49.570 --> 03:18:52.572]  And I couldn't be happier that it's actually working.
[03:18:52.933 --> 03:18:55.314]  We've gotten through.
[03:18:55.815 --> 03:18:56.796]  People are listening.
[03:18:57.316 --> 03:18:58.537]  Which is amazing.
[03:18:58.677 --> 03:18:59.138]  I love it.
[03:18:59.498 --> 03:19:10.729]  I love that they can no longer go on network news and just blather on with complete dishonesty and have people believe it because that's all they had.
[03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:12.510]  That's all they had to listen to.
[03:19:13.416 --> 03:19:23.123]  Was network news and cable news outlets that have been exposed as the liars that they are, manipulators that they are with their own agendas.
[03:19:23.603 --> 03:19:30.628]  And what's so bad about wanting to have the people in charge again and have the people free
[03:19:31.448 --> 03:19:48.279]  To pursue what they want in this great country that has so many opportunities, yet the government itself has over the years just cut back on allowing the people to be a free nation and want to excel and do things.
[03:19:48.519 --> 03:19:50.421]  And you see it happening now, you really do.
[03:19:50.761 --> 03:19:56.004]  You start seeing it happening where businesses are coming back, people are
[03:19:57.486 --> 03:19:58.307]  They're excited.
[03:19:58.327 --> 03:20:02.429]  The market's going up because it's not this fake bubble.
[03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:07.693]  People are excited that business is coming back.
[03:20:08.133 --> 03:20:11.416]  People have confidence in this country again.
[03:20:11.436 --> 03:20:14.938]  That things are going to be made in this country.
[03:20:15.319 --> 03:20:19.782]  That we're going to be a strong nation and competitive with the rest of the world once again.
[03:20:20.862 --> 03:20:32.109]  Not bowing and apologizing wherever we go around the globe for what they see as past atrocities that we must just be so sorry for forever.
[03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:38.453]  Those are the kinds of things I'm enjoying seeing coming out of this new media.
[03:20:40.073 --> 03:20:40.954]  And it's refreshing.
[03:20:41.154 --> 03:20:41.694]  It really is.
[03:20:42.875 --> 03:20:48.198]  Talking again about, quickly about Bow Wow and Snoop.
[03:20:48.799 --> 03:20:49.059]  I mean,
[03:20:50.414 --> 03:21:03.044]  There were people that were upset that Bow Wow said that about the First Lady and Snoop portrays a Donald Trump clown in one of his videos and he shoots him.
[03:21:04.105 --> 03:21:04.325]  Yeah.
[03:21:04.865 --> 03:21:06.727]  And it's horrible.
[03:21:08.388 --> 03:21:09.769]  And people were upset about it.
[03:21:10.049 --> 03:21:14.613]  Even some people in that community, the rap community, were upset about it.
[03:21:15.013 --> 03:21:17.015]  But here's what I don't understand.
[03:21:18.496 --> 03:21:21.658]  All Trump has done, Trump has called a racist constantly.
[03:21:22.319 --> 03:21:30.605]  All he ever said about minorities in this country is that they should have the opportunities that everyone else has in this country.
[03:21:31.065 --> 03:21:32.666]  Isn't that a terrible thing to say?
[03:21:33.267 --> 03:21:41.573]  Isn't it terrible that the Democrats for years and years and years, for generations, have kept minorities in this country on a per diem?
[03:21:42.113 --> 03:21:44.833]  Through welfare that keeps them in poverty.
[03:21:45.334 --> 03:21:49.194]  Just keeps them cycle of poverty over and over again.
[03:21:49.574 --> 03:21:55.975]  Which creates the cycle of violence and drug abuse and out of wedlock children.
[03:21:56.255 --> 03:22:02.056]  It's just this thing that continues to happen generation after generation with no one addressing it.
[03:22:02.497 --> 03:22:04.677]  The Democrats only want their votes.
[03:22:05.117 --> 03:22:05.637]  That's it.
[03:22:06.137 --> 03:22:10.758]  But the racist Donald Trump is saying, look we can do so much better.
[03:22:11.318 --> 03:22:16.821]  We can make these inner cities safe again through real law enforcement.
[03:22:17.542 --> 03:22:28.848]  We can give opportunity to people by bringing in more jobs, more industry that has been taken out of this country, and actually give people what this country was about.
[03:22:29.369 --> 03:22:31.930]  The opportunity to be successful.
[03:22:32.411 --> 03:22:36.293]  The life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:22:36.793 --> 03:22:38.495]  Again, it's never a guarantee.
[03:22:38.555 --> 03:22:41.138]  That's the amazing thing about this country.
[03:22:41.538 --> 03:22:42.519]  It's not a guarantee.
[03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:48.446]  But you can increase your odds of being successful by having those opportunities available for you.
[03:22:48.486 --> 03:22:51.469]  Working hard, being innovative.
[03:22:52.690 --> 03:22:53.671]  Educating yourself.
[03:22:54.191 --> 03:23:07.899]  All these things add to your chances that what this country is about will lead to you being a successful person in this country and leading a nice life and having something for the next generation that comes out.
[03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:19.786]  That's all he ever said about minorities in this country, yet it's looked at and talked about like he is a horrible racist.
[03:23:21.338 --> 03:23:31.725]  I don't even know how you interpret that into something other than wonderful for people that have been in this cycle of poverty for so long.
[03:23:32.445 --> 03:23:41.851]  And when you go on social media and you read some of these tweets that come out of black Twitter, which is actually a thing.
[03:23:42.171 --> 03:23:47.795]  It's an amazing part of Twitter where you just read what people in the black community are saying.
[03:23:48.375 --> 03:24:06.100]  And the hatred for Donald Trump and the calls for his assassination and just without even any any thought behind some of these tweets that maybe the Secret Service might knock on your door is astounding to me.
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:09.441]  When all he's saying is we can do much better
[03:24:10.177 --> 03:24:20.501]  Than just ignoring the problem and hoping every two or four years these same people go out and vote for the Democrats on the ticket.
[03:24:21.021 --> 03:24:24.043]  Because that's all they see minorities as.
[03:24:24.723 --> 03:24:29.565]  It's really the crux of everything they do is to get votes.
[03:24:30.225 --> 03:24:30.865]  Welfare.
[03:24:31.366 --> 03:24:34.387]  This illegal immigration into this country.
[03:24:35.748 --> 03:24:40.551]  It's all about control, and them staying in power.
[03:24:41.712 --> 03:24:44.894]  And whoops, it just didn't work last time, did it?
[03:24:45.535 --> 03:24:57.043]  They were so sure it was going to work again for them, and they would have another at least four, maybe eight-year run under Queen Clinton, and it didn't work out.
[03:24:57.483 --> 03:25:00.966]  And they were none too pleased about that.
[03:25:02.841 --> 03:25:16.948]  So, like I said, I don't understand where that comes from, where that mindset of Trump is a bad guy for saying everybody should have the opportunity to share in the wonder that is the United States of America.
[03:25:19.489 --> 03:25:24.111]  Also, the travel ban that he wants to put in place
[03:25:25.214 --> 03:25:43.485]  At every turn, just being knocked down, at every turn, he is not allowed to be the President of the United States because these judges that were appointed by Obama and other Democrats will not let him do his job as President of the United States.
[03:25:44.025 --> 03:25:48.848]  His job, first and foremost, the protection of this country and its people.
[03:25:49.668 --> 03:25:52.550]  And that is what these executive orders have been.
[03:25:53.683 --> 03:26:00.906]  Protecting this nation against terrorists that come into this country in all kinds of ways.
[03:26:02.827 --> 03:26:10.851]  But how about we check out where they're coming from, especially when they're coming in from nations that are known terrorist havens?
[03:26:12.451 --> 03:26:13.452]  Well, that can't be done.
[03:26:14.574 --> 03:26:17.036]  Judges have smacked it down now twice.
[03:26:17.717 --> 03:26:23.243]  He had another executive order drawn up with different language, and it doesn't matter at this point.
[03:26:23.703 --> 03:26:28.327]  It does not matter what he does, what language he puts it in.
[03:26:28.488 --> 03:26:36.556]  There will be judges that will overreach their powers and strike him down.
[03:26:37.296 --> 03:26:38.478]  Like we have in Hawaii.
[03:26:38.778 --> 03:26:40.320]  What a coincidence that is, huh?
[03:26:41.221 --> 03:26:51.956]  Obama's home state, Hawaii, and he just decides he's going to be the one that puts the kibosh on another executive order.
[03:26:53.876 --> 03:26:58.659]  Obama makes surprise visit to Hawaii 48 hours before the judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[03:26:59.139 --> 03:27:01.201]  How insane is that?
[03:27:01.941 --> 03:27:21.175]  If anyone doesn't think, now, you know, I'm maybe the last one to sound conspiratorial, but I mean how many things have to happen before you know this relatively young man, he's one of the youngest presidents that we've had, he's
[03:27:23.261 --> 03:27:26.962]  Obviously one of the youngest ex-presidents we've had.
[03:27:27.363 --> 03:27:31.564]  He's not just gonna fade into the woodwork and retire somewhere.
[03:27:31.884 --> 03:27:33.305]  This guy loves power.
[03:27:33.825 --> 03:27:38.687]  He loves that he had this ability to rule and he's not going away.
[03:27:39.507 --> 03:27:40.187]  He's not going away.
[03:27:41.067 --> 03:27:44.729]  What he's doing is ruling from behind.
[03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:50.591]  He's got a lot of buffers in place and he wants to keep Donald Trump
[03:27:51.556 --> 03:27:55.720]  From succeeding in ripping down his legacy.
[03:27:56.681 --> 03:28:04.248]  A legacy that has done nothing but harm this country and what, we're supposed to be embarrassed for being Americans?
[03:28:05.489 --> 03:28:09.032]  We're supposed to enter the global community and not be exceptional?
[03:28:09.632 --> 03:28:11.594]  Exceptionalism is such a bad word?
[03:28:12.014 --> 03:28:12.875]  We are exceptional.
[03:28:12.915 --> 03:28:14.016]  This country is amazing.
[03:28:14.536 --> 03:28:19.780]  People come here all the time when they need things and they want to get things done.
[03:28:20.240 --> 03:28:21.381]  They come here to America.
[03:28:22.022 --> 03:28:29.367]  And Obama, for eight years, was trying to make the United States just another nation on the globe.
[03:28:29.728 --> 03:28:31.469]  We're no more special than anyone else.
[03:28:31.569 --> 03:28:32.029]  Well, we are.
[03:28:32.810 --> 03:28:35.232]  And Trump being in there is showing this.
[03:28:36.500 --> 03:28:38.181]  And, uh, what are we supposed to do?
[03:28:39.702 --> 03:28:42.423]  Just ignore the fact that he's still pulling strings?
[03:28:43.163 --> 03:28:46.485]  That Obama is still pulling, uh, these strings on people?
[03:28:46.725 --> 03:28:47.846]  And, uh, he's ruling.
[03:28:48.526 --> 03:28:49.626]  He's ruling from behind.
[03:28:49.726 --> 03:28:52.348]  The dark shadow government, as they call it.
[03:28:53.088 --> 03:28:54.349]  And, um, I don't know.
[03:28:54.509 --> 03:29:03.073]  I think it is a little odd that he went there 48 hours before the judge, uh, makes this decision to block Trump's, um, travel ban.
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:05.981]  Oh, it's a Muslim ban.
[03:29:06.302 --> 03:29:06.582]  What?
[03:29:07.323 --> 03:29:10.626]  Aren't Muslims allowed in from every other country except the six on the list?
[03:29:11.807 --> 03:29:15.150]  If a Christian in one of those countries wants to come here, he can't either.
[03:29:15.911 --> 03:29:17.892]  So how is it possibly a Muslim ban?
[03:29:18.733 --> 03:29:20.715]  And don't, haven't we bombed some of those countries?
[03:29:21.416 --> 03:29:23.998]  Does it mean we're just bombing them because they're Muslim?
[03:29:24.879 --> 03:29:26.821]  Wouldn't that be the same exact thing?
[03:29:28.058 --> 03:29:28.799]  We bomb Muslims.
[03:29:29.539 --> 03:29:31.681]  Was Obama bombing Muslims for all those years?
[03:29:32.502 --> 03:29:33.142]  I guess he was.
[03:29:33.903 --> 03:29:36.525]  That seems to be exactly what they believe.
[03:29:36.565 --> 03:29:39.928]  That if anything happens in those countries, it's because they're Muslim.
[03:29:41.029 --> 03:29:41.769]  That's ludicrous.
[03:29:41.909 --> 03:29:42.590]  It's ridiculous.
[03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:43.531]  Things are changing.
[03:29:43.551 --> 03:29:44.091]  We're seeing it.
[03:29:44.691 --> 03:29:45.092]  I love it.
[03:29:46.013 --> 03:29:48.434]  We'll be back in a matter of moments.
[03:29:48.775 --> 03:29:49.375]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:29:49.395 --> 03:29:50.936]  InfoWars.com.
[03:29:50.956 --> 03:29:51.737]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:29:53.018 --> 03:29:54.619]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.639 --> 03:29:58.361]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.283 --> 03:30:10.187]  In his latest move to cut into the budget, President Trump has proposed killing all funding for PBS, NPR, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[03:30:10.427 --> 03:30:20.932]  This budget cut would include $445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $148 million from the National Endowments, and $230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[03:30:21.152 --> 03:30:25.615]  This budget cut totals $823 million, .02% of the bloated U.S.
[03:30:25.675 --> 03:30:28.557]  government's... 2 hundredths of a percent of the bloated U.S.
[03:30:28.617 --> 03:30:30.618]  government's $4.6 trillion budget.
[03:30:30.878 --> 03:30:41.566]  Now, the tears will start to flow with this proposition, but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget, and when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit, sacrifices have to be made.
[03:30:41.766 --> 03:30:47.730]  This is just a proposal, so no, your local library or museum is not shutting down, and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[03:30:47.970 --> 03:30:51.152]  As for some of these operations, the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[03:30:51.172 --> 03:30:51.852]  We're good to go.
[03:31:03.055 --> 03:31:04.476]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:31:04.656 --> 03:31:07.056]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.

[03:31:52.276 --> 03:31:56.818]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:31:56.838 --> 03:31:58.198]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:32:12.182 --> 03:32:14.062]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:32:14.683 --> 03:32:20.244]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:32:20.824 --> 03:32:28.806]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:32:28.826 --> 03:32:31.287]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:32:31.587 --> 03:32:35.808]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.

[03:33:26.425 --> 03:33:33.488]  The all-new MycoZX Fungus and Yeast Cleanser is almost sold out at Infowarslife.com.

[03:34:23.477 --> 03:34:23.857]  Yes!
[03:34:25.618 --> 03:34:27.179]  Welcome, welcome back.
[03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:29.461]  InfoWars.com.
[03:34:29.801 --> 03:34:34.865]  I'm Anthony Cumia, here at the Compound Media Facility in New York.
[03:34:35.205 --> 03:34:36.586]  Oh, unfortunately.
[03:34:37.087 --> 03:34:39.709]  I envy the people down in Texas.
[03:34:40.812 --> 03:34:44.533]  And they feel like they're, you know, under a dictatorship a lot of times.
[03:34:44.573 --> 03:34:51.135]  But man, when you're in New York, it is just a, oh, a disaster of liberalism.
[03:34:51.655 --> 03:35:03.358]  They had, what's her name, Gilda Brand, that senator we have here in New York, given the Commandant of the Marines, the old what have you.
[03:35:04.153 --> 03:35:15.080]  Giving him a load of garbage because of this sex photo, I guess nude photos of some of the marine women, or at least one of them.
[03:35:15.220 --> 03:35:16.180]  I don't even know how many.
[03:35:17.441 --> 03:35:18.142]  These pictures were...
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:25.646]  Uh, given to a Marine by her, uh, when they were boyfriend and girlfriend.
[03:35:26.107 --> 03:35:29.690]  And when they broke up, uh, the guy decided to post them in public.
[03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:32.453]  This has been happening since the Internet.
[03:35:33.053 --> 03:35:34.174]  I mean, it's nothing new.
[03:35:35.035 --> 03:35:39.419]  Um, but again, they make it sound like it's running rampant.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:44.004]  That this, uh, this whole thing's running rampant, um, in the Marines.
[03:35:44.781 --> 03:35:47.043]  When it's actually an isolated incident.
[03:35:47.524 --> 03:36:04.780]  But the Commandant of the Marines had to sit there and listen to Jildebrand just lay into him about how the Marine Corps has to change, the ideology has to change, and I just don't understand it.
[03:36:05.572 --> 03:36:12.300]  We need the Marines to be these aggressive, over-the-top, trained killers.
[03:36:13.642 --> 03:36:17.066]  It might sound crazy in 2017, but that's their job.
[03:36:17.687 --> 03:36:25.176]  Their job is to be ready to defend this nation and kill people.
[03:36:26.954 --> 03:36:39.520]  That whole attitude that they pump these Marines up with is not conducive to having young ladies thrown in there and think they're going to be treated in a gentlemanly fashion.
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:40.201]  Sorry.
[03:36:41.982 --> 03:36:45.583]  Sexuality is hardwired into us as human beings.
[03:36:46.624 --> 03:36:53.207]  And if you think that can change with sensitivity training, you're sorely mistaken.
[03:36:54.291 --> 03:36:57.533]  These are very aggressive young men.
[03:36:58.533 --> 03:36:59.514]  They're trained that way.
[03:37:00.194 --> 03:37:03.075]  They need to be trained that way.
[03:37:03.335 --> 03:37:12.860]  So, good luck in finding Marines that will be killers and gentlemen at the same time.
[03:37:14.401 --> 03:37:15.441]  It just doesn't happen that way.
[03:37:15.701 --> 03:37:21.444]  But to see the Commandant of the Marines getting bitched out, as it were,
[03:37:22.262 --> 03:37:25.203]  By a couple of these women senators.
[03:37:25.763 --> 03:37:26.924]  Feminists and whatnot.
[03:37:27.164 --> 03:37:31.865]  It was just... It hurt.
[03:37:32.666 --> 03:37:33.186]  It hurt a bit.
[03:37:33.226 --> 03:37:33.886]  Look at this guy.
[03:37:34.346 --> 03:37:42.289]  Do you think this guy... Do you think this general wants to be yelled at?
[03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:45.170]  By a senator woman?
[03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.670]  Hell no!
[03:37:47.451 --> 03:37:48.571]  He doesn't.
[03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:52.432]  But he had to sit there and apologize.
[03:37:52.492 --> 03:37:54.413]  It was dreadful to watch.
[03:37:54.813 --> 03:37:56.375]  And I felt for him.
[03:37:57.876 --> 03:38:00.618]  Other things that are happening in this wonderful world.
[03:38:01.659 --> 03:38:09.665]  I guess people are mad now because the National Endowment for the Arts won't be getting the funding it was getting for years and years and years.
[03:38:11.567 --> 03:38:12.568]  Trump wants to cut that.
[03:38:13.569 --> 03:38:14.950]  He's got better things to pay for.
[03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:16.551]  What do you think?
[03:38:16.591 --> 03:38:17.372]  He's got the wall.
[03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:23.262]  That'd be paid for before he goes in and grabs it from Mexico.
[03:38:23.923 --> 03:38:27.144]  But, you know, he got paid for it somehow at the start.
[03:38:27.525 --> 03:38:30.947]  And the military is going to get a few billion dollars.
[03:38:31.947 --> 03:38:33.968]  So we need some money.
[03:38:34.489 --> 03:38:44.774]  And I don't think the National Endowment for the Arts should be a federally funded operation because of things like, remember Piss Christ it was called?
[03:38:45.555 --> 03:38:49.217]  It was a crucifix in a jar of urine.
[03:38:50.735 --> 03:38:54.996]  Um, that was, uh, that was, uh, that was art.
[03:38:56.117 --> 03:38:59.358]  And, um, the National Endowment for the Arts loved that one.
[03:38:59.878 --> 03:39:07.680]  And how about, uh, there was, uh, elephant crap was used to, uh, create a picture of the Virgin Mary, also.
[03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:13.562]  This was more of the artwork that we, uh, taxpayers had to, uh, fund.
[03:39:14.662 --> 03:39:16.583]  And, um, yeah.
[03:39:17.296 --> 03:39:18.297]  I think we could do without it.
[03:39:18.397 --> 03:39:25.781]  If you want to show your art, if you want to support the arts, that's fine.
[03:39:26.222 --> 03:39:29.023]  But I don't think taxpayers should be forced to anymore.
[03:39:30.925 --> 03:39:31.245]  What else?
[03:39:31.285 --> 03:39:31.945]  Sesame Street.
[03:39:33.686 --> 03:39:34.687]  Isn't that a popular show?
[03:39:34.707 --> 03:39:36.668]  It's popular, you know.
[03:39:37.329 --> 03:39:38.229]  Support it.
[03:39:38.289 --> 03:39:39.850]  I watch public television.
[03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:43.172]  They go, oh, and this was supported by... And there are other groups.
[03:39:43.232 --> 03:39:44.573]  They don't need to be federally funded.
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:50.242]  And for how they're indoctrinating children on Sesame Street.
[03:39:50.262 --> 03:39:55.424]  I don't want to sound too crazy, but they got an agenda over there.
[03:39:56.065 --> 03:40:02.328]  And they're teaching the kids quite the liberal ideology.
[03:40:04.069 --> 03:40:06.810]  Rachel Maddow, I gotta mention this.
[03:40:07.709 --> 03:40:11.491]  Oh my dear Lord, what were they thinking over there at MSNBC?
[03:40:12.612 --> 03:40:21.016]  They've been talking Trump's taxes for... My God, the second he announced his candidacy, they wanted to see his taxes.
[03:40:22.657 --> 03:40:32.922]  Well, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC got a hold of Trump's 2005 tax return, and let me tell you, scandalous.
[03:40:33.783 --> 03:40:36.324]  It appears, it appears,
[03:40:37.159 --> 03:40:40.583]  He made a lot of money and paid a lot of taxes.
[03:40:41.804 --> 03:40:44.147]  That seems to be what the big exclusive was.
[03:40:44.688 --> 03:40:56.581]  She sat there like an idiot trying to twist this thing around and make it a negative on Donald Trump.
[03:40:57.620 --> 03:41:02.284]  And even, yes, even Stephen Colbert mocked Rachel Maddow.
[03:41:02.304 --> 03:41:08.429]  Now, Colbert and his show is one of the most, oh my God, just liberal drivel.
[03:41:09.290 --> 03:41:11.011]  Constantly bashing Trump.
[03:41:11.732 --> 03:41:15.635]  He seems to be doing better these days doing that, so he's not going to stop anytime soon.
[03:41:15.995 --> 03:41:20.059]  But even he and the liberals can't defend
[03:41:21.101 --> 03:41:35.805]  Rachel Maddow talking about Trump's tax return and just exposing that he did indeed pay at a much higher rate than many of her heroes, including the Obamas and Bernie Sanders.
[03:41:37.265 --> 03:41:43.347]  He paid a higher tax rate, paid millions and millions of dollars in taxes and made a lot of money too.
[03:41:43.467 --> 03:41:50.249]  So it dispelled two things, that he's a failure as a businessman and that he didn't pay his taxes.
[03:41:52.336 --> 03:41:56.979]  And if he did indeed leak these, he's more brilliant than we ever could have imagined.
[03:41:57.699 --> 03:41:59.280]  Than we ever could have imagined.
[03:42:01.802 --> 03:42:02.802]  Because they fell for it.
[03:42:03.443 --> 03:42:04.963]  They took it hook, line, and sinker.
[03:42:07.785 --> 03:42:12.408]  Trump 05 tax return was sterling because Melania needed citizenship.
[03:42:15.225 --> 03:42:23.126]  The attempts they're making at trying to find something bad that he did is astounding.
[03:42:24.067 --> 03:42:26.087]  And she wound up looking very foolish.
[03:42:26.427 --> 03:42:32.528]  What were they thinking when they got the tax form and looked at it and knew they had nothing?
[03:42:32.648 --> 03:42:34.109]  What were they thinking then?
[03:42:34.809 --> 03:42:35.629]  Go on anyway?
[03:42:36.569 --> 03:42:42.010]  Were they hallucinating because they had heard that there must be something bad in it?
[03:42:42.947 --> 03:42:45.429]  So they thought if they just go on the air, something will appear?
[03:42:45.449 --> 03:42:47.070]  I don't know.
[03:42:47.731 --> 03:42:51.814]  But I'm very glad she looked very foolish.
[03:42:53.155 --> 03:42:53.936]  Rachel Maddow.
[03:42:55.937 --> 03:42:59.140]  The other thing I wanted to talk about was... Yeah, there she is.
[03:42:59.260 --> 03:42:59.600]  Fail.
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:00.361]  That's what they're doing.
[03:43:00.681 --> 03:43:02.863]  They're just calling it a giant fail.
[03:43:04.751 --> 03:43:11.436]  Another thing, the CIA and our gadgetry around our houses.
[03:43:12.056 --> 03:43:14.878]  This is another thing that intrigues me.
[03:43:16.239 --> 03:43:20.922]  Did you know that all of your electronics aren't self-contained?
[03:43:21.523 --> 03:43:27.547]  When you talk on your phone, when you send Siri an inquiry, it goes somewhere.
[03:43:28.307 --> 03:43:29.728]  And then it comes back to your phone.
[03:43:32.102 --> 03:43:32.743]  And that's that.
[03:43:33.003 --> 03:43:41.890]  You've put your voice and your ideas and everything in a cloud server that is to be used by anybody.
[03:43:42.610 --> 03:43:47.154]  And it appears the CIA is very interested in what people are talking about.
[03:43:48.235 --> 03:43:58.623]  If you have a Samsung Smart TV, it can be off in your house and people can still monitor what you're talking about in your own home.
[03:43:59.912 --> 03:44:02.213]  A lot of people would say, well, I'm not doing anything bad.
[03:44:03.174 --> 03:44:03.734]  What does it matter?
[03:44:04.334 --> 03:44:08.356]  I'm not saying anything the CIA would worry about.
[03:44:09.517 --> 03:44:11.217]  Well, think of this scenario.
[03:44:12.858 --> 03:44:14.899]  Think of what you say in the privacy of your own home.
[03:44:15.919 --> 03:44:20.181]  I bet there are certain times you might say something that could be deemed very offensive, maybe.
[03:44:20.822 --> 03:44:27.325]  If that then becomes a recording, what if you're running for public office in years from now?
[03:44:28.877 --> 03:44:31.298]  And a tape comes out of you saying something horrible.
[03:44:32.819 --> 03:44:35.181]  Well... Oh, it couldn't happen?
[03:44:36.982 --> 03:44:38.823]  Oh boy, that's power right there.
[03:44:39.803 --> 03:44:41.564]  Having something to blackmail somebody with.
[03:44:43.145 --> 03:44:45.746]  So, I don't know, it's a strange thing.
[03:44:45.927 --> 03:44:50.689]  All of these gadgets have always been presented to us to be conveniences.
[03:44:52.490 --> 03:44:53.731]  A TV you can talk to?
[03:44:54.751 --> 03:45:00.593]  And it changes the channels and goes to various other ways of watching programming?
[03:45:00.613 --> 03:45:03.254]  Yeah, I'll put that in my house.
[03:45:03.735 --> 03:45:09.717]  If the CIA knocked on your door and said, Hi, we'd like to put a bug in your house.
[03:45:11.050 --> 03:45:12.210]  Wouldn't you chase him away?
[03:45:12.871 --> 03:45:24.514]  If, like the 50s and 60s movies, a floating orb around your city was peering in your window at night with a stamp of the government on it, you'd be a little upset, wouldn't you?
[03:45:25.855 --> 03:45:27.335]  But it's a TV you can talk to!
[03:45:27.975 --> 03:45:30.236]  We've always wanted cool stuff like that, haven't we?
[03:45:30.856 --> 03:45:32.717]  So you hang it right up on your wall and
[03:45:34.116 --> 03:45:37.659]  And you just put your own bug in your own house.
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:41.682]  That's how all of this stuff is given to us.
[03:45:42.503 --> 03:45:44.104]  Leave the house without your phone.
[03:45:44.404 --> 03:45:45.285]  You freak out.
[03:45:45.846 --> 03:45:49.929]  You'll lose your mind because you're not connected anymore.
[03:45:50.646 --> 03:46:04.737]  Well, you're walking around with, remember they used to say that the government was going to put chips in everybody, tracking devices, and you'd have cameras constantly watching you and recording what you say, watch what you say.
[03:46:07.039 --> 03:46:12.704]  Well, again, if anybody asked you and said they wanted to do that, you'd lose your mind and say no.
[03:46:13.505 --> 03:46:17.468]  We voluntarily have picked up tracking devices.
[03:46:18.323 --> 03:46:21.765]  And we actually lose our minds and freak out when we don't have them on us.
[03:46:22.905 --> 03:46:26.887]  It's really brilliant if this was the plan, and I think it was.
[03:46:27.467 --> 03:46:35.191]  I don't know who, where, what, but man, make them want to carry the tracking device.
[03:46:35.891 --> 03:46:37.872]  Make them want to bug their house.
[03:46:39.353 --> 03:46:47.997]  Cars are becoming more autonomous, and they communicate with the internet, and they know where you're going.
[03:46:49.133 --> 03:46:52.974]  Yeah, we'd like to know exactly where you go every day.
[03:46:53.634 --> 03:46:54.534]  Yeah, screw you.
[03:46:55.034 --> 03:46:55.694]  I'm not going to do it.
[03:46:56.334 --> 03:46:56.694]  All right.
[03:46:57.275 --> 03:46:58.215]  Hey, check this car out.
[03:46:58.275 --> 03:47:01.015]  It's got GPS and navigation and everything.
[03:47:01.035 --> 03:47:01.595]  Oh, great.
[03:47:01.635 --> 03:47:02.235]  It's convenient.
[03:47:02.555 --> 03:47:03.236]  Yes, it is.
[03:47:04.636 --> 03:47:05.476]  Happy driving.
[03:47:06.176 --> 03:47:07.616]  And you're now being tracked.
[03:47:09.237 --> 03:47:13.257]  It will always come as doing you a favor.
[03:47:14.238 --> 03:47:15.918]  As making your life easier.
[03:47:17.169 --> 03:47:26.475]  That's how these things enter our lives and these gadgets that run our houses now turn on and off lights.
[03:47:26.876 --> 03:47:28.597]  It sounds so innocent and simple.
[03:47:30.018 --> 03:47:30.838]  Remember the clapper?
[03:47:32.019 --> 03:47:33.520]  You could talk all day to your clapper.
[03:47:33.660 --> 03:47:34.561]  It wasn't gonna rat you out.
[03:47:35.461 --> 03:47:40.622]  But now, uh, you got these devices running your house like the Amazon Alexa and whatnot.
[03:47:40.682 --> 03:47:46.663]  You say, Alexa, turn on kitchen lights and it does it and it'll tell you things and tell you the weather and everything.
[03:47:47.143 --> 03:47:48.664]  And it's listening to everything you say.
[03:47:50.424 --> 03:47:58.626]  Um, and, and keeping a record of comings and goings at your house and what you've been saying, who you talk to.
[03:47:59.126 --> 03:48:02.327]  It really is, um, amazing.
[03:48:03.907 --> 03:48:03.967]  Uh,
[03:48:05.436 --> 03:48:07.076]  I have one of these devices in my house.
[03:48:07.137 --> 03:48:08.977]  It's been unplugged for quite a while.
[03:48:09.417 --> 03:48:15.419]  But just the other day, because it was in the news, I decided to plug it in and just see what happens.
[03:48:16.519 --> 03:48:18.380]  It just starts up out of nowhere sometimes.
[03:48:19.220 --> 03:48:25.202]  The blue ring on top lights up and it just says, I cannot answer that question.
[03:48:25.842 --> 03:48:27.062]  And I said nothing.
[03:48:27.762 --> 03:48:30.283]  I think it's talking to the TV sometimes.
[03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:41.028]  Which is really frightening if you think about the TV says something and then a machine on the table is talking back to it in my own house.
[03:48:41.789 --> 03:48:46.033]  This is a vision of the future I don't think we ever imagined.
[03:48:46.873 --> 03:48:58.864]  We imagined flying cars and wristwatch televisions but we never imagined we'd have devices chit-chatting with each other gathering up our information
[03:49:00.052 --> 03:49:03.733]  And shipping it off out of our house to places unknown.
[03:49:04.614 --> 03:49:07.535]  I don't know where my inquiries go.
[03:49:08.335 --> 03:49:10.216]  They go to someplace called the cloud.
[03:49:11.016 --> 03:49:16.298]  They go to a server that we don't even know what it is, where it is, who has access to it.
[03:49:16.558 --> 03:49:18.199]  But we freely do this.
[03:49:19.199 --> 03:49:22.120]  And I think we should be more concerned.
[03:49:22.601 --> 03:49:26.142]  But as humans, we just like conveniences.
[03:49:28.206 --> 03:49:42.714]  So like I was saying just before, if it was a planned thing to get us to want to be monitored, it's one of the most brilliant moves in human history.
[03:49:45.435 --> 03:49:55.440]  They've gotten almost everything they wanted as far as monitoring the general public and bugging them and putting them on camera constantly.
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:49:57.961]  And we wanted it.
[03:49:58.441 --> 03:49:59.582]  We screamed for it.
[03:49:59.962 --> 03:50:01.183]  We save up for it.
[03:50:01.603 --> 03:50:05.005]  We go into debt to bug our own houses.
[03:50:07.306 --> 03:50:07.786]  Astounding.
[03:50:08.287 --> 03:50:08.867]  It really is.
[03:50:09.827 --> 03:50:12.129]  Do I sound panicky sometimes with this?
[03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.529]  Maybe.
[03:50:13.069 --> 03:50:15.651]  But these things are being used against
[03:50:16.933 --> 03:50:17.174]  People.
[03:50:17.874 --> 03:50:19.415]  Easy Pass is a prime example.
[03:50:19.455 --> 03:50:23.699]  One of the very early things we put in our lives to make it more convenient.
[03:50:23.739 --> 03:50:25.701]  Who wants to wait at a toll booth line?
[03:50:25.741 --> 03:50:28.203]  Who wants to get change from somebody?
[03:50:28.583 --> 03:50:29.624]  Like a whiz right through.
[03:50:29.684 --> 03:50:30.265]  It's convenient.
[03:50:31.165 --> 03:50:41.574]  And then there you are in court explaining why you went through that toll booth at that time, and your wife is mad at you, and your divorce lawyer is mad, and it's always presented as a convenience.
[03:50:42.495 --> 03:50:44.517]  Anthony Cumia in for InfoWars.com.
[03:50:45.537 --> 03:50:46.638]  Um, we'll come back, right?
[03:50:47.339 --> 03:50:47.979]  Coming back again?
[03:50:47.999 --> 03:50:50.801]  Yeah, we'll be right back in a couple of moments.
[03:50:50.861 --> 03:50:52.282]  Don't you go anywhere.
[03:51:06.293 --> 03:51:07.974]  Roger, is this not incredible, my friend?
[03:51:09.252 --> 03:51:15.593]  Alex, I think we are on the cusp of the greatest single political scandal in American history.
[03:51:16.234 --> 03:51:18.894]  The deep state has been hit with a double whammy.
[03:51:19.934 --> 03:51:32.397]  They have gotten caught spying on the nominee of one of the two major parties and their rationale, their phony rationale for that spying has now been disproved.
[03:51:33.631 --> 03:51:55.606]  We now know that the Obama administration, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever and no probable cause, went to the FISA court, the secret, super secret FISA court, first in June, requesting that Donald Trump and his associates, including yours truly, be put under surveillance.
[03:51:56.306 --> 03:51:58.668]  And they were, we believe, denied.
[03:51:59.602 --> 03:52:16.856]  We now know that they went back in October with something more narrowly drawn as far as candidate Trump is concerned, and this secret warrant to spy on the Republican nominee for president was approved.
[03:52:17.117 --> 03:52:19.879]  Here it is, Catherine Herdage.
[03:52:20.259 --> 03:52:23.262]  Top-level state operatives leak Flynn phone call transcripts.
[03:52:23.502 --> 03:52:25.704]  We already know that, but when she goes on Fox News,
[03:52:26.044 --> 03:52:29.747]  She's heavily embedded with the CIA and defense intelligence, you name it.
[03:52:30.047 --> 03:52:34.551]  When that lady, I got a spy chief, gets on there and says that, you know, they're totally turning on him.
[03:52:34.571 --> 03:52:38.935]  And didn't Trump set him up, having them deny it for three days before all this comes out?
[03:52:38.975 --> 03:52:39.555]  Let's be clear.
[03:52:39.816 --> 03:52:41.037]  This didn't come from the Russians.
[03:52:41.097 --> 03:52:43.579]  This came from the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:52:43.819 --> 03:52:44.820]  And I was told a week ago,
[03:52:45.220 --> 03:52:47.162]  Get ready for the next hammer to drop next week.
[03:52:47.462 --> 03:52:48.343]  Relax, Alex.
[03:52:48.583 --> 03:52:49.204]  Trump's on it.
[03:52:49.584 --> 03:52:51.085]  And so they want a war with Trump, man.
[03:52:51.125 --> 03:52:51.766]  That is showing.
[03:52:51.786 --> 03:52:52.547]  He knows what he's doing.
[03:52:52.687 --> 03:52:59.292]  The dirty tricks and the tactics of the deep state have now been, you know, exposed for everybody to see.
[03:52:59.312 --> 03:53:03.136]  These criminals have to be dragged in front of a grand jury one by one.
[03:53:03.736 --> 03:53:07.559]  In all honesty, I don't think a congressional inquiry is the way to go.
[03:53:07.579 --> 03:53:15.166]  We need indictments under national security for illegal spying and sabotage for private corporate interests against the United States of America.
[03:53:15.186 --> 03:53:16.047]  It's espionage.
[03:53:16.287 --> 03:53:17.087]  It's a new type though.
[03:53:17.107 --> 03:53:19.750]  It's corporate espionage against the republic.
[03:53:19.970 --> 03:53:20.971]  That's what globalism is.
[03:53:22.450 --> 03:53:38.595]  It is not wise to go to Congress for a totally politicized investigation in which nattering nabobs of negativism, like Elijah Cummings, blather on and on about the CIA and these allegations without a shred.
[03:53:38.735 --> 03:53:46.602]  It's in the CIA data dump that they were trying to set up Trump and his confidants with fake servers from Russia and fake cyber attacks.
[03:53:46.622 --> 03:53:52.306]  So we now know we have the head of the Intelligence Committee in the House saying no evidence, no phone calls, no nothing.
[03:53:52.567 --> 03:53:54.648]  So they've been caught with a bluff of surveillance.
[03:53:54.989 --> 03:53:56.070]  They did the surveillance.
[03:53:56.350 --> 03:53:59.312]  Now they're trying to say they didn't do it, even though a month ago they bragged they do it.
[03:53:59.653 --> 03:54:01.014]  They are up the creek without a paddle.
[03:54:10.975 --> 03:54:14.471]  I got to run to keep from heading.
[03:54:15.034 --> 03:54:15.978]  I love that song.

[03:55:22.829 --> 03:55:23.349]  Hi, people.
[03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:29.751]  We'll finish up today with, I guess, a sign of the impending apocalypse.
[03:55:31.192 --> 03:55:37.474]  Detroit mother and son share transitional journey to father and daughter.
[03:55:38.598 --> 03:55:39.398]  Yes, you heard right.
[03:55:40.899 --> 03:55:49.201]  A mother and son are transitioning to a father and daughter.
[03:55:50.601 --> 03:55:53.962]  Now, who am I to say what you do?
[03:55:54.623 --> 03:55:55.183]  I don't care.
[03:55:55.883 --> 03:55:57.023]  I really don't care.
[03:55:57.623 --> 03:56:06.606]  But this is looked at as like a great heroic thing instead of the freak show, which it should be looked at as.
[03:56:07.991 --> 03:56:12.553]  Um, I guess the mom, the son, I don't even know what to call it.
[03:56:13.274 --> 03:56:14.834]  I don't even know how to present this.
[03:56:15.815 --> 03:56:32.903]  Back in September 2015, the story of 15-year-old Corey Mason's decision to become a female went viral through a video showing mom Erica's support for the teen to get hormone treatment at 15, because that's what you want to do.
[03:56:33.423 --> 03:56:35.804]  You want to make that life decision at 15 years old.
[03:56:36.716 --> 03:56:37.616]  Or younger sometimes.
[03:56:38.157 --> 03:56:43.038]  I've heard people six, seven years old, their parents are like, yeah, he wants to be a girl.
[03:56:43.299 --> 03:56:44.799]  You can make a life decision at six.
[03:56:45.960 --> 03:56:52.962]  If I made a life decision at six, I would be a dinosaur because I think I wanted to be a dinosaur.
[03:56:53.603 --> 03:56:58.664]  That's that's the kind of goofy decisions six year olds and seven year olds make.
[03:56:58.965 --> 03:57:05.167]  But then the mother decides she wanted to become a father.
[03:57:06.902 --> 03:57:12.407]  Uh, she was, uh, she used to wish for cancer so that she would have to get a mastectomy.
[03:57:12.688 --> 03:57:18.252]  How insane and mentally damaged is, uh, this person?
[03:57:19.694 --> 03:57:24.778]  Uh, the only regret I have is not being educated sooner about what transgenderism was.
[03:57:25.759 --> 03:57:28.842]  And, uh, so I could do it sooner, she added.
[03:57:30.725 --> 03:57:33.507]  Um, sometimes our children lead the way.
[03:57:34.088 --> 03:57:37.550]  Cori, 14, socially transitioned from boy to girl the past few years.
[03:57:38.611 --> 03:57:43.795]  Uh, she gave her mom, Eric, uh... See what they did there?
[03:57:44.575 --> 03:57:53.381]  Erica, or Eric, uh... Uh, the courage to begin our own transition from female to male.
[03:57:54.082 --> 03:57:58.145]  They are moving in opposite directions, but towards their true selves.
[03:57:59.563 --> 03:58:02.787]  See, this has to be presented for what it is.
[03:58:03.168 --> 03:58:10.757]  This is the whole everything is fine liberal ideology.
[03:58:11.818 --> 03:58:13.560]  And again, I don't care what you do.
[03:58:14.682 --> 03:58:15.322]  It's your life.
[03:58:15.723 --> 03:58:16.444]  Have fun with it.
[03:58:17.612 --> 03:58:32.843]  But the fact that it's looked at as courageous and honest heroics and courage these days are looked at horribly as some form of male shamanism or misogyny.
[03:58:33.924 --> 03:58:35.626]  But this is courageous.
[03:58:36.266 --> 03:58:37.087]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:58:37.187 --> 03:58:39.148]  Anthony Cumia, inforinfowars.com.
[03:58:39.448 --> 03:58:40.669]  See me on Compound Media.
[03:58:40.729 --> 03:58:41.450]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:58:44.955 --> 03:58:48.938]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:59.904]  In his latest move to cut into the budget, President Trump has proposed killing all funding for PBS, NPR, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[03:59:00.144 --> 03:59:10.631]  This budget cut would include $445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $148 million from the National Endowments, and $230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[03:59:10.871 --> 03:59:15.338]  This budget cut totals $823 million, .02% of the bloated U.S.
[03:59:15.378 --> 03:59:18.282]  government's $0.02% of the bloated U.S.
[03:59:18.322 --> 03:59:20.345]  government's $4.6 trillion budget.
[03:59:20.586 --> 03:59:26.154]  Now, the tears will start to flow with this proposition, but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget.
[03:59:26.314 --> 03:59:31.277]  And when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit, sacrifices have to be made.
[03:59:31.477 --> 03:59:32.617]  This is just a proposal.
[03:59:32.758 --> 03:59:37.440]  So no, your local library or museum is not shutting down, and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[03:59:37.660 --> 03:59:41.082]  As for some of these operations, the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[03:59:41.162 --> 03:59:46.205]  But for those to which it is, this is a warning sign to start making money or start looking for a new job.
[03:59:46.325 --> 03:59:46.745]  The U.S.
[03:59:46.785 --> 03:59:49.206]  taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[03:59:49.467 --> 03:59:51.808]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:59:53.911 --> 03:59:59.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
