[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.320]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.081]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.561]  It's Wednesday, February the 8th, 2017.
[00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.262]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:37.485]  Tonight, the EU is unraveling as nationalist candidates are rising in popularity and Greek debt is spiraling out of control.
[00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:46.628]  Meanwhile, violence continues to spread in Europe as more sexual abuse is reported, this time by asylum seekers in Germany and France.
[00:00:56.858 --> 00:01:06.600]  Also, the mainstream media continues to ignore crimes being done in Haiti as prosecutors further a case against the new Haitian president, a Clinton stooge.
[00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:16.403]  And then, campuses all over the nation are openly calling themselves sanctuary campuses in a public stand against President Trump's new immigration policies.
[00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:20.304]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:03.583]  Well, France is about to have an election.
[00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:08.244]  And as we see in the campaign, we had Marine Le Pen characterize it this way.
[00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:11.545]  She said, this election is about a choice of civilizations.
[00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.225]  We are at a crossroads.
[00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:19.947]  She said, the division is no longer between the right and the left, but between patriot and globalist.
[00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:21.427]  And that is exactly right.
[00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:31.469]  As some people in Germany have called it, it is a decision, when we look at these open borders, these mass migrations that are being encouraged by the globalist, it is a great people replacement.
[00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:38.212]  So do the people who are in these areas want to retain their culture, retain their sovereignty, or are they going to be replaced?
[00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:43.894]  And of course, one of the reasons that the globalists want to do that is because they want a soft kill.
[00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:49.416]  They're going to move to a situation where all the population is going to be heavily controlled, heavily concentrated.
[00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:51.777]  They're going to have automation replace the jobs.
[00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:55.698]  They won't really need us because they won't need slave labor in third world countries.
[00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.819]  They won't even need slave labor in our country.
[00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.180]  They'll have robots.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.661]  to replace this, and of course the term robot originally meant slave, that's where the robot came from, it was a Slavic name.
[00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:14.883]  But they want to be able to divide and conquer the peoples in the areas in the West, in Europe and in America, the people that could mount an opposition to the globalist takeover.
[00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:28.245]  So when we look at the Davos man, these people who talk about the fact that they have no allegiance, no affinity for any nation, they see themselves as globalists who are above and beyond ordinary people, they want to have a soft kill.
[00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:34.389]  And the way that they can do that is to have a divide-and-conquer, a kind of Tower of Babel situation.
[00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.930]  Now this is the way the French presidential candidate described it.
[00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.836]  She said she blasted globalization, Islamic fundamentalism in her closing speech Sunday on a two-day national front party conference.
[00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:50.960]  She called Islam and globalism two totalitarianisms.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.341]  And that is precisely what they are.
[00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:58.465]  We have to understand that they're two totalitarianisms, but they're working together in the same goal.
[00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:01.407]  You see, one is a tool of the other.
[00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:03.049]  That's the way Islam is being used.
[00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.770]  She said, we're at a crossroads.
[00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:06.913]  She said, I have three children.
[00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:08.594]  They're young citizens.
[00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:13.479]  Will your young children have the rights and the cultures of our current generation?
[00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.241]  Will they even speak the French language?
[00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:23.969]  She unveiled 144 commitments and an agenda that envisions a France that is unshackled from the European Union and from NATO.
[00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:31.894]  And that ensures work, health care, and other services for its own citizens along with drastically reduced immigration.
[00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:40.240]  She told the crowd that globalization is erasing France and that Islamic fundamentalism is planting itself in neighborhoods and in vulnerable minds.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.342]  We're going to give you an example of this as she's doing this campaign speech.
[00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:50.026]  There are another massive riots that are happening in Paris that recall riots of 12 years ago in 2005.
[00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:52.168]  So we're going to tell you about that in just a moment.
[00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:53.969]  She said when you arrive in a country
[00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:04.115]  You don't start violating laws, demanding rights, but of course you do if that is the intention of an invasion, and that's the way this is being set up by the globalists.
[00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:16.624]  They're using this as an invasion, not just with Islam, but a massive replacement of the people who are coming there, different cultures, and especially Islam is useful because we're going to see in France, the people who come in,
[00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:18.024]  We're good to go.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.626]  But when you have the second generation that grows up in these ghettos, they are easily radicalized.
[00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:57.257]  She said one of her 144 commitments is to limit immigration to just 10,000 and to restrain family reunification policies that allow many immigrants to bring in relatives.
[00:06:57.297 --> 00:07:00.641]  In other words, what we call here in America, the anchor baby situation.
[00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:07.883]  Her top lieutenant said earlier on Sunday that Brexit and the Trump election have given the French a reason to vote.
[00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:08.603]  You understand that?
[00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:11.104]  They've looked at Brexit just as we did.
[00:07:11.504 --> 00:07:12.924]  Brexit was the leading example.
[00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:20.887]  We looked at that and we said, you know there's a chance we can get Trump elected, that we can stop this seemingly irreversible push towards global governance.
[00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:22.647]  And we won.
[00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:34.010]  And now they're looking at these two elections and say, many people who have never voted before in France, just like we saw in Brexit, just like we saw especially here with Trump, many people are saying, I never believed that anything could be changed.
[00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.390]  Now they believe that they can change something.
[00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.591]  What do they need to change?
[00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:43.732]  As this was happening, there was violence in the Paris suburbs for a fourth consecutive night.
[00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:51.315]  The French police arrested a dozen people amid accusations that police officers had raped and beaten a man that they were detaining.
[00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:53.436]  So this set off riots in these areas.
[00:07:53.496 --> 00:08:07.743]  Dozens of vehicles and a nursery school were set on fire by youths during standoffs with police in an area of Paris where riots in 2005 drew global attention to the stark contrast between wealthy Paris and the suburbs that surround it, says Reuters.
[00:08:07.963 --> 00:08:09.284]  Understand, as I just said,
[00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:14.447]  There's a stark contrast that makes things worse in the second generation.
[00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:16.389]  So they'll say, well, these people are not immigrants.
[00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:17.990]  These are Frenchmen.
[00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:33.646]  Who have grown up here, they were born here, they grew up here, and they never realize how bad the country was that they came from, but they see that they have been ghettoized by their parents' resistance to being assimilated, as I said, because of religious and cultural reasons.
[00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:41.628]  They said youths had also used a trolley full of, they put it, petrol bombs, we would call that Molotov cocktails, so they filled a truck
[00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:44.830]  Full of Molotov cocktails to set these fires.
[00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:48.213]  And as one person said, sadly these neighborhoods have been turned into ghettos.
[00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:49.354]  That's by design, folks.
[00:08:49.994 --> 00:08:56.019]  They said in the 2005 riots, 10,000 cars and 300 buildings were set on fire.
[00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:58.701]  And this is in the same area where that happened.
[00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:09.369]  Meanwhile, a CBS poll, this was reported by New American, finds that 66% of Democrats think that Christianity is as violent as Islam.
[00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:10.470]  That's amazing.
[00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.334]  That's a radical difference between Republicans and Democrats.
[00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:19.860]  Two-thirds of Democrats believe that Islam breeds no more violence than any other faith.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.802]  This was a report from Breitbart.
[00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:30.592]  Initially it said only one in seven Democrats believe that Islam is more violent than other religions like Christianity, Mormonism, Judaism, or Buddhism.
[00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:35.714]  One in ten Democrats believe that Islam is less violent than other religions.
[00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:39.335]  And this is a poll that was just taken February the 1st through February the 2nd.
[00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:44.997]  In contrast, Republicans, they say, have a different view of Islam.
[00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:50.318]  Sixty-three percent of Republicans view Islam as aggressive compared to other religions.
[00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:54.099]  Let me explain something to you in just one word.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.180]  Martyr.
[00:09:56.325 --> 00:10:02.635]  Do you understand the difference in the way martyr is used in Christianity and the way martyr is used in Islam?
[00:10:03.356 --> 00:10:07.282]  In Christianity, a martyr was someone who was a witness.
[00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.664]  That's what the Greek word means.
[00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:09.566]  Witness.
[00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:15.899]  The Roman authorities wanted them to recant the religion, recant what they had seen, recant what they knew.
[00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:16.519]  They said no.
[00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.700]  And they faced death to do it.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.481]  So they would die rather than deny Christ.
[00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:24.162]  That was a Christian martyr.
[00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:32.705]  An Islamic martyr is someone who is willing to kill and become a suicidal murderer, a suicidal killer.
[00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:34.606]  To kill the unbelievers.
[00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:35.447]  You understand the difference?
[00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:39.930]  Somebody who says, I know this, I believe it, I will not recant it, even if you kill me.
[00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.114]  Versus somebody who says, I will kill you unless you follow my religion.
[00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:47.836]  And I will die doing it, if necessary.
[00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:51.920]  That's the difference between Islam and Christianity in one word.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.460]  Martyr.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.241]  It says it all.
[00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:56.383]  Now, if we go back to this, where does this idea come from?
[00:10:56.463 --> 00:10:58.345]  Of course, it's the meme of the Crusades.
[00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:12.464]  And as they point out in the New American article, the Crusades are generally portrayed as an effort by an imperialistic West to convert and to loot a peaceful Muslim world, but they were actually defensive wars against Islam.
[00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:13.766]  And as they point out, by 400 AD,
[00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:22.012]  Christianity was the dominant religion throughout this area that is now the Mideast and North Africa.
[00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:31.337]  But after the birth of Islam, a couple hundred years later, in 622, Muslim armies went out to conquer Christian lands.
[00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:35.680]  And as Thomas Madden, the history department at St.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:49.272]  Louis University put it, the Crusades were not the brainchild of an ambitious Pope or of rapacious knights, but a response to more than four centuries of conquest in which Muslims had already captured two-thirds of the old Christian world.
[00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:57.663]  At some point, Christianity as a faith and as a culture had to defend itself or be subsumed by Islam.
[00:11:58.163 --> 00:11:59.965]  The Crusades were that defense.
[00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:07.211]  And so today what we see is the clash of cultures, the clash of civilizations that have been engineered by the globalist
[00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:07.871]  In
[00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:41.076]  And to step up integration.
[00:12:41.116 --> 00:12:42.999]  Well, good luck with that, okay?
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:52.213]  Meanwhile, we see that German migration, this is reported by RT, German migration agency is vowing to fingerprint all refugees so they can combat benefit fraud.
[00:12:52.987 --> 00:12:55.930]  Well, why didn't they vet these people when they first came in?
[00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.195]  Do you think that I can go and move into Germany and get benefits or I can go into Switzerland?
[00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:00.875]  Of course we can't.
[00:13:01.576 --> 00:13:02.978]  But they're allowing these people to come in.
[00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:07.703]  It shows that these people are coming as economic refugees.
[00:13:07.723 --> 00:13:10.185]  They're not coming in as political refugees.
[00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:10.986]  It's a big difference.
[00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:30.332]  And you cannot accept unlimited numbers of economic refugees, and this was illustrated by the Cloward and Piven strategy that was put together by some liberal political scientists who said, if we bring in enough people, we can cause the system to collapse with this welfare state, and then we can rebuild what we want to do.
[00:13:30.372 --> 00:13:34.173]  They say asylum seekers are registered on the basis of their biometric data, including fingerprints.
[00:13:34.534 --> 00:13:38.635]  They're given forgery-proof identity documents with that arrival certificate.
[00:13:38.915 --> 00:13:39.155]  Really?
[00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:41.356]  Then where's your fraud coming from?
[00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:53.500]  Top government officials have warned that the ongoing influx of refugees is having a severe impact on Germany's welfare system and says that the country's asylum policy must be changed in order to alleviate the financial burden.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.381]  No, it's designed to collapse your country.
[00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:57.021]  And that's what it is about to do.
[00:13:57.482 --> 00:14:00.303]  Meanwhile, we see in Greece the EU is facing a crisis.
[00:14:00.743 --> 00:14:03.844]  The IMF is warning about explosive Greek debt.
[00:14:04.384 --> 00:14:06.146]  That is exactly what it was designed to do.
[00:14:06.507 --> 00:14:11.312]  They came up with an economic union, which was to not work, by design.
[00:14:11.873 --> 00:14:17.739]  And then, as we see this failing, the solution that is put out there is political integration.
[00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:28.694]  Reluctant EU members, they say, led by Poland, are calling for return to the Union's founding principles, asking for a fundamental overhaul of treaties that would return power back to the nation states.
[00:14:28.974 --> 00:14:29.654]  And think about this.
[00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:39.960]  Just last week, an EU concept paper came out that inflamed people who said, we're losing control of our lives to this central bureaucracy.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.323]  They said, this EU concept paper that came out last week,
[00:14:45.183 --> 00:14:51.167]  So deepen the divisions, because it did not contain a single mention of a member state.
[00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.749]  Only EU institutions.
[00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:55.050]  That is the point.
[00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.632]  And we see it happening even in Italy.
[00:14:58.212 --> 00:15:03.276]  They had the Italian central bank deputy, as Reuters points out, go on to a radio talk show.
[00:15:03.856 --> 00:15:09.840]  And as he was there, caller after caller said, why don't we just get out of the EU?
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.502]  Now they're not calling for the exit of the European Union.
[00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:15.033]  But they don't want to have the common currency.
[00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:16.680]  They understand that this hasn't worked for them.
[00:15:17.489 --> 00:15:26.175]  Now, we need to know, and we need to understand, and we talked about this as the French are looking at this and saying, look, with Brexit, with Trump, it is possible to stop globalism.
[00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:28.016]  We have to stop globalism.
[00:15:28.056 --> 00:15:31.398]  We have to stop the consolidation of power to the center.
[00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:35.701]  But at some point, we have to look at individual liberty.
[00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:38.343]  And we're going to have to work at this at the state level, I think.
[00:15:38.863 --> 00:15:42.466]  People are going to have to be concerned enough about their individual liberty to take it back.
[00:15:42.506 --> 00:15:47.209]  We're going to have to have presidents who don't use the Bill of Rights as toilet paper.
[00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.891]  Is that being too harsh?
[00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:55.139]  I want to play for you a clip yesterday where Donald Trump talked to some sheriffs about law enforcement.
[00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.495]  But we have to stop crying, right?
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.556]  Would anybody like to make a statement?
[00:15:59.676 --> 00:16:10.678]  Mr. President, on behalf of that forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas that was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive that forfeiture money.
[00:16:10.898 --> 00:16:16.519]  And I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed.
[00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:17.299]  Who's the state senator?
[00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:18.460]  Do you want to give his name?
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.200]  It will destroy his career.
[00:16:23.174 --> 00:16:23.914]  Now did you hear that?
[00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:25.836]  Trump said, can you believe that?
[00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:31.899]  What is so amazing about the idea that we would require conviction before we enact a penalty?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.501]  That is something that we learned after centuries of tyranny.
[00:16:35.701 --> 00:16:37.603]  That's why it is enshrined in the Magna Carta.
[00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:40.604]  That's why it's enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.
[00:16:41.005 --> 00:16:46.528]  If we're going to stop crime, we have to stop crime being committed by our police departments.
[00:16:46.928 --> 00:16:49.189]  Understand what civil asset forfeiture is.
[00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.150]  Let's translate this.
[00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.651]  When they say that it's civil,
[00:16:52.151 --> 00:16:54.613]  What they're saying is you have no due process.
[00:16:54.893 --> 00:17:02.218]  Remember the Sixth Amendment says in all criminal prosecutions, and it lays out a bunch of protections, they're saying this is not a criminal prosecution.
[00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:07.341]  It is a civil prosecution when we steal your property and don't charge you with the crime.
[00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:11.104]  So that means that you don't get innocent until proven guilty.
[00:17:11.424 --> 00:17:12.965]  You are not confronted with the charges.
[00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:16.968]  You don't get a chance to answer your accusers and defend yourself in court with witnesses.
[00:17:17.428 --> 00:17:21.571]  You don't even get a chance to be convicted before they apply a penalty.
[00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:25.473]  See, and of course there's no prohibition on excessive fines.
[00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:31.036]  So you have a situation where they find somebody smoking a joint on the parents porch, they confiscate the entire house.
[00:17:31.377 --> 00:17:33.898]  How is that equivalent to that?
[00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:39.221]  And of course they try to make this sound as if this is a foreign situation.
[00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:44.445]  Look, if you want to stop the cartels, you stop the war on drugs.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.001]  Look at what happened with marijuana legalization.
[00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:52.542]  Once they did that, it made it unprofitable for them to sell marijuana.
[00:17:52.582 --> 00:17:54.643]  The cartels, they had turned into other things.
[00:17:54.663 --> 00:18:02.106]  Now they're turning into human trafficking because you created these organized crime syndicates with your war on drugs.
[00:18:02.126 --> 00:18:03.126]  They're turning to something else.
[00:18:03.146 --> 00:18:04.707]  They'll continue to commit crimes.
[00:18:05.507 --> 00:18:07.548]  But you can stop the war on drugs.
[00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:09.068]  You can treat it in a different way.
[00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.229]  It is not a law enforcement issue.
[00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:12.390]  Let's look at this.
[00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.531]  Civil asset forfeiture.
[00:18:13.571 --> 00:18:15.593]  What they're saying is you have no due process.
[00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:18.736]  The assets, that's your property, they're going to forfeit it.
[00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:20.598]  Well, that's nothing but theft by government.
[00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:25.223]  So understand, government is going to steal your property with no due process.
[00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:26.664]  That's really what this is about.
[00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:31.409]  Conservatives need to understand where the war on drugs came from.
[00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.533]  It is a UN agenda, just like Agenda 21.
[00:18:35.834 --> 00:18:43.401]  They created it, they created the schedules, they put all the drugs in the schedules, and then Richard Nixon enacted it ten years after the UN created it.
[00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:44.382]  That's what it is.
[00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:50.969]  It is destroying our country's legal system, it is corrupting our institutions, and it is taking away our individual liberties.
[00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.391]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:05.796]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:07.796]  All four branches of the military.
[00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:09.337]  Combat One.
[00:19:10.397 --> 00:19:20.521]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else but the military?
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:22.994]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.195]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:30.496]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.857]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:47.719]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:01.988]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:08.954]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:18.803]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.265]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.387]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:31.195]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.396]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.557]  That's the key buffer.
[00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:39.500]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.460]  They lower your fertility.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.021]  It's all admitted.
[00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.883]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:46.264]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.064]  It's super secret.
[00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.326]  Twelve years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:55.352]  This is something every M4 Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:01.078]  Whether it's cleaning your guns, or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:06.224]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warriorstore.com.
[00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:10.545]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:13.427]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[00:21:14.188 --> 00:21:18.591]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.673]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:23.335]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:24.536]  How well it works.
[00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.698]  This wound has been open for about five days now.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.000]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.362]  So just to better, safe than sorry.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.189]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, field dress, and nice and clean again.
[00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.775]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.257]  Born in America.
[00:21:50.718 --> 00:21:51.619]  Made in America.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.466]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.401]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.534]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.834 --> 00:23:00.764]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:08.570]  For over 20 years, the UN has been attempting to advance the globalist plan called Agenda 21.
[00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:18.273]  Under the guise of the title Sustainable Development, this state of regulations has been the driving force behind many of the land and business regulations passed in your local community.
[00:23:18.574 --> 00:23:28.437]  Sustainable development almost always results in a community turning over its resources to a small bureaucracy who, through tax and regulation, transfer more and more power to themselves.
[00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:35.302]  While many media outlets decry Agenda 21 as a dead letter, we see evidence of the implementation of this plan all the time.
[00:23:35.642 --> 00:23:41.346]  In Austin, Texas, for example, a series of land development rules called Code Next has been pushed for years.
[00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:49.713]  NGOs with an interest in Agenda 21 have been producing videos which could prepare or tone the public for unnatural living scenarios.
[00:23:50.113 --> 00:23:58.019]  One video in particular, Plannedopolis, shows a future world where everything is tracked, traced, and you are only allowed meat on certain days.
[00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:01.040]  What's on the menu this month?
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.360]  No, not meat.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.700]  It's not your birthday.
[00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:09.462]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[00:24:10.062 --> 00:24:13.803]  I mean, you don't get the choice you used to, but we're better off than most.
[00:24:14.103 --> 00:24:19.645]  And if you don't agree with this controlled aspect of living, then you live in the ghettos and are shunned by society.
[00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:21.205]  Now let's look at Code Next.
[00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:23.206]  It's called Code Next.
[00:24:24.284 --> 00:24:27.288]  That's the trendy name for Agenda 21 in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:41.004]  Under their next code systems, they are openly establishing a planetary system of total control.
[00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:46.786]  Where the individual has absolutely no rights and where your very environment is a prison.
[00:24:47.127 --> 00:24:55.257]  Look into code next if you want to understand the global model of agenda 21 simply using zoning to fully enslave you and your family.
[00:24:55.854 --> 00:25:05.163]  This plan begins by rezoning already existing neighborhoods to meet a new standard that will be compatible with new future plans already outlined in Agenda 21.
[00:25:05.563 --> 00:25:14.171]  Code Next wants to change existing single-family housing developments and implement a new sustainable model that contains massive apartment buildings
[00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:17.212]  Some of which contain 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:27.616]  And by raising people's property taxes to unlivable standards, people are forced to sell their homes to giant developers which could knock down, say, four houses in an area and put up giant high-rises.
[00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:33.938]  Thereby increasing the property tax base even more and crowding more and more people into smaller and smaller areas.
[00:25:34.178 --> 00:25:36.099]  This also increases traffic congestion.
[00:25:36.419 --> 00:25:42.141]  So Code Next also makes driving lanes smaller and even adds concrete embankments for bike lanes.
[00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:45.303]  Anything to impede the natural flow of traffic.
[00:25:45.663 --> 00:25:48.626]  But what's the true incentive for programs like Code Next?
[00:25:49.987 --> 00:25:55.451]  Beyond their claims of being the progressive left, the progressive left has been caught many times engaging in voter fraud.
[00:25:55.631 --> 00:25:59.194]  President Obama even encouraged illegal immigrants to vote on election day.
[00:25:59.314 --> 00:26:02.816]  So if I vote, will immigration know where I live?
[00:26:02.997 --> 00:26:05.038]  Will they come for my family and deport us?
[00:26:05.278 --> 00:26:05.779]  Not true.
[00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:09.662]  And the reason is, first of all, when you vote,
[00:26:10.598 --> 00:26:19.860]  You are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, etc.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.841]  The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.
[00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:35.084]  And with an abundance of cheap rooms and small coffin-like apartments being built in once middle-class residential communities, you can turn conservative districts into leftist progressive districts.
[00:26:35.404 --> 00:27:01.217]  They have an admitted plan under Code Next to take over Austin, then take over the surrounding towns like a cancer, take over the I-35 and I-45 corridors, and fully bring in the third world population to drive down wages, to house them in overpriced coffin apartments, and to bring down the standard of living massively, then use those political groups as a checkmate on the rest of the population and kill the middle class once and for all.
[00:27:01.837 --> 00:27:09.422]  It affects every property owner, every renter, everyone that lives in Austin, whether you live inside the city or just outside of our city limits.
[00:27:10.323 --> 00:27:12.364]  Okay, he's talking about code next.
[00:27:12.504 --> 00:27:17.608]  The code will reflect what the character of your neighborhood should look like, as well as mobility options.
[00:27:18.068 --> 00:27:23.632]  We talked to Habitat for Humanity, and right now they are waiting to develop this old lumber yard on East 4th Street.
[00:27:24.152 --> 00:27:26.694]  It's just a block or so away from the Metrorail station.
[00:27:27.274 --> 00:27:33.358]  They believe the rewriting of the code will allow them to build more affordable units instead of just single-family homes.
[00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:36.899]  The bureaucrats win by creating a vertical property tax base.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:44.444]  Instead of one house paying one set of property taxes, you now have 400 little apartments all paying tax on the same piece of property.
[00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:52.308]  Breaking apart residential communities and adding small rent-controlled efficiency apartments, popularly known as the projects, can have serious effects on a community as well.
[00:27:52.568 --> 00:27:59.115]  Will a neighborhood of primarily single-family dwellings be subject to increased crime rates that we see in sanctuary cities across the nation?
[00:27:59.275 --> 00:28:01.277]  This is obviously a disaster waiting to happen.
[00:28:01.397 --> 00:28:07.944]  Through Agenda 21 and its manifestations like Code Next, we can see the dark cloud of sustainable development consuming us all.
[00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:11.608]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:28:19.983 --> 00:28:22.644]  You gotta understand, MSM's in the biggest cult of it all.
[00:28:23.645 --> 00:28:35.191]  They are totally indoctrinated and hired because of narcissistic tendencies and cult tendencies believing they're invincible and unstoppable even as the Allied forces close in in a pincer attack.
[00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:37.852]  I'm using the German analogy because we have Der Spiegel here.
[00:28:38.272 --> 00:28:44.816]  The same folks that brought us the iconic image, I gotta say it's a powerful image, of Trump chopping the head off of the Statue of Liberty.
[00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:49.339]  When actually they used to bring folks in and test them for TB and the bubonic plague.
[00:28:49.639 --> 00:28:50.960]  Now they don't test them for that.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.741]  I've had Border Patrol Union heads on.
[00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:56.984]  They bring people in with TB, but get this, leprosy!
[00:28:57.384 --> 00:28:59.385]  And then it ends up in Los Angeles schools.
[00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:03.949]  Oh yes, leprosy spreading all over the United States, but they keep it real quiet.
[00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:13.035]  Or Syria, the civil war they helped launch five years ago, aiding the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other countries to invade and take it over.
[00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:17.258]  Their whole project of the Arab Spring overthrowing our allies in Egypt?
[00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:28.708]  Having Peter Sutherland of the UN Migration Board open the borders of Europe up and invite in the Muslim radical hordes to destabilize the once free Western republics?
[00:29:29.449 --> 00:29:33.292]  The Congress, led by Democrats, who said, you know what?
[00:29:33.452 --> 00:29:34.533]  Sounds like a pretty good idea.
[00:29:35.013 --> 00:29:41.098]  Let's deal with the ISI and the Pakistani military, and let's go recruit these Mujahideen, and that's great.
[00:29:41.138 --> 00:29:48.924]  Let's get some to come from Saudi Arabia and other places, importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam, so that we can go beat the Soviet Union.
[00:29:49.484 --> 00:29:55.149]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that would be the real image, would be jihadis cutting the Statue of Liberty's head off.
[00:29:55.964 --> 00:30:03.874]  But again, most people don't even know the Statue of Liberty's real history or that if memory serves me, wasn't it refused by a Muslim country?
[00:30:04.114 --> 00:30:13.826]  Let's get to that incredible speech given just two and a half hours ago by the 45th President of the United States where he attacks fake polls and where he
[00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:31.160]  Exposes the enemy, the foreign owned corporate sloth media, the dinosaur giant sloth media that is now digging its own grave in front of everyone and has already basically climbed in and is now dumping piles of dirt on top of itself with pleasure, with delusional...
[00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:32.381]  Pleasure.
[00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:39.744]  So all that psychosis is going on, Trump continues to basically turn the knife and reads the law.
[00:30:39.764 --> 00:30:43.325]  I'm going to read what's in dispute, what's in question.
[00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:45.326]  And you'll see this.
[00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:51.508]  It's IN8-212F-8-USC-1182F.
[00:30:53.929 --> 00:30:59.391]  Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President.
[00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:00.392]  Okay?
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.061]  It was done for the security of our nation.
[00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:18.987]  Anytime, whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, right?
[00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:29.191]  So, if I find as President that a person or a group of people will be detrimental to the interests
[00:31:30.444 --> 00:31:39.350]  Of the United States, and certainly there's lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn't even have them, necessarily.
[00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:51.157]  He may be, and he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary.
[00:31:51.197 --> 00:31:57.741]  Now the only mistake is they should have said he or she, but hopefully it won't be a she for at least another seven years.
[00:31:57.841 --> 00:31:58.602]  After that, I'm over.
[00:32:00.307 --> 00:32:05.511]  He may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary.
[00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:06.171]  So here it is.
[00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:08.173]  People coming in.
[00:32:10.114 --> 00:32:15.158]  Suspend the entry of all aliens.
[00:32:15.578 --> 00:32:15.778]  Right?
[00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:16.659]  That's what it says.
[00:32:16.939 --> 00:32:21.403]  It's not like, again, a bad high school student would understand this.
[00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.510]  That's right.
[00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.672]  And they go, oh my gosh, a president's never attacked the court like this.
[00:32:25.752 --> 00:32:26.672]  It's fascism.
[00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:31.455]  But it's like, hey, you're legislating from the bench.
[00:32:31.535 --> 00:32:32.596]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:32:32.656 --> 00:32:36.318]  This law, a five-year-old can understand that.
[00:32:36.338 --> 00:32:37.999]  Forget a bad high school student.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.422]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:40.662 --> 00:32:42.123]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:42.624 --> 00:32:42.844]  Okay?
[00:32:43.144 --> 00:32:46.007]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:46.207 --> 00:32:47.889]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:47.929 --> 00:32:49.210]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.271]  This is Texas.
[00:32:50.491 --> 00:32:51.312]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:52.473]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:52.533 --> 00:32:53.154]  You understand that?
[00:32:53.314 --> 00:32:58.179]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:16.832]  Human trafficking has been growing at a fast pace in America, with traffickers being able to utilize the internet to buy and sell women and children.
[00:37:16.852 --> 00:37:30.016]  I am going to be joined here via Skype with Nate Fowler, the founder of the Sigil Social Foundation, which specializes in the counseling and treatment of victims of human sex trafficking.
[00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:32.077]  Let's go ahead and talk with Nate.
[00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:38.679]  Hello, we are joined here in studio with Nate Fowler, founder of Sigil Social Foundation.
[00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:40.820]  Can you tell us a little bit about your foundation, Nate?
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:49.563]  Yeah, our foundation is built so that we can give counseling, specialized counseling, to human trafficking and domestic abuse survivors.
[00:37:49.923 --> 00:37:54.805]  Can you tell us a little bit about how these human traffickers traffic these women and children?
[00:37:55.165 --> 00:38:01.247]  What kind of like mind control or brainwashing techniques do they use to keep these people in their grasp?
[00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:12.969]  Well, first off, just to define what we're talking about, when we're talking about human trafficking, we're talking about girls who are pushed to sell their bodies for little or no pay.
[00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:22.777]  And when they're capturing these girls, they're capturing them in relationships where they're anywhere between 12 to 14 years old.
[00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:29.461]  They really have no experience with the real world, and it's easy for them to be coerced into doing sex acts.
[00:38:31.286 --> 00:38:40.292]  Exactly, and it is a form of modern-day slavery because, like you said, they don't usually get to keep the money that's being made from them selling their bodies.
[00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:48.979]  How in modern-day pop culture and in the entertainment industry are they promoting ideas of human trafficking to young children?
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:59.106]  They've made it so that, I mean, there's music and movies and all sorts of different materials out there that are pushing the idea that pimping is cool.
[00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:06.557]  And there's plenty of materials available that show you step-by-step how to pimp.
[00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:12.523]  And that's what makes it difficult for people who are looking for the easy way out.
[00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:15.205]  They just start using these materials.
[00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:18.568]  They start listening to the music and believing the story.
[00:39:19.669 --> 00:39:20.230]  Easy money.
[00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:21.391]  That's what they're looking for.
[00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:22.152]  And power.
[00:39:22.859 --> 00:39:29.163]  Wow, and you were telling me a little bit about a human trafficking bust in Moreno Valley.
[00:39:29.484 --> 00:39:34.247]  Can you tell us a little bit about this and how this coincided with a school teacher or school administrator?
[00:39:34.267 --> 00:39:47.696]  This is actually a guy on the school board and he was allegedly, let's put allegedly, he was arrested for pimping young girls and potentially recruiting young girls from the school itself.
[00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.942]  That's how prevalent it is.
[00:39:50.562 --> 00:39:59.028]  Even people who are in positions of authority are using this knowledge to abuse children and make money off of them.
[00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:08.035]  Wow, that's pretty disheartening to hear that school teachers or administrators are engaging in some of this type of behavior as well.
[00:40:08.495 --> 00:40:13.479]  How does this human trafficking industry utilize the internet?
[00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:15.200]  Can you tell us about Darknet?
[00:40:16.545 --> 00:40:25.554]  The Darknet is like a layer of the internet that you can't normally see unless you have a specialized browser or program, which you can download for free.
[00:40:26.395 --> 00:40:35.765]  And there are websites on the Darknet that let you do whatever you want, sell whatever you want, whether it's drugs or guns or
[00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:39.864]  Children, that's the big thing.
[00:40:39.884 --> 00:40:46.610]  It's like child pornography and people for sale on the darknet is something that is becoming more and more common.
[00:40:47.551 --> 00:40:53.896]  Wow, so they can completely just buy child pornography on this other browser if they just download this app.
[00:40:54.377 --> 00:40:57.940]  And we just saw in Haiti a human trafficking bust.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.384]  Do you think that they were possibly using this darknet to sell these young children?
[00:41:04.457 --> 00:41:05.377]  It's very possible.
[00:41:05.577 --> 00:41:08.519]  We know from reports that they were selling them for about $300.
[00:41:08.819 --> 00:41:12.840]  And they were young girls, all under the age of 18.
[00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.662]  And there were, I think, 20 of them now.
[00:41:16.602 --> 00:41:20.944]  And they were selling them in some shape or way.
[00:41:21.044 --> 00:41:22.945]  So we're not sure exactly if it was Darknet.
[00:41:23.005 --> 00:41:24.305]  But it is very, very possible.
[00:41:25.326 --> 00:41:28.127]  So is human trafficking getting worse in America?
[00:41:28.147 --> 00:41:33.409]  And how fast is the rate of these human trafficking episodes occurring?
[00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:44.679]  We know that in 2016 there have been 36% more human trafficking calls and incidents in the United States alone.
[00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:48.482]  So the rate is going up very, very quickly.
[00:41:49.423 --> 00:41:53.807]  And it's up to agencies in the United States to find solutions to stop it.
[00:41:54.935 --> 00:42:02.738]  Wow, and we did see with the Super Bowl how, you know, those large events traffic a lot of girls to them so that they can sell them.
[00:42:02.778 --> 00:42:04.419]  They attract human traffickers.
[00:42:04.459 --> 00:42:13.163]  They know that when people are in a party mindset that they will just go out and expect to be able to buy girls, and they always tend to be lying about the girls' age.
[00:42:13.203 --> 00:42:16.864]  They could be underage and advertising them as overage.
[00:42:17.164 --> 00:42:19.165]  So it's just pretty crazy to see.
[00:42:19.325 --> 00:42:23.247]  What do you know about some of these large events and how they traffic these girls there?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:40.292]  Being at the large events, they'll actually have groups of girls that go across the United States, whether it's to the Super Bowl, or to CES, or to any other major event in the United States.
[00:42:40.492 --> 00:42:49.239]  They'll take over homes, and they'll take over agencies, and they just move the girls from city to city around the United States.
[00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:58.214]  Wow, and how does the Sigil Social Foundation work with these survivors of abuse and human trafficking?
[00:42:58.494 --> 00:43:03.777]  What kind of things or programs do you guys do to, you know, rehabilitate these children and women?
[00:43:04.857 --> 00:43:17.343]  We have a counseling program that we've been working on for about nine years and one of the reasons we started it was because the rate of people who got out and then went back into human trafficking
[00:43:17.924 --> 00:43:28.450]  was 85%, which meant basically almost every single person who was rescued or got out of human trafficking went back in.
[00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:40.756]  And that was something that we set our goal to stop, which is we have a counseling program that people go through, and we have a 99% success rate in getting them out and keeping them out.
[00:43:41.812 --> 00:43:46.036]  Wow, so why do you think these victims of human trafficking go back?
[00:43:46.116 --> 00:43:48.978]  Like, why would they go back to their abusers once they've been freed?
[00:43:49.979 --> 00:43:59.087]  Part of it's because they're anywhere between 12 to 14 when they get started, when they get pulled into that industry and that
[00:44:00.276 --> 00:44:05.519]  They're abused, basically, into thinking that it's normal to have sex for money.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:18.208]  It's normal to be someone who sells their body and that's all they get out of it, is to have a guy or a girl who just gives them a roof over their head for selling their body.
[00:44:19.108 --> 00:44:21.230]  And that's what they think is okay.
[00:44:22.225 --> 00:44:29.548]  Wow, so they just become conditioned and brainwashed, and this is just more what we're seeing in our culture today.
[00:44:29.588 --> 00:44:36.672]  There's tons of things, subliminal programming, mind control, in children's television shows, music videos.
[00:44:37.052 --> 00:44:42.754]  It's all just popularizing being trafficked, so these young kids think it's okay to sell their bodies.
[00:44:43.094 --> 00:44:44.935]  That's pretty amazing, Nate.
[00:44:45.415 --> 00:44:50.598]  Well, what can people do to help the cause, and where could they donate to?
[00:44:52.542 --> 00:44:58.648]  If you'd like to help the Sigil Social Foundation fight human trafficking, you can donate at sigilsocial.org right now.
[00:44:59.609 --> 00:45:06.374]  You can also visit our address, which is sigilsocial.org.
[00:45:07.335 --> 00:45:13.220]  If you're being affected by human trafficking, you can call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, which is 888-373-7888.
[00:45:17.446 --> 00:45:23.248]  And how many people have you guys helped rescue so far, and how has that process been?
[00:45:23.308 --> 00:45:27.650]  Has it been a pretty grueling process trying to recover some of these people?
[00:45:29.151 --> 00:45:44.057]  In some cases it is extremely grueling, partially because we're having to deal with politics, we're having to deal with local agencies, and we have to kind of jump through a lot of hurdles to make it so that they are all happy when really we're just trying to save lives.
[00:45:44.738 --> 00:45:53.062]  Well, we've seen a lot of human trafficking busts in the last couple of months, especially since Donald Trump has been in.
[00:45:53.322 --> 00:45:56.864]  Have you seen a lot of human trafficking busts in your area?
[00:45:58.645 --> 00:46:08.250]  We know that we've seen, like in California, they had 474 people arrested related to human trafficking just two days ago.
[00:46:09.577 --> 00:46:12.459]  And that's an incredible amount.
[00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:15.620]  I think it's probably the highest amount I've ever seen in Southern California.
[00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:19.162]  Alright, thank you so much for joining us, Nate Fowler.
[00:46:19.983 --> 00:46:24.165]  I hope that everyone can donate to the Sigil Social Foundation to help this cause.
[00:46:24.225 --> 00:46:25.166]  And thanks again, Nate.
[00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:26.506]  Thank you, Millie.
[00:46:27.247 --> 00:46:33.130]  If you are being affected by human trafficking, please contact the National Resource for Human Trafficking.
[00:46:44.249 --> 00:46:50.932]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:46:51.192 --> 00:46:53.333]  You better believe you got one!
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.720]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.055]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.075 --> 00:48:59.956]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.016]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.725 --> 00:49:11.967]  Well, let's talk about the rampant hypocrisy when it comes to this climate change agenda.
[00:49:12.007 --> 00:49:14.108]  Right now, we've got some old guard Republicans.
[00:49:14.548 --> 00:49:17.190]  They're pushing for carbon tax at a White House meeting today.
[00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:25.614]  And when you see a lot of these bankers and Treasury secretaries pushing for this carbon tax, you know it has nothing to do with saving the environment.
[00:49:25.914 --> 00:49:27.155]  It has everything to do with
[00:49:28.115 --> 00:49:34.139]  Pushing the tax upon you and I, the little guy, while saving these corporations from the massive amount of money.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:41.265]  And they're pushing this as, you know, there's something we need to do because climate change is real and it's a massive threat and we've got to do something about it immediately.
[00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:44.707]  Oh, you know, aside from actually fix the environment.
[00:49:45.187 --> 00:49:47.209]  Owen Schroer is joining me now and
[00:49:47.910 --> 00:50:02.351]  One of the things I wanted to point out with this was how they are going to really try and make this attractive to the poor, to the little guy, because this blueprint involves a $40 tax on every metric ton of carbon dioxide that's going to be released by burning fossil fuels.
[00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:06.214]  So the price of your energy bills are going to be climbing over time.
[00:50:06.254 --> 00:50:17.502]  So what they're going to do to avoid an undue burden on the poor from these higher energy bills is they're going to use some of the money in the annual revenue from this carbon tax.
[00:50:17.602 --> 00:50:23.387]  They're going to redistribute it to households in the form of quarterly checks from Social Security.
[00:50:23.447 --> 00:50:26.009]  So this is going to make poor people go, oh, that's great.
[00:50:26.049 --> 00:50:27.810]  Yeah, levy that carbon tax on us.
[00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:28.931]  I'll take an extra $2,000 a year.
[00:50:30.592 --> 00:50:34.133]  Just to give a little payback because my energy bills are going to be so high.
[00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:40.796]  Meanwhile, you and I are going to be saddled with these massive energy bills and we know U.S.
[00:50:41.276 --> 00:50:43.777]  companies are going to be able to get liability protections.
[00:50:44.197 --> 00:50:52.561]  So this is all about pushing away the regulations that are actually going to help the environment while levying a massive tax on the people.
[00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.549]  For breathing!
[00:50:54.189 --> 00:51:00.672]  But that's the key here because the people that are pushing this are the ones who fly around in their big jets, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:51:00.972 --> 00:51:02.832]  Adding the most to it, if you believe in that.
[00:51:03.553 --> 00:51:05.473]  But what they're doing here is they're creating a war.
[00:51:05.633 --> 00:51:08.114]  It's really an economic war by the elite.
[00:51:08.534 --> 00:51:14.256]  They're misinforming the poor people and then using the poor people to hate the middle class.
[00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:19.438]  So then now you've got the elite fighting to kill the middle class and the poor fighting to kill the middle class.
[00:51:19.938 --> 00:51:25.285]  And what they do is, you know, and here's the amazing thing to me because they use the climate change thing to push for these carbon taxes.
[00:51:26.307 --> 00:51:30.612]  New data comes out that refutes global warming charges.
[00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:31.654]  Okay, but you know what?
[00:51:31.674 --> 00:51:33.797]  Then people put out data that say the earth is getting hotter.
[00:51:33.837 --> 00:51:34.277]  You know what?
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.121]  I don't know what data to trust, okay?
[00:51:37.442 --> 00:51:44.627]  I'm not going to accept policy when we've got data coming from all of these ends, and then you're going to try to implement a policy that's going to affect the future of this world.
[00:51:44.867 --> 00:51:46.688]  No, at the very least, we need to say, you know what?
[00:51:46.928 --> 00:51:47.929]  We simply don't know.
[00:51:48.029 --> 00:51:55.394]  If they really, truly care about fixing the environment, because I do care about the environment, I care about the Earth, this is where we live, we need to take care of this space.
[00:51:55.814 --> 00:51:59.337]  If they really cared about it, they would just release free energy, they wouldn't
[00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:00.578]  We're good to go.
[00:52:22.333 --> 00:52:24.154]  That's when I knew it was a bunch of crap.
[00:52:24.634 --> 00:52:32.737]  And then, you know, you have Leonardo DiCaprio riding around on his private jet, which is amidst the carbon footprint of a small country.
[00:52:33.038 --> 00:52:36.499]  He took his private jet to go pick up an environmental award.
[00:52:36.819 --> 00:52:40.901]  So total hypocrite saying, this is just, it's dire, it's extreme.
[00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:43.082]  You know, we've got to do something about it immediately.
[00:52:43.242 --> 00:52:44.662]  And then back on his private jet.
[00:52:45.063 --> 00:52:50.585]  Also too, you know, we have a lot of these protesters who were out protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.
[00:52:51.125 --> 00:52:55.609]  They were in this huge uproar because this pipeline could burst and it would contaminate the water there.
[00:52:55.689 --> 00:52:58.312]  It was on sacred grounds, allegedly.
[00:52:58.772 --> 00:53:01.254]  Well, so how do they treat that sacred ground?
[00:53:01.274 --> 00:53:09.501]  Well, they leave heaps of garbage behind after they're done with their little Coachella Burning Man up there at the Dakota Access Pipeline.
[00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:15.507]  Massive amounts of trash that is frozen in the snow, so they're having to really
[00:53:16.067 --> 00:53:19.188]  This is just the abject hypocrisy where people like you and I can't take it seriously.
[00:53:19.288 --> 00:53:21.389]  And we're like, I don't want to be taxed on it.
[00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:47.100]  You clearly don't care that much.
[00:53:47.381 --> 00:53:48.524]  It's clearly not that dire.
[00:53:49.948 --> 00:53:51.794]  Insert Pepe face now.
[00:53:52.637 --> 00:54:12.363]  This is the same type of littering we saw after the Women's March, and I remember filing a report on it on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, being like, this is strange, I didn't see this much trash after Trump's inauguration and all the balls and all the galas, but every time Antifa does a protest, every time the George Soros protesters march, now the Dakota Pipeline protesters, they leave heaps of trash.
[00:54:12.584 --> 00:54:14.204]  Those images were actually incredible.
[00:54:14.244 --> 00:54:16.605]  That's more than just a trash can overflowing.
[00:54:16.625 --> 00:54:19.826]  We're talking about fields, just heaps of trash.
[00:54:20.126 --> 00:54:27.329]  Right, well, and to just call out all these people, to have thousands of people coming there, staying there for months, and- Look at that, that's ridiculous!
[00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:30.971]  Really trying to point your finger at the rest of the country and- I mean, my God!
[00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:32.091]  How dare we?
[00:54:32.111 --> 00:54:37.493]  You know, this is sacred ground, you're going to contaminate the water, and then they leave all this toxic crap behind.
[00:54:37.513 --> 00:54:39.034]  They're toxic crap.
[00:54:39.574 --> 00:54:46.017]  The people did say that they're going to use a lot of those donations to pay for that cleanup, but still, it's like, clean up your freaking trash, people, man.
[00:54:46.578 --> 00:54:48.619]  Nothing makes you more angry than litterers.
[00:54:48.699 --> 00:54:55.402]  It's just the irony that they're protesting to protect the environment while they're, you know, poisoning the environment by their own standards.
[00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:56.623]  So that's the irony we point out.
[00:54:56.683 --> 00:55:00.505]  Now, I want to get into this because this is kind of sweeping the nation right now, Leigh-Anne.
[00:55:00.925 --> 00:55:06.169]  I got an email today, this was forwarded to me from the president of Emerson College.
[00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:25.084]  I quote, they're talking about becoming a sanctuary city and how they're going to refuse to release information regarding the immigration status of their students and workers and refuse to comply with immigration authorities regarding deportation or raids, including physical access to all land owned or controlled by the college.
[00:55:25.424 --> 00:55:29.948]  So now, it used to be the rich were above the law, now liberals are above the law.
[00:55:30.288 --> 00:55:33.270]  But now they're just basically admitting that they're housing illegal people.
[00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:40.713]  Right, and it's not even the sanctuary campuses, it's not even about just housing the students, but it's also saying bring your family here, your family will also be safe.
[00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:43.655]  So this is like people who are not even students on campus.
[00:55:44.015 --> 00:55:49.778]  Because I can understand, you know, I went to the University of Texas, there were a ton of undocumented students at UT.
[00:55:49.918 --> 00:55:51.779]  It was kind of a sanctuary campus at that time.
[00:55:52.359 --> 00:55:58.521]  That, you know, that's kind of a blurry gray area, but here they're actually saying, bring your family, bring your friends.
[00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:15.605]  If they're a fear of being deported, this is going to be a safe campus, which is crazy because it's so, there's such a political agenda behind all of this that the media is actually going so far that they're not even identifying the crime that's being committed by people who are here illegally because they just want to push through these sanctuary policies.
[00:56:15.725 --> 00:56:17.186]  Well, and here's the thing that I don't understand.
[00:56:17.226 --> 00:56:19.688]  This comes from the Emerson student publication.
[00:56:19.728 --> 00:56:24.771]  They say that they're going to publicly declare themselves a sanctuary campus to assist undocumented students.
[00:56:24.791 --> 00:56:28.794]  So you're admitting, you're aiding and abetting people that are breaking the law.
[00:56:28.834 --> 00:56:29.414]  That's illegal.
[00:56:29.794 --> 00:56:30.895]  And then I don't understand this.
[00:56:31.395 --> 00:56:33.177]  How do you have an undocumented student?
[00:56:33.737 --> 00:56:34.838]  Don't you have student numbers?
[00:56:34.898 --> 00:56:35.618]  Don't you have to file?
[00:56:35.638 --> 00:56:36.519]  There's a process.
[00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:37.620]  I had to go through a process.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.121]  I had to get a vaccine.
[00:56:39.921 --> 00:56:42.502]  So how, I don't understand how you have an undocumented student.
[00:56:42.762 --> 00:56:44.982]  But this is being pushed for in Ivy Leagues.
[00:56:45.282 --> 00:56:48.883]  Thousands of students, professors at all of these Ivy Leagues are pushing for it too.
[00:56:49.703 --> 00:56:54.265]  But it's funny because when Obama talked about similar policies, they never protested that.
[00:56:54.305 --> 00:56:56.245]  They never pushed for sanctuary cities then.
[00:56:56.265 --> 00:56:58.106]  And you know, here's another one.
[00:56:58.386 --> 00:57:07.068]  Some University of Cincinnati students and faculty want the administration to make UC a sanctuary campus, joining the city and defying President Trump's targeted travel ban.
[00:57:07.788 --> 00:57:11.430]  Well, what happened when you defied Barack Obama's Obamacare?
[00:57:11.811 --> 00:57:12.311]  You remember that?
[00:57:12.811 --> 00:57:13.672]  You got fined!
[00:57:14.352 --> 00:57:16.374]  So what, are there going to be fines for these campuses?
[00:57:16.574 --> 00:57:18.435]  You need to cut the federal funding!
[00:57:18.455 --> 00:57:19.135]  That's what he's saying.
[00:57:19.176 --> 00:57:23.078]  He wants to cut the federal funds for these schools as well as for the cities around here.
[00:57:23.098 --> 00:57:30.023]  I know here in Austin, specifically, they're fighting against the federal laws there to become a sanctuary city.
[00:57:30.743 --> 00:57:36.248]  So much so that they don't identify people who are here illegally who have committed crimes.
[00:57:36.288 --> 00:57:44.756]  They don't even add that into their reporting because they don't want to sway the public's opinion on making Austin a sanctuary city.
[00:57:44.796 --> 00:57:45.697]  It's so dangerous.
[00:57:46.057 --> 00:57:51.722]  This is how far gone they are that they will do whatever is possible, including
[00:57:52.463 --> 00:57:53.823]  Endangering you and your family.
[00:57:54.163 --> 00:58:18.929]  There's a story on Drudge Report that hundreds of immigrants convicted and not deported go on to commit even more crimes, even murder, which is exactly the case of this man who was arrested for sexually assaulting a Texas mother in front of her child at knife point and they didn't identify him as someone who was here illegally as well as someone who had already been deported previously following a homicide conviction.
[00:58:19.289 --> 00:58:24.373]  And if you're a sanctuary anything, aiding and abetting these criminals, you need to be held accountable and you need to be punished.
[00:58:24.413 --> 00:58:26.075]  That's how we can start to fix some of these issues.
[00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:32.721]  But you're going to see some of these schools, Bellarmine University, Wayne State University, Notre Dame, saying, well, we're not going to take the sanctuary label.
[00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:36.504]  Well, they're playing it out of both sides of the mouth because they're saying, we're already a sanctuary school.
[00:58:36.524 --> 00:58:37.585]  We don't want to put the label on it.
[00:58:37.645 --> 00:58:41.328]  And then Trump's going to look at us with a magnifying glass and find out, well, maybe we are breaking the law.
[00:58:41.368 --> 00:58:42.029]  But you know what?
[00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:44.491]  Go ahead, house whatever illegals you want.
[00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:46.252]  Just don't take government money anymore.
[00:58:46.312 --> 00:58:46.933]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:58:47.153 --> 00:58:50.756]  Yeah, and it's pretty surprising that a lot of schools are willing to do that.
[00:58:50.776 --> 00:58:52.357]  Hope your students appreciate it.
[00:58:52.637 --> 00:58:55.239]  Well, thank you all so much for tuning in to the show tonight.

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
