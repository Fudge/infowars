[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.578]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:22.741]  It is Friday the 27th of January 2017.
[00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:26.287]  I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.229]  A politician that keeps his promises.
[00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.311]  Donald Trump is on a mission to keep his promises to the American people.
[00:00:37.832 --> 00:00:40.233]  Something unheard of in American politics.
[00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:43.856]  Also, voter fraud is anything but debunked.
[00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.758]  More evidence and stories of voter fraud investigation.
[00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:50.460]  When will CNN and the mainstream news outlets admit they were wrong again?
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.366]  And more whining and crying from liberals in media and Hollywood over Trump's victory and the new agenda set by the American Republic.
[00:00:59.886 --> 00:00:59.906]  I
[00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:03.828]  I'm a nasty woman.
[00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:13.770]  And then, American-Islamic relations are becoming a conversation point as Trump's new immigration and refugee policy is in the wings.
[00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.112]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.534]  Well, despite opposition from both sides, President Donald Trump seems to be trying to keep as many campaign promises as possible.
[00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:17.538]  And get this, the media is actually trying to spin this as if he is a man obsessed.
[00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:23.062]  They say he seems obsessed with completing as many of these campaign promises as quickly as possible.
[00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:24.083]  Imagine that!
[00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:28.627]  A politician who actually follows through on their campaign promises.
[00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:37.254]  Somebody that runs for president, makes a lot of promises to the people, and then gets to work as soon as possible to try to make good on those promises.
[00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:44.240]  Of course, people are freaking out because this is going to put their poor quality of work under the microscope.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.843]  So many people saying, wow, you know, he's getting so much done in about a week.
[00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:51.587]  And what's with all this gridlock now?
[00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.191]  I think that those days of gridlock are going to be over.
[00:03:54.251 --> 00:04:01.541]  Donald Trump said he's going to do his very best to work with both sides and also to, you know, keep his promises to the American people.
[00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.465]  Now, he was speaking with Fox News' Sean Hannity.
[00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:06.748]  And he took a very tough stance.
[00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:12.913]  He said, you know, he made it clear he wants extreme vetting in regards to people who are going to be coming into our country.
[00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:16.136]  He says it's not going to be easy for people to come in anymore.
[00:04:16.817 --> 00:04:18.418]  He talked about defending our nation.
[00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:22.722]  He said he's not willing to gamble with the lives of our servicemen and women.
[00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:26.526]  He also mentioned how the FBI currently has over a thousand
[00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:27.667]  We're good to go.
[00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.491]  We're good to go.
[00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:28.204]  But another campaign promise was draining the swamp and it looks like that is happening whether Donald Trump is doing it or we see people, senior officials resigning as well because they don't want to work with his administration.
[00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:29.446]  David Knight has more.
[00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:40.009]  Bernie Sanders and 11 other senators have penned a letter to President Trump accusing him of sowing a culture of fear among federal employees.
[00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:47.374]  Now, I don't know if this is Thomas Jefferson, it's been attributed to a lot of people, but remember the quote, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.155]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:55.376]  And we have been living under the tyranny of a federal bureaucracy for too long.
[00:05:55.476 --> 00:06:04.839]  I have absolutely no sympathy for these people who say that they're concerned they're going to lose their jobs, there's going to be hiring freezes, as well as reductions in workforce.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:15.603]  One of the worst government bureaucracies we have in terms of coming after the American people and extending to an absurd degree their power over our lives is the EPA.
[00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:18.964]  And Trump wants to slash the EPA's $8 billion budget.
[00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:28.246]  And the 15,000-strong workforce says an aide who is part of the transition team, he accuses them of junk science on climate change.
[00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:28.946]  I would agree with that.
[00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:32.647]  This is the former head of President Trump's transition team at the EPA.
[00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.528]  His name is Myron Ebel.
[00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:40.149]  And he said he would like to see, personally would like to see the agency cut in half for a start.
[00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:41.249]  Absolutely.
[00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:42.750]  Let's go to 100%.
[00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:53.753]  Let's understand that it was Richard Nixon who gave us a 55 mile an hour speed limit, who also gave us the EPA, and we don't need the EPA any more than we need a 55 mile an hour speed limit.
[00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:58.375]  He goes on to say that about, he thinks that realistically,
[00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:02.838]  At least $1 billion of their $8 billion budget will be cut.
[00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:03.478]  So that would be 12.5%.
[00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:05.659]  I hope it is more than that.
[00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:14.345]  He comes up with the half figure because he says about half of the EPA's budget passes through state and local governments for infrastructure projects and environmental cleanup.
[00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:17.206]  He said that's something that can be done by the states.
[00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:19.107]  It's currently being managed by the states.
[00:07:19.448 --> 00:07:23.030]  I would like to see the states do all of that at the local level.
[00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.372]  Meanwhile, we see that the head of the Border Patrol, the chief there, has been fired.
[00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:33.554]  Now, this is Mark Morgan, who was just appointed a few months ago by President Obama.
[00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:37.656]  He was not loved by the Border Patrol Union, and an unprecedented move.
[00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:39.837]  If you remember, they endorsed Donald Trump.
[00:07:39.877 --> 00:07:42.538]  They were upset that they could not do their job.
[00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:48.640]  The Border Patrol Union, which endorsed Trump's presidential campaign, applauded the executive action of Donald Trump.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.081]  They've been critical of Morgan.
[00:07:51.161 --> 00:08:00.824]  Morgan had told Reuters that he held a morning phone call with employees to say that he was not resigning, but had been asked to leave by the Trump administration.
[00:08:00.844 --> 00:08:02.384]  In other words, he has been fired.
[00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:12.327]  The Border Patrol counsel called him an arrogant and a disgrace to the Border Patrol, an opinion piece published on November 30th by Breitbart.
[00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:14.228]  And finally, the State Department.
[00:08:14.488 --> 00:08:20.052]  The Washington Post on Thursday said there was a mass exodus of senior foreign officials.
[00:08:20.492 --> 00:08:30.259]  And David Wade, who worked for John Kerry, said it's the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember that's incredibly difficult to replicate.
[00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:33.161]  What makes you think we want to replicate it?
[00:08:33.421 --> 00:08:37.264]  What makes you think there's any value to Benghazi, to the massive email leaks?
[00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.625]  Good riddance.
[00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.672]  Something else Donald Trump has made it very clear, he's got a war on the media right now.
[00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:52.173]  In fact, he is not holding anything back because they have the gloves off and they're trying to paint him as a racist.
[00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:55.354]  And so this is the totally biased press.
[00:08:55.414 --> 00:08:56.854]  Again, he's speaking on Fox News.
[00:08:57.655 --> 00:09:04.076]  He said that the media is obsessed with painting him as a racist and his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon.
[00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:08.917]  Stephen Bannon actually exclaimed that reporters need to shut up and listen.
[00:09:09.477 --> 00:09:15.223]  And of course they cut that quote so that it sounded like Stephen Bannon was saying that the press needs to just shut its mouth.
[00:09:16.063 --> 00:09:20.187]  So just try to paint them as these racist jerks.
[00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:29.336]  But he was also referring to this recent Time report that falsely suggested that he had removed the bust of Martin Luther King from the Oval Office.
[00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:31.058]  Totally false!
[00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.600]  The reporter who was saying this
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.081]  Didn't even ask anyone, hey, did you remove the bus?
[00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.442]  They were just noticing that it wasn't there.
[00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:42.304]  But it turns out it was behind the door, behind a Secret Service agent.
[00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:47.206]  So they didn't even bother to do their due diligence and their journalism to check and see.
[00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:54.810]  But what Trump is saying is that the focus wasn't on, well, where did he move this, where did he move the bus of MLK?
[00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.472]  What the focus was on was that saying Trump is a racist.
[00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.773]  And then when it turned out that it wasn't true,
[00:10:01.493 --> 00:10:01.853]  I don't know.
[00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:30.249]  But one of the things that Trump is really going to upset a lot of people with is he is swiftly moving to undo everything Obama and his administration was about.
[00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.993]  Trump's immigration actions completely reverse Obama's open border policies.
[00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:38.976]  So this was two executive orders that were signed on January 25th.
[00:10:40.397 --> 00:10:46.982]  They constitute almost a complete reversal, again, of the Obama administration's non-enforcement and open borders policy.
[00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:53.007]  They will improve the physical barrier at our southern border to finally moving against sanctuary cities.
[00:10:53.647 --> 00:11:06.697]  These two executive orders put into effect a comprehensive program designed to secure our borders, implement interior enforcement, and reintegrate the assistance of state and local governments into federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.
[00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:16.700]  So not only do we have a politician, a president who is fulfilling his campaign promises, now it looks like we have a federal government that's actually going to be enforcing the immigration laws.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.180]  Hmm.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.220]  Imagine that.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.661]  Much unlike his predecessor, though.
[00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:27.183]  Let's look at this little flashback video where you actually have President Obama encouraging illegal immigrants to vote.
[00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:27.663]  Not true.
[00:11:27.823 --> 00:11:30.586]  And the reason is, first of all, when you vote
[00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:51.423]  Now something that President Trump has been catching a lot of flack for is this
[00:12:05.138 --> 00:12:08.581]  He keeps putting out this message that millions of people voted illegally.
[00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.323]  That was what helped Hillary Clinton win the popular vote.
[00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:22.012]  But now it looks like his argument might be bolstered by a recent study that shows that Clinton could have actually received at least 800,000 votes from non-citizens.
[00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:28.738]  This is according to political scientist Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University of Norfolk, Virginia.
[00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:32.962]  He worked with colleagues to produce this research on non-citizens voting.
[00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:40.508]  He posted that research this week and they're basing this on national polling by a consortium of universities.
[00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:45.893]  They said 6.4% of the estimated 20 million adult non-citizens in the U.S.
[00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:47.014]  could have voted in November.
[00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:50.177]  He extrapolated that that percentage would have added 834,381 net votes for Clinton.
[00:12:54.541 --> 00:13:04.589]  And this means she would have collected 81% of non-citizen votes, which, yeah, maybe that 800,000 isn't that big of a deal, but this means that this could have put her over the edge.
[00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:10.813]  Non-citizens could have helped her win, you know, carry a certain state or finish better than she otherwise would have.
[00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:18.659]  And Kit Daniels reports that this study doesn't account for the dead and fraudulent voters, which accounted for
[00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:24.641]  Over 25 million registered voters during the 2012 presidential election.
[00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:26.342]  Little has changed since then.
[00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.323]  In fact, the population has even grown.
[00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:31.665]  So this was a report by the Pew Center on the States.
[00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:36.227]  Finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote.
[00:13:36.427 --> 00:13:39.128]  24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate.
[00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.129]  And this is according to NPR.
[00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:47.072]  And the Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state.
[00:13:47.673 --> 00:13:48.473]  So there you go.
[00:13:48.513 --> 00:13:54.678]  When President Trump says things like that, he's not just pulling this out of thin air like the media would like you to believe.
[00:13:55.198 --> 00:13:58.620]  And when they said, prove it, he said, there's going to be a major investigation.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.321]  You just wait.
[00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:10.625]  And so yesterday, David Knight and I reported on the fact that the Mexican president is basically declaring war against the United States, saying that they're going to be using their 50 Mexican consulants in the U.S.
[00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:13.866]  to use them as ramparts to protect its citizens.
[00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:15.787]  But it goes even further than that.
[00:14:15.867 --> 00:14:21.989]  Now we have a Mexican senator actually threatening to stop fighting terrorism if Trump builds the wall.
[00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:30.365]  Like they've been doing anything to stop terrorists or gang members from coming across the wall, coming across the border.
[00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:33.051]  Now they say, well, we're just not going to stop ISIS terrorists.
[00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:33.672]  How do you like that?
[00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:47.927]  Well, Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, she has defied Governor Abbott's request that she comply with the Sanctuary City rules that the President has laid forth.
[00:14:48.487 --> 00:15:01.996]  She did a video saying she wasn't going to do it, and we went on the hunt to find Sheriff Hernandez and ask her several attempts to call her office, and somebody finally got back to us and said that she wasn't taking interviews, so we came down here to find her.
[00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:05.638]  Now, in the meantime, we're going to take to the streets and find out what everyday people think
[00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:08.901]  About their sheriff defying federal law.
[00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:10.963]  Why wouldn't you want a sanctuary city like this?
[00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:14.347]  It's a beautiful place to grow up and be part of, to come visit.
[00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:18.731]  We depend on a lot of them to do some of the work that we do not want to do.
[00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:23.677]  And they help out in businesses that we own and operate.
[00:15:23.817 --> 00:15:26.480]  And I think it's a good opportunity for them as well as us.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.881]  I think we should remain a sanctuary city and that the federal government has no right to intervene.
[00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:35.842]  What do you think about Hernandez doing that video saying, we're doing it no matter what you say?
[00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.662]  I'm behind her, absolutely.
[00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:38.842]  She shouldn't lose her job.
[00:15:39.342 --> 00:15:41.383]  Legally, I don't think she should lose her job.
[00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:47.724]  Greg Abbott is saying that he's going to have a special session to remove her.
[00:15:47.844 --> 00:15:49.885]  You don't want to hear what I have to say about Governor Abbott.
[00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:51.705]  I'm a newcomer here.
[00:15:53.564 --> 00:15:54.325]  Where are you from?
[00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:55.445]  Afghanistan.
[00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.927]  Do you have a problem with illegal immigration in Afghanistan?
[00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.728]  With illegal immigration?
[00:16:02.868 --> 00:16:07.630]  People that want to come and stay that you don't want there or that you think should come through legally.
[00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:13.883]  Every country, I think, has its own policy on the visa and immigration.
[00:16:14.623 --> 00:16:18.624]  So, each applicant must see the requirements and eligibility.
[00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:23.106]  The only problem is that, you know, the procedure is very long, you know?
[00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:24.647]  It's very lengthy.
[00:16:25.127 --> 00:16:30.669]  You have to take many process and... Do you think it's fair for people who don't go through that process but still come and stay?
[00:16:31.577 --> 00:16:36.340]  No, I think everything should be in the legal procedure, in my opinion.
[00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:44.666]  Yeah, despite the fact that it's very lengthy, but we should take, you know, we should take the process, whatever it is.
[00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:51.370]  My suggestion is that maybe the authorities can reduce the amount of time that is spent on the visas.
[00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.373]  I was born in Iran, I grew up in Austria, and I moved to the States in 1994.
[00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.015]  Do you think we have a problem with illegal immigration here?
[00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:03.594]  I think there are a lot of problems, but it depends on how you define the problem, huh?
[00:17:04.234 --> 00:17:12.939]  I think it's kind of tough to say whether there's a problem or not, but I think, is it an ideal situation?
[00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:13.700]  Probably not.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.061]  Is there an ideal solution?
[00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:18.983]  Probably, but there's going to be a lot of consultation.
[00:17:19.003 --> 00:17:21.565]  You came through the process legally, correct?
[00:17:21.585 --> 00:17:22.025]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:17:22.045 --> 00:17:24.927]  Do you have an issue with other people who kind of jump the line and don't do that?
[00:17:26.457 --> 00:17:29.478]  Well, I think there are exceptions to every rule.
[00:17:29.538 --> 00:17:34.259]  I think, you know, my friend over here, he actually flew in from San Diego yesterday.
[00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:39.440]  So this guy actually woke up 45 minutes before his flight took off, right?
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.520]  What's your point though?
[00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:44.001]  My point is that this guy, you know, had a special situation.
[00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:51.223]  He jumped the line not only at the airport to get his baggage checked, he also jumped the security line, but he had a good point.
[00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:54.564]  Obviously, it's probably his fault why he didn't get there on time, but
[00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:57.347]  Do you think we have a problem with illegal immigration in the country?
[00:17:57.587 --> 00:17:59.609]  I'm a foreigner, so I have no opinion on this.
[00:17:59.769 --> 00:18:04.774]  Do you think that you guys have a serious problem with a refugee crisis going on in your country?
[00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:05.175]  Yeah, I do.
[00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:06.976]  And I hope there's a solution soon.
[00:18:07.277 --> 00:18:08.178]  Tell me about the problem.
[00:18:11.877 --> 00:18:17.983]  So the problem is that we didn't register all the immigrants that came in the wave last year.
[00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:21.607]  And now we're trying to find the people who are, you know, the bad ones among them.
[00:18:22.327 --> 00:18:25.050]  And it's literally impossible.
[00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.815]  I think steps need to be taken right now to actually conquer this problem.
[00:18:30.616 --> 00:18:31.156]  Or we will be.
[00:18:32.113 --> 00:18:39.839]  So we saw a mixed bag of opinion here on the Capitol steps in Austin, Texas, regarding Sally Hernandez and her politics.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.260]  Will she be removed?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.781]  Will she won't be?
[00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:52.309]  The surprising aspect for me, every refugee, every person that has asylum status or a visa, they all think that the process should be respected legally, and people just shouldn't jump the line.
[00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.112]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:56.425]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets, I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:51.325]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Central Texas News Center in Austin.

[00:23:06.684 --> 00:23:08.445]  Well, here at InfoWars, we've been pretty busy.
[00:23:08.485 --> 00:23:12.669]  There just simply are not enough of us to call out the mainstream media and all of their bull.
[00:23:13.089 --> 00:23:22.756]  People like Don Lemon and this Christoph character, Nicholas Christoph at the New York Times, they are having a field day talking about how Donald Trump is a liar and a crackpot.
[00:23:22.796 --> 00:23:23.797]  They're the crackpots.
[00:23:23.957 --> 00:23:25.078]  I just want to lay that out there.
[00:23:25.118 --> 00:23:28.921]  But Donald Trump, no joke, has had a really huge week.
[00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:29.802]  Thank you.
[00:23:45.922 --> 00:23:51.025]  It talks about how Donald Trump's first seven days were met with unapologetic falsehoods.
[00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:53.307]  And, oh, did he really, tweets.
[00:23:53.747 --> 00:23:54.888]  Oh, yes, he did, folks.
[00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:56.769]  And he is not the liar.
[00:23:56.869 --> 00:23:58.130]  Everybody knows that you are.
[00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.492]  And you're dying out, you ridiculous fake news.
[00:24:00.612 --> 00:24:15.702]  Now, the Obamacare order that this article talks about, Trump's first executive order on inauguration day, directed his agencies to do, quote, whatever they could to the maximum extent permitted by law to minimize the impact of Obamacare until it can be repealed.
[00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:18.284]  How in the hell is that a bad thing?
[00:24:18.364 --> 00:24:20.065]  Obamacare is bankrupt.
[00:24:20.185 --> 00:24:23.868]  It's going to be put on the backs of hardworking people that frankly can't afford it.
[00:24:23.928 --> 00:24:26.731]  Premiums are going to go up three times what they are now.
[00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:29.093]  It was a joke and a scheme to begin with.
[00:24:29.193 --> 00:24:34.397]  And Jonathan Gruber, its architect, he said, look, we passed this because all of the American citizens, they're idiots.
[00:24:34.737 --> 00:24:36.298]  They don't ever question us.
[00:24:36.338 --> 00:24:38.179]  We've got the benefit of not being transparent.
[00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:52.928]  God bless President Trump for taking the initiative to gut this using the maximum extent of the law and shame on you Politico and all of you fake news journalists over there who have the audacity to say that that's a bad thing.
[00:24:52.988 --> 00:24:56.410]  Now he's got a massive challenge in front of him this week as we know.
[00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:16.219]  Because there's so many bureaucratic arms to this massive government that we have and they have a lot of fat that needs to be trend a lot of people that are taking advantage of Taxpayer money that funds them with these ridiculous superfluous things and I want to take you to the VA because we know that the VA is
[00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:17.700]  It has one job, folks.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.845]  It's to take care of some of America's most precious citizens, our veterans.
[00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.907]  And the cleanup of the VA, it's inherently corrupt.
[00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:29.591]  It has all of these employees in it that have no accountability.
[00:25:30.031 --> 00:25:34.435]  And we know that he is facing a massive challenge in cleaning up the VA.
[00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:36.156]  Now, I found this article.
[00:25:36.196 --> 00:25:37.217]  It was on the Daily Caller.
[00:25:38.338 --> 00:25:44.922]  And the day that Trump took office, these corrupt employees were fired at the VA.
[00:25:45.102 --> 00:25:47.683]  And you just will not believe who's working over there.
[00:25:47.783 --> 00:25:49.384]  I read this and it really fell out of my chair.
[00:25:49.404 --> 00:25:56.988]  It was just unbelievable, the misconduct of these two employees that were fired the day that Trump took office.
[00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:02.171]  Now, one of them is Dwayne Hamlin, and he offered another fellow VA employee $305,000 to quit.
[00:26:04.492 --> 00:26:07.574]  After she played a role in exposing his drug arrest.
[00:26:07.654 --> 00:26:12.096]  Now, this man has no business serving in federal service, mind you.
[00:26:12.176 --> 00:26:15.858]  He has no business being a dog catcher in a local town, frankly.
[00:26:16.678 --> 00:26:23.882]  But he was managing one aspect of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and he is notoriously corrupt.
[00:26:24.742 --> 00:26:25.742]  Obama did nothing.
[00:26:26.122 --> 00:26:34.005]  He left these people in power like this and they're in charge of serving veterans and we know that they've fallen miserably in doing that.
[00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:41.107]  Part of the reason is people like this guy who belong in jail and not working on behalf of America's veterans.
[00:26:41.127 --> 00:26:42.428]  We know the VA is very toxic.
[00:26:43.048 --> 00:26:52.151]  Another organization that we know is quite toxic, no pun intended, because they're responsible for identifying toxicity, especially in our atmosphere,
[00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:53.252]  I don't know.
[00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:19.398]  But what it is doing is these ridiculous superfluous projects that inhibit and impair business.
[00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:21.200]  Trump is saying no more.
[00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:25.905]  Now, I want to take you to one quote that I found that was of particular interest to me.
[00:27:25.925 --> 00:27:27.507]  This article was written by James Briggs.
[00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:35.114]  I don't know.
[00:27:58.144 --> 00:28:11.330]  Something else that should have chapped you on the you-know-what that really got me, Obama in his final few hours of office, while President Trump was preparing to take the oath of office, he was of course sending $221 million in a handout to the Palestinians.
[00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:17.814]  It looks like President Trump has put a moratorium.
[00:28:17.854 --> 00:28:24.701]  He has frozen that money and initially the funds were approved by Congress in the fiscal year of 2015 and 2016.
[00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:31.307]  However, two Republican lawmakers put a hold on the transfer, voicing concern that the money could fall into the wrong hands.
[00:28:32.268 --> 00:28:32.788]  You think?
[00:28:33.749 --> 00:28:37.050]  We got a president who was supporting terrorism.
[00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:38.331]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:28:38.571 --> 00:28:42.173]  And Tulsi Gabbard, she's a Democrat, and frankly, God bless her.
[00:28:42.273 --> 00:28:43.093]  She is in Congress.
[00:28:43.153 --> 00:28:44.554]  She's a congresswoman from Hawaii.
[00:28:44.854 --> 00:28:54.098]  She just came back from Syria, and she said, look, there was no question that the Obama administration was funding al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and ISIS, and they're killing innocent civilians.
[00:28:54.398 --> 00:29:01.261]  It looks like we've got somebody in charge that's finally stepping up and saying, we really need to question who we're giving money to because it's falling into the wrong hands.
[00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:11.845]  I'm of the belief, of course the Obama administration knowingly deceived the American public when they said that we've got this humanitarian issue and we're going to arm moderate rebels.
[00:29:12.145 --> 00:29:12.666]  Hey, guess what?
[00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:14.226]  There's no such thing as a moderate rebel.
[00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:16.067]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:29:16.427 --> 00:29:18.208]  And they were actually funding terrorists.
[00:29:18.828 --> 00:29:20.949]  And this Congresswoman confirmed that on CNN.
[00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.730]  You know what?
[00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:27.372]  I don't hear CNN calling him a liar when clearly he was falsehood after falsehood, however you want to call it.
[00:29:27.692 --> 00:29:30.113]  You've got these ridiculous crackpots calling Trump a liar.
[00:29:30.133 --> 00:29:31.274]  He's only been in office a week.
[00:29:31.934 --> 00:29:35.895]  I mean, eight years of lies, folks, frankly, but it looks like this money's being frozen.
[00:29:35.915 --> 00:29:38.036]  I couldn't be happier about it.
[00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:43.538]  And just closing this Palestinian story out really quickly, $221 million.
[00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:50.720]  One senior Palestinian source told the Times of Israel that the Palestine Authority leadership was notified by U.S.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.162]  officials that they should not expect the payout because there's a new sheriff in town.
[00:29:56.142 --> 00:30:02.606]  And it looks like he is putting a stop to funding, you know, states that promote terrorism, frankly.
[00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:03.907]  That's what it's coming down to.
[00:30:04.187 --> 00:30:06.769]  And this is not an Israel-Palestine debate right now.
[00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:10.812]  I know I get a lot of crap online whenever I say anything positive about Israel.
[00:30:11.192 --> 00:30:14.474]  This is simply about, you know, expressing the will of the American people.
[00:30:14.514 --> 00:30:15.775]  We're talking about cleaning up corruption.
[00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:20.618]  We don't want to support terrorism any longer because, you know, that's frankly freaking ridiculous.
[00:30:21.118 --> 00:30:30.084]  And we don't want the EPA wasting buckets and buckets of money and not producing any results on anything and producing these ridiculous studies that inhibit business.
[00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:33.047]  Now, I want to take you to another controversial thing that Trump is doing.
[00:30:33.627 --> 00:30:35.929]  And Owen Schroer just shot a report on this.
[00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:40.212]  There's going to be a march, a pro-life march, on Capitol Hill coming up this weekend.
[00:30:41.613 --> 00:30:42.074]  NPR's take
[00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:02.532]  committing and perpetuating abortions overseas.
[00:31:02.572 --> 00:31:05.954]  We've got this foreign government aid that goes out.
[00:31:05.994 --> 00:31:06.495]  It's U.S.
[00:31:06.535 --> 00:31:09.597]  taxpayer dollars that provide abortions to women overseas.
[00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:15.942]  Now, these, of course, are women in very poor areas, extremely impoverished parts of Africa.
[00:31:16.702 --> 00:31:22.046]  Namely, according to this article, it features a woman in Kenya at a clinic getting instructions over her cervix.
[00:31:22.466 --> 00:31:23.327]  Love the cover of that.
[00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:26.029]  We know that Planned Parenthood, they don't
[00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:27.050]  We're good to go.
[00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:51.210]  Obamacare was responsible for funding most of that.
[00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.353]  Now, that has ridiculous freaks like Ashley Judd up in arms.
[00:31:55.554 --> 00:31:56.414]  Just absolutely.
[00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:57.615]  I'm from Kentucky.
[00:31:57.635 --> 00:32:00.538]  I am so ashamed that this woman is from my state.
[00:32:00.998 --> 00:32:05.282]  And when we saw this video, we had to pull it for you because, you know what?
[00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:10.847]  She has been at the forefront of abortion advocacy groups in Washington.
[00:32:11.187 --> 00:32:12.828]  She has totally frickin' lost her mind.
[00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:14.450]  Take a look at what she had to say.
[00:32:15.091 --> 00:32:15.571]  Ashley!
[00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:17.572]  My name is Ashley Judd.
[00:32:17.632 --> 00:32:18.513]  Ashley Judd is here!
[00:32:18.593 --> 00:32:19.814]  And I am a feminist.
[00:32:21.514 --> 00:32:29.679]  And I want to say hello to Independence Avenue in the back, all the way down to 17th Street.
[00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:30.379]  Wow!
[00:32:33.281 --> 00:32:43.006]  And I bring you words from Nina Donovan, a 19-year-old in Middle Tennessee, and she has given me the privilege of telling you what she has to say.
[00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:48.465]  I am a nasty woman.
[00:32:50.026 --> 00:32:51.567]  You know, I didn't say it folks, she did.
[00:32:51.667 --> 00:32:55.390]  What a nasty, nasty woman that Ashley Judd is, literally.
[00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.734]  Be sure, stay tuned, coming up for more reports after this break.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:08.260]  The president does believe that.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.581]  He has stated that before.
[00:37:09.641 --> 00:37:14.905]  I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign.
[00:37:15.386 --> 00:37:19.469]  And he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.
[00:37:19.749 --> 00:37:23.932]  Our role is to be watchdogs and we have to provide that kind of accountability.
[00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:31.959]  And I think when a president or anybody else says something that is verifiably, empirically false, then one has to call him out on it.
[00:37:32.259 --> 00:37:33.961]  My name is Brittany Foreman.
[00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:37.704]  I work in the 52nd Ward, the 15th Division.
[00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:40.586]  And today I witnessed voter fraud.
[00:37:40.627 --> 00:37:44.610]  It's tough to call the President of the United States a liar, because you want to respect the office.
[00:37:45.171 --> 00:37:52.557]  But I think it does a disservice to the American people, and even to the President, and even to, you know, journalists.
[00:37:52.577 --> 00:37:53.158]  Not to call.
[00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:55.809]  Call it what it is, and it is a lie.
[00:37:55.929 --> 00:38:02.151]  Election judges confirmed there were issues with two of the eight automated voting machines in the Clinton Township building.
[00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:06.392]  Most of the issues stemmed from people trying to vote straight party ticket.
[00:38:06.432 --> 00:38:16.294]  However, a number of voters told me that specifically they wanted to vote for the Republican Donald Trump, only to see their votes switched before their eyes to the Democrat Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:16.934 --> 00:38:19.937]  Because he's trying to legitimize his election?
[00:38:20.397 --> 00:38:35.310]  Is it because down the road Democrats are fearful that this might lead to voter suppression efforts by the Republican administration, keeping people from being able to vote in the future by requiring certain identity documents that a lot of people just don't have?
[00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:40.734]  Like, according to Joe DeFelice, the chairman of the Philadelphia Republican Party, you guys are saying that may be happening, is that correct?
[00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:41.494]  Oh, it's happening.
[00:38:41.534 --> 00:38:44.216]  Everything they said we were going to do, they're actually doing.
[00:38:44.236 --> 00:38:46.658]  They're intimidating, they're suppressing, they're disenfranchising.
[00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:47.478]  It's getting ridiculous.
[00:38:47.498 --> 00:38:53.262]  Give me some people in both parties, and independents as well, should want fair elections.
[00:38:53.322 --> 00:38:54.923]  They want every vote counted.
[00:38:55.123 --> 00:38:55.664]  What's wrong?
[00:38:55.724 --> 00:38:58.185]  What's the downside of having one of these investigations?
[00:38:58.265 --> 00:38:58.546]  Anything?
[00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:04.848]  Rob Due with InfoWars.com, and in case you haven't been paying attention, vote fraud is back in the news.
[00:39:04.888 --> 00:39:10.811]  And no, this time it isn't the Russians hacking our democracy, it's Donald Trump undermining it with tweets.
[00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:17.434]  In fact, if you look at mainstream media news, we have headlines from CNN, White House, Trump believes millions voted illegally.
[00:39:18.214 --> 00:39:18.915]  Washington Post.
[00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:22.997]  Trump seeks major investigation into unsupported claims of voter fraud.
[00:39:23.598 --> 00:39:24.258]  USA Today.
[00:39:24.598 --> 00:39:25.159]  Fact check.
[00:39:25.399 --> 00:39:26.980]  Trump claims massive voter fraud.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.861]  Here's the truth.
[00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:32.424]  And finally from Politico, Trump's bad voter fraud math.
[00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:38.187]  Now this is the same Politico that back in 2015 said how illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[00:39:38.548 --> 00:39:39.488]  And what are they talking about?
[00:39:39.528 --> 00:39:41.650]  Are they talking about illegal immigrants voting illegally?
[00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:48.615]  No, what they're talking about is illegal immigrants going into states and changing the way the Electoral College is appropriated.
[00:39:49.436 --> 00:40:00.385]  Thanks to the unique math undergirding the Electoral College, the mere presence of 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants and other non-citizens here legally may enable them to swing the election from Republicans to Democrats.
[00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:07.627]  In fact, there are 435 electoral seats that are re-appropriated every 10 years due to the census.
[00:40:08.028 --> 00:40:13.514]  So if you have a massive wave of illegal immigrants, they could tip the scales into the favor of the Democrats.
[00:40:14.255 --> 00:40:22.824]  And these findings are echoed by a study from Old Dominion and George Mason University done back in 2014 titled, Do Non-Citizens Vote in U.S.
[00:40:22.884 --> 00:40:23.324]  Elections?
[00:40:24.105 --> 00:40:29.048]  The highlights include first use of representative sample to measure non-citizen voting in the USA.
[00:40:29.529 --> 00:40:32.410]  They also found that some non-citizens cast votes in U.S.
[00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.091]  elections despite legal bans.
[00:40:34.952 --> 00:40:38.454]  They also found that non-citizens favored Democratic candidates over Republicans.
[00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:46.319]  And they found that non-citizens likely changed the 2008 outcomes including the Electoral College votes and the composition of Congress.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.163]  They also said that voter photo identification rules have limited effect on non-citizen voter participation.
[00:40:53.311 --> 00:41:05.420]  And specifically in the study, the authors say that illegals may have cast as many as 2.8 million votes in 2008 and 2010, which is the same number of votes that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by in this past election.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.604]  So it really makes you wonder, is Donald Trump full of bunk when he says we need to do an investigation into this?
[00:41:10.984 --> 00:41:12.145]  Or is there something behind it?
[00:41:12.525 --> 00:41:16.268]  The mainstream media wants you to think that voter fraud has never occurred in this country, ever.
[00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:19.831]  But now I'm going to go into some instances that happened just in this past election.
[00:41:20.677 --> 00:41:23.898]  So there's a checklist on whether or not a precinct can be unrecountable.
[00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:32.160]  If there's a large tear in the ballot container that would allow ballots to be removed or ballots to be put in, that potentially could deem a precinct unrecountable.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:44.964]  If the seal on the ballot container bag doesn't match the seal number written in the poll book, that could potentially be a cause for an unrecountable precinct as well.
[00:41:45.618 --> 00:41:48.701]  Half of Detroit votes may be ineligible for recount.
[00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:52.804]  Michigan's largest county voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:53.205 --> 00:42:01.131]  But officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of the 1,680 precincts during a county-wide canvas of vote results last month.
[00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:04.634]  That's right, and this was one of the states where Jill Stein was trying to have a recount.
[00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:07.277]  And notice that recount in that state got quashed.
[00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:18.159]  Furthermore, in heavily Democratic Detroit, it was found that 59% of the precinct poll books did not match those of the voting machine printouts.
[00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:19.840]  That's 392 precincts out of 662.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:29.284]  Now let's move over to PA, where just yesterday, a spokesman for the State Department there said, We have no evidence at all of voter fraud.
[00:42:29.544 --> 00:42:32.766]  There's no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted in November.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:41.664]  But earlier this month, the Secretary of State said, we had up to 700 voters that may have cast two ballots in different counties in this election.
[00:42:42.104 --> 00:42:52.270]  In fact, the Secretary of State, Carol Asheel, was quoted as saying, there's potential for voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and added, she's powerless to investigate or prosecute double voters.
[00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:58.313]  And back during election day, Philadelphia GOP member, Brittany Foreman, said she witnessed voter fraud.
[00:42:58.573 --> 00:43:02.375]  She witnessed people trying to tell people how to vote in Philadelphia.
[00:43:02.875 --> 00:43:08.858]  And in early November, state police raided the offices of Delco to seek evidence of voter registration fraud.
[00:43:08.878 --> 00:43:10.919]  And that's in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.222]  Again, another swing state where the vote counts were stopped.
[00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:16.822]  You see how this is happening?
[00:43:16.902 --> 00:43:21.164]  Anywhere where there might be voter fraud or widespread voter fraud, the recounts were stopped.
[00:43:21.184 --> 00:43:22.905]  Now, there were only recounts in three states.
[00:43:23.265 --> 00:43:25.405]  Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
[00:43:25.706 --> 00:43:29.547]  But there were other states that were reporting hacks to their voter registration systems.
[00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:35.769]  One of which was Georgia, and the IP address of the computer that was attacking them led back to DHS.
[00:43:36.089 --> 00:43:40.251]  Now, when DHS was questioned about this, they said, well, it might be a rogue employee, we don't know.
[00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:48.696]  And then when the head of elections of Georgia canvassed other states, they found at least five other states were getting pings from the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:43:49.276 --> 00:43:55.140]  And then we had Obama, as he was walking out the door, wanting to put Homeland Security in charge of our election systems.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.724]  And finally, from the Daily Caller back in October, here's what voter fraud looks like in 23 states.
[00:44:01.104 --> 00:44:06.347]  And they highlight cases in Virginia, Colorado, Michigan, and California, and 19 other states.
[00:44:08.735 --> 00:44:17.467]  So voter fraud is real, and I commend the President for wanting to do an investigation on it, and the mainstream media needs to get out of the way and shut up until we see what the findings are.
[00:44:17.808 --> 00:44:21.293]  This has been Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:44:25.759 --> 00:44:28.021]  There's an all-out war going on in this country right now.
[00:44:28.081 --> 00:44:31.043]  The media is waging war on President Trump.
[00:44:31.083 --> 00:44:35.126]  Now, I wanted to bring this to you because Alex is talking about it right now on the radio show Live.
[00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:41.772]  Don Lemon and this crackpot from the New York Times, Nicholas Christoph is his name, they are making the most ridiculous,
[00:44:42.332 --> 00:44:46.114]  Horrible statements about Donald Trump that simply aren't true, and I want to address them.
[00:44:46.574 --> 00:44:51.996]  Now, they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves and humiliated, frankly, because they're calling him a liar.
[00:44:52.036 --> 00:44:54.837]  They're calling the sitting president of the United States a liar.
[00:44:54.897 --> 00:44:55.858]  Guess what, fellas?
[00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:57.218]  You're the liars.
[00:44:57.279 --> 00:44:59.219]  We all know that you spout this fake news.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:05.162]  You're totally, you're totally, and I'm not going to say the word that I want to use when concerning you, but you're full of it.
[00:45:05.342 --> 00:45:06.122]  You know that you are.
[00:45:06.243 --> 00:45:07.563]  And I want to take you to this article now.
[00:45:07.743 --> 00:45:08.624]  Steve Watson wrote it.
[00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:09.564]  It's up on our website.
[00:45:09.584 --> 00:45:17.529]  It talks about the biased press and how they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves and humiliated because of what they're talking about, what they're saying.
[00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:19.110]  They're simply not reporting the truth.
[00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:27.675]  Taking you to this one article, this Time report, that said that President Trump was removing the Martin Luther King bus from the Oval Office.
[00:45:28.155 --> 00:45:39.922]  That's a very serious charge, folks, and he didn't do that, and they're trying to paint him as a racist bigot because they know that that's worked in the past before when they try to mudsling and make those accusations against people.
[00:45:39.942 --> 00:45:42.743]  It makes people back down, but they can't do it in this case.
[00:45:42.763 --> 00:45:43.324]  They've already lost.
[00:45:44.484 --> 00:45:46.325]  Trump has had a stellar week so far.
[00:45:46.405 --> 00:45:54.208]  He is slaying the dragons all across Washington, gutting the massive corrupt bureaucracies, put a freeze on the EPA, a hold on their money.
[00:45:54.288 --> 00:46:02.652]  He's rescinding and frozen, he will rescind it, he's frozen the Palestinian payout that Obama did the last day of office, those final few hours.
[00:46:03.012 --> 00:46:06.694]  He was paying off the Palestinians while Trump was preparing to take the oath.
[00:46:06.994 --> 00:46:09.395]  And I just want to point this out really quickly before we close.
[00:46:09.815 --> 00:46:15.220]  The new administration is going to be hitting hard back against you corporate, ridiculous media idiots.
[00:46:15.861 --> 00:46:17.963]  And you're trying to delegitimize his office.
[00:46:18.023 --> 00:46:18.644]  It's not going to work.
[00:46:19.004 --> 00:46:21.046]  We've got his back, and I know our viewers do too.
[00:46:21.086 --> 00:46:21.867]  Check out this article.
[00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:22.788]  It's up on our website.

[00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:27.993]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting.
[00:46:33.154 --> 00:46:34.715]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:34.735 --> 00:46:36.437]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:36.917 --> 00:46:37.137]  Okay?
[00:46:37.438 --> 00:46:40.300]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.202]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:42.222 --> 00:46:43.603]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:43.863 --> 00:46:44.564]  This is Texas.
[00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:45.605]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:46:45.685 --> 00:46:46.786]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:46.826 --> 00:46:47.466]  You understand that?
[00:46:47.626 --> 00:46:53.351]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:57.655]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.438 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.056]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:48:59.957]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:00.017]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:12.010]  Well, it's been just about a week since millions of women took to the streets of D.C.
[00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.733]  and all across the country to resist President Donald Trump.
[00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:22.937]  So we're going to kind of take a look at that march versus the pro-life march that's happening in D.C.
[00:49:23.057 --> 00:49:23.478]  today.
[00:49:24.498 --> 00:49:28.261]  As well as, I guess, some other places around the country will be having their marches tomorrow.
[00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:35.865]  But it's very interesting because some more information is coming out about the leaders of the Women's March.
[00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:47.213]  So we reported on the fact that Laura Sarsour, who's the Executive Director of the Arab American Association of New York, she was co-chair of the Women's March.
[00:49:47.953 --> 00:49:50.495]  She's also an advocate for Sharia law.
[00:49:51.056 --> 00:49:54.138]  She was meeting up with an ex-Hamas guy.
[00:49:55.379 --> 00:50:04.307]  And, you know, she also is attacking a female genital mutilation survivor saying, I would wish I could take her vagina away.
[00:50:04.387 --> 00:50:06.048]  She doesn't deserve to be a woman.
[00:50:06.249 --> 00:50:08.991]  So here's this really spectacular woman.
[00:50:09.531 --> 00:50:11.994]  But then it turns out we have another woman here.
[00:50:14.453 --> 00:50:23.402]  Donna Hilton, she was a convicted felon who took part in the kidnapping, torturing, sodomizing, and murder of a man.
[00:50:23.422 --> 00:50:27.487]  And they say that he's a gay man, but that wasn't really actually confirmed.
[00:50:28.207 --> 00:50:32.872]  It was just when they were being asked, you know, talked to by the police, why did you
[00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:34.894]  Do the things you did to this man.
[00:50:34.934 --> 00:50:36.855]  They said, oh, well, he was a homo anyway.
[00:50:36.895 --> 00:50:41.058]  And just total, terrible, cold people.
[00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:51.145]  They kidnapped and held this man for ransom and were beating him, torturing him, taking like a vice to his testicles and things for almost 20 days.
[00:50:51.185 --> 00:50:55.268]  And then they had his body in a trunk and they tried to get ransom for this guy.
[00:50:55.308 --> 00:50:57.649]  So she was like 20 years old when this happened.
[00:50:58.109 --> 00:51:03.213]  But now it's all about, you know, we need to protect her rights and she's the victim and she's oppressed and everything.
[00:51:03.993 --> 00:51:08.115]  It's like, so she did come out and say that she was a nasty woman, so.
[00:51:08.675 --> 00:51:10.536]  Well there is a... I guess she wasn't lying about that.
[00:51:10.556 --> 00:51:22.081]  There's actually a case history, if you look at these Soros movements, some of the leaders are usually, if not previously tied into domestic violence or stuff of that nature, they end up being tied into it.
[00:51:22.361 --> 00:51:24.602]  So this is just another example of that, but
[00:51:25.202 --> 00:51:38.432]  You know, the comparisons that I wanted to make when talking about the March for Life that was today versus the anti-Trump march, oh, excuse me, the women's march that happened after the inauguration, there were some differences that were pretty obvious.
[00:51:39.132 --> 00:51:44.676]  If you went up and you talked to the people at the March for Life and you had a camera and you said, hey, what are you here for?
[00:51:44.716 --> 00:51:45.297]  What are you doing?
[00:51:45.779 --> 00:51:46.979]  They actually could answer you.
[00:51:47.279 --> 00:51:49.060]  They actually had a reason for being there.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:54.142]  And if you asked everybody there, they all had the same reason.
[00:51:54.302 --> 00:51:55.302]  That was solidarity.
[00:51:55.622 --> 00:51:58.103]  Something that we did not have at the Women's March.
[00:51:58.123 --> 00:51:59.843]  They all had their different reasons for being there.
[00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:04.125]  Yeah, they wouldn't even allow women to be there if they had opposing views.
[00:52:04.345 --> 00:52:10.767]  If you were vocally supportive of Trump, or if you were pro-life, you weren't allowed to officially take part in the event.
[00:52:10.807 --> 00:52:14.048]  So they couldn't even, it was supposed to be a Women's March, but they couldn't even
[00:52:14.748 --> 00:52:16.129]  You know, be unified in that.
[00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:25.974]  You also don't see any signs with degenerative words or offensive speech on them, just flat-out curse words like we saw at the Women's March.
[00:52:26.555 --> 00:52:35.160]  And you won't see people attacking and assaulting reporters with either violent rhetoric or literally assaulting them with their hands.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.302]  So, this is just a difference that we saw between the Women's March and the March for Life.
[00:52:39.802 --> 00:52:43.284]  I actually have attended the March for Life twice in my life.
[00:52:43.364 --> 00:52:46.485]  Both times that I went, nearly a million people marched in Washington.
[00:52:46.865 --> 00:52:47.726]  It was peaceful.
[00:52:48.786 --> 00:52:50.247]  Everybody there was at solidarity.
[00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.648]  And everybody knew what they were marching for.
[00:52:53.189 --> 00:52:54.489]  And the turnout was amazing.
[00:52:54.529 --> 00:52:56.010]  The turnout was, again, amazing today.
[00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.010]  You can see the numbers.
[00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:57.871]  They're organized.
[00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:59.972]  They're marching in Washington just like they always do.
[00:53:00.572 --> 00:53:11.382]  So it just was, it was just amazing because the Women's March got all of this coverage as the Women's March got all of these celebrities to come out and even vocally support it, the Women's March.
[00:53:11.502 --> 00:53:12.703]  And threatened to blow up the White House.
[00:53:12.743 --> 00:53:14.465]  Of course, and then there was that stuff too.
[00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:17.328]  But you didn't get the same coverage for the March for Life.
[00:53:17.368 --> 00:53:20.370]  You didn't get the same celebrity support for the March for Life.
[00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:24.014]  Of course, Donald Trump announced his support, Mike Pence spoke, Kellyanne Conway spoke.
[00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.356]  Pence actually spoke at the event, first time that's ever happened.
[00:53:26.476 --> 00:53:34.144]  And then tomorrow in Austin, this Saturday, InfoWars will actually be at the March for Life in Austin covering that.
[00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.705]  So we'll have some updates there.
[00:53:35.725 --> 00:53:40.070]  But I do expect there to be some protesters, but the marchers I'm sure will be good people.
[00:53:40.578 --> 00:54:00.840]  Yeah, well it'll definitely be really interesting to just see the kind of people that are attracted to both events and just seeing the women at the Women's March last week just kind of capitulating to Islam and putting on the hijabs and letting these women, the co-chair of the event,
[00:54:01.761 --> 00:54:10.347]  You know, a vocal supporter of Sharia law, which is, you know, if you're a woman practicing that, you're already going to be a second or third class citizen.
[00:54:10.367 --> 00:54:11.127]  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:12.929]  It is nothing about women's equality.
[00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:17.091]  Well, and I'm glad that you brought that up because here were some other stories that I wanted to cover.
[00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:17.272]  Now,
[00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:29.277]  American and Islam relations are obviously in the fray right now, and Donald Trump's looming immigration and refugee policy is starting to bring some of this to the head.
[00:54:30.158 --> 00:54:31.339]  Here was a story out of St.
[00:54:31.419 --> 00:54:31.580]  Louis.
[00:54:33.302 --> 00:54:43.104]  There was a meeting that went down from the CAIR, the Council on American Islamic Relations, and they're saying that many are fearing for their lives, their mosques, their careers.
[00:54:43.124 --> 00:54:50.506]  A group representing local Muslims is speaking out against President Trump's plan to ban refugees and block visitors from Muslim nations.
[00:54:51.206 --> 00:55:00.848]  He says that Trump's actions, which is designed to make America more safe, will actually make it more dangerous, saying that it adds to the terrorist understanding of the world, that the U.S.
[00:55:00.888 --> 00:55:01.888]  is at war with Islam.
[00:55:02.668 --> 00:55:04.309]  And that the U.S.
[00:55:04.529 --> 00:55:09.291]  is undermining their own reputation around the world, basically, by doing this.
[00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:13.353]  And he fears that it could lead to homegrown terrorists, to which I'm sitting here saying, well, wait a second.
[00:55:13.773 --> 00:55:19.655]  If it's not a problem, then why are you fearful that it's going to lead to more terrorism?
[00:55:19.836 --> 00:55:20.036]  Right.
[00:55:20.376 --> 00:55:22.857]  So there obviously is some sort of a problem here.
[00:55:23.137 --> 00:55:29.263]  Right, well that's the thing is if you insult their prophet, that's, I mean they, it's like that's their duty.
[00:55:29.303 --> 00:55:31.685]  They have to attack you in that sense.
[00:55:31.705 --> 00:55:32.746]  They have to kill you.
[00:55:32.986 --> 00:55:35.368]  And that's just, I guess, their religious text.
[00:55:35.409 --> 00:55:38.291]  But I don't believe that all Muslim people are like that.
[00:55:38.331 --> 00:55:39.913]  I think the majority of them are peaceful people.
[00:55:39.953 --> 00:55:41.194]  But here's the problem.
[00:55:41.274 --> 00:55:59.475]  You know, that's exactly why General Mattis is going to be so great, because he specifically says, you know, we have to be able to work with our allies in the Arab world, we have to be able to differentiate between people, peaceful, billions of peaceful Muslims out there practicing the religion of Islam, and then we have this radical Islam to be able to differentiate.
[00:56:00.185 --> 00:56:05.708]  Now here in Austin, Texas Muslims voice concerns after inflammatory survey and form.
[00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:15.153]  Just over a week ago, an envelope marked urgent reply ASAP began going around to the mailboxes of Texas Muslim leaders.
[00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:18.174]  And it was an unusual document.
[00:56:18.215 --> 00:56:20.456]  They decided that it was highly inflammatory.
[00:56:20.876 --> 00:56:22.377]  It had three questions on it.
[00:56:22.877 --> 00:56:24.198]  The three questions were
[00:56:25.464 --> 00:56:31.031]  If the president would support a pledge for religious freedom and safety from harm for former Muslims, would you support that?
[00:56:31.392 --> 00:56:34.937]  Another one asked if the Muslim Brotherhood should be declared a terrorist organization.
[00:56:35.417 --> 00:56:42.486]  And another one asked if they would support a Muslim reform movement which opposes violent jihad or violent...
[00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:44.328]  Islamic extremism.
[00:56:44.388 --> 00:56:53.195]  Now, the person that wrote this was state representative Kyle Biderman, and of course he received a lot of flack for that.
[00:56:53.255 --> 00:56:57.979]  They were saying it was inflammatory, that he was only adding to the problem, and here's my issue.
[00:56:58.039 --> 00:57:01.762]  Now, you can say whether or not, you can have your own opinion on whether or not that was inflammatory.
[00:57:01.802 --> 00:57:03.523]  The New York Times covered this, but here's my thing.
[00:57:04.243 --> 00:57:06.005]  We have to have these conversations.
[00:57:06.045 --> 00:57:09.147]  You cannot just say, this offends me, I don't want to talk about it.
[00:57:10.308 --> 00:57:15.632]  You can't also not deny that there is radical extremist terrorist attacks happening.
[00:57:15.652 --> 00:57:17.994]  Just like there's radical liberals out there in the streets.
[00:57:18.454 --> 00:57:20.416]  I don't blame, I have liberal friends.
[00:57:20.436 --> 00:57:21.236]  They're not radical.
[00:57:21.276 --> 00:57:22.637]  They have a level head on their shoulder.
[00:57:22.878 --> 00:57:26.660]  They're just Democrats that like policies that are more liberal than a conservative policy.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.304]  Or like you have people at the pro-life march that aren't going to go blow up a Planned Parenthood clinic.
[00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:34.386]  You have extremists kind of in all groups.
[00:57:34.526 --> 00:57:37.489]  We have to be able to address that, you know, especially if they're
[00:57:38.169 --> 00:57:39.830]  Actually physically blowing people up.
[00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:59.640]  So and here's the interesting I went and I actually looked at the government policy on refugees which you can find at the government's website and basically the UN is in charge of the refugee program and the UNHCR decides what refugees will go where and it's funny because it mentions all the reason to be a refugee but none of the reasons is for welfare purposes.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.681]  That's something that's very important.
[00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:12.748]  Now, Donald Trump can kind of skirt around Congress, or skirt around all of this, by signing an executive order that would remove the United States from the UN.
[00:58:13.188 --> 00:58:18.650]  Which, by the way, the United States welcomes two-thirds of the world's refugees here into the United States.
[00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:20.030]  That's more than any other country.
[00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.731]  I think Donald Trump could remove the United States from the UN.
[00:58:23.051 --> 00:58:26.992]  That would take the refugee process back into our own hands.
[00:58:27.392 --> 00:58:31.976]  But I think it's time for Muslim leaders, American leaders to have this conversation, figure out the bottom of it.
[00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:40.182]  And Leanne, my final word in this is, I think the thing that would bring Muslims and Americans together is 9-11 truth.
[00:58:40.303 --> 00:58:41.664]  I think that will be a trump card.
[00:58:41.944 --> 00:58:43.225]  That is what can bring us all together.
[00:58:43.285 --> 00:58:46.848]  We find out the truth about what happened on 9-11 and everything else that has ensued.
[00:58:47.068 --> 00:58:52.653]  Yeah, which is why I don't understand why there isn't a ban on people coming from the countries that actually attacked us on 9-11.
[00:58:52.693 --> 00:58:53.714]  That doesn't make sense to me.
[00:58:53.774 --> 00:58:56.477]  I guess it's only if America has bombed you, you can't come in.
[00:58:56.857 --> 00:58:59.920]  Well, Owen, thank you so much, and thank you all for tuning in to the show tonight.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.541]  We'll see you here Monday, 7 p.m.
[00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:01.882]  Central.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.123]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
