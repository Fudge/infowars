[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.461]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:21.322]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.363]  It's Wednesday, March 22, 2017.
[00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.846]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:32.291]  Tonight, terror strikes London.
[00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:40.637]  Four people are dead in Westminster, including a police officer and the man believed to be behind the terrorist attack.
[00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:47.362]  InfoWars breaks down everything the mainstream media is not telling you about the attack.
[00:00:48.163 --> 00:01:04.790]  Then North Korea threatens war with the United States and then Kim Jong-un is humiliated as a missile explodes on his launch pad as North Korea attempts to show off their brute superior force.
[00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:16.382]  Reuters, the Associated Press and other Western media agencies are now reporting that the North Korean missile test might have been sabotaged by the U.S.
[00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:17.203]  military.
[00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:21.888]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.124 --> 00:03:05.525]  We have a lot on the docket tonight.
[00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:13.031]  We have terror, we have preparation for war, we have the tools of terror, the state tools of terror, and of course that's surveillance and censorship.
[00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:14.151]  All that is coming up tonight.
[00:03:14.692 --> 00:03:17.114]  Let's start with the London terror attack.
[00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:24.079]  The BBC is reporting that four people have died, including an armed officer and a man believed to have been the attacker.
[00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.223]  These people have died in a terrorist incident near the UK's Houses of Parliament.
[00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:33.466]  At least 20 people were injured, including three other police officers.
[00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:43.215]  Now they point out that this alleged assailant drove a car into pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge, which is very close to the Houses of Parliament, before crashing it, trying to enter the complex.
[00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:50.601]  Armed with a knife, he attacked a police officer, stabbed him, and then turned to run towards Houses of Parliament and was shot.
[00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.064]  They're saying that they believe there's only one attacker, but they have now locked down the area.
[00:03:55.584 --> 00:03:57.546]  Two of the victims are thought to have died on the bridge.
[00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:05.691]  They had three French students who were seriously injured on the bridge, as well as three police officers returning from a ceremony who were also injured on the bridge.
[00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:09.154]  One woman was rescued from the Thames with serious injuries.
[00:04:09.254 --> 00:04:11.516]  She apparently jumped or fell from the bridge.
[00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:16.110]  Now it's interesting to see how CNN immediately reported this.
[00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.720]  People reported that they'd heard shots fired, so CNN focused on the gun.
[00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:24.018]  Not on radical Islam.
[00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:29.220]  Of course, we have all the hallmarks of the MOs of radical Islamist attacks.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.762]  The running down of pedestrians with a vehicle, attacks with a knife or with an axe.
[00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:38.484]  The gun was actually used to stop the individual.
[00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:42.626]  But the headlines from CNN, as reported by Kit Daniels, captured this.
[00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:47.048]  CNN says this was a firearms incident near the parliament.
[00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:55.255]  Now, as they move on, and we've had other news outlets report that they thought that it was an Asian, said that he was armed with a stick.
[00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.317]  No, it was much more severe than that.
[00:04:57.357 --> 00:05:00.861]  It was an 8-inch knife, according to more detailed reports that have come out.
[00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:10.710]  And the official story, although nobody has been officially named, the unofficial reporting indicates that it was an Islamic hate preacher.
[00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:14.570]  Not an Asian with a stick, but an Islamic hate preacher.
[00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.831]  This is from Zero Hedge.
[00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:21.878]  They say a London terrorism suspect has been named unofficially as a hate preacher, Abu Izzedine.
[00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:29.225]  They say his Twitter account has now been suspended and he has unofficially been identified as the attacker.
[00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:36.775]  And of course, if you look at the picture, if you get a close-up look of that picture, you can see that this is somebody with an Islamic beard.
[00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:38.857]  He has a dark complexion.
[00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:40.139]  He is not Asian.
[00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.662]  Nothing about that narrative rang true.
[00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:47.649]  You just simply see mainstream media going out there with what they would like to be true.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.161]  We also see preparation for war in North Korea.
[00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:57.904]  And as reported by The Sun, this has resulted in humiliation yet again for Kim Jong Un.
[00:05:58.285 --> 00:06:00.786]  His rocket exploded seconds after launch.
[00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:04.427]  They say that he perhaps suffered stage fright.
[00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:09.790]  I would say that he suffered first stage fright from the aborted flight.
[00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.311]  And I guess we should extend
[00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:17.174]  Many saddenings for this extinguished gentleman, or this extinguished rocket, I guess.
[00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:19.776]  This dictator, whose plans have not worked out.
[00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:26.620]  And I don't know if it was his failure to launch, or if it was actually an attack.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.443]  We have an article on Infowars.com from Max Slavo saying, did the U.S.
[00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:36.706]  military infiltrate North Korean defense networks and take out their latest missile test?
[00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:39.007]  They said this did not go off normally.
[00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:48.811]  They said it was reported earlier by Zero Hedge earlier this month that the Obama administration was actively infiltrating North Korea's defense network and sabotaging their launches.
[00:06:48.871 --> 00:06:49.752]  Well, the U.S.
[00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:52.773]  government may have sabotaged those launches of Kim Jong-un.
[00:06:52.793 --> 00:06:53.714]  We hope that they did.
[00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.154]  Maybe they had an active role in that.
[00:06:55.194 --> 00:06:58.236]  But more concern to American citizens is what our U.S.
[00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:02.538]  government is doing to sabotage free speech with the surveillance state, with censorship.
[00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:09.143]  And of course we've been seeing this this last week with the testimony of FBI Director Comey on Capitol Hill.
[00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:24.234]  Even though we see multiple sources pouring cold water on the idea that Donald Trump would have been surveilled, and of course we know what former NSA, former CIA Director Michael Hayden said, we don't spy on bad people, we spy on interesting people.
[00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:39.432]  We now learn from House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes today, said that he learned while reviewing intelligence reports as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, he learned that Donald Trump's information had been collected.
[00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:42.395]  He said he finds this actually very alarming.
[00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.797]  He's notified House Speaker Paul Ryan.
[00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:45.678]  Well, it is alarming.
[00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:51.181]  And you should be alarmed as an American citizen as well by the surveillance state.
[00:07:51.361 --> 00:08:01.226]  And you should be alarmed by the fact that we have mainstream media as well as the FBI director pouring cold water on the idea that they would do wireless, warrantless searches on anyone.
[00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:02.586]  They're doing it on everyone!
[00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:04.567]  It's a very well-established fact.
[00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:05.688]  We've talked about this for years.
[00:08:05.728 --> 00:08:07.529]  We've had the Snowden documents.
[00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:08.249]  We've had Vault 7.
[00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:09.690]  And as that was happening,
[00:08:10.353 --> 00:08:18.055]  We had them come out with this absurd narrative mocking Donald Trump for saying that people were listening to him surveilling what he had to say.
[00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:21.516]  He knows that because he knows the information that has come out.
[00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:26.877]  He's run his own operations in terms of telling a limited number of people information.
[00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:28.738]  He knows that there's intelligence leaks but of course
[00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:34.020]  The FBI is not going to investigate the criminal leaks of information about General Flynn.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:43.604]  But at the same time today, we also learned that the Department of Justice found falsely planted malware at Trump Tower that was designed to mimic ties to Russia.
[00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:45.325]  So, think about this.
[00:08:46.087 --> 00:09:02.156]  We have a president-elect who is being monitored by the NSA, by other government agencies, and at the same time we find that there is malware planted on computers at Trump Tower to try to frame them to show that they have some connections to Russia.
[00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:08.640]  And understand, as we look at all of these allegations that there was Russian hacking
[00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.512]  Involved in terms of breaking into the DNC.
[00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:12.593]  I'm not sure that's true.
[00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:15.274]  We've had other people say these documents were handed to them.
[00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:27.921]  Personally, I had one individual, former UK ambassador, who said, I went to the US, I was handed these documents in the park, but then we have other people say, no, they were part of a hacking operation that went through there.
[00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:33.564]  Well, if that was true, we need to understand from this article that was put on Infowars.com, Steve Watson points out,
[00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:46.238]  That there's a CIA project identified by WikiLeaks as Umbridge that maintained a substantial library of Russian cyber attack techniques that were stolen from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.
[00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:57.584]  So when they say that we see Russian fingerprints on this, as John McAfee said earlier in the week, if you see these fingerprints, it is not the work of competent state intelligence.
[00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:05.350]  As a matter of fact, they would have to be so grossly incompetent, it's impossible to believe, not credible, that this would be state intelligence.
[00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.815]  But they maintain a library so they can mask their operations and appear to be coming from another country.
[00:10:12.475 --> 00:10:24.823]  And as John McAfee and other cyber security experts have pointed out, this so-called hacking software that was used was actually out of date, very old, not even a current rev of commonly available software.
[00:10:24.843 --> 00:10:27.545]  Not the kind of tools that you would see state intelligence use.
[00:10:27.965 --> 00:10:35.611]  But understand, at the same time we learn that Donald Trump is being surveilled and they say, oh, this was legal because it was done as part of FISA.
[00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:48.566]  We need to begin to pull this back, and we need to understand that it's not just ordinary citizens whose information is being collected, but the people who are at the most danger for this, as we've always said, have been the people who are in political power.
[00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:53.545]  People who are congressmen, people who are presidents, people who are political enemies.
[00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:56.547]  That is a real danger of the surveillance state.
[00:10:56.567 --> 00:10:58.409]  Yes, of course, it will be used against individuals.
[00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:02.052]  Yes, of course, they are monitoring your information.
[00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:06.916]  Not that you have anything to hide, not that they're going to come after you personally, but they want to know
[00:11:07.777 --> 00:11:09.498]  If their narrative is succeeding.
[00:11:10.058 --> 00:11:14.581]  They try to stop information coming from conservative sites or sites that are politically opposed to them.
[00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:22.225]  And they want to put out their information using the newly created Ministry of Truth that they stuck into the NDAA at the end of December.
[00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:30.009]  This so-called Center for Countering Disinformation and Propaganda is actually putting out disinformation and propaganda.
[00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:31.290]  How do they know if that's working?
[00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.570]  Well, they look at your metadata.
[00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:35.993]  That is the most important metric for them.
[00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:39.317]  They have to have feedback to know if their propaganda is working.
[00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:47.266]  So they fund and create the propaganda institution, but they also have to have this ability to get into your computers, all of us.
[00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.488]  So they can see if this is working.
[00:11:49.569 --> 00:12:05.523]  But for individuals like Donald Trump, for people who will oppose their political agenda, people like Rand Paul who are not going to buy into the neocon warmongering establishment and therefore immediately labeled as being allies of Vladimir Putin, for those people it is especially dangerous.
[00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:13.629]  And so our political leaders ought to be the first ones to realize this danger of the uncontrolled surveillance police state and shut it down.
[00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:15.410]  And we can see that that is happening now.
[00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.852]  Let me give you another example of how they're coming after InfoWars.
[00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:28.277]  Two days, actually yesterday, we put up a special report that I did, and it was an article, Saudi Arabia is now being sued by families of 9-11 attack.
[00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:32.307]  That was basically a fact-based article.
[00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:43.912]  Based on that title, Google sent us information and said, we've looked at the content in your video, or your video details, and we don't think they're very advertiser-friendly.
[00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.132]  As a result, your video cannot be monetized.
[00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:47.993]  Real close to being censored.
[00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:54.876]  But censored in a way that they want to defund any news organizations that are opposed to their official agenda.
[00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:56.837]  We need to understand what's going on here.
[00:12:57.737 --> 00:13:00.778]  Any discussion of terror, they say, well you can't talk about 9-11.
[00:13:01.118 --> 00:13:04.139]  We're going to put that on the back burner.
[00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:13.242]  If we look at a story that just came out yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google is stepping up efforts to keep ads away from controversial content.
[00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:14.442]  That would be what this is.
[00:13:15.103 --> 00:13:19.544]  If we go back to January the 26th, 2017, we see another article from Wall Street Journal.
[00:13:19.824 --> 00:13:22.245]  Could be almost exactly the same headline.
[00:13:22.565 --> 00:13:25.586]  Google steps up efforts to stop fake news.
[00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:29.648]  So in January they were stepping up efforts to stop fake news.
[00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:33.310]  Now they're stepping up efforts to keep ads away that are controversial.
[00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:36.993]  So in other words, let's just put this all under one umbrella article.
[00:13:37.553 --> 00:13:38.814]  Maybe the Wall Street Journal will run it.
[00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:44.457]  Google steps up efforts to shut down free speech and free press because that's what this amounts to.
[00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:46.499]  You have to understand that
[00:13:47.475 --> 00:13:54.179]  They want to, when they step up these efforts to stop fake news, they will be the arbiters of what is fake and what isn't.
[00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:56.840]  They will be the arbiters of what is controversial and what isn't.
[00:13:57.481 --> 00:14:00.863]  And we'll put up this article about Saudi Arabia now being sued.
[00:14:01.443 --> 00:14:06.526]  This is the government's official story that Saudi Arabian sponsored terrorists
[00:14:07.773 --> 00:14:08.233]  We're good to go.
[00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:31.652]  Then the victims ought to be able to get compensation for that, to try to keep that from happening.
[00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:38.017]  They hid those pages for 15 years until Donald Trump said, I want to see those redacted pages.
[00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:45.002]  We had senators, people who were on the 9-11 Commission said, we need to show people what's been censored in these missing 28 pages.
[00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:47.524]  They could not get that to happen.
[00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:49.065]  Donald Trump was able to get that to happen.
[00:14:49.665 --> 00:15:02.773]  And as a result of that, even though Obama tried to veto a bill that would allow these people to get compensation from the very individuals and the state that their report said had created this 9-11 terrorist act,
[00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:06.777]  It was overridden by the Congress, and so now these people are able to sue.
[00:15:06.817 --> 00:15:13.240]  They've already gone through and started identifying a money trail going from the Saudi Arabian government to these individuals.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.883]  And understand, the Saudi Arabian government is joined at the hip with the CIA.
[00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:22.585]  It's difficult to understand where the Saudis began and where the U.S.
[00:15:22.646 --> 00:15:23.786]  government and the CIA end.
[00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:28.228]  They are basically a distinction without a difference.
[00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:34.351]  We've been allied like that since we went off the gold standard and used them to prop up the petrodollar.
[00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:36.612]  So it's very important that we do this investigation.
[00:15:36.652 --> 00:15:38.573]  It's very important that we explore these ties.
[00:15:39.113 --> 00:15:51.179]  But even to talk about the fact that there is a lawsuit now that has been authorized is something that will get you, if not completely censored, it will get you demonetized by Google.
[00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:52.520]  That is the danger.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.180]  And that's what we see happening.
[00:15:54.221 --> 00:16:06.206]  If we look at Google's stepping up efforts to move away from controversial content, we have talked about how Google's surrogate has said we're not going to be allowed to put our ads on other people's websites.
[00:16:07.287 --> 00:16:08.368]  Because we're InfoWars.
[00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:12.289]  And even though our ads are not about political content, they censor it on that end.
[00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:24.335]  Now they're going in the other direction and they're saying, if you have a site like Daily Caller or Breitbart or InfoWars, you cannot have ads served to you because you are a controversial site.
[00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:25.535]  Who is driving this?
[00:16:25.616 --> 00:16:29.757]  Well, Wall Street Journal reported that it is being driven by HSBC.
[00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:41.237]  HSBC, the people who have been convicted multiple times by the US government for money laundering, for drug cartels, and terrorist organizations.
[00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:48.379]  These people are now saying, we don't want to talk about terrorism, we don't want to talk about controversial things, and we want to shut people down.
[00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:56.262]  What they want to shut down is the ability to fund independent news organizations that will report on what HSBC is doing.
[00:16:56.602 --> 00:16:58.162]  That will report on what Google is doing.
[00:16:58.502 --> 00:17:00.023]  That is what is truly behind this.
[00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:11.865]  Now another example of how they have spun the narrative, and we saw this at the very beginning of how CNN was immediately spinning the narrative of the London terror attack to blame guns rather than radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:17:12.486 --> 00:17:16.532]  We see today that the story that is being floated around is an attack saying that
[00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:23.259]  Paul Manafort is a puppet of Putin, that he has ties to Vladimir Putin.
[00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:42.865]  They're going back 10 years to work that he did on behalf of a Russian billionaire who has ties, who is a friend of Vladimir Putin, but they are ignoring the ties and have continued to ignore the ties of Podesta, John Podesta, who was campaign chair for Hillary Clinton the entire time.
[00:17:43.385 --> 00:18:03.365]  Who had been Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton's White House, who has worked as a lawyer for the Obama White House, and in 2014 when he joined the Obama White House, he did not disclose his financial ties to a Russian state-run company that was founded by Vladimir Putin.
[00:18:03.965 --> 00:18:08.948]  And he has made, arguably, a lot more money out of this than Paul Manafort has.
[00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:12.511]  His ties and connections are more current than Paul Manafort's.
[00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:14.692]  That is the double standard that we see.
[00:18:14.992 --> 00:18:15.873]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:18:15.893 --> 00:18:19.095]  We're going to talk about Obamacare and more information about this terror attack.
[00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:41.535]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:43.937]  You better believe you got one!
[00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:02.710]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.360]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.527]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.827 --> 00:23:00.749]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.205 --> 00:23:09.348]  I have a lot in common with the president that we both ran on repealing Obamacare.
[00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:16.472]  Conservatives across the country, we won in 2010, 2014, and again in 2016 on repealing Obamacare.
[00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:18.113]  So I think that brings us all together.
[00:23:18.133 --> 00:23:21.835]  And I think Paul Ryan's plan, one, won't fix the problems.
[00:23:21.955 --> 00:23:25.958]  I think it will continue to allow the insurance premiums to skyrocket.
[00:23:26.618 --> 00:23:29.119]  And I just don't think it really fixes the problems.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.862]  And we didn't run on replacing Obamacare with Obamacare Light.
[00:23:33.242 --> 00:23:34.923]  So I'm a no vote and we'll continue to
[00:23:36.324 --> 00:23:43.546]  And of course that was Senator Rand Paul being very vocal continuing his campaign of opposition to what he's calling Obamacare lite.
[00:23:43.946 --> 00:23:44.927]  He's absolutely right.
[00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:53.090]  Millions of Americans across the country voted for a majority Republican ticket based on the promise of an Obamacare repeal.
[00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.630]  And this is their big chance.
[00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.432]  They've got the president, Republican president there, and they're in control.
[00:23:58.992 --> 00:24:11.822]  Of both houses, and it's time to do something and actually make a mark that's going to let the American people know that they're listening, they're paying attention, and they're not just going to keep selling them down the road, kicking the can down the street, what have you.
[00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:16.425]  So just to let you know what a struggle this is to overhaul Obamacare.
[00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:18.246]  It's being dubbed Obamacare lite.
[00:24:18.647 --> 00:24:25.972]  They are, they're rushing through to try to ram this and make a big move here in these, you know,
[00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:26.793]  I don't know.
[00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:56.460]  So late Monday night, leadership staff released the 22-page technical amendment, and in their haste, they introduced language that could keep as many as 7 million veterans from participating in the GOP health care plan.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:09.049]  Now, the Washington Examiner is reporting that under the original bill, service members could receive tax credits from the government so long as they were not enrolled already in the Veterans Affairs program.
[00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:12.151]  So they were eligible for both, but they had to choose one.
[00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:13.972]  Basically, they could not double dip.
[00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:32.247]  But now they are this is you know the language that kind of said you can you're eligible for both but you've got to choose that has been struck from the bill now retired service members qualify only if they are not eligible for another any other type of government health care.
[00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:33.267]  Wow!
[00:25:33.588 --> 00:25:42.956]  So this is basically with this new language it can force millions of veterans to rely on the VA for their health care whether they want it or not.
[00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:46.679]  That is absolutely ridiculous, totally unacceptable.
[00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:50.362]  Donald Trump has made no bones about the VA system.
[00:25:50.422 --> 00:25:52.524]  He called it absolutely unacceptable.
[00:25:52.864 --> 00:25:59.470]  So now in your haste you're going to force millions of veterans to have to go to the VA before it's even been overhauled.
[00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.091]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:06.176]  We hear way too many horror stories of what veterans are dealing with when they try to go to the VA.
[00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:11.380]  We're going to be interviewing some veterans this week to talk to us a little bit about just that, what they are facing.
[00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:17.886]  You know, and this is something that the veterans have experienced before when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law.
[00:26:17.946 --> 00:26:23.731]  Initially, service members and veterans were susceptible to the penalties for violating the individual mandate.
[00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:27.674]  And that wasn't even fixed until Republicans had to force a vote on exempting them.
[00:26:28.015 --> 00:26:33.760]  So hopefully Republicans are likely going to correct this little issue in the House Rules Committee or on the floor.
[00:26:34.181 --> 00:26:49.114]  But while we've got all of that going on, while our veterans are going to be forced to not be able to qualify for this if they qualify for government health care, illegal immigrants might be able to gain access to federal health care insurance coverage.
[00:26:50.135 --> 00:27:00.277]  Ah, that's because a provision that would have allowed the Treasury Department to access data at the Department of Homeland Security to verify that health care tax credits went only to U.S.
[00:27:00.317 --> 00:27:06.478]  citizens and legal permanent residents, not to illegal immigrants, has been dropped from the bill.
[00:27:06.498 --> 00:27:17.200]  And it was dropped after the Senate parliamentarian determined that the committee that handles the tax credits under the bill doesn't have purview over the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.542]  So, Republican Representative Lou Barletta actually said he could no longer support the bill citing this obscure provision.
[00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:32.865]  He said the bill lacks sufficient safeguards to verify whether or not an individual applying for this health care can do it, whether they're legally allowed to do so.
[00:27:32.925 --> 00:27:40.928]  So, once again, we are seeing how our veterans are getting the shaft while people who are here to gain the system are going to access health care.
[00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:43.249]  Let's take a listen to Rand Paul's prediction.
[00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:55.055]  I think there are enough conservatives in the House to bring this to a halt, and my prediction is that Ryan will pull the bill within the next 24 hours, or he'll take a vote and he'll lose.
[00:27:55.596 --> 00:28:06.884]  At that point, conservatives will have earned a seat at the table, and then we can negotiate on a real repeal, and we should replace it with market forces that bring the price of insurance down.
[00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:21.459]  Mr. Armstrong, you'd mentioned in your answer to, I think, Ms.
[00:28:21.479 --> 00:28:25.561]  Spears' question that there are other RTs operating in the U.S.?
[00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:30.265]  I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:28:31.366 --> 00:28:32.486]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:28:32.506 --> 00:28:39.571]  And now, secret.
[00:28:39.611 --> 00:28:40.952]  To playing a Russian agent.
[00:28:46.298 --> 00:28:46.718]  Russian.
[00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:51.579]  I must warn you, nobody pulls off playing Russian better than me.
[00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:53.900]  If you got the guts to try, you show me, comrade.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.400]  See how good I am?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.461]  His last job was fixing office copiers.
[00:29:00.261 --> 00:29:02.082]  I believe we found our decoys.
[00:29:03.182 --> 00:29:04.022]  He's good with hardware.
[00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.562]  He's got some Russian.
[00:29:06.282 --> 00:29:08.083]  One's got basic diplomacy skills.
[00:29:11.092 --> 00:29:12.312]  I will not let you down.
[00:29:12.452 --> 00:29:15.353]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:17.313]  And I think... Stand back!
[00:29:17.353 --> 00:29:17.913]  Leave the room!
[00:29:18.774 --> 00:29:19.054]  Well?
[00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.495]  We're bucking you right up front to gathering.
[00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:27.795]  We've got a very special assignment for you two.
[00:29:28.575 --> 00:29:29.336]  Foreign service?
[00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:30.036]  Yes.
[00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:31.616]  Undercover work?
[00:29:32.196 --> 00:29:32.436]  Yes.
[00:29:34.217 --> 00:29:36.137]  These guys are KGB special branch.
[00:29:37.737 --> 00:29:38.017]  Come on.
[00:29:38.338 --> 00:29:39.239]  Don't tell me to come on.
[00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.340]  That was a Russian wristwatch.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.683]  I know the country of origin of every timepiece in the world.
[00:29:42.923 --> 00:29:45.606]  That was a Russian copy of a 1969 Timex digital.
[00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:47.328]  K.A.
[00:29:47.528 --> 00:29:48.309]  Cold War legend.
[00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:53.375]  Highly trained Russian sleeper agents inserted into American society to sabotage.
[00:29:53.475 --> 00:29:54.196]  Supposedly.
[00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:55.650]  What's the matter, Ted?
[00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.490]  You don't believe in moles?
[00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.032]  Oh, I believe in moles, all right.
[00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:02.215]  The one link is an average American kid... Let's take a ride.
[00:30:02.636 --> 00:30:04.998]  ...who's about to find out... Am I under arrest?
[00:30:05.338 --> 00:30:07.520]  ...his entire life is a lie.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.861]  Your parents are Russian spies.
[00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.002]  KGB agents.
[00:30:10.383 --> 00:30:11.263]  Sleepers, they're called.
[00:30:11.384 --> 00:30:11.844]  Deep cover.
[00:30:12.224 --> 00:30:13.145]  Are my parents spies?
[00:30:13.225 --> 00:30:14.626]  Are my parents my parents?
[00:30:14.686 --> 00:30:16.268]  Who am I, for God's sake?
[00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:17.729]  Your moment has come.
[00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:21.813]  It's been worked on here and in Russia on and off for over eight years.
[00:30:22.836 --> 00:30:24.757]  Those microphones and those cameras.
[00:30:25.218 --> 00:30:26.599]  Fighting off anyone who tries to help him.
[00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.341]  Defending America, even if it means his own death.
[00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:33.744]  Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria.
[00:30:34.204 --> 00:30:39.468]  To sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy.
[00:30:39.488 --> 00:30:42.770]  You know, this is very important.
[00:30:43.396 --> 00:30:47.260]  I mean, if you ask me what I'm most scared about, I would say the Russia thing.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:53.025]  If you can't get behind opposing that, you are not a patriot and you are certainly not a good American.
[00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:54.927]  Russian scum!
[00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:56.349]  You got all that?
[00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:05.013]  You made me laugh.
[00:31:05.033 --> 00:31:05.433]  God bless you.
[00:31:05.493 --> 00:31:07.874]  It's the end of the working day, so it's time to go to bed.
[00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:08.694]  I'll go home in a good mood.
[00:31:08.774 --> 00:31:11.455]  The Union is an indestructible, indestructible,
[00:31:29.224 --> 00:31:34.005]  The criminal multinational elements that have hijacked our republic are in full panic mode.
[00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:39.247]  Donald J. Trump has led the American people in the first stages of restoring our republic.
[00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:47.750]  Now they're launching the bizarre conspiracy theory with no proof, claiming that Trump and his legions of supporters are either Russian agents or they're Dukes.
[00:31:48.530 --> 00:32:06.767]  While the trillion pound elephant in the living room is the fact that Hillary Clinton publicly got illegal money from the Communist Chinese, Saudi Arabia, and scores of other nations directly to Super PACs and her campaign, not to mention her admittedly illegal foundation.
[00:32:07.248 --> 00:32:11.452]  It was Hillary that got $35 million to hand over our uranium to Russia.
[00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:12.853]  Not Donald Trump.
[00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:28.660]  That's why it's imperative that President-elect Trump get on the offense now with the truth that it's Hillary, the Democrats, and the MSM that are in league with the foreign powers of globalism to bring our country down and destroy our sovereignty.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.683]  They have done, in spades, what they accuse Donald J. Trump of.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:12.607]  Breitbart and Infowars under investigation for ties to Russia.
[00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:13.548]  Report!
[00:37:13.888 --> 00:37:20.430]  That's right, Stephen Bannon trying to cut middle class taxes, rebuild our military, and defend our borders and get the VA working right.
[00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:24.832]  As well as kill Obamacare, decorated Navy officer.
[00:37:25.432 --> 00:37:34.316]  Can't trust him, can't trust anybody, but we can trust Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and John Podesta and Michael Moore, can't we?
[00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:38.177]  We need to reduce the deficit because, and so therefore we must cut
[00:37:38.743 --> 00:37:47.709]  Education, that is a stupid, a common, a moment of, what?
[00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:57.716]  A moment of comedy, of comedy, of goodwill, but this budget is really a slap in the face of the future.
[00:37:57.736 --> 00:38:01.158]  Barack Obama Day will not be celebrated in the former president's home state.
[00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:07.783]  Lawmakers in Illinois voting down the proposal to honor his birthday as a state holiday on August 4th.
[00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:14.368]  I would just add, this should be of concern to everyone that the Russians are trying to influence our election.
[00:38:14.408 --> 00:38:20.332]  But I'll answer your question directly, which is, as she said all throughout this campaign, she will crack down on Wall Street.
[00:38:20.913 --> 00:38:27.658]  She said it to, there's nothing that she hasn't said in private that she doesn't say in public.
[00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.111]  And this, you see, has been built up for months.
[00:38:52.072 --> 00:38:55.374]  At first, when they came out and said, oh, the Russians stole the election, it'd be too much.
[00:38:55.414 --> 00:38:59.477]  But I told you, they were going to build it and build it until they say that
[00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.371]  Breitbart's Russian.
[00:39:01.551 --> 00:39:02.913]  Stephen Bannon's Russian.
[00:39:03.473 --> 00:39:04.855]  I'm Russian and Trump's Russian.
[00:39:06.196 --> 00:39:12.883]  And if Trump and his people don't counter-strike when Hillary is openly on the Communist Chinese payroll, sold 30% of our uranium,
[00:39:15.765 --> 00:39:18.547]  To Russia, got all these tens of millions for it.
[00:39:19.267 --> 00:39:23.129]  And if they don't start the indictments of the open crimes they've committed, they're not going to stop.
[00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:28.192]  This company, Uranium One, had outposts in the U.S.
[00:39:28.372 --> 00:39:29.493]  in uranium mines.
[00:39:29.913 --> 00:39:38.378]  So they were essentially bargaining to sell their company to the Russians so the Russians could, in part, control U.S.
[00:39:38.518 --> 00:39:39.999]  uranium production.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.842]  And in order for that deal to be signed off on,
[00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:56.226]  One of the federal agencies of the United States that had to okay it because this is national security is the State Department, then headed up by Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:57.266 --> 00:39:58.107]  It's undisputed.
[00:39:58.127 --> 00:40:00.028]  Even the precious New York Times admits that.
[00:40:00.088 --> 00:40:01.689]  So what's the big story here?
[00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:06.893]  The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases.
[00:40:08.637 --> 00:40:16.263]  First, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S.
[00:40:16.303 --> 00:40:18.384]  citizens involved in the Trump transition.
[00:40:19.805 --> 00:40:20.866]  Details about U.S.
[00:40:20.906 --> 00:40:33.555]  persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, the House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate surveillance and its subsequent dissemination.
[00:40:34.296 --> 00:40:35.097]  Who was aware of it?
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:51.123]  Why it was not disclosed to Congress, who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, and whether any laws, regulations, or procedures were violated.
[00:40:52.343 --> 00:40:53.664]  And the globalists are the traitors.
[00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:58.084]  They're the outside group that has come in and taken over the country.
[00:40:58.184 --> 00:41:04.986]  And here we are, not just in the United States, but worldwide saying kick the oligarchs out, kick the globalists out, and to claim it's
[00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:11.893]  Russia is the most ridiculous thing on earth, but they don't care.
[00:41:12.433 --> 00:41:21.977]  Once it's discovered to be elite, unelected, above the law, tax-exempt, diplomatically immune, totally corrupt, the new royalty, we reject Kim Jong-un.
[00:41:22.358 --> 00:41:24.298]  We reject Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:28.460]  We reject George Soros and the new royalty at the UN.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.101]  We're done.
[00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:47.022]  We are back live.
[00:41:47.062 --> 00:41:50.785]  Thank you so much for joining us in this second hour of the Sunday broadcast.
[00:41:50.805 --> 00:41:56.869]  We're joined by investigative journalist, three times number one New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.733]  Credited with winning one election for the Republicans and helping win three others.
[00:42:02.234 --> 00:42:06.777]  And of course he formerly worked with the State Department and other areas and of course has several degrees.
[00:42:07.257 --> 00:42:09.920]  One from Harvard dealing with international banking and finance.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.402]  He's an expert on so many fronts.
[00:42:13.242 --> 00:42:19.848]  He's published an article today that I wanted to wait until tomorrow to put out because I wanted to add some of the other breaking news to it.
[00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:26.454]  But Markel Thelen, as we speak, is adding some of the other backup documentation.
[00:42:26.474 --> 00:42:27.355]  I mean, this is proven.
[00:42:27.395 --> 00:42:28.957]  This is extremely credible.
[00:42:30.325 --> 00:42:31.085]  Everybody forgets.
[00:42:31.165 --> 00:42:36.948]  They admit that the DEA, the FBI has accessed the NSA database and is spying on Americans domestically.
[00:42:36.968 --> 00:42:38.168]  They've had congressional hearings.
[00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.329]  It's been in hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:48.633]  But I wanted to remind the public that this parallel construction is going on where they use the NSA spy systems to look at Americans.
[00:42:48.653 --> 00:42:57.177]  Then they go and formulate investigations after they have the data from the NSA and go to the courts, claiming other evidence, many times fake, to be able to then get the indictments.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:06.629]  So if you want to pull that up, just type in parallel construction and you'll get Reuters, Associated Press, you name it, dealing with it.
[00:43:06.649 --> 00:43:07.650]  But here's some of the headlines.
[00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:12.275]  Dragnet NSA spying survives 2015 review.
[00:43:12.896 --> 00:43:20.443]  And that is a giant illegal domestic spy grid, Electronic Frontier Foundation, going on for at least a decade plus.
[00:43:21.204 --> 00:43:22.826]  So, several years of George W. Bush.
[00:43:22.846 --> 00:43:23.746]  There it is in Reuters.
[00:43:24.287 --> 00:43:24.587]  U.S.
[00:43:24.627 --> 00:43:28.190]  directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans illegally.
[00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:29.291]  That's Reuters.
[00:43:30.214 --> 00:43:31.435]  NSA files decoded.
[00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.096]  London Guardian.
[00:43:32.136 --> 00:43:33.257]  Edward Snowden surveillance.
[00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:34.938]  Revelations explained.
[00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:38.321]  Confirmed by public documents and congressional inquiries.
[00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:40.964]  Again, the Senate spied on.
[00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:42.625]  Just on budgetary.
[00:43:42.665 --> 00:43:43.927]  What are they planning to do with the CIA?
[00:43:44.187 --> 00:43:45.348]  The CIA spied on them.
[00:43:45.388 --> 00:43:48.811]  Not as Chinese spies or anything else, but what are they going to do with our budget?
[00:43:49.412 --> 00:43:50.633]  So, illegally doing that.
[00:43:50.673 --> 00:43:52.614]  That's the New York Times.
[00:43:53.395 --> 00:43:54.016]  Here's another one.
[00:43:55.477 --> 00:43:56.258]  Dealing with all of this.
[00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:58.070]  U.S.
[00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.511]  directs agents to cover up program.
[00:44:00.172 --> 00:44:01.392]  So it's all right there.
[00:44:02.713 --> 00:44:10.078]  Now, we know that Dragnet exists, did exist, and Electronic Frontier Foundation says at least up to 2016 it's still ongoing.
[00:44:10.798 --> 00:44:12.600]  That's a very respective nonpartisan group.
[00:44:15.101 --> 00:44:20.365]  But now, we have our law enforcement sources, and we're very careful about this because
[00:44:21.636 --> 00:44:23.737]  I don't just do this as a matter of protecting myself.
[00:44:24.677 --> 00:44:35.761]  I have law enforcement sources and others, and then I have investigative journalists who have long histories of doing this for decades, like Corsi, who now works for InfoWorks, setting up her Washington Bureau, who know how to do it legally and lawfully.
[00:44:36.141 --> 00:44:45.704]  Because let me tell you, I've talked to lawyers, I've talked to others, when I got secret FBI manuals and other things, and I had family that had been in intelligence agencies say, you're lucky you're alive, man.
[00:44:46.613 --> 00:44:52.718]  You know, the stuff about veterans are the number one enemy, there's a national gun confiscation plan, all that stuff nobody believed for a week when we broke it.
[00:44:52.738 --> 00:45:06.568]  The MIAC report, remember the veterans are the terrorists, and then Napolitano, Janet Napolitano, the bad Napolitano, not Judge Napolitano, came out and said, oh yes, we are saying that veterans are the number one enemy.
[00:45:06.588 --> 00:45:07.389]  That's a real manual.
[00:45:07.769 --> 00:45:09.351]  Well, this is bigger than that, okay?
[00:45:09.371 --> 00:45:10.792]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:12.654 --> 00:45:20.322]  NSA database documents NSA electronic surveillance of Donald Trump in Trump Tower in Alex Jones in Texas.
[00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:24.467]  And it goes through it and has screenshots of the real documents.
[00:45:25.677 --> 00:45:31.198]  But the phone numbers are X'd out, and that's done in the database until you get authorization to get into it.
[00:45:31.218 --> 00:45:33.139]  You have to have secret clearance to get into it.
[00:45:33.659 --> 00:45:40.100]  But when state police and federal law enforcement want it, they've got to get authorization from special boards that are very shadowy to get into it.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.020]  Then it unlocks it all.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.381]  But I know these phone numbers.
[00:45:42.401 --> 00:45:43.021]  I've called Trump.
[00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:44.001]  He's called me on these numbers.
[00:45:45.021 --> 00:45:45.441]  It's all right.
[00:45:45.461 --> 00:45:46.442]  Of course, Trump's the president.
[00:45:46.462 --> 00:45:49.082]  He knows way more than this when he says he knows he's been surveilled.
[00:45:49.342 --> 00:45:51.983]  Well, it turns out he's been surveilled by Obama and even before.
[00:45:52.523 --> 00:45:53.424]  So this is huge.
[00:45:54.004 --> 00:45:56.045]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:45:56.605 --> 00:45:58.987]  We're updating the article and adding new documentation as it goes.
[00:45:59.747 --> 00:46:01.368]  So if you've already been looking at it, hit refresh.
[00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:02.929]  Let's go to Dr. Corsi.
[00:46:02.949 --> 00:46:04.030]  We've got five minutes until break.
[00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.530]  We'll come back.
[00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:09.553]  We have the detective with the cold case posse with the outgoing sheriff in Maricopa County.
[00:46:09.853 --> 00:46:13.275]  Sheriff O'Pio has been bravely involved in all this as well.
[00:46:13.915 --> 00:46:16.497]  So give us a boil down of how big this is, Dr. Corsi.
[00:46:17.317 --> 00:46:20.139]  Well, this is a tremendous find.
[00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:28.094]  Mike Zulu and Sheriff Arpaio had project database records they got from a whistleblower.
[00:46:28.554 --> 00:46:29.555]  They've been proving them out.
[00:46:29.575 --> 00:46:30.335]  They've had them since 2013.
[00:46:30.475 --> 00:46:40.800]  Now, it was really over the past week when I started talking with Mike Zulu and we found, we realized that Donald Trump was in this database.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.582]  He searched for it and we're posting it on InfoWars right now.
[00:46:45.922 --> 00:46:47.783]  Donald Trump has been wiretapped.
[00:46:47.983 --> 00:46:48.984]  Electronic surveillance.
[00:46:50.523 --> 00:46:51.243]  All over the place.
[00:46:51.924 --> 00:46:59.570]  Certainly Trump Tower, but also Mar-a-Lago, various companies that he's owned, golf courses.
[00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.492]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:59.054]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.074 --> 00:48:59.955]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:00.015]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:09.615]  We know we're getting surveilled, but my goodness, in there with Donald Trump.
[00:49:09.835 --> 00:49:11.096]  But see, they know who to watch, folks.
[00:49:11.116 --> 00:49:12.217]  They know who the patriots are.
[00:49:12.778 --> 00:49:14.499]  So let's go ahead and go to this report.
[00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:15.200]  They don't want you to see.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.343]  By the way, this got censored off Facebook when he was first interviewed by RT.
[00:49:19.543 --> 00:49:19.844]  Here it is.
[00:49:20.663 --> 00:49:39.056]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:43.879]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[00:49:53.345 --> 00:49:57.908]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:03.852]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:50:04.052 --> 00:50:20.424]  The real fundamental thing that ought to alarm all Americans, regardless of their political party, their political affiliation, is what has been going on with former leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency and in the director of National Intelligence Agency's office.
[00:50:21.264 --> 00:50:25.247]  Is direct interference in the domestic politics.
[00:50:25.767 --> 00:50:28.408]  If we're going to talk about Russian meddling in U.S.
[00:50:28.468 --> 00:50:36.173]  politics, then it needs to be acknowledged that these intelligence agencies or the principals at the top were involved with meddling.
[00:50:36.694 --> 00:50:39.635]  Now, do I have first-hand knowledge that John Brennan was doing this?
[00:50:39.695 --> 00:50:40.236]  No, I do not.
[00:50:41.561 --> 00:50:49.707]  I have been told, though, by someone who is in a position to know, who's still within the intelligence community, that absolutely that's what was going on.
[00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:56.972]  That Brennan, and that there are shenanigans going on between the GHCQ and U.S.
[00:50:56.992 --> 00:50:57.512]  intelligence.
[00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:58.653]  How does that work?
[00:50:59.113 --> 00:51:10.421]  Your listeners should understand that it is illegal without some warrant for any of the intelligence or law enforcement agencies to collect on American citizens.
[00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:21.112]  It is not illegal for the British, through their version of NSA, to collect on American citizens because we're foreigners as far as they're concerned and we're a legitimate target.
[00:51:21.833 --> 00:51:29.201]  Similarly, the United States can freely collect on any British citizen because they're not Americans.
[00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:30.983]  They don't have the constitutional protection.
[00:51:31.023 --> 00:51:32.245]  We all spy on each other then.
[00:51:32.947 --> 00:51:47.776]  Yeah, I mean, you know, if anybody's so naive as to think that the Brits aren't spying on Americans and Americans aren't spying on Brits, well, you know, I hate to burst your bubble, but the reality is that's what spy agencies do.
[00:51:48.197 --> 00:51:51.539]  They collect and gather intelligence on other entities.
[00:51:51.559 --> 00:51:52.499]  That's one of their purposes.
[00:51:52.519 --> 00:51:59.324]  Well, remember the scandal just four years ago where the CIA was spying on Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, the Intelligence Committee heads.
[00:52:00.014 --> 00:52:08.643]  Right, well and that was, you know, John Brennan, again, had his fingerprints all over that because they didn't want the information about the torture report to come out.
[00:52:09.324 --> 00:52:15.591]  And Brennan initially denied that that was going on and then later had to admit that it had in fact happened.
[00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:19.976]  So, it's not, you know, we're not raising these allegations without precedent.
[00:52:20.356 --> 00:52:31.841]  Director Brennan, in 2014 the CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, including the emails of Senate staff investigating the CIA's use of torture.
[00:52:32.521 --> 00:52:47.588]  The CIA Inspector General later stated that the search involved improper agency access to Senate files, and a review board that you appointed concluded that the search resulted in inappropriate access to the committee's work product.
[00:52:47.808 --> 00:53:02.513]  Senior officials from the NSA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have all testified that it would be inappropriate for their agencies to secretly search Senate files without external authorization.
[00:53:03.073 --> 00:53:10.856]  Would you agree that the CIA's 2014 search of Senate files was improper?
[00:53:11.576 --> 00:53:23.869]  The actions of the CIA were reasonable, given the very unclear and unwritten or unspecific understanding between the committee and CIA at the time.
[00:53:24.089 --> 00:53:26.972]  The exact words of the review board were...
[00:53:27.572 --> 00:53:32.755]  It resulted in inappropriate access to SSCI's work product.
[00:53:33.136 --> 00:53:36.337]  And your Inspector General reached the same conclusion.
[00:53:36.377 --> 00:53:41.921]  And so, that undermines the very checks and balances that protect our democracy.
[00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:44.502]  And it's unacceptable in a free society.
[00:53:44.923 --> 00:53:49.165]  And your compatriots in all of the sister agencies agreed with that.
[00:53:49.265 --> 00:53:50.206]  Now, you disagree?
[00:53:50.586 --> 00:53:54.067]  Yes, I think you've mischaracterized both their comments as well as what's in those reports.
[00:53:54.307 --> 00:53:57.408]  Do not say that we spied on Senate computers or your files.
[00:53:57.448 --> 00:53:58.208]  We did not do that.
[00:53:58.528 --> 00:54:00.149]  We were fulfilling our responsibilities.
[00:54:00.509 --> 00:54:10.111]  My concern here is that involving intelligence agencies in domestic politics takes us down a very, very dangerous road.
[00:54:10.491 --> 00:54:18.013]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:54:19.394 --> 00:54:19.734]  No, sir.
[00:54:21.269 --> 00:54:21.769]  It does not.
[00:54:23.689 --> 00:54:24.510]  Not wittingly.
[00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:32.391]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:54:33.051 --> 00:54:36.772]  But I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone.
[00:54:36.792 --> 00:54:41.813]  He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution.
[00:54:42.193 --> 00:54:48.214]  And he believes that when James Clapper came in March, our National Director of Intelligence, came and lied,
[00:54:48.934 --> 00:54:52.656]  That he was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying.
[00:54:53.016 --> 00:55:05.100]  And this is a big concern of mine because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they come and talk to us because they have now admitted that they will lie to us if they think it's in the name of national security.
[00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:14.105]  Uh, this New York Times writer, I want to play a short clip where he claims Trump got the idea from me that there was wiretapping.
[00:55:14.165 --> 00:55:16.025]  No, it was in the New York Times.
[00:55:16.045 --> 00:55:21.928]  I mean, I've never seen such attempts at just bizarre, you know, the sun isn't in the sky at noon.
[00:55:21.948 --> 00:55:26.631]  I don't know as a CIA guy what you'd call this, but it's just like the worst gaslighting I've ever seen.
[00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:27.251]  Let's play this clip.
[00:55:28.311 --> 00:55:33.315]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[00:55:34.136 --> 00:55:41.883]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point because we've said it very clearly, and I said on your show, that that's not what the story said.
[00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.966]  Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[00:55:44.986 --> 00:55:54.014]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on this kind of fringe right-wing media.
[00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:58.779]  There it is, there's the, there it is, Fringewire, and he wrote an article the day before!
[00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:05.762]  And after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:56:06.242 --> 00:56:11.504]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:56:11.564 --> 00:56:18.287]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[00:56:18.647 --> 00:56:30.925]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:31.886]  Nothing.
[00:56:31.926 --> 00:56:34.209]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[00:56:35.168 --> 00:56:36.869]  That's a fantastic story.
[00:56:37.509 --> 00:56:38.830]  It was all over CNN everywhere.
[00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:39.630]  We have the intercepts.
[00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:40.671]  We've caught General Flynn.
[00:56:40.891 --> 00:56:41.732]  He better resign.
[00:56:41.772 --> 00:56:42.672]  We have the transcript.
[00:56:42.912 --> 00:56:44.593]  Then they wouldn't release it because there was nothing there.
[00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:46.134]  He was lining up a phone call.
[00:56:46.414 --> 00:56:48.435]  We're showing you the articles of your radio listener.
[00:56:48.775 --> 00:56:50.576]  Intercept Russian communications.
[00:56:51.177 --> 00:56:52.777]  Part of inquiry into Trump.
[00:56:53.138 --> 00:56:56.880]  Matthew Rosenberg and phone calls from Trump Tower being intercepted.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.240]  Man, that guy.
[00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:01.482]  What would you call Mr. Rosenberg politically?
[00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:02.903]  I mean, what is he doing there?
[00:57:04.188 --> 00:57:06.871]  A disinformation specialist?
[00:57:07.251 --> 00:57:10.774]  Look, he faults Donald Trump for being able to read?
[00:57:11.355 --> 00:57:22.405]  I mean, your listeners and those who are watching, the headline simply states, wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.
[00:57:22.725 --> 00:57:24.487]  Donald Trump didn't write that headline.
[00:57:25.187 --> 00:57:27.189]  Alex Jones didn't write that headline.
[00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.092]  That was written by this guy, and then the guy who writes it,
[00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:35.398]  Has the audacity to claim, well, there's somebody else's fault.
[00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:41.404]  I mean, you know, we are living in such a surreal, dangerous time.
[00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:49.594]  It's literally the world that, you know, we read about as children in Alice in Wonderland that was a fictional world.
[00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:59.861]  We're now seeing it in real time, where objective facts are suddenly dismissed as being right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:58:00.462 --> 00:58:07.527]  And it's just, you know, to me it's alarming because it really threatens the foundation of our republic.
[00:58:08.147 --> 00:58:26.507]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[00:58:27.268 --> 00:58:31.390]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.531]  I don't think there will be any doubt of that.
[00:58:33.751 --> 00:58:45.055]  I think it's worth noting that the head of the National Security Agency, Admiral Rogers, made a journey to Trump Tower shortly after Trump had won.
[00:58:45.915 --> 00:58:55.039]  And in the immediate aftermath of his visit, Jim Clapper and others in the intelligence community called for him to be fired.
[00:59:03.942 --> 00:59:11.046]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
