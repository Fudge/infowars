[00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.978]  Good evening, you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:26.582]  I'm Millie Weaver, it is May 11th, and this is what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.587]  Tonight, much like after the U.S.
[00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:40.033]  election, after the French election, Antifa is present on the streets of Paris, up to their typical shenanigans again.
[00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:51.796]  And then... Millie Weaver is joined by Brittany Pettibone to talk about a new video that has come out called Oppression Olympics, Who is the Most Oppressed?
[00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:56.238]  Also, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, we can't have that.
[00:00:56.618 --> 00:00:57.598]  It's too sexist.
[00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:05.001]  So now these institutions will be moving towards Gender Neutral Clubs or perhaps the Trans Scouts.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.142]  Meanwhile, Maxine Waters is at it again.
[00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:18.068]  This time, she embarrasses herself on MSNBC, but the show host is not there to save her, but calls her out instead.
[00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:22.330]  All that and more, tonight, on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.749]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.489]  I take this.
[00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.790]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.113]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:47.616]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.340]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.461]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.064]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.947]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:05.371]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.194]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.177]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.479]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.900]  I love it.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.644]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:18.805]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:24.794]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.436]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.899]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:06.152]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.994]  I'm Millie Weaver and I'm going to be breaking down a news blitz.
[00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:29.203]  So Donald Trump has been trolling like crazy and he has been draining the swamp and we've seen it with Comey who recently was fired and that massively triggered floods of liberal tears and now we're seeing
[00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:40.286]  Trump, you know, we have insiders saying that it looks like Trump could replace Spicer as a purge of establishment advisors begins.
[00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:45.708]  So apparently Sean Spicer could be the next one to be fired.
[00:03:45.748 --> 00:03:47.809]  We're going to hear Trump say, you're fired.
[00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.690]  And that seems to be crazy.
[00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.932]  But they're saying that Spicer has behaved like a deer in the headlights in recent weeks
[00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:03.554]  And is not able to handle the pressure of the job, according to one source.
[00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:24.123]  White House Chief of Staff, Renise Priebus, could also be on the chopping block as President Trump begins a purge of moderate advisers who he feels have performed poorly when it comes to investigating the source of leaks that have proved embarrassing for the administration.
[00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:44.209]  Yes, a lot of leaks have been coming out of the White House press briefing rooms and there were some investigations and it looks like nobody ever got down to who exactly was leaking things to the mainstream media in order to make the Trump administration look bad.
[00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:59.446]  Another interesting one here, you know, we just recently saw how Anderson Cooper was interviewing Kellyanne Conway and he was rolling his eyes at her when she was talking.
[00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.108]  Now what's interesting about this is
[00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:23.175]  If, in fact, it was a liberal woman on the show that you have this white male rolling his eyes at, the liberals would have had a storm, saying, oh, he's a misogynist, he's belittling and degrading this woman, if this woman was, in fact, a representative of Hillary's campaign.
[00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:30.938]  But, you know, because it's a Trump, you know, because she's associated with Trump, it's okay to belittle her and disrespect her on camera.
[00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:38.981]  Another one that's interesting is Democrats have been pushing for impeachment already.
[00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:40.622]  So this is interesting.
[00:05:40.682 --> 00:05:47.228]  The stolen valor senator is pushing for impeachment over Comey firing.
[00:05:48.249 --> 00:06:07.182]  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who once apologized for misrepresenting his military service in Vietnam, claimed President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey may well produce impeachment proceedings.
[00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:09.904]  So liberals were not happy.
[00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:17.349]  He triggered so many leftists and Democrats over firing Comey, which was a long time coming.
[00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.190]  And now they want impeachment.
[00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.815]  Well, that's kind of interesting because just before they were all praising Comey and they totally let it... No, they were not praising Comey.
[00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.736]  They were all criticizing Comey.
[00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:36.079]  And now they're acting like he's some victim because Trump fired him when they were calling for him to resign earlier.
[00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.720]  You know, Comey's
[00:06:39.301 --> 00:06:45.406]  Comey, OK, his temporary fill in has ties to Clinton.
[00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:47.267]  This is this is really creepy here.
[00:06:47.528 --> 00:06:57.675]  OK, because the person who's actually going to be replacing Comey is somebody who should not be trusted, according to some people.
[00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:06.602]  Some sources say that it looks like this guy who's going to be replacing Comey is actually a Clinton ally.
[00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:15.565]  Okay, so his name is Andrew McCabe and he's going to be sworn in to replace FBI Director James Comey.
[00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:33.629]  And he first made headlines in 2015 when his wife, who was running for a Virginia Senate seat, received nearly $500,000 in campaign donations from Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.
[00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:41.096]  Okay, a known Clinton ally, so he's getting money, his wife is getting money from a known Clinton ally.
[00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:49.606]  Incidentally, McCabe headed the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails at the time.
[00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:57.053]  And was criticized for not recusing himself from the investigation following revelations.
[00:07:57.493 --> 00:08:05.141]  So this is a guy who was supposed to be investigating Hillary Clinton's emails and didn't disclose that he had conflicts of interest.
[00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:08.964]  He didn't recuse himself and he kept on through that investigation.
[00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:10.706]  I'm sure he kind of played a role in
[00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:14.041]  Uh, getting it thrown out.
[00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:25.690]  And so this is the guy that's going to be temporarily replacing Comey, but it should only be very temporary because Donald Trump is working fast to make sure that somebody else fills the seat.
[00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:31.395]  And everybody on Twitter seems to be saying they want to see Trey Gowdy fill that seat.
[00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:35.618]  Well, that would be pretty amazing to see Trey Gowdy fill that seat because he
[00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:43.681]  Trump has a pretty good track record of being really honest, really straightforward, and a heavy hitter.
[00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:53.224]  He would be the type to go after Hillary Clinton and make sure that she's behind bars for her crimes if in fact she's guilty, which we all know she is.
[00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:54.484]  Okay.
[00:08:55.644 --> 00:09:04.087]  Trump says, okay this one's interesting right here, Trump says that he will release his tax returns
[00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:06.570]  After he leaves office.
[00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:14.100]  So he's out there trolling the liberals and all these people demanding, release your tax returns!
[00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.843]  We want to see your tax returns!
[00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:20.269]  He says he might release them after he leaves office.
[00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:33.673]  So this says, in a move destined to trigger detractors, Donald Trump has said he is considering releasing his tax returns but only after his presidency concludes.
[00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:36.894]  He says, oh at some point I'll release them.
[00:09:37.214 --> 00:09:41.736]  Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually.
[00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:43.856]  I did a good job.
[00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:46.117]  So he's just totally trolling
[00:09:46.897 --> 00:09:51.681]  People out there and you know you have all these people out there release your tax returns.
[00:09:51.721 --> 00:10:02.730]  We want to see your tax returns and you know they'll only see it after he's done and I think that honestly his tax returns are probably pretty innocent.
[00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.812]  He probably has followed the law.
[00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:08.054]  I'm sure he would be under investigation by the IRS if he didn't.
[00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:17.714]  But I think it's just more of the matter that he's not going to make people force his hand and have to give over his tax returns, because then the left would be winning.
[00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:19.433]  This is interesting.
[00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:31.705]  ABC cancels Tim Allen's highly rated TV show after two months after he called out hysterical anti-Trump left.
[00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:39.594]  Okay, so after he goes out and calls out the leftist lunacy, he gets his show canceled.
[00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:53.532]  Well, it's not too surprising from one of the, you know, the stuff that we've seen in the past where anyone who comes out as a conservative that's a Hollywood actor, Hollywood star, they get blacklisted, they get shunned, they get their shows pulled.
[00:10:53.872 --> 00:11:03.217]  Even Dr. Phil had, you know, some repercussions for him airing that show on this girl who claimed to be human sex trafficked.
[00:11:04.678 --> 00:11:07.301]  And this is what's interesting here, okay?
[00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:13.686]  Apparently, in LA there is a secret underground group of showbiz conservatives.
[00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:21.652]  Victoria Jackson, a former Saturday Night Live cast member, told Huffington Post, it started with two people in 2000.
[00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:27.577]  I was at the fifth or tenth meeting and now there are over 2,000 people!
[00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:33.260]  So we have like thousands of Hollywood celebrities.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:43.324]  These are like actors, celebrities, people you've seen on TV who probably out, you know, in front of the camera are liberals, but really secretly behind closed doors.
[00:11:43.364 --> 00:11:49.966]  They're having to have secret meetings and talk about their conservative beliefs amongst each other because they don't want to get blacklisted.
[00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:55.249]  It says the only ones out of the closet are Jon Voight and Pat Boone.
[00:11:55.729 --> 00:12:04.916]  There are famous people in there, but they don't want to lose their careers over their conservative beliefs because conservatives are blacklisted.
[00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:15.083]  My goodness, are we really going to be this afraid of political correctness that people have to be hiding in little secret rooms like they're breaking the law by having a conservative belief?
[00:12:15.743 --> 00:12:23.052]  I mean we have people too afraid to even talk about their conservative beliefs anymore at family dinners or at the office at work.
[00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:34.686]  People have to be in hiding about their conservative beliefs or risk being shamed and shunned by the super serious SJW virtue signaling liberals.
[00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:38.146]  It's pretty insane what we're coming to, folks.
[00:12:38.546 --> 00:12:44.472]  So it's pretty insane that people, conservatives, have to remain in hiding about their conservative beliefs.
[00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:48.195]  But there's also somebody out there who's fighting these SJWs.
[00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:50.977]  We're going to be joined by Brittany Pettibone.
[00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:53.139]  So let's go ahead and talk to Brittany.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.622]  Hello, Brittany Pettibone.
[00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:57.483]  How was Paris?
[00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:02.428]  I know you were out there for the election in France and you have some stories to tell.
[00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:07.969]  Yeah, it was very interesting, particularly on Victory Day.
[00:13:07.989 --> 00:13:09.490]  It was a huge march.
[00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.471]  It was a bunch of groups, actually.
[00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:16.294]  You had a bunch of different Antifa ones and anarchists.
[00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:22.438]  You even had some people holding peace signs, although they got out of there right before the march started.
[00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:25.480]  I think they figured things were going to get rowdy, so they were gone.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.902]  You saw all the elderly people departing, all the children.
[00:13:27.942 --> 00:13:30.524]  It was kind of like a sign that, okay, things are going down.
[00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:34.428]  So you had like hundreds of policemen and full riot gear.
[00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:38.854]  What they did is they, the march was down this long street towards Bastille.
[00:13:38.914 --> 00:13:39.895]  It started at Republic.
[00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:43.670]  And the police, they would not let anyone through the line.
[00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.172]  So even if you wanted to get through, even if you were a child, they wouldn't let anyone through.
[00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:48.852]  If you tried to get through, they'd throw you back.
[00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:54.214]  So basically, for a good hour, we were stuck between the policemen and the marchers who were rioting.
[00:13:54.234 --> 00:14:01.737]  So there were only certain moments when it got a little bit crazy, none of which I caught on film because I was, like, scared for it.
[00:14:01.777 --> 00:14:04.038]  Trying to, like, you know, stay out of the craziness.
[00:14:04.498 --> 00:14:07.660]  But yeah, the Antifa there are insane.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.462]  They are so many levels above the Antifa here in the USA.
[00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:13.845]  They have like uniforms, flags, chants, you know, their own.
[00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:16.567]  They have got it down.
[00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:17.327]  That's right.
[00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:20.389]  I know you were saying they were a lot more organized.
[00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.133]  They were what we can expect in the future for the Antifa here in the United States.
[00:14:26.454 --> 00:14:27.995]  Now, I know you're saying something about
[00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:32.657]  You and Lauren Southern being threatened as reporters out there.
[00:14:32.777 --> 00:14:34.138]  I'm sure it was pretty terrifying.
[00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:34.978]  What happened there?
[00:14:34.998 --> 00:14:37.159]  This was actually the first night when I arrived.
[00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:39.981]  We went to a protest against police brutality.
[00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:44.543]  So apparently someone had been murdered a few weeks ago, had been killed by policemen.
[00:14:44.643 --> 00:14:48.245]  And so they were having this big kind of riot against police brutality.
[00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:50.466]  So we were there and as we arrived,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:58.246]  Yeah, Lauren and I were very intimidated because we were pretty much the only women there and there were about like 350 just big men standing there.
[00:14:58.286 --> 00:15:02.170]  There were some younger boys too, but they looked, you know, just as scary.
[00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:09.296]  And so they basically said, you film us, we will literally beat you, you know, break your cameras, whatever.
[00:15:09.657 --> 00:15:14.141]  So what they did was we actually had someone who spoke French in our group, which was
[00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:21.191]  Thankfully, you know, so he was able to kind of mediate and kind of like warm things, warm things up and talk to them.
[00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:26.374]  So basically, after this, they were kind enough to say, okay, we're starting get out now, like leave.
[00:15:26.734 --> 00:15:28.355]  And so they they said leave or
[00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:33.523]  You know, we can't, we're not going to be able to say that you're going to be able to stay safe.
[00:15:33.884 --> 00:15:34.504]  So we left.
[00:15:34.544 --> 00:15:40.612]  It was very scary though, because as we left, we kept passing big groups of guys as they were moving into the riot.
[00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:43.235]  And they'd like, they knew that we were journalists.
[00:15:43.255 --> 00:15:43.975]  They'd be like, what's that?
[00:15:44.016 --> 00:15:44.676]  What's that stick?
[00:15:44.696 --> 00:15:45.998]  You know, you have like the selfie.
[00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:46.914]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:08.590]  And they had their, you know, flags and uniforms and everything.
[00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:14.873]  And usually the Antifa, I don't see very many that, usually they're white, just for some reason most of the Antifa are.
[00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:23.056]  But actually all of these men, they looked, they were either, they looked like they were, you know, from the Middle East somewhere or they were black.
[00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.138]  Yeah, and so we were pretty much the only white people there actually.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.100]  But this was like a no-go zone where we went.
[00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:54.085]  So these are the areas where a lot of the refugees have resettled in France and basically this is what we would be seeing along the lines if more refugees had been allowed to come into the United States because now they're at the point where they're actually out there protesting in the streets which is pretty terrifying and I know Brittany you were saying that you had been to Paris
[00:16:54.725 --> 00:17:01.153]  Before and you know years before before this refugee situation and then you came back and it was so different.
[00:17:01.613 --> 00:17:02.294]  How is it different?
[00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:03.855]  It's very different.
[00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:05.396]  Well, just in the people that are there.
[00:17:05.456 --> 00:17:06.996]  I mean, I was there in 2013.
[00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:07.956]  It was very different.
[00:17:08.436 --> 00:17:13.477]  Now I would be afraid to go out on my own in Paris, walking alone, even during the day.
[00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:29.981]  I just would, like in certain places you go, like for example, this, this protest we went to the first night, all down the street, there were like, it was, it was a relatively nice area, but like a lot of the buildings were just smashed, like the, the, the doors and windows and it was graffiti everywhere.
[00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:32.522]  You know, a lot of trash in the street and it just,
[00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:34.682]  But it's a nice area.
[00:17:34.742 --> 00:17:38.326]  It's not like it's this dump, you know, where you expect these kinds of things to happen.
[00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.108]  So that was quite shocking just seeing it.
[00:17:40.348 --> 00:17:41.849]  Yeah.
[00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.053]  It's just such that, you know, all of the refugees have come in.
[00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:46.634]  So there's refugees everywhere.
[00:17:47.095 --> 00:17:47.535]  Everywhere.
[00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:49.077]  It's, you know, it's crazy.
[00:17:49.137 --> 00:17:50.338]  I'm sure it's shocking.
[00:17:50.418 --> 00:17:51.760]  It's a shocking transformation.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.204]  It's why so many people were trying to support Le Pen to stop some of the refugees coming in.
[00:17:57.145 --> 00:18:00.366]  You know, we've seen all this craziness, even with the Antifa.
[00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:20.213]  I know the Antifa were out there celebrating, but these Antifa and SJWs are getting out of control to where they're even promoting women wearing hijabs and burqas, covering their face, in order to go along with this being politically correct ideology.
[00:18:20.593 --> 00:18:22.033]  And it's pretty disturbing.
[00:18:22.053 --> 00:18:24.314]  What do you think about that politically correct ideology?
[00:18:26.163 --> 00:18:30.486]  Political correctness is just the bane of our country's existence, really.
[00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:33.388]  It's what's causing so many of the problems.
[00:18:33.728 --> 00:18:39.371]  People just going along with things because they don't want to be shunned or, you know, socially ostracized, whatever.
[00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:41.392]  They'll just kind of bend the knee to it.
[00:18:41.633 --> 00:18:45.135]  And I think we have seen, though, an upsurge in people standing up to it.
[00:18:45.435 --> 00:18:46.676]  People are now taking to the streets.
[00:18:47.196 --> 00:18:54.690]  We'll hold that thought, Brittany, because we are going to be coming right back after the break and we're going to be joined by Josephine from My Name is Josephine.
[00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:09.360]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:16.006]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:33.540]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.364]  It works.
[00:19:40.645 --> 00:19:48.930]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:58.517]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[00:19:58.857 --> 00:19:59.477]  A total 360 win.
[00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.209]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:05.290]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.751]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.193]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:12.793]  I'm 42.
[00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.715]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.356]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:20.437]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:21.117]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:21.718]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:28.961]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:36.785]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:40.286]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:46.933]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:50.056]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.758]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:53.320]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.541]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.561 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.091]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:10.057]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:10.077 --> 00:21:11.678]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.898 --> 00:21:13.920]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.083]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.264]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:22.288]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:24.390]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:28.153]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.213 --> 00:21:33.356]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known, because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:37.118]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.158 --> 00:21:44.922]  So, ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already, because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.982 --> 00:21:50.045]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife, then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:58.481]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action, no fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:06.486]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.848]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:20.117]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:21.418]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.478 --> 00:22:27.562]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.065]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:33.307]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.413]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:44.776]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:47.658]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.758 --> 00:22:53.143]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.844 --> 00:23:00.702]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:05.752]  Again, I'm Millie Weaver.
[00:23:05.832 --> 00:23:10.757]  We are joined here with Brittany Pettibone and Josephine Mathias.
[00:23:11.237 --> 00:23:12.658]  Hi, Josephine.
[00:23:12.678 --> 00:23:13.519]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:20.685]  So, I wanted to talk a little bit about SJWs and oppression and oppression Olympics.
[00:23:20.785 --> 00:23:23.107]  So, do you have anything to say about that?
[00:23:23.127 --> 00:23:24.589]  Because I know you just had an awesome video.
[00:23:26.241 --> 00:23:30.044]  Well, I mean, it seems like everyone just wants to be oppressed nowadays.
[00:23:30.104 --> 00:23:31.565]  They kind of get points for it.
[00:23:32.826 --> 00:23:38.951]  And with the video, I kind of just touched on the idea that they kind of feel like, if I'm oppressed, therefore I'm special.
[00:23:39.072 --> 00:23:40.793]  So, you know, it makes me different.
[00:23:40.913 --> 00:23:43.716]  And it's like fighting each other to be the most oppressed.
[00:23:43.796 --> 00:23:44.356]  It's crazy.
[00:23:45.037 --> 00:23:46.198]  Yeah, it is really crazy.
[00:23:46.218 --> 00:23:47.419]  What do you think about that, Brittany?
[00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:51.571]  Yeah, well, I think it's also a way that people don't have to take responsibility for things.
[00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:58.337]  They can say, oh, you know, I'm oppressed and I'm a victim here, so I should get handouts here and everyone should feel sorry for me, etc.
[00:23:58.677 --> 00:24:02.380]  So I think that we have a huge problem in our society today with taking accountability.
[00:24:02.953 --> 00:24:05.595]  And that is a way that people get out of it.
[00:24:06.156 --> 00:24:06.596]  That's right.
[00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:14.002]  And it actually is a way of oppressing someone to tell them that they're oppressed and that they'll never be able to achieve things.
[00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:16.884]  And that they're always going to be under a glass ceiling.
[00:24:16.904 --> 00:24:19.506]  And I know Josephine was telling me about that.
[00:24:19.686 --> 00:24:22.549]  And you had some really interesting take on that, Josephine.
[00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:25.214]  Well, I think it's ridiculous.
[00:24:25.254 --> 00:24:32.892]  You're trying to tell little kids or tell people that if you are a certain race, if you are a woman, if you are oppressed,
[00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:35.073]  Then you're not going to be able to make it in life.
[00:24:35.093 --> 00:24:37.034]  You're not going to be able to make it to the front steps.
[00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.636]  Then it should be the opposite of that.
[00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:42.460]  They should be telling kids that it doesn't matter what race you are, it doesn't matter what sex you are.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.401]  If you put in work, then you will make it.
[00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:54.331]  So it's just kind of making people feel bad, or not even feel bad, like the fact that they are different because it makes them special and they get oppression points for that.
[00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:57.854]  And I don't know, it's counterproductive.
[00:24:58.274 --> 00:25:03.579]  It really is, and that's why we're going to show a clip from your video because it's really awesome.
[00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:04.800]  It's very creatively done.
[00:25:05.161 --> 00:25:08.624]  But thank you so much for joining us, Brittany Pettibone.
[00:25:08.644 --> 00:25:16.692]  We really enjoyed having you on, and after this short video clip of Josephine's video, we will be back talking more to Josephine.
[00:25:16.712 --> 00:25:17.473]  So let's roll.
[00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:22.448]  Hey guys, my name is Josephine and today I'll be reviewing BuzzFeed's video, What is Privilege?
[00:25:22.788 --> 00:25:24.829]  Or it's also known as the Oppression Olympics.
[00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:25.789]  Whichever one works.
[00:25:26.349 --> 00:25:32.632]  This is one of my favorite videos on the internet because it shows you how much privilege you have by asking you questions like, did you have a toothbrush growing up?
[00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:35.013]  Or are you a white, straight, cis male?
[00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.174]  So let's get right into it.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:52.016]  I suppose being a white male will help me end up somewhere towards the front, but I'll take a few steps back from being gay.
[00:25:52.937 --> 00:25:55.138]  I also lost a limb, so I'm gonna take a step back.
[00:25:55.358 --> 00:25:56.219]  Oh, and I'm Muslim.
[00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:57.640]  I'm gonna take two steps back.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.102]  This is literally Oppression Olympics.
[00:26:00.182 --> 00:26:01.122]  And look at his face, too.
[00:26:01.182 --> 00:26:02.163]  He loves this.
[00:26:02.203 --> 00:26:03.604]  I mean, he gets oppression points.
[00:26:03.744 --> 00:26:09.228]  It's so awful being a white male, but I'm gay, so I'm technically a minority and very, very oppressed.
[00:26:09.328 --> 00:26:10.869]  That's one oppression point for you, sir.
[00:26:11.089 --> 00:26:12.150]  Congratulations.
[00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.631]  I don't think I'll make it to the front.
[00:26:13.912 --> 00:26:15.513]  I think I'll maybe be in the middle.
[00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:17.335]  That's just a gut feeling I have.
[00:26:17.556 --> 00:26:19.197]  I think we all have that gut feeling as well.
[00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:23.802]  I mean, you're a male, so you're an oppressor, but you're also black, so you're technically oppressed as well.
[00:26:23.942 --> 00:26:26.285]  So you're not entirely at the back, but close enough.
[00:26:26.345 --> 00:26:28.227]  That's one oppression point for you too, sir.
[00:26:29.827 --> 00:26:33.429]  Okay, so before this starts, I'm gonna take a guess on what your final positions are.
[00:26:33.689 --> 00:26:36.671]  The question should have just been, are you a white, cis, straight male?
[00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:37.751]  To the front.
[00:26:38.071 --> 00:26:39.212]  And are you a minority?
[00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:40.873]  To the back, please.
[00:26:41.053 --> 00:26:47.897]  If you can show affection for your romantic partner in public without fear of ridicule or violence, take one step forward.
[00:26:48.077 --> 00:26:52.459]  And if you're blamed for the downfall of the black community simply because of your race, take a step back.
[00:26:52.719 --> 00:26:55.821]  If you get time off for your religious holidays, take one step forward.
[00:26:56.221 --> 00:27:00.785]  If you're constantly called a sexist, misogynistic rapist because of your gender, take a step back.
[00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:02.606]  Also, BuzzFeed, great experiment.
[00:27:02.686 --> 00:27:03.547]  This isn't biased at all.
[00:27:03.587 --> 00:27:06.529]  I mean, it's not like you picked the questions and the participants.
[00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:12.574]  And there it is, guys!
[00:27:12.634 --> 00:27:14.476]  The black woman is all the way at the back.
[00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:16.357]  I mean, what could she have answered so far?
[00:27:16.597 --> 00:27:22.042]  She's probably trans, gay, her left leg's fake, she has some kind of mental illness, she's Muslim.
[00:27:22.122 --> 00:27:24.464]  I'm, like, starting to run out of oppressions here.
[00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:29.468]  If you've ever been bullied or made fun of based on something you can't change, take one step back.
[00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:34.253]  So, Josephine, that's a pretty awesome video that you put together.
[00:27:34.273 --> 00:27:40.799]  I was laughing during it, but at the same time I was very concerned because, I can't believe it, a Prussian Olympics.
[00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:44.282]  They even had lines drawn out like it was some kind of football game or something.
[00:27:44.302 --> 00:27:46.984]  Do you think that they should be handing out awards?
[00:27:48.018 --> 00:27:49.399]  They basically should be.
[00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.840]  I mean, did you see how sad the black guy was, by the way?
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.261]  He's like, I know where I'm going to end up.
[00:27:54.281 --> 00:27:56.822]  You know, I'm going to be at the, you know, closer to the back.
[00:27:56.862 --> 00:27:58.863]  And it's like, how awful is this?
[00:27:58.903 --> 00:27:59.764]  Like, you're demeaning.
[00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:00.984]  This is demeaning to people.
[00:28:01.005 --> 00:28:04.266]  It's like telling them you're not good enough to be at the front lines.
[00:28:04.386 --> 00:28:05.787]  It's oh, it's so sad.
[00:28:05.807 --> 00:28:11.310]  And the best part is that all those people work at BuzzFeed to do it, to do an experiment with those people.
[00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.730]  It just it's already biased.
[00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.611]  It makes no sense.
[00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:15.512]  That proves absolutely nothing.
[00:28:16.252 --> 00:28:40.457]  Yeah, it really is insane to see this and, you know, just as you were saying earlier to me on the phone about how it's actually oppressing people to say that you're oppressed and that you won't ever have the same opportunities and that you need a hand and extra help up with things, assuming that they're not capable of overcoming any obstacles that could be put in their way.
[00:28:41.377 --> 00:28:43.598]  I mean, yes, sorry.
[00:28:43.658 --> 00:28:50.640]  One of the statements made by the white guy, actually, he said, no amount of hard work or legislation can fix this gap.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.121]  And my mind was blown.
[00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.202]  I literally wanted to throw my computer because it makes absolutely no sense.
[00:28:55.222 --> 00:28:59.163]  They're telling kids or I mean, I hope it's just kids watching these videos.
[00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:02.985]  They're telling kids that no amount of hard work can help them succeed.
[00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:04.865]  They should just give out awards.
[00:29:04.905 --> 00:29:06.866]  Honestly, it is the oppression Olympics.
[00:29:06.966 --> 00:29:08.347]  And the black woman won.
[00:29:08.387 --> 00:29:09.367]  She's all the way at the back.
[00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:20.240]  So Josephine, I'm sure that this video has probably triggered and massively trolled a bunch of SJW snowflakes out there.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.344]  I'm sure you've been getting all kinds of comments and messages.
[00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:26.068]  What has been the reaction to this?
[00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:32.452]  I mean, on one side I'm called a coon and on the other side I'm called a white supremacist apologist.
[00:29:32.852 --> 00:29:39.215]  It's funny, I went to a protest the other day and an antifa white guy came up to me and said, like, you're a white supremacist apologist.
[00:29:39.556 --> 00:29:44.618]  And I was like, dude, I can, like, accuse you of sexism and racism right now.
[00:29:44.658 --> 00:29:45.919]  I have more power right now.
[00:29:46.879 --> 00:29:48.840]  But yeah, that's basically what I got.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.502]  It sucks, but I mean, I'm telling the truth, so...
[00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:52.903]  Who cares?
[00:29:53.484 --> 00:29:53.904]  That's right.
[00:29:53.944 --> 00:29:56.666]  You are speaking the truth, Josephine.
[00:29:56.846 --> 00:30:02.570]  We really appreciate you standing up for this liberal lunacy because that's really what it is.
[00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.891]  I mean, it's complete lunacy.
[00:30:05.612 --> 00:30:12.817]  And just to see the fact that we have this culture now where being the victim is the highest honor.
[00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:21.282]  You know, I mean, you're going to have people claiming everybody's going to want to claim some kind of victimhood and then you're going to have all kinds of craziness going on.
[00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:28.205]  Just as you were saying in this video, how has that been?
[00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:31.006]  I mean, I don't know, are you a conservative, Josephine?
[00:30:31.546 --> 00:30:36.688]  I'm actually not a conservative, I'm more of a classical liberal, but I do have some conservative speed.
[00:30:40.847 --> 00:31:01.071]  You, in the sense of being a liberal, you agree with probably the Democratic policies and, you know, just more of the American version of being a Democrat versus this SJW virtue signaling and wanting to say there's 64 genders and all this craziness.
[00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:02.932]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:02.952 --> 00:31:07.773]  When I say I'm a liberal, I have to say I'm a liberal, not a lefty, just to kind of say I'm not that crazy SJW side.
[00:31:09.053 --> 00:31:15.337]  And like you were saying earlier, the whole idea of the victim mentality, everyone wanting to be victims.
[00:31:15.377 --> 00:31:21.260]  I was at New York a week ago, and this old white woman came up to me and said, I just want you to stay strong.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.881]  And I just want you to try to fight through all this hate.
[00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:25.622]  And I'm standing there like, excuse me?
[00:31:25.942 --> 00:31:29.764]  That's more insulting than someone coming up to me and being actually racist.
[00:31:30.084 --> 00:31:35.027]  Because it's like you're trying to tell me that I'm less or, you know, I'm not doing as well because of my race.
[00:31:36.308 --> 00:31:49.833]  Well Josephine, it has been so great having you on here, and you guys can check out more amazing videos of Josephine's at her YouTube channel, MyNameIsJosephine, or on Twitter, MyNameIsJosephine.
[00:31:50.213 --> 00:31:51.614]  So make sure you guys check her out.
[00:31:51.634 --> 00:31:52.854]  Thanks so much, Josephine.
[00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:58.857]  Thank you for trolling these SJWs who are massive virtue signalers, because
[00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:10.261]  It's just awesome to see young, talented women like yourself out there speaking up and having a voice against this lunacy that we see on the left.
[00:32:11.461 --> 00:32:14.062]  It's fun doing it, so it's great.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:26.764]  Well, it is so great to see other women out there standing up against the insane lunacy that comes out of these SJW Virtue Signallers.
[00:32:27.164 --> 00:32:29.205]  So, high five, Josephine.
[00:32:29.365 --> 00:32:30.645]  That is awesome.
[00:32:30.725 --> 00:32:31.345]  You rock.
[00:32:31.465 --> 00:32:32.786]  You get the Troll Award.
[00:32:33.726 --> 00:32:41.511]  As far as these oppression Olympics, well, maybe we should start handing out some awards to some of these basement-dwelling SJWs.
[00:32:41.972 --> 00:32:44.813]  Well, stay tuned guys for more awesome reports.
[00:32:44.853 --> 00:32:46.895]  You're watching the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.987]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.047 --> 00:33:05.008]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.148 --> 00:33:06.590]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.711]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:08.632]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.032 --> 00:33:11.235]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:13.157]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.177 --> 00:33:16.781]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately, your clinics.
[00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:17.462]  MycoCX.
[00:33:18.183 --> 00:33:18.803]  We're good to go.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.044]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:49.644]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:53.827]  So, we've been doing research just like you have on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.088 --> 00:34:01.453]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... And we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:04.656]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:13.203]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:16.145]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.185 --> 00:34:18.607]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.627 --> 00:34:20.329]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:27.912]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:37.197]  I've had nobody, here's the thing Alex, when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.757 --> 00:34:40.679]  It's going to show, you're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:45.402]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:45.883]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:46.843]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:48.124]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:48.705]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:49.866]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:51.887]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.689]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:56.230]  Yeast overgrowth.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.933]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:05.597]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:07.218]  What doctor?
[00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.380]  By the way, folks, look, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:11.162]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:12.724]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:14.606]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.726 --> 00:35:15.728]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:17.930]  Listen, this is religious for me.
[00:35:19.432 --> 00:35:21.975]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe it.
[00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:26.761]  If we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:28.763]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:29.904]  I'm ready to give my life.
[00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.085]  Everybody knows that against the enemy.
[00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.066]  Please.
[00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:34.328]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:35.469]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.290]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.210]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:42.235]  MycoZX antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.295 --> 00:35:43.035]  Get it today.
[00:35:43.136 --> 00:35:43.596]  Limited run.
[00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:44.617]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.759]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:48.901]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.921 --> 00:35:50.863]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great!
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:14.889]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:24.135]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swirl, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:24.895]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:27.497]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:29.138]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[00:36:29.378 --> 00:36:32.720]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.220]  That's amazing.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.900]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.162]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.182 --> 00:36:38.423]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:40.123]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.183 --> 00:36:41.284]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.304 --> 00:36:42.885]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:50.308]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:51.289]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:53.310]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.994]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:58.054 --> 00:36:59.976]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:06.902]  What I have to say is going to really make some people angry.
[00:37:07.242 --> 00:37:17.971]  And I want you to understand up front, those of you who will call me a homophobe, I want you to understand that I agree that you have a right to promote your homosexual, even your transsexual gender agenda.
[00:37:19.045 --> 00:37:21.432]  But you deny this right to other people.
[00:37:21.913 --> 00:37:26.426]  And I want to draw a distinction between promoting this to children.
[00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:30.211]  We talk about what consenting adults can do.
[00:37:30.272 --> 00:37:32.073]  That's a very different issue.
[00:37:32.113 --> 00:37:34.655]  This is something that's been evolving for quite some time.
[00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.178]  Now we have people who are beginning to wake up.
[00:37:37.218 --> 00:37:41.021]  Today we had the Mormon Church cut ties with the Boy Scouts for older teens.
[00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:46.586]  And as USA Today points out, the Mormon Church is the largest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States.
[00:37:46.926 --> 00:37:50.089]  They announced Thursday it is pulling older teenagers from the organization.
[00:37:50.549 --> 00:38:05.793]  As religion takes a step toward developing its own global scouting-like program, the Utah-based religion's announcement means an estimated 130,000 to 180,000 teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 will no longer participate in Boy Scouts starting next year.
[00:38:05.853 --> 00:38:08.954]  This will be a significant loss for the organization Boy Scouts of America.
[00:38:09.414 --> 00:38:19.837]  The Mormons said the decision was not triggered by their policy change in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders, since Mormon troops are allowed to run their groups to adhere to church teachings.
[00:38:20.745 --> 00:38:27.207]  But of course, there is discernment now in some other churches, even though it may be missing in other places, as to what's really going on.
[00:38:27.628 --> 00:38:28.728]  It's a political agenda.
[00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:31.529]  It is not just a sexualizing agenda that's happening here.
[00:38:31.569 --> 00:38:35.391]  They say this loss is only a fraction of the 2.3 million youth and Boy Scouts.
[00:38:35.911 --> 00:38:39.592]  They say that for the Mormons, this is a rite of passage.
[00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:42.413]  The church covers the cost of troops for congregations.
[00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:46.975]  They're known as wards, and they strongly have encouraged participation.
[00:38:47.395 --> 00:38:49.336]  Now they're removing themselves from this organization.
[00:38:49.376 --> 00:38:58.662]  And as they say, this has nothing to do with the decision in 2015 to allow adult homosexual leaders to run these troops.
[00:38:59.242 --> 00:39:02.484]  There are others, as it's reported by AP, who are saying differently.
[00:39:02.504 --> 00:39:08.988]  At least one Mormon scholar, says AP, said the Boy Scouts and the church have been diverging on values in recent years.
[00:39:09.608 --> 00:39:14.973]  That the policy of having adult gays is probably one of several contributing factors in the split.
[00:39:14.993 --> 00:39:17.415]  Of course, it's also going to be politics and many other things.
[00:39:17.795 --> 00:39:22.240]  And they say, like other conservative faiths, the Mormon Church opposes gay marriage.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.102]  It teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin.
[00:39:25.142 --> 00:39:34.891]  The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts policy change on gays, but it stayed within the organization after receiving assurances that it could promote its moral values.
[00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:35.772]  And so that's the question.
[00:39:36.152 --> 00:39:38.033]  Whose moral values are being promoted?
[00:39:38.273 --> 00:39:40.173]  What are the moral values that are being promoted?
[00:39:41.234 --> 00:39:42.814]  And we can look at the Girl Scouts as well.
[00:39:42.854 --> 00:39:46.375]  For quite some time there's been a lot of talk about what's going on within the Girl Scouts.
[00:39:47.115 --> 00:39:50.476]  See, there's a political, there's a sexual agenda, it's a radical agenda.
[00:39:51.176 --> 00:39:55.498]  And these agendas always begin by sexualizing our children.
[00:39:55.938 --> 00:40:02.440]  First talking to them about heterosexual sex at an inappropriate age perhaps, or perhaps in an inappropriate way.
[00:40:03.257 --> 00:40:12.265]  Parents should be the ones making that decision, and of course the parents are deciding that they want to have their kids in these organizations, but do they know what is happening in these organizations?
[00:40:12.426 --> 00:40:14.748]  Are you aware of what's happening there if you're not leader?
[00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:19.472]  I think just as we see in schools, there's a lot of disconnect here with parents.
[00:40:19.532 --> 00:40:20.914]  They need to understand what's going on.
[00:40:21.534 --> 00:40:30.839]  And so we look at the Catholic News Agency, who has pointed out for many years problems with this, calling the Girl Scout leadership pro-choice, pro-gay ideologues.
[00:40:31.279 --> 00:40:39.603]  They say the Girl Scouts organization has drawn scrutiny for promoting biased resources, like the left-wing media matters of George Soros.
[00:40:39.623 --> 00:40:40.284]  They promote that.
[00:40:40.804 --> 00:40:44.866]  And pressuring one employee to muzzle her pro-life views.
[00:40:44.906 --> 00:40:50.009]  The latest events top the pile of controversies that have outraged parents and caused some to quit.
[00:40:50.689 --> 00:40:54.372]  The Girl Scouts have filled their national leadership team, and this is what you have to look at.
[00:40:55.332 --> 00:41:00.276]  The people who are running the organization and their board of directors with unwavering ideologues.
[00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:02.057]  Let's take a look at their pro-abortion bias.
[00:41:02.117 --> 00:41:10.923]  The Girl Scouts of the United States have refused to allow pro-life advocacy to count towards badge work or program requirements, even within
[00:41:11.503 --> 00:41:14.226]  These faith-based religious programs.
[00:41:14.286 --> 00:41:16.908]  And understand, they've had these connections to churches.
[00:41:16.948 --> 00:41:18.189]  The churches have the buildings.
[00:41:18.489 --> 00:41:21.352]  The churches have the headcount, the children.
[00:41:21.672 --> 00:41:23.073]  That's how they pull this in.
[00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:27.417]  And they promise the churches, oh, that's okay, we'll let them organize around your values.
[00:41:27.477 --> 00:41:32.181]  And yet, if your values, like the Catholics, are pro-life, no, no, no, you can't do that.
[00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:33.682]  You can get a badge.
[00:41:34.443 --> 00:41:37.906]  If you want to go to Planned Parenthood or to other abortion options.
[00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:42.671]  They say even within these religious programs, this is not an option.
[00:41:42.731 --> 00:41:49.437]  So even though you're in the Mormons or the Catholics, they're organizing this Girl Scout troop, you can't do a pro-life badge.
[00:41:49.597 --> 00:41:58.326]  Yet their leadership program objectives consider the advocacy for quote-unquote reproductive health in school or a neighborhood as a sign that the Scout has mastered
[00:41:58.926 --> 00:41:59.867]  Advocacy skills.
[00:42:00.007 --> 00:42:13.202]  In addition, the Girl Scouts curriculum, Your Voice, Your World, The Power of Advocacy, instructs girls to explore five abortion advocacy organizations, including the Population Council, to see where and how they're promoting change.
[00:42:13.803 --> 00:42:15.824]  But are there any pro-life advocacy groups?
[00:42:16.204 --> 00:42:17.144]  No, not at all.
[00:42:17.544 --> 00:42:25.166]  As a matter of fact, if you look at this article, 100 Questions for Girl Scouts, most of these questions are focused on the people who run the organization.
[00:42:25.726 --> 00:42:32.748]  The people who are filling the national leadership team, the board of directors, the radical ideologues that have been put there.
[00:42:33.188 --> 00:42:41.050]  And they ask in some of these questions, are parents aware that the link on Girl Scouts' website sends girls to do research on the website of the Global Fund for Women?
[00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:56.282]  Okay, and what you see at that site is they have projects there to change the cultural and political, sexual orientation and gender identity that challenges both conservative elements of society and mainstream women's movements.
[00:42:56.863 --> 00:42:57.743]  That's their agenda.
[00:42:58.163 --> 00:42:58.864]  That's what they're doing.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:09.728]  And then when you look at the political aspect, the fact that they are going to media matters, the fact that they have at their convention, their girls learned about moving beyond diversity to inclusion.
[00:43:09.748 --> 00:43:17.593]  An event that addressed diversity beyond the traditional gender and ethnicity model to prepare for a new world order of globalism.
[00:43:18.214 --> 00:43:22.037]  So the Catholics have also, in some areas, moved away from scouting.
[00:43:22.737 --> 00:43:32.940]  We had an article less than a week ago, how the Archdiocese in Kansas City is now moving away from Girl Scouts, and they're even banning Girl Scout cookie sales.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.981]  They say, this is a New American article, the Girl Scouts are un-American.
[00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:46.684]  This essentially is a conclusion of the Archdiocese of Kansas City, which announced Monday that it is finally severing ties with the increasingly secular left-wing group.
[00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:51.249]  They said Girl Scouts is no longer a compatible partner for the Catholic Church.
[00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:55.614]  It elevates role models who stand in stark opposition to what we believe.
[00:43:56.154 --> 00:43:59.318]  And again, they're calling for an end to Girl Scout cookie sales.
[00:43:59.338 --> 00:44:07.687]  They said this comes after hundreds of hours of staff research and dialoguing with the Girl Scouts to try to figure out if there's any way that they can keep this together.
[00:44:08.208 --> 00:44:15.631]  And as I point out, going back to 1993, they said you can take the pledge of God out of there and you can swear to any entity that you want.
[00:44:15.811 --> 00:44:18.452]  Presumably Gaia, maybe even Beelzebub, whatever.
[00:44:18.472 --> 00:44:23.594]  They've taken a hard left turn, even advocating infanticide.
[00:44:24.135 --> 00:44:24.395]  Okay?
[00:44:24.435 --> 00:44:26.616]  And that's essentially what abortion is.
[00:44:26.836 --> 00:44:28.316]  And Catholics understand that.
[00:44:28.356 --> 00:44:29.317]  Traditional Catholics do.
[00:44:30.077 --> 00:44:40.221]  So the national organization contributes more than a million dollars each year to the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, an organization that is tied to international planned parenthood.
[00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:41.881]  So this is where they're going.
[00:44:41.921 --> 00:44:43.042]  Where did all this come from?
[00:44:44.005 --> 00:44:50.830]  Well, we've seen, for instance, in the Boy Scouts, we have seen a radical change in the Boy Scouts in just the last four years.
[00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:58.795]  And interestingly enough, the individual at the center of all this is Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's pick for the Secretary of State.
[00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:03.858]  I talked about this briefly when his name was floated around in nomination.
[00:45:04.844 --> 00:45:11.709]  His role at the Boy Scouts in terms of promoting homosexuality and adult homosexual leaders.
[00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:20.896]  And you have to understand that when we talk about this, again, this is not about promoting your agenda or denigrating your agenda.
[00:45:20.936 --> 00:45:25.639]  This is about consenting adults and this is about molesting children.
[00:45:26.479 --> 00:45:30.981]  We have too much sexual molesting of children that's going on in our schools, for example.
[00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:40.705]  One of the reasons why we have Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts that are separate, why we segregate the sexes, is because we're trying to minimize the sexual molestation of children.
[00:45:41.426 --> 00:45:45.627]  That should be our first priority, not the fact that you want to celebrate what you're doing.
[00:45:46.028 --> 00:45:49.009]  Their innocence matters more than your political agenda.
[00:45:50.117 --> 00:45:54.919]  And all the people who don't want to talk about this, the people who are going to get angry about this, need to understand that.
[00:45:55.579 --> 00:45:57.320]  This is not about you.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.481]  This is about protecting children.
[00:45:59.501 --> 00:46:16.908]  And it's one of the reasons why we had Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, why we would pick heterosexual men over the boys, hoping that we would get somebody in charge of these kids who are going to be away from their parents, who are going to be a small number of adults per children, hoping that we could have a situation where we would minimize that.
[00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:18.409]  You'll never stop it altogether.
[00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:21.079]  And people will always disguise themselves in different ways.
[00:46:21.139 --> 00:46:23.269]  But what you have to understand is that Rex Tillerson...
[00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:26.307]  Spoke about this in 2013.
[00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:30.050]  Pushed this and said, no youth may be denied membership of the Boy Scouts of America.
[00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.892]  That policy changed in 2013.
[00:46:33.472 --> 00:46:38.096]  Then by the beginning of 2014, within just 16 months, they had homosexual adult leaders.
[00:46:38.236 --> 00:46:40.738]  Now they have moved another year and a half later.
[00:46:41.078 --> 00:46:44.481]  They're now pushing for transgender children in the Boy Scouts.
[00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:46.442]  There are things that you can do with your children.
[00:46:46.662 --> 00:46:48.724]  You can put them in the American Heritage Girls.
[00:46:48.924 --> 00:46:52.287]  Or you could try another institution, a very ancient one, the family.
[00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.529]  Don't lose this time with your children.
[00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:57.712]  Take this, you're not their cruise director, you're their parents.
[00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:02.056]  Don't turn them over to people and to agendas you don't know about.
[00:47:02.997 --> 00:47:07.741]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.444 --> 00:47:10.006]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.406 --> 00:47:15.412]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.772 --> 00:47:21.218]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.618 --> 00:47:28.205]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.007]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.790]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.072]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.492 --> 00:47:40.115]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.877]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.487 --> 00:48:00.611]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.233]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:03.334]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:08.338]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:13.462]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:18.847]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.068]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:22.830]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.230]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.435]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.455 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.517]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.178]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:59.089]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.970]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.030]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.502 --> 00:49:09.703]  We can't tell you anything.
[00:49:09.783 --> 00:49:13.366]  All I can tell you is the FBI director has no credibility.
[00:49:13.606 --> 00:49:15.827]  The FBI director has no credibility.
[00:49:16.288 --> 00:49:17.369]  Well, there it is, folks.
[00:49:17.429 --> 00:49:21.452]  Maxine Waters telling you how James Comey has no credibility.
[00:49:22.112 --> 00:49:22.352]  Huh.
[00:49:22.452 --> 00:49:22.873]  It's funny.
[00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:25.835]  You'd think that she would agree with Trump with that notion.
[00:49:25.855 --> 00:49:26.555]  Hmm.
[00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:28.877]  Not quite the case, is it?
[00:49:29.357 --> 00:49:31.359]  Well, I'm sure you know what time it is.
[00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:32.800]  Go ahead and roll the first clip.
[00:49:33.686 --> 00:49:40.429]  But if you said that FBI Director James Comey had no credibility, wouldn't you support the fact that the President then, then counted Trump?
[00:49:40.449 --> 00:49:40.709]  No, no, no, no.
[00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:42.590]  Now President Trump made the decision to get rid of him?
[00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.411]  No, no, not necessarily.
[00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:52.635]  So Maxine Waters is now at the point in her career where she goes on MSNBC and gets schooled.
[00:49:53.855 --> 00:50:01.457]  MSNBC has been the darling for Maxine Waters, giving her a platform to spew her ridiculous, outrageous rhetoric whenever she wants.
[00:50:01.837 --> 00:50:04.358]  But now even the hosts have caught on.
[00:50:04.818 --> 00:50:07.258]  This woman is out of her mind.
[00:50:07.678 --> 00:50:17.721]  So when you have MSNBC calling you out on air, when you're on the same team as them, you know you really have a problem, Maxine.
[00:50:18.261 --> 00:50:18.881]  Roll the next clip.
[00:50:19.696 --> 00:50:23.339]  But you said he had no credibility, so it would seem to make sense that he should get rid of him.
[00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:24.840]  No, no, no, no.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:31.664]  Under investigation, this president basically has interfered with.
[00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:37.408]  So here she is, babbling in denial like a complete fool.
[00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:40.731]  And this woman still has support.
[00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.913]  The millennials are somehow endeared by this woman.
[00:50:45.174 --> 00:50:47.896]  And she's really planning on running for office again.
[00:50:49.122 --> 00:50:49.622]  Shocking!
[00:50:50.542 --> 00:50:51.003]  Shocking!
[00:50:51.463 --> 00:50:53.463]  That is a crazed lunatic we just witnessed.
[00:50:53.503 --> 00:50:54.744]  A politician on television.
[00:50:54.804 --> 00:50:55.144]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:55.424 --> 00:50:57.984]  Can't even provide an answer to a simple question.
[00:50:58.265 --> 00:50:59.065]  Because how could she?
[00:50:59.365 --> 00:51:02.046]  She's stuck in her own double-think web of lies.
[00:51:02.506 --> 00:51:05.907]  Let's go to more of Maxine Waters being called out by MSNBC.
[00:51:06.447 --> 00:51:17.550]  To be clear, you believe it would have been better to keep in place an FBI director who you said had no credibility to oversee this investigation than to find someone who you think would be a better choice.
[00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.212]  No, but I believe the president thought that.
[00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:21.373]  Wow.
[00:51:22.414 --> 00:51:22.734]  Okay.
[00:51:23.194 --> 00:51:29.899]  I'm going to try to break this down for you folks, but it is getting really, really difficult to analyze the doublethink.
[00:51:30.039 --> 00:51:31.581]  It's getting that out of control.
[00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:32.762]  So just bear with me here.
[00:51:33.692 --> 00:51:54.157]  According to Maxine Waters, the president that just fired James Comey, according to Maxine Waters, Trump wants an incompetent FBI director in that he already fired, but Maxine doesn't want that, who's upset the FBI director she called incompetent was fired.
[00:51:55.457 --> 00:51:59.218]  I know that that makes no sense, but that's what Maxine Waters is saying.
[00:52:00.458 --> 00:52:02.279]  This is how insane this woman is.
[00:52:03.923 --> 00:52:08.847]  I mean, go ahead and rewind the video, you can try to understand what I just said for yourself, but that's it!
[00:52:09.888 --> 00:52:20.676]  Maxine Waters is upset that Trump fired the FBI director that she called was incompetent for the FBI investigation that she thinks is the most important.
[00:52:22.278 --> 00:52:23.759]  How do you wrap your mind around this woman?
[00:52:24.459 --> 00:52:25.660]  Let alone vote for her!
[00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:29.303]  I don't know, maybe, how do you wrap your mind around this woman?
[00:52:29.383 --> 00:52:31.625]  Hmm, maybe I should ask Maxine Waters' wig.
[00:52:31.645 --> 00:52:32.806]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:52:33.547 --> 00:52:38.489]  You have an investigation going on where the president is implicated.
[00:52:38.909 --> 00:52:40.870]  And this is a serious investigation.
[00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:46.772]  I've been trying to get people to focus on this connection with the Kremlin and with Putin.
[00:52:47.092 --> 00:52:51.334]  They have put the eye on this investigation, which I love.
[00:52:51.694 --> 00:52:58.897]  I love the fact that because they did this in the way that they did it, now more people are focused on this investigation.
[00:52:59.926 --> 00:53:09.689]  You know, it's a golden opportunity when you have a television interview where you can take the person saying one thing and then take them saying the exact opposite thing in the same interview.
[00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:10.429]  I love that.
[00:53:10.669 --> 00:53:12.670]  And with Maxine Waters, it seems to be commonplace.
[00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.491]  So, here she is.
[00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:15.811]  She's not happy.
[00:53:15.871 --> 00:53:16.571]  She's upset.
[00:53:16.831 --> 00:53:18.892]  She's trying to get more attention to the Russia thing.
[00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:21.273]  She wants more people to know about the Russia collusion with Trump.
[00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:22.233]  Look over here!
[00:53:22.493 --> 00:53:22.833]  Russia!
[00:53:22.893 --> 00:53:23.193]  Russia!
[00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:23.633]  Look at this!
[00:53:23.853 --> 00:53:25.314]  She's begging for people to look.
[00:53:26.192 --> 00:53:34.757]  But then in the same interview, where she's very upset with President Trump firing James Comey, she's happy that President Trump fired James Comey.
[00:53:35.098 --> 00:53:41.321]  No, not because they agree that he's incompetent, but because now she's happy that it's bringing attention to it.
[00:53:44.103 --> 00:53:53.389]  In the same interview, she complains there's not enough attention and that James Comey is fired, but now that she's, now that Comey's fired, she's happy there's attention on it.
[00:53:54.551 --> 00:53:55.652]  This is seriously amazing.
[00:53:55.892 --> 00:53:59.454]  But the truth is, everyday Americans are over this, Maxine.
[00:54:00.315 --> 00:54:01.315]  You just don't get it yet.
[00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:02.516]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:10.561]  Let everybody go at this investigation until we get to the facts and to the bottom line, which was their conclusion.
[00:54:10.841 --> 00:54:12.022]  I believe that there was.
[00:54:12.402 --> 00:54:17.465]  And nobody's asking, why is it Putin wanted this man to be president?
[00:54:17.806 --> 00:54:20.127]  Why is it he interfered with our election?
[00:54:20.407 --> 00:54:22.709]  Why is it he undermined our democracy?
[00:54:23.169 --> 00:54:24.911]  Those questions have to be answered.
[00:54:25.211 --> 00:54:26.352]  I think I know why.
[00:54:26.712 --> 00:54:34.218]  I think there's enough there that we know about the Kremlin and about Putin to be concerned about whether or not there was collusion.
[00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:40.744]  They should have to connect the dots and get the facts because I think it will lead to the impeachment of this president.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.002]  And there it is, the nice conclusion for Maxine Waters.
[00:54:44.022 --> 00:54:45.944]  Alright, we're going to try to wrap our head around all that.
[00:54:46.004 --> 00:54:48.405]  Okay, first of all, who is stopping the investigation?
[00:54:49.326 --> 00:54:50.767]  Nobody is stopping this investigation!
[00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.368]  There's hearings every week!
[00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:53.269]  There's interviews!
[00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:54.090]  Everyone's talking about it!
[00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:56.351]  The investigation was ongoing!
[00:54:57.552 --> 00:54:59.053]  Comey was the one that did nothing!
[00:54:59.294 --> 00:55:01.495]  You'd think that you would be upset, Maxine, you called him incompetent.
[00:55:01.535 --> 00:55:03.777]  But, you know, she's sitting here, oh, Putin!
[00:55:04.057 --> 00:55:05.598]  Why would Putin undermine the election?
[00:55:05.638 --> 00:55:09.902]  A question still nobody can answer, even though she says she has it figured out, yet she can't answer that question.
[00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:15.654]  Remember Maxine, you were saying and the Democrats were saying it was James Comey that undermined the election.
[00:55:16.095 --> 00:55:17.157]  How soon we forget!
[00:55:17.678 --> 00:55:18.941]  How soon we forget!
[00:55:18.981 --> 00:55:21.286]  But again, no one is stopping the investigation.
[00:55:22.492 --> 00:55:26.494]  And nobody can answer the question, not because it's not being asked, but because there are no answers.
[00:55:27.094 --> 00:55:29.956]  And again, here she is saying, I know why.
[00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:30.836]  I know the collusion.
[00:55:30.896 --> 00:55:31.377]  We know it.
[00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:33.798]  And then she says, they have to connect the dots.
[00:55:33.818 --> 00:55:36.199]  Well, if you know everything, why don't you connect the dots?
[00:55:36.419 --> 00:55:38.641]  You've been in government for 35 years.
[00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:40.341]  35 years too many.
[00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:41.182]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:55.016]  If the president had not gone all over the country praising him about the way he handled Hillary and the emails, they're trying to blame Democrats now as part of the reason why they made this decision.
[00:55:55.616 --> 00:55:56.237]  I love this.
[00:55:56.297 --> 00:55:58.538]  First of all, she just has a complete fallacy.
[00:55:58.598 --> 00:56:00.940]  Just makes it just a dream of hers.
[00:56:01.321 --> 00:56:04.023]  Trump is going all around the country praising Comey.
[00:56:04.343 --> 00:56:05.584]  Please show me that footage.
[00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:06.705]  I would love to see that.
[00:56:07.085 --> 00:56:13.008]  I'm not saying that Trump didn't have moments where he said he agreed with Comey or got along with Comey, but going all around the country praising Comey?
[00:56:13.808 --> 00:56:17.490]  I think if anything it would be the opposite, but there's Maxine Waters' reality for you.
[00:56:17.771 --> 00:56:20.292]  And then she says that they're blaming Democrats.
[00:56:21.012 --> 00:56:35.600]  So by holding Maxine Waters and Chuck Sumer and Harry Reid and all the Democrats that said James Comey needs to resign, James Comey's incompetent, by holding them to their word, by holding them accountable to their word, that is now blaming them.
[00:56:36.536 --> 00:56:40.182]  So you are now blaming somebody if you hold them accountable to their word.
[00:56:40.662 --> 00:56:41.484]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:44.628]  Let's roll to the final one from Maxine Waters, who's very confused.
[00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:45.895]  Understood.
[00:56:45.915 --> 00:56:51.937]  So if Hillary Clinton had won the White House, would you have recommended that she fire FBI Director James Comey?
[00:56:52.697 --> 00:56:53.937]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:56:54.397 --> 00:57:03.039]  If she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her, and what he tried to do, she should have fired him.
[00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:03.480]  Yes.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.620]  So she should have fired him, but he shouldn't have fired him.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.801]  This is why I'm confused.
[00:57:07.881 --> 00:57:09.621]  No, you're not confused.
[00:57:09.661 --> 00:57:09.941]  No.
[00:57:10.221 --> 00:57:13.062]  If the President is implicated in an investigation...
[00:57:14.335 --> 00:57:17.636]  So again, the MSNBC anchor calling out Maxine Waters.
[00:57:17.997 --> 00:57:18.997]  And he's like, I'm confused.
[00:57:19.017 --> 00:57:20.218]  Your answers are making no sense.
[00:57:20.238 --> 00:57:21.098]  You're clearly out of your mind.
[00:57:21.138 --> 00:57:22.919]  And she's like, no, you're not confused.
[00:57:24.179 --> 00:57:24.459]  Oh, okay.
[00:57:24.479 --> 00:57:25.920]  You're just telling me my emotions now.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.940]  But how do you like that?
[00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:32.523]  Hillary should have fired Trump, but, or Hillary should have fired Comey, but not Trump.
[00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:33.743]  Hmm.
[00:57:34.043 --> 00:57:34.404]  Okay.
[00:57:34.524 --> 00:57:36.585]  More double standards from Maxine Waters.
[00:57:36.705 --> 00:57:37.045]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:39.686]  Now, Elizabeth Warren had to pipe in.
[00:57:40.186 --> 00:57:41.687]  Let's go to Elizabeth Warren now.
[00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:45.444]  We've had enough of the partisanship here.
[00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:49.116]  This is now something that matters to every single American.
[00:57:49.619 --> 00:57:50.119]  Don't you love that?
[00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:52.121]  First of all, again, most Americans are sick of this.
[00:57:52.321 --> 00:57:52.941]  They're over this.
[00:57:53.162 --> 00:57:54.843]  But she's complaining about partisanship.
[00:57:55.403 --> 00:58:00.066]  This Russian collusion thing with Trump is the most partisan issue you've ever seen in your life!
[00:58:00.587 --> 00:58:01.588]  This is a witch hunt!
[00:58:01.868 --> 00:58:03.669]  It is the Democrats that are non-partisan.
[00:58:03.889 --> 00:58:07.312]  Trump has proved, no matter what he does, the Democrats are against it.
[00:58:07.592 --> 00:58:08.472]  Trump cures cancer?
[00:58:08.653 --> 00:58:09.833]  Democrats are against it.
[00:58:10.034 --> 00:58:11.715]  Trump ends homelessness?
[00:58:11.795 --> 00:58:12.716]  Democrats are against it.
[00:58:12.996 --> 00:58:14.277]  They are the partisan party.
[00:58:14.297 --> 00:58:15.638]  Can you believe Elizabeth Warren?
[00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.118]  What a fraud.
[00:58:16.318 --> 00:58:17.399]  Final clip from Elizabeth Warren.
[00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:19.811]  We need a special prosecutor right now.
[00:58:20.251 --> 00:58:22.751]  We need an independent investigation.
[00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:23.912]  Because it's not happening already.
[00:58:23.932 --> 00:58:25.712]  And to balance this relationship to the Russians.
[00:58:25.732 --> 00:58:26.493]  It's not been going on for months.
[00:58:26.513 --> 00:58:28.753]  Investigation that all of us can believe in.
[00:58:29.013 --> 00:58:29.733]  So let's get it.
[00:58:29.853 --> 00:58:31.074]  We can all believe in it.
[00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.034]  Let's do it right now.
[00:58:32.054 --> 00:58:33.435]  Let's have an independent special prosecutor.
[00:58:33.455 --> 00:58:34.635]  It's ongoing, but let's have it.
[00:58:35.175 --> 00:58:41.437]  Someone who can pursue this all the way down and find out exactly what the relationship is.
[00:58:42.037 --> 00:58:43.057]  Which they all claim they know.
[00:58:43.077 --> 00:58:43.878]  And the Russians.
[00:58:43.898 --> 00:58:45.798]  They all claim they know, but they can't tell you what it is.
[00:58:45.858 --> 00:58:46.819]  So let's please do.
[00:58:47.059 --> 00:58:47.659]  Let's have that.
[00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:48.399]  Let's have that.
[00:58:48.439 --> 00:58:50.060]  Let's find out what it is, because guess what?
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.720]  You're not going to find anything.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.521]  The investigation is ongoing, and you found nothing.
