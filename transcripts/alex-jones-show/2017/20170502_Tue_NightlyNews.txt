[00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.653]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.634]  It is Tuesday, May 2nd, 2017.
[00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.636]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and here is what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:38.344]  Tonight, in a powerful and emotional interview, an ex-banker talks about his experience with Luciferians and child sacrifice rituals.
[00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:46.305]  If you Google this, you'll find enough worldwide witness accounts to know this isn't a Walt Disney fairy tale.
[00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:52.731]  Unfortunately, the truth is, that worldwide they have been doing this for thousands of years.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.109]  Also, more George Soros ties, as it is revealed that Jared Kushner has loans tied to George Soros, dealings in which he did not disclose.
[00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.896]  Meanwhile, highlights from the Communist May Day protests, as protesters got violent and displayed their ignorance on current events.
[00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.620]  The term snowflake comes from Nazi Germany, when they would burn the Jews.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.303]  All that and more, tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.730]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.470]  I take this.
[00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.771]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:43.115]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:47.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.041]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.922]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:05.304]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.184]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.145]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.446]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:14.866]  I love it.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.629]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.810]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.778]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.420]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.882]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.703]  Well, I decided to start the news with the most shocking thing that I read today.
[00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:13.568]  Paul Joseph Watson has the story of an ex-banker who claims that he was invited to take part in child sacrifice rituals.
[00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.230]  Now, this is former Dutch banker Ronald Bernard.
[00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:26.156]  He gave a sit-down interview in which he claims that he was invited by members of the financial elite to participate in child sacrifice rituals.
[00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:28.337]  He was a successful entrepreneur.
[00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:31.618]  He ran a number of businesses before entering this world of finance.
[00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.242]  Upon doing so, he says he was told by his peers to put his conscience in the freezer.
[00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.664]  He said he was training to become a psychopath and he failed.
[00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:51.388]  And this is a 30-minute interview, but Watson only posted about a three-minute excerpt of this in which he talks about
[00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:57.991]  Being asked by these elitists to join in on a child sacrifice.
[00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.332]  Up until then, it was kind of all fun and games.
[00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:01.832]  He was going to these elite parties.
[00:04:01.872 --> 00:04:05.114]  There was a bunch of naked women running around and he thought, this is great!
[00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:12.597]  But, you know, they were really kind of gaming him into this ideology that the people out there are just useless parasites.
[00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:19.060]  And so, you know, it's okay if you can crash economies and destroy companies to enrich yourself.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.841]  So this is the type of deviant,
[00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:21.922]  It was the good life.
[00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:59.980]  But then at some point, I was invited, which is why I'm telling you all this, to participate in sacrifices abroad.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:12.790]  That was the breaking point.
[00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.131]  Children,
[00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:28.359]  The former banker went on to say that because he refused to participate in these child sacrifice rituals, he was then now a threat to the elite.
[00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:35.527]  And of course that this is the method that they use again and again to blackmail politicians all over the world.
[00:05:35.728 --> 00:05:37.430]  And when he was asked, he said, look,
[00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.891]  I know this sounds crazy, but this is real.
[00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:42.412]  And they've been doing this for thousands of years.
[00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:47.354]  This child sacrifice thing is something that Luciferians take very seriously.
[00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:58.319]  Even if you and I might not believe that there's any truth to power being gained or spirits being called upon by a child sacrifice, they truly do believe this thing.
[00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:05.722]  And at the very least, it's something that they use to blackmail politicians and others in their ranks.
[00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:14.815]  And Bernard went on to say that the people who do not underestimate the severity of this are but few.
[00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:20.818]  Because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts, it hates creation, it hates life.
[00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:21.998]  I think?
[00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:39.048]  I think so.
[00:06:59.389 --> 00:06:59.890]  I think so.
[00:07:17.768 --> 00:07:25.273]  Well, it turns out that the senior White House advisor, Jared Kushner, failed to disclose business dealings with George Soros.
[00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:26.013]  That's right.
[00:07:26.073 --> 00:07:30.216]  Now, we've reported on this as well when it came out in January.
[00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.330]  But he didn't.
[00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:42.395]  Kushner didn't include his ownership in a real estate finance company that makes him business partners with George Soros when he was filing financial disclosure forms.
[00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:44.796]  And this is the Wall Street Journal reporting this now.
[00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:51.538]  Kushner also failed to disclose loans totaling $1 billion from more than 20 lenders.
[00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:55.340]  And again, as it was reported in January,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.003]  Soros provided Cadre, which is a company owned by Trump's senior advisor, Jared Kushner.
[00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.884]  Soros invested $250 million.
[00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:07.025]  They gave him a $250 million line of credit.
[00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:20.031]  And this appears to be confirming Business Insider's reporting in 2016 that an unnamed wealthy New York-based family opened up a $250 million line of credit to Cadre.
[00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:22.793]  Soros lives in New York, so they're putting all the
[00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:25.415]  All of the links together there.
[00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:43.509]  And so, of course, this is not really going to sit well with people who voted for Trump and support Trump when you have someone whose business partners with the very anti-Trumper George Soros, who is paying a bunch of political operatives to go and protest his every move.
[00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.551]  So obviously, this isn't going to go over well with Trump's base.
[00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:55.659]  This real estate startup Cadre makes him business partners with not only George Soros, but also Peter Thiel and other billionaires.
[00:08:55.719 --> 00:09:09.650]  So that kind of goes to show you where Peter Thiel was coming from, where he was so vocally supportive, because he has a lot invested in Jared Kushner being there, getting in the White House with his father-in-law.
[00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.733]  So some very interesting details coming out.
[00:09:13.493 --> 00:09:19.335]  About Jared Kushner, David Knight is saying, come on Trump, it's time to dump Kushner and Ivanka.
[00:09:19.595 --> 00:09:20.215]  They gotta go.
[00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:28.178]  They've got to go because they are definitely putting in that leftist progressive buzz in Trump's ear.
[00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:30.258]  So that's not what the people voted for.
[00:09:30.338 --> 00:09:31.419]  You can't play both sides.
[00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:34.781]  Now some information is coming out.
[00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:45.169]  The Berkeley Unified School District is claiming that Berkeley riot organizers tried to brainwash students into left-wing activism.
[00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:57.578]  So they are saying that these far-left activists that were behind the recent anti-conservative riots in Berkeley tried to brainwash and indoctrinate students into supporting left-wing social justice causes.
[00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.501]  The group, by any means necessary,
[00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:01.301]  I think?
[00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:29.537]  Falarka frequently tried to bring students on school-sponsored trips to BAM-related activities.
[00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:33.300]  The district claimed those were attempts to indoctrinate the students.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:41.726]  Efforts to discipline Falarka were often derailed by student protesters who would disrupt disciplinary hearings in support of Falarka.
[00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:44.308]  So, really interesting there.
[00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:49.111]  And then this article goes on to point out how other BAM members are working as teachers.
[00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:53.993]  They've mixed their teaching roles with their activism for BAM.
[00:10:54.513 --> 00:11:05.256]  I'm not going to read off all of these instances here, but in December 2015, Nicole Conaway, she's a BAM organizer and a math teacher at East English Village Prep Academy in Detroit.
[00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:10.717]  She led a sick-out where teachers called in sick to protest the Republican Governor Rick Snyder.
[00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:16.699]  The sick-out forced six Detroit area schools to cancel classes that affected nearly 4,000 students.
[00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:21.721]  One month later, she led students in another school walkout.
[00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:32.606]  At Oakland Tech High School, teacher and band member Tanya Kappner worked with Polarka in January of this year to organize students and teachers in a walkout in protest of Trump.
[00:11:32.947 --> 00:11:36.468]  So here you can see they are mixing their political ideology with this
[00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.769]  Yes.
[00:11:56.312 --> 00:11:59.434]  These political operatives have infiltrated the classroom.
[00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:14.725]  As we can see, these kids come out with all this indoctrination and why they think communism is the greatest thing ever because they're learning from people like Yvette Falarca and other BAM members who are teaching your kids this total crap that communism is so great.
[00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:18.627]  But here's one potential teacher I wouldn't worry about.
[00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:25.833]  Rand Paul is going to be teaching a class on dystopia, and it has triggered a whole bunch of lefty college professors.
[00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:34.419]  They're saying it's troubling, it's political ideology in disguise, as if the entire freaking school curriculum wasn't political ideology in disguise.
[00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.101]  But if it's for the left, that's fine.
[00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:42.305]  You can indoctrinate students into this far-left progressive indoctrination, but if you want to
[00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:49.312]  Explain to them how these dystopic novels are actually coming true in real life and kind of tying it in with reality.
[00:12:49.732 --> 00:12:50.974]  No, we can't do that.
[00:12:51.214 --> 00:13:00.503]  We can't wake people up to 1984, for instance, where they can actually see this Orwellian doublespeak that the left is using.
[00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:02.465]  They can actually see that playing out in real life.
[00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:05.428]  So we know Senator Rand Paul is a libertarian.
[00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:12.533]  He plans to teach this course in dystopian literature this fall at the George Washington University in D.C.
[00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:17.657]  And these lefty professors are so triggered they say, he doesn't have the experience!
[00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:19.238]  Oh my goodness!
[00:13:19.938 --> 00:13:25.379]  He is going to be doing this, he'll be teaching this class while acting as a sitting U.S.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:25.900]  Senator.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.961]  I mean, what a valuable thing for students to be able to interact with a sitting U.S.
[00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:38.063]  Senator who is going to be just talking about these classic novels, works by authors such as Ayn Rand.
[00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:54.551]  Um, so he actually told Vice in 2013, to just kind of give you an example of maybe where this kind of came from, he said, I think dystopian novels are a discussion of politics and sort of what happens if you let a government accumulate too much power.
[00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:58.993]  And so of course, this is why these lefty professors are absolutely freaking out because they don't,
[00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:10.833]  They're like, we've worked so hard to indoctrinate students into wanting to give the government more power and to thinking communism is great, we don't need Rand Paul getting in there and red-pilling all of these students.
[00:14:11.864 --> 00:14:16.987]  And so of course, really their only complaint is that he isn't qualified to teach these novels.
[00:14:17.027 --> 00:14:21.670]  You really need to get someone in there who can just break it down and make it super boring for the students, frankly.
[00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:33.558]  So you can teach a class on Beyonce, or you can have Angelina Jolie show up at, where was she, teaching a master's level course at the London School of Economics.
[00:14:33.818 --> 00:14:35.660]  I mean, what experience does she have for that?
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.740]  That's totally fine.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.281]  But if you want to get a sitting U.S.
[00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:39.002]  Senator in there,
[00:14:39.502 --> 00:14:41.002]  To talk about dystopic novels.
[00:14:41.122 --> 00:14:41.863]  That's too much.
[00:14:42.043 --> 00:14:42.783]  That's too far.
[00:14:43.603 --> 00:14:51.285]  Well, now we are learning that Monsanto is accused of hiring an army of trolls to silence online dissent.
[00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:52.485]  Now, we know this.
[00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:59.127]  We've reported on this before with people who were actually victims of these online trolls constantly shutting down their Facebook activism.
[00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:10.554]  But now we're actually being able to see what they were doing because of some court documents that a judge just decided could be made publicly available.
[00:15:10.874 --> 00:15:17.597]  So now we're kind of getting an inside look at the truth behind these potential online trolls that were hired by Monsanto.
[00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:33.405]  So they're accused of hiring, through third parties, an army of internet trolls to counter negative comments while citing positive, ghost-written, pseudo-scientific reports which downplay the potential risks of their products.
[00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:39.028]  And so this is coming out of a pre-trial on 50 lawsuits against Monsanto.
[00:15:39.528 --> 00:15:52.496]  The plaintiffs allege that exposure to the biotech giant's flagship product Roundup caused them or their relatives to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma while Monsanto concealed the potential risks.
[00:15:52.516 --> 00:15:59.060]  So now we're seeing that these materials that the court decided could be released publicly
[00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:01.041]  I'm good.
[00:16:17.472 --> 00:16:20.095]  Deploy this army of trolls to just go after you.
[00:16:20.115 --> 00:16:22.998]  We've seen this again and again with, um, who else has done this?
[00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:32.247]  Hillary Clinton has an army of trolls that the second that you post something, some random person responds to you with, with something in support of them.
[00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:36.691]  And, uh, on a larger scale, Monsanto actually allegedly
[00:16:37.412 --> 00:16:51.463]  Funnels money to think tanks such as the Genetic Literacy Project and the American Council on Science and Health, which are organizations intended to shame scientists and highlight information that's helpful to Monsanto and other chemical producers.
[00:16:51.923 --> 00:17:03.752]  And they even have some emails that are back and forth between some Monsanto executives instructing the staff to ghostwrite articles and then have some independent scientists just sign their name.
[00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:04.532]  We're good to go.
[00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:31.833]  But here's something I wanted to get to here in the last minute and a half.
[00:17:31.933 --> 00:17:38.257]  It's something that everyone out there, especially if you're on Facebook or any of these, um, hey answer this quiz or this questionnaire.
[00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:40.999]  This is something that could affect a lot of people.
[00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:49.664]  They're pointing out specifically Facebook's 10 concerts meme and these other trends that could let people steal your identity.
[00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:52.025]  Anyone who might be
[00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:53.857]  Thank you.
[00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:20.596]  This could easily be used as a way of stealing your personal information, getting access to your bank accounts, and all of your most personal information.
[00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:29.281]  They go on to say that those same dangers lurk in many such quizzes that are on Facebook and other apps that might start asking you questions.
[00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:37.026]  Some might be more obviously about taking data, but others might just look like these innocent memes that your friends are passing around.
[00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:40.628]  Oh, what mythological creature are you?
[00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:45.690]  Where'd you have your first kiss or just these random things that you think is fun.
[00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:56.593]  You're just sharing information, but it's actually hackers and people out with nefarious means to be able to hack into you and learn all about your personal data.
[00:18:56.633 --> 00:18:57.213]  We'll stick around.
[00:18:57.253 --> 00:18:59.194]  We've got so much more coming right up after this.
[00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:09.362]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:09.562 --> 00:19:15.987]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.207 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.397]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.519]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.344]  It works!
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:48.907]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:58.509]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.330]  A total 360 win!
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.192]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:04.252]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.438]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.119]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:21.699]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:28.943]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:36.767]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.289]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.915]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.038]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.740]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.321]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.522]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.542 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.934]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.238]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.462]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:28.144]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:33.349]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:37.112]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.152 --> 00:21:44.920]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.323]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my feet.
[00:21:48.363 --> 00:21:49.784]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.845 --> 00:21:58.212]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action, no fear, nothing, so.
[00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.462]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:08.843]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:20.105]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go onto our store and donate.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.405]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:27.546]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.047]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:33.287]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.389]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.750]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.631]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:53.132]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.679]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:27.582]  So what's going on today?
[00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:29.784]  You guys are making me laugh.
[00:23:30.065 --> 00:23:31.366]  Oh yeah, look at that.
[00:23:31.426 --> 00:23:33.348]  Did you have to spray anybody today?
[00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:55.691]  What they haven't learned is that this is a bastion of free speech here, and we're allowing these people to walk up and down, and they're celebrating people who are oppressive and who kill people.
[00:23:56.232 --> 00:24:00.894]  Communist regimes have killed millions, if not hundreds of thousands of people, and here they are celebrating.
[00:24:00.995 --> 00:24:02.796]  And fascist regimes, and communist regimes.
[00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:05.037]  They admitted that they're fascist and Nazis.
[00:24:05.297 --> 00:24:06.198]  I think they're joking.
[00:24:07.287 --> 00:24:09.189]  But you guys aren't joking, that's the funny thing.
[00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:10.670]  You're very serious about what you're doing.
[00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.312]  They're not joking about being racist.
[00:24:12.332 --> 00:24:13.293]  You know what's funny?
[00:24:13.313 --> 00:24:14.234]  He's got the racist symbol.
[00:24:14.274 --> 00:24:15.074]  Oh my god, look!
[00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:16.836]  Oh, we found the racist symbol!
[00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:17.517]  Look at that!
[00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:20.439]  Oh yeah, we're... We've been seeing Nazi symbols all day.
[00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:23.362]  The frog is a Nazi symbol, you got... Yes, yes it is.
[00:24:23.382 --> 00:24:23.702]  ISOLATION!
[00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.446]  How many people do you want to kill with your revolution?
[00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:30.807]  Good.
[00:24:31.447 --> 00:24:32.948]  What are you protesting today?
[00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:34.969]  We're protesting capitalism.
[00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:36.230]  The evils.
[00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.351]  The evils of capitalism.
[00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:38.532]  It's terrible.
[00:24:38.952 --> 00:24:40.593]  And what are you going to replace it with?
[00:24:41.113 --> 00:24:41.674]  Communism.
[00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:45.036]  How many people are you going to kill to replace it with communism?
[00:24:46.974 --> 00:24:47.854]  Plenty means necessary.
[00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:49.075]  Plenty means necessary.
[00:24:50.276 --> 00:24:52.657]  Oh yeah, we're also replacing the First Amendment.
[00:24:54.098 --> 00:24:54.718]  No more hate speech.
[00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:55.559]  No First Amendment.
[00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:56.619]  No more hate speech.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.761]  The term snowflake comes from Nazi Germany.
[00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:02.983]  When they would burn the Jews, the ashes that would fall, they would call them snowflakes.
[00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:06.219]  Here they come, now they're all holding hands again.
[00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:07.441]  This is how they have to cross the street.
[00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:10.726]  They've been... I guess they've taught... Listen to their parents, they're all holding hands.
[00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:12.789]  We resist, we must.
[00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.976]  We must and we will much about that be committed.
[00:25:20.407 --> 00:25:21.748]  How would they survive in Venezuela?
[00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:22.729]  You think they'd make it long?
[00:25:23.169 --> 00:25:30.375]  Um, I think that they would start eating the rats first, but then once they ran out of rats, they'd start eating each other, and then they'd probably, I don't know, like, die.
[00:25:30.895 --> 00:25:32.897]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:33.037 --> 00:25:34.478]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:34.498 --> 00:25:36.019]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:37.701]  But you guys are the only ones wearing masks.
[00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:39.082]  Didn't the Klan wear masks?
[00:25:39.182 --> 00:25:41.243]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:41.263 --> 00:25:43.705]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:43.745 --> 00:25:44.786]  Klan like to wear masks.
[00:25:45.367 --> 00:25:47.108]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:49.373]  Why are you wearing masks like the Klan?
[00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:51.516]  Cops and Klan go hand in hand!
[00:25:51.536 --> 00:25:53.699]  Whose streets?
[00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:55.060]  Our streets!
[00:26:09.062 --> 00:26:17.585]  History shows no amount of propaganda, no amount of intimidation will work once the general population is awakened and culturally focused against it.
[00:26:18.486 --> 00:26:27.089]  Ivanka Trump goes to a UN Women's Summit in Berlin and breaks with her father because it's a women's rights issue.
[00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:28.509]  She says bring in refugees.
[00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.710]  Isn't that funny?
[00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.550]  For the women!
[00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.832]  80% according to Interpol of the migrants are military age men.
[00:26:36.492 --> 00:26:37.112]  Close to 90% are
[00:26:39.215 --> 00:26:39.835]  I don't think so.
[00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:02.146]  Is it Trump playing good cop, bad cop?
[00:27:02.947 --> 00:27:05.968]  He has tried to stop the seven nations where they don't vet anybody.
[00:27:06.008 --> 00:27:09.509]  They just give them fake passports like Somalia, Sudan and others.
[00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:15.851]  But now she's challenging the president, her own father, to change his policies.
[00:27:16.451 --> 00:27:17.791]  This is just ridiculous.
[00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:19.532]  We did not elect Ivanka Trump.
[00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:25.432]  We did not elect her Democratic Party husband, Jared Kushner.
[00:27:25.452 --> 00:27:29.315]  Their family was doing private business with the Chinese.
[00:27:29.536 --> 00:27:40.324]  From a counterintelligence point of view, Kushner and many of those civilians there are really prime targets for foreign governments in terms of manipulation and leveraging.
[00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:48.591]  In this case, Kushner is a highly valuable target for the Chinese, for the Russians, for the Malaysians, for the Arabs.
[00:27:49.011 --> 00:27:53.477]  In the same way that many of the other civilians are in the Republican Party.
[00:27:53.678 --> 00:27:54.399]  They know it.
[00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:55.220]  I know it.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.122]  The intelligence community knows that.
[00:27:57.262 --> 00:27:58.124]  That's a cover story.
[00:28:04.812 --> 00:28:16.743]  So is Trump elevating him to actually protect him and cover him?
[00:28:17.043 --> 00:28:21.808]  Because this sounds like a very bad judgment by Trump, knowing this is all going on and including him in the White House.
[00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:26.336]  You once asked me, why did Trump keep his whole family there?
[00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:34.002]  And I simply said, as a psychiatrist or as an American, he needs it for security, his own sense of security.
[00:28:34.182 --> 00:28:36.945]  Now, that said, we're 100 days now into the Trump administration.
[00:28:37.965 --> 00:28:41.108]  And it's a love-hate relationship, personally.
[00:28:41.668 --> 00:28:42.549]  It's paradoxical.
[00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:49.975]  We started hearing rumblings the last month that the new CIA director and the new attorney general were going to make their big focus leaks.
[00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:55.762]  Now, the president has said leaks in the White House, leaks in Congress, leaks in the intelligence agencies.
[00:28:57.264 --> 00:28:59.507]  People leaking on his meetings every day.
[00:29:00.148 --> 00:29:02.310]  Oh, Jared Kushner's not going to get in trouble.
[00:29:02.591 --> 00:29:03.252]  We've confirmed.
[00:29:03.272 --> 00:29:04.754]  We've got the copies of the text messages.
[00:29:05.374 --> 00:29:06.235]  Oh, yeah, we've got them all.
[00:29:07.157 --> 00:29:08.779]  That's why they didn't deny it when it all came out.
[00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:15.586]  Well, I don't question Jared Kushner's loyalty to the President, but I do question his vision.
[00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:22.271]  Alex, he's a liberal Democrat from a very prominent family of liberal Democrats in New Jersey.
[00:29:22.791 --> 00:29:26.194]  I don't think he understands the Trump coalition.
[00:29:26.214 --> 00:29:27.595]  Well, does he understand family?
[00:29:27.795 --> 00:29:30.137]  And if he wants to be in that administration, he'll do what the President wants?
[00:29:30.297 --> 00:29:31.278]  That he's not the President?
[00:29:31.418 --> 00:29:32.199]  Does he understand that?
[00:29:32.879 --> 00:29:39.121]  Well, I think at this point he probably believes he is giving the President good advice when in fact he's giving him bad advice.
[00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:46.522]  I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on motive, but Alex, he doesn't understand the InfoWars Watcher.
[00:29:46.903 --> 00:29:49.163]  He doesn't understand the Breitbart Reader.
[00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:51.644]  We are the backbone of the Trump Revolution.
[00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:54.024]  We are the soldiers who won this election.
[00:29:54.444 --> 00:30:00.146]  And we do not want to see the Revolution hijacked by a bunch of establishment Republican geeks.
[00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:10.690]  Imagine with the pedophile rings getting rounded up, and the borders getting secured, and the first hundred days, a lot of good economic things that are happening, a lot of amazing things like TPP getting killed.
[00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.291]  Trump is an American president.
[00:30:12.351 --> 00:30:13.871]  He is actually acting as president.
[00:30:15.132 --> 00:30:18.333]  Doing some things I don't like, doing a lot of things I love, but he's being the president.
[00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:19.734]  So that's the big positive.
[00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:27.012]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know that InfoWars is under attack.
[00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:29.714]  You know that free speech is under attack.
[00:30:29.754 --> 00:30:33.417]  And you know that we are the tip of the spear here at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:37.560]  So what are we going to do in response to this attack on liberty and free speech?
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.001]  We're going to go live.
[00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:44.346]  For 30 hours, starting with the Alex Jones Show on Wednesday at 11 a.m.
[00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:48.831]  Central, we begin our 30-hour Defense of Liberty special.
[00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:52.995]  It kicks off with Alex Jones and it will roll all the way through Thursday.
[00:30:53.015 --> 00:30:55.858]  We're going to have all kinds of great guests all through the day.
[00:30:56.238 --> 00:31:03.562]  Great interview scheduled for you, and don't forget about the great specials that we are going to be running at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:03.983 --> 00:31:06.964]  Life-changing products, life-changing broadcasts.
[00:31:07.264 --> 00:31:12.988]  It all starts with you going to InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:16.930]  Support our 30-hour Defense of Liberty special.
[00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.591]  We're not going to go away, folks.
[00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:25.474]  When they try to attack InfoWars.com, when they try to attack your free speech, we all have to stand up together.
[00:31:25.794 --> 00:31:26.954]  Let your voice be heard.
[00:31:27.235 --> 00:31:35.719]  Tune in to the InfoWars.com slash show, 30-hour Defense of Liberty special, and give us your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:40.881]  Put your thumb in the eye of the globalists by supporting the tip of the spear.
[00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:41.723]  We're good.
[00:31:53.482 --> 00:31:56.964]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:31:57.024 --> 00:32:00.425]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:05.307]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:32:05.447 --> 00:32:08.228]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:32:08.348 --> 00:32:14.271]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:14.491 --> 00:32:18.073]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:18.513 --> 00:32:21.094]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:21.194 --> 00:32:29.718]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:39.506]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:39.606 --> 00:32:44.747]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:45.247 --> 00:32:48.948]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:49.028 --> 00:32:51.049]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:53.550]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.990]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.431]  InfoWars.com
[00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:03.977]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.057 --> 00:33:04.998]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.138 --> 00:33:06.579]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.879 --> 00:33:07.700]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.621]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:11.224]  Dr. Group, the new product, will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.444 --> 00:33:13.145]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.185 --> 00:33:16.769]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:23.856]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.997]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.037 --> 00:36:58.798]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.919 --> 00:36:59.880]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:06.104 --> 00:37:10.427]  Well, we saw May Day protests get violent and out of control around the globe.
[00:37:10.487 --> 00:37:13.129]  We had our own little experience here in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:24.578]  We sent the marvelous Millie Weaver out there, totally fearless, getting in the face of these Antifa protesters that were out in full effect here in Austin, Texas for May Day.
[00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:27.020]  Millie, tell us about your experience.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.482]  I really have no idea how you have such patience with these people.
[00:37:31.343 --> 00:37:33.385]  Well, it was pretty crazy Leanne.
[00:37:33.445 --> 00:37:36.048]  Things started out a little bit more mild.
[00:37:36.508 --> 00:37:46.699]  We first went to the visitor center of the governor's office where these protesters had taken over that public building and they were linked arm-in-arm.
[00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:49.001]  They were not allowing people in, which is against the law.
[00:37:49.802 --> 00:37:54.765]  Um, they were then arrested subsequently and the police had arrested a bunch of them.
[00:37:55.126 --> 00:38:09.736]  They had their lawyer come out saying how they were arrested for expressing their first amendment, when in reality they were actually arrested for breaking a law which is blocking members of the public from entering a public building.
[00:38:10.316 --> 00:38:29.180]  Right, so things kind of went from there over another group of commies were actually down marching along the street and there were a lot of Trump supporters, supporters of the American government, they had their American flags, they were just out there trying to make sure that
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.240]  Peace was kept.
[00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:42.568]  If these commie protesters started looting, rioting, bashing windows, setting things on fire, hurting people, they were going to be there to stop it because they don't want to see their city go up in flames like we've seen with Paris.
[00:38:42.728 --> 00:38:45.190]  Right, well this isn't Berkeley, California.
[00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:53.375]  This is an open carry state and we have a lot of people here who don't want to see this great state of Texas
[00:38:53.855 --> 00:38:57.260]  Even this little blue dot on the map there here in Austin, Texas.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.045]  They don't want to see it turned over to these little anarchist groups.
[00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:04.910]  So what were some of the arguments that you were hearing being made?
[00:39:05.782 --> 00:39:11.168]  Well, what was kind of interesting is we kept trying to talk to the commies.
[00:39:11.688 --> 00:39:14.951]  You know, I was sincerely trying to have open discussion with them.
[00:39:15.012 --> 00:39:18.315]  I was trying to find out, how have you been slighted?
[00:39:18.335 --> 00:39:24.081]  How has the system failed you to where you want to just throw the entire system away of government that we have?
[00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:28.928]  And try for this communist government that you think is going to be your utopia.
[00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:30.209]  Like, where did it go wrong?
[00:39:30.249 --> 00:39:30.830]  What happened?
[00:39:31.251 --> 00:39:34.035]  Seems to be that a lot of these are college kids.
[00:39:34.435 --> 00:39:37.079]  I mean, I even asked, you know, who all goes to UT?
[00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:38.401]  Somebody even raised their hand.
[00:39:39.022 --> 00:39:40.664]  They're so used to being in class.
[00:39:41.565 --> 00:39:53.796]  And that's really what it was, but anytime we started having dialogue that was actually constructive and beneficial, their commie leaders would come in and say, Comrade!
[00:39:53.836 --> 00:39:54.236]  Comrade!
[00:39:54.276 --> 00:39:54.796]  Get back here!
[00:39:54.857 --> 00:39:55.577]  Don't talk to them!
[00:39:56.098 --> 00:39:57.098]  So they had like...
[00:39:57.819 --> 00:40:01.880]  They're commie leaders trying to prevent them from having dialogue.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.740]  And some of the leaders were actually older.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.501]  Like, you could see that they were probably professors.
[00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:08.601]  Yeah, they're like, don't break the conditioning.
[00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:12.282]  We've worked really hard to make sure that we've indoctrinated you, comrade.
[00:40:12.682 --> 00:40:17.783]  So we don't need you talking to these people who might bring a little bit of information to you.
[00:40:17.823 --> 00:40:23.344]  Just like when we were engaging some of these same Antifa protesters there at the RNC and then saying,
[00:40:23.684 --> 00:40:24.925]  Well, what is your endgame?
[00:40:24.965 --> 00:40:26.086]  What's your ultimate goal?
[00:40:26.207 --> 00:40:31.692]  And then finally, you know, you break them down, keep pushing and speaking to them in a way that you're open to their ideas.
[00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:36.737]  So then at the end, they will openly say, well, yes, it is communism.
[00:40:36.797 --> 00:40:38.739]  And then you're you're just thinking, but that's failed.
[00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.239]  It's failed.
[00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:40.541]  How do you overlook the
[00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:48.086]  Hundreds of millions of people who've had to be killed in order for that system to work, but it, you know, actually doesn't work at all.
[00:40:48.427 --> 00:40:49.567]  And they have no excuse for it.
[00:40:49.607 --> 00:40:55.332]  So basically, we're seeing that they are being taught by their professors who, you point out, a lot of them were there in attendance.
[00:40:56.433 --> 00:41:00.716]  They're learning about just like a very biased version of communism.
[00:41:00.996 --> 00:41:01.577]  Exactly.
[00:41:01.697 --> 00:41:03.679]  And a lot of them tended to be millennials.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:10.006]  And a lot of them actually said, well, this system of capitalism is failing us.
[00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:11.988]  That was what was really interesting.
[00:41:12.008 --> 00:41:13.610]  We're like, communism has failed.
[00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.351]  It's always failed.
[00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:17.575]  And their reply was, well, capitalism is failing us.
[00:41:18.055 --> 00:41:19.156]  So we've got to really look at it.
[00:41:19.716 --> 00:41:22.177]  And that's a good distinction to make.
[00:41:22.577 --> 00:41:25.579]  It is crony capitalism that is failing this country.
[00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:29.321]  We don't have a pure capitalist system that's going on right now.
[00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:34.803]  So I completely understand where some of the arguments are coming from, but they're not making that distinction.
[00:41:35.104 --> 00:41:39.786]  And so they're just wanting to throw it all away and just go straight to communism, which is mental.
[00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:40.546]  That's right.
[00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:44.228]  And many of these kids grew up with only knowing Bush.
[00:41:44.608 --> 00:41:47.030]  You know, Bush was in office and then Obama was in office.
[00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.793]  So they saw the Republicans fail the Americans and then they saw the Democrats through Obama fail the Americans.
[00:41:53.153 --> 00:41:57.676]  So I think they feel like none of it is really going to work for them or be beneficial for them.
[00:41:57.776 --> 00:42:03.659]  And a lot of this is just based out of ignorance and they don't know, they don't speak with their elders, they don't speak with other generations.
[00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:04.239]  That's
[00:42:23.308 --> 00:42:24.229]  I don't know.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:41.980]  Yes.
[00:42:57.539 --> 00:42:58.180]  We're good to go.
[00:43:15.487 --> 00:43:25.851]  I don't even want to explain to people what the history is there of it, but there's actually an article out that it's called, Seven Ways to Respond to Being Called a Snowflake.
[00:43:26.031 --> 00:43:30.272]  And one of the things it gives you is to say, oh, well, you know, that's a Nazi term.
[00:43:30.352 --> 00:43:41.176]  And then you give them the history behind it, even though we know it's not true, but it'll still disarm these people so that then they'll feel bad about calling you snowflake because they think that it's a Nazi term, which it's not.
[00:43:41.256 --> 00:43:43.317]  Even Snopes has debunked that.
[00:43:44.077 --> 00:43:46.721]  You know, even Snope says, no, that's not true.
[00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:53.548]  But it was interesting to see that here this guy used it with you, and he probably didn't even know that it's not true.
[00:43:53.608 --> 00:43:54.469]  He thinks it's true.
[00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.876]  And that's why all these people are going out there thinking that they truly are fighting against the Nazis.
[00:44:00.296 --> 00:44:15.219]  Well, the leaders within these common groups, a lot of them being people of seniority and even, you know, we suspect professors, they are continually perpetuating these myths and these lies.
[00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:23.920]  And these students, these people, these commies, they believe it wholeheartedly without fact-checking, without actually doing their own research.
[00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:26.401]  And then that leads to being indoctrinated.
[00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:26.981]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.771]  Oh yeah, the OK sign.
[00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:58.339]  The OK sign, where all of a sudden it's become this big conspiracy that all of these people doing this OK sign are part of some white supremacist cult and it's just simply not true.
[00:44:58.759 --> 00:45:03.763]  Yeah, and I'm sure there are some people that say, oh well that's clever, yeah, that does mean...
[00:45:04.944 --> 00:45:20.414]  Everyone that's giving the okay sign is not throwing up a white supremacy hand signal, secret hand signal, but it's just, it's so interesting how those types of memes spread and people, as long as it agrees with their perspective of reality, they'll buy it.
[00:45:20.695 --> 00:45:26.779]  They don't even have to second guess it or question that or say, you know what, I've seen that okay hand symbol for my whole life growing up.
[00:45:26.859 --> 00:45:29.640]  I don't, you know, I've seen Jay-Z and Beyonce throw it.
[00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:30.401]  Let me just double
[00:45:30.521 --> 00:45:33.943]  Well, they're so quick to believe it without even doing the research.
[00:45:33.983 --> 00:45:45.268]  And another thing that was actually interesting was at this rally or at this march where you had the commies there, you had a lot of people there, Trump supporters, supporters of the First Amendment, supporters of America.
[00:45:45.748 --> 00:45:52.511]  And out of the entire crowd of these, you know, Trump supporters or conservative supporters that were out there,
[00:45:53.471 --> 00:46:00.993]  Only two of them were provocateurs out there shouting racist, actual racist statements.
[00:46:01.053 --> 00:46:07.335]  I mean, they were actually saying, you know, all, you know, Jewish people should die, and they were actually, they were doing the Hitler sign.
[00:46:07.355 --> 00:46:16.137]  Well, and we- So there were, there were some, and I actually got in a fight with one of these guys, an argument, because he's like, I'm a fascist, you actually think these commies should have the right to vote?
[00:46:16.197 --> 00:46:19.518]  I said, they have the right to vote just as much as you have the right to vote.
[00:46:19.958 --> 00:46:26.162]  They have the right to express their First Amendment just as much as you have the right to express your ludicrous ideas.
[00:46:26.422 --> 00:46:32.266]  So I got in with it just as much with the fascist guy because fascism is bad and communism is bad.
[00:46:32.466 --> 00:46:32.666]  Right.
[00:46:32.946 --> 00:46:35.508]  Trying to shut down anybody's First Amendment is absolutely bad.
[00:46:35.788 --> 00:46:41.332]  They're trying to rewrite the First Amendment as we speak so that it can exclude any kind of
[00:46:42.092 --> 00:46:47.713]  hurtful terms, which of course are the offense of the day to these social justice warriors.
[00:46:48.053 --> 00:46:55.215]  Millie, thank you so much for being brave to stick it out there with these people and to actually have the patience to open up a dialogue with them because that's what we need.
[00:46:55.235 --> 00:46:56.675]  We don't need the back and forth fighting.
[00:46:56.715 --> 00:46:57.555]  We need to talk.
[00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:58.435]  And you know what?
[00:46:58.535 --> 00:47:00.636]  We might not have that much different.
[00:47:02.996 --> 00:47:07.717]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.514]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.060]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.341]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:01.502]  Welcome to Miss Wild Game, y'all.
[00:49:10.595 --> 00:49:16.778]  This is the first ever show created to call out all these Insta-famous Huntress girls.
[00:49:18.139 --> 00:49:21.821]  We've designed a competition that's going to put these girls to the real test.
[00:49:23.241 --> 00:49:26.583]  To win Miss Wild Game's sample, get a buck down.
[00:49:27.063 --> 00:49:31.546]  When the dust settles, there will be a Miss Wild Game awarded on this show.
[00:49:32.966 --> 00:49:35.328]  Miss Wild Game, series premiere, May 11.
[00:49:36.954 --> 00:49:39.436]  And joining me in studio now is Liberty Austin.
[00:49:39.496 --> 00:49:42.518]  She is one of the contestants there on Miss Wild Game.
[00:49:42.778 --> 00:49:46.101]  Liberty is also a writer for TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[00:49:46.801 --> 00:49:54.427]  As you can see, she's a hunter, a Second Amendment advocate, outdoor aficionado, very pro-America.
[00:49:54.707 --> 00:50:01.653]  And you've actually skyrocketed to social media success because people said, wow, look at this beautiful woman who's very
[00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.054]  Quintessential God, guns, and liberty.
[00:50:05.154 --> 00:50:07.676]  And I love that you put that out there on your social media.
[00:50:07.696 --> 00:50:16.300]  You're very outspoken in support of America, support of our troops, and you don't really worry about maybe offending some of the snowflakes out there, which I love.
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.602]  So tell us a little bit about what we can expect with the show and where people can watch.
[00:50:21.002 --> 00:50:21.322]  Okay.
[00:50:21.362 --> 00:50:27.046]  So Miss Wild Game, we taped it last year and it's going to be premiering on the Outdoor Channel on May 11th.
[00:50:27.687 --> 00:50:29.908]  So I'm really excited.
[00:50:29.928 --> 00:50:31.329]  I can't wait for everybody to see it.
[00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.731]  But it's definitely going to be a good time.
[00:50:35.452 --> 00:50:41.196]  Well, I follow you on social media and your posts get pretty savage during hunting season.
[00:50:41.316 --> 00:50:43.417]  So you are not just a spokesmodel.
[00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:44.578]  You are like living it.
[00:50:44.618 --> 00:50:49.361]  You're like, as Alex always says, skin a buck and run a trout line.
[00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:49.961]  Like that's you.
[00:50:50.162 --> 00:50:50.762]  You live it.
[00:50:51.082 --> 00:50:51.943]  Yes, definitely.
[00:50:52.703 --> 00:50:53.524]  I definitely do.
[00:50:53.984 --> 00:51:04.130]  And I do get a lot of heat for it online, definitely on my social media outlets for hunting from the anti-hunters and just anti-gun people as well.
[00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.631]  Yeah, I know.
[00:51:05.711 --> 00:51:06.052]  Me too.
[00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:07.793]  I'm always kind of posting like sad...
[00:51:09.056 --> 00:51:11.258]  Crying cats on some of your posts and things.
[00:51:11.498 --> 00:51:20.487]  Although, you know, since Trump won, I've seen less of the anti-hunting posts, which I'm kind of wondering what kind of happened that I'm kind of getting less of that.
[00:51:20.627 --> 00:51:22.929]  Yeah, people realize it's not working.
[00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:24.630]  Maybe they're still crying about it.
[00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.151]  I'm not sure.
[00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:30.195]  So you also write a weekly hunting digest for The Truth About Guns.
[00:51:30.376 --> 00:51:32.157]  So what sort of topics do you get into?
[00:51:33.278 --> 00:51:49.965]  So, I do write a weekly digest for The Truth About Guns and kind of topics that I do on the digest are just the latest news, just whatever is current out there, great products, just different stories, just ways for you to connect to hunting if you're not even a hunter.
[00:51:50.925 --> 00:51:55.526]  And so obviously one of the big stories happened right here in Austin, Texas yesterday.
[00:51:55.886 --> 00:52:05.349]  We had a stabbing at the University of Texas, and of course UT was very much in the news in the last couple of years because they were trying to push for campus carry.
[00:52:05.369 --> 00:52:17.432]  So now you're sort of seeing this argument with the campus carry advocates saying, well, you know, there you go, you should have had a gun, but you know, also there's an argument that who would have been ready for something like that?
[00:52:17.572 --> 00:52:18.992]  So talk to us a little bit about
[00:52:19.412 --> 00:52:25.855]  Well, I'm not sure the entire story, but from what I understand, the one boy that was attacked was from behind.
[00:52:26.075 --> 00:52:32.418]  I mean, and I think that obviously carrying your gun and learning firearm safety is a priority.
[00:52:32.758 --> 00:52:34.579]  But then there's also situational awareness.
[00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:36.420]  So we can't drop our guards.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.782]  And as gun owners, I think that what I like to talk to women about is constantly be aware of your surroundings.
[00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:47.605]  You know, there's that one second that somebody's going to walk up behind you and you may not have time to pull your gun, even if you had it.
[00:52:48.645 --> 00:52:51.309]  Definitely, situational awareness was an issue there.
[00:52:51.629 --> 00:52:52.510]  Obviously, the kid.
[00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.333]  He's not really thinking.
[00:52:54.353 --> 00:52:56.576]  He's trying to get a walkover from the truck.
[00:52:58.057 --> 00:52:59.639]  Yeah, definitely that's what I thought of first.
[00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:03.031]  I couldn't have helped it regardless of what everybody is saying.
[00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:03.511]  Right.
[00:53:03.671 --> 00:53:06.133]  And what's your stance on the campus carry?
[00:53:06.153 --> 00:53:11.636]  Yeah, my stance on the campus carry is we should definitely be able to do that.
[00:53:12.357 --> 00:53:21.743]  I think it's just so important that our children are able to protect themselves as well, especially in such a volatile environment like a campus that's known for partying and
[00:53:22.247 --> 00:53:22.527]  I don't know.
[00:53:38.302 --> 00:53:40.162]  Well, definitely situational awareness.
[00:53:40.222 --> 00:53:42.383]  Be aware of your surroundings at all times.
[00:53:42.843 --> 00:53:43.863]  Never drop your guard.
[00:53:44.823 --> 00:53:54.245]  Just one of the things I practice now, I don't know if I'm just more paranoid than normal, but I'm constantly just looking at exits and people who are walking in, never having my back to the door.
[00:53:54.786 --> 00:53:59.246]  Obviously, it's not all the time that you can do that, but for the most part, it has to become a way of life.
[00:53:59.947 --> 00:54:01.487]  So, definitely how I live my life.
[00:54:01.867 --> 00:54:02.447]  Absolutely.
[00:54:02.928 --> 00:54:09.130]  What do you think about President Trump and his job so far, the first 100 days?
[00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:17.793]  Well, I think he's doing a fabulous job, and I believe that he is the embodiment of the American dream.
[00:54:17.853 --> 00:54:24.276]  I mean, he wasn't in politics before, and I think he's showing everybody what hard work can do, and he's definitely
[00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:30.532]  An inspiration to me, just somebody that's achieving something through hard work.
[00:54:30.612 --> 00:54:33.573]  So I'm definitely happy with what's going on so far.
[00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:35.513]  And where do you find the time?
[00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:51.956]  I'm seeing constantly that you are going out to different events to support the troops and to just kind of hold these open forums for women and other people who might not traditionally go towards guns and hunting and things like that.
[00:54:52.677 --> 00:54:54.897]  Tell us a little bit about some of these things that you're involved with.
[00:54:55.373 --> 00:54:56.474]  The Clay Shoot and all.
[00:55:10.023 --> 00:55:13.665]  Any veteran-owned companies attend any veteran events.
[00:55:14.146 --> 00:55:19.409]  It's definitely my heart where it's at, just definitely supporting our troops and just letting them know we love them.
[00:55:19.969 --> 00:55:23.672]  And I, by the way, I love getting messages from troops that are deployed.
[00:55:23.692 --> 00:55:26.994]  I get these little messages from them, makes me totally happy.
[00:55:27.054 --> 00:55:29.095]  So I'm definitely grateful for that as well.
[00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:36.017]  And what was it like, just kind of getting back to the show, we've got just a few more minutes here, and I want to make sure that people tune into the show.
[00:55:36.097 --> 00:55:37.679]  It's going to premiere May 11th?
[00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:38.359]  May 11th, yeah.
[00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:39.240]  On the Outdoor Channel.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.182]  But what was it like working with some of these other girls?
[00:55:42.522 --> 00:55:49.087]  Were they all as experienced as you were, or was it kind of, was the show taking these women on social media and putting them to the test?
[00:55:49.687 --> 00:55:51.068]  Can you really do this?
[00:55:52.108 --> 00:55:53.709]  Those girls brought it, let me tell you.
[00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:56.150]  Definitely Miss Iowa over there.
[00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.812]  I was like, wow, she's comparable to Texans.
[00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:03.674]  She's just rough and definitely competitive.
[00:56:03.814 --> 00:56:08.876]  And the other girl, Nikki, I believe she's from Alabama, but she's just the sweetest girl ever.
[00:56:09.997 --> 00:56:14.099]  So yeah, I just formed bonds and definitely had a great time with those girls.
[00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:15.920]  I learned a lot from them as well.
[00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:17.822]  So we're all strong women.
[00:56:17.842 --> 00:56:18.963]  Definitely.
[00:56:18.983 --> 00:56:22.987]  I thought we were going to butt heads, but you'll have to see.
[00:56:23.007 --> 00:56:23.148]  Yeah.
[00:56:23.168 --> 00:56:24.349]  Maybe they do butt heads.
[00:56:24.409 --> 00:56:24.869]  I don't know.
[00:56:24.929 --> 00:56:26.591]  It makes for some exciting television.
[00:56:26.631 --> 00:56:27.292]  That's for sure.
[00:56:27.672 --> 00:56:29.474]  Well, what do you want to say to any women out there?
[00:56:29.494 --> 00:56:34.839]  Any people who might be a little bit offended by that kind of a lifestyle?
[00:56:34.859 --> 00:56:37.382]  You know, what do you want people, what's the like misperception?
[00:56:38.308 --> 00:56:43.492]  Well, I think the misperception is a lot of the comments I get are, why don't you just go buy it at the grocery store?
[00:56:43.552 --> 00:56:45.293]  Well, that's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
[00:56:45.313 --> 00:56:52.519]  I just think it's a beautiful tradition that needs to be definitely carried on to the generations to come.
[00:56:52.579 --> 00:56:56.522]  And hunters are the biggest conservationists on the planet.
[00:56:56.682 --> 00:56:59.064]  And so, you know, we need a little bit of respect for that.
[00:56:59.604 --> 00:57:03.327]  You know, check your numbers, get educated on what it is that we actually do and provide.
[00:57:03.807 --> 00:57:04.008]  Absolutely.
[00:57:04.028 --> 00:57:05.429]  And so where can people go for more information?
[00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:07.791]  Where would you really like to, for the public to kind of reach out and connect with you?
[00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:24.609]  Well, I'm going to be launching a website soon, so definitely look out for that.
[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:26.232]  But read my blog.
[00:57:26.892 --> 00:57:37.627]  I love to write, and right now that's kind of my passion, so definitely check out my blog and The Truth About Guns, and check out my weekly digest, and also leave me any suggestions that you'd like me to write about.
[00:57:38.957 --> 00:57:56.074]  And I guess one more, we've got time for one more question, because I know President Trump, he just recently spoke there at the NRA, and he's reassuring gun owners here in this country that he is absolutely going to stand by his campaign promise and protect the Second Amendment, not going to let anyone, you know, get after that.
[00:57:56.474 --> 00:57:58.256]  What do you want to say to him if he's watching this right now?
[00:57:58.716 --> 00:58:00.918]  I just want to say, I think you're doing an amazing job.
[00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:02.378]  Good job with your kids.
[00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:08.902]  I know that, you know, I was reading something really interesting the other day about your sons and how they love to hunt.
[00:58:08.942 --> 00:58:15.186]  And so, I know you didn't teach them personally, but it's great that you're encouraging that tradition on.
[00:58:15.246 --> 00:58:18.068]  So, making it available for the rest of us as well.
[00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:19.150]  So, good job.
[00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:22.831]  Liberty, thank you so much for joining us in studio.
[00:58:22.892 --> 00:58:29.134]  Well, hopefully we can get you back and maybe even talk about some different things we can do with women's clothing.
[00:58:29.154 --> 00:58:30.194]  That would be incredible.
[00:58:30.234 --> 00:58:31.434]  Yes, that's awesome.
[00:58:31.494 --> 00:58:33.095]  But everybody, check her out.
[00:58:33.475 --> 00:58:36.056]  I think all of your social medias are Liberty Austin.
[00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:36.736]  That's right.
[00:58:36.756 --> 00:58:38.477]  You're kind of all over the internet.

[00:58:43.459 --> 00:58:44.839]  I think that's what, seven days?
[00:58:45.279 --> 00:58:46.360]  Seven or eight days away?
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.220]  That's right, eight days.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.143]  And don't you have a code or something they can go to?
[00:58:50.824 --> 00:58:52.426]  It's for the, yeah, for the app.
