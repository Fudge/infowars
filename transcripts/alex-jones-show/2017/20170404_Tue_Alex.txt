[00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.539]  What's his name?
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.900]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:21.086]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:28.817]  There is a war.
[00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.238]  It's happening now.
[00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:32.918]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.279]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.382]  We are the Infowar.
[00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:48.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's 4-4.
[00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:55.225]  Already, the fourth day of April 2000,
[00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:08.969]  The plot is thickening and President Donald John Trump is striking back against the globalists.
[00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.071]  It is a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:15.433]  Isn't it funny how fate works?
[00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:26.560]  Mike Cernovich, who is a lawyer and filmmaker and an activist the last few years, really exploding onto the scene with his dogged determination to take on tyranny.
[00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:32.800]  Was profiled a week and a half ago on 60 Minutes as the ultimate fake news purveyor.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.341]  Because he reported Hillary Clinton fell down and was ill!
[00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:41.203]  And then they didn't show the full video of her falling down, only showed her wobbling!
[00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:41.943]  Wow!
[00:01:42.224 --> 00:01:44.264]  Very impressive, 60 Minutes!
[00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:47.686]  Danger and Play.
[00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:48.606]  It's his website.
[00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.048]  Guess what happens then?
[00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:55.309]  Yesterday, we covered it some, but I didn't realize how big it would be
[00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:01.958]  How the media would panic and go into damage mode because we've known Susan Rice was involved.
[00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:03.139]  That's who's over it.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.344]  They bragged in the New York Times on March 1st that Obama was saving all the evidence and, you know, ferreting it away illegally.
[00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.165]  But see, there is no evidence.
[00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:15.566]  They just keep saying, we have the evidence.
[00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:18.788]  And then Trump says, oh, you have evidence and you've illegally leaked it.
[00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:20.449]  Let us see the evidence.
[00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.490]  The president has access to everything.
[00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.091]  He knows there is no evidence.
[00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:33.991]  So then, folks inside Bloomberg know that this is all being sat on for months.
[00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:38.174]  And who exactly leaked it?
[00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:39.695]  And then who purveyed it?
[00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:40.575]  We have all the names.
[00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:47.400]  And then, the purveyor of it is so arrogant, she goes on TV last week and admits that they were spying.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.042]  And it turns out a month before that, she said they were spying on them.
[00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:55.585]  It's incredible.
[00:02:56.764 --> 00:03:03.709]  Evelyn Farkas, head of the State Department and Pentagon's Russia operations.
[00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:16.677]  So, they're admitting they're doing it in the newspapers, and then they say they weren't, and then Bloomberg is sitting on top of the story, and Cernovich hasn't told me this, but I know some of the same people.
[00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:18.559]  That gets leaked to him.
[00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.320]  They have the full story waiting.
[00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:27.419]  Laying there on their desk, and because the information gets leaked, BOOM!
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.101]  It comes out that, yes, Bloomberg's forced to report.
[00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.682]  We're talking an hour after Cernovich put it out.
[00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:45.285]  They're forced to admit that, indeed, she gave the orders, and that they had detailed breakdowns on everything that the entire Trump operation was doing.
[00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:48.626]  And you know they were doing it during the campaign, too, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.967]  Read all the WikiLeaks.
[00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:51.227]  They've got everybody under surveillance.
[00:03:53.382 --> 00:03:54.882]  I've come out in federal wiretaps.
[00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:56.263]  So has Roger Stone.
[00:03:58.203 --> 00:03:59.623]  I've had to get rid of so many phones.
[00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:04.344]  They get on my phone, start calling people, start going to websites, start doing things in live time.
[00:04:04.624 --> 00:04:08.085]  Sometimes I'll wake up, the phone's turned on, and it will be going places.
[00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:10.585]  People say, well, why do you have all these horrible things?
[00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.526]  I think Matt Grudge is right.
[00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.306]  I should just get rid of it, just go back to a flip phone.
[00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:17.307]  Problem is, I could do so much with it if it wasn't filled with all this crap.
[00:04:18.347 --> 00:04:19.307]  All these Trojan horses.
[00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.868]  But here they are, caught red-handed, and then you notice the key words.
[00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:30.707]  that are used by people like Chris Cuomo.
[00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:33.308]  He calls it a fake scandal.
[00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:34.728]  Doesn't call it fake news.
[00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:36.809]  He calls it a fake scandal.
[00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.049]  Doesn't call it a hoax.
[00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:40.950]  A fake scandal.
[00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.450]  Oh, so this whole scandal's fake.
[00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.011]  Can't say the story's fake.
[00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:46.711]  Just the whole, it's a scandal.
[00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:50.272]  No, it's a scandal that you're a bunch of whores selling this country out.
[00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:57.669]  And that you think we're all stupid, and that you're better than us, Cuomo, you and your bully brother!
[00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.294]  Well, feel your hand, you un-American piece of trash!
[00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.038]  Mainstream media threw a fit on Monday.
[00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:20.185]  Independent journalist Mike Cernovich outed Susan Rice, who was Obama's national security advisor, as the person who requested the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates' names in the months leading up to the election, all the way up until Trump's inauguration.
[00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:22.766]  This, of course, was turning out to be the biggest story of the day.
[00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:23.647]  So what happened?
[00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:25.848]  Later in the afternoon, we got the manufactured.
[00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:30.070]  Blackwater found secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin backchannel.
[00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.696]  That's right, Trump-Putin backchannel could be found in thousands of articles, all released within two hours of each other.
[00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:44.402]  And they claim that Eric Prince of Blackwater was having secret meetings at an Indian Ocean island with Russia to set up a secret backchannel with Putin.
[00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:57.855]  The proof we do have are the NSA request logs with Susan Rice's name all over them, which is asking for the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates so she, Obama, and others could spy on them.
[00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:01.598]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:07.904]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:09.225]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:10.548]  Great!
[00:06:10.648 --> 00:06:11.629]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.151]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:25.397]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:26.137]  Wow, thank you.
[00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:28.739]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:30.420]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.942]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:34.582]  That's amazing.
[00:06:34.582 --> 00:06:35.142]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.403]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:39.683]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:42.564]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys.
[00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:51.546]  I love the InfoWars crew and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:52.486]  You will love it.
[00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:54.847]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:59.228]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:01.148]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:12.643]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:20.827]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:25.809]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:32.712]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:39.874]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:46.817]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:46.997 --> 00:07:51.341]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:54.724]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:07:54.864 --> 00:08:00.990]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.831]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:21.074]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:26.577]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:32.801]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:34.642]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:35.762]  A new world order.
[00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.652]  It was almost as if they were planned in post.
[00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:43.812]  It's just pancakes.
[00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:46.834]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:08:46.914 --> 00:09:04.225]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree with me.
[00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:09.729]  AK-47s belong to the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:15.143]  The guns will be taken.
[00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:17.144]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:19.464]  We're going to take all the weapons.
[00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:22.745]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:24.385]  Is global governance at last?
[00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:26.865]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:30.206]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:34.987]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:36.327]  Do you understand?
[00:09:37.047 --> 00:09:41.748]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:49.839]  I don't do like CNN, MSNBC, and other globalist media outlets do.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.562]  When Trump's in crisis, and when Trump's starting to slide backwards, I'll tell you.
[00:09:58.623 --> 00:09:59.944]  That's been happening the last few weeks.
[00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:07.248]  But I can smell it, and I can see it, and I can taste it, and I can feel it in the wind.
[00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:09.669]  I can intellectually analyze it.
[00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:30.338]  The whole House of Cards is starting to completely tumble on the Democrats and on George Soros and massive momentum has shifted against them because moles inside the major corporate media that are patriots are beginning to leak everything.
[00:10:31.513 --> 00:10:34.814]  They're beginning to record the executives telling them how to lie.
[00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:44.817]  They are beginning to find their conscience, and you are now going to see floods of leaks from the corporate media combine.
[00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:48.018]  Like what you just saw with Rice.
[00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.079]  And it's better than that.
[00:10:53.119 --> 00:11:02.462]  The entire Special Forces community, basically, I mean, we're talking 90 plus percent, has decided on their own to go operational against the globalists.
[00:11:04.082 --> 00:11:06.043]  Way bigger than they did during the campaign.
[00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:16.126]  I mean, hell, you saw Tonto, one of the most famous veterans alive, say, without me prompting, he's ready to go operational.
[00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:19.367]  They try to overthrow Trump, they're going to hit the streets, they're going to engage.
[00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:26.047]  There's no way the globalists can win if Trump just stays the course and they don't kill him.
[00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:33.952]  That's why they're trying to undermine him and say he's a fraud and saying he hasn't had success when he's had anything but failure.
[00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:38.635]  It's been almost total success and ridiculous in the last 74 days what he's gotten done.
[00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:41.457]  I don't have to chronicle that again here, do I?
[00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:43.838]  But you need to and everybody you know that's still in the dark.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.221]  It is biblical that Mike Cernovich
[00:11:50.134 --> 00:12:02.916]  Investigative journalist, lawyer, filmmaker, would be profiled as the epitome of fake news when he's the epitome of cutting-edge, smart news.
[00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:04.697]  The guy's got a great brain.
[00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:05.717]  He gets it.
[00:12:05.797 --> 00:12:06.457]  He sees it.
[00:12:07.097 --> 00:12:07.997]  He's the thin slicer.
[00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:11.498]  That's what my dad calls it.
[00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:15.219]  And notice, only zero hedge in Infowars.
[00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:16.759]  Of course, drugs link to it.
[00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.794]  Gave the guy any credit on the biggest story so far in this whole Spygate, Russiagate garbage.
[00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:29.679]  He got the leak directly from the big outfit.
[00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:31.100]  Our intel is it's Bloomberg.
[00:12:31.881 --> 00:12:33.122]  But he wants to leave his source alone.
[00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:34.603]  Bloomberg within an hour!
[00:12:37.153 --> 00:12:45.361]  Of him publishing, publishes their own thing confirming everything Cernovich said, and no one on the news will even say his name.
[00:12:45.862 --> 00:12:48.344]  One time on CNN they said, oh, he's fake news.
[00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:51.988]  They don't attack the fact that it's a real story.
[00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:56.632]  Or CNN calls it a fake scandal.
[00:12:56.893 --> 00:12:59.135]  They don't call it a fake story.
[00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:01.177]  They say, oh, the scandal's fake.
[00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:06.981]  Look at the arrogance of these parasitic sacks of crap.
[00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:09.143]  They think they're better than everybody else.
[00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.425]  Just look at Cuomo and his dirtbag bully brother.
[00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:13.927]  They're gonna get put in their place real soon.
[00:13:14.247 --> 00:13:14.788]  Better believe it.
[00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.929]  Running their mouths.
[00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.831]  Constantly trying to bankrupt this country.
[00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:22.134]  Pigs.
[00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.437]  He comes out and says it's a fake scandal.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.421]  It's amazing.
[00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:35.667]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're on record everywhere.
[00:13:35.727 --> 00:13:37.088]  In fact, I've got the stacks of news.
[00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:41.890]  I was asking for that New York Times back, guys, from March 1st, and all the others.
[00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.030]  Here it is, right in front of me.
[00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.331]  Thank you.
[00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:48.832]  Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking.
[00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:53.194]  That was all the intel grabbed, and Susan Rice is even in these articles.
[00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:59.037]  And then we've got all the other stories we can put up behind us from January 20th.
[00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:01.765]  Wiretaps of Trump Tower!
[00:14:01.785 --> 00:14:03.286]  Here, let's put it on screen whenever we get a chance.
[00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.127]  Behind me or in front of me, I don't care.
[00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:10.828]  But that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:14.589]  And this giant hoax that I was wondering if it would work.
[00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:16.630]  They put everything they had into this.
[00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.931]  More than saying Hillary was invincible and couldn't be beaten and was, you know, 15 points ahead.
[00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:25.452]  And then, I knew they were desperate when they said she had 68 points against Trump.
[00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.013]  I mean, internal polls where he was 15 points ahead of her.
[00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:34.393]  CNN was saying that she was 30-40 points ahead.
[00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:37.254]  Wiretapping data using inquiry of Trump aides.
[00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:38.234]  Oh my gosh!
[00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:54.899]  Then, two weeks ago, we get the secret DEA-CIA interface into the NSA of Obama going back eight years spying on Trump, his family, and everybody.
[00:14:56.294 --> 00:15:00.856]  This is just the targeting orders and the grids so they know where to go in and what's been surveilled.
[00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:01.917]  Just a listing.
[00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:04.458]  Like a card at the library.
[00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:09.400]  And of course we covered up all the names and the rest of it and then destroyed the information.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.381]  We were only given a small portion of the file.
[00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:12.482]  But it was real!
[00:15:14.603 --> 00:15:17.985]  You didn't hear one word out of MSM.
[00:15:18.025 --> 00:15:19.405]  They didn't touch it.
[00:15:20.946 --> 00:15:21.906]  Oh and guess who else was in there?
[00:15:22.067 --> 00:15:23.407]  Alex Jones being spied on.
[00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:24.748]  Michael Savage.
[00:15:26.937 --> 00:15:36.300]  And that was just in the little dump that the Sheriff's Department of Maricopa County gave us that the FBI's had for multiple years.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.821]  Then I had Larry Klayman, you know, the lawyer that's beaten the NSA in court, founder of Judicial Watch.
[00:15:41.222 --> 00:15:43.922]  I had him on days later to break down the case.
[00:15:44.082 --> 00:15:49.784]  I mean, this is rock solid.
[00:15:49.804 --> 00:15:51.725]  600 plus million files.
[00:15:54.582 --> 00:15:55.783]  Did you hear anything about that?
[00:15:56.163 --> 00:16:00.385]  That's certified Citizen Trump being spied on.
[00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:02.246]  Day one, Obama.
[00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:03.066]  Why?
[00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:04.407]  Because they knew the charisma.
[00:16:04.607 --> 00:16:05.908]  Number one TV host in the country.
[00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:08.089]  They knew he was planning to probably run as a Republican.
[00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:09.829]  Of course the Democrats were watching him.
[00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:16.833]  If you're not getting watched by these criminals, you're not on the field.
[00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:20.357]  Oh, and Comey came out and said there was no surveillance.
[00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:24.481]  Well, he can say that because his agency wasn't the ones doing it.
[00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:38.974]  And then he can play dumb, because Susan Rice didn't come over and say, I'm spying on the president-elect, but sees no evidence of wiretapping.
[00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:41.216]  Ha ha, now notice, sees no evidence.
[00:16:42.497 --> 00:16:44.259]  What, right in front of his eyeballs?
[00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:48.488]  I mean, are you allowed to lie when you're like 7 feet tall?
[00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:51.229]  I mean, I'm just wondering.
[00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:52.490]  Is that what he's got going for him?
[00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.511]  Did nothing about Loretta Lynch on the airplane with Bill Clinton illegally.
[00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:57.451]  All the rest of the crap we've witnessed.
[00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:04.154]  And now he's rolling over to the MSM to piss all over our president and our country.
[00:17:07.355 --> 00:17:08.416]  Got a bunch of clubs I'm gonna play.
[00:17:08.456 --> 00:17:12.297]  We have an incredible list of amazing guests today.
[00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:13.918]  This is another broadcast nobody can miss.
[00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:20.928]  Come back, I'm going to get into these Susan Rice clips, but I want to go ahead and just start getting to some of these right now.
[00:17:20.968 --> 00:17:22.389]  I want to start with Chris Cuomo.
[00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.132]  Calls the Susan Rice report a fake scandal.
[00:17:27.152 --> 00:17:28.632]  Again, not fake news, because it's not fake.
[00:17:29.093 --> 00:17:30.554]  Bloomberg admits it real.
[00:17:31.754 --> 00:17:32.415]  They sat on it.
[00:17:32.495 --> 00:17:33.175]  Others sat on it.
[00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:40.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, they also hit it in plain view on March 1st, admitting that they were spreading the info.
[00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:40.980]  That's what's crazy.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.341]  I mean, we have the mole that's Susan Rice.
[00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:44.642]  Then we have the mouth.
[00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:52.484]  That is Evelyn Farkas, who goes on TV and pushes it and says, we have the proof.
[00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:54.206]  And then goes, ooh.
[00:17:57.189 --> 00:17:58.550]  That's how delusional they are.
[00:18:00.251 --> 00:18:11.862]  So here's Chris Cuomo, who says, if your 12-year-old daughter doesn't like to see a man's penis in their showers at school, that she's a transphobe and that you're a bad father.
[00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:13.875]  He said that three weeks ago.
[00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:16.196]  I mean, what type of wacko is this guy?
[00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:21.258]  His brother says if you own guns or you're pro-life, get out of New York.
[00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:22.039]  You're not welcome here.
[00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:23.439]  And people said, oh, you're joking.
[00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:24.980]  He said, no, get out of here.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.820]  How about you get out of here, buddy?
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.682]  How about you quit running your fat mouth, punk?
[00:18:31.642 --> 00:18:33.203]  People are sick of people like you.
[00:18:33.343 --> 00:18:35.764]  We're done getting pushed around, and you know it, don't you?
[00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:38.283]  So let's play this piece of trash.
[00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:38.743]  Here he is.
[00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:42.945]  President Trump, right-wing media types peddling a fake scandal.
[00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:43.365]  What is it?
[00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:54.691]  Well, this suggestion that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice improperly unmasked the identity of Trump associates as part of what our president calls a crooked scheme.
[00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:58.513]  An associate of Rice says it's just plain false.
[00:18:58.733 --> 00:19:01.554]  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jim- Oh my gosh!
[00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:02.855]  Maybe we can have-
[00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:09.294]  Congressman Schiff on to tell us that there was no stand-in order in Benghazi and all those heroes are liars.
[00:19:09.834 --> 00:19:13.117]  Maybe we can have that guy who's got the biggest lying eyes.
[00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:16.720]  I wouldn't believe him if he said the sky was blue.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.902]  I mean these are obvious pieces of trash.
[00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:27.508]  The worst people in America pulled up out of the sewage by the globalists to be put in to run over the American people because who would want to do that?
[00:19:27.528 --> 00:19:28.689]  Who would want to kill prosperity?
[00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:29.290]  Who would want to do that?
[00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.291]  These snakes!
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.762]  Look at that guy!
[00:19:33.002 --> 00:19:34.345]  That's your enemy on screen!
[00:19:34.786 --> 00:19:37.652]  TV viewers, radio listeners, this is Representative Adam Schiff.
[00:19:38.234 --> 00:19:41.400]  When we return, I'm gonna go into these clips.
[00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:50.250]  CNN goes on a rampage against Susan Rice's bombshell, instructs viewers to ignore the story, talk about mind control.
[00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:56.295]  CNN dismisses Rice's unmasking bombshell as a ginned-up distraction.
[00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.517]  They don't call it false, just ginned-up distraction.
[00:19:58.837 --> 00:20:00.638]  And we've got so much more.
[00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:02.100]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:20:08.086 --> 00:20:14.791]  Stephan Molyneux, FreeDomainRadio.com, Stephan Molyneux on Twitter, YouTube, Free Domain Radio as well.
[00:20:15.932 --> 00:20:16.693]  A lot going on.
[00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:17.834]  Thanks for joining us via Skype.
[00:20:17.874 --> 00:20:18.835]  What do you want to tackle first?
[00:20:19.435 --> 00:20:22.418]  Now, the Democrats have a big problem in that they lost, right?
[00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:25.720]  They had a very experienced candidate running against a first-time newbie and they lost.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.003]  So they have to come up with some reason that protects the elites as to why they lost.
[00:20:29.023 --> 00:20:31.205]  So now it's all Russia and all this kind of crap, right?
[00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:35.968]  It's the same thing when you had two giant world wars in Europe in the 20th century.
[00:20:35.988 --> 00:20:39.850]  Within the space of a couple of decades, the elites were facing rebellion within their own ranks.
[00:20:40.251 --> 00:20:46.575]  So they had to make up this story as to why we had all these terrible wars and 50 million people got killed and so on.
[00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:47.896]  And their answer was,
[00:20:48.837 --> 00:20:50.799]  Alex, do you know what caused these wars?
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:51.840]  Borders!
[00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:53.022]  Yes, it's borders!
[00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:57.988]  So if we get rid of borders, it's not the elite, it's not the military-industrial complex, and it sure as hell isn't central banking.
[00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:58.869]  Never wanna touch that.
[00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.071]  It's borders!
[00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:03.916]  Like, in other words, if your home gets robbed, the problem is your walls.
[00:21:03.936 --> 00:21:06.199]  So if we take down your walls, everything's gonna be fine.
[00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:16.284]  People, of course, think that the EU was some spontaneous organization of the masses, like, oh, we're facing giant, consolidated totalitarianism behind the Soviet bloc and so on.
[00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:21.367]  So what we need is another giant layer of bureaucracy and central planning, because that's how you fight communism.
[00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:22.208]  It's with socialism.
[00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:24.989]  I've never for the life of me understood that logic.
[00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:27.371]  That's like fighting a headache by cutting your own head off.
[00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:31.453]  But of course, it was the American elites who helped fund the origins
[00:21:31.753 --> 00:21:32.274]  ...of the EU.
[00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.195]  It came out of precursors to the CIA.
[00:21:34.235 --> 00:21:37.058]  They never funded less than half of the groups that were advocating for it.
[00:21:37.418 --> 00:21:42.502]  It is a globalist, centralized, CIA-based, collectivist nightmare.
[00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:46.546]  And finally, finally, Europe seems to be waking up from this nightmare.
[00:21:46.886 --> 00:21:47.506]  I agree with you.
[00:21:47.586 --> 00:21:48.787]  What's happening is prima facie.
[00:21:48.827 --> 00:21:52.928]  It's not like we're here just making up our own narrative and we're the fake news.
[00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:53.128]  No.
[00:21:53.328 --> 00:21:55.009]  They have brought in 5 million Muslims.
[00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:56.890]  80% of them are military-age men.
[00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.750]  They are running around like they own the place.
[00:21:59.011 --> 00:22:06.693]  The left is literally bringing in men like reinforcements and Peter Sutherland of the EU and UN says they're trying to get rid of Europe because it has a middle class.
[00:22:06.753 --> 00:22:13.236]  I mean, what's weird is in their white papers they tell the truth and it's so crazy and so bad that in public they lie
[00:22:13.536 --> 00:22:17.438]  And I'm wondering, why would they want to bring in authoritarianism when it's the most unstable system?
[00:22:17.518 --> 00:22:18.639]  What the hell are they doing?
[00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:22.021]  People who are focused on political power are drug addicts, right?
[00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:34.447]  We know this from studies in monkeys, that as you rise through the hierarchy of the ranks, you get endorphins, you get all of these wonderful happy brain joy juices flooding through your system, and you become an addict.
[00:22:34.467 --> 00:22:35.708]  They literally are addicts.
[00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:37.549]  Of course, they're not playing with their own money.
[00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:41.191]  They're playing with our lives and the lives of our children and the security of our institutions.
[00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:52.798]  But it's no... You can't expect sense out of these people anymore that you can say, well, that gambling addict, why on earth would he end up losing his home, losing his house, losing his wife, lying face down in a ditch with a dead hooker?
[00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.519]  I mean, that's what addicts do.
[00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:57.740]  They continue to escalate until they're either cured or they crash.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.222]  And I think we're kind of poised between the two at the moment.
[00:23:03.277 --> 00:23:04.637]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:23:04.918 --> 00:23:06.218]  You can't survive without it.
[00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:07.318]  But where do you get it?
[00:23:07.618 --> 00:23:13.380]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.322]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:23:19.522 --> 00:23:36.370]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.891]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:40.451]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:41.431]  Easy assembly.
[00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:42.392]  Low maintenance.
[00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.512]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:16.162]  This just in at InfoWars.com from the Daily Caller.
[00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:17.703]  Former U.S.
[00:24:17.763 --> 00:24:24.926]  Attorney Susan Rice ordered spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets involving Trump.
[00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:33.909]  As we just told you earlier, absolute detailed spying and that's actually already come out but now they have even more confirmation of it.
[00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:37.030]  Confirmed Susan Rice unmasked Trump team.
[00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:38.551]  Once again,
[00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:40.985]  Trump was right.
[00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:51.710]  The conspiracy theory that a close Obama associate worked to unmask the Trump team resulting in the ongoing media spectacle over collusion between Trump and the Kremlin has been confirmed.
[00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.091]  First by Mike Cernovich and now by Bloomberg itself.
[00:24:57.132 --> 00:25:07.476]  And it goes through Mike Cernovich having his whistleblower inside one of the news agencies where they sat on this and then Bloomberg comes out an hour later and
[00:25:10.543 --> 00:25:12.984]  Publishes the information.
[00:25:13.524 --> 00:25:19.166]  Top Obama advisor sought names of Trump associates in Intel.
[00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:19.946]  That's yesterday.
[00:25:22.547 --> 00:25:23.988]  At 10.13 a.m.
[00:25:24.108 --> 00:25:25.989]  Cernovich at 9 something a.m.
[00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:29.370]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen and it just goes over the whole thing.
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.191]  More right-wing fake scandals.
[00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:58.673]  I have all the articles here where before they said they were spying on Trump and unmasking him and that's where they lose the war because they're a bunch of liars and they built their house on sand and they thought their hoax of them all lining up saying Trump is completely insane no one was spying on him where does he get it and then and the and the Spicer comes in and shows
[00:26:00.097 --> 00:26:05.260]  The New York Times headlines that we showed weeks before, and the media goes, oh, he got the fake news from Alex Jones.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:06.961]  Are you missing that?
[00:26:07.301 --> 00:26:20.888]  We're holding up not one, not two, not three, but four articles the week of the 20th, saying he was being wiretapped, saying he was being spied on, saying that they had unmasked the names, so they had proof of all this Russian stuff.
[00:26:23.169 --> 00:26:27.311]  And then when Trump goes, oh, that's illegal to leak that, oh, we never did that, we never did that, you're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy.
[00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:30.194]  See how they work?
[00:26:30.635 --> 00:26:35.557]  And that's what's scary is they didn't even think it out that far to realize what could happen to them.
[00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:38.018]  So now they've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:48.844]  The big news here though is that it is imploding on them and this will just be more that they're discredited on.
[00:26:51.025 --> 00:26:51.906]  The good news is
[00:26:53.766 --> 00:27:07.074]  We have to go back into WikiLeaks and republish all that and bring it all back up and bring up how they lost the election and lied about it and all the fake polls and all the colluding with CNN and MSNBC and the WikiLeaks and fixing the news stories and having fake town halls.
[00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:11.977]  This is a discredited mob of lying scum.
[00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:17.160]  And I can't even believe they've gotten this far with their BS.
[00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:22.878]  Let's go to this piece.
[00:27:22.998 --> 00:27:26.100]  CNN dismisses Rice unmasking bombshell.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.941]  Ginned up distraction.
[00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:30.062]  Then they blame it on the intel community.
[00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:31.784]  They shouldn't have done this for her.
[00:27:32.124 --> 00:27:38.128]  Well, she was in an agency over them with access as a department.
[00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:43.952]  One of the most powerful state department.
[00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:47.370]  We're going to go ahead and go to the clip right now.
[00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:48.390]  Here it is.
[00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.371]  Why would someone do this?
[00:27:50.991 --> 00:27:53.412]  Every day they're getting briefings on intelligence.
[00:27:53.452 --> 00:27:57.014]  Their briefer chooses what they're briefed on, including Ambassador Rice.
[00:27:57.494 --> 00:28:04.718]  In those briefings, an official such as Rice might say, to further understand it, I'd like to know who those names are.
[00:28:04.738 --> 00:28:05.318]  So stop right there.
[00:28:05.398 --> 00:28:07.579]  And that's why they... Just back it up again.
[00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:08.319]  I'm going to start over.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.642]  Do you understand you've got Anderson Cooper of the left-wing Ford Foundation CIA arm
[00:28:15.077 --> 00:28:27.131]  The literal enemy of this country, that subgroup of the CIA, and you've got this other clown next to him, whose cult is out to create a centralized system of control so they can be in charge.
[00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:28.172]  Priest of power.
[00:28:28.353 --> 00:28:29.234]  Priest of control freak.
[00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:33.565]  And now they've been telling us for months, we're totally insane, none of this existed.
[00:28:33.785 --> 00:28:36.848]  Oh, now it's just a small thing, unmasking in a meeting, no big deal.
[00:28:37.028 --> 00:28:48.516]  Yeah, you're gonna spy on the President of the United States for your political party and go way beyond anything Nixon ever dreamed of, and you're now just gonna act like, okay, you know, this really went on, but it's no big deal.
[00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:51.238]  While the rest of CNN's saying it's a fake scandal.
[00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:52.279]  So get it straight.
[00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:56.963]  You got your gangster over there, Cuomo, and you got the CIA thug right here.
[00:28:57.623 --> 00:29:01.627]  One of the major blue blood fortune owners, just as bad as the EU had.
[00:29:01.647 --> 00:29:03.969]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:04.910]  I'm sorry, let's go to the clip.
[00:29:05.774 --> 00:29:06.895]  Why would someone do this?
[00:29:07.535 --> 00:29:09.957]  Every day they're getting briefings on intelligence.
[00:29:09.997 --> 00:29:13.559]  Their briefer chooses what they're briefed on, including Ambassador Rice.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:21.284]  In those briefings, an official such as Rice might say, to further understand it, I'd like to know who those names are.
[00:29:21.925 --> 00:29:26.328]  And that's why they would make that request, which then, as I said, has to be approved by the intelligence community.
[00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:27.609]  That's what I'm told.
[00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:32.612]  And again, to note by senior intelligence officials who work for both Democrats.
[00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:34.628]  We'll be back.
[00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:36.149]  Notice he said, oh, partly ginned up.
[00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:10.391]  So after weeks, what is now the largest House Intelligence Committee investigation ever, we get this from Democratic head Adam Schiff.
[00:30:10.732 --> 00:30:14.557]  I don't think we can say anything definitely at this point, Schiff told Jake Tapper.
[00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:17.361]  We're at the very early stages of the investigation.
[00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:18.202]  So they have nothing.
[00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:19.684]  They really have nothing.
[00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:24.507]  But let's go back in time to a time when the Democrats were back-channeling with the Russians.
[00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:25.508]  Here's the headline.
[00:30:25.668 --> 00:30:30.292]  Ted Kennedy secretly asked the Soviets to intervene in the 1984 elections.
[00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:40.439]  According to Soviet documents unearthed in the 1990s, Kennedy literally asked the Soviets, avowed enemies of the U.S., to intervene on behalf of the Democratic Party in the 1984 elections.
[00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:42.720]  So what we have is another piece of evidence.
[00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:48.685]  Isn't it funny how we always see the Democrats pointing their finger, making accusations, and then when you do a little looking,
[00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:54.374]  It's always the Democrats that are the ones colluding, conniving, and backstabbing.
[00:30:54.834 --> 00:30:56.417]  I think Pat Buchanan said it best.
[00:30:56.798 --> 00:30:59.141]  They've been investigating this garbage for months.
[00:30:59.642 --> 00:31:02.607]  Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:31:03.854 --> 00:31:05.195]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:31:05.415 --> 00:31:10.218]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:13.601]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:19.244]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:28.270]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.614]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:31:33.874 --> 00:31:40.556]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[00:31:40.856 --> 00:31:45.437]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:31:45.577 --> 00:31:48.738]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:31:48.878 --> 00:31:50.779]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:56.301]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:58.561]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[00:31:58.861 --> 00:32:00.562]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:06.410]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.311]  Minor words and his was action.
[00:32:08.892 --> 00:32:10.433]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:32:10.473 --> 00:32:16.137]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:32:16.377 --> 00:32:18.679]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:23.963]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:25.224]  Four of them here tonight.
[00:32:25.344 --> 00:32:30.648]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:32:41.482 --> 00:32:44.224]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:32:45.085 --> 00:32:46.546]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:32:47.206 --> 00:32:49.147]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:32:49.468 --> 00:32:53.671]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:57.153]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:32:57.253 --> 00:32:58.874]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:32:59.035 --> 00:32:59.595]  Take action!
[00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:38.656]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:38.696 --> 00:33:40.759]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:52.206]  Let me tell you who the guests are today, ladies and gentlemen, now that we're 33 minutes into global transmission.
[00:33:52.586 --> 00:34:02.570]  Roger Stone, in about three minutes, is going to be joining us from Florida with big breaking news that I can confirm with my sources as well about the fact there's only a few good people left in the White House.
[00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:07.992]  Trump is surrounded by enemies, leaking everything, and we now know what happened with the healthcare bill.
[00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:09.633]  And so much more.
[00:34:09.673 --> 00:34:12.756]  We now know what's going on with Nunes and why they're targeting him.
[00:34:13.116 --> 00:34:17.961]  We're going to be talking to Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and Trump confidant, in just a moment.
[00:34:18.922 --> 00:34:20.224]  Also, Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:34:20.464 --> 00:34:23.467]  We have Junkers, one of the major heirs to the Nazi fortunes.
[00:34:24.448 --> 00:34:28.352]  The first or second most powerful Nazi family under Hitler.
[00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.800]  Who took over Luxembourg in World War II.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.741]  He rules Luxembourg.
[00:34:33.781 --> 00:34:34.921]  He's the head of the unelected EU.
[00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:42.804]  He's threatened war with Europe, European countries, war with the United States, economic war, if we don't submit to him.
[00:34:43.144 --> 00:34:46.585]  And now we've got a bunch of other members of Parliament saying the same thing in Spain.
[00:34:47.806 --> 00:34:48.566]  This is crazy.
[00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:55.224]  They're threatening to march EU armies into countries that try to pull out who never voted to enter it.
[00:34:55.544 --> 00:34:56.885]  Can you say bye-bye?
[00:34:56.945 --> 00:35:00.127]  Can you say you really failed now in your arrogance, brother?
[00:35:03.689 --> 00:35:12.395]  So, Lord Monckton, top advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and a guy that helped kill so much of the carbon taxes we see, will be joining us.
[00:35:12.775 --> 00:35:14.196]  Mike Cernovich, what a hero!
[00:35:14.216 --> 00:35:19.599]  A week and a half ago, demonized as fake news for saying Hillary fell down, and other stuff on 60 Minutes.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.921]  Mike Cernovich got the intel from a leaker inside Bloomberg.
[00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:23.882]  He didn't tell me that, I know.
[00:35:24.982 --> 00:35:28.685]  Bloomberg an hour later had to admit, okay, yeah, Susan Rice was ordering the illegal spying on.
[00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:31.882]  President Trump and everybody else, just like Trump told you.
[00:35:32.222 --> 00:35:35.924]  And just like, see he's the president, but he's not going to leak national security stuff.
[00:35:35.944 --> 00:35:43.307]  He's going to let them sit there and lie, knowing everybody in the intelligence community knows, and just let them.
[00:35:43.447 --> 00:35:46.448]  More rope, more rope scum, more rope, more rope.
[00:35:47.629 --> 00:35:54.532]  Mike Cernovich and then Millie Weaver and crew are in LA investigating the 474 accused pedophiles who were caught with
[00:35:56.196 --> 00:36:00.840]  30 plus women in sex slavery and 28 children, some of them small children, in cages.
[00:36:02.642 --> 00:36:09.888]  So, we're reporting on the fact that pedophilia is rampant across this country in Europe and that people are rolling it up all over.
[00:36:09.968 --> 00:36:15.133]  And then, I'm going to host 30 minutes of the 4th hour of the David Knight Takes Over the News Blitz.
[00:36:15.553 --> 00:36:19.497]  I've got former major SEAL team leader, Patriot,
[00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:25.707]  Uh, Dev Group, Whole 9 Yards, he's got five TV shows, three of them he stars on, so he's got a lot to lose.
[00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:27.489]  It's not like he's some guy that's trying to get attention.
[00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:36.239]  Running a major operation with a bunch of agencies and folks in their private capacities because the media won't cover all the child trafficking and the rest of it.
[00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:37.521]  They have all the arresting intel.
[00:36:38.888 --> 00:36:50.318]  He's running an operation to expose that and he got calls from major agencies that we've got the chatter and that they're all panicking and figuring out how to try to take him out or legal action even before he moves.
[00:36:50.818 --> 00:36:54.742]  So the pedophiles understand we now to a great extent.
[00:36:55.382 --> 00:37:04.826]  Legally and lawfully, because these are targeted groups with known criminal backgrounds, are surveilling them and with warrants, of course, and I mean that's why they're panicking.
[00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:06.707]  We are so close to bringing it all down.
[00:37:06.787 --> 00:37:08.647]  So, get ready for Trump to strike back.
[00:37:08.887 --> 00:37:09.648]  This is only the beginning.
[00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:11.268]  We're going to Roger Stone in a moment.
[00:37:11.508 --> 00:37:12.769]  We sell his best-selling book.
[00:37:14.008 --> 00:37:16.570]  Number one political book at Amazon for months ongoing.
[00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.531]  I don't know what it is today.
[00:37:17.912 --> 00:37:21.355]  The Making of the President 2016 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:37:21.395 --> 00:37:22.576]  And your purchase is vital.
[00:37:22.836 --> 00:37:23.156]  I'm giving $100,000.
[00:37:23.196 --> 00:37:25.118]  I gave $10,000.
[00:37:25.398 --> 00:37:28.381]  They censored his YouCaring account, won $50,000, hit it in an hour.
[00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:32.405]  So now he's raised about $100,000 to fund this.
[00:37:32.445 --> 00:37:36.388]  And I'm talking, of course, about the SAW man, the Navy SEAL, the Patriot.
[00:37:36.408 --> 00:37:39.031]  He's also a federal officer, as we speak, in task forces.
[00:37:40.712 --> 00:37:44.966]  I'm going to give another $90,000 even though I don't really have that extra money.
[00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:47.654]  We're just going to do it and trust the listeners to support us.
[00:37:49.116 --> 00:37:51.397]  Veterans for Child Rescue is the site.
[00:37:51.457 --> 00:37:54.879]  And again, this is just the cost, the money for this large team.
[00:37:55.279 --> 00:37:57.600]  You can go to the About page, About Us page.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.521]  Oh, I was told today, Shane Steiner called me.
[00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:01.522]  He tuned into Glenn Beck when he got in his car.
[00:38:01.962 --> 00:38:02.522]  It was already on, 590.
[00:38:02.682 --> 00:38:07.305]  And Beck was saying his number one thing is going to be child rescue and stopping pedophile rings now.
[00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:16.129]  In my view, with Beck's background, he always stands in for everything I say I'm doing to take control of the message and the narrative, and then he self-discredits.
[00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:18.412]  That's his job now in the liberal media.
[00:38:18.812 --> 00:38:31.812]  So you know we're on target when they bring him out of the bullpen, when that creature rises up out of hell, when Judas Iscariot on PCP, when Benedict Arnold on steroids rises from the pit.
[00:38:32.617 --> 00:38:32.997]  Of hell!
[00:38:33.918 --> 00:38:35.118]  You know you're on the right target.
[00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:36.939]  We're talking to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:43.083]  It's been four years we've had the Deep Earth Crystal, best iodine out there, the good halogen that's helped cleanse my body.
[00:38:43.663 --> 00:38:45.224]  3,000 plus reviews on Power Reviews.
[00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:46.004]  Nobody's got that.
[00:38:46.745 --> 00:38:47.485]  4.8 stars.
[00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:49.466]  We're running out of it.
[00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:54.469]  And because it's from deep earth sources and the gas companies that drill for it, it's a derivative.
[00:38:54.489 --> 00:38:55.490]  They're not drilling for it when they do.
[00:38:57.065 --> 00:39:08.912]  They're saying they want a lot more money, or they're running out, all this other stuff, and so we're selling out of our latest shipment today, and then we're going to hopefully have enough for four or five more runs, and then that may be it.
[00:39:09.812 --> 00:39:12.854]  I put it back to full retail, something we've never even had at full retail.
[00:39:13.899 --> 00:39:19.301]  But for everybody that's on the newsletter, Infowars.com forward slash newsletter, you get exclusive articles, videos, you name it.
[00:39:19.621 --> 00:39:23.002]  Because you're there, I'm gonna give you 50% off retail, which is $20.
[00:39:24.283 --> 00:39:26.964]  Less than it was already discounted yesterday at like $21.
[00:39:27.044 --> 00:39:27.224]  Or $20.99.
[00:39:27.304 --> 00:39:29.905]  And that was 30% off already discounted.
[00:39:30.325 --> 00:39:30.785]  So it's $40 right now, $39.95.
[00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.768]  At Infowars.com.
[00:39:38.289 --> 00:39:42.213]  If you want to support the broadcast and help us fund the operation, great!
[00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:43.014]  It's like a donation.
[00:39:43.374 --> 00:39:46.758]  But if you want to sign up for the free newsletter, every day there's promo codes.
[00:39:46.778 --> 00:39:48.119]  50% off, mass murderers agree.
[00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:53.005]  Gun Control Works, with a picture of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao on it.
[00:39:53.245 --> 00:39:55.127]  The first t-shirt I ever designed.
[00:39:55.467 --> 00:39:56.448]  Infowars.com.
[00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.710]  On the back.
[00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:01.371]  And politicians love disarmed peasants on the back.
[00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:04.173]  It's a great classic anti-gun control shirt.
[00:40:04.554 --> 00:40:07.596]  It's 50% off.
[00:40:07.616 --> 00:40:09.298]  That shirt's been out 20 years.
[00:40:09.678 --> 00:40:14.042]  That shirt helped fund our original operations, along with my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:40:14.062 --> 00:40:17.085]  Those were the first things I put out to fund this operation.
[00:40:17.645 --> 00:40:19.247]  America Destroyed by Design and that shirt.
[00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:22.311]  We also have the Bill Clinton rape shirt and others.
[00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:23.172]  It's all about the First Amendment.
[00:40:23.192 --> 00:40:24.534]  And we have a new shirt we're launching today.
[00:40:24.754 --> 00:40:25.375]  I'll tell you about it later.
[00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:26.476]  So that's all there.
[00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:32.263]  We have the new bubblegum flavor with the tea tree oil, with the iodine, with the colloidal silver.
[00:40:33.257 --> 00:40:38.000]  We have it all, but it's in bubblegum flavor, and it doesn't have the peppermint that's so strong in it.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.821]  The adult has sold out of Super Blue.
[00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:41.222]  We're calling it Super Blue.
[00:40:41.242 --> 00:40:45.085]  We're going to change the name to Super Pink, because it's not the other turns of blue.
[00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:47.646]  It's got iodine, and I guess this does turn blue, grayish blue.
[00:40:47.686 --> 00:40:50.048]  The point is, is that it's bubblegum flavor, so your kids love it.
[00:40:50.268 --> 00:40:52.049]  This is so much better than most children's toothpaste.
[00:40:52.469 --> 00:40:53.090]  Get it today, $9.95.
[00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.711]  It's concentrated.
[00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:58.713]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:06.759]  Told you about Lord Christopher Monckton, Mike Cernovich, the big rock star right now with that leak.
[00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:08.720]  The real rock star is folks that leaked it to him joining us.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:14.081]  Millie Weaver on the ground in L.A., David Knight, the Saw Man, and so much more.
[00:41:14.721 --> 00:41:17.682]  We've got World War III nightmare scenario brewing in the East China Sea.
[00:41:17.922 --> 00:41:20.242]  Oh, that CNBC finally realizes how much danger we're in.
[00:41:20.502 --> 00:41:21.723]  They might get off the President's back.
[00:41:22.483 --> 00:41:26.904]  We've got so much to cover today, but joining us from the Stone Cold Truth,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.803]  Joining us is Roger Stone, again, former head of the Trump campaign.
[00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.163]  Also got him to run back in 2000.
[00:41:34.564 --> 00:41:35.604]  Friend for over 40 years.
[00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:40.267]  Here to cover the waterfront with big breaking news on what's really happening inside the White House.
[00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:42.689]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:41:43.826 --> 00:42:04.399]  Alex, first of all, let me salute my friend Mike Cernovich, Freedom Fighter, and yet another person that Google is attempting to strangle, Facebook is attempting to strangle by limiting our reach, but he has done his country a notable service and my hat is rhetorically off to him.
[00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:06.306]  You're right, Alex.
[00:42:06.366 --> 00:42:11.492]  There are so many developments in Washington, it's really somewhat hard to keep track.
[00:42:12.293 --> 00:42:17.339]  Let's start with the fact that legitimate, totally credible sources tell me
[00:42:18.126 --> 00:42:23.188]  That my name is among those that Susan Rice unmasked.
[00:42:23.368 --> 00:42:28.969]  That my name is among those where she was searching for the intelligence.
[00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:37.272]  This is, of course, using intelligence agency material from surveillance for strictly political purposes.
[00:42:37.812 --> 00:42:39.373]  It is also a felony.
[00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:41.874]  And it just amazes me.
[00:42:41.894 --> 00:42:42.934]  It's ultra illegal.
[00:42:44.116 --> 00:42:46.197]  Strictly illegal, both at two levels.
[00:42:46.477 --> 00:42:51.578]  One, the request, and secondarily, the dissemination.
[00:42:52.118 --> 00:43:01.041]  There are clearly leaks in the New York Times and in fake news sites such as the Smoking Gun and Raw Story.
[00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:07.963]  These people are guilty of a felony because they are recipients of information, raw information.
[00:43:07.983 --> 00:43:10.864]  And by the way, I noticed even- Surveillance.
[00:43:11.024 --> 00:43:19.406]  I notice even PolitiFact and other groups that are normally pretty liberal, they put out articles last week going, okay, Roger Stone never said that he was talking to these people beforehand.
[00:43:19.426 --> 00:43:21.146]  He talked to them after publicly.
[00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:22.227]  He wrote articles for Breitbart.
[00:43:22.507 --> 00:43:26.768]  Everything Roger Stone said has come out and Congressman Schiff is lying.
[00:43:26.828 --> 00:43:27.468]  I couldn't believe that.
[00:43:28.428 --> 00:43:37.630]  Well, KABC, perhaps the most powerful drive time station in LA, invited both Congressman Schiff and I yesterday for a face-off.
[00:43:38.306 --> 00:43:40.548]  I don't need to tell you he was a no-show.
[00:43:40.588 --> 00:43:43.651]  Of course, he could have called in by phone, as I did.
[00:43:44.752 --> 00:43:48.815]  I'm still waiting to hear from both the House and the Senate Committee, but let me just reiterate.
[00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:50.437]  I don't need a subpoena.
[00:43:51.097 --> 00:43:52.959]  I'm not asking for immunity.
[00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:58.864]  And I want to testify to both bodies in public, not behind closed doors.
[00:44:00.018 --> 00:44:03.304]  Let's move on to the White House, because Alex, you're absolutely right.
[00:44:04.186 --> 00:44:10.137]  We now know, incredibly, that the President has gone to war with the Freedom Caucus.
[00:44:11.178 --> 00:44:16.083]  This makes little sense to me because the Freedom Caucus is made up of libertarians.
[00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:16.884]  It's his backbone.
[00:44:16.984 --> 00:44:18.046]  It's the people that run it.
[00:44:18.586 --> 00:44:20.048]  It's the people that run the party.
[00:44:20.368 --> 00:44:20.788]  That's right.
[00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:22.530]  These are his natural allies.
[00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:26.615]  And while that is true, you could never completely please them.
[00:44:26.635 --> 00:44:29.177]  That's the way some of us libertarians are.
[00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:40.516]  You could at least be giving them enough from a policy point of view that they would be your backbone and then you only have to convince the establishment Republicans to join you.
[00:44:40.896 --> 00:44:42.619]  Much easier than the other way around.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:43.961]  Here is the sad truth.
[00:44:44.855 --> 00:44:50.937]  The President's health care bill was drafted by former Speaker John Boehner and a team of lobbyists.
[00:44:51.557 --> 00:44:52.757]  It was passed to Ryan.
[00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:55.198]  Ryan passed it to Priebus.
[00:44:55.638 --> 00:45:00.039]  Priebus passed it off to the President and did him a disservice.
[00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:04.800]  This is not the best bill that could have been presented.
[00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:13.723]  If I were the President, I would simply say, well, now that the Ryan bill has failed, I'll introduce my own bill.
[00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:27.169]  Now Alex, please understand, anytime I criticize the president or his administration, it's out of loyalty to the president and my sincere desire that he succeed in his effort to throw off the goal.
[00:45:27.189 --> 00:45:29.831]  Absolutely, and it's a no-brainer that he's getting bad advice.
[00:45:33.877 --> 00:45:36.961]  He can disagree with the Freedom Caucus in trying to get a bill that's better than Obamacare passed.
[00:45:37.041 --> 00:45:37.642]  I understand that.
[00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:42.768]  But he can't sit there and say they're the enemy and stuff and watch the Democrats celebrate.
[00:45:43.008 --> 00:45:46.132]  I think he figured that out by this weekend meeting with Senator Paul.
[00:45:46.492 --> 00:45:51.598]  Paul handed it to us a few weeks ago when he was on, but also through some other channels that
[00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:59.805]  Trump just wants it to be on Congress and wants to get it repealed, period, but that he now is looking to actually work with Paul to try to craft something.
[00:45:59.825 --> 00:46:00.525]  So that's the word.
[00:46:00.565 --> 00:46:04.628]  Meanwhile, again, Rand Paul says he's very optimistic about repealing Obamacare after golfing with Trump.
[00:46:04.648 --> 00:46:05.169]  What do you make of that?
[00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.406]  You got there before I did.
[00:46:08.386 --> 00:46:19.092]  I was delighted to hear that those who were advocating the president meet with Senator Paul, bury the hatchet, and work together, and that that has happened.
[00:46:19.153 --> 00:46:24.455]  There was, of course, resistance to that among some on the White House staff.
[00:46:24.896 --> 00:46:32.260]  Then you had this bombshell story yesterday of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, leaving the administration
[00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:48.661]  After her financial disclosure forms showed that she was paid $300,000 from the Republican National Committee on top of her salary of $300,000.
[00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:49.001]  That's $600,000.
[00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:53.965]  But the $300,000 was paid to her through a dummy company controlled by her mother.
[00:46:55.366 --> 00:46:59.450]  This is the kind of person that was promoted for the White House staff.
[00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:04.757]  Uh, came over from the Republican National Committee, has now been discharged.
[00:47:05.357 --> 00:47:09.419]  Uh, it's vitally important that the President surround himself with loyalists.
[00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:10.979]  People like Ed Martin.
[00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:11.659]  That's right.
[00:47:11.799 --> 00:47:13.280]  People like David Urban.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.420]  People like Wayne Berman.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.061]  These are people who played an important role in his election.
[00:47:19.541 --> 00:47:21.462]  They don't need government jobs.
[00:47:21.522 --> 00:47:23.423]  They don't seek government jobs.
[00:47:23.443 --> 00:47:24.463]  They want to restore the Republic.
[00:47:25.083 --> 00:47:28.204]  But they would join the administration, uh, if they were asked.
[00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:37.446]  And I just use them as examples of people with enormous qualifications and experience, but who are deeply committed to the Trump agenda.
[00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:38.007]  Absolutely.
[00:47:38.087 --> 00:47:41.392]  But let's just move back to some of the bigger issues here.
[00:47:41.773 --> 00:47:42.874]  And obviously that's a huge issue.
[00:47:44.096 --> 00:47:50.460]  Trump just has to make the decision to kick out more of the establishment Republicans and realize he can't make them do his will to destroy the Republic.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.141]  They're going to backstab him at every turn.
[00:47:52.201 --> 00:47:55.022]  I think 74 days in, he's finally starting to get that.
[00:47:55.403 --> 00:47:58.324]  But going back here, what about the intel I'm getting?
[00:47:58.505 --> 00:48:04.428]  And I talked to you last night, you can confirm some of this, but you can't get into some of it because obviously it's conversations with the President and others.
[00:48:04.508 --> 00:48:05.789]  But looking at this,
[00:48:08.155 --> 00:48:32.067]  Nunes had to actually even be told about some of the things that were going on by only a few patriots that were even in the White House because Nunes didn't even know where to look and so that just shows that Trump is just surrounded by a bunch of either ignoramuses or people that are out to sabotage him because I mean in ten minutes I can give Trump advice if he executed it that the American people would be screaming for the heads of
[00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:42.677]  Well, Alex, since we spoke last night, I've actually learned more.
[00:48:43.578 --> 00:48:53.748]  The reason that two junior aides in the White House took this bombshell evidence to Chairman Nunes is because they knew Chairman Nunes could not be blocked from communicating it to the President.
[00:48:54.423 --> 00:49:06.269]  They did so because they did not think if they passed it up chain of command to some of the establishment Republicans at the top of the White House food chain that the information, vital information, would get to the President.
[00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.491]  This is why they gave it to Chairman Nunes.
[00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:14.814]  None of this makes the information less accurate, nor less true.
[00:49:15.354 --> 00:49:22.521]  So, it gives you the idea of the kind of treachery that we see among some in the Trump White House.
[00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:26.845]  Here's another piece of news, Alex, and I think this is key.
[00:49:27.986 --> 00:49:38.395]  There is no question now that sources tell me that the President's son-in-law enjoys a very lively text exchange with Joe Scarborough.
[00:49:39.085 --> 00:49:53.192]  And Scarborough's repeated attacks on Steve Bannon, not to mention some of his attacks on the president, clearly are being manipulated by Jared Kushner for his own internal purposes.
[00:49:53.272 --> 00:50:05.017]  Now, again, any criticism that I have of the Trump administration or any member thereof, and Mr. Kushner is one, are meant to be constructive, not destructive.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:10.741]  But, in this case, Joe Scarborough is no friend of the President.
[00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:14.282]  He revels in passing fake news.
[00:50:15.202 --> 00:50:20.743]  He himself has more scandals than you can shake a stick at that he is sitting on top of.
[00:50:20.763 --> 00:50:21.683]  Byron, let me stop you.
[00:50:21.743 --> 00:50:23.644]  Is this in the news or is this from your sources?
[00:50:24.004 --> 00:50:30.825]  What the hell is Jared Kushner doing talking to a guy that has a dead intern in his office and is an absolute scumbag?
[00:50:31.465 --> 00:50:35.210]  Well, I didn't say those things you did, but this has not hit the news.
[00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.133]  This is breaking right now on InfoWars.
[00:50:38.894 --> 00:50:44.260]  And that is the back channel between the President's son-in-law and Joe Scarborough.
[00:50:45.138 --> 00:50:48.422]  Hold on, let's talk about this more when we come back, because I don't want to run Jared down.
[00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.545]  He looks like a smart guy, good looking guy.
[00:50:51.085 --> 00:50:52.828]  Clearly grooming him to be president, great.
[00:50:53.268 --> 00:50:59.976]  But not if he's not smart enough to sit there and play patty cake with the likes of Joe Scarborough, some of the lowest trash on earth.
[00:51:00.236 --> 00:51:01.178]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:51:04.736 --> 00:51:13.539]  We happen to know Chris Tonto-Piranto, of course, one of the big heroes and survivors of what happened in Benghazi, and of course, lionized properly so in the new film, 13 Hours.
[00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:15.340]  It's a big hit and so amazing.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.681]  To ask, what do you think we should do?
[00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:23.983]  We should start a discussion about the left thinking and Soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities.
[00:51:24.183 --> 00:51:25.084]  They're planning something.
[00:51:25.284 --> 00:51:27.785]  So, Chris, thank you for joining us and coming on.
[00:51:27.805 --> 00:51:28.885]  Obviously, everything you've done.
[00:51:28.945 --> 00:51:31.046]  ChrisTontoPiranto.com.
[00:51:31.326 --> 00:51:33.187]  I've kind of set the table the last four minutes.
[00:51:33.567 --> 00:51:34.087]  Yeah.
[00:51:34.547 --> 00:51:35.648]  Where are we going with this?
[00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:41.012]  Honestly, I think right now it's just a lot of lib talk.
[00:51:41.952 --> 00:51:47.056]  It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to try to start some civil war going on.
[00:51:47.076 --> 00:51:59.905]  You've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now, plenty of people like myself that are patriots that aren't going to stand aside and let some coup, if you want to call it that, take over.
[00:52:00.545 --> 00:52:02.486]  I don't think it's realistic.
[00:52:02.566 --> 00:52:04.847]  I think again, it's a lot of threats and the libs do that.
[00:52:04.867 --> 00:52:07.908]  They are a lot of talk, but when action comes and it comes to actually picking up a gun and doing something,
[00:52:21.574 --> 00:52:27.737]  I think if they were more inclined to protect this country, you'd probably see more of them joining the military, joining the law enforcement.
[00:52:28.157 --> 00:52:33.259]  And so I just see it as a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time.
[00:52:33.279 --> 00:52:35.360]  But if it comes to this, it's not going to be tough talk.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.622]  Believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[00:52:40.642 --> 00:52:42.483]  So I just warn them, don't.
[00:52:42.623 --> 00:52:50.226]  Just stop that BS and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[00:52:50.626 --> 00:53:01.470]  When they're openly calling for his death everywhere, and my death and everybody else, and it's just horrible, at a certain point it becomes dereliction of duty if somebody doesn't get indicted, if somebody doesn't get in trouble.
[00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:09.914]  You know, when Bow Wow, you know, says, I want to kidnap and rape and enslave the First Lady, or when, you know, his uncle...
[00:53:10.794 --> 00:53:12.375]  That's true, and you have a good point there.
[00:53:12.395 --> 00:53:17.039]  And in the past, if you did that, then the Secret Service would be knocking at your door, and possibly you'd be going to prison.
[00:53:28.447 --> 00:53:29.768]  I think that needs to happen.
[00:53:29.788 --> 00:53:30.729]  I think it needs to return.
[00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:32.930]  There does need to be an example set.
[00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:38.855]  Whether it be Snoop Dogg or somebody else out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the President, that's a threat.
[00:53:38.935 --> 00:53:40.776]  That is a terroristic threat at this point.
[00:53:40.796 --> 00:53:42.057]  But you can't keep letting it go.
[00:53:42.117 --> 00:53:43.178]  You're correct.
[00:53:43.218 --> 00:53:45.019]  You've got to lance that blister eventually.
[00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:46.240]  If not, it's going to get infected.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.140]  You've got to do it.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.562]  And if you don't, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:53:49.582 --> 00:53:51.003]  So I do agree.
[00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:53.024]  I do agree at this point with the threats to the President.
[00:53:53.105 --> 00:53:56.367]  But again, do I think that they're going to come out and actually start an all-out war?
[00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:58.348]  Civil War in the United States of America.
[00:53:59.628 --> 00:54:01.929]  They'd be well-earned to not do that.
[00:54:11.892 --> 00:54:13.693]  They wailed against the crown.
[00:54:15.254 --> 00:54:17.014]  Another ragtag band.
[00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:21.736]  Declaring independence.
[00:54:24.918 --> 00:54:28.859]  Yeah, we're free today, thanks to the renegades!
[00:54:50.095 --> 00:54:52.456]  Well, he's got this little segment, one more segment with us.
[00:54:53.096 --> 00:55:00.339]  Roger Stone has breaking bombshell news exclusive on Jared Kushner there in the White House.
[00:55:00.359 --> 00:55:06.822]  The son-in-law of President Trump, who is at the center basically of everything now.
[00:55:07.362 --> 00:55:12.785]  And his communications with Joe Scarborough, a Democratic Party operative,
[00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:16.616]  Conservative turncoat, basically, in my view.
[00:55:16.876 --> 00:55:19.216]  But here is those bombshell developments.
[00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:21.597]  Roger tells me it is just sensational.
[00:55:21.617 --> 00:55:22.237]  Please continue.
[00:55:23.437 --> 00:55:36.901]  Alex, first of all, let me say that any time I level a criticism at the Trump administration, or even rarely at the president himself, I do so out of loyalty to Donald Trump and loyalty to his agenda.
[00:55:37.061 --> 00:55:41.022]  I want to help him beat back the globalists and make this country great again.
[00:55:41.778 --> 00:55:52.263]  That said, my political experience with Ronald Reagan, and before that, Richard Nixon, tells me that a White House divided against itself cannot stand.
[00:55:52.783 --> 00:56:02.768]  And the internal squabbling between the establishment wing and the diminished true believers continues inside the White House.
[00:56:03.628 --> 00:56:06.710]  Yes, the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner,
[00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:17.315]  Perhaps the one presidential aide who cannot be fired is now in the regular text message communications with Joe Scarborough.
[00:56:17.815 --> 00:56:28.200]  Many of the anti-Steve Bannon stories that you see, the themes that you see on Morning Joe are being dictated by Kushner.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.202]  And while Mr. Kushner's plate is very full with
[00:56:33.702 --> 00:56:37.725]  Middle Eastern peace and the China visit and so on.
[00:56:38.605 --> 00:56:42.087]  In this case, I think he is disserving of the president.
[00:56:42.828 --> 00:56:48.371]  Scarborough himself is a badly flawed carrier for this message.
[00:56:49.212 --> 00:56:53.715]  He is bitter with jealousy since he wanted to run for president.
[00:56:54.655 --> 00:56:59.058]  He nurses ideas of coming back to Florida and running for governor.
[00:56:59.927 --> 00:57:10.420]  I'd have to jump into the Republican primary to stop him if he really tried that, although there are certainly much, much better candidates than Joe Scarborough or Roger Stone.
[00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:15.747]  So there you have it, and more of this story as it develops.
[00:57:17.383 --> 00:57:18.283]  This is just incredible.
[00:57:18.363 --> 00:57:27.707]  So Joe Scarborough, and I know your sources are impeccable, you've never given me a story that didn't turn out to be true, Roger, is the main leaker against Bannon.
[00:57:27.787 --> 00:57:35.991]  I know you can't get into sources, but you were telling me off-air this is very extensive, you don't want to talk about it over the phone, that this is really confirmed, and that it's really, really bad.
[00:57:36.291 --> 00:57:42.874]  Were you speaking during the break, because we didn't have time to get to it, on what Kushner's doing or what Scarborough's doing?
[00:57:43.806 --> 00:57:58.500]  Well, Pushner is clearly feeding the lines and the intel to Scarborough, and Scarborough is visiting those on Pushner's internal rivals, or those who are arguing against the globalist agenda.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:07.568]  If you go back to some of our earlier discussions here at InfoWars, I've said repeatedly that my greatest concern was not Liberal Democrats.
[00:58:08.177 --> 00:58:12.178]  But establishment Republicans who would undo the Trump revolution.
[00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:12.938]  Stay right there.
[00:58:12.958 --> 00:58:13.518]  We gotta go to break.
[00:58:13.538 --> 00:58:14.319]  We'll do five more minutes.
[00:58:14.339 --> 00:58:15.579]  But Roger Stone, let me ask you this.
[00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:22.341]  Do we think it's Kushner, because we thought it was Priebus from our sources, that's going around telling the press that the president was like a lost child?
[00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:29.003]  I think that is people below Priebus, but people that Priebus has selected.
[00:58:29.083 --> 00:58:33.244]  Because that is not in either Kushner's or Priebus's interest.
[00:58:34.056 --> 00:58:35.958]  And they're not, these are not stupid people.
[00:58:35.978 --> 00:58:42.886]  The question is, what the hell, if Kushner's not dumb, is he doing sitting there pen-palling with that piece of garbage Scarborough?
[00:58:42.906 --> 00:58:44.788]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with Roger Stone.
[00:58:45.028 --> 00:58:46.270]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:47.531]  Get his book today.
[00:58:47.551 --> 00:58:48.753]  I don't care where you get it, get it.
[00:58:54.209 --> 00:59:01.055]  So after weeks, what is now the largest House Intelligence Committee investigation ever, we get this from Democratic head Adam Schiff.
[00:59:10.583 --> 00:59:15.206]  But let's go back in time to a time when the Democrats were back-channeling with the Russians.
[00:59:15.546 --> 00:59:16.207]  Here's the headline.
[00:59:16.367 --> 00:59:20.969]  Ted Kennedy secretly asked the Soviets to intervene in the 1984 elections.
[00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:31.136]  According to Soviet documents unearthed in the 1990s, Kennedy literally asked the Soviets, avowed enemies of the U.S., to intervene on behalf of the Democratic Party in the 1984 elections.
[00:59:31.596 --> 00:59:33.417]  So what we have is another piece of evidence.
[00:59:33.677 --> 00:59:39.381]  Ain't it funny how we always see the Democrats pointing their finger, making accusations, and then when you do a little looking,
[00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:45.084]  It's always the Democrats that are the ones colluding, conniving, and backstabbing.
[00:59:45.524 --> 00:59:47.105]  I think Pat Buchanan said it best.
[00:59:47.505 --> 00:59:49.827]  They've been investigating this garbage for months.
[00:59:50.327 --> 00:59:53.329]  Rob, you're reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:59:55.190 --> 01:00:01.093]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.623 --> 01:00:14.204]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:15.845]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.905 --> 01:00:17.626]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.666 --> 01:00:24.891]  So there's a total mutiny against the president.
[01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:28.092]  On another note, we were just talking about how he's getting audited and harassed by the IRS.
[01:00:28.573 --> 01:00:29.633]  You know, we constantly do.
[01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:36.017]  And then Trump can't even fire the guy at the IRS that got caught doing all this horrible stuff, because the whole bureaucracy is just ignoring Trump.
[01:00:36.057 --> 01:00:36.838]  It's a total mutiny.
[01:00:37.078 --> 01:00:37.918]  So what does he do?
[01:00:37.998 --> 01:00:40.020]  Well, first, he gets a clean team.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.041]  I don't know what his daughter's going to do to him if he throws Jared out.
[01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:44.681]  I know that he likes Jared, they're friends.
[01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:46.802]  I think Jared's really taking advantage of that.
[01:00:47.422 --> 01:00:49.623]  Sometimes family does that when they're involved in an operation.
[01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:51.323]  That's just the way it goes.
[01:00:51.383 --> 01:00:53.284]  But Roger, you were saying there's a lot.
[01:00:53.624 --> 01:00:56.024]  What is specifically going on here?
[01:00:56.845 --> 01:01:01.986]  Well, I don't question Jared Kushner's loyalty to the president, but I do question his vision.
[01:01:03.166 --> 01:01:09.188]  Alex, he's a liberal Democrat from a very prominent family of liberal Democrats in New Jersey.
[01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.670]  I don't think he understands the Trump coalition.
[01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.531]  I don't think he understands... Well, does he understand family?
[01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:17.072]  And if he wants to be in that administration, he'll do what the president wants?
[01:01:17.252 --> 01:01:18.233]  That he's not the president?
[01:01:18.353 --> 01:01:19.173]  Does he understand that?
[01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:26.077]  Well, I think at this point he probably believes he is giving the president good advice, when in fact he's giving him bad advice.
[01:01:26.137 --> 01:01:30.039]  I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on motive by Alex.
[01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:33.480]  He doesn't understand the InfoWars watcher.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.121]  He doesn't understand the Breitbart reader.
[01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:38.601]  We are the backbone of the Trump revolution.
[01:01:38.981 --> 01:01:40.982]  We are the soldiers who won this election.
[01:01:41.382 --> 01:01:47.083]  And we do not want to see the revolution hijacked by a bunch of establishment Republican geeks.
[01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.024]  He has to get that through his head.
[01:01:50.504 --> 01:01:52.125]  What else is in these texts?
[01:01:52.325 --> 01:01:55.926]  I mean, you can't tell us how you learned of it, but other little tidbits of that, Roger.
[01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:56.566]  This is a big story.
[01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:09.403]  Well, I think if you go back and watch Morning Joe now, retrospectively, the last several weeks, you will see a coordinated attack on our colleague and our fellow patriot, Steve Bannon.
[01:02:10.464 --> 01:02:25.029]  The other question that's looming here, Alex, is the way that the Silicon Valley billionaires are whining and dining Jared Kushner and his wife, who is a good friend of mine and a great lady, Ivanka Trump.
[01:02:25.689 --> 01:02:30.130]  Meanwhile, Google, Facebook, they're slowly squeezing our throats.
[01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:38.092]  You, me, Cernovich, Breitbart, and other alternative media sources see them fooling with our logarithms.
[01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:53.776]  We're the main guns that are defending Trump and saving him at every front while people in his White House are whining and dining the people that are strangling the Republic right now and trying to destroy him and pushing down his tweets and manipulating him.
[01:02:54.969 --> 01:03:02.151]  Well, and if anybody in the world should understand this, of course it's Steve Bannon, who comes from the world of alternative media.
[01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:12.414]  We've got a slowdown going on here that I think is only going to be solved with antitrust action against Google and some other tactics that we are working on.
[01:03:12.474 --> 01:03:18.416]  But I have no intention of going quietly and watching them cut off our access.
[01:03:18.636 --> 01:03:18.916]  Sure.
[01:03:19.276 --> 01:03:19.857]  Even U.S.
[01:03:19.877 --> 01:03:20.797]  News and World Report.
[01:03:21.477 --> 01:03:21.837]  Even U.S.
[01:03:21.857 --> 01:03:24.520]  News & World Report admits Google is the top censor in the world.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.704]  Microsoft, they're all doing it, and they admit they're doing it to us.
[01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:40.574]  And David Brock, literally, who brags he got you banned off TV, the MVP, Roger Stone, not because you were full of bull, but because you were effective, they're bragging that they're openly working with Google to shut us down.
[01:03:40.634 --> 01:03:41.815]  Talk about tortuous interference.
[01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:45.559]  I just don't have the time or energy for lawsuits, but my lawyers tell me I've got them.
[01:03:46.727 --> 01:03:48.689]  Well, I have examined that.
[01:03:48.809 --> 01:03:56.055]  In all honesty, Brock has to say something because he pocketed 30 or 40 million dollars from rich, dumb, liberal donors.
[01:03:57.136 --> 01:04:06.043]  And despite their enormous spending advantage and the fact that they were manipulating internet media and manipulating mainstream media, they lost.
[01:04:07.063 --> 01:04:07.763]  I don't know.
[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:23.711]  This is a slippery slope.
[01:04:42.657 --> 01:04:44.980]  We're winning, but the enemy is attacking.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:51.366]  This is when the battle's got to be pressed, the attack has got to be pushed to its maximum ramming speed.
[01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:55.430]  Spread those links for the four wins continually, and we will defeat the globalists.
[01:04:55.811 --> 01:04:57.633]  And spread the word about our local affiliates.
[01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:58.734]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[01:04:58.774 --> 01:04:59.555]  Big guest coming up.
[01:05:03.675 --> 01:05:13.942]  Well, I can't figure out why we haven't gone to war with Russia yet, especially after hearing the words of Senator Mark Warner, talking about the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:05:14.263 --> 01:05:27.672]  There were upwards of thousands of paid internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia, in effect taking over a series computers, which are then called a botnet, that can then generate news down to specific areas, Warner said.
[01:05:27.852 --> 01:05:32.636]  This actually kind of sounds like Tolkien fantasy, because if you look at who the queen of the trolls is, it's Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:32.876 --> 01:05:44.141]  In fact, her Clinton super PAC, Correct the Record, spent $1 million on project Breaking Barriers to pay people to respond to negative information about Clinton on social media sites like Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and Twitter.
[01:05:44.281 --> 01:05:46.302]  That amount grew as large as $6 million.
[01:05:46.603 --> 01:05:48.484]  And who is the head of this operation?
[01:05:48.824 --> 01:05:50.905]  Media Matters and David Brock.
[01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:53.326]  And Clinton's use of trolls went as far back as 2007.
[01:05:54.907 --> 01:05:59.889]  If you want to find an army of trolls that would make sour men proud, then go to the Democratic Party.
[01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:03.053]  Rob, you're reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:06.456 --> 01:06:07.818]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[01:06:07.858 --> 01:06:09.120]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:06:10.126 --> 01:06:10.466]  Great!
[01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:11.547]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:16.050]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:17.752]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:25.397]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:06:25.417 --> 01:06:26.318]  Wow, thank you.
[01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.640]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.281]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:33.842]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:06:34.002 --> 01:06:35.062]  That's really incredible.
[01:06:35.262 --> 01:06:38.303]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:06:38.323 --> 01:06:39.623]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[01:06:39.683 --> 01:06:41.264]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:06:41.344 --> 01:06:42.504]  And I love you guys.
[01:06:42.584 --> 01:06:43.984]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:06:44.745 --> 01:06:51.446]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:06:51.606 --> 01:06:52.386]  You will love it.
[01:06:52.647 --> 01:06:53.107]  I'm telling you.
[01:06:53.127 --> 01:06:54.467]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:06:54.767 --> 01:06:59.153]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:59.213 --> 01:06:59.954]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:00.855]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:13.337 --> 01:07:21.249]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:24.393]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[01:07:25.199 --> 01:07:27.040]  And they're also very affordable.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:27.380]  Exactly.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.200]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.541]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:33.722]  We've both talked to them.
[01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:43.025]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:44.986]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:46.306]  We refuse to do that.
[01:07:46.686 --> 01:07:48.667]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:07:49.207 --> 01:07:55.951]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[01:07:56.331 --> 01:07:57.092]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:57.572 --> 01:07:58.593]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:09.239 --> 01:08:09.880]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.420]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:11.861]  You like him?
[01:08:13.226 --> 01:08:14.488]  Oh, that's good.
[01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:15.228]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.288 --> 01:08:15.749]  Nice guy.
[01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:23.858]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[01:08:23.878 --> 01:08:25.360]  Your reputation is amazing.
[01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:27.142]  I will not let you down.
[01:08:27.322 --> 01:08:30.206]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:08:30.766 --> 01:08:35.507]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[01:08:35.527 --> 01:08:38.208]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:42.669]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.710]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:46.130]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:47.791]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[01:08:47.831 --> 01:08:48.571]  It was in Drudge.
[01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:49.891]  Who's great, by the way.
[01:08:49.931 --> 01:08:51.172]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:55.436]  But the story in Drudge and Big Store, it's all over the place, man.
[01:08:56.136 --> 01:08:59.179]  Guys swimming across in big bags of stuff.
[01:08:59.439 --> 01:08:59.940]  It's drugs.
[01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:03.884]  Swimming across the river, right?
[01:09:04.584 --> 01:09:05.385]  Swimming right across.
[01:09:05.926 --> 01:09:07.667]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:09:08.288 --> 01:09:09.089]  They're jumping in.
[01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:10.130]  They just jumped in rafts.
[01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:11.891]  They're coming up 1, 2, 3, 4.
[01:09:13.353 --> 01:09:14.334]  They have big satchels.
[01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:20.902]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:09:21.702 --> 01:09:24.784]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff.
[01:09:24.824 --> 01:09:25.324]  It was drugs.
[01:09:32.148 --> 01:09:32.328]  Thank you.
[01:09:32.348 --> 01:09:34.749]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:35.690]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:37.911]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.
[01:09:37.951 --> 01:09:38.311]  Thank you.
[01:09:38.932 --> 01:09:39.492]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:45.119]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:47.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:49.162 --> 01:10:04.914]  Last week, when Jean-Claude Junkers of the most powerful Nazi supporting family, Prussian royalty, that's the German military state, former the Austrian-Hungarian Empire military state,
[01:10:07.372 --> 01:10:16.539]  The main aircraft producer for the Nazis in World War II, so war profiteer criminals, they captured Luxembourg during the war and never gave it up.
[01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:17.820]  You wonder where the Nazi money went?
[01:10:20.441 --> 01:10:23.704]  I mean, there's books written about the Junkers.
[01:10:24.264 --> 01:10:26.065]  I call them Junkers, as an insult.
[01:10:28.527 --> 01:10:30.749]  And this creature.
[01:10:33.177 --> 01:10:33.417]  I don't
[01:10:55.578 --> 01:11:02.362]  We have Spanish members of Parliament, EU members of Parliament, I have a stack of news here, threatening war with the UK.
[01:11:02.382 --> 01:11:03.122]  This is insane.
[01:11:03.643 --> 01:11:12.407]  Now you have the Prime Minister saying, well, if they try to take the Rock of Gibraltar, that's been British control for hundreds of years, you know, controlling the entrance to the Mediterranean, we'll go to war, just like the Falkland War.
[01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:17.650]  So now we have a Spanish gunship entering British waters off Gibraltar.
[01:11:20.772 --> 01:11:21.693]  This is unprecedented.
[01:11:22.739 --> 01:11:24.720]  So, what is going on?
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:32.163]  Former top advisor to Margaret Thatcher, kind of the prototype guy helping, you know, found UKIP that's now spread all over Europe.
[01:11:34.064 --> 01:11:36.665]  The chief scientist out there exposing all the climate change fraud.
[01:11:36.705 --> 01:11:40.306]  Of course, we have the lowest hurricane level ever recorded now this year, they just announced.
[01:11:40.326 --> 01:11:41.527]  We're not going to get into all that.
[01:11:41.607 --> 01:11:45.508]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org, whatsupwiththat.com, Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:11:45.928 --> 01:11:47.229]  I won't go over all of that.
[01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:49.511]  And the media goes, don't call him a lord.
[01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:50.732]  They disbanded the House of Lords.
[01:11:50.812 --> 01:11:51.653]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:51.973 --> 01:11:52.734]  That's his dad.
[01:11:52.794 --> 01:11:53.234]  That's him.
[01:11:53.294 --> 01:11:54.415]  He's a patriot.
[01:11:54.655 --> 01:11:55.556]  It's fun to say.
[01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:58.299]  I love how they play these semantical games.
[01:11:59.359 --> 01:12:03.423]  So, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, with Lord Christopher Monckton, a super patriot.
[01:12:03.523 --> 01:12:06.165]  We see nationalism rising, globalism panicking.
[01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:07.527]  What are they going to do?
[01:12:07.867 --> 01:12:08.868]  That's my second question.
[01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:12.071]  What does he make of what's happening currently in the world?
[01:12:12.671 --> 01:12:27.775]  The left's alliance with radical Islam, just the state of the world with Lord Monckton, and what's happening with all these EU bureaucrats, unelected dictators, threatening economic war, physical war, EU armies, threatening to march them in.
[01:12:28.235 --> 01:12:30.155]  I mean, I guess we didn't take that serious in 1939 either.
[01:12:30.175 --> 01:12:30.715]  What is going on?
[01:12:30.735 --> 01:12:32.096]  It's when a Nazi heir is threatening us.
[01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:56.697]  Everything that the appalling John Claude Juncker has said merely reinforces the reasons why it was so necessary for us in the United Kingdom to have nothing further to do with the dictatorial, fascistic, communist European Union.
[01:12:56.737 --> 01:12:59.919]  The tyranny by clerk, because that's what they really are.
[01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:05.541]  These people whose ambition vastly exceeds their competence.
[01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:24.573]  have responded in a petulant, childish and arrogant way to what was, on any view, a thoughtful, considered and very friendly six-page letter from our Prime Minister, Theresa May, notifying them on March the 29th.
[01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:33.560]  That Britain would be, in two years' time, on March the 29th, 2019, quitting the European Union.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:43.187]  Now, Theresa May deliberately went to great lengths to say how much Britain feels that it is part of Europe.
[01:13:43.407 --> 01:13:48.751]  Because we have no quarrel with Europe.
[01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:52.354]  Our quarrel is with the dictators of the European Union.
[01:13:52.874 --> 01:14:01.197]  And the reason why we don't like the European Union is that the European Union is anti-European because it is anti-democratic.
[01:14:01.277 --> 01:14:07.799]  It was Europe that gave the world the name and the reality of democracy.
[01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.580]  It was the ancient Greeks who did that.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:16.364]  And it is Europe now, in the shape of the European Union, that rejects democracy.
[01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:23.369]  And when this very civilized letter, on any view a very civilized letter, was sent by Theresa May, great thought had gone into it.
[01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:26.832]  A very responsible, very statesman-like letter.
[01:14:27.612 --> 01:14:42.082]  What has happened since is enormous petulance on the part of the EU, and some bureaucrats thought they'd have some fun saying that if anything in the negotiations affected Gibraltar, the government of Spain would have to be asked.
[01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:45.504]  Well now, here is how the law actually works.
[01:14:46.244 --> 01:14:50.207]  By the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Spain agreed that Gibraltar was British.
[01:14:54.009 --> 01:14:55.109]  That is the law.
[01:14:55.169 --> 01:14:56.650]  That is the international treaty.
[01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:58.070]  It hasn't been revoked.
[01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.290]  It hasn't been repealed.
[01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:06.332]  We are both bound by that just as much now as we were in 1713 when both parties signed it.
[01:15:07.012 --> 01:15:11.873]  So let us have no more nonsense from the EU bureaucrats about grabbing Gibraltar.
[01:15:11.893 --> 01:15:19.115]  And of course, quite rightly, several Conservative members of Parliament have got on their high horses and they've said if the
[01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:22.457]  EU is going to threaten Gibraltar.
[01:15:22.817 --> 01:15:28.081]  We will take whatever steps, military or other, to defend the people of Gibraltar.
[01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:40.709]  As recently as 2004, that was the most recent of many occasions on which the people of Gibraltar have been asked by referendum, do they even want Spain to have a slightly increased share in the government of Gibraltar?
[01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:44.411]  And the answer was 99.7% no.
[01:15:45.132 --> 01:15:49.495]  They want to remain entirely, completely and splendidly British.
[01:15:49.975 --> 01:15:52.658]  So there's going to be no more nonsense about Gibraltar.
[01:15:52.698 --> 01:15:53.819]  We're not having that.
[01:15:54.279 --> 01:16:15.778]  What it does indicate is bad faith on the part of those in the European Union who, on the one hand, insist that we should comply with the letter as well as the spirit of the European treaties, while at the same time saying that they feel that they and Spain can get together for the sake of spiting and harming Gibraltar and spiting Britain.
[01:16:16.358 --> 01:16:24.982]  Ignoring the Treaty of Utrecht, which is just as much a treaty and just as much binding and just as much current as the European treaties are.
[01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:26.562]  So that's that one.
[01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.223]  Let's have no more nonsense.
[01:16:28.263 --> 01:16:29.043]  Well, let me correct you.
[01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:37.987]  Under law, Lord Monckton, international law, common law, European law, British law, isn't the fact that it's almost 300 years old make it even stronger by right of possession?
[01:16:39.426 --> 01:16:41.609]  Well of course it isn't right of possession, it's a treaty.
[01:16:41.649 --> 01:16:44.873]  Well it's right of treaty and right of exercise and right of everything.
[01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:49.780]  That's right, I mean you could say by long custom and practice.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.022]  That's it, that's the right term.
[01:16:51.242 --> 01:16:53.004]  Long custom and practice, that's what I was looking for.
[01:16:53.024 --> 01:16:54.326]  That's right, absolutely.
[01:16:54.426 --> 01:17:02.472]  And, of course, they would argue, on the other hand, just as Argentina tried to do with the Falklands, that territorial contiguity gives them some rights.
[01:17:02.512 --> 01:17:06.976]  In other words, their territory is closer to Gibraltar than British territory is.
[01:17:07.236 --> 01:17:09.097]  Well, that's not how it works.
[01:17:09.237 --> 01:17:11.159]  Not in the post-colonial era.
[01:17:11.639 --> 01:17:17.725]  You see, Spain and Argentina are still living in the colonial era, where you can go around and help yourself to profit.
[01:17:17.745 --> 01:17:18.906]  So is Juncker, isn't he?
[01:17:18.986 --> 01:17:19.906]  So is Juncker.
[01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:20.847]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:29.915]  But you see, in the post-colonial era, what determines sovereignty above all else, above even treaties, is what's called the right of self-determination.
[01:17:29.955 --> 01:17:30.216]  Isn't that 1776?
[01:17:30.256 --> 01:17:30.776]  That's America.
[01:17:33.098 --> 01:17:36.241]  Well, that's exactly what you did, whether we liked it or not, in 1776.
[01:17:36.821 --> 01:17:49.893]  And as you know, Alex, I have a standing offer on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, and I'm happy to convey it to you now, that if only you will in future remember to put your tea in the teapot rather than in the harbour, because it tastes better that way.
[01:17:50.473 --> 01:17:58.035]  We will remit all the taxes and imposts upon you, save only the original tax of half a crown a pound on tea.
[01:17:58.375 --> 01:18:02.437]  And I think you'll find that a great bargain for the restoration of British government.
[01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:06.238]  We'll be far cheaper, certainly than the Obama administration was.
[01:18:06.418 --> 01:18:07.718]  Probably a lot better, yeah.
[01:18:08.078 --> 01:18:12.480]  You know, do feel free to return to the British crown at any time you like.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.360]  You will be welcomed with open arms.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.081]  But more seriously,
[01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:35.619]  One of the things that I'm doing in June on the 23rd and the 24th in Bozeman, Montana is we're going to hold a thing called the Red Pill Expo and you can go to redpillexpo.org and make your booking to come to that conference where we're going to be discussing all these issues that
[01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:43.424]  Brexit and of course all the problems that Mr. Trump faces with unwilling bureaucrats and the Democrats rioting in the streets and so forth.
[01:18:43.724 --> 01:18:46.726]  We're going to be discussing all that at the Red Pill Expo.
[01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:53.110]  If you go to redpillexpo.org you can make your booking there and I'd love to see you there Alex.
[01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:54.191]  I know I've been invited.
[01:18:54.251 --> 01:19:01.516]  I'm launching a bunch of projects but soon I'm gonna come to some of the conferences here at Lord Monte because I want to see you again in person as we've done.
[01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:05.339]  Now we're gonna come back in the next segment but we've got 30 seconds here or 40 seconds.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:07.707]  How is the New World Order doing right now?
[01:19:07.727 --> 01:19:09.033]  I mean, they say they're falling apart.
[01:19:09.073 --> 01:19:09.515]  Is that true?
[01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:17.733]  There's no doubt that the people who think that nation-states still have a future are in the ascendant at the moment.
[01:19:18.014 --> 01:19:22.797]  We won Brexit and now we are going to leave the European Union, whatever the result of the negotiations.
[01:19:23.117 --> 01:19:31.082]  Mr Trump, splendidly, whom I campaigned for in Montana during the election campaign, I'm thrilled that he's now the President of the United States.
[01:19:31.382 --> 01:19:33.563]  He's already unwound all the climate rubbish.
[01:19:33.843 --> 01:19:39.587]  He's gradually pushing back on that and many other so-called globalist agendas, and of course they're not really
[01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:48.671]  Let's talk about the state of the fight for sovereignty, and we'll talk about the French election and so much more in one more segment with Lord Monckton of scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:19:49.031 --> 01:19:52.732]  We've got a bunch of other guests joining us with huge breaking news today as well.
[01:19:53.052 --> 01:19:56.014]  The revolution against globalist tyranny is exploding.
[01:19:56.314 --> 01:19:57.154]  Be part of it today.
[01:19:57.274 --> 01:19:57.955]  Share these links.
[01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:01.356]  Share these videos, because the censorship is unparalleled.
[01:20:04.537 --> 01:20:13.359]  We happen to know Chris Tonto-Piranto, of course one of the big heroes and survivors of what happened in Benghazi and of course lionized properly so in the new film 13 Hours.
[01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:15.139]  It's so big hit and so amazing.
[01:20:15.179 --> 01:20:16.479]  To ask, what do you think we should do?
[01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:23.780]  We should start a discussion about the left thinking and Soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.880]  They're planning something.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.701]  So Chris, thank you for joining us and coming on and obviously everything you've done.
[01:20:28.761 --> 01:20:30.841]  ChrisTontoPiranto.com.
[01:20:31.142 --> 01:20:33.002]  I've kind of set the table the last four minutes.
[01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:33.882]  Yeah.
[01:20:34.342 --> 01:20:35.463]  Where are we going with this?
[01:20:36.643 --> 01:20:40.825]  Honestly, I think right now it's just a lot of lib talk.
[01:20:41.766 --> 01:20:46.868]  It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to start a civil war going on.
[01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:59.714]  You've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now, plenty of people like myself that are patriots that aren't going to stand aside and let some coup, if you want to call it that, take over.
[01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:02.296]  I don't think it's realistic.
[01:21:02.356 --> 01:21:04.659]  I think again, it's a lot of threats and the libs do that.
[01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:07.721]  They are a lot of talk, but when action comes and it comes to actually picking up a gun and doing something,
[01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:27.538]  I think if they were more inclined to protect this country, you'd probably see more of them joining the military, joining the law enforcement.
[01:21:27.959 --> 01:21:33.062]  And so I just see it as a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time.
[01:21:33.102 --> 01:21:35.163]  But if it comes to this, it's not going to be tough talk.
[01:21:35.644 --> 01:21:40.427]  Believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[01:21:40.447 --> 01:21:42.288]  So I just warn them, don't.
[01:21:42.448 --> 01:21:50.053]  Just stop that BS and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[01:21:50.433 --> 01:21:55.596]  When they're openly calling for his death everywhere, and my death and everybody else, it's just horrible.
[01:21:55.957 --> 01:22:01.280]  At a certain point, it becomes dereliction of duty if somebody doesn't get indicted, if somebody doesn't get in trouble.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:09.726]  You know, when Bow Wow, you know, says, I want to kidnap and rape and enslave the First Lady, or when, you know, his uncle...
[01:22:10.606 --> 01:22:10.946]  That's true.
[01:22:10.966 --> 01:22:12.187]  And you have a good point there.
[01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:16.851]  And in the past, if you did that, then the Secret Service would be knocking at your door and possibly you'd be going to prison.
[01:22:28.259 --> 01:22:29.580]  I think that needs to happen.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.541]  I think it needs to return.
[01:22:30.581 --> 01:22:32.742]  There does need to be an example set.
[01:22:33.063 --> 01:22:38.687]  Whether it be Snoop Dogg or somebody else out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the President, that's a threat.
[01:22:38.747 --> 01:22:40.588]  That is a terroristic threat at this point.
[01:22:40.608 --> 01:22:41.869]  But you can't keep letting it go.
[01:22:41.929 --> 01:22:42.990]  You're correct.
[01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.831]  You've got to lance that blister eventually.
[01:22:44.871 --> 01:22:46.052]  If not, it's going to get infected.
[01:22:46.312 --> 01:22:46.952]  You've got to do it.
[01:22:47.032 --> 01:22:49.374]  And if you don't, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:22:49.394 --> 01:22:50.815]  So I do agree.
[01:22:50.895 --> 01:22:52.836]  I do agree at this point with the threats to the President.
[01:22:52.917 --> 01:22:56.179]  But again, do I think that they're going to come out and actually start an all-out war?
[01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:58.101]  Civil War in the United States of America.
[01:22:59.422 --> 01:23:01.705]  They'd be well-earned to not do that.
[01:23:03.697 --> 01:23:05.079]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:23:05.119 --> 01:23:06.200]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.381]  Why is this so good?
[01:23:07.661 --> 01:23:12.905]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:23:12.985 --> 01:23:26.556]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:23:26.596 --> 01:23:27.978]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:23:28.758 --> 01:23:30.320]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.902]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:23:32.982 --> 01:23:34.244]  These are all parasites.
[01:23:34.304 --> 01:23:35.405]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:36.446]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:41.091]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:44.474]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:23:44.574 --> 01:23:47.615]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:23:47.635 --> 01:23:48.655]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:50.596]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:51.676]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:23:51.956 --> 01:23:53.756]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:57.417]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:57.678 --> 01:23:59.558]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:23:59.938 --> 01:24:01.919]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:24:12.982 --> 01:24:14.162]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[01:24:15.862 --> 01:24:17.563]  Who exposed the whole Susan Rice thing.
[01:24:17.603 --> 01:24:18.183]  What a hero.
[01:24:20.104 --> 01:24:23.865]  Millie Weaver on the whole crisis going on with sex trafficking.
[01:24:23.905 --> 01:24:25.466]  She's out in California covering that.
[01:24:25.786 --> 01:24:27.227]  The Democrats, big connections to that.
[01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:31.008]  And if Ward wants it, he may have to go.
[01:24:31.028 --> 01:24:33.709]  If he can do five, six minutes to the next segment, I've got other questions for him.
[01:24:33.729 --> 01:24:34.670]  This is a short segment.
[01:24:35.652 --> 01:24:44.616]  But just looking at it, he fought the communist infiltration in England, defeated it with Margaret Thatcher, turned the economy around so people believed in capitalism again.
[01:24:44.956 --> 01:24:53.239]  Trump's fought in the same battle, but up against greater odds, except other countries now are waking up and fighting back.
[01:24:55.185 --> 01:25:00.111]  But it couldn't be more historical and ground-shaking and epic.
[01:25:00.531 --> 01:25:03.034]  I can't believe we're all alive right now to see this.
[01:25:03.074 --> 01:25:06.177]  I mean, this is the stuff of history for hundreds of years.
[01:25:06.698 --> 01:25:09.141]  A big future of humanity is being decided right now.
[01:25:09.161 --> 01:25:10.022]  I mean, I'm getting chills.
[01:25:11.212 --> 01:25:20.356]  And then they call me, let's go to Lord Monckton, they call me a Russian agent with no proof and say I'm being criminally investigated because I want sovereignty.
[01:25:20.776 --> 01:25:22.857]  And it fundamentally, I thought it wouldn't make me mad.
[01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:25.278]  I used to tell Roger Stone, settle down when they call you a Russian agent.
[01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:27.499]  And he'd be privately there going, no, I'm pissed.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.700]  And now I'm pissed.
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.621]  It's like insulting somebody's honor, Lord Monckton.
[01:25:32.079 --> 01:25:55.296]  Well, it is, and I think that one of the things that's happened is that the FBI, which was radicalized and politicized under Mr. Obama, defined a constitutional terrorist, and they used the word terrorist as anyone who speaks publicly in favor of the constitutional right of a citizen to own and control his own land.
[01:25:56.156 --> 01:25:58.438]  That is actually on the FBI website.
[01:25:58.458 --> 01:26:00.739]  I couldn't believe it when I was told this, but it is there.
[01:26:00.759 --> 01:26:02.461]  It was put there by Obama.
[01:26:02.821 --> 01:26:08.665]  And Mr. Comey, who presided over this, is, in my opinion, very untrustworthy.
[01:26:09.185 --> 01:26:12.968]  And it was he who presided over the shooting, for instance, of Lavoie Finnegan.
[01:26:13.008 --> 01:26:16.370]  I don't know whether you've come across that horrifying case in southern Oregon.
[01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.730]  Yes.
[01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:31.247]  Where Mr Finnickham, who was simply on the road going about his lawful business, ended up being shot in front of his family and friends, and killed, having offered no provocation of any kind to the authorities, and there was no justification for that shooting.
[01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:43.056]  And when I watched the Sheriff's Office trying to explain why they thought they could do this, they omitted to declare how many non-bullet rounds had been fired at him.
[01:26:43.176 --> 01:26:50.261]  One of them caused him to jerk and then he was shot at with a real bullet after that because they were pretending he was going for his gun.
[01:26:50.301 --> 01:26:50.621]  He wasn't.
[01:26:50.641 --> 01:26:53.864]  He was reacting to a wound he'd been given by one of these rubber bullets.
[01:26:54.594 --> 01:27:22.672]  Now, this is a very serious case, and it's very serious that people like Mr Finnicombe, whose widow I had the pleasure of meeting in California a few months ago, should be subjected to this monstrous, just murder by the FBI under Comey, because the FBI now gives itself the right to call the likes of you and me, Alex, terrorists, because we say that the Constitution gives certain rights to the people which it gives them.
[01:27:23.012 --> 01:27:24.253]  That doesn't make us terrorists.
[01:27:24.593 --> 01:27:28.917]  It makes us people who support the objectives of our founding fathers in the United States.
[01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:33.501]  That doesn't seem to me to be inherently, or in any way, a terrorist position to take.
[01:27:33.861 --> 01:27:42.709]  And if you look at Mr Finnicombe's entirely reasonable statements on YouTube, where you can see what he was saying about the Constitution and the various rights it gives to the citizen,
[01:27:43.209 --> 01:27:45.690]  There's nothing in any way terrorist about it.
[01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:47.430]  He doesn't advocate the use of violence.
[01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.971]  He doesn't use violence.
[01:27:49.331 --> 01:28:00.914]  And yet they felt that on the open road they could put up a roadblock just around the corner where he couldn't see it, drive him into a snowdrift and then shoot him.
[01:28:01.594 --> 01:28:04.276]  And this now needs to be inquired into.
[01:28:04.616 --> 01:28:10.220]  And I am working quietly to try to make sure that the Trump administration looks into this very closely.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.383]  Well, that's why you don't use special forces killers for local police operations.
[01:28:14.403 --> 01:28:15.104]  And that's what happens.
[01:28:15.144 --> 01:28:16.285]  That's why they shouldn't be using them.
[01:28:16.805 --> 01:28:22.529]  And that's why the Bureau of Land Management shouldn't have called in basically Delta Force people, just like Waco.
[01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:26.292]  I'm not against the Delta Force, but you don't use them against farmers and ranchers.
[01:28:26.332 --> 01:28:27.333]  And they shot the car up.
[01:28:27.373 --> 01:28:27.873]  He got out.
[01:28:27.893 --> 01:28:28.854]  They shot him with a rubber bullet.
[01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:33.233]  And they killed him, and they all admit that now, and it's another travesty.
[01:28:33.253 --> 01:28:36.677]  And meanwhile, the head IRS guy did all these horrible things.
[01:28:36.717 --> 01:28:38.599]  He's still there, and you mentioned it.
[01:28:38.739 --> 01:28:41.802]  I want to ask you when we come back with you a few more minutes, but start now.
[01:28:42.262 --> 01:28:47.768]  What do you do when bureaucrats are in open mutiny against the president, the people, common law?
[01:28:48.188 --> 01:28:49.029]  What does the president do?
[01:28:49.049 --> 01:28:51.011]  Because they're in mutiny everywhere and admitting it.
[01:28:51.812 --> 01:28:52.032]  Right.
[01:28:52.092 --> 01:28:55.055]  What you do is you stop funding them.
[01:28:55.656 --> 01:29:01.802]  The great power which is given to any democratically elected government is called the power of the purse.
[01:29:02.123 --> 01:29:04.505]  You can decide who to pay and who not to pay.
[01:29:04.986 --> 01:29:11.192]  And the President should go to Congress and say, these people, these government departments, are in open war against the elected government.
[01:29:11.472 --> 01:29:12.814]  Please defund them.
[01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:20.136]  And provided he makes a good case to Congress, he's got good support in both houses, then they can simply take away their money.
[01:29:20.516 --> 01:29:23.477]  That's the fastest way to bring them to heel.
[01:29:23.517 --> 01:29:27.179]  We're doing that at the moment in Britain, over this climate nonsense.
[01:29:27.839 --> 01:29:29.379]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[01:29:29.439 --> 01:29:33.901]  Let's come back and break all that down with Lord Monk in a few more minutes, with him straight ahead.
[01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:39.943]  And then, we've got a bunch of clips to play dealing with Susan Rice, and other breaking news with North Korea.
[01:29:40.023 --> 01:29:40.283]  And then,
[01:29:41.704 --> 01:29:42.966]  We have Mike Cernovich joining us.
[01:29:43.847 --> 01:29:50.615]  A profile in what's not fake news, what's cutting-edge investigative journalism that the MSM calls fake news because they are the fake news.
[01:29:51.055 --> 01:29:52.637]  They are the body snatchers of our liberty.
[01:29:52.657 --> 01:29:55.520]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.441 --> 01:29:59.125]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.100]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:10.122]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:30:10.242 --> 01:30:13.503]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:19.144]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:30:19.584 --> 01:30:25.286]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:28.167]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:30:28.407 --> 01:30:33.508]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:30:33.788 --> 01:30:40.471]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:30:40.771 --> 01:30:45.312]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:30:45.492 --> 01:30:48.653]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:30:48.794 --> 01:30:50.674]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:30:50.874 --> 01:30:56.197]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:30:56.477 --> 01:30:58.458]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:30:58.778 --> 01:31:00.459]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:31:02.904 --> 01:31:05.206]  Mainstream media threw a fit on Monday.
[01:31:05.446 --> 01:31:19.356]  Independent journalist Mike Cernovich outed Susan Rice, who was Obama's national security advisor, as the person who requested the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates' names in the months leading up to the election, all the way up until Trump's inauguration.
[01:31:19.496 --> 01:31:21.858]  This, of course, was turning out to be the biggest story of the day.
[01:31:22.038 --> 01:31:22.758]  So what happened?
[01:31:22.878 --> 01:31:24.900]  Later in the afternoon, we got the manufactured
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.204]  Blackwater found secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin backchannel.
[01:31:29.444 --> 01:31:35.810]  That's right, Trump-Putin backchannel could be found in thousands of articles, all released within two hours of each other.
[01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:43.497]  And they claim that Eric Prince of Blackwater was having secret meetings at an Indian Ocean island with Russia to set up a secret backchannel with Putin.
[01:31:45.962 --> 01:31:56.946]  The proof we do have are the NSA request logs with Susan Rice's name all over them, which is asking for the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates so she, Obama, and others could spy on them.
[01:31:57.606 --> 01:32:00.647]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:32:03.098 --> 01:32:04.798]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:32:05.379 --> 01:32:06.719]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:10.500]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:18.602]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[01:32:18.802 --> 01:32:23.603]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:32:23.763 --> 01:32:29.225]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:32:29.565 --> 01:32:37.110]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:41.792]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:32:42.073 --> 01:32:50.918]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:32:51.118 --> 01:32:54.340]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.307]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:58.547 --> 01:33:00.090]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:04.438 --> 01:33:14.485]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.565 --> 01:33:16.406]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:31.664 --> 01:33:40.373]  Our last guest, before Lord Monson joined us, talked about Google and others, admittedly, dialing back libertarian, nationalistic, patriot news by 90-95%.
[01:33:40.393 --> 01:33:44.757]  Just not letting people share our links.
[01:33:45.518 --> 01:33:45.978]  And I get it.
[01:33:45.998 --> 01:33:47.020]  Then leave those platforms.
[01:33:47.967 --> 01:33:52.791]  The point is they're doing it and admitting they're doing it to shut down the restoration of our republic and the will of the people.
[01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:58.115]  They're violating, you know, I really think their terms and services because they're discriminatory.
[01:33:58.756 --> 01:34:04.140]  This would not be allowed against other groups and there really should be antitrust movements, I believe, by the president's deal with this.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.102]  We'll ask Lord Monckton how he'd deal with this.
[01:34:06.142 --> 01:34:10.365]  I mean, I see Google, I see Microsoft, I see them all kind of showing their leg.
[01:34:11.306 --> 01:34:11.586]  We're good.
[01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:36.151]  Trump and America in line?
[01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:41.473]  It's like Obama going to the UK and saying, you're not going to leave the EU.
[01:34:42.253 --> 01:34:43.874]  Some say that's probably pushing it over the edge.
[01:34:43.894 --> 01:34:45.534]  People are like, what the hell is this?
[01:34:45.874 --> 01:34:47.135]  We'll talk to Lord Monk in just a moment.
[01:34:49.315 --> 01:34:54.558]  If you sign up for our free newsletter, because of the censorship, we can send you exclusive articles, videos, you name it.
[01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:58.061]  I never really even use it for marketing, but it is a way for us to send you big discounts.
[01:34:59.121 --> 01:35:01.543]  50% off on the original shirt I designed 20 years ago.
[01:35:01.903 --> 01:35:03.584]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[01:35:04.145 --> 01:35:06.746]  Peasants, politicians love disarmed peasants.
[01:35:07.147 --> 01:35:09.168]  Infowars.com, that's 50% off that shirt.
[01:35:10.609 --> 01:35:12.890]  We have 50% off the regular retail price, so it's $20.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:15.460]  We're good to go.
[01:35:32.797 --> 01:35:42.542]  We have not been able, in six months or so, to get with the oil companies, the gas drilling companies, and get a reasonably priced shipment of pure iodine crystals.
[01:35:42.642 --> 01:35:43.542]  Nobody else has this.
[01:35:43.962 --> 01:35:45.663]  We've trailblazed it.
[01:35:45.803 --> 01:35:46.924]  It's a huge situation.
[01:35:46.944 --> 01:35:47.804]  Some of it's political.
[01:35:48.465 --> 01:35:51.186]  It's our flagship product, Infowarslive.com.
[01:35:51.586 --> 01:35:53.207]  Now, it's regular price right now.
[01:35:53.227 --> 01:35:55.188]  If you want to support the broadcast, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:55.628 --> 01:36:01.271]  But if you sign up for the free newsletter, and hopefully you send these newsletters on to others to spread the word, part of the Infowar,
[01:36:02.205 --> 01:36:07.008]  Such an important tool, because no matter how much censorship there is, it's very hard for them to block email lists we have in the future.
[01:36:07.288 --> 01:36:10.550]  We're preparing for the worst while we hope for the best.
[01:36:11.611 --> 01:36:20.337]  It's critical for you to be on our free newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, because we'll send you the promo code to get it at 50% off retail.
[01:36:20.377 --> 01:36:25.200]  That's $20 or $19.95, and the t-shirt for half off as well.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.401]  So again, that's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:28.814 --> 01:36:36.765]  And that is how you fund this operation in this age of censorship and corporate censorship and the media getting together and going after independent media.
[01:36:36.805 --> 01:36:38.508]  There's a war on free speech.
[01:36:38.548 --> 01:36:42.834]  Let me ask you that, Lord Moncton, and then get into some solutions and other points on the climate change battle.
[01:36:44.602 --> 01:36:45.823]  Surely, I mean, I know you followed it.
[01:36:45.904 --> 01:36:47.185]  Massive censorship in Europe.
[01:36:47.205 --> 01:36:48.807]  Can't even criticize Islam, you get arrested.
[01:36:49.267 --> 01:36:51.029]  They're trying to push it in the UK.
[01:36:51.429 --> 01:36:53.912]  They're really pushing it here, obviously out of their weakness.
[01:36:54.593 --> 01:36:58.537]  Your comments on censorship increasing, don't they risk it backfiring?
[01:36:58.577 --> 01:37:01.199]  Normally it does, unless they succeed in total censorship.
[01:37:01.219 --> 01:37:02.881]  So, isn't this a true death battle?
[01:37:04.203 --> 01:37:05.104]  It is a death battle.
[01:37:05.124 --> 01:37:07.246]  There's no doubt this is a death battle between
[01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:12.379]  Freedom, on the one hand, and the totalitarians on the other.
[01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:19.906]  If you look at the big totalitarian movements, communism, fascism, global leftism of various kinds... Google-ism?
[01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:21.708]  Islam, of course, is totalitarian.
[01:37:21.968 --> 01:37:27.853]  They are all getting together now and saying that only one point of view, and that's their point of view, is allowed.
[01:37:27.873 --> 01:37:30.416]  Of course, environmentalism is another example of this.
[01:37:31.096 --> 01:37:37.424]  And what they're trying to do is to say that there is only one so-called politically so-called correct point of view.
[01:37:37.444 --> 01:37:41.610]  And that if you don't reflect that point of view, Google will not give you airtime.
[01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:46.396]  If you do reflect that point of view, they'll give you airtime even if you advocate murder.
[01:37:46.957 --> 01:37:48.559]  Is it that Soviet level?
[01:37:49.537 --> 01:37:49.937]  Well, it is.
[01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:58.843]  I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger has a YouTube video at the moment which advocates murder of people who don't agree with his expert opinion on the climate.
[01:37:59.444 --> 01:38:04.107]  And several people have written to YouTube saying this must be taken down.
[01:38:04.447 --> 01:38:05.568]  And it's been there for a year.
[01:38:05.628 --> 01:38:06.729]  They won't take it down.
[01:38:06.789 --> 01:38:07.809]  I wonder how he'd like it.
[01:38:07.869 --> 01:38:09.571]  I'm not threatening him, but what have I advocated?
[01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:13.515]  I guarantee you, if I told my listeners, kill Schwarzenegger, people would try, they'd probably succeed.
[01:38:13.896 --> 01:38:14.196]  Okay?
[01:38:14.276 --> 01:38:15.158]  I mean, that's power.
[01:38:15.198 --> 01:38:16.019]  Please don't do that.
[01:38:16.039 --> 01:38:16.760]  That's responsibility.
[01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:19.523]  The point is this, you wouldn't do that.
[01:38:19.583 --> 01:38:19.784]  Wouldn't?
[01:38:19.844 --> 01:38:21.366]  He gets away with doing that.
[01:38:21.546 --> 01:38:26.833]  If you were to try to do that, you'd have police bursting in through every corner of your building in five minutes flat.
[01:38:27.313 --> 01:38:31.318]  And Mr. Comey would be there, and he'd be calling you a constitutional terrorist and shooting you first.
[01:38:31.398 --> 01:38:31.898]  Exactly.
[01:38:31.918 --> 01:38:32.999]  So why are they allowed?
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.926]  And how do Schwarzenegger and these other bullies expect that if they ever succeed in a shooting war, don't they understand what's going to happen to them?
[01:38:38.986 --> 01:38:40.408]  They've taken our restraint as weakness.
[01:38:41.536 --> 01:38:43.999]  Well, I'm afraid this is exactly what's happened.
[01:38:44.239 --> 01:38:46.261]  However, we are fighting back.
[01:38:46.301 --> 01:38:49.724]  I mean, Google tried to stifle one of my videos once.
[01:38:49.785 --> 01:38:51.146]  It had gone to three million hits.
[01:38:51.646 --> 01:38:56.331]  And then they made sure that the hit count no longer went to my pages.
[01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:59.775]  They set up a dozen bogus pages and diverted all the hits away.
[01:38:59.795 --> 01:39:00.295]  I remember.
[01:39:00.315 --> 01:39:01.617]  And this happened several years ago.
[01:39:02.517 --> 01:39:06.180]  But by then, three million people had seen my video, so it didn't make too much difference.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.502]  But they are always trying to do this.
[01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:15.428]  On the hard, dictatorial, environmental, communist, fascist, left, call it what you will, Islamist, they're all the same.
[01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:21.713]  They all think that only one very narrow, very vicious point of view, their own, should be allowed to prevail.
[01:39:21.733 --> 01:39:25.176]  And they're all battling for who gets control finally to implement their censorship.
[01:39:25.396 --> 01:39:26.637]  It's why they're always allied.
[01:39:27.611 --> 01:39:46.907]  However, they're going to lose, because you exist, and gradually, independent networks are being set up on the internet, which are proof against even governments trying to interfere, and certainly the likes of Google, who've now lost a billion dollars a year in revenue, as companies begin to realise that Google is prejudiced.
[01:39:47.327 --> 01:39:53.673]  And that they could find their advertisements jostling with these various extremists demanding that people should be killed.
[01:39:53.993 --> 01:40:05.163]  You know, for as long as that video of Schwarzenegger saying that he wants to see people who are climate sceptics connected to the tailpipe of a car, he doesn't seem to realise that that's carbon monoxide and not dioxide that they've been breathing in.
[01:40:06.323 --> 01:40:16.086]  But if they leave that kind of video on YouTube, then just about everybody who now advertises on Google is going to pull their advertisements away.
[01:40:16.567 --> 01:40:18.247]  And that's the correct course of action.
[01:40:18.287 --> 01:40:23.269]  If you have a company and you're using Google to advertise your products, stop doing it!
[01:40:23.349 --> 01:40:23.989]  And let's be clear!
[01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:26.910]  The left is trying to bully Google for more censorship.
[01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:28.431]  We should do it to them.
[01:40:28.511 --> 01:40:29.451]  I mean, look at Schwarzenegger.
[01:40:29.551 --> 01:40:30.712]  What a pathetic joke.
[01:40:31.052 --> 01:40:32.252]  Just like his Nazi father.
[01:40:32.272 --> 01:40:33.493]  And, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:40:33.573 --> 01:40:36.394]  Why are there all these weird... I mean, he admits he admired Hitler.
[01:40:36.414 --> 01:40:37.334]  He told Rolling Stone that.
[01:40:37.794 --> 01:40:40.675]  Why can't we get, like, George Soros, the Nazi collaborator?
[01:40:40.716 --> 01:40:41.276]  Or Juncker?
[01:40:41.716 --> 01:40:42.476]  Or Schwarzenegger?
[01:40:42.496 --> 01:40:44.177]  It's like, what is up with these Nazis?
[01:40:45.461 --> 01:40:48.263]  Well, they're allowed to have their point of view.
[01:40:48.343 --> 01:40:59.310]  What they're not allowed to do, and in Britain, if he tried to do that here, he would be arrested, is you're not allowed to advocate killing people who happen to disagree with your point of view.
[01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:00.331]  You can't call for action.
[01:41:00.531 --> 01:41:02.693]  I don't know whether that is allowed in America.
[01:41:02.913 --> 01:41:05.975]  If it isn't allowed in America, then somebody ought to prosecute him.
[01:41:06.215 --> 01:41:07.176]  That's the simplest way to do it.
[01:41:07.196 --> 01:41:11.959]  When you call for a group of people to be killed, you're trying to organize terrorism.
[01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:15.281]  It's the definition of terrorism to say, kill people you don't agree with.
[01:41:16.241 --> 01:41:16.682]  That's right.
[01:41:16.742 --> 01:41:20.844]  And those people, you can prosecute them and you should prosecute them.
[01:41:20.884 --> 01:41:26.186]  You should stop them getting away with saying that they can go around killing people.
[01:41:26.486 --> 01:41:32.429]  And that's one of the things we're going to be talking about at redpillexpo.org on the 23rd and 24th of June.
[01:41:32.469 --> 01:41:35.350]  I want everyone from Alex Jones to be there.
[01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:36.851]  I want all of you to be there.
[01:41:36.871 --> 01:41:37.471]  Come and meet us.
[01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.932]  Come and talk about these big issues.
[01:41:39.272 --> 01:41:43.234]  I've got a major announcement on the climate to make, which we'll be making out
[01:41:43.314 --> 01:41:44.615]  Well, I should definitely send my crew.
[01:41:44.635 --> 01:41:45.196]  How about this?
[01:41:45.276 --> 01:41:47.238]  I will send some crew to that Lord Monckton.
[01:41:47.318 --> 01:41:50.941]  In your gut, in your gut, how do you think Trump's doing?
[01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:55.765]  I think he overall is delivering royally, but the problem is I don't think he's too confident almost.
[01:41:55.805 --> 01:42:02.771]  He needs to understand that he should have as Attorney General going after people that are committing crimes, threatening to kill him, kill his family, kill me.
[01:42:03.152 --> 01:42:10.258]  I mean, I don't like just sitting here watching people threatening to kill everybody and getting violent, and then we're not doing anything back, at least legally.
[01:42:11.368 --> 01:42:14.549]  Well, the important thing is to use the power that you do have.
[01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:25.912]  I don't know the US law well enough to know whether they are allowed under the First Amendment to go around advocating killing people, but in Britain that comes under the terrorist legislation and we can stop people doing that.
[01:42:26.012 --> 01:42:34.455]  One of the things I'm looking at at the moment is getting that Schwarzenegger video pulled off Google because it offends against the UK terrorist laws.
[01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:38.636]  We do have laws against terrorists and in advocating the killing of people
[01:42:41.408 --> 01:42:44.959]  Well it's funny that he's a Nazi saying he wants to gas people, Lord Monckton's.
[01:42:46.243 --> 01:42:47.366]  Sorry, your Skype broke up.
[01:42:47.387 --> 01:42:48.671]  Go ahead, when it comes back you can finish up.
[01:42:54.067 --> 01:43:08.965]  Well, I just find it ironic that his dad was an SS officer and they had mobile gassing vans and it's just funny to have a son of a famous Nazi saying he wants to gas the skeptics.
[01:43:09.506 --> 01:43:12.650]  I mean, do you think the irony was lost on him?
[01:43:15.038 --> 01:43:18.299]  I don't think he's clever enough to understand what the irony is.
[01:43:18.779 --> 01:43:22.279]  I think he's just full of hate, as so many of these leftists are.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.420]  He claimed to be a Republican, but he wasn't really.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.080]  Absolutely.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.821]  And these people are full of hatred for any point of view that is not their own.
[01:43:30.181 --> 01:43:31.521]  And that's what we have to deal with.
[01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:42.243]  We have to be very clear that if these people are going to fundamentally abuse the right of free speech by calling on people to be killed because they disagree with them,
[01:43:42.743 --> 01:43:46.046]  Then, those people should be locked up as terrorists.
[01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:49.168]  They should not be allowed to make those kind of noises.
[01:43:49.268 --> 01:43:49.748]  Absolutely.
[01:43:49.808 --> 01:43:54.412]  I just know if somebody blows Schwarzenegger away, he's calling for violence.
[01:43:54.432 --> 01:43:56.733]  I hope nobody kills him, but he's the one calling for it.
[01:43:56.793 --> 01:43:58.474]  So, you know, we're in a new age here, bro.
[01:43:58.815 --> 01:43:59.615]  It's not in movies.
[01:43:59.635 --> 01:44:00.276]  We're a tough guy.
[01:44:00.296 --> 01:44:01.537]  These are real bullets, Jack.
[01:44:01.937 --> 01:44:04.419]  Hey, I want to thank you, Lord Moggen, for joining us.
[01:44:04.439 --> 01:44:05.780]  We really appreciate your fine work, sir.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:06.880]  Great pleasure.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.301]  It really has, as always, Alex.
[01:44:08.341 --> 01:44:09.642]  Let's keep in regular touch.
[01:44:09.882 --> 01:44:16.446]  And I want you to make the effort to come to Bozeman on the 23rd and 24th of June for that Red Pill Expo, redpillexpo.org.
[01:44:16.806 --> 01:44:18.448]  I've been plugging it heavily on this program.
[01:44:18.468 --> 01:44:19.348]  It looks like a huge event.
[01:44:19.408 --> 01:44:19.828]  I want to go.
[01:44:19.908 --> 01:44:20.929]  I love that area of the mountain.
[01:44:20.949 --> 01:44:25.832]  It's exactly the kind of people who will be going to that who are Alex Jones fans.
[01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:35.538]  These are people who believe in liberty and who are now gathering together to work out how we make sure that we get that liberty back and don't allow the left to take it away
[01:44:35.738 --> 01:44:36.379]  No, I hear you.
[01:44:36.399 --> 01:44:37.139]  I love Bozeman.
[01:44:37.419 --> 01:44:40.721]  We'll, we'll, we'll... Well, you know what?
[01:44:40.781 --> 01:44:43.263]  I may go, because I've never met some of the folks that will be there.
[01:44:43.283 --> 01:44:43.963]  I know it's a big event.
[01:44:43.983 --> 01:44:44.524]  Thank you so much.
[01:44:45.407 --> 01:44:45.927]  Fantastic.
[01:44:45.947 --> 01:44:48.009]  God bless you, Alex, and lovely to talk, as always.
[01:44:48.129 --> 01:44:48.429]  Thank you.
[01:44:48.830 --> 01:45:02.240]  Yeah, Schwarzenegger has made a lot of comments about killing people he disagrees with, and I get that he can squat a lot of weight and lift weights, take a lot of steroids, and I get that, you know, he's with his little Hollywood darling and he was in gay porn.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:04.762]  That's how he made his money, was in gay porn.
[01:45:04.782 --> 01:45:08.144]  And that's fine with me that, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.
[01:45:41.006 --> 01:45:44.632]  Another stolen country with another know-it-all authoritarian in my face.
[01:45:45.013 --> 01:45:45.975]  I'm an American, buddy.
[01:45:46.896 --> 01:45:47.658]  And I want freedom.
[01:45:48.059 --> 01:45:48.620]  I want it now.
[01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:50.563]  And I want everybody out of my way.
[01:45:51.704 --> 01:45:56.228]  And I love good Germans, like the great German-American Donald Trump.
[01:45:56.748 --> 01:45:57.929]  You are a fraud.
[01:45:58.249 --> 01:45:58.850]  You're a joke.
[01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.570]  You're a bully.
[01:45:59.850 --> 01:46:00.591]  You're a scumbag.
[01:46:01.292 --> 01:46:04.694]  And you can hardly walk, and you're an absolute disgrace.
[01:46:05.135 --> 01:46:05.815]  Tell me how you want them.
[01:46:06.015 --> 01:46:09.338]  I'd like to hook them up to the gas and kill them!
[01:46:09.658 --> 01:46:11.079]  I'm going to kill you!
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.540]  I'm going to gas you!
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.242]  I'm sorry.
[01:46:22.842 --> 01:46:24.022]  See, we do real things.
[01:46:24.623 --> 01:46:28.884]  We're not on movies and video games where we act confident.
[01:46:29.024 --> 01:46:35.386]  I'm so sick of men that just act confident all day and, you know, just strut around, are all powerful, and it's all peacocking.
[01:46:35.746 --> 01:46:36.907]  We do real things here.
[01:46:36.927 --> 01:46:38.767]  See, we're affecting the real world.
[01:46:39.308 --> 01:46:45.130]  We have the globalists, and I'm not bragging because it's dangerous, running in terror right now with things we're doing behind the scenes.
[01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:49.251]  Because for everything you see on the surface of InfoWars,
[01:46:51.596 --> 01:46:53.897]  There's much more beneath the surface, but it's all reflected.
[01:46:53.937 --> 01:46:57.938]  It's what you see on the surface is much bigger under the water.
[01:46:58.978 --> 01:47:02.219]  But see, we don't show our whole hand, do we?
[01:47:03.159 --> 01:47:10.122]  We let all the big mouths run their mouths so we can lure them in, lure them in, lure them in.
[01:47:10.162 --> 01:47:13.242]  Just come back, just sucking back into that hole.
[01:47:13.342 --> 01:47:14.283]  Yeah, give me that arm.
[01:47:15.023 --> 01:47:18.004]  Because once we get you by the arm,
[01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:21.071]  And I think we've almost got you by it right now.
[01:47:22.212 --> 01:47:23.012]  We're never going to let go.
[01:47:25.053 --> 01:47:27.274]  And that's something you already know deep down, cowards.
[01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:29.836]  You're afraid of dying.
[01:47:29.856 --> 01:47:31.037]  Your status.
[01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.617]  A lot of us want to die.
[01:47:34.679 --> 01:47:35.139]  Killing you.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.020]  Politically.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.182]  And we're going to kill you politically.
[01:47:41.482 --> 01:47:44.364]  So you keep running your fat mouth and you watch what happens.
[01:47:46.107 --> 01:47:50.673]  You see what happens, because I can tell you, metaphysically, the gloves are coming off.
[01:47:52.895 --> 01:47:53.716]  And the enemy knows it.
[01:47:54.337 --> 01:47:56.279]  So I'm glad you've all shown us who you are.
[01:47:56.379 --> 01:47:56.700]  Good.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.864]  You are going to litter the field when we're done with you.
[01:48:00.244 --> 01:48:04.109]  You're going to litter the field with all your garbage.
[01:48:06.127 --> 01:48:09.490]  Got a bunch of clips I want to play here and I've got a bunch more guests coming up.
[01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:10.631]  Mike Cernovich coming on.
[01:48:10.691 --> 01:48:12.192]  Wow, I am so excited.
[01:48:12.892 --> 01:48:17.136]  Right after a week and a half ago, they say he's fake news and then give examples that are like totally real.
[01:48:18.417 --> 01:48:21.019]  Mike Cernovich says, Hillary has medical problems and fell down.
[01:48:21.339 --> 01:48:23.180]  Did you see her fall down on that video?
[01:48:23.981 --> 01:48:25.882]  Then they edit it where he goes, yeah, you didn't show the full video.
[01:48:25.902 --> 01:48:27.203]  And they just cut to Cernovich.
[01:48:28.284 --> 01:48:29.905]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:48:30.306 --> 01:48:31.947]  And then he's the guy that gets the leak.
[01:48:32.728 --> 01:48:34.389]  Hey, look, I'm not in competition.
[01:48:34.429 --> 01:48:35.630]  I love seeing somebody else take the heat.
[01:48:36.952 --> 01:48:39.199]  Send us leaks at ShowTipsInfoWars.com.
[01:48:39.219 --> 01:48:44.175]  If you work for MSM, if you're in these things, by the way, this latest thing on...
[01:48:48.408 --> 01:48:50.309]  MSNBC, we have moles in MSNBC.
[01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:51.830]  I have moles in MSNBC.
[01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:55.872]  I just am so busy I don't have time to pet them and thank them and then what do you do?
[01:48:55.892 --> 01:49:04.576]  I guess we don't get more mole stuff because it's like it's always about me or memos behind the scenes destroy me or you know and it's like, eh, why is that news?
[01:49:05.036 --> 01:49:14.401]  Oh, you know, six months before, they believe Hillary's gonna win, they've got a show where you're attacking the female president coming out on Homeland and this is the name of the character and it's also the name of James O'Keefe and six months later?
[01:49:15.489 --> 01:49:23.694]  There it is, and it's kind of like, okay, uh, but I go in there and say, I have the whistleblower, here's the script, to Homeland, and it's all about me.
[01:49:23.734 --> 01:49:27.296]  I'm just like, we have the script, and it'll be coming out in a few months, and then it does.
[01:49:27.336 --> 01:49:31.838]  You know, it's kind of like, I'm so busy, because, you know, there's just some show attacking me, it's not that important.
[01:49:32.078 --> 01:49:37.001]  We'll show a clip or two, you know, we only covered a few of the episodes, and we don't even respond now, we don't even watch.
[01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:39.862]  It's like, all these TV shows attacking me, lying.
[01:49:39.882 --> 01:49:42.844]  At a certain point, it's like, I'm cannon fodder.
[01:49:43.785 --> 01:49:44.465]  And I realize that.
[01:49:46.752 --> 01:49:50.773]  It's the big things that matter, and we are devastating these people.
[01:49:52.154 --> 01:49:57.616]  We are devastating them, but I should glorify whistleblowers more.
[01:49:57.636 --> 01:50:01.677]  I'm glad Assange isn't getting deported with the election they just saw in Paraguay.
[01:50:01.997 --> 01:50:03.157]  He's good for a while again.
[01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:08.313]  Embassy in London, who's been held up for four or five years.
[01:50:09.214 --> 01:50:11.536]  But this is an epic battle and I'm just pleased to be part of it.
[01:50:11.556 --> 01:50:15.820]  I want to thank the great crew that makes it all possible, you the listeners, our affiliates, the sponsors we have.
[01:50:16.861 --> 01:50:20.384]  But as listeners, you've got to realize this is the big battle.
[01:50:22.286 --> 01:50:23.246]  This is the big fight.
[01:50:24.888 --> 01:50:26.850]  And we've never burned a whistleblower.
[01:50:28.735 --> 01:50:29.636]  I'm very proud of that fact.
[01:50:30.397 --> 01:50:34.661]  In fact, I always delete their emails and information just in case we ever got hacked.
[01:50:34.701 --> 01:50:35.281]  It's not there.
[01:50:36.202 --> 01:50:38.204]  And so I'm glad folks gave Cernovich this info.
[01:50:38.484 --> 01:50:40.466]  Notice the media's not giving him any credit where it came from.
[01:50:40.486 --> 01:50:42.608]  Because they're, oh, the fake news has it.
[01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:44.590]  They're the fake news.
[01:50:45.111 --> 01:50:49.595]  But just spread the link, spread the articles, and all of us in the new media, the true media,
[01:50:51.107 --> 01:50:57.871]  We have to celebrate other people, whether it's Drudge or James O'Keefe or Mike Cernovich, anybody, because we're all in this together.
[01:50:57.911 --> 01:51:00.092]  This is all part of our wealth together.
[01:51:00.332 --> 01:51:01.253]  We're not in competition.
[01:51:03.004 --> 01:51:04.585]  Sick and tired of being sick and tired?

[01:52:07.536 --> 01:52:12.940]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:18.164]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[01:52:18.444 --> 01:52:20.145]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:52:20.405 --> 01:52:22.487]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[01:52:22.787 --> 01:52:23.468]  See guidelines.
[01:52:23.728 --> 01:52:26.830]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:28.732]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:52:28.972 --> 01:52:30.793]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:52:32.105 --> 01:52:33.346]  It's called the Deep State.
[01:52:33.426 --> 01:52:38.051]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[01:52:38.191 --> 01:52:42.155]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[01:52:42.276 --> 01:52:47.701]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[01:52:47.901 --> 01:52:53.387]  Newsmax, Lou Dobbs, Ann Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere.
[01:52:53.387 --> 01:52:53.667]  We're good.

[01:54:10.097 --> 01:54:11.098]  Again, X2.
[01:54:11.118 --> 01:54:11.959]  We've had it four years.
[01:54:12.039 --> 01:54:13.862]  It's our top-selling product overall.
[01:54:13.922 --> 01:54:14.562]  It's amazing.
[01:54:14.883 --> 01:54:17.085]  Deep iodine, earth crystals, amazing.
[01:54:17.666 --> 01:54:20.269]  The good halogen in the body, the globulus hits with all the bad halogens.
[01:54:20.329 --> 01:54:20.970]  It blocks them.
[01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:21.731]  It moves them out.
[01:54:22.231 --> 01:54:24.154]  It's changed my life, changed so many others' lives.
[01:54:25.894 --> 01:54:27.375]  I can't believe we may have run out of it.
[01:54:27.855 --> 01:54:31.436]  It was losing one source of iodine that brought us to this iodine that nobody else had.
[01:54:32.256 --> 01:54:35.417]  We'll probably find another source from deep earth drilling.
[01:54:36.377 --> 01:54:39.678]  But it's 20% off normally.
[01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:41.399]  We discounted it even more.
[01:54:41.699 --> 01:54:42.559]  It's about to sell out.
[01:54:42.619 --> 01:54:44.980]  So now we've done 50% off normal retail.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.901]  When you sign up for the free newsletter, we'll send you the code today at 4 o'clock central.
[01:54:49.241 --> 01:54:50.102]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:51.022 --> 01:54:51.703]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.952 --> 01:55:11.975]  That law enforcement is ready to talk to with all the pedophilia arrests and things that MSM won't cover.
[01:55:12.395 --> 01:55:14.336]  But the police want to make sure it's all done properly.
[01:55:14.797 --> 01:55:18.138]  And they've, I'm very honored, they've chosen InfoWars to be part of this.
[01:55:18.199 --> 01:55:20.500]  But it has to be outside of government, it has to be funded by us.
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:26.803]  It can't be obviously connected to the White House because the White House isn't involved.
[01:55:27.064 --> 01:55:29.705]  And people want us to take the globalist on, we're doing it.
[01:55:29.925 --> 01:55:30.926]  I mean we're doing stuff where
[01:55:33.953 --> 01:55:38.216]  Well, we've got top Navy SEAL federal officer currently coming on.
[01:55:38.997 --> 01:55:39.617]  He got called.
[01:55:39.657 --> 01:55:41.238]  They said, yeah, you're hit in the chatter.
[01:55:41.298 --> 01:55:45.761]  The Democrats are actually self-identifying in the DNC as pedophiles.
[01:55:46.021 --> 01:55:49.504]  And we've got them live chatter how they're going to try to come after you and Jones.
[01:55:49.564 --> 01:55:54.207]  And he says, man, I've taken out terrorist leaders, you name it, and not had seen this type of stuff.
[01:55:54.668 --> 01:55:56.189]  I mean, they are flipping out.
[01:55:56.889 --> 01:55:58.752]  By the way, I've got a lot of other sources as well.
[01:55:59.333 --> 01:56:02.998]  I'm going to just leave it at that, but there is a war going on in this country right now and it's amazing.
[01:56:03.458 --> 01:56:06.062]  So the Saw Man, Craig Sawyer is going to be on.
[01:56:06.082 --> 01:56:08.886]  I'm going to do 30 minutes into the fourth hour today and then David Knight.
[01:56:10.407 --> 01:56:18.691]  It just feels so good to know he's there, and to know people like Mike Cernovich are there, and Paul Watson, and Matt Drudge, and just all these other great people that are fighting for freedom.
[01:56:19.191 --> 01:56:28.676]  Because it's just, it's scary when you're one of the only prominent people, and I'm seeing more and more prominent people, and folks coming out of the shadows that keep saying, where are all these supermen?
[01:56:28.956 --> 01:56:30.557]  All these super great soldiers and patriots?
[01:56:30.857 --> 01:56:32.318]  I can't do all this, man, I'm not...
[01:56:33.092 --> 01:56:33.973]  I'm not that strong.
[01:56:34.213 --> 01:56:36.896]  We're going to lose this thing if you don't activate and take action.
[01:56:36.916 --> 01:56:37.677]  And they're like doing it.
[01:56:37.697 --> 01:56:39.299]  I'm like, wow, this is amazing.
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:44.145]  The globalists, if they had any idea what's going on behind the scenes, I think they do.
[01:56:44.465 --> 01:56:45.126]  I think they do.
[01:56:46.487 --> 01:56:49.951]  But I have no fear because I know we're doing the right thing.
[01:56:52.475 --> 01:56:59.800]  I have a conscience, and when I even think about doing bad things, just to warmth in my mind, I feel the presence of God being removed, and that's horrible.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:04.703]  That's God-fearing, means to me, God leaving your presence.
[01:57:06.265 --> 01:57:14.670]  And when I do the right thing, and I'm fearless in this, God gets stronger and stronger, and it's like, I'm just high all the time, and have discernment, and like, it's like, wow!
[01:57:15.111 --> 01:57:19.594]  People don't know this is what it's like to be a righteous person, and that doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I have good will.
[01:57:21.121 --> 01:57:22.041]  And I want to stand against evil.
[01:57:22.061 --> 01:57:27.742]  We're going to come back and play Susan Reitz's babbling BS on PBS last night.
[01:57:27.762 --> 01:57:32.143]  Looks like she's drugged up or something on a bunch of Valium.
[01:57:32.483 --> 01:57:35.064]  And then we've got the admissions that know she was spying.
[01:57:35.104 --> 01:57:36.064]  Even Bloomberg admits it.
[01:57:36.364 --> 01:57:37.164]  Of course they were!
[01:57:37.464 --> 01:57:39.865]  They admitted two months ago they were in the newspapers!
[01:57:41.005 --> 01:57:46.906]  Again, that's why I said this is their Waterloo, because they just keep lying.
[01:57:48.146 --> 01:57:49.407]  On things that are verifiable.
[01:57:49.747 --> 01:57:59.892]  And they think if enough Cuomos, or enough Coopers, or enough Maddows, if enough of these men get up on TV and sit there and lie, that we're going to believe it.
[01:58:00.172 --> 01:58:04.534]  You may have zombies where Cuomo says, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, only we are.
[01:58:05.034 --> 01:58:08.436]  Ignore all this new news, this fake controversy about Susan Rice.
[01:58:09.417 --> 01:58:10.377]  He instructs them!
[01:58:10.657 --> 01:58:14.478]  Imagine if I was telling you, like, ignore this, and you can't look at this.
[01:58:14.979 --> 01:58:16.019]  I look at this, okay?
[01:58:16.399 --> 01:58:17.179]  You go through me.
[01:58:17.199 --> 01:58:18.140]  Is that clear?
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.661]  I just feel humanity beginning to come back.
[01:58:23.881 --> 01:58:28.863]  And I call on everyone, peacefully in the info war, to spread the word, and to do whatever you can.
[01:58:28.923 --> 01:58:34.684]  If you work inside MSM, tape them, record them, get it out, expose what they're doing.
[01:58:35.685 --> 01:58:36.465]  They want a war?
[01:58:37.657 --> 01:58:38.739]  They've got one, don't they?
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:41.224]  And we're in the middle of it, and we're winning!
[01:58:41.564 --> 01:58:42.827]  They're trying to demoralize us?
[01:58:42.927 --> 01:58:43.829]  Good luck, scum!
[01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:45.191]  We'll never quit!
[01:58:45.392 --> 01:58:46.934]  And we're winning, by the way, jackass!
[01:58:53.172 --> 01:58:58.456]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:58.616 --> 01:59:00.517]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:59:00.718 --> 01:59:05.761]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:59:06.021 --> 01:59:09.764]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:59:09.864 --> 01:59:13.047]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:59:13.307 --> 01:59:16.390]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:20.154]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:59:20.374 --> 01:59:27.441]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:59:27.541 --> 01:59:32.926]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:59:33.086 --> 01:59:34.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.919 --> 02:00:08.659]  Life isn't safe.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.980]  None of us get out of it alive.
[02:00:12.841 --> 02:00:13.621]  The greatest danger.
[02:00:14.861 --> 02:00:19.863]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:20.383 --> 02:00:23.184]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.024 --> 02:00:29.686]  I was thinking this morning about tweeting that out, but I didn't do it.
[02:00:31.932 --> 02:00:32.732]  Life isn't safe.
[02:00:33.572 --> 02:00:41.355]  Anybody that says they've got systems to keep you safe and makes it only about being safe and not taking risks or not standing up for what you believe in is an enemy.
[02:00:42.675 --> 02:00:44.075]  Is unconscious at the bare minimum.
[02:00:44.875 --> 02:00:46.036]  No, here's the quote for Twitter.
[02:00:46.636 --> 02:00:47.716]  Life isn't safe.
[02:00:48.636 --> 02:00:53.958]  But the most dangerous thing in the universe is doing nothing.
[02:00:54.558 --> 02:01:01.540]  The most dangerous thing in the world is trying to stay safe.
[02:01:02.799 --> 02:01:03.559]  Life isn't safe.
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:10.402]  The most dangerous thing in the universe is believing there is no risk.
[02:01:12.103 --> 02:01:14.143]  And people then just live paralyzed.
[02:01:16.244 --> 02:01:19.966]  Susan Rice, if you just tuned in, obviously yesterday, Mike Cernovich, joining us in the next segment.
[02:01:21.046 --> 02:01:21.686]  Whistleblowers.
[02:01:22.967 --> 02:01:25.448]  Clearly it's Bloomberg, 45 minutes to an hour after he posted.
[02:01:25.508 --> 02:01:28.049]  It's the exact story he put out, it's what they put out there.
[02:01:28.089 --> 02:01:29.349]  Oh, okay, it's true, Susan Rice.
[02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:31.190]  Oh, you know, it's true, here it is.
[02:01:32.898 --> 02:01:35.801]  Top Obama advisors sought names of Trump associates in Intel.
[02:01:36.022 --> 02:01:38.424]  They already admit they unmasked the names.
[02:01:38.785 --> 02:01:41.868]  They just keep playing games like they're not going to release the info.
[02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:43.250]  And here it is.
[02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:44.011]  Mike Cernovich.
[02:01:44.471 --> 02:01:46.994]  Can we queue up that 60 minutes in the next segment to introduce him?
[02:01:47.695 --> 02:01:49.537]  Where they have that reporter, whatever his name is.
[02:01:49.577 --> 02:01:50.598]  Notice we don't even know their names now.
[02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:52.850]  Oh, we can play it now.
[02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:54.971]  The guy's such a stuffed... What's his name?
[02:01:55.392 --> 02:01:55.992]  Scott Kelly.
[02:01:56.712 --> 02:01:57.353]  Scott Pele.
[02:01:57.433 --> 02:01:57.653]  Okay.
[02:01:57.993 --> 02:02:01.374]  He sits there and he acts like he is such a stuffed shirt.
[02:02:01.434 --> 02:02:02.555]  He's so arrogant.
[02:02:02.935 --> 02:02:03.756]  He's God.
[02:02:03.856 --> 02:02:04.916]  He's unstoppable.
[02:02:05.676 --> 02:02:09.838]  And just how dare you sit here and put all this garbage out?
[02:02:10.579 --> 02:02:14.501]  And if somebody watches that who's in a trance, they believe Scott Pele.
[02:02:16.202 --> 02:02:18.583]  But if you're already awake, you know what a joke it is.
[02:02:19.659 --> 02:02:22.361]  And that Cernovich is obviously being edited, which they did.
[02:02:25.904 --> 02:02:27.646]  So, they asked him about it.
[02:02:27.686 --> 02:02:29.907]  They only show the clip up to where she's about to fall over.
[02:02:30.728 --> 02:02:32.389]  Then he says, oh, see, that's fake news.
[02:02:34.491 --> 02:02:35.812]  And then they cut to something completely different.
[02:02:35.832 --> 02:02:38.074]  He said about something completely separate.
[02:02:38.334 --> 02:02:43.999]  But it doesn't matter because in the interview, he kept his answers so short, they didn't have anything to really edit together.
[02:02:44.019 --> 02:02:46.301]  I mean, that's how pathetic these people are.
[02:02:48.148 --> 02:02:53.097]  A Trump supporter labeled fake news by 60 Minutes beats everyone to Susan Rice soup.
[02:02:56.766 --> 02:03:00.048]  I remember about a year ago, Paul Watts was like, I like this Cernovich guy, you gotta start paying attention to him.
[02:03:00.068 --> 02:03:04.051]  So I started paying attention to him, and it was only a few months ago we got him on, but that is so exciting.
[02:03:04.791 --> 02:03:09.975]  And notice, I can just tell, Cernovich is just in there, he's kicking their ass with the truth, so they're attacking him.
[02:03:10.035 --> 02:03:11.636]  That's what happens when you're doing the right thing.
[02:03:11.936 --> 02:03:19.401]  Here's Scott Paley, the lord of arrogance and acting like he's in charge, because he doesn't have the facts, he just has...
[02:03:27.486 --> 02:03:27.927]  Here it is.
[02:03:28.607 --> 02:03:32.450]  She had a seizure and froze up walking into her motorcade.
[02:03:34.511 --> 02:03:35.852]  Well, she had pneumonia.
[02:03:35.872 --> 02:03:36.893]  How do you know?
[02:03:37.113 --> 02:03:37.693]  Who told you that?
[02:03:37.933 --> 02:03:39.394]  Well, the campaign told us that.
[02:03:39.594 --> 02:03:41.195]  Why would you trust a campaign?
[02:03:41.315 --> 02:03:45.538]  The point is, you didn't talk to anybody who'd ever examined Hillary Clinton.
[02:03:45.838 --> 02:03:48.220]  I don't take anything Hillary Clinton's gonna say.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:48.640]  Back it up.
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:49.421]  Back it up to start.
[02:03:50.487 --> 02:03:52.548]  Doctors don't talk to people they've examined.
[02:03:52.808 --> 02:03:55.050]  You know there's health laws as an investigative journalist.
[02:03:55.990 --> 02:04:00.593]  He got it from the campaign of a known discredited organization in the WikiLeaks of total liars.
[02:04:01.113 --> 02:04:13.521]  And the Supreme Court, as Sernovich told you in the interview, sources, shouldn't have said that up the slip, and the Secret Service gave us the info about her and the black ambulance falling down and having seizures every 45 minutes.
[02:04:13.801 --> 02:04:15.742]  But you know that, don't you, Scott Paley?
[02:04:15.982 --> 02:04:16.743]  Let's go out to break with him.
[02:04:16.763 --> 02:04:17.043]  Here he is.
[02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:21.734]  She had a seizure and froze up walking into her motorcade.
[02:04:23.817 --> 02:04:25.138]  Well, she had pneumonia.
[02:04:25.158 --> 02:04:26.179]  How do you know?
[02:04:26.399 --> 02:04:27.000]  Who told you that?
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:28.702]  Well, the campaign told us that.
[02:04:28.882 --> 02:04:30.204]  Why would you trust the campaign?
[02:04:30.624 --> 02:04:34.849]  The point is, you didn't talk to anybody who'd ever examined Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:37.512]  I don't take anything Hillary Clinton is going to say.
[02:04:39.082 --> 02:04:39.402]  At all.
[02:04:39.703 --> 02:04:40.083]  It's true.
[02:04:40.103 --> 02:04:41.484]  I'm not going to take her on her word.
[02:04:41.965 --> 02:04:44.247]  The media says we're not going to take Donald Trump on his word.
[02:04:44.668 --> 02:04:47.611]  And that's why we are in these different universes.
[02:05:02.927 --> 02:05:05.108]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:05.288 --> 02:05:05.888]  Former U.S.
[02:05:05.948 --> 02:05:11.751]  Attorney Susan Rice ordered by spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets involving Trump.
[02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:13.712]  Article up by the Daily Caller.
[02:05:13.912 --> 02:05:18.053]  Former President Barack Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice ordered U.S.
[02:05:18.073 --> 02:05:26.217]  spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president according to
[02:05:26.377 --> 02:05:27.597]  We're good to go.
[02:05:53.243 --> 02:05:56.384]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:06:18.573 --> 02:06:23.795]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:06:24.295 --> 02:06:30.157]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:06:30.537 --> 02:06:35.959]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[02:06:36.839 --> 02:06:39.280]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:40.460]  We're the solution!
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.321]  Americans!
[02:06:41.721 --> 02:06:43.161]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[02:06:43.261 --> 02:06:48.484]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:06:48.644 --> 02:06:50.324]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:06:50.344 --> 02:06:51.805]  DVDs now available.
[02:06:52.265 --> 02:06:55.326]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:06:55.646 --> 02:06:57.827]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:07:02.577 --> 02:07:04.398]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:04.458 --> 02:07:06.319]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:06.479 --> 02:07:09.301]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:09.381 --> 02:07:15.245]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:15.445 --> 02:07:24.350]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:07:24.650 --> 02:07:29.493]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:07:29.713 --> 02:07:31.857]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:39.890]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:40.211 --> 02:07:41.172]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:42.385 --> 02:07:44.707]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:46.329 --> 02:07:49.752]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:49.892 --> 02:07:56.377]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:56.597 --> 02:08:00.721]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:08.465]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:09.025 --> 02:08:13.225]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.885 --> 02:08:17.706]  Well, the man of the hour in the real medium.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.946]  In the truth-based nationalistic media is Mike Cernovich, but he's not anywhere in the mainstream news.
[02:08:41.306 --> 02:08:47.572]  When he broke yesterday morning the Susan Rice information from the State Department that she's the one that ordered the unmasking.
[02:08:47.932 --> 02:08:53.097]  She's now given an interview to, I guess, Alan Greenspan's wife.
[02:08:55.699 --> 02:08:58.462]  And Fox News and others are reporting that's going to be aired soon.
[02:08:59.611 --> 02:09:02.552]  Where she says, I do not deny I did it, but I did nothing wrong.
[02:09:02.652 --> 02:09:03.653]  So let's get it straight.
[02:09:04.033 --> 02:09:07.095]  You spied on Trump for political purposes.
[02:09:07.755 --> 02:09:08.935]  You said you never did it.
[02:09:09.055 --> 02:09:09.776]  All of you lied.
[02:09:09.856 --> 02:09:10.696]  Now you've been caught.
[02:09:10.756 --> 02:09:12.197]  So now you're saying you did nothing wrong.
[02:09:15.078 --> 02:09:16.679]  We're getting started with this line up on Skype right now.
[02:09:16.699 --> 02:09:17.459]  If not, we'll go to phone.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.842]  But understand folks, they're all over the news with these headlines.
[02:09:23.942 --> 02:09:31.890]  Blackwater founder held secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin backchannel on January 9th.
[02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:40.398]  The United Arab Emirates, who he represents and has built an army for, wants to meet to then have Trump cut off Iran once he becomes president.
[02:09:41.119 --> 02:09:43.841]  So now, oh my god, you're not allowed to talk to the
[02:09:44.781 --> 02:09:50.908]  United Arab Emirates and of course the Russians were there trying to get the Russians to join the United States in not being allies with Iran.
[02:09:51.108 --> 02:09:53.010]  That'd be a great victory for the United States.
[02:09:53.370 --> 02:09:55.352]  How dare Eric Prince!
[02:09:57.094 --> 02:10:01.218]  This meeting is the leader of the United Arab Emirates, totally legal.
[02:10:01.759 --> 02:10:03.401]  Eric Prince is now an international citizen.
[02:10:04.582 --> 02:10:05.243]  Totally normal.
[02:10:07.133 --> 02:10:14.000]  And the media then spins it like Russians, dun-dun-dun, at the headlines this morning where Russian web continues to expand.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:21.347]  Imagine, out of tens of thousands of people in the executive branch of the Trump circle, they're talking to Russians!
[02:10:22.108 --> 02:10:26.051]  And that's where they've succeeded, even though they failed overall, trying to bring Trump down with this.
[02:10:26.832 --> 02:10:29.655]  Trump was supposedly already going to have meetings with Putin, hadn't had it yet.
[02:10:29.895 --> 02:10:31.437]  He's having with all these other world leaders.
[02:10:32.691 --> 02:10:36.234]  But hadn't had it with Putin yet because the optics of him meeting with Putin.
[02:10:36.514 --> 02:10:37.515]  That's giving in!
[02:10:37.875 --> 02:10:39.857]  Have him up there for an hour-long press conference!
[02:10:40.117 --> 02:10:41.458]  Make jokes about this!
[02:10:42.379 --> 02:10:46.522]  Putin, I like Russia, but let me tell you, I'm sorry I brought coal back.
[02:10:46.542 --> 02:10:48.003]  I know that devastates your gas exports.
[02:10:48.303 --> 02:10:51.446]  What'd you lose, about 300, 400 billion a year?
[02:10:51.686 --> 02:10:52.567]  Sorry, America first.
[02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:59.394]  Oh my gosh, Trump to meet with Putin's favorite congressman as Russia story swirls.
[02:10:59.574 --> 02:11:01.676]  Oh my god, Dana Rohrbacher.
[02:11:02.017 --> 02:11:03.158]  Been on the show many times.
[02:11:03.218 --> 02:11:03.978]  Pro-gun guy.
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:09.304]  Since Russia's not communist anymore, says we ought to have businesses in Russia.
[02:11:09.544 --> 02:11:10.545]  We ought to have trade.
[02:11:10.645 --> 02:11:11.426]  Oh my god!
[02:11:12.186 --> 02:11:15.129]  Oh my god, Dana Rohrbacher, another Russki agent.
[02:11:16.290 --> 02:11:18.352]  The Russians aren't communist anymore.
[02:11:19.312 --> 02:11:19.752]  They're not.
[02:11:20.353 --> 02:11:22.375]  All that old anti-Russia propaganda they're not here.
[02:11:22.395 --> 02:11:25.037]  Oh my God, they're getting ready to put the Red Stars back on the tanks.
[02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.198]  It's all over.
[02:11:26.238 --> 02:11:27.739]  The globalists got kicked out of Russia.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.141]  Does Russia have problems?
[02:11:29.561 --> 02:11:30.942]  Does it have absolutely?
[02:11:31.022 --> 02:11:31.823]  Is Putin perfect?
[02:11:31.843 --> 02:11:32.323]  No!
[02:11:33.144 --> 02:11:33.845]  Compared to China?
[02:11:33.865 --> 02:11:35.246]  Compared to Saudi Arabia?
[02:11:35.266 --> 02:11:37.148]  Compared to the EU threatening to attack us?
[02:11:38.028 --> 02:11:38.569]  It's incredible.
[02:11:42.304 --> 02:11:45.005]  Now, again, we're working to get Mike Cernovich on Skype.
[02:11:45.126 --> 02:11:46.326]  Let's pull the plug, go right to phone.
[02:11:46.586 --> 02:11:51.669]  I want to get this great American on with us, as we got other guests coming up as well, so we need to get to him.
[02:11:53.090 --> 02:11:57.812]  Breaking down the amazing work he did with his sources, also the film producer of Silenced.
[02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:07.498]  Now we're going to go to Mike Cernovich, who we finally got to Skype up.
[02:12:07.558 --> 02:12:09.018]  Great technology, but has its problems.
[02:12:09.078 --> 02:12:09.819]  Again, imagine.
[02:12:13.015 --> 02:12:14.935]  They're now not denying that Rice did the unmasking.
[02:12:16.256 --> 02:12:17.076]  He gets the intel.
[02:12:17.096 --> 02:12:17.996]  The media's sitting on it.
[02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:18.736]  He reports on it.
[02:12:18.756 --> 02:12:20.377]  An hour later, Bloomberg reports it yesterday.
[02:12:20.957 --> 02:12:22.377]  And they try at first to say it's fake news.
[02:12:22.397 --> 02:12:23.137]  Now they've backed off.
[02:12:23.197 --> 02:12:23.497]  It's real.
[02:12:23.857 --> 02:12:25.638]  This is their whole narrative falling apart.
[02:12:25.678 --> 02:12:27.338]  But again, they think we're idiots.
[02:12:28.418 --> 02:12:29.659]  They think we're morons.
[02:12:30.399 --> 02:12:31.239]  They were all over the news.
[02:12:31.259 --> 02:12:33.259]  We can put it behind us, saying wiretapping.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.000]  And Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian hacking.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.581]  And then we have the other lady.
[02:12:39.601 --> 02:12:40.841]  We're going to play the clip of her coming up.
[02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:55.416]  Yeah, Evelyn Farkas, the head of the Russia program at the Pentagon, saying that they were spying and did this, and that specifically it was the State Department.
[02:12:55.456 --> 02:13:00.159]  So, they live in another world where they really think you've all got goldfish memories.
[02:13:02.021 --> 02:13:02.601]  Seven seconds.
[02:13:03.201 --> 02:13:10.226]  So in the same interviews they say, we were spying on Trump, I know he's a Russian agent, but it's insane he says we're spying on him, it's totally crazy, isn't he a nut?
[02:13:11.287 --> 02:13:12.928]  And then now, as she gets caught,
[02:13:14.201 --> 02:13:27.925]  Evelyn Farkas came out two days ago, remember Sunday, and she said the Russians have put out the lie that she said in March on CNN and MSNBC that they were spying and had the proof.
[02:13:27.965 --> 02:13:29.346]  So, she says it!
[02:13:30.228 --> 02:13:31.268]  And it's the Russians' fault.
[02:13:31.569 --> 02:13:37.071]  I mean, if she eats 20 cheeseburgers a day and giant tubs of ice cream and weighs 800 pounds, is that the Russians' fault?
[02:13:37.331 --> 02:13:39.291]  If I don't wipe my ass, is that the Russians' fault?
[02:13:39.531 --> 02:13:43.213]  I mean, I'm sorry to use these terms, but if I don't brush my teeth, is it the Russians' fault?
[02:13:43.613 --> 02:13:48.575]  If I don't, you know, kiss my kids when they go to school in the morning, or don't cook them breakfast, is that the Russians' fault?
[02:13:48.975 --> 02:13:54.217]  If I slip on a banana peel, is that the Russians' fault?
[02:13:56.498 --> 02:13:57.138]  And then we learn
[02:13:58.766 --> 02:14:01.969]  That Trump's own executive branch won't even give him the intel he was being spied on.
[02:14:01.989 --> 02:14:04.151]  He has to go to Nunes.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.460]  In the House Intelligence Committee.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:09.621]  And then they say, oh, Nunes can't be trusted.
[02:14:09.661 --> 02:14:10.341]  He's one of those, too.
[02:14:10.661 --> 02:14:15.943]  So, joining us is investigative journalist, lawyer, constitutional lawyer, Ann Moore.
[02:14:16.543 --> 02:14:17.984]  And, of course, that's Mike Cernovich.
[02:14:18.004 --> 02:14:21.385]  He was just on with us last week with the big fake news guy.
[02:14:21.405 --> 02:14:22.465]  He said Hillary was sick.
[02:14:22.805 --> 02:14:23.906]  Yeah, the Secret Service told us.
[02:14:24.006 --> 02:14:26.086]  And we have her having seizures and in medical tents.
[02:14:26.426 --> 02:14:27.347]  And she looks like hell.
[02:14:27.647 --> 02:14:30.788]  But the point is, they're telling us Kim Jong-il was in great health until he died.
[02:14:31.128 --> 02:14:32.708]  Danger in Play is his website.
[02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.889]  Wow.
[02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:38.954]  Isn't it crazy, like we broke NSA documents two weeks ago that Trump wasn't being spied on.
[02:14:39.234 --> 02:14:41.697]  His phone numbers, family numbers, real stuff.
[02:14:42.959 --> 02:14:44.400]  And the total blackout.
[02:14:44.721 --> 02:14:49.086]  With you they can't ignore it, but they black out that Mr. Fake News was who broke it.
[02:14:49.186 --> 02:14:51.189]  The truth is you're not fake news, they're fake news.
[02:14:51.369 --> 02:14:52.891]  That's why they brand us with what they are.
[02:14:55.711 --> 02:14:59.873]  Yeah, Alex, I actually have an even bigger story I wanted to break.
[02:14:59.933 --> 02:15:01.653]  I've been waiting to break on your show.
[02:15:02.133 --> 02:15:13.158]  We found out now how Deep State is sabotaging Trump to the pedophile networks and how now they're controlling who's being hired in the administration by administering...
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.481]  You know, this is too important.
[02:15:18.501 --> 02:15:20.703]  He can stay on Skype video, but I want to go to phone.
[02:15:21.044 --> 02:15:27.250]  I almost want to just get rid of Skype, because once Skype starts up, we'll just, like, get drug into a bad relationship.
[02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:29.793]  We just stay on it for hours, and we'll just stay with it.
[02:15:30.113 --> 02:15:30.674]  Mike, stay there.
[02:15:30.694 --> 02:15:31.615]  We're going to call you on the cell.
[02:15:31.635 --> 02:15:36.420]  We'll put your image up there, but we're going to go, because this is too important, and we're having Skype problems.
[02:15:37.805 --> 02:15:44.309]  This is breaking news and information here, and I'm trying not to skip breaks, but I tell you, there's just so much to cover here.
[02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:46.370]  We've got other guests coming up as well.
[02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:53.654]  I know we will have to push her back a little bit so that Mike Cernovich can have the floor and be able to cover all this.
[02:15:54.715 --> 02:16:01.438]  But as soon as we get through our phone system and all that archaic Byzantine fandangling, we will be able to get that information again.
[02:16:01.458 --> 02:16:02.079]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:16:02.399 --> 02:16:03.359]  This is Info Wars.
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:04.280]  Are we ready, guys?
[02:16:07.495 --> 02:16:10.996]  Okay, anyways, major breaking news and information here.
[02:16:11.156 --> 02:16:19.018]  Infowars.com forward slash show is the main show link with the free podcast, the iPhone, Android apps, and so much more.
[02:16:19.498 --> 02:16:24.499]  And it's really up to all of you out there to keep spreading those links, the video feeds, and so much more.
[02:16:24.539 --> 02:16:26.540]  Because without you, we will be shut down.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:36.122]  Without your prayers, without you spreading the word, without your financial support, we just absolutely will not be able to continue on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:36.702 --> 02:16:44.004]  And soon I'm going to produce my whole show out of studio because one of the issues is taking a phone call here is like an act of Congress.
[02:16:45.005 --> 02:16:46.865]  But we're going to do that here in just a moment.
[02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:49.406]  Maybe we should play a Susan Rice clip here.
[02:16:49.826 --> 02:16:51.867]  Let's just do that while we do our normal thing.
[02:16:52.447 --> 02:16:54.568]  Here's Susan Rice trying to deny all this garbage.
[02:16:55.128 --> 02:16:55.408]  Here it is.
[02:16:57.668 --> 02:16:58.768]  I know nothing about this.
[02:16:59.048 --> 02:17:04.870]  I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Yunus on that count today.
[02:17:04.890 --> 02:17:08.271]  I mean, let's back up and recall where we have been.
[02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:15.953]  The President of the United States accused his predecessor, President Obama, of wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign.
[02:17:16.893 --> 02:17:28.478]  Nothing of the sort occurred, and we've heard that confirmed by the director of the FBI, who also pointed out that no president, no White House, can order the surveillance of another American citizen.
[02:17:28.518 --> 02:17:32.519]  That can only come from the Justice Department, with the approval of a FISA court.
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:38.582]  So today, I really don't know to what Chairman Nunes was referring.
[02:17:39.485 --> 02:17:40.567]  Yeah, we don't do anything illegal.
[02:17:40.667 --> 02:17:44.572]  Okay, Mike Cernovich, the man they said was fake news, because he's been so accurate.
[02:17:44.793 --> 02:17:45.694]  We've got you on the phone now.
[02:17:45.734 --> 02:17:47.817]  Go ahead and tell us about this big breaking news.
[02:17:48.678 --> 02:17:54.467]  Oh my God, so I've actually, I've been waiting to break this story out, but I couldn't break the story until...
[02:17:55.490 --> 02:18:07.682]  I had a big scoop like Susan Rice, but the whole reason I broke the Susan Rice story is because I wanted to break the story and I wanted to break the story on your show because we have the whole enchilada, the pedophile networks of the deep state.
[02:18:08.023 --> 02:18:10.105]  So I'm going to break it down for you real quick.
[02:18:10.689 --> 02:18:18.093]  The reason Trump can't get his people hired is because the security clearances are being jammed up and not going through.
[02:18:18.113 --> 02:18:25.377]  The reason they're not going through is that the people who administer the polygraph in Deep State are actually part of the pedophile ring.
[02:18:26.198 --> 02:18:31.182]  And they only want pedophiles in Deep State because they're compromised and they can be blackmailed.
[02:18:31.543 --> 02:18:35.806]  So everything that we thought that Trump was making a mistake, he actually wasn't.
[02:18:36.167 --> 02:18:40.390]  The people who administer the polygraphs in Deep State are all part of the pedophile network.
[02:18:40.891 --> 02:18:43.093]  They only want to hire people
[02:18:43.889 --> 02:18:46.651]  Oh, I've had CIA people say they can't come on anymore.
[02:18:46.671 --> 02:18:48.052]  Their whole lives have been ruined.
[02:18:48.072 --> 02:18:50.194]  I mean, they're coming after everybody.
[02:18:50.234 --> 02:18:52.796]  This pedophile thing is what they're afraid of.
[02:19:06.684 --> 02:19:08.205]  Yeah, so this is the real thing.
[02:19:08.645 --> 02:19:11.847]  We now know that that is how Deep State has sabotaged Trump.
[02:19:11.887 --> 02:19:21.533]  Now, I talked to the person who had investigated, and I worked at my detailed source network, and he had told me that where this happens initially is in swingers clubs.
[02:19:22.134 --> 02:19:30.579]  And these swinger clubs are outside of Washington, D.C., and what happens is they find people who are into wife swapping and other kinds of activities.
[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:39.062]  And then they drug them, roofie them essentially, and then children are brought in and they post their pictures with children, naked children.
[02:19:39.122 --> 02:19:45.043]  Oh, I was told that by sources that they'll have a woman trick you with first somebody that's like 16 when you're drugged.
[02:19:45.403 --> 02:19:46.343]  Wow, this is amazing.
[02:19:46.583 --> 02:19:47.923]  My other sources are telling me this too.
[02:19:48.163 --> 02:19:49.224]  Mike Cernovich, you're awesome.
[02:19:49.244 --> 02:19:50.164]  Sorry I got frustrated earlier.
[02:19:50.464 --> 02:19:51.824]  Skype drives me crazy sometimes.
[02:19:51.864 --> 02:19:52.884]  Great crew, great people.
[02:19:53.185 --> 02:19:53.825]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:53.845 --> 02:19:55.265]  I just want to get all this intel out.
[02:19:55.765 --> 02:19:59.846]  And we got the guy that broke the Susan Rice information on with us right now.
[02:20:00.686 --> 02:20:02.348]  The gold standard in real news.
[02:20:02.408 --> 02:20:03.068]  Mike Cernovich.

[02:23:58.815 --> 02:24:11.380]  Mike Cernovich, investigative journalist, is our guest right now in 10 minutes in the next segment.
[02:24:12.466 --> 02:24:17.808]  And then we've got our investigators on the ground with massive pedophile arrests.
[02:24:17.828 --> 02:24:25.890]  474 reported pedophiles, more than 30 women in bondage, some men, and then 28 children, some of them very small, in cages.
[02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:28.691]  That's KTLA and other reports, but nothing since then.
[02:24:28.711 --> 02:24:30.492]  And law enforcement's very, very upset.
[02:24:30.512 --> 02:24:31.292]  I got Cernovich on.
[02:24:32.662 --> 02:24:43.647]  As a lawyer and filmmaker, investigative journalist, just out of necessity, a journalist, to get into his big scoop on the situation with Rice.
[02:24:44.908 --> 02:24:46.488]  And she's now basically admitting she did it.
[02:24:46.568 --> 02:24:51.050]  So that's an even bigger victory just for the true media that they try to demonize as fake when they're the ones that are fake.
[02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:52.971]  But obviously he's always moving on to the next thing.
[02:24:53.431 --> 02:24:58.674]  What's stunning about Cernovich is getting to follow him the last year or so is my sources
[02:24:59.736 --> 02:25:02.498]  And I can't get into all the sources, even though they're on-air, some of them.
[02:25:02.558 --> 02:25:04.219]  They can tell me more off-air than they can on-air.
[02:25:04.679 --> 02:25:08.262]  But, I mean, you know, take Saw Man, Craig Sawyer.
[02:25:08.302 --> 02:25:12.545]  I mean, he's a former SEAL team leader, been in the most elite SEAL team.
[02:25:12.805 --> 02:25:14.126]  Obviously, I'm not going to say what he did there.
[02:25:14.146 --> 02:25:17.588]  And a federal officer, led task forces, you name it.
[02:25:18.048 --> 02:25:19.809]  Five shows on Discovery and History.
[02:25:19.829 --> 02:25:20.850]  Three of them, he's the main guy.
[02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:22.131]  A lot to lose.
[02:25:22.171 --> 02:25:23.132]  And he's been threatened with this.
[02:25:23.852 --> 02:25:30.194]  So he goes public, says we're going to start doing shows about it from the sources, because the thing missing is media that has the courage to cover it.
[02:25:30.534 --> 02:25:38.397]  And from other sources, that's what I get is, they take congressmen, I've had this from FBI, CIA, Navy SEALs, Delta Force, Army.
[02:25:40.091 --> 02:25:42.553]  You name it, all these groups, because it's just as thick as thieves.
[02:25:42.593 --> 02:25:43.233]  They can't stand it.
[02:25:43.273 --> 02:25:43.774]  It's everywhere.
[02:25:44.534 --> 02:26:01.227]  And they'll be there, and that's how they do it, is they get a mistress to drug you, then bring kids in, take photos, or a 16-year-old you don't know, you're drugged, with another woman brings them in, and that this is the standard operating procedure of, oh, let me get you a hooker, and then she looks like she's 20, but she's 16.
[02:26:01.567 --> 02:26:07.351]  Then they've got you, and then that's how they're compromising people, and then you say the exact thing from your source.
[02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:08.452]  So, tell us about that.
[02:26:09.676 --> 02:26:12.618]  Yeah, so there's two layers to this I learned about.
[02:26:13.218 --> 02:26:28.546]  And I also heard from the source, he told me that actually Pizzagate was a distraction and it was actually a false flag, a psychological operation run by Deep State to get people focusing away from... Was this before I figured it out or after that?
[02:26:29.434 --> 02:26:36.937]  This was, but I can't give the exact date because I don't want to reveal my sources and I am spying on them.
[02:26:36.957 --> 02:26:38.598]  They admit they're spying, but I mean I get it.
[02:26:38.658 --> 02:26:39.499]  I figured that out too.
[02:26:40.543 --> 02:26:44.507]  Yeah, so what really is going on is that there's two parallel institutions.
[02:26:45.268 --> 02:26:49.173]  One is that the pedophilia is not about people who are actually into children.
[02:26:49.653 --> 02:26:53.377]  Deep State uses that so that they control everybody within Deep State.
[02:26:53.678 --> 02:27:01.867]  I've heard that as many as one third of people in the intelligence community are either actual pedophiles or they have been photographed as children.
[02:27:02.407 --> 02:27:03.368]  We're good to go.
[02:27:18.457 --> 02:27:18.717]  I think so.
[02:27:39.156 --> 02:27:39.997]  We're good to go.
[02:27:56.895 --> 02:28:06.101]  Is that Trump can't get his people in because the people who are doing the security clearances, they don't want Trump supporters in because Trump supporters aren't into that kind of stuff.
[02:28:06.441 --> 02:28:09.724]  And they know that you can't blackmail and control them.
[02:28:10.144 --> 02:28:11.485]  So they do roofie people.
[02:28:11.885 --> 02:28:13.066]  That is how they blackmail them.
[02:28:27.375 --> 02:28:31.437]  And all of a sudden these beautiful women come in and they're like, oh, go with us.
[02:28:31.497 --> 02:28:33.258]  And I was smart and he goes, yeah, we've been drugged.
[02:28:33.618 --> 02:28:36.860]  We got out of there and barely made it down the street, barely got cabs.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:42.562]  And by the time I got home, I was crawling, because I had a car down there, crawling into the house.
[02:28:43.222 --> 02:28:44.543]  And I don't know what they hit me with.
[02:28:44.563 --> 02:28:47.084]  I never went and got tested, but it was definitely an intelligence setup.
[02:28:47.324 --> 02:28:48.485]  I never told that story until just now.
[02:28:49.608 --> 02:28:55.333]  Yeah, no, I've been told actually by people, they've told me that I have six months and that's it.
[02:28:55.353 --> 02:29:01.579]  Then I'm either going to have to take some kind of bribe or that they're going to tell me that they're really going to take it.
[02:29:01.819 --> 02:29:03.941]  That's just how they play mind games, like they're in control.
[02:29:03.961 --> 02:29:06.503]  Mike, we're going to run over these people.
[02:29:06.863 --> 02:29:07.804]  Can you smell their blood?
[02:29:07.824 --> 02:29:08.645]  Can you smell the blood, brother?
[02:29:09.599 --> 02:29:11.661]  Well that's why we're breaking these deep state stories.
[02:29:11.701 --> 02:29:13.742]  That's why people are coming to you and coming to me.
[02:29:14.103 --> 02:29:15.564]  Because they want them out.
[02:29:15.644 --> 02:29:19.387]  And they realize that the Susan Rice story, Bloomberg sat on it.
[02:29:19.407 --> 02:29:21.208]  The Washington Post sat on it.
[02:29:21.548 --> 02:29:25.131]  Nobody wanted to run it because they knew this proof.
[02:29:25.171 --> 02:29:26.272]  This is bigger than Watergate.
[02:29:26.532 --> 02:29:30.155]  By the way, Sean Hannity, Eric Brent, they were also wiretapped.
[02:29:30.175 --> 02:29:30.896]  They were spied on.
[02:29:31.236 --> 02:29:32.077]  You were spied on.
[02:29:32.197 --> 02:29:32.857]  I was spied on.
[02:29:32.917 --> 02:29:33.758]  Roger Stone was.
[02:29:33.838 --> 02:29:34.659]  Chuck Johnson was.
[02:29:35.199 --> 02:29:36.981]  Everybody was spied on.
[02:29:37.261 --> 02:29:38.562]  Anybody who isn't a pedophile?
[02:29:39.195 --> 02:29:39.435]  Yeah.
[02:29:39.675 --> 02:29:41.677]  We're all being spied on.
[02:29:41.697 --> 02:29:43.438]  That's why everybody has to be very careful.
[02:29:43.458 --> 02:29:46.560]  They call us empowered individuals they don't control.
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:48.161]  Red-blooded Americans are all being spied on.
[02:29:48.381 --> 02:29:49.382]  Let's come back, Mike.
[02:29:49.422 --> 02:29:50.983]  You're laying out truth because I have my own sources.
[02:29:51.344 --> 02:29:52.184]  This guy's dead on.
[02:29:52.244 --> 02:29:53.125]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.645 --> 02:29:55.246]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.167 --> 02:29:58.849]  Alec Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.012 --> 02:30:05.194]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:30:05.374 --> 02:30:05.975]  Former U.S.
[02:30:06.035 --> 02:30:11.861]  Attorney Susan Rice ordered by spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets involving Trump.
[02:30:12.061 --> 02:30:13.823]  Article up by the Daily Caller.
[02:30:14.003 --> 02:30:18.167]  Former President Barack Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice ordered U.S.
[02:30:18.187 --> 02:30:23.953]  spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides.
[02:30:24.233 --> 02:30:24.773]  We're good to go.
[02:30:53.445 --> 02:30:55.190]  Unmasking of the people and the calls.
[02:30:55.531 --> 02:30:58.079]  This has been Joe Bates with InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.319 --> 02:31:01.027]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:03.021 --> 02:31:11.188]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:31:11.268 --> 02:31:12.108]  A 360 win.

[02:31:19.054 --> 02:31:26.600]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:31.404]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:32.064 --> 02:31:37.989]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:38.169 --> 02:31:45.614]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:45.955 --> 02:31:52.460]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:53.981]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:54.121 --> 02:31:56.467]  Win win win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:56.567 --> 02:31:58.231]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:31:58.552 --> 02:32:02.401]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:32:03.342 --> 02:32:04.683]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:32:04.923 --> 02:32:09.725]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:32:10.085 --> 02:32:13.107]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:32:13.367 --> 02:32:18.730]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:32:19.170 --> 02:32:24.873]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:32:25.293 --> 02:32:27.876]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:32:28.277 --> 02:32:33.383]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:32:33.843 --> 02:32:40.571]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[02:32:40.871 --> 02:32:45.417]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:32:45.697 --> 02:32:48.839]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[02:32:48.979 --> 02:32:50.880]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:56.603]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[02:32:56.803 --> 02:32:58.785]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[02:32:59.225 --> 02:33:00.906]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:33:12.125 --> 02:33:16.572]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:17.152 --> 02:33:18.675]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.296 --> 02:33:23.142]  That's right, in defense of free will, universal law.
[02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:26.181]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:26.261 --> 02:33:35.467]  Mike Cernovich is our guest under 10 minutes, and Millie Weaver and our crew are interviewing the police, state police, county police, that have been doing these giant pedophile roundups.
[02:33:35.567 --> 02:33:36.628]  And we're not talking about child porn.
[02:33:36.648 --> 02:33:40.811]  We're talking about the people producing it, reportedly, and using them in sex slavery.
[02:33:41.551 --> 02:33:44.373]  The love of the pedophiles last year have come out, so everything's mainstream.
[02:33:44.653 --> 02:33:54.760]  They thought it was their time with Hillary, who first, of course, represented pedophiles as her main job, and then Bill on Jerry Epstein's plane, the Lolita Express, and it just goes on from there.
[02:33:56.140 --> 02:33:58.281]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[02:33:58.601 --> 02:33:59.702]  DangerInPlay.com.
[02:34:00.882 --> 02:34:04.383]  Mike, I heard you were saying you want to come down here and dump even more personally on air.
[02:34:04.403 --> 02:34:04.884]  You're welcome.
[02:34:04.904 --> 02:34:07.845]  We'll fly you down here, you know, next week if you want to, or this week.
[02:34:08.845 --> 02:34:10.886]  But looking at this, there's clearly a war.
[02:34:10.946 --> 02:34:11.726]  There's clearly a war.
[02:34:11.786 --> 02:34:13.567]  And Trump has said he wants to kill pedophiles.
[02:34:13.607 --> 02:34:14.307]  He's on record.
[02:34:14.547 --> 02:34:16.188]  We know he's turned the Justice Department loose.
[02:34:16.588 --> 02:34:18.649]  The problem is once it hits the level of the courts,
[02:34:19.662 --> 02:34:20.763]  It's just ending there.
[02:34:21.283 --> 02:34:24.925]  So from your sources, I've got mine, one of them's coming up next hour.
[02:34:26.125 --> 02:34:27.026]  Where is this battle?
[02:34:27.086 --> 02:34:28.346]  Where is this fight right now?
[02:34:28.406 --> 02:34:29.287]  How epic is this?
[02:34:30.535 --> 02:34:36.358]  Right now, to keep our eye on the prize, the eye on the prize are security clearances.
[02:34:36.798 --> 02:34:38.279]  That is the eye on the prize.
[02:34:38.739 --> 02:34:46.923]  Every time a Trump person is denied a security clearance, that is where Trump's people need to investigate that person and his ties to pedophilia.
[02:34:47.283 --> 02:34:52.826]  That's what I told they go... Yeah, not the person who's denied, not the person that's denied, but the people doing the security clearance.
[02:34:52.866 --> 02:34:57.088]  And let me tell you how, I don't know, because I have my sources obviously, and let me explain something.
[02:34:57.908 --> 02:35:00.090]  Everybody that's a patriot gets refused.
[02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:06.195]  They'll say, oh, he was at a bar two weeks ago and a Russian shook his hand and he didn't know this was a Russian spy.
[02:35:06.235 --> 02:35:08.217]  Well, they're sending in the double agent Russian.
[02:35:08.517 --> 02:35:11.139]  They take a photo or video and that's shown.
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:20.367]  When Trump says, why can't I get any of my people, they use this whole Russia thing as the excuse when they've got a team of Russians out there going around making connections that aren't Russians.
[02:35:20.387 --> 02:35:21.408]  You know, they're fake Russians.
[02:35:21.428 --> 02:35:22.990]  I mean, they're the Russian background.
[02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:29.192]  I mean, this is, so what you're saying is what I've been told separately by my White House sources, so that's amazing.
[02:35:30.172 --> 02:35:36.114]  Yeah, it's all, I mean, it's all coming together, and that is why, you know, the media, they're really going after us hard.
[02:35:36.394 --> 02:35:40.395]  And the real reason the media freaked out about Pete Sicata also found out was because
[02:35:41.115 --> 02:35:44.877]  They knew that people were looking at a pedophilia, and they don't want that.
[02:35:44.917 --> 02:35:48.878]  But it wasn't about... Here's what the guy told me, and most people have confirmed it.
[02:35:48.918 --> 02:35:55.641]  He goes, Mike, this might sound really nasty or nihilistic to you, he goes, but it's not about pedophilia.
[02:35:56.061 --> 02:35:57.362]  It's about security clearances.
[02:35:57.862 --> 02:35:58.103]  I think so.
[02:36:17.445 --> 02:36:20.968]  Have them look at the person who is denying the clearances.
[02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:22.930]  Those are the people who are compromised.
[02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:25.172]  Because that's how they keep you out of deep state.
[02:36:25.552 --> 02:36:29.556]  Once they get a deep state, all they care about is keeping you out of it so you can't clean them out.
[02:36:29.876 --> 02:36:30.757]  And then meanwhile, you're right.
[02:36:30.797 --> 02:36:31.638]  They're nihilistic.
[02:36:31.678 --> 02:36:32.919]  They're into all sorts of stuff.
[02:36:33.639 --> 02:36:36.580]  In fact, a lot of the big people like Eric Schmidt and others, he's into like 20 women.
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:38.060]  You know, he's not into that.
[02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:40.820]  But they clearly, absolutely, that's the thing.
[02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:42.541]  Cheating on your wife's not good enough.
[02:36:42.581 --> 02:36:43.941]  Being gay is not good enough anymore.
[02:36:44.381 --> 02:36:45.781]  Now they've got to have something.
[02:36:46.201 --> 02:36:49.602]  And so a lot of folks, I've been told, you have to be inducted.
[02:36:49.642 --> 02:36:50.582]  Like at a Bohemian Grove.
[02:36:50.602 --> 02:36:51.903]  There's not all bad folks at Bohemian Grove.
[02:36:51.923 --> 02:36:52.783]  Most of it's above board.
[02:36:53.123 --> 02:36:54.263]  But it's very homoerotic.
[02:36:55.103 --> 02:36:55.663]  That's admitted.
[02:36:55.683 --> 02:36:59.384]  They tell you, you want to be in the bigger club, have sex with this 15-year-old.
[02:37:00.597 --> 02:37:02.599]  Yeah, because they own you, again.
[02:37:02.839 --> 02:37:06.762]  And then the other angle that we can talk about, and I can give you names.
[02:37:07.242 --> 02:37:10.084]  I have people who have been arrested.
[02:37:10.284 --> 02:37:13.907]  There have been multiple arrests, but nobody was ever able to connect the dots.
[02:37:14.307 --> 02:37:26.876]  What they also do is they hire the security at comic conventions, the comic cons, and the security people are trained to recognize kind of 14-year-old wayward girls, and that's how they recruit their sex slaves.
[02:37:27.632 --> 02:37:29.453]  It's all the, you know, 14-year-old girls.
[02:37:29.894 --> 02:37:32.135]  You know, you can kind of tell when somebody's a little bit lost.
[02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.457]  But they actually have... Yeah, they look desperate.
[02:37:34.497 --> 02:37:35.358]  They, you know, they want help.
[02:37:35.378 --> 02:37:38.560]  And you tell them, hey, you want to be a star, but hey, you're too young for porn.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:39.881]  That's in four years, sweetheart.
[02:37:40.201 --> 02:37:41.942]  We're going to put you on the inside track, baby.
[02:37:42.923 --> 02:37:47.186]  Then they roll their sleeves up and say, by the way, take some of this to get full control of them.
[02:37:48.565 --> 02:37:49.125]  Exactly.
[02:37:49.285 --> 02:37:50.866]  So that is the tier two.
[02:37:50.906 --> 02:37:55.108]  So the tier one is the pedophilia, the compromise stuff, the swingers club.
[02:37:55.588 --> 02:37:56.528]  That's how they do it.
[02:37:56.788 --> 02:38:02.870]  And I was also told, and you know this, of course, too, but they told you, you better never be alone because anybody can be roofied.
[02:38:02.930 --> 02:38:05.691]  And that's what they do is they roofie people like me.
[02:38:05.711 --> 02:38:06.692]  Brother, they did it to me.
[02:38:06.772 --> 02:38:08.252]  I wasn't even drinking, okay?
[02:38:08.632 --> 02:38:12.534]  It was in my iced tea and I was like, we're like, let's get out of here.
[02:38:12.554 --> 02:38:13.514]  We're having a business meeting.
[02:38:13.954 --> 02:38:15.055]  I go, let's get out of here.
[02:38:16.215 --> 02:38:17.718]  Yeah, so all this is happening and...
[02:38:26.425 --> 02:38:33.487]  The comic convention is the tier two, and that's where they get the girls who are underage, but it's for the people who are like the Anthony Weiner type.
[02:38:33.807 --> 02:38:36.908]  Why do you think Anthony Weiner and Uma are still together?
[02:38:37.188 --> 02:38:39.989]  That was actually a spook that I had last year.
[02:38:40.249 --> 02:38:41.510]  They never were divorced.
[02:38:41.570 --> 02:38:42.130]  It's a sham.
[02:38:42.430 --> 02:38:48.932]  But Weiner's into underage girls, and people want to wonder if Uma was involved, what she knew, was she recruiting them?
[02:38:49.452 --> 02:38:57.940]  There might be another connection there and that's why Wiener and Uma have remained together even though he's ridiculed her, humiliated her, ruined her life repeatedly.
[02:38:58.301 --> 02:39:00.303]  There's something very weird going on there.
[02:39:00.343 --> 02:39:03.926]  Maybe there's a recruitment ring or something that they're part of.
[02:39:04.086 --> 02:39:05.107]  And let's expand on that.
[02:39:08.596 --> 02:39:15.563]  Under Islam, and the Wahhabi sect that her family is part of, her mother was the top person pushing genital mutilation in the West of women.
[02:39:16.263 --> 02:39:20.307]  That is a major tenet of Islam, is pedophilia of girls and boys.
[02:39:20.828 --> 02:39:25.993]  They kill gays because two adult men aren't supposed to have sex, or two adult women, so everything's upside down.
[02:39:26.033 --> 02:39:27.074]  That's considering adults, whatever.
[02:39:27.474 --> 02:39:29.576]  You know, make judgments if you want, but that's their right.
[02:39:31.078 --> 02:39:32.999]  Under Islam, it's in the Quran that
[02:39:33.843 --> 02:39:37.970]  Mohammed's marrying nine-year-olds, and so as long as it's with a child it's okay.
[02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:39.712]  This is truly satanic.
[02:39:40.093 --> 02:39:45.421]  That's why there's an alliance with the globalists and radical Islam, because it's two pedophilic organizations, Mike.
[02:39:46.676 --> 02:40:00.447]  Yeah, they are, and that is also, and again, you know, you and I, we tend to look at things morally and view everybody involved as kind of evil, but most of the people, they just view it, they're not like us, Alex, they're not like the people listening in.
[02:40:01.047 --> 02:40:08.413]  All they view it as, hey, if that guy's a pedophile like Dennis Pastner, Dennis Pastner was actually promoted up the ranks a lot higher than he should have been.
[02:40:08.453 --> 02:40:10.355]  Sure, from nowhere, because he was a pedophile.
[02:40:10.655 --> 02:40:17.018]  He was a procurer, so they took him from nowhere to be brought into the house, and then he made the speaker, because he was a weak person, or whatever he was told.
[02:40:18.198 --> 02:40:23.861]  Exactly, and because he was molesting children, the congressional pages, there's so much, they're so deep.
[02:40:24.671 --> 02:40:26.833]  And that is why everybody is really freaking out.
[02:40:26.853 --> 02:40:27.814]  Nobody's looked into it.
[02:40:28.174 --> 02:40:38.542]  And the reason, the real reason they wanted to remove General Flynn, I don't know if anybody's talked about this, but you probably know it, is General Flynn, even though it wasn't his turf, he had known about a lot of this stuff.
[02:40:38.783 --> 02:40:44.167]  Well, you notice his son, his son, I made a big deal out of this, Kep, just keeps hammering it because he's smart and knows what's going on.
[02:40:44.527 --> 02:40:46.229]  Of course Flynn knows about this and he's
[02:40:47.570 --> 02:40:51.912]  It's disgusting, and that's why I'm mad that, you know, we didn't really get sucked in.
[02:40:51.972 --> 02:40:55.074]  I was the first person to say, Pizza Gate's bull, and pull out of it.
[02:40:55.114 --> 02:40:55.855]  We didn't create it.
[02:40:56.055 --> 02:40:56.815]  MSN pushed it.
[02:40:57.055 --> 02:41:10.424]  And I went, wait, they're focusing on a small area of this larger stuff that's in the Podesta emails that's clearly dirty, the police are telling us, stuff the cops told us later came out that Wiener was child porn and, you know, about to be indicted, all that's happening, and the sexting the 15-year-old.
[02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:13.110]  And then I'm like, why are we covering this?
[02:41:13.311 --> 02:41:16.432]  And then I saw some disinfo pieces and I went, that's it, it's a setup.
[02:41:16.752 --> 02:41:20.093]  I totally got pizza, pizza place, code words, pizza.
[02:41:21.033 --> 02:41:28.555]  And then they turn me into the bad guy because I'm the one that figures it out by December 1st or even earlier and pulls out of it.
[02:41:29.095 --> 02:41:32.456]  They take it as a sign of weakness when no, it's me trying to be credible.
[02:41:32.817 --> 02:41:34.197]  All I have is the truth.
[02:41:34.437 --> 02:41:37.238]  And when we get diverted off, we're going to tell people.
[02:41:37.678 --> 02:41:40.239]  But I'll tell you this, the freak out over pedophile stuff,
[02:41:41.189 --> 02:41:51.652]  I've never seen, not when I exposed 9-11 and the Saudis and everything, and not when I've done all this other bombshell stuff, I'm getting ten times the resistance on this pedophile empire than anything else.
[02:41:51.672 --> 02:41:52.992]  What do you think that's about, Mike Cernovich?
[02:41:54.073 --> 02:41:58.694]  Yeah, because a lot, that's again, how they compromise people and the media.
[02:41:59.134 --> 02:42:04.275]  Because Operation Mockingbird proved that the CIA controls a lot of media.
[02:42:04.335 --> 02:42:10.197]  A lot of media people, again, they aren't, it's kind of sad, Alex, but they aren't actually pedophiles themselves.
[02:42:10.877 --> 02:42:11.457]  We're good to go.
[02:42:31.353 --> 02:42:33.675]  First up to them, they're thinking this is a good thing.
[02:42:34.155 --> 02:42:39.758]  Next thing you know, they wake up and all they see is a picture of them next to a naked child.
[02:42:39.778 --> 02:42:41.960]  And they're going to write what they're told to write.
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:53.787]  So that's why most of the media is controlled by deep state is because most of the people who are in media, they're not actually into children, but they've been compromised and exposed by deep state and they've been set up.
[02:42:53.847 --> 02:42:54.287]  That's right.
[02:42:54.348 --> 02:42:55.568]  Let's explain how this works.
[02:42:55.588 --> 02:42:56.429]  Let's explain how this works.
[02:42:56.449 --> 02:42:57.389]  None of this from their sources.
[02:42:57.449 --> 02:42:58.830]  And historically, this has happened.
[02:42:58.850 --> 02:42:59.731]  It's been documented.
[02:43:02.375 --> 02:43:05.778]  Look what followers they are, not even wanting to be attacked by the media.
[02:43:06.098 --> 02:43:09.982]  Can you imagine when they learn they got tricked into having sex with a 16-year-old girl?
[02:43:10.542 --> 02:43:13.505]  Or they got drugs and they brought in, you know, naked toddlers or whatever?
[02:43:13.525 --> 02:43:17.889]  Or, you know, had a toddler chained up and they're in the room with it?
[02:43:18.349 --> 02:43:19.490]  Can you imagine?
[02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:22.493]  They say, I'll do anything you ever want.
[02:43:22.913 --> 02:43:25.115]  And that's all about domination and control.
[02:43:25.415 --> 02:43:28.118]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in one of his books, I think it was the Technotronic Era,
[02:43:29.144 --> 02:43:29.885]  I've read a bunch of them.
[02:43:30.586 --> 02:43:32.387]  He admitted we control organized crime.
[02:43:32.648 --> 02:43:33.448]  That is the deep state.
[02:43:33.849 --> 02:43:35.250]  We control the pedophiles.
[02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:36.191]  He said we control it all.
[02:43:36.552 --> 02:43:38.874]  Because, oh, then we can control it and keep it small.
[02:43:39.515 --> 02:43:40.075]  What a lie.
[02:43:40.155 --> 02:43:43.659]  They're the ones that have proliferated it because it's their control system.
[02:43:43.999 --> 02:43:51.427]  And so that's why they're normalizing pedophilia in the news, normalizing it in the media, because they want to get more people into it so they have more compromised people.
[02:43:52.685 --> 02:43:57.870]  Right, and all they did when they went after you and went after me, and they don't understand how people like you and I think.
[02:43:58.350 --> 02:44:01.313]  They don't understand that I know that we are at war and I will die.
[02:44:01.333 --> 02:44:02.955]  I will die for the truth.
[02:44:02.975 --> 02:44:05.957]  So I don't care if some stupid articles they write about me.
[02:44:06.017 --> 02:44:08.780]  Right now the whole media, they think they're having... All they do is make us bigger.
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:09.421]  They don't get it.
[02:44:09.701 --> 02:44:11.983]  And I don't care if they, quite frankly, I don't care if I get sued now.
[02:44:12.403 --> 02:44:13.204]  I really thought about it.
[02:44:13.264 --> 02:44:14.105]  Great depositions.
[02:44:14.145 --> 02:44:14.625]  Full war.
[02:44:14.645 --> 02:44:15.246]  Let's go.
[02:44:15.506 --> 02:44:16.027]  I'm not kidding.
[02:44:16.067 --> 02:44:16.807]  It's not, I'm ready.
[02:44:16.827 --> 02:44:17.188]  Let's go.
[02:44:17.228 --> 02:44:17.548]  Let's go.
[02:44:17.588 --> 02:44:17.908]  Let's go.
[02:44:17.928 --> 02:44:18.209]  Let's go.
[02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:19.741]  No, exactly.
[02:44:20.121 --> 02:44:21.982]  I put a bunch of money in a trust fund.
[02:44:22.423 --> 02:44:23.944]  My daughter has a trust fund.
[02:44:24.484 --> 02:44:26.566]  You know, Shauna, my wife, has a trust fund.
[02:44:26.926 --> 02:44:27.326]  Whatever.
[02:44:27.346 --> 02:44:28.327]  They can come after me.
[02:44:28.387 --> 02:44:29.408]  You know, good luck with that.
[02:44:29.548 --> 02:44:36.853]  I want them to sue me because I'm going to depose everybody who ever went, that they're friends with, everybody that they emailed with.
[02:44:37.294 --> 02:44:38.815]  I'm going to be at every deposition.
[02:44:39.175 --> 02:44:40.636]  I'm going to send them interrogatory.
[02:44:40.656 --> 02:44:41.637]  Discovery.
[02:44:42.017 --> 02:44:46.240]  That's why you haven't been sued and I haven't been sued because I want to be sued.
[02:44:46.361 --> 02:44:47.141]  Let them sue me.
[02:44:47.241 --> 02:44:47.401]  I know.
[02:44:48.342 --> 02:44:54.491]  Well, PSYOP experts, high level, that have run successful operations, they said, what genius, how you've done this to trick them into suing.
[02:44:54.511 --> 02:44:55.673]  And I said, no, that's not what happened.
[02:44:55.693 --> 02:44:57.395]  And they go, well, you better hope they do.
[02:44:57.415 --> 02:44:58.838]  And I don't know why I'm even saying that now.
[02:44:58.858 --> 02:45:01.161]  Maybe because then they'll think I really am scared, so whatever.
[02:45:01.401 --> 02:45:03.504]  You know, the point is, is that I'm just doing the right thing.
[02:45:03.965 --> 02:45:05.806]  And regardless, Mike, we've got to get you on more often.
[02:45:05.846 --> 02:45:06.406]  God bless you.
[02:45:06.426 --> 02:45:07.566]  Dangerinplay.com.
[02:45:08.126 --> 02:45:09.667]  Hey, Susan Rice has come out.
[02:45:09.687 --> 02:45:10.587]  We've got the clip coming up.
[02:45:10.947 --> 02:45:14.409]  She's admitted that she basically did do the spying, but says she did nothing wrong.
[02:45:14.809 --> 02:45:20.311]  So they've got a big problem on their hands in the last 24 hours, saying you were a big fat liar, Mike.
[02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:23.131]  Yeah, let them keep hating, man.
[02:45:23.151 --> 02:45:26.453]  We're committed to the truth, and they're never going to compromise us.
[02:45:26.593 --> 02:45:27.073]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:45:27.093 --> 02:45:27.473]  You're a hero.
[02:45:27.964 --> 02:45:28.804]  No, you're a hero, brother.
[02:45:28.844 --> 02:45:29.705]  DangerInPlay.com.
[02:45:29.725 --> 02:45:31.586]  You can get your whistleblower and go there.
[02:45:31.646 --> 02:45:32.286]  Go to InfoWars.
[02:45:32.306 --> 02:45:33.466]  We've got a great crew in there as well.
[02:45:33.606 --> 02:45:34.587]  Don and all the rest of the crew.
[02:45:35.047 --> 02:45:35.687]  Get everybody else.
[02:45:35.707 --> 02:45:36.348]  Mikael Thelen.
[02:45:36.368 --> 02:45:37.308]  Just get in there.
[02:45:38.529 --> 02:45:39.149]  Kellan McBrain.
[02:45:39.209 --> 02:45:39.729]  All our writers.
[02:45:39.769 --> 02:45:40.249]  Paul Watson.
[02:45:40.289 --> 02:45:46.632]  Paul Watson, by the way, is going to drop the hammer on the pedophiles tonight or tomorrow with a huge investigative report that's going to send shockwaves across the internet.
[02:45:46.872 --> 02:45:49.253]  This is a guy that has videos that have had 40 million views.
[02:45:50.354 --> 02:45:51.975]  So, standby.
[02:45:52.855 --> 02:45:54.776]  Standby for main weapons system.
[02:45:56.303 --> 02:45:56.664]  Launch.
[02:45:57.545 --> 02:45:58.125]  T-minus.
[02:45:58.706 --> 02:46:00.108]  Countdown commencing.
[02:46:02.410 --> 02:46:03.011]  Yes!
[02:46:03.732 --> 02:46:04.052]  Love it!
[02:46:04.713 --> 02:46:05.053]  All right!
[02:46:05.796 --> 02:46:08.377]  Let's go to Millie Weaver, joining us from California.
[02:46:08.397 --> 02:46:09.197]  She's been all over the state.
[02:46:09.237 --> 02:46:10.358]  I'll ask her where she's at.
[02:46:10.978 --> 02:46:11.938]  Looks like LA to me.
[02:46:12.458 --> 02:46:17.780]  Investigating the admitted 474 reported pedophiles, including kids and enslavement.
[02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:19.041]  They've been to the Sheriff's Department.
[02:46:19.061 --> 02:46:20.421]  They're doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work.
[02:46:20.461 --> 02:46:21.762]  When they come back, you'll be hearing about.
[02:46:22.042 --> 02:46:25.103]  But Millie, thank you so much for sitting there for 15 minutes with Mike Cernovich.
[02:46:25.123 --> 02:46:28.344]  We got him on a little bit late, but I tell you, this is all coming together, isn't it?
[02:46:29.318 --> 02:46:29.918]  Yes it is.
[02:46:29.978 --> 02:46:31.099]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:46:31.139 --> 02:46:32.980]  You know, we're out here in California.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:40.285]  California has the highest number of reported cases of human trafficking out of all the states in the United States.
[02:46:40.305 --> 02:46:43.367]  So we're just out here investigating, seeing what we can find.
[02:46:43.407 --> 02:46:47.129]  We're going to be talking with various law enforcement agencies as well as
[02:46:47.909 --> 02:47:00.533]  Non-profit groups that actually first-hand rescue children from these sex traffickers and we're even going to be talking with someone that's going to take us into the deep web where they sell these children online.
[02:47:00.813 --> 02:47:15.897]  It's pretty disturbing but you know we have Hollywood out here we've had people like Corey Feldman come out speaking about pedophilia problems within Hollywood and there's a lot of rumors a lot of stories about massive pedophile rings amongst the Hollywood elite Alex.
[02:47:16.394 --> 02:47:17.674]  Well, there's been a lot of busts, too.
[02:47:17.714 --> 02:47:20.115]  Yeah, nearly 500 arrests in California human trafficking raids.
[02:47:20.515 --> 02:47:21.776]  They call it human trafficking on Reuters.
[02:47:21.836 --> 02:47:22.696]  It's little kids.
[02:47:23.436 --> 02:47:28.118]  28 children reported missing, kidnapped, forced into prostitution.
[02:47:28.558 --> 02:47:28.898]  OK?
[02:47:29.518 --> 02:47:30.918]  So this is confirmed.
[02:47:30.939 --> 02:47:33.759]  This is just one of over 3,000 arrests that have happened since Trump.
[02:47:33.779 --> 02:47:38.221]  I want to commend your courage and the crew, Zimmerman and others, for being out there, as well as Gavin.
[02:47:39.081 --> 02:47:45.163]  But I got to thank the listeners, the audience, our affiliates, for supporting us to be able to do this, Millie.
[02:47:46.018 --> 02:47:56.741]  Yeah, well thank you listeners out there that are funding this because we're actually being able to really investigate, go and expose these pedophile networks out there.
[02:47:56.801 --> 02:48:05.123]  I mean, just being told a little bit with our anonymous source about the way they sell these children online, some of the gruesome stuff.
[02:48:05.163 --> 02:48:07.023]  I mean, we're not going to actually be showing any of that.
[02:48:07.043 --> 02:48:13.745]  We're not going to be seeing it firsthand, but we will take you guys in and show the websites where they're in fact
[02:48:14.526 --> 02:48:17.948]  The dark web, the dark web, and you're gonna obviously blur out his face.
[02:48:17.988 --> 02:48:22.112]  This is a respected person that's actually saved folks, involved with good folks in the federal government.
[02:48:22.432 --> 02:48:27.096]  I gotta tell you though, the special forces, the good people in the FBI, CIA, they're all ready to go.
[02:48:27.116 --> 02:48:30.679]  I mean, Trump has green-lighted a move against these people.
[02:48:30.939 --> 02:48:31.780]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:48:32.992 --> 02:48:34.712]  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty disturbing.
[02:48:34.852 --> 02:48:37.293]  Anyone would get motivated to want to try and stop this.
[02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:43.194]  And you know, Alex, if good men just turn the blind eye and they don't do anything, then evil will triumph.
[02:48:43.574 --> 02:48:44.714]  That's just what happens.
[02:48:45.074 --> 02:48:49.395]  So more people need to get out there and start, you know, going out and trying to fight this.
[02:48:49.435 --> 02:49:01.597]  And that's why we're going to be talking with law enforcement so that they can give us tips on signs to look for and how to report these type of situations when you see a child or a young girl or boy that you think is being trafficked.
[02:49:02.771 --> 02:49:04.032]  Absolutely, and you've got a lot.
[02:49:04.052 --> 02:49:08.636]  You've got a person that has been involved in finding child traffickers, pedophiles on the dark web or deep web.
[02:49:09.097 --> 02:49:12.059]  And we have another report, L.A., that goes directly to rescued victims.
[02:49:12.099 --> 02:49:12.820]  Also work with L.A.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:13.581]  County Sheriff's Department.
[02:49:13.941 --> 02:49:14.642]  Tell me about that.
[02:49:14.682 --> 02:49:15.162]  What's going on?
[02:49:15.182 --> 02:49:16.143]  I'm talking to the Sheriff's Department.
[02:49:16.977 --> 02:49:26.039]  Well, as far as talking with the Sheriff's Department, they've actually been very reciprocative and helping us go ahead and set up interviews.
[02:49:26.099 --> 02:49:40.163]  They've actually seemed pretty excited about getting that message out there and having more people hear from them that they really are fighting this and that they want to give people tips on how to stop this, which would lead to more busts for them.
[02:49:40.223 --> 02:49:43.984]  Because a lot of times what happens is these children or these young girls
[02:49:44.444 --> 02:49:47.266]  They are too afraid to come forward and say something themselves.
[02:49:47.306 --> 02:49:53.909]  A lot of them will actually defend their traffickers because they're afraid these traffickers threaten their families.
[02:49:53.929 --> 02:49:55.150]  Yeah, Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:56.010]  Yes, exactly.
[02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:58.092]  They are terrified to come forward.
[02:49:58.352 --> 02:50:05.536]  So it actually is going to require your everyday citizens on the street paying attention to what's going on around them.
[02:50:05.596 --> 02:50:07.857]  I mean, if you see some young girl with some
[02:50:08.297 --> 02:50:10.480]  That's right, because people don't want to believe...
[02:50:26.659 --> 02:50:28.280]  You don't want to believe this is going on.
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:30.461]  And young girls, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[02:50:30.501 --> 02:50:32.082]  That's the visible area to get into the networks.
[02:50:32.102 --> 02:50:32.822]  We need to save them.
[02:50:33.182 --> 02:50:34.923]  But we're talking about young children.
[02:50:35.363 --> 02:50:36.924]  We're talking about snuff films.
[02:50:36.964 --> 02:50:38.204]  We're talking about Satanism.
[02:50:38.224 --> 02:50:40.205]  I know you guys are investigating that as well.
[02:50:40.225 --> 02:50:46.488]  I don't want to tip off what you're doing there on that front, but I want to get some basic info straight ahead with Millie Weaver on the other side.
[02:50:48.726 --> 02:50:58.291]  In the 30 minutes of the fourth hour on the day the night takes over, I have the former SEAL team leader and Patriot federal officer, Craig Sawyer, joining us.
[02:50:58.311 --> 02:51:01.173]  He wants to lead this private task force to cover all this.
[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:07.402]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[02:51:07.642 --> 02:51:13.043]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[02:51:13.343 --> 02:51:18.245]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[02:51:18.545 --> 02:51:20.225]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[02:51:20.486 --> 02:51:22.586]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[02:51:22.886 --> 02:51:23.506]  See guidelines.
[02:51:23.827 --> 02:51:26.907]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[02:52:02.301 --> 02:52:06.244]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S.

[02:53:01.954 --> 02:53:12.517]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:53:12.797 --> 02:53:16.719]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:53:16.959 --> 02:53:18.779]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:19.119 --> 02:53:24.561]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:24.721 --> 02:53:34.486]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:53:34.706 --> 02:53:40.950]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:44.471]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:53:44.491 --> 02:53:46.332]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:53:46.572 --> 02:53:49.514]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:53:49.694 --> 02:53:51.815]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:53:56.236 --> 02:53:57.076]  That's Russian techno.
[02:53:57.136 --> 02:53:58.276]  See, total proof that we're Russians.
[02:54:21.019 --> 02:54:28.024]  Oh my gosh, Eric Prince of Blackwater met with the Russians to discuss a way to cut off Iran and ask them to join the United States Coalition.
[02:54:28.544 --> 02:54:29.205]  Can't have that!
[02:54:29.925 --> 02:54:30.566]  It's treason!
[02:54:30.586 --> 02:54:36.650]  I'm going back to Billy Weaver in a moment for this segment and the next and then my next guest joins us.
[02:54:38.024 --> 02:54:56.170]  By the way, we sold out of the fluoride-free Made in America by the biggest company out there, private label for us, fluoride-free with iodine and nano-silver, as well as tea tree oil and, of course, the peppermint we sold out of the adult formula.
[02:54:56.190 --> 02:54:57.771]  But this is the child's formula.
[02:54:59.431 --> 02:55:01.152]  Exactly the same, but with no peppermint.
[02:55:01.172 --> 02:55:05.593]  It has the tea tree oil, it has the iodine, it has the nano-silver.
[02:55:06.874 --> 02:55:07.374]  Super blue.
[02:55:08.643 --> 02:55:13.924]  And I told my dad when he designed it, he's a dentist and oral surgeon, I said, but it's painting, it's the same thing, it turns blue.
[02:55:13.944 --> 02:55:16.465]  He said, it's got real iodine in it, it turns grayish blue.
[02:55:16.485 --> 02:55:17.505]  I said, okay.
[02:55:18.345 --> 02:55:20.006]  But that's the label he designed, too.
[02:55:20.046 --> 02:55:21.226]  It's a bestseller, everybody loves it.
[02:55:21.626 --> 02:55:23.127]  I mean, at least the last one was, it sold out.
[02:55:23.167 --> 02:55:24.287]  This is the child's formula.
[02:55:24.587 --> 02:55:28.568]  Because we had a lot of people with the first run, you know, eight, nine months ago, we've had like five or six runs now.
[02:55:29.904 --> 02:55:31.485]  Say, uh, this is really strong.
[02:55:31.505 --> 02:55:32.986]  Well, it is twice concentrated.
[02:55:33.006 --> 02:55:34.147]  It is concentrated form.
[02:55:34.167 --> 02:55:35.047]  That's how we want it.
[02:55:35.067 --> 02:55:35.708]  It's real strong.
[02:55:35.728 --> 02:55:36.749]  It doesn't have any fillers in it.
[02:55:36.769 --> 02:55:38.069]  It's totally natural.
[02:55:38.370 --> 02:55:38.750]  Organic.
[02:55:39.630 --> 02:55:41.352]  So, uh, this is great for your children.
[02:55:42.192 --> 02:55:42.792]  It's $9.95.
[02:55:42.913 --> 02:55:46.135]  Infowarsandlife.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:55:46.915 --> 02:55:53.660]  When you sign up for the free newsletter today, you'll get 50% off the Good Halogen X2 Nation Iodine.
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:55:59.326]  That is selling out, then we have more shipments about to be produced, but then that may be it for this formulation.
[02:55:59.446 --> 02:56:06.155]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you we've had problems getting more of it, and we're the only folks who get the deep earth source.
[02:56:06.175 --> 02:56:08.378]  Everybody else makes it out of kelp, it's just not the same thing.
[02:56:08.779 --> 02:56:12.263]  Iodine gets bound in with other substances, and then it doesn't get delivered to the body.
[02:56:13.171 --> 02:56:15.912]  That's why everybody should get extra today and support the broadcast.
[02:56:16.313 --> 02:56:20.035]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:20.435 --> 02:56:25.738]  Millie Weaver, getting back to your Satanism investigation, because there's political control in this.
[02:56:26.781 --> 02:56:29.942]  And personal power for those involved, but you grew up in LA.
[02:56:29.962 --> 02:56:33.543]  I don't know how much you want to get into it, but you grew up witnessing all this.
[02:56:33.603 --> 02:56:40.284]  I mean, I remember when you were, you know, in TV shows and stuff, you know, like four or five years ago and doing, you know, a reporting force out in LA.
[02:56:40.624 --> 02:56:44.585]  You're still now young, 24 years of age, but you know, you're working for Infowars.
[02:56:44.605 --> 02:56:46.685]  But what's the inside baseball on this?
[02:56:47.005 --> 02:56:53.767]  I know you guys are investigating serious Satanism without saying names at major institutions in Los Angeles.
[02:56:54.659 --> 02:56:54.939]  Yes.
[02:56:55.039 --> 02:56:56.179]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:56:56.399 --> 02:57:03.821]  And the problem is, is that we have a lot of these cults, these satanic cults that are rampant in Hollywood.
[02:57:03.881 --> 02:57:13.284]  I mean, there are so many different types of these cults, but one of the most prominent ones is OTO, which is Ordo Templi Orientalis.
[02:57:13.604 --> 02:57:22.326]  It's an Aleister Crowley satanic occult, and it has members in it that are celebrities, that are people in high positions of power,
[02:57:22.486 --> 02:57:25.249]  Really, it's a league of dumbasses acting like they have secret knowledge.
[02:57:25.970 --> 02:57:33.059]  Yes, and you know they want people to join their cult group prior to
[02:57:34.290 --> 02:57:35.091]  Thank you.
[02:58:04.350 --> 02:58:10.073]  So, what happens is when they have people join their group, they engage in these bizarre rituals.
[02:58:10.093 --> 02:58:11.774]  These Aleister Crowley rituals.
[02:58:11.794 --> 02:58:14.976]  Well, remember Bob Dylan said he sold his soul to the devil for power.
[02:58:14.996 --> 02:58:16.197]  He said he wasn't joking.
[02:58:16.217 --> 02:58:17.077]  And was it Taylor Swift?
[02:58:17.097 --> 02:58:17.798]  They all say that.
[02:58:19.218 --> 02:58:30.985]  The devil of these people convinced them that their talents came from the devil, so that if they just sell to the devil, they'll have power, when all they're doing is believing the fraud when their own talent got them where they were.
[02:58:32.133 --> 02:58:34.376]  I mean, that's the greatest thing, and I'm one of the people here.
[02:58:34.676 --> 02:58:35.657]  Happened to Mark Dice, too.
[02:58:35.998 --> 02:58:41.004]  But I just knew it was all a big joke, and so we're a thousand times more powerful not joining them.
[02:58:41.385 --> 02:58:45.510]  Back in 70 seconds for our number four, we'll finish up with Millie, and then the Saw Man.
[02:58:46.451 --> 02:58:49.435]  Oh, with the biggest intel on PedoGate yet.
[02:58:49.655 --> 02:58:51.037]  Everybody needs to tune in now.
[02:58:53.121 --> 02:59:00.908]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:01.108 --> 02:59:07.514]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:07.754 --> 02:59:16.041]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:16.301 --> 02:59:25.074]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:25.334 --> 02:59:31.083]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:31.403 --> 02:59:31.884]  It works.
[02:59:32.184 --> 02:59:40.471]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:59:40.511 --> 02:59:50.079]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:59:50.399 --> 02:59:51.600]  A total 360 win.
[02:59:55.043 --> 02:59:57.626]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.599 --> 03:00:10.223]  It's day 74 of President Trump.
[03:00:11.123 --> 03:00:12.644]  Globalism is in flames.
[03:00:13.745 --> 03:00:14.966]  But evil is rallying.
[03:00:15.547 --> 03:00:18.049]  From enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:00:18.709 --> 03:00:20.370]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.551 --> 03:00:28.717]  Billy Weaver is on the ground in Los Angeles overlooking the fetid hell of the New World Order.
[03:00:28.957 --> 03:00:30.138]  The place where dreams die.
[03:00:31.832 --> 03:00:33.293]  It's the big South by Southwest.
[03:00:33.833 --> 03:00:34.434]  The big car.
[03:00:35.334 --> 03:00:36.035]  The big line.
[03:00:36.255 --> 03:00:36.835]  Satanism.
[03:00:37.296 --> 03:00:40.738]  Give me your will and I'll give you the knowledge.
[03:00:41.899 --> 03:00:44.120]  But only knowledge of twisted failure.
[03:00:45.141 --> 03:00:46.882]  Not the knowledge of the stars.
[03:00:47.783 --> 03:00:49.183]  But we'll call you stars.
[03:00:51.045 --> 03:00:52.306]  Because you're the opposite of stars.
[03:00:54.107 --> 03:00:56.688]  You've got the dead shark eyes of a great white.
[03:00:58.069 --> 03:00:58.750]  All right, Millie.
[03:01:00.532 --> 03:01:03.435]  Let's get into what else you're on the trail of.
[03:01:04.596 --> 03:01:08.139]  Well, you know, more on to the Aleister Crowley stuff.
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:17.888]  They believe in harvesting the energy of children, so when they're doing these things like raping these children or torturing them, they feel that they're harvesting their energy.
[03:01:18.208 --> 03:01:25.635]  We're actually going to be going and getting exclusive access to these manuals where they have detailed descriptions on how to
[03:01:26.275 --> 03:01:31.318]  Essentially, blood let these children and drink their blood and steal their energy.
[03:01:31.598 --> 03:01:35.661]  These elite actually believe that it will make them live longer.
[03:01:35.961 --> 03:01:47.508]  So part of it is, in essence, vampirism to where they believe that they're going to live longer, they're going to be more powerful, have more psychic powers and all this delusional stuff.
[03:01:47.568 --> 03:01:52.371]  I wonder what powers I get if I take a ball-peen hammer to one of the convicted people's heads.
[03:01:53.632 --> 03:01:53.992]  Yeah.
[03:01:54.833 --> 03:02:00.038]  I bet most of the listeners out there are feeling the same way right now, Alex, as I describe this stuff.
[03:02:00.098 --> 03:02:03.401]  And you know, it's really not that fun to get into.
[03:02:03.482 --> 03:02:05.183]  It's not fun to have to hear about.
[03:02:05.243 --> 03:02:07.165]  But at the same time, this is going on.
[03:02:07.205 --> 03:02:08.046]  This is happening.
[03:02:08.166 --> 03:02:08.807]  It's real.
[03:02:09.227 --> 03:02:15.173]  And this is what is making it so that our politicians and our public figures out there are being compromised.
[03:02:15.393 --> 03:02:18.558]  And you're also investigating how this ties into Sharon Tate and her murder.
[03:02:18.919 --> 03:02:20.521]  That was all spirit cooking admittedly.
[03:02:20.561 --> 03:02:21.943]  So you're there.
[03:02:21.963 --> 03:02:24.587]  That was a CIA operation that's been partially declassified.
[03:02:24.868 --> 03:02:27.312]  So you guys have got the motherlode when you come back.
[03:02:27.612 --> 03:02:28.393]  We're very excited.
[03:02:28.614 --> 03:02:29.956]  What else are you on the trail of, Millie?
[03:02:31.563 --> 03:02:32.524]  We're just on the trail.
[03:02:32.544 --> 03:02:37.026]  We're going to go down to Irvine, where recently a human trafficking bust happened.
[03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:45.950]  It was with a bunch of girls that were mostly from China and Korea, where they were being shipped around from state to state.
[03:02:46.050 --> 03:02:57.376]  And it's traced back to Irvine, California, a really nice neighborhood, where in fact a mom and her daughter were the ones kind of ring-leading the whole thing with a group of other people.
[03:02:58.057 --> 03:03:00.678]  They were just basically trafficking these young girls
[03:03:01.378 --> 03:03:06.860]  Unbelievable.
[03:03:07.961 --> 03:03:21.987]  And I love how men commit mostly outright murders, but so many times it's the little loving woman, the little baking cookies and stuff, and then there's a, you know, meanwhile a dungeon.
[03:03:22.884 --> 03:03:29.866]  Yeah, I mean, we have madams out there that have been famously caught trafficking young women.
[03:03:30.786 --> 03:03:32.587]  But, you know, it goes both ways.
[03:03:32.887 --> 03:03:34.627]  It's not just only a thing with men.
[03:03:34.827 --> 03:03:35.147]  That's right.
[03:03:35.187 --> 03:03:37.788]  And then this Irvine thing is, they've been accused of it.
[03:03:37.828 --> 03:03:38.668]  The police are saying this.
[03:03:38.688 --> 03:03:39.588]  They say they have the evidence.
[03:03:40.489 --> 03:03:46.010]  But, you know, look at how Hillary pretty much exclusively represented pedophiles when she was a lawyer.
[03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:48.731]  That was to prove to the system how evil she was.
[03:03:50.094 --> 03:03:52.141]  Because the word is Hillary's not into kids, she's into women.
[03:03:52.201 --> 03:03:52.823]  Okay, whatever.
[03:03:53.164 --> 03:03:56.355]  But you've still got to serve this combine to be part of the club.
[03:03:57.679 --> 03:04:08.267]  Well, recently three university students were arrested for prostitution and I have a video report just out on the Alex Jones YouTube channel that we just uploaded today.
[03:04:08.707 --> 03:04:15.973]  And actually, one of these young prostitutes that was arrested, her Facebook profile picture was her with Bill Clinton.
[03:04:16.373 --> 03:04:21.517]  So, there's just another example of the Clintons kind of having these odd ties to prostitution.
[03:04:21.557 --> 03:04:23.539]  Well, Jerry Epstein, yeah, absolutely, beyond that.
[03:04:24.319 --> 03:04:26.482]  Well, girl, picture of Bill Clinton arrested in a prostitution bust.
[03:04:26.502 --> 03:04:27.903]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[03:04:28.284 --> 03:04:29.065]  Just now breaking.
[03:04:29.105 --> 03:04:33.569]  Millie Weaver, you, Gavin Zimmerman, all you guys, feel free to file reports in your own right.
[03:04:33.589 --> 03:04:34.470]  We want to hear from them as well.
[03:04:34.771 --> 03:04:41.658]  We'll check in with you each day, Millie, but don't let the live show get in the way of the really deep reporting you guys are doing.
[03:04:41.678 --> 03:04:42.199]  So be safe.
[03:04:42.219 --> 03:04:43.000]  We're praying for you, Millie.
[03:04:43.661 --> 03:04:43.961]  Awesome.
[03:04:43.981 --> 03:04:44.622]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:44.862 --> 03:04:45.202]  You bet.
[03:04:45.662 --> 03:04:46.042]  All right.
[03:04:46.062 --> 03:04:48.343]  Straight ahead, the saw man, Craig Sawyer.
[03:04:49.224 --> 03:05:01.210]  Field team leader, Patriot, Dev Group, Hole 9 Yards, Stars and 3 TV Shows, and two others, Patriot launching the national movement to document the pedophile rings, the busts that are already happening with big intel.
[03:05:01.230 --> 03:05:01.670]  Straight ahead.
[03:05:02.847 --> 03:05:13.094]  Well, I can't figure out why we haven't gone to war with Russia yet, especially after hearing the words of Senator Mark Warner talking about the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Trump-Russia collusion.
[03:05:13.415 --> 03:05:22.101]  There were upwards of thousands of paid Internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia, in effect taking over a series computers which are then called a botnet.
[03:05:22.501 --> 03:05:26.804]  That can then generate news down to specific areas, Warner said.
[03:05:27.004 --> 03:05:31.826]  This actually kind of sounds like Tolkien fantasy, because if you look at who the queen of the trolls is, it's Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:32.067 --> 03:05:43.253]  In fact, her Clinton super PAC, Correct the Record, spent $1 million on project Breaking Barriers to pay people to respond to negative information about Clinton on social media sites like Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and Twitter.
[03:05:43.453 --> 03:05:45.474]  That amount grew as large as $6 million.
[03:05:45.754 --> 03:05:47.635]  And who was the head of this operation?
[03:05:47.995 --> 03:05:50.075]  Media Matters and David Brock.
[03:05:50.536 --> 03:05:53.817]  And Clinton's use of trolls went as far back as 2007.
[03:05:54.057 --> 03:05:59.079]  If you want to find an army of trolls that would make Sour Man proud, then go to the Democratic Party.
[03:05:59.239 --> 03:06:02.180]  Rob Dury reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:02.737 --> 03:06:08.044]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:08.205 --> 03:06:10.107]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:06:10.288 --> 03:06:15.334]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:15.595 --> 03:06:19.340]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:22.622]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:06:22.883 --> 03:06:25.945]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:06:26.065 --> 03:06:29.728]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:06:29.948 --> 03:06:36.993]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:06:37.113 --> 03:06:42.497]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:06:42.657 --> 03:06:43.778]  Let's go to Deben in Florida.
[03:06:43.838 --> 03:06:45.179]  Deben in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:07:09.028 --> 03:07:09.408]  Great!
[03:07:09.488 --> 03:07:10.469]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:07:10.609 --> 03:07:14.992]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:07:15.152 --> 03:07:16.713]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:07:16.833 --> 03:07:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:07:24.277 --> 03:07:25.238]  Wow, thank you.
[03:07:25.278 --> 03:07:27.539]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:07:27.559 --> 03:07:29.220]  Which Nutraceuticals do you like best?
[03:07:29.460 --> 03:07:32.782]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:07:32.942 --> 03:07:33.302]  That's amazing.
[03:07:33.322 --> 03:07:33.982]  That's really incredible.
[03:07:34.202 --> 03:07:37.244]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:07:37.264 --> 03:07:38.525]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[03:07:38.625 --> 03:07:40.205]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:07:40.285 --> 03:07:41.406]  And I love the guys.
[03:07:41.426 --> 03:07:42.947]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:07:43.687 --> 03:07:50.390]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:51.351]  You will love it.
[03:07:51.591 --> 03:07:53.392]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[03:07:53.692 --> 03:07:58.074]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:58.134 --> 03:07:58.874]  It's a win-win.
[03:07:59.014 --> 03:08:00.055]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:15.722]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:16.663 --> 03:08:21.625]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.858 --> 03:08:26.880]  Alright, this is how much I'm working.
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:28.362]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[03:08:29.503 --> 03:08:45.419]  I went 30 minutes into David Knight's time, and then I called in a famous Special Forces operator who had already told me about this stuff like a year ago, who's been involved in a bunch of operations, and I can't get into names, just to confirm a lot of the other stuff we're working on.
[03:08:46.892 --> 03:08:49.414]  And then he's sitting there in my office, and then he made the joke, though.
[03:08:49.434 --> 03:08:51.396]  I'm not going to tell you everything, Alex, because you can't help it.
[03:08:51.416 --> 03:08:53.938]  You're going to blabber no matter what, even though you say you're not giving up sources.
[03:08:54.638 --> 03:09:01.243]  The point is, there's a whole war against these pedophiles going on, and just the giant trafficking, and the 3,000 plus arrests, and all of it.
[03:09:01.784 --> 03:09:06.047]  So I'm going to give Craig Sawyer the floor in the next 12 minutes.
[03:09:07.488 --> 03:09:10.570]  And then I'm going to have David Knight come in here for another six, seven minutes and ask his questions.
[03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:11.190]  I'm going to be gone.
[03:09:11.210 --> 03:09:13.371]  I've got to go literally walk in here on this other meeting.
[03:09:14.351 --> 03:09:14.952]  But I know this.
[03:09:14.972 --> 03:09:16.412]  The president wants to go after these people.
[03:09:16.472 --> 03:09:16.993]  It's happening.
[03:09:17.553 --> 03:09:18.553]  It's really scaring them.
[03:09:18.573 --> 03:09:20.514]  We've got our reporters out in the field in California.
[03:09:21.455 --> 03:09:31.199]  But Craig Sawyer, a former Navy SEAL, contractor, federal officer, you name it, Discovery History Channel show, you name it, he has been aware of this.
[03:09:31.239 --> 03:09:32.380]  His sources are aware of this.
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:37.986]  But instead of just rescuing the people or getting the cops with 3,000 busts, there needs to be coverage.
[03:09:38.446 --> 03:09:39.928]  The missing link is coverage.
[03:09:40.008 --> 03:09:43.252]  And then I get my other source sitting in the room next door, a great guy.
[03:09:43.272 --> 03:09:46.075]  He's like, yeah, but Alex, then that tells them how we're getting them.
[03:09:46.215 --> 03:09:49.819]  I know, but we need to then expose it to bring it all down.
[03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:51.441]  So I'm not saying I have all the answers.
[03:09:52.222 --> 03:09:55.803]  What is the alchemy that brings those two together?
[03:09:56.084 --> 03:09:59.465]  The InfoWar proving document, just like we did with Susan Rice.
[03:09:59.925 --> 03:10:04.927]  That just happened through our great work of Patriots and other things we're working on.
[03:10:06.485 --> 03:10:09.547]  Because if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, it doesn't make a sound.
[03:10:09.647 --> 03:10:12.169]  I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right here.
[03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:14.051]  We're all moving in the right direction.
[03:10:14.831 --> 03:10:18.113]  I never give up sources, but at the same time, we've got to tell them we're coming for them.
[03:10:18.314 --> 03:10:20.855]  They already know we're coming for them, and that's why Craig Sawyer joins us.
[03:10:21.316 --> 03:10:25.139]  He got big hits from his intel sources, obviously, and agencies across the board.
[03:10:25.899 --> 03:10:29.180]  We've got people self-identifying, panicking, so this is a big day.
[03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:33.282]  Craig, wow, just the last five, six days, all hell's breaking loose.
[03:10:33.582 --> 03:10:35.402]  They're really scared of you and others in your team.
[03:10:35.422 --> 03:10:37.003]  Let's tell folks what's been unfolding.
[03:10:38.463 --> 03:10:47.406]  Well, I gotta admit, I'm flattered that such big groups are that concerned about little old me and my team.
[03:10:47.907 --> 03:10:51.868]  And all we're about is exposing that which has been so successfully
[03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:54.449]  Suppressed for so long.
[03:10:54.749 --> 03:11:13.057]  So yeah, a high-level source of mine said that the internet chatter right now is since I launched the the organization to help expose this pedophilia ring going on nationwide, globally actually, but we're focused here in the United States.
[03:11:13.917 --> 03:11:20.320]  There's two specific groups already out there freaking out, panicking, worried about me and what I bring, which is exposure.
[03:11:21.541 --> 03:11:23.743]  And looking to discredit us.
[03:11:23.763 --> 03:11:28.807]  So they got three initial things that they want to come at us for.
[03:11:28.847 --> 03:11:30.589]  And it's not a surprise.
[03:11:30.629 --> 03:11:33.171]  We knew that this would be par for the course.
[03:11:33.211 --> 03:11:38.255]  We anticipated and expected this as standard, to be honest with you, in the political realm.
[03:11:40.196 --> 03:11:43.079]  But the first thing they want to do is discredit our
[03:11:44.225 --> 03:11:48.728]  Our crowdfunding or our funding, whichever method we do.
[03:11:49.289 --> 03:11:51.650]  And then they want to bring legal attacks, whatever that may be.
[03:11:51.691 --> 03:11:57.535]  And then they want to smear me, bring false, slanderous attacks against me.
[03:11:57.575 --> 03:11:59.116]  So I say, hey, bring it, man.
[03:11:59.276 --> 03:12:00.957]  That's what we signed up for.
[03:12:00.997 --> 03:12:01.618]  This is coming.
[03:12:01.978 --> 03:12:02.798]  We're not going to shut up.
[03:12:02.838 --> 03:12:05.220]  We're not the kind of guys that get scared and go away, man.
[03:12:06.201 --> 03:12:09.944]  I surrounded myself by guys that I've known for a long time that are anything but scared.
[03:12:10.004 --> 03:12:10.984]  So we're ready.
[03:12:11.084 --> 03:12:11.585]  Come what may.
[03:12:12.185 --> 03:12:17.426]  And all we want to do again is expose the harm to children that has been kept quiet.
[03:12:18.006 --> 03:12:18.626]  Let me say this.
[03:12:18.706 --> 03:12:28.888]  We've got a fellow here that has been involved in the rescues and things that are going on today who is going to go in public because he thinks that will give him tactics and stuff.
[03:12:28.908 --> 03:12:29.949]  I think they already know what we're coming for.
[03:12:29.969 --> 03:12:35.110]  But I'm going to have that discussion in about 10 minutes and I'm going to turn it over to you for another 10 minutes or so with David Knight.
[03:12:37.071 --> 03:12:49.567]  I heard from my friend who's here today, he heard Glenn Beck, and I checked with my source, Glenn Beck came out and said, his number one goal would be to stop pedophilia and sex slavery in America, and he's going to lead it with some group called the Underground Railroad.
[03:12:49.587 --> 03:12:50.829]  Well, I'm not going to bash that group.
[03:12:51.329 --> 03:12:52.991]  I asked my source, is that a good group?
[03:12:53.032 --> 03:12:54.473]  He goes, no, it's a total diversion.
[03:12:55.034 --> 03:12:57.355]  Now, I'm not bashing anybody that's worked with it or hasn't worked with it.
[03:12:57.375 --> 03:12:59.715]  The point is, I work with the real people that are actually involved.
[03:12:59.735 --> 03:13:05.737]  3,000 arrests, they're fining the kids, they're fining all the sex slavery, and then nothing is ever in the news after it.
[03:13:06.297 --> 03:13:11.358]  So, regardless, the point is, Glenn Beck himself represents himself as a patriot.
[03:13:11.398 --> 03:13:14.939]  He always comes in to take over anything we're doing so he can then discredit it later.
[03:13:15.099 --> 03:13:16.819]  And I'm not going to bash Glenn on every front.
[03:13:17.119 --> 03:13:18.900]  Maybe he's decided to stop being a bad guy.
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:20.400]  Maybe Underground Railroad's great.
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:26.921]  All I can tell you is the people I'm working with, and Craig Sawyer and others, most of them unnamed, are 100% on target.
[03:13:26.941 --> 03:13:31.462]  And I just asked my other source, because I thought I'd call him in, because I heard about this from, again, a year ago, six months ago.
[03:13:31.782 --> 03:13:33.043]  He was going on missions all over the world.
[03:13:33.483 --> 03:13:34.623]  I said, is Craig Sawyer good?
[03:13:34.643 --> 03:13:35.743]  He goes, oh, absolutely, of course.
[03:13:36.163 --> 03:13:41.144]  So the point is, we're just vetting all of this because, you know, the fact is, the enemy's got infiltrators in here.
[03:13:42.765 --> 03:13:48.386]  Yeah, that's one of their tactics, you know, the classic honeypot technique and other
[03:13:49.068 --> 03:13:49.228]  I think?
[03:14:07.069 --> 03:14:08.411]  That's a real threat to what they're doing.
[03:14:08.431 --> 03:14:09.692]  So what can they do?
[03:14:10.133 --> 03:14:16.980]  All they can do is run around, you know, throwing smoke and trying to divert and distract and hide.
[03:14:17.401 --> 03:14:18.983]  But this time it's not going to go away.
[03:14:19.183 --> 03:14:20.144]  There's no place to hide.
[03:14:20.184 --> 03:14:21.005]  We're going to bring this.
[03:14:21.065 --> 03:14:27.172]  We've got a president that'll back us, a DOJ that'll back us, that's not all about pedophilia for once.
[03:14:27.952 --> 03:14:33.074]  And it looks like we've got everything that we need, minus the funding.
[03:14:33.094 --> 03:14:37.016]  The funding's coming, and we appreciate everybody that's rallying behind us.
[03:14:38.396 --> 03:14:45.419]  But our thing, and we're not competing with any of the other groups out there for how many bus or territory or anything like that.
[03:14:45.779 --> 03:14:48.620]  What my organization is about is exposure.
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:52.301]  And we can coordinate with and even assist the other units.
[03:14:52.501 --> 03:14:53.121]  No, I totally agree.
[03:14:53.181 --> 03:14:54.362]  So what we're about is telling the tale.
[03:14:54.702 --> 03:14:57.765]  In fact, I didn't bring up this other group, England-Beck, because I don't know them.
[03:14:57.785 --> 03:14:59.406]  I just know Beck's a bad actor.
[03:14:59.746 --> 03:15:04.030]  And then the other group I mentioned to somebody, and they go, oh my God, absolutely, just a total diversion.
[03:15:04.050 --> 03:15:06.352]  I'm not saying they're bad, they just are all talk.
[03:15:07.513 --> 03:15:09.515]  But then I asked my other sources, I said, well, is he a Craig Riggins?
[03:15:09.535 --> 03:15:10.175]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:15:10.936 --> 03:15:13.898]  All I'm getting is, we just, it's not about who donates money where.
[03:15:14.238 --> 03:15:15.118]  I'm not making any money off this.
[03:15:15.158 --> 03:15:16.639]  I'm giving my money, you're giving your money, Craig.
[03:15:16.659 --> 03:15:19.801]  It's all about funding this operation to do the final missing link.
[03:15:19.861 --> 03:15:20.321]  Exactly.
[03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:26.985]  You have the law enforcement, military ready to cover it, ready to show you the findings when it's not getting covered by media, when the bust happened.
[03:15:27.365 --> 03:15:31.388]  We're about bringing real sunshine to this, proving how widespread it is.
[03:15:31.708 --> 03:15:36.390]  And I know you can't get into sources and methods and things, but I mean, let's talk about this type of stuff we're witnessing.
[03:15:36.771 --> 03:15:38.131]  I mean, you wouldn't get into it Sunday.
[03:15:38.151 --> 03:15:39.092]  Can you tell people a little bit?
[03:15:41.764 --> 03:15:56.191]  Well, again, we don't want to let them know too much about what we're doing, what's going on, but we're watching and we've got access to federal and local law enforcement to observe and participate in what's going on and, again, tell it to the American public.
[03:15:56.251 --> 03:16:08.617]  And the reason we are striking such fear into the hearts of the two groups specifically that are panicking right now at the launch of Veterans for Child Rescue.
[03:16:08.637 --> 03:16:09.398]  Can we say that name?
[03:16:11.465 --> 03:16:13.406]  Well, one is the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:16:14.906 --> 03:16:17.487]  Now, they self-identify.
[03:16:17.987 --> 03:16:22.448]  I never mentioned the Muslim Brotherhood as we're going after them because we're not going after them.
[03:16:22.488 --> 03:16:25.389]  We're going after those who harm children.
[03:16:26.129 --> 03:16:30.770]  And we know that there are people that do that that are in just about every group.
[03:16:31.310 --> 03:16:36.476]  And then the other is the head of one of our major political parties.
[03:16:37.077 --> 03:16:37.777]  So do the math.
[03:16:37.857 --> 03:16:40.781]  Which political party has no moral standards?
[03:16:41.021 --> 03:16:46.627]  Which political party booed the name of God out of their convention campaign and so forth?
[03:16:46.647 --> 03:16:48.549]  So it's not hard to figure out.
[03:16:49.287 --> 03:16:52.049]  And I'm not out to start a war with any political party.
[03:16:52.109 --> 03:16:53.470]  But they declared war on us.
[03:16:53.490 --> 03:16:54.550]  I don't care where they are.
[03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:56.191]  We're going to expose them no matter who they are.
[03:16:56.371 --> 03:16:59.593]  People are asking me, Saul, are you just going to go after the low-level guys?
[03:16:59.713 --> 03:17:00.814]  And absolutely not, man.
[03:17:00.834 --> 03:17:02.635]  We're going to go after the biggest fish there are.
[03:17:02.975 --> 03:17:04.056]  That's the whole idea.
[03:17:04.756 --> 03:17:05.657]  Otherwise, why bother?
[03:17:05.957 --> 03:17:06.877]  It's not worth my time.
[03:17:09.299 --> 03:17:11.700]  Look, if we can save one child, it's worth all of us.
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:13.281]  Yeah, but we need to cut the head off a snake.
[03:17:13.961 --> 03:17:14.922]  We need to cut the head off a snake.
[03:17:16.243 --> 03:17:16.523]  Yes, sir.
[03:17:16.863 --> 03:17:18.123]  Yep.
[03:17:18.604 --> 03:17:26.706]  And I think part of it, too, is just inspiring the American people to realize, hey, look, we, the American patriot, are still the overwhelming majority.
[03:17:26.766 --> 03:17:32.927]  We, the basically moral decent Judeo-Christian American, are still the overwhelming majority.
[03:17:32.947 --> 03:17:36.408]  We hold the power, and we hold the will, and we hold the numbers.
[03:17:36.608 --> 03:17:39.069]  So let us no longer sit back and be quiet.
[03:17:39.589 --> 03:17:44.333]  And just allow this to happen to the youth, what I call the soul of our nation.
[03:17:44.933 --> 03:17:46.915]  They're doing this on a widespread basis.
[03:17:46.955 --> 03:17:48.776]  They're attacking our children.
[03:17:49.076 --> 03:17:53.179]  They're shattering the little kids' lives, and it's horrible.
[03:17:53.460 --> 03:17:55.501]  And so I ask people to make a decision.
[03:17:55.521 --> 03:18:03.347]  Either you are for harming children, toddlers and infants, and torturing them to death, or you are against that.
[03:18:04.148 --> 03:18:06.369]  It's easy to decide which side of this you're on.
[03:18:06.749 --> 03:18:10.291]  So no longer can you sit back and go, I don't know, this is just a sexual deviancy.
[03:18:10.331 --> 03:18:11.191]  Some people prefer this.
[03:18:11.511 --> 03:18:13.372]  The child does not prefer this.
[03:18:13.432 --> 03:18:14.633]  The child cannot get away.
[03:18:14.973 --> 03:18:19.655]  The child cannot say, I decline and I want to go outside because I don't like being tortured.
[03:18:19.695 --> 03:18:22.056]  I'm in pain and I don't want to die tonight.
[03:18:22.096 --> 03:18:25.038]  I don't want to be raped anymore because I'm two years old.
[03:18:26.599 --> 03:18:29.380]  A child doesn't have the power to speak for themselves.
[03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:31.721]  So we, the people, have to speak for them.
[03:18:32.121 --> 03:18:35.302]  So that's why my organization needs the backing of the American public.
[03:18:35.322 --> 03:18:35.882]  Well, I've given $10,000.
[03:18:35.942 --> 03:18:37.263]  I'm going to write a check.
[03:18:37.963 --> 03:18:38.243]  I've given $10,000.
[03:18:38.343 --> 03:18:39.344]  I'll give a check for $90,000.
[03:18:39.604 --> 03:18:41.985]  Tomorrow I'm going to send that off with a memo.
[03:18:42.305 --> 03:18:43.005]  For the film.
[03:18:43.325 --> 03:18:44.125]  For the releases.
[03:18:44.145 --> 03:18:45.906]  A film we put on the internet for free for everybody.
[03:18:46.306 --> 03:18:49.389]  I'm going to have you come back and host six more minutes by yourself.
[03:18:49.409 --> 03:18:51.932]  David Donnell traffic cop that he's gonna come back and finish up hosting the Craig.
[03:18:51.972 --> 03:18:52.332]  Great job.
[03:18:52.352 --> 03:18:53.493]  Give out the website.
[03:19:08.368 --> 03:19:15.491]  I'm not rolling in money, but everything I've got is for the Children because I've got three Children about to have a fourth child and.
[03:19:25.194 --> 03:19:25.955]  It's all about life.
[03:19:26.375 --> 03:19:29.897]  It's all about committing, and I know how real this is, and I know the President is concerned.
[03:19:29.917 --> 03:19:33.780]  It's almost 70,000 there, 50 on the other, and I'm going to give another 90.
[03:19:33.860 --> 03:19:36.902]  Everybody should donate at gunfund.me.
[03:19:37.262 --> 03:19:40.325]  All right, Craig Sawyer, you come back with David Knight and host another segment.
[03:19:40.725 --> 03:19:42.726]  I'm going to punch out and go work on this in the back room.
[03:19:42.766 --> 03:19:44.287]  It's just a total war here.
[03:19:44.748 --> 03:19:46.229]  So, listeners, thanks for all your support.
[03:19:46.269 --> 03:19:48.610]  Pray for us, because the enemy is pissed.
[03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:49.531]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:49.531 --> 03:19:49.972]  This is an InfoWar.
[03:20:03.294 --> 03:20:13.861]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:14.161 --> 03:20:18.064]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:18.324 --> 03:20:20.125]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:20.465 --> 03:20:25.909]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:26.069 --> 03:20:35.834]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:36.074 --> 03:20:42.298]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:42.538 --> 03:20:45.839]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:45.859 --> 03:20:47.680]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:47.920 --> 03:20:50.862]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:51.042 --> 03:20:53.164]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:22:04.265 --> 03:22:08.787]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[03:22:09.308 --> 03:22:10.689]  But they don't know Harry's.
[03:22:11.329 --> 03:22:12.089]  How's Harry's done it?

[03:24:13.087 --> 03:24:14.528]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.588 --> 03:24:17.230]  I'm David Knight and we still have on the line Craig Sawyer.
[03:24:17.350 --> 03:24:18.991]  In this last five minutes, we're going to go to Craig.
[03:24:19.031 --> 03:24:19.852]  I want to give him time.
[03:24:19.872 --> 03:24:20.933]  We're not going to do a plug or anything.
[03:24:20.973 --> 03:24:24.075]  I just want Craig to break this down, where this is going.
[03:24:24.135 --> 03:24:29.719]  As you heard in the last segment, he pointed out that there is now organized opposition to him coming from the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:24:30.559 --> 03:24:32.701]  A political party, leaders in a political party.
[03:24:33.081 --> 03:24:37.525]  So I want to just let Craig break this down as to what the state of this is.
[03:24:37.786 --> 03:24:40.148]  And I didn't hear the beginning of the interview.
[03:24:40.308 --> 03:24:45.352]  Craig, I don't know if you have an address yet that's out public that people can donate to.
[03:24:45.452 --> 03:24:49.015]  I know I've had a lot of people contact me on Twitter wanting that information.
[03:24:49.075 --> 03:24:52.058]  So if you've got that, it's a good time to give that out.
[03:24:52.078 --> 03:24:52.478]  There we go.
[03:24:52.498 --> 03:24:53.079]  I see it up there now.
[03:24:53.746 --> 03:24:54.527]  We do.
[03:24:54.607 --> 03:24:57.209]  It's on our website.
[03:24:57.749 --> 03:25:05.815]  This is the funding page, but on our website, vets4childrescue.org, there's all the new mailing information.
[03:25:05.935 --> 03:25:10.918]  So if somebody wants to do that, rather than go through the online, they're welcome to that now.
[03:25:11.359 --> 03:25:11.859]  Great.
[03:25:11.899 --> 03:25:14.921]  And that's very important because, as we saw, first we had GoFundMe.
[03:25:15.341 --> 03:25:18.684]  So they didn't want to, basically, were non-responsive to everything.
[03:25:18.724 --> 03:25:20.045]  You got on with you caring.
[03:25:20.625 --> 03:25:26.190]  And then as you came on with Alex Jones last week, within an hour or two they completely shut you down.
[03:25:26.691 --> 03:25:31.375]  But let's talk about what you want to talk about, where this goes from here, what you're seeing right now.
[03:25:31.395 --> 03:25:31.736]  Go ahead.
[03:25:32.574 --> 03:25:48.148]  Yeah, well, it's interesting with our counterintel and other assets out there picking up on the chatter from high-level sources on the internet, seeing who's self-identifying as scumbags who harm children.
[03:25:48.168 --> 03:25:53.613]  We're after saving the children from predators, from those who rape and murder them.
[03:25:54.133 --> 03:26:03.637]  And it's interesting to see two groups specifically respond to that and assume it's all about them and even formulating their attacks against our org.
[03:26:03.657 --> 03:26:08.960]  So I'm like, man, if I'm a threat to the bad guys, I'm very honored and I'm very proud of that.
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:10.981]  I'm ready to tie into it right now.
[03:26:11.061 --> 03:26:14.623]  So as soon as you start talking about child abuse, I say, you're talking about me?
[03:26:14.803 --> 03:26:15.503]  You're talking about me?
[03:26:15.723 --> 03:26:17.204]  I mean, that's kind of self-identifying, isn't it?
[03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:17.904]  It's so telling.
[03:26:17.964 --> 03:26:22.446]  I'm like, OK, well, thanks for revealing your position on that.
[03:26:23.106 --> 03:26:26.668]  Thanks for telling the American public where you stand on children.
[03:26:26.828 --> 03:26:28.129]  You hate the children.
[03:26:28.149 --> 03:26:29.229]  You want to attack the children.
[03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.949]  OK, noted.
[03:26:30.790 --> 03:26:34.731]  Now, as far as the operations, what we're looking to do with the
[03:26:36.696 --> 03:26:37.737]  The exposure piece.
[03:26:37.877 --> 03:26:47.128]  I want all law enforcement out there to know that we are not out to expose your specific techniques or our specific techniques.
[03:26:47.388 --> 03:26:48.509]  We are going to tell the story.
[03:26:48.549 --> 03:26:52.414]  We're going to show a little bit about what goes on because what we need to do is bring the public in on it.
[03:26:52.814 --> 03:26:56.895]  People need to kind of see what's happening that they're not seeing on the mainstream media.
[03:26:56.915 --> 03:27:02.097]  We need to show them a little bit more of the truth of what's going on day-to-day, night-to-night out there.
[03:27:02.117 --> 03:27:07.138]  But we are not looking to compromise any operational security or undermine any operations.
[03:27:07.158 --> 03:27:13.180]  Look, I'm a federal criminal investigator myself and a counter-terrorist operator from the highest level.
[03:27:13.220 --> 03:27:14.480]  So I understand OPSEC.
[03:27:15.301 --> 03:27:16.001]  We're your ally.
[03:27:16.141 --> 03:27:20.002]  So in case, and I haven't gotten any of that, but in case anybody ever
[03:27:21.134 --> 03:27:23.034]  Uh, add any concerns.
[03:27:23.254 --> 03:27:25.375]  Hey, we're we're for the good guys.
[03:27:25.675 --> 03:27:26.095]  Very important.
[03:27:26.115 --> 03:27:30.096]  Yeah, you're not going to compromise any ongoing investigations or tactics.
[03:27:30.436 --> 03:27:31.876]  Yeah, that's that's our background.
[03:27:31.896 --> 03:27:33.596]  That's that's what makes us tick, man.
[03:27:33.636 --> 03:27:35.797]  So we just want to protect the kids.
[03:27:35.857 --> 03:27:47.579]  And I think any decent human being that's not insane or has not like deliberately done some weird thing where they've sold their soul to the devil can agree that we should not be torturing our infants to death.
[03:27:48.439 --> 03:27:49.699]  So if you know.
[03:27:50.399 --> 03:27:55.823]  But of course, we've seen this when we look at it in the UK, and we look at the case of Seville.
[03:27:56.483 --> 03:28:05.369]  And what was happening was we saw people at lower levels of Scotland Yard open up multiple investigations of him, and then they were shut down by the higher-ups.
[03:28:05.569 --> 03:28:07.090]  And the same thing happened at the BBC.
[03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:12.214]  As soon as the guy died, people knew what was going on, they did a documentary, and then the higher-ups at the BBC shut it down.
[03:28:12.554 --> 03:28:14.215]  So that's what we're going against.
[03:28:14.275 --> 03:28:20.019]  It isn't the rank-and-file people, they see this, they're offended by this, but it's the people at the upper levels that shut this down.
[03:28:20.899 --> 03:28:33.602]  Yeah, well it's the weak who abuse their authority and it's the weak who resort to this kind of desperate caper or scheme to try to gain power in this world.
[03:28:33.622 --> 03:28:35.422]  It's disappointing.
[03:28:35.842 --> 03:28:42.624]  It would be laughable except for the victims who are very real and the absolute torture and torment that so many
[03:28:43.144 --> 03:28:44.386]  Children are enduring.
[03:28:44.786 --> 03:28:57.140]  So when I have exposed and blown the whistle on federal crooks in the past out of practical necessity, what I saw in the process is that the exposure is what they feared most.
[03:28:57.180 --> 03:28:58.642]  That is what they could not control.
[03:28:59.202 --> 03:29:08.211]  They had friends across the federal government that were crooks that would allow them to do whatever they were doing, but they didn't control those who were going straight to the media.
[03:29:08.311 --> 03:29:09.793]  So I'm like, aha, I see you.
[03:29:09.813 --> 03:29:11.494]  I see how you crooks function.
[03:29:11.534 --> 03:29:22.425]  I see what shakes your pathetic little coward carcass right to the bone as exposure because what you're doing is so despicable and unacceptable that you can't bear to have it known.
[03:29:22.485 --> 03:29:23.386]  So we're going to make it known.
[03:29:23.786 --> 03:29:26.767]  That's right, you've got to shine the shine light on these cockroaches.
[03:29:27.087 --> 03:29:27.747]  That's very important.
[03:29:27.767 --> 03:29:31.068]  Give out that website one more time where people can make contributions.
[03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:36.210]  It is vets4childrescue.org.
[03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:37.010]  Very good.
[03:29:37.130 --> 03:29:39.811]  And that's where people can go directly to contribute to this.
[03:29:40.191 --> 03:29:40.611]  Very important.
[03:29:40.631 --> 03:29:42.512]  Thank you so much, Craig Sawyer, for your efforts.
[03:29:42.652 --> 03:29:45.133]  And that's a very important thing for people to get behind.
[03:29:45.173 --> 03:29:48.134]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you how they're trying to normalize this.
[03:29:48.194 --> 03:29:52.515]  We have a window here to shut this down, expose it, or they're going to normalize it in society.
[03:29:53.462 --> 03:29:55.067]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:58.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:05.292]  Mainstream media threw a fit on Monday.
[03:30:05.533 --> 03:30:19.447]  Independent journalist Mike Cernovich outed Susan Rice, who was Obama's national security advisor, as the person who requested the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates' names in the months leading up to the election, all the way up until Trump's inauguration.
[03:30:19.587 --> 03:30:22.010]  This, of course, was turning out to be the biggest story of the day.
[03:30:22.190 --> 03:30:22.911]  So what happened?
[03:30:23.051 --> 03:30:25.053]  Later in the afternoon, we got The Manufactured.
[03:30:25.273 --> 03:30:29.357]  Blackwater found secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin backchannel.
[03:30:29.598 --> 03:30:35.944]  That's right, Trump-Putin backchannel could be found in thousands of articles, all released within two hours of each other.
[03:30:36.144 --> 03:30:43.652]  And they claim that Eric Prince of Blackwater was having secret meetings at an Indian Ocean island with Russia to set up a secret backchannel with Putin.
[03:30:46.115 --> 03:30:57.112]  The proof we do have are the NSA request logs with Susan Rice's name all over them, which is asking for the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates so she, Obama, and others could spy on them.
[03:30:57.753 --> 03:31:00.818]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:32:02.660 --> 03:32:07.964]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:08.124 --> 03:32:10.025]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:10.226 --> 03:32:15.269]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:15.509 --> 03:32:19.272]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[03:32:19.372 --> 03:32:22.554]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:22.814 --> 03:32:25.856]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:25.976 --> 03:32:29.638]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:29.878 --> 03:32:36.922]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:37.022 --> 03:32:42.425]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:32:42.685 --> 03:32:44.566]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[03:32:44.726 --> 03:32:52.769]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.

[03:33:06.484 --> 03:33:08.285]  I've been everywhere, man.
[03:33:08.525 --> 03:33:10.386]  Across the deserts there, man.
[03:33:10.566 --> 03:33:12.448]  I breathe the mountain air, man.
[03:33:12.708 --> 03:33:14.669]  I travel like I had my share, man.
[03:33:15.009 --> 03:33:16.250]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.330 --> 03:33:16.991]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:17.011 --> 03:33:19.132]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:33:19.472 --> 03:33:24.776]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:24.796 --> 03:33:30.079]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.300 --> 03:33:32.681]  Alright, and I'm David Knight, and we're gonna...
[03:33:34.402 --> 03:33:40.209]  Go to some news about the Rice Affair and how it's being handled and spun in the media.
[03:33:40.229 --> 03:33:44.434]  Of course, we're going to detail this and a great deal in the 3 to 5 broadcast.
[03:33:44.454 --> 03:33:45.936]  I'm going to be with Owen Schroyer today.
[03:33:45.956 --> 03:33:53.264]  We're going to talk about her appearance earlier today on MSNBC to try to spin what really is
[03:33:54.265 --> 03:33:55.826]  This is spinning out of control, folks.
[03:33:55.866 --> 03:33:57.547]  They're not going to be able to contain this.
[03:33:58.388 --> 03:34:01.729]  This is really turning into a Watergate type of issue.
[03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:08.834]  As I titled the coverage last night on the InfoWars Nightly News, I said, this is Obama getting his Nixon on.
[03:34:08.914 --> 03:34:11.275]  And this thing is unraveling exactly like that.
[03:34:11.315 --> 03:34:14.357]  It's absolutely amazing how the parallels to this.
[03:34:14.777 --> 03:34:15.397]  We're going to get to that.
[03:34:15.437 --> 03:34:17.098]  But I want to put a book in on this.
[03:34:18.119 --> 03:34:19.460]  What we're talking to Craig Sawyer.
[03:34:20.521 --> 03:34:23.362]  About his investigation and exposure of what's going on in pedophilia.
[03:34:23.382 --> 03:34:25.983]  Because we have to expose what's going on.
[03:34:26.043 --> 03:34:29.024]  We have to make this real for the public.
[03:34:29.264 --> 03:34:35.606]  They have to understand how this is going on, how this is being covered up by those who are in power.
[03:34:36.446 --> 03:34:37.466]  And we have to do this quickly.
[03:34:37.987 --> 03:34:40.287]  Because what they're doing is they're normalizing this.
[03:34:40.307 --> 03:34:45.209]  You know when we talk about the Overton window, where you get people accustomed to something and you make something the new normal?
[03:34:46.377 --> 03:34:48.439]  Well, there's an article on New American today.
[03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:51.763]  UN LGBT czar.
[03:34:52.143 --> 03:34:56.207]  Yeah, they have a czar for LGBT issues at the UN.
[03:34:56.928 --> 03:34:58.790]  And he's talking about indoctrinating children.
[03:34:58.830 --> 03:35:01.012]  And this is what he said on Argentinian television.
[03:35:01.473 --> 03:35:03.395]  He said, the younger, the better.
[03:35:04.565 --> 03:35:05.706]  And they point out the New American.
[03:35:05.746 --> 03:35:06.547]  This is an article today.
[03:35:06.587 --> 03:35:13.092]  They said pro-family groups hoping the UN would quit pushing gender confusion on children under the new UN Secretary.
[03:35:13.132 --> 03:35:14.894]  Guterres are going to be very disappointed.
[03:35:15.234 --> 03:35:19.938]  He's using taxpayer resources to push indoctrination to schools worldwide, especially on young children.
[03:35:20.398 --> 03:35:30.547]  Simultaneously, the UN is helping to wage a global war on religious liberty, much of it in the guise of protecting LGBT activists from quote-unquote stigma and discrimination.
[03:35:31.536 --> 03:35:36.061]  Now they say that this guy was in Argentina, and here's what he had to say.
[03:35:36.681 --> 03:35:39.444]  He said, uh, it's very important to start working with young people.
[03:35:40.025 --> 03:35:41.106]  The younger, the better.
[03:35:41.627 --> 03:35:50.055]  With a politics that amplify empathy for vulnerable populations such as LGBTI people can be, and I, I, now they've added a new one.
[03:35:50.196 --> 03:35:51.417]  I'm not sure what I means.
[03:35:51.597 --> 03:35:52.238]  Oh, intersex.
[03:35:52.378 --> 03:35:53.018]  Okay, whatever.
[03:35:54.680 --> 03:35:59.963]  I'm sure this is starting to get, as Anthony Cumia once said, he said, it's starting to get like Star Trek.
[03:36:00.283 --> 03:36:03.265]  We have so many different imaginary genders that are coming up here.
[03:36:03.945 --> 03:36:08.608]  And then they put in here, they say, for perspective, here's what the American College of Pediatrics has said.
[03:36:09.348 --> 03:36:21.635]  They say, quote, conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.
[03:36:22.415 --> 03:36:23.175]  It's child abuse.
[03:36:23.435 --> 03:36:25.416]  And they're normalizing this in public opinion.
[03:36:25.436 --> 03:36:26.816]  They're moving the Overton window.
[03:36:26.836 --> 03:36:34.537]  So if we don't get these kind of investigations, like Craig Sawyer is working on, if we don't expose what is truly at the root of this, this is where this is headed.
[03:36:35.257 --> 03:36:37.778]  They're continually moving this down, the younger the better.
[03:36:38.398 --> 03:36:42.459]  Saying that young people in elementary school can make these kind of gender decisions.
[03:36:42.499 --> 03:36:44.219]  How many times have you seen an article about that?
[03:36:44.599 --> 03:36:50.540]  Where the parents say, oh, we're so happy that our child believes that they are the opposite sex, or whatever.
[03:36:51.334 --> 03:36:56.219]  That is all about removing the idea that we have consenting adults making these types of decisions.
[03:36:56.997 --> 03:37:13.690]  As I point out in this article, speaking about priorities for government, this LGBT czar, for the UN, said that authorities must advance in education, this is a quote, advance in education, activities in secondary schools, initiatives that integrate sexual diversity inside the school system.
[03:37:13.710 --> 03:37:21.557]  But they point out that when they talk about sexual diversity, what they're talking about is everything from homosexuality to bestiality to gender confusion to pedophilia.
[03:37:22.317 --> 03:37:24.879]  That's their sexual, it has no end, folks.
[03:37:25.600 --> 03:37:30.723]  It has no end, because they want to legitimize what they have been doing in secret.
[03:37:31.123 --> 03:37:34.446]  That's why we need to expose what they have been doing in secret.
[03:37:35.306 --> 03:37:42.491]  And as the New American has pointed out many times, they're using school textbooks to promote homosexuality, gender confusion, and sexual diversity.
[03:37:43.464 --> 03:37:48.627]  But folks, this is child abuse, as the American College of Pediatrics has pointed out.
[03:37:49.147 --> 03:37:50.087]  It is child abuse.
[03:37:50.187 --> 03:37:52.288]  It is psychological child abuse.
[03:37:52.528 --> 03:38:00.092]  It is physical child abuse to condition these kids to take drugs, to have surgical impersonations of the opposite sex.
[03:38:00.372 --> 03:38:01.713]  But how are they moving against this?
[03:38:01.773 --> 03:38:05.655]  They have another article that was up yesterday talking about what's going on in Canada.
[03:38:06.235 --> 03:38:12.238]  Canada is a good example of how they're trying to censor any speech about what is going on with this.
[03:38:12.278 --> 03:38:19.922]  The Canadian Parliament is considering a gender identity bill, C-16, that could have dangerous free speech implications.
[03:38:19.942 --> 03:38:27.606]  The bill seeks to add gender identity and gender expression to Canada's protected classes listed in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
[03:38:28.602 --> 03:38:36.208]  And opponents fear that it will censor any talk about gender dysphoria as mental illness.
[03:38:36.408 --> 03:38:39.411]  So they're going to shut down anything that you have to say about this.
[03:38:40.151 --> 03:38:41.332]  They don't want to argue with you.
[03:38:41.652 --> 03:38:46.054]  Just as we saw with the Planned Parenthood demonstration that InfoWars got involved with.
[03:38:46.614 --> 03:38:48.575]  As we showed up there, there were protesters out there.
[03:38:48.595 --> 03:38:49.695]  We showed up, started filming it.
[03:38:50.496 --> 03:38:56.819]  They show up with black signs to put over the other signs because they don't want to argue their side.
[03:38:56.859 --> 03:38:59.160]  They don't want to argue that this is something legitimate.
[03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:01.161]  They just want to shut down your speech.
[03:39:01.201 --> 03:39:03.642]  And so that's what Canada is proposing to do here.
[03:39:04.804 --> 03:39:08.766]  Now I'm going to talk about what's going on in politics, but real quickly, we haven't done any plugs this hour.
[03:39:09.186 --> 03:39:16.130]  I want to read for you our review of the day on Brain Force Plus, which by the way is 25% off at InfoWars Live right now.
[03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:17.470]  This is from Matthew.
[03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:19.972]  He said, I try it, support the broadcast.
[03:39:19.992 --> 03:39:20.712]  You can't really lose.
[03:39:20.732 --> 03:39:22.073]  He said, I take two pills in the morning.
[03:39:22.553 --> 03:39:24.334]  I am nearly through my second bottle.
[03:39:24.414 --> 03:39:26.315]  Seems to have lifted the fog, so to speak.
[03:39:26.815 --> 03:39:31.378]  I wake up early, I work relatively long hours, so any mental boost helps.
[03:39:31.498 --> 03:39:34.160]  More importantly, I'm helping to support the broadcast.
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:34.921]  Exactly right.
[03:39:34.961 --> 03:39:42.146]  That's, I said, my two favorite products that I use here at InfoWars are Brain Force and toothpaste.
[03:39:42.246 --> 03:39:52.172]  And of course, we have just gotten back, not only have we gotten back in stock some of the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, but we have it in the Bubble Gum flavor at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:39:52.232 --> 03:39:54.014]  And again, a way to fight gum disease.
[03:39:55.277 --> 03:40:08.941]  Because it has iodine and nano silver in it, that helps to keep your mouth fresh, get rid of the bacteria that can create gum disease, and the gum disease that can cause you to lose your teeth and have heart disease.
[03:40:09.061 --> 03:40:16.743]  Heart attacks, blood clots, other issues that's been documented to be a symptom, a very serious symptom of gum disease.
[03:40:17.043 --> 03:40:23.145]  And one last issue here that we've got, and that is, if you haven't signed up for the InfoWars newsletter, it's very important to do that as we see
[03:40:24.185 --> 03:40:27.167]  Social media moving to censor what we have to say here.
[03:40:27.667 --> 03:40:28.788]  Very important to sign up for that.
[03:40:28.848 --> 03:40:31.970]  You can get our information directly without any filter.
[03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:37.012]  And here's an example of types of things that you can get on daily specials as well.
[03:40:37.032 --> 03:40:42.616]  So not only do you get our information uncensored by Facebook or by Twitter,
[03:40:43.436 --> 03:40:45.878]  But you can also get specials on a daily basis.
[03:40:45.978 --> 03:40:52.844]  If you are a newsletter subscriber today, for example, you could get an X2 nascent iodine for 50% off retail.
[03:40:52.884 --> 03:40:58.149]  So these are the types of specials that you'll see that we offer to the people who sign up for our free newsletter.
[03:40:58.249 --> 03:40:59.770]  So, I mean, what's to lose there?
[03:40:59.790 --> 03:41:07.397]  You get a free newsletter, no cost, and we give you free newsletter specials on a daily basis that you can take advantage of.
[03:41:07.417 --> 03:41:09.538]  All right, let's take a quick look at
[03:41:10.399 --> 03:41:12.261]  What is going on with this Donna Rice thing?
[03:41:12.301 --> 03:41:14.463]  And I just want to... I said Donna Rice.
[03:41:14.703 --> 03:41:23.693]  You know, that's a Freudian slip there, because I've said to so many people, I think Susan Rice is going to be Obama's Donna Rice.
[03:41:23.713 --> 03:41:25.855]  And if you remember, Donna Rice was the one who took down Gary Hart.
[03:41:27.163 --> 03:41:29.164]  Uh, she didn't do it deliberately.
[03:41:29.344 --> 03:41:30.945]  It was the affair that he was having.
[03:41:30.965 --> 03:41:33.447]  And this, Gary Hart, of course, was a very charismatic senator.
[03:41:33.527 --> 03:41:37.469]  Everybody believed that he was going to be a very powerful presidential candidate.
[03:41:38.289 --> 03:41:41.411]  Uh, he was a Democrat, so everybody was saying, oh, he looks so much like Kennedy and everything.
[03:41:41.431 --> 03:41:43.372]  Well, he kind of acted like JFK as well.
[03:41:43.852 --> 03:41:47.233]  He had an affair, it took him down, and the person's name was Donna Rice.
[03:41:47.313 --> 03:41:49.834]  And it was broken by the National Enquirer.
[03:41:50.295 --> 03:41:55.276]  And all the people who want to dump on National Enquirer are like, you know, that was a very significant revelation that they had there.
[03:41:55.296 --> 03:42:04.120]  They also had an interesting revelation about Edwards that sunk his career as he was cheating on his dying wife of cancer at the time.
[03:42:04.180 --> 03:42:11.983]  Anyway, so they do have an effect and they have had a big impact as they've exposed things.
[03:42:12.603 --> 03:42:19.306]  But when I look at Susan Rice and where this is going to go, this is a very, very important thing.
[03:42:19.326 --> 03:42:27.069]  But I think it's also important, and we're going to look at this in the three to five segment as we go live, we're going to take a look at her denials today.
[03:42:30.113 --> 03:42:41.198]  Andrea Mitchell, who is the wife of Alan Greenspan, helping her out, giving her leading questions and helping her do her apology tour.
[03:42:41.218 --> 03:42:42.859]  It was kind of an interesting clip.
[03:42:42.879 --> 03:42:47.161]  So we're going to take that bit by bit and look at these revelations as where they're going.
[03:42:47.181 --> 03:42:49.562]  But first of all, I want to take a look at the language that they're using.
[03:42:50.353 --> 03:42:52.395]  We have an article up at Infowars.com.
[03:42:52.615 --> 03:42:56.798]  Tucker Carlson is saying, you know, we're monitoring these conversations.
[03:42:56.978 --> 03:42:59.120]  That is not incidental collection.
[03:42:59.801 --> 03:43:00.702]  It is spying.
[03:43:01.622 --> 03:43:03.384]  He says, let's drop the euphemisms.
[03:43:04.024 --> 03:43:12.831]  Well, one of the euphemisms that needs to be dropped as well is not just incidental collection, calling it spying, but to say that this is unmasking.
[03:43:13.832 --> 03:43:16.234]  What does it say when they say, well, they unmasked Trump?
[03:43:16.374 --> 03:43:17.836]  As they continue to do this,
[03:43:18.564 --> 03:43:26.549]  You realize that by using a term like unmask, they're implying that Trump did something wrong when they were the ones who did something wrong.
[03:43:26.909 --> 03:43:27.169]  Okay?
[03:43:27.589 --> 03:43:29.730]  It wasn't Trump who was wearing the mask.
[03:43:30.531 --> 03:43:33.452]  It was Susan Rice who was wearing the mask.
[03:43:33.673 --> 03:43:36.514]  It was the intelligence community who was wearing the mask.
[03:43:36.594 --> 03:43:39.316]  So they could break into people's private communications.
[03:43:39.696 --> 03:43:40.877]  Let's drop this euphemism.
[03:43:41.517 --> 03:43:49.399]  Every time we get into a political argument, the left always seizes the high ground by defining the terms and we foolishly buy into that.
[03:43:49.679 --> 03:43:52.640]  We talk about incidental collection, we talk about unmasking Trump.
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:53.960]  No!
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:44:01.662]  The mask was something that was put on to anonymize these things that they picked up and it was very important for them to do that.
[03:44:02.382 --> 03:44:04.382]  It was a legal requirement for them to do that.
[03:44:04.963 --> 03:44:06.263]  They broke the law.
[03:44:07.148 --> 03:44:12.491]  They broke the law, which, as far as I'm concerned, had already stretched the Constitution to the breaking point.
[03:44:13.412 --> 03:44:15.873]  And we need to have this conversation as a nation.
[03:44:15.913 --> 03:44:24.399]  We've got the apologists on the left saying, well, we don't think Donna Rice broke any laws, but some of them, like Slate said, if she broke the laws, good.
[03:44:24.599 --> 03:44:25.740]  I wanted her to spy on Trump.
[03:44:25.840 --> 03:44:27.761]  I wanted her to get dirt on her political opponents.
[03:44:28.541 --> 03:44:30.623]  Do you understand how serious this is?
[03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:37.911]  We had a very, very crude break-in at the Watergate Hotel, trying to get information on a political opponent.
[03:44:38.912 --> 03:44:40.552]  That was the basis for that whole thing.
[03:44:41.072 --> 03:44:51.414]  And then it rolled and rolled and rolled until there were lies and there were cover-ups, and then lies and cover-ups got him impeached, along with things like using the IRS against their political enemies, which the Obama administration did and got away with.
[03:44:52.255 --> 03:44:52.935]  They got away with it.
[03:44:54.555 --> 03:45:05.702]  And, you know, we look at how they targeted Tea Party groups, how they delayed their tax deductible status, how they put on super fast track the people that they liked.
[03:45:05.722 --> 03:45:13.147]  We just had an incident where they approved it in two days for one of their political allies, when for years they held it up for their political opponents.
[03:45:13.267 --> 03:45:16.149]  Not a politicized administration at all, is it?
[03:45:17.031 --> 03:45:22.734]  So when we see these types of things that Richard Nixon was impeached for, but they're on steroids, let me say something.
[03:45:22.754 --> 03:45:28.937]  This is not only like Nixon, it's like J. Edgar Hoover, who kept files on all of his political adversaries.
[03:45:29.377 --> 03:45:32.259]  You understand why they do that in Washington, don't you?
[03:45:33.159 --> 03:45:35.660]  And all he had to do was to get information on people.
[03:45:35.700 --> 03:45:38.822]  He could use it, he could twist it, he could blackmail people, and he did.
[03:45:39.262 --> 03:45:41.023]  He did blackmail people, J. Edgar Hoover.
[03:45:42.133 --> 03:45:46.996]  And so we shouldn't be allowing this kind of power to be held in Washington.
[03:45:48.197 --> 03:45:49.278]  Which president was it?
[03:45:49.298 --> 03:45:53.201]  I think it was Truman who said that he had dirt on everybody and was using it on everyone.
[03:45:54.182 --> 03:45:57.884]  He even said it and he continued to collect that information.
[03:45:59.165 --> 03:46:02.027]  We had in the 1970s the FISA Act.
[03:46:02.147 --> 03:46:02.467]  Why?
[03:46:02.528 --> 03:46:07.291]  Because we had the Church Committee hearings and we had the Pike House hearings.
[03:46:07.331 --> 03:46:08.552]  The Church was in the Senate.
[03:46:08.852 --> 03:46:09.813]  Pike was in the House.
[03:46:10.936 --> 03:46:18.121]  The Pike Committee called the NSA to testify, because at that point in time, nobody had even acknowledged that such a thing existed as the NSA.
[03:46:18.161 --> 03:46:22.984]  They were created by executive order by Truman, who should have known better.
[03:46:23.044 --> 03:46:31.871]  He had already complained about how Jagger Hoover was blackmailing everybody, so he created another group, maybe as a counter-op to what Jagger Hoover's done.
[03:46:31.891 --> 03:46:36.054]  Who knows what his real motivation was on this, but there's no oversight on this.
[03:46:36.114 --> 03:46:38.455]  These people were spying on the American public in the 1970s.
[03:46:39.736 --> 03:46:46.787]  They did a misdirection by talking about foreign assassinations and showing heart attack guns, which the left claims don't exist.
[03:46:48.533 --> 03:46:58.077]  And so they showed all of this stuff, and the result of all that, when they were spying on people and doing actual wiretaps, we used to have phones that had wires that they had to tap.
[03:46:58.637 --> 03:47:03.019]  Now we live in a wireless, warrantless world, and they don't have to do that.
[03:47:03.059 --> 03:47:04.159]  They don't have to follow the law.
[03:47:04.219 --> 03:47:11.002]  They created the FISA Act to say you're only going to be allowed to listen to foreign conversations.
[03:47:12.119 --> 03:47:16.962]  And if you pick up anything from Americans, you're going to have to hide that, you're going to have to anonymize that.
[03:47:17.823 --> 03:47:23.806]  But now they're saying, oh, well, we masked that, and so somebody unmasked Donald Trump.
[03:47:25.027 --> 03:47:32.111]  What they're doing is, they're using innuendo to insinuate that Trump and his transition team did something wrong.
[03:47:33.192 --> 03:47:35.794]  You have to understand, this is worse than guilt by association.
[03:47:36.738 --> 03:47:39.199]  This is guilt by alleged association.
[03:47:39.800 --> 03:47:40.940]  And it goes even beyond that.
[03:47:40.960 --> 03:47:51.466]  I have an article over here where Michael Hayden, who is no friend of Donald Trump, who has consistently opposed him on every issue, openly opposed him, which is another interesting thing.
[03:47:51.526 --> 03:47:52.207]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:47:53.047 --> 03:48:07.233]  That for the first time in this last election, we have had not only former intelligence heads, chiefs, but sitting intelligence chiefs come out and get involved politically and become politically active.
[03:48:07.993 --> 03:48:13.015]  I think that is an outrageous scandal in and of itself that everybody is remaining quiet about.
[03:48:13.976 --> 03:48:16.517]  If you get politically active in the military, you get dismissed.
[03:48:17.602 --> 03:48:22.145]  You're not allowed to take a political position as a active member of the military.
[03:48:22.185 --> 03:48:27.049]  But you can be Brennan and you can chime in on this and nobody does anything about it.
[03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.889]  Or Clapper.
[03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:40.038]  Or you can be somebody like Michael Hayden who has been chief of the NSA and the CIA and you can just go on a continuous speaking tour opposing a political candidate and nobody has a problem with that.
[03:48:40.578 --> 03:48:41.679]  I have a problem with that.
[03:48:42.039 --> 03:48:43.520]  Why aren't we talking about that?
[03:48:43.981 --> 03:48:46.742]  Why aren't we crafting rules to say, you do that
[03:48:47.703 --> 03:48:50.325]  And you're going to be dismissed if you're active.
[03:48:51.786 --> 03:48:54.287]  Certainly we can't do anything with somebody after they leave government.
[03:48:54.307 --> 03:48:55.808]  They have First Amendment protections.
[03:48:55.928 --> 03:49:00.151]  But Michael Hayden, who has, as I said, went on a speaking tour.
[03:49:01.272 --> 03:49:04.554]  Anybody that would listen to him, he would oppose Donald Trump on every issue.
[03:49:05.609 --> 03:49:14.154]  This is a guy who said, we don't even have to, they don't even have to be, doesn't have to be a conversation with let's say Donald Trump and somebody else.
[03:49:14.254 --> 03:49:28.902]  It could be two people abroad that mention Donald Trump because they're talking about Donald Trump and we would pick up that conversation and then they mask it and then they unmask it and then they imply that something sinister is going on with Trump.
[03:49:29.742 --> 03:49:37.808]  Remember that it was Obama and Cass Sunstein who are pushing this whole behavioral psyop on us called nudging people.
[03:49:38.248 --> 03:49:49.376]  Saying, you know, we can affect public opinion and we can give people, we can move people, nudge them to get them to do what we want to do without actually coming out and making it a flat-out mandate.
[03:49:50.257 --> 03:49:51.558]  Yeah, let's look at, there he is.
[03:49:51.658 --> 03:49:52.359]  Why nudge?
[03:49:52.439 --> 03:49:54.320]  By Cass Sunstein, the Financial Times.
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:56.662]  That was a buzzword a couple of years ago.
[03:49:57.778 --> 03:50:00.360]  Maybe, I think, maybe 2013 or something.
[03:50:01.141 --> 03:50:07.285]  Anyway, they're pushing this idea, which is basically behavioral psychological operations.
[03:50:08.286 --> 03:50:09.727]  And these people are very clever about it.
[03:50:10.067 --> 03:50:25.518]  That's why they pick the terms and say, instead of incidental collection, say, instead of spying, incidental collection, instead of saying that they are spying on people and violating the law, they say we unmasked
[03:50:26.471 --> 03:50:26.932]  So and so.
[03:50:27.673 --> 03:50:29.736]  So that's one of the things that really concerns me.
[03:50:29.776 --> 03:50:32.399]  Here's another thing that concerns me, and this is CNN's Don Lemon.
[03:50:32.419 --> 03:50:36.605]  We have an article up at Infowars.com by Don Salazar, put this up.
[03:50:37.105 --> 03:50:43.734]  And of course it's what Don Lemon said, I refuse to even report these Susan Rice revelations.
[03:50:44.778 --> 03:50:48.402]  And we're going to tell you what some of his colleagues at CNN said about this.
[03:50:49.383 --> 03:50:55.529]  They said, they put an article up on The Hill, why the Susan Rice smoking gun matters.
[03:50:56.249 --> 03:50:57.851]  Because that's what Rand Paul called it.
[03:50:57.891 --> 03:50:59.152]  He called it a smoking gun.
[03:50:59.573 --> 03:51:00.714]  It goes up the chain of command.
[03:51:01.154 --> 03:51:02.816]  This is going to be chain smoking, folks.
[03:51:02.836 --> 03:51:03.637]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:03.657 --> 03:51:04.978]  Extendivite really works.
[03:51:05.339 --> 03:51:07.501]  Just listen to what some people have to say.
[03:51:08.081 --> 03:51:13.604]  Several years ago, I was developing a very severe situation.
[03:51:13.684 --> 03:51:15.304]  I called it my flippy heart.
[03:51:16.405 --> 03:51:18.466]  It was just doing not good things.
[03:51:19.126 --> 03:51:25.429]  And I did not want to go to a medical doctor because I just knew they would give me a cover-up pill.
[03:51:25.549 --> 03:51:28.370]  I didn't want to get onto that sort of thing at all.
[03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:30.471]  When I learned it was garlic,
[03:51:31.151 --> 03:51:34.533]  And cayenne, and cayenne is a healer.
[03:51:35.194 --> 03:51:36.735]  It is a wonderful herb.
[03:51:37.315 --> 03:51:39.316]  I said, I think I'm onto something here.
[03:51:39.797 --> 03:51:41.898]  I'll tell you, I wouldn't be without it.
[03:51:42.178 --> 03:51:44.180]  It did wonderful things for me.
[03:51:44.620 --> 03:51:49.543]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[03:52:32.185 --> 03:52:36.808]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[03:52:36.968 --> 03:52:42.711]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[03:52:42.852 --> 03:52:49.295]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[03:52:49.355 --> 03:52:53.378]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[03:54:18.828 --> 03:54:20.169]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:30.195]  I want to take a look at the way CNN, different people on CNN, are looking at Susan Rice and unmasking her or helping her to keep the mask on.
[03:54:30.515 --> 03:54:31.636]  That would be Don Lemon.
[03:54:31.816 --> 03:54:38.740]  Before we do that, real quickly, I just want to remind you, because we haven't done any plugs the first half of the hour, just to remind you to sign up for our free newsletter.
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:50.542]  And an example of the types of specials that you will get along with the free newsletter that gives you direct access to news of the day from InfoWars without any filtering or censorship.
[03:54:50.882 --> 03:54:56.224]  You'll get things like today's special for our newsletter subscribers, X2 Nascent Iodine, 50% off retail.
[03:54:56.264 --> 03:54:58.664]  So that's the kind of thing that you'll see on a daily basis.
[03:54:59.024 --> 03:55:02.705]  Also, for those of you who want to go to the store and stock up on Brain Force Plus,
[03:55:03.325 --> 03:55:05.126]  That is now 25% off.
[03:55:05.606 --> 03:55:10.129]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is now in stock in the new Bubble Gum flavor.
[03:55:10.149 --> 03:55:12.050]  You'll find that also at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:12.410 --> 03:55:19.375]  And one other example that I didn't mention earlier, this is the kind of diversity of products that you're going to see at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:19.695 --> 03:55:22.797]  While supplies last, we've got a new FiberLite Fire Starter.
[03:55:23.317 --> 03:55:24.458]  And you'll find that there.
[03:55:24.538 --> 03:55:30.723]  It's one of the examples of preparedness items that you'll find at InfoWars store.
[03:55:30.763 --> 03:55:36.227]  We have a wide variety of objects and that you'll find items there that will help you to prepare for things.
[03:55:36.588 --> 03:55:38.910]  This is designed to be carried or stored.
[03:55:38.970 --> 03:55:44.134]  Everything you need comes in one four ounce metal tin that is fully waterproof sealed.
[03:55:45.034 --> 03:55:48.457]  Great item there to have when you need to start a fire.
[03:55:49.057 --> 03:55:55.102]  Not fight a fire fight, but we need to start a fire when you're camping or in a survival situation.
[03:55:55.642 --> 03:55:57.143]  Okay, so let's get back to the news.
[03:55:58.288 --> 03:56:04.593]  We've got Don Lemon saying he's not even going to talk about these Susan Rice revelations.
[03:56:05.053 --> 03:56:08.216]  He's not going to give them the dignity of even discussing them.
[03:56:08.236 --> 03:56:09.337]  He says, let's be clear about this.
[03:56:09.777 --> 03:56:13.620]  There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team was spied on illegally.
[03:56:13.941 --> 03:56:16.723]  There is no evidence that backs up the president's original claim.
[03:56:17.043 --> 03:56:26.471]  And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.
[03:56:27.032 --> 03:56:28.346]  In other words, instead of saying...
[03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:31.170]  We report, you decide.
[03:56:31.210 --> 03:56:32.851]  They will say, we'll decide not to report.
[03:56:32.871 --> 03:56:36.852]  This is the rules of Operation Mockingbird.
[03:56:36.932 --> 03:56:51.559]  The CIA opt to control the media, to control the narrative, to make sure that the, at the time, the three major networks were all talking about the same stories and all giving the same angle that came from the CIA and the government, painting the government in a positive light.
[03:56:51.579 --> 03:56:52.579]  So there's Don Lemon.
[03:56:52.699 --> 03:56:54.060]  But there are other people at CNN.
[03:56:54.380 --> 03:56:55.321]  I think it's very interesting.
[03:56:55.841 --> 03:56:57.562]  There's an editorial by
[03:56:58.562 --> 03:57:11.470]  A CNN political commentator, Kayleigh McEnany, I'm sorry, I don't know how to pronounce her name, I'm not familiar with her, but she also quotes another CNN commentator in this article that's up on the Hill.
[03:57:12.321 --> 03:57:14.682]  And she talks about the fact that Bloomberg talked about this.
[03:57:15.142 --> 03:57:16.102]  We had Bloomberg talk about it.
[03:57:16.142 --> 03:57:17.462]  We had Fox News talk about it.
[03:57:17.922 --> 03:57:21.163]  And of course it was Mike Cernovich, who we talked about earlier today.
[03:57:21.223 --> 03:57:22.783]  He was the one who originally broke this story.
[03:57:22.803 --> 03:57:24.024]  The New York Times is sitting on it.
[03:57:24.644 --> 03:57:26.024]  Don Lemon is not going to talk about it.
[03:57:26.064 --> 03:57:27.865]  But they said this is an explosive allegation.
[03:57:28.565 --> 03:57:35.666]  And this individual says that they believe that this is going to be a smoking gun, as Rand Paul calls it, that is going to go up the chain of command.
[03:57:35.726 --> 03:57:36.567]  I think that it will.
[03:57:36.587 --> 03:57:38.187]  And of course they talk about what I just mentioned.
[03:57:38.687 --> 03:57:44.159]  About how FISA was there to safeguard us from this massive surveillance state.
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:46.704]  How's that working out for you, Mr. and Mrs. Verizon?
[03:57:47.534 --> 03:57:48.595]  Do you feel any safer?
[03:57:49.015 --> 03:57:56.743]  You know, when they get your information, and they use it like we're seeing on a regular basis, you are not safer and more secure.
[03:57:57.644 --> 03:57:59.045]  I'm running out of time here.
[03:57:59.126 --> 03:58:05.752]  She goes on to say, aside from all these leaks, what crime did Flynn commit to merit the uncovering of his name?
[03:58:06.112 --> 03:58:08.695]  How was his name necessary to understand intelligence?
[03:58:08.715 --> 03:58:10.417]  The American public deserves an answer.
[03:58:10.757 --> 03:58:14.322]  Yes, we deserve to have the information there, and we deserve to have an answer.
[03:58:14.782 --> 03:58:18.347]  Also, CNN's Manu Raju reported this, and he tweeted this out.
[03:58:18.367 --> 03:58:23.373]  He said, some of the communications picked up were Trump transition officials talking about Trump's family.
[03:58:24.254 --> 03:58:26.297]  And so, why would that be picked up?
[03:58:26.917 --> 03:58:29.220]  Finally, the fact that Adam Schiff
[03:58:29.941 --> 03:58:31.522]  ...would say, we need to see these documents.
[03:58:31.562 --> 03:58:33.604]  When he was shown the documents, what did he say about them?
[03:58:34.365 --> 03:58:34.765]  Crickets.
[03:58:35.265 --> 03:58:39.289]  He just complained about the fact that it took so long for him to see the documents, but he can't say anything.
[03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:41.410]  Do you think if there was something incriminating, he would say it?
[03:58:41.791 --> 03:58:45.954]  Stay with us for another two hours, live on Facebook and social media.
[03:58:45.974 --> 03:58:49.197]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:52.679 --> 03:58:57.084]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:58:57.164 --> 03:59:08.097]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:59:08.257 --> 03:59:13.179]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:59:13.299 --> 03:59:15.821]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:59:15.881 --> 03:59:17.381]  It helps detoxify.
[03:59:17.601 --> 03:59:20.423]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:59:20.483 --> 03:59:25.225]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:59:25.245 --> 03:59:29.387]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[03:59:29.807 --> 03:59:31.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
