[00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.634]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:23.562]  It's Tuesday, August the 1st, 2017.
[00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:24.364]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:25.868]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.383]  Tonight, we're sorry, this video has been removed as a violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.
[00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:49.487]  InfoWars prepares for the YouTube ghetto as the video sharing website begins to crack down on controversial and offensive content.
[00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:59.995]  Then, President Donald Trump ends the covert Obama-era CIA program that funded a heavily armed radical jihadist in Syria.
[00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:06.700]  And now the administration is considering a military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.607]  Plus, Donald Trump scores a big win on immigration enforcement in Texas.
[00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:24.282]  However, in Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio is found guilty by a sanctuary judge and faces prison time for enforcing America's immigration laws.
[00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:35.370]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:47.424]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.656]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:55.580]  So please, secure your caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.322]  Do you remember when Matt Drudge came here to Infowars and he was speaking about the ghetto of social media?
[00:03:13.862 --> 00:03:30.632]  Well, it's looking like the ghetto, the Warsaw Ghetto, where the Nazis corralled people into one area and they were allowed to kind of operate freely for a while and then gradually the noose tightened and tightened down and that's what is happening now in the social media ghettos, especially YouTube.
[00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.902]  It's now been announced that YouTube will hide, but not remove, supremacist videos.
[00:03:36.942 --> 00:03:38.843]  Because they don't want to be accused of censorship.
[00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:43.225]  They will just hide and put behind a firewall the videos.
[00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.266]  And this is reported by The Verge.
[00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:46.647]  They think this is a very good thing.
[00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.269]  They wish that YouTube would go even further.
[00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:50.589]  Here's what they had to say.
[00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.430]  YouTube has been cracking down on extremist content over the past couple of months.
[00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.251]  Today the company is announcing some details on its progress and a few additional policy changes.
[00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:08.154]  One of the biggest, YouTube will now begin limiting the reach of videos that have controversial religious or supremacist content.
[00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:11.414]  I would say, judged by whom?
[00:04:11.674 --> 00:04:14.597]  Well, we'll get to that in a moment, of course, the usual suspects.
[00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:19.943]  But they say, but they don't strictly violate the web speech's hate speech guidelines of YouTube.
[00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:27.052]  So videos that get flagged by users, but aren't deemed to be in violation of the site's rules will still be censored.
[00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:27.772]  You understand?
[00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.695]  They may now be subject to several new restrictions.
[00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:32.877]  That includes being placed behind an interstitial.
[00:04:33.417 --> 00:04:38.761]  That means that it's going to have some kind of a warning like you would get with an X-rated video or extremely violent video.
[00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:40.563]  You really don't want to, are you sure?
[00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:42.444]  You really don't want to see this content.
[00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:46.448]  But they would also have ads be cut off from them.
[00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:54.034]  Ad revenue would be cut off and they would lose community features like comments, likes, and suggested videos.
[00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.576]  And oh, by the way, you won't be able to find these videos either.
[00:04:58.257 --> 00:04:59.437]  They'll be put behind a firewall.
[00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:00.378]  They'll be isolated.
[00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:03.778]  So it's not technically censorship, they say.
[00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.139]  But yes, it will be.
[00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:06.279]  And who will decide?
[00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:15.702]  Well, it'll be people like Snopes and Southern Poverty Law Center, maybe the DNC or Hillary Clinton or maybe Debbie Wasserman Schultz will make those kind of decisions for you.
[00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:20.023]  And when we look at their criteria that they're talking about here, controversial religious,
[00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.050]  Well, are they talking about terrorists?
[00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.531]  Because that's pretty easy to identify.
[00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:31.714]  If you've got somebody putting up terrorist videos showing beheadings and that sort of thing, YouTube and Facebook don't seem to have too much problem with those.
[00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:39.818]  But maybe extremist religious or controversial, they don't even say extremist religious, they say controversial religious.
[00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:45.921]  Do you think maybe that would be targeted towards Christians who believe in one man, one woman marriage?
[00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:47.522]  I would think so.
[00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:49.623]  That gives them an excuse to do that.
[00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:51.225]  And of course, supremacist content.
[00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.407]  We have been called white supremacists, and we're nothing of the sort.
[00:05:55.388 --> 00:06:00.072]  So this is the kind of labeling that they'll be used, and they say, it's not entirely clear.
[00:06:00.112 --> 00:06:02.634]  They say, this is Verge's take on this.
[00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:13.463]  They say, the Verge says, these are improvements over the status quo, but it's not entirely clear why YouTube isn't choosing to ban these videos outright.
[00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.303]  If they're deemed controversial enough to hide.
[00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:17.753]  Good question.
[00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:25.659]  Now, of course, The Verge is pushing them on and applauding this censorship because, of course, they're on the left side of this, as the rest of Silicon Valley is.
[00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.842]  They say, we think this strikes the right balance, said YouTube, their lawyer.
[00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:41.411]  They said, we think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints, things that are extremely offensive to them.
[00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:44.253]  And, of course, we have now a generation of people
[00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:50.587]  Who have been trained to be triggered by the most minor issues, these microaggressions.
[00:06:51.327 --> 00:07:00.032]  Our social justice warriors who have been indoctrinated their entire lives by the system are now going to be complaining about this.
[00:07:00.112 --> 00:07:06.957]  And if they complain, even if you aren't really a supremacist site, if somebody complains about that, you will still be isolated.
[00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:12.200]  They say they'll still be there, but they'll have less engagement and they'll be harder to find.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.781]  No, they'll have no engagement and you will not be able to find them.
[00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:18.003]  So that's effectively censorship.
[00:07:18.023 --> 00:07:21.024]  And they've been doing this with soft censorship.
[00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:30.990]  I know from my own personal experience, I can look at the number of views that I get on our real Alex Jones website, the Alex Jones main website.
[00:07:31.963 --> 00:07:34.045]  Versus my own videos posted somewhere else.
[00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:43.931]  I'll see ten times the number of views on a website that doesn't have two million subscribers, but maybe has tens of thousands of subscribers, and I'll see ten times the number of views.
[00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:50.016]  So we've already seen this type of soft censorship, but here's the subjective part of this.
[00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:56.760]  They say it's not entirely clear what YouTube will consider to be nearly, but not quite, a violation of its rules.
[00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:58.302]  You see how subjective that is?
[00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:00.943]  They can take down anything they wish.
[00:08:01.423 --> 00:08:03.905]  And they're working with 15 expert groups.
[00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:06.526]  People like the Anti-Defamation League.
[00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:09.888]  Of course you know it's going to be Snopes and the SPLC.
[00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:12.950]  They say they've also got an algorithm.
[00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.332]  So they can have censorship by algorithm.
[00:08:15.352 --> 00:08:17.573]  That will give them plausible deniability.
[00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:19.534]  Oh, you know, it's just a mistake in the algorithm.
[00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:23.637]  We didn't really mean to shut you down because we disagree with you politically.
[00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:26.880]  But that will really be the way that they're programming their algorithm.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.786]  And they say the EU is close to requiring companies like YouTube to block videos and incite terrorism.
[00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:34.609]  And Germany recently passed a law doing much the same thing.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.100]  Seriously?
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.580]  You think we're going to buy that?
[00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:46.423]  The police departments, the politicians are covering for the crimes that the terrorists that they bring into the EU and particularly into Germany.
[00:08:46.603 --> 00:08:53.564]  When they commit crimes, we see law enforcement there, we see the politicians covering, hiding up who is committing the crime.
[00:08:53.604 --> 00:08:55.765]  Now, we had last week
[00:08:56.425 --> 00:09:03.910]  News come out, The Intercept was talking about how Steve Bannon wanted Facebook and Google regulated like utilities.
[00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.492]  And I think this is exactly right.
[00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:22.543]  They point out in this article from The Intercept, they say tech companies like Facebook and Google have become essential elements of the 21st century life and they should be regulated as utilities, says top White House advisor Steve Bannon, according to three people who have spoken to him about the issue.
[00:09:23.484 --> 00:09:26.546]  Let's understand how they have made this argument in the past.
[00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:41.877]  We've had courts that have shut down small bakers, small photographer businesses because they had religious objections to performing their services as part of a gay wedding because they were going to be intimately involved with them or whatever.
[00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:42.938]  But that's their decision.
[00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:43.879]  But they say you can't do that.
[00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:44.980]  You have a public business.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.543]  And we heard this debated quite a bit within the Libertarian Party actually.
[00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:57.353]  It's one of the more interesting things of this last presidential cycle was this debate as to where one person's rights began and the other one's end.
[00:09:58.254 --> 00:10:04.761]  And what they said at the time, and I disagree with the court decision in that particular case, they said, no, these are public businesses.
[00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:11.192]  And they cannot discriminate in any way, shape, or form against these people who are having the services provided.
[00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:26.957]  Now, Gary Johnson tried to extend that and say, well, that's kind of like saying if you argue that these bakeries or these photographers can do that, then you're saying essentially that an electric company could refuse to give services to somebody who's part of a religious group or has a particular sexual orientation.
[00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:30.843]  No, that's not exactly true because they don't have a monopoly.
[00:10:31.103 --> 00:10:33.203]  But Google and Facebook do have a monopoly.
[00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:48.707]  And so if we're going to say that these Christian bakers have to provide services that violate their religious conscience, then we have to say that Google and Facebook cannot censor access to these very public and essential platforms.
[00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:52.388]  Because what they're doing is they are censoring the internet.
[00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:53.788]  They're censoring free speech.
[00:10:54.508 --> 00:11:00.871]  And so in that sense, we should have open and free and undiscriminated access to that.
[00:11:01.612 --> 00:11:06.134]  Bannon is pushing for treating essential tech platforms as utilities, they point out.
[00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:13.818]  They say there may be something about an online social network or a search engine that lends itself to becoming a natural monopoly.
[00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:15.319]  Well, it's not just a natural monopoly.
[00:11:16.397 --> 00:11:19.299]  Facebook and Google and YouTube are real monopolies.
[00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:27.285]  They were begun by venture capital funding from the CIA and other companies like that.
[00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:28.246]  They have pushed for this.
[00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:31.829]  They say much like a cable company or water or sewer system or railroad.
[00:11:32.549 --> 00:11:45.239]  And they point out that this creates an interesting interplay because the Obama administration and the FCC under the Obama administration have moved forward on a plan they said would regulate internet service providers as utilities.
[00:11:46.004 --> 00:11:50.948]  Meaning that they would not be allowed to slow down traffic to a site in order to pressure it into paying higher fees.
[00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:57.393]  The Trump administration is pushing to reverse that move, and so they say that complicates Bannon's message.
[00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:01.436]  Well not really, because what we're talking about here is content.
[00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:03.858]  Just having the content censored.
[00:12:04.278 --> 00:12:08.842]  So it's a different issue than charging people in different classes, charging them different rates.
[00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:11.844]  What it is saying is, we don't like your content.
[00:12:12.244 --> 00:12:26.474]  We have judged arbitrarily, and we're not even going to set out here what these exact standards are, but if we think that somebody complains about this, even if you haven't violated the rules, we're going to totally cut you off and isolate your content.
[00:12:27.154 --> 00:12:33.258]  And they point out again that for years Zuckerberg has described Facebook as a social utility.
[00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:34.900]  Folks, this is about
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:45.477]  The freedom of the internet and the freedom of speech and the free exercise, the free interchange of information between those of us who are not oligarchs.
[00:12:46.598 --> 00:12:50.700]  And this is a very, very important point that is coming across here.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.961]  So this is something we're going to have to take a look at.
[00:12:53.001 --> 00:13:03.927]  It is something that I think can be divided, but it's going to be just like the case of the intersection of rights between bakers and people who want a homosexual wedding.
[00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:09.470]  It's going to have to take some very careful consideration to see where these rights stop and where they end.
[00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.791]  But clearly, I don't think
[00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:25.004]  That an arbitrary organization, and it's interesting that when we have YouTube breaking these things down that they're always selecting as the arbiters of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable people who are on one side of the political spectrum.
[00:13:25.024 --> 00:13:28.647]  They're not even talking about having a balanced committee to look at this.
[00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:33.352]  Let's take a look at what's going on between President Trump and the dark state.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.583]  The Trump administration's report on Infowars yesterday from Mikhail Thelin.
[00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:42.265]  The Trump administration is considering military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
[00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:48.830]  One senior administration official says if we don't have the appetite to be there a long time, we should just leave.
[00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.311]  I think we should just leave.
[00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:58.757]  According to the Wall Street Journal, current and former administration officials say the White House is analyzing the implications of a scaled-back military presence in Afghanistan.
[00:13:59.517 --> 00:14:07.326]  Quote, it is a macro question as to whether the U.S., this administration, and this president are committed to staying, said a senior administration official.
[00:14:07.706 --> 00:14:10.469]  It doesn't work unless we're there for a long time.
[00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:14.333]  And if we don't have the appetite to be there for a long time, we should just leave.
[00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:15.955]  It's an unanswered question.
[00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:18.457]  Well, we have an answer to this.
[00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:20.718]  We have had a commitment to be there for a long time.
[00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:21.799]  We've been in Afghanistan.
[00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:26.801]  This war has been going on for longer than any war that we've had in American history.
[00:14:27.342 --> 00:14:29.743]  It's already there for 16 years.
[00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:30.984]  But of course we've had
[00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:35.235]  Military officials who say that we need to be there another 20 years beyond this.
[00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.836]  In other words, they don't want to leave at all.
[00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:39.178]  It has a lot to do with the resources that are there.
[00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:46.443]  Things like lithium and rare earth minerals, in addition to poppies that we use for the opium trade.
[00:14:46.463 --> 00:14:47.784]  And we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:51.847]  But this is a division between Trump and his top advisors, as the article points out.
[00:14:51.947 --> 00:14:52.548]  They're at odds.
[00:14:53.448 --> 00:15:00.675]  Trump is at odds with his senior national security officials like Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor McMaster.
[00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:06.219]  Both of them support a troop increase for what is now America's longest war already.
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.582]  A plan from McMaster calling for an additional 3,900 U.S.
[00:15:09.622 --> 00:15:19.651]  troops in Afghanistan was recently shot down during a recent National Security Council meeting due to the president being unconvinced that a troop surge would ultimately change the tide of the war.
[00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:25.814]  So the question is, they're offering a choice of either go in deep or get out all together.
[00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:30.676]  Because what they're trying to do is put pressure on Trump to go in very deep.
[00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:35.378]  Meanwhile, Antiwar points out that we're drowning the Afghans in money.
[00:15:35.478 --> 00:15:37.159]  And that's not what Antiwar is saying.
[00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:44.442]  That is what the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, says.
[00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:46.642]  And that organization is SIGAR.
[00:15:46.923 --> 00:15:47.363]  Interesting.
[00:15:48.483 --> 00:15:48.924]  No cigar.
[00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.685]  We've been there for 16 years and no cigar.
[00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:54.307]  No Afghanistan reconstruction.
[00:15:54.708 --> 00:16:00.932]  He points out we spent five years dealing with the widespread corruption and waste in occupied Afghanistan.
[00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:03.734]  We've had years of reports and nothing is happening.
[00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:09.518]  It appears to have taken a toll on this particular individual who is now getting very vocal with his criticism.
[00:16:09.998 --> 00:16:11.639]  He is once again complaining that the U.S.
[00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:17.300]  is sending way too much aid to Afghanistan for a country that size to responsibly manage.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.561]  He said, we're drowning the Afghans in money.
[00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:22.942]  And what happens when they drown in money?
[00:16:23.702 --> 00:16:24.762]  We grow corruption.
[00:16:25.182 --> 00:16:28.003]  And we grow poppy seeds, among other things.
[00:16:28.583 --> 00:16:30.504]  We look at this report that came out today from Reuters.
[00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:32.024]  More than one-third of the U.S.
[00:16:32.064 --> 00:16:35.666]  adults have been prescribed opioids in 2015.
[00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:35.886]  Why not?
[00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:43.277]  Because we are flooded awash in the opium crops.
[00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:48.279]  It was down to, Afghanistan was down to only 10% of the world's supply under the Taliban.
[00:16:49.219 --> 00:16:54.921]  When we threw them out and took over, we then rapidly increased it to where they have remained well over 90%.
[00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:01.683]  And the high 90s of the worldwide production is coming from this country that we control.
[00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:04.504]  And of course you've seen the Geraldo Rivero videos.
[00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:06.945]  It's like, look at this, we've got US troops guarding the poppy fields.
[00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:13.399]  And it is an important part of the funding for the dark state, for the CIA.
[00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:23.367]  We've reported this many times, and it is one of the things that's behind the epidemic of heroin in this country, as well as the misuse of opioids.
[00:17:23.447 --> 00:17:29.111]  And if you want to talk about a gateway drug, it's not pot, it's the opioid prescriptions that we have here.
[00:17:29.972 --> 00:17:37.274]  And we just had the VA blocked by this administration from administering medical marijuana in the states where it's legal.
[00:17:37.734 --> 00:17:39.495]  That is not addictive like the opioids.
[00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:41.675]  But we are not allowed to do that.
[00:17:41.715 --> 00:17:42.455]  It's much safer.
[00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:44.156]  We got 38% of U.S.
[00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:46.656]  adults were prescribed opioids in 2015.
[00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:58.141]  Meanwhile, as we look at the shutting down of the CIA's covert program in Syria, we have a report on Infowars.com from Zero Hedge.
[00:17:58.201 --> 00:18:02.163]  Trump saw a disturbing video, then he shut down the CIA's covert Syrian program.
[00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:09.487]  The only question that remains is who in the CIA or the Obama-era State Department should be prosecuted first?
[00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:12.168]  Maybe we could start with John McCain.
[00:18:12.868 --> 00:18:15.950]  He was shown a video of a young boy being decapitated.
[00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:22.276]  And then he realized, and he asked the question, how do we justify this?
[00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:25.921]  When the people who are committing this murder are supposed to be the good guys.
[00:18:25.961 --> 00:18:27.683]  They're supposed to be our allies.
[00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:29.625]  That's what the CIA and John McCain are telling us.
[00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:31.146]  They're simply moderate rebels.
[00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:32.754]  No, they're not.
[00:18:33.574 --> 00:18:36.637]  When he asked them the question and they couldn't give him the answer, he shut it down.
[00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:42.902]  I'm glad to hear that somebody has got a bit of a moral compass and a bit of a backbone to shut this down.
[00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:45.904]  But that's key as far as Afghanistan goes.
[00:18:45.944 --> 00:18:52.550]  We have to cut off their money supply or the CIA will continue to push against Trump and push against the American people.
[00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:52.970]  Stay with us.
[00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.771]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:18.988 --> 00:23:19.489]  Welcome back.
[00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:32.524]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, many people know him, they call him America's toughest sheriff, has been convicted of criminal contempt for disobeying the orders of a sanctuary judge.
[00:23:33.466 --> 00:23:38.131]  And we're going to put this in context and we'll talk about the particulars of his case in just a moment.
[00:23:38.812 --> 00:23:43.093]  And let's remember what's truly at stake here if we don't protect our borders.
[00:23:43.113 --> 00:23:45.874]  This story at Infowars.com from the Washington Times today.
[00:23:45.914 --> 00:23:52.375]  Spanish border enclaves are under siege as hordes of African migrants storm the barriers.
[00:23:53.015 --> 00:24:07.159]  If you don't control immigration, if you don't control your borders, if people can come and anyone can come in, in uncontrolled numbers, we can't control our borders from MS-13 or from terrorists, we don't know how many people are going to come into our country.
[00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:09.801]  It is nothing short of an invasion.
[00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:19.792]  And of course we have seen countries in Central and South America, particularly Mexico, have used the United States as a pressure valve for their own society.
[00:24:20.112 --> 00:24:24.116]  If they don't have the money or don't want to spend the resources to educate their people, they send them to the United States.
[00:24:24.457 --> 00:24:29.882]  And then they work with their embassies in every state in the United States to help their citizens.
[00:24:30.723 --> 00:24:42.366]  Who are foreign citizens criminally trespassing in our country to help them evade the laws in our country so that we have absolutely no control over what the scale and the scope of our entitlement
[00:24:43.106 --> 00:24:43.586]  I think so.
[00:25:01.892 --> 00:25:05.597]  They said it was so that they would pay for the Social Security benefits, but that's not the case.
[00:25:05.657 --> 00:25:07.599]  They're not going to pay for Social Security benefits.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.542]  They're looking for benefits themselves.
[00:25:09.942 --> 00:25:14.408]  And of course, Social Security itself was created as a lie, as we pointed out before.
[00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:19.415]  A knife attack by an Islamist fanatic at the border crossing between Spain and Morocco last week.
[00:25:19.815 --> 00:25:30.199]  ...has highlighted concerns about terrorists infiltrating among the hordes of migrants who relentlessly press up against the flimsy barriers of Europe's two land borders with Africa, writes the Washington Times.
[00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:41.463]  They say a Moroccan national shouting Allahu Akbar, I wonder what his motivation would be, stabbed a Spanish police officer before being overpowered Tuesday along the entrance to Spain's North African enclave.
[00:25:42.063 --> 00:25:46.705]  Just 240 miles to the west, hundreds of migrants threaten to force their way into another
[00:25:47.425 --> 00:25:47.745]  I think?
[00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:07.573]  We're good to go.
[00:26:20.492 --> 00:26:22.154]  The border wall construction there.
[00:26:22.194 --> 00:26:33.907]  As Breitbart points out, DHS has signed a waiver of environmental regulations on Tuesday to allow construction of upgrades to the border wall and a new wall prototype projects to break ground.
[00:26:34.007 --> 00:26:38.472]  So they're moving ahead on the border wall, even if it is in a small way.
[00:26:38.572 --> 00:26:40.575]  Meanwhile, the Trump administration they say has scored
[00:26:41.155 --> 00:26:43.877]  Wins on immigration enforcement in Texas.
[00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:45.139]  This is coming from RT.
[00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:54.827]  They point out the Trump administration has another win in Texas persuading state and local authorities to perform the functions of federal immigration officials.
[00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:59.591]  Let me repeat that because this is very pertinent to what just happened with Sheriff Joe.
[00:27:00.131 --> 00:27:07.378]  The Trump administration has persuaded state and local authorities to perform functions of federal immigration officials.
[00:27:08.223 --> 00:27:19.611]  They say, under the negotiated agreement, 18 Texas counties have signed on to, and local agents and sheriff's offices will be trained to check if people they have in custody may be in violation of the U.S.
[00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:23.233]  immigration law, and then to notify federal authorities of ICE.
[00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:33.901]  They say the agreement is part of the Trump administration's crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities, places where local law enforcement doesn't report about undocumented immigrants.
[00:27:34.281 --> 00:27:36.082]  And so, what we're seeing here
[00:27:37.043 --> 00:27:43.568]  Is the Trump administration enlisting sheriff's departments to help enforce immigration law.
[00:27:44.048 --> 00:27:51.554]  What we saw with Sheriff Joe was he was trying to enforce immigration law that was not being enforced by the federal government.
[00:27:51.574 --> 00:27:54.396]  The Obama administration had shut down the Border Patrol.
[00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:57.058]  That's why they supported Donald Trump.
[00:27:57.078 --> 00:27:59.199]  They weren't being allowed to do their job.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.001]  The borders were wide open.
[00:28:01.687 --> 00:28:04.889]  And then of course it wasn't just the edicts coming out of the Obama administration.
[00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:14.116]  There were sanctuary cities and officials at various levels as well as those in the judiciary who came after Sheriff Joe.
[00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:16.918]  Now what has he been convicted of?
[00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:24.884]  He has been convicted of criminal contempt for ignoring a judge's orders to ignore the law.
[00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:26.686]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.885]  So, do not enforce immigration law, says the judge, even though that's the law of the land.
[00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:39.073]  And then when he ignores the judge and enforces the law, the judge holds him in criminal contempt.
[00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:41.195]  He may get up to six months in jail.
[00:28:41.276 --> 00:28:43.258]  He will be sentenced in October.
[00:28:43.338 --> 00:28:46.702]  He needs to be pardoned by the Trump administration.
[00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:57.933]  Or, the Trump administration will be exposed to massive hypocrisy for allowing someone to go to jail who is implementing the very policies that they're talking about now.
[00:28:58.034 --> 00:29:06.882]  And as we talk about this, we have Attorney General Sessions warning Philadelphia and other cities and jurisdictions about being sanctuary cities.
[00:29:07.643 --> 00:29:08.744]  Why not the judiciary?
[00:29:09.605 --> 00:29:12.467]  Why not the people who are under the Justice Department?
[00:29:12.507 --> 00:29:14.188]  Why didn't they shut down this prosecution?
[00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:16.289]  Why would they allow this to go forward?
[00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:23.493]  And as we look at this report from Arizona Central, it's interesting that they point out immigrant rights groups are praising the federal judge's ruling.
[00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:24.394]  Well, of course they would.
[00:29:24.974 --> 00:29:27.816]  Jailing the sheriff who was enforcing immigration law.
[00:29:28.276 --> 00:29:35.981]  And then they quote Noemi Romero, 26, who is reacting to the announcement that Sheriff Joe was found guilty of criminal contempt of court.
[00:29:36.846 --> 00:29:43.011]  Romero, 26, is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who was arrested in an Arpaio raid.
[00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:53.919]  So we have a foreign citizen who comes here, criminally trespassing, arrested in a raid, rejoicing that the sheriff who arrested her is going to go to jail.
[00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:55.620]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:03.106]  Now, meanwhile, we have the controversy over the program being floated by HBO called Confederate.
[00:30:04.104 --> 00:30:07.608]  There seems to be little appetite, says the Guardian, for the series.
[00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:17.720]  It plans to take a revisionist approach to American history, imagining a world in which the South successfully seceded from the Union and slavery persists as a modern-day institution.
[00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:21.925]  Meanwhile, there's a grassroots campaign to upend the forthcoming series.
[00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:31.311]  On Twitter, hashtag no confederate, it was started by an activist, April Rain, who is also behind the Oscars So White campaign.
[00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:36.713]  And the people who are complaining about that are complaining because they say that it is too white.
[00:30:38.314 --> 00:30:40.035]  Well, actually it is polarizing.
[00:30:40.075 --> 00:30:46.178]  And if we look at some of the comments that they're making, we're seeing things like, I don't want to watch slavery fan fiction.
[00:30:46.658 --> 00:30:51.800]  They're replicating histories where whiteness thrives and people of color remain oppressed.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.362]  Let me tell you what's going on with this that they don't understand.
[00:30:55.262 --> 00:31:09.413]  This, the whole point of this and this next program that just was released, information about it was released today from Amazon called Black America, the whole point of these programs that are now coming from Amazon and Netflix, they are the new media.
[00:31:10.113 --> 00:31:17.679]  And this is part of a program to create division, to create hatred between black people and white people.
[00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:18.520]  That's the real truth.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.101]  Let me tell you the truth about slavery.
[00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:23.403]  It's never been more profitable than it is today.
[00:31:24.346 --> 00:31:27.088]  Here's an article from the Daily Mail that just came out last week.
[00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:36.373]  It said slavery is the most profitable it has ever been, with modern day traders making 30 times more than they did in the 18th century.
[00:31:36.793 --> 00:31:39.795]  As experts warn, human life is more expendable than ever.
[00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:44.278]  They say sex trafficking is half of the profits of that illegal industry.
[00:31:44.898 --> 00:31:49.021]  Despite those victims only accounting for 5% of modern slaves.
[00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:55.705]  This is coming from a human rights researcher, Siddharth Kara, who said human life has become more expendable than ever.
[00:31:56.673 --> 00:31:58.074]  So let me tell you something about this.
[00:31:58.634 --> 00:32:01.155]  Slavery wasn't created by the South.
[00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:10.338]  As a matter of fact, when the 17th century and 18th century, when they were buying the slaves, they were buying them from Muslims who were capturing them in Africa.
[00:32:10.398 --> 00:32:12.519]  So that was a large part of the slave trade.
[00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:15.580]  It wasn't even strictly part of the West.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.940]  But it wasn't created by the South.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.221]  It wasn't isolated by the South.
[00:32:18.721 --> 00:32:21.322]  It wasn't the sole or even the chief cause of the war.
[00:32:22.082 --> 00:32:24.004]  But let me tell you what they don't want you to see.
[00:32:24.424 --> 00:32:28.087]  They don't want you to see that you are the slave right now.
[00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:37.294]  And your corporate masters and these Machiavellian politicians want you fighting each other instead of fighting for your freedom.
[00:32:37.654 --> 00:32:42.198]  They want you to see each other as black or white and the enemy of the other.
[00:32:42.338 --> 00:32:44.439]  That's what these programs are ultimately about.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.840]  Now stay with us when we come back.
[00:32:46.661 --> 00:32:52.795]  Do is going to have another contestant entry, and the $20,000 Folk Song Cover Contest will be right back.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.

[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.728]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.009 --> 00:36:59.211]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:11.528 --> 00:37:14.229]  I thought I had enough of these people.
[00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:22.713]  They're a bunch of Christian murder scum that want to join a dance practice, keep their babies alive, and sell their body parts.
[00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:29.897]  But more than you need to know about these people, is the one who faced these scum.
[00:37:29.957 --> 00:37:38.761]  They're illegal alpha mother fucks, they have green looking skin, and they run around doing the weird things we want to do with babies.
[00:37:40.903 --> 00:37:45.226]  I'll have them on video.
[00:37:46.127 --> 00:37:53.974]  Parasitic, creepy, weird, sick stuff man.
[00:38:02.736 --> 00:38:05.257]  Oh my God!
[00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:39.879]  We're good.
[00:38:46.164 --> 00:38:53.569]  And that was a portion of one of our early entries into our Jones, Ivor, Hillary's Into Creepy Weird Sick Stuff.
[00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:55.050]  Man, we love our Somalis.
[00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.991]  Cover Song Contest.
[00:38:57.051 --> 00:38:58.172]  It's got a really long title.
[00:38:58.192 --> 00:39:06.397]  We still haven't nailed down a really short, concise title for it, but Hugh Bannister was one of the first entries to come in that I thought was really powerful.
[00:39:06.437 --> 00:39:07.458]  He did a metal version.
[00:39:08.438 --> 00:39:14.162]  We've since got a couple hard-rockin' metal versions in, but his, I think, was the first, and he's the only one
[00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:18.344]  That so far played all the instruments on his recording and did his own video.
[00:39:18.364 --> 00:39:21.846]  So now we turn to Mr. Hugh Bannister, joining us from South Africa.
[00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:29.210]  He actually lives near London, but he's on holiday right now, but we invited him here and we're really glad to have you on, sir.
[00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.311]  And what was it like?
[00:39:30.331 --> 00:39:35.313]  What was your first impulse when you saw the contest, how it was going to happen?
[00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:38.375]  Like what made you go, man, I'm just going to do a metal version and stick it?
[00:39:40.094 --> 00:39:43.817]  I saw one of your writers Paul Joseph Watson, I'm a big fan of him.
[00:39:44.117 --> 00:39:55.124]  I saw him, he shared an article about the contest and I was reading through it and it was late at night and I was like, I saw the metal, you could do it in a style of metal.
[00:39:55.845 --> 00:40:02.609]  And you know, I listen to loads of metal, I play it, I'm in a couple of bands, so I thought, you know, why not give it a shot?
[00:40:02.969 --> 00:40:07.492]  And you know, even if nothing comes of it, you know, I've had fun making it, I love watching the show.
[00:40:08.775 --> 00:40:09.535]  It'd be a good thing to do.
[00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:17.658]  I've just finished my exams as well so I got loads of spare time so it's not like I had to sacrifice anything.
[00:40:18.658 --> 00:40:24.319]  I can tell you're a Paul Joseph Watson fan because you use Imagine My Shock at the beginning and you're standing in front of a map wall.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.361]  That's also two tell-tale signs that you're a Watson fan.
[00:40:31.232 --> 00:40:39.134]  Yeah, I had the thought, that was the first thing I actually thought of doing, was the Imagine My Shop.
[00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:41.415]  It's the first thing I thought about incorporating.
[00:40:41.435 --> 00:40:45.816]  I had that idea with the hi-hat in my head and then everything just followed after that.
[00:40:45.896 --> 00:40:51.657]  It wasn't like a clear-cut, like I'd written what I was going to do out of all the parts.
[00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.678]  It kind of just followed when I was recording it.
[00:40:53.698 --> 00:40:57.539]  I was like, oh, I was just noodling around with the guitar.
[00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:05.907]  And I was like oh that riff sounds nice and working out the keys as I was going along and then comparing that to the original.
[00:41:06.087 --> 00:41:12.274]  I'm also trying to make it in my own as well to try and differentiate myself from some of the other entries.
[00:41:12.998 --> 00:41:23.521]  Well, that little lick, that little high lick you do before you go into the Hillary part, to me, really sells your song as like, this is a cover version, but this is my own interpretation of it.
[00:41:23.821 --> 00:41:24.081]  Oh, yeah.
[00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:25.481]  Thank you very much.
[00:41:25.521 --> 00:41:32.023]  Yeah, no, I thought that was one of the last things I actually put in, was the... with the tremolo picking.
[00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:35.344]  I wasn't going to have that in originally.
[00:41:35.364 --> 00:41:37.624]  You can hear, before that part, there's the clean guitar.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:42:01.395]  That had a nice delay on it and the delay cut across to the other bar and I was thinking to leave that in but then I just thought I'd add that in, you know, I'm a fan of those screeching guitars, the fast guitars, so I thought why not and it came out nicely so I was pretty pleased with that.
[00:42:02.193 --> 00:42:10.541]  Well, let's jump into the politics of this song, because it's got a lot of lyrics about Hillary, Obama, and also about the immigration crisis that's going on right now.
[00:42:11.402 --> 00:42:17.167]  And when you really look at what is going on in this world, I mean, you're in London, you're London.
[00:42:17.928 --> 00:42:18.789]  What is it like for you?
[00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:20.931]  Are you dealing with loads of immigrants?
[00:42:23.216 --> 00:42:25.799]  Well, I live in Reading, which is just off London.
[00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:28.662]  There isn't much of a problem in Reading.
[00:42:28.802 --> 00:42:34.768]  I mean, I'm friends with people of all sorts of race and religions and everyone seems to get on.
[00:42:34.848 --> 00:42:42.556]  But of course, there is in certain parts of the UK with certain groups of people, problems that we need to deal with.
[00:42:42.976 --> 00:42:45.699]  And I think the song really draws attention.
[00:42:46.483 --> 00:42:59.453]  Uh, to those details and I mean, ironically, the song was supposed to be almost like a hit piece and you know, CNN, the mainstream media came on to that and tried to use it as a hit piece for Jones.
[00:42:59.513 --> 00:43:03.756]  But ironically, it's flipped on its head and this contest is really, um,
[00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.294]  I think it has.
[00:43:08.454 --> 00:43:10.877]  It's a good song with the melodies and stuff.
[00:43:11.137 --> 00:43:15.461]  We had a guest on yesterday who said it wasn't too complex, but sometimes you don't need complexity.
[00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:19.966]  You just need to get the melody out there and get the words out there.
[00:43:20.326 --> 00:43:22.609]  Because, you know, my kids run around singing the song.
[00:43:22.669 --> 00:43:24.751]  Everybody in the office really likes the original song.
[00:43:25.211 --> 00:43:33.415]  And so I think opening it up to a whole, you know, group of people to take on and make their own versions has really been exciting and seeing all the different cover versions coming in.
[00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:35.156]  It's just, it's been really successful.
[00:43:35.176 --> 00:43:36.437]  I've been very pleased so far.
[00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:38.758]  Yeah, it's a cracking tune.
[00:43:38.798 --> 00:43:46.942]  I mean, I mean, it's simple when in the bare bones, when you look at the, when you're laying out the chords, but, um, there's a lot of flavor you can add to it.
[00:43:47.022 --> 00:43:53.645]  I mean, uh, my version, I added in some in the clean version, you know, ninths and elevenths that you wouldn't necessarily
[00:43:54.372 --> 00:44:00.877]  The harmonic function of the chords shouldn't work, but you can make it so it works and adds more flavour.
[00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:03.039]  Some of the other entries are great as well.
[00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:05.340]  I mean, a personal favourite is probably the jazz one.
[00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:06.301]  Yeah.
[00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.002]  And that one's great.
[00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:11.145]  That's one of the ones where it was actually, like mine, it was like properly spliced up.
[00:44:11.975 --> 00:44:13.936]  And, you know, Trudy made their own.
[00:44:14.716 --> 00:44:17.937]  Have you seen the footage of these truckers going through the tunnel?
[00:44:17.957 --> 00:44:23.259]  They're about to go through the tunnel and they kind of get backed up and then people start breaking into the backs of the trucks trying to jump on.
[00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:28.561]  I mean, how is England dealing with this migrant crisis that's going on?
[00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.922]  And then also tying that in with Brexit.
[00:44:30.942 --> 00:44:38.405]  Do you think you'll see a drop in immigration if your leaders get their act together and actually follow through with what Brexit is supposed to be?
[00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:46.792]  I'm seeing reports that Brexit won't be carried out till 2019 and I mean all sorts could happen then.
[00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:48.992]  You could have a global financial crisis.
[00:44:50.432 --> 00:44:52.073]  I mean anything could happen in that time.
[00:44:52.193 --> 00:44:54.053]  We live in such an unstable period.
[00:44:54.653 --> 00:45:06.176]  The way that this country can deal with immigration, it's not so much the numbers, well of course the numbers does have something to do with it, but it's the way that we integrate these people into our society.
[00:45:07.223 --> 00:45:09.124]  Or don't integrate them, essentially.
[00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:12.385]  A lack of integration, I guess you could say.
[00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:13.945]  Yeah.
[00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:19.587]  I mean, some places, you can go to the UK now, and you wouldn't know it was the UK.
[00:45:20.628 --> 00:45:30.291]  It's not a problem, because I mean, I'm for having all sorts of cultures, but when the dominant culture is just lost, and there's no identity,
[00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:41.385]  Yeah, what's interesting is that England's got a lot of Indians, a large Indian population from the 1800s when they were colonizing India.
[00:45:42.287 --> 00:45:45.751]  And it seems like the Indians came up, they learned English, they assimilated.
[00:45:45.771 --> 00:45:49.757]  There's multi-generations of Indians living in Britain.
[00:45:50.257 --> 00:45:55.360]  But it seems like from these Muslim countries they're coming in and they want to be left to their own devices.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.821]  They don't want to be part of the culture.
[00:45:58.101 --> 00:46:00.562]  And then they want the culture to change to Sharia law.
[00:46:00.582 --> 00:46:02.603]  There's a lot of protests coming out about that.
[00:46:02.643 --> 00:46:03.704]  I got a little bit of time left.
[00:46:03.744 --> 00:46:08.306]  What's your advice to anybody about to enter this contest in the waning days of it?
[00:46:09.447 --> 00:46:10.987]  Try and do something that hasn't been done before.
[00:46:11.288 --> 00:46:14.169]  I mean, we've had a few metal covers.
[00:46:14.189 --> 00:46:16.710]  We've had a few other rock ones.
[00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.471]  Try and do, I mean,
[00:46:18.706 --> 00:46:23.011]  I'm not saying do like Bangor or something, but like just do something that no one's done before.
[00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.094]  Try and make, you know, your own video.
[00:46:25.114 --> 00:46:29.239]  I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I spent, you know, like the best part of 40, 50 hours, you know.
[00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.850]  We're good to go.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.760]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:10.021]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.402 --> 00:47:15.404]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:21.207]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.587 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.409]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:49.469]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:50.510]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.150]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:59.073]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.093 --> 00:48:59.954]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:00.014]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:16.018 --> 00:49:28.524]  Well, President Trump gave another great speech today, a great speech from a great leader as he was addressing small business owners on the current state of the economy and small business growth.
[00:49:28.964 --> 00:49:33.746]  Trump hosts small business owners at White House to talk taxes and economic growth.
[00:49:34.046 --> 00:49:39.629]  The Trump administration will tout small business success on Tuesday as part of its American Dream Week.
[00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:48.417]  It's American Dream Week, highlighting how President Donald Trump's economic agenda is designed to support and simultaneously be driven by U.S.
[00:49:49.157 --> 00:49:50.599]  small business growth.
[00:49:50.859 --> 00:49:53.241]  So he had this meeting and he gave a great speech.
[00:49:53.682 --> 00:50:02.249]  It was interesting, Linda McMahon, who is heading the small business department of the White House, put out a tweet that kind of felt like a Trump tweet to me.
[00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:20.063]  Applying pressure to the White House and to Congress to pass tax reform, saying that all the small business peoples that she talked to today all wanted tax reform and they all said that they would invest it back into their business.
[00:50:20.603 --> 00:50:22.465]  That's how you make America great again.
[00:50:22.685 --> 00:50:25.107]  That's why we need tax reform.
[00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:26.188]  We need less taxes.
[00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:28.129]  Don't even get me started on taxes.
[00:50:28.429 --> 00:50:31.592]  But this were some highlights from President Trump's speech today.
[00:50:35.461 --> 00:50:42.725]  I want to thank Administrator Linda McMahon for doing a tremendous job helping small businesses all across our country.
[00:50:42.765 --> 00:50:44.146]  She has been incredible.
[00:50:44.806 --> 00:50:49.128]  She's determined to transform America and American dreams into reality.
[00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:54.271]  America is on the verge of a golden age for small business.
[00:50:55.272 --> 00:50:57.433]  We're ending job-killing regulation.
[00:50:57.473 --> 00:50:58.894]  These folks know that very well.
[00:50:59.454 --> 00:51:03.036]  And we're really ending it at a record pace, I'll tell you.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:23.084]  We're eliminating the tremendous, the massive restrictions on American energy, and numbers are going to be released next week that are going to be earth-shattering as to what we're doing with energy and the amounts of energy we're producing, far greater than ever before.
[00:51:23.104 --> 00:51:24.105]  Earth-shattering, folks.
[00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:25.865]  Can't wait to hear that news next week.
[00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:29.026]  So that our companies can thrive, compete, and grow.
[00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:32.507]  Our stock market has reached an all-time high today.
[00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:35.070]  All time high.
[00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:35.550]  Think of it.
[00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:36.692]  Nobody ever talks about it.
[00:51:37.853 --> 00:51:38.835]  They don't talk about it.
[00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:42.179]  And they don't talk about another factor.
[00:51:42.219 --> 00:51:45.324]  That unemployment just hit a 16-year low.
[00:51:45.344 --> 00:51:46.545]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:51:47.066 --> 00:51:48.928]  Is that GDP for the quarter
[00:51:50.014 --> 00:51:51.614]  Just released at 2.6%.
[00:51:53.755 --> 00:51:56.115]  So that's so much higher than anticipated.
[00:51:56.155 --> 00:52:01.556]  Remember I was saying we're going to try and hit 3% sometime over the next period of two years?
[00:52:01.576 --> 00:52:04.857]  Well, 2.6% is getting closer, Gary.
[00:52:05.437 --> 00:52:08.018]  Closer than we thought and a lot faster than we thought.
[00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:09.338]  But don't worry about the 3%.
[00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:10.498]  We're going to be higher than 3%.
[00:52:10.558 --> 00:52:12.279]  Keep that number in mind.
[00:52:12.299 --> 00:52:12.539]  3% GDP growth.
[00:52:13.979 --> 00:52:15.539]  The jobs are coming pouring back.
[00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:18.580]  Factories are coming pouring back into our country.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.020]  Into our country.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.721]  Jobs are coming back.
[00:52:21.761 --> 00:52:24.521]  You saw the Foxconn last week.
[00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:32.163]  They're going to spend $10 billion, but he is one of the great businessmen of our time, and I think the number is going to be $30 million.
[00:52:32.203 --> 00:52:36.283]  So he told me off the record he thinks he may go $30 billion.
[00:52:36.323 --> 00:52:36.804]  Think of this.
[00:52:37.784 --> 00:52:40.244]  He may go $30 billion investment.
[00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.485]  But he told me that off the record, so I promised I wouldn't tell anybody.
[00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:52.806]  Together, we're unleashing a new era of American prosperity, perhaps like we've never seen before.
[00:52:52.906 --> 00:52:54.567]  And you see it day by day.
[00:52:55.148 --> 00:53:00.031]  You don't hear too much from the media, but I think the media is going to actually be forced to cover it pretty soon.
[00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.032]  They're going to have no choice.
[00:53:01.852 --> 00:53:05.915]  You are the dreamers and the innovators who are powering us into the future.
[00:53:06.055 --> 00:53:07.316]  That's exactly what you are.
[00:53:07.896 --> 00:53:14.801]  And my administration will be there with you every single step of the way.
[00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:16.723]  And so will these people right here.
[00:53:17.643 --> 00:53:19.224]  Every single step of the way.
[00:53:19.284 --> 00:53:19.865]  So, thank you.
[00:53:20.799 --> 00:53:27.703]  It's the American Dream Week, and of course it was Barack Obama who said Donald Trump was the epitome of the American Dream.
[00:53:27.743 --> 00:53:31.445]  So how about that, now President Trump has American Dream Week.
[00:53:31.845 --> 00:53:44.893]  Now, just like we used to take Barack Obama speeches and show you all the points that he lied, and all the points where he was providing propaganda into his speech, let's take President Trump's speech and show you exactly what he's talking about.
[00:53:45.313 --> 00:53:50.897]  Now let's go back, let's look at some of these executive orders that he's slashed in order to prop up small business.
[00:53:51.277 --> 00:53:58.581]  Back in January, Trump signs executive order slashing small business regulations and the details of that slash.
[00:53:58.842 --> 00:54:10.009]  President Donald Trump signed an order on Monday that will seek to dramatically pare back federal regulations by requiring agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced.
[00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:20.613]  So that's basically trumping all of the liberals who want to just make regulations and regulate small business out of the market.
[00:54:20.693 --> 00:54:23.615]  So great brinksmanship from Trump on that one.
[00:54:24.758 --> 00:54:25.919]  This is from February.
[00:54:26.359 --> 00:54:30.182]  Trump signs another executive order in push to slash regulations.
[00:54:30.242 --> 00:54:38.349]  The measure directs federal agencies to create regulatory reform task forces, which will evaluate federal rules and recommend whether to keep, repeal, or change them.
[00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:43.633]  Trump's administration wants the officials to reduce what it deems expensive or unnecessary rules.
[00:54:43.893 --> 00:54:46.595]  So first he has the executive order saying, fine, you want to make a new rule?
[00:54:46.615 --> 00:54:47.876]  You're going to have to slash two.
[00:54:48.276 --> 00:54:50.158]  Now he signs one in February.
[00:54:50.718 --> 00:54:51.038]  We're good.
[00:55:12.614 --> 00:55:12.834]  I think?
[00:55:30.919 --> 00:55:40.006]  Of Obama's and you look at some of the graphs from this story, approved rules, Trump is not even on the bar graph in comparison to the rest.
[00:55:40.366 --> 00:55:43.629]  Regulations withdrawn, Trump completely trumps the rest.
[00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:50.614]  Economically significant rules approved, again you can see Obama way up high and Trump way down low.
[00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:56.678]  And these historic record levels that we're talking about, that's a regulatory output rate of just 0.1%.
[00:55:57.699 --> 00:56:00.942]  Two percent under Trump compared with the historical average.
[00:56:00.982 --> 00:56:04.085]  So there's the record slashing that Trump is doing.
[00:56:04.105 --> 00:56:05.005]  This is from July.
[00:56:05.065 --> 00:56:06.627]  Trump slashes hundreds of regulations.
[00:56:06.907 --> 00:56:12.812]  The Trump administration has withdrawn or delayed 860 proposed regulations in the first five months.
[00:56:13.193 --> 00:56:16.836]  The beginning of a regulatory overhaul meant to bolster economic growth.
[00:56:17.865 --> 00:56:19.367]  And it's working!
[00:56:20.347 --> 00:56:23.591]  Dow approaches $22,000, closes at a record high.
[00:56:23.611 --> 00:56:24.792]  The Dow hit another record high, $22,000.
[00:56:25.592 --> 00:56:33.840]  The Dow along with the NASDAQ and the S&P posted strong monthly gains in July as corporate quarterly results have topped expectations.
[00:56:34.461 --> 00:56:36.262]  And these are record highs that are happening
[00:56:36.963 --> 00:56:37.364]  Pretty much.
[00:56:37.484 --> 00:56:38.485]  It feels like every day.
[00:56:38.825 --> 00:56:40.547]  Dow hits 25th record of 2017.
[00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:44.552]  This was three weeks ago, so I don't know what the number is.
[00:56:44.892 --> 00:56:50.058]  The Dow did it again Friday, climbing 85 points to notch its third straight record close, the 25th this year.
[00:56:50.699 --> 00:56:52.161]  That is also the S&P 500.
[00:56:52.321 --> 00:56:53.002]  Zoom to a record.
[00:56:55.993 --> 00:57:07.604]  The broad index has now closed record 25 times this year, 33 times since Trump's victory, and the index has celebrated 42 all-time highs since Trump's election last November.
[00:57:07.664 --> 00:57:09.085]  So it's working.
[00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.908]  Now let's compare this to what we saw under Obama.
[00:57:11.988 --> 00:57:12.809]  Simply the worst.
[00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:18.274]  Obama is first president ever to not see a single year of 3% GDP growth.
[00:57:18.314 --> 00:57:18.935]  This is from April 2016.
[00:57:20.376 --> 00:57:22.236]  The committee department announced that the U.S.
[00:57:22.456 --> 00:57:29.138]  economy expanded at its slowest pace in two years under Obama, only president without a single year of 3% GDP growth.
[00:57:29.678 --> 00:57:32.419]  GDP growth under Obama was the worst in decades.
[00:57:32.459 --> 00:57:42.201]  President Obama, the only president since Hoover, not to get 3% growth in any year he was in office, and Hoover was in office during the Great Recession.
[00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:49.643]  Now there's this story from CNN, CNBC, I don't have time to get to all of it, but you can see the graphs in here.
[00:57:49.783 --> 00:57:51.543]  Home ownership down under Obama.
[00:57:52.444 --> 00:57:54.324]  Income rates down under Obama.
[00:57:54.564 --> 00:57:57.505]  Everything down under Obama and you can see it.
[00:57:58.165 --> 00:58:01.306]  But the debt, the debt goes up under Obama.
[00:58:01.346 --> 00:58:07.908]  So debt goes up, public debt goes up, income goes down, house ownership goes down under Obama.
[00:58:08.288 --> 00:58:11.070]  And for Trump, it's all trending the opposite way.
[00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:12.050]  It hasn't even been a year yet.
[00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:13.451]  And now, this is a key.
[00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:17.713]  Foxconn announces $10 billion investment in Wisconsin, up to 13,000 jobs.
[00:58:18.093 --> 00:58:21.355]  Trump said that, off the record, they said $30 billion.
[00:58:21.375 --> 00:58:22.736]  We'll see if that comes to fruition.
[00:58:22.996 --> 00:58:25.097]  But keep in mind, Wisconsin, this is key.
[00:58:25.537 --> 00:58:31.320]  If Trump can lock down Wisconsin in 2020 by bringing in jobs and manufacturing, that's going to work.
[00:58:31.681 --> 00:58:32.321]  And hey, you know what?
[00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:34.042]  Maybe Foxconn will start making
[00:58:34.602 --> 00:58:42.286]  All of the cell phone and technology products here in America and not have basically a sweatshop type scenario to make those products.
[00:58:42.326 --> 00:58:42.926]  But you know what?
[00:58:43.446 --> 00:58:48.649]  Trump supporters are not welcome, says the new UCF diversity chair.
[00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:57.333]  Conservative students are up in arms over the appointment of the new diversity chair for the University of Central Florida student government, saying he has repeatedly declared that Trump supporters are not welcome.
[00:58:57.513 --> 00:59:00.735]  So if you like America, if you like America succeeding, get out!
