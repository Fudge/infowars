[00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.490]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.853]  It is Tuesday, January 31st, 2017.
[00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.995]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:38.034]  The fight for sanctuary status continues in the face of Donald Trump's new national security policy of national security.
[00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:42.017]  The latest sanctuary cries come from California and Colorado.
[00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:54.446]  Also, the hypocrisy of the Democrats is in full force as Charles Schumer cries over Trump's travel ban, but managed to choke back tears when he himself called for a refugee ban in 2015.
[00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:54.846]  And then,
[00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:06.544]  Alex Jones makes a statement on the recent move of Oprah Winfrey to CBS's 60 Minutes.
[00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:12.636]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:09.706]  Well, it looks like it's not going to take a mega-earthquake to send California off the deep end of the continental United States.
[00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:17.716]  In a bold move, they are actually proposing the entire state of California become a sanctuary state.
[00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:22.942]  That's right, border-to-border protection for people who are here in this country illegally.
[00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.285]  So they had their first public hearing today.
[00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:34.994]  The Senate is rushing to enact measures that Democratic lawmakers say would protect immigrants from the crackdown that the Republican President Donald Trump has promised.
[00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:46.559]  California may prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities and already that California has the largest cities Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento.
[00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.941]  These have so-called sanctuary policies prohibiting police from cooperating with immigration authorities.
[00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:53.722]  Much of the state does not.
[00:03:54.302 --> 00:04:04.916]  So now we have Democratic legislation that wants to do away with that, completely resist Donald Trump, and this is going to be their big bold move to do it.
[00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:11.604]  This is of course less than a week after Donald Trump signed an order threatening to withdraw some federal grants.
[00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:17.508]  From jurisdictions that bar officials from communicating with federal authorities about someone's immigration status.
[00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:20.010]  So you can see California is making a bold move here.
[00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.693]  They might actually be the first state to be willingly kicked out of the continental U.S.
[00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:29.855]  We won't even need to hold a vote on CalEx.
[00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:30.996]  It just hit the bricks.
[00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:48.629]  Meanwhile in Colorado, we're seeing a Colorado state representative announcing a bill on Monday that would allow victims of certain crimes that are committed by illegal immigrants to sue state and local politicians who defy federal immigration authorities that are seeking to enforce the law.
[00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:57.876]  So now if you have these Democratic representatives that are all for this sanctuary cities and then we have someone here illegally who ends up committing a crime,
[00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:08.505]  Which President Trump is saying it happens so much more than you would know, which is why he wants them to start actually publishing the statistics weekly of crimes committed by people who are here illegally.
[00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:15.490]  So now lawmakers who ignore that and want to hide that because they have this agenda of open borders,
[00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:23.798]  This Colorado Republican wants to make it that crime victims are able to sue those politicians directly for the Sanctuary City policies.
[00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.300]  This is Republican State Rep.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.061]  Dave Williams.
[00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:27.022]  He's Hispanic.
[00:05:27.382 --> 00:05:37.712]  He said he wants to strip the immunity from Democratic politicians who place Coloradans in danger because of the Sanctuary City policies that they created and continue to implement.
[00:05:38.473 --> 00:06:03.454]  And he says, as the first Latino elected to Colorado House District 15, I think it's important that we do all we can to uphold the rule of law and ensure all communities, regardless of race or ethnicity, are protected from dangerous policies that are forced on us by radical, out-of-touch politicians who continually sell out to an unlawful agenda that increases the number of criminals and needless deaths among our fellow citizens.
[00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:05.116]  That is a mouthful.
[00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:06.457]  Couldn't have said it better myself.
[00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:11.861]  And can you imagine if this was a policy that caught on and other states started enacting this?
[00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:26.113]  I think we would have a lot more Democratic politicians that would maybe think twice about some of these policies that, you know, let's face it, they're hoping to regain some seats in a couple of years when they're up for reelection or to, you know, get back
[00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:34.600]  In the house there since they lost so many seats because of their erratic, irrational, insane policies that are putting people's lives in danger.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.721]  So we'll see how that goes.
[00:06:36.482 --> 00:06:38.964]  Now, here's something really incredible.
[00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:47.031]  So Donald Trump caught a lot of flack for saying that there's some bad hombres that are coming across the border there in Mexico.
[00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:50.113]  He called for this border wall, got a lot of pushback.
[00:06:50.894 --> 00:07:00.504]  But it's really interesting to me because the way that Mexico is kind of retaliating, we have these leaders there retaliating that are pushing back against this wall.
[00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:10.694]  They're saying they're going to stop the terrorists, they're going to send the jihadists, and now we have an ex-official calling on Mexico to unleash the drug cartels to punish Trump.
[00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:16.936]  They're basically underscoring the fact that it's bad hombres that are coming across the border.
[00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:18.456]  This is completely ridiculous.
[00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:21.577]  It's former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jorge Castaneda.
[00:07:21.697 --> 00:07:29.418]  He's called on Mexico to punish President Trump for his actions on deporting illegal immigrants and building the border wall.
[00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:33.619]  He wants to allow criminal cartels to run drugs into the United States.
[00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:38.640]  This is exactly why Donald Trump wants to build the wall and why he's calling for a wall.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.140]  Margaret Howell has more.
[00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:45.779]  We have an article up that talks about how this one ex-official is telling the U.S.
[00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:51.021]  that basically Mexico is going to unleash the drug cartels to punish Trump because of this wall.
[00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:53.602]  Now, this article was written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:53.642 --> 00:07:54.422]  It's up on our website.
[00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:58.023]  It talks about how this one man, he's a former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
[00:07:58.043 --> 00:07:59.644]  His name is George Castaneda.
[00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:05.186]  He's calling for Mexico to punish President Trump for his actions on both deporting illegal immigrants
[00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:06.167]  I think.
[00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:30.607]  We might not cooperate with you in stopping the criminal drug runs that are happening because you have the nerve to say that illegal aliens can't cross freely.
[00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:38.372]  You have the nerve to secure your own border, you know, no longer allowing remittance to pass through the border and support the Mexican economy.
[00:08:38.672 --> 00:08:39.473]  We're going to fix that.
[00:08:39.513 --> 00:08:41.254]  We're just going to unleash all the drug cartels.
[00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:42.074]  You know what?
[00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:43.635]  Who is this idiot?
[00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:44.676]  I can't make this up.
[00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:46.717]  Just taking you to this part really quickly.
[00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:49.439]  It could be released on the U.S.
[00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:52.661]  as retribution for Trump's aggressive stance toward Mexico.
[00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.883]  What aggressive stance is he talking about?
[00:08:54.903 --> 00:09:03.789]  I mean, specifically where these are basic things here, securing the border and not allowing this run amok that's been happening over the past 15 years or so to continue.
[00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:07.411]  Now, he's saying that traffickers as a part of a revenge attack against Trump
[00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.638]  The implications are astoundingly clear!
[00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:13.739]  Mexico would consider exporting chaos and violence to the U.S.
[00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:21.582]  as a form of payback for immigration restrictions and controls against the instability that the southern border has brought to the country for decades.
[00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:26.124]  Now, these comments are incredibly ironic, and they're ridiculous.
[00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:32.106]  He's making a case for the wall folks himself just by opening his idiotic mouth.
[00:09:32.486 --> 00:09:33.307]  Check out this article.
[00:09:33.347 --> 00:09:34.227]  It's up on our website.
[00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:37.568]  While you're at it, download our app, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:09:38.048 --> 00:09:39.089]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:52.266]  Despite President Trump's executive order Friday barring any refugees entering the United States, the Trump administration is allowing 872 refugees into the U.S.
[00:09:52.306 --> 00:09:58.669]  They've granted waivers to let these refugees who were considered in transit in the country.
[00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:02.111]  These people had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect.
[00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:02.891]  I think?
[00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:24.631]  And a lot of people were criticizing this rollout because a lot of the agencies were very confused about how to implement this ban.
[00:10:24.732 --> 00:10:30.194]  So it started a lot of these mass protests across the country there at all the airports.
[00:10:30.414 --> 00:10:31.795]  Very safe, might I add.
[00:10:31.835 --> 00:10:32.455]  My goodness.
[00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:38.078]  I mean, everyone's getting pat down at the TSA, but then all of a sudden all these protesters can just show up.
[00:10:38.198 --> 00:10:41.200]  I mean, we saw how violent they got there in D.C.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.981]  So pretty interesting there.
[00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:45.002]  But something that didn't get a lot more coverage.
[00:10:45.902 --> 00:11:03.069]  Was the fact that President Obama on his last week in office actually had a lot of Cuban refugees stranded at the airport for quite some time because he decided to do away, repeal the wet foot, dry foot policy that basically says any Cuban that arrives and is able to make it to U.S.
[00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:05.690]  soil could be granted some immunity here.
[00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.851]  We'd allow you to stay.
[00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:11.312]  Well, President Obama did away with that seemingly for no other reason than to
[00:11:12.913 --> 00:11:18.398]  Point out Donald Trump's hypocrisy if he were to reenact the wet foot, dry foot policy.
[00:11:18.458 --> 00:11:21.020]  Because we have these Cubans, it's kind of been in place for decades.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.541]  So very interesting there.
[00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:27.786]  That did not get a lot of coverage and many refugees from Cuba have been sent back.
[00:11:27.966 --> 00:11:30.268]  So very interesting hypocrisy there.
[00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:31.729]  Where were all the protesters?
[00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:32.530]  Where were all the rioters?
[00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.771]  You don't care about them?
[00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:34.791]  You don't care about the Cubans?
[00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:45.904]  Well, we also have another Democratic Senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, suggesting that the United States move towards a system of absolutely no screening for immigrants.
[00:11:46.284 --> 00:11:52.389]  You and I are going to get the TSA groped down, but people coming from these terror nations
[00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:54.449]  You know, they just come on in.
[00:11:54.749 --> 00:11:56.670]  Absolutely no screening for immigrants.
[00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.710]  This is Senator Murphy, Chris Murphy.
[00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:05.952]  He suggested having a discussion about a pathway in which there is absolutely no screening for immigrants entering the U.S.
[00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:09.073]  citing visa waiver agreements between the U.S.
[00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:12.533]  and Europe to demonstrate the ability of people to enter the U.S.
[00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:15.174]  without almost any security vet.
[00:12:15.954 --> 00:12:19.836]  And this is what President Trump has been saying even there on the campaign trail.
[00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.477]  It's the extreme vetting we have.
[00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:24.558]  The vetting process we have here is completely incompetent.
[00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:38.665]  In fact, Obama banned the importation of refugees from Iraq in 2011 for six months because it turns out that they had some people with jihadist connections slipped through this vetting process.
[00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:39.706]  It was porous.
[00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:44.008]  And that's an argument that people are trying to make is that the vetting process is not porous.
[00:12:44.048 --> 00:12:45.508]  These jihadists are not slipping through.
[00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:46.829]  But it did happen.
[00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:52.512]  Six months they were banned from by the Obama administration from coming from Iraq.
[00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:54.433]  So this is nothing new.
[00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:58.935]  But it's only racist when it's a Republican or President Trump.
[00:12:58.975 --> 00:13:05.798]  Because let's all recall Sunday when Chuck Schumer was crocodile tears coming out of his eyes.
[00:13:06.678 --> 00:13:13.600]  Calling President Trump's mean-spirited and un-American executive order temporarily stopping the flow of refugees into the U.S.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.721]  Oh, he's crying so sad.
[00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:16.921]  The snake.
[00:13:17.602 --> 00:13:18.962]  But just one thing.
[00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:20.683]  What do we have here?
[00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:25.964]  In 2015, Chuck Schumer suggested the exact same thing.
[00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.605]  And he actually tweeted about it.
[00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:29.766]  The internet never forgets.
[00:13:30.646 --> 00:13:34.608]  Never forgets, and we never forget, and we're going to point out your hypocrisy.
[00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:44.133]  He tweeted out, we must tighten loopholes in the visa waiver program, ensure passports can't be faked, and stop terrorists who want to exploit the system.
[00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:45.013]  That was November 19, 2015.
[00:13:48.335 --> 00:13:52.597]  He actually ruffled the feathers of some of his other Democrats who were like, no, we don't need this.
[00:13:52.637 --> 00:13:55.078]  But he doubled down, saying, we're waiting for the briefing.
[00:13:55.498 --> 00:13:57.719]  A pause may be necessary.
[00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:00.020]  My, my, how things have changed.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.261]  Refugee ban, great idea when it comes from the Democrats.
[00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:05.982]  It's just compassionate, you know, just loving.
[00:14:06.002 --> 00:14:09.144]  They just want to take care of the country and take care of their constituents.
[00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:14.246]  But with Donald Trump, it's careless, thoughtless, tyrannical, unchristian.
[00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:18.410]  Just the most terrible thing to ever happen in history.
[00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:28.941]  And also, you know, it only took him about two weeks, 11 days actually, former President Obama actually spoke out against Donald Trump.
[00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:32.285]  He issued a statement about something the current president has done.
[00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:50.709]  As President Donald Trump makes good on his campaign promises, and former President Barack Obama makes good on his backseat presidency, we can look to another former president for advice.
[00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:56.832]  Dwight Eisenhower faced a similar situation, warning in Time Magazine on October 13, 1952.
[00:14:56.892 --> 00:15:00.014]  The Bill of Rights contains no grant of privilege for a group of people to destroy
[00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.097]  Thanks for watching.
[00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:24.773]  Former President Barack Obama's spokesperson recently made this statement.
[00:15:25.113 --> 00:15:31.719]  President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country.
[00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:35.242]  Is this the kind of engagement Obama is referring to?
[00:15:35.262 --> 00:15:37.905]  You know what we need to do?
[00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:39.746]  We need to start giving f****** money.
[00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:45.592]  White people, give your f****** money, your f****** house, your f****** property.
[00:15:45.872 --> 00:15:46.633]  Liberation!
[00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:51.014]  We're all operating under white supremacy.
[00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.014]  We need to start killing people.
[00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:56.655]  First off, we need to start killing the White House.
[00:15:56.695 --> 00:15:59.435]  The White House must die.
[00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:01.776]  I am a preschool teacher.
[00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:06.797]  Teach your kids to throw that f***ing cop car in the garbage.
[00:16:07.437 --> 00:16:13.658]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.045]  I thought what she said was disgraceful to our country.
[00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:30.681]  The creeping aim of the defenders of the global flood of refugees would use their own freedoms to ultimately supplant those very freedoms as has happened in the no-go zones of Great Britain
[00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:33.102]  Sweden, France, and Germany.
[00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:42.748]  Simply put, a silent majority of Americans don't want to experience the massacres we all witnessed in Paris and Nice, France.
[00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:46.711]  This lies at the heart of national security.
[00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:50.333]  Radical Islamist cells canvassed the United States.
[00:16:50.613 --> 00:16:59.398]  Meanwhile, 2016 saw ISIS-inspired terrorism in Orlando, San Bernardino, Ohio, and New York City, and recently in 2017 in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:04.982]  This is the reality the whining left would choose to ignore.
[00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:07.244]  What is driving this war on the West?
[00:17:07.884 --> 00:17:10.987]  The Pentagon's endless wars in the Middle East.
[00:17:11.407 --> 00:17:20.594]  Not to mention, as WorldNetDaily writes, the leaders of 57 Islamic countries rejecting the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:25.936]  Forming their own group called the OIC, Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
[00:17:26.116 --> 00:17:44.861]  The OIC passed in 1990 the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, affirming Sharia law as supreme, with the death penalty for those leaving Islam, punishing women who are victims of rape, allowing men to be polygamists, permitting wife beating, and censoring speech insulting Islam.
[00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:46.662]  The total opposite to the U.S.
[00:17:46.702 --> 00:17:47.462]  Constitution.
[00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:53.363]  The leaders of Europe are lying to their own people and they know they're lying to their own people.
[00:17:53.644 --> 00:18:00.265]  This is their bride price, their Jizya tax, for becoming safe demis and keeping their power.
[00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:05.887]  Now some of them might just out and out say, I converted long ago, I'm a Muslim, fooled you.
[00:18:06.487 --> 00:18:11.668]  Or they might say, as long as I keep my palace and my villa and my estate, I don't really care.
[00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:14.529]  But their bride price, their Jizya tax,
[00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:17.451]  Is to sell out their own people.
[00:18:17.531 --> 00:18:18.892]  People need to understand this.
[00:18:19.072 --> 00:18:38.906]  By signing the executive order to put a 90-day freeze on refugees entering the United States from countries sponsoring terror, President Trump is merely activating the long overdue protection of the United States from a radical Islamic hijra, or jihad through immigration, that is currently bringing Western Europe to its knees.
[00:18:39.446 --> 00:18:44.193]  The safety and protection of the citizens of the United States is paramount.
[00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:45.595]  You want to protest?
[00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:50.963]  Protest the war machine that got us all into this mess in the first place.
[00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:53.668]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.584 --> 00:19:15.653]  Now, what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:16.854]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:18.675]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:22.337]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:51.325]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Central Texas News Center in Austin.

[00:23:05.003 --> 00:23:06.503]  Owen Schroeder with InfoWars.com.
[00:23:06.543 --> 00:23:07.404]  I'm here with Kamal.
[00:23:07.464 --> 00:23:13.805]  The Muslim State Capitol Rally just concluded here and he was telling me what he was out here doing.
[00:23:13.845 --> 00:23:15.425]  Tell me why you came out here today.
[00:23:15.465 --> 00:23:19.726]  Really just to support the organizations that arranged this event.
[00:23:22.107 --> 00:23:24.007]  The ban wasn't really the center part of it.
[00:23:24.047 --> 00:23:28.068]  I know that's kind of the highlight lately, but this event has been going on every couple of years.
[00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:38.697]  The event is really just to present the Muslim community as a peaceful, law-abiding citizen.
[00:23:38.797 --> 00:23:48.024]  It's not necessarily anything politically agenda, or push any political agendas, but, you know, that's what's kind of the highlight in the news.
[00:23:49.451 --> 00:23:49.851]  I'm guessing.
[00:23:49.871 --> 00:23:55.412]  I mean, I didn't really hear any speeches addressing the ban either, so, you know, I don't think that was really a focal point.
[00:23:55.512 --> 00:23:58.013]  What was the group that organized this that you wanted to support?
[00:23:58.933 --> 00:23:59.393]  CARE.
[00:23:59.653 --> 00:24:03.894]  It is Center for American Islamic Relations.
[00:24:03.994 --> 00:24:06.975]  Now, are you aware of the terror group in Palestine, Hamas?
[00:24:07.935 --> 00:24:09.175]  I'm aware of Hamas, yes.
[00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:10.596]  Okay, what are your thoughts on Hamas?
[00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:14.807]  You know, I know limited about it.
[00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:19.728]  All I know is, you know, Palestine is not really allowed to have its own government.
[00:24:21.929 --> 00:24:27.831]  They're not recognized as a state, as people that should have basic rights like water, etc.
[00:24:27.851 --> 00:24:35.694]  I don't know what Hamas's political agenda is, so, you know, I just would rather not comment on that.
[00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:36.134]  Okay.
[00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.734]  Now, are you a Muslim, sir?
[00:24:37.774 --> 00:24:38.535]  You identify as Muslim?
[00:24:38.675 --> 00:24:39.115]  Yes, I am.
[00:24:39.804 --> 00:24:52.613]  Okay, so, now I don't know if you're aware of this or not, or how much credence you take into this, but an FBI document was just released that determined that CARE, the Center of American Islamic Relations, is actually run by Hamas.
[00:24:52.673 --> 00:24:54.575]  Or do Hamas-CARE connections worry you at all?
[00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.468]  I didn't know if the Hamas cleared connections.
[00:24:58.509 --> 00:25:01.790]  As far as groups that want to infiltrate, I don't know if any.
[00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.353]  The biggest lie right now today is Donald Trump running this country.
[00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:18.980]  That's a fact.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.082]  The white supremacist movement.
[00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:21.943]  That's not true, sir.
[00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:22.704]  That's not true.
[00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:27.991]  You realize that Donald Trump got elected by people from all race, colors, and creeds, though.
[00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:28.532]  That's a fact.
[00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:30.094]  Would you like to go to Ohio?
[00:25:30.334 --> 00:25:31.035]  I've been to Ohio.
[00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:33.538]  I'll take you some of my family members.
[00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:35.000]  His rednecks.
[00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:36.122]  His white supremacists.
[00:25:37.034 --> 00:25:40.438]  Okay, so that's one group of people that you're calling white supremacists.
[00:25:40.458 --> 00:25:41.839]  They're all over the country.
[00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:42.560]  Am I a white supremacist?
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.161]  No, sir.
[00:25:43.361 --> 00:25:44.963]  Okay, so I voted for Trump.
[00:25:45.163 --> 00:25:46.925]  So, sir, you were out here.
[00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:48.167]  Are you a Muslim American, sir?
[00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:49.008]  Yes.
[00:25:49.328 --> 00:25:50.790]  And you're also a Vietnam veteran, I see.
[00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.190]  Yes.
[00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.792]  So tell me, what brought you out here today?
[00:25:54.373 --> 00:26:01.619]  What brought me out here is that, let's say like, you know, the Muslims have in the past, okay, been let's say like, you know, silent.
[00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:06.123]  And that has been, let's say like, one of the things that the media is aware of the Muslims.
[00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:11.628]  So we are here, you know, to show our presence and to meet with the legislators.
[00:26:12.168 --> 00:26:14.992]  Do you think that Muslim-American relations need improvement?
[00:26:15.293 --> 00:26:16.495]  Do you mind?
[00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:17.316]  We can walk and talk.
[00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:18.297]  Is that alright?
[00:26:18.498 --> 00:26:19.439]  Okay, we'll walk and talk.
[00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:20.921]  My cameraman can walk and talk.
[00:26:21.082 --> 00:26:26.530]  So what do you think, what kind of improvements can be made with the Muslim-Americans and the rest of the Americans?
[00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.551]  Do you think there's some problems there?
[00:26:28.012 --> 00:26:29.974]  Well, yes, definitely there is.
[00:26:30.654 --> 00:26:34.197]  And I think we are misunderstood.
[00:26:34.758 --> 00:26:43.005]  Everyone, let's say a few, let's say like, you know, of the incidents that are here, all Muslims are lumped together.
[00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.992]  How do people distinguish?
[00:26:47.392 --> 00:26:48.913]  What do we do to try to distinguish?
[00:26:48.953 --> 00:26:51.515]  Because Muslim Americans, I believe, are good people.
[00:26:51.635 --> 00:26:53.596]  All these people out here, they're not bad people.
[00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:56.138]  How do we mend these relations?
[00:26:56.979 --> 00:27:02.503]  Well, you know, there are lots of positive news about the Muslims.
[00:27:03.403 --> 00:27:07.684]  Do you think there's any aspect of radical Islam that's a threat?
[00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:24.889]  No.
[00:27:25.129 --> 00:27:25.589]  Thank you very much.
[00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:27.310]  There's no such thing as Islamic terror though?
[00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.530]  Thank you very much.
[00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:29.551]  Okay guys, thank you.
[00:27:29.591 --> 00:27:30.691]  Thank you for your service too, sir.
[00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:34.753]  Why did, why did Trump, and by the way, I voted for Trump.
[00:27:35.113 --> 00:27:44.356]  I voted for Trump because I thought that he wanted to tackle some of the serious issues and tackle terrorism and the source and who creates it, who fund it, and who trains it.
[00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:45.716]  I like that, I agree with that.
[00:27:45.816 --> 00:27:47.477]  Why did he exclude Saudi Arabia?
[00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:50.239]  Why did he exclude the United Arab Emirates?
[00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:51.059]  Because they're rich.
[00:27:51.439 --> 00:27:52.520]  That's why I'm disappointed.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.240]  That's a fair point.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:02.506]  I'm very disappointed in him because now he leaves himself open to criticism and also how he is following the law.
[00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:04.207]  I think that's an excellent point, sir.
[00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:09.750]  If he's following Rudy Giuliani's little New York, you know, agenda, then he's wrong.
[00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.930]  He jumped too quick.
[00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:12.691]  I'm from the country of Jordan.
[00:28:12.972 --> 00:28:13.432]  Jordan.
[00:28:14.653 --> 00:28:15.253]  Repeat that one.
[00:28:15.956 --> 00:28:19.119]  I lived with my Christian brothers for all my life, when I was young.
[00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:20.299]  All through my life.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.280]  We're all brothers.
[00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:24.182]  I never asked them, why are you going to church?
[00:28:24.423 --> 00:28:25.423]  Or he asked me, why are you going?
[00:28:25.463 --> 00:28:26.904]  I didn't go to the mosque when I was young, you know.
[00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.846]  But, you know, why do you go to the mosque?
[00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:29.647]  Why are you a Muslim?
[00:28:29.947 --> 00:28:30.707]  We live like brothers.
[00:28:30.807 --> 00:28:38.893]  To this day, and I'm 56 years old, and they are, to this day, when he sees one of my brothers, he says, where's my brother?
[00:28:38.994 --> 00:28:39.414]  Is he back?
[00:28:39.554 --> 00:28:40.215]  Did he come by?
[00:28:40.355 --> 00:28:43.077]  Tell him to come by and stop and say, why we can't have that?
[00:28:43.717 --> 00:28:43.857]  Why?
[00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:52.642]  Our Constitution, the Founding Fathers, if we go back to everything they wrote in the book for us and live by that, we'll be fine.
[00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:54.484]  But you got bad people?
[00:28:54.644 --> 00:28:55.264]  Let's deal with them!
[00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:56.586]  Together!
[00:28:56.866 --> 00:28:59.408]  Together, I'm going to be the first one to help you deal with a person.
[00:28:59.948 --> 00:29:04.352]  You know, a lot of people who get trained and get the funding, we know where they go.
[00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:05.513]  I know where they go.
[00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:07.735]  Everybody knows where they go, where they get their training and funding.
[00:29:07.975 --> 00:29:08.596]  Let's tackle that.
[00:29:09.298 --> 00:29:10.018]  Let's tackle that.
[00:29:10.098 --> 00:29:11.539]  I'm very disappointed in Trump.
[00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:12.740]  I'm very disappointed.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.980]  This is my first disappointment.
[00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:16.502]  You want to vet these people right?
[00:29:16.742 --> 00:29:17.262]  Vet them right.
[00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:19.163]  Let's establish some mechanisms in place.
[00:29:19.203 --> 00:29:21.364]  Let's put some rules in place.
[00:29:21.884 --> 00:29:23.605]  Let's check the background.
[00:29:23.645 --> 00:29:24.926]  Let's check where everybody comes from.
[00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:29.908]  Let's make sure that nobody trains them somewhere and they're going to just sit here and do something down the road.
[00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:31.649]  I don't want them to do something to my children.
[00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:33.430]  I have five-year-olds, six-year-olds and eight-year-olds.
[00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.650]  I don't want them to do anything to my children.
[00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.752]  Same thing for you and Alex and everybody else, you know?
[00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:43.235]  We want to deal with this reality, but there are ways to deal with that.
[00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:46.097]  It's unfortunate that everybody blames everybody.
[00:29:46.377 --> 00:29:50.079]  You know, they want to blame everything in liberal media.
[00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:52.781]  Conservative media blames liberal media.
[00:29:52.801 --> 00:29:54.602]  Liberal media blames conservative media.
[00:29:55.122 --> 00:29:55.822]  It shouldn't be that.
[00:29:56.082 --> 00:29:58.044]  I mean, yeah, some media are liberal.
[00:29:58.224 --> 00:29:59.364]  Some media are conservative.
[00:29:59.544 --> 00:30:00.345]  That's their choice.
[00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:05.168]  They want to report things, positive things about, you know, that's fine.
[00:30:05.268 --> 00:30:06.168]  That's their thing.
[00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:07.289]  I didn't like Hillary.
[00:30:07.819 --> 00:30:09.219]  I never liked her.
[00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:11.720]  They should have put Bernie Sanders and he would have won.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.680]  But I don't like anybody who hides stuff.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.621]  I don't like it.
[00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:20.081]  And I think Hillary could be a lot to blame for all the struggle in the Middle East.
[00:30:20.622 --> 00:30:22.422]  And she's to blame for the DNC problems.
[00:30:22.962 --> 00:30:23.602]  Not just for that.
[00:30:23.962 --> 00:30:26.443]  It's self-destruct and now they have to rebuild.
[00:30:26.803 --> 00:30:27.363]  The same thing.
[00:30:27.663 --> 00:30:29.143]  Our community, we have to rebuild.
[00:30:29.543 --> 00:30:37.325]  I always tell people from my community, from anybody, from anywhere, we have to cleanse the L's inside before you can tackle the L's outside.
[00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:48.975]  Now, would you say, because you said you brought these issues to light before, you've even mentioned this to people that have political influence, would you say that your voice is just unheard, or just not respected, or why do you think it doesn't get through?
[00:30:49.995 --> 00:30:56.018]  No, I don't think they understand quickly what I mean and what I'm talking about, and they don't understand the background.
[00:30:56.078 --> 00:31:02.080]  If I could sit down with somebody for an hour, they're going to walk out scratching their head and saying, man, this person should be
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.383]  One of President Obama or whoever's senior advisor sitting right over there.
[00:31:07.403 --> 00:31:14.067]  I talked to a gentleman back overseas in Iraq in the days and he was a retired colonel with the Marines.
[00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:17.829]  He was a consultant to the ambassadors and he helped establish a lot of things there.
[00:31:18.329 --> 00:31:19.790]  And he was always baffled by it.
[00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.431]  Man, he said, you came to this country when you were 17?
[00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.112]  I said, yeah.
[00:31:23.952 --> 00:31:26.673]  How do you know about America more than 75% of Americans?
[00:31:27.033 --> 00:31:31.334]  And you still appreciate the actual privilege of being free here.
[00:31:32.215 --> 00:31:32.655]  Exactly.
[00:31:32.775 --> 00:31:33.395]  You appreciate it.
[00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:34.555]  And I want my children to appreciate it.
[00:31:34.696 --> 00:31:35.956]  But I don't want them to forget their roots.
[00:31:36.356 --> 00:31:37.596]  I want them to keep up with their roots.
[00:31:37.837 --> 00:31:38.877]  Everybody has to have roots.
[00:31:39.117 --> 00:31:40.257]  You've got to know your ancestors.
[00:31:40.497 --> 00:31:41.558]  He's got to know his ancestors.
[00:31:41.738 --> 00:31:42.858]  Alex's got to know his ancestors.
[00:31:42.878 --> 00:31:47.440]  Everybody's got to know his ancestors, where you come from, so you can keep it going.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.240]  That's how to be proud.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.621]  What are you going to be proud of if you don't have any ancestors?
[00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:52.642]  Well, thank you so much for your time.
[00:31:52.662 --> 00:31:53.523]  That was very powerful.
[00:31:54.023 --> 00:31:55.965]  We need more people willing to talk like you, sir.
[00:31:56.145 --> 00:31:56.705]  We really do.
[00:31:56.725 --> 00:31:59.648]  We'll do.
[00:31:59.908 --> 00:32:05.352]  And he raises a point that is very important that I don't hear anyone else raise out here that is totally fair.
[00:32:05.853 --> 00:32:07.954]  Why no issue with Saudi Arabia?
[00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:10.977]  Saudi Arabia is responsible for terrorism.
[00:32:11.297 --> 00:32:12.899]  Saudi Arabia is oppressing women.
[00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:19.084]  Saudi Arabia has 300,000 tents that could house a million refugees.
[00:32:19.345 --> 00:32:19.825]  And guess what?
[00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:25.470]  Saudi Arabia is actually close to these regions where civil war is tearing these places apart.
[00:32:25.971 --> 00:32:27.472]  Oh, you know what else has happened?
[00:32:27.932 --> 00:32:32.717]  The Saudi Arabian prince flew 80 of his pet birds on a flight.
[00:32:33.257 --> 00:32:34.818]  You don't think you could put refugees on there?
[00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:38.000]  So, again, this is the kind of conversation we need to have, folks.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.603]  As you've seen here, out in the streets, some people don't want to talk to me, some people do want to talk to me.
[00:32:42.663 --> 00:32:46.365]  When I do talk to people like that, it's powerful, we come to truths, we come together.
[00:32:46.665 --> 00:32:55.571]  But, of course, when you want to avoid conversation and confrontation, you'll never come together, you will always remain divided, and you will always remain confused, and, most of the time, in a world of lies.
[00:32:55.871 --> 00:32:57.732]  Owen Schroeder for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.374]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:50.295]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:50.295]  $200.
[00:36:51.455 --> 00:36:54.396]  Go check out all their different products at infowarrestore.com.
[00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:55.236]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.181]  Tonight, we're going to discuss the truth about Oprah Winfrey.
[00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.271]  She's a beautiful, talented woman.
[00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:22.916]  But for decades, she has met secretly with David Rockefeller, Bill Gates, and others.
[00:37:24.488 --> 00:37:34.636]  To promote a world government program that is designed to reduce the African population alone by at least 50%.
[00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:41.702]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people.
[00:37:42.062 --> 00:37:44.424]  Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey.
[00:37:44.785 --> 00:37:48.648]  It was like, well, it was like... The Super Friends.
[00:37:49.463 --> 00:37:54.347]  In the great hall of the Justice League, there are assembled the world's four greatest heroes.
[00:37:54.667 --> 00:38:02.853]  Together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, they're worth more than 125 billion dollars.
[00:38:03.453 --> 00:38:09.578]  That much money, that much power around one table, it begs the question, what were they doing?
[00:38:09.738 --> 00:38:11.099]  What were they scheming?
[00:38:11.419 --> 00:38:12.800]  Total world domination?
[00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:16.082]  It's been said millions of times,
[00:38:17.043 --> 00:38:21.686]  That truth is stranger than fiction and that's been said because it's true.
[00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:44.142]  You look at somebody like Oprah Winfrey who has all this talent and all this empathy and who can convince you to trust her and then you research who she works for and who bankrolled her and it's so nightmarish that you're pinching yourself thinking it's a nightmare and that you should wake up.
[00:38:45.728 --> 00:38:52.490]  When I saw her in the news in the last few days being announced as a contributor to 60 Minutes, it was a perfect fit.
[00:38:53.790 --> 00:39:01.312]  60 Minutes, this deceptive, so-called investigative news magazine that selectively investigates what it wants and ignores the rest.
[00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:09.934]  But look at Oprah Winfrey and her, you get a car and you get a car and all of her, the secret stuff and her programs.
[00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:36.304]  That are so little known in this country, to promote like a world religion, Christianoid garbage in Africa, and to indoctrinate African children through her program with Bill and Melinda Gates and others, like David Rockefeller, to teach Africans that they can't have a car, they can't have air conditioning, and that they shouldn't even have children because they don't have value.
[00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:41.116]  Imagine if you heard that from a white supremacist.
[00:39:42.278 --> 00:39:43.420]  You wouldn't even be able to believe it.
[00:39:45.009 --> 00:39:47.291]  But much less from Oprah Winfrey.
[00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:49.293]  And that's why she pushes it.
[00:39:50.113 --> 00:39:52.335]  She's the black face on the New World Order.
[00:39:52.715 --> 00:39:54.417]  She's the woman that was behind Obama.
[00:39:54.777 --> 00:40:00.122]  She's the one that puts her billions of dollars into tax-free foundations so they can't be taxed.
[00:40:00.282 --> 00:40:01.703]  Just like Bill Gates.
[00:40:02.323 --> 00:40:04.325]  Just like his wife, Melinda Gates.
[00:40:04.966 --> 00:40:06.907]  Just like Warren Buffett and others.
[00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:09.349]  So I want to challenge all of you.
[00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:16.215]  To do research into the weird world government Luciferian system she pushes.
[00:40:17.296 --> 00:40:23.442]  And to go read for yourself ABC News, The London Guardian and others that did whitewashes.
[00:40:25.436 --> 00:40:31.181]  On the fact that she's trying to set up a world government to reduce populations.
[00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:34.944]  Listen, once people become industrialized, they stop having as many children.
[00:40:35.184 --> 00:40:36.646]  In fact, they start going negative.
[00:40:36.666 --> 00:40:38.007]  1.3, 1.4 children for every two adults.
[00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:51.341]  But to sell Africa and the rest of the third world that they're ugly and they don't have value, that it's beautiful and wonderful for them to just roll over and die is truly sick.
[00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:59.390]  Now realize the globalists are conditioning the third world to flood the United States and Europe and to be very anti-Caucasian, anti-white.
[00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:09.875]  Just because a lot of them have been brainwashed and turned into political zombies of globalist conquest doesn't mean we stoop to that level of programmed people.
[00:41:10.515 --> 00:41:15.017]  We realize they're victims and stand up for the truth and stand up for justice.
[00:41:15.882 --> 00:41:19.166]  But please, we're just showing you a few news articles here today.
[00:41:19.747 --> 00:41:22.330]  Research her tax exemption.
[00:41:22.831 --> 00:41:28.958]  Research the globalism, the UN, what she's involved in, and the secret society meeting she's having.
[00:41:29.779 --> 00:41:32.923]  Deciding the fate of you and I. Because make no mistake,
[00:41:33.484 --> 00:41:43.792]  They can have their way with poor Africans and Latin Americans and Asians, but here in the Western world they are hiding by stealth, by Trojan horse, their attacks on the general public.
[00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:51.497]  The chemicals in the food and water, the estrogen mimickers, the cancer rates, the autism exploding, all the secret testing that's been declassified.
[00:41:51.938 --> 00:41:53.879]  Why would we trust anything these people do?
[00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:56.321]  And then there's the beautiful
[00:41:58.081 --> 00:41:58.802]  Shining face.
[00:41:58.842 --> 00:41:59.662]  She's a beautiful woman.
[00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:01.023]  She's got great spirit.
[00:42:01.223 --> 00:42:05.426]  She's smart, but she joined with the wicked to control the people.
[00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:08.829]  Now listen to me and listen carefully.
[00:42:09.649 --> 00:42:10.890]  There's no way I'm wrong.
[00:42:12.331 --> 00:42:15.013]  I wouldn't accuse her of things like this if it wasn't true.
[00:42:16.014 --> 00:42:16.654]  I don't do that.
[00:42:16.894 --> 00:42:17.775]  I've done the research.
[00:42:18.295 --> 00:42:24.320]  Oprah Winfrey meets in secret with the most evil men and women in the world every year.
[00:42:25.399 --> 00:42:32.180]  And has given talking points to push on her audience to convince them that they're bad and should roll over and die.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:40.342]  She is planning my future and your future and your children's future with the most twisted people this planet's ever seen.
[00:42:40.602 --> 00:42:41.442]  And that's a fact.
[00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:46.063]  And she needs to go public and release all the information she knows.
[00:42:46.783 --> 00:42:48.283]  I don't want to hate Oprah Winfrey.
[00:42:48.403 --> 00:42:49.883]  I don't want to fear Oprah Winfrey.
[00:42:50.543 --> 00:42:53.024]  I don't want to sit here and expose Oprah Winfrey.
[00:42:54.966 --> 00:42:57.487]  My guts, my soul, my spirit tells me it's got to be done.
[00:42:58.287 --> 00:43:02.949]  God, Oprah, you claim you're here to free the people, but you just turned into a slave master.
[00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:04.670]  What have you done?
[00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:16.995]  The truth about Oprah Winfrey is, whether she's conscious of it or not, she is serving pure anti-human evil, wickedness, corruption.
[00:43:18.473 --> 00:43:19.454]  Go do your own research.
[00:43:19.494 --> 00:43:23.777]  The rabbit hole is so much deeper than I can break down here in the short presentation.
[00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:37.247]  But everything she sells is magical thinking to a group of disenfranchised, manless women sitting at home, desperate for a family, desperate for life, desperate for a culture.
[00:43:38.288 --> 00:43:44.893]  She's all part of the great society that started in the 60s and took black illegitimacy from about 5% to almost 80%.
[00:43:46.154 --> 00:43:47.715]  And now you see it in every other group of people.
[00:43:49.687 --> 00:43:53.529]  The state is being put in charge of the family.
[00:43:54.089 --> 00:44:01.833]  The family's being dismantled and women are being given the system as their husband for protection and being taught from birth that men are their enemy.
[00:44:02.993 --> 00:44:09.616]  This is an attack on our species and Oprah Winfrey is nothing but a Judas goat.
[00:44:11.457 --> 00:44:17.880]  Nothing but someone sent out there with a pretty face and a nice smile to sell us on cultural death.
[00:44:19.232 --> 00:44:31.780]  Oprah Winfrey, whether she knows it or not, is probably one of the greatest incarnations of the devil we see on this planet today.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.642]  Because Hillary Clinton is hunchbacked, evil, and twisted.
[00:44:35.262 --> 00:44:36.643]  David Rockefeller looks like a mummy.
[00:44:37.584 --> 00:44:39.805]  Henry Kissinger looks like a snot-nosed goblin.
[00:44:40.205 --> 00:44:42.707]  But Oprah Winfrey, even at her age, has a life force.
[00:44:43.027 --> 00:44:43.548]  She's strong.
[00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:44.748]  She's got some real beauty.
[00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:48.571]  That's why she's the shining light they use to lead you towards death.
[00:44:49.957 --> 00:44:55.180]  Do not be deceived for Lucifer parades as an angel of light.
[00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:00.284]  She better get her soul right with God.
[00:45:01.224 --> 00:45:05.227]  There's no way she could shine the way she does and not have some true good left in her.
[00:45:06.067 --> 00:45:08.829]  I think Oprah Winfrey may be the most deceived of us all.
[00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.872]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWarp.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.663]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:45:18.803 --> 00:45:20.364]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:45:35.455 --> 00:45:37.335]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:45:37.955 --> 00:45:43.516]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:45:44.097 --> 00:45:52.498]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:45:52.518 --> 00:45:54.559]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:56.039]  This is the best system out there.
[00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:59.059]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:00.060]  This is how it works.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:00.880]  You order.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.780]  Customized or
[00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:04.369]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:07.992]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:46:08.293 --> 00:46:12.357]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:46:12.577 --> 00:46:13.358]  You cannot lose.
[00:46:13.378 --> 00:46:14.479]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:46:14.779 --> 00:46:21.546]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:25.811]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes!
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.061]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.081 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:10.392]  Joining us now is John Kiriakou.
[00:49:10.632 --> 00:49:14.693]  He is somebody who exposed the Bush-era torture program.
[00:49:15.194 --> 00:49:17.334]  He paid a very heavy personal price.
[00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:21.336]  He's a CIA, former CIA agent, of 14 years experience.
[00:49:21.776 --> 00:49:24.097]  He had, and let me just tell you, some of the awards that he had there.
[00:49:24.117 --> 00:49:26.418]  That's his website there, JohnKiriakou.com.
[00:49:26.898 --> 00:49:35.221]  He got 10 exceptional performance awards, a sustained superior performance award, a counterterrorism service medal, State Department meritorious honor, many other awards.
[00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:36.142]  I'm not going to go through all of them.
[00:49:37.202 --> 00:49:40.165]  He won, in 2016, the Sam Adams Award.
[00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:45.249]  He's won a lot of awards for standing for liberty since he exposed this, since he paid the price.
[00:49:45.409 --> 00:49:49.753]  He is the only person who was jailed for these torture activities.
[00:49:50.433 --> 00:49:53.936]  Not the torturers who violated the law, and it was against the law.
[00:49:53.956 --> 00:49:55.137]  We're going to talk to him about that.
[00:49:56.158 --> 00:50:01.523]  Back in 2007, he was the first CIA official to confirm waterboarding.
[00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:06.327]  He was jailed, ostensibly, for revealing the identity of a CIA official.
[00:50:06.347 --> 00:50:12.812]  We're going to talk about that, though, because that comes to the persecution, the double standards that we see.
[00:50:12.852 --> 00:50:13.873]  We're going to cover all that.
[00:50:14.613 --> 00:50:17.496]  He is also a speaker, author, and, of course, a whistleblower.
[00:50:17.576 --> 00:50:22.220]  His books in 2012, he wrote Reluctant Spy, My Secret Life in the CIA's War on Terror.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:31.949]  And he's got a new book that's coming up based on his time in prison, Doing Time Like a Spy, How the CIA Taught Me to Survive and Thrive in Prison.
[00:50:32.009 --> 00:50:33.190]  So we're going to talk to him about that.
[00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.653]  But first up, we want to talk about waterboarding.
[00:50:35.893 --> 00:50:36.974]  Welcome, John.
[00:50:37.214 --> 00:50:38.155]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:50:38.355 --> 00:50:40.357]  And you have our gratitude, all those who
[00:50:41.398 --> 00:50:54.362]  Uphold liberty who believe that we ought to be a nation of high ethical and legal moral standards We all applaud what you did for exposing what happened in that dark period that we had Of waterboarding and we hope that's not going to be repeated.
[00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:58.383]  Thank you so much I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be with you today.
[00:50:58.563 --> 00:51:09.986]  I really appreciate you having me well Thank you You know one of the things that you said and the many interviews that you've done you said you think and this is going back to 2007 when this first broke with Brian Ross ten years ago and
[00:51:10.566 --> 00:51:10.826]  You said,
[00:51:25.523 --> 00:51:31.928]  He says he supports waterboarding, but he also says at the same time he's going to defer to James Mattis.
[00:51:31.968 --> 00:51:39.073]  He's picked as Secretary of Defense, who says he does not think that it is effective or a policy that we should pursue.
[00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:45.178]  So I think this is something that, as Piers Morgan has talked about, he's a person who knows Donald Trump personally.
[00:51:45.678 --> 00:51:47.940]  He says you can have disagreements with him.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.901]  And he'll listen to those disagreements.
[00:51:49.921 --> 00:51:52.663]  We see that in the appointment that he made with General Mattis.
[00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:58.407]  He says he'll listen to you as long as you don't just stand there and shout at him, you're a monster.
[00:51:58.427 --> 00:52:11.075]  So we want to have this kind of conversation, not just for President Trump, but for President Trump supporters who listen to what he has to say and say, these guys play really dirty, maybe we need to get down at their level and fight with them.
[00:52:11.115 --> 00:52:11.856]  What do you say to that?
[00:52:12.754 --> 00:52:15.915]  I say that reasonable people can agree to disagree about this.
[00:52:16.416 --> 00:52:23.078]  And if you want to get down and dirty, if you want to reinstate a torture program, then change the law.
[00:52:23.539 --> 00:52:25.820]  Because torture is illegal in this country.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:33.923]  And furthermore, with this exception that we saw during the George W. Bush administration, torture has always been illegal in this country.
[00:52:34.343 --> 00:52:34.403]  In 1946,
[00:52:36.244 --> 00:52:41.166]  We executed Japanese soldiers who waterboarded American prisoners of war.
[00:52:41.206 --> 00:52:41.986]  Now imagine that.
[00:52:42.286 --> 00:52:46.108]  In 1946, waterboarding was an executable offense.
[00:52:46.408 --> 00:52:47.088]  Yes.
[00:52:47.448 --> 00:52:51.950]  In 1968, the Washington Post ran a front page photograph
[00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.451]  Well, the law hasn't changed since 1946 or 1968.
[00:53:14.651 --> 00:53:15.472]  We've changed.
[00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:21.235]  So if we want to have this debate, I think a debate is a great thing for our democracy.
[00:53:21.675 --> 00:53:25.938]  We should have this debate because like I said, reasonable people can agree to disagree.
[00:53:26.378 --> 00:53:30.761]  But as things stand now, torture is illegal and it shouldn't be done.
[00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:38.906]  Well, you know, the interesting thing is, and we saw the CIA do this, intelligence services do this, they always change the language, don't they?
[00:53:38.946 --> 00:53:42.489]  So they don't call it torture, they call it an enhanced interrogation technique.
[00:53:42.849 --> 00:53:49.694]  So when you change the language and you come up with this bureaucratic double-speak, then they can say, well, we're not violating the law.
[00:53:49.714 --> 00:53:52.436]  So we have to understand what is involved here.
[00:53:52.876 --> 00:53:55.318]  And I want you to break this down for us, because you were
[00:53:56.759 --> 00:54:07.929]  You led a team that captured the first significant Al-Qaeda individual, the suspect at the time, and he was waterboarded 83 times.
[00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.690]  Tell us about that.
[00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.273]  Tell us about the capture and tell us about the interrogation.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:25.207]  Yes, this was Abu Zubaydah, who was a Palestinian born in Saudi Arabia, and who the CIA believed at the time, this was 2002, we believed that he was the number three ranking person inside Al Qaeda.
[00:54:25.467 --> 00:54:29.849]  That turned out to not be correct, but he was a bad guy nonetheless.
[00:54:30.389 --> 00:54:38.853]  So we knew that Abu Zubaydah was somewhere in Pakistan, and we were able to narrow down his possible location to 14 separate sites.
[00:54:40.234 --> 00:54:43.157]  So, a lot of planning goes into something like this.
[00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:49.704]  We had never done more than two raids simultaneously before, since the September 11th attacks.
[00:54:50.105 --> 00:54:54.189]  So we flew in a big team from Washington, half CIA, half FBI.
[00:54:54.609 --> 00:54:57.272]  We had the Pakistani military there with us.
[00:54:57.632 --> 00:55:01.436]  And let's just say this was in 2002, so this is very soon after September 11th.
[00:55:02.017 --> 00:55:02.397]  That's right.
[00:55:02.417 --> 00:55:27.602]  Very soon after September 11th, this was March the 28th, 2002, we hit 14 simultaneous sites and caught, I'm not allowed to say the exact number of Al Qaeda fighters we caught, but it was many dozens of Al Qaeda fighters, including Abu Zubaydah and including a man who was the commander of the Darunta training camp, Al Qaeda's training camp in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
[00:55:27.962 --> 00:55:31.423]  So this was a major counterterrorism success that we had.
[00:55:32.165 --> 00:55:33.906]  So tell us about his condition.
[00:55:33.926 --> 00:55:35.247]  I understand he was shot?
[00:55:36.308 --> 00:55:53.200]  Yeah, when we began beating down the door of Abu Zubaydah's safe house, he and two colleagues, a Syrian bomb maker and a Syrian bodyguard, ran to the roof of the house and then began trying to leap to the roof of the neighboring house to try to escape.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.662]  There was a Pakistani policeman on the ground.
[00:55:56.162 --> 00:55:57.082]  We're good to go.
[00:56:22.072 --> 00:56:24.494]  Just enough so that he didn't bleed to death.
[00:56:24.755 --> 00:56:29.559]  And we asked the Pakistani Air Force to send us a helicopter.
[00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:32.582]  They landed the copter in the hospital parking lot.
[00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:37.767]  We loaded Abu Zubaydah onto the helicopter and took him to a nearby military base.
[00:56:38.287 --> 00:56:41.770]  I spent the first 56 hours of his captivity with him.
[00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:43.952]  I tore up a sheet and tied him to the bed.
[00:56:44.992 --> 00:56:51.054]  And he was in a coma the first 24 hours, so all I did was just sort of sit there and stare at him.
[00:56:51.534 --> 00:57:00.758]  Finally, he came out of the coma, and the first thing he asked was for me to kill him, to smother him with a pillow, because he was afraid of what was going to happen.
[00:57:01.638 --> 00:57:07.663]  He calmed down eventually, and we had a couple of conversations about Islam versus Christianity.
[00:57:07.703 --> 00:57:09.024]  He asked if I was a Christian.
[00:57:09.064 --> 00:57:09.965]  I said that I was.
[00:57:10.986 --> 00:57:14.709]  He told me that he did not want to attack the United States on September 11th.
[00:57:14.749 --> 00:57:19.053]  He wanted to attack Israel, but that bin Laden had overruled him.
[00:57:20.434 --> 00:57:22.636]  And he was really concerned about what was going to happen.
[00:57:22.796 --> 00:57:23.516]  And I said, listen,
[00:57:24.517 --> 00:57:26.318]  I'm going to give you one piece of advice.
[00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:31.181]  I said, I am the nicest guy that you're going to meet in this experience.
[00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:34.123]  My colleagues are not as nice as I am.
[00:57:34.723 --> 00:57:38.145]  So if you do one thing, it's that you have to cooperate.
[00:57:39.225 --> 00:57:45.069]  And he said, you seem like a nice man, but you're the enemy, and I'll never cooperate.
[00:57:46.138 --> 00:57:47.079]  I said suit yourself!
[00:57:58.309 --> 00:58:02.650]  Carried him on a gurney and put him on the plane and he took off.
[00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:10.191]  He went to a secret location, a secret prison, where he was allowed to recover until the summer.
[00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:13.552]  It took him about six weeks before he was healthy enough to be interviewed.
[00:58:14.212 --> 00:58:19.193]  And at first, an FBI agent by the name of Ali Soufan began to interrogate him.
[00:58:19.753 --> 00:58:26.414]  Now, Ali was a terrific FBI agent and a seasoned and practiced interrogator.
[00:58:27.114 --> 00:58:36.693]  He actually was making inroads with Abu Zubaydah, inroads that allowed him to collect actionable intelligence to disrupt attacks and save American lives.
[00:58:37.395 --> 00:58:38.857]  But it's a slow process.
[00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:45.957]  And that was just a little taste of David Knight's interview with John Kiriakou, CIA whistleblower.
[00:58:45.997 --> 00:58:51.404]  We're going to be bringing you even more from that interview on tomorrow night's Nightly News, so stay tuned for that.
[00:58:51.484 --> 00:58:53.847]  And thank you all so much for tuning in to the show tonight.
[00:58:54.308 --> 00:58:56.370]  We will see you here again tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:56.711]  Central.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.123]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
