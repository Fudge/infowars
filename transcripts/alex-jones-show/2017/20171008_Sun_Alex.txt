[00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:18.329]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:39.804]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:41.225]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:41.826]  We're live.
[00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:43.007]  It's Sunday.
[00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:45.594]  October 8th, 2017.
[00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:55.263]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, as we are every Sunday, from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:55.303 --> 00:01:03.491]  Well, last Sunday I said mass shootings were imminent in America, and it would be used to go after the Second Amendment and American freedoms.
[00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:09.097]  And now we've seen the attack take place, and the picture is incredibly clear.
[00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:29.316]  We have multiple gunmen, the acoustics are 100% clear, the witnesses a half mile away at other hotels saw people being shot, saw glass, saw shell casings, saw police taking out whoever it was shooting, and you can hear in the first few minutes that there's multiple firearms going off from different distances.
[00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:31.877]  There's cab driver footage that we're going to play.
[00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:33.839]  Now why is this so important?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.602]  Because it tells us the official story is not true.
[00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:49.502]  Mainstream media makes all these jokes, and that's why they don't have any viewers or listeners, and they say, oh, Jones claims he talks to Navy SEALs.
[00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:52.344]  He claims he talks to Delta Force people.
[00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:54.445]  He claims he talks to Green Berets.
[00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.167]  He claims he talked to the hostage rescue team.
[00:01:58.007 --> 00:01:59.088]  I don't claim anything.
[00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:08.635]  I have laid out the facts, and our history of having whistleblower, top-notch, top-shelf information is sterling.
[00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.998]  But it isn't about how we're right or how we're wrong.
[00:02:11.558 --> 00:02:12.459]  It's about the issue.
[00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:17.717]  Joining us, Craig Sawyer.
[00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.079]  He doesn't like me talking about what he did to the Navy SEALs.
[00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.421]  He was a leader in SEAL Team 6, not the commander of the whole SEAL Team 6.
[00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:26.963]  He's got shows on History Channel, Discovery Channel.
[00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:28.624]  He's very, very highly respected.
[00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.125]  He's one of the top marksmen in the world.
[00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:35.029]  And he says, clearly, there's overlapping fire.
[00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:35.950]  It's not echoes.
[00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.812]  But we've got video where
[00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:48.278]  The cab driver hears bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-b
[00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:14.977]  And the media goes, oh, Jones claims he has these people, when I've had some of them on the broadcast!
[00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:26.206]  So Craig's joining us in 30 minutes, because this is so central, and so important, because some can say, well, it's a diversion from the overall story of his Middle Eastern connections.
[00:03:26.587 --> 00:03:30.790]  I understand that it's not the central issue, but if you can prove this wrong, you can prove it all wrong.
[00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.613]  And I understand they're not trying to create a panic here, so that's why they're telling people this.
[00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:38.957]  Back in the 70s and stuff, when you had a lot of terror attacks, they wouldn't even hardly report them on the news.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.163]  That's a tactic if you're not trying to use terror to freak people out and take their rights.
[00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:49.026]  Since the 90s and through that, they started using terror to take our rights.
[00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:52.809]  Some of it's synthetic, some of it manufactured, some of it false flags, a lot of it real.
[00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.370]  They started hyping it up!
[00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:03.744]  But when the old policy was, you don't talk about it, you don't make a big deal about it, and you don't give who did it credit, because that's what they want, is credit.
[00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:07.325]  And ISIS, a bunch of them, hundreds of them just gave up today.
[00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:08.806]  Thousands in the last week.
[00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.987]  They're only in a few cities left in the Middle East.
[00:04:11.047 --> 00:04:14.728]  I mean, they have been crushed by our military and Trump cleaning up Obama's mess.
[00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:22.331]  So I get you don't want to give them this big victory and just say, well, it's, we don't know who did it.
[00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.739]  But that's, that's, that's not the truth!
[00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.022]  And we're not running wartime propaganda here in America.
[00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:32.305]  And so, I was contacted by the Hostages Rescue Team.
[00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:43.457]  They've given us really good info before, and they said, listen, there's Islamic stuff in here, trips to the Middle East, and there's a bunch of anti-Faqrud, and they're lying about it, please get this out.
[00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.882]  It's come out today, he traveled the Middle East, not just his girlfriend, and reportedly had a bunch of paraphernalia.
[00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:54.948]  I mean, we told you they're looking at other people, the Sheriff's Department said that now, and we told you they were looking at radicalization, which was confirmed.
[00:04:55.268 --> 00:04:56.890]  Everything we said has been confirmed.
[00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.012]  Get the rest of the story straight ahead.
[00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:06.005]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:12.513]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:15.717]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:16.097 --> 00:05:19.081]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.744]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:24.826]  The left controls culture.
[00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:25.827]  They control arts.
[00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:27.129]  They control entertainment.
[00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:34.516]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:36.978]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.322]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.444]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:49.426]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:55.928]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:57.709]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.049]  It's available right now.
[00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.530]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:14.220]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.041]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:06:16.561 --> 00:06:20.243]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:34.755]  I'm gonna be honest with you, I disagree with what President Trump is doing concerning the Vegas massacre.
[00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:36.816]  We know it's Al-Qaeda-ISIS.
[00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:52.499]  We know that they're covering it up because they don't want to give ISIS a victory, right as thousands of ISIS fighters this week, hundreds today, have surrendered in Syria and Iraq, and the last few little pockets of them are now being defeated as President Trump and the U.S.
[00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.420]  military clean up Obama, NATO, and the globalist mess when they finance that group.
[00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:59.521]  So I get why they don't want to give them their victory.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.601]  When you're countering propaganda, you don't give it any attention.
[00:07:06.102 --> 00:07:13.905]  But we cannot sit here and have the Second Amendment blamed, and we cannot sit here and have them cover up what went on, or we become what we were fighting.
[00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:15.326]  So I do not
[00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:19.122]  Agree with what's going on.
[00:07:19.142 --> 00:07:27.407]  And we have Craig Sawyer, former team leader in SEAL Team 6, talk show host, ballistics expert, History Channel, Discovery Channel, very well respected.
[00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:31.770]  He has TV shows as a ballistics expert on national television.
[00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.434]  And he said on Tuesday and on Friday, this is clearly multiple firearms being shot.
[00:07:39.738 --> 00:07:41.378]  He'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:43.739]  Let me get into all the other news.
[00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.380]  The reason that's important is that part falls apart, the whole narrative falls apart.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.820]  Let me just give you the stacks of news here I have.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.861]  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 stacks.
[00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:58.022]  Some of these stacks are like 20 stories tall.
[00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:00.963]  But let me just give you my frustration because there's just so much here.
[00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.385]  North Korea ready to test a new missile capable of hitting U.S.
[00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:08.025]  West Coast.
[00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:12.592]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:15.473]  Trump says North Korea diplomacy has failed.
[00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:17.974]  Only one thing will work.
[00:08:18.854 --> 00:08:19.654]  Military action.
[00:08:20.014 --> 00:08:22.115]  That's the calm before the storm he was talking about next week.
[00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.516]  We've also got... Iran warns U.S.
[00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:27.957]  against imposing further sanctions.
[00:08:28.017 --> 00:08:28.917]  Threatens war.
[00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:31.578]  Report.
[00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:36.720]  Trump poised to upend Obama's most important climate regulation that put a tax on U.S.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.081]  carbon dioxide as a toxic waste, saying U.S.
[00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.321]  companies could not produce it
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.121]  Even though it's not recognized as a waste or a toxin anywhere else in the world, it's designed to sabotage our economy.
[00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:51.782]  And this is Trump just delivering on what he said he would do.
[00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:54.102]  The economy has surged to 3.1 growth.
[00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:56.763]  It's set to be at 3.9 by the end of the year.
[00:08:57.183 --> 00:09:00.603]  That's why the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates to stop the growth.
[00:09:01.203 --> 00:09:02.884]  That is the civil war in our country.
[00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:09.625]  VP Mike Pence leaves Colts game because 49ers players knelt during the anthem when they said they wouldn't.
[00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:13.608]  And of course I just think this is great because Pence has his First Amendment.
[00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:14.448]  So do you.
[00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:25.292]  And now we've got the very exciting news that the NFL has lost 31 percent of its core viewers just this year.
[00:09:25.312 --> 00:09:28.113]  And they lost another 20 plus percent in the last couple years.
[00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:30.354]  So they're down 50 plus percent.
[00:09:30.414 --> 00:09:31.234]  That's beautiful.
[00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:32.955]  They're now the most unpopular
[00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:49.166]  When people are asked about it, most unpopular sport in America, because you're not America's team, you're not America's sport, you're a globalist Hollywood filth production, spewing anti-gun, anti-family trash, and you're another bellwether of the death of the establishment.
[00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:54.769]  It is creme de la creme, coup de gras, it is the best, it is delicious, it is the final blow.
[00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:57.952]  It just doesn't get better than that, does it?
[00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:05.154]  Trump proclaims Columbus Day without Obama's qualms, while Antifa promises violent demonstrations tomorrow.
[00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:06.675]  They're always like, oh, it's so racist.
[00:10:07.135 --> 00:10:12.996]  The Native Americans were killing each other 24-7 and were cutting people's hearts out and eating them.
[00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:17.197]  I mean, Karankawas in Texas were eating people, not just the Aztecs.
[00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:19.417]  And by the way, folks, I'm part Native American.
[00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:21.137]  I'm not putting Native Americans down.
[00:10:21.437 --> 00:10:24.018]  It's just they were just as barbarous as anybody you'd ever imagine.
[00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:27.639]  And as soon as settlers showed up, they'd say, you're going to help us take over the next tribe.
[00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:28.459]  We're going to kill you.
[00:10:29.633 --> 00:10:36.838]  They were constantly killing each other, and just to lionize them under these angels and, oh, the evil of the West showing up.
[00:10:37.118 --> 00:10:38.639]  That's just a way to make you hate yourself.
[00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:42.781]  It's just a load of bull for people that actually haven't studied history.
[00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.762]  So I think that's good.
[00:10:46.023 --> 00:10:53.808]  There's a big report coming out here with Catalonia and how Spain is attempting basically martial law to keep that breakaway district under control.
[00:10:53.828 --> 00:10:57.611]  But it's not going to work, because the more they squeeze, the more people will resist.
[00:10:58.442 --> 00:11:00.744]  But here's the really big news for you.
[00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:03.566]  Progress!
[00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:06.589]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV.
[00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.371]  No longer a felony.
[00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:10.592]  It is the same as a parking ticket.
[00:11:10.632 --> 00:11:12.954]  The lowest level misdemeanor.
[00:11:12.974 --> 00:11:20.321]  So you knowingly give somebody a virus that can cause an autoimmune disease that makes you slowly die over five to ten years.
[00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:22.062]  But that's okay.
[00:11:22.443 --> 00:11:24.945]  Governor Jerry Brown signed it.
[00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:27.650]  And talked about equality.
[00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:37.839]  Well, it's not evil to have a disease, be it leprosy, HIV, hepatitis, whatever, but it's certainly evil to give it to someone.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.702]  But they're saying no, that's okay.
[00:11:40.722 --> 00:11:48.149]  And I want to get into the psychology of the insane Democratic Party here, because when HIV goes from lowered numbers like it is to exploding in the next five years,
[00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:53.270]  In a few years we're still here, as a planet, don't have nuclear war.
[00:11:53.410 --> 00:12:01.098]  I will go back to this show and say, here I am in 2017 saying within three to five years, California will have a 200% increase in HIV.
[00:12:07.557 --> 00:12:13.601]  They will also complain and say we need single payer, we need socialist health care, the reason we have HIV is because we don't have free health care.
[00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:22.966]  No, the reason we have HIV is because it is a culture now in the gay community, that I first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone, to give other people HIV.
[00:12:24.707 --> 00:12:25.748]  It's truly nihilistic.
[00:12:26.008 --> 00:12:26.669]  So here's the article.
[00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.010]  Progress, LA Times.
[00:12:30.331 --> 00:12:35.554]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV, no longer a felony in California, it's the same thing
[00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:40.539]  As a parking ticket.
[00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.660]  So it's essentially legalized.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.181]  And here's the LA Times.
[00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:51.706]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:52.987]  How about hepatitis?
[00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:53.727]  How about everything else?
[00:12:54.087 --> 00:12:58.290]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling blood bank they're HIV positive.
[00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.111]  Oh wow!
[00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:02.373]  Don't tell the blood bank you're HIV positive.
[00:13:02.873 --> 00:13:04.074]  See, this is a religion.
[00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:05.395]  This is Satanism, folks.
[00:13:05.415 --> 00:13:07.857]  Because if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[00:13:07.877 --> 00:13:08.677]  This is totally insane.
[00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:14.401]  Remember the Clintons for over a decade knew that all the blood coming out of their prisons was infected with HIV and Hepatitis?
[00:13:15.142 --> 00:13:15.422]  All of it.
[00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:27.450]  Because they would mix it together, and they would sell it into Canada, and say it was all clean, and then Bayer would buy it, turn it into Factor VIII, and Bayer knew it all had HIV in it, and they still shipped it out as population reduction.
[00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:28.751]  It's in the documents.
[00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:29.372]  So,
[00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:32.785]  This takes bug chasing to a whole new level.
[00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:38.868]  This isn't two guys getting together in a bar bathroom or wherever, okay?
[00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:44.571]  This is children, hemophiliacs, getting it and there's a religion.
[00:13:45.683 --> 00:13:50.967]  This is mainstream news of giving people HIV and then AIDS, of killing them, and then of wanting to get killed.
[00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:53.409]  But see, that's not enough of a thrill.
[00:13:53.469 --> 00:14:01.756]  It's more of a sacrament for Jerry Brown to destroy the entire blood industry, to destroy it even further, and then let the entire U.S.
[00:14:01.796 --> 00:14:03.577]  blood supply be tainted again.
[00:14:04.318 --> 00:14:10.362]  But it's okay, it's like it's okay to teach five-year-olds, you know, that they're not really a man or not really a woman, that they're really something else in school.
[00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:15.505]  Pedophilia being normalized by mainstream news, by the New York Times, by Salon.
[00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:19.188]  It's all about how far can they push you, what can they get away with.
[00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:21.413]  So let me read this again from the L.A.
[00:14:21.453 --> 00:14:21.713]  Times.
[00:14:21.853 --> 00:14:29.335]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:33.917]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank they're HIV positive.
[00:14:33.937 --> 00:14:42.239]  So you can go in, give them the blood, it infects the entire system, and you kill a bunch of people, but it's liberal, so it's like, well it's liberal!
[00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:43.379]  Oh, oh, oh!
[00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:44.379]  See, oh my gosh!
[00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:46.260]  No, it's a satanic ritual.
[00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:48.554]  And that's what bug chasers say.
[00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:55.696]  They say how wonderful it is when they first get the AIDS and first have the fever, and then now they're gods.
[00:14:55.716 --> 00:14:56.697]  They call it being a god.
[00:14:56.757 --> 00:15:04.119]  Like Meryl Streep, when she's not promoting pedophilia, standing ovations for Roman Polanski, says that Weinstein's a god.
[00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:05.240]  You understand?
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.201]  And let me just give you a few of the articles to back this up briefly.
[00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:12.764]  The CNN reports are like, it's a good deal.
[00:15:13.164 --> 00:15:16.206]  California hepatitis, an outbreak on the verge of a statewide epidemic.
[00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:19.188]  Again, most of it sexually transmitted and illegals coming in, but that's okay.
[00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:21.009]  They'll blame it on folks that aren't vaccinated.
[00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:25.871]  Man intentionally poked holes in condoms to inflict grinder hookups with HIV.
[00:15:26.072 --> 00:15:29.454]  Well, hell, that's a good thing in California.
[00:15:29.474 --> 00:15:31.295]  I mean, you're not going to get caught anyways.
[00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:32.515]  It's a parking ticket now.
[00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:34.536]  What's wrong with that in New York?
[00:15:34.837 --> 00:15:35.497]  Don't indict him.
[00:15:35.837 --> 00:15:38.499]  Bug chasers, gay men in the intentional pursuit of HIV.
[00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:39.880]  A narrative analysis.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.861]  Read all the mainstream news.
[00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:43.263]  Bug chasing on Wikipedia.
[00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.244]  Read all about it!
[00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:46.566]  Oh, but there's nothing satanic.
[00:15:46.586 --> 00:15:47.107]  There's nothing evil.
[00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:51.772]  And they'll probably say, Jones hates gay people and says that they want to give you AIDS.
[00:15:51.812 --> 00:15:57.278]  No, I said the governor signed a bill where they could do it and go give blood and kill a bunch of people.
[00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:58.419]  That's what you did.
[00:15:58.439 --> 00:16:00.361]  So go ahead and defend it, Media Matters.
[00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:03.004]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:09.575]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:10.976]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:16:11.216 --> 00:16:13.518]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:16:14.198 --> 00:16:20.702]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:16:20.902 --> 00:16:24.244]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:26.366]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:35.436]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:36.417]  They know how great it is.
[00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:41.122]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:16:41.943 --> 00:16:43.384]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:16:44.205 --> 00:16:52.090]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:59.354]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:03.977]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:17:04.117 --> 00:17:08.180]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.482]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:14.763]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:17:15.103 --> 00:17:26.087]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:25.462]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:18:25.823 --> 00:18:34.676]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:35.857]  Concentrate.
[00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:37.679]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:39.360]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.221]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.501]  It's incredible.
[00:18:42.982 --> 00:18:44.883]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:46.224]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:18:46.684 --> 00:18:47.585]  At 15, incredible.
[00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:48.785]  It is amazing.
[00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:50.426]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:51.187 --> 00:18:51.987]  50% off Caveman.
[00:18:52.187 --> 00:18:53.528]  But only a few days left.
[00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:54.529]  It's about to end.
[00:18:55.109 --> 00:18:57.430]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.053]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:19:03.473 --> 00:19:04.874]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:19:05.134 --> 00:19:06.274]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:07.475]  I want to thank you.
[00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:08.856]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:19.261]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:19:25.483 --> 00:19:35.406]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:41.008]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:59.615]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:07.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:47.823]  Well guess what ladies and gentlemen, if you live in the United States or Canada, California is the biggest state for overall blood donations and the blood is then mixed and processed at central locations across the country.
[00:20:47.863 --> 00:20:51.908]  So if you live in New York or you live in Florida or Texas or Oklahoma or...
[00:20:52.809 --> 00:21:04.005]  Illinois, you will be getting HIV and hepatitis blood now from California because they've legalized, as of Friday, giving blood if you have HIV.
[00:21:04.185 --> 00:21:06.568]  Because we don't want to be politically incorrect and have a stigma.
[00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.431]  I'm not kidding.
[00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:21.043]  They're also saying you can intentionally give it to someone without telling them, and that it's the equivalent of a parking ticket, a $50 fine.
[00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:22.324]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:21:22.644 --> 00:21:26.368]  That's in the LA Times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:27.849]  They are very, very proud of this.
[00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:29.250]  Now, this was first called
[00:21:30.271 --> 00:21:31.112]  Bug chasing.
[00:21:31.772 --> 00:21:40.777]  Back in the 90s, Rolling Stone, the San Francisco Chronicle reported on bug chasers, gay men in the intentional pursuit of HIV, a narrative analysis.
[00:21:40.797 --> 00:21:50.622]  Now, if you want to commit suicide, and you're mentally ill, and you want to get a horrible long-term disease that takes a decade to kill you, that's your issue.
[00:21:51.303 --> 00:21:57.006]  But if you want to then make everyone else accept it because misery loves company,
[00:21:58.407 --> 00:22:01.269]  That is pure evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:12.455]  And it shows the mindset of Hollywood and the people that are involved in this, is that they want to infect society with their culture of death.
[00:22:12.955 --> 00:22:15.277]  They want to sexualize your children.
[00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:18.418]  Whether it be heterosexual, homosexual, it's all pedophilia.
[00:22:18.579 --> 00:22:20.880]  With Salon and the New York Times promoting it.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.341]  I mean, Weinstein
[00:22:23.221 --> 00:22:29.785]  You know, harassing all these women is wrong and is bad, but it's the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
[00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:38.210]  And if you understand all this, you understand the mindset of what they want to do to fly over country.
[00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:45.014]  California has set incredible precedents, saying that they'll give your kids vaccines even if you don't want to.
[00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:48.436]  And if you try to homeschool your kid, they'll take them away from you.
[00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:50.257]  I mean, it is a true
[00:22:51.778 --> 00:23:01.701]  authoritarian utopia and you're seeing the mindset, the world view of the authoritarians and what they want to do to you.
[00:23:01.741 --> 00:23:03.742]  So let that sink in.
[00:23:05.442 --> 00:23:09.183]  They want to see how far they can go as deviants.
[00:23:10.203 --> 00:23:14.505]  Let me tell you, it doesn't get more deviant than wanting to knowingly give blood when you've got
[00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:16.186]  HIV.
[00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:17.066]  So other people get it.
[00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:18.547]  I mean, that is pure evil.
[00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:25.409]  But see, now being liberal means, oh, you can't have a mother and father on your elementary school entrance form.
[00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:26.529]  Someone may not have that.
[00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:32.751]  And see, if you don't have HIV, if you're not dying, if you don't know what it's like, well, you're going to find out!
[00:23:33.751 --> 00:23:36.772]  And now the precedent will be, well, if I have hepatitis, can I give it to you?
[00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:38.972]  Oh, if I have leprosy, can I give it to you?
[00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:42.153]  And now you understand why these folks want to run your life.
[00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:43.774]  They are evil.
[00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:45.767]  This is what they're into.
[00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:47.088]  This is what they do.
[00:23:47.848 --> 00:23:50.289]  And the good news is, they know they're dying.
[00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.211]  The globalists, their system, they know it's falling apart.
[00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:57.853]  And they're not content enough to sexualize its children.
[00:23:57.873 --> 00:24:07.597]  They're not intent enough to bully the gay community through their liberal propaganda they've got control of, and they're strangling and murdering and killing and trying to suck the life out of.
[00:24:07.817 --> 00:24:09.078]  They want every community.
[00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:11.767]  So the media will spend this on gay people.
[00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:12.388]  That's not what I'm doing.
[00:24:12.608 --> 00:24:13.528]  That's the mental illness here.
[00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:17.871]  Oh, let us sexualize your kids, or you don't like transsexuals.
[00:24:19.052 --> 00:24:24.475]  They use all these groups as a foil, as a shill to get political control.
[00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:26.437]  And it's pure abject evil.
[00:24:26.937 --> 00:24:28.638]  Again, I'm going to say this again for everybody that just tuned in.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:38.725]  California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that the LA Times with a straight face reports is loving and liberal.
[00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:45.923]  And that lets you knowingly infect people with HIV, and lets you knowingly go give blood when you know you have it.
[00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:55.369]  That's like driving down the road, randomly past some station wagon or minivan, and randomly shooting bullets into it, not knowing if one will hit or not.
[00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:57.410]  I mean, that is the exact same thing.
[00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.993]  If you've got a virus you know kills people, and you're gonna go give blood and not tell them.
[00:25:05.214 --> 00:25:05.655]  Good God.
[00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.314]  This is just total cultural sabotage, and it's what all the NFL kneeling's about.
[00:25:11.334 --> 00:25:18.199]  And it's the globalists realizing their system's coming down, so they want to dynamite the entire civilization.
[00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:19.800]  They want to bring it down.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.943]  And remember, the Clintons have that history.
[00:25:23.983 --> 00:25:26.846]  Look up the Clinton blood scandal, where they were the one state
[00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:41.089]  that wouldn't test the prisoners and would certify they've been tested and would ship out the blood and would knowingly contaminated and over a hundred thousand hemophiliacs died from getting HIV and hepatitis.
[00:25:42.523 --> 00:25:43.664]  Good Lord.
[00:25:44.525 --> 00:25:48.508]  The abject, total and complete evil.
[00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:52.031]  I had the doctor on who was working in the prisons who reported it.
[00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:56.374]  The day after he was on, his offices were firebombed in Little Rock.
[00:25:57.055 --> 00:26:00.697]  The same night, the Hemophiliac Society in Canada was also attacked.
[00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:04.040]  And their files stolen and computers stolen.
[00:26:07.043 --> 00:26:08.464]  Yeah, that's the kind of sources we have.
[00:26:08.484 --> 00:26:09.685]  It's the kind of news we break here.
[00:26:10.811 --> 00:26:17.078]  Just like we told you, they were looking at other people involved in the mass shooting in Nevada and Vegas.
[00:26:17.098 --> 00:26:20.281]  Just like we told you, they were looking at Middle Eastern radicalization.
[00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:21.222]  That's now all come out.
[00:26:21.782 --> 00:26:28.569]  Just like we told you, the hostage rescue team sources said that there was Islamic paraphernalia and Antifa paraphernalia in him traveling the Middle East.
[00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:34.874]  What's in the Middle East, ladies and gentlemen, is the funding for these type of operations for people that will carry this out.
[00:26:35.334 --> 00:26:40.378]  You know, ISIS has been targeting Westerners because they can do this and not be as easily noticed.
[00:26:40.678 --> 00:26:41.699]  And here is CNN.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.544]  Las Vegas shooter took 20 cruises, many of them to the Middle East.
[00:26:49.725 --> 00:26:53.647]  And that's all coming up in the next segment with Craig Sawyer, former leader with SEAL Team 6.
[00:26:55.109 --> 00:26:57.050]  And he didn't like me saying that, but it's true.
[00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:03.954]  And, you know, the point is, is that he hosts major TV shows on ballistics.
[00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:05.795]  He's one of the top ballistics experts in the world.
[00:27:06.515 --> 00:27:09.817]  He's the main guy on History Channel and Discovery Channel shows, shows like Top Shots.
[00:27:10.737 --> 00:27:13.258]  And he works with Hollywood.
[00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:15.860]  He's taking a big risk to his career, what he does coming on this show.
[00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:19.420]  And he's telling you that there's clearly two shooters going on.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:31.332]  And I've talked to other Navy SEALs, I've talked to Army people, high level, the best soldiers out there, and they say 100% there's at least two shooters, probably three, in the first two and a half minutes.
[00:27:32.173 --> 00:27:34.274]  So that's all coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:36.254]  Briefly, we are listener-supported.
[00:27:36.774 --> 00:27:38.374]  You heard the network ads, you heard the local ads.
[00:27:38.394 --> 00:27:41.715]  It's very important to support the network sponsors and to support your local station sponsors.
[00:27:41.975 --> 00:27:52.598]  But if you want to support InfoWars itself, and this crew, and this building, and the facilities, and the satellites, and all the things we're doing, and our massive expansion in the face of the globalists, putting on, you know, every bit of sail we can in the fight.

[00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:00.560]  We need your financial support.
[00:28:01.001 --> 00:28:01.722]  We make it easy.

[00:29:24.775 --> 00:29:26.576]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.

[00:31:38.153 --> 00:31:39.514]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:31:39.534 --> 00:31:41.416]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:31:41.837 --> 00:31:42.718]  It's incredible.

[00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:50.626]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:33:04.908 --> 00:33:07.530]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.062 --> 00:33:30.367]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:40.795]  Well, Craig Solomon Sawyer has hosted, what is it, at least five different shows on national television.
[00:33:40.835 --> 00:33:43.477]  He's the main expert shooter on Top Shots.
[00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:50.053]  And he's one of the top advisors to Hollywood Films, so he's a top ballistics guy.
[00:33:50.073 --> 00:34:00.960]  And you know, he's risking a lot in the last few years getting really political for the Republic and coming out and speaking out against Hollywood, the globalists, the whole New World Order.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:09.225]  And the reason I wanted to get him back on today is they've had the Washington Post, the New York Times, and literally hundreds of other publications
[00:34:11.394 --> 00:34:17.419]  Come out and say, Jones says he has all these military sources that say they clearly hear multiple shots.
[00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:18.900]  He's making it up.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:31.169]  Even though I've had Craig on as an expert, and I've had other military people on, and I've also talked to people that are in Delta Force, Green Beret Army, other Navy SEALs, you name it.
[00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:36.953]  Some of them have been on the show before, but some of them are involved in this investigation so they can't come on now.
[00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:37.614]  Craig isn't.
[00:34:37.854 --> 00:34:40.236]  He's also a federal officer, air marshal.
[00:34:41.192 --> 00:34:48.514]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, and I don't normally go over the whole bio, but the media plays these games.
[00:34:48.534 --> 00:34:56.175]  They go, Jones claims he has sources inside the hostage rescue team that say they found Islamic and anti-paraphernalia.
[00:34:56.536 --> 00:34:58.856]  No, they called me and texted me Monday.
[00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.717]  The same folks told our reporters, you better get out of
[00:35:04.301 --> 00:35:22.693]  Oregon that's about the shooting's about to start in two days later it happened our people got out I mean these are really good people who were on the ground and sources and But Craig's willing to come on and talk about it Former team leader and still team six must be cleared in command assaulting sex and you never even want to say that but the point is we have to say some of the
[00:35:23.473 --> 00:35:27.777]  Bonafides, some of the curriculum vitae, so people know who we're talking to.
[00:35:27.997 --> 00:35:31.580]  This is the guy with the big Discovery Channel show and the History Channel shows.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.681]  You know, top shots.
[00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:35.103]  You know, he's a top ballistics expert.
[00:35:35.323 --> 00:35:37.144]  He's saying here's two different groups shooting.
[00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:41.088]  But after he said that on Tuesday, we have footage of cab drivers.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.486]  Where you hear a pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
[00:35:55.788 --> 00:36:02.993]  Not to say what happened, I guess not to create panic, and they don't want to give ISIS a victory, and I get that's the old policy, until the 90s is, don't talk about terrorism.
[00:36:03.714 --> 00:36:06.556]  You can't let them do this then and use it against the Second Amendment.
[00:36:06.836 --> 00:36:09.598]  Plus, I'm not under martial law, so I want the truth to come out.
[00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:13.901]  Now, Craig's got sources, he won't even get into them with me, but he said, yeah, you're in the right direction.
[00:36:14.141 --> 00:36:15.222]  But I have my other sources.
[00:36:15.522 --> 00:36:20.086]  And they're like, dead on this guy was ISIS, he was getting money for his gambling, millions a year.
[00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:22.948]  They were trying to recruit Westerners, they said, two years ago.
[00:36:23.228 --> 00:36:25.089]  He pledged allegiance six months ago.
[00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:26.430]  The White House has the video.
[00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.051]  We have that from White House sources.
[00:36:28.091 --> 00:36:34.395]  And I gotta say, I love the president, I like the president, but I think this is wrong.
[00:36:34.816 --> 00:36:37.337]  But regardless, there are multiple shooters.
[00:36:37.798 --> 00:36:38.698]  Why is that important?
[00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:42.281]  We're gonna go over some of the acoustics evidence in a minute, because it shows the whole story's not true.
[00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:48.545]  Solomon, what do you think about the situation now, in hindsight, as we get more distance on this and as more comes out?
[00:36:49.605 --> 00:36:52.346]  Well Alex, I always look at the big picture.
[00:36:52.406 --> 00:37:04.349]  When everyone gets confused and starts agonizing over the small details, I take a couple steps back and scan the horizon, if you will, and consider what the big picture may be.
[00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.709]  Who benefits from these mass shootings?
[00:37:07.789 --> 00:37:09.090]  Why do they keep happening?
[00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.150]  Why are they always liberal Democrats that do the shooting?
[00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.391]  Why are they always on psychotropic drugs?
[00:37:14.931 --> 00:37:17.992]  And why are those facts always ignored by the
[00:37:19.546 --> 00:37:22.648]  The radicals on the left and the mainstream news media.
[00:37:22.689 --> 00:37:29.273]  Why is it always just about the gun control narrative immediately and ferociously?
[00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:30.554]  So I scratched my head.
[00:37:30.574 --> 00:37:32.776]  I'm like, OK, somebody benefits from this.
[00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:34.577]  And it certainly wasn't the shooter in this case.
[00:37:34.617 --> 00:37:38.640]  We can see if he was even, in fact, the shooter at all.
[00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:45.345]  Either they smoked him after he shot everybody up or he didn't even get to do that before they smoked him.
[00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.151]  This case stinks to high heavens.
[00:37:48.171 --> 00:37:51.013]  There are a lot of things that don't match up with what the public's being told.
[00:37:51.113 --> 00:37:58.218]  I think one of the main things is those security cameras, the footage from the security cameras around Mandalay Bay.
[00:37:58.418 --> 00:37:59.079]  They're everywhere.
[00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:02.341]  You're not going to go anywhere in that hotel without being captured.
[00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:09.846]  So I understand, as a federal criminal investigator, protecting the case and safeguarding that
[00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:15.572]  That forensic evidence for the prosecutions that may and hopefully are coming.
[00:38:16.253 --> 00:38:23.875]  But at some point, those pieces of footage will be released to the public unless there's a big government cover-up.
[00:38:24.415 --> 00:38:29.076]  If there's a big government cover-up, those pieces of footage will go away.
[00:38:29.156 --> 00:38:30.477]  Nobody will ever see or hear from them.
[00:38:31.497 --> 00:38:31.797]  Bye-bye.
[00:38:32.558 --> 00:38:41.904]  And that's one of the things that's going to take time for me is to sit and watch and go, OK, are we ever going to get footage of that guy and anyone else going in and out of that that hotel room?
[00:38:42.044 --> 00:38:43.605]  Or is it going to be buried forever?
[00:38:43.665 --> 00:38:44.846]  Is it already even destroyed?
[00:38:45.066 --> 00:38:45.246]  Sure.
[00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:50.029]  I mean, I got the call from the HRT and then the text saying, go ahead and talk about it now.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:51.720]  That's real.
[00:38:52.321 --> 00:38:53.482]  And we've proven all our sources.
[00:38:53.902 --> 00:38:55.243]  But I know you've got a lot of sources.
[00:38:55.283 --> 00:38:56.163]  You're very frustrated.
[00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:57.204]  You're actually sitting here.
[00:38:57.764 --> 00:38:58.985]  You've talked to some of the investigators.
[00:38:59.005 --> 00:38:59.746]  We can't get into that.
[00:38:59.766 --> 00:39:02.207]  And you know a lot more than you can say.
[00:39:02.227 --> 00:39:05.309]  And is it frustrating to just have to sit here and watch the mainstream narrative?
[00:39:07.551 --> 00:39:08.051]  Well, it is.
[00:39:08.251 --> 00:39:13.415]  Again, we want to safeguard the investigation, but we don't want the American people disarmed
[00:39:14.153 --> 00:39:21.419]  To the delight of our enemies, to the glee of our globalist enemies who are after that as one of their main objectives.
[00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:23.440]  They need primarily two things.
[00:39:23.821 --> 00:39:30.886]  They need us divided and they need us disarmed for them to have the level of tyrannical control that they're after.
[00:39:32.528 --> 00:39:35.210]  Shame on any American citizen by now that's not
[00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:43.041]  Still is not educated on Cloward-Piven and how that strategy is utilized to break our economy.
[00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:46.002]  We were suffering under it in the last eight years.
[00:39:46.082 --> 00:39:48.583]  It's one of the things that's got them so upset about Trump.
[00:39:49.123 --> 00:39:53.824]  Our economy's recovering and he's going to ensure that we stop squandering.
[00:39:53.844 --> 00:39:57.025]  And it is, and now they're going to raise interest rates, admittedly trying to kill it.
[00:39:57.365 --> 00:39:58.346]  They said we can never get to 3%, it's 3.1.
[00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:04.210]  We're going to go to break and come back and play some of these acoustics and play some of the video from cab drivers and others.
[00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:19.923]  It's totally clear and I'm not a, you know, former Navy SEAL Team 6, you know, leader and Marine previously and, you know, History Channel shooting expert like you are, but I can hear bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-b
[00:40:24.429 --> 00:40:24.890]  It is.
[00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.572]  Now, I will get this caveat out there.
[00:40:27.612 --> 00:40:29.434]  It's very important to be accurate.
[00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:34.338]  Echoes are very confusing and hearing anything through a microphone is confusing.
[00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:43.307]  One of my best friends is probably the foremost authority on not terminal wound ballistics, but the acoustics.
[00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:44.394]  Okay.
[00:41:01.287 --> 00:41:03.528]  I mean, it's just, it's apparent anyway.
[00:41:04.148 --> 00:41:15.652]  Even though you're listening to the echoes and even though you're listening it after the fact through a microphone that just does change that acoustic signature, it is still apparent that there's more than one shooter.
[00:41:15.712 --> 00:41:22.854]  So, one of the key points you brought up, I think very accurately, is you hear something very muffled, very far away.
[00:41:23.494 --> 00:41:28.999]  And then all of a sudden, shortly thereafter, it's very loud, very distinct.
[00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:32.021]  That's a far engagement and then a close engagement.
[00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:39.587]  So, unless somebody's got a time machine, there's no other way to... Well, sure, and even at miles away, an echo would be a second apart.
[00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:47.113]  This is 30, 40 seconds before... And then she's at Mandalay Bay, the taxi driver, and it's right above her.
[00:41:47.493 --> 00:41:49.454]  I mean, he's right there shooting out of the window.
[00:41:50.615 --> 00:41:51.396]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:52.054 --> 00:41:55.536]  And even if they're... let's just speculate.
[00:41:55.576 --> 00:42:00.898]  Let's say if the first string of fire were fired through a suppressor, it would not sound that way.
[00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.498]  It sounds distinctly different.
[00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:02.859]  You're right.
[00:42:02.919 --> 00:42:06.640]  Even though it would sound muffled, the sound is not the same type.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.041]  Have they said there were suppressors though?
[00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:08.661]  But I would agree.
[00:42:08.861 --> 00:42:10.542]  The only way it's not is this is a suppressor.
[00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:12.419]  Yeah.
[00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:15.901]  Nobody said that, that I've heard Alex, and it does not sound that way to me.
[00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:21.866]  I was just playing devil's advocate, even if it were, it would not sound the way that it does.
[00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:30.272]  Well, by the way, I mean, I've talked to a lot of guys that have been, a few of them at your level of expertise, there's not many, they say it's absolutely clear.
[00:42:32.756 --> 00:42:35.919]  I feel confident that we're hearing more than once a year.
[00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.440]  And that paints a bigger picture.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.921]  So, the official narrative is going to have to change.
[00:42:41.582 --> 00:42:45.545]  Alright, let's talk about the actual accusers when we come back and play some of these tapes.
[00:42:45.585 --> 00:42:47.346]  And then, what is the narrative?
[00:42:47.366 --> 00:42:50.408]  Well, just like Colonel Schaefer said, CIA, you name it.
[00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:51.929]  The target's the motive.
[00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.291]  The motive's the target.
[00:42:54.931 --> 00:42:56.152]  Just like Craig Sawyer was just saying.
[00:42:56.452 --> 00:42:58.293]  TacticalInsider.com is his website.
[00:42:58.334 --> 00:42:59.594]  VetsForChildRescue.org.
[00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:00.275]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.008 --> 00:43:10.154]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:43:10.414 --> 00:43:14.097]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:43:14.777 --> 00:43:21.282]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:43:21.482 --> 00:43:26.946]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off, and I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:43:27.586 --> 00:43:35.995]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:43:36.036 --> 00:43:36.977]  They know how great it is.
[00:43:37.918 --> 00:43:41.722]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:43:42.523 --> 00:43:43.964]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:43:44.785 --> 00:43:52.670]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:43:53.090 --> 00:44:01.836]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:44:02.136 --> 00:44:04.558]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:44:04.698 --> 00:44:08.740]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:12.123]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:44:14.464 --> 00:44:15.325]  It's a good deal at $39.

[00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.250]  And more.
[00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:36.371]  Concentrate.
[00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:38.192]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:45:38.433 --> 00:45:39.854]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:45:39.874 --> 00:45:41.715]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:45:42.135 --> 00:45:42.996]  It's incredible.
[00:45:43.476 --> 00:45:45.377]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:46.718]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:45:47.178 --> 00:45:48.079]  At 15, incredible.
[00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:49.280]  It is amazing.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.921]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:52.482]  50% off Caveman.
[00:45:52.702 --> 00:45:54.023]  But only a few days left.
[00:45:54.263 --> 00:45:55.024]  It's about to end.
[00:45:55.624 --> 00:45:57.945]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:45:58.385 --> 00:46:03.568]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:46:03.988 --> 00:46:05.369]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:06.789]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.970]  I want to thank you.
[00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.351]  We're all in this together.
[00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:19.776]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:46:36.183 --> 00:46:41.506]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.023 --> 00:47:19.324]  We are on the march.
[00:47:19.364 --> 00:47:22.284]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:47:22.384 --> 00:47:24.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:24.505 --> 00:47:27.006]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to land.
[00:47:27.146 --> 00:47:33.887]  You win some, lose some, and do the same to me.
[00:47:35.468 --> 00:47:41.169]  The pleasure is to play.
[00:47:41.469 --> 00:47:44.070]  Ain't no difference what you say.
[00:47:53.453 --> 00:48:00.997]  Corey Langdon is a well-known, we've checked her profile, taxi driver for decades in Las Vegas.
[00:48:01.718 --> 00:48:03.779]  And I've watched dozens of these.
[00:48:03.879 --> 00:48:04.679]  It's not just her.
[00:48:05.419 --> 00:48:11.603]  It's people a mile away at other hotels saying, yeah, there's glass everywhere, shell casings, they shot these men.
[00:48:12.423 --> 00:48:21.549]  And then the police jumped on top of us and told us to get out of there and everybody's like huddling and they're shooting footage inside the hotel saying the police just made us shelter in place in here.
[00:48:21.669 --> 00:48:23.270]  I mean there's just hours of this.
[00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:25.791]  And these are real people.
[00:48:25.851 --> 00:48:26.732]  This isn't made up.
[00:48:27.752 --> 00:48:28.393]  And I've talked to
[00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:35.740]  The police here in Austin sometimes will have a shooting on 2nd Street, that's the lead area, and those letters say it happened down on 11th Street.
[00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:41.805]  And look, I know they don't want to panic people, but it's just incredible.
[00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:52.174]  Craig Sawyer is our guest, a former high-level operator with the Navy SEALs, hosts History and Discovery Channel, television shows like Top Shot, he's one of the top ballistics experts out there.
[00:48:52.975 --> 00:48:55.036]  Tacticalinsider.com.
[00:48:55.056 --> 00:49:01.739]  He's also doing Vets4ChildRescue.org and really doing a great job with documentaries that are coming out soon on that front.
[00:49:01.759 --> 00:49:06.381]  We're not going to talk about that and let the bad guys know when Craig's about to be showing up at their doorstep here.
[00:49:07.742 --> 00:49:13.664]  So before I go any further, let's just get into any other points you'd like to make before I play this video, Craig.
[00:49:15.905 --> 00:49:21.108]  Well, as far as the bona fides go, moving forward on the ballistics, Alex, I'm a
[00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:28.907]  I'm a ballistics expert for capital murder cases, so I testify on hardcore big-time cases with that.
[00:49:28.927 --> 00:49:32.429]  So that's even more than the television credentials.
[00:49:32.849 --> 00:49:34.490]  I'd lean on that a little bit to paint the picture.
[00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:40.232]  And that's why I'm hesitant to say absolutely this or that until I've gone through personally the forensic evidence.
[00:49:40.272 --> 00:49:43.613]  I just, during the break, I talked to a friend of mine that does the audio.
[00:49:44.513 --> 00:49:46.154]  And he's the same way, you know.
[00:49:46.394 --> 00:49:54.018]  He said, Craig, until I have the chance and pull off of some of these other cases and go through and analyze it, I don't want to say absolutely this or that.
[00:49:54.078 --> 00:49:57.600]  So that's a little bit of why I hesitate on things, Alex.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.602]  It's not that I don't feel confident, but it's... No, I understand.
[00:50:00.702 --> 00:50:03.504]  You are a professional guy that does this in federal court cases.
[00:50:03.764 --> 00:50:05.405]  You're a federal officer, former Navy SEAL.
[00:50:05.725 --> 00:50:06.565]  I totally respect that.
[00:50:06.585 --> 00:50:07.626]  Look, I'm no accuser, Scott.
[00:50:08.206 --> 00:50:19.452]  I know, and 45 seconds later, boom boom boom, you know, it's 50 times louder, something's going on, it's what other people reported, it's what you hear, and then of course we have the police.
[00:50:19.492 --> 00:50:27.457]  What do you make of the police first saying, no we think there could be multiple people, in fact we know there must be, and we're looking at radicalization.
[00:50:27.737 --> 00:50:30.699]  They don't say radicalization unless they're looking at radicalization.
[00:50:30.759 --> 00:50:32.840]  Isn't that generally code word for Islamic?
[00:50:35.307 --> 00:50:37.828]  Well, not necessarily just Islamic anymore.
[00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:43.710]  I mean, there are so many people being swept on up by, exactly, by George Soros and others.
[00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.551]  But it tends to have a leftist leaning.
[00:50:45.631 --> 00:50:47.491]  They call right-wingers extremists.
[00:50:48.251 --> 00:50:49.452]  Right-wingers are called extremists.
[00:50:49.852 --> 00:50:52.433]  Islamists or radical leftists are called radicalized.
[00:50:53.365 --> 00:50:54.405]  Right, absolutely.
[00:50:54.505 --> 00:50:56.086]  You're 100% correct on that, Alex.
[00:50:56.126 --> 00:51:02.468]  Look, you don't see people radicalized from the conservative right going off on mass murder binges.
[00:51:02.508 --> 00:51:05.249]  That's just not part of their core values and what they're up to.
[00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:15.372]  Even if they're some sort of weird Nazi, you know, KKK guys or something like that, there's such a small number of those people anymore because we've all
[00:51:16.892 --> 00:51:20.619]  Disavow that as a nation and I'll find it repugnant.
[00:51:20.679 --> 00:51:26.991]  But we got the left massively hyping, massively hyping Civil War October 1st to peak November 4th.
[00:51:27.031 --> 00:51:27.892]  I mean how obvious is this?
[00:51:27.912 --> 00:51:28.493]  Look at the target!
[00:51:29.435 --> 00:51:51.088]  All of the rhetoric and the encouragement for violence is coming from the left, so we've got a cultural problem in this country right now, Alex, and we've got big-time political figures that somebody refuses to prosecute that are inciting violence and encouraging them to start a civil war, yet they are not arrested and put away.
[00:51:51.268 --> 00:51:52.049]  I ask myself,
[00:51:52.765 --> 00:51:52.865]  What?
[00:52:21.793 --> 00:52:27.816]  For a peaceful citizen to watch this just play out before us like a slow motion punch for a drunk guy.
[00:52:27.836 --> 00:52:29.217]  You're like, hey, dude, here it comes.
[00:52:29.317 --> 00:52:30.617]  I mean, you're quit mouthing off.
[00:52:30.657 --> 00:52:31.878]  This guy's going to clock you.
[00:52:32.178 --> 00:52:33.338]  You're sitting back and watch it.
[00:52:33.358 --> 00:52:33.879]  It'll go.
[00:52:33.899 --> 00:52:34.639]  You know, here it comes.
[00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:35.179]  Here it comes.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.781]  And then finally, boom, I feel like that guy.
[00:52:37.901 --> 00:52:38.861]  I'm watching my country.
[00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:39.781]  I'm like, here this comes.
[00:52:39.802 --> 00:52:40.642]  This is so stupid.
[00:52:41.022 --> 00:52:42.304]  We could totally avoid this.
[00:52:42.645 --> 00:52:43.987]  Prosecute George Soros.
[00:52:44.047 --> 00:52:45.290]  Prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.815]  Prosecute those that are calling for this violence and put an end to it.
[00:52:48.856 --> 00:52:49.557]  Send a message.
[00:52:49.917 --> 00:52:52.462]  Get some control and return to peace and order.
[00:52:52.822 --> 00:52:54.746]  Yet, nobody will do it and here we go.
[00:52:56.067 --> 00:52:59.969]  You're right and I mean it's crazy they say hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:53:00.029 --> 00:53:06.433]  Top Democrat strategists go on Fox News and say we need to kill more Republicans and then cops get shot in Louisiana and Texas.
[00:53:06.813 --> 00:53:11.535]  I've got the clip CNN says well cops need to reform themselves like they deserve to die.
[00:53:11.835 --> 00:53:13.576]  It's like what planet is this?
[00:53:14.717 --> 00:53:16.458]  This is this is surreal.
[00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:20.120]  I'm sitting here scratching my head every day going where are the arrests?
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.141]  Where is the intervention?
[00:53:22.893 --> 00:53:25.318]  For the peaceful, law-abiding public.
[00:53:25.718 --> 00:53:27.642]  Where are our representatives?
[00:53:27.702 --> 00:53:29.445]  Where is our protection?
[00:53:32.324 --> 00:53:34.225]  Well, they're becoming more desperate.
[00:53:34.265 --> 00:53:35.265]  The more they lose to Donald Trump,
[00:54:03.105 --> 00:54:10.068]  The further they get down their list of contingencies of plans that they can try to execute to try to thwart
[00:54:11.858 --> 00:54:15.441]  Uh, this administration's agenda, which is to make America great again.
[00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:17.862]  Or just sabotaging America, as you said at the start of the interview.
[00:54:18.383 --> 00:54:20.084]  Literally a 3.1% growth rate.
[00:54:20.104 --> 00:54:21.365]  They said, we'd never have that again.
[00:54:21.685 --> 00:54:24.927]  They're trying to stop it all with, uh, with, uh, blocking tax cuts.
[00:54:25.227 --> 00:54:34.854]  Did you hear California just legalized giving people HIV knowingly and also giving blood knowing you have, it's now a misdemeanor, like the lowest level parking ticket.
[00:54:35.114 --> 00:54:39.076]  If that is an example of scorched earth, dynamite everything, burn it all down.
[00:54:39.397 --> 00:54:41.358]  This is cloud cuckoo land.
[00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:46.141]  Well, we're going off the rails on this crazy train, Alex.
[00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:48.422]  I mean, it's just bizarre.
[00:54:48.903 --> 00:55:02.511]  It's heartbreaking, because the damage is real, but it's laughable in just how ridiculous and unacceptable and irrational all of this is from the radical left.
[00:55:02.531 --> 00:55:03.732]  They're completely mentally ill.
[00:55:04.172 --> 00:55:10.977]  ...put charge of anything, and why, on God's green earth, do we allow them to continue for even one more day?
[00:55:12.844 --> 00:55:14.205]  Craig, I want to play this clip.
[00:55:14.606 --> 00:55:16.348]  Again, this is a local taxi driver.
[00:55:16.368 --> 00:55:17.629]  I already mentioned her name earlier.
[00:55:17.989 --> 00:55:21.914]  When it all starts, the first few minutes, that's what all my experts, you included, say.
[00:55:22.254 --> 00:55:24.777]  First two minutes or so, you hear multiple firing.
[00:55:25.517 --> 00:55:28.781]  We know somebody first was shooting the fuel tanks, and then it stops.
[00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:31.203]  There's only shots coming out of the hotel.
[00:55:31.223 --> 00:55:33.686]  So this is at Mandalay Bay, right below where he's shooting.
[00:55:33.986 --> 00:55:34.307]  Here it is.
[00:55:49.363 --> 00:55:52.025]  Now it sounds like it's coming from, um, farther away.
[00:55:54.066 --> 00:55:55.728]  She's not even an acoustics person, she does that.
[00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:58.270]  Barely here, like a mile away.
[00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:06.015]  Now here comes, this is unedited, here comes the big shots, right where she's at.
[00:56:06.115 --> 00:56:06.996]  Right, he's right above her.
[00:56:19.955 --> 00:56:21.719]  That's so loud, it's drowning out the microphone.
[00:56:21.739 --> 00:56:23.002]  That's the sound of a mic maxed out.
[00:56:23.803 --> 00:56:25.346]  And it just goes on and on a few more times.
[00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:28.292]  It's not like a second later, it's an echo.
[00:56:28.353 --> 00:56:28.513]  No.
[00:56:28.954 --> 00:56:31.198]  It is... I mean, Craig, what do you make of that?
[00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:38.105]  Well, it's a lot more radical increase in volume than you would experience just going around a corner.
[00:56:38.145 --> 00:56:46.274]  Let's say the first string of fire, the cab driver was behind a wall and then she drove around the wall and the sound then became louder.
[00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:52.320]  This sounds to me like a much greater increase in volume than just that would present.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.961]  And it looks like the new shots begin, though, before she's even gotten behind the new wall.
[00:56:55.981 --> 00:56:56.742]  Because I thought that, too.
[00:56:56.762 --> 00:56:57.502]  Oh, maybe she moved.
[00:56:57.522 --> 00:56:58.142]  But you watch it.
[00:56:58.482 --> 00:56:59.783]  It starts and then she's moving.
[00:56:59.803 --> 00:57:03.324]  And then it gets even louder as she goes around under because he's right up above her.
[00:57:04.525 --> 00:57:07.346]  Well, she was the first-hand witness on the ground.
[00:57:07.486 --> 00:57:10.347]  And like you said earlier, common sense prevails.
[00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:14.949]  I mean, we understand whether a sound is coming from close or far away.
[00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.889]  And she even said it.
[00:57:16.149 --> 00:57:17.690]  Ah, it sounds like it's really far away.
[00:57:18.903 --> 00:57:19.303]  At first.
[00:57:20.024 --> 00:57:23.785]  It's like when you're deer hunting and you just hear like a... You're like, well, that's like a mile away.
[00:57:23.805 --> 00:57:24.705]  You can barely hear it.
[00:57:25.126 --> 00:57:25.726]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:25.966 --> 00:57:27.367]  And this just gave the same effect.
[00:57:27.427 --> 00:57:29.107]  So I think it's pretty clear.
[00:57:29.587 --> 00:57:30.468]  It sounds pretty clear.
[00:57:31.388 --> 00:57:37.251]  So there is a cover-up going on, and the Sheriff's Department's sending signals, but they're being told, obviously, don't, for whatever reason.
[00:57:37.531 --> 00:57:47.876]  We're going to do five more minutes with Craig Sawyer of technicalinsider.com, and then we'll, uh, having one of the stars of Eye Wide Shut on, uh, getting into the Satanism, uh, in the film, and what's really behind that.
[00:57:47.956 --> 00:57:50.818]  I personally have interviewed Vivian Kubrick, the only interview she's done.
[00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:57.105]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:57:57.906 --> 00:58:00.828]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:58:01.508 --> 00:58:04.310]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:09.814]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.

[00:58:16.838 --> 00:58:21.982]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[00:58:22.662 --> 00:58:26.105]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[00:58:26.665 --> 00:58:34.491]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:39.415]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.

[01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.074]  I'm good.
[01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:21.816]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:31.803]  That's right, the globalists are trying to kill America, but if Trump and all of us are successful, I'll have to retire all these liners that I've had for many years because there's a civil war going on.
[01:00:31.823 --> 01:00:32.924]  We're retaking the country.
[01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:33.725]  Craig,
[01:00:35.103 --> 01:00:38.244]  We know the police have said it's impossible to act alone.
[01:00:38.824 --> 01:00:41.105]  The Sheriff's Department, uh, we're looking at radicalization.
[01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:46.987]  They're giving us clues, but then they're being pressured to say, oh, but the, you know, there was ballistics written on this note.
[01:00:47.327 --> 01:00:48.448]  He's got 22 guns.
[01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:49.668]  It's different ballistics.
[01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:57.351]  He just threw a, I'm not a sniper like you, top sniper, but you know, do the range finder, have it set to your firearm, 400, 500 yards away.
[01:00:57.371 --> 01:01:02.072]  I mean, that seems like zero in at 400 yards, uh, and then just raise up higher.
[01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:04.053]  If we're going to go higher than that, he was mainly shooting at the,
[01:01:04.693 --> 01:01:06.875]  That's what leads me back to the bigger picture.
[01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:07.816]  There would need to be no
[01:01:25.043 --> 01:01:34.695]  Manipulation and pressure put on local law enforcement and the Sheriff's Department by the feds if there were not a narrative that they were desperate to hide.
[01:01:35.116 --> 01:01:43.927]  If it were just the truth, they would encourage the locals just to stay quiet about the case so that they could make their prosecutions on a federal level.
[01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:58.424]  But to ask them to change the facts and not to tell certain things and to mislead people, then that leads me to believe, you know, that there's something crooked going on.
[01:01:58.504 --> 01:02:02.987]  And look, I mean, I served under David Knowlton there in Las Vegas as a federal agent.
[01:02:03.027 --> 01:02:05.468]  I don't trust that man as far as I can throw him.
[01:02:05.548 --> 01:02:07.729]  He's one of the top dogs at the FBI before.
[01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:12.551]  They got rid of him and it came to the Air Marshal Service and then eventually Air Marshal Service got rid of him.
[01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:22.134]  That guy, if he's any indication of what the FBI is about these days, then that agency's hurting in a shattered shell of what they once were.
[01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:26.496]  Well we know they chopped it full of all these Obama and Soros operatives, that's on record.
[01:02:26.816 --> 01:02:36.860]  And since you mentioned things like anomalies, they told us over and over again, I mean there's so many points to this.
[01:02:38.649 --> 01:02:40.310]  And in fact, he was just popping in my ear a minute ago.
[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:41.310]  What was the point you were making?
[01:02:44.192 --> 01:02:44.592]  There it is.
[01:02:44.652 --> 01:02:45.112]  Valet.
[01:02:45.132 --> 01:02:47.253]  Yeah, I mean, there's so many anomalies here.
[01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:48.854]  Valet, entries proved.
[01:02:48.894 --> 01:02:50.875]  Paddock checked in three days before date given.
[01:02:51.175 --> 01:02:53.416]  We got the receipt showing he had a woman in there.
[01:02:53.756 --> 01:02:56.658]  Days before, later, the next day, the Sheriff's Department admitted that.
[01:02:57.078 --> 01:02:58.138]  I mean, there's so many anomalies.
[01:02:58.178 --> 01:02:59.359]  I try to think of them all, Craig.
[01:02:59.619 --> 01:03:00.419]  It gives me a headache.
[01:03:00.439 --> 01:03:01.520]  We're being lied to.
[01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:08.120]  Well, I've been busy with Vets for Child Rescue and the work that we're doing, Alex.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.964]  So I haven't heard everything that's out there on this Vegas case.
[01:03:12.004 --> 01:03:18.891]  But one of the things that I think I should have heard, but have not through a lot of these studies, is the valet.
[01:03:18.951 --> 01:03:20.132]  You said the word valet.
[01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:24.737]  Well, whenever I go to check into a Vegas hotel, there's always, you know, valet there.
[01:03:24.777 --> 01:03:25.718]  They've got the big cart.
[01:03:25.858 --> 01:03:26.819]  And if you've got, you know,
[01:03:27.478 --> 01:03:28.999]  Two or three people checking in.
[01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:36.302]  There's two carts and they'll stack all your luggage and take them up a back elevator that nobody sees and bring them right to your room and put them down.
[01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.584]  And I would look for that.
[01:03:38.644 --> 01:03:43.686]  I don't I'm not necessarily convinced that that Paddock would have shuttled his own baggage.
[01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:50.289]  I mean, he could have broken these weapons down and had them in regular suitcases and the valet would have taken them straight to his room for him.
[01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:55.352]  So that's that's something I'm surprised I haven't heard somebody else mention because that's generally how it works.
[01:03:55.512 --> 01:03:56.633]  Well, they've not denied this.
[01:03:56.793 --> 01:03:59.035]  Homeland Security raided the hotel again Friday.
[01:03:59.075 --> 01:04:01.056]  People aren't even knowing that, but I have that from sources.
[01:04:01.076 --> 01:04:02.518]  I mean, they raided it.
[01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.260]  We're getting in their computers and things, so who knows what's going on.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:12.145]  Then you've got the whole hotel being huge Soros donors and giving to the Arab Spring and giving to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:04:12.385 --> 01:04:13.306]  That's all confirmed.
[01:04:13.326 --> 01:04:14.307]  They told employees.
[01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:16.283]  Yeah, that's a good.
[01:04:16.323 --> 01:04:17.584]  That's a big factor, Alex.
[01:04:17.644 --> 01:04:18.365]  And that's a man.
[01:04:18.405 --> 01:04:20.806]  Shame on us if we're not digging into that one big time.
[01:04:20.846 --> 01:04:32.273]  If the owner of that hotel is given to the radicals and giving to the anti-Americans and there's a lot of money flow behind this arms deal and the arrangements, man, that's that's huge.
[01:04:32.353 --> 01:04:32.974]  That's huge.
[01:04:33.414 --> 01:04:36.416]  So big indicating factor must be followed up on big time.
[01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:44.462]  Well, Craig, as soon as you're done, the next few days, the work you're doing at TacticalInsider.com and Vets4ChildRescue.org, please come back on.
[01:04:44.482 --> 01:04:48.484]  Let's do a big breakdown of the latest on the war on pedophiles that's expanding.
[01:04:48.765 --> 01:04:49.765]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.527]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on once again.
[01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:53.128]  Thank you.
[01:04:53.148 --> 01:04:54.229]  That's a great guy right there.
[01:04:55.209 --> 01:04:57.311]  Federal forensic expert in federal court.
[01:04:57.891 --> 01:04:59.492]  I mean, that's a top guy to get on about this.
[01:04:59.572 --> 01:05:01.574]  He says, stinks to high heaven, folks.
[01:05:04.364 --> 01:05:07.765]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:15.247]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:05:15.847 --> 01:05:24.209]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:31.071]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:31.591]  We're good.
[01:05:53.302 --> 01:05:55.924]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:05:56.164 --> 01:05:59.127]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:05:59.267 --> 01:06:02.229]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:10.796]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:06:13.358 --> 01:06:17.281]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:24.858 --> 01:06:33.521]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:40.398]  It's funny how synchronicity, or is it serendipity, works.
[01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:44.361]  There's big breaking Stanley Kubrick news today.
[01:06:45.321 --> 01:06:48.264]  It's up on DrugsReport.com and Infowars.com.
[01:06:49.104 --> 01:06:50.265]  It's out of the Daily Beast.
[01:06:50.805 --> 01:06:55.589]  Stanley Kubrick's right-hand man speaks the personal toll of working with a genius.
[01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:57.750]  It's a very flattering...
[01:06:59.091 --> 01:07:04.553]  Interview Julian Davis is a big actress and dancer and out in Hollywood and hundreds of films.
[01:07:04.573 --> 01:07:12.577]  I'm not gonna get into her whole bio, but she was in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and she's the lady in the satanic ritual who they kill.
[01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.252]  Later he's got to go look at her dead body, uh, that is Tom Cruise does.
[01:07:17.932 --> 01:07:26.536]  And so I was walking along a few weeks ago, here in the morning when David Knight's on, weekdays, 8am to 11am, and I say, wow, what's that Stanley Kubrick news I see, and who's that lady?
[01:07:27.497 --> 01:07:28.197]  And I recognized her.
[01:07:28.217 --> 01:07:29.578]  I said, is that the lady they kill in the movie?
[01:07:29.598 --> 01:07:31.198]  And they said, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:31.939]  So I was like, wow.
[01:07:33.055 --> 01:07:45.760]  So I wanted to get her on because I don't want to break with confidence of what Vivian Kubrick, who was to a great extent one of Stanley Kubrick's proteges, was his favorite daughter, that's admitted.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.641]  I don't just believe the stuff she told me.
[01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:53.984]  She came to one of my events in Dallas four years ago and just told me just for days, it was wild stuff.
[01:07:56.636 --> 01:07:57.537]  She was pretty smart, too.
[01:07:57.617 --> 01:07:59.820]  She had some insights into my own life that nobody else had.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:06.848]  So she's definitely a tuned-in lady, and she told me the secrets of Stanley Kubrick, which you could definitely write a book about, but I'm not going to because they were done in confidence.
[01:08:07.929 --> 01:08:13.656]  But if we get this from somebody else, maybe she's got clues, or maybe she's got
[01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:24.866]  Uh, pieces, but just as we see in the news, all the occultism and now things like Eyes Wide Shut being done officially at big parties and fashion shows inside Catholic churches in London.
[01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:26.607]  Uh, what is going on?
[01:08:26.627 --> 01:08:30.351]  But what was it like, here's the big question, to be in Eyes Wide Shut?
[01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:35.516]  With Tom Cruise and of course his wife, Nicole Kidman.
[01:08:36.016 --> 01:08:44.119]  And then I remember from, I wasn't a big Hollywood guy at the time, but I miss people in Hollywood, they said, oh my gosh, Kubrick doesn't want 24 minutes cut.
[01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:46.180]  He's throwing fits, he has final cut, he says no.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.381]  So contractually, they couldn't cut it even though he'd gone over budget.
[01:08:51.262 --> 01:08:54.123]  And then they cut the time and he had a heart attack and died.
[01:08:55.343 --> 01:08:57.044]  So the question is, was he killed?
[01:08:57.064 --> 01:09:00.665]  We're blurring this out so folks don't see the full
[01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:02.852]  Hey, thanks Alex for having me.
[01:09:27.438 --> 01:09:33.370]  Um, you know, really, when I shot the film, they didn't tell me any information at all.
[01:09:34.828 --> 01:09:36.450]  We were really clueless.
[01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:37.490]  I hate to tell you that.
[01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:45.797]  And I don't want to throw a big wet blanket on the theory that something happened to him that was nefarious.
[01:09:46.437 --> 01:09:49.239]  But honest to God, he was not a young 70.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:56.905]  And so maybe the stress of finally finishing the edit or whatever, his body just went, I'm done.
[01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:57.806]  You know?
[01:09:58.151 --> 01:10:03.632]  Well, he would totally commit to stuff, like as you said, 24 hours a day, somebody's not sleeping, not even using drugs.
[01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.292]  I mean, not even using drugs to do it.
[01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:07.413]  We were working very late nights.
[01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:14.394]  We started our hours, especially during those whole ritual scenes, the hours we started at 2 p.m.
[01:10:14.654 --> 01:10:19.095]  and would break at 2, 2.30 in the morning, sometimes 3.
[01:10:19.175 --> 01:10:22.995]  Well, did you, I mean, did you ever talk to Kubrick when you were on the set about why?
[01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:24.256]  Oh, I talked to him plenty.
[01:10:24.276 --> 01:10:25.056]  All the time.
[01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:26.356]  All the time.
[01:10:27.116 --> 01:10:27.636]  Smart man.
[01:10:28.217 --> 01:10:30.358]  Didn't like to talk about himself too much.
[01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:34.781]  Didn't like to talk about his projects, except for he did talk about AI.
[01:10:34.801 --> 01:10:36.222]  He was very excited about AI.
[01:10:36.282 --> 01:10:38.503]  So I was... Because he was going to make that movie next.
[01:10:39.464 --> 01:10:40.244]  Yes, he was.
[01:10:40.644 --> 01:10:45.047]  And I remember him talking to me about it because, well, I'm from a kind of computer background.
[01:10:45.427 --> 01:10:46.468]  Not me, but my family.
[01:10:47.349 --> 01:10:47.829]  And, uh...
[01:10:49.042 --> 01:10:55.549]  He started talking about it and I said, Stanley, you haven't even finished, you know, filming this film, let alone editing.
[01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:58.112]  So, but yeah, he was very excited about it.
[01:10:58.132 --> 01:11:03.878]  It was a shame because it would have been an entirely different and, in my opinion, better film had he done it.
[01:11:04.799 --> 01:11:11.145]  Did you hear on the set or later about the controversy of why they cut 24 minutes?
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:13.720]  Well, sure.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:21.322]  One of the reasons they cut that time is that they thought that was a little bit too salacious for American markets.
[01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:24.023]  So there is a longer version for Europe.
[01:11:25.623 --> 01:11:27.423]  Oh my gosh, I need to see that immediately!
[01:11:27.443 --> 01:11:34.585]  Because I've been invited to these things, you know, below the caves there in England.
[01:11:34.865 --> 01:11:38.286]  I've never gone to those, so I guess I should see what I've missed, though.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.882]  There's just more, you know, more sex scenes, really.
[01:11:43.223 --> 01:11:50.389]  Um, scenes that I wasn't, those, the, uh, quote, action of the orgy scenes I wasn't involved with.
[01:11:51.009 --> 01:11:52.911]  Did you ever ask where he got the idea for this?
[01:11:54.612 --> 01:11:54.852]  No.
[01:11:55.453 --> 01:11:58.636]  In fact... Cause see, I know all about it, but I can't tell you.
[01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.349]  Okay, so it was very, very secretive.
[01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:10.533]  And, you know, when I booked that film, I was a nobody, so he wasn't going to divulge that information to me.
[01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:15.815]  I'm sure Tom knew what was going on, but, you know, even Tom was a bit closed-lipped in that respect.
[01:12:15.835 --> 01:12:18.676]  They didn't really talk about the film, they didn't talk about the story.
[01:12:18.696 --> 01:12:27.159]  I mean, since that time, you know, I know that there are Eyes Wide Shut parties going on all over the world.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.126]  Parties that I have not gone to.
[01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.756]  I'm not into that kind of thing.
[01:12:35.711 --> 01:12:41.076]  Well, they've got the original Hellfire Club at one of the two big British famous universities.
[01:12:41.737 --> 01:12:46.321]  And then, even if you don't go to the university, you get invited to go down to the caves and do it.
[01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:49.104]  There's Vivian Kubrick when she just popped up.
[01:12:49.384 --> 01:12:50.445]  I checked her out.
[01:12:50.646 --> 01:12:51.526]  It was Vivian Kubrick.
[01:12:51.546 --> 01:12:53.368]  Did the music for Apocalypse Now.
[01:12:53.388 --> 01:12:54.249]  I mean, not Apocalypse Now.
[01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:55.590]  For Full Metal Jacket.
[01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:56.291]  You name it.
[01:12:56.531 --> 01:12:58.833]  And then there she was, telling me all this wild stuff.
[01:12:59.354 --> 01:13:00.115]  It was pretty crazy.
[01:13:01.212 --> 01:13:04.273]  I would love to hear it, but I can understand if you can't share.
[01:13:05.033 --> 01:13:06.294]  Well, no, I mean, it's off record.
[01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:12.115]  You know, that's the problem is people want to tell you stuff and then it's off record and you can't tell people.
[01:13:13.176 --> 01:13:16.757]  Well, you know, there is a lot of dark stuff going on.
[01:13:16.857 --> 01:13:26.620]  I mean, I'm not one to, um, to entertain, uh, conspiracy theories all the time, but with all conspiracy theory,
[01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:34.451]  I tend to think there's some truth in it, so I'm just going to keep it over here and keep it in mind and just see what else transpires.
[01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:48.294]  But there's a lot of dark stuff going on, you know, I'm sure you've touched on it, the pedophile rings and Satanism and all that stuff, and obviously there's elements of that in this film.
[01:13:49.754 --> 01:13:52.035]  You know, for me personally,
[01:13:53.585 --> 01:13:58.848]  I haven't wanted to kind of delve too heavily into that stuff, just because it does creep me out.
[01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.069]  I just, I really don't want to be a part of that.
[01:14:01.089 --> 01:14:03.750]  But that's my next question, because I didn't work with the crew on this.
[01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.091]  I'm about to see it in my pants, just real interviews.
[01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:07.632]  I saw you on Night Show.
[01:14:07.692 --> 01:14:08.532]  How did you get on there?
[01:14:08.832 --> 01:14:09.953]  What is your political view?
[01:14:10.273 --> 01:14:16.536]  How is one of the stars, I mean you get killed in the movie, it's pretty important, Beville Bard, how are you now out talking?
[01:14:17.237 --> 01:14:17.877]  This is awesome.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.481]  Oh, you mean about conservatism and things like that?
[01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:24.642]  Yes, your political views, which would get you ostracized, obviously.
[01:14:25.362 --> 01:14:26.162]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:35.545]  Well, I started off last year, somebody approached me about writing for Heat Street Magazine and writing about some of my experiences for Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:14:36.365 --> 01:14:42.106]  And one article turned into two articles, turned into ten articles, turned into twenty articles, etc.
[01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:47.688]  Unfortunately, Heat Street closed, and one of the editors went over to Fox,
[01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:59.752]  And I thought, you know, I'm really enjoying writing and I'm enjoying finally coming clean about how I felt, how I feel about conservatism, what's happening in the world today.
[01:14:59.772 --> 01:15:05.274]  And so I went to Fox, wrote this article, blew up in the press.
[01:15:05.294 --> 01:15:06.315]  I had no idea.
[01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:11.157]  I mean, I figured it was just going to be, you know, just one of many articles in the Off-Ed section.
[01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:14.494]  Yeah, it just blew up.
[01:15:15.555 --> 01:15:16.516]  I'm happy it did, though.
[01:15:16.536 --> 01:15:25.829]  I think that the issues that I've been discussing and what I believe to be true is something that everybody should be discussing.
[01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:28.172]  We need to figure out a way to change
[01:15:31.764 --> 01:15:34.145]  The path that the world is going down.
[01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:35.206]  I think we're going down.
[01:15:35.226 --> 01:15:39.389]  And there's a big shift happening, because for me it's not even about conservative or liberal, but I get to be separated.
[01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:44.592]  You say conservative, it's just like I'm not in this big Hollywood cult, you know, with the Weinsteins and everything else.
[01:15:44.632 --> 01:15:45.793]  It's all coming down.
[01:15:46.153 --> 01:15:47.193]  I like common sense.
[01:15:47.233 --> 01:15:58.180]  Let's talk about where you see all this going straight ahead and maybe I'll tell folks, I don't want to give up any confidence, I'll tell you a little bit about the secret behind Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.421]  Just a little bit.
[01:16:02.113 --> 01:16:10.256]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:16:10.516 --> 01:16:14.197]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:21.379]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:16:21.579 --> 01:16:22.880]  So I'm offering for the first time ever,
[01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.063]  50% off and I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:36.111]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:16:36.131 --> 01:16:37.092]  They know how great it is.
[01:16:38.013 --> 01:16:41.756]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:16:42.697 --> 01:16:44.098]  Tropic means for the brain.
[01:16:44.898 --> 01:16:52.761]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:58.983]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:16:59.023 --> 01:16:59.504]  That comes to $50.99.
[01:17:05.666 --> 01:17:06.267]  Zero three.
[01:17:06.287 --> 01:17:08.829]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:12.392]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:17:12.432 --> 01:17:13.373]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:17:14.574 --> 01:17:15.275]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:21.881 --> 01:17:27.284]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:17:27.544 --> 01:17:41.352]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus, or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get

[01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:20.060]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.127]  And we're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:18:26.487 --> 01:18:35.399]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen and more.
[01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:36.540]  Concentrate.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.341]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:18:38.602 --> 01:18:40.043]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:18:40.263 --> 01:18:41.885]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:18:42.305 --> 01:18:43.166]  It's incredible.
[01:18:43.647 --> 01:18:45.568]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:18:45.749 --> 01:18:46.890]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:48.251]  At 15, incredible.
[01:18:48.571 --> 01:18:49.472]  It is amazing.
[01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:51.094]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:51.534 --> 01:18:52.655]  50% off Caveman.
[01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.197]  But only a few days left.
[01:18:54.457 --> 01:18:55.198]  It's about to end.
[01:18:55.778 --> 01:18:58.120]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.724]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:19:04.144 --> 01:19:05.545]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:19:05.805 --> 01:19:06.946]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:19:07.346 --> 01:19:08.147]  I want to thank you.
[01:19:08.487 --> 01:19:09.528]  We're all in this together.
[01:19:10.048 --> 01:19:19.955]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:36.087]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:19:36.347 --> 01:19:41.692]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[01:20:04.832 --> 01:20:07.455]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.461 --> 01:20:23.803]  The space-time continuum.
[01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:27.324]  Some can see, others can't.
[01:20:27.444 --> 01:20:30.866]  A frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[01:20:31.506 --> 01:20:35.408]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:41.191]  Now, I mean, I'll tell you.
[01:20:43.163 --> 01:20:47.245]  I didn't used to chase Hollywood around, but sometimes I'd be involved with it because I'd be on national television shows.
[01:20:47.785 --> 01:21:04.894]  Speak of the devil, I was out once in L.A., then once in Vegas, and I was with a major director for dinner, wanted to go to dinner with me, and he said, you know, the Hellfire Club that Benjamin Franklin went to is real, and you're going to get an invite to this major university in England, and if you want to join us, you should just go, be part of the event, it's down in these caves, you'll have a good time.
[01:21:04.914 --> 01:21:06.395]  And I said, well, what's it like?
[01:21:06.415 --> 01:21:07.576]  It was kind of like Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:21:08.716 --> 01:21:09.557]  And I said, no.
[01:21:11.002 --> 01:21:14.165]  And so, if you want to get a little inside baseball, that's what goes on.
[01:21:15.046 --> 01:21:16.687]  He told me the invitation was coming.
[01:21:17.288 --> 01:21:24.834]  Months later, the invitation to the major university, one of the most famous in the world, showed up at the office.
[01:21:24.854 --> 01:21:26.856]  I mean, I'll just say it.
[01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:29.839]  He said, Oxford is going to invite you, but then that's just the invite.
[01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:34.483]  The speech to the faculty of Oxford, it wasn't just speak at Oxford, it was speak to Oxford.
[01:21:35.345 --> 01:21:42.253]  I remember Nico Acosta, the uh, just like Gandhi spoke there and Martin Luther King and all this, he said, this is actually to the faculty, you're not going to do it.
[01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:44.175]  I said, no I'm not doing it, because that's not what it is.
[01:21:45.036 --> 01:21:55.888]  Because I've already been told, you're going to be given this offer, and at the time it's a major directory, you know, okay, maybe this person's messing with me, but then the creepiness of it.
[01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:58.811]  Yeah, the whole deal, like, join these people.
[01:21:58.891 --> 01:22:00.052]  What the hell are they involved in?
[01:22:00.732 --> 01:22:10.418]  So we have a Hollywood actress, dancer, joining us, Julianne Davis, and she was in Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.139]  She gets sacrificed in Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.321]  I know they cut 24 minutes out of the film.
[01:22:14.801 --> 01:22:16.722]  No, she probably signed a non-disclosure about what was in there.
[01:22:16.742 --> 01:22:18.062]  I'll have her back for a full hour soon.
[01:22:18.082 --> 01:22:24.244]  Now she's a syndicated columnist doing a great job going through the intimidation of being a patriot, a conservative, and being more successful.
[01:22:24.264 --> 01:22:25.825]  I think that's the story here for what I got from her.
[01:22:25.845 --> 01:22:29.566]  But because of the time we have left here, you've heard my little story.
[01:22:29.626 --> 01:22:33.268]  But the bottom line on Kubrick was he was not an insider.
[01:22:34.728 --> 01:22:35.708]  I'll give the big secret out.
[01:22:36.129 --> 01:22:39.830]  He was, but without giving any details, he was dialed into the ether
[01:22:41.654 --> 01:22:42.254]  Of course!
[01:23:02.924 --> 01:23:06.849]  I never give up sources, this is behind-the-scenes stuff I've seen to say for safety, quite frankly.
[01:23:07.309 --> 01:23:13.397]  That he, like the CIA, and I already read this before, but I was told that the CIA came to him and said, how do you know about Plan R?
[01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.760]  And how do you know about the decoders on the B-52s?
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.422]  And how do you know about the nuke attacks?
[01:23:17.622 --> 01:23:19.985]  And he had to tell them, I just had a dream about it.
[01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:26.168]  Okay, I'm giving some big secrets out here, and I'm planning to write a big book about it, but we got six minutes left.
[01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:27.169]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:28.789]  I hope you come back for a full hour in your future.
[01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:33.011]  What is your big brain trust on just this whole crazy world we're living in?
[01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:38.853]  I think it was funny during the break you mentioned the New World Order.
[01:23:38.873 --> 01:23:45.676]  I think that's absolutely real, and it's very interesting that the resist movement
[01:23:47.256 --> 01:23:48.256]  What are they resisting?
[01:23:48.756 --> 01:23:49.697]  They're part of it.
[01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:51.157]  They're part of the establishment.
[01:23:51.177 --> 01:23:53.258]  They're part of the New World Order.
[01:23:54.338 --> 01:23:57.059]  We, on the other side, we are the true rebels.
[01:23:57.819 --> 01:23:58.879]  We are the resistance.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.400]  I think it's insane what's happening today.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.940]  I think we need to fight against it.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.521]  I think we need to do everything we can to continue to fight against it.
[01:24:07.561 --> 01:24:09.602]  We need to keep our guns.
[01:24:10.482 --> 01:24:13.463]  We need to... I feel like America is the
[01:24:14.989 --> 01:24:18.231]  America is the world's last great hope against this.
[01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:32.859]  And if we don't make sure that the New World Order, if we allow them to take control, we're going to be in big trouble.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:33.980]  Big trouble.
[01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:37.622]  So have you, in fact, I'm just changing subject really quickly.
[01:24:38.463 --> 01:24:42.545]  Have you seen the Gotthard Tunnel opening ceremony?
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.221]  In Switzerland?
[01:24:44.441 --> 01:24:45.221]  Have you seen that?
[01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:47.022]  No, say it again, I heard about it.
[01:24:48.242 --> 01:24:49.523]  Oh, go and watch it.
[01:24:50.463 --> 01:24:55.846]  It is a full Satanist show.
[01:24:57.206 --> 01:24:57.947]  Go and watch it.
[01:24:58.347 --> 01:25:11.273]  And when you see that, you look at all of these things, you look at that, you look at these Eyes Wide Shut parties, the New World Order, the pedophile rings, all the stuff you think, there's something really funny going on here.
[01:25:11.843 --> 01:25:12.804]  Well, I'll just say this.
[01:25:12.924 --> 01:25:15.387]  They did come after Stanley Kubrick for what he was doing.
[01:25:16.368 --> 01:25:18.691]  And they wanted to know how he knew.
[01:25:19.492 --> 01:25:20.913]  And he didn't even know.
[01:25:20.953 --> 01:25:24.677]  He just said, I just have this idea, and this is it.
[01:25:24.717 --> 01:25:25.718]  And why are they so angry?
[01:25:25.738 --> 01:25:28.622]  It was like he was just dialed in to what was going on.
[01:25:28.642 --> 01:25:31.024]  Stanley's a very smart man.
[01:25:31.365 --> 01:25:32.826]  Very smart man.
[01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:42.794]  He read a lot, he researched a ton, and whether he was out and about, which he wasn't very much, he mostly was at his home.
[01:25:42.834 --> 01:25:43.654]  Very reclusive.
[01:25:44.414 --> 01:25:52.257]  Yes, but he had a lot of people out there doing things for him, seeing things for him, being his eyes and ears.
[01:25:53.424 --> 01:25:53.604]  Yeah.
[01:25:54.424 --> 01:25:59.367]  Well, I hope you'll come back for a full hour with us soon, because I'm just really excited about the work you're doing.
[01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:02.328]  And I've read some of your articles as well, but did I get it wrong?
[01:26:02.368 --> 01:26:08.471]  Like, you came out with your conservatism out of the closet, and then you were more successful by doing so.
[01:26:10.211 --> 01:26:12.032]  Well, I wasn't more successful in Hollywood.
[01:26:13.013 --> 01:26:16.494]  I've definitely gotten some attention amongst conservative press.
[01:26:17.735 --> 01:26:20.636]  And I've been dissed by Bill Maher, so that's something.
[01:26:23.436 --> 01:26:37.964]  You know, the way I look at my career in Hollywood, most of the stuff that I do is independent, and I could afford to speak up because I'm not ensconced with a network or a big studio right now.
[01:26:38.684 --> 01:26:42.867]  And I wish others would, but I understand why they don't, because, you know, their paycheck
[01:26:43.627 --> 01:26:51.774]  But the NFL's down 31% this year, 50-plus percent the last three years, another 20% on there, and it's accelerating, and Hollywood's falling apart.
[01:26:51.854 --> 01:26:55.357]  I mean, don't they get that they're destroying the Golden Goose?
[01:26:56.538 --> 01:26:59.420]  They don't understand because they're in their little bubble.
[01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:06.646]  And, you know, when you're in Hollywood circles, they assume that you feel exactly the same way they do.
[01:27:07.527 --> 01:27:12.411]  And so they'll say things where they just expect you to go, oh yeah, totally agree.
[01:27:13.197 --> 01:27:20.280]  Meanwhile, those of us who are conservative, whether we're in the closet or not, usually go, mm, uh-huh.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.901]  Does a conservative, to me, it just means common sense.
[01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:23.601]  Yeah.
[01:27:24.662 --> 01:27:26.522]  Because I'm not against anybody because they're liberal.
[01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:29.003]  I just want common sense that always works, you know?
[01:27:29.023 --> 01:27:34.766]  Did you hear about California legalizing, it's like a misdemeanor now, putting HIV into the blood supply and giving people AIDS?
[01:27:34.786 --> 01:27:35.326]  Did you hear that?
[01:27:36.526 --> 01:27:36.967]  No.
[01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:38.627]  No, I didn't.
[01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:39.568]  It sounds insane.
[01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.128]  I've got the L.A.
[01:27:41.148 --> 01:27:42.669]  Times here, just like it's totally normal.
[01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.653]  That's a whole other discussion for us to have.
[01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.033]  Here it is.
[01:27:46.393 --> 01:27:54.358]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner with HIV without disclosing the infection.
[01:27:54.738 --> 01:27:59.521]  The measure also applies to those who give blow without telling the blood bank that they are HIV positive.
[01:27:59.541 --> 01:27:59.761]  That's L.A.
[01:28:00.062 --> 01:28:00.322]  Times.
[01:28:01.983 --> 01:28:02.383]  Wow.
[01:28:03.063 --> 01:28:07.066]  Looks like I'm going to be donating blood to keep for myself just in case.
[01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:12.542]  That's pretty... You know, you've got to come back to get more into Eyes Wide Shut here in the future.
[01:28:12.562 --> 01:28:15.086]  But Jess, was there... I mean, like, you get killed in the movie.
[01:28:15.126 --> 01:28:18.410]  Did they... Was there another scene they cut how you got killed?
[01:28:19.745 --> 01:28:23.326]  Uh, no, and I remember talking to Todd Field about this.
[01:28:23.426 --> 01:28:32.867]  Todd and I both agreed that we didn't, you know, in the film it says basically that I had an OD, but Todd and I both agreed I was killed and so was he.
[01:28:32.927 --> 01:28:35.508]  Never got back home to his family after playing that keyboard.
[01:28:36.248 --> 01:28:37.688]  So, yeah.
[01:28:38.288 --> 01:28:47.750]  But no, I mean, obviously Tom and Nicole were privy to the entire script, but I was just a little minion at the time, so I was not privy to that information.
[01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:48.750]  I wish I could tell you more.
[01:28:49.315 --> 01:28:53.359]  Well, promise us, because we're really impressed with what you're doing, that you'll join us again.
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.020]  I would love to.
[01:28:55.321 --> 01:28:55.881]  I'd love to.
[01:28:55.901 --> 01:28:58.143]  I'd love to talk more about everything.
[01:28:58.584 --> 01:28:59.324]  Please come back.
[01:28:59.364 --> 01:29:00.125]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:01.326 --> 01:29:02.888]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:09.474]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:29:09.734 --> 01:29:10.855]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:11.115 --> 01:29:13.417]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:29:14.077 --> 01:29:20.602]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:29:20.802 --> 01:29:24.144]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:29:24.464 --> 01:29:26.266]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:29:26.906 --> 01:29:35.314]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:29:35.354 --> 01:29:36.295]  They know how great it is.
[01:29:37.236 --> 01:29:41.019]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.281]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:29:44.102 --> 01:29:51.984]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:29:52.404 --> 01:30:00.907]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:30:01.447 --> 01:30:03.867]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:30:04.007 --> 01:30:08.049]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:11.369]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:14.651]  It's a good deal at $39.

[01:31:25.632 --> 01:31:34.505]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth, Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen, and more.
[01:31:35.046 --> 01:31:35.687]  Concentrate.
[01:31:35.707 --> 01:31:37.488]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:31:37.768 --> 01:31:39.129]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:41.031]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:31:41.451 --> 01:31:42.312]  It's incredible.
[01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:44.713]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:31:44.894 --> 01:31:46.034]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:31:46.495 --> 01:31:47.395]  At 15, incredible.
[01:31:47.716 --> 01:31:48.616]  It is amazing.
[01:31:48.977 --> 01:31:50.238]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:50.678 --> 01:31:51.799]  50% off Caveman.
[01:31:52.019 --> 01:31:53.340]  But only a few days left.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.341]  It's about to end.
[01:31:54.941 --> 01:31:57.262]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:31:57.703 --> 01:32:02.885]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:32:03.306 --> 01:32:04.686]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:32:04.946 --> 01:32:06.107]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.308]  I want to thank you.
[01:32:07.628 --> 01:32:08.688]  We're all in this together.
[01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:19.094]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:23.257]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:25.299]  But these specials have got to end.
[01:32:25.319 --> 01:32:35.247]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:40.852]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:32:41.353 --> 01:32:45.977]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[01:32:46.617 --> 01:32:54.263]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:54.624 --> 01:32:59.448]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:33:04.772 --> 01:33:07.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.771]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:23.591]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:26.272]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.492 --> 01:33:28.833]  We are Roger Ready.
[01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:31.173]  You realize that?
[01:33:31.233 --> 01:33:31.993]  Roger means ready.
[01:33:32.293 --> 01:33:33.094]  Roger means I get it.
[01:33:33.114 --> 01:33:35.334]  Talking to Roger Stone here in a minute.
[01:33:35.714 --> 01:33:38.415]  You know, I called him up this morning and I said, you gotta come on.
[01:33:39.715 --> 01:33:43.396]  Because it isn't about Corker saying he's not gonna run again.
[01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:46.317]  It's a... It's not about this loser.
[01:33:47.185 --> 01:33:49.706]  It's about the anatomy of media deception.
[01:33:50.547 --> 01:33:53.708]  Because I know the whole backstory of Corker, not just from Roger Stone, but from others.
[01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:56.270]  I mean, what a nasty, dirty creature.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:12.618]  And the fact that you have this big Judge Roy Moore win in Alabama, and Corker running for the hills, and then CNN puts out a story that, oh, Trump claimed that Corker begged for endorsement as false sources say, they just turned everything upside down.
[01:34:14.997 --> 01:34:23.319]  So it's just, it's not about Corker, it's about illustrating, with this example, how they manipulate every story they engage in.
[01:34:23.599 --> 01:34:24.839]  We'll talk to Roger Stone here in a moment.
[01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:30.800]  First off, we've got four or five, what is it, yeah, five different specials that are gonna end tomorrow.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.000]  We're gonna have to end them.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:41.442]  We've got Caveman, with a concentrated, super high quality bone broth, so good for your joints, your bones, everything, with a chaga mushroom, the bee pollen,
[01:34:42.382 --> 01:34:47.948]  The turmeric concentrate, totally organic, and it's just got five or six other superfoods in it.
[01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:52.272]  It's got the organic alfalfa powder protein.
[01:34:52.312 --> 01:34:53.414]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.738]  Next, we're talking like, in my experience, ten times better than Pure Whey.
[01:34:57.798 --> 01:35:00.040]  We sell high-quality whey from a big national brand.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:03.424]  We private label and sell for five to ten dollars less than what they sell in stores.
[01:35:03.744 --> 01:35:04.865]  So our whey is good as well.
[01:35:05.626 --> 01:35:07.568]  Caveman on chocolate and strawberry.
[01:35:07.608 --> 01:35:11.231]  That's going to have to end in the next few days because I'm running low on supplies.
[01:35:11.251 --> 01:35:13.393]  It may be until December that we get more.
[01:35:13.433 --> 01:35:14.694]  So Caveman available now.
[01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:18.177]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:34.768]  Now, the new big special, that I was going to run for two weeks, may end this week, because they're flying off the shelves, been sold out for two months, Brain Force, that I know Roger loves, took the top nootropics of the country, combined them together, got organic sources, cut the price by half.
[01:35:35.168 --> 01:35:39.591]  Other leading brands are $60, we normally sell it for, you know, $35.
[01:35:39.751 --> 01:35:44.694]  It's $19.95 right now, which is normally like $40, but we discount it, you know, 10-15%.
[01:35:45.074 --> 01:35:49.437]  But right now it's 50% off, InfoWarsLive.com, but it could end any day because
[01:35:50.546 --> 01:35:52.207]  Folks are loving it, and that's the great part.
[01:35:52.227 --> 01:35:56.368]  The problem is we've got to sell a lot of it to make money to fund our operation.
[01:35:56.388 --> 01:36:05.010]  Because if you sign up for AutoShip, a little secret, that's an additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip for something you want to reship, so you don't forget and just support the broadcast, get products you want and love.
[01:36:05.971 --> 01:36:07.271]  It's basically a loss-leader at that.
[01:36:07.451 --> 01:36:10.132]  And we have free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:10.532 --> 01:36:17.434]  Free shipping on all orders for $50 or more at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or, of course, by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:20.882 --> 01:36:21.442]  Let me say this.
[01:36:23.083 --> 01:36:28.926]  Everyone knows, who's been watching for a long time, that my pole star, my north star, is the truth.
[01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:34.089]  It's more important than myself, my children, anything else.
[01:36:34.389 --> 01:36:36.370]  Because if there's not truth, they have no future anyways.
[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.810]  The truth's number one.
[01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:40.672]  So when we're in trouble, I'll tell you we're in trouble.
[01:36:41.633 --> 01:36:43.876]  When we're winning, I'm going to tell you we're winning, okay?
[01:36:44.677 --> 01:36:46.199]  Trump's manifestation of the awakening.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:57.072]  The economy's up, 3.1% growth rate, hundreds of billions of dollars in new jobs, the globalists are panicking, the Democratic Party is a mentally ill
[01:36:58.348 --> 01:37:00.131]  I mean, this is an ultradominant domination.
[01:37:14.881 --> 01:37:24.745]  That said, we've got to maintain true to our cause, but also understand their insanity is intensifying to take every fact and invert it.
[01:37:25.366 --> 01:37:28.887]  So you basically take anything they do, turn it upside down, you're getting a clear picture.
[01:37:29.267 --> 01:37:32.449]  So that's kind of the decoder wheel here we're engaged in.
[01:37:32.509 --> 01:37:34.650]  But again, Corker is a loser.
[01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:39.533]  Corker is resigning because of corruption investigations that we're going to break here.
[01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:42.815]  I've known about for a year before Trump even got elected.
[01:37:43.135 --> 01:37:44.095]  I got it from other sources.
[01:37:44.195 --> 01:37:45.396]  I asked Stone about it six months ago.
[01:37:45.416 --> 01:37:51.780]  He said, yeah, Stone has the whole nine yards of Corker's literal beyond brown nosing.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.482]  I mean, we're talking supplication to Trump.
[01:37:55.702 --> 01:38:04.488]  And it just illustrates how pathetic they are that they even take these losers that are failing, who are having to resign, and step down because they know the big sweep's coming.
[01:38:04.808 --> 01:38:07.370]  You got Eric Prince, who is a patriot, folks.
[01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.871]  Anti-globalist patriot.
[01:38:09.612 --> 01:38:12.694]  Getting ready to run out west.
[01:38:13.114 --> 01:38:16.536]  So joining us is Roger Stone in this segment and the next to break it all down.
[01:38:16.556 --> 01:38:18.818]  But again, Corker isn't worth this discussion.
[01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:23.110]  It's CNN saying Corker spurned Trump.
[01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:24.051]  Trump's a loser.
[01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:25.991]  No, Corker gave up.
[01:38:26.471 --> 01:38:28.812]  Corker's running around with his tail behind his legs.
[01:38:29.232 --> 01:38:30.433]  Corker is a joke.
[01:38:30.513 --> 01:38:31.373]  Corker's gone.
[01:38:31.653 --> 01:38:34.654]  It just shows the inversion of reality they engage in.
[01:38:34.695 --> 01:38:35.255]  Roger Stone.
[01:38:37.015 --> 01:38:38.976]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:38:38.996 --> 01:38:46.219]  Of all the guys mainstream media seek to now deify as some kind of truth teller, Robert Corker.
[01:38:46.319 --> 01:38:49.200]  I mean, you may recall that Corker
[01:38:50.394 --> 01:38:57.397]  Uh, appeared at Trump Tower during the time that Donald Trump was openly looking, uh, at running things.
[01:38:58.177 --> 01:39:02.439]  Uh, and, uh, you know, Chris Christie, Dirk Gingrich, Mike Pence, and so on.
[01:39:02.499 --> 01:39:15.784]  Of course, Corker told the media that he'd been summonsed to Trump Tower, like it was an audition, when in fact Corker invited himself and reached out to the presumptive nominee and asked to meet with him.
[01:39:16.528 --> 01:39:26.938]  At the end of the meeting, which was really inconclusive and had no point, Cook said, Now, Bob, if you want to go downstairs and tell them that you're under consideration, I understand.
[01:39:26.958 --> 01:39:28.979]  Of course you understand, you're not.
[01:39:28.999 --> 01:39:32.923]  Of course, Corker went down and hinted that he was on the short list.
[01:39:33.763 --> 01:39:47.505]  Many people think this was an effort, Alex, to stave off the FBI who were looking into a REIT-based, you know, a real estate investor trust based in Corker's hometown of Chattanooga.
[01:39:48.231 --> 01:39:57.144]  Sure, it's well known the Democrats want weak Republicans that are compromised.
[01:39:57.164 --> 01:40:00.348]  They let them be corrupt, just like Mueller's corrupt, if they play along.
[01:40:00.408 --> 01:40:04.133]  And Corker is another literal turd about to be flushed down the toilet bowl.
[01:40:05.287 --> 01:40:17.391]  Well, he and Senator Mark Warner had been making a fortune in a hedge fund where they were essentially shorting the housing market using privileged information that they could obtain as a senator.
[01:40:18.731 --> 01:40:24.333]  It's extraordinary, and there are many, many other avenues here.
[01:40:24.353 --> 01:40:28.734]  Wells Fargo, kickbacks, and other matters.
[01:40:28.774 --> 01:40:30.095]  This guy, you're exactly right.
[01:40:30.115 --> 01:40:30.835]  He retreated.
[01:40:31.919 --> 01:40:34.081]  Under investigation, under heavy pressure.
[01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.944]  And then the CNN recycles him like he rebuffed Trump.
[01:40:38.024 --> 01:40:45.110]  He's a loser, not running again, destroyed by the Breitbart, Infowars, Trump revolution.
[01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:49.373]  And then they, again, their viewers are reading this like, oh look, Corker doesn't like Trump.
[01:40:49.673 --> 01:40:53.917]  What do you think of Blackwater founder Prince weighing Senate run right now?
[01:40:54.895 --> 01:41:05.790]  Well, I tell you, losing a crook like Robert Corker, a man who makes LBJ in the Senate look honest, for a man of the integrity and quality of Eric Prince, would be like day and night, I mean.
[01:41:06.548 --> 01:41:15.472]  He is a patriot, a guy who puts his money where his mouth is, a central player in the Trump upset.
[01:41:16.252 --> 01:41:28.318]  Falsely accused of colluding with Russia, completely false, bogus, just like all the other false... Can he win in Wyoming against that neocon he's gonna get ready to run against?
[01:41:28.338 --> 01:41:30.399]  I mean, that guy's like a Democrat out there.
[01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:38.818]  Uh, you know, it's a small state and it will be uphill, but Eric Prince is not a man who is afraid of a challenge.
[01:41:39.699 --> 01:41:49.710]  Right now you see in the Roy Moore victory over the swamp creature Luther Strange, that, you know, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:51.071]  The money doesn't matter.
[01:41:51.151 --> 01:41:53.574]  I mean, Strange spent $10 billion
[01:41:54.811 --> 01:41:58.355]  Mitch McConnell's money, $10 million to lose.
[01:41:58.635 --> 01:42:00.236]  Roy Moore spent less than $2 million.
[01:42:00.417 --> 01:42:02.298]  I thought it was like $30 million, the media said.
[01:42:03.299 --> 01:42:12.168]  Well, if you include all the super PACs and so on, the big boys, all the special interests, the NRA, everybody was weighing in.
[01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:19.455]  Now, the irony of that is that gun owners in Alabama knew that Luther Strange, as Attorney General, had been pretty much a gun grabber.
[01:42:19.915 --> 01:42:21.056]  Sure, so here's the facts.
[01:42:21.096 --> 01:42:22.157]  We all have the internet now.
[01:42:22.197 --> 01:42:23.338]  We're checking into candidates.
[01:42:23.698 --> 01:42:26.840]  That's the end of these guys claiming they're conservative or libertarian that aren't.
[01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:32.744]  So what are they going to do as every establishment candidate, Democrat and Republican, falls?
[01:42:33.505 --> 01:42:35.086]  They are in complete panic mode.
[01:42:35.166 --> 01:42:39.309]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're having a devastating victory worldwide.
[01:42:39.809 --> 01:42:43.012]  Now, it doesn't mean that there isn't big battles coming up, but I want you to know
[01:42:43.712 --> 01:42:45.514]  We are the heart of victory.
[01:42:45.915 --> 01:42:47.236]  We are the heart of 1776.
[01:42:49.178 --> 01:42:55.906]  And all of you, no matter what color your skin is, or where you came from, if you love liberty, you are 1776.
[01:42:57.128 --> 01:42:58.649]  You are the resistance.
[01:43:01.633 --> 01:43:03.175]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:09.765]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:43:10.025 --> 01:43:11.146]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:11.406 --> 01:43:13.708]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:14.368 --> 01:43:20.874]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:23.236]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:43:23.896 --> 01:43:26.539]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:43:27.179 --> 01:43:35.604]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:43:35.624 --> 01:43:36.604]  They know how great it is.
[01:43:37.505 --> 01:43:41.287]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:43:42.107 --> 01:43:43.608]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:43:44.409 --> 01:43:52.273]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:52.713 --> 01:43:55.275]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:43:55.815 --> 01:44:01.181]  Brain Force Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:04.144]  That comes to $50.03.
[01:44:04.284 --> 01:44:08.328]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:44:08.749 --> 01:44:11.892]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:44:14.054 --> 01:44:14.914]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:44:15.014 --> 01:44:26.258]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[01:45:20.308 --> 01:45:25.635]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:45:25.995 --> 01:45:34.846]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[01:45:35.407 --> 01:45:36.028]  Concentrate.
[01:45:36.068 --> 01:45:37.849]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:39.470]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:45:39.490 --> 01:45:41.392]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:45:41.792 --> 01:45:42.673]  It's incredible.
[01:45:43.153 --> 01:45:45.055]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:45:45.235 --> 01:45:47.197]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[01:45:47.277 --> 01:45:47.757]  Incredible.
[01:45:48.077 --> 01:45:48.958]  It is amazing.
[01:45:49.318 --> 01:45:50.599]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.161]  50% off Caveman.
[01:45:52.381 --> 01:45:53.702]  But only a few days left.
[01:45:53.942 --> 01:45:54.703]  It's about to end.
[01:45:55.283 --> 01:45:57.624]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:45:58.064 --> 01:46:03.226]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:46:03.646 --> 01:46:05.047]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:46:05.307 --> 01:46:06.447]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:07.648]  I want to thank you.
[01:46:07.968 --> 01:46:09.028]  We're all in this together.
[01:46:09.548 --> 01:46:19.452]  And when you get the great Bolan Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:46:20.172 --> 01:46:23.613]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:46:23.833 --> 01:46:25.673]  But these specials have got to end.
[01:46:26.173 --> 01:46:35.576]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:41.197]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:46:41.677 --> 01:46:46.318]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[01:46:46.978 --> 01:46:54.621]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible, high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:59.782]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:47:04.284 --> 01:47:06.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.091 --> 01:47:23.393]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.353 --> 01:47:28.254]  So, metaphysically, God is part of the Red Sea.
[01:47:29.034 --> 01:47:35.336]  The Red Sea being part of it isn't a way out of Babylon or out of Egypt.
[01:47:46.007 --> 01:47:50.872]  It's parting those that buy into mainstream media and those that buy into common sense.
[01:47:52.934 --> 01:48:05.027]  Jerry Brown signed a bill on Friday where you can give blood that has HIV, you name it, in it, and you get like a $50 parking ticket, and you can give somebody AIDS, HIV causes AIDS, and you don't get in trouble.
[01:48:06.772 --> 01:48:08.613]  You've got the Weinstein controversy.
[01:48:08.653 --> 01:48:10.694]  You've got the bowing at the NFL.
[01:48:10.714 --> 01:48:11.855]  You've got Pence leaving.
[01:48:11.875 --> 01:48:16.177]  You've got the NFL 31% down in viewers this year.
[01:48:16.697 --> 01:48:17.277]  I looked it up.
[01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:18.018]  I remember the number.
[01:48:18.398 --> 01:48:19.798]  They were down 20% last year.
[01:48:19.838 --> 01:48:20.019]  That's 51%.
[01:48:21.779 --> 01:48:27.802]  I mean, when you're losing 51% of your viewers in two years, that's beyond catastrophic.
[01:48:28.503 --> 01:48:29.143]  But they don't care.
[01:48:29.183 --> 01:48:30.604]  They're just suicidal.
[01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:36.815]  And then just, I mean, I got a clip I don't have time to play, but I'll play it tomorrow in the weekday show.
[01:48:36.835 --> 01:48:42.601]  I mean, it's of Stelter, who looks like the joke of a Humpty Dumpty drive-back manly.
[01:48:43.141 --> 01:48:45.484]  I mean, he's so, it makes me sad he's so pathetic.
[01:48:45.544 --> 01:48:46.324]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:48:46.845 --> 01:48:47.866]  He's got a power over me.
[01:48:47.886 --> 01:48:48.467]  He's so weak.
[01:48:50.889 --> 01:48:52.991]  Going, Trump's horrible, throwing people.
[01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:55.448]  Packages of paper towels.
[01:48:55.488 --> 01:48:57.070]  Trump's just having fun and saying he is.
[01:48:58.031 --> 01:49:02.015]  And they just sit there and all act like, oh, we're powerful, when they have no viewers and they're a joke.
[01:49:02.055 --> 01:49:04.217]  It's like they're only there to be disruptive.
[01:49:04.277 --> 01:49:05.399]  Why am I even covering them?
[01:49:05.919 --> 01:49:07.040]  That's why I haven't even covered yet.
[01:49:07.461 --> 01:49:12.526]  Five nights a week, they got a show called The Opposition, where they claim they're me and sell this crap.
[01:49:12.906 --> 01:49:14.788]  It's like they are done, folks.
[01:49:15.729 --> 01:49:17.430]  They're still disruptive, they're still dangerous.
[01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:21.672]  They still could go fund some guy that'll kill people, you know, in Las Vegas.
[01:49:21.712 --> 01:49:23.792]  But I don't think they have any more power.
[01:49:23.832 --> 01:49:27.114]  But what will their death rattle, their death throes be like?
[01:49:27.174 --> 01:49:27.754]  Roger Stone.
[01:49:33.056 --> 01:49:34.117]  His phone just dropped.
[01:49:34.177 --> 01:49:35.217]  You gotta love cell phones.
[01:49:36.238 --> 01:49:40.940]  He couldn't make a Skype work tonight, which is a congenital issue with Roger's Skype.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.721]  But we'll get his take on that as soon as he can.
[01:49:44.795 --> 01:49:53.222]  But seriously, I mean, the globalists want you to have HIV in the blood if you have a car wreck.
[01:49:53.302 --> 01:50:00.308]  They want to have sex with you and give you HIV because then you are now in the same club.
[01:50:00.328 --> 01:50:02.750]  It's like, we're miserable, we're gonna make you miserable.
[01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:03.331]  It's like, what?
[01:50:04.512 --> 01:50:06.494]  And they always just attach, well, it's for the children.
[01:50:07.799 --> 01:50:09.820]  Roger Stone, what do you make of all this?
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:26.347]  What do you make of the suicide of the Democratic Party, the suicide of the Republican Party, and just their desperate attempt, like their rearguard action is Humpty Dumpty Brian Stelter, who is the most saddening comedy you've ever seen trying to act powerful, male, and authoritative.
[01:50:26.367 --> 01:50:28.668]  I mean, is this CNN's idea of a joke?
[01:50:29.969 --> 01:50:43.380]  Well, look, it is politically correct, and you have what is getting to be near hysteria on the intellectual media left about their inability to destabilize and dislodge Donald Trump.
[01:50:44.321 --> 01:50:47.063]  The more he does, the better he does, the more they hate it.
[01:50:48.324 --> 01:50:56.751]  There's no compromise in the fact that they're egging Robert Mueller on to an upcoming Mueller deep state coup.
[01:50:58.088 --> 01:51:04.330]  You saw James Clapper out yesterday saying that if Manafort testifies, Trump will have to resign.
[01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:05.510]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:06.030]  I forgot.
[01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:07.151]  I should have you on about this.
[01:51:07.171 --> 01:51:07.911]  This is the biggest news.
[01:51:07.951 --> 01:51:08.251]  Sorry.
[01:51:08.731 --> 01:51:12.692]  Ken Starr, you've talked to Manafort last week, five days ago.
[01:51:13.092 --> 01:51:15.213]  Ken Starr says the indictments are coming.
[01:51:15.233 --> 01:51:16.113]  So that's big news.
[01:51:16.513 --> 01:51:17.713]  They're going to try indictments.
[01:51:17.913 --> 01:51:18.314]  Of who?
[01:51:18.334 --> 01:51:19.694]  What does this signify?
[01:51:22.653 --> 01:51:28.018]  There's no question that they've weaponized the Justice Department, our own Justice Department, ironically.
[01:51:28.519 --> 01:51:30.421]  And what I'm convinced is a coming coup.
[01:51:30.841 --> 01:51:34.505]  We've predicted it here at InfoWars now for months, and we will be proven out.
[01:51:35.466 --> 01:51:36.727]  This is not paranoia.
[01:51:36.847 --> 01:51:42.693]  And my fear, of course, is that the generals will walk our president, our king, to the gallows.
[01:51:43.756 --> 01:51:45.077]  Because they're a bunch of sellouts.
[01:51:45.337 --> 01:51:52.923]  You know, I agree, and we have to understand, folks, we've gotten here because America breeds cowards now, and people that go with MSM.
[01:51:53.243 --> 01:51:56.965]  If you believe in MSM, it's a tiny, small group of viewers.
[01:51:57.286 --> 01:52:02.970]  It's not reality, but there's these mental patients that want to be somebody, and they keep buying into it.
[01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:05.291]  Trump's somebody, because he's not part of it.
[01:52:05.371 --> 01:52:06.192]  You're somebody.
[01:52:06.592 --> 01:52:07.293]  I'm somebody.
[01:52:07.413 --> 01:52:08.333]  Roger's somebody.
[01:52:08.393 --> 01:52:11.656]  Matt Drudge is somebody, because we built our own thing, like America.
[01:52:12.196 --> 01:52:17.340]  And it's just like, good God, good God, do you not see the treacherous garbage we're dealing with?
[01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:26.887]  Well, and just the torrent of hate that is tossed our way when we simply try to express our own First Amendment views.
[01:52:26.907 --> 01:52:28.328]  It only encourages me, Roger.
[01:52:29.789 --> 01:52:31.070]  Well, I'm undaunted.
[01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:37.795]  Look, right now, Alex, I am rolling down South to have dinner with our fellow revolutionary, Milo.
[01:52:38.942 --> 01:52:42.586]  So we can begin plotting the next move against the globalists.
[01:52:42.686 --> 01:52:46.089]  So should we name you as a ship the Americana Dauntless?
[01:52:47.590 --> 01:53:00.083]  Well, I don't know that I deserve the name of a ship, although my favorite name of a ship is the USS Ronald Reagan, which right now seems to be moving into place very near North Korea, and for what I think is a
[01:53:02.193 --> 01:53:03.473]  Well that's my next issue.
[01:53:04.574 --> 01:53:05.334]  That's my next issue.
[01:53:05.394 --> 01:53:10.716]  What do you think Trump's comment about the calm before the storm is with the U.S.
[01:53:10.776 --> 01:53:13.216]  attack forces moving into place?
[01:53:13.256 --> 01:53:14.637]  That's exactly what I think it is.
[01:53:14.697 --> 01:53:17.598]  I think the rocket man has exhausted the big man's patience.
[01:53:18.418 --> 01:53:21.199]  I think the orange man is about to take the rocket man out.
[01:53:21.636 --> 01:53:34.904]  And that's why the Democrats are crapping their pants, because they want to supplicate before communism, they want to worship it, they wanted to give the nukes, give the missiles to it, and then shut it up, and then think America would capitulate in its face as a chess piece for China.
[01:53:34.924 --> 01:53:35.464]  It didn't happen.
[01:53:36.865 --> 01:53:45.690]  Well, and here I think is the very little secret, is that Trump has very skillfully clothed the Chinese off from their North Korean communist brothers.
[01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:47.451]  I think they're working with us, not with them.
[01:53:48.191 --> 01:53:51.052]  They're going to stand aside while we take out the little rocket man.
[01:53:51.112 --> 01:53:52.332]  That's Trump diplomacy.
[01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:57.134]  Something Barack Obama could never accomplish in eight years of trying to get their assistance.
[01:53:57.394 --> 01:54:00.015]  Wow, so you're saying the word is the calm before the storm.
[01:54:00.355 --> 01:54:03.176]  Trump is getting ready to hit North Korea after they threatened to nuke the U.S.
[01:54:03.356 --> 01:54:06.316]  Because look, I have all these leftist friends, and Ron Paul's a great guy.
[01:54:06.336 --> 01:54:07.697]  I know you helped his campaign.
[01:54:09.025 --> 01:54:19.594]  And I got Ron Paul, and I'm like, look, I don't want war, and I didn't agree with all these other wars, but North Korea's threatening to nuke us, and they are doing all this stuff, and, you know, we gave them the weapons, and it's very provocative to shoot missiles over Japan.
[01:54:20.054 --> 01:54:21.555]  He's like, oh, you're a neocon!
[01:54:21.595 --> 01:54:22.176]  You want war!
[01:54:22.216 --> 01:54:22.976]  They don't have nukes!
[01:54:23.397 --> 01:54:24.478]  Yes, they do have nukes!
[01:54:25.626 --> 01:54:38.810]  Well, look, I think Ron Paul is a patriot, and I generally agree with him that a strong national defense is greatly superior to this neocon wandering around the globe looking for expensive and deadly trouble with none of our business.
[01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:45.312]  He's not wrong, but he does also have to recognize the difference between being a libertarian and a pacifist.
[01:54:45.952 --> 01:54:49.013]  There are some very bad people out there who don't wish us well.
[01:54:49.593 --> 01:54:53.714]  ISIS is a leftover thread from neocon disasters.
[01:54:54.461 --> 01:54:54.961]  Exactly.
[01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:58.202]  I mean, Iran says they'll prayerfully attack us now.
[01:54:58.662 --> 01:55:03.184]  But my point is, just because our government has problems, doesn't mean every other government's an angel.
[01:55:03.564 --> 01:55:09.466]  It's like this narcissistic or borderline personality thing where either America's good or they're bad.
[01:55:09.606 --> 01:55:09.826]  No.
[01:55:10.266 --> 01:55:13.407]  How about North Korea's a blood-sucking, evil, communist country?
[01:55:13.847 --> 01:55:16.928]  I don't want war with them, but the guy is so belligerent.
[01:55:17.008 --> 01:55:18.249]  What is his problem, Roger?
[01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:21.850]  He's the one that keeps threatening to nuke us, not the other way around.
[01:55:22.449 --> 01:55:25.951]  I mean, he's a provocateur here.
[01:55:26.491 --> 01:55:28.653]  I understand why we don't belong in Afghanistan.
[01:55:28.793 --> 01:55:30.494]  I understand why we don't belong in Iraq.
[01:55:30.514 --> 01:55:32.675]  Because there were no real aggression.
[01:55:32.735 --> 01:55:36.017]  Exactly, but just because America has problems doesn't mean North Korea.
[01:55:36.057 --> 01:55:43.582]  So you're saying from your intel, I mean Trump's already said it calm before the storm, that we are getting ready to hit North Korea.
[01:55:46.349 --> 01:55:52.872]  That's my very best intelligence coming out of both my military and industrial sources, some of my White House sources.
[01:55:54.512 --> 01:56:00.335]  That's why I think the president was brusque in putting down Rex Tillerson in the tweet.
[01:56:01.055 --> 01:56:06.137]  Now everybody's talking about the coming Brexit that's coming, because I think he's gone by December.
[01:56:06.157 --> 01:56:08.458]  The president's lost confidence in him.
[01:56:08.478 --> 01:56:11.319]  It started with Charlottesville when he wouldn't back up the commander-in-chief.
[01:56:12.461 --> 01:56:16.102]  In an effort to kowtow and brown-nose the mainstream media.
[01:56:16.162 --> 01:56:28.467]  And that's why they're saying now, because Rex is addled and senile and thinks CNN still has viewers, but it's just weird these old people, not these old folks in general, but old folks that still think mainstream media is king when it's so uncool.
[01:56:29.107 --> 01:56:30.507]  He has really bad-mouthed the president.
[01:56:30.547 --> 01:56:31.087]  He's done a lot.
[01:56:31.107 --> 01:56:33.108]  So now they're telling Rex Tillerson, resign.
[01:56:33.408 --> 01:56:35.029]  Shouldn't Trump fire him before that?
[01:56:36.676 --> 01:56:48.287]  Well, you know, the problem is that when the president exercises that authority, the mainstream media then uses it to show a lack of stability in what is a very tumultuous court.
[01:56:48.708 --> 01:56:58.537]  I mean, to be honest with you, Alex, I kind of view the president at this point like the good king, locked in the tower by a group of bad knights who claim to be loyal, but in fact are undermining him.
[01:56:59.472 --> 01:57:03.715]  Our obligation is to free the good king so he pursues policies for the people.
[01:57:30.513 --> 01:57:32.155]  Alex, great to be with you as always.
[01:57:32.355 --> 01:57:32.675]  You bet.
[01:57:33.116 --> 01:57:34.817]  All right, back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:34.857 --> 01:57:35.238]  Central.
[01:57:35.298 --> 01:57:37.059]  Lord willing, David Knight, 8 a.m.
[01:57:37.079 --> 01:57:37.480]  tomorrow.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.584]  Don't forget Owen Schroeder, War Room, with the Rochester Stone, 3 o'clock p.m.
[01:57:41.624 --> 01:57:41.964]  every day.
[01:57:42.404 --> 01:57:43.846]  Wow, great job of the crew.
[01:57:43.926 --> 01:57:46.228]  What a great crew, working six days a week.
[01:57:46.728 --> 01:57:47.850]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:49.131]  Pray for America, pray for peace.
[01:57:49.431 --> 01:57:50.032]  Thank you, Jesus.
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:54.282]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[01:57:54.503 --> 01:57:55.203]  The bone broth.
[01:57:55.904 --> 01:57:56.645]  The bone broth.
[01:57:57.305 --> 01:57:58.827]  The bone broth.
[01:57:59.067 --> 01:57:59.768]  The bone broth.
[01:58:00.108 --> 01:58:01.229]  The bone broth.
[01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:02.230]  The bone broth.
[01:58:02.771 --> 01:58:04.393]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:58:04.493 --> 01:58:05.153]  It's caveman.
[01:58:05.874 --> 01:58:07.255]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[01:58:07.596 --> 01:58:08.076]  Caveman.
[01:58:08.677 --> 01:58:08.937]  Mmm.
[01:58:09.337 --> 01:58:09.578]  Mmm.
[01:58:10.038 --> 01:58:10.679]  Mmm, man.
[01:58:10.739 --> 01:58:10.999]  Mmm.
[01:58:11.359 --> 01:58:12.381]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:12.521 --> 01:58:13.462]  Better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:13.542 --> 01:58:13.662]  Mmm.
[01:58:13.922 --> 01:58:15.063]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:58:15.504 --> 01:58:16.284]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:17.005 --> 01:58:18.667]  Caveman is just over the top.
[01:58:19.147 --> 01:58:20.188]  What in the world?
[01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:23.812]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[01:58:24.232 --> 01:58:25.914]  It tastes like good.
[01:58:26.214 --> 01:58:27.055]  Man, this tastes so good.
[01:58:28.276 --> 01:58:29.458]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[01:58:30.579 --> 01:58:31.920]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.741]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
