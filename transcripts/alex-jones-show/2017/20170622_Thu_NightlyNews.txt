[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.682]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:21.503]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:22.564]  It's Thursday, June 22, 2017.
[00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:23.765]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:23.965]  Tonight...
[00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:33.891]  Illinois is on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:39.838]  Is this the beginning of the series of events caused by the financial collapse of Obamacare?
[00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:49.590]  Also, what is the current state of the Affordable Care Act as the Democrats are tripping all over themselves and their hypocrisies and the failure that is Obamacare?
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.082]  Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to demonize the GOP's proposal for the new Health Care Act.
[00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:01.684]  But doing so only displays how two-faced they really are.
[00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:06.866]  And then... Can the Secretary of State validate you to break state election law?
[00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:13.348]  Laura Presley joins David Knight to discuss the illegal activity permitted in Texas by the Director of Elections.
[00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:14.168]  Can I talk to him?
[00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.589]  Will anybody here talk to us?
[00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:17.335]  Or do you want to rig this?
[00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:21.597]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.499]  Why are you cutting off all these audit trails?
[00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:33.944]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.326]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:44.871]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.474]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:59.083]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:06.530]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.651]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:16.637]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:23.101]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:12.652]  Today we had the U.S.
[00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:14.433]  Senate give us its plan.
[00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.435]  They say we'll fix Obamacare.
[00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.797]  We'll take a look at the details of that and the likelihood that it'll pass.
[00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:21.839]  But first, let's take a look at Illinois.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:32.767]  It couldn't come at a more appropriate time to see the effects of the same types of progressive Democrat policies, you know, from Barack Obama who comes from Illinois.
[00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.890]  We have the Illinois comptroller putting it this way.
[00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.872]  The state can no longer function.
[00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:41.954]  This is truly a warning about Obamacare, folks.
[00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:42.975]  Zero Hedge puts it this way.
[00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:56.406]  They say with just 10 days to go until Illinois enters its third year without a budget, resulting in the state's imminent downgrade to junk status, potentially culminating in a default for the state whose unpaid bills now surpass $15 billion.
[00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:13.184]  The Democrat comptroller, Susana Mendoza, issued a warning to the Illinois governor and other elected officials on Tuesday, saying in a letter that her office has very serious concerns that it may no longer be able to guarantee timely, predictable payments.
[00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:15.884]  They say it's a massive crisis mode.
[00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:17.425]  She says this is not a false alarm.
[00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.385]  She said the state is effectively hemorrhaging money.
[00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:20.626]  She's very concerned.
[00:04:20.646 --> 00:04:21.326]  You get the idea?
[00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:23.546]  This is not something that is sustainable.
[00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:25.327]  This is like Venezuela.
[00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:30.688]  It's what we've seen in Detroit and other places where we have these types of socialist policies running through.
[00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:31.928]  They're running out of other people's money.
[00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:33.108]  They did it a long time ago.
[00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.710]  Now they're running out of rope that the bankers gave them to hang themselves.
[00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.251]  They've left the government spending roughly $600 million more a month than it is taking in.
[00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:50.613]  So they're $15 billion in debt, and they're going into debt about a half a billion dollars, a little bit more than that, each month.
[00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:58.096]  Services more likely to be affected include long-term care, hospice, and supportive living centers for seniors.
[00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:05.618]  She added that managed care organizations that serve Medicaid recipients are owed more than $2.8 billion in overdue bills as of June 15th.
[00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.299]  You get an idea where this is also coming in.
[00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.341]  It's the free health care that they want to give everybody, the subsidized health care, which is really not
[00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:15.023]  Anything other than an entitlement.
[00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:17.325]  We're not talking about insurance anymore.
[00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:24.672]  We're talking about a government entitlement program with mandates, with transfer payments, with outright theft and violation of the law.
[00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:25.733]  That's what Obamacare is.
[00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:27.575]  That's why it must be repealed.
[00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:28.536]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:31.358]  But again, going back to this, she says the state can no longer function.
[00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.631]  We have to put our fiscal house in order.
[00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:34.811]  It is already too late.
[00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:35.571]  Action is needed.
[00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:40.873]  So then we see the Chicago Tribune, kind of a tongue-in-cheek article saying, what do we do with a broken Illinois?
[00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:43.734]  Well, we have to dissolve the land of Lincoln.
[00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:45.555]  He said, Illinois is like Venezuela now.
[00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:46.155]  Exactly.
[00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:50.297]  This fiscally broken state that has lost its will to live.
[00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:53.678]  Although, for the moment, they still have enough toilet paper, he points out.
[00:05:54.679 --> 00:06:03.147]  But he said, before they run out of essentials, let's finally admit that after decade upon decade of taxing, spending, borrowing, Illinois has finally run out of other people's money.
[00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:04.008]  They need a plan.
[00:06:04.048 --> 00:06:04.468]  Here it is.
[00:06:04.528 --> 00:06:05.009]  Dissolve it.
[00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:06.410]  Decommission the state.
[00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.091]  Tear up the charter.
[00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:09.613]  Whatever the legal mumbo-jumbo, just end the whole dang thing.
[00:06:10.254 --> 00:06:13.798]  The people that he will scream the loudest, he said, are the politicians.
[00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:15.910]  Because they're the ones who want it going.
[00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.051]  They're the ones who created it.
[00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:19.654]  They're the ones who are talking about bankruptcy.
[00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:24.259]  And he says, but you know, let's just split it up and give it to our neighbors.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.422]  Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa.
[00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:28.484]  What parts of this would you like to have?
[00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:30.684]  No, the Democrats aren't going to do any of that.
[00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:33.525]  They're going to continue to go down the same path.
[00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:41.428]  The first thing they're going to do is to try to raise taxes, because they're not going to cut any of these programs that make the politicians powerful.
[00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:43.288]  However, there's a problem with that.
[00:06:43.948 --> 00:06:49.090]  Moody's Investor Services says taxpayers are on the hook for $251 billion in unfunded public union pension liabilities.
[00:06:52.751 --> 00:07:07.859]  See, the $15 billion that they can't handle, just out of regular operating expenses, and the half billion dollars a month that they're going into debt increase, and it doesn't even touch the $251 billion that they're on hook for with pension plans.
[00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.620]  There's no way out of this for them.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.841]  Yet, that's exactly what they want to do.
[00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:15.503]  They don't want to bring about structural reform that'll make it stable.
[00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:21.167]  And that's the situation that we see from the Senate Republicans.
[00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:23.709]  The Senate Republicans, the leadership.
[00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:30.394]  You have to understand that the establishment, the Republican establishments, are no different from the Democrats.
[00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:34.317]  They're using the same tactics, creating their secret bills and so forth.
[00:07:35.078 --> 00:07:40.042]  And then with the same goal in mind, keeping these massive government programs going.
[00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:43.845]  They're simply rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic
[00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.786]  Even though they're already scraping the iceberg.
[00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:52.908]  But meanwhile, Obama from Illinois says that there's a fundamental meanness about the Senate health care bill.
[00:07:52.988 --> 00:07:55.269]  He said, the Senate bill unveiled today is not a health care bill.
[00:07:55.589 --> 00:08:00.150]  It's a massive transfer of wealth from middle class and poor families to the richest people in America.
[00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:01.711]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:03.351]  That's what his bill was.
[00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:09.353]  His bill transferred wealth from middle class and poor families to the richest people in America.
[00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:11.074]  The people who own the insurance companies.
[00:08:12.168 --> 00:08:14.149]  Okay, that's what is truly behind this.
[00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.571]  It was a massive transfer of wealth to the insurance companies.
[00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.233]  But he pretends that this is something that's going to hurt people.
[00:08:19.613 --> 00:08:22.495]  If they get sick, old, start a family, this bill will harm you, he said.
[00:08:22.896 --> 00:08:27.559]  And he said these small tweaks under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach.
[00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.661]  He understands that what he created is not easy to stomach.
[00:08:31.262 --> 00:08:35.264]  He says they can't change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.
[00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:41.048]  No, they can't change the fundamental madness at the core of Obamacare.
[00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:51.756]  The problem is, and we talked about this with Jerome Corsi, he and I did a report about how they funded these subsidized health care policies.
[00:08:52.316 --> 00:08:57.080]  They're saying we provided 20 plus million people with health care.
[00:08:57.844 --> 00:08:58.365]  No, you didn't.
[00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:01.108]  You didn't even really provide them with health insurance.
[00:09:01.548 --> 00:09:07.655]  You stole money from people who had been responsible, who had invested money for their retirement or in other ways.
[00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:12.982]  You took it from private investors because the Congress never funded Obamacare.
[00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:30.357]  And of course, the whole Ponzi scheme, the whole Robin Hood scheme, could be stopped simply by the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Sessions, stopping the appeal of the court that said, no, you have to follow the Constitution.
[00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:32.518]  It's the Congress that appropriates the money.
[00:09:32.658 --> 00:09:38.822]  They didn't appropriate the money, so that doesn't give you, President Obama, the license to steal it from somewhere else, which is what they did.
[00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:40.445]  It can be stopped that easily.
[00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:43.795]  Or it can be stopped like Representative Mo Brooks suggested.
[00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:44.858]  A single sentence.
[00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:47.583]  Obamacare is hereby repealed.
[00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:49.465]  No, we're not going to do that either.
[00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:57.770]  Instead, we're going to continue down this bankrupt moral principle here that we're going to rob investors to give, to pretend to give health insurance to other people.
[00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:04.015]  You can't give anything, the government can't give anything to someone without first taking it from someone else.
[00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.917]  Also, they legally have no authority to do this.
[00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:08.598]  We know that it's not really a tax.
[00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:12.601]  It's not a tax when you force people to buy something from a private company.
[00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:15.143]  That's where the massive transfer of wealth went.
[00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:24.506]  They held the gun of government to people's head and said, buy this service from my preferred vendors at the rates that they have told me that they want to have.
[00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:25.826]  Let them set the rates.
[00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.627]  It's also, though, financially bankrupt.
[00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:30.187]  And that's the big deal.
[00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:31.288]  This is what's going to bite us.
[00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:34.709]  But we see the GOP using the same tactics as the Democrats.
[00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:39.270]  Creating this bill in secret, then giving everybody just a few days to look at it.
[00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.471]  Now this is not as complex as the original passing of Obamacare.
[00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:43.352]  This is a 142 page bill.
[00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:50.398]  But still, they only have a handful of days to decide whether they're going to support it or vote against it.
[00:10:50.498 --> 00:10:55.299]  It doesn't give the public much time to take a look at what's going on here and give feedback to the representatives.
[00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.640]  They're twisting people's arms by doing this.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.382]  These are the same tactics created by the Democrats being adopted by the Republicans to continue Obamacare.
[00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:06.563]  Ted Cruz says it's currently drafted.
[00:11:06.603 --> 00:11:10.246]  This bill draft does not do nearly enough to lower premiums.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:13.969]  He said the central issue for Republicans should be that.
[00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:17.652]  Should be repealing Obamacare and making health care affordable.
[00:11:17.812 --> 00:11:20.534]  See that's what Obamacare was called was the Affordable Health Care Act.
[00:11:20.855 --> 00:11:21.975]  It was never affordable.
[00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.216]  Never affordable.
[00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:26.159]  It was simply about making people dependent on government.
[00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:32.664]  So let's take a look at some of the comparisons here between the Senate bill, between Obamacare and the House proposal.
[00:11:32.684 --> 00:11:33.184]  For example,
[00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:39.350]  Obamacare greatly expanded Medicaid and mostly paid for it, says CNN.
[00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.431]  Well, no, it didn't really.
[00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:44.113]  Didn't really, as we talked about, they stole the money from Fannie Gate subsidies and other things.
[00:11:44.773 --> 00:11:51.437]  The Senate bill would continue the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare for three years and then begin to roll it back in 2021.
[00:11:52.398 --> 00:11:54.579]  Again, continue to expand it.
[00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:57.001]  So they're not even going to slow it down for three years.
[00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.663]  Obama guarantees coverage, even for people with pre-existing conditions.
[00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:02.551]  That's not insurance.
[00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:07.913]  That's an entitlement program funded again by theft and quite frankly it isn't funded.
[00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:12.894]  They're going to run out of that money and they're not going to be able to continue down this road.
[00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:17.275]  We all know that we can't continue to see our insurance premiums under these mandates continue to double.
[00:12:17.555 --> 00:12:20.836]  The House bill would allow some states to opt out of requiring those protections.
[00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:22.196]  The Senate bill does not.
[00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:26.497]  But they'll allow in some states skimpier coverage.
[00:12:26.517 --> 00:12:27.858]  You can get waivers and so forth.
[00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:29.098]  You understand the problem with this?
[00:12:29.977 --> 00:12:38.542]  We have Health and Human Services Secretary becoming a health czar, a Mandarin, a bureaucrat, standing in Washington D.C.
[00:12:38.882 --> 00:12:45.787]  deciding what coverage people are going to be required to take, whether the states will be allowed to opt out, how much they'll be allowed to opt out, even the
[00:12:47.222 --> 00:12:52.287]  The carrot that they're throwing to their supporters saying we're going to defund Planned Parenthood for a year.
[00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:54.049]  That's just a temporary thing.
[00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:03.319]  You leave the structure in and then the next time you have Democrats take power or you have some moderate or establishment Republicans take power, it all comes back in.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.941]  This is not a change.
[00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:05.922]  This is not repeal.
[00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:08.344]  This is leaving the structure of Obamacare in.
[00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:19.212]  And if you leave it in, it will continue to grow and metastasize like a cancer through the society, taking us down just as Illinois is being taken down by this, just as we see with Venezuela.
[00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:25.097]  Obamacare required every health plan to cover certain essential benefits, and they would tell you what was essential.
[00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:27.738]  Things like maternity care for single men.
[00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:28.719]  Things like that.
[00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:30.340]  Well, they're going to play around a little bit with that.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.922]  Look, there's nothing here.
[00:13:32.682 --> 00:13:34.943]  This is a big nothing burger.
[00:13:35.003 --> 00:13:39.006]  This is as much a distraction as the Russians hacked the election.
[00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:43.909]  They're trying to claim that they've got a win here when they are not doing anything to fix the problem.
[00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:53.615]  It is not a win to pretend that you're fixing the problem and continue to allow this massive thing to take us and to take our freedoms, our legal structure, and our economy.
[00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:58.898]  Rand Paul says the Senate health care bill may be Obamacare Plus, as a matter of fact.
[00:13:59.299 --> 00:14:02.481]  He says it may have even more subsidies than Obamacare.
[00:14:03.282 --> 00:14:06.084]  And it subsidizes this death spiral that we're in.
[00:14:06.124 --> 00:14:11.168]  It does nothing, nothing to solve the cost that we've looked at.
[00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:13.589]  On Thursday's broadcast with Neil Cavuto, he said this.
[00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:15.651]  He said, when we look at the bill, we actually find that
[00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:21.612]  With the Obamacare subsidies, not only are we keeping them, we may be actually providing more subsidies than Obamacare has.
[00:14:21.972 --> 00:14:26.173]  Our early estimates on the bill are that the bill may spend more in the next year or two than Obamacare does.
[00:14:26.493 --> 00:14:37.295]  And so it's hard for us to get our mind around that it's a repeal bill if we're spending more, if we're keeping all the subsidies, and then we're going to start a brand new federal entitlement program where we give insurance companies money?
[00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:38.375]  See, that's just it.
[00:14:38.455 --> 00:14:42.196]  It's an entitlement program, but it's an entitlement program for the insurance companies.
[00:14:43.123 --> 00:14:44.647]  It's not helping us with health care.
[00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:48.295]  We have to understand that first of all this isn't going to pass.
[00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:49.979]  They have to have...
[00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:57.268]  They've got four Republican senators, which is way more than is needed to stop this bill.
[00:14:57.388 --> 00:15:01.149]  Rand Paul and three others are opposing this, and I say good for them.
[00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:05.270]  This is nothing at all like what Donald Trump campaigned on.
[00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.492]  Donald Trump had a program that was essentially going to institute market reforms.
[00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:13.493]  That's the only thing that is going to help us in terms of health care.
[00:15:14.193 --> 00:15:14.654]  Costs.
[00:15:14.754 --> 00:15:16.356]  We have to put these market reforms in.
[00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:18.238]  We have to have competition across state lines.
[00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:21.282]  If we go back and look at his health care reform, here's what he had.
[00:15:22.303 --> 00:15:23.384]  Competition across state lines.
[00:15:23.404 --> 00:15:24.906]  Remember Rubio saying lines, lines.
[00:15:24.926 --> 00:15:25.867]  What's this about lines?
[00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:29.850]  No, there were lines that were stopping competition.
[00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.470]  That's what the Commerce Clause is really about.
[00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:37.972]  They, of course, inverted that to do all sorts of unconstitutional things, but that was really what it was about, to allow competition across state lines.
[00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:41.993]  It also allowed ownership, which gave people incentive to save money.
[00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:50.035]  When you've got a third-party system that the federal government created with the IRS's assistance, where only businesses get to deduct their insurance costs,
[00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:53.298]  You have crippled the incentive to save money.
[00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:59.003]  It is completely gone if we go to a single-party payer system, which is where they want it to go.
[00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.024]  They want it to fail.
[00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:04.829]  They want it to go bankrupt so that the government takes it all over and just makes it a big entitlement program.
[00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:07.551]  This aids that by keeping the fraud going.
[00:16:08.052 --> 00:16:14.738]  In terms of taxes, some of the taxes are going to be cut partially here in this program, but we have to understand the difference in what Donald Trump campaigned on.
[00:16:15.359 --> 00:16:20.560]  Donald Trump said that we're going to replace penalties and taxes with tax credits and health savings accounts.
[00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:22.161]  We're going to give people ownership.
[00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.902]  We're going to reward people who do the right thing.
[00:16:26.262 --> 00:16:31.764]  And of course there's always going to be people who don't have the money, who don't have access to the system.
[00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:38.846]  And that has always been handled in the past and should be with private charity, with the charity of the hospitals and the doctors.
[00:16:38.886 --> 00:16:39.526]  And they did that.
[00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:46.806]  And that is the, it's not a perfect system, but it is a far better system than this bankrupt system that we have here.
[00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:54.853]  Why can't we, if that's the goal, and health care is very important, why can't we even deduct our medical expenses or our health care insurance from our income tax?
[00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:58.856]  And of course the taxes on medical devices that simply make it more expensive.
[00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:07.943]  He was going to remove barriers and regulations that make drugs more expensive, even if they're manufactured in the US, sent to another country, and we can buy them in another country cheaper.
[00:17:07.983 --> 00:17:08.964]  What is wrong with that?
[00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:11.818]  There's massive structural problems here.
[00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:15.499]  But then also choice and transparency to operate in that marketplace.
[00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.940]  To know that you can shop price, you can shop quality between doctors and hospitals.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.801]  That's really what is necessary.
[00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:23.841]  And we don't see any of that here.
[00:17:23.881 --> 00:17:25.482]  Now let's talk about some good news today.
[00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:33.543]  On the welfare front, we see that Trump wants to ban immigrants from accessing welfare within five years of entering the U.S.
[00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.604]  Of course, why wouldn't we?
[00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:46.597]  There's no other, there's no countries in the third world that allow you to move to their country and become a citizen if you don't have the means to support yourself and to support your dependents.
[00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.958]  But of course they also control their borders.
[00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.719]  We're not allowed to do that in Western countries either.
[00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:56.964]  But people can come here illegally without our authorization and immediately start to get financial benefits.
[00:17:57.204 --> 00:18:00.526]  And he's saying, well let's at least wait five years and wait for the hue and cry.
[00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.867]  It's going to be absolutely amazing.
[00:18:02.127 --> 00:18:06.250]  But when we look at the kind of waste that the government gives us all the time,
[00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.051]  Let's take a look at the Pentagon.
[00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:16.934]  The Pentagon, one of our favorite wasting programs, has wasted $28 million on uniforms for Afghan soldiers.
[00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:18.595]  What did they do?
[00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:25.858]  They bought them forest camouflaged uniforms in a country where only 2.1% of the total land area even has forests.
[00:18:28.922 --> 00:18:34.185]  Maybe when they said we need uniforms for the Afghan forces, they thought they said Afghan forests.
[00:18:35.126 --> 00:18:36.226]  No, that's not the case.
[00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:38.328]  And as a matter of fact, why did they do it?
[00:18:38.788 --> 00:18:42.050]  It's because their defense minister liked the look of the uniforms.
[00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.972]  And the person exposing this said, the inspector general said, what if he liked pink or purple?
[00:18:46.012 --> 00:18:46.773]  Would we do that too?
[00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.915]  Would we make special custom uniforms because he liked that?
[00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:55.897]  That is the insanity of the government programs and that is why we don't want them running our healthcare.
[00:18:55.937 --> 00:19:00.939]  Stay with us, we have a very important report on electronic voting coming right up.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.411]  Welcome back.
[00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:16.795]  You know, we've had Donald Trump and we've had all the back and forth about emails.
[00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:21.561]  He said, if you've got something important, you can't trust it to electronic delivery.
[00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:24.124]  Write it down on a piece of paper and deliver it.
[00:23:24.685 --> 00:23:28.810]  Well, one of the most important communications you can have when it comes to government is your vote.
[00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:32.352]  We need to have an audit trail at the very least.
[00:23:32.712 --> 00:23:36.414]  We hear all of this information about the election being hacked by Russians.
[00:23:36.474 --> 00:23:42.257]  And yet, when real hacking of our election system is involved, no one is interested.
[00:23:42.817 --> 00:23:44.198]  Except InfoWars.
[00:23:44.278 --> 00:23:48.920]  And we've been covering issues here in the state of Texas that also apply nationwide.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:02.590]  Here in Texas we have situations where our requirements under law to number ballots and many other requirements to make sure that we have an audit trail, to make sure that the ballots cannot be stuffed, have been ignored.
[00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.692]  And we have joining us today Dr. Laura Presley.
[00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:18.803]  In a race that you were in, Laura, you found evidence of tampering, essentially, and you had concerns about the number of votes, and of course that goes to the requirement of numbering the ballot.
[00:24:19.503 --> 00:24:33.774]  And you wanted to do an audit of this and you found that the four different areas that are required under Texas law to be able to do audits of electronic ballots were being ignored and they were being shut down by the Texas Director of Elections.
[00:24:33.814 --> 00:24:38.178]  He had directly countermanded the law and there was a very interesting back and forth
[00:24:38.918 --> 00:24:49.025]  When you appeal this to the local authorities, and of course it had to be appealed in the same jurisdiction where they were shutting down the law, and they found that they had not done anything wrong, surprisingly.
[00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:53.249]  But there was an interesting back-and-forth question that reminded me of the Nuremberg trials.
[00:24:53.309 --> 00:25:00.053]  They said, well, can a director of elections tell you to shut down, to ignore the law?
[00:25:00.073 --> 00:25:01.935]  And they said, oh, absolutely, totally.
[00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:02.971]  Right.
[00:25:03.071 --> 00:25:20.169]  So, you know, I think it's brand new information when a bureaucrat in state government can tell counties to ignore the absolutely most important thing we have in a government, and that's laws regarding election integrity and laws that are protecting our backup records for electronic voting.
[00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:27.711]  So, you know, yeah, I ran for city council and, you know, something was just going wrong, David, with our race and all the results that we got.
[00:25:27.731 --> 00:25:32.673]  You know, we saw statistical mathematical patterns, but that stuff gets you so far.
[00:25:32.693 --> 00:25:38.995]  A lot of people around the country see statistical patterns, theories about how elections can be stolen with an electronic voting machine.
[00:25:39.355 --> 00:25:41.796]  But what we got in our case was phenomenal.
[00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:44.457]  We got actually hard evidence of corruption.
[00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:48.338]  How main computers can be corrupted with this electronic voting.
[00:25:48.699 --> 00:25:50.379]  And it doesn't take the Russians.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.980]  It doesn't require an internet connection.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:59.563]  All it requires is a memory card that can be... And we've seen this demonstrated on television for a decade or more.
[00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:06.686]  People walk in and they stick in a thumb drive into the system, it puts some software on there, it alters all the votes.
[00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:08.768]  We've seen this over and over again on news reports.
[00:26:09.228 --> 00:26:15.311]  And then after all the voting is done, and they've tabulated everything, then it essentially erases itself so you can't detect that.
[00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:20.634]  And if you don't have an audit process, that's one of the reasons why in the Texas law,
[00:26:21.334 --> 00:26:21.675]  We're good to go.
[00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:38.156]  To do something else.
[00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:41.157]  And then everybody down the line basically says, yeah, that's fine.
[00:26:41.177 --> 00:26:42.157]  I don't have to obey the law.
[00:26:42.457 --> 00:26:43.237]  I'm obeying him.
[00:26:43.618 --> 00:26:45.398]  That's a very dangerous situation.
[00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:48.179]  And that's been allowed to happen here in Texas.
[00:26:48.219 --> 00:26:50.699]  And of course, you remember, we went back, when was it?
[00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:52.500]  It was about a year and a half ago.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.320]  It was in October.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.660]  Yeah, it was October.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.140]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.861]  Before the November.
[00:26:55.901 --> 00:26:56.601]  So much has happened.
[00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:57.561]  It seems like a longer time.
[00:26:58.001 --> 00:27:03.784]  But we went to Keith Ingram here, who's the Director of Elections in Texas, to ask him some of these questions.
[00:27:03.844 --> 00:27:15.830]  Why have you, for several years, been directing all the different counties to ignore these laws and these requirements to allow us to have an image of the ballot, to have the ballots numbered and so forth?
[00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.712]  And he came down, I guess he thought we were going to do a puff piece, how many people are going to show up for the election?
[00:27:20.732 --> 00:27:22.853]  Are people interested and buzzed about this election or whatever?
[00:27:23.153 --> 00:27:24.214]  And you can see there in the video,
[00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:31.897]  He starts to come down and he sees me there with the InfoWars microphone and he stops and he goes, oh no, oh no.
[00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.638]  And he turns around and starts walking up.
[00:27:33.678 --> 00:27:34.518]  I love the hand move.
[00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:36.039]  I love it.
[00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:39.720]  He starts walking up so we went over and shouted some questions at him but he didn't answer.
[00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:47.224]  So we're looking for answers and when you go to this court, the amazing thing too about this to me, Dr. Presley, is the fact that they would
[00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:50.826]  No, we think that we're doing nothing wrong.
[00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:58.972]  And if you appeal this, we're going to hit you with a $40,000 personal fine and your lawyer with a $50,000 fine if you appeal this.
[00:27:59.612 --> 00:28:00.433]  And you did it anyway.
[00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:00.893]  Good for you.
[00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:01.293]  That's right.
[00:28:01.373 --> 00:28:06.557]  And then you lost again in a local, here again in Austin, and they hit you with another $25,000 fine.
[00:28:06.797 --> 00:28:09.619]  So then your response is, well, I'm going to go to the Supreme Court.
[00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:11.180]  You're not taking a no for an answer here.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:17.883]  I'm not taking no for an answer because I believe our elections are the absolute most important thing we have in our government and in this country.
[00:28:17.903 --> 00:28:24.287]  If we don't have honest and fair elections, we can lose the First Amendment, we can lose the Second Amendment, we can lose all of them.
[00:28:24.647 --> 00:28:27.208]  So this is where the buck stops with the people.
[00:28:27.908 --> 00:28:38.454]  And, you know, it's interesting, David, the only way that electronic voting fraud can occur and be perpetuated is when you don't have a backup record.
[00:28:39.214 --> 00:28:40.935]  And just exactly what you said in Texas.
[00:28:41.235 --> 00:28:54.422]  The Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Elections Director, Mr. Ingram, has been giving waivers to law and also certifying electronic voting equipment that doesn't even meet state law or the federal standards.
[00:28:54.843 --> 00:29:00.426]  And so again, the only way fraud can occur is if you're ignoring all these backup records that are required.
[00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:04.288]  You know, if you have all the backup records, you can't steal an election as easily.
[00:29:04.488 --> 00:29:10.413]  Let's talk about the centerpiece of this, because you're an election integrity technologist, a strategist, you've gone through the details of this.
[00:29:10.893 --> 00:29:15.637]  Let's take a look at the specifics here now, in this particular, in the Texas Constitution.
[00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:19.641]  It provides for the numbering of tickets and ballots.
[00:29:19.661 --> 00:29:21.542]  This is something that's been here for 120 years.
[00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:24.865]  Even when we just had a paper system, they were numbered.
[00:29:24.905 --> 00:29:29.309]  And as you pointed out before the interview began, we were talking here individually, you said
[00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:32.671]  All the dollar bills that we have are serially numbered.
[00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:33.391]  Why is that?
[00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:37.514]  Because you want to have some control over counterfeiting.
[00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:40.636]  And they knew that for the paper ballots.
[00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:45.679]  And then they continued that, especially with additional requirements, when they went to electronics.
[00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:46.626]  That's right.
[00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:52.169]  You know, the Texas Constitution, all the way back to the 1800s, has required that a ballot be numbered.
[00:29:52.769 --> 00:29:58.252]  And that is the first and most primary, basic fraud prevention methodology.
[00:29:58.272 --> 00:30:02.154]  You know, fraud's been going on a long time in Texas, right?
[00:30:02.174 --> 00:30:04.335]  So even in the 1800s, we knew to number a ballot.
[00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:07.197]  So that's the first thing that's been required.
[00:30:07.837 --> 00:30:10.838]  So, you know, so the Constitution requires it.
[00:30:10.938 --> 00:30:15.401]  And we have these electronic voting systems in Texas that don't meet
[00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:17.482]  The numbering requirement.
[00:30:17.522 --> 00:30:19.043]  And they're not just Texas systems.
[00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.484]  These are national vendors.
[00:30:20.544 --> 00:30:23.766]  So it's going to be the same vendors nationally, same vendors internationally.
[00:30:23.806 --> 00:30:31.811]  I mean, quite frankly, one of the companies that operates here in the United States, Smartmatic, began in Venezuela with cronies of Hugo Chavez.
[00:30:32.152 --> 00:30:36.635]  And these guys created the electronic ballot system so they could make sure that Hugo Chavez took control.
[00:30:36.895 --> 00:30:41.098]  And there has been massive fraud throughout Central and South America and the Philippines.
[00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:44.560]  Due to this particular company's systems.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.421]  And there's other companies that are associated with it.
[00:30:46.561 --> 00:30:51.585]  And now we've got Hart Systems, which operates here in Texas and many places in the United States.
[00:30:51.985 --> 00:30:56.808]  They don't even have the capability, never have had the capability, of doing numbering.
[00:30:57.028 --> 00:30:58.969]  And they're not hiding that.
[00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:02.452]  They just have the politicians who like them for some reason or the other.
[00:31:02.752 --> 00:31:08.816]  They like these electronic systems and so they buy their stuff even though it doesn't meet the legal requirements.
[00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:09.496]  That's right.
[00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:14.759]  That's really what our case is about.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:23.845]  Our case that's in the Texas Supreme Court right now references that ballots have to be numbered per the state constitution and actually there's case law all the way back
[00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:25.466]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:47.750]  Let's say you vote and you've identified that your ballot on the electronic voting machine is ballot number 452.
[00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.591]  And let's say there's a candidate that does a recount.
[00:31:52.212 --> 00:31:55.893]  And you go back in and go, OK, my ballot's number 452.
[00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.094]  Gosh, that's not who I voted for.
[00:31:58.114 --> 00:31:59.615]  Then there is proof, David.
[00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:00.355]  That's right.
[00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:00.856]  Fraud.
[00:32:00.876 --> 00:32:06.840]  And so that's why the numbering really is the holy grail of election integrity.
[00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:17.548]  And so this requirement's been there back to the 1800s in Texas, and even the federal standards require that the electronic ballots have a unique identifier.
[00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:18.969]  Well, that's not the case.
[00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:21.774]  So now this is moving forward.
[00:32:22.054 --> 00:32:27.518]  You've had these setbacks at the local area, where the same jurisdiction where this happened, you were concerned about it.
[00:32:27.598 --> 00:32:35.004]  They shut it down, threatened you, put fines against you, but now this is being picked up and that's why we're talking about this, going to the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:32:35.024 --> 00:32:38.647]  So we're out of time for today, but we're going to be following this very closely.
[00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:40.508]  You should follow this as well.
[00:32:40.628 --> 00:32:43.030]  It is a very important story nationally.
[00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.833]  We just talked yesterday with Gary Haven talking about how there was a nine point spread for Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:53.918]  Paper versus electronic ballots in California, and that was done by Stanford University doing that kind of research.
[00:32:54.338 --> 00:32:57.920]  It is the key to dishonest or honest government.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.841]  Thank you for joining us, Dr. Laura Pressley.
[00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:00.502]  Thank you, David.

[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.847]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:54.748]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:10.494]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with extra fluoride so that your days are happy and dim.
[00:37:11.354 --> 00:37:13.695]  And of course the formula that I developed myself.
[00:37:14.015 --> 00:37:22.238]  That's the Super Cuck Beta Male that everyone should be taking so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears the pants around here.
[00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:35.938]  Now I understand what Alex Jones is going through personally, because for years, I'm not telling anything you guys don't know, I've also been playing a right-wing radio host, my beloved character, Tuck Buckford.
[00:37:42.472 --> 00:37:43.573]  Thank you, yes, yes.
[00:37:44.054 --> 00:37:48.139]  Welcome to Brain Fight, ladies and gentlemen, with the real Tuck Budford.
[00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:58.711]  And I tell you, I want to thank tonight CBS News for allowing me to set the record straight about a public enemy number one and a scourge of America and the world.
[00:37:59.392 --> 00:38:03.976]  I'm not talking about Stephen Colbert, I'm talking about Alex Jones of Infowars.
[00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:11.442]  That enemy of America stole my identity back in high school and my manly power, my manly voice.
[00:38:11.802 --> 00:38:15.606]  He took it from me and then spread his evil lies across the country and the world.
[00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:25.013]  And he stole not just my persona, he then projected his right-wing, evil, unalloyed, racist views over me.
[00:38:25.934 --> 00:38:32.959]  And then that got picked up by Stephen Colbert who unknowingly stole the identity of someone that had stolen my identity.
[00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:43.766]  So here tonight, thanks to CBS, here at Brain Fight with the real Tuck Buckford, I am going to set the record straight about the fact that Alex Jones is a damn liar.
[00:38:43.786 --> 00:38:45.367]  I'm a pioneer!
[00:38:45.767 --> 00:38:46.648]  I'm an explorer!
[00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.790]  I'm a human!
[00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.612]  Now let's get right down to facts here.
[00:38:51.752 --> 00:38:53.153]  Tuck Bunker's gonna lay them out.
[00:38:53.754 --> 00:39:01.480]  Alex Jones would take a real piece of news like this out of Associated Press, but it sounds all crazy and he'd make a big deal out of it.
[00:39:01.821 --> 00:39:03.922]  But I actually think this is a great idea.
[00:39:04.163 --> 00:39:07.886]  In fact, it should be the new Chonani yogurt flavor.
[00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:14.068]  Look at this, dried lizard penises from India sold as good luck charms.
[00:39:14.148 --> 00:39:19.309]  Now, Alex Jones would sit there and say there's a problem with that and try to scare people.
[00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:30.513]  Now, let's look at another dried lizard penis reanimated with all sorts of, you know, baby blood they're pumping through his arteries and I'm totally for it, I think it's great.
[00:39:31.093 --> 00:39:36.115]  Wow, that's Bill Clinton ditched Secret Service on multiple Lolita Express flights.
[00:39:36.615 --> 00:39:37.956]  Wow, that's mainstream news.
[00:39:38.016 --> 00:39:38.636]  Hell yeah!
[00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.196]  Here's an article right here.
[00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.017]  Latest WikiLeaks, those traitors.
[00:39:42.517 --> 00:39:52.021]  Cherry Blossom exposes CIA wireless hacking, where they loaded on all your different wireless devices, CIA software, to track and listen to everything you did.
[00:39:52.341 --> 00:39:56.048]  Another thing Alex Jones was right about that traitor, piece of filth!
[00:39:56.268 --> 00:40:00.615]  How dare him release that they're kidnapping kids and spying on you illegal!
[00:40:00.796 --> 00:40:02.258]  That traitor is piece of crap!
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.602]  Here's another big problem I've got right now on Brain Fight.
[00:40:07.062 --> 00:40:08.984]  Remember that congressman Steve Scalise?
[00:40:09.284 --> 00:40:13.787]  He's also been speaking out against child trafficking among four shot at baseball field.
[00:40:14.127 --> 00:40:15.808]  Ha ha, well Tuck Bugford likes it.
[00:40:16.068 --> 00:40:16.949]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:18.469]  I'm like the guy that did it.
[00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:24.193]  When Wolf Blitzer went on the news and interviewed his friend and they said, he's not evil, he's just political.
[00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:27.555]  That's right, it's political if we kill you.
[00:40:27.775 --> 00:40:28.676]  Let's play a clip.
[00:40:29.645 --> 00:40:41.288]  We're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66-year-old shooter, describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations.
[00:40:41.328 --> 00:40:41.828]  Listen to this.
[00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:46.110]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.851]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that's going on.
[00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:53.343]  That's what we just heard.
[00:40:53.604 --> 00:40:57.125]  Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going on.
[00:40:57.145 --> 00:40:58.826]  Tom Fuentes, the FBI.
[00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:00.327]  Woo!
[00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:03.848]  Tuck's just getting started and wound up.
[00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.729]  I love another Democrat I like.
[00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.350]  Just like that.
[00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.391]  Just like that sweetie pie Stephen Colbert.
[00:41:10.412 --> 00:41:13.313]  That fancy sounding French name.
[00:41:13.953 --> 00:41:14.293]  Woo!
[00:41:14.553 --> 00:41:14.974]  I like that.
[00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:15.154]  Woo!
[00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:20.381]  In the hours after five people were shot, including the House Majority Whip, you sent out a tweet that said,
[00:41:31.261 --> 00:41:32.421]  Hunt Republicans.
[00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:37.883]  I mean, it was clearly a reference to the assassination attempt against Congressman Scalise.
[00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:41.324]  It's hard to imagine how you could justify writing something like that.
[00:41:41.524 --> 00:41:48.185]  For too long, Republicans in this country have failed to distinguish the differences between politics and war.
[00:41:48.685 --> 00:41:51.286]  And a lot of Democrats have failed to see the similarities.
[00:41:51.686 --> 00:41:54.887]  So you guys either have to tone down the rhetoric or we have to step up.
[00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:56.777]  Oh, I love it.
[00:41:56.837 --> 00:41:59.801]  Boy, I tell ya, I agree with the Democrats on that.
[00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:00.943]  I'm a registered Democrat.
[00:42:01.183 --> 00:42:04.027]  Here's another one, a fellow wearing a Trump hat.
[00:42:04.348 --> 00:42:07.913]  They said, get ready to be shanked, Whitey, and stabbed him nine times.
[00:42:08.314 --> 00:42:10.377]  He's fighting for his life right now.
[00:42:10.717 --> 00:42:14.318]  When I talk about a political revolution, this is what I'm talking about.
[00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:41.132]  is for people all over this country to put pressure on every level of government.
[00:42:41.552 --> 00:42:43.533]  We've got to stand up and fight back.
[00:42:43.853 --> 00:42:49.074]  We have got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before.
[00:42:49.855 --> 00:42:52.856]  You have got to, Mary, act in an unprecedented way.
[00:42:53.056 --> 00:42:53.496]  Think big.
[00:42:54.116 --> 00:42:56.179]  Get involved in every way that you can.
[00:42:56.759 --> 00:42:59.423]  So Mary, stand up and fight back in every way that you can.
[00:43:11.477 --> 00:43:12.538]  I need to settle down!
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:15.020]  There's only one way for me to settle down.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:26.307]  I do what old Stephen Colbert says and I take the super cuck beta male vitality to try to counterbalance a little bit of the old manliness I'm about to get into with the gay frogs.
[00:43:26.327 --> 00:43:28.029]  Let me just take a little bit of this because it's so strong.
[00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.112]  Oh that's good stuff right there.
[00:43:31.132 --> 00:43:32.393]  Let me calm down.
[00:43:32.493 --> 00:43:35.376]  Oh lordy lordy.
[00:43:35.396 --> 00:43:40.501]  I'm feeling a little bit better now.
[00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:43.164]  Now let me get to the real news while we were talking about this.
[00:43:44.105 --> 00:43:51.673]  The truth is Jones is telling you about gay frogs and gay fish and all the rest of this because he doesn't want you to be liberated from your male vitality.
[00:43:52.354 --> 00:44:00.343]  And the truth is the good people at CBS and others have been running this good program for you and your family to drink Bisphenol A and
[00:44:01.063 --> 00:44:20.834]  All the other estrogen mimickers that are out there, so let me show you some of the mainstream news telling you about the animals, so you can understand just what a big liar Alex Jones is, misrepresenting the fact that I believe that we should take estrogen, and I believe we should get the increased cancers that come along with it, and that none of us should have a debate about this.
[00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:26.718]  So, I'm going to show you this, but just like they said on CNN, only I can show you the WikiLeaks, nobody else can.
[00:44:26.878 --> 00:44:30.060]  Only good old Tuck Buckford, and this is not a toupee, by the way.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.683]  Also interesting is, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[00:44:35.743 --> 00:44:36.723]  It's different for the media.
[00:44:36.743 --> 00:44:39.625]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:43.627]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.408]  I'm not a toupee, by the way.
[00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:48.530]  It's brought to you by lizard penis flavored yogurt.
[00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:49.611]  Here you go.
[00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:53.413]  Animals sexual changes linked to waste chemicals.
[00:44:54.429 --> 00:45:00.695]  And it reports that the majority in these studies of the frogs are now bisexual or gay or sterilized.
[00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:03.718]  But again, you need to look into that for yourself.
[00:45:03.998 --> 00:45:05.840]  I want to bring up my next guest.
[00:45:07.116 --> 00:45:12.620]  Donald John Trump, he's been on the show before, but he's now joining us again.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.563]  And he better keep his mouth shut here for a minute, because I'm not like Alex Jones.
[00:45:17.103 --> 00:45:18.304]  I don't believe in political violence.
[00:45:18.344 --> 00:45:19.905]  That's why I promote it continually.
[00:45:20.206 --> 00:45:25.349]  That's called the oxymoron leftist mind control system that I bought into, because I want to be in charge.
[00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.171]  We have a record high stock market.
[00:45:27.711 --> 00:45:41.240]  Three plus trillion dollars and he took us out of these multinational secret deals that took over Congress like the TPP and the carbon tax and now new big studies and mainstream news report it wasn't 3.3 million illegals that may have voted but 5.7.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.201]  So he lied to us!
[00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:43.921]  He said it was only 3.2, 3.3.
[00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:49.746]  He lied to us when it was two million or more than that.
[00:45:50.226 --> 00:45:55.030]  And he just, he just, he's the biggest liar keeping his promises I've ever seen.
[00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.733]  So when they have Shakespeare in the park saying kill Trump, it's no big deal.
[00:45:59.833 --> 00:46:01.615]  Madonna says kill him, blow him up.
[00:46:02.215 --> 00:46:06.579]  It's the coolest thing to do in the world, but the left then claims that the right wing's violent because they are.
[00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:07.800]  I just want to say,
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.340]  You know, this isn't violent at all, okay?
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.061]  This right here, this is not violent at all when I do this to Trump.
[00:46:14.381 --> 00:46:15.021]  You understand?
[00:46:15.882 --> 00:46:17.382]  Let me just explain that to everybody.
[00:46:17.402 --> 00:46:23.303]  I mean, if I sit here and just start ripping his head off and doing this, this is liberal and this is open.
[00:46:23.343 --> 00:46:27.904]  If we ban free speech on colleges and arrest everybody, it's a good thing, okay?
[00:46:28.644 --> 00:46:37.786]  So, let's get that straight right now that the real Tuck Buckford's here and Alex Jones and all the rest of them better understand that we run this country now.
[00:46:39.505 --> 00:46:40.565]  Like North Korea!
[00:46:41.005 --> 00:46:42.046]  And I like Colbert!
[00:46:42.906 --> 00:46:45.647]  I don't want the tens of millions he gets selling out of America!
[00:46:46.647 --> 00:46:47.427]  I love it!
[00:46:47.808 --> 00:46:49.428]  I absolutely love it!
[00:46:49.648 --> 00:46:51.609]  Tuck Buckford loves Colbert!
[00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.489]  I hate Alex Jones!
[00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.270]  It's brain fight!
[00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:55.990]  Yeah!
[00:46:57.091 --> 00:47:01.372]  Yogurt!
[00:47:01.792 --> 00:47:07.734]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:59.082]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.396 --> 00:49:16.659]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy.
[00:49:17.419 --> 00:49:28.123]  So there is Nancy Pelosi telling the American people that the reason why they need to pass the bill to see what's in it, that's just how it goes.
[00:49:28.973 --> 00:49:33.634]  See, we can't tell you what's in the bill until it's passed so we can see what's in it.
[00:49:34.234 --> 00:49:38.335]  That's what Nancy Pelosi said originally when addressing Obamacare.
[00:49:38.355 --> 00:49:41.756]  In fact, let's roll that one more time just to hit home.
[00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:42.816]  Nancy Pelosi.
[00:49:44.417 --> 00:49:48.918]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:50:02.606]  So there you go, again, Nancy Pelosi telling you, you have to pass the Affordable Care Act, you have to pass the Obamacare bill, in order to see what's in it.
[00:50:03.007 --> 00:50:10.490]  That's the Democrats telling you, that's how to handle Obamacare, that's how you'll find out what's in the healthcare bill.
[00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:13.232]  Now, let's fast forward.
[00:50:14.434 --> 00:50:19.499]  This was a story that was actually published two days ago, but it just became even more relevant today.
[00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:27.907]  Bernie Sanders says the GOP needs to release what's in this bill before they pass it.
[00:50:28.487 --> 00:50:29.388]  Well, wait a second.
[00:50:30.189 --> 00:50:32.911]  That's exactly what the Democrats did.
[00:50:34.133 --> 00:50:37.336]  So here's Bernie Sanders telling the people
[00:50:38.775 --> 00:50:41.017]  It's unprecedented what the GOP is doing.
[00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.099]  It's unbelievable what the GOP is doing.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:50.066]  How dare the GOP want to pass a health care bill without releasing the contents of that bill to the public?
[00:50:51.127 --> 00:50:57.234]  Except he was silent when the Democrats did that exact thing for Obamacare.
[00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:04.495]  This is just one example of the Democrat hypocrisy with Obamacare.
[00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:07.156]  Do as I say, not as I do.
[00:51:08.056 --> 00:51:12.037]  But it just got a little richer today because, guess what?
[00:51:12.457 --> 00:51:17.138]  The GOP has just released their draft of their health care bill.
[00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:17.979]  That's right.
[00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:26.201]  On the Senate's budget website, budget.senate.gov, you can go and you can look at the PDF.
[00:51:26.321 --> 00:51:27.261]  There it is, right there.
[00:51:28.102 --> 00:51:28.443]  HR 1628?
[00:51:29.185 --> 00:51:33.299]  And it's got all the details in there.
[00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:36.346]  How do you like that?
[00:51:36.406 --> 00:51:37.407]  That's a long document.
[00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:38.447]  They just released it today.
[00:51:38.487 --> 00:51:39.827]  I'm not going to act like I read it all.
[00:51:40.728 --> 00:51:42.168]  I don't want to read it all either.
[00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:42.828]  It's so long.
[00:51:43.189 --> 00:51:44.009]  But there you go!
[00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:45.489]  They put it out there.
[00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:54.352]  They put it on the government website so that the people can see a draft of the health care bill that the GOP is discussing right now.
[00:51:54.612 --> 00:51:55.733]  They're dubbing it Trumpcare.
[00:51:56.393 --> 00:51:58.274]  Really, the left is dubbing it that more than anything.
[00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:01.807]  They're releasing it to the public.
[00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:03.448]  They're showing you what they're discussing.
[00:52:03.688 --> 00:52:06.271]  They're showing you a draft of the bill they want to pass.
[00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:18.080]  Now, I don't know if this bill is going to pass the Senate or not, but the point is, you had Democrats saying, we have to pass the bill to see what's in it about Obamacare.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.103]  Then you had Democrats, it wasn't just Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer was crying about it too.
[00:52:22.643 --> 00:52:29.529]  You had Democrats crying, oh my gosh, the Republicans aren't showing us what's in the bill before they release it, it must be so bad, it must be the worst thing ever.
[00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:42.541]  Even though that's the truth about Obamacare, literally to a T, and then the GOP actually comes out and releases a draft of the bill that they want to sign into law.
[00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:53.551]  So I wonder if Chuck Schumer, I wonder if Bernie Sanders, if they will go and look at this 142 pages of the bill that the GOP released today, a draft of the bill they want to pass.
[00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:56.933]  Do you think Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer will apologize?
[00:52:56.953 --> 00:53:02.776]  Do you think Nancy Pelosi will say, hey, wow, unlike Obamacare, we're actually getting to see what's in the bill before they pass it?
[00:53:03.176 --> 00:53:05.397]  For some reason, I doubt it.
[00:53:06.458 --> 00:53:15.802]  But let's get into some facts about Obamacare that really need to be highlighted, I think, right now, especially during these debates.
[00:53:16.183 --> 00:53:20.305]  And the White House's Twitter account is doing a great job hammering home these facts.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.221]  Like this tweet.
[00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:24.863]  Think about that, folks.
[00:53:24.903 --> 00:53:26.124]  Just think about the notion of that.
[00:53:26.144 --> 00:53:28.546]  Three billion dollars to the IRS for nothing.
[00:53:49.955 --> 00:53:53.816]  No coverage, no services, no representation.
[00:53:54.456 --> 00:54:03.799]  Just $3 billion flushed down the drain because that's less money than people would have had to spend on healthcare.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.380]  Just think about that.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.221]  Just let that soak in for a second.
[00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:18.804]  Six and a half million Americans spent $3 billion to avoid Obamacare because it was unaffordable for them.
[00:54:20.635 --> 00:54:22.516]  So much for the Affordable Health Care Act.
[00:54:22.876 --> 00:54:27.277]  Of course, what you'll have is the Democrats saying, oh, well, those are the rich people.
[00:54:27.317 --> 00:54:29.478]  Those are the rich people that just don't want Obamacare.
[00:54:30.178 --> 00:54:33.259]  No, if it was the rich people, they would have paid for Obamacare.
[00:54:33.459 --> 00:54:34.299]  That's the point.
[00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:36.019]  See, don't you get it now?
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.440]  And it goes on.
[00:54:38.863 --> 00:54:40.804]  Again, the White House is tweeting all about it.
[00:54:41.165 --> 00:54:46.268]  It talks about how the rise in the cost and premiums is skyrocketing, causing people to drop.
[00:54:46.628 --> 00:54:55.314]  It's talking about how there's multiple states now where you're looking at coverage from only one person or only one company, for example.
[00:54:56.528 --> 00:55:06.078]  Next year, 94 out of 99 counties in Iowa will only have one insurer selling Obamacare coverage with no other choices.
[00:55:06.398 --> 00:55:07.599]  And that's just one state.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.582]  I know that it's bad in other states, too.
[00:55:11.644 --> 00:55:19.712]  So, you've got all of that, Obamacare becoming Monopolycare, the Democrats being total hypocrites about it, and
[00:55:21.078 --> 00:55:21.938]  It's just failing.
[00:55:22.039 --> 00:55:23.699]  It's completely failed Americans.
[00:55:23.799 --> 00:55:25.120]  It hasn't helped anybody at all.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.062]  And they're stealing money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just to pay the bills.
[00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:30.623]  So now...
[00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:42.544]  They've actually taken it a step further and the website has now just launched a website to repeal the Affordable Care Act, repeal and replace Obamacare.
[00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:51.746]  And again, I think that this is just another example of Trump's White House signaling that they are taking this seriously, repealing and replacing Obamacare.
[00:55:54.642 --> 00:56:03.458]  I don't think the Trump constituents really care too much about a website or a notion signaling that you care about repealing and replacing.
[00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:04.960]  We just want it done.
[00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:06.648]  Okay?
[00:56:06.968 --> 00:56:07.869]  Just like taxes.
[00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:09.530]  We just want the taxes cut.
[00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:14.553]  We don't want to hear about your plans being pushed back another hundred days, pushed back towards deer season, whatever it is.
[00:56:14.974 --> 00:56:16.715]  Just get it done.
[00:56:16.735 --> 00:56:17.776]  Okay?
[00:56:18.236 --> 00:56:22.519]  And I don't even see why this whole repeal and replace notion even exists.
[00:56:22.959 --> 00:56:25.641]  Why can't you just repeal it and go back to the way it was before?
[00:56:26.001 --> 00:56:29.203]  I'm sorry, was insurance in America bad before?
[00:56:29.583 --> 00:56:31.685]  Were people struggling to get healthcare before?
[00:56:32.085 --> 00:56:33.005]  No, they weren't.
[00:56:33.406 --> 00:56:35.007]  And there was charity care as well.
[00:56:36.095 --> 00:56:37.176]  Now it just gets worse.
[00:56:37.316 --> 00:56:38.136]  Here's a graphic.
[00:56:38.376 --> 00:56:40.677]  Talk about what Obamacare did to the economy.
[00:56:41.278 --> 00:56:51.143]  Take a look at how the number of immigrants that have come into the United States, and this is just, I assume this study just focuses on legal immigrants.
[00:56:51.503 --> 00:56:55.245]  Imagine if you did this study including illegal immigrants or non-citizens.
[00:56:55.605 --> 00:57:02.869]  You look at the rate that we've taken immigrants into this country and then you compare that side by side with the welfare state.
[00:57:03.729 --> 00:57:07.311]  That's the bar graphs on the right, guys, if you would actually click those graphs on the right.
[00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:10.332]  So you can see the area in red that's highlighted.
[00:57:10.392 --> 00:57:12.033]  If you actually click the picture, it'll blow up.
[00:57:12.513 --> 00:57:13.093]  I think it will.
[00:57:14.414 --> 00:57:18.395]  It's actually highlighting those same dates right there, as you can see.
[00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:29.180]  The same spike that you're seeing right there, all-time highs in food stamp participation, can be correlated with the number of immigrants coming into this country.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.901]  The only thing that I think could be deemed
[00:57:33.157 --> 00:57:46.747]  Perhaps missing from this study is the illegal immigrant or the non-citizen faction of this, because I would actually believe they're more responsible for the spike in food stamps than actual immigrants that went through the process the right way.
[00:57:47.827 --> 00:57:51.950]  But those studies I'm sure will come out, but again, you have to look at this for what it is.
[00:57:52.531 --> 00:57:55.653]  That's what you get when you bring more people in here that need stuff.
[00:57:55.673 --> 00:57:57.874]  You're going to have to increase your welfare spending.
[00:57:57.894 --> 00:57:59.996]  You're going to have to get more people on food stamps.
[00:58:00.496 --> 00:58:04.602]  Now, you have Democrats that want a $15 minimum wage.
[00:58:04.642 --> 00:58:06.063]  They'll cry about this all day long.
[00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.045]  But guess what, folks?
[00:58:08.006 --> 00:58:10.629]  They won't even pay their own people $15 an hour.
[00:58:13.226 --> 00:58:17.568]  So again, this is just the hypocrisy of the Democrats, you know.
[00:58:18.108 --> 00:58:21.149]  We need to see what's in the bill before we can pass it, when they never did that.
[00:58:21.489 --> 00:58:23.990]  We want $15 an hour minimum wage, but they don't pay that.
[00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:28.651]  Now here's Trey Gowdy admitting that the DNC is obstructing justice.
[00:58:29.392 --> 00:58:35.274]  If they had turned the server over to either you or Director Comey, maybe we would have known more.
[00:58:35.894 --> 00:58:38.155]  And maybe there would have been more for you to report.
[00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:48.727]  So I guess what I'm asking you is, why would the victim of a crime not turn over a server to the intelligence community or to law enforcement?
[00:58:48.827 --> 00:58:49.908]  I'm not going to argue with you, sir.
[00:58:51.649 --> 00:58:52.510]  That was a leading question.
[00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:53.850]  Because they're obstructing justice!
[00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:54.971]  Trey Gowdy knows that!
[00:58:55.051 --> 00:58:55.952]  Thank you for tuning in.
