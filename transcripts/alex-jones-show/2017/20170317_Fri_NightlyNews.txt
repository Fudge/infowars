[00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.657]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:22.298]  It is Friday, March 17th, 2017.
[00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:25.941]  I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:33.627]  Tonight, the Trump administration is taking a different approach to North Korea.
[00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:38.671]  They will not be tolerant, and they will not be pushed around by the North Korean dictatorship.
[00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:47.558]  Also, the recent revelations about the CIA have Congress in a tizzy, doing everything they can to try and save face.
[00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.174]  Meanwhile, 23% of public schools are now populated by immigrant households.
[00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:59.119]  But now, immigrants are actually trying to populate households that aren't theirs.
[00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:08.648]  And then, musician Kaya Jones speaks out on what it is like to be a Trump supporter in the music industry and what motivated her to go public.
[00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.258]  We don't talk about our political views.
[00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:14.139]  Everyone kind of just stays mum to the word.
[00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.020]  A lot of the reasons I even left the Pussycat Dolls.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.682]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:05.066]  Let me be very clear.
[00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:08.788]  The policy of strategic patience has ended.
[00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.712]  We're exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, and economic measures.
[00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:16.873]  All options are on the table.
[00:03:18.274 --> 00:03:19.455]  There you go, Kim Jong-un.
[00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:28.443]  There is a new sheriff in town that was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson letting the dictator know that he is dealing with a different Washington.
[00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:32.386]  They are taking a complete overhaul on the policy of dealing with North Korea.
[00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:38.051]  This is in the face of continued threats from North Korea, threatening their neighbors.
[00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:42.695]  So now we have the Secretary of State saying, look, all options are on the table.
[00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:43.955]  I think so.
[00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:10.066]  He urged China also to cease its economic retaliation against South Korea over its plan to host a U.S.
[00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:15.229]  missile shield here, calling it unnecessary, inappropriate and troubling.
[00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:20.411]  So, of course, you know, we're trying to deal with China as if they're kind of one of our allies there.
[00:04:20.772 --> 00:04:26.454]  But whenever it comes time to get to the negotiating table, they basically just come back and say, this is what North Korea wants.
[00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:27.335]  So do it.
[00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:30.777]  They're kind of playing both sides here in this game.
[00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:35.860]  Now, obviously they don't want to ramp it up and take military action.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.245]  He was very, very clear there in saying that he wants to maintain the peace in this area.
[00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:53.433]  But he does say preemptive military action against North Korea is possible if they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action.
[00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:56.175]  Again, he says all options are on the table.
[00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:03.905]  And as if to underline Tillerson's remarks, President Trump actually tweeted out that North Korea is behaving very badly.
[00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:06.929]  China has done little to help.
[00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.536]  And he also kind of referred back to how the Obama administration was hoping that it sanctions
[00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:13.297]  What's
[00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:42.193]  Dictator they were dealing with because with these crippling sanctions Kim Jong-un basically goes out to his people and says look We've got crippling sanctions put against us.
[00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:53.416]  You guys are gonna have to deal with a season of eating grass He actually told his people that they were gonna have to be eating blades of grass They should be thankful for the grass and that's that's what it is.
[00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.517]  So I mean that's the type of dictator that we're dealing with here and
[00:05:57.731 --> 00:06:01.214]  Now Tillerson also went with his first public engagement in Japan.
[00:06:01.234 --> 00:06:11.582]  They are children, school children, they're actually holding their first missile drill test in fears that North Korea could launch a missile there at the island.
[00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:21.590]  But he said, you know, the United States provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway.
[00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.973]  They got no results there that they could not
[00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:49.688]  Moderate the communist Kim regime and he then directed the government of China Which is North Korea's closest and most formidable ally to pressure North Korea into adhering to these international legal standards and looking to China to fulfill its obligations fully implement the sanctions called for because Because North Korea knows they can kind of go to China and say look, you know, give us a little help here guys so
[00:06:51.209 --> 00:07:02.854]  China says on one hand they're going to help the United States work with Russia and everything to kind of get the North Korea in check and then they go behind and then help them out.
[00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:05.035]  So these crippling sanctions really do nothing.
[00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:15.660]  Pretty interesting there and as I mentioned we're seeing now school children there in Japan practicing for a potential missile launch to hit
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.347]  Because this is following about a week after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japan's northwest coast.
[00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:29.973]  One rocket actually landed about 100 or so miles from very close there.
[00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.235]  So they're playing out these drill scenarios.
[00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:35.118]  But let's go ahead and have a little flashback here.
[00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:39.121]  Where did North Korea actually get this nuclear technology?
[00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:47.466]  Well, you can, you know, as they're developing this nuclear weapons program, credit should be given to the man who helped make that program possible.
[00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:57.814]  Here is Bill Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, explaining how his fake deal with North Korea let it go nuclear in order to keep America safe.
[00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:06.385]  Before I take your questions, I'd like to say just a word about the framework with North Korea that Ambassador Galushi signed this morning.
[00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:09.528]  This is a good deal for the United States.
[00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:13.372]  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program.
[00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:17.375]  South Korea and our other allies will be better protected.
[00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:22.160]  The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons.
[00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:31.470]  South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations, will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing.
[00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.731]  Okay, I've heard enough.
[00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:33.312]  I've heard enough.
[00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:45.384]  So, you know, this is very familiar to me because, as we know, Bill Clinton set them up and he said, we're going to keep them in check, we're going to help them out, but they're going to be good, they're going to let us in, let us inspect, and then what do they do?
[00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:45.784]  They just
[00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:50.008]  Shut down their doors and let no one in and become the hermit kingdom.
[00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:58.414]  Well, it sounds very familiar because it's the exact same thing Obama told us when he sold us this very good deal with Iran.
[00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:59.015]  Take a listen.
[00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:07.261]  Today, after many months of tough principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal.
[00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:09.807]  And it is a good deal.
[00:09:09.927 --> 00:09:10.908]  Ooh, is it a good deal?
[00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:13.171]  A deal that meets our core objectives.
[00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:14.973]  Hmm, gonna keep us safe, huh?
[00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:19.698]  This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.
[00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:20.779]  Sounds familiar.
[00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:28.347]  Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive
[00:09:31.736 --> 00:09:36.618]  Exactly.
[00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:41.961]  So this was the exact same story that was sold to us by former President Bill Clinton.
[00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:45.382]  Now here we have Obama kicking the can down the road.
[00:09:45.442 --> 00:09:53.906]  So what we're witnessing now with what's going on in North Korea, you can bet in about 10 years time, we're going to be having the same type of conversation over Iran.
[00:09:54.146 --> 00:09:55.007]  This is a country who...
[00:09:56.007 --> 00:09:59.189]  Trains its children to chant death to America.
[00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:08.414]  Their theme parks are little war zones where the little boys get to play soldier and chop off the heads of the infidel, which are the American people and American soldiers.
[00:10:08.994 --> 00:10:10.535]  So this is ridiculous.
[00:10:10.615 --> 00:10:12.556]  Thank you, former President Barack Obama.
[00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:16.198]  You have kicked the can down the road on this very good deal.
[00:10:16.318 --> 00:10:18.360]  So this is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.501]  We're going to probably be seeing more of this in the future.
[00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:27.611]  Now we're going to go to Owen Schroyer because he's got the latest on the threats facing President Trump and his family.
[00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.611]  So an interesting development today here.
[00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:40.217]  A laptop holding Trump Tower floor plans Hillary Clinton email investigation information was stolen from a secret service agent.
[00:10:40.277 --> 00:10:52.705]  Now authorities have been frantically searching for the laptop since it was stolen on Thursday morning and they're trying to determine if the thief knew what he was taking the obviously important information that was on that laptop.
[00:10:52.745 --> 00:10:53.826]  Now they say they don't know
[00:10:54.386 --> 00:11:02.414]  But most of the evidence would point to yes, whoever this thief was knew exactly what they were doing, but they're not willing to commit to that yet.
[00:11:02.814 --> 00:11:13.605]  The thief stepped out of a dark colored car, possibly an Uber car, they're not sure, stole the laptop from the agent's vehicle, they went into the vehicle, grabbed the laptop,
[00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:18.388]  Which was actually in a Secret Service case, and there was some other stuff in there.
[00:11:18.648 --> 00:11:23.251]  They found the abandoned case with the other belongings in it, but the laptop was still gone.
[00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:29.595]  They say that this laptop obviously has encrypted security, so it might be hard to get into.
[00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:31.636]  However, they do not know where it is.
[00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:32.997]  They do not know who has it.
[00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:36.079]  They don't know why it was taken, but it has Trump floor plans.
[00:11:36.499 --> 00:11:40.502]  It does have Hillary Clinton's information on her email investigation.
[00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:47.540]  And they have said that this could be potentially a risk to Trump's security, especially when he's at Trump Tower.
[00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:59.675]  That's really a very interesting thing, Owen, because a lot of people were very concerned about the the first family saying, you know, why are they going to be staying in Trump Tower where that's obviously much more safe for them to be at the White House.
[00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:01.196]  And here we see this threat.
[00:12:01.796 --> 00:12:11.560]  As we know, the NSA and others have the potential to break through with this encryption, and they stole the ability to break through the encryption from the Russian states and others.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.981]  So very interesting there that they're going to
[00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:20.026]  Also interesting that they mention that it's got Hillary Clinton investigation details as well on that laptop.
[00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:21.607]  Well, actually, you know, it's funny that you said that.
[00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:22.628]  I didn't think about this.
[00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:27.452]  Maybe they stole the laptop to try to scare Donald Trump into staying in D.C.
[00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:27.872]  Right.
[00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:28.673]  That's something.
[00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:34.638]  Because, of course, you have some people rumoring that there's a Russian stronghold nearby, that maybe it was a Russian that stole it.
[00:12:34.678 --> 00:12:35.639]  So we've got all the rumors.
[00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:40.183]  But nonetheless, they are looking into whoever stole this laptop and what the motives might be.
[00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:42.394]  Well, thank you very much, Owen Shroyer.
[00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:45.336]  So we will stay abreast of that situation.
[00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:55.084]  Now, coming up, David Knight has an incredible interview with someone revealing how easy it can be for your home to be stolen.
[00:12:55.404 --> 00:12:55.765]  That's right.
[00:12:55.805 --> 00:13:00.929]  We have illegal squatters in people's home actually switching the utility bills.
[00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:08.975]  And then when the homeowner comes home to try to get back in their house, they're unable to do that because the police say, well, it looks like the
[00:13:09.395 --> 00:13:11.136]  Their name is on the utility bills.
[00:13:11.156 --> 00:13:13.037]  You're going to have to prove that you own this home.
[00:13:13.718 --> 00:13:17.620]  Absolutely enraging story that you're going to hear coming up.
[00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:21.243]  And then we also have an interview with Kaia Jones.
[00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:27.827]  Now, she's a good friend with Joy Villa, who you might have remembered as the infamous Trump dress there at the Grammys.
[00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:37.713]  She was there with her friend Joy, and she is speaking out saying how important it is for entertainers, other people in Hollywood to step out of the closet
[00:13:38.093 --> 00:13:38.313]  Let's go
[00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:07.509]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House today to discuss shared economic goals between the United States and Germany.
[00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:09.529]  The talks began cordially enough.
[00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.209]  Chancellor Merkel.
[00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:35.729]  It is a great honor to welcome you to the People's House, the White House.
[00:14:36.349 --> 00:14:50.560]  I also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.
[00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:55.764]  Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together
[00:14:56.837 --> 00:15:01.809]  To protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:04.115]  And to defeat ISIS.
[00:15:05.942 --> 00:15:15.406]  I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member.
[00:15:16.146 --> 00:15:20.768]  We also recognize that immigration security is national security.
[00:15:21.448 --> 00:15:29.811]  We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders.
[00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:33.713]  Immigration is a privilege, not a right.
[00:15:35.253 --> 00:15:41.852]  And the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.
[00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:58.732]  But when the topic shifted to the civil war of fake news plaguing the success of Donald Trump's staggering agenda, well, Merkel chose to embrace a globalist tone rather than the populist nationalism sweeping parts of Europe and the United States.
[00:15:58.912 --> 00:16:05.317]  We have a tremendous group of people that listen and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.
[00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:07.038]  As far as
[00:16:08.659 --> 00:16:12.425]  Wiretapping, I guess, by, you know, this past administration.
[00:16:13.066 --> 00:16:15.108]  At least we have something in common, perhaps.
[00:16:21.776 --> 00:16:25.818]  How dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the US President is?
[00:16:25.898 --> 00:16:35.564]  What with the import terrorists that he plans and also with the fact that he doesn't think the EU doesn't deal with the EU in a very respectful way.
[00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:38.085]  And Mr. President, America first.
[00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.327]  Don't you think that this is going to weaken also the European Union?
[00:16:41.427 --> 00:16:45.569]  And why are you so scared of diversity in the news?
[00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:48.251]  Nice friendly reporter.
[00:16:49.582 --> 00:16:53.766]  Well, first of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy.
[00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:57.490]  But I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy.
[00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:04.538]  And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years, and that's going to stop.
[00:17:04.978 --> 00:17:06.440]  But I'm not an isolationist.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.983]  I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader.
[00:17:09.483 --> 00:17:19.177]  The success of Germans have always been one where the German success is one side of the coin and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration.
[00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:24.885]  That's something of which I'm deeply convinced and I'm not only saying this back home, I'm saying this here and secondly,
[00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:33.208]  I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an open-minded way, but also in a very fair way.
[00:17:33.288 --> 00:17:42.451]  Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of our economic progress, of peace, has been for many, many decades.
[00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:47.012]  The European countries for many, many centuries waged wars against each other.
[00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:55.014]  Traffickers have to be stopped, but this has to be done by looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities
[00:17:55.094 --> 00:17:55.574]  Yes, I think so.
[00:18:10.165 --> 00:18:13.769]  President Trump stood strong in the face of globalist rhetoric.
[00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:22.138]  At this point, indifferent to the throngs of leftist propaganda stooges lobbying their curveballs at the Trump administration agenda.
[00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:26.844]  A little lesson to the globalists visiting the people's house in the future.
[00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:29.106]  This is our house, not yours.
[00:18:29.406 --> 00:18:31.469]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:03.394]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:15.723]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.743 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.531]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.758]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.203 --> 00:23:13.305]  We are about to be joined by Kaia Jones, somebody I'm sure you would recognize from a group back in the day called the Pussycat Dolls.
[00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:21.908]  Well, she dropped the Pussycat Dolls and she decided to never wear a pussy hat, and now she joins Leanne McAdoo and I. Leanne, you know I was excited to talk to Kaia today.
[00:23:21.988 --> 00:23:23.008]  Very, very excited.
[00:23:23.388 --> 00:23:25.148]  We had to actually co-host the show today.
[00:23:25.829 --> 00:23:29.330]  Just a little background, Kaia Jones is an EDM artist.
[00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:35.171]  She said she was inspired by Joyvia to come out of the closet as a Trump supporter.
[00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:48.494]  So she now is speaking out for those who can't, people who really have been afraid to wear their clothing in support of Donald Trump because, you know, they might be afraid they're gonna get knocked out or punched or get their hat taken off or something.
[00:23:48.534 --> 00:23:50.575]  So, of course, Joyvia really made a
[00:23:51.155 --> 00:23:51.755]  I think so.
[00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:25.380]  Yeah, it's been kind of caging, almost imprisoned if you will.
[00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:41.779]  Now you mentioned that, you know, after your friend, which you're seen there with her, where she's wearing the dress, she made this bold statement really and you said, you know what, now I'm proud to show off my Donald Trump t-shirt you were never able to wear before.
[00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:43.199]  Yeah, it didn't.
[00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:45.600]  You know, it wasn't something that was prepared.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.261]  Joy and I go way back.
[00:24:47.341 --> 00:24:49.141]  We've been friends for a very long time.
[00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:53.763]  And I'm actually really good friends with Andre Soriano, the designer of the dress.
[00:24:54.323 --> 00:24:57.684]  He's actually did my 2014 Grammy dress.
[00:24:58.084 --> 00:25:00.745]  So we all have been friends for a good amount of time.
[00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:02.485]  And I didn't know she was going to wear that.
[00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:02.985]  No one did.
[00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:04.406]  We actually have the same makeup artist.
[00:25:04.886 --> 00:25:06.627]  The makeup artist didn't know what she was going to wear.
[00:25:06.647 --> 00:25:09.768]  So I knew then it was going to be something interesting.
[00:25:11.328 --> 00:25:12.829]  Because I asked her, I said, what's Joy wearing?
[00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:14.030]  And she goes, I don't know.
[00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.870]  I don't know.
[00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.832]  And I thought, interesting.
[00:25:17.352 --> 00:25:20.234]  So when we saw each other, I immediately embraced her.
[00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:22.815]  I just whispered in her ear, you're so brave and thank you.
[00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:27.899]  And then we were kind of just together for the rest of the night and saw the insanity that it caused.
[00:25:28.199 --> 00:25:30.921]  And it really did open up the floodgates for me.
[00:25:30.941 --> 00:25:32.922]  And I mean, so many other Americans.
[00:25:32.982 --> 00:25:35.183]  But for me, we had been friends a long time.
[00:25:35.644 --> 00:25:36.704]  Same with Andre Soriano.
[00:25:36.784 --> 00:25:38.726]  And none of us had discussed who we voted for.
[00:25:39.506 --> 00:25:43.068]  Not one conversation ever on we voted for Trump.
[00:25:43.088 --> 00:25:48.410]  And I think a lot of that is because the narrative is so not in a positive light.
[00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:58.934]  And, you know, I bought this beautiful shirt to support Trump last year when I was visiting NASA headquarters in Washington, and I wasn't able to wear it.
[00:25:59.194 --> 00:26:00.715]  And she said, will you do something for me?
[00:26:00.755 --> 00:26:02.655]  Can you can you come out and support?
[00:26:02.715 --> 00:26:03.816]  And I said, I'll do it in a second.
[00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:09.824]  Because she needed then someone to support and show that she's not alone in Hollywood.
[00:26:10.585 --> 00:26:15.793]  And unfortunately, everyone thinks that she is because, you know, not a lot of people have come out.
[00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:18.477]  There's very few that have come out, but we're here.
[00:26:18.797 --> 00:26:19.418]  There's a lot of us.
[00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:26.934]  When did you first decide that you were going to vote for Donald Trump, or when did you first decide to support Donald Trump?
[00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:31.220]  And then just to follow up on what you just said, is that typical to not talk about who you voted?
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.123]  Is that just standard, just nobody really talks about it?
[00:26:33.463 --> 00:26:37.829]  Or because of the polarized environment around this election, is that why no one was talking about it?
[00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.651]  Um, you know, those are both really good questions.
[00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:46.352]  I mean, the biggest thing is, yes, we don't talk about our political views.
[00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:49.213]  Everyone kind of just stays mum to the word.
[00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:58.935]  A lot of the reasons I even left the Pussycat Dolls, and you know, it came out in this flood of now being able to speak my truth and be honest with who I am and that I'm a conservative.
[00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:03.756]  You know, at the time, I thought being 19, 20, 21, like, there must be something wrong with me.
[00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:06.217]  Why am I not okay with certain things that were going on?
[00:27:06.237 --> 00:27:06.297]  And
[00:27:07.677 --> 00:27:10.479]  You know, I had no one really to go, no, you're just a conservative girl.
[00:27:10.659 --> 00:27:12.981]  You know, you love Jesus.
[00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:15.322]  You're just not into certain things.
[00:27:15.402 --> 00:27:17.024]  And I just didn't understand that.
[00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:24.649]  And so in this process, it opened up really me understanding that I'm a conservative and there is a name for this and this is what this is.
[00:27:24.749 --> 00:27:27.131]  And yeah, no one really shares.
[00:27:27.431 --> 00:27:28.652]  It's not something that people
[00:27:29.873 --> 00:27:30.714]  Openly share.
[00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:32.015]  I think of fear.
[00:27:32.215 --> 00:27:34.437]  For me, I knew when I was going to vote for Trump.
[00:27:35.437 --> 00:27:37.359]  We'll go a little bit further back than that.
[00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:47.126]  I started doing a lot of work for the LGBT community when I went over to Iraq in 2010 and did 20 shows in 10 days for our military in support.
[00:27:47.246 --> 00:27:53.711]  I met a lot of soldiers that were gay or lesbians and they weren't able to speak their truth during Prop 8.
[00:27:54.071 --> 00:27:55.272]  This was in that time.
[00:27:55.793 --> 00:27:56.994]  So I felt that it was important
[00:27:57.881 --> 00:27:58.021]  Yeah.
[00:28:16.893 --> 00:28:23.496]  The truth of what was going on, it forced me to kind of feel shunned by the community that I was the closest to the most.
[00:28:23.736 --> 00:28:29.998]  In this process of actually voting for Trump, one of the main reasons I did vote for Trump, he spoke about Orlando.
[00:28:30.078 --> 00:28:44.383]  That was a big deal for me, being a person that speaks out in the LGBT community and hearing him actually take a stance about what happened to Americans that night and to an attack on our LGBT community.
[00:28:46.304 --> 00:28:49.246]  That, for me, was one of the biggest reasons I voted for him.
[00:28:49.607 --> 00:28:57.812]  Also because he wasn't part of this whole collective of people that were going to tell you what to do and what to think, and they were part of the establishment.
[00:28:57.952 --> 00:28:58.853]  He didn't need the money.
[00:28:58.873 --> 00:29:02.515]  He wanted to do it for, you know, the love of country.
[00:29:02.536 --> 00:29:04.717]  And I understand that so much.
[00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:10.442]  That to me spoke volumes and I've always respected him as a businessman.
[00:29:10.502 --> 00:29:11.343]  I knew he was going to win.
[00:29:11.543 --> 00:29:19.730]  That's what's so funny is I actually told people two years, like literally when it started, when he announced, I said he was going to win and everybody I knew was like, no, he's not going to win.
[00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.911]  There's no way he's going to win.
[00:29:20.931 --> 00:29:21.691]  I said,
[00:29:22.472 --> 00:29:23.452]  Okay, you'll see.
[00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:27.534]  And I wasn't able to share my piece, because every time I tried, I was shut up.
[00:29:27.854 --> 00:29:34.657]  Like, immediately, like, oh, he's this, and he's that, and Hillary, and it was just, there was no discussion.
[00:29:34.697 --> 00:29:37.218]  There wasn't, this isn't, you know, a debate.
[00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:41.600]  This was, um, I hate you because you're voting for this person.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.381]  And that was something I had never encountered.
[00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:53.484]  Yeah, and you know that's funny that you talk about that, trying to have a discussion about why you're voting Trump or why you believe in these policies.
[00:29:53.844 --> 00:29:57.167]  Like you said, you can't really hold that discussion, and I had the same experience.
[00:29:57.187 --> 00:30:00.691]  I don't know about you, Leigh-Anne, but I would always end the argument, which is like, okay, you'll see.
[00:30:01.391 --> 00:30:02.512]  You're not going to listen to me.
[00:30:02.532 --> 00:30:04.674]  You're not going to let me tell you what's happening, so just fine.
[00:30:04.694 --> 00:30:05.875]  Just go ahead and you'll see.
[00:30:06.136 --> 00:30:07.177]  And well, they saw.
[00:30:08.832 --> 00:30:13.597]  Well, it's pretty amazing if you even just open up dialogue with people and then give them the facts.
[00:30:13.717 --> 00:30:19.885]  If they're willing to listen, I've had a lot of people change their mind and go, wow, I didn't even realize that because the media told me differently.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.060]  Oh yeah.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:31.409]  I mean, a lot of my really close friends, it was interesting, some from the LGBT community would call me and say, I'm voting for Trump.
[00:30:31.569 --> 00:30:36.453]  They almost like they knew I was, but I hadn't confirmed or denied anything with them.
[00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:40.396]  So they were reaching out already trying to say, I'm voting for Trump.
[00:30:40.437 --> 00:30:41.818]  And this was my truth.
[00:30:41.898 --> 00:30:43.459]  And I feel like you would understand.
[00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:47.022]  And, and that was interesting that there was this like secrecy.
[00:30:47.042 --> 00:30:47.282]  I think so.
[00:31:02.699 --> 00:31:03.219]  We're good to go.
[00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:25.754]  Anyone that didn't post anything, anyone that, you know, as much as people want to say, oh, they don't know what I, who I voted for or what my views are, they do.
[00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:34.080]  If you never posted or wrote anything about or even responded to any of the comments about the other candidate, it was pretty obvious who you were going to vote for.
[00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:38.723]  Yeah, like if you didn't tweet, Trump is a racist, you'd probably like him.
[00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:39.564]  That's right.
[00:31:39.624 --> 00:31:45.688]  And that's another thing that's really unfortunate is that, you know, you lost, get over it.
[00:31:46.048 --> 00:31:46.628]  Moving on.
[00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:47.929]  He is our president.
[00:31:48.309 --> 00:31:53.672]  And the reality of it is, is that the mocking of our first lady, the things that are going on is
[00:31:55.173 --> 00:31:59.876]  It's just kind of crude and no couth or class and our country is not that.
[00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:01.957]  That is not what America is about.
[00:32:02.037 --> 00:32:03.298]  We are a civilized nation.
[00:32:03.658 --> 00:32:09.502]  So this anarchy of angst and anger when they've been in power for eight years,
[00:32:10.302 --> 00:32:13.723]  And now it's time to shift the pendulum, which is what politics is.
[00:32:13.783 --> 00:32:16.484]  It doesn't move a lot in a fast amount of time.
[00:32:16.544 --> 00:32:19.165]  It swings a little bit here, swings a little bit there.
[00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:21.205]  We somehow over time find a center.
[00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:26.167]  And so I just find it appalling that, you know, you didn't think he would accept
[00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:30.311]  You know, the results, we accepted them because we won.
[00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:37.137]  And now you're belittling and being mean and rude to anyone that loves country.
[00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:44.243]  The millions of Americans that have already died for our nation, you know, going to Iraq, I almost want to say every artist should just do that.
[00:32:44.603 --> 00:32:50.809]  Philanthropy work, go to Iraq, go to some bases, go visit our military, see what these people really do.
[00:32:51.249 --> 00:32:53.730]  And the reality is that our country is not free.
[00:32:54.170 --> 00:33:00.652]  There's a lot of blood and bones on our flag of people that have died to protect our nation.
[00:33:06.514 --> 00:33:16.038]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.436]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.857]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.877 --> 00:36:50.857]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.400]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:07.090]  Okay, welcome back.
[00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.731]  My guest today, Eddie Bravo, here in studio with us.
[00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:12.073]  In this segment, it's going to be Eddie Bravo unplugged.
[00:37:12.113 --> 00:37:17.236]  We're bringing Owen Schroyer in to help just come full circle with the chaos here.
[00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:23.681]  I know one of your theories, or you kind of toy with this, is dinosaurs not existing.
[00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:27.143]  Now, you talk a little bit on the Alex Jones Show about the bones in the museums.
[00:37:27.183 --> 00:37:28.304]  Dinosaur bones aren't
[00:37:29.096 --> 00:37:29.557]  Most of them.
[00:37:29.817 --> 00:37:31.519]  Yeah, they're not typically bones, which is true.
[00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:42.991]  All I knew about dinosaurs is they lived millions and millions of years ago and then bones were discovered and then they're in museums and they're in kids books.
[00:37:44.132 --> 00:37:45.153]  Jurassic Park.
[00:37:46.094 --> 00:37:46.574]  That's it.
[00:37:46.775 --> 00:37:49.077]  That's all, you know, that's all I've ever really known about dinosaurs.
[00:37:49.097 --> 00:37:50.659]  I was fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid.
[00:37:51.619 --> 00:38:13.093]  I don't I don't really never really think about dinosaurs but being a conspiracy theorist my I look at conspiracy theories like or science it's just like science I believe in of course it'd be stupid to say you don't believe in science I believe in science but it's got to be unbiased science and it can't be government science so yeah and science itself is only a few hundred years old anytime science
[00:38:15.081 --> 00:38:24.571]  Like, if I gotta take... Like, there's all these conspiracy theories, like dinosaurs don't exist, nuclear bombs don't exist, forests don't exist, all this shit, it doesn't exist, it never happened.
[00:38:24.692 --> 00:38:25.532]  Then nothing exists!
[00:38:25.552 --> 00:38:28.616]  Yeah, but, and people think, man, there's so many conspiracy theories.
[00:38:28.636 --> 00:38:35.223]  There's actually not that many, because, um, like, there's not a conspiracy theory that aircraft carriers don't exist, right?
[00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:40.654]  Because you don't need to take someone's word for it that they exist.
[00:38:40.814 --> 00:38:41.514]  You've seen it.
[00:38:41.974 --> 00:38:43.515]  There's enough video footage.
[00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:45.696]  There's no way they could have faked, you know, people.
[00:38:46.216 --> 00:38:46.676]  They exist.
[00:38:46.917 --> 00:38:47.877]  Tanks exist.
[00:38:47.917 --> 00:38:50.278]  There's no conspiracy theory that tanks don't exist.
[00:38:50.398 --> 00:39:02.003]  But there are people, legitimately brilliant people I know, that believe that humans have only been around like 7,000 years and that they were alive at the same time as the dinosaurs and there's no way the dinosaur bones are millions of years old.
[00:39:02.023 --> 00:39:02.723]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:39:02.763 --> 00:39:03.203]  Anytime there's
[00:39:05.444 --> 00:39:19.530]  Something out there, like for me, this is just my personal thing, is if I have to take someone's word for it, some unknown government scientist with some unknown experiments and I just say, yeah, they figured it out, they figured it out.
[00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.772]  I, to me, when we're talking about the government, government is like a criminal on trial.
[00:39:25.412 --> 00:39:28.294]  And I explained this last night, but I'll make it brief.
[00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:32.340]  I don't know.
[00:39:49.722 --> 00:39:55.667]  You know, it's proven that these monsters lived millions and years, millions of years ago.
[00:39:56.388 --> 00:40:02.213]  You know, and then all these guys are scamming bones and they're finding whale bones and telling people they're dinosaur bones.
[00:40:02.393 --> 00:40:06.357]  All these scams and frauds and that's where our dinosaur knowledge comes from.
[00:40:07.327 --> 00:40:10.368]  So that's something right there.
[00:40:10.688 --> 00:40:16.149]  For me, when I found out, I didn't even know there was a conspiracy theory that dinosaurs didn't exist.
[00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.530]  But once that came up, I thought about it for a second.
[00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.171]  I'm like, well, I've never seen a dinosaur.
[00:40:21.451 --> 00:40:22.771]  But what about the bones, right?
[00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:24.392]  Or their footprints?
[00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:27.352]  You know, for me, dinosaurs may exist.
[00:40:27.853 --> 00:40:29.013]  I didn't give a s***.
[00:40:29.073 --> 00:40:30.773]  I don't have a stock in dinosaurs.
[00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:31.373]  I don't care.
[00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:32.814]  I know the government's full of s***.
[00:40:33.374 --> 00:40:33.594]  I think?
[00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:49.013]  Man, there was a lot of tomfoolery going around with dinosaurs.
[00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:55.980]  And then when you find out that none of the bones you see in museums are real dinosaur bones.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.921]  They're too sensitive.
[00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:59.623]  They have to lock them up.
[00:40:59.884 --> 00:41:00.644]  No one can see them.
[00:41:00.945 --> 00:41:04.188]  And the ones we see are replicas.
[00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:13.371]  So, the only time, the only reason it's cool to see a skeleton of a dinosaur is when it's actually a skeleton of a dinosaur.
[00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:14.991]  If it's a replica, that's not cool.
[00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:16.972]  Just put replica skin on it, too.
[00:41:17.172 --> 00:41:18.793]  Just put the skin and the tongue and all that.
[00:41:19.113 --> 00:41:20.133]  If it's fake, it's fake.
[00:41:20.193 --> 00:41:30.056]  Okay, well then, on that then, because here's the other thing is that my brother-in-law works for NASA and so he's gonna let me go and go through the whole facility and everything.
[00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:31.977]  I don't get to go into the alien room or whatever.
[00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:34.597]  He butts head with that.
[00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:38.838]  So that we can once and for all debunk this flat earth theory, but maybe we won't debunk it.
[00:41:38.978 --> 00:41:44.220]  I don't know, because this flat earth thing became super popular here in the last two years, right?
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.420]  Where people are extremely smart.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.141]  It was really popular 500 years ago.
[00:41:48.161 --> 00:41:48.601]  It was huge.
[00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.201]  Well, yeah.
[00:41:50.561 --> 00:41:57.183]  People are like extremely smart putting out all of this information to explain this flat earth.
[00:41:57.443 --> 00:41:58.723]  So where do you stand on it?
[00:41:59.249 --> 00:42:04.475]  Well, when I first heard about Flat Earth, it was probably like a year and a half ago on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[00:42:05.336 --> 00:42:16.407]  We were talking about something and then Joe was trying to explain how dumb people are and goes, dude, there's people that still believe the earth is flat and the sun is 3,000 miles away.
[00:42:16.908 --> 00:42:18.449]  And I remember this like a year and a half ago.
[00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.050]  I'm a grown ass.
[00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:19.490]  I was in my 40s.
[00:42:21.294 --> 00:42:22.795]  Balls deep in conspiracies.
[00:42:22.995 --> 00:42:23.696]  My whole life.
[00:42:24.456 --> 00:42:29.100]  And when I heard that, I thought, oh, like, what are they, like, just super religious people?
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.683]  I mean, like, people, people actually still believe the earth is flat.
[00:42:32.723 --> 00:42:35.044]  That's, this is just me, like, a year and a half ago.
[00:42:35.064 --> 00:42:37.987]  And then a few months later, I do the podcast again.
[00:42:38.007 --> 00:42:39.608]  And then Joe brings it up again.
[00:42:39.648 --> 00:42:42.650]  He goes, flat earth theory.
[00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.432]  And I thought, and I said, he asked me, I think.
[00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:47.894]  What do you think of the flat earth?
[00:42:47.954 --> 00:42:55.120]  And I thought, and I know I said this on this podcast, I go, it's got to be some CIA psyop, kind of like Scientology.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.223]  It's got to be like Scientology where they're just checking to see how stupid people are.
[00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.864]  The earth is flat?
[00:43:01.104 --> 00:43:01.865]  That's ridiculous.
[00:43:01.925 --> 00:43:03.126]  I'm like, I had an iPhone 4.
[00:43:03.426 --> 00:43:05.248]  I saw the picture of the earth.
[00:43:05.948 --> 00:43:06.890]  That blue marble.
[00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.054]  Oh my God, iPhone, my smartphone every day.
[00:43:10.074 --> 00:43:10.795]  That was the default.
[00:43:11.096 --> 00:43:11.276]  I go.
[00:43:11.296 --> 00:43:13.679]  There's no way you're going to convince me.
[00:43:13.879 --> 00:43:17.625]  I mean, like it had to be CISI and then that's it.
[00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:21.610]  And then a few months later, like maybe less than a year ago,
[00:43:22.111 --> 00:43:26.794]  Talking about, I'm going off on conspiracy theories in my class, my jiu-jitsu class.
[00:43:26.814 --> 00:43:27.555]  Going off!
[00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:30.717]  I'm getting mad at people that don't believe this or that.
[00:43:30.757 --> 00:43:32.438]  I'm like, I'm like getting freaking crazy.
[00:43:32.758 --> 00:43:35.100]  And then some guy goes, yeah, I agree with everything you said.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.160]  Have you looked into Flat Earth?
[00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.062]  I said, dude, please, please, Flat Earth.
[00:43:39.643 --> 00:43:41.644]  That's got to be the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
[00:43:41.844 --> 00:43:43.726]  You're like, no, no, that's too crazy for me.
[00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:50.590]  It's got to be the most... Dinosaurs aren't real, but Flat Earth... I'm like, please, you're distracting from the real issues here that we have to deal with.
[00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.531]  The real issues.
[00:43:52.413 --> 00:43:54.443]  And he said, OK, OK.
[00:43:54.544 --> 00:43:56.111]  And I told him, just please.
[00:43:56.852 --> 00:43:57.132]  Zip it!
[00:43:57.993 --> 00:44:02.977]  And then, a couple months later, another one of my students said, hey man, you ever look into flat earth?
[00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:09.063]  And I said, I looked over him, and I wanted, I was like angry, and all of a sudden, I just wanted to debunk him.
[00:44:09.223 --> 00:44:13.126]  I go, that is, that's the dumbest thing ever.
[00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:16.969]  And he said, hey listen man, I got a master's in engineering, look into it.
[00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.971]  You do the math, you do the science.
[00:44:18.991 --> 00:44:20.332]  And I'm like, dude, I'm no scientist.
[00:44:20.993 --> 00:44:23.915]  But I could prove that the world is round in one minute.
[00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:26.799]  So we're texting each other back and forth.
[00:44:26.859 --> 00:44:28.100]  I'm like, dude, come on, man.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.582]  Well, what was it about the theory?
[00:44:29.682 --> 00:44:33.746]  What was it about the theory that just got you where you're like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[00:44:33.927 --> 00:44:34.888]  The earth is flat.
[00:44:35.308 --> 00:44:35.569]  Yeah.
[00:44:35.689 --> 00:44:37.170]  And the sun is 3000 miles.
[00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.593]  But did you debunk him or did he?
[00:44:39.693 --> 00:44:42.477]  No, I went home and I go, I'm just going to find a picture.
[00:44:42.877 --> 00:44:43.598]  It's really simple.
[00:44:43.638 --> 00:44:45.200]  You don't, you know, all these people that are
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.381]  It's not really simple, okay?
[00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.121]  It's not really.
[00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:49.061]  No, it's simple.
[00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:50.481]  No, it's not.
[00:44:50.601 --> 00:44:54.703]  I'm going to go, there's got to be tens of thousands of pictures of Earth from space.
[00:44:55.003 --> 00:44:56.043]  I don't need any science.
[00:44:56.263 --> 00:44:57.784]  I don't need an engineering degree.
[00:44:58.264 --> 00:45:01.205]  I don't need how to put numbers together and all this stuff.
[00:45:01.825 --> 00:45:07.987]  Just show, I'm going to show you pictures, many pictures, and I'm going to text them to you, show you pictures of Earth from space.
[00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:12.108]  So, you go to Google and you'll, uh, pictures of Earth from space.
[00:45:12.808 --> 00:45:19.854]  And you look at them and obviously like right away I thought, this is all, these are all CGI cartoon.
[00:45:20.075 --> 00:45:22.937]  There should be tens of thousands of real actual pictures.
[00:45:23.498 --> 00:45:28.422]  So then I started looking into it and then I thought, and these pictures are coming from the NASA website, nasa.gov.
[00:45:28.883 --> 00:45:29.123]  I'm like,
[00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.432]  NASA is in charge of space information?
[00:45:45.962 --> 00:45:50.846]  So you're telling me that the satellites have like this beaming light?
[00:45:51.046 --> 00:45:51.727]  No!
[00:45:51.827 --> 00:45:53.268]  They're not a beaming light!
[00:45:53.288 --> 00:45:56.011]  Satellites have a beaming light that you can see from the ground?
[00:45:56.031 --> 00:45:56.371]  No they don't!
[00:45:56.391 --> 00:45:57.472]  They don't even have a light!
[00:45:57.512 --> 00:45:58.573]  You can see them!
[00:45:58.593 --> 00:45:59.494]  So what am I seeing?
[00:45:59.514 --> 00:46:00.394]  So what are we seeing?
[00:46:00.514 --> 00:46:00.975]  So what is it?
[00:46:01.055 --> 00:46:01.715]  I see it.
[00:46:01.756 --> 00:46:02.156]  What is it?
[00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:02.596]  Okay, again.
[00:46:07.344 --> 00:46:08.665]  A plane is at 30,000 feet.
[00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:21.610]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:46:37.196 --> 00:46:41.817]  They're gonna have all that energy and they're gonna have a beam of light coming out of a satellite.
[00:46:41.897 --> 00:46:47.879]  Eddie Bravo, millions of people out there who have seen satellites with their naked eye want to know then, what is it?
[00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:54.440]  How can you see a bus 200,000 feet in the air?
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.821]  They're not that far out of the Earth's atmosphere.
[00:46:57.841 --> 00:46:59.321]  You can't see a plane.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.514 --> 00:48:59.059]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.079 --> 00:48:59.960]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.020]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.664 --> 00:49:10.325]  I had a friend contact me yesterday and tell me something that happened to his employee.
[00:49:10.345 --> 00:49:13.267]  And I want you to pay attention to this because this could very well happen to you.
[00:49:13.287 --> 00:49:15.027]  It may have already happened to somebody that you know.
[00:49:15.568 --> 00:49:16.188]  It's not new.
[00:49:16.208 --> 00:49:19.629]  But what is new is the extent that it is being done.
[00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.790]  It's a scam.
[00:49:21.716 --> 00:49:26.958]  It's outrageous, and when you first hear it, it is absolutely unbelievable, but it's absolutely true.
[00:49:26.998 --> 00:49:27.839]  Let me tell you what happened.
[00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:33.321]  This guy, who, his employee, very successful employee, has a job, has a home.
[00:49:33.962 --> 00:49:37.643]  Now he is homeless, and he is facing criminal charges.
[00:49:37.743 --> 00:49:38.264]  What happened?
[00:49:38.304 --> 00:49:41.665]  Well, he was gone for quite some time, off on an assignment.
[00:49:41.865 --> 00:49:46.127]  When he comes back, he finds that there are people living in his home.
[00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:47.028]  Squatters.
[00:49:48.157 --> 00:49:55.202]  About six or more Middle Eastern people who are immigrants, refugees, whatever, and they refuse to leave.
[00:49:55.783 --> 00:49:56.764]  So he calls the police.
[00:49:56.804 --> 00:50:01.287]  When the police arrive, they produce a utility bill that they have now taken out in their name.
[00:50:02.368 --> 00:50:07.191]  The police say, well, they've got documentation here, and he says, but there's no lease!
[00:50:08.252 --> 00:50:11.154]  They said, well, we're on a month-to-month basis and we're paying cash.
[00:50:11.835 --> 00:50:12.776]  Totally lying, of course.
[00:50:13.735 --> 00:50:22.278]  But because there is a dispute, because they do have some paperwork showing their name at that address, the police say, we can't do anything about this.
[00:50:23.258 --> 00:50:25.398]  This is now a dispute between two parties.
[00:50:25.438 --> 00:50:26.899]  That's not what the police do.
[00:50:26.939 --> 00:50:30.380]  You're going to have to take this into the courts and resolve this in a civil manner.
[00:50:31.846 --> 00:50:33.107]  So, they turn him away.
[00:50:33.588 --> 00:50:35.910]  He goes in the very next day, he's got all of his paperwork together.
[00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:40.494]  He gets an eviction notice, 24 hours notice of inspection, so forth.
[00:50:40.535 --> 00:50:41.095]  He shows up.
[00:50:41.215 --> 00:50:42.957]  Now the house is fortified.
[00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:44.618]  They've changed the locks.
[00:50:45.299 --> 00:50:49.163]  They have put boards over the windows and reinforced them from the inside.
[00:50:49.423 --> 00:50:51.725]  And they refuse to accept any of this paperwork.
[00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:57.027]  Frustrated as you or I would typically be, most of us would be in this situation, he breaks in.
[00:50:57.668 --> 00:51:04.094]  He notices that virtually all of his possessions are now gone and there's just these Middle Eastern people there.
[00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:08.098]  Harsh words began and violence ensues.
[00:51:08.138 --> 00:51:10.280]  The police are called again and he is arrested.
[00:51:11.215 --> 00:51:16.238]  Charged criminally with breaking and entering into his own home and other issues.
[00:51:16.939 --> 00:51:17.960]  Now, how did this happen?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.142]  This is called adverse possession.
[00:51:21.622 --> 00:51:23.603]  And it's a large category, these types of things.
[00:51:23.623 --> 00:51:26.465]  But squatting is something that's been done quite some time.
[00:51:26.485 --> 00:51:31.309]  It's now going to take him, at the very least, just to get them out of his home, 90 to 120 days to evict them.
[00:51:34.209 --> 00:51:37.553]  But you have to understand just how easy this is to do.
[00:51:37.933 --> 00:51:43.579]  And as my friend, his employer, went down to bail him out and talked to the police chief, the police chief was very sympathetic.
[00:51:43.619 --> 00:51:48.545]  He knew this really had happened, but there really wasn't anything he could do in order to take sides with this.
[00:51:48.565 --> 00:51:51.848]  They told him this is something that's happening increasingly.
[00:51:51.888 --> 00:51:54.191]  This is here in Texas, in a small town.
[00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:54.971]  It's not a big town.
[00:51:56.267 --> 00:51:59.408]  And my friend asked him, is this CARE?
[00:51:59.568 --> 00:52:00.608]  Is this La Raza?
[00:52:00.688 --> 00:52:02.749]  Is this, you know, MS-13?
[00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:03.089]  What is it?
[00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:06.010]  He goes, I can't really say anything except that we're investigating it.
[00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:14.973]  You have to understand that when we talk about undocumented immigrants, we're talking about people who are foreign citizens who come here and criminally trespass, aren't we?
[00:52:15.433 --> 00:52:16.253]  That's the essence of it.
[00:52:16.793 --> 00:52:18.414]  They're not just illegal aliens.
[00:52:19.214 --> 00:52:23.835]  They are citizens of a foreign country coming here and criminally trespassing on our country.
[00:52:24.216 --> 00:52:25.196]  They know how to play the game.
[00:52:25.856 --> 00:52:31.420]  They know how to get through the paperwork and now they have discovered this scam as well.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.603]  And you need to understand that it's going to be very difficult to protect yourself.
[00:52:35.663 --> 00:52:42.127]  I mean we need to have some laws that require utility companies to vet the people who are putting utilities in the name.
[00:52:42.147 --> 00:52:46.130]  That would be the simplest thing to do if we could get the legislatures to step up and do that.
[00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.673]  Perhaps you can go to your utility companies and leave orders with them.
[00:52:50.713 --> 00:52:53.675]  I don't know if they would pay any attention to you if you tell them I don't want
[00:52:54.315 --> 00:53:05.142]  Utilities taken out of my name and put into anybody else's name unless you see documents that prove that they have a lease or a deed that shows that they are the rightful owners of this?
[00:53:05.162 --> 00:53:07.504]  I mean, how do you protect yourself against that, really?
[00:53:08.442 --> 00:53:15.746]  You have a situation where if these people are really wise about this, they can wait, and they can stalk your house, and they can wait until you leave.
[00:53:15.766 --> 00:53:17.187]  You don't have to take a vacation, even.
[00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:18.888]  You don't have to be gone for a very long period of time.
[00:53:19.308 --> 00:53:33.096]  They could stalk your house, they could go down, they could change their names on the utility, put their name on the utility bills, and then wait until you're gone, and then barricade themselves in the house, and when the police arrive, same situation as it was with my friend's employee.
[00:53:33.973 --> 00:53:35.854]  See, that's the vulnerability that we all face.
[00:53:36.734 --> 00:53:38.694]  It is something that is very disturbing.
[00:53:39.295 --> 00:53:43.956]  But, you know, when we look at this situation, and again, it doesn't have to be an illegal immigrant to do this.
[00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:45.917]  Any crook can do this to you.
[00:53:45.977 --> 00:53:53.039]  We need to make some changes to the laws, but understand that it is not just this type of theft of your home that we have to be concerned about.
[00:53:54.059 --> 00:53:56.380]  The story that was on the Drudge Report a couple of days ago from Lifeset.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.961]  Talking about the fact that 23% of public school children live in immigrant households.
[00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:08.442]  In other words, one or more people in that household is an illegal immigrant.
[00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:09.463]  23% of public school students.
[00:54:09.903 --> 00:54:10.963]  So what is happening here?
[00:54:11.103 --> 00:54:14.864]  And I've said this before and we need to get an understanding of what is going on.
[00:54:15.204 --> 00:54:20.245]  You understand that one of the largest expenses for your home is your property taxes.
[00:54:20.325 --> 00:54:20.686]  We're good to go.
[00:54:36.411 --> 00:54:58.501]  And so when you have a situation where you see 23% of the children are citizens of a foreign country that don't want to pay to educate their children, instead, like the Mexican government, they work with all 50 of their consulates throughout the United States to help their citizens remain here and get services like education at our expense, which goes on our property tax bill.
[00:54:59.241 --> 00:55:01.542]  Can you stand that kind of increase?
[00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:08.726]  As they point out in the study from Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, they say that this is more than doubled from 1990.
[00:55:08.826 --> 00:55:09.466]  It is up 7% from just 7% in 1980.
[00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:09.986]  So it was 7% in 1980.
[00:55:10.466 --> 00:55:13.568]  So it is more than tripled since 1980 and it has doubled since 1990.
[00:55:23.331 --> 00:55:26.074]  That, mostly, is going to show up in your tax bill.
[00:55:26.775 --> 00:55:29.217]  Can you stand that kind of increase?
[00:55:29.237 --> 00:55:29.938]  What is it going to do?
[00:55:29.978 --> 00:55:31.940]  It's going to put homeownership out of the reach of most people.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.041]  That was the American dream.
[00:55:33.061 --> 00:55:39.988]  That's going to be a sacrifice for dreamers who are coming here for free education at your expense because their government refuses to pay for it.
[00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:43.651]  And then, of course, what is going to happen
[00:55:44.787 --> 00:55:53.330]  Is that even if you're not going to have a house, even if you're in an apartment because you can't afford a house any longer, your apartment is going to shrink.
[00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:59.972]  What you can afford in an apartment is going to shrink because the property taxes will be reflected in your rentals.
[00:56:00.312 --> 00:56:03.693]  Even though they're not going to be itemized, it will be part of the rent that you pay.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.002]  So the American dream is shrinking or it is disappearing.
[00:56:08.322 --> 00:56:08.562]  Why?
[00:56:08.802 --> 00:56:20.089]  Because we've decided that we're going to provide Cadillac educations for anyone who comes here who chooses to be educated in the language of their choice and their country does not want to pay for their education.
[00:56:20.769 --> 00:56:22.530]  So I just wanted to give you this story.
[00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:28.314]  This is something that has happened before but it is increasing in terms of its frequency.
[00:56:28.374 --> 00:56:42.884]  There's evidence that this may be something that is now being organized very carefully by immigrant groups and so you're probably going to see a lot more of this from these so-called undocumented immigrants who are actually foreign citizens criminally trespassing.
[00:56:42.944 --> 00:56:45.306]  Now they may be criminally trespassing on your home.
[00:56:45.606 --> 00:56:46.226]  You've been warned.
[00:56:46.586 --> 00:56:48.528]  Take the appropriate steps to try to protect yourself.
[00:56:48.788 --> 00:56:50.369]  Try to get legislation enacted.
[00:56:50.969 --> 00:56:52.310]  To keep this from happening.
[00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:52.991]  It's very easy.
[00:56:53.031 --> 00:56:59.015]  I've never every place that I have lived I've never had to prove anything when I put utilities in my name.
[00:56:59.535 --> 00:57:02.537]  Let's consider what's happening to your home at the federal level.
[00:57:02.937 --> 00:57:09.902]  Take a look at the budget cuts that Donald Trump has proposed and pronounced by many in the GOP establishment as dead on arrival.
[00:57:09.942 --> 00:57:14.785]  What he's trying to do is eliminate some of the wasteful spending of the Department of Education.
[00:57:14.825 --> 00:57:20.129]  But understand that as we look at this, 23% of public school students are immigrants.
[00:57:20.989 --> 00:57:24.072]  That reflects itself, as I said, in your property taxes.
[00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:27.754]  You have to build more schools, you have to hire more teachers, you have to hire translators.
[00:57:28.395 --> 00:57:37.142]  If the federal government would do its job at the border and keep this from happening, rather than having a deferred action on childhood arrivals,
[00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:41.404]  That is basically anchor babies for kids that aren't babies.
[00:57:41.904 --> 00:57:48.467]  That's anchors up to the age that they let them come in, which extends, they can't take them out until the age of 31.
[00:57:48.867 --> 00:57:56.591]  I think they have to come in at the age of 17 or earlier in order to be eligible for that program, but they can then remain on that program up to the age of 31.
[00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:58.552]  We cannot afford this.
[00:57:59.252 --> 00:58:01.815]  And so the federal government has created this problem.
[00:58:02.296 --> 00:58:04.678]  The federal government is not doing anything about the borders.
[00:58:05.159 --> 00:58:12.247]  What they could do is to shut down some of these expensive programs that the Department of Education is doing because it's not a federal function.
[00:58:12.808 --> 00:58:15.030]  The federal government should not be involved in education.
[00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:17.133]  The federal government should be involved in borders.
[00:58:17.173 --> 00:58:18.935]  And that's why we're seeing this explosion.
[00:58:19.235 --> 00:58:30.383]  So from the federal government down to the state governments, which have the task of education and have the task of protecting your home, we need to get the government to do its proper job.
[00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:35.547]  They're distracted on too many other side issues to even protect your home in a reasonable way.
[00:58:36.087 --> 00:58:42.032]  As I pointed out, make sure somebody doesn't put the utilities in their name for your home and just take ownership of it.
[00:58:42.975 --> 00:58:44.457]  Absolutely amazing that that can happen.
[00:58:44.618 --> 00:58:45.599]  Be aware that it can.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.502]  That's all we have for tonight's news.
