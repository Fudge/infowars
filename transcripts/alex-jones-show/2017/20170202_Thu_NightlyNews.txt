[00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:20.909]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.592]  It's Thursday, February 2nd, 2017.
[00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:25.156]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:37.121]  We look at the Berkeley Riot, a desperate attempt by so-called progressives to shut down political ideas they can't defeat with argument.
[00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:50.275]  And as the left steps up riots in response to elections, and violence in response to speech, a film director once again signals his approval, while Robert Reich from the Clinton administration publishes a 100-day plan of resistance.
[00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:04.707]  Our 100 days of resistance can set the tone for a sustained level of engagement over the next four years.
[00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:09.529]  There should be sister marches around the country, and then monthly marches against hate.
[00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.890]  Boycott all Trump products.
[00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.952]  Make your city and state sanctuaries that won't cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
[00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:19.993]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:10.014]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the anti-Trump protests continue to get more violent and more violent as they go on.
[00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:21.425]  And for some reason, the leftist media, the liberal media, liberal Hollywood, liberal professors don't seem to want to denounce this type of behavior.
[00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:23.247]  No, in fact, quite the opposite.
[00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.169]  They are even promoting it.
[00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:32.112]  Now, a guy that I found today is actually employed at the University of California, Berkeley.
[00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:48.579]  His name is Robert Reich, and this is a man who has little man syndrome, and he's decided that he is going to resist Donald Trump, and he's going to use whatever bully pulpit he has to try to promote the resistance of Donald Trump.
[00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.415]  And what he's tried to do here is he's trying to pull the Keith Olbermann and be Alex Jones of the left.
[00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:58.097]  Started his own little YouTube videos he's doing.
[00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:02.000]  He's got his, you know, special reports on how they can resist Donald Trump.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.121]  Sorry, buddy.
[00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:05.102]  You're a little late to the party.
[00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:06.463]  Yeah, you can see his little drawings.
[00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.445]  He likes to make little, he makes little drawings.
[00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:08.865]  That's cute.
[00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:12.308]  You know, his little drawings, you know, little man syndrome trying to resist Donald Trump.
[00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:17.052]  But let's go ahead and run through some of these highlights because here's the deal, folks.
[00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:23.322]  The people who are inciting this, antagonizing this, are the ones that need to be held accountable.
[00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:38.135]  And if they're not going to look in the mirror and realize they're partly responsible for this activity going on, like what we saw at the Berkeley protest last night, well then we're going to have to hold their feet to the fire, and we're going to have to push for accountability.
[00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:42.379]  And I don't know what degrees we'll have to go through, what measures we'll have to take,
[00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.940]  But shedding light on the people who are promoting this is the first step.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.481]  So let's go to some of these highlights from some of the videos you can see from Robert Reich.
[00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:53.562]  March and demonstrate.
[00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:57.463]  The Women's March on Washington will be the day after the inauguration.
[00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:02.444]  There should be sister marches around the country and then monthly marches against hate.
[00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:05.985]  Keep the momentum alive and keep the message going.
[00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.822]  So there he is, right there, promoting the marches, promoting the protests, which is fine!
[00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:12.383]  We're all about free speech.
[00:05:12.423 --> 00:05:13.523]  We've had our own protests.
[00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:16.884]  We're all about getting out there, getting on the street, executing your First Amendment right.
[00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:22.526]  But, if you look at the anti-Trump protest, it's turned violent every time.
[00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:24.587]  And it's only getting more violent.
[00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:31.709]  So again, when will the people promoting these marches look in the mirror, or at least denounce all the violent activity that we're seeing?
[00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:33.330]  Robert Reich certainly hasn't yet.
[00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.410]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:36.697]  See, I love this.
[00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:38.497]  Now he's openly promoting breaking the law.
[00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:38.998]  And guess what?
[00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:41.878]  The beauty of this is, as soon as Donald Trump cuts federal funding to those sanctuary cities,
[00:06:00.848 --> 00:06:01.991]  Good luck!
[00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:09.429]  And we'll have more on that about federal funding and how we can use that or cutting federal funds to stymie the Trump protests.
[00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.311]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:12.805]  There's this cute little drawing.
[00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:16.569]  Yeah, the problem with that, Reich, is that we've talked to the Trump protesters on the street.
[00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.151]  You think that they're going to be able to form thoughts?
[00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:35.025]  In clear, coherent consciousness and put it down onto paper?
[00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.667]  They can't even answer a simple question when you put a camera in front of their face!
[00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.629]  They're holding up a sign and you ask them about their sign, they don't even know what's going on!
[00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:45.630]  It's amazing!
[00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:59.797]  So, if you really think that the people that you're sending out there to protest Donald Trump are intelligent enough or quick-witted enough to actually put forth coherent thoughts onto paper and send that out to news organizations or politicians,
[00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:06.250]  Well, unfortunately, you are terribly, terribly confused at where the intelligence lies in this.
[00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.310]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:10.833]  Contribute to the most effective opposition groups.
[00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:11.474]  Oh, like George Soros.
[00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:17.219]  The American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Economic Policy Institute.
[00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:19.461]  I think someone from the ACLU actually just got arrested.
[00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.001]  And others.
[00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.662]  Oh, and look at that, and he plugs himself.
[00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:22.583]  Here's the funny thing.
[00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:23.744]  He says, give us money.
[00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:24.425]  Give us money.
[00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:26.987]  Give money to people who are protesting Donald Trump.
[00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:28.068]  But wait a second.
[00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:30.119]  What do you get for it?
[00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:32.140]  See, we plug products here.
[00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.603]  If you support us, we provide a product.
[00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:41.448]  If you support us, you get a great product, a great t-shirt, a great water filter.
[00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:46.753]  Robert Reich just wants you to give him money so he can keep speaking out against Trump.
[00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:49.362]  Go ahead, give Robert Wright money.
[00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:50.964]  See if you get anything out of it.
[00:07:51.564 --> 00:07:55.748]  So, if you want to flush your money down the toilet, you might as well give it to Robert Wright.
[00:07:55.928 --> 00:07:56.388]  But you know what?
[00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:58.590]  He'll give you a nice video which gives us content.
[00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.731]  So let's roll to the next one.
[00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:05.536]  Reach out to independents and even Trump supporters who agree with this agenda and get them involved.
[00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:09.600]  Now this just shows how out of touch with reality this man actually is.
[00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:14.512]  You're trying to incite Trump protests.
[00:08:15.073 --> 00:08:17.637]  You think Trump supporters are going to come onto your side?
[00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:22.642]  Folks, this guy literally is living in la-la land.
[00:08:23.543 --> 00:08:27.704]  And this is an illustration of the minions who are out there protesting.
[00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:30.505]  They don't live in reality, folks.
[00:08:30.645 --> 00:08:31.565]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:35.307]  The first 100 days resistance agenda.
[00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:36.207]  An hour a day.
[00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:40.468]  Let's set the tone for a new, more engaged America.
[00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:44.510]  And send a powerful message that we are not going away.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.925]  So there he is saying, we're not going away, we're going to keep protesting no matter how many buildings we smash and loot and burn down.
[00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.028]  But the funny thing is, again, they're missing it.
[00:08:55.688 --> 00:08:57.930]  The Trump movement is the resistance movement.
[00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.972]  The Trump movement is the revolution.
[00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:01.373]  You're behind the times.
[00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:02.754]  You're on the wrong side of history.
[00:09:02.894 --> 00:09:03.735]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:12.703]  Historically, tyrants have tried to control the press using four techniques that, worryingly, Donald Trump is already using.
[00:09:13.663 --> 00:09:16.786]  Number one, berate the media and turn the public against it.
[00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:20.530]  See, again, you don't understand here, Reich.
[00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.413]  The public was already against the media.
[00:09:23.974 --> 00:09:26.857]  The media was already corrupted by tyrants.
[00:09:27.397 --> 00:09:28.999]  You're behind the times, bro!
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:36.067]  Okay, maybe your necktie is a little too tight and you're not getting blood flow to that little brain, alright?
[00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:41.016]  So, again, you are living in denial of reality.
[00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:44.017]  The reason Trump was elected is because we already don't trust the media.
[00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:46.718]  Not vice versa.
[00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:48.019]  Understand that.
[00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:48.739]  Roll to the next one.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.021]  When he lies, claiming, for example, massive voter fraud in the election.
[00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:54.902]  He lies about that.
[00:09:54.922 --> 00:09:55.582]  He knows it's proven.
[00:09:55.882 --> 00:09:57.843]  And the media call him on those lies.
[00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:00.184]  He says the media is lying.
[00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:06.779]  Okay, so let's go ahead and let's find out when more investigations come out what the truth is about voter fraud.
[00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:07.999]  You're going to look like an absolute fool.
[00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:18.822]  This guy, I'm serious folks, this guy is a complete looney tune and he reminds me of the character of David Nelson on South Park that Eric Cartman, a midget that Eric Cartman wrestles in the dirt.
[00:10:18.982 --> 00:10:20.403]  I'm just saying, that's who he reminds me of.
[00:10:20.423 --> 00:10:21.003]  Roll to the next one.
[00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:26.445]  Even televised satires he labels unfunny, one-sided, and pathetic.
[00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:29.746]  Donald Trump says it like it is and I kind of like that.
[00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:30.406]  Roll to the next one.
[00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:40.274]  During the campaign, Trump threatened to sue the New York Times for libel in response to an article about two women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately years ago.
[00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:50.522]  He says he plans to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.
[00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:52.384]  He's upset about this!
[00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.066]  This upsets Robert Reich!
[00:10:55.987 --> 00:10:59.352]  Well, how dare he want to sue people that lie about him?
[00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:02.097]  How dare he want to sue people that commit libel against him?
[00:11:02.758 --> 00:11:03.719]  Okay, Robert, you know what?
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.106]  How about I write a story about making up things about you?
[00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:09.408]  How would you like that?
[00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:12.310]  Oh, you'd want to sue me for libel, wouldn't you?
[00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:22.653]  If I came on air and I said that Robert Reich is actually a woman dressing as a man, I think that you would probably want to sue me for libel or slander or something like that.
[00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:25.174]  So, again, this doesn't even make sense.
[00:11:25.214 --> 00:11:30.476]  Donald Trump is saying, if people lie about you, if people commit libel against you, you know what?
[00:11:30.536 --> 00:11:35.278]  We're going to start suing these people because we're seeing what the media has done to agitate
[00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:37.139]  Conquer and divide this country.
[00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:51.166]  The media has been the biggest enemy of the Republic and now we know it and Donald Trump wants to stop the lying fake news media from committing acts of libel against him, against myself, against you, against everybody, but Robert Reich doesn't understand that because he's part of the liberal media.
[00:11:51.346 --> 00:11:52.147]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:54.248]  See, they've had a monopoly on media.
[00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:55.528]  They've had a control over media.
[00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.790]  Donald Trump, pun intended, has trumped that control and goes right to the people.
[00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.730]  And this infuriates the left!
[00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:19.300]  They want to filter the news coverage so that they can pander to their agenda.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.821]  Sorry, Trump is beating you again.
[00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:22.981]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:32.705]  Steve Bannon, remember, is or was the publisher of Breitbart News, that alt-right white supremacist.
[00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:35.727]  Foul.
[00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:38.226]  So mad, he's so mad!
[00:12:38.606 --> 00:12:38.967]  Boom!
[00:12:49.673 --> 00:12:51.874]  This guy is like an angry hobbit.
[00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:59.978]  And again, he doesn't cite any instance of Breitbart or Steve Bannon doing anything racist or anything white supremacist.
[00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.659]  This is a total false narrative.
[00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:04.661]  This is what's fomenting the violence and the protests in the streets.
[00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:07.982]  This is why people like Robert Reich need to be held accountable.
[00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:09.003]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:13:10.704 --> 00:13:15.046]  The silver lining here, to the extent that there is a silver lining, and I want to end these
[00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:20.504]  little bit positive and there is something positive here you see so many americans particularly after seeing
[00:13:29.565 --> 00:13:38.891]  Eight or nine days of Trump's unhinged behavior, seeing the danger that he is posing to our democracy.
[00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:43.995]  Even if they are Republicans, these Americans are beginning to wake up.
[00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:45.416]  They're waking up to the danger.
[00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:47.097]  They are beginning to get involved.
[00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:55.763]  People who have not been involved in politics, who have not understood that part of citizenship is activism, are becoming activated.
[00:13:56.812 --> 00:14:00.255]  And that's why we elected Donald Trump.
[00:14:00.736 --> 00:14:01.797]  You still don't get it.
[00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:02.918]  Roll to the next one.
[00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:23.265]  That is total, total confirmation bias.
[00:14:23.745 --> 00:14:27.149]  They're reassuring themselves that they have numbers by going out and protesting.
[00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:30.373]  It's just creating their own little fake realities.
[00:14:30.413 --> 00:14:31.054]  Roll the next one.
[00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:35.419]  By a man who looks and acts more and more unhinged every day.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.681]  No, that's you.
[00:14:36.721 --> 00:14:37.302]  That's the left.
[00:14:38.427 --> 00:14:39.068]  Now I love this.
[00:14:39.088 --> 00:14:40.829]  You gotta make sure he is impeached.
[00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:44.792]  So he's up here talking about, now, watch this, he's gonna mock Donald Trump here.
[00:14:44.812 --> 00:14:46.333]  Look at this, he's doing the Trump hand!
[00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:49.635]  Even he likes Donald Trump, he can't even, look at this.
[00:14:50.136 --> 00:14:52.477]  Mockery is the greatest form of flattery.
[00:14:52.497 --> 00:14:55.079]  He's doing the Donald Trump hand, folks.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.961]  Okay, he's doing the Trump hand.
[00:14:57.361 --> 00:15:01.024]  Even the people that hate Trump can't help but mock Trump because they're flattered by him.
[00:15:01.184 --> 00:15:01.884]  Roll to the next one.
[00:15:03.145 --> 00:15:03.906]  So keep at it.
[00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:05.027]  Keep at it.
[00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:07.136]  Keep rioting.
[00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:08.537]  Keep getting involved.
[00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.077]  Keep looting and rioting and burning.
[00:15:10.178 --> 00:15:17.901]  Keep showing Donald Trump and showing the world that we are not sitting back in this country letting this happen.
[00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:19.561]  So there you go.
[00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:20.602]  Keep resisting.
[00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:21.604]  There you go, folks.
[00:15:21.644 --> 00:15:22.185]  Keep resisting.
[00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:24.145]  He's out here encouraging more violent protests.
[00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:25.926]  Now, here's the thing about this guy.
[00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:32.429]  He says he knew Hillary Clinton since he was 19 years old, but he believed that Bernie Sanders was the most qualified to be president.
[00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.231]  He said that Clinton was the most qualified in the current political system, a.k.a.
[00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:41.133]  the corrupt political system, but Bernie was the most qualified in the system we should have, a.k.a.
[00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:41.894]  socialist.
[00:15:42.034 --> 00:15:43.675]  So, he admits he's a socialist.
[00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:46.436]  Now, here's why we get violent protests.
[00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:51.138]  Nancy Pelosi calls Steve Bannon a white supremacist, just like Robert Reich just did.
[00:15:51.398 --> 00:15:53.960]  Now, Nancy Pelosi might be completely senile.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.841]  And this is what Pelosi said during a press briefing.
[00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:57.502]  Again, false narrative.
[00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:11.570]  Fomenting people to be upset and riot and loot.
[00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:15.152]  Now they keep using this phrase, white nationalism, too.
[00:16:15.452 --> 00:16:19.754]  They're gonna try to insert white nationalism to try to use that as white supremacy.
[00:16:19.794 --> 00:16:22.396]  Kind of just flip-flopping white nationalism, white supremacy.
[00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:24.136]  It's really the same thing that they're trying to say.
[00:16:24.557 --> 00:16:26.097]  But this is what's fomenting the violence.
[00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:26.638]  And look at this!
[00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.478]  More evidence of paid protest.
[00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:35.382]  The CEO of Lux Valet will provide paid leave to people who want to go protest President Trump.
[00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.885]  So now you have companies that are out here enabling the violent protest.
[00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:47.592]  In an email, he sent out how upset he is over Donald Trump and how he's going to organize and pay his employees to go protest Donald Trump.
[00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.954]  Now, let's get back to California Berkeley for a second here.
[00:16:49.994 --> 00:16:51.375]  You know who is a student there?
[00:16:51.935 --> 00:16:54.657]  Alex Soros, the son of George Soros.
[00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:56.379]  Do you think that is a coincidence?
[00:16:56.939 --> 00:16:57.620]  I do not.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.643]  Now what's also disturbing about this, here's a story out of CNN.
[00:17:00.963 --> 00:17:07.909]  The university blames 150 masked agitators for the unrest, but apparently there was only one arrest!
[00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:10.070]  How is that possible?
[00:17:11.104 --> 00:17:16.749]  Here's what I think, I think they need to send Milo out as bait, have cops, you know, FBI, DHS ready.
[00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:22.994]  They send Milo in, as soon as you see people start protesting and rioting, mainly just the violent rioters, you go ahead and arrest them.
[00:17:23.314 --> 00:17:29.580]  But here's the thing, all these people protesting Milo, why can't we label them as homophobic anti-Semites?
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:39.209]  Milo's a homosexual Jewish person, so all the protesters that are protesting him must be homophobic anti-semites that don't believe in free speech.
[00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:45.514]  And now Trump is saying that he might cut federal funding to UC Berkeley, which I think is a great idea.
[00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:49.437]  Now USA Today says it's not likely.
[00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:55.079]  So you know what, Donald Trump, why don't you just go ahead and bitch slap USA Today right across the face.
[00:17:55.359 --> 00:18:03.943]  Go ahead and cut that federal funding from UC Berkeley, which by the way is almost $400 million is the numbers that I'm hearing.
[00:18:04.003 --> 00:18:06.785]  So we'll continue to see what those exact numbers are.
[00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:09.926]  But you cut that funding, you cut the Sanctuary City funding,
[00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:12.408]  You eliminate a lot of these problems immediately.
[00:18:12.468 --> 00:18:14.450]  I think Donald Trump is going to do it.
[00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.233]  And the amazing thing, Hollywood Director tweets threat to Trump supporters after Berkeley riots.
[00:18:18.253 --> 00:18:20.135]  So they're out here saying, this is your fault.
[00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:21.176]  Do you realize what you're doing?
[00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:22.036]  This is only the beginning.
[00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:24.238]  Do you really want a civil war?
[00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:27.641]  Have you seen the people out in the streets protesting Donald Trump?
[00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:31.965]  They are the weakest, most chicken-necked Nellies I've ever seen in my life.
[00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:34.107]  I could take out a whole block of them.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.600]  It's a joke.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.861]  Now here's the embarrassing thing.
[00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:43.806]  George Soros tweets out a picture of Martin Luther King saying that the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:47.129]  reminds us that in open society we must always strive for racial equality.
[00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:55.775]  No, Martin Luther King wanted people to not be seen for their race anymore and he marched to prove a point because when he marched he got attacked.
[00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.337]  Now that happens to Trump supporters.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.

[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart

[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:10.901]  Milo Yiannopoulos, the campus of UC Berkeley, and the First Amendment were under siege.
[00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:26.392]  Progressive left, the social justice left, the feminist Black Lives Matter, Antifa left, the hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years, is taking a turn post-Trump's election where they simply will not allow any speaker on campus
[00:23:26.832 --> 00:23:32.414]  Even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard.
[00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:35.395]  They won't allow students to listen to differing points of view.
[00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:36.715]  They're absolutely petrified.
[00:23:36.755 --> 00:23:40.096]  Wednesday night, a protest against the scheduled 8 p.m.
[00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:51.080]  speech of libertarian gay activist and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos turned violent, spiraling into a shelter-in-place order by campus officials.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.981]  UC Berkeley released this statement regarding the events.
[00:23:55.241 --> 00:24:05.163]  The violence was instigated by a group of about 150 masked agitators who came onto campus and interrupted an otherwise non-violent protest.
[00:24:05.263 --> 00:24:09.104]  The decision to cancel the event was made at about 6 p.m.
[00:24:09.244 --> 00:24:17.246]  and officers read several dispersal announcements to a crowd of more than 1,500 protesters who had gathered outside the student union.
[00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:17.987]  We're good.
[00:24:32.483 --> 00:24:42.069]  Commercial-grade fireworks were thrown at police officers, barricades pushed into windows, and skirmishes within the crowd were among the evening's violent acts.
[00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:53.976]  The masked agitators came to campus, eastbound on Bancroft Way, and fire damage and other destruction to the Stiles Hall construction site, where a new residence hall, as planned, was reported.
[00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:58.819]  The group entered campus and immediately began throwing rocks at officers.
[00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:09.623]  In an effort to avoid injuries to innocent members of the surrounding crowd who might have been caught in the middle, police officers exercised restraint and did not respond with force.
[00:25:10.123 --> 00:25:14.644]  Agitators also attacked some members of the crowd who were rescued by police.
[00:25:15.004 --> 00:25:19.646]  UCPD reported no major injuries and about a half dozen minor injuries.
[00:25:20.046 --> 00:25:29.909]  President Trump immediately denounced the attack in a tweet that read, Of course, Hollywood stuck its seditious nose into the events with director Judd Apatow threatening, Apatow then walked his statement back after being duly criticized.
[00:25:49.895 --> 00:25:59.877]  Even though it's blatantly obvious that the scourge of Antifa anarchists was responsible, the millennial generation seems to be losing its grasp of our republic.
[00:25:59.937 --> 00:26:14.640]  The Daily Wire reports, a survey conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which partnered with YouGov, found that 45% of millennials said they would vote for a socialist, and 21% said they would vote for a communist.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.340]  Additionally,
[00:26:16.321 --> 00:26:20.906]  53% of millennials said that America's capitalist system works against me.
[00:26:21.186 --> 00:26:34.920]  About one-third, 32%, think that Bush is responsible for the deaths of more people than Stalin, while only 25% of all respondents knew that communism is responsible for the slaughter of over 100 million people.
[00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:45.806]  The fog is lifting on the blatant truth that mainstream media, Hollywood, and cognitive dissonance have poisoned the minds of an entire American generation.
[00:26:46.006 --> 00:26:49.487]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.392]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:24.499]  A new show called Santa Clarita Diet starring Drew Barrymore is set to air its first episode coming up February 3rd.
[00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:36.048]  What's really disgusting and bizarre about this new series that Netflix is going to be airing is that it features Drew Barrymore playing a suburban housewife that becomes a cannibal.
[00:27:36.568 --> 00:27:37.568]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:38.709]  She eats people.
[00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:56.033]  And this kind of harkens back to during campaign season when John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, was, you know, caught having email communications with a woman named Maria Abramovic regarding a spirit cooking ritual.
[00:27:56.373 --> 00:28:04.855]  Well, these spirit cooking rituals are really bizarre indeed and do a lot with blood and weird bodily fluids in satanic rituals.
[00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:14.499]  So, this is just really bizarre that we see Hollywood now coming out with this TV series that's trying to normalize cannibalism.
[00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:25.784]  Not only is it trying to normalize eating another human being, it is also trying to normalize and justify attacks against people that the left deem as Nazis.
[00:28:26.424 --> 00:28:27.965]  We have to kill someone who deserves it.
[00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:30.986]  I guess the prototype would be a young, single Hitler.
[00:28:31.726 --> 00:28:33.147]  God, we'd be heroes!
[00:28:34.434 --> 00:28:40.159]  Well, we've seen the left like to point the finger at anyone that they disagree with as being a Nazi.
[00:28:40.639 --> 00:28:44.543]  And predominantly the people they tend to disagree with are Donald Trump supporters.
[00:28:44.983 --> 00:28:51.168]  It's important to note that the Republican Party does come into effect here because
[00:28:51.889 --> 00:28:56.613]  Santa Clarita is an actual town in California that's a Republican hub.
[00:28:57.053 --> 00:29:05.239]  Even though most of California is a Democratic state, there are some small Republican hubs, and Santa Clarita is one of them.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:14.222]  Is this another way to try and justify attacks and killing of people that the left deems as Nazis?
[00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:24.084]  Because we've seen them just point out anybody to be a Nazi that disagrees with them and how they've been calling Trump supporters, Trump supporters, Nazis.
[00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:47.431]  Are they trying to desensitize attacks against conservatives and are they also trying to desensitize people to their bizarre occult rituals?
[00:29:47.811 --> 00:29:55.155]  What's important to note is that Drew Barrymore is wearing a red dress while she's talking about her new diet of cannibalism and
[00:29:56.155 --> 00:30:01.039]  Maria Abravovic also wore a red dress in some of her rituals.
[00:30:01.459 --> 00:30:04.262]  So, why are they wearing these red dresses?
[00:30:04.482 --> 00:30:13.529]  Well, if you do some research, you'll find out that the religion that they're practicing is some of Alistair Crowley's O.T.O.
[00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.252]  And in it, they like to practice the Lama.
[00:30:17.853 --> 00:30:18.753]  And the Lama
[00:30:19.854 --> 00:30:33.303]  is basically where they kinda they worship the Scarlet Woman Goddess and so this could be why they're wearing a red dress because it harkens to the blood rituals and things that they engage in.
[00:30:33.323 --> 00:30:37.105]  Now I found this interesting website here called Cannibal Club.
[00:30:37.706 --> 00:30:38.867]  This is their home page.
[00:30:38.927 --> 00:30:45.591]  It says, specializing in the preparation of human meat, Cannibal Club brings the cutting edge
[00:30:45.951 --> 00:30:49.992]  Who knows if this is actually a legitimate website, but the fact of the matter is
[00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:22.165]  People are out there engaging in these bizarre practices and so it's just really creepy when we see something like this being pushed into the mainstream to get people to accept it.
[00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.226]  This is the fringe.
[00:31:23.386 --> 00:31:29.630]  They're trying to make the fringe weird behaviors mainstream and to desensitize people.
[00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:33.033]  This is Millie Weaver signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:43.905 --> 00:31:47.387]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:31:47.467 --> 00:31:50.848]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:55.731]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.532]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:31:58.772 --> 00:32:04.715]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:08.498]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:08.938 --> 00:32:11.520]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:20.146]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:32:21.187 --> 00:32:29.931]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:35.174]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:35.674 --> 00:32:39.276]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:41.477]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:41.557 --> 00:32:42.537]  Is it one world?
[00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:43.978]  The Central Bank is in charge.
[00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:46.419]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:47.880]  InfoWars.com
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.438]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.861]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.881 --> 00:36:50.861]  $200.
[00:36:51.461 --> 00:36:54.404]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.484 --> 00:36:55.185]  It's amazing.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:15.626]  Because what the IRS has been doing for 50, 60 years is intimidating people without the authority to do so, that they cannot exercise political speech from the pulpit.
[00:37:16.226 --> 00:37:25.051]  Isn't it amazing that at the same time they're allowed to do this, we see the left out there also now violently intimidating free speech.
[00:37:25.071 --> 00:37:30.554]  We saw that woman who got pepper sprayed in the face as she was talking to a television station.
[00:37:30.714 --> 00:37:35.160]  She was saying at the time, you know, I want to give these people a chance to have their say and so forth.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.123]  And then they just walk up and say, no, no, that's not the kind of people we are.
[00:37:38.784 --> 00:37:43.590]  We're the kind of people, when you show up with your signs to try to convince people to try to educate them.
[00:37:44.588 --> 00:37:48.412]  We show up with signs that are black to put them in front of your signs.
[00:37:48.452 --> 00:37:53.818]  That's what they did when we went to the abortion protests that were going on at the local clinic here in Austin.
[00:37:54.499 --> 00:37:55.760]  Or they get violent with people.
[00:37:55.801 --> 00:38:01.847]  See, the First Amendment doesn't allow you, as we've all heard, doesn't allow you to yell fire in a crowded theater.
[00:38:02.248 --> 00:38:05.571]  It also doesn't allow you to set fire to the theater.
[00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:10.499]  Violence and rioting are not First Amendment speech.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.441]  But they want to say that it is.
[00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:13.962]  So we have a struggle going on today.
[00:38:14.202 --> 00:38:15.163]  We're going to talk about this.
[00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:16.564]  This is all in the news today.
[00:38:16.604 --> 00:38:19.146]  What happened in Berkeley with the riots.
[00:38:19.886 --> 00:38:22.709]  The difference between riots and demonstrations.
[00:38:22.729 --> 00:38:26.472]  The difference between free speech and censorship that we see at the universities.
[00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:34.518]  And also we're going to take a look at religious freedom because this is going to be at the center of the Supreme Court pick that Donald Trump has picked.
[00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:48.214]  And of course, as we see Neil Gorsuch coming through, one of the things that they're all talking about in terms of opposing him is his Hobby Lobby decision, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, even without Justice Scalia.
[00:38:48.774 --> 00:39:01.499]  It's very interesting, and we had a discussion about this last night on the Nightly News, went into depth about the history of the Supreme Court situation, what is ahead for Donald Trump in terms of another possible three liberal justices on there.
[00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:02.980]  See, this justice,
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.062]  Gorsuch, Neil Gorsuch, is a Scalia clone.
[00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:11.325]  Putting him in Scalia's seat does not change anything about the balance of the Supreme Court.
[00:39:12.086 --> 00:39:13.627]  And he is eminently qualified.
[00:39:13.647 --> 00:39:15.288]  He has great credentials.
[00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:19.972]  He was unanimously selected for the current district court position that he's in.
[00:39:20.672 --> 00:39:21.972]  But it's beyond that.
[00:39:22.072 --> 00:39:27.874]  He has excellent decisions that he's had, but it's going to come down to these types of ideological issues.
[00:39:27.994 --> 00:39:35.036]  And Donald Trump last night, after the news, said, we're going to go nuclear if we need to, to confirm Gorsuch.
[00:39:35.636 --> 00:39:41.738]  If they want to try to block it by a filibuster, say you're going to have to have 60 votes, then we're going to go nuclear.
[00:39:42.678 --> 00:39:48.981]  And that means that they're going to change the rules so then they only need 51 votes in order to confirm him.
[00:39:49.802 --> 00:39:57.406]  If they do that for this non-controversial judge who doesn't alter the balance of the Supreme Court, who is eminently qualified as a jurist,
[00:39:58.146 --> 00:40:10.135]  Then you're going to find a situation where when you've got three of these judges, like Ginsburg and Kennedy and others, who are at or well beyond, in the case of Ginsburg, well beyond the average retirement age of Supreme Court justices, which is 79.
[00:40:10.316 --> 00:40:16.881]  She's at 83, she's had bouts of cancer, she's in very poor health, and I would say probably poor mental health as well.
[00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:25.467]  But if they don't retire, and there's a good chance that they will retire or die in the next four years because of their age, in that situation,
[00:40:26.528 --> 00:40:33.353]  A Trump appointment without any, with just a simple 51 vote would change the balance of the Supreme Court.
[00:40:33.853 --> 00:40:36.395]  So we're going to talk about all the issues behind that.
[00:40:37.455 --> 00:40:44.980]  And of course, one of the things that's breaking today in the news, we're going to go to a John Bowne report at the top of the hour about what happened in Berkeley.
[00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:55.728]  But I think as we go back and forth and we look at issues of speech, as we look at issues of law, as we look at the difference between establishment and separation and the free exercise of religion,
[00:40:56.588 --> 00:41:02.271]  It's amazing to me, and of course we've talked about this many times, how the left embraces Sharia law.
[00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:15.977]  Even though Sharia law wants to oppress women, and the left is all about feminism, and yet you have people like Hillary Clinton bring on a Sharia Khan, as I called him, a Qazir Khan.
[00:41:16.678 --> 00:41:20.760]  They say, well he's a gold star family so he gets to speak, but he has been
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.762]  Known as a deep advocate of Sharia law, and we have another advocate of Sharia law here.
[00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:35.766]  This lady is Linda Sarsal, and I want to read you some of her Twitter feeds that she's out here.
[00:41:35.807 --> 00:41:38.708]  She organized a pro-Sharia women's march.
[00:41:39.168 --> 00:41:45.251]  Now this was defended by the SPLC, and we had that at InfoWars.com about a week or so ago, but I want to give you
[00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:48.473]  An idea of the propaganda that is being put out here.
[00:41:48.933 --> 00:41:54.336]  She says, you'll know when you're living under Sharia law if suddenly all your loans and credit cards become interest-free.
[00:41:54.396 --> 00:41:55.277]  Sounds nice, doesn't it?
[00:41:55.397 --> 00:41:56.478]  Oh, wouldn't that be great?
[00:41:56.758 --> 00:42:00.400]  She says, if you're still paying interest, then Sharia law hasn't taken over America.
[00:42:01.081 --> 00:42:02.481]  And I noted on here, you know what?
[00:42:03.022 --> 00:42:04.303]  That is not something that you own.
[00:42:04.983 --> 00:42:10.728]  The one time that it's recorded that Jesus got violent with people was against the money changers.
[00:42:10.768 --> 00:42:11.748]  That's not something you own.
[00:42:11.788 --> 00:42:14.310]  But then she talks about how wonderful it is to live under... You know what?
[00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.753]  You don't have... You get paid maternity leave, she says, in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:18.093 --> 00:42:20.215]  And I would say, yeah, you also have reduced overhead.
[00:42:20.275 --> 00:42:22.557]  If you violate their law, they cut your head off.
[00:42:22.817 --> 00:42:23.818]  That's Sharia law.
[00:42:24.118 --> 00:42:25.499]  That's establishment of religion.
[00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:26.960]  That's what the liberals support.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.561]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:32.731 --> 00:42:34.893]  Thank you very much for coming out.
[00:42:35.754 --> 00:42:37.536]  Is the sound working?
[00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:38.778]  I can hear you.
[00:42:38.818 --> 00:42:39.879]  Can you hear us?
[00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:56.019]  The Democrats wouldn't know how to protest if their political lives depended on it.
[00:42:56.459 --> 00:42:56.979]  And they do.
[00:42:57.259 --> 00:43:09.787]  Led by the perpetually neurotic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Party attempted to right the sinking Democratic ship and failed miserably.
[00:43:09.807 --> 00:43:13.149]  Is the sound working?
[00:43:17.632 --> 00:43:18.732]  Good evening everyone.
[00:43:18.752 --> 00:43:20.934]  I'm very proud to hear...
[00:43:24.807 --> 00:43:32.373]  Proud to stand with the members of the House Democratic Caucus, soon to be joined by the Senate Democrats as well.
[00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:34.195]  The mic's not on.
[00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:34.875]  It's not on?
[00:43:35.336 --> 00:43:39.819]  Now we'll hear from Andre Carson, a Muslim member of Congress.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:51.409]  Greetings from the great state of Indiana, I'm Congressman Andre Carson.
[00:43:55.904 --> 00:44:02.755]  Not only do I represent Indiana's 7th Congressional District very proudly, but I happen to be a Muslim and a former police officer.
[00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:14.347]  The Democrats are in full panic mode after having to hold seminars in order to speak to regular American voters.
[00:44:14.647 --> 00:44:31.356]  As Breitbart reports, another program on the subject of speaking to those who feel invisible in rural America will feature Steve Beshear, a former Democrat Kentucky governor, along with Democrats Michael Bennett from Colorado and North Dakotan Heidi Heitkamp.
[00:44:31.596 --> 00:44:38.940]  Other seminars include Listening to Those Feel Unheard and Rising America, They Feel Unheard Too.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:50.166]  These topics may be a hard sell to a party contemplating hiring a new party chairperson from among candidates trying to outdo each other with far-left talking points.
[00:44:50.547 --> 00:44:52.908]  We will not let this evil order
[00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.431]  Extinguish that great torch.
[00:44:55.932 --> 00:45:00.615]  We will not let this evil order make us less American.
[00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:06.919]  We will fight it with everything we have and we will win this fight.
[00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:23.907]  And now it is my privilege, our privilege, to introduce Farah Amir-Kamal and Omar Al-Mazdad with their stories, their courageous stories.
[00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:32.534]  You described what happened in November as the alleged election.
[00:45:32.574 --> 00:45:33.675]  I think I'm quoting you exactly.
[00:45:33.695 --> 00:45:34.376]  The alleged election.
[00:45:34.836 --> 00:45:38.239]  By that, did you mean that it's an election that didn't actually take place?
[00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:40.260]  Whether we should pretend it didn't happen?
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:40.881]  Or what did you mean?
[00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:43.443]  As someone who wants to lead the Democratic Party, what's your position on that?
[00:45:43.863 --> 00:45:46.266]  Something happened in this election with Russia.
[00:45:46.586 --> 00:45:54.335]  Something happened that was so significant that the Democratic members of Congress that got that classified briefing stormed out of that room.
[00:45:54.676 --> 00:46:02.525]  Of course, it doesn't help when DNC Chair candidate Sally Boynton Brown goes after the few white Democrats left.
[00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:06.288]  And my job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt.
[00:46:07.049 --> 00:46:13.494]  My job is to shut other white people down when they want to say, oh no, I'm not prejudiced.
[00:46:13.915 --> 00:46:14.775]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:15.616]  I'm accepting.
[00:46:16.056 --> 00:46:21.201]  My job is to make sure that they get, that they have privilege.
[00:46:21.581 --> 00:46:29.088]  And until we shut our mouths and we listen to those people who don't, and we lift our people up,
[00:46:29.804 --> 00:46:35.365]  Former Vice President Joe Biden is now endorsing Tom Perez for DNC Chair.
[00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:36.926]  Donald Trump is a fraud.
[00:46:37.106 --> 00:46:38.306]  He's in it all for himself.
[00:46:38.726 --> 00:46:41.807]  Donald Trump is all about prosperity for himself.
[00:46:42.327 --> 00:46:47.628]  Me, myself, and I. That's not what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are about.
[00:46:48.188 --> 00:46:49.708]  Donald Trump is a fraud.
[00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:53.889]  As the Democratic Party continues to implode.
[00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.230]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.055]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.075 --> 00:48:59.956]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.016]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:16.920]  Well guys, no matter how violent the protests get, the liberals in media and the liberals in Hollywood continue to promote the protest and refuse to denounce it.
[00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.722]  Quite an astounding thing.
[00:49:19.082 --> 00:49:24.308]  And I know talking to you today, Darren, this is something that's really starting to peeve us off.
[00:49:24.368 --> 00:49:25.789]  We've almost reached a tipping point.
[00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.251]  What have you been seeing, Maggie?
[00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:32.114]  Well look, so we've got this ground zero for this 1960s free speech movement.
[00:49:32.274 --> 00:49:42.721]  The irony of this, of course we're talking about the protest happening in Berkeley, a bunch of whining, sniffling babies, 20-something, I can't tell if they're men or women, they're in skinny pants with bandanas over their faces.
[00:49:42.901 --> 00:49:43.922]  Making fools out of themselves.
[00:49:44.022 --> 00:49:50.347]  Honestly, put down the BPH line cans and maybe your political views will change because at this point it's utter anarchy.
[00:49:50.447 --> 00:49:51.948]  It's chaotic crap.
[00:49:52.408 --> 00:49:53.910]  And it's not even interesting crap.
[00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:58.373]  You know, we saw this young girl, her name's Kiara Robles, InfoWars reached out to her this morning.
[00:49:58.713 --> 00:50:02.236]  She was pepper sprayed in the face for expressing a political view.
[00:50:02.616 --> 00:50:06.399]  That's what we've come to at the birthing center of free speech in this country.
[00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:07.240]  Full circle.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.821]  And meanwhile the liberals in Hollywood, they're losing their minds.
[00:50:11.161 --> 00:50:11.642]  Right?
[00:50:11.802 --> 00:50:16.404]  They are openly embracing this is domestic terrorism, in my opinion.
[00:50:16.444 --> 00:50:18.324]  What's going on at Berkeley and these riots.
[00:50:18.364 --> 00:50:19.265]  Domestic terrorism.
[00:50:19.745 --> 00:50:32.530]  First we had Madonna a couple weeks ago saying that she's thought several times about bombing the White House and now we have psycho Sarah Silverman who's calling for a military overthrow of the U.S.
[00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.171]  government to take out President
[00:50:34.591 --> 00:50:35.191]  Donald Trump.
[00:50:35.472 --> 00:50:37.052]  These people are insane.
[00:50:37.193 --> 00:50:41.475]  And this is more proof that liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:50:41.495 --> 00:50:42.816]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[00:50:43.356 --> 00:50:48.979]  And I wonder, where do you draw the line to start calling some of this activity treasonous?
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:57.845]  There has to be some sort of line drawn, especially if these protests continue to get more violent, more destructive, more property damage.
[00:50:58.005 --> 00:50:59.826]  Only one arrest apparently last night.
[00:50:59.866 --> 00:51:00.926]  I didn't know there was any.
[00:51:00.986 --> 00:51:02.187]  How is that possible?
[00:51:02.207 --> 00:51:02.887]  How is it possible?
[00:51:02.907 --> 00:51:03.728]  You're absolutely right.
[00:51:04.108 --> 00:51:04.828]  They stood down.
[00:51:04.908 --> 00:51:07.389]  So what we saw is literally protesters.
[00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:08.489]  The cops were on the balcony.
[00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:12.450]  They were hurling firecrackers at the police officers.
[00:51:12.731 --> 00:51:13.651]  I saw two shots.
[00:51:13.751 --> 00:51:15.231]  I watched these videos all morning long.
[00:51:15.611 --> 00:51:16.752]  They were subdued.
[00:51:17.072 --> 00:51:20.153]  They let these people wreak havoc on the entire community.
[00:51:20.213 --> 00:51:22.593]  They were breaking Starbucks windows.
[00:51:22.693 --> 00:51:24.094]  I don't even understand that, folks.
[00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.034]  Behaving like fascists.
[00:51:25.254 --> 00:51:28.455]  Seriously, you've got the fascists promoting fascism.
[00:51:28.495 --> 00:51:30.035]  The anti-fascists, excuse me.
[00:51:30.055 --> 00:51:30.336]  It's 1984.
[00:51:30.436 --> 00:51:30.596]  It's 1984.
[00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:37.925]  Well, and I still want to focus on Sarah Silverman a little more because a lot of people are like, who cares?
[00:51:37.945 --> 00:51:42.974]  I mean, it's just some trashy Hollywood actress that wants people to rise up and take over the government, you know?
[00:51:43.596 --> 00:51:44.837]  And she's always been trashy.
[00:51:45.077 --> 00:51:45.938]  She's always been trashy.
[00:51:45.958 --> 00:51:48.260]  But Hollywood, they do have the power of influence.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:53.444]  Sarah Silverman has close to 9 million Twitter followers, right?
[00:51:53.504 --> 00:51:57.827]  And a lot of those people are probably just as batshit crazy as she is.
[00:51:57.867 --> 00:51:59.048]  These people are dangerous.
[00:51:59.068 --> 00:52:07.174]  And like I said, Hollywood and the left-stream media, they do have the power of influence over these lemmings who are out there doing this stuff.
[00:52:07.555 --> 00:52:09.476]  So I just think it's very dangerous.
[00:52:10.097 --> 00:52:12.699]  And you've just got to wonder, like you were saying, is it treason?
[00:52:13.379 --> 00:52:13.739]  I don't know.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:27.690]  Well, my thing is, it's one thing when they just want to spout off nonsense on social media or get in front of the camera and spout off nonsense, you know, and then maybe it reaches another level when you talk about Sarah Silverman, you know, basically threatening the government or threatening to overthrow.
[00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:31.333]  You talk about Madonna offering fellatio for a vote for Hillary.
[00:52:31.353 --> 00:52:35.757]  You know, this is kind of the stuff where now you're like, you know, now you're on the border of, okay, are you, what you're saying legal?
[00:52:36.037 --> 00:52:36.898]  It helped Trump win.
[00:52:37.278 --> 00:52:39.079]  No one wants fellatio from Madonna.
[00:52:41.212 --> 00:52:56.202]  It's the question to me is, I think Hollywood's losing their influence over the real Americans, over the majority of Americans, but they still have the influence over, obviously, the delusional, the mentally deranged people who are out now committing acts of violence.
[00:52:56.603 --> 00:52:58.504]  And me and you have been talking about this, Darren.
[00:52:58.544 --> 00:53:01.906]  It's like, look, eventually someone has to be held accountable.
[00:53:02.066 --> 00:53:07.110]  We can't just be having protests, property damage, destruction, all this stuff going on without nobody being held accountable.
[00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.451]  I mean, somebody has to be.
[00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:09.852]  How do we stop this?
[00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:12.612]  I think we make examples of these people.
[00:53:12.632 --> 00:53:16.413]  Yeah, we need to make examples of them, but there is a blessing in disguise.
[00:53:16.473 --> 00:53:20.234]  Because the thing about these liberals and these protesters, they just don't learn.
[00:53:20.254 --> 00:53:30.896]  They can never learn, because it's the protests, it's the anti-Trump rallies, and it's all these riots that were largely responsible for Donald Trump getting elected to begin with.
[00:53:31.257 --> 00:53:34.517]  And now when you look at Berkeley, okay, so they wanted Milo.
[00:53:34.617 --> 00:53:36.718]  Milo was only expected to talk to, what, 200 people?
[00:53:38.118 --> 00:53:44.722]  By shutting him down, and by doing these crybaby fits and writing and everything, now Milo has a national audience.
[00:53:44.782 --> 00:53:46.444]  He was on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:53:46.764 --> 00:53:49.706]  Millions of people are listening to what he has to say, and guess what?
[00:53:49.746 --> 00:53:50.786]  They like what they're hearing.
[00:53:50.887 --> 00:53:51.747]  Most people like it.
[00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:52.808]  It resonates with them.
[00:53:53.208 --> 00:53:57.611]  So they're defeating the whole purpose, and so like I said, it's a blessing in disguise.
[00:53:57.711 --> 00:54:02.813]  Well, he defies the fact that, you know, this false narrative that Trump and Trump supporters are anti-gay.
[00:54:03.234 --> 00:54:06.415]  Milo is very outspokenly gay, people.
[00:54:06.695 --> 00:54:11.457]  You know, he represents everything that they can't understand, that they don't, they can't put in a box.
[00:54:11.858 --> 00:54:17.500]  Speaking of Sarah Silverman, because I want to go back to this, she says, wake up and join the resistance once the military is with us.
[00:54:18.161 --> 00:54:19.101]  Fascists get overthrown.
[00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:20.622]  You're a fascist, sweetheart.
[00:54:20.862 --> 00:54:23.103]  But she finishes it with four heart emojis.
[00:54:23.143 --> 00:54:25.084]  So it's still a love Trump's hate campaign.
[00:54:25.504 --> 00:54:34.647]  Even though she's promoting hate and violence and the anarchist view of a government overthrow, she's finishing it with four heart emojis.
[00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:35.567]  So we're all good.
[00:54:35.607 --> 00:54:36.627]  We're all good in the hood.
[00:54:36.647 --> 00:54:38.668]  Well, it's just amazing.
[00:54:38.888 --> 00:54:42.509]  The double standard of the left has never been more palpable.
[00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.330]  When they go low, we go high.
[00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.431]  That's been completely repudiated.
[00:54:48.973 --> 00:54:52.398]  Well, Donald Trump is an anti-semite homophobe.
[00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:57.845]  You just protested a Milo Yiannopoulos event, a homosexual Jewish man.
[00:54:58.466 --> 00:55:01.790]  So, I mean, we can go on and on with all these case studies, but I mean, look at this.
[00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:03.532]  The Soros's are involved in this.
[00:55:04.754 --> 00:55:11.700]  Darren and I were talking about this, right, off camera, we understand that Alex Soros has a PhD, he's getting a PhD from Berkeley.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.362]  Yeah, he's probably there, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:55:13.402 --> 00:55:25.273]  Somebody said they spotted him in the protest, we could not find a photograph so we didn't bring it to you directly, but the understanding is that the activist that showed up, 150 in number, were most likely Soros-backed.
[00:55:26.294 --> 00:55:29.057]  No confirmation on that yet, but it makes total sense, it's what they do.
[00:55:29.637 --> 00:55:39.145]  He's already got his own foundation too, so you know he's trying to leverage whatever type of powers he can from that, and whatever people he can bring in to try to influence as well.
[00:55:39.766 --> 00:55:43.589]  Well, all I have to say to the liberals out there, be careful what you ask for.
[00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:46.332]  Because if you want a civil war, it might come true.
[00:55:47.132 --> 00:55:48.193]  Trust me, you don't want it.
[00:55:48.313 --> 00:55:49.454]  We don't want it!
[00:55:49.494 --> 00:55:50.095]  Who would want it?
[00:55:50.595 --> 00:55:51.596]  It looks like the left wants it!
[00:55:51.796 --> 00:55:52.377]  They do want it!
[00:55:52.597 --> 00:55:56.800]  And when are they going to go up against 55 million gun owners in America, you know?
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:04.705]  And you might think you're tough because you can light a trash can on fire, and Sarah Silverman's your leader, and Madonna's your leader, and you can punch a woman in the face.
[00:56:04.745 --> 00:56:05.406]  I mean, come on.
[00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:10.790]  Did you see the video of that teacher who was, like, shooting the squirt gun at the... They don't even know how to use a firearm.
[00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:14.492]  They wouldn't even know the first thing to do with it if they had a firearm in their hand.
[00:56:14.832 --> 00:56:15.733]  But it's beyond that.
[00:56:15.773 --> 00:56:18.715]  These are the most chicken-necked, weak people I've ever seen in my life.
[00:56:18.895 --> 00:56:19.656]  Darren, you or I...
[00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:26.142]  I mean, granted, they had metal poles and, you know, things on fire and pepper spray.
[00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:29.565]  I still think we probably could have taken down the whole thing, which is why I'm sitting here scratching my head.
[00:56:30.326 --> 00:56:34.730]  Which is, you know, again, we have to look in the mirror and say, you know, we've been protesting the police state.
[00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:39.674]  I hate the fact that I would ever call for police to try to quell a protest.
[00:56:39.714 --> 00:56:43.038]  But I mean, again, we have to draw a line somewhere.
[00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:44.979]  And it really hurts me deep.
[00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:48.532]  That this is going on in my country more than anything.
[00:56:48.632 --> 00:56:54.134]  What we're witnessing here is the tearing apart of our society, our country, the United States.
[00:56:54.154 --> 00:56:55.194]  They're trying to bring it down.
[00:56:55.214 --> 00:56:57.535]  They don't care about this country.
[00:56:57.575 --> 00:57:04.518]  They don't give two you-know-whats about our nation, about us coming together as a people, about us growing economically and being one.
[00:57:04.798 --> 00:57:06.419]  They care about division.
[00:57:06.499 --> 00:57:09.340]  Immigrants made America great, even though they're here protesting America.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:09.980]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:10.260]  Yeah.
[00:57:25.334 --> 00:57:26.654]  The unfortunate privilege.
[00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:50.721]  I still can't get it out of my head.
[00:57:51.742 --> 00:57:53.182]  You need therapy after you hear it.
[00:57:53.242 --> 00:57:55.743]  It's some of the most grotesque.
[00:57:55.763 --> 00:57:57.383]  Shock humor, right?
[00:57:57.564 --> 00:58:00.024]  That's all she's about is shock humor.
[00:58:00.044 --> 00:58:02.245]  Explicit material.
[00:58:02.325 --> 00:58:03.245]  It wasn't funny.
[00:58:03.265 --> 00:58:05.146]  I don't get why she's famous.
[00:58:05.546 --> 00:58:07.186]  And we need to have some new robots.
[00:58:07.267 --> 00:58:08.567]  Oh, you know why she's famous.
[00:58:08.747 --> 00:58:11.828]  Because she's willing to do or say whatever the establishment tells her to do.
[00:58:12.148 --> 00:58:16.372]  Never the liberal establishment wants Sarah Silverman to do, she will do.
[00:58:16.692 --> 00:58:18.013]  That's why she continues to get jobs.
[00:58:18.254 --> 00:58:19.315]  I talked about this a while ago.
[00:58:19.575 --> 00:58:20.896]  Sarah Silverman has never been funny.
[00:58:21.056 --> 00:58:24.519]  The only reason she's gotten any contract, any job ever, is because she's a total shill.
[00:58:24.539 --> 00:58:25.960]  Yeah, because she's a liberal.
[00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:37.891]  And they go to these, like the Golden Globe Awards, and they'll get up there and trash the president, and they look throughout the audience, and they see all the other Hollywood elites, and they're like, oh my god, it's so good to be part of this elitist group, but guess what?
[00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:42.917]  The average American person does not identify with Hollywood trash.
[00:58:43.618 --> 00:58:51.226]  The liberal movement in Hollywood, the liberal movement in the media, the liberal movement on the streets has reached cult levels.
[00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:53.289]  It's time to start holding these people accountable.
[00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:54.250]  Thank you guys.
[00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.471]  Thank you guys for tuning in.
