[00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.450]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.290]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.531]  It's Monday, January the 30th, 2017.
[00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:23.431]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:36.498]  Trump's travel ban has sent the leftists into a tizzy, protesting in the streets, but ignoring their own hypocrisies on the issue.
[00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:46.842]  Also, why the travel ban has been implemented, who helped mold it, the history of similar actions, and why Europe's bad immigration and refugee policy can be used as a guidestone.
[00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:52.405]  And then, fake Jake Tapper, the CNN fop, attempts to win points with the establishment.
[00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:55.906]  But his guest took the segment in an unwanted direction.
[00:00:55.946 --> 00:01:07.512]  If we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we could achieve peace.
[00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:11.994]  Meanwhile, Iran is testing missiles that defy a UN resolution.
[00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:17.056]  Will this warrant a response from the globalist, anti-American UN or the Trump administration?
[00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:20.718]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:15.366]  Today, in an attempt to prove President Trump right in his travel ban on travel from Iran, Iran tested a ballistic missile in violation of an agreement that is only six months old.
[00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:23.070]  Iran conducted its first ballistic missile test under Trump's presidency today, in yet another apparent violation of a UN resolution.
[00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.850]  UN Resolution 2231.
[00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:32.655]  Put in place days after the Iranian nuclear deal was signed, calls on Islamic Republic not to conduct such tests.
[00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:38.818]  However, this is at least Iran's second such test since July of just last year.
[00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:45.321]  The resolution bars Iran from conducting ballistic missile tests for eight years, and of course it went into effect six months ago.
[00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:46.822]  They violated it twice.
[00:03:47.902 --> 00:04:07.366]  Understand as we look at this and we're told by the multinational corporations that this is absolutely unprecedented what Donald Trump is doing and we're going to look at why the multinational corporations are pushing these protests and these riots because they're the ones who are going to feel it when the next shoe drops, the H-1B visa program.
[00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.006]  We're going to talk about that in a moment and how they abuse that.
[00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:12.127]  But remember that it was Jimmy Carter
[00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:20.310]  Who enacted not only a travel ban, but a freeze on Iranian assets that was just lifted by the Obama administration.
[00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.032]  And now we see that that one action by Obama was clearly a mistake.
[00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:28.453]  And we clearly see that Jimmy Carter was correct.
[00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:37.384]  Now, also we have up on Infowars.com a flashback looking at reactions from other Democrats to Vietnamese immigrants.
[00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:40.108]  Remember when this happened back in 1975?
[00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.231]  Maybe you don't, so we'll remind you here.
[00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:43.713]  Governor Jerry Brown.
[00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:52.360]  And mostly Democrats pushed back on the Ford administration's attempts to relocate refugees from Indochina in 1975.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:03.709]  Now Brown said at the time, he said, there is something a little strange about saying let's bring in 500,000 more people when we can't take care of the one million Californians out of work.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.556]  His administration even attempted to block planes carrying Vietnamese refugees from landing at Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco.
[00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:19.047]  Was there anybody standing out there with the placard from the Statue of Liberty, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free?
[00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:20.149]  Okay, no, they didn't do that.
[00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.594]  As a matter of fact, these same Democrats now,
[00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:35.079]  40 years later, are blocking, still blocking the airports, still doing it in protest, but now against Donald Trump for doing the same things that they have done in the past.
[00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.060]  But they go on.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.223]  They say, our biggest problem came from California, said Julia Taft.
[00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:44.206]  Now she was the task force head on Indochina refugees.
[00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:47.108]  She said this in 2007 interview with NPR.
[00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:50.931]  She said they didn't want any of these refugees because they also had unemployment.
[00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.074]  They already had a large number of foreign-born people in California.
[00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:58.475]  They had, they said, too many Hispanics, too many people on welfare.
[00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:00.176]  And so they didn't want these people.
[00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:03.797]  Also, Vice President Joe Biden chimed in on that.
[00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:11.179]  As a senator, he said that the president at the time, the Ford administration, had not informed Congress adequately about the number of refugees.
[00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.600]  So they were not about bringing in refugees back then.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.440]  And let's go to Bill Clinton.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.381]  This is what he had to say as president.
[00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.301]  Does this sound familiar?
[00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:21.842]  All Americans
[00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:31.957]  Not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.262]  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.
[00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:39.927]  The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers.
[00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:56.244]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
[00:06:56.904 --> 00:06:59.646]  In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more.
[00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:11.053]  To speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace, as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
[00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:16.056]  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.
[00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:28.244]  It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
[00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:46.578]  Even more recently, we've seen Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton push back against refugees, push back against travel from countries that they believe are dangerous.
[00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:54.684]  Going back to 2011, the Obama-Clinton State Department put a six-month hiatus on people traveling from Iraq at the time.
[00:07:55.344 --> 00:08:06.312]  That wasn't talked about a great deal, but then, 2015, December of 2015, Obama signed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act.
[00:08:06.912 --> 00:08:08.133]  You see that's what this truly is.
[00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:12.836]  This is trying to prevent terrorists from traveling to our country.
[00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.337]  We don't have the ability to vet these people.
[00:08:15.657 --> 00:08:17.979]  It was recognized by Obama in December of 2015.
[00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:25.384]  He restricted access to 38 countries and he also, the very countries that he picked at the time,
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.323]  Or countries that we've had President Trump pick.
[00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:31.545]  Iran, Syria, Sudan, Iraq.
[00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:32.245]  Okay?
[00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:40.833]  If you had traveled to those countries in the past five years, or if you had dual citizenship from one of those countries, you would be denied entry.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.067]  So just three months later, Obama added three more countries, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen.
[00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:54.794]  You could not have visited those countries, but you could have dual citizenship in those countries and still come in.
[00:08:54.975 --> 00:09:00.621]  Nevertheless, they kept dual citizens from Syria, Sudan, Iraq, and Iran still ineligible.
[00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:02.923]  These are the same seven countries
[00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:15.875]  That less than a year later, Donald Trump has blocked travel from temporarily in an attempt to try to make sure that we have better control of who's coming in, that we have a vetting process that we can trust.
[00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:21.761]  Understand, it's the United Nations that's doing the vetting that is sending the people in from these countries as refugees.
[00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.741]  And they're not doing a very good job, if you look at Europe.
[00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:31.823]  And so we have Nigel Farage, Katie Hopkins, and others now saying, we back Donald Trump's Muslim ban, if you want to call it that.
[00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.123]  It's not a Muslim ban, of course.
[00:09:33.663 --> 00:09:37.124]  The largest population Muslim countries in the world are not included on it.
[00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:44.205]  Places like Indonesia, where Barack Obama learned his Islam, I guess we could put it that way.
[00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:47.105]  Also got his values instilled in him at an early age.
[00:09:47.485 --> 00:09:48.685]  But it is not a Muslim ban.
[00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:51.406]  It's a ban on the same seven countries that he banned travel to.
[00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:57.374]  And they also point out that they would like to have this policy, Nigel Farage says, we should have this in Britain.
[00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:04.263]  Because there have been multiple attacks, as you may well remember, in France, as well as in Germany in the last year.
[00:10:04.824 --> 00:10:07.368]  And Farage said this, he said, Trump was elected to get tough.
[00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:13.332]  He was elected to say he will do everything within his power to protect America from infiltration by ISIS terrorists.
[00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:15.274]  He is entitled to do this.
[00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:17.255]  He was voted in on this.
[00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:21.779]  And as far as we're concerned in this country, Britain in other words, yes, I would like to see extreme vetting.
[00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:31.286]  And he went on to say, I would remind you that of the eight people who committed atrocities in Paris, five of them got into Europe posing as refugees.
[00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:33.308]  So that is an issue here.
[00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:38.870]  And as Katie Hopkins said, Britain is not great, it is a kingdom of ghettos.
[00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:57.499]  So the problem is, is that even if people don't come in as refugees, repeatedly what we're seeing happening with massive migration of populations in numbers so that they don't have to assimilate, they ghettoize, especially because of the common culture, the common religion they don't want to mix with outsiders.
[00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:02.802]  The second generation then becomes extremely radicalized if they didn't come in originally as terrorists.
[00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:15.336]  Meanwhile, as the corporations push the idea that this is something that nobody has ever done before, that this is something that is totally beyond the pale, we now see the results of this this weekend in Seattle.
[00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:23.765]  This article from the Daily Caller points out that Black Lives Matter anti-Trump protesters in Seattle say, we need to start killing people.
[00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:29.826]  In this video clip that they have featured in the article, there's a woman who says, we need to start killing people.
[00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:32.208]  First off, we need to start killing the White House.
[00:11:32.869 --> 00:11:34.331]  The White House must die.
[00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:38.134]  The White House, your effing White House, your effing presidents, they must go.
[00:11:38.154 --> 00:11:39.476]  Eff the White House.
[00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:42.879]  And while she's saying that, you can hear another protester saying, burn it.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.701]  Ah, remember Madonna?
[00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:46.383]  She was just kidding, of course.
[00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:59.896]  Now, I have to say that when we look at how out of touch these people are with the rest of America, a good example of that, I think, is this article from CBS Philadelphia talking about Puxatani Field.
[00:12:00.056 --> 00:12:12.182]  Groundhog Day is coming up, and they say that the average cost for hotel rooms surrounding Groundhog Day is greater than that around the Super Bowl coming up in Houston.
[00:12:12.902 --> 00:12:14.584]  This is website Tribago.
[00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:25.853]  They looked at the average hotel rates around Groundhog Day and found that there, they're about $450 for a one-night stay, whereas if you want to stay for the Super Bowl in Houston, it's about $340.
[00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:37.923]  So that's just one indicator of how the NFL is plummeting because they've taken the side of Black Lives Matter, as we've seen with Colin Kaepernick, and
[00:12:38.644 --> 00:12:43.912]  Their popularity is declining and of course it's not going to be helped, I think, by the Super Bowl and by Madonna.
[00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:49.621]  Meanwhile, we see that outside of Silicon Valley, businesses are not concerned about this policy either.
[00:12:49.942 --> 00:12:53.728]  We've seen this come and go, as we pointed out at the beginning, by multiple presidents.
[00:12:54.068 --> 00:12:58.950]  And people understand we have to do something to make sure we don't get terrorists coming into our country.
[00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:05.613]  Reuters points out the Trump travel van stirs very little corporate outcry outside of Silicon Valley.
[00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:11.816]  While the leaders of Apple, Google, Facebook and others email their staffs to denounce the suspension of U.S.
[00:13:11.856 --> 00:13:15.398]  refugee programs, most of the other corporations really don't care.
[00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:17.199]  And of course we've seen this with Starbucks.
[00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:18.499]  We're good to go.
[00:13:37.853 --> 00:13:42.595]  His clash with Silicon Valley, says Bloomberg, is about to become even more contentious.
[00:13:42.775 --> 00:13:44.495]  This is what they're really concerned about.
[00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:47.536]  It's not the programs that have been done before.
[00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:49.837]  This is what's going to affect their pocketbooks.
[00:13:50.397 --> 00:14:02.822]  Trump could strike even closer to them if they say, this administration has drafted an executive order that is aimed at overhauling the work visa programs that technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.
[00:14:03.402 --> 00:14:11.926]  If implemented, it will bring wholesale changes at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Indian companies like Infosys.
[00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:16.567]  And of course, Amazon says they're going to join in the lawsuits around that as well.
[00:14:16.928 --> 00:14:20.829]  But I want to go back to an article from 2014 from the New York Times.
[00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:26.912]  And in this, they point out how these companies were gaming the system with this H-1B visa program.
[00:14:27.512 --> 00:14:35.505]  Now if you look at this graphic, you can see that there's 13 outsourcing companies that took nearly a third of all the H-1B visa programs.
[00:14:35.585 --> 00:14:41.254]  And if you look at the way they break this down in terms of foreign corporations, that block there on the left
[00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:46.399]  Most of the visas were going to foreign companies in India.
[00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:54.424]  So the one on the far right, IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, the one that's in brown over there, that's Silicon Valley.
[00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:57.906]  But the bigger block, the biggest block of all of them, are Indian companies.
[00:14:58.187 --> 00:14:59.587]  Companies like Infosys.
[00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:01.148]  Now what's going on with this?
[00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:04.331]  They say, well there's a limited number of these visas that come out every year.
[00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:10.496]  And what they do is they dominate the program by flooding the system with applications.
[00:15:10.636 --> 00:15:12.498]  They know how to game this system.
[00:15:13.298 --> 00:15:22.987]  And so you've got the top 20 include a lot of large outsourcing firms that provide temporary workers for companies like Disney and Toys R Us.
[00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:28.692]  You see, these are not PhD scientists who are coming in to work on our nuclear program like Albert Einstein.
[00:15:29.349 --> 00:15:33.670]  These are people who are coming in to take American jobs at a fraction of the price.
[00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.590]  That is how they're gaming the system.
[00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.311]  That is how they're abusing the system.
[00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:50.574]  So they load the system to dominate it with applications, and with all these applications, their percentage of the number of workers who are getting visas has soared, and they say,
[00:15:51.354 --> 00:15:55.915]  Most H-1B visas workers are earning salaries below market rates.
[00:15:56.295 --> 00:16:03.857]  Under federal rules, employers like Infosys, that Indian company, have large numbers of H-1B workers in the U.S.
[00:16:03.877 --> 00:16:13.180]  They're required to declare that they will not displace American workers, but they're exempt from that requirement if the H-1B workers are paid at least $60,000 a year.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:28.964]  H-1B workers at outsourcing firms often receive wages at or slightly above $60,000, below what skilled American technology professionals tend to earn, so those firms can offer services to American companies at a lower cost, undercutting American workers.
[00:16:29.665 --> 00:16:33.966]  So they don't have to declare this if they're making more than $60,000.
[00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:39.888]  But if they come in and they cut an American worker who was making $80,000 or $90,000 and they get $60,000, then they don't have to declare that.
[00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:45.310]  And that's what we're increasingly seeing.
[00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.472]  That is how they game the system.
[00:16:47.852 --> 00:16:53.516]  That is why Silicon Valley is so upset about this and these foreign corporations are so upset about this.
[00:16:54.117 --> 00:16:57.439]  And that is going to be the next shoe to drop from Donald Trump.
[00:16:57.479 --> 00:16:59.421]  He's coming after the H-1B visa program.
[00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.123]  He's already drafted the executive order to do that.
[00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:04.584]  That is why they're upset.
[00:17:04.744 --> 00:17:08.025]  It's not because of the travel ban from these Muslim countries.
[00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:10.466]  That is simply a distraction.
[00:17:10.506 --> 00:17:11.806]  They're trying to get the moral high ground.
[00:17:11.826 --> 00:17:18.349]  They're trying to get their protesters and rioters fired up for that, when in reality what they're doing is really screwing the American worker.
[00:17:18.908 --> 00:17:24.253]  Now today we also saw Donald Trump saying that he had saved $600 million from an F-35 program.
[00:17:24.273 --> 00:17:32.260]  The Washington Post points out that this is off the next shipment of 90 F-35 Joint Strike Force fighter planes.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.961]  He has now negotiated that down.
[00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:40.387]  And finally today, I want you to take a look at a new piece of legislation that has been introduced multiple times, just like we saw
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:46.635]  CISPA, introduced twice, we saw ACTA, SOPA, PIPA, then finally they came up with CISA.
[00:17:47.256 --> 00:17:53.285]  That was so they could spy on you and take your information and turn it over to the government without you being able to sue them.
[00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:58.906]  Look at what is happening now with automobile companies and with Senator Markey.
[00:17:59.467 --> 00:18:02.269]  Senator Markey has introduced this bill multiple times.
[00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.451]  This is dear to his heart.
[00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:10.318]  It's a way for the government to spy on you as you travel using your car.
[00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:13.641]  And guess what they call this wonderful new act?
[00:18:14.102 --> 00:18:15.043]  The Spy Act.
[00:18:16.244 --> 00:18:16.824]  We're good.
[00:18:36.314 --> 00:18:39.638]  They'll do that because they want to spy on you.
[00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:40.879]  That's what you need to understand.
[00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:42.541]  That is where this is all headed.
[00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:47.927]  That's one of the things that we need to be very concerned about as we move forward with these infrastructure bills.
[00:18:47.947 --> 00:18:55.975]  If we're going to make radical changes in it, we need to make sure that we're not going to make ourselves more vulnerable to attack and more vulnerable to being spied on by the American government.
[00:18:55.995 --> 00:18:56.436]  Stay with us.
[00:18:56.616 --> 00:18:57.257]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.

[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.

[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.

[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.840]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:44.903]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsStore.com

[00:23:06.798 --> 00:23:10.820]  It has been a dizzying first 10 days of the Donald Trump presidency.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.901]  In fact, I can barely even keep up.
[00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:16.703]  I wished Donald Trump Godspeed when he became the president.
[00:23:16.803 --> 00:23:18.564]  I didn't think he could actually attain it.
[00:23:18.984 --> 00:23:24.707]  I'm joined in studio by Maggie Howell to talk about some of these executive orders, but Maggie, it really has been a whirlwind.
[00:23:24.807 --> 00:23:25.307]  It's crazy.
[00:23:25.327 --> 00:23:26.668]  I don't think the man eats or sleeps.
[00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:28.169]  You talk about Godspeed.
[00:23:28.229 --> 00:23:31.932]  We're just going to go over a few of the executive orders that he's passing.
[00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:33.873]  I want to take you through some of these quickly.
[00:23:33.953 --> 00:23:41.578]  So the most controversial one, and today, by the way, it marked at 10 o'clock today, his 10th day in office officially.
[00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:46.902]  And I've got to tell you, the one during the most controversy, of course, is this executive order imposing 120-day suspension.
[00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:53.065]  On the refugee program and a 90-day ban from citizens from seven terror hotspots.
[00:23:53.125 --> 00:24:05.530]  Now, I want to take you to these hotspots because they are identified by the Obama administration, not the Trump administration, and the most populous countries on the earth with the heaviest populations of Muslims.
[00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.031]  They're not on this list, folks.
[00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:12.393]  It's just countries that we know of that are responsible for jihadi terrorism and terrorism breeding.
[00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:22.663]  He's imposed this ban, and before we get to the rest of the executive orders, I just want to talk about this ban for a moment because that's gaining the most steam today, if anything.
[00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:28.088]  We're talking about this list, and just to make this known, in 2011,
[00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.633]  President Barack Obama banned all Iraqi refugees from entering for six months.
[00:24:33.673 --> 00:24:36.535]  So, this temporary ban getting the most steam.
[00:24:36.635 --> 00:24:39.817]  Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan.
[00:24:39.857 --> 00:24:46.821]  Now, going on, because he's done a lot this week, we're going to be withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we know that.
[00:24:47.602 --> 00:24:54.747]  He's called for an order to reinstate the so-called Mexico City policy, which is a ban on federal funds to international abortions.
[00:24:54.787 --> 00:24:56.128]  We're not going to be funding those any longer.
[00:24:56.148 --> 00:24:59.770]  And that's been a political football back and forth between Democrats and Republicans over the years.
[00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:00.550]  That's right.
[00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.432]  I know that you've covered the pro-life movement that was happening in Austin.
[00:25:03.912 --> 00:25:09.655]  And look, the bottom line is a lot of people have a moral issue with funding abortion abroad and here for that matter.
[00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:18.860]  Two orders reviving the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access pipelines in order to lengthen the ban on administration officials working as lobbyists.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.500]  This is critical.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.742]  And a lifetime ban on White House officials as lobbyists.
[00:25:22.762 --> 00:25:25.163]  He doesn't want to see people using their positions of service
[00:25:25.683 --> 00:25:29.567]  To gain a lot of money afterwards and influence because it's not really fair.
[00:25:29.687 --> 00:25:30.307]  So that's great.
[00:25:30.728 --> 00:25:37.934]  An order imposing a hiring freeze for some federal government workers as a way to shrink the massive bureaucracy.
[00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:45.361]  Also, Owen, something that I loved, I covered this this morning, he told the Pentagon, look, you guys got 30 days to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS.
[00:25:45.821 --> 00:25:46.982]  Put something on my desk.
[00:25:47.202 --> 00:25:48.664]  And then he calls President Putin.
[00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:49.785]  He's had a very busy week.
[00:25:50.387 --> 00:25:50.968]  It's amazing.
[00:25:51.008 --> 00:26:02.197]  I mean, he's constantly on the phone, he's constantly having meetings, and I think the amazing part of it is that he's doing it all for the American people to see, where there's a camera in the Oval Office.
[00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.199]  He's putting everything he does up online.
[00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:07.902]  If you want to read his executive orders, all you have to do is go to the White House website.
[00:26:08.263 --> 00:26:12.346]  They're giving you a rundown, a play-by-play of everything he's up to, to the letter.
[00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:13.868]  You mentioned that cam in the office?
[00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:15.588]  And he doesn't even need it.
[00:26:15.629 --> 00:26:17.429]  All he needs to do is tweet, in my opinion.
[00:26:17.469 --> 00:26:22.071]  You know, it's like watching a live cam of what a president should be doing.
[00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:30.855]  He's done more in the past 10 days than President Barack Obama has done for, you know, in the past eight years in terms of for the American people looking at this.
[00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:33.857]  And certainly he's done it transparently.
[00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:43.384]  I think that is a very important thing that can be a non-partisan way of looking at this if we can try to quit being in the hyper-politicized world that we live in.
[00:26:43.924 --> 00:26:48.167]  But of all these executive orders, I have to say most of them I agree wholeheartedly with.
[00:26:48.447 --> 00:26:50.068]  I love getting out of the TPP.
[00:26:50.589 --> 00:26:56.413]  I think that the move he made to try to block all of the lobbying that happens in the
[00:26:57.273 --> 00:27:00.794]  After the political careers of some of these people that get into the White House, I think that's a great move.
[00:27:01.574 --> 00:27:03.614]  Maybe aggressive with the Dakota pipeline.
[00:27:04.455 --> 00:27:15.837]  The travel ban obviously caught a lot of flack, but I think he kind of used a 3D chess move, and I'm going to talk about that later in the news, because like you said, it was actually Obama's list, so now he's kind of forcing the left to look in the mirror and be like, well, wait a second, okay.
[00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:19.778]  He's actually, I guess, taking advice from the Obama administration, essentially, on this one.
[00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:24.619]  You've got Chuck Schumer having a fake nervous breakdown over this list, actually crying.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:32.141]  The embarrassment that I felt personally for him watching it, different segment entirely, but you have a... He really has embarrassed himself.
[00:27:32.241 --> 00:27:33.462]  Oh man, a missed character.
[00:27:34.022 --> 00:27:37.043]  You've got the buddy bullet to gather, man.
[00:27:37.163 --> 00:27:37.783]  First of all...
[00:27:38.283 --> 00:27:42.867]  Barack Obama in 2011, the longest imposition of a ban, six months long.
[00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:59.102]  This is a 90-day ban and a 120-day suspension while we reassess who we're letting in because as we know, we're taking in people that are coming from countries that are breeding grounds for al-Nusra, al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:06.239]  Let's take a step back here and let's look at all the executive orders again, and I'm trying to look at this for a second from a non-partisan view.
[00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:11.580]  Okay, so he puts out all these executive orders, obviously a lot coming down the pike.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:22.363]  For somebody like me, who complained about all the executive orders Obama was filing, I have to look at this and I have to say, okay, well, you know, Trump's kind of doing the same thing, but a lot of them I agree with.
[00:28:22.503 --> 00:28:44.923]  Here's the thing, and that's the kicker, and I love that that's where you took us, because this regulatory freeze, for example, that's happening today, he signed an executive order at 1030, he's promising to eliminate for every regulatory imposition he puts into place, for example, and this affects businesses, he's going to eliminate two, and he said for any agency head that wants a regulation, you've got to come up with two to eliminate, so guess what?
[00:28:45.344 --> 00:28:46.805]  The budget for regs
[00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:49.986]  For 2017 is going to be zero dollars.
[00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:51.807]  It's not even going to cost anything, Owen.
[00:28:52.547 --> 00:28:54.487]  I've got to take you to one more because it's my favorite.
[00:28:54.507 --> 00:28:55.708]  I know we're running out of time here.
[00:28:55.728 --> 00:28:59.329]  The prolonged order on border security and immigration enforcement.
[00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:01.189]  Of course, we're talking about the wall.
[00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.670]  We know that that's coming.
[00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:22.724]  The stripping of federal grant money for sanctuary cities, hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol catch and release, or hopefully they'll just be catching at this point, forgive my slip, and he's implementing, he's putting into place policies for illegal aliens residing in these communities to reinstate local and state immigration laws.
[00:29:23.044 --> 00:29:23.464]  Let me guess.
[00:29:23.604 --> 00:29:24.244]  Let me get this straight.
[00:29:24.704 --> 00:29:25.705]  There's a new sheriff in town.
[00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:27.665]  He wants to enforce the law on the books.
[00:29:28.105 --> 00:29:29.645]  He's not doing anything outrageous.
[00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:32.346]  The mainstream media is completely mischaracterizing him.
[00:29:32.766 --> 00:29:34.987]  It's been an epic week for small businesses.
[00:29:35.027 --> 00:29:39.808]  He wants to jumpstart the economy, remove and strip, you know, these needless regulations.
[00:29:39.928 --> 00:29:43.068]  And the man has practically done this before lunch today, by the way.
[00:29:43.108 --> 00:29:49.190]  You know, the stimulation and this pipeline, whether you agree with it or not, you know, it does have a lot of controversy.
[00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.210]  We love the earth.
[00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.811]  We don't want to see the earth go to you-know-what.
[00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:56.994]  But the fact of the matter is we're talking about 28,000 people that are not employed or underemployed.
[00:29:57.214 --> 00:29:59.955]  They're going to be able to stand on their own two feet and feed their kids.
[00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:04.398]  This is a big deal for hurting people in this area who don't have any money.
[00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:04.398]  28,000.
[00:30:04.578 --> 00:30:06.779]  We're talking about good jobs.
[00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.700]  These are not Starbucks jobs, people.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.861]  These are good jobs.
[00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:11.542]  Most of them are in construction.
[00:30:11.942 --> 00:30:14.824]  We know that those are well-paid jobs with benefits.
[00:30:15.644 --> 00:30:17.785]  And, uh, you know, I got my hats off to him.
[00:30:17.805 --> 00:30:21.506]  I know we're, we're supposed to hold the leadership, uh, their feet to the fire, so to speak.
[00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:28.709]  I've never been more proud of my country than I am in this moment because we finally have somebody that's working for the American people.
[00:30:29.229 --> 00:30:40.194]  On tomorrow's agenda, we could see a SCOTUS appointment and that is incredibly significant because we know that Barack Obama, he, he tried to throw up someone at the, at the 11th hour.
[00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:43.495]  They've been holding onto Scalia's seat and, uh,
[00:30:43.715 --> 00:30:46.516]  We could see a historic move being made tomorrow as well.
[00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:47.776]  He's not wasting any time.
[00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:48.416]  Day 11.
[00:30:49.076 --> 00:30:54.638]  And when he looks at the Dakota pipeline and the wall, I think that jobs is what's on his mind.
[00:30:54.678 --> 00:30:59.719]  I think that that's why he says, I'm getting the pipeline done, I'm getting the wall done because it's going to create jobs.
[00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:05.581]  And thankfully for all the people that have been protesting the pipeline and, you know, standing up for Mother Earth, guess what?
[00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:08.922]  They are not going to do anything
[00:31:09.662 --> 00:31:11.642]  That is going to harm the Earth when they build this thing.
[00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:17.104]  They're going to take every measurement to avoid as much damage to planet Earth when they do this thing because of all those protests.
[00:31:17.144 --> 00:31:18.444]  At least that's what you would assume.
[00:31:18.484 --> 00:31:19.764]  Now, again, we'll find out.
[00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:27.106]  But, hey, even with the wall, I think if you just follow the law, let border control do their job, then you don't need a wall.
[00:31:27.146 --> 00:31:28.827]  I've never been a big fan of the wall.
[00:31:28.847 --> 00:31:30.787]  But again, I think Donald Trump looks at like, hey, you know what?
[00:31:30.827 --> 00:31:32.267]  This will increase border security.
[00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:33.668]  It will produce jobs.
[00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:35.868]  I'm going to get the American people back to work.
[00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:38.589]  And that's why he signed these other executive orders.
[00:31:38.809 --> 00:31:42.873]  And another thing though, real quick, that's non-partisan, he's keeping his promises!
[00:31:43.774 --> 00:31:44.234]  That's a fact!
[00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:48.098]  He absolutely is keeping the promises to the American people that he made.
[00:31:48.358 --> 00:31:56.805]  And he's using American steel, folks, that's what he's calling for with this pipeline, which means that we're going to be buying American products and using them here in America.
[00:31:56.866 --> 00:31:58.227]  What a revolutionary idea!
[00:31:59.288 --> 00:32:06.115]  I couldn't be happier about the direction that he's taking the federal agencies, the direction relieving the regulatory burdens and trimming the fat.
[00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:13.282]  You know, we've been so disgusted with Washington, the wasteful spending that comes out of these massive defunct bureaucratic arms.
[00:32:13.763 --> 00:32:15.425]  They're like, you know, the goblin!
[00:32:15.945 --> 00:32:16.145]  I think?
[00:32:45.888 --> 00:32:51.038]  Donald Trump is like a Tasmanian devil in chief with everything he's able to accomplish.
[00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:55.786]  But he's keeping his promise to the people that elected him, and that is undeniable.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.436]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.837 --> 00:36:49.557]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:49.937 --> 00:36:51.178]  Two hundred dollars.
[00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.401]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:55.181]  It's amazing.
[00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:15.915]  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is a combat veteran with two tours of Iraq under her belt and she's been a very outspoken US politician pushing for peace in Syria.
[00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:18.597]  So she decided to put her money where her mouth is.
[00:37:18.717 --> 00:37:28.324]  She actually took a secret fact-finding mission to Syria earlier this month where she spoke directly with the Syrian people on the ground and she also happened to get an impromptu meeting
[00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:31.146]  With Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:37:31.566 --> 00:37:35.569]  Now, on Wednesday, Gabbard went to speak to CNN's Jake Tapper.
[00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:37.731]  She defended her decision to go to Syria.
[00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:41.193]  She defended her decision to meet with the President of Syria.
[00:37:41.673 --> 00:37:45.516]  And she also dared to criticize the U.S.'
[00:37:45.476 --> 00:37:50.940]  's policy of funding and arming terrorists that are affiliated with al-Qaeda on national television.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.562]  Now, the congresswoman, she was smart about this, okay?
[00:37:53.582 --> 00:37:57.485]  So she documented her conversations with these ordinary Syrians
[00:37:57.805 --> 00:38:08.925]  So you could see for yourself what they were saying to her, but she documented this trip and she says that she heard some things that were very different than from what the mainstream media has been pushing about Syria.
[00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:28.405]  Why is it that the United States, its allies, and other countries are providing support, are providing arms to terrorist groups like al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, Arar al-Sham, ISIS, who are on the ground there raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing the Syrian people.
[00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:31.848]  Children, men, women, people of all ages.
[00:38:32.248 --> 00:38:38.093]  They asked me, why is the United States and its allies supporting these terrorist groups who are destroying Syria?
[00:38:38.453 --> 00:38:45.704]  So immediately, Jake Tapper cuts her off and has to go back to towing President Obama's imaginary red line.
[00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:51.814]  Obviously, the United States government denies providing any sort of help to the terrorist groups that you're talking about.
[00:38:51.834 --> 00:38:54.736]  They say they provide help for the rebel groups.
[00:38:54.756 --> 00:39:00.741]  Tell us more about... The reality is, Jake, the reality is, and I'm glad you brought up that point, because this is an often talked about thing.
[00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:05.625]  Every place that I went, every person that I spoke to, I asked this question to them.
[00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:09.468]  And without hesitation, they said, there are no moderate rebels.
[00:39:09.528 --> 00:39:12.911]  Who are these moderate rebels that people keep speaking of?
[00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:13.751]  Exactly.
[00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:15.452]  Who are these moderate rebels?
[00:39:15.552 --> 00:39:17.032]  There are no moderate rebels.
[00:39:17.092 --> 00:39:18.193]  They do not exist.
[00:39:18.253 --> 00:39:24.654]  We have been reporting on this for years, pointing out the fact that these so-called moderate rebels have been defecting to ISIS.
[00:39:25.035 --> 00:39:29.416]  They say that ISIS is the group that's in power there on the ground or whatever other
[00:39:29.676 --> 00:39:29.896]  I think?
[00:39:50.063 --> 00:39:50.123]  And
[00:40:08.234 --> 00:40:10.756]  They are bashing her left and right.
[00:40:11.336 --> 00:40:19.022]  She talks about the fact that this regime change is what has led to this mass refugee crisis, not only in Syria, but in other countries as well.
[00:40:19.642 --> 00:40:26.026]  You know, when Hillary Clinton and President Obama wanted to take out Gaddafi, for instance, or of course, starting with Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
[00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:32.311]  So a lot of this regime change is counterintuitive to what America really would desire there in the Middle East.
[00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:33.852]  But this is the problem.
[00:40:33.912 --> 00:40:35.293]  The protesters don't see that.
[00:40:35.373 --> 00:40:47.242]  They just think that Donald Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobic, mini-Hitler for imposing this travel ban because he's making this decision having to clean up the mess that was created.
[00:40:47.562 --> 00:40:53.367]  So instead of looking at Tulsi Gabbard's fact-finding mission as enlightening and important,
[00:40:53.687 --> 00:40:55.689]  They're going out of their way to bash her.
[00:40:56.069 --> 00:41:04.496]  We have the mainstream media, the pundits, these officials, they're all coming out attacking her, trying to smear her trip and also bury this story altogether.
[00:41:04.896 --> 00:41:12.683]  So immediately the Daily Beast comes out slamming her with the headline, Tulsi Gabbard's fascist escorts to Syria.
[00:41:13.483 --> 00:41:13.824]  I don't know.
[00:41:28.454 --> 00:41:28.654]  I think?
[00:41:44.921 --> 00:41:48.984]  Simply because RT ran a story about the trip that she took.
[00:41:49.044 --> 00:41:51.525]  So now all of a sudden she's a Putin stooge again.
[00:41:52.026 --> 00:42:01.652]  And then Washington Post comes out with this article saying that her trip undermines Washington's broader policy deliberations about how to approach Syria.
[00:42:01.712 --> 00:42:12.599]  So she dared to go there by herself and see with her own eyes that what President Obama, what former Secretary of State John Kerry was saying about what was going on in Syria.
[00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:13.359]  It wasn't true.
[00:42:13.819 --> 00:42:14.539]  It wasn't true.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:21.901]  And so the establishment media is freaking out, trying to toe that red line, because they would rather people not know that the U.S.
[00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:27.383]  is arming terrorists, no, I'm sorry, moderate rebels, arming them to the teeth.
[00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:35.905]  These are people who are raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing the Syrian people, destroying their country, because those groups are working to overthrow Assad.
[00:42:36.585 --> 00:42:38.967]  So it's kind of the enemy of my enemy is my friend there.
[00:42:39.047 --> 00:42:40.407]  That's something that the globalists want.
[00:42:40.447 --> 00:42:49.833]  So they're willing to overlook what those groups are doing to the Syrian people and then lie to you and I about how our taxpayer dollars are being spent to push this regime change.
[00:42:50.313 --> 00:43:00.259]  And they're also going to try and make you and I feel guilty about not opening up our country's borders for these refugees when it's these policies that are creating the refugees.
[00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:01.820]  They don't want to talk to you about that.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.921]  They don't want to tell you the truth.
[00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:10.278]  The Syrian people want us to stop bombing the hell out of their country and arming and funding these terrorist groups that are doing just the same.
[00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:21.989]  So as Tulsi Gabbard said, by visiting herself and speaking directly with the Syrian people, she says, our counterproductive regime change war does not serve America's interests.
[00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.652]  It doesn't serve anyone's interests around the globe.
[00:43:24.972 --> 00:43:29.279]  Who is worried about this refugee crisis, worrying about the safety, their national security.
[00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.082]  It's very counterproductive.
[00:43:31.663 --> 00:43:40.076]  And you'll recall earlier this month, Tulsi Gabbard actually introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, which would prohibit the US government
[00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:55.741]  So this is someone who's very passionate about bringing peace to Syria.
[00:43:56.062 --> 00:43:58.382]  She's willing to put her money where her mouth is.
[00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:01.303]  She's willing to take the trip, get on the ground with the Syrian people.
[00:44:01.924 --> 00:44:08.566]  But the Washington Post and all the other people there in the mainstream establishment that are toeing the line for the globalists
[00:44:08.886 --> 00:44:25.764]  They want to smear her and smear someone who, when you stop trying to go to the left-right divide and see what is it that we can all agree on, I think we can all agree on stopping war and ending these endless wars that President Obama has had us in for every year of his presidency.
[00:44:26.385 --> 00:44:36.067]  This is something that we can all agree on and yet the establishment mouthpieces will say that it is undermining Washington's approach on how to deal with Syria.
[00:44:36.447 --> 00:44:38.288]  Absolutely insane, but this is the truth.
[00:44:38.448 --> 00:44:39.388]  This is what you need to know.
[00:44:39.448 --> 00:44:52.291]  This is what you're only going to find out here at InfoWars.com or from great people like Tulsi Gabbard who are not afraid to go out on national television and let Washington know that they're doing it wrong and the American taxpayers need to wake up.
[00:44:57.853 --> 00:45:05.939]  Trending at Info Wars right now, doctors are being told not to use the words expectant mothers to avoid offending transgenders.
[00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:09.702]  That's right, now the preferred nomenclature is pregnant people.
[00:45:10.163 --> 00:45:15.647]  This is according to a newly issued 14-page booklet that was released by the British Medical Association.
[00:45:16.147 --> 00:45:21.211]  It's entitled, A Guide to Effective Communication, Inclusive Language in the Workplace.
[00:45:21.371 --> 00:45:24.994]  This calls on doctors to refrain from using the term expectant mother
[00:45:25.526 --> 00:45:27.868]  Despite its biological accuracy.
[00:45:28.268 --> 00:45:30.490]  Now this is after one case.
[00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.554]  The union advised this after just one British woman who was transitioning to become a man.
[00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:38.917]  She put her gender reassignment operation on hold to have a baby.
[00:45:38.957 --> 00:45:44.562]  So because of this one case in the UK where the official figures show approximately 775,000 women give birth every single year.
[00:45:44.582 --> 00:45:45.943]  Now because of this one case,
[00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:52.643]  They are no longer allowed to say expectant mothers.
[00:45:52.743 --> 00:45:54.807]  They have to say pregnant people.
[00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:57.331]  This is, you know, in celebration of diversity.
[00:45:57.431 --> 00:45:59.715]  So the booklet says, a large majority of people...
[00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.194]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:06.675 --> 00:46:10.356]  Every single person on this planet who has given birth is a woman.
[00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:14.178]  You don't have to identify as a woman in order to have a baby.
[00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:15.319]  This is what women do.
[00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:16.459]  It's our biology.
[00:46:16.819 --> 00:46:21.582]  But now, this is, you know, you have to be a sinus at birth, not born a woman at birth.
[00:46:22.922 --> 00:46:30.964]  We can include intersex men and trans men who may get pregnant by saying pregnant people instead of expectant mothers.
[00:46:31.384 --> 00:46:41.886]  So this booklet also describes the terms being born male and born female as offensive as well because they say it's reductive and oversimplifies a very complex subject of course.
[00:46:42.406 --> 00:46:45.067]  So now doctors are advised to refer to the
[00:46:46.187 --> 00:46:51.490]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.061]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.081 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.687 --> 00:49:20.084]  We are living in the most hyper-partisan, polarized political times, maybe in United States history, and I think the Donald Trump travel ban is a perfect illustration of this.
[00:49:22.427 --> 00:49:25.868]  News would have you believe that this is Donald Trump's doing.
[00:49:26.488 --> 00:49:31.129]  I would argue differently that this is the television news media's doing.
[00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:33.249]  But let's just break this down.
[00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:36.670]  Now this is a very complex situation that we're dealing with.
[00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:44.272]  This is not a black and white issue which is one of the big problems that people are dealing with when trying to cover Donald Trump.
[00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:45.152]  They look at everything
[00:49:45.552 --> 00:49:49.096]  through a black and white lens, missing the gray areas.
[00:49:49.396 --> 00:49:57.225]  Now, before I talk about the travel ban and everything that happened after Donald Trump announced it, I want to wind the clocks back.
[00:49:57.305 --> 00:50:01.289]  Let's try to get a hold on the overarching picture here.
[00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:03.872]  Now, this is a story out of New Jersey.
[00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:04.975]  In
[00:50:22.222 --> 00:50:35.005]  After his arrest in July that he had killed Tevlin and a trio of men in the Seattle area as vengeance for lives lost due to US military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and other parts of the Islamic world.
[00:50:35.385 --> 00:50:41.006]  He was quoted saying all these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government, so a life for a life.
[00:50:41.066 --> 00:50:41.986]  Again, this is actually from 2015.
[00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:42.746]  So here's the thing.
[00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:56.276]  We have been talking about the United States foreign policy and interfering in the Middle East and the wrongdoings that have been going on there for a long time.
[00:50:57.017 --> 00:50:59.721]  We've been on the right side of history here.
[00:51:01.636 --> 00:51:12.542]  So you can sit here and try to justify, perhaps, that's what this murderer is doing, justifying his actions by the United States interference overseas.
[00:51:13.183 --> 00:51:24.069]  So, if there are people who are mad at us overseas who hate our way of life because of the wrongdoings we've done over there, don't you think that they might want to come here and try to commit acts of evil?
[00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.932]  Isn't that what we've been trying to fight against for so long?
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:47.143]  Now the story goes on and it talks about how Brown shot the guy eight times with two other men and the other men have gotten away so we don't know what happened to them so we don't know if this is some other thing going on or if this is just a lone wolf but the point is
[00:51:48.424 --> 00:51:53.550]  People from these regions have beefs with the United States government, folks, okay?
[00:51:54.331 --> 00:51:58.757]  And they want to kill innocent American citizens.
[00:51:59.117 --> 00:52:01.120]  So now let's get to the travel ban.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:07.328]  And again, this is just an absolute twister of information to try to hash this all out.
[00:52:07.828 --> 00:52:09.990]  So Donald Trump issues the travel ban.
[00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:17.498]  He goes off the seven states that Barack Obama is actually the one who said that these were the states where terrorists might try to come here.
[00:52:17.938 --> 00:52:18.839]  But guess what?
[00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:27.908]  The left freaks out at Donald Trump for going through with Obama's actual seven countries listed as terrorists who might want to come here.
[00:52:28.208 --> 00:52:36.160]  But again, it goes back to our terrible foreign policies of the Bush administration and beyond that Donald Trump called out for a long time.
[00:52:36.481 --> 00:52:38.804]  So this has been a long time coming now.
[00:52:40.387 --> 00:52:41.368]  They're saying.
[00:52:42.748 --> 00:52:49.453]  That Donald Trump's travel ban is not going to do anything to stop terror attacks in the United States.
[00:52:49.493 --> 00:52:50.974]  Well, here's the thing about that.
[00:52:51.474 --> 00:52:52.475]  There's a couple things about that.
[00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:57.198]  But they go on and they say, oh well, there's never been any terrorists that came to the United States from these countries.
[00:52:57.598 --> 00:52:59.339]  Well, that's not exactly true.
[00:52:59.779 --> 00:53:03.582]  There have been terrorists that traveled throughout those countries and ended up back here.
[00:53:03.802 --> 00:53:07.525]  That doesn't mean they just came directly from that country or were an immigrant from that country.
[00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:12.048]  But they constantly cite nobody ever coming from Somalia
[00:53:12.808 --> 00:53:13.689]  But that's not true.
[00:53:13.909 --> 00:53:19.995]  The OSU shooter, the Ohio State shooter, Arton, came from Somalia.
[00:53:21.336 --> 00:53:21.957]  So there you go.
[00:53:22.277 --> 00:53:23.818]  But look at what's going on in Europe.
[00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:25.940]  That's what the people aren't seeing.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:32.907]  Donald Trump is trying to avoid what has already happened in Europe with their open border policy.
[00:53:33.749 --> 00:53:34.729]  But here's the thing, folks.
[00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:41.911]  The protesters aren't complaining about the fact that Donald Trump hasn't stopped people traveling in from Saudi Arabia.
[00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:55.954]  The protesters aren't complaining that Saudi Arabia could easily take all, I mean, maybe not all the refugees, but probably a million of these refugees from these war-torn countries who have been working hand-in-hand with the leadership in the United States to tear that region apart.
[00:53:56.494 --> 00:54:00.097]  But, again, the protesters are not going to protest that.
[00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:02.198]  Now here's also a development, kind of a side note here.
[00:54:02.619 --> 00:54:10.304]  CNN, and they're now running with this time and time again, is now admitting that the 9-11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:10.344 --> 00:54:18.410]  This is something that has been ignored by the mainstream media for over a decade now, and now finally they want to talk about it.
[00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:20.132]  But, again,
[00:54:21.246 --> 00:54:44.984]  So if it's not people who hate, and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around their logic, if it's not people who hate the United States that are traveling here, so that's Islamophobic, the travel ban doesn't work because nobody's trying to travel here, nobody in the Middle East hates us, okay so let's go with the leftist logic apparently that that is, well then why are these terrorist attacks happening?
[00:54:46.786 --> 00:54:49.188]  It must be religious.
[00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.010]  So now, what are you?
[00:54:52.671 --> 00:54:53.591]  An Islamophobe?
[00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:58.372]  See, the liberal logic, it's like a hamster in a wheel.
[00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:01.433]  They're gonna keep running and running and running, but they're never gonna get anywhere.
[00:55:01.953 --> 00:55:02.834]  But let's try to move on.
[00:55:04.374 --> 00:55:12.117]  Now, Barack Obama says that American values are at stake, and he's actually heartened by the resistance to Donald Trump.
[00:55:12.157 --> 00:55:15.157]  Now, I find this, again, terribly ironic, folks.
[00:55:16.258 --> 00:55:19.379]  If I go out on the streets, what happens to me?
[00:55:20.359 --> 00:55:28.829]  Protestors scream at me telling me I'm a white male and that my opinion needs to be silenced because that's what American values have been, right?
[00:55:29.269 --> 00:55:30.371]  It's just the white male.
[00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:32.253]  That's the American values that need to go.
[00:55:32.273 --> 00:55:33.434]  Oh, but wait!
[00:55:34.255 --> 00:55:38.560]  Here they are complaining that the American values are at stake because of Donald Trump!
[00:55:39.401 --> 00:55:40.943]  So, I'm just confused.
[00:55:41.223 --> 00:55:43.085]  Is it the white male American values?
[00:55:43.125 --> 00:55:44.266]  Are you standing up for them now?
[00:55:45.087 --> 00:55:48.850]  Or are you saying there's too many white males, we need to bring everyone in here from a different country?
[00:55:49.211 --> 00:55:50.152]  I don't know what they're saying.
[00:55:50.292 --> 00:55:51.893]  I don't think they know what they're saying.
[00:55:52.174 --> 00:55:53.455]  They just want to go protest.
[00:55:53.995 --> 00:56:00.742]  So, they're upset that American values are at stake, but they hate the American values that apparently are nothing but white males.
[00:56:01.182 --> 00:56:03.184]  Again, this is just the liberal logic.
[00:56:04.642 --> 00:56:06.964]  Where to go, I'm telling you folks, this whole thing is crazy.
[00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:08.345]  Now here's the other thing about this.
[00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:14.349]  If you look at the polls, it's a clear support of Donald Trump in the travel ban.
[00:56:14.429 --> 00:56:15.189]  It's not even close.
[00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:20.193]  Rasmussen poll, clear majority of Americans support Trump's travel ban.
[00:56:20.573 --> 00:56:24.596]  Rasmussen poll finds 57% of Americans support Trump's travel ban.
[00:56:24.956 --> 00:56:26.817]  Only 33% oppose the measure.
[00:56:27.198 --> 00:56:30.000]  And that's actually pretty close to the overall
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.361]  We're good to go.
[00:56:43.018 --> 00:56:46.361]  The world is in a state of emergency, okay?
[00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:48.582]  Donald Trump recognizes that.
[00:56:48.822 --> 00:56:52.485]  Donald Trump isn't sitting around here acting like everything is okay, everything is awesome.
[00:56:52.845 --> 00:56:56.668]  Donald Trump realizes what's going on, so he's gonna have to take some drastic measures, folks.
[00:56:56.989 --> 00:57:03.433]  Whether you like the travel ban or not, he's taking drastic measures because he realizes that we are truly in a state of emergency.
[00:57:03.834 --> 00:57:05.395]  Why do we have all these refugees?
[00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.498]  Because the Middle East is in a state of emergency.
[00:57:07.819 --> 00:57:12.045]  Why is Europe being completely torn down by refugees?
[00:57:12.246 --> 00:57:13.968]  Well, because they have an open border policy.
[00:57:14.209 --> 00:57:19.197]  So Donald Trump is actually trying to address these things before they reach our home front.
[00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:22.093]  Whether you like that or not is up to you.
[00:57:22.413 --> 00:57:24.535]  But that is the reality of the measure.
[00:57:24.995 --> 00:57:31.601]  And when the mainstream media tries to tell you, well, he's racist, or he's like Hitler, this, that, and the other thing, give me a break, folks.
[00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:32.962]  This is a state of emergency.
[00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:37.666]  Donald Trump is trying to do something about all the chaos and all the corruption that we're seeing in the world.
[00:57:37.706 --> 00:57:39.467]  Now, of course, on the heels of all this,
[00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:44.732]  In Canada, we had a terrorist attack on a mosque.
[00:57:44.852 --> 00:57:47.794]  Now this is drumming up all types of conspiracy.
[00:57:47.914 --> 00:57:52.997]  Originally, of course, two shooters enter the mosque and masks and start firing.
[00:57:55.638 --> 00:58:02.063]  That was the original story, and one of the people that was brought in as a suspect was of Arab descent, the other one was Canadian.
[00:58:02.503 --> 00:58:10.310]  Well, now, they're taking it back, and the only suspect is the Canadian, and the man of Arab descent is no longer a suspect.
[00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:15.694]  So, we'll see what they try to set this up with, but people are already looking at this as a false flag.
[00:58:15.894 --> 00:58:20.518]  And I just want to say this, Justin Trudeau came out and said, make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack.
[00:58:21.283 --> 00:58:28.644]  And of course it ends up being a Canadian national, but if Donald Trump had jumped to that conclusion after a terrorist attack in the United States, they would be all over him, folks.
[00:58:29.898 --> 00:58:38.046]  And it's also worth noting that you're seeing CAIR, this Council for American-Islamic Relations, all over the news now.
[00:58:38.466 --> 00:58:40.368]  The government traced them back to Hamas.
[00:58:41.249 --> 00:58:43.972]  This is a report that you can find at the Center for Security Policy.
[00:58:44.032 --> 00:58:46.394]  So, is CAIR a front for Hamas?
[00:58:46.414 --> 00:58:47.135]  You decide for yourself.
[00:58:47.395 --> 00:58:49.577]  And here's the joke that the protesters will never know.
[00:58:49.918 --> 00:58:54.002]  Saudi Arabian prince buys 80 plane tickets for his pet birds!
[00:58:54.522 --> 00:58:56.871]  His pet birds could have been refugees on that plane.

[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
