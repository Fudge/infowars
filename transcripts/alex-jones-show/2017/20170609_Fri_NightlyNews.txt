[00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:21.299]  It's Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.642]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer, and here's what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:44.816]  Tonight, less than a week after his tweet labeling President Donald Trump a piece of s***, foul-mouthed CNN host Riza Aslan is out of here, as CNN has finally made the decision to let him go.
[00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:54.322]  Well, I think it's a terrible idea.
[00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:58.485]  I think that it's one of the worst things he's done so far.
[00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:01.588]  It's pretty messed up, not surprising, but yeah.
[00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:03.693]  It's on the wrong side of history.
[00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.695]  I just think we're going backwards as a country.
[00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:07.856]  You know, he's not looking to the future.
[00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:12.941]  Where we're children of the 60s, where there was hope, now there's no hope.
[00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:17.705]  And you'll never believe what Donald Trump just said about the Comey testimony.
[00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:22.509]  You'll find out up next on the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.881]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.462]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:56.666]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic

[00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:08.655]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.

[00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:23.103]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:02.601]  I don't think I will have a career after this.
[00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:07.047]  I think he... I think he... I think he... I'm gonna be honest.
[00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:07.568]  He broke me.
[00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.930]  He broke me.
[00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:11.814]  He broke...
[00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:14.798]  And then I was like, no, this isn't right.
[00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:16.098]  It's just not right.
[00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:19.859]  And I apologized because that was the right thing to do, and I meant it.
[00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:29.082]  And then I saw the tide turning, and I saw what they were doing, and I went, oh, okay, they're trying to spin this, and they're making it about Barron, and obviously that was never my intent.
[00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:33.423]  I would never want to hurt anyone, much less a child, but I started to see what was really happening.
[00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.204]  And then it was a mom mentality pile-on.
[00:03:36.124 --> 00:03:41.208]  And so many people have expressed to me personally across the country at my shows, they're scared.
[00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.272]  So yeah, I don't know what's, I don't know if I'm going to get arrested today.
[00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:45.932]  I don't know.
[00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:47.794]  But I have to stand up.
[00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:51.797]  What do you think about being on fire right now?
[00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:52.798]  It's hurtful to me.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.420]  Wow.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.881]  Tough to watch.
[00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:59.544]  There is J Edgar Comey.
[00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:00.885]  Broken.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.321]  By President Donald Trump.
[00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:04.682]  I mean, you saw the video, folks.
[00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:13.967]  J. Edgar Comey just brought to tears, really barely even able to get through that speech, J. Edgar Comey.
[00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:27.895]  Of course, that was a comical piece of the besieged Kathy Griffin, who is now fired from the dying CNN, who can't even beat out reruns of old news shows.
[00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.156]  They can't even crack the top 20.
[00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:31.837]  Of course.
[00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:55.719]  Let's go to actually a highlight clip of the Comey testimony that was.
[00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:01.344]  We have boiled it down to what we believe are the top highlights, the top moments from the Comey hearing.
[00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:02.786]  Go ahead and roll that clip, guys.
[00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:21.091]  Did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice?
[00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:21.751]  Yes.
[00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:23.612]  That's illegal.
[00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:25.214]  And to whom did you show copies?
[00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:29.095]  And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square.
[00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:34.039]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:40.023]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:42.985]  So I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:46.628]  You told the President I would see what we could do.
[00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:47.068]  Illegally!
[00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:48.249]  What did you mean?
[00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.471]  I was kind of a...
[00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:53.545]  The decision to publicly go out with your results on the email
[00:06:15.523 --> 00:06:21.769]  Was your decision influenced by the Attorney General's Tarmac meeting with the former President Bill Clinton?
[00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:22.790]  Which also was illegal?
[00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.333]  Yes, in an ultimately conclusive way.
[00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:27.915]  That was the thing that kept it from me.
[00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:30.237]  So the illegal meeting influenced your decision?
[00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:31.759]  Probably the only other consideration.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.302]  I guess I can talk about an open setting is that at one point the Attorney General... I'll tell you later.
[00:06:36.322 --> 00:06:37.283]  I'll tell you in a closed setting.
[00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:40.945]  ...investigation, but instead to call it a matter... Maybe when I'm not on oath.
[00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.927]  So on the cloud, we keep talking about this cloud, you perceive the cloud to be... So that's fine.
[00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:46.169]  I'll tell you the truth about Loretta Lynch when I'm not under oath.
[00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.589]  That's nice.
[00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:47.329]  Yes, sir.
[00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.313]  But this specific ask... Now, little Marco ends up being the biggest one of all.
[00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:58.757]  ...what you had already told the leaders of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, that he was not personally under investigation.
[00:06:59.337 --> 00:06:59.597]  Yes, sir.
[00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:01.879]  In fact, he was asking you to do what you have done here today.
[00:07:02.386 --> 00:07:02.606]  Correct.
[00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:02.926]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:03.526]  Okay.
[00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:13.410]  And just to be clear, for you to make a public statement that he was not under investigation would not have been illegal, but you felt it made no sense because it could potentially create a duty to correct.
[00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.710]  Yeah.
[00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:23.533]  He didn't want to release that because he was afraid that it would interfere with the investigation he's doing, even though it would have been evidence in the investigation he was doing.
[00:07:23.613 --> 00:07:25.454]  It's complete madness!
[00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.496]  He's already admitted he's broken the law twice.
[00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:31.176]  Fairly.
[00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:40.798]  And number three, can you please tell the American people what these leaders in Congress already know, what you already know, what you've told me three times, that I'm not personally under investigation?
[00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:42.959]  Those are the three things he asked.
[00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.299]  Yes, sir.
[00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.220]  You know, this investigation is full of leaks left and right.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.040]  I mean, we've learned more from these people.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.620]  Marco Rubio.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.201]  Lil Marco, bigger than seven foot tall Jim Comey.
[00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:55.482]  You ever wonder why, of all the things in this investigation, the only thing that's never been leaked?
[00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:56.252]  Is
[00:08:15.464 --> 00:08:27.779]  He asked what we could do to quote-unquote lift the cloud, the general Russia investigation, and you responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could and that there would be great benefit if we didn't find anything to having done the work well.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.941]  And he agreed.
[00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.242]  He re-emphasized the problems it was causing him, but he agreed.
[00:08:32.462 --> 00:08:39.545]  So in essence, the President agreed with your statement that it would be great if we could have an investigation, all the facts came out, and we found nothing.
[00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:45.548]  So he agreed that that would be ideal, but this cloud is still messing up my ability to do the rest of my agenda.
[00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:47.068]  Is that an accurate assessment?
[00:08:47.148 --> 00:08:47.429]  Yes, sir.
[00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:48.549]  He actually went farther than that.
[00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:53.011]  He said, and if some of my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that out.
[00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.413]  Well that's the second part, and that is the satellites.
[00:08:55.433 --> 00:09:02.219]  He said if one of my satellites, I imagine by that he meant some of the other people surrounding his campaign did something wrong, it would be great to know that as well.
[00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:03.820]  Yes sir, that's what he said.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.886]  I hope, this is the President speaking, I hope you can see your way through letting this go.
[00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:11.907]  He is a good guy.
[00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:14.850]  I hope you can let this go.
[00:09:15.632 --> 00:09:16.993]  Now those are his exact words.
[00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:17.633]  Is that correct?
[00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:18.014]  Correct.
[00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:19.255]  That is according to Comey.
[00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:21.296]  Trump today denied that.
[00:09:22.217 --> 00:09:24.098]  Trump today said that that is not true.
[00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:25.619]  He did not direct you to let it go.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.122]  Which then brings up the conversation of the tapes again.
[00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:30.779]  He did not order you to do it.
[00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:31.539]  Not in his words.
[00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:33.860]  Again, those words are not in order.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.881]  And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction.
[00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:45.442]  I mean, as the President of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:47.622]  But you weren't there to investigate him.
[00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:49.302]  And as you perceived it.
[00:09:49.342 --> 00:09:50.843]  So why did you take it that way?
[00:09:50.903 --> 00:09:52.423]  You weren't there to do an investigation.
[00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:57.384]  You were just having a meeting, which actually you called, you scheduled it, and then you said Trump scheduled it.
[00:09:57.904 --> 00:09:58.084]  Yes.
[00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:04.487]  Do you believe that you were fired because you refused to take the President's direction?
[00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:05.588]  Is that the ultimate reason?
[00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:07.048]  I don't know for sure.
[00:10:07.328 --> 00:10:08.189]  I know I was fired.
[00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:11.250]  Even though he already said that the President didn't give him that direction.
[00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.692]  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation.
[00:10:14.712 --> 00:10:17.113]  You were wasting our time.
[00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:18.353]  You were wasting energy.
[00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:19.274]  It's irritating all of us.
[00:10:22.615 --> 00:10:30.141]  For the Attorney General, or if she had recused herself, which she did not do, for the Deputy Attorney General to appoint a special counsel.
[00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:32.622]  That's essentially what's happened now with Director Mueller.
[00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:36.905]  Would that have been an appropriate step in the Clinton email investigation in your opinion?
[00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:38.467]  Certainly a possible step, yes sir.
[00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:41.028]  And were you aware that Ms.
[00:10:41.088 --> 00:10:45.652]  Lynch had been requested numerous times to appoint a special counsel and had refused?
[00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:51.062]  Yes, from, I think, members of Congress had repeatedly asked.
[00:10:51.102 --> 00:10:54.503]  Speaking of collusion... Clinton and Lynch, huh?
[00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:59.725]  Apparently told me too because he was aware of it and did nothing, so he's in there too.
[00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:15.130]  ...of a conflict of interest with the Department of Justice which caused you to make what you have described as an incredibly painful decision to basically take the matter up yourself and led to that July press conference.
[00:11:16.035 --> 00:11:16.336]  Yes, sir.
[00:11:16.436 --> 00:11:19.480]  I can say, after the President Clinton, former President Clinton,
[00:11:20.325 --> 00:11:24.668]  You didn't because Loretta Lynch told you not to because Clinton told her to tell you not to.
[00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:29.972]  He knew there was no case there even though he indicted Hillary Clinton in his formal hearing before saying he wouldn't prosecute.
[00:11:49.882 --> 00:11:59.606]  You talked with us shortly after February 14th when the New York Times wrote an article that suggested that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians.
[00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:02.187]  You remember reading that article when it first came out?
[00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:02.527]  I do.
[00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:05.908]  It was about allegedly extensive electronic surveillance.
[00:12:05.968 --> 00:12:06.308]  Correct.
[00:12:06.348 --> 00:12:07.208]  Wiretapping.
[00:12:07.468 --> 00:12:08.189]  Wiretapping.
[00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:14.491]  That upsets you to the point where you actually went out and surveyed the intelligence community to see whether you were missing something in that.
[00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:15.091]  Is that correct?
[00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:16.695]  That's correct.
[00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.577]  I want to be careful and open-sided.
[00:12:19.017 --> 00:12:21.839]  He doesn't want to lie because he knows Obama was spying on everything.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:32.908]  In addition to that, after that, you sought out both Republican and Democrat senators to tell them that, hey, I don't know where this is coming from, but this is not the case.
[00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:34.189]  This is not factual.
[00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:35.670]  Do you recall that?
[00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.872]  You mean the New York Times is inventing stuff?
[00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:44.057]  So again, so the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true.
[00:12:44.377 --> 00:12:45.198]  Is that a fair statement?
[00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:47.542]  Yeah, in the main it was not true.
[00:12:47.562 --> 00:12:48.903]  But it's still ongoing.
[00:12:49.043 --> 00:12:49.663]  In the main.
[00:12:49.843 --> 00:12:51.364]  So far as I know, it was when I left.
[00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:57.968]  That investigation was going on, this investigation is going on, you reach separate conclusions.
[00:12:57.988 --> 00:12:58.769]  John McCain!
[00:12:58.789 --> 00:12:59.689]  No, that one was done.
[00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.632]  That investigation of any involvement of Secretary Clinton or any of her associates is completed.
[00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:06.954]  Look at Comey's face, he's like, wait, this is not how we rehearsed it, what's going on?
[00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:10.283]  Oh my gosh.
[00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:11.265]  Oh my gosh.
[00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:11.765]  Oh my gosh.
[00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:14.349]  McCain is literally, he's having a senile moment right now.
[00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:14.750]  Oh my gosh.
[00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.131]  He's so confused.
[00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:26.563]  In the Russia involvement and our engagement in our election.
[00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:34.810]  I don't quite understand... See the funny thing is there's McCain slipping up and saying Clinton involved with Russia which is actually the truth!
[00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.353]  But Comey doesn't answer that because it's not how they rehearsed it and he's here to demonize Trump!
[00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:47.737]  At least when I left, when I was fired on May the 9th, there was still an open, active investigation to understand the Russian efforts and whether any Americans work with them.
[00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:54.279]  Which McCain just slipped up in his mental state, which is deteriorating, and said Clinton.
[00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:56.620]  See, this is amazing.
[00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:02.322]  McCain, in his senile bind, is actually admitting that it was Clinton.
[00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:06.104]  And Comey is sitting here like, wait a second, we're supposed to be demonizing Trump, you're blowing it.
[00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:09.025]  An ongoing investigation.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:15.822]  So you got one candidate who you're done with and another candidate that you have a long way to go.
[00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:18.483]  Is that correct?
[00:14:18.643 --> 00:14:21.304]  John McCain said that because he was up late watching a baseball game.
[00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:23.265]  How would he do that?
[00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:27.926]  Knowing it's an ongoing criminal investigation or counterintelligence investigation?
[00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:31.988]  And this is key because President Trump could have ended the investigation legally if he wanted to.
[00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:34.529]  Even though that's not what he tried to do, he could have if he wanted to.
[00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:38.030]  Or how would the President make an ongoing investigation stop?
[00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:39.760]  He's the president.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.521]  He's a scholar.
[00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:42.403]  Oh, he's not a legal scholar!
[00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:43.485]  Corporate lawyer, not a legal scholar.
[00:14:56.741 --> 00:15:01.404]  So there you go, there's the top 10 moments from the Comey hearing.
[00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:03.005]  Wow, a lot of golden nuggets there.
[00:15:03.785 --> 00:15:04.786]  Him lying.
[00:15:05.226 --> 00:15:10.190]  Him basically including Loretta Lynch into collusion with the Clintons.
[00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.392]  Him admitting he's the leaker, which is also illegal.
[00:15:13.472 --> 00:15:13.832]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:14.132 --> 00:15:23.318]  Now, here's another clip of Comey talking about what has been or what has been alleged about Russia mingling in our elections.
[00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:32.645]  There have been news accounts about the Russia investigation, about collusion, about this whole event, or accusations.
[00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:37.169]  As you read the story, you were stunned about how wrong they got the facts.
[00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:45.597]  Yes, there have been many, many stories purportedly based on classified information about lots of stuff, but especially about Russia, that are just dead wrong.
[00:15:48.996 --> 00:15:50.177]  Sorry, dead wrong.
[00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:52.338]  Nothing to see here about Russia.
[00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:53.298]  I mean, he was under oath.
[00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:55.539]  I guess he did have to tell the truth.
[00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:56.960]  That's why he admitted he was the leaker.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:06.664]  Now, while all of this was going on, while the biggest C-SPAN ratings of all time, the most watched hearing of all time of any FBI director, all eyes were on this.
[00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:12.607]  Mainstream news outlets, cable, satellite, everyone cutting their feeds to go to the Comey hearing.
[00:16:12.887 --> 00:16:16.249]  While all the madness was going on, guess what President Trump was doing?
[00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.670]  Rebuilding America!
[00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:19.831]  Here's that video.
[00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:42.550]  Today we're here to talk about how we will create the infrastructure of the future by partnering with the states and local governments.
[00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.172]  You're the stewards of the vast majority of our nation's roads and bridges and airports.
[00:16:48.853 --> 00:16:56.636]  In addition to reforming our broken permitting system, we want to partner with state and local governments to better meet the needs of our citizens.
[00:16:57.056 --> 00:17:00.398]  My budget proposal includes a massive investment in new
[00:17:00.948 --> 00:17:03.670]  Federal support for infrastructure.
[00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:12.195]  These dollars will be matched by significant private, state, and local dollars for maximum efficiency and accountability.
[00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:14.576]  Together we're going to rebuild America.
[00:17:16.717 --> 00:17:19.599]  Now, did you see any mainstream news reporting on this?
[00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:28.004]  The President put out multiple videos, actually, and multiple tweets talking about his plan to rebuild America's infrastructure.
[00:17:28.364 --> 00:17:29.905]  Did any mainstream news cover that?
[00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:33.183]  Hardly any at all.
[00:17:33.263 --> 00:17:34.724]  It was all about the Comey hearing.
[00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:37.785]  Now, the Comey hearing was very important.
[00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:52.430]  A lot came out in it, and it's still important to digest and to figure out exactly what needs to be done as a reaction to the things that James Comey said and alleged about himself and about others.
[00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:57.683]  But let's not forget what we elected President Trump to do, folks.
[00:17:58.083 --> 00:17:59.306]  And he has really come through.
[00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:04.175]  If you just look at a flash shot of what President Trump has done, how could anybody not agree with this?
[00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:05.497]  Got us out of the TPP.
[00:18:07.057 --> 00:18:16.125]  Easing the weight of NATO on our shoulders, got us out of the Paris Climate Accord, which will literally save us trillions of dollars, fired the head of the FBI!
[00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:23.892]  I could have walked around to every Bernie voter, probably most Hillary voters, mostly everybody, everybody in Antifa, five years ago.
[00:18:24.472 --> 00:18:28.553]  I could have probably asked all these people five years ago, do you think the FBI is corrupt?
[00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:32.935]  I bet you 80% of more people would say yes, the FBI is corrupt.
[00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:33.895]  What should we do?
[00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:35.495]  Fire the FBI director.
[00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:36.536]  Trump did it!
[00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:38.516]  He's draining the swamp!
[00:18:38.976 --> 00:18:42.778]  James Comey was the swamp, and he's a self-admitted coward!
[00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:50.400]  And I bet you, if he sits down one-on-one with Trump or some other hard-ass who wants to get justice against the Clintons or whoever else is trying to rob America,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.067]  He's going to sing like a bird because he's a self-admitted coward.
[00:18:54.308 --> 00:18:54.929]  Thanks, Comey.
[00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.436]  You turned a nothing burger into a Comey sandwich.
[00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:07.728]  Thanks to your support, InfoWars has been able to expand its operations against the globalists at this critical time.
[00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:15.733]  And it's absolutely essential that we expand in the face of the enemy, because as history shows, political movements only expand or contract.
[00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:19.656]  And that's why the globalists are hitting us with everything they've got.
[00:19:19.976 --> 00:19:23.579]  Censorship, demonization, attacks, misrepresentations.
[00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.640]  They're not just trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.101]  They're trying to fire Sean Hannity.
[00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:28.943]  They're trying to cold talk radio.
[00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:34.227]  They're trying to silence true, independent, nationalistic media.
[00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:38.090]  And InfoWars is at the very heart of that resistance.
[00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:49.680]  We all see the dumbed-down trendies that appear to be soulless and how they're obsessed with consumerism and criticizing capitalism as they walk around in their expensive Nike tennis shoes and have their slave-made iPhones.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.283]  So, I personally am disgusted by empty consumerism.
[00:19:54.073 --> 00:20:09.303]  But the globalists want to get rid of free markets because there is such a thing as positive consumerism historically, where people can use the power they have of the purse to actually support building free and independent economies.
[00:20:09.824 --> 00:20:13.006]  So you're not just getting amazing products when you go to InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:57.677]  We've got Brain Force, 47% off.

[00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:27.447]  In closing, we've already come this far together and we've seen the devastating effects truth has against the global crime syndicate.
[00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.008]  But the enemy's striking back.
[00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:34.650]  So again, from myself, the entire InfoWars crew, I want to salute and thank all of you.
[00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.952]  No matter what color you are or where you came from, if the love of liberty and justice beats in your heart,

[00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:50.196]  We are all brothers and sisters together in this epic experiment that is life.
[00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:52.697]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:21:53.037 --> 00:22:00.601]  Visit InfoWarsTour.com today to get some of the best deals ever offered on incredible nutraceuticals, supplements, and so much more.
[00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.604]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:22:03.764 --> 00:22:10.228]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:13.410]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:22.957]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:23.917]  Caveman.
[00:22:24.157 --> 00:22:29.161]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:31.342]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.745]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:22:34.785 --> 00:22:39.568]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:47.675]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:55.941]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:22:56.021 --> 00:23:00.685]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:23:10.668 --> 00:23:18.191]  Well, this is a rather odd piece of news, but it's a piece of news I feel I need to report over and over again.
[00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:26.154]  And take what you want from this, but it is certainly an oddity that we find these European leaders have in common.
[00:23:27.605 --> 00:23:32.187]  This was a story originally from DC Whispers, or at least that's where I first saw it.
[00:23:32.647 --> 00:23:52.074]  What do Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, Great Britain's Theresa May, Holland's Mark Root, Sweden's Stefan Löfven, Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker have in common?
[00:23:52.904 --> 00:24:02.932]  No folks, it's not that they're all the leaders of nations in Europe who want open borders and are now suffering from traumatic radical Islamic extremism.
[00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:06.795]  No, they do have that in common, but that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:13.200]  None of them, zero of them, have kids or grandkids.
[00:24:15.202 --> 00:24:16.663]  How about that?
[00:24:18.487 --> 00:24:19.428]  What are the odds of that?
[00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:27.653]  And what does that tell you about the psychology of these people, good or bad, that they don't have kids?
[00:24:28.353 --> 00:24:31.115]  And what does that tell you about their worldview?
[00:24:32.496 --> 00:24:37.639]  I think it says quite a lot, but I'll leave that judgment up to you.
[00:24:37.719 --> 00:24:44.304]  But again, all these great and powerful leaders in Europe, no family, no kids,
[00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:47.829]  No grandkids, no future lineage.
[00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:52.710]  No wonder why they don't care about your future lineage.
[00:24:53.490 --> 00:25:02.532]  Now this is actually a culture problem that is now coming to America, and that culture is anti-family.
[00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:08.133]  And one of the things they're doing that's anti-family is trying to poison the minds of our youths.
[00:25:08.933 --> 00:25:10.714]  Now this is an incredible story.
[00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:16.255]  That really just kind of makes your eyes pop and wonder what the heck is going on.
[00:25:17.076 --> 00:25:25.619]  Eight-year-old boy, Ethan, learns to become an LGBT drag queen makeup artist.
[00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:27.779]  Now, this is a young boy.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:36.703]  You look into this and really, folks, what the sad truth of this is, is that this boy's mother does not care.
[00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:39.339]  About anything except herself.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.960]  And we'll see that as I play some of these videos.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:50.082]  But you would first ask yourself, what parent in their right mind would ever do this to their child?
[00:25:51.362 --> 00:25:52.643]  Let's go ahead and roll this video.
[00:25:52.923 --> 00:25:53.803]  And you know what, guys?
[00:25:54.503 --> 00:25:58.844]  When we were rolling this video, everybody else back there was sickened by this too.
[00:25:58.884 --> 00:26:03.585]  So if you guys want to comment while we roll this video, you guys back in the control room, have your mics open too.
[00:26:03.925 --> 00:26:07.026]  Look at this sick, disgusting trash that they're forcing this kid to do.
[00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:12.858]  This is an eight-year-old boy at a drag queen show.
[00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:14.518]  Um, Lactasia?
[00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:15.859]  Lactasia!
[00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:17.559]  His mother named him Lactasia.
[00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:18.140]  How about that?
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.760]  Adorable Lactasia!
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.061]  And then this drag queen is cursing with this kid on stage.
[00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:24.662]  Um, not really.
[00:26:26.642 --> 00:26:32.964]  What kind of parent takes their kid to this type of show and then puts them on stage like some kind of a prop?
[00:26:33.444 --> 00:26:34.565]  A sick parent, that's what.
[00:26:37.823 --> 00:26:39.865]  And it's all fun and games to this drag queen.
[00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:41.686]  Yeah, this is all fun and games.
[00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:45.748]  We're here poisoning the youth, propping up this youth that wants to be a tranny.
[00:26:46.469 --> 00:26:48.090]  That's sick!
[00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:51.792]  They will take your kids from you.
[00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:57.876]  CPS will take your kids from you if they find an old marijuana roach on your coffee table.
[00:26:58.196 --> 00:27:03.159]  This parent's out here playing their kid around like some sort of tranny, putting her in drag queen shows.
[00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:04.860]  Nothing from CPS!
[00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:05.641]  Nothing!
[00:27:07.762 --> 00:27:08.703]  Makes me sick!
[00:27:15.188 --> 00:27:20.412]  Excuse me, I'm just... Look at these people filming this kid.
[00:27:20.432 --> 00:27:23.134]  I mean, this poor kid literally gets put up on the stage.
[00:27:23.374 --> 00:27:25.036]  So now what's going on in this kid's mind?
[00:27:25.256 --> 00:27:26.377]  This kid thinks it's cool!
[00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:27.838]  This kid thinks it's popular!
[00:27:28.038 --> 00:27:29.960]  This kid thinks, wow, I can get a lot of attention!
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.501]  Look at this, I'm fun, I'm hip!
[00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:32.562]  It's cool!
[00:27:32.862 --> 00:27:33.843]  This is rewarding!
[00:27:34.463 --> 00:27:35.243]  It's all fake.
[00:27:35.524 --> 00:27:38.245]  And then other kids are going to see this and be like, wow, I'm lost.
[00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:39.025]  I don't have any friends.
[00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:40.206]  I don't have people cheering for me.
[00:27:40.586 --> 00:27:42.046]  I want to be like Lactatia.
[00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:43.407]  I want to put on a wig.
[00:27:43.747 --> 00:27:44.708]  I want to do makeup.
[00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:48.089]  Mommy, why won't you let me put makeup on and dance around in a wig?
[00:27:48.569 --> 00:27:50.330]  Look, Lactatia can do it.
[00:27:51.231 --> 00:27:52.571]  They're going to parade this girl around.
[00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:55.412]  This is going to be the next thing they're going to try to poison the youth with.
[00:27:55.432 --> 00:27:58.674]  What I love most about this is that your mom is here with you to support you.
[00:27:58.714 --> 00:27:59.454]  Is that true?
[00:27:59.514 --> 00:28:02.536]  My mom's in the front row supporting this sickening behavior.
[00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:07.477]  Can you imagine a parent being around?
[00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:10.137]  Remember that old infomercial, Girls Gone Wild?
[00:28:10.157 --> 00:28:12.618]  We're here with Girls Gone Wild!
[00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:13.598]  Woo!
[00:28:13.918 --> 00:28:15.738]  I want to thank my mother who supported me!
[00:28:15.918 --> 00:28:16.379]  Woo!
[00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:17.079]  Thank you mom!
[00:28:17.159 --> 00:28:17.859]  Woo!
[00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:18.979]  Woo!
[00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:22.200]  That's basically what you have here.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.220]  Okay, so that's nice.
[00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:28.161]  Wow!
[00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:30.186]  Poor kid, man.
[00:28:30.307 --> 00:28:30.887]  Poor kid.
[00:28:30.927 --> 00:28:32.588]  Now, let's go to this other video.
[00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:34.629]  Again, this kid is just being propped up.
[00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:38.251]  Of course, all the people in this community, oh, we love this kid!
[00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:39.732]  Look at how fun this kid is!
[00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:40.152]  Woo-hoo!
[00:28:40.472 --> 00:28:46.816]  They don't care that they're literally destroying this kid's mind, destroying this kid's hopes at a normal future.
[00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:50.698]  Here's more, and you'll see the parent that's the problem in this video.
[00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:57.146]  I think that anyone can do what they want in life.
[00:28:57.907 --> 00:29:00.389]  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
[00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:04.754]  If you want to be a drag queen and your parents don't let you, you need new parents.
[00:29:08.732 --> 00:29:10.034]  That's what Andrew Cuomo says.
[00:29:10.054 --> 00:29:13.437]  That's what the guy Cuomo on CNN says.
[00:29:13.498 --> 00:29:20.606]  Oh my gosh, if you don't like the fact that there's a tranny walking around in the bathroom with your little girl, there's something wrong with you!
[00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:21.026]  Oh, really?
[00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:21.987]  Something wrong with you, huh?
[00:29:26.492 --> 00:29:29.073]  Here we go.
[00:29:29.193 --> 00:29:30.794]  Social media superstar.
[00:29:30.814 --> 00:29:32.215]  You're a big deal.
[00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:33.375]  You're a hero.
[00:29:33.475 --> 00:29:34.816]  You're making a difference.
[00:29:34.896 --> 00:29:41.679]  We love you propping this poor kid up to set up the rest of the youth to poison their minds with this garbage.
[00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:42.799]  This is not normal!
[00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:44.000]  And where does the name come from?
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.921]  So there you go, the family supporting this.
[00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:52.003]  So, I want to say a little hi to your parents because I understand that your mom did your makeup tonight, am I right?
[00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:53.444]  Here's the mom, here's the problem.
[00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:12.092]  Why do you think the mom does this?
[00:30:12.112 --> 00:30:14.794]  For her kid or for herself?
[00:30:14.834 --> 00:30:15.414]  For herself.
[00:30:15.434 --> 00:30:19.277]  This mother wants attention, she's desperate, so now she's doing this to her kid.
[00:30:19.497 --> 00:30:20.918]  This is child abuse!
[00:30:21.158 --> 00:30:22.419]  This is child abuse!
[00:30:22.699 --> 00:30:24.761]  But what would you do if she would invite you?
[00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:36.189]  Folks, you can look at unbelievable stories of the reasons why CPS has taken children from kids, and it pales in comparison to what you're seeing on film right now.
[00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:41.153]  A mother putting makeup on their boy, propping her up like a hero.
[00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:41.673]  Look at this.
[00:30:41.693 --> 00:30:43.935]  She's wearing a Nazi sticker.
[00:30:53.857 --> 00:30:55.378]  So then they take her to this show.
[00:30:55.398 --> 00:30:57.299]  So this is another drag show.
[00:30:57.379 --> 00:31:00.642]  Oh, isn't this, this is such great children's, uh, performance art right here.
[00:31:00.662 --> 00:31:03.063]  Yeah, forget Disney on Ice, you know.
[00:31:03.323 --> 00:31:08.326]  Forget going to the Nickelodeon's, you know, cartoon shows or Nickelodeon Studios or, you know, anything like that.
[00:31:08.707 --> 00:31:10.828]  Let's take my kid to a drag show!
[00:31:11.288 --> 00:31:14.731]  Because she'll stick out and everybody will love me, because I'm a selfish parent.
[00:31:15.591 --> 00:31:16.572]  That's what's going on here.
[00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:21.080]  Oh my gosh, I want to be just like these people!
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:21.761]  There you go.
[00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:23.863]  And now they're all cheering on this poor kid.
[00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:24.644]  This is sick.
[00:31:25.204 --> 00:31:26.666]  This is child abuse, folks.
[00:31:27.787 --> 00:31:28.668]  Look at this poor kid.
[00:31:37.131 --> 00:31:38.612]  Look at this, folks.
[00:31:38.752 --> 00:31:39.192]  Just cut it.
[00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:39.793]  I'm done with this.
[00:31:39.853 --> 00:31:40.413]  I'm done with this.
[00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:42.254]  The left is completely sick.
[00:31:42.815 --> 00:31:44.596]  This is the mental state of the left.
[00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:45.576]  They hate the family.
[00:31:45.616 --> 00:31:47.437]  That's why they poison their own youth, folks.
[00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.779]  This parent doesn't give a damn about that kid.
[00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:55.362]  All they care about is the selfishness of their own popularity and everybody looking at them and, look, my kid's a hero!
[00:31:55.702 --> 00:31:58.284]  Okay, but let's just go through the rest of this real quick.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.883]  Just to show you, you know, the leaders in European obviously don't have kids, okay?
[00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:05.243]  Maybe they're anti-family, maybe they're not.
[00:32:05.263 --> 00:32:06.364]  It's just a fact they don't have kids.
[00:32:06.644 --> 00:32:15.029]  Then here in America, we're making our kids be drag queen stars, putting makeup on them and putting them in front of the camera, forcing them into this lifestyle.
[00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.190]  That's child abuse.
[00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:23.715]  Then you have Kurt Eichenwald tweeting about how he's looking for porn with his kid!
[00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.462]  You cannot make this up!
[00:32:26.742 --> 00:32:33.646]  You would think that I am nuts if I told you that this crap was going on, but it literally happens in real time.
[00:32:34.486 --> 00:32:35.867]  This is literally insane.
[00:32:36.327 --> 00:32:41.590]  Kurt Eichenwald talking about looking into tentacle porn with his wife and kids.
[00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.431]  So now...
[00:32:43.553 --> 00:32:46.256]  CNN has also fired one of these leftist nuts.
[00:32:46.976 --> 00:32:49.138]  They fired Reza Aslan.
[00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:58.907]  So just so you know who this guy is who works for CNN, he's literally been a cannibal on live TV and he also called for the rape of Todd Akin.
[00:32:59.127 --> 00:33:00.689]  This is the modern day left.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.966]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:05.006]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:06.587]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.887 --> 00:33:07.688]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:08.608]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:11.209]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.130]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.752]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.992 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.999]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:58.801]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.883]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:08.151]  Well, President Trump told us that he would drain the swamp, and he's coming through.
[00:37:08.751 --> 00:37:11.112]  And it's time for us to come through when the midterms come around.
[00:37:11.132 --> 00:37:26.835]  But another thing that President Trump has done that's been great, and this includes removing us from the TPP, getting us out of the Paris Climate Accord, from the Washington Examiner, Trump delivering biggest cut in regulations since Ronald Reagan.
[00:37:27.435 --> 00:37:41.600]  And again, these are regulations that you could have found in the TPP, regulations you could have found in the Paris Climate Accord, and just many other regulations that have been building up and building up and building up and building up.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:54.525]  And so, President Trump decided to give a speech about it and describe exactly what he's talking about with all of these regulations.
[00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:55.685]  Here's President Trump.
[00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:07.633]  Instead of rebuilding our country, Washington has spent decades building a dense thicket of rules, regulations, and red tape.
[00:38:08.654 --> 00:38:22.619]  It took only four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge, and five years to build the Hoover Dam, and less than one year to build the Empire State Building.
[00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:23.659]  People don't believe that.
[00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:25.240]  It took less than one year.
[00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:36.228]  But today it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project.
[00:38:38.368 --> 00:38:46.530]  These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process.
[00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:53.712]  It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes.
[00:38:56.363 --> 00:39:04.169]  So he tells you about how it used to be easier to build, we could build things quicker when the government wasn't getting in the way of us and our prosperity.
[00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:08.232]  So here's President Trump actually illustrating that in real time.
[00:39:10.394 --> 00:39:24.205]  As one example, and this happened just 30 minutes ago, I was sitting with a great group of people responsible for their state's economic development and roadways.
[00:39:26.118 --> 00:39:27.399]  All of you are in the room now.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:36.066]  And one gentleman from Maryland was talking about an 18-mile road.
[00:39:37.087 --> 00:39:42.712]  And he brought with him some of the approvals that they've gotten and paid for.
[00:39:42.772 --> 00:39:50.958]  They spent $29 million for an environmental report weighing 70 pounds and costing $24,000 per page.
[00:39:54.591 --> 00:39:55.512]  And I said, do me a favor.
[00:39:55.532 --> 00:39:56.934]  I'm going to make a speech in a little while.
[00:39:57.335 --> 00:39:58.717]  Do you mind if I take that and show it?
[00:39:59.578 --> 00:40:00.379]  So I'm going to show it.
[00:40:02.262 --> 00:40:04.245]  This is why I love President Trump right here.
[00:40:09.312 --> 00:40:10.972]  He's showing you exactly what he's talking about.
[00:40:11.332 --> 00:40:12.653]  He has a meeting with these people.
[00:40:12.733 --> 00:40:16.393]  He has meetings with real Americans who are dealing with this nonsense.
[00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:16.773]  There he goes.
[00:40:16.793 --> 00:40:17.654]  Just toss it aside.
[00:40:17.694 --> 00:40:19.014]  Get these regulations out of the way.
[00:40:19.034 --> 00:40:21.894]  The crowd roars because they're the ones that have been dealing with this.
[00:40:22.254 --> 00:40:25.915]  They're the ones that have been trying to rebuild this country, trying to rebuild the infrastructure.
[00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:27.435]  Trump says, tell me the issues.
[00:40:27.475 --> 00:40:28.376]  How can we make this better?
[00:40:28.636 --> 00:40:34.277]  They say, well, President Trump, I tried to build a road and I got three binders of government regulations.
[00:40:34.497 --> 00:40:35.817]  Couldn't even lay any pavement.
[00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:37.416]  That's what Trump says.
[00:40:37.456 --> 00:40:39.817]  He says, get this crap out of our way!
[00:40:45.358 --> 00:40:45.958]  He's done with it.
[00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:47.379]  So they spent millions and millions of dollars.
[00:40:47.399 --> 00:40:51.580]  When I said, how long is this short roadway been talked about?
[00:41:06.314 --> 00:41:11.036]  The gentleman said, well, if you say 20 years, you're safe.
[00:41:11.256 --> 00:41:11.817]  I said, yeah, don't.
[00:41:12.757 --> 00:41:18.080]  So 20 years trying to build a road and nothing but government regulations in the way.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:18.920]  Pathetic.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.841]  President Trump wants to do something about it.
[00:41:21.261 --> 00:41:29.545]  Here was a powerful speech from President Trump also two days ago, talking about the people that are trying to stop him and the American people's agenda.
[00:41:31.066 --> 00:41:35.068]  The entrenched interest and failed bitter voices in Washington.
[00:41:35.814 --> 00:41:43.721]  We'll do everything in their power to try and stop us from this righteous cause, to try to stop all of you.
[00:41:44.883 --> 00:41:45.703]  They will lie.
[00:41:46.424 --> 00:41:47.385]  They will obstruct.
[00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:51.048]  They will spread their hatred and their prejudice.
[00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.813]  But we will not back down from doing what is right.
[00:41:57.088 --> 00:42:00.692]  Amen to that, President Trump, and that's why we have to get behind him.
[00:42:00.972 --> 00:42:07.939]  That's why all of these leaders of America that he's meeting with are behind his agenda, and cheer for him when he gives these speeches.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.984]  Now, let's go to this report from John Bowne.
[00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:18.157]  America, don't fool yourself by saying it can't happen here, because it is happening here.
[00:42:18.637 --> 00:42:21.438]  Sharia law is infesting our communities.
[00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:38.127]  Case in point, the Detroit Free Press reports a federal prosecutor dropped a bombshell in court Wednesday, telling a federal judge that the government estimates that as many as 100 girls may have had their genitals cut at the hands of a local doctor and her cohorts.
[00:42:38.488 --> 00:42:39.508]  Assistant U.S.
[00:42:39.588 --> 00:42:42.390]  Attorney Sarah Woodward disclosed the information.
[00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:48.637]  Trying to convince a judge to keep a doctor and his wife locked up in the historic case.
[00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:59.790]  It involves allegations that two Minnesota girls had their genitals cut at a Livonia clinic in February as part of a religious rite of passage and were told to keep what happened a secret.
[00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.034]  Woodward said referring to the lead defendant in the case.
[00:43:03.274 --> 00:43:10.300]  Due to the secretive nature of this procedure, we are unlikely to ever know how many children were cut by Dr. Nagarwala.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.703]  The Minnesota victims were not the first victims.
[00:43:14.103 --> 00:43:20.628]  Sharia law covers family law, criminal law, and even personal beliefs with penalties for blasphemy and apostasy.
[00:43:21.249 --> 00:43:24.271]  Under Sharia, husbands can beat their wives.
[00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:27.094]  Females are second class citizens.
[00:43:27.734 --> 00:43:30.415]  Female leadership roles are an impossibility.
[00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:33.616]  Marrying pre-pubescent females is permissible.
[00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:39.357]  Raping female infidels is permissible.
[00:43:39.637 --> 00:43:43.879]  Not to mention all of the honor killings and stoning of females to death by their families.
[00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:51.981]  It was in this Peoria, Arizona parking lot that 48-year-old unemployed truck driver, Fala Amalaki, rammed his Jeep into two women.
[00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.422]  One of Amalaki's victims was his 20-year-old daughter, Noor.
[00:43:55.882 --> 00:44:14.078]  When a young woman strays from what her family expects and she tries to stand up for what might be her legal rights, her family may react, retaliate by killing her or hurting her in order to avenge her misbehavior and clean its own honor, redeem itself in the face of the community.
[00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:19.283]  What's being called a nationwide day of action against Muslims is expected to happen across the country this Saturday.
[00:44:19.344 --> 00:44:24.369]  And in Roseville, the group known for spreading anti-Islamic messages has also planned a march.
[00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:36.382]  Notice how the propaganda-spewing reporters dangerously labeled the march as anti-Muslim, stoking the fires of anger in the reactive left and the Soros-financed Antifa movement.
[00:44:36.542 --> 00:44:42.686]  Last year at the State Capitol, a massive riot broke out as alt-right and anti-fascist groups clashed.
[00:44:43.027 --> 00:44:45.368]  Ten people were stabbed and others injured.
[00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:53.054]  And just two months ago in Berkeley, more violence as a woman was punched in the face by a self-proclaimed white nationalist.
[00:44:53.314 --> 00:44:55.696]  But this issue isn't that black and white.
[00:45:23.234 --> 00:45:24.135]  We're good to go.
[00:45:42.592 --> 00:45:46.954]  Islamofascism is the issue of our time and must be stopped.
[00:45:47.454 --> 00:45:57.358]  That's why this Saturday, June 10th, we're organizing rallies in 29 cities in 21 states to take a stand before it's too late.
[00:45:58.038 --> 00:46:03.941]  This is your chance to show the fake news media what you think of their open border zealotry.
[00:46:04.421 --> 00:46:08.903]  To show spineless DC politicians what you think of their PC pandering.
[00:46:09.443 --> 00:46:16.026]  To show President Trump that you stand behind his necessary travel ban from terror-ridden nations.
[00:46:16.846 --> 00:46:22.548]  This isn't about the 3.3 million American Muslims.
[00:46:38.775 --> 00:46:40.596]  Peacefully living in the United States.
[00:46:40.656 --> 00:46:42.816]  In fact, they should be joining the march too.
[00:46:43.436 --> 00:46:55.860]  When Sharia law rears its ugly head in our communities as a subversive alternative to our Bill of Rights and Constitution, supporting its growth is nothing less than treason.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.380]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:47:02.982 --> 00:47:07.723]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.158]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:59.069]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.970]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.030]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:14.318]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:14.598 --> 00:49:32.972]  Now that President Trump has pulled out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, we're going to go ahead and talk to some liberals as to whether or not they still feel that the federal government should do everything for them, or if they think it needs to be handled at a state level or in the private sector.
[00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:34.534]  Let's go see what they have to say.
[00:49:35.855 --> 00:49:39.177]  What do you think about Trump pulling out of the Paris Accord?
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:42.840]  I don't know.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.982]  You know the climate change agreement with Paris?
[00:49:46.062 --> 00:49:46.822]  What do you think about that?
[00:49:47.683 --> 00:49:48.323]  Uh, not good.
[00:49:49.303 --> 00:49:50.784]  It's on the wrong side of history.
[00:49:50.984 --> 00:49:52.385]  Well, I think it's a terrible idea.
[00:49:52.765 --> 00:49:56.567]  I think that it's one of the worst things he's done so far.
[00:49:57.648 --> 00:50:02.390]  And climate change is a reality and he doesn't want to see it.
[00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:06.752]  And I think there's a lot of oil people behind it and I think it's terrible.
[00:50:07.253 --> 00:50:09.814]  It's pretty messed up, not surprising, but yeah.
[00:50:10.583 --> 00:50:12.447]  I just think we're going backwards as a country.
[00:50:13.528 --> 00:50:14.650]  He's now looking to the future.
[00:50:17.576 --> 00:50:22.284]  We're children of the 60s, where there was hope, and now there's no hope.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:23.840]  Oh, God.
[00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:34.925]  Well, I mean, the fact that he ended up using a mayor who then openly said, oh, no, we're going to do everything we can and trying to quote, I represent the citizens of America, not Paris.
[00:50:34.985 --> 00:50:37.966]  It's like, well, it's global climate change.
[00:50:38.026 --> 00:50:39.327]  The key word being global.
[00:50:39.947 --> 00:50:45.869]  It's going to affect all of us, whether you're in Paris or Montreal or Russia or America or China or anything.
[00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:50.391]  So it doesn't make any sense that he wouldn't want to, like, help save the world.
[00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:51.892]  And therefore Americans, too.
[00:50:52.372 --> 00:51:09.338]  I mean the Paris Agreement, I know it's largely symbolic, but symbolic things matter and I think that when one of the most powerful people in the world make the symbolic gesture to turn it down and say no to it, it makes us look pretty bad to the rest of the world.
[00:51:09.398 --> 00:51:13.580]  So I think it's a problem not just for the climate, but for our standing in the rest of the world.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.321]  It might not have been the best
[00:51:16.135 --> 00:51:19.177]  It was a deal, but it was a deal.
[00:51:19.837 --> 00:51:21.619]  And it's a start.
[00:51:22.119 --> 00:51:23.900]  Now, as leaders, we're no longer leaders.
[00:51:26.462 --> 00:51:28.403]  It's about, like NATO, the same kind of thing.
[00:51:28.443 --> 00:51:30.184]  It's about collaboration, as I said, respect.
[00:51:30.645 --> 00:51:34.367]  And no matter what, even if it's not the end all, it's a process of people working together.
[00:51:34.847 --> 00:51:39.370]  We strove since the 60s to get people to be united, and now it's basically separating people.
[00:51:39.691 --> 00:51:41.572]  And that's what worries me the most, that we're separating people.
[00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:42.671]  He's an idiot.
[00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:43.332]  He's an idiot.
[00:51:43.452 --> 00:51:46.334]  Do you think that global warming is a real problem?
[00:51:46.354 --> 00:51:47.655]  Of course, yes.
[00:51:48.035 --> 00:51:48.655]  He's an idiot.
[00:51:49.075 --> 00:51:52.578]  Do you believe that we're actually having global warming?
[00:51:52.598 --> 00:51:54.319]  Uh, yeah.
[00:51:54.539 --> 00:51:54.939]  Of course.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.281]  I agree with science.
[00:51:58.055 --> 00:52:01.916]  Yes, I think any intelligent, remotely educated person does.
[00:52:01.936 --> 00:52:03.236]  So, yes, I do.
[00:52:03.557 --> 00:52:07.238]  In general, I feel that lately, the past few years, it's just weird.
[00:52:07.298 --> 00:52:11.999]  Sometimes it's colder than you expect, and sometimes it's just hotter than you expect.
[00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:16.600]  So, I'm from Miami, and in Miami we're seeing that change.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:24.382]  Like, we used to have somehow of a winter, or a few days during the wintertime where we have a nice
[00:52:26.583 --> 00:52:28.183]  I have one word for all this.
[00:52:28.203 --> 00:52:29.744]  Lack of respect.
[00:52:29.764 --> 00:52:31.904]  Respect the world you live in, people, the environment.
[00:52:56.011 --> 00:53:24.371]  Well, I'm actually studying to be a physicist and biology student right now, so it's what we've studied so far and what we know is that the key ice cap that's holding back the majority of the ice flows in Antarctica is steadily melting, and if that goes, the sea level can rise as much as six plus feet in ten, twenty years, which is going to put a lot of places underwater, and the rapid temperature changes in areas going from hot and cold or flipping all the way around,
[00:53:25.051 --> 00:53:29.301]  We'll kill animal life, plant life, and if those go, humans go with them.
[00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.351]  Well, it's not going to last much longer.
[00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:36.714]  I think that eventually we are all going to be gone, for sure.
[00:53:37.315 --> 00:53:44.660]  Because we're already seeing the droughts and all the flooding, and it's just going to get worse.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:51.344]  So I think at some point it's going to be over for us.
[00:53:51.744 --> 00:53:54.646]  Do you think that global warming is a real problem?
[00:53:55.006 --> 00:53:56.547]  Yes, I do.
[00:53:56.948 --> 00:53:58.889]  What do you think needs to be done to stop it?
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.661]  There's so much, it's hard to even know where to start.
[00:54:03.442 --> 00:54:06.524]  What do you think will happen if we don't make changes?
[00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:08.686]  You'll have to ask my grandkids.
[00:54:10.227 --> 00:54:10.907]  We're different on this.
[00:54:11.888 --> 00:54:15.590]  I'm not sure if global warming, if there is an issue, or how bad that issue is.
[00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.153]  I think there's a lot of facts on both parties to talk about.
[00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:20.454]  I mean, I've seen articles on both.
[00:54:21.074 --> 00:54:24.517]  So I think it needs to be revisited, but just because you're part of the Paris
[00:54:25.734 --> 00:54:27.835]  I guess environmental act.
[00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:30.396]  I'm not sure if that doesn't mean that we're not going to support it.
[00:54:31.636 --> 00:54:35.337]  Since, you know, Trump has at the federal level decided no on this.
[00:54:35.357 --> 00:54:40.059]  Do you think that people instead should rely more on local and state changes?
[00:54:40.239 --> 00:54:40.979]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:40.999 --> 00:54:53.523]  I mean, from what I had heard, a few cities had already signed on, you know, symbolically again to say they wanted to, um, you know, be a part of what the, the, the agreement like, you know,
[00:54:55.154 --> 00:54:55.434]  I don't know.
[00:55:13.783 --> 00:55:20.846]  Do you think that this kind of proves, in a sense, that maybe things shouldn't be held up at the federal level?
[00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:24.988]  Maybe there shouldn't be this power at the federal level to then determine that?
[00:55:25.148 --> 00:55:26.468]  Yes, I totally agree with you.
[00:55:26.488 --> 00:55:27.829]  I think it shouldn't be.
[00:55:28.289 --> 00:55:40.594]  I think, you know, it should be a debate and it should be among the people of the United States to decide that, not the federal government.
[00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:46.056]  Do you think that it should be more up to states and private industry to actually make those changes?
[00:55:46.136 --> 00:55:46.476]  Totally.
[00:55:46.496 --> 00:55:47.417]  I totally agree with that.
[00:55:48.077 --> 00:55:49.578]  Well, the enlightened states are doing it.
[00:55:49.898 --> 00:55:55.020]  The enlightened states are saying, we're going to abide by the Paris Accord.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.541]  California, where I'm from, we're going to go our own way.
[00:55:58.901 --> 00:56:08.485]  We're going to go our own way and make sure that we live in a world, do our best to live in a world that's safe for both the environment and for the children, the next generations.
[00:56:08.505 --> 00:56:09.826]  What's sad is you're going your own way.
[00:56:10.435 --> 00:56:12.437]  The states are equally as responsible.
[00:56:13.117 --> 00:56:14.698]  I would like to see that they work together on that.
[00:56:15.159 --> 00:56:17.821]  I don't think you can just hold state governments or the federal together.
[00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:33.837]  You know, there's some people out there saying that maybe the dinosaurs went extinct because they made so much methane gas, aka dinosaur farts, and you know how cow farts are, you know, it's an issue, the methane gas.
[00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:34.178]  Right.
[00:56:34.358 --> 00:56:37.800]  Do you think that maybe the dinosaurs were made extinct because of their methane?
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.923]  I have no idea, but I will say, I mean, dinosaurs didn't have
[00:56:42.603 --> 00:56:51.406]  Humvees, so... Well, the fact that we've proven that it was a gigantic meteorite that landed in Mexico that killed them, I don't think farting had anything to do with it.
[00:56:52.207 --> 00:56:59.389]  And, you know, nature's kind of a fine-tuned machine when left on her own, so I think methane wouldn't really be a problem in the environment.
[00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:05.892]  Do you think that people saying that the cows' methane gas and their farting is a real issue?
[00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:10.945]  Well, we have done a heck of a lot to increase their population.
[00:57:11.005 --> 00:57:13.587]  That goes without saying, because of the beef industry.
[00:57:13.887 --> 00:57:21.471]  Would you believe it if some of the scientists are saying that CO2 levels were five times higher during the Jurassic period than they are today?
[00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:35.218]  No, I don't believe so, because, I mean, the organisms, yeah, were a heck of a lot bigger, but there was actually eight times more oxygen back then than there was today.
[00:57:35.834 --> 00:57:37.415]  Yeah, I'd have to look into that.
[00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:38.456]  That seems surprising.
[00:57:40.077 --> 00:57:42.639]  Probably would have to do some research before I would believe that.
[00:57:43.339 --> 00:57:51.225]  So, the reality is, when this administration is gone, we can step back into the Paris Accord and do what we should be doing right.
[00:57:51.746 --> 00:57:51.906]  So?
[00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:53.387]  Not everything is a deal.
[00:57:54.147 --> 00:57:55.428]  Sometimes it's about heart and soul.
[00:57:55.929 --> 00:58:02.874]  So you think that the United States should just be willing to kind of take a worse deal for themselves in order to start the process?
[00:58:02.894 --> 00:58:03.554]  What's a worse deal?
[00:58:03.594 --> 00:58:04.315]  What's a worse deal?
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.681]  What's the worst I'm asking you?
[00:58:06.921 --> 00:58:07.822]  We didn't say worst deal.
[00:58:08.082 --> 00:58:08.983]  You just mentioned worst deal.
[00:58:09.003 --> 00:58:09.703]  What's the worst deal?
[00:58:09.743 --> 00:58:16.388]  Well, what I'm saying is you said that it's not the best deal for the United States at first, but it's a start.
[00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:18.750]  I guess I did say something like that.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:32.166]  Well, liberals were not happy about Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and most believed that the end of the world was nigh, and that natural disasters were imminent.
[00:58:32.466 --> 00:58:44.593]  But a significant number of liberals actually started to drift toward a more conservative viewpoint, which would be to handle it on the state and local level, and through the private sector.
[00:58:44.873 --> 00:58:47.295]  This is Millie Weaver, signing off for InfoWars.com.
