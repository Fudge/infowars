[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.401]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.182]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:22.883]  It's Friday, July 14th, 2017.
[00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.285]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:36.933]  Tonight, even the very fake news network CNN's anchors are getting tired of the Russia narrative, as they are now calling it Russian fatigue.
[00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:39.775]  Meanwhile, it's clear now Don Trump Jr.'
[00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:46.160]  's meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya was a setup, but will this be another self-destructive narrative pushed by the left?
[00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:47.541]  Also,
[00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:50.582]  While it's clear that Don Trump Jr.
[00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:55.614]  committed no crimes, new questions are being raised as to who else attended the meeting and why.
[00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:04.162]  And then... Roger Stone is being sued by a team of Democrat lawyers for colluding with Russia to get Trump elected.
[00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.424]  Roger Stone responds to this ridiculous allegation.
[00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:16.228]  And then based on any crap that Robert Mueller comes up with, they will use that as the basis for an impeachment move on our president.
[00:01:16.488 --> 00:01:19.930]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:27.699]  What?
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.206]  We're good to go.

[00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:02.556]  I'm good.
[00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:23.544]  Remember earlier this week when Kellyanne Conway went to Cuomo and said, you should be ashamed of yourself for continuing to talk about Russia.
[00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:25.525]  Don't you care anything about America?
[00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:29.107]  And then we had CNN's Alison Camerota go on a show.
[00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.288]  She's the anchor for New Day, a CNN program.
[00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:34.330]  She said, I hear your Russia fatigue and I share it.
[00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.334]  You know, there are many mornings I come in and I pray for other news to eclipse and sort of the sort of Russia thread.
[00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.035]  Well, you know, there is plenty of news out there.
[00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.736]  And we're going to talk about some of that today.
[00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.517]  We're also going to answer what they're doing.
[00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:50.240]  And you have to understand, as we saw the Emmy nominations, maybe she's going for an Emmy for her show.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.443]  Because that's the surefire path to get an Emmy if you come out against Trump.
[00:03:54.963 --> 00:04:00.426]  Take a look at Saturday Night Live or Stephen Colbert, especially the ridicule media.
[00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.688]  That's the surefire way to get it.
[00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.269]  You had Stephen Colbert go to Russia.
[00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.631]  He's going to do a full week out of Russia with his Russia show.
[00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.714]  And that's the same way with Saturday Night Live, getting 22 nominations.
[00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:14.937]  It's Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals.
[00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.200]  And he said there is nothing more powerful than ridicule.
[00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.742]  That is the weapon that they're using.
[00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.684]  You can't really defend against it, as he said.
[00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:23.746]  There's no defense against it.
[00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:26.208]  They just put the ridicule out there and keep it coming.
[00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:29.291]  We can defend against CNN's narrative.
[00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:29.811]  And of course,
[00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:32.193]  Some people have pushed back.
[00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:35.055]  We have Oliver Stone saying, we've demonized Russia.
[00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:35.695]  Why are we doing this?
[00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:37.877]  Why are we wanting to have war all the time?
[00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:40.178]  Remember the anti-war liberals?
[00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:42.800]  Remember those guys that said we didn't want war?
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.041]  Well, they don't exist anymore.
[00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:45.061]  Not on the left.
[00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:47.923]  On the left we have the pro-war liberals.
[00:04:47.963 --> 00:04:48.824]  Here's an example.
[00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:50.504]  Again, where's it coming from?
[00:04:50.704 --> 00:04:52.205]  CNN, as usual.
[00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:54.846]  Let's blow up Russia.
[00:04:54.906 --> 00:05:03.248]  This is what this idiot had to say, this commentator, Paul Begala, who is somebody who has worked with the Clintons for a very long time.
[00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:08.810]  This would give you an idea of what we would be getting into if we had the Clintons in office.
[00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.590]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:14.433]  A patriotic American should subvert an election with a hostile foreign power.
[00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.434]  That is what Donald Trump Jr.
[00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:20.957]  agreed to do with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort in the meeting.
[00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:30.062]  We were and are under attack by a hostile foreign power and they seem to be abetting that hostile foreign power.
[00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:37.846]  We should be debating how many sanctions we should place on Russia or whether we should blow up the KGB or GSU, GRU.
[00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:40.751]  We should be retaliating massively.
[00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:45.922]  Because, by the way, if I were a Trump supporter, I would want to retaliate massively because it has tainted his victory.
[00:05:46.182 --> 00:05:48.908]  But right now, the Senate has passed pretty good...
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.181]  Pro-war, anti-free speech left.
[00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:53.221]  That's what they've become.
[00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:57.122]  It used to be that was what they stood for was peace and free speech.
[00:05:57.262 --> 00:05:57.903]  Not anymore.
[00:05:58.263 --> 00:05:58.763]  Not anymore.
[00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:03.845]  You see this guy, he said the Trump supporters should be upset because Russia has tainted Trump's victory.
[00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:04.485]  No, it's not Russia.
[00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:06.966]  It's people like him telling lies.
[00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:13.508]  The fake news, CNN, the Democrats, the GOP establishment are the ones who have tainted Trump's victory.
[00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:14.928]  The ones who are tying him up.
[00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:16.129]  Now we have another
[00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:17.409]  We're good.
[00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:35.375]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:55.806]  And the act of hacking and the act of using it.
[00:06:55.846 --> 00:07:04.192]  There's really no difference under the First Amendment between a campaigner using information from somebody who obtained it illegally and a newspaper doing it.
[00:07:04.252 --> 00:07:12.178]  Newspapers like the New York Times, like the Washington Post, those people who publish the Pentagon Papers, who published the information from Snowden.
[00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:19.523]  So there's a difference between the people who obtain the information illegally and the people who post that information publicly.
[00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:21.705]  So that's why the New York Times could publish the Pentagon Papers.
[00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:26.569]  And why Daniel Ellsberg could still face charges under the Espionage Act.
[00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:32.213]  He's the one who sold it, but they have free speech ability to publish that, and that's not a crime.
[00:07:32.813 --> 00:07:35.355]  And he made this point, and this is a very important point.
[00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:42.941]  He said, we have to not broaden and expand criminal law by focusing on and targeting our enemies.
[00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:44.303]  Do you understand what's happening here?
[00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.880]  He said, I oppose Donald Trump.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.681]  This is a liberal.
[00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.761]  He doesn't like Donald Trump.
[00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:51.002]  He doesn't support Donald Trump.
[00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:56.704]  But he said, we don't want to expand the criminal code just so we can come after our political enemies.
[00:07:57.224 --> 00:07:59.385]  And that's precisely what is happening now.
[00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:00.686]  And it's far worse than that.
[00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:08.729]  We have the intelligence services as well as law enforcement violating the laws so that they can get involved in politics.
[00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:14.251]  And he said this, he said there's been such an overwrought claim, he said there are people who are talking about treason.
[00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:19.333]  I can't believe, said Alan Dershowitz, that the New York Times had an op-ed piece yesterday
[00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:24.675]  In which treason was mentioned without even looking at the definition.
[00:08:24.715 --> 00:08:27.457]  And of course, we had Cuomo doing that on CNN as well.
[00:08:27.497 --> 00:08:30.538]  He said, well, I don't know what the definition of treason is, but we need to look at it.
[00:08:30.558 --> 00:08:31.839]  So he throws the word out there.
[00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.140]  At the same time, he says, well, I really don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.921]  I don't even know what the definition of treason is.
[00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:38.682]  And of course, that's the issue.
[00:08:38.722 --> 00:08:46.766]  The left always likes to use, change the meaning of words, seize the high ground of the argument by the terms that they use.
[00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:51.388]  Ann Coulter put it this way, she said a lot of Republicans hate Trump just as much as MSNBC does.
[00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:54.811]  Oh, you mean like Joe Scarborough at MSNBC?
[00:08:55.451 --> 00:09:03.156]  Or, you know, there's John Dirty Dossier McCain, or we could call him John Isis McCain, the guy who shopped that dossier around.
[00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:04.817]  He certainly hates Donald Trump.
[00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:13.122]  See, the establishment Republicans want to take him down, as we pointed out before, but it's a great way to put it, that Republicans hate him as much as MSNBC does.
[00:09:13.242 --> 00:09:14.703]  And she specifically pointed out
[00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:23.191]  Senator Tom Tillis, who I know about from North Carolina, she said he's placed a hold on Trump's nominee to head the Director of U.S.
[00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:24.952]  Citizenship and Immigration Services.
[00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:33.861]  She said a lot of them hate him as much as MSNBC, so they're slow-walking everything and they're not helping them, preventing him from getting his administration in.
[00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:34.321]  Here we are 200 days
[00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:37.363]  Let me tell you something about Tom Tillis.
[00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:05.622]  Okay.
[00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:40.024]  That wants these H-2B visas so they can get cheap labor to replace engineers and other people.
[00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:42.825]  I mean, Disney did it with their workers.
[00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:44.906]  They weren't specially trained workers.
[00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:52.389]  They started out with engineers saying, we can't find enough engineers or software programmers, so we have to bring in people from elsewhere and pay them a lot less money.
[00:10:52.969 --> 00:10:56.530]  And then they wind up doing it just for ordinary service personnel.
[00:10:57.111 --> 00:11:00.172]  And people like Tom Tillis are going to be there for the corporations.
[00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:09.077]  Now as we look at the Obamacare bill that's being put in by the Senate, and it's likely that this is not going to go through, there's an interesting article today.
[00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:13.885]  Five backroom deals inside the latest Senate health care bill.
[00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:17.012]  I'll tell you why this thing is so corrupt.
[00:11:17.132 --> 00:11:20.193]  First of all, there's the buy-off Lisa Murkowski again fund.
[00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:22.113]  They call it the stability fund.
[00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:31.336]  They say they're going to dedicate 1% to each state where the cost of insurance premiums are at least 75% higher than the national average.
[00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:36.038]  So there's this little carve out here that applies only to Alaska.
[00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:45.265]  1.32 billion dollars in stability funds that is going to be automatically directed to Alaska to get Lisa Murkowski to sign on to it.
[00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:48.468]  Then there's another one for Alaska, the Alaskan Pipeline Bill.
[00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.750]  That's going to also benefit them.
[00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.872]  Then there's the Moral Hazard Expansion that benefits, guess who?
[00:11:54.153 --> 00:11:56.995]  Alaska and Louisiana and then Montana.
[00:11:57.475 --> 00:11:59.817]  Then there's another carve-out for South Dakota.
[00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:02.439]  That applies to South Dakota only.
[00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:05.361]  Then there's one for upstate New York.
[00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:07.162]  They call that the Buffalo bribe.
[00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:10.925]  That started in the House and that got carried over into the Senate bill.
[00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:16.428]  It would essentially penalize the state if it continues to require counties to contribute to Medicaid, etc., etc.
[00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:18.630]  And here's the big deal.
[00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.971]  They say, is there going to be more to come?
[00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:29.217]  They said, understand that they have kept in the high-income tax bill that is going to be assessed on individuals of high income to give subsidies
[00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:30.913]  We're good to go.
[00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:57.907]  But they point out that so far they've only spent about $121 billion of that.
[00:12:58.207 --> 00:13:03.331]  So they've got about another $100 billion that they can hand out to other Senators to buy their support.
[00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:04.972]  And this was done before.
[00:13:05.373 --> 00:13:14.159]  Last time they had a Senate bill up, they left $200 billion in candy that they could use to persuade lawmakers who were reluctant.
[00:13:14.539 --> 00:13:15.460]  That's the way this works.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.062]  So what does this look like when we see this?
[00:13:19.602 --> 00:13:27.448]  The monthly federal spending, as we saw in the Drudge Report today, tops $400 billion, and that's just in one month.
[00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:29.349]  And that's the first time that's happened.
[00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:32.051]  Spending is totally out of control.
[00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:35.273]  $400 billion in just the first month.
[00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:40.317]  Scroll down there and show that graph of how that has gone straight up.
[00:13:40.617 --> 00:13:40.877]  Okay?
[00:13:40.897 --> 00:13:42.538]  You want to get alarmed about something?
[00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.300]  There's your hockey stick.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:52.205]  It's not happening with climate, it's not happening with temperature, but it is happening with the federal government and it cannot go on forever.
[00:13:53.245 --> 00:13:57.828]  We have to have spending cuts, which they're not even talking about.
[00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:01.691]  They can't even get tax reform passed to do some tax cuts.
[00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:11.898]  House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows from North Carolina and other conservative members of the House of Representatives are calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan to delay going on vacation again.
[00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:15.219]  Let's stay here and get something done.
[00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:17.359]  We've got to get tax reform done, he points out.
[00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:18.899]  He says, we've got to move it up sooner.
[00:14:18.979 --> 00:14:23.640]  If we wait until September, we will not get tax reform, guys, if we're waiting until September.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.560]  You guys have been around.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.481]  If we wait until September, that means we get legislative text maybe in October.
[00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:36.723]  That means that maybe we get it out of here if it's fast-tracked by the end of October, which means that then it goes over to the Senate and it just sits there and there's zero chance then
[00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:40.085]  That this is going to get enacted into law before the end of the year.
[00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:45.888]  The tax cut, he says, also needs to be retroactive so that we get the economy moving right away.
[00:14:46.448 --> 00:14:50.050]  We've now seen that optimism has now evaporated.
[00:14:50.070 --> 00:15:00.877]  Remember all that goodwill that we saw because Donald Trump got elected and the hope, as we reported earlier today on the radio program, Mark Zuckerberg went to North Dakota and he saw for the first time
[00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:04.159]  Why Donald Trump got elected had nothing to do with Russians.
[00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:12.264]  It had to do with the fact that people who are working on the oil industry, who are working on the pipeline, realized that their industry wasn't going to be shut down.
[00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:24.633]  And once Trump got elected, once the pipeline got approved, they were shooting off fireworks, they lit Main Street, they had a parade, literally because they got their lives back, they got their jobs back, they had hope.
[00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:26.041]  For the first time.
[00:15:26.341 --> 00:15:31.211]  But people are getting concerned because they're seeing that nothing is happening with health care.
[00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:33.255]  And nothing is happening with tax reform.
[00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.179]  Something needs to change.
[00:15:36.178 --> 00:15:39.020]  The news out of Yahoo says in L.A.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:46.104]  they said as Democrats rush to endorse single-payer health care at the national level, California is sounding a warning.
[00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:51.167]  They say soon enough the Republican Party's seven-year crusade to slay the Affordable Care Act.
[00:15:51.187 --> 00:15:51.687]  Remember that?
[00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:53.148]  Remember when they called it affordable?
[00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:54.729]  That's not the metric anymore.
[00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:57.651]  They don't care anything about whether it's affordable or not.
[00:15:58.131 --> 00:15:59.412]  You have the Congressional Budget Office.
[00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:00.333]  They don't talk about
[00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:01.793]  The cost of it?
[00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:04.674]  They simply talk about the number of people insured.
[00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:07.755]  It's all about universal coverage.
[00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.556]  That's why they're going to the single payer.
[00:16:09.856 --> 00:16:11.176]  They wanted to destroy our healthcare.
[00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:12.397]  We told you this from the very beginning.
[00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:15.117]  We told you this was something to benefit the insurance companies.
[00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:17.958]  It was massive corporate welfare for the insurance companies.
[00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:26.101]  And then they were going to destroy it by making everything an incredible mess and substitute single payer so they could control everything.
[00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:37.385]  They say this controversial bill is going to make it or not make it, probably will not make it, and once it doesn't make it, they say, then the ball is in the Democrats' court as to how they're going to respond.
[00:16:37.405 --> 00:16:43.928]  An increasing number of Democrats, elected officials nationally, are coalescing around single-payer insurance.
[00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:46.469]  And they say that they now have 53% of Americans
[00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.492]  That's up from 40% in 1998 to the year 2000.
[00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:58.214]  Of course, remember that this is a poll being done by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
[00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:00.394]  It is self-serving for the insurance business.
[00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:02.235]  We see these kind of push polls all the time.
[00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:03.716]  We saw them throughout the election.
[00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:06.517]  So let's not get too worried about that.
[00:17:06.757 --> 00:17:10.498]  We have some education to do, but I don't think that those poll numbers are accurate.
[00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:12.139]  Nevertheless, we have Elizabeth Warren.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.962]  Democrats need to run and make that a central part of their platform in 2018.
[00:17:17.402 --> 00:17:26.466]  Bernie Sanders says as soon as the Obamacare replacement crashes and fails with Republicans, he's going to introduce a single-payer system.
[00:17:27.326 --> 00:17:35.590]  And he said, where we should be going is to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right.
[00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.991]  That is not
[00:17:37.771 --> 00:17:40.713]  First of all, what the rest of the industrialized world is doing.
[00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.134]  And you can't do that.
[00:17:42.654 --> 00:17:46.317]  You can't say that they have a right to be provided free health care.
[00:17:46.337 --> 00:17:48.138]  We have a right to be left alone.
[00:17:48.898 --> 00:17:50.719]  But this is nothing other than socialism.
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:53.821]  If anyone wants to talk about the industrialized world, no, it's the socialized world.
[00:17:54.022 --> 00:17:55.603]  And we should take a look at Venezuela.
[00:17:55.903 --> 00:17:59.625]  That's where they ran out of other people's money first, was in Venezuela.
[00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:04.849]  It'll happen in the rest of the industrialized world because the rest of the industrialized world is not industrialized anymore.
[00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:06.510]  Meanwhile, in California,
[00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:13.694]  Even the Californians are saying, wait a minute, if we do this, this doesn't really address serious issues like financing.
[00:18:13.734 --> 00:18:15.255]  It doesn't do anything for the affordability.
[00:18:15.516 --> 00:18:16.776]  Or healthcare delivery.
[00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:18.538]  It doesn't control cost.
[00:18:18.778 --> 00:18:23.481]  Even Jerry Brown, Governor Brown in California said, where do we get the extra money?
[00:18:23.981 --> 00:18:28.664]  You take a problem and you say I'm going to solve it by something that's an even bigger problem, that makes no sense.
[00:18:28.684 --> 00:18:34.228]  You're not just kicking the can down the road, you're kicking a snowball over the hill and you're creating an avalanche.
[00:18:34.568 --> 00:18:36.049]  And you're going to run out of other people's money.
[00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:36.950]  So what's the solution?
[00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.111]  The Washington Post got it right.
[00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.572]  They said Trump says he wants victories, but he isn't selling the GOP agenda to the voters.
[00:18:43.733 --> 00:18:45.513]  That's precisely what needs to happen.
[00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:46.454]  I've said that many times.
[00:18:46.774 --> 00:18:54.257]  When he has these massive rallies, he could energize and lead his followers to demand change from the Republicans.
[00:18:54.337 --> 00:18:55.357]  They're the ones who are blogging it.
[00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:56.097]  Stay with us.
[00:18:56.397 --> 00:18:57.098]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:05.821]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:08.509]  There's a new tool in the arsenal when it comes to taking back your health.
[00:23:08.949 --> 00:23:15.034]  A company is now going to make it easier than ever for you to avoid pesticides when choosing your food products.
[00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:19.598]  They are introducing the new glyphosate residue-free food labeling.
[00:23:19.938 --> 00:23:24.021]  And this is all thanks to that consumer-based push for transparency.
[00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:31.387]  Chosen Foods and Heavenly Organics are two food makers that already have several products out on the market.
[00:23:31.927 --> 00:23:47.330]  But the director of the Detox Project, who is the creator and owner of this glyphosate residue-free label, says that the certification will enable food manufacturers to give consumers what they really want, glyphosate residue-free food.
[00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:59.053]  Now, there's been a lot of pushback in recent years with people understanding that the toxicity standards, the tests that they have for testing both non-organic and organic foods is very weak.
[00:23:59.693 --> 00:24:04.796]  Of course, if you're someone who's trying to sell organic, you're already having to jump through a lot of regulatory hoops.
[00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:08.079]  It costs a lot of money for farmers to go organic.
[00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:13.442]  For some reason, they really try to make it hard for the organic farmers to thrive in this country.
[00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:29.393]  But even so, with that, the toxicity testing is very low, very weak, and beyond that, you don't know what you're going to get in your condiments, in your salad dressings, your mayonnaise, even some of your most favorite snacks, and of course your cooking oils.
[00:24:29.993 --> 00:24:42.798]  So this company is trying to make it very easy for you to just choose right away and make sure that you are avoiding glyphosate and hopefully in the future some of these other insecticides that are hitting the market.
[00:24:43.058 --> 00:24:46.860]  We know glyphosate is the most widely used insecticide that is out there.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.442]  Of course this was the herbicide that was used for Monsanto's genetically modified crops.
[00:24:52.862 --> 00:25:02.767]  But something that was really interesting, in 2015 the World Health Organization labeled glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans.
[00:25:02.887 --> 00:25:05.528]  It's probably, probably could give you cancer.
[00:25:05.548 --> 00:25:06.989]  Mmm, tasty.
[00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.131]  And so people had, they were just in shock at this.
[00:25:10.171 --> 00:25:10.731]  What are you saying?
[00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:12.712]  You're spraying this poison all over our foods.
[00:25:13.112 --> 00:25:14.493]  But right about the same time,
[00:25:15.133 --> 00:25:26.702]  Another chemical company was right on the heels of Monsanto, and while all eyes were on Monsanto, Dow Chemical was coming up with their own genetically modified crops as well.
[00:25:27.102 --> 00:25:32.386]  And so they were creating their own herbicide that they would spray on their crops.
[00:25:32.486 --> 00:25:41.273]  Because remember, a lot of crops have become resistant to glyphosate, which means that these farmers were having to spray even more glyphosate on the crops.
[00:25:41.793 --> 00:25:42.693]  We're good to go.
[00:25:58.379 --> 00:26:03.440]  They go ahead and approve Dow Chemicals herbicide blend.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.901]  It was called Enlist Duo.
[00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:19.563]  And they said not only were they going to pass it through and approve this for use on their crops, but they also the amount of pesticides that they were going to allow them to spray on the crops was just insane.
[00:26:19.743 --> 00:26:25.945]  Tons of pesticide that they were going to allow to be sprayed and get into the soil of our earth.
[00:26:26.005 --> 00:26:26.925]  It would spread to the water.
[00:26:26.945 --> 00:26:26.985]  So
[00:26:28.445 --> 00:26:37.208]  Interestingly, thanks to a lot of pushback, the EPA was actually forced to revoke the approval of that Dow herbicide for their GMO crops.
[00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:48.672]  And in a court filing back in 2015, they said, you know, the EPA discovered new information suggesting that the herbicide could be more toxic than previously believed.
[00:26:49.432 --> 00:26:55.675]  So, of course, this was due to a lot of that consumer-based pushback where people were saying, what are you thinking?
[00:26:56.096 --> 00:27:07.882]  You're labeling one insecticide as probably carcinogenic, yet you're granting access to another company to come and do the same with a whole new version of products that we haven't even begun to fight against.
[00:27:08.782 --> 00:27:08.942]  It's
[00:27:29.901 --> 00:27:30.361]  I think so.
[00:27:51.448 --> 00:27:57.732]  Now, of course, a lot of people wanted to say, oh, well, they had alcoholism or family problems, mental issues that weren't addressed.
[00:27:58.172 --> 00:28:01.274]  But a lot of people, a lot of social activists were saying, no.
[00:28:01.394 --> 00:28:17.424]  The common denominator here in, you know, 8 out of 10 cases was that these farmers were very indebted to these banks because they were sold the story that if they went ahead and bought the GM crop, BT cotton and others specifically,
[00:28:18.024 --> 00:28:18.264]  That's
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.881]  We're good to go.
[00:28:57.483 --> 00:29:03.107]  And I was able to narrow it down quickly to just three brands thanks to this non-GMO project label.
[00:29:03.527 --> 00:29:07.250]  They also have an app you can download that makes it really easy to go shopping.
[00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:17.537]  So this is the power of voting with your dollars, pushing back against these corporations who see us as just a science experiment that's to be fed a steady stream of pesticides and frankenfoods.
[00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:20.279]  We are not a science experiment.
[00:29:20.339 --> 00:29:23.622]  We are humans and we are reclaiming our power and this
[00:29:24.142 --> 00:29:28.563]  Glyphosate residue-free food label is just another victory for the consumer.
[00:29:38.465 --> 00:29:44.106]  Now I hate to tell you, see I told you so, but over the weekend I really looked at what happened with Donald Jr.
[00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:45.907]  and the only other place that got it right
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.100]  Let's do it!
[00:30:03.737 --> 00:30:11.525]  And they've spent millions of FBI taxpayer dollars paying for the PPgate dossier that they now admit is completely made up and fake.
[00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:14.629]  So they're the ones in contact with the Russians.
[00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:20.635]  They're the ones asking for help from the Russians to go after Trump and couldn't find anything.
[00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:22.257]  So they just put out fake stuff.
[00:30:22.837 --> 00:30:31.422]  Since the entire Russian collusion delusion has produced nothing, they plan to stretch this out as long as they can.
[00:30:31.902 --> 00:30:49.271]  Mr. Mueller, longtime hitman for the Clintons and the Bushes, the guy who coached James Comey on his testimony only weeks ago, will drag out his investigation until there's a, hopefully for him and the elitists, a Democratic majority in the House.
[00:30:49.311 --> 00:30:50.112]  Then it doesn't matter
[00:30:50.672 --> 00:30:58.718]  How thin or asinine the charges he brings, they would be used as a hook for impeachment.
[00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:15.612]  The best way to combat this, of course, is to direct Jeff Sessions to convene a grand jury and to look into the matter of mass surveillance of American citizens as exposed by the FISA court only days before Trump became president.
[00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:26.196]  If talking to the Russians shows collusion, or that the Russians hacked the election, the Democrats on record have done a hundred times what Donald Jr.
[00:31:26.236 --> 00:31:31.499]  did, and it was directed by the neocons, by the rhinos, by the Democratic Party.
[00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:39.586]  Collusion is also, like you talked about in the last block, it's secretive or illegal coordination with the intention to deceive.
[00:31:40.387 --> 00:31:42.890]  There was no crime here and then there was no deceit.
[00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:49.617]  There is some collusion, if you want to play this game, between the Ukrainian government and the Clinton campaign.
[00:31:49.977 --> 00:31:50.638]  There were meetings.
[00:31:51.278 --> 00:31:56.740]  At the Ukrainian Embassy, the DNC was involved, this is from Politico, Juan's laughing, ProPolitico.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:11.746]  Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office and helped his allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors and disseminated documents smearing his aides.
[00:32:12.836 --> 00:32:18.358]  If she wants to criminalize politics, then the Clinton campaign's gonna have to go behind bars too.
[00:32:18.678 --> 00:32:24.979]  The PR investigative Democratic Party group that they hired to do it is run by the Democratic Party.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.720]  Fusion GPS, all that garbage.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.822]  As usual, they've done 100 times on record what they claim Trump did.
[00:32:34.722 --> 00:32:37.743]  She was contacting him, contacting all those people constantly.
[00:32:38.383 --> 00:32:40.464]  Got him in a room, in the middle of a campaign.
[00:32:40.504 --> 00:32:41.324]  Okay, what's the dirt?
[00:32:42.802 --> 00:32:44.244]  Oh, I want to talk about sanctions.
[00:32:44.485 --> 00:32:45.586]  See, because that would have been illegal.
[00:32:47.249 --> 00:32:52.597]  To have her then ask, hey, we're going to give you some info if you give us policies that help Russia.
[00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:55.582]  That's what Hillary's really doing and caught doing.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.153]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.708]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.029 --> 00:36:59.212]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.271]  Well, they tried to poison Roger Stone.
[00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:13.813]  They're attacking him with frivolous lawsuits, but that doesn't stop him from fighting back.
[00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:23.436]  And recently, Omar Navarro was in Miami and he met with Roger Stone, and now Omar Navarro has more wind behind his sails running against Maxine Waters.
[00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:25.957]  He's got the breath of Roger Stone behind him.
[00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.117]  This is big news, Roger.
[00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:28.878]  What made you want to get behind Omar?
[00:37:29.218 --> 00:37:32.381]  Well, first of all, I saw your reporting on him on InfoWars.
[00:37:32.421 --> 00:37:35.524]  I was really unaware of Omar himself.
[00:37:35.584 --> 00:37:41.810]  I'm certainly well aware of Maxine Waters over a long period of time, but I was very impressed with your interview with him.
[00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.292]  I wanted to meet with him personally.
[00:37:43.352 --> 00:37:44.092]  He reminds me
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.382]  of a young congressman Richard Nixon.
[00:37:47.442 --> 00:37:55.147]  I mean, the guy is a fighter, he's dogged, he has got unlimited energy, he's enthusiastic, you can see he's having a good time.
[00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:59.671]  This isn't painful for him, you know, he is a happy warrior.
[00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:04.054]  And that district has changed very dramatically.
[00:38:04.114 --> 00:38:11.739]  That district was once a majority African-American, it is now a solid plurality Hispanic, it's about 20% African-American.
[00:38:14.381 --> 00:38:16.882]  Maxine Waters, of course, does not live in the district.
[00:38:16.942 --> 00:38:21.923]  She lives in a multi-million dollar mansion just outside the district in Hancock.
[00:38:22.644 --> 00:38:26.785]  I don't think the issue here is left, right, liberal, conservative.
[00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:28.405]  The issue is corruption.
[00:38:28.605 --> 00:38:30.086]  She's fundamentally corrupt.
[00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:33.367]  She's had numerous ethics problems.
[00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:34.767]  Let's be candid.
[00:38:34.827 --> 00:38:38.748]  If she were a Hispanic Republican, she'd be in prison right now.
[00:38:39.129 --> 00:38:40.169]  That's the sad truth.
[00:38:40.729 --> 00:38:44.633]  So, I view this as an investment race.
[00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:47.456]  I think Omar is a terrific candidate.
[00:38:48.217 --> 00:38:49.938]  I'm going to help him raise some money.
[00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:55.344]  I'm going to help him bring some form and strategy to his campaign.
[00:38:55.804 --> 00:38:56.925]  I'm very excited about it.
[00:38:57.306 --> 00:38:59.848]  Not only do I think he's got a solid shot.
[00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:01.910]  But he's a leader for the future.
[00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.592]  Even if he should not win this race, he'll win the next race.
[00:39:06.312 --> 00:39:07.593]  This guy's a long-termer.
[00:39:07.693 --> 00:39:08.493]  Very impressive.
[00:39:08.673 --> 00:39:25.122]  Yeah, and it seems like an obvious choice, but as we were talking before, there's some issues in the district with getting information to voters, how to reach out to these voters, you know, certain things that maybe we may, you know, have an edge on being an Omar Navarro supporter, but you're just worried that maybe the voters aren't getting the information.
[00:39:25.442 --> 00:39:27.443]  But you've stepped in, you're going to help him do this.
[00:39:27.844 --> 00:39:29.144]  How's the ground game looking right now?
[00:39:29.164 --> 00:39:30.045]  I think that's going to be key.
[00:39:30.345 --> 00:39:34.128]  Well, there's a lot of new technologies that I think can be utilized here.
[00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:45.798]  For example, we now know how to text voters on their handheld device and match the phone numbers with the voter file for that purpose.
[00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:49.181]  There's a way to do that that's perfectly legal.
[00:39:50.081 --> 00:40:01.309]  So we're gonna have to use some technologies that are new, but Omar can run a cutting-edge campaign and this could be the shocker on election night.
[00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.991]  Maxine Waters, we're coming for you.
[00:40:04.332 --> 00:40:05.553]  Make no mistake about it.
[00:40:05.713 --> 00:40:07.314]  We are definitely coming for you.
[00:40:07.594 --> 00:40:18.440]  No, I love that and it all stems down from the 2016 election where we rejected Hillary Clinton who was forced upon us.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.642]  They tried to force her down our throats and we rejected her.
[00:40:21.662 --> 00:40:30.567]  They're going to try to do the same things in the midterms that they've been doing with people like Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, Debbie Washerman Schultz is another one.
[00:40:30.587 --> 00:40:31.848]  Let's get into Debbie Washerman Schultz.
[00:40:32.608 --> 00:40:34.950]  You know, this is how we drain the swamp, Roger.
[00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.332]  This is how we help Donald Trump drain the swamp.
[00:40:37.632 --> 00:40:45.679]  When you don't have Maxine Waters going on television every day spouting off about Russia, going on The Hill every day spouting off about Russia, that helps.
[00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:47.821]  That limits the obstructionist party.
[00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:49.222]  That limits the Democrats.
[00:40:49.503 --> 00:40:55.227]  And if we get these people out of office, well then that just frees us up to put somebody else in that office who wants to make America great again.
[00:40:55.428 --> 00:40:56.649]  We just talked about Omar Navarro.
[00:40:57.029 --> 00:41:00.272]  Now, tell me about the dynamic going on in Florida with Debbie Washerman Schultz.
[00:41:00.652 --> 00:41:09.195]  Well, as you know, Debbie Wasserman Schultz got caught red-handed by WikiLeaks helping Hillary Clinton screw Bernie Sanders out of the nomination.
[00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:11.256]  Yeah, wait, didn't she lose her job because of that?
[00:41:11.316 --> 00:41:12.617]  She was fired as Democratic National Committee.
[00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:14.318]  That's right, kind of like Bob Kramer, too.
[00:41:14.618 --> 00:41:15.118]  Very much so.
[00:41:15.138 --> 00:41:15.658]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:15.978 --> 00:41:20.060]  And I think a lot of progressives in that congressional district are still angry about it.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:33.747]  A fellow named Tim Canova, who was a Bernie Sanders supporter, jumped in the primary late against her two years ago, raised a substantial amount of money from Sanders supporters, ended up getting about 41% in the primary.
[00:41:34.327 --> 00:41:38.149]  He's running again, which I think will destabilize her in the Democratic primary.
[00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.750]  I think she's still the likely winner.
[00:41:41.371 --> 00:41:47.034]  Republicans are likely to nominate a very attractive candidate named Carla Spaulding.
[00:41:47.554 --> 00:41:50.115]  Carla Spaulding is a Jamaican-American.
[00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:54.537]  She is a, pardon me, she's a Haitian-American.
[00:41:55.277 --> 00:41:56.417]  She's a registered nurse.
[00:41:56.437 --> 00:41:57.818]  She has a master's degree.
[00:41:58.338 --> 00:41:59.859]  A single mother of three children.
[00:42:00.339 --> 00:42:01.139]  Very attractive.
[00:42:01.299 --> 00:42:02.500]  Very articulate.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.042]  And I think the strongest nominee the Republicans have fielded in years.
[00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:12.844]  So this could be an outside
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:25.451]  Set up for an upset, I think largely because many progressives are fed up with Debbie and fed up with the tune she did on Bernie Sanders.
[00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:37.956]  Well, it's amazing to think that the disgraced Debbie Washerman Schultz, disgraced from the Democratic Party really, except just embraced by the corrupt Hillary Clinton, that she could even win the primary, but I guess just the namesake alone gets her through?
[00:42:38.116 --> 00:42:47.382]  Well, you do have a very substantial Jewish-American vote here in this district, and she has a very solid hold on these older Democratic voters.
[00:42:48.023 --> 00:42:51.886]  They're still a political machine in the condominiums, in the large condominiums.
[00:42:52.766 --> 00:42:55.687]  This young fellow, Konova, ran a very strong race.
[00:42:56.487 --> 00:42:58.088]  He scored among minorities.
[00:42:58.168 --> 00:42:59.969]  He scored among progressives.
[00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:06.751]  His problem was among older white voters in the Democratic primary where she continues to prevail.
[00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:11.073]  My guess is that she can hang on, but this new scandal
[00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:21.116]  In which these two Pakistani brothers, the Awan brothers, were brought in through her to 1819 Democratic House members.
[00:43:21.696 --> 00:43:23.637]  This is a festering scandal.
[00:43:24.957 --> 00:43:26.878]  And she won't turn over those hard drives, by the way.
[00:43:26.898 --> 00:43:27.578]  Right, exactly.
[00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:31.079]  So I would argue that she's involved in the cover-up of a crime.
[00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:32.600]  Would that be obstruction of justice?
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.620]  That's what I would call it.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.621]  I would call it that too.
[00:43:35.101 --> 00:43:36.342]  Amazing how she gets away with that.
[00:43:36.422 --> 00:43:39.424]  And I'm sure that's what Carlos Spalding will call it in the campaign.
[00:43:39.604 --> 00:43:41.825]  So, look, is it a long shot?
[00:43:41.905 --> 00:43:46.609]  Sure, it's a long shot, just like the fight against Maxine Waters is a long shot.
[00:43:47.129 --> 00:43:48.029]  Is it impossible?
[00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.732]  As Donald Trump showed us last year, nothing is impossible.
[00:43:52.072 --> 00:43:58.194]  Especially if the Patriots are behind this movement, which I'm expecting this momentum to continue to the midterm elections.
[00:43:58.234 --> 00:43:59.495]  I don't see why it wouldn't.
[00:43:59.855 --> 00:44:10.779]  And it's just amazing to me, Roger, when you talk about these politicians, you know, part of the reason why they're so corrupt, part of the reason why we see them doing the things they do and we just scratch our heads is because they're so desperate for votes.
[00:44:10.799 --> 00:44:12.400]  They're so desperate to stay in office.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.501]  I mean, that's all some of these people can think about, but they don't realize
[00:44:16.061 --> 00:44:26.309]  That Maxine Waters, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Elizabeth Warren, all these people that are about to be up for re-election, they've been shooting themselves in the foot since President Trump was elected.
[00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.491]  They have been only hurting their chances to win.
[00:44:28.531 --> 00:44:31.714]  I don't even think they understand how they're essentially their own worst enemy now.
[00:44:32.494 --> 00:44:36.338]  I agree with that, but the Democrats' game plan I think is pretty clear here, Owen.
[00:44:36.378 --> 00:44:52.552]  They intend to stall the Russian investigation as long as possible in the hopes that they can secure a House majority, and then based on any crap that Robert Mueller comes up with, they will use that as the basis for an impeachment move on our president.
[00:44:53.547 --> 00:44:54.387]  How do you deal with that?
[00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:55.308]  It's very simple.
[00:44:55.808 --> 00:44:57.349]  They want to impeach our president.
[00:44:57.429 --> 00:45:00.030]  We need to indict and jail their president.
[00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:10.895]  Barack Obama presided over the mass, national, unconstitutional, illegal surveillance of hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[00:45:11.035 --> 00:45:12.096]  And maybe over the Trumps.
[00:45:12.496 --> 00:45:13.577]  Maybe over the Trumps as well.
[00:45:14.437 --> 00:45:17.759]  And therefore, what did the president know and when did he know it?
[00:45:18.779 --> 00:45:24.723]  Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, James Clapper, Admiral Rogers, what did they know?
[00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:26.123]  It's handcuff time!
[00:45:26.364 --> 00:45:28.605]  These are serious, serious violations.
[00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:31.747]  You know, I completely agree and I think that the legal
[00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:40.512]  The legal process that's going to have to take place is you're going to have to get someone like a Comey, maybe Comey's the one, or they got to get somebody that can sing.
[00:45:40.992 --> 00:45:49.896]  You get someone that can sing, you indict them, they're shaking in their little space boots up there in front of the judge, oh my gosh, I can't lie, I'm under oath, oh, oh, and then they just sing.
[00:45:49.936 --> 00:45:56.779]  It was Hillary that told me to do this, it was Debbie Washburn Schultz that did this, it was, you know, Loretta Lynch that did this, and then we've got all of them right there.
[00:45:56.819 --> 00:45:58.160]  I think that that's how this might go.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.561]  I'm just not sure who that little birdie might be.
[00:46:01.181 --> 00:46:10.927]  Well, look, it remains to be seen, but these crimes, as exposed by Circa News, make Watergate pale in comparison.
[00:46:11.548 --> 00:46:17.071]  Never mind the Russian collusion delusion, which is a scandal without evidence.
[00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:19.213]  It's a scandal where there's no there there.
[00:46:19.233 --> 00:46:20.874]  The President's exactly right.
[00:46:21.014 --> 00:46:22.115]  It's a witch hunt.
[00:46:24.335 --> 00:46:25.316]  Donnie Jr.
[00:46:25.456 --> 00:46:28.078]  met with a Russian lawyer who had nothing.
[00:46:28.758 --> 00:46:30.520]  B.F.D.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.461]  No violation of law.
[00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:36.644]  Nothing there that is improper or illegal.
[00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:42.769]  No, in fact, the only law that may have been violated was Natalie Veselnitskaya here in the first place.
[00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:44.410]  Who cleared her to be here?
[00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.771]  She was not here legally.
[00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:47.012]  Where's that investigation?
[00:46:47.032 --> 00:46:50.534]  Yeah, it's very interesting that the Obama Justice Department let her in the country.
[00:46:50.554 --> 00:46:51.795]  Hmm, how could that be?
[00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:52.676]  How convenient.
[00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:54.118]  That she's in the country anyway.
[00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.121]  Smelling more like a setup every day.
[00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:57.764]  Doesn't pass the shmell test.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:07.739]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.410]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.470]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.511]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.551 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.532 --> 00:48:59.077]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.097 --> 00:48:59.957]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:00.017]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.741 --> 00:49:08.082]  Alright, so let me get this straight.
[00:49:08.422 --> 00:49:18.268]  Hillary Clinton, when accused of using her private email server to send out classified information, this while she was serving as U.S.
[00:49:18.448 --> 00:49:34.137]  Secretary of State, she immediately deleted her emails using bleach bit software and then physically smashed her hard drives after she was subpoenaed to turn everything over to Congress.
[00:49:34.577 --> 00:49:37.861]  They destroyed Blackberries with hammers in the State Department.
[00:49:38.122 --> 00:49:39.183]  That's not what we want in the presidency.
[00:49:47.868 --> 00:49:49.489]  Yes, they did, Brooke.
[00:49:49.630 --> 00:50:01.439]  As you mentioned, there were 13 mobile devices and 5 iPads that the FBI said that in some way were used with her private email server.
[00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:05.402]  And they did, in some cases, just destroy them with hammers when they were done using them.
[00:50:05.871 --> 00:50:11.014]  Yeah, but liberal logic says Hillary Clinton is innocent and the establishment left.
[00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:14.876]  According to them, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing.
[00:50:15.437 --> 00:50:17.438]  And now Donald Trump Jr.
[00:50:17.958 --> 00:50:20.840]  is accused of breaking campaign laws.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:29.363]  Because he had an email exchange and a meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:29.703 --> 00:50:30.543]  Don Jr.
[00:50:30.963 --> 00:50:35.365]  immediately published his emails, which showed no wrongdoing.
[00:50:35.785 --> 00:50:39.086]  But this time, Liberal Logic says he is guilty.
[00:50:39.527 --> 00:50:44.448]  They haven't found the exact law yet, but hey, he must be guilty of something, right?
[00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:48.690]  I mean, after all, he is the son of the evil Donald Trump.
[00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.913]  And there must be a Russian conspiracy!
[00:51:11.753 --> 00:51:17.218]  Uh, this is illegal, uh, and, uh, I think that this is treason.
[00:51:17.278 --> 00:51:20.822]  We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated.
[00:51:21.062 --> 00:51:26.006]  This is moving into perjury, false statements, uh, and even into potentially treason.
[00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:32.152]  Oh, as I've said many times in the past, there's another shoe that will drop and there will be other shoes that will drop.
[00:51:32.392 --> 00:51:33.994]  Treason is a very tight statute.
[00:51:34.014 --> 00:51:34.634]  You know it's not treason.
[00:51:34.654 --> 00:51:36.196]  The FEC laws are about solicitation.
[00:51:36.216 --> 00:51:37.417]  But Chris, you're a smart guy.
[00:51:37.437 --> 00:51:38.558]  You know this isn't treason.
[00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:40.720]  It's not my call.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.061]  Allegedly, Donald Trump Jr.
[00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:51.771]  tweeted to everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9th, 2016.
[00:51:52.331 --> 00:51:54.514]  So... Confirm that this is real.
[00:51:54.554 --> 00:51:55.214]  How do they do that?
[00:51:56.015 --> 00:51:56.476]  I don't know.
[00:52:11.392 --> 00:52:14.314]  You're not going to punish Russia for meddling with our democracy.
[00:52:14.955 --> 00:52:15.415]  We will.
[00:52:15.675 --> 00:52:17.176]  Definitely he has to testify.
[00:52:17.196 --> 00:52:18.617]  That email is disturbing.
[00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:22.339]  This week's new issue of Time Magazine is entitled Donald Trump Jr.
[00:52:22.419 --> 00:52:23.080]  Red-handed.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.541]  The Russia scandal hits home.
[00:52:24.681 --> 00:52:25.301]  Wait a minute.
[00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.082]  Hold on a second.
[00:52:26.342 --> 00:52:27.323]  Something ain't right here.
[00:52:28.263 --> 00:52:41.007]  Once again, you have the establishment left, you've got the neocons, you've got the fake liberal news media, all regurgitating, all parroting the exact same talking points.
[00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:49.170]  And once again, if you take a closer look and do some honest investigative journalism, you'll find out that the whole Don Jr.
[00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.932]  Russian conspiracy theory is one big giant hoax.
[00:52:54.452 --> 00:52:57.373]  Or, worse yet, it's a setup.
[00:52:58.013 --> 00:53:07.037]  And this is yet another example of why nobody trusts the mainstream media anymore, because if you take a closer look at Don Jr.'
[00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:14.420]  's so-called email scandal, you'll discover that this Russian lawyer looks more like a deep state operative.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:25.285]  First of all, she's not part of the Russian government, and as it turns out, she has lots of connections to all things anti-Trump.
[00:53:25.965 --> 00:53:27.466]  Here's the truth about the Don Jr.
[00:53:27.526 --> 00:53:27.866]  e-mails.
[00:53:28.106 --> 00:53:28.826]  There's nothing there.
[00:53:29.246 --> 00:53:42.052]  But considering the seriousness in the response from the liberal media and Democrats, the thinking person must wonder why there was no such outrage when Hillary Clinton illegally had classified e-mails on a private server, then deleted 33,000 e-mails, then smashed her old phone with a hammer.
[00:53:42.492 --> 00:53:44.174]  But what about Natalia Veselnikaya?
[00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:45.054]  Don Jr.
[00:53:45.074 --> 00:53:51.880]  didn't know he was meeting her, either her or Rob Goldstone lied about the premise of the meeting, and if he had known her name prior to the meeting, Don Jr.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.142]  would have known she had Obama fingerprints all over her.
[00:53:54.682 --> 00:53:59.427]  She was potentially in the country illegally, only in the country temporarily thanks to Obama's Department of Justice.
[00:53:59.887 --> 00:54:02.529]  However, that stay had expired previous to her meeting Don Jr.
[00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:07.633]  Eight days after the meeting, she was sitting next to Obama's Russian ambassador during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.
[00:54:08.334 --> 00:54:11.315]  So, Tim Cain, is Obama's DOJ guilty of treason?
[00:54:11.816 --> 00:54:14.797]  Who knew she was here illegally, and why no investigation into that?
[00:54:15.317 --> 00:54:20.220]  Veselnikaya's alleged law firm in Russia has no website, no working phone, and no email.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.761]  For InfoWars.com, who is Natalia Veselnikaya?
[00:54:24.161 --> 00:54:25.082]  This is Owen Schroer.
[00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:27.910]  That's right.
[00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.232]  Who is Natalia Veselnitskaya?
[00:54:30.452 --> 00:54:32.895]  That's what the mainstream media should be asking.
[00:54:32.955 --> 00:54:36.439]  That's what they should be investigating right now, but of course they're not.
[00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:38.882]  I mean, she's not part of the Russian government.
[00:54:38.922 --> 00:54:40.144]  She is a Russian lawyer.
[00:54:41.062 --> 00:54:43.383]  And, you know, she contacted Don Jr.
[00:54:43.503 --> 00:54:47.544]  through email during the campaign, said she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:47.804 --> 00:54:49.404]  They eventually agreed to meet.
[00:54:49.864 --> 00:54:54.266]  The meeting ended up being a huge disappointment because she had nothing on Hillary.
[00:54:54.626 --> 00:55:06.629]  Instead, they talked about U.S.-Russian relations, which left everyone to believe that perhaps the dirt on Hillary was an excuse to get her foot in the door and arrange a meeting with Trump Jr.
[00:55:07.509 --> 00:55:16.176]  But now we're finding out she might be a deep state operative, a Democrat plant to take down the President of the United States.
[00:55:16.256 --> 00:55:17.076]  Now, check this out.
[00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:19.258]  This is about to get very, very interesting.
[00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:26.083]  Natalia Veselnitskaya has worked for the Democrats for a very long time.
[00:55:26.144 --> 00:55:30.407]  In fact, she has connections with Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration.
[00:55:30.647 --> 00:55:35.371]  She even posted a picture on Twitter from inside John McCain's office.
[00:55:35.991 --> 00:55:44.657]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, for some reason, made an exception and let her into the country without a visa.
[00:55:45.017 --> 00:55:46.718]  That's rather strange, don't you think?
[00:55:46.798 --> 00:55:54.803]  And notice, when we connect the dots, Natalia Veselnitskaya has connections to all the usual suspects.
[00:55:55.504 --> 00:56:01.227]  Most interesting, in my opinion, are her connections to Fusion GPS.
[00:56:01.287 --> 00:56:01.748]  Remember them?
[00:56:02.756 --> 00:56:22.252]  That's right, they're the ones that came up with the fictitious, sickening, and disgusting hoax called Pissgate, where they tried to convince the American public that Donald Trump hired prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and had them urinate on a bed where Barack Obama once slept.
[00:56:22.572 --> 00:56:31.621]  Of course, the entire story turned out to be total bullshit, but that didn't stop the news networks like CNN from running with it anyway.
[00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:32.942]  Fake news.
[00:56:33.383 --> 00:56:42.652]  It claims Trump set out to defile the suite because President Obama and the First Family had once stayed there and Trump, quote, hated the Obamas.
[00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.816]  Do you need any more proof?
[00:56:47.216 --> 00:56:52.741]  So these are the kind of people and associates linked to Natalia Vesel Nitskaya.
[00:56:53.161 --> 00:56:54.863]  All things anti-Trump.
[00:56:55.183 --> 00:57:00.267]  Now look, all the mainstream media had to do was simply look at her social media.
[00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:09.215]  Her Facebook and Twitter pages are full of anti-Trump posts, including pictures of her actually attending anti-Trump rallies.
[00:57:09.855 --> 00:57:13.917]  And she's out there pushing the fake Trump-Russian conspiracy theory.
[00:57:14.257 --> 00:57:19.659]  We've got pictures of her hanging out with the Obama administration, attending Senate hearings.
[00:57:19.999 --> 00:57:27.622]  Here she is sitting behind Obama's ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, in a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.
[00:57:28.323 --> 00:57:32.985]  And this was, by the way, only eight days after she met with Trump Jr.
[00:57:34.085 --> 00:57:51.195]  So the mainstream media is painting the picture that she is some kind of Russian government spy hanging out with Don Jr., colluding with Team Trump to undermine our election, rig the election in favor of Donald Trump, and undermine our democracy.
[00:57:51.595 --> 00:57:52.456]  Total BS.
[00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:53.957]  Don't fall for it.
[00:57:54.257 --> 00:57:55.658]  That's fake news.
[00:58:20.457 --> 00:58:21.518]  That's it for tonight's news.
[00:58:21.538 --> 00:58:22.498]  Thank you for joining us.

[00:58:42.891 --> 00:58:49.600]  Progressives call it fly over America, but those that live there call it home.
