[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.637]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:23.220]  It is Friday, April 7th, 2017.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.522]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:40.514]  After Trump fell for, or maybe pushed a false flag, wag the dog attack, CNN, Wall Street Journal, and the mainstream globalist warmonger press proclaim, now we have a president.
[00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.494]  Forget all that American first stuff.
[00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.896]  Meanwhile, it's Stockholm Syndrome literally.
[00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:49.637]  Another terrorist attack in the West reminds us what the endgame is.
[00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:54.799]  Regime change and chaos in the Middle East to bring balkanization and chaos to the West.
[00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.881]  But aren't those cruise missiles beautiful?
[00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:02.965]  And they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments.
[00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:05.007]  You can barrel that baby in solo.
[00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.568]  You ought to see it sometime!
[00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.328]  It's a sight!
[00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:08.870]  A big plane, like a 52!
[00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.490]  Vroom!
[00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.831]  It's jet exhaust!
[00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.514]  Frying chickens in the barnyard!
[00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.499]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:36.732]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:37.492]  I take this.
[00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:38.773]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:43.096]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:47.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.041]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.922]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:05.304]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.184]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.145]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.446]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:14.866]  I love it.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.629]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.810]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.778]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.420]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.882]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:15.460]  Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:30.565]  It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.
[00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:49.501]  There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council.
[00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:54.914]  And that was President Trump making his case for why he did this strike.
[00:03:54.974 --> 00:03:56.916]  This strike represents the first time a U.S.
[00:03:56.976 --> 00:04:01.940]  military operation has targeted the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.823]  Now, a lot of people are kind of confused on both sides of the aisle today.
[00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:08.245]  A lot of conflicting feelings.
[00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:10.287]  People are saying that this was rash.
[00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.650]  There was not an independent investigation that was taken.
[00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.232]  And they're also wondering, was this just
[00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:23.735]  A simple airstrike that took out an airbase there in Syria where these alleged chemical attacks were launched from?
[00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:35.541]  Or is this going to be the beginning of a new war in the Middle East where President Trump campaigned on staying out of the Middle East and putting America first, not making the Middle East great again?
[00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:38.202]  So some of his supporters are saying, look, you know what?
[00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:39.942]  He killed the Russia narrative with this.
[00:04:40.262 --> 00:04:42.783]  He's proving that he's going to be a very tactical president.
[00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:54.507]  This was a tactical move and it was meant to send a very direct message to China's president, who he was there having a meeting with him at the exact time that they were preparing the missiles for this launch.
[00:04:54.687 --> 00:05:00.329]  And surprisingly, many of his biggest detractors are now singing Trump's praises.
[00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:04.631]  They're saying that last night he actually became the leader of the free world.
[00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:08.754]  So again, these were 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles.
[00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.416]  They were fired from two U.S.
[00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.358]  guided missile destroyers there.
[00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:16.761]  This was a series of strikes on a Syrian airfield.
[00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:20.545]  This is believed to be the origin of the chemical weapons strike.
[00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.226]  Now, Syria denies this.
[00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:26.450]  They say they denied using chemical weapons in Idlib whatsoever.
[00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.773]  They did not and will not use chemical weapons on their people.
[00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:40.710]  What they did say, and what the Russians seemed to agree with, was that the Syrian army had bombed a warehouse belonging to rebels that contained chemical weapons.
[00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:53.478]  Now, the rebels deny this, and in fact the rebels were actually celebrating this airstrike because, as we pointed out, this wouldn't have helped President Assad to launch this chemical attack.
[00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.281]  But it would help the rebels, so they were celebrating today, of course.
[00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:02.264]  Now, they were responding, Syria responded to calls for an international investigation.
[00:06:02.284 --> 00:06:11.451]  They said that they wanted guarantees that any fact-finding mission into Idlib's attack wouldn't be, would be impartial and would not be politicized.
[00:06:12.092 --> 00:06:23.580]  But that's not going to happen now because what's done is done and any sort of investigation is going to have to justify these attacks launched by these, the strike that was launched by President Trump.
[00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:27.885]  Assad has responded saying that this was foolish, it was irresponsible.
[00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:32.069]  Senator Rand Paul as well has opposed Trump's airstrikes in Syria.
[00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:41.639]  He said the United States was not attacked here and that the president needs congressional approval for military action as required by the Constitution.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.742]  He calls on him to come before Congress.
[00:06:44.322 --> 00:06:47.964]  And have a proper debate before going to war with Syria.
[00:06:47.984 --> 00:06:57.390]  He also underscored once again our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different.
[00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:09.257]  Now the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has complained again saying that this the missile strikes there on us were one step away from clashing with the Russian military.
[00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:37.692]  Now, we know that the Russian military was given about a half hour warning there so they could get their personnel out, but he took to social media to say that the election fog has lifted and instead of an overworked statement about a joint fight against the biggest enemy, which is ISIS, the Trump administration proved that it will fiercely fight the legitimate Syrian government in a tough contradiction with international law and without UN approval.
[00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:38.192]  Yes.
[00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:03.539]  Biggest supporters are very upset about because they are seeing this as regime change.
[00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:07.342]  They are not seeing this as just one strike on an airbase there in Syria.
[00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:10.765]  And now that we have Rex Tillerson, U.S.
[00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:18.631]  Secretary of State, coming out announcing Thursday that steps are underway to remove the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power.
[00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:19.332]  Take a listen.
[00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:28.159]  I think further it is very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime.
[00:08:32.062 --> 00:08:42.274]  Assad's role in the future is uncertain clearly, and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.
[00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:47.489]  No role to govern the Syrian people, aka regime change.
[00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:52.072]  It's time for him to get out because he has been at odds with world leaders for the past six years.
[00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:58.716]  He hasn't just left, so now they're kind of saying, well, he's gonna leave now, peacefully, because there's no role for Assad.
[00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:04.179]  So this is kind of, is Donald Trump flopping on his campaign promises to stay out of the Middle East?
[00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:09.502]  Or was he just saying that a few days ago, that he was gonna leave Assad in power to confuse everyone?
[00:09:10.723 --> 00:09:13.885]  And to placate his base because that's, of course, what he campaigned on.
[00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:17.848]  Now, Trump's loudest supporters are kind of turning against him.
[00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:22.672]  We've got Nigel Farage saying many Trump voters will be worried about this military intervention.
[00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.672]  Where will it end?
[00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:32.179]  Ann Coulter tweeted out Trump campaigned on not getting involved in the Middle East, said it always helps our enemies and creates more refugees.
[00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:34.760]  Then he saw a picture on TV.
[00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:36.602]  And, of course, Paul Joseph Watson
[00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:38.043]  I said this as well.
[00:09:38.103 --> 00:09:40.464]  I guess Trump wasn't Putin's puppet after all.
[00:09:40.524 --> 00:09:42.966]  He was just another deep state neocon puppet.
[00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:47.289]  Now I implore everyone to check out the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.631]  Paul Joseph Watson was on with Bill Mitchell.
[00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:55.995]  So these are two very outspoken proponents of Donald Trump who are kind of agreeing.
[00:09:56.015 --> 00:09:59.418]  They're from the same side, but they're, I'm sorry, they were having some disagreements there.
[00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:00.738]  Very good
[00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:04.280]  Very good conversation that was had on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.441]  If you want to kind of see where both sides of Trump's supporters stand on this airstrike.
[00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:16.722]  Now, what's interesting is that we have, you think, well, what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have gotten elected?
[00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.023]  Would we have been any better off?
[00:10:18.063 --> 00:10:28.025]  Well, just hours before this launch was, this strike was launched, Hillary Clinton emerged from the woods to say that she believed that we should have taken out Assad's airfields.
[00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:28.565]  Take a listen.
[00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:44.982]  And I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.
[00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.572]  So it would have been just the same exact thing.
[00:10:49.592 --> 00:10:54.836]  That's how we kind of know that this was all predetermined and now you're agreeing with the neocons there and the establishment.
[00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.197]  It doesn't matter who you voted for.
[00:10:56.257 --> 00:11:01.180]  And oh, Hillary Clinton just proves once again she still, you know, got her finger on the pulse.
[00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:09.446]  But also take a listen to this extra creepy Brian Williams who was rushed in MSNBC to cover the breaking news.
[00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:14.190]  He's waxing poetic about the bombing, these airstrikes there in Syria.
[00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:20.360]  We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two U.S.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.341]  Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean.
[00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.703]  I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen.
[00:11:26.803 --> 00:11:29.004]  I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons.
[00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:39.369]  And they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments making what is for them a brief flight over this airfield.
[00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:40.909]  What did they hit?
[00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:42.030]  What are you convinced?
[00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.690]  Oh my goodness, so poetic.
[00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:50.572]  I mean, this is the propaganda machine in full effect out there just pumping this war propaganda.
[00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:52.752]  War, it's so beautiful.
[00:11:53.452 --> 00:12:01.274]  Now don't look at any of the bloody bodies that are going to be splayed all across the Middle East here soon, but just look at those beautiful weapons.
[00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:05.154]  And of course, you've got CNN host Fareed Zakaria singing his praises.
[00:12:05.254 --> 00:12:06.975]  Trump became president that night.
[00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:07.675]  Chuck Schumer
[00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:08.636]  I think?
[00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:49.901]  Right as President Trump was opening the door to Mar-a-Lago to welcome China's president and his wife China has generally sided with Russia in defending Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and it also Will now have to worry if mr. Trump might be prepared to order a similar strike on North Korea So could this have been a very tactical move to say look?
[00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:55.002]  We're here to we're here to bargain and he did say that he was very good at making deals.
[00:12:55.022 --> 00:12:55.042]  I
[00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:04.554]  I think that what is important to understand, David, is two elements in this.
[00:13:04.654 --> 00:13:09.362]  Number one, in order to refresh your memory and your audience's memory,
[00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:26.277]  I was involved with our military intelligence about eight, nine years ago, just before the Syrian civil war, when I literally went into Syria and Bashar Assad and his people interrogated me and then allowed me to travel all over the country for 18 days.
[00:13:27.257 --> 00:13:37.141]  What I came out of that was, and I reported this to my contacts in military intelligence, was a very simple point that Bashar Assad was not going to leave.
[00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:41.304]  And I had also worked against Hafez Assad, his father.
[00:13:41.444 --> 00:13:54.814]  So I understood very well that Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad, the all-Alawite community, which is a minority community in Syria, would still dominate a predominantly Sunni country.
[00:13:55.859 --> 00:14:13.129]  What happened subsequently was that Assad was not very effective in handling what was really a water war and the people from Homs and Hama came up and they were Sunnis and they protested the handling of the water distribution of food subsequently.
[00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:22.035]  Anyway, what subsequently happened is that our intelligence community through the CIA and other elements of the civilian part
[00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:23.336]  We're good to go.
[00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:57.766]  And I think the important thing to remember in both these gentlemen, and also the surrounding facts, is that President Trump initiated this strike
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:12.051]  Just at the moment when President Xi Jinping of China was literally at the doorstep of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:17.996]  And he did this, and I think our military did it, for very important reasons.
[00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:35.340]  Number one, it was a very clear message to President Xi more than to anybody else, more than Russia, more than the ISIS or anybody else that, listen, you, President Xi, you were involved in violence during the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
[00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:37.476]  You don't like violence.
[00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:39.276]  We don't like violence.
[00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:44.539]  But if you have any question as to the resolve of a president, i.e.
[00:15:44.659 --> 00:16:01.486]  Trump, as opposed to Obama or anyone else, let me reassure you that I will order a strike against some base, air base, which is not as relevant as anybody thinks, and it will be done in your presence.
[00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:09.150]  I think President Xi Jinping was absolutely stunned by what he saw and what he realized.
[00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:28.020]  That message that was sent to President Xi Jinping was also translated to Prime Minister and President and CEO of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, who has been playing around with nuclear weapons as a way of creating some leverage for negotiation.
[00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:32.179]  Our only negotiation, quite frankly, is through China.
[00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:39.202]  China can and can literally suppress anything that North Korea wants to do.
[00:16:39.942 --> 00:16:42.983]  Our military does not want to go into North Korea.
[00:16:43.023 --> 00:16:44.904]  They don't want to do preemptive action.
[00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:47.285]  They don't want to go into a war in Syria.
[00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:57.510]  Our military does not want to follow the neocons, even though some neocons correctly came in, but they were thrown out, thanks to Alex Jones, myself and others.
[00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.671]  Elliot Abrams didn't come in.
[00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:01.751]  A whole bunch of others didn't come in.
[00:17:01.972 --> 00:17:09.374]  But when we're talking about our generals, McMaster, who wrote The Dereliction of Duty, we're talking about general matters.
[00:17:09.855 --> 00:17:15.497]  They understood very clearly that war is not the solution to what our problem is.
[00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:18.878]  What is a solution is what I call the kabuki of war.
[00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:25.462]  In other words, we will show you what we're capable of doing at the right time in the right place.
[00:17:26.042 --> 00:17:32.548]  So the Syrian so-called attack was really done not for Syria, not for Russia.
[00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:34.589]  All of them were cleared beforehand.
[00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:36.351]  Russia understood this was happening.
[00:17:36.731 --> 00:17:38.012]  Turkey was informed.
[00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.374]  Every country was informed.
[00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.776]  Saudi Arabia, Israel, even Syria.
[00:17:42.836 --> 00:17:44.197]  Bashar Assad understood it.
[00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:50.172]  But the only people who were not informed was President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un.
[00:17:50.773 --> 00:18:01.678]  What this means now is that the matrix of negotiation with the president of China and North Korea has suddenly shifted to our advantage.
[00:18:02.138 --> 00:18:05.319]  For 20 to 30 years, I've been involved with North Korea.
[00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:07.400]  And quite frankly, it's been frustrating.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.821]  I've been held back
[00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:14.783]  On my capability to do regime change, because I knew exactly how to take down the North Koreans.
[00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:28.668]  The greatest fear China has, and has been a fear for the United States for the past 30 years, but has not been my fear, is the fact that we can literally destabilize the borders of North Korea.
[00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:32.729]  We can do it militarily, we can do it economically, we can do it politically.
[00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:41.831]  What Trump was doing and what the generals were doing was saying, look, we're not going to get into the business of attacking North Korea.
[00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:45.473]  We're not going to get into the business of destabilizing your borders.
[00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:57.618]  But if you don't change your behavior, we can assure you that we have the willpower to do whatever is necessary to inculcate and to execute whatever actions we need.
[00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:09.358]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:15.984]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.225 --> 00:19:24.493]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.397]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.519]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.344]  It works!
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:48.907]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:58.509]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.330]  A total 360 win!
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.192]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:04.252]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.438]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.119]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:21.699]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:28.943]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:36.767]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.289]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.915]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.038]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.740]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.301]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.522]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.542 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.934]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.238]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.462]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:28.143]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:33.345]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:37.106]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:44.908]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:48.309]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my feet.
[00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.970]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:56.867]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[00:21:56.888 --> 00:21:58.472]  No fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.462]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:08.843]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:20.105]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.405]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:27.546]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.047]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:33.287]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.389]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.750]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.631]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:52.772]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[00:22:53.833 --> 00:23:00.690]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:07.059]  We are following breaking news.
[00:23:07.139 --> 00:23:11.840]  Reports of a gas or some kind of chemical attack in Syria, killing dozens.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:20.663]  Well, not surprisingly, there has been widespread international condemnation, with many Western leaders already pointing the finger of blame at President Assad.
[00:23:20.744 --> 00:23:26.686]  With this scientific examination, it has been determined that Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, has used a chemical weapon.
[00:23:26.986 --> 00:23:32.188]  I've seen absolutely nothing to suggest that, or rather to lead us
[00:23:33.508 --> 00:23:33.989]  We're good to go.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.520]  So you're for all attacks?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.180]  All of you?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.480]  Attack a side?
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:50.600]  Yes.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:50.941]  Attack a side?
[00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:51.321]  Militarily?
[00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:16.230]  I think there's other options first, but I would be happy with that conclusion.
[00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:23.076]  So yesterday we laid out the limited options in Syria from a full-scale ground invasion to establishing a no-fly zone.
[00:24:23.416 --> 00:24:38.368]  I wanted to hear him say we're going to arm the Free Syrian Army, we are going to dedicate ourselves to the removal of Bashar Assad, we're going to have the Russians pay a price for their engagement, the Iranians and Hezbollah are also heavily involved.
[00:24:38.608 --> 00:24:41.390]  All players here are going to have to pay a penalty
[00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.031]  And the United States of America is going to be on the side of people who fight for freedom.
[00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.492]  What do you want the world to do?
[00:24:48.972 --> 00:25:04.857]  I want to stop the war and I want the children of Syria to play and go to school, live in peace.
[00:25:05.317 --> 00:25:07.337]  Together we can help them.
[00:25:07.617 --> 00:25:09.718]  Together we can save them.
[00:25:12.727 --> 00:25:15.595]  Why can't you stop the war?
[00:25:18.163 --> 00:25:19.324]  I don't know, Banna.
[00:25:19.544 --> 00:25:23.708]  I don't know why the world can't stop the war in Syria.
[00:25:24.268 --> 00:25:32.895]  So you say, you see these, you hear that plea from her, you see the images coming out of Syria, and you think the best policy for the United States right now is to do nothing.
[00:25:33.096 --> 00:25:39.281]  And I do think the time has long passed where we should be looking at strikes against Assad's chemical weapons facilities.
[00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:40.842]  I think something has to happen.
[00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:44.205]  I would encourage any kind of movement by the international community.
[00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:47.088]  I would advise that we have to strike them.
[00:25:47.168 --> 00:25:50.532]  But I think most of all, it requires a response.
[00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:51.773]  This is outrageous.
[00:25:52.153 --> 00:25:57.599]  Actually, given what he said yesterday, even if he hadn't said it, I believe there's a need to act there militarily.
[00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:01.923]  Mr. President, Mr. President, please.
[00:26:29.043 --> 00:26:36.351]  Please, in the name of every woman and child and elder who got killed by the Assad regime, please come in and help us.
[00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:45.501]  I'm sure they took note of what our Secretary of State said just the other day, that the Syrian people would be determining their own future themselves.
[00:26:46.202 --> 00:26:49.566]  One of the more incredible statements I've ever heard, that the Syrian people
[00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:54.348]  Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.
[00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.351]  You are fake news.
[00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:29.332]  Sir, go ahead.
[00:27:29.472 --> 00:27:34.015]  CNN and its co-conspirators have backed themselves into a corner.
[00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:36.237]  I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:27:36.277 --> 00:27:37.998]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:56.712]  I know, but aren't you... In the court of public opinion, the entire sycophantic, abominized media has decided to continue to lie in the filthy bed they made for themselves after they cozied up to the ever-so-charming, constitution-subverting former President Barack Obama.
[00:27:56.932 --> 00:27:59.896]  With a 35% approval rating according to Quinnipiac.
[00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:02.880]  That's lower than Obama's worst approval rating.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.146]  I'm sick and tired of this White House as I was sick and tired of the campaign.
[00:28:08.527 --> 00:28:13.413]  I am tired of difference being disrespected and mistreated by this White House.
[00:28:13.473 --> 00:28:17.658]  There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team was spied on illegally.
[00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:20.821]  There is no evidence that backs up the President's original claim.
[00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:32.495]  And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.
[00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:37.377]  Newsflash to all those overpaid anchors living in their plastic bubble.
[00:28:37.538 --> 00:28:43.841]  A vast majority of Americans have truly had enough of the blatant disinformation.
[00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:44.962]  It's different for the media.
[00:28:44.982 --> 00:28:47.883]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:57.268]  Just today, the FBI comes out and says that 30%, 30% of their domestic terrorism cases that they're investigating are from folks who are refugees.
[00:28:57.588 --> 00:28:59.970]  It's important not to label all refugees bad people.
[00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.110]  That's not why I'm here.
[00:29:04.692 --> 00:29:09.236]  I was just going to say, Congressman, it's time to go, but I think the TV gremlins did that for us.
[00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:11.779]  Look, I want to see an honest press.
[00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:16.823]  I mean, I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press.
[00:29:16.883 --> 00:29:19.606]  The press, the public doesn't believe you people anymore.
[00:29:20.222 --> 00:29:26.965]  He could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think.
[00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:28.946]  And that is our job.
[00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:32.667]  You know, basically they're defaming her without any reason to do so.
[00:29:32.907 --> 00:29:33.708]  Because she's a woman.
[00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:35.309]  Maybe because she's a black woman.
[00:29:35.689 --> 00:29:41.911]  I need Hillary to stand up right now and walk in and sue the United States of America.
[00:29:42.312 --> 00:29:44.713]  Was this an isolated incident?
[00:29:44.873 --> 00:29:47.954]  Or how about these bizarre green screen mishaps?
[00:29:48.154 --> 00:29:52.175]  Something is happening here and we're watching, we're scanning the skies for something else.
[00:29:52.295 --> 00:30:02.136]  Fast forward to the 2016 WikiLeaks release of flagrant collusion between the media Renfields and their power-mad vampiric masters.
[00:30:02.436 --> 00:30:07.477]  Did this rude awakening push the leftist mob back towards an ethical center?
[00:30:07.677 --> 00:30:08.337]  Of course not!
[00:30:08.478 --> 00:30:10.358]  They tried to hack us and they failed.
[00:30:11.038 --> 00:30:13.478]  The DNC did not do that.
[00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:16.819]  And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.
[00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:19.399]  But they were hacked and terrible things came in.
[00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:28.186]  And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so... they were... When I heard some of those things, I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page.
[00:30:28.206 --> 00:30:29.527]  It wasn't even in the papers.
[00:30:29.967 --> 00:30:33.771]  Next on the agenda was the rollout of fake town halls.
[00:30:35.452 --> 00:30:39.876]  Republican politicians facing fiery backlashes at Republican town halls.
[00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:40.897]  From Utah...
[00:30:43.137 --> 00:30:43.917]  To Tennessee.
[00:30:44.178 --> 00:30:48.360]  We will probably be implanted with chips.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:54.224]  CNN and the rest of the Legion of Doom do not speak to the American people anymore.
[00:30:54.244 --> 00:30:58.886]  Should President Barack Obama, the first African American president, apologize for slavery?
[00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:04.950]  They are speaking directly to themselves and talking down to the rest of us like we are children.
[00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.772]  Their message is peace and coming together in the country.
[00:31:08.252 --> 00:31:08.912]  What's your message?
[00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:12.014]  You don't believe that for one minute, do you?
[00:31:12.274 --> 00:31:13.175]  That their message is?
[00:31:13.355 --> 00:31:14.396]  Yeah.
[00:31:14.496 --> 00:31:15.337]  That's what they said to me.
[00:31:15.677 --> 00:31:15.997]  Okay.
[00:31:16.177 --> 00:31:16.878]  Yeah, believe them.
[00:31:17.118 --> 00:31:20.320]  Any protests over the deaths of these cops today in Baton Rouge?
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.241]  I don't know that.
[00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:27.245]  Any riots or protests over the police officers in Dallas, Texas?
[00:31:27.805 --> 00:31:29.646]  This anti-police
[00:31:30.703 --> 00:31:41.228]  Rhetoric sweeping the country has turned out some hateful things inside of people that are now playing themselves out on the American police officer.
[00:31:41.668 --> 00:31:47.670]  I want to know, with all of the black-on-black violence in the United States of America, was there any reporting on that?
[00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.451]  There was a black officer who was killed today.
[00:31:50.031 --> 00:31:51.332]  Was there any reporting on that?
[00:31:51.352 --> 00:31:53.873]  Sheriff, please, let's just keep the volume down here.
[00:31:54.193 --> 00:31:55.754]  So I offer a solution.
[00:31:55.914 --> 00:32:09.339]  To finally pull the plug on this propaganda mutation inhabiting your television, please be willing to open your doors to a whole new wave of media seeking the truth for truth's sake.
[00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:12.680]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:32:23.257 --> 00:32:24.818]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:25.078 --> 00:32:26.540]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.240]  Okay?
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.403]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:30.603 --> 00:32:32.304]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:32.324 --> 00:32:33.625]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:34.666]  This is Texas.
[00:32:34.906 --> 00:32:35.707]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.888]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:36.928 --> 00:32:37.569]  You understand that?
[00:32:37.729 --> 00:32:43.453]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:43.914 --> 00:32:47.757]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:02.628 --> 00:33:03.969]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:04.989]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:06.569]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.690]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.610]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.211]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:13.132]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:16.753]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.972]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:58.032 --> 00:36:59.693]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:21.172]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:49.463]  The hardest thing was
[00:38:18.155 --> 00:38:21.116]  Burying the babies.
[00:38:22.936 --> 00:38:31.758]  I myself buried 14 newborn babies that had been taken from their incubators.
[00:38:32.198 --> 00:38:43.141]  Now is the time to check the aggression of this ruthless dictator whose troops have bayoneted pregnant women and have ripped babies from their incubators in Kuwait.
[00:38:43.461 --> 00:38:44.981]  I cannot help but think of my nephew.
[00:38:46.258 --> 00:38:48.663]  Who if born premature might have died that day as well.
[00:38:49.184 --> 00:38:56.618]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:38:57.554 --> 00:38:59.675]  Alright, so that was the montage I put together.
[00:38:59.695 --> 00:39:00.516]  Let me tell you something.
[00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:04.118]  I remember this so clearly when this happened.
[00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:07.601]  Millions of us watched... Babies in incubators.
[00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:08.561]  Babies in incubators.
[00:39:08.661 --> 00:39:09.722]  Babies in incubators.
[00:39:09.742 --> 00:39:11.123]  I mean, millions of us watched it.
[00:39:11.523 --> 00:39:13.004]  She was a 15 year old girl.
[00:39:13.745 --> 00:39:18.568]  And this really helped, big time, generate the support to go into the workforce.
[00:39:18.588 --> 00:39:19.589]  Because we're the good guys!
[00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:20.049]  That's right.
[00:39:20.129 --> 00:39:20.689]  We're the good guys.
[00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:21.470]  We're going to help people.
[00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.091]  So, I mean, it was devastating.
[00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:27.454]  After we invited Iraq to go into Kuwait, because Kuwait was drilling into Iraqi oil fields.
[00:39:27.674 --> 00:39:28.755]  No one ever talks about that.
[00:39:29.375 --> 00:39:31.377]  It's always about Saddam invaded Kuwait.
[00:39:31.597 --> 00:39:32.177]  Here's the thing.
[00:39:32.558 --> 00:39:35.240]  Everything you just watched, all that testimony,
[00:39:36.314 --> 00:39:38.235]  Was complete bullshit, alright?
[00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:40.556]  They were all lying, alright?
[00:39:40.917 --> 00:39:49.121]  And that 15-year-old girl, she ended up being, we've come to find out, she was the niece to the Kuwaiti ambassador, right?
[00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:50.642]  To the ambassador to Kuwait.
[00:39:51.242 --> 00:40:00.808]  And she was recruited by the CIA, she was given acting lessons by a US PR firm in the United States, and her entire testimony was false, right?
[00:40:01.448 --> 00:40:06.454]  And even the President of the United States, George Bush Senior, was in on the big lie.
[00:40:06.774 --> 00:40:07.294]  So there you go.
[00:40:07.575 --> 00:40:12.760]  So we're not saying that no children died in the Syrian chemical attacks.
[00:40:13.201 --> 00:40:14.582]  I'm sure children did die.
[00:40:14.863 --> 00:40:19.247]  But we're saying this reminds us of that war propaganda, where the war drums are beating.
[00:40:19.808 --> 00:40:22.851]  And now we've got the UN ambassador.
[00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:24.791]  Nikki Haley.
[00:40:24.891 --> 00:40:25.511]  Nikki Haley.
[00:40:25.551 --> 00:40:26.152]  She's up there.
[00:40:26.172 --> 00:40:27.392]  Former Governor of South Carolina.
[00:40:27.412 --> 00:40:29.693]  Very powerful, emotional address to the UN.
[00:40:29.793 --> 00:40:31.533]  If you guys could cue that up for me.
[00:40:31.573 --> 00:40:32.813]  Let's take a look at that next.
[00:40:33.194 --> 00:40:35.854]  This reminded me of what you just saw in 1991.
[00:40:37.315 --> 00:40:37.775]  That's right.
[00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:42.036]  Let's do Nikki Haley and Donald Trump pretty much talking about the same thing.
[00:40:42.116 --> 00:40:42.856]  Babies dying.
[00:40:43.216 --> 00:40:44.917]  That was then and this is now.
[00:40:44.997 --> 00:40:45.417]  Check it out.
[00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:50.858]  Yesterday morning, we awoke to pictures.
[00:40:51.939 --> 00:40:52.459]  To children.
[00:40:53.561 --> 00:41:01.748]  Foaming at the mouth, suffering convulsions, being carried in the arms of desperate parents.
[00:41:03.029 --> 00:41:12.697]  We saw rows of lifeless bodies, some still in diapers, some with visible scars of a chemical weapons attack.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.161]  Look at those pictures.
[00:41:22.267 --> 00:41:24.948]  We cannot close our eyes to those pictures.
[00:41:25.968 --> 00:41:30.389]  We cannot close our minds of the responsibility to act.
[00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.711]  We don't yet know everything about yesterday's attack.
[00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:38.132]  But there are many things we do know.
[00:41:39.472 --> 00:41:46.494]  We know that yesterday's attack bears all the hallmarks of the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons.
[00:41:47.934 --> 00:41:49.495]  Using a deadly nerve agent
[00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:56.617]  Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children.
[00:41:58.158 --> 00:42:02.519]  It was a slow and brutal death for so many.
[00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:13.202]  Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack.
[00:42:14.942 --> 00:42:18.443]  No child of God should ever suffer such horror.
[00:42:19.366 --> 00:42:21.950]  So if you're going to manipulate people, you're going to do it with dead babies.
[00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:28.618]  That's the easiest way to manipulate good, hard-working Christian Americans and others who
[00:42:30.436 --> 00:42:34.019]  Appreciate baby life, you know, little baby young lives.
[00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:36.580]  Americans are compassionate people.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.383]  Of course, it's going to get everybody on board to want to go to war.
[00:42:41.403 --> 00:42:42.985]  I fell for it in the 90s.
[00:42:43.505 --> 00:42:45.766]  You know, when I saw that testimony, I fell for it.
[00:42:45.806 --> 00:42:46.647]  Millions of us did.
[00:42:47.087 --> 00:42:48.008]  And we were gung-ho.
[00:42:48.028 --> 00:42:48.829]  We were ready to go.
[00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:55.013]  I mean, the Gulf War was probably one of the most supported wars in American history.
[00:42:55.133 --> 00:42:56.434]  Everybody was on board for that.
[00:42:56.994 --> 00:43:00.496]  But it turns out that it was a fabricated lie that got us in there.
[00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:02.897]  And you know... Just like the second Gulf.
[00:43:02.937 --> 00:43:04.638]  Just like the second one, exactly.
[00:43:05.098 --> 00:43:12.302]  Now we also have another clip from CNN where a seven-year-old Syrian girl, she had a heartbreaking plea, why can't we stop the war?
[00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:17.965]  This was just the day before the missile strikes and let's check that out next.
[00:43:18.845 --> 00:43:21.187]  Bonna, do you blame President Assad for this?
[00:43:23.348 --> 00:43:23.568]  Yes.
[00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:27.200]  I am very sad about this.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.362]  100 Syrians were killed in Syria.
[00:43:35.283 --> 00:43:37.423]  They were not terrorists.
[00:43:37.783 --> 00:43:39.804]  They were just people.
[00:43:40.904 --> 00:43:42.985]  The world is watching.
[00:43:43.525 --> 00:43:45.866]  The world doesn't do anything.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.721]  If you watch her eyes, you can see her reading.
[00:43:48.881 --> 00:43:51.243]  Clearly pre-written propaganda lines.
[00:43:51.383 --> 00:43:52.544]  She's reading from a teleprompter.
[00:43:52.564 --> 00:43:53.625]  The whole world's watching.
[00:43:53.725 --> 00:43:55.026]  And the whole world is watching.
[00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.627]  And lo and behold, the next day we have the strikes.
[00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:01.310]  So, just telling you guys, just be very careful.
[00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.691]  Don't rush to judgment.
[00:44:03.271 --> 00:44:09.075]  I find it highly unlikely that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would do something like this.
[00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:10.797]  He's this close to winning the war.
[00:44:11.357 --> 00:44:13.058]  I mean, he's got Al-Qaeda and ISIS on the run.
[00:44:13.078 --> 00:44:14.519]  Now I'm going to take ten steps backwards.
[00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:17.040]  Yeah, I mean, so why would he do something like this?
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:29.786]  Look, he's going to regain power, or maintain power I should say, and like I said, this close to winning it all, why would you gas your own people and get the entire international community against you?
[00:44:30.026 --> 00:44:30.946]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:44:30.966 --> 00:44:31.506]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:32.207]  Ron Paul said it.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.242]  It looks like it might benefit Assad.
[00:44:35.282 --> 00:44:40.086]  So Assad, they claim, now went and released gas to kill a bunch of people.
[00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:43.289]  But, Daniel, we might not have much of a job here today.
[00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:51.077]  Because I looked at the New York Times to find out, to get the explanation, and they said, worst chemical attack in years in Syria.
[00:44:51.637 --> 00:44:51.997]  U.S.
[00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:52.878]  blames Assad.
[00:44:53.118 --> 00:44:54.860]  So, it's all over and done with.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.822]  But not quite so easy, is it?
[00:44:57.322 --> 00:44:58.763]  What happened four years ago in 2013?
[00:44:59.064 --> 00:45:04.768]  You know, this whole thing about crossing the red line.
[00:45:04.828 --> 00:45:08.912]  And ever since then, the neocons have been yelling and screaming.
[00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:16.278]  Even part of the administration is still yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gases on his people four years ago.
[00:45:16.678 --> 00:45:17.379]  Not quite true.
[00:45:17.719 --> 00:45:26.147]  Yeah, it was never proven, in fact, and the UN official Carla Del Ponte said that attack was most likely done by the rebels, based on the evidence.
[00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:28.029]  But here you have Nikki Haley, U.S.
[00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:35.816]  Ambassador to the UN, almost as we speak, literally, at the UN Security Council, saying, quote, we know Assad has used chemical weapons before.
[00:45:36.316 --> 00:45:36.857]  That's not true.
[00:45:36.917 --> 00:45:38.238]  It has never been proven that he has.
[00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:38.838]  He may have.
[00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:40.440]  We do know that the rebels have used them.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.221]  That has been proven.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.701]  And who would benefit?
[00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:51.064]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this, and take no size of this, and you were just an analyst.
[00:45:51.604 --> 00:45:57.287]  It doesn't make any sense for a sod under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[00:45:58.387 --> 00:46:04.870]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately, and he's doing this now.
[00:46:18.513 --> 00:46:22.657]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:46:22.898 --> 00:46:23.538]  I'm sick of it.
[00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:26.802]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:46:27.042 --> 00:46:40.236]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:46:40.476 --> 00:46:46.241]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:46:46.661 --> 00:46:50.545]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:50.565 --> 00:46:58.051]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:46:58.752 --> 00:47:01.454]  You pick a sword or something else, you're going out in the street.
[00:47:01.474 --> 00:47:02.835]  I'm not kidding.
[00:47:02.976 --> 00:47:07.740]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.495]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:59.062]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.082 --> 00:48:59.962]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:00.022]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:05.506 --> 00:49:10.491]  Well, there's a lot of conflicting opinions going around with Trump's decision to strike Syria.
[00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:21.061]  A lot of us being left sort of shell-shocked as his administration is proving that they're going to be in stark contrast to the Obama administration, striking fast and furiously.
[00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:25.024]  A lot of his supporters are saying, you know, this is not the president that I voted for.
[00:49:25.044 --> 00:49:28.287]  You said we were going to stay out of the Middle East, while others are saying,
[00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:32.565]  Tonight, you really proved yourself to be the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:49:32.925 --> 00:49:36.750]  I'm joined now by Kit Daniels, one of our lead writers here at InfoWars.
[00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:47.802]  And Kit, you want us to take kind of a different approach here and just look at some different bullet points, what they're not telling us about these strikes, and just some different options here, some different points to consider.
[00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:49.184]  So give us your take.
[00:49:49.264 --> 00:49:53.827]  Well, when I heard about the strikes last night, I kind of worried a little bit about it.
[00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:57.049]  But then again, I was like, you know, I don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction to it.
[00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.612]  You know, let me think about it and I'll wake up in the morning.
[00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:03.734]  I'll think about it more and come to a conclusion then.
[00:50:04.494 --> 00:50:05.515]  My conclusion is this.
[00:50:05.595 --> 00:50:08.617]  Trump responded to a false flag with a false retaliation.
[00:50:08.677 --> 00:50:16.343]  He hit an airbase that was a couple of shacks and a runway and maybe like some MiG fighters.
[00:50:17.163 --> 00:50:18.144]  Syria's not even using
[00:50:18.984 --> 00:50:23.965]  Their own fighters pretty much they're using so the Russian Air Force fighters.
[00:50:24.305 --> 00:50:36.827]  That's their air support So this basically been a slap on the wrist to Assad You know he I mean Trump did what he hit a training facility He hit six Soviet era MiG fighters from the 80s.
[00:50:36.847 --> 00:50:46.049]  They're probably built before I was even born He hit you know like I think it was like a munitions depot or not even that it's like a storage room and
[00:50:47.358 --> 00:50:49.859]  So he inflicted minimal damage to this airbase.
[00:50:49.899 --> 00:50:55.862]  And here's the key point, Leon, that really told me a lot about what was going on is the fact that the runway wasn't even hit.
[00:50:56.282 --> 00:51:02.865]  Now, if this was a bombing run in World War II and they hit only six planes, but not the runway, that would have been considered a failure.
[00:51:04.046 --> 00:51:06.407]  So that was one of the tales for me.
[00:51:06.827 --> 00:51:11.629]  And the second tale was when Trump gave a press conference about the strike.
[00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:13.986]  This is very unusual for him.
[00:51:14.046 --> 00:51:18.350]  He read the teleprompter like word for word without really any emotion.
[00:51:19.171 --> 00:51:29.961]  Typically Trump's the kind of guy he's authentic even when he's when he gives like teleprompter speech like well when I was at the RNC he was using a teleprompter but you can tell he was behind the words he was saying.
[00:51:31.002 --> 00:51:31.983]  It wasn't the case with that.
[00:51:32.664 --> 00:51:35.847]  Plus some of the words that he said were really carefully selected.
[00:51:35.907 --> 00:51:47.798]  He mentioned the children that died, but as Syrian Girl mentioned in this article that we posted about two days ago, the children in the photos had evidence of blunt force trauma, like they were hit in the head and killed.
[00:51:48.658 --> 00:51:50.320]  So yeah, so he's technically right.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.902]  These kids were killed, but it might not have been gas.
[00:51:52.942 --> 00:51:54.624]  And he also said that they were killed slowly.
[00:51:55.319 --> 00:51:56.360]  Well, so now what do you think?
[00:51:57.001 --> 00:52:07.675]  Because a lot of people were laughing that the Russians would actually take Assad and his regime on their word that they accidentally struck a building that contained chemical weapons.
[00:52:07.695 --> 00:52:09.657]  This was a storehouse by the terrorists.
[00:52:09.677 --> 00:52:13.942]  So the Assad regime actually came out and said, which I hadn't seen this yesterday,
[00:52:14.703 --> 00:52:17.584]  But they they came out and said, well, this was an accident.
[00:52:17.985 --> 00:52:19.305]  Everyone was like, yeah, sure.
[00:52:19.385 --> 00:52:19.565]  Right.
[00:52:19.585 --> 00:52:29.009]  Like we believe that story that you accidentally hit a storehouse where the terrorists were holding these chemical weapons and it was an accident.
[00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:34.892]  Is that what Trump and his team are taking as the evidence that Assad did this attack?
[00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:40.715]  And and obviously, we're not going to have a further investigation into this because now the damage is done.
[00:52:40.775 --> 00:52:43.776]  And what if the investigation proves that Assad wasn't lying?
[00:52:44.005 --> 00:52:45.326]  Well, Leanne, think about it this way.
[00:52:45.366 --> 00:52:48.728]  The deep state is against Trump.
[00:52:48.788 --> 00:52:49.949]  They're always going to be against Trump.
[00:52:50.149 --> 00:52:52.210]  They're going to be the ones that are leading the investigation.
[00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:54.612]  So what do you think the investigation is going to turn up?
[00:52:55.012 --> 00:52:56.092]  They're going to be against Assad.
[00:52:56.953 --> 00:53:03.817]  So they already have this, I don't know if it's a confirmation bias or not, but their investigation is always going to lead to the results that they want.
[00:53:03.957 --> 00:53:09.361]  Just like what we see with the whole global warming science, you know, science behind that, which really isn't science.
[00:53:10.181 --> 00:53:20.327]  But the point is that, you know, even if that it's a false flag, we would never be able to convince the media and Trump's enemies not to attack him over it.
[00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:24.734]  And by false flag, let's just let, you know, because everyone's like, oh, you think everything's a false flag.
[00:53:24.754 --> 00:53:34.181]  We're not saying that this was staged or that this didn't happen, but that in the way that it curiously happened, it's almost as if the facts don't matter in this instance.
[00:53:34.241 --> 00:53:38.565]  It's being used to strike immediately against Assad.
[00:53:38.605 --> 00:53:45.630]  But as you're pointing out, it wasn't even that huge of a hit for Assad, even though people are saying, well, now you're basically just helping to
[00:53:48.032 --> 00:53:52.775]  Strengthen ISIS and these terrorists because you took out, you know, some air bases there that Syrians.
[00:53:52.795 --> 00:53:54.636]  We didn't take out some air bases, just one air base.
[00:53:54.776 --> 00:53:54.996]  Yeah.
[00:53:55.216 --> 00:54:00.419]  I mean, that was the thing and they gave Russia plenty of warning, you know, to get their people out.
[00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:07.843]  And so it's like now you see Russia putting their ships in the Mediterranean to get in confrontation with us.
[00:54:07.883 --> 00:54:09.624]  If they're going to strike us, they would have already done so.
[00:54:09.664 --> 00:54:10.545]  They wouldn't move their ship.
[00:54:10.565 --> 00:54:12.686]  This isn't like 19th century Bismarck.
[00:54:14.026 --> 00:54:18.428]  No, they would have already struck us.
[00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:23.530]  So, you know, Russia is pushing their rhetoric right now, right?
[00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:36.716]  But the thing is, is that I said this on air earlier, is when marriage counselors will say that married couples, they usually form their strongest bond during a reconciliation.
[00:54:36.736 --> 00:54:39.697]  That's why a lot of people that get separated, they don't go through a divorce.
[00:54:40.497 --> 00:54:42.138]  They end up in a stronger marriage than before.
[00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:51.064]  And that's what we're kind of seeing right now is that Trump is in the position to just de-escalate this, you know, this tension with Russia over this.
[00:54:51.605 --> 00:54:54.867]  When they de-escalate, then they can join sides and go after ISIS.
[00:54:55.027 --> 00:54:55.227]  Right.
[00:54:55.387 --> 00:55:01.612]  That's the point you make here is that these strikes could trigger reconciliation and coalition with Russia to stop ISIS.
[00:55:01.652 --> 00:55:10.378]  Of course, Rex Tillerson made that point as well, that he hopes that this will enable Russia to really strongly reconsider their support of Assad's regime.
[00:55:10.478 --> 00:55:11.599]  So maybe kind of even
[00:55:12.159 --> 00:55:12.559]  We're good to go.
[00:55:34.693 --> 00:55:40.898]  Yeah, Liam, like I said earlier, you know, I didn't want to have a knee-jerk reaction when I saw this in the news last night.
[00:55:41.558 --> 00:55:45.381]  But, you know, people had good criticism of Trump over this.
[00:55:46.222 --> 00:55:47.383]  But, and some of it was valid.
[00:55:48.304 --> 00:55:51.046]  But the thing is, is that people are kind of assuming that Trump is stupid.
[00:55:51.606 --> 00:55:53.468]  I looked at this as Trump is smarter than me.
[00:55:53.628 --> 00:55:56.090]  And if I can see this being a false flag, and of course Trump can.
[00:55:56.949 --> 00:56:16.410]  And like, yeah, like you said with the North Korea and Syria thing, but also this destroys the whole Russia narrative because, you know, now you see CNN and John McCain and, you know, all the neocons, the leftists and Pelosi, they're all cheering Trump on, even though he basically destroyed their narrative that he's a Russian agent.
[00:56:16.653 --> 00:56:16.853]  Right.
[00:56:16.993 --> 00:56:17.833]  What do you make of that?
[00:56:17.893 --> 00:56:26.355]  I mean, that's the thing that is so frustrating to me is that you come out today and then CNN is praising him and they're saying, oh, well, he's he's the commander in chief now.
[00:56:26.435 --> 00:56:43.918]  And Brian Williams is talking about the beautiful bombs, the beautiful imagery from these weapons being fired off the coast, just waxing poetic about that is just so frightening to me when you have John McCain and Lindsey Graham and others just really cheering him on.
[00:56:43.938 --> 00:56:45.798]  I mean, that's odd.
[00:56:46.519 --> 00:56:47.660]  Well it is, but it isn't.
[00:56:47.781 --> 00:56:54.449]  It's like they're clapping that he, you've joined us, you've joined what we were pushing.
[00:56:54.489 --> 00:57:00.696]  Because of course it's CNN who's rolling out this seven-year-old girl who's saying, Assad, you have to stop Assad.
[00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:17.736]  I see that worried me last night, but then I look at the New York Times and it said out of all the military options presented to Trump, he picked the one that had the least effect as far as deaths and destruction of military assets.
[00:57:18.596 --> 00:57:20.997]  The most limited military option is what they said.
[00:57:22.137 --> 00:57:28.678]  So yeah, he basically neutered their argument against him about the whole Russian thing.
[00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:36.173]  And now he's basically showed North Korea and China that America's back.
[00:57:36.193 --> 00:57:37.253]  America's in business.
[00:57:37.273 --> 00:57:39.034]  Don't screw with us anymore.
[00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:39.574]  Right.
[00:57:39.834 --> 00:57:40.775]  We have a military now.
[00:57:40.795 --> 00:57:41.715]  We're not afraid to use it.
[00:57:42.055 --> 00:57:42.275]  Right.
[00:57:42.615 --> 00:57:43.696]  So it was a show of force.
[00:57:43.736 --> 00:57:52.499]  And me personally, out of principle, I was against the attack because I don't like seeing six soldiers dead for, you know, just they're here one day and they're gone the next.
[00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:53.179]  I don't like that.
[00:57:53.759 --> 00:57:55.180]  I don't like us getting involved in Syria.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:02.984]  But as looking at this from a tactical viewpoint, Trump, this was a brilliant tactical move by him.
[00:58:03.244 --> 00:58:05.065]  He really showed that he's a tactician.
[00:58:06.206 --> 00:58:10.789]  And a lot of people's minds is he's no longer the celebrity on The Apprentice.
[00:58:10.889 --> 00:58:12.650]  He's no longer a real estate developer.
[00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.532]  They actually saw him as being presidential in the sense that he's now a leader.
[00:58:16.843 --> 00:58:22.066]  Right, that's actually the rhetoric that he is now proving himself to be the leader of the free world.
[00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:40.214]  Kit Daniels, thank you so much for your insight on this, and it'll be interesting, kind of remains to see, is this just this one very tactical strike that he's going to take, sending a message to leaders around the world, or is this going to be that first strike that gets us into a new war in the Middle East?
[00:58:40.234 --> 00:58:45.717]  Of course, Rand Paul is saying that this is not going to help us in our national security at all, so it remains to be seen.
[00:58:46.557 --> 00:58:48.519]  Of course, this is happening right here on the weekend.
[00:58:48.539 --> 00:58:49.359]  Thank you so much, Kit.
