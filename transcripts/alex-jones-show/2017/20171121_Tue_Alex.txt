[00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:10.901]  Tuesday, November 21st, 2017.
[00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:16.225]  This year's come and almost gone.
[00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.466]  It's like a whirlwind.
[00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:22.530]  It's been a little over a year since President Trump became president-elect.
[00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.393]  Since we defeated the fake media, the controlled corporate press.
[00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:29.996]  Since we began the process of restoring our republic.
[00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:36.279]  Because we began to rekindle our spirits again and not let the globalists break our will.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.641]  But make no mistake, this is metaphysical.
[00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:40.842]  This is spiritual.
[00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:53.008]  The globalists are social engineers who lust after dominating and controlling people and breaking their will, breaking their cultures, and turning them into zombies.
[00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.770]  It is very exhilarating and very exciting
[00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:16.226]  But also paradoxical that when I see listeners of my television show, my radio show, the simulcast, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, they have light in their eyes, they're excited, they're involved, they are alive.
[00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:27.555]  And that when I see people that either aren't politically awake or aware or are political enemies, you cannot overestimate how slob-like, zombie-like,
[00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.026]  And enslaved they are.
[00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:42.876]  It truly is sad to see the majority of people under globalist control being shiftless, hateful, vicious, desperate, lost individuals.
[00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:58.449]  Now there's a small percentage of those that serve globalism that are totally conscious of it and are just very mercenary when it comes to following the central engineer's blueprint.
[00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:10.324]  That said, though, I don't get out in public a ton, but I recently, a few days ago, took my mother-in-law and my family to the shopping mall.
[00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.065]  It was a nice day.
[00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:15.909]  It was an open-air mall called The Domain here in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.010]  We went to three stores.
[00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:18.312]  We were only there about an hour and a half.
[00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:21.534]  I guess one restaurant, so four places.
[00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:22.936]  So I guess count in the restaurant about
[00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:26.738]  Three and a half hours.
[00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.240]  And I ran into so many listeners and so many fans.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.022]  It was very, very humbling because they had so much electricity in their eyes.
[00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:45.449]  And in one of the shops I went in, both the women that owned the shop were fans and listeners, but they were taking action.
[00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.390]  They've been visiting family and friends out in Oregon.
[00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.632]  During the election last year, they plastered the town.
[00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:54.954]  They said they had a few drinks to make it even more fun.
[00:02:55.514 --> 00:03:02.500]  Plastered the town at night with over 500 Hillary for Prison stickers that also have Infowars.com on them.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.440]  I thought, well, that's amazing.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.821]  Thank you.
[00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:15.049]  So I bought a jacket vest I was in there getting, and I went on down the street and ran into a really nice Hispanic couple who
[00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.891]  Also told me about how they put InfoWare stickers up in Austin.
[00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.152]  How much fun they had.
[00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:22.193]  Then I ran into another Hispanic couple.
[00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:28.556]  This guy's made an amazing app called the InfoWare that I just discovered again a few days ago.
[00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:29.797]  That's amazing.
[00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:32.298]  I might be working with him on some stuff.
[00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:42.623]  It was just it was just crazy how many of the people were so optimistic but were also taking action and knew that they were part of something historical.
[00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:44.504]  And look, Trump's not perfect.
[00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:45.064]  I'm not perfect.
[00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:45.625]  You're not perfect.
[00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.965]  But we've turned the corner on globalism.
[00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:51.886]  You know the New World Order is upset by the way they're behaving.
[00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:53.487]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:03:53.527 --> 00:03:54.847]  So it's Thanksgiving approaches.
[00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:56.848]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you out there.
[00:03:56.868 --> 00:04:00.309]  And I'm very, very thankful for all of our affiliates, our sponsors, everybody else.
[00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:13.272]  And just in closing here before we come back with the broadcast, I just wanted to say that we have Black Friday, Cyber Monday specials that are extended right into next week.
[00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:18.174]  But a lot of these sales are only one day only because we have limited supplies or while supplies last.
[00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:26.196]  So all the specials of yesterday, Brain Force 50% off and 25% off Pro Pure super high quality water filters, that is extending today.
[00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:27.236]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:04:46.262 --> 00:04:47.423]  The Melatonin you name it.
[00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:49.084]  That's knockout available.
[00:04:49.104 --> 00:04:55.129]  So there's just some of the specials Free shipping storewide we've decided to extend but we're gonna have to end that soon.
[00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.632]  Obviously info war store.com Info wars life comm we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:03.555]  But again, thank you all for being part of history Thanks for changing the world
[00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:08.714]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.416]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.478]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:20.523]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:27.328]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping store-wide and clearly the biggest sales in our history.
[00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:29.609]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.352]  We've got our new trophy, RainForce, 50% off.
[00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:35.534]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:36.034]  We're good.
[00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:28.779]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.772]  Brandon Tatum, the amazing
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:54.464]  Police officer, the oratory genius of common sense, the blast of the NFL, and last time I checked, had like 70 million views on one video alone.
[00:06:55.764 --> 00:07:01.546]  He is here in studio coming up to co-host with me in the second and somewhat into the third hour.
[00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:06.028]  It'll also be on with Owen Schroer on The War Room today, coming up at 3 o'clock Central.
[00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:08.428]  Robert Kiyosaki is going to be joining us.
[00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:12.030]  Colonel Tony Schaefer, high-level CIA connections.
[00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:19.313]  ...highest level, telling you three days ago this appears to be an attack on Trump supporters by a jihadi connected individual.
[00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:26.756]  He just has to say it looks like that because he's not supposed to give you the actual intel because there's a shutdown of this information.
[00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:35.379]  And I'm gonna explain to you later, here in just a few minutes, how they got the president maneuvered into not letting it be known this was ISIS.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.221]  So that they could then burn his administration.
[00:07:42.824 --> 00:07:47.248]  Because imagine, ISIS attacks and attacks a bunch of Trump supporters, Trump's approval rating goes up.
[00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.610]  The left don't care, they're just so bloodthirsty they want to kill.
[00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.712]  Allied with ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:07:53.493 --> 00:08:05.082]  Trump gets told, sir, don't let them know, it'll panic everybody, and also it's, you know, it's code to trigger the other cell, sir, and Trump's all into not letting you know what he's going to do militarily and keeping stuff secret.
[00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:06.904]  He goes, okay, we won't tell people.
[00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:13.869]  But you can't stop the Sheriff's Department, you can't stop the HRT, you can't stop everybody that knows the truth from getting the information out.
[00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:26.719]  I mean, the guy was a jihadi, he converted to Islam six months ago, shot a video, the White House has it, and our sources have seen the video, and they've talked to the folks that have the video.
[00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:34.065]  And it's him, beggared in Dallas, Steven Paddock, the reported shooter, pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:36.137]  What a lunatic.
[00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:39.279]  Just like Reality Winner inside the FBI NSA was doing.
[00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.600]  I mean, that's what this country's created.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:51.907]  It's what Stephen Colbert and CNN and all these New World Order, Harry Weinstein type folks have created, is a bunch of America haters so vicious, they think, well, ISIS hates America.
[00:08:52.927 --> 00:08:53.868]  ISIS hates cops.
[00:08:55.249 --> 00:09:00.212]  You go to a Black Lives Matter event, they've got ISIS flags.
[00:09:00.232 --> 00:09:01.593]  I mean, I've seen it with my own eyeballs.
[00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:03.174]  My crew shot video of it.
[00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:04.515]  You can't make this up.
[00:09:06.863 --> 00:09:10.746]  And James Browner will be joining us.
[00:09:10.806 --> 00:09:16.911]  He's the former Trump administration official who's leaked a lot of info that's proven to be totally accurate.
[00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:20.473]  And he will be joining us.
[00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:24.316]  He is the source of the information that's top-linked on NewsWars.com.
[00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:31.842]  Former Trump campaign official says Las Vegas shooter made ISIS tape and he's been told that by the Trump administration.
[00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:35.733]  I mean, Paul's headline's strong, but it just should be credible.
[00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:44.236]  A former Trump administration official says White House sitting on top Vegas shooter ISIS tape.
[00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:46.136]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[00:09:47.117 --> 00:09:48.017]  And it's all there.
[00:09:48.057 --> 00:10:02.122]  What he was told, exactly what I was told, why Trump was sitting on this, and why I didn't get that information out Tuesday, when other high-level sources said, no, it is ISIS, and they were planning a bunch of other attacks, and that's why the cops
[00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:12.268]  Down the street at some of the other hotels that I've been asked not to say the name of, but we have video, we were airing some of it last night, did shoot other gunmen.
[00:10:14.189 --> 00:10:19.332]  So they ended up stopping gunmen in at least two other places, but not in the Mandalay.
[00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:27.037]  That's why you hear in the first minute and a half, at least two different rifles
[00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:29.364]  Sounds a mile apart.
[00:10:29.624 --> 00:10:35.008]  First, far off, and then 30 seconds later, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:10:35.028 --> 00:10:40.813]  I'm going to play that audio and video coming up again, but this is just incredible.
[00:10:42.034 --> 00:10:44.916]  So that's all coming up, but oh, here it is in The Guardian.
[00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:48.939]  Oh, we told you this on Monday, and now The Guardian has to admit it.
[00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:56.225]  Las Vegas Sheriff Gumman planned to survive and may have had help, and now ISIS continues to take responsibility.
[00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:57.906]  That's Associated Press today.
[00:11:03.254 --> 00:11:04.274]  Think about all of this.
[00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:05.434]  This is incredible.
[00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:06.695]  Look at the target.
[00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:07.655]  Look at who got hit.
[00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:15.717]  Look at Trump and the military smashing ISIS that had been allied with the Democrats, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the globalists.
[00:11:16.157 --> 00:11:16.777]  They're mad.
[00:11:16.897 --> 00:11:17.877]  They want to strike out.
[00:11:18.257 --> 00:11:19.437]  They bragged they struck out.
[00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.618]  They killed 59 people, injured over 500.
[00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:31.180]  So that's all coming up today with these expert guests in studio and more.
[00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:40.194]  Meanwhile, the left is turning up the heat.
[00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:46.238]  Mainline, mainstream media analysts are saying, if you love dogs, you're racist.
[00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:49.040]  This is actually being taught in universities.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.083]  This is to create the total frothing fear and racial division in the country.
[00:11:53.623 --> 00:11:57.906]  And Newsweek has come out and blamed white Christians for the attack.
[00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:03.250]  So they call us conspiracy theorists for having real sources, real info that continues to be proven right.
[00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:06.693]  And meanwhile, Newsweek is point blank
[00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:13.967]  Blaming Christians for what happened with no proof.
[00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.671]  Absolutely incredible when it's admitted this guy was not a Christian.
[00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:27.799]  In fact, evidence is mounting that he was a leftist atheist that then flipped out and converted to Islam as we continue to see in the mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:12:28.737 --> 00:12:31.559]  All these feminists in Sweden and Germany and the U.S.
[00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:34.942]  converting to Islam, wearing hijabs, saying this is feminism.
[00:12:35.483 --> 00:12:38.365]  No, they just want to be rebellious idiots against the West.
[00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:42.789]  Anybody that hates America, anybody that hates freedom, they're into it, they love it.
[00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.433]  So it's all coming up, the bombshell, next chapter.
[00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:51.769]  Remember, they covered up San Bernardino for three plus days.
[00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.992]  First they said, may have been radicalized.
[00:12:54.032 --> 00:12:55.514]  Then, well, we think they were radicalized.
[00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:57.297]  Well, there was connections to other events.
[00:12:57.517 --> 00:12:58.799]  Well, they traveled overseas.
[00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:01.602]  And then five days later, okay, they were ISIS.
[00:13:03.064 --> 00:13:03.405]  Same thing.
[00:13:04.806 --> 00:13:06.348]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running.
[00:13:07.608 --> 00:13:12.970]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.350]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:16.911]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:24.094]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:27.655]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:29.776]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:13:30.416 --> 00:13:38.858]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:39.839]  They know how great it is.
[00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:44.540]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:48.181]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.722]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy,

[00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.359]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:22.760]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.961]  I want to thank you.
[00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:25.362]  We're all in this together.

[00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.031]  But these specials have got to end.
[00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:51.974]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:57.595]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[00:15:58.075 --> 00:16:02.657]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWars.
[00:16:03.677 --> 00:16:13.503]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[00:16:14.344 --> 00:16:23.710]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.072]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[00:16:27.672 --> 00:16:37.361]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:43.025]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.808]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[00:16:45.868 --> 00:16:46.809]  It's a limited edition.
[00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.351]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:56.317]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[00:16:56.657 --> 00:17:00.861]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:02.582]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[00:17:03.183 --> 00:17:03.543]  We're good to go.
[00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:25.244]  Says it all.
[00:17:25.364 --> 00:17:26.225]  Need I say more?
[00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.347]  You want to have a political message out there?
[00:17:28.387 --> 00:17:34.152]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[00:17:34.492 --> 00:17:37.555]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:43.581]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:46.642]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:55.348]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:59.190]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:09.481]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Lambe, or Come and Take It, in good old-fashioned English, t-shirts.
[00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.124]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[00:18:12.505 --> 00:18:13.586]  InfoWars.com.
[00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:14.126]  Spread the word.
[00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:15.967]  I designed this baby.
[00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:18.468]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:23.089]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:27.330]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.470]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.850]  It's been around about 19 years.
[00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:36.071]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:39.432]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:43.957]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[00:18:44.678 --> 00:18:45.559]  That's disrespectful.
[00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:49.603]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:57.132]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[00:18:57.533 --> 00:18:58.994]  Our republic is in distress.
[00:18:59.455 --> 00:18:59.916]  Ask me why.
[00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:02.477]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[00:19:02.638 --> 00:19:08.161]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[00:19:08.602 --> 00:19:10.123]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:13.145]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go ahead and put another shirt on.
[00:19:13.605 --> 00:19:15.787]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[00:19:16.387 --> 00:19:18.629]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:20.131]  It's all about freedom.
[00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:21.493]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:22.936]  Resist Tyranny.
[00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:24.579]  Made in America.
[00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:24.579]  1776.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.306]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:29.508]  The backs are really cool.
[00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:30.530]  Look at that back.
[00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.492]  That is pure Americana.
[00:19:32.717 --> 00:19:37.861]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:38.661]  The Dayglo.
[00:19:39.162 --> 00:19:43.245]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.046]  And this is my favorite ball cap.
[00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:46.747]  There's over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:48.028]  It's got the nice patch.
[00:19:48.368 --> 00:19:49.409]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:50.530]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.213]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[00:19:54.633 --> 00:19:56.214]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[00:19:56.454 --> 00:20:01.318]  Thank you all for your support, and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:20:26.932 --> 00:20:28.553]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:20:28.573 --> 00:20:32.655]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and you have not seen anything yet.
[00:20:34.056 --> 00:20:34.416]  Believe me.
[00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:54.526]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are powerful multinational forces working through orthodox Wahhabist Islam to launch terror attacks inside the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, the West in general, to drive us into political submission.
[00:20:55.731 --> 00:20:59.693]  And the left also uses the terror attacks to take the general public's freedoms.
[00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:05.197]  So now we see a bunch of Trump supporters gunned down in cold blood in Sin City.
[00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:08.118]  Hundreds wounded, 59 dead.
[00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:15.343]  And the answer is collectively that all of us must give up our rights.
[00:21:16.664 --> 00:21:18.985]  And that we as gun owners are guilty.
[00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:23.648]  And that the NRA isn't just terrorists, meaning gun owners, but that
[00:21:24.824 --> 00:21:26.545]  The NRA should be banned.
[00:21:28.947 --> 00:21:32.731]  That's a talking point on MSNBC, CNN.
[00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.273]  That's a talking point from Oberman at GQ.
[00:21:37.194 --> 00:21:38.315]  They want it banned.
[00:21:39.156 --> 00:21:40.977]  And simultaneously, they want
[00:21:41.721 --> 00:21:44.663]  The Department of Homeland Security just set up a Ministry of Truth.
[00:21:45.364 --> 00:21:47.005]  NBC News has been calling for it.
[00:21:47.445 --> 00:21:55.211]  ABC News to stop Alex Jones to not let me be on air because they want to preemptively say I'm a fraud.
[00:21:56.673 --> 00:22:00.015]  And then they misrepresent what I've said because they're the frauds.
[00:22:00.656 --> 00:22:04.559]  Alex Jones says there wasn't any shooter and nobody got shot.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.702]  And Alex Jones says there was more than one shooter.
[00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:14.480]  And Alex Jones says ISIS took responsibility, and that's not true.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.821]  All of that was in a Newsweek story.
[00:22:17.642 --> 00:22:19.563]  Waging war on common sense.
[00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:24.865]  Like I'd say no one got shot, but then there were multiple shooters.
[00:22:25.325 --> 00:22:28.047]  I didn't say that nobody got shot.
[00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:31.949]  And I was quoting ISIS saying they took responsibility.
[00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:36.231]  But that's what they do.
[00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:38.312]  They lie.
[00:22:40.629 --> 00:22:50.634]  Notice they'll say Alex Jones said this and won't even show a quote around it or won't even show a video because they are a pack of criminal liars and they know you know they're liars.
[00:22:50.874 --> 00:22:54.376]  They just hope if they tell bigger lies somehow you'll buy into it.
[00:22:56.937 --> 00:23:01.880]  This article out of QZ.com two days ago basically set the parameters of it.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:10.124]  Newsweek and others ran similar stories saying there's no way to report many of the fastest spreading Las Vegas conspiracy theories on Facebook.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:18.643]  And they say, but Jones says ISIS took responsibility, and Jones says, but the Sheriff's Department says he didn't act alone.
[00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:28.428]  I was saying all this, you notice, before it was public, because I have sources, but they just act like I just make that up.
[00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:32.290]  Remember at first they go, Trump's not calling you.
[00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:36.127]  They go, well, we called the president and he wouldn't deny it.
[00:23:37.027 --> 00:23:40.510]  It's like we're not making any of this up with the huge whistleblowers.
[00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.453]  The media said it was fake when I said Matt Grudge was in studio.
[00:23:45.014 --> 00:23:46.415]  Sorry you can't get that interview.
[00:23:48.576 --> 00:23:49.998]  So, they're the liars.
[00:23:50.098 --> 00:23:51.499]  I'm not covering this to talk about me.
[00:23:51.839 --> 00:24:01.987]  I'm covering it because they're hearing the news saying, in these articles, flag Alex Jones' videos, ban his videos on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, and a bunch of them have been banned.
[00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:07.147]  And they go, oh good, it was banned where Alex said no one was shot.
[00:24:07.747 --> 00:24:11.048]  The video that was banned is where I said people were shot!
[00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:14.410]  See, they don't want you to hear what I really said.
[00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:20.052]  Then, after they start reporting this two days ago, here's a new article.
[00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:21.713]  Market Watch.
[00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:24.495]  YouTube cracks down on conspiracies.
[00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:25.295]  Fake news.
[00:24:29.292 --> 00:24:32.553]  Then they say, yes, one example is NFL anthem protests.
[00:24:32.573 --> 00:24:33.754]  They just banned that, too.
[00:24:34.374 --> 00:24:36.475]  Oh, thank goodness they're stopping the fake news.
[00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:42.817]  No, they're covering up the real news and other people's free speech that may not be completely accurate.
[00:24:42.877 --> 00:24:46.859]  A whole spectrum to set the precedent that if it's not corporate media, it's shut down.
[00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:47.459]  That's all.
[00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:55.130]  They don't seem to know the Streisand effect, that when they try to suppress speech, it makes everybody want to go see what it is.
[00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:55.751]  Here's another one.
[00:24:55.931 --> 00:25:00.834]  Las Vegas survivors furious as YouTube promotes clips calling shooting a hoax.
[00:25:01.055 --> 00:25:01.955]  I was furious too.
[00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:05.057]  But the point is, they still have that free speech.
[00:25:05.718 --> 00:25:06.779]  It shouldn't be taken down.
[00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:12.083]  So they use that rubric, they use that excuse, like, oh, let's just ban Nazi speech.
[00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:13.724]  And then next, your speech is banned.
[00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:16.386]  So that's out of the Guardian.
[00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:22.082]  YouTube institutes new censorship policy to stop Las Vegas conspiracy theories.
[00:25:22.422 --> 00:25:23.222]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.423]  Google apologizes.
[00:25:26.463 --> 00:25:32.844]  So, what they're really doing is saying, oh we apologize, like please don't throw me in the briar patch, when this is what they want.
[00:25:33.064 --> 00:25:35.805]  This is the censorship they promised to engage in.
[00:25:36.105 --> 00:25:43.446]  Meanwhile, I'm not calling for censoring the fake corporate hateful media, but here's Newsweek saying, Christian whites are to blame.
[00:25:43.606 --> 00:25:44.927]  White males are the problem.
[00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:45.787]  They're evil.
[00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:51.177]  Would they ever say Muslims are the problem after an Islamic attack and it's even proven?
[00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:51.677]  No.
[00:25:51.997 --> 00:26:00.281]  But when it's not proven it's a Christian white male, they come out and say it viciously when it was a bunch of white people, mainly, that were being targeted!
[00:26:02.202 --> 00:26:03.923]  There's the article on newswars.com.
[00:26:05.044 --> 00:26:10.567]  Newsweek demonizes Christians for Las Vegas Massacre.
[00:26:11.207 --> 00:26:15.129]  Far right won't accept killer was a Christian white male, even though there's no evidence of that.
[00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.751]  See how vicious they are?
[00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:21.654]  Talk about hurting the families, but you've still got your right to be dirtbags.
[00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:32.403]  Time Warner and Newsweek, and to tell us that Hillary won the election, and have a big color magazine showing her the night when she won, and it was all, that was fake too, but you'll never know it wasn't the night she won.
[00:26:32.603 --> 00:26:33.323]  You had to print it before.
[00:26:33.463 --> 00:26:34.524]  The whole thing's a lie.
[00:26:34.845 --> 00:26:36.866]  Even the photos aren't what you say they are.
[00:26:37.467 --> 00:26:38.948]  Because you're a pack of scum!
[00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:43.732]  And I get it, you know that we're beating you now, and so you want us shut up.
[00:26:44.272 --> 00:26:45.092]  Well, good luck.
[00:26:45.433 --> 00:26:46.913]  I'm never shutting up.
[00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:49.054]  And we're winning, and you're losing.
[00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:52.816]  And despite all your censorship, guess how many views?
[00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:53.976]  I didn't have time to count it all up.
[00:26:54.296 --> 00:26:55.156]  I had to stop it.
[00:26:56.537 --> 00:26:59.238]  Over 50 million views on our platforms extra.
[00:26:59.498 --> 00:27:01.939]  Not just our talk radio audience, not just our regular viewers.
[00:27:02.479 --> 00:27:04.700]  Over 50 million since Sunday.
[00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:10.943]  See, because people heard me Friday and Sunday say the mass shootings of big events is about to start in the next few days.
[00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.524]  And then the media shows that and goes, oh, look how kooky!
[00:27:16.745 --> 00:27:17.685]  He even said it before!
[00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:19.767]  And people go, kooky to say it before?
[00:27:20.168 --> 00:27:22.730]  See, they play this mind game where they're the authority.
[00:27:23.411 --> 00:27:28.075]  So if they tell you 2 plus 2 equals 100, it supposedly does, and they say it with a con man's confidence.
[00:27:30.878 --> 00:27:36.864]  Like, oh, Alex Jones claims Hillary Clinton collapsed, but she didn't, thinking you won't go look the video up.
[00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:41.107]  See, they take our strongest points, and they report on them like, oh look!
[00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:42.969]  He said it was coming the day it happened!
[00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.710]  What a kook!
[00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.111]  Like, he'll go, yeah, what a kook!
[00:27:45.572 --> 00:27:47.914]  He predicted it, right on target.
[00:27:48.134 --> 00:27:48.835]  That's really kooky.
[00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:58.024]  They think you're so weak-minded, there's an appeal to authority, that if it's the Washington Post, New York Times, or, you know, Raw Story, or whatever, you'll go, oh my gosh, this man is an outrageous kook!
[00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:14.287]  Look, he said that the Sheriff's Department believes there's more than one person involved, and they found paraphernalia tying him to leftist groups and ISIS, and that he pledged allegiance on a video to ISIS months before, and now it's coming out of the White House.
[00:28:14.647 --> 00:28:18.608]  Now we learn why they're sitting on top of it, and when we come back I'll explain.
[00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:28.378]  But it's all hidden in plain view, and now the top warfare experts are coming out, like Colonel Schaefer, and now the top psychologists and psychiatrists are coming out.
[00:28:28.538 --> 00:28:30.841]  They're all saying, look at the motive, look at the time, look at the age.
[00:28:30.861 --> 00:28:32.723]  It's just like hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:38.468]  It's just like the Scalise shooting, when they wanted to have a special election to kill all 15 members of the team.
[00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:45.874]  They plan this and they're moving and they're going to carry out the terror to bring in the police state that they themselves are executing.
[00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:50.258]  But we are aware of their plan and are blowing their operation up on the launch pad.
[00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:51.719]  Victory to the Republic!
[00:29:07.022 --> 00:29:07.862]  I'm going to shoot you straight.

[00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:27.225]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:30:27.665 --> 00:30:33.812]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[00:30:34.112 --> 00:30:36.114]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:41.020]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.

[00:32:10.913 --> 00:32:12.434]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[00:32:13.454 --> 00:32:18.056]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:32:18.076 --> 00:32:20.037]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[00:32:20.437 --> 00:32:22.018]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:32:22.218 --> 00:32:27.300]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.101]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:34.866]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:32:35.467 --> 00:32:35.827]  Secret 12.
[00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:38.170]  Optimal absorption.
[00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:43.155]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:32:43.595 --> 00:32:47.800]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.

[00:32:50.942 --> 00:32:54.784]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.110]  You've heard it here.
[00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.010]  I'm on television.
[00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.791]  Everybody knows it.
[00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:11.251]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:33:11.571 --> 00:33:14.653]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.492]  We have to find the people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:20.572]  No!
[00:33:21.073 --> 00:33:24.795]  You take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:25.776]  Shoot them dead.
[00:33:26.236 --> 00:33:26.977]  I'll pay for the bullets.
[00:33:27.237 --> 00:33:33.241]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:34.182]  I'd love to see that.
[00:33:34.302 --> 00:33:34.782]  In uniform.
[00:33:34.862 --> 00:33:36.564]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[00:33:45.379 --> 00:33:47.141]  I will not take your rifle away.
[00:33:48.483 --> 00:33:50.825]  I won't take your handgun away.
[00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:52.908]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:59.495 --> 00:34:00.096]  Don't run.
[00:34:00.276 --> 00:34:01.177]  We are your friends.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.541]  As they blast you in the back.
[00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.913]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to show some examples on Twitter of what the left is saying.
[00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:12.375]  They're like, we want to shoot Republicans.
[00:34:12.395 --> 00:34:13.416]  We're going to kill you.
[00:34:13.896 --> 00:34:15.197]  You deserve a firing squad.
[00:34:15.217 --> 00:34:25.587]  All this hypocritical, hateful stuff, and in between celebrating that a bunch of conservative white people died.
[00:34:27.995 --> 00:34:37.620]  They then have articles out saying I made it up, that the head of CBS Legal didn't say that, that their vice president didn't say it, that all these movie stars didn't say it.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.421]  They're all over the place saying they deserve it.
[00:34:41.021 --> 00:34:44.223]  It's so schizophrenic because they operate like they control reality.
[00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:52.487]  It's like if you walked in and a guy is on top of your wife in bed, it's your next door neighbor and you're like, Ralph, get off, get off Jenny.
[00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:55.596]  And he says, Ralph, I'm not here.
[00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:56.496]  Your wife's not here.
[00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:57.216]  We're not in bed.
[00:34:57.656 --> 00:35:00.358]  They're like, Ralph, I'm grabbing you by the back of your neck.
[00:35:01.378 --> 00:35:02.579]  I'm about to punch you in the face.
[00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:04.099]  You are in bed with my wife.
[00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:04.800]  He's like, no you're not.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:13.843]  I mean, they play these mind games like, Jones claims the Sheriff's Department says they believe there was more than one person.
[00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:15.944]  There's only video of them saying it.
[00:35:16.284 --> 00:35:17.245]  Jones claims
[00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:21.742]  See, what they've inadvertently done is, like, made me the symbol of fakeness.
[00:35:22.243 --> 00:35:25.144]  But they decided, Jones is now the symbol of fake news.
[00:35:25.984 --> 00:35:39.411]  And then all they did was make me bigger by always attacking me, and then saying, well, we can't get around the fact that it's ISIS, and there's a major cover-up, so just say that Jones said it, and then put him out there and just say Jones said it, so then they won't think it's true.
[00:35:40.185 --> 00:35:43.067]  Like, sir, the sky is blue and the public knows it is.
[00:35:43.087 --> 00:35:45.748]  Well, just say Jones said it's blue.
[00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:48.449]  And then if he says it's blue, they won't believe it.
[00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.291]  It's this weird game they play.
[00:35:54.813 --> 00:35:58.995]  And it just doesn't work, but they just keep doing it because they're delusional.
[00:36:01.161 --> 00:36:02.262]  It's a grand falloon.
[00:36:03.042 --> 00:36:12.049]  Kurt Vonnegut talked about people will just pick some mindless thing to celebrate, to have like this fake status, and then just go around delusional like they're still in charge.
[00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:19.855]  You're like a crazy person, you know, at the street corner that's schizophrenic and thinks they're Pope John Paul II, and you're not.
[00:36:19.955 --> 00:36:21.496]  You're a drooling crazy person.
[00:36:22.637 --> 00:36:25.599]  And the left is basically one step better than that at this point.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.261]  And they just don't get it.
[00:36:30.094 --> 00:36:31.054]  They just don't understand it.
[00:36:31.474 --> 00:36:35.436]  We've got a guest coming in here, Mr. Tatum, who did one video a few weeks ago.
[00:36:36.516 --> 00:36:37.776]  It's got over 70 million views.
[00:36:38.076 --> 00:36:40.037]  And every other video he's doing is getting millions of views.
[00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:44.658]  Out of nowhere, an articulate, smart, compassionate police officer.
[00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:49.100]  You can't compete with that when every video he does gets millions of views.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.420]  It's game over.
[00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:52.741]  People want that.
[00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:53.701]  They don't want you.
[00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:59.623]  If we have 50 plus million viewers and listeners a week, conservatively, lately it's way above that.
[00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.231]  We're bigger than they are.
[00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:04.552]  You're bigger than they are.
[00:37:04.812 --> 00:37:05.693]  They're a joke!
[00:37:05.713 --> 00:37:14.999]  They're just an organized group like syphilis or other diseases that are hard to get rid of, herpes, that won't go away.
[00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:20.783]  It's like back pain because you were in a car wreck and shattered your back.
[00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:21.604]  It won't go away.
[00:37:21.884 --> 00:37:23.805]  They just won't go away.
[00:37:25.586 --> 00:37:27.908]  And now they want to censor everybody and shut down
[00:37:29.096 --> 00:37:33.039]  Independent media and you read the articles where they want to shut down.
[00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:34.860]  It's a chronicle of how right we are.
[00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:42.786]  Jones says they found receipts in the hotel showing that he checked in two days earlier and a woman was with him and visited.
[00:37:43.446 --> 00:37:46.849]  Now the police department's come out and said exactly that a day after we said it.
[00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:55.575]  Jones says that they believe other people were helping him and that radicalization material was found inside of the hotel room.
[00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:57.797]  Days later it comes out.
[00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:01.871]  Jones says that ISIS took responsibility.
[00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.913]  And on stuff like that, ISIS did take responsibility.
[00:38:05.253 --> 00:38:06.234]  I didn't break that.
[00:38:06.654 --> 00:38:08.715]  They just go, Jones says it, see?
[00:38:09.176 --> 00:38:15.040]  Oh, well, that guy that believes that the moon's made out of cheese and that the earth is flat.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.883]  And then they say all these things I don't say, all these things I don't believe, just like they do to you.
[00:38:19.923 --> 00:38:23.826]  Just like they say, you're a racist because you don't like Obamacare.
[00:38:24.684 --> 00:38:26.485]  You're like, actually, I read the congressional report.
[00:38:26.525 --> 00:38:29.706]  It massively increases prices and was written by big banks to screw me.
[00:38:30.067 --> 00:38:31.087]  Oh, shut up, racist!
[00:38:32.388 --> 00:38:33.708]  But here's the big news, okay?
[00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.049]  I'm gonna get to it right now.
[00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:36.049]  It's up on newswars.com.
[00:38:38.314 --> 00:38:43.056]  And I say that because InfoWars is getting so much traffic right now, it's been bogging down a little bit.
[00:38:43.216 --> 00:38:49.018]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.com and NewsWars.com, but also have a lot of original content on them as well.
[00:38:49.478 --> 00:38:56.841]  One site's not big enough, obviously, to have stuff on the front page, so we've got the backup sites that are quite large in their own right, but I suggest you share those links.
[00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:00.623]  Here's the story up on DrudgeReport.com, the left-hand column as well.
[00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:06.645]  Former, very credible, high-level Trump campaign official,
[00:39:08.055 --> 00:39:12.437]  I think we should take the word claims out because he's a good, credible guy.
[00:39:12.477 --> 00:39:13.037]  He's reporting.
[00:39:15.158 --> 00:39:16.959]  Las Vegas shooter made ISIS tape.
[00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:19.601]  Well, that's what ISIS said on Monday morning.
[00:39:21.722 --> 00:39:24.783]  A former Trump campaign official is making extraordinary claims.
[00:39:25.303 --> 00:39:36.869]  He was leaked information from within the White House that Las Vegas massacre gunman Steven Paddock made an ISIS propaganda tape and that authorities are refusing to reveal the mass shooting was a terror attack.
[00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:38.753]  Now why are they doing that?
[00:39:39.154 --> 00:39:42.555]  And then letting the left run around and say that it's a Christian white gun owner with no evidence.
[00:39:43.195 --> 00:39:56.621]  Because they told the president, and I've been told this by Monday and Tuesday, that well we believe it can be code, it was supposed to be a big trigger for the all-out attack October 1st, and we just don't want what he wrote and what he said getting out.
[00:39:57.601 --> 00:39:59.403]  Because it's supposed to be the launch of this.
[00:39:59.823 --> 00:40:06.650]  The Democrats have already announced October 1st, all hell was to be released, to build up to November 4th, the final overthrow of the U.S.
[00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.110]  government.
[00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.873]  Mainline Democratic Party sites are saying that.
[00:40:11.274 --> 00:40:12.575]  But that's how they get the President.
[00:40:12.595 --> 00:40:16.759]  Because they know he's got a soft spot for, you know, keeping stuff secret materially.
[00:40:16.779 --> 00:40:19.722]  They go, sir, we don't want the enemy to know, and we don't want to give them the attention.
[00:40:19.902 --> 00:40:22.925]  Because pre-9-11, you never gave terrorists attention.
[00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:25.743]  Because then that only emboldens them.
[00:40:25.783 --> 00:40:27.143]  A lot of terror attacks got covered up.
[00:40:27.624 --> 00:40:31.946]  Hundreds of weatherman attacks and communist attacks got covered up in the 60s, 70s, early 80s.
[00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:33.687]  Because you don't want to give them the attention they want.
[00:40:34.327 --> 00:40:35.808]  So that's the argument they gave the President.
[00:40:35.848 --> 00:40:40.291]  Sir, we need to hold this off a while so that we can follow the leads and catch everybody.
[00:40:40.531 --> 00:40:42.792]  Plus, we believe it could be a mass triggering event.
[00:40:44.062 --> 00:40:45.303]  And that's indeed what was told her.
[00:40:45.643 --> 00:41:04.490]  And I knew this by Monday night, Tuesday, and this is the information I personally held back, even though I knew that the president was being manipulated on this, in my humble view, that's shown I have a little bit of gravitas at these things, researching it, being totally obsessed with it, being right in the middle of it.
[00:41:06.058 --> 00:41:19.624]  And that's why the police and the sheriff's department, the FBI, mid-level, low-level, started leaking the truth because they don't want to sit here and watch gut owners and Christians and conservatives and white people blamed as terrorists and let the media go with this narrative.
[00:41:19.945 --> 00:41:24.367]  It's going to come out, just like the feds ordered the other feds to be quiet in San Bernardino.
[00:41:24.807 --> 00:41:26.148]  They only held it back for three days.
[00:41:27.108 --> 00:41:32.490]  Now we're four days in, five days in, and the question is, will they be able to hold this back?
[00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.171]  That is the big question everybody has to ask themselves.
[00:41:36.191 --> 00:41:43.673]  But if you read the article, we have the links to where we said radicalization research, looking at radicalization because of the material they found.
[00:41:45.334 --> 00:42:03.631]  You see all of the reports we put out that have continued to be proven accurate, that they believe there was more people helping him, that he was on drugs, prescription drugs, anti-psychotics, that he did have a visitor, a woman, that he did have the two sweets, that he was there days before.
[00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:10.437]  And this is just us, with the great pool of investigative journalists out there, bringing you the information.
[00:42:12.287 --> 00:42:17.190]  And so you read the article, again, I'm not here saying how accurate we are, just to say it.
[00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.611]  It's so folks know there's a fight over the narrative.
[00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.592]  And they want to blame America for it.
[00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.574]  What conservative Christian would go shoot up a...
[00:42:25.578 --> 00:42:26.478]  Country music deal.
[00:42:26.559 --> 00:42:27.359]  It's just pure bull.
[00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:29.940]  It's a perfect ISIS-Antifa target.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.801]  They said they were coming October 1st.
[00:42:32.221 --> 00:42:32.782]  They did it.
[00:42:33.182 --> 00:42:38.325]  They don't want the president to admit this because they think that's the signal for the left to launch their main attacks.
[00:42:38.685 --> 00:42:39.325]  The signal?
[00:42:39.365 --> 00:42:40.646]  They already know it's the signal!
[00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:44.388]  More attacks are coming any day, any hour, any minute!
[00:42:44.488 --> 00:42:45.108]  You know it!
[00:42:45.808 --> 00:42:51.851]  Everybody has got to be watching their six right now, just like I said on Friday, and just like I said hours before on Sunday.
[00:42:52.092 --> 00:42:52.592]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:14.062]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:43:14.722 --> 00:43:21.866]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[00:43:22.306 --> 00:43:32.331]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in floralife advanced restoration.
[00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:37.836]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:43:37.876 --> 00:43:47.946]  But all of these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:53.752]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[00:45:22.955 --> 00:45:27.978]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:45:28.438 --> 00:45:34.581]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:36.902]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:45:37.202 --> 00:45:41.785]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[00:45:42.225 --> 00:45:43.726]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?

[00:47:18.278 --> 00:47:21.739]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:23.800]  Something.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.760]  Something you call love.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.001]  But confess, you've been messing.
[00:47:29.676 --> 00:47:32.117]  These boots are made for walking.
[00:47:32.197 --> 00:47:33.297]  I told you, CNN.
[00:47:35.178 --> 00:47:36.598]  I told you, Glenn Beck.
[00:47:36.838 --> 00:47:38.219]  I told you, Obama.
[00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:39.879]  I told you, Hillary.
[00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:41.740]  We're gonna walk all over you.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.940]  So get used to it.
[00:47:58.167 --> 00:47:58.447]  Yeah.
[00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:03.548]  Yeah.
[00:48:03.628 --> 00:48:04.409]  That's right.
[00:48:04.769 --> 00:48:05.089]  CNN.
[00:48:05.129 --> 00:48:05.709]  Ha ha!
[00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:10.870]  Well, I just bought a brand new box of matches.
[00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.251]  We're gonna have...
[00:48:26.432 --> 00:48:27.954]  Five day waiting period on matches?
[00:48:29.195 --> 00:48:36.981]  Well, Nancy Sinatra... For all her problems, was a good singer, and so was her daddy.
[00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:39.283]  But I tell you, she's a real pig.
[00:48:39.303 --> 00:48:44.307]  And I just bought me a brand new box of matches.
[00:48:46.408 --> 00:48:48.230]  And they were supplied by Nancy Sinatra.
[00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.313]  That's right, Nancy.
[00:48:53.014 --> 00:48:58.559]  The murderous members of the NRA should face a firing squad, she said on Twitter.
[00:49:05.685 --> 00:49:08.207]  Truly outrageous, truly hateful.
[00:49:09.388 --> 00:49:11.130]  And she's par for the course, like the
[00:49:12.944 --> 00:49:15.605]  CBS Vice President said the people there deserve to die.
[00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:16.506]  She's not sorry for them.
[00:49:16.526 --> 00:49:16.966]  They're white.
[00:49:17.406 --> 00:49:18.307]  They're Trump supporters.
[00:49:18.867 --> 00:49:25.551]  Just like folks in the Democratic Party said, well, Houston's white, so I don't care if it's underwater, even though it's 70% non-white.
[00:49:26.331 --> 00:49:27.172]  Talk about racism.
[00:49:27.392 --> 00:49:28.572]  Talk about self-loathing.
[00:49:28.853 --> 00:49:29.673]  Talk about hatred.
[00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:34.696]  But that's the disconnect of the Hollywood big media NFL elite.
[00:49:36.076 --> 00:49:40.559]  You know, Harry Weinstein, who is the embodiment of Hollywood,
[00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:47.350]  He's in a lot of trouble because women are coming out of the woodwork basically saying he's like Bill Cosby.
[00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:52.367]  Now that said, Hollywood has a giant pedophile problem.
[00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:54.688]  I've never heard that about Mr. Weinstein.
[00:49:54.728 --> 00:49:55.768]  I'm not defending him either.
[00:49:56.389 --> 00:49:59.590]  But I've never heard he likes little boys or little girls.
[00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:11.896]  So I guess if he was like Roman Polanski, he'd have Meryl Streep out there defending him for, you know, grabbing and basically kidnapping a 13-year-old girl and then raping her in a very painful way.
[00:50:11.936 --> 00:50:15.858]  I'm not going to go into details, but let's just say there were still sodomy laws at the time.
[00:50:15.878 --> 00:50:17.879]  There's also child rape laws still in the books.
[00:50:18.627 --> 00:50:20.748]  So, I'm not defending Weinstein.
[00:50:21.188 --> 00:50:24.610]  He's a real toilet bowl creature that's anti-gun, anti-American.
[00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.572]  He's pledged himself for the resistance more now.
[00:50:28.612 --> 00:50:32.154]  He's put out a statement, I'm going to really go after Trump and his supporters and the NRA now.
[00:50:32.435 --> 00:50:33.635]  Please don't destroy me media.
[00:50:33.815 --> 00:50:34.155]  Please!
[00:50:34.336 --> 00:50:34.696]  No!
[00:50:34.796 --> 00:50:35.756]  Don't do it!
[00:50:37.497 --> 00:50:42.220]  For, not the classic harassment where they make men and women liking each other illegal.
[00:50:44.295 --> 00:50:51.020]  But the real deal, like Al Gore does, where you invite a woman in to your office and it's like, would you like to massage me?
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.723]  I'm in a bathrobe, would you like to loofer my stretch marks?
[00:50:59.145 --> 00:50:59.466]  There it is.
[00:50:59.506 --> 00:51:01.947]  Glee actor takes plea deal on child porn charges.
[00:51:02.007 --> 00:51:03.649]  I mean, what is going on here?
[00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:06.210]  What is happening?
[00:51:08.492 --> 00:51:12.635]  And these folks are getting rolled up, they're getting arrested, but I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:51:14.278 --> 00:51:19.501]  You got the Deputy Pope just basically charged with over 100 children kidnapped in traffic.
[00:51:21.062 --> 00:51:22.963]  This is a nasty, nasty group of people.
[00:51:23.663 --> 00:51:25.284]  And that's why they hate flyover country.
[00:51:26.605 --> 00:51:28.966]  They don't like us, folks, because we like women.
[00:51:31.508 --> 00:51:32.608]  Our women like men.
[00:51:33.229 --> 00:51:35.270]  We just want to live our lives.
[00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.030]  We're happy.
[00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:38.211]  We got our heads screwed on straight.
[00:51:39.052 --> 00:51:39.572]  We're tough.
[00:51:39.632 --> 00:51:40.553]  We're enjoying life.
[00:51:41.413 --> 00:51:42.414]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but
[00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:45.512]  We don't live in catatonic fear.
[00:51:46.433 --> 00:51:47.574]  We know we're going to die.
[00:51:48.794 --> 00:51:49.715]  We're comfortable with it.
[00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:52.957]  But we want to have a good life for our children in the future.
[00:51:53.778 --> 00:51:56.200]  And we don't want you in our future, Hollywood.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.183]  You can be over there and you can enjoy yourselves and you're not going to force feed our kids anymore.
[00:52:01.604 --> 00:52:02.744]  You're not going to run our lives.
[00:52:02.764 --> 00:52:03.885]  You're not going to take our guns.
[00:52:04.906 --> 00:52:05.546]  You want to fight?
[00:52:05.666 --> 00:52:06.247]  You got one!
[00:52:08.086 --> 00:52:14.969]  But you do have Weinstein and all his 13 meetings at the White House with Obama and the fact that Hollywood thinks Obama's cool?
[00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:17.570]  That Obama thinks they're cool?
[00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.211]  There's nothing more uncool than Hollywood.
[00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:25.112]  And I'm not somebody that got rejected by Hollywood saying that.
[00:52:25.673 --> 00:52:31.735]  I've had Hollywood going from wanting me, looking for me, wanting to put me in movies, to begging.
[00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:34.996]  I've had the CIA beg me to stop.
[00:52:35.416 --> 00:52:37.477]  I've had Hollywood beg me.
[00:52:37.697 --> 00:52:39.737]  I've had them ask, whatever you want, whatever you want.
[00:52:39.997 --> 00:52:42.858]  I've had the people at the highest levels of globalism, just what do you want?
[00:52:43.439 --> 00:52:44.399]  You want 50 million?
[00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:45.739]  You want 500 million?
[00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:46.800]  You want sex?
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.300]  You want drugs?
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.040]  You know what I want?
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.721]  I want your head on a wall!
[00:52:51.961 --> 00:52:52.441]  Politically.
[00:52:53.382 --> 00:52:55.983]  I've come to destroy you and probably get destroyed in the process.
[00:52:56.363 --> 00:52:57.063]  I'm crazy!
[00:52:59.673 --> 00:53:01.674]  Just like you want to destroy me, you're crazy.
[00:53:01.694 --> 00:53:02.194]  Well, guess what?
[00:53:02.514 --> 00:53:04.795]  You found for every action, there's an opposite action.
[00:53:05.656 --> 00:53:07.077]  For every yin, there's a yang.
[00:53:08.637 --> 00:53:12.379]  For every child molester, there's somebody that wants to gouge your eyeballs out with ice picks.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.122]  For every Satanist, there's somebody that wants to cut your head off, Satanist.
[00:53:21.001 --> 00:53:22.742]  You want to have some little kid you can have your way with?
[00:53:22.762 --> 00:53:23.402]  You're all powerful.
[00:53:23.442 --> 00:53:25.303]  I want to get in a ring with you with a baseball bat.
[00:53:25.984 --> 00:53:27.164]  Let's just see who comes out of there.
[00:53:27.184 --> 00:53:30.206]  Because you're going to see a real demon once you get in a ring with me.
[00:53:30.726 --> 00:53:33.268]  Not the little fancy prance demons you think you've been dealing with.
[00:53:33.568 --> 00:53:35.109]  You people are under judgment!
[00:53:35.989 --> 00:53:37.210]  And it's only the beginning!
[00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.571]  And I love it!
[00:53:40.712 --> 00:53:44.094]  And God is opening the gates of hell!
[00:53:44.774 --> 00:53:47.956]  So that you can be taken back to where you came from!
[00:53:49.741 --> 00:54:02.323]  I'm gonna come back after this break before he joins us to play part of a five-minute powerful breakdown by Brandon Tatum at the Officer Tatum on Facebook Tatum Bug 34, YouTube BT Cruiser 34.
[00:54:03.444 --> 00:54:04.604]  So that is coming up.
[00:54:04.644 --> 00:54:06.144]  He'll be in studio with us riding shotgun.
[00:54:06.484 --> 00:54:11.485]  Colonel Schaefer of Army Intelligence and CIA breaking down the latest on the Vegas shooting.
[00:54:11.505 --> 00:54:12.385]  This is key intel.
[00:54:12.405 --> 00:54:14.706]  Needs to go mega viral.
[00:54:16.883 --> 00:54:19.984]  Very, very, very, very, very important.
[00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:31.049]  So, again, InfoWars has all the latest breaking news, but to see the mighty falling to our left and to our right, it's simply amazing.
[00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:37.311]  Now, I haven't even gotten really into the latest Vegas information.
[00:54:37.811 --> 00:54:41.653]  And again, when I keep saying, we were right, we were right, it's because they're all over the news saying,
[00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:53.956]  We're fake news and then saying things we never said and twisting things to then set the precedent to ban InfoWars material on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it.
[00:54:53.976 --> 00:55:06.902]  So that's why I keep walking through and prefacing our bona fides, our curriculum vitae, our history, and why they keep misrepresenting it because we carry the light in the dark of the night that they're so scared of.
[00:55:08.612 --> 00:55:14.995]  And you can go to the article by Paul Watson on NewsWars.com, and it's on the left-hand side partway down on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:55:15.495 --> 00:55:20.457]  Former Trump campaign official reports Las Vegas shooter made ISIS tape.
[00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:24.899]  Well, that's just what ISIS said on Monday.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:34.584]  And the AP reported they don't usually lie about what they take credit for, and now he's connected to a bombing in New York and the very same material, the very same fingerprint.
[00:55:36.078 --> 00:55:47.263]  And connected to gun running, and connected to Antifa, and radicalization, and we got the receipts, we published the receipts, we showed you the info, we said he had a lady in there days before, he checked in early.
[00:55:48.483 --> 00:55:49.664]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[00:55:49.744 --> 00:55:56.987]  This one article by Paul Watson chronicles it all, and the way Paul writes it, he just lets you make up your own mind.
[00:55:57.347 --> 00:56:01.429]  I'd have some headline like, TOTAL PROOF emerges that he was connected to ISIS.
[00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:03.070]  But the media is going
[00:56:04.534 --> 00:56:06.916]  To try to cover all this up.
[00:56:10.278 --> 00:56:11.218]  They're going to try their best.
[00:56:11.799 --> 00:56:17.002]  They're going to try to say Christians did it, with no evidence, but then say, oh, but don't look at the Muslims, and don't look at the target.
[00:56:20.324 --> 00:56:24.887]  Now, before we go to break here in just a moment, I want to just briefly
[00:56:26.078 --> 00:56:40.508]  Thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[00:56:41.228 --> 00:56:46.571]  And we're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:56:46.912 --> 00:56:54.337]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen
[00:56:55.365 --> 00:56:55.825]  And more.
[00:56:56.345 --> 00:56:56.966]  Concentrate.
[00:56:56.986 --> 00:56:58.766]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:00.467]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:57:00.707 --> 00:57:02.308]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:57:02.728 --> 00:57:03.588]  It's incredible.
[00:57:04.068 --> 00:57:05.989]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:08.110]  He's bigger than I am already at 15.
[00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.670]  Incredible.
[00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.891]  It is amazing.
[00:57:10.251 --> 00:57:11.511]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:12.292 --> 00:57:13.072]  50% off Caveman.
[00:57:13.292 --> 00:57:14.612]  But only a few days left.
[00:57:14.873 --> 00:57:15.633]  It's about to end.
[00:57:16.863 --> 00:57:17.503]  Okay, folks.
[00:57:17.964 --> 00:57:20.885]  Hour number two is only a minute and a half away.
[00:57:21.245 --> 00:57:25.047]  Then we're having an excerpt of Officer Tatum breaking down the latest on Vegas.
[00:57:25.107 --> 00:57:31.289]  And then he'll be in studio with us for the rest of the hour with Colonel Schaefer and much more.
[00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:37.292]  And then later, he'll be back with Owen Schroyer with The War Room, three o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:57:37.752 --> 00:57:40.634]  Mike Cernovich is coming up as well and a lot more.
[00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:41.814]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:41.894 --> 00:57:43.275]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:57:56.508 --> 00:57:57.389]  Let's talk to Danny.
[00:57:57.429 --> 00:57:58.270]  Let's talk to Dr. Grupp.
[00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:58.971]  You're on the air, Danny.
[00:57:59.372 --> 00:57:59.612]  Hi.
[00:57:59.712 --> 00:58:04.698]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[00:58:04.718 --> 00:58:05.039]  Thank you.
[00:58:05.059 --> 00:58:14.010]  I would like to ask Dr. Grupp, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:19.715]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that.
[00:58:19.815 --> 00:58:27.181]  But the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:36.529]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[00:58:36.949 --> 00:58:41.113]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[00:58:41.753 --> 00:58:43.574]  And it reboots itself.
[00:58:43.654 --> 00:58:45.736]  So, I mean, think about that.
[00:58:46.476 --> 00:58:57.964]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[00:58:58.044 --> 00:58:58.745]  Let me be clear.
[00:58:58.845 --> 00:59:06.010]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on bio-PQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:11.477]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[00:59:11.517 --> 00:59:12.378]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[00:59:12.679 --> 00:59:15.923]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[00:59:16.264 --> 00:59:17.645]  I took DNA for a few months.
[00:59:17.746 --> 00:59:18.947]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[00:59:19.268 --> 00:59:20.269]  The feeling is back.
[00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:22.092]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:23.734]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[00:59:23.974 --> 00:59:34.457]  Yes, and I mean the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[00:59:34.517 --> 00:59:36.738]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[00:59:36.818 --> 00:59:39.018]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[00:59:39.078 --> 00:59:42.019]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[00:59:42.059 --> 00:59:43.940]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.641]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:54.696 --> 00:59:58.799]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.681]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.763 --> 01:00:04.324]  Here we are.
[01:00:05.705 --> 01:00:06.285]  Tuesday.
[01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:08.367]  November 21st, 2017.
[01:00:08.427 --> 01:00:09.948]  This year's come and almost gone.
[01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:12.851]  Like a whirlwind.
[01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:35.620]  It's been a little over a year since President Trump became president-elect, since we defeated the fake media, the controlled corporate press, since we began the process of restoring our republic, since we began to rekindle our spirits again and not let the globalists break our will.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.141]  But make no mistake, this is metaphysical, this is spiritual.
[01:00:41.401 --> 01:00:48.023]  The globalists are social engineers who lust after dominating and controlling people and
[01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:52.332]  Breaking their cultures and turning them into zombies.
[01:00:53.653 --> 01:01:15.509]  It is very exhilarating and very exciting, but also paradoxical that when I see listeners of my television show, my radio show, the simulcast, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, they have light in their eyes, they're excited, they're involved, they are alive.
[01:01:16.676 --> 01:01:29.364]  And that when I see people that either aren't politically awake or aware or are political enemies, you cannot overestimate how slob-like, zombie-like and enslaved they are.
[01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:42.213]  It truly is sad to see the majority of people under globalist control being shiftless, hateful, vicious, desperate, lost individuals.
[01:01:42.773 --> 01:01:45.515]  Now there's a small percentage of those that serve globalism
[01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:57.746]  They're totally conscious of it and are just very mercenary when it comes to following the central engineer's blueprint.
[01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:09.648]  That said, though, I don't get out in public a ton, but I recently, a few days ago, took my mother-in-law and my family to the shopping mall.
[01:02:09.668 --> 01:02:10.288]  It was a nice day.
[01:02:10.308 --> 01:02:12.589]  It was an open-air mall called The Domain.
[01:02:14.228 --> 01:02:16.330]  Here in Austin, Texas, we went to three stores.
[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.591]  We were only there about an hour and a half.
[01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:20.834]  And I guess one restaurant, so four places.
[01:02:21.134 --> 01:02:26.058]  So I guess counting the restaurant about, I don't know, three and a half hours.
[01:02:26.899 --> 01:02:29.581]  And I ran into so many listeners and so many fans.
[01:02:29.742 --> 01:02:33.345]  It was very, very humbling because they had so much electricity in their eyes.
[01:02:34.365 --> 01:02:40.551]  And in one of the shops I went in, both the women that owned the shop
[01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:44.762]  Or fans and listeners, but they were taking action.
[01:02:45.163 --> 01:02:48.108]  They've been visiting family and friends out in Oregon.
[01:02:49.187 --> 01:02:51.948]  During the election last year, they plastered the town.
[01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.268]  They said they had a few drinks to make it even more fun.
[01:02:54.828 --> 01:03:01.810]  Plastered the town at night with over 500 Hillary for Prison stickers that also have Infowars.com on them.
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.750]  I thought, well, that's amazing.
[01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.130]  Thank you.
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:07.831]  So I bought a jacket vest that I was in there getting.
[01:03:08.712 --> 01:03:14.353]  And I went on down the street and ran into a really nice Hispanic couple who
[01:03:15.593 --> 01:03:18.194]  Also told me about how they put InfoWare stickers up in Austin.
[01:03:18.654 --> 01:03:19.454]  How much fun they had.
[01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:21.515]  Then I ran into another Hispanic couple.
[01:03:22.495 --> 01:03:27.857]  This guy's made an amazing app called the InfoWare that I just discovered again a few days ago.
[01:03:28.478 --> 01:03:29.098]  That's amazing.
[01:03:30.078 --> 01:03:31.619]  I might be working with him on some stuff.
[01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:35.120]  It was just it was just crazy how many of the people
[01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:41.992]  We're so optimistic, but we're also taking action and knew that they were part of something historical.
[01:03:42.812 --> 01:03:47.295]  And look, Trump's not perfect, I'm not perfect, you're not perfect, but we've turned the corner on globalism.
[01:03:47.515 --> 01:03:51.218]  You know the New World Order is upset by the way they're behaving.
[01:03:51.598 --> 01:03:52.819]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[01:03:52.859 --> 01:03:54.180]  So it's Thanksgiving approaches.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.201]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you out there.
[01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:59.644]  I'm very, very thankful for all of our affiliates, our sponsors, everybody else.
[01:04:00.664 --> 01:04:12.594]  And just in closing here before we come back with the broadcast, I just wanted to say that we have Black Friday, Cyber Monday specials that are extended right into next week.
[01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:17.498]  But a lot of these sales are only one day only because we have limited supplies or while supplies last.
[01:04:17.899 --> 01:04:25.525]  So all the specials of yesterday, Brain Force 50% off and 25% off Pro Pure super high quality water filters, that is extending today.
[01:04:26.374 --> 01:04:26.614]  I think?
[01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:45.880]  I don't think so.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.041]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[01:05:09.401 --> 01:05:11.743]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[01:05:12.003 --> 01:05:14.805]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:20.850]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support, and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:27.655]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide, and clearly, the biggest sales in our history.
[01:05:27.815 --> 01:05:29.936]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[01:05:30.137 --> 01:05:33.679]  We've got our new tropic, BrainForce, 50% off.
[01:05:33.899 --> 01:05:35.841]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[01:05:36.081 --> 01:05:36.341]  We're good.
[01:06:26.869 --> 01:06:31.097]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:31.538 --> 01:06:32.921]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:54.565 --> 01:06:57.527]  Well, this guy is the king of viral videos.
[01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:58.868]  He was doing them the last month or so.
[01:06:58.888 --> 01:07:02.831]  He's a police officer out in Phoenix, a patriot, a Brandon Tatum.
[01:07:02.891 --> 01:07:08.195]  And one video, last time I looked, I'm sure it has more now, from a week and a half ago on the NFL, had 70 million views.
[01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:10.316]  And I found out he was a listener when we had him on live.
[01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:21.244]  And so he agreed to come out on his day off from out there on the front lines of the war against crime and all the craziness in Phoenix and right here in the United States and come visit us.
[01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:23.486]  So it's great to have you here with us riding shotgun.
[01:07:23.686 --> 01:07:24.527]  Yeah, thanks for being here.
[01:07:25.067 --> 01:07:25.748]  Thank you for having me here.
[01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:26.028]  You bet.
[01:07:26.068 --> 01:07:26.288]  No, no.
[01:07:26.528 --> 01:07:26.868]  I love it.
[01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:41.480]  Wow, we just played one of your videos earlier at the end of the last hour, getting into the whole tragedy and the statistics and the facts and the reality that you can particularly speak to as a police officer with what's happening in Chicago and other areas versus what we saw in Vegas.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:43.761]  And I want to go there first, but have you seen this?
[01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:45.502]  I should open the show with this.
[01:07:45.522 --> 01:07:46.463]  There's just so much craziness.
[01:07:46.943 --> 01:07:50.964]  President Trump warns ominously, it's the calm before the storm.
[01:07:51.004 --> 01:07:55.605]  That's Zero Hedge at a meeting with generals last night, warning the calm before the storm.
[01:07:55.965 --> 01:07:58.506]  And then they asked what he meant, and he wouldn't say it.
[01:07:58.526 --> 01:08:01.927]  He just basically said, you know, you just better enjoy yourselves.
[01:08:02.347 --> 01:08:03.447]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:03.467 --> 01:08:04.708]  That was interesting when I heard that.
[01:08:04.788 --> 01:08:08.229]  And that's one thing I love about the president, is that he don't show his hand.
[01:08:08.689 --> 01:08:10.449]  And I think that he leaves everybody guessing.
[01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:13.170]  And I think that's his tactic that he uses, and it's powerful.
[01:08:14.534 --> 01:08:18.175]  He said, you know, you guys, what this represents, maybe it's the calm before the storm.
[01:08:18.215 --> 01:08:20.236]  He said it could be the calm before the storm.
[01:08:20.656 --> 01:08:21.517]  Let's play the clip.
[01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:26.678]  The audio is not great, but it's the only video and audio of this at a dinner with the generals and their wives.
[01:08:27.119 --> 01:08:30.500]  Kind of saying, hey, I mean, I do the same thing when everything's nice, everything's going good.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.401]  You know, there's always a storm coming, especially when a hurricane is about to hit Texas.
[01:08:34.421 --> 01:08:35.642]  We're like, this is the calm before the storm.
[01:08:35.942 --> 01:08:37.882]  Blue skies, but in two days it's going to be flooding.
[01:08:38.343 --> 01:08:39.243]  What is he alluding to?
[01:08:39.263 --> 01:08:41.564]  He's getting everybody a cryptic heads up.
[01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:41.884]  Here it is.
[01:08:55.183 --> 01:08:59.265]  We have the world's great military people in this room.
[01:08:59.285 --> 01:09:00.225]  I will tell you that.
[01:09:01.326 --> 01:09:03.627]  And we have great people.
[01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:06.328]  Thank you all for coming.
[01:09:06.888 --> 01:09:07.529]  Thank you.
[01:09:07.589 --> 01:09:09.669]  What storm is the President?
[01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:10.190]  You'll find out.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:11.890]  Give us a hint on your plan.
[01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:12.951]  Thank you everybody.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.441]  Glad the satellite news was there and able to get that.
[01:09:17.442 --> 01:09:20.383]  I don't think people realize just how precarious the world is right now.
[01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:21.364]  Right, right.
[01:09:21.564 --> 01:09:26.766]  I think this is, you know, this is a different time in our country.
[01:09:26.806 --> 01:09:29.267]  This is something that is becoming unique.
[01:09:29.788 --> 01:09:31.268]  Things are happening almost every day.
[01:09:31.648 --> 01:09:36.531]  You know, we have a wonderful president who's standing up for the people, someone who is
[01:09:37.051 --> 01:09:37.813]  You know, not typical.
[01:09:38.194 --> 01:09:44.773]  He's an amazing leader, in my opinion, and I'm excited for what he's doing and I think it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.742]  Speaking of holding things close to the vest, I get you don't want to tell military enemies what you're doing or what you're up to.
[01:09:51.743 --> 01:09:53.664]  And that's why they were able to crush ISIS so quickly.
[01:09:54.304 --> 01:10:05.029]  But I learned from folks who were pretty upset that they were blaming conservatives and Christians on Monday morning when they reportedly found ISIS material, just as ISIS was saying, and they normally only take credit if they've actually done it.
[01:10:05.349 --> 01:10:06.150]  Even AP admitted that.
[01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.471]  I got that from sources inside the HRT.
[01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:09.812]  I'm going to leave it right there.
[01:10:10.732 --> 01:10:16.514]  Then I've talked to some of the same folks more, and that's why the sheriff's come out and said, yes, he obviously had help, we can't get into it.
[01:10:16.834 --> 01:10:19.195]  And yes, we're looking at radicalization, meaning they found the material.
[01:10:19.655 --> 01:10:29.859]  But then the word I've gotten out of the White House and our stories on DrudgeReport.com is that they're sitting on it because they believe it was going to be a larger trigger, but now he's connected to bomb material from New York, the exact same signature.
[01:10:30.199 --> 01:10:32.680]  Not just the same explosive, the same explosive.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.482]  As you know, they contested a no show.
[01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:36.463]  They're shitting on it.
[01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:42.670]  And I just I don't know if technically that's good because Al Qaeda and the leftist groups, they know what they're launching.
[01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:43.591]  They know what's going on.
[01:10:44.051 --> 01:10:45.372]  I'm sure the president knows more than we do.
[01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:47.515]  But politically, this needs to come out.
[01:10:48.342 --> 01:10:51.123]  Yeah, but you don't want to send people in a firestorm.
[01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:58.206]  One thing that I've learned doing some things related to law enforcement procedures is that you don't want to show your hand.
[01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.327]  You don't want to let everybody know what you're doing.
[01:11:01.068 --> 01:11:02.288]  You don't want to tip off the enemy.
[01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:05.630]  Per se, as far as in our country, this is an enemy.
[01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.851]  And law enforcement is obviously something different.
[01:11:08.191 --> 01:11:09.931]  But you don't want to tip them off, man.
[01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:10.932]  You want to keep them guessing.
[01:11:11.232 --> 01:11:17.634]  If we have information that will lead us down a certain direction, we want to follow up, and we don't want to have them, you know, flee the country or hide.
[01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:20.215]  Well, he's always said, exactly, he won't politicize, and he's not doing it.
[01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:21.115]  Right, right.
[01:11:21.175 --> 01:11:23.356]  I think, you know, I think that's a good thing.
[01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:24.196]  I think that's a good choice.
[01:11:25.076 --> 01:11:33.119]  But then the Democrats are literally simultaneously saying everybody deserved to die there, the mainline Democrats, and then saying, oh, it's really a right-winger.
[01:11:33.775 --> 01:11:36.096]  Right, so I think that what they're doing is they're hurting themselves.
[01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:42.818]  I think that if we take a much more calculated approach, in the end result, it'll come out better.
[01:11:43.138 --> 01:11:48.039]  You know, if they can go and be radical and say all this crazy stuff, and then they look ignorant at the end of the day.
[01:11:48.119 --> 01:11:59.383]  So I think if we take a calculated approach, we take the smart approach, let them take the emotional approach, I think that we'll fare better at the end of the day when all the information come out and then we kind of figure out where this is leading.
[01:11:59.543 --> 01:12:02.624]  Well, knowing the lingo, when they say we're looking at radicalization, that means
[01:12:02.904 --> 01:12:08.009]  Generally they found material that points at that, but I have that from good sources that have given us great info before.
[01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:14.936]  So, I mean, I guess the Sheriff's Department, though, is kind of hinting at folks because he's having to sit there and politically hear all this baloney.
[01:12:15.296 --> 01:12:15.497]  Right.
[01:12:15.557 --> 01:12:19.341]  What you don't want to do is you don't want to come out, give you a hand, and then have to retract stuff.
[01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:33.090]  So, I think that the things that they've hinted on is saying, okay, we got a little information, we're not going to say everything, because then if the information changes, if we get new information and then contradiction information that we have currently, we don't want to have to come and retract and look like idiots.
[01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:42.257]  So, knowing the somewhat coded police speech that I've learned over the years just watching, being a police officer yourself, what have you gotten from these press conferences with the sheriff?
[01:12:42.757 --> 01:12:43.177]  I don't know.
[01:12:43.297 --> 01:12:43.597]  I don't know.
[01:12:43.637 --> 01:12:47.898]  I was a spokesperson at one point in time, and so I know that you can't give away everything.
[01:12:48.479 --> 01:12:49.739]  You have to be calculated.
[01:12:50.279 --> 01:12:59.001]  But I think that there's something that you want to give to the public, and it's okay to hint at certain things, so that you can give them some information without giving them everything.
[01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:05.763]  So I'm looking at their approach, and I'm watching it, and I'm saying, okay, they obviously have found something that have them
[01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:17.166]  Um, with a little bit of credence, because they wouldn't say radicalization, they wouldn't even bring it up if they didn't have something that could lead to... Well, I mean, I got this directly from the HRT people, not the ones that actually went in, but the group associated.
[01:13:17.206 --> 01:13:28.789]  They said, this is pure bull, this guy had Antifa stuff everywhere, and ISIS stuff, and trips to the Middle East, and then later it came out his wife, or his live-in, um, I guess you'd call it, uh, common-law wife was traveling to the Middle East.
[01:13:29.349 --> 01:13:29.929]  Right, right, right.
[01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:36.311]  That's very, you know, the thing is that these people that are in government positions, these people in law enforcement positions, they can't disclose everything.
[01:13:36.911 --> 01:13:39.712]  And the thing is that they may know a lot more than what they're telling us.
[01:13:40.532 --> 01:13:42.712]  And, you know, it's obviously suspicious.
[01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.493]  This is this is crazy, suspicious behavior.
[01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:56.336]  You know, having somebody with, you know, it's evidence that there was some type of extreme tactical planning that he did, sending money to a foreign country, you know, with his girlfriend.
[01:13:56.396 --> 01:13:56.956]  It's all
[01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:03.495]  A lot of suspicious things, but we cannot expect that to come from law enforcement for them to touch on something.
[01:14:03.515 --> 01:14:08.439]  What do you make of 23 guns, thousands of rounds of ammo, cameras in the halls, they now admit.
[01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:12.743]  I mean, everybody knows at big hotels, especially Vegas, they dig to your stuff when you're gone.
[01:14:13.003 --> 01:14:16.326]  There's no way, even if he was a VIP guy, that they'd let him do this.
[01:14:17.557 --> 01:14:22.503]  Yeah, that's one of the most suspicious things that I see as an everyday person, everyday citizen.
[01:14:22.563 --> 01:14:32.215]  Somebody that may not be doing a lot of research on these things, but just as a common citizen watching TV and looking at things in a logical perspective, this is troubling.
[01:14:32.255 --> 01:14:33.096]  This is something that
[01:14:33.957 --> 01:14:35.077]  It's very, very weird to me.
[01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:39.679]  How in the world can he get that many guns into a hotel room?
[01:14:40.219 --> 01:14:45.822]  How can he carry those items with the weight of all that ammunition, with nobody seeing him?
[01:14:46.302 --> 01:14:49.943]  You know, it would suggest that somebody else had to be helping him.
[01:14:50.003 --> 01:14:50.824]  He's not a young guy.
[01:14:50.844 --> 01:14:52.524]  He's not a young, strapping, fit guy.
[01:14:53.124 --> 01:14:53.485]  Exactly.
[01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:59.647]  And if you watch the video of the sheriff, he shakes his head and gets disgusted at that point and says, there's no way he did this alone.
[01:15:00.047 --> 01:15:01.107]  But we can't talk about it.
[01:15:01.127 --> 01:15:01.988]  He just shook his head.
[01:15:02.648 --> 01:15:05.229]  And then he talked about radicalization and then just shook his head.
[01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:05.870]  Right.
[01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:08.931]  The beauty that we have with a platform like this is that we can speculate.
[01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:10.232]  We can go into these things.
[01:15:10.252 --> 01:15:11.773]  But what would make him out of the whole press conference?
[01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:15.855]  The only times he, when he gives us the info, then he shakes his head and just looks disgusted.
[01:15:16.435 --> 01:15:16.555]  Right.
[01:15:16.575 --> 01:15:19.397]  Because he's probably disgusted because he knows more than what he's alluding to.
[01:15:19.437 --> 01:15:20.818]  He knows more than what we'll ever know.
[01:15:21.258 --> 01:15:24.740]  And so I think that he's showing a level of disgust, you know, with some of these things.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.941]  But the beauty is, is that we can talk about this.
[01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.101]  We can delve into this.
[01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:29.582]  We can get into the weeds.
[01:15:30.022 --> 01:15:30.643]  They cannot.
[01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:34.385]  A lot of that's because they can't give out the info in case there's other perpetrators.
[01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:37.587]  They'll know how to fix their story around what the police know and other reasons.
[01:15:37.647 --> 01:15:38.328]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:15:38.348 --> 01:15:40.109]  That's an investigative advantage that we have.
[01:15:40.129 --> 01:15:41.130]  We don't want to tip them off.
[01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:47.074]  I get all that, but if the left's trying to start a revolution with this not coming out, it's got to be balanced.
[01:15:49.069 --> 01:15:51.933]  I just, I know this source from the White House is good.
[01:15:52.274 --> 01:15:54.137]  They're sitting on top of an ISIS tape of this jerk.
[01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:59.464]  And just wait until it comes out, because we're going to shove it down the throat of the anti-American left.
[01:15:59.825 --> 01:16:00.525]  You get ready.
[01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:01.567]  You get ready.
[01:16:01.607 --> 01:16:02.168]  It's coming out.
[01:16:02.228 --> 01:16:02.829]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:08.307]  Let's talk to Danny.
[01:16:08.347 --> 01:16:09.208]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:09.929]  You're on the air, Danny.
[01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.550]  Hi.
[01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:15.617]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[01:16:15.657 --> 01:16:15.937]  Thank you.
[01:16:15.957 --> 01:16:24.949]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one if there is?
[01:16:25.049 --> 01:16:30.654]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that.
[01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:38.120]  But the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:47.468]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[01:16:47.888 --> 01:16:52.052]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:54.513]  And it reboots itself.
[01:16:54.593 --> 01:16:57.015]  So, I mean, think about that.
[01:16:57.415 --> 01:17:08.903]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[01:17:08.983 --> 01:17:09.684]  Let me be clear.
[01:17:09.784 --> 01:17:16.949]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:22.416]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[01:17:22.456 --> 01:17:23.317]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[01:17:23.618 --> 01:17:26.862]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[01:17:27.203 --> 01:17:28.584]  I took DNA for a few months.
[01:17:28.685 --> 01:17:29.866]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[01:17:30.207 --> 01:17:31.208]  The feeling is back.
[01:17:31.368 --> 01:17:33.051]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:34.673]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[01:17:34.913 --> 01:17:45.400]  Yes, and I mean, the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.682]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[01:17:47.742 --> 01:17:49.943]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:52.965]  Each person's different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[01:17:53.005 --> 01:17:54.866]  But yeah, we're running the biggest specials.
[01:17:54.906 --> 01:17:59.870]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:12.452 --> 01:18:16.214]  Just briefly, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:17.155]  He's about to retire.
[01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:24.199]  About 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:27.220]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.221]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:29.782]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:18:30.382 --> 01:18:33.664]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply in the Florida, so this is incredible.
[01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.065]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:18:36.105 --> 01:18:42.008]  They're covering for it, calling it Florida law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:18:42.588 --> 01:18:43.068]  Exactly.
[01:18:43.128 --> 01:18:49.111]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:18:49.171 --> 01:18:52.953]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[01:18:54.314 --> 01:18:57.856]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilic acid is a
[01:18:58.874 --> 01:18:59.254]  I don't
[01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:19.173]  American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:19:19.634 --> 01:19:22.135]  Why does it say nursery water that at the store was added fluoride?
[01:19:22.155 --> 01:19:25.056]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:19:25.096 --> 01:19:27.057]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:19:27.257 --> 01:19:38.822]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, private labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:40.382]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:42.183]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:19:42.203 --> 01:19:43.143]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:19:43.163 --> 01:19:44.564]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:19:45.004 --> 01:19:53.313]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:19:53.913 --> 01:19:56.836]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:20:08.857 --> 01:20:11.001]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:16.632]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:44.771]  Brandon Tatum is our guest in studio, a patriot police officer from Arizona there in Phoenix.
[01:20:44.952 --> 01:20:56.943]  Wow, that is quite a beat to work from I've known some other police officers that were there like Jack McClam even back in the day it was rough and he's here with us talking about what's happening in our world and how long have you been on?
[01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:05.610]  YouTube and Facebook because I've never seen you before and suddenly I saw this video with 30 million views now it's like 70 million views and all your other videos are getting millions of views.
[01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:09.193]  When you can consistently do that, that is really, really exciting.
[01:21:09.253 --> 01:21:11.755]  I mean the top CNN shows only have a million viewers.
[01:21:11.795 --> 01:21:15.858]  What's it feel like to have something bigger than CNN in your back pocket?
[01:21:16.779 --> 01:21:18.680]  I still, it's not soaking in, you know.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.461]  I take a very humble approach to it.
[01:21:20.762 --> 01:21:26.185]  You know, I'm just thanking God I had a platform to do certain things and to say, you know, speak my mind, talk about how I feel.
[01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:29.367]  You know, I've only been doing this for about 18 months.
[01:21:29.907 --> 01:21:30.747]  I made a couple videos.
[01:21:30.787 --> 01:21:33.409]  I normally type stuff out on my Facebook and a couple friends like it.
[01:21:33.829 --> 01:21:37.211]  And then after a while I say, you know, I'm better at talking than I am typing.
[01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:37.551]  Me too!
[01:21:38.932 --> 01:21:39.973]  So we have that in common.
[01:21:40.033 --> 01:21:43.177]  I'm better at talking, so I say, you know what, I'm just going to make a video about what I would say.
[01:21:43.197 --> 01:21:45.339]  Because I overthink it when I type.
[01:21:45.479 --> 01:21:45.879]  Right, right.
[01:21:45.979 --> 01:21:47.261]  I talk, I just say what I really mean.
[01:21:47.381 --> 01:21:50.724]  And then I got to worry about, you know, grammatical errors and stuff like that and spelling.
[01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:52.466]  So I don't have to worry about that when I talk.
[01:21:52.486 --> 01:21:54.007]  So it works out well for me.
[01:21:54.047 --> 01:21:57.091]  So I'm enjoying the fact that I feel like I'm impacting people.
[01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:02.985]  Well you certainly are and now again I can't follow all the videos and count them up like I can't do my own.
[01:22:03.665 --> 01:22:06.306]  But last time you were on a week ago it was like 50 something million.
[01:22:06.647 --> 01:22:11.408]  I'm just guessing it's 70 million or how many views total did that group of videos or video get?
[01:22:12.309 --> 01:22:13.009]  I don't know yet.
[01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:17.271]  I mean I looked at it was over 68 million that I've that I've looked at.
[01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:18.491]  So my dead reckoning was right?
[01:22:18.611 --> 01:22:19.012]  Right, right.
[01:22:19.132 --> 01:22:24.634]  I mean I've verified that it was over I think around 68 million from I think four or five websites.
[01:22:24.894 --> 01:22:27.235]  But there's definitely more websites that I didn't even
[01:22:27.555 --> 01:22:28.596]  Other people that uploaded it.
[01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:30.297]  It's impossible to track.
[01:22:31.097 --> 01:22:31.937]  And that's what's fun about it.
[01:22:31.957 --> 01:22:38.101]  I'll do some video five years ago that got like 50,000 views and then all of a sudden I'll see it being shared with four million.
[01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:40.542]  It's like it's evergreen.
[01:22:40.562 --> 01:22:42.123]  Mainstream news didn't get big later.
[01:22:42.163 --> 01:22:42.783]  Nobody cares.
[01:22:43.063 --> 01:22:44.764]  But when it's truth, it just goes on and on.
[01:22:45.024 --> 01:22:45.504]  Right, right.
[01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:45.965]  Exactly.
[01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:46.625]  Exactly.
[01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:47.506]  And that's the beauty of it.
[01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:52.128]  That's the beauty of internet, that we can take advantage of it and we can continue to push out true information.
[01:22:52.388 --> 01:22:54.029]  We can tell how we feel and it goes viral.
[01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:59.155]  It was Mark Twain that said, a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth can put its pants on.
[01:22:59.916 --> 01:23:01.497]  But, the truth never dies.
[01:23:02.198 --> 01:23:02.959]  Lies die.
[01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.022]  They may go fast, but they don't last.
[01:23:05.242 --> 01:23:05.882]  Right, exactly.
[01:23:06.283 --> 01:23:07.224]  I agree with that 100%.
[01:23:07.384 --> 01:23:09.667]  And I see that, you see it all the time, even when I watch your show.
[01:23:09.907 --> 01:23:12.710]  I mean, those things are continuously circulating, and I even go back
[01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:13.892]  In time.
[01:23:14.152 --> 01:23:18.036]  I can go back in time and say, you know what, I'm gonna go and search all of the old stuff that I missed.
[01:23:18.176 --> 01:23:25.724]  The things that you were saying and you were talking about and some of the political views that was going on when I wasn't even in the politics or looking at anything.
[01:23:25.764 --> 01:23:26.505]  Wow.
[01:23:26.785 --> 01:23:27.947]  How long ago did you find InfoWars?
[01:23:28.727 --> 01:23:29.427]  About a year ago.
[01:23:30.027 --> 01:23:37.409]  Whenever the campaign season really was getting off and going, I started looking because this was the only place I could find true information.
[01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:40.010]  Infowars tripled in size through the campaign.
[01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.530]  That's the thing.
[01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:41.671]  Trump's not perfect.
[01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:42.491]  Ron Paul's not perfect.
[01:23:42.511 --> 01:23:42.871]  You're not.
[01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:43.251]  I'm not.
[01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:51.133]  But everybody as a movement awakening and coming together and getting politically involved together, we just win by being involved.
[01:23:51.213 --> 01:23:54.074]  Even if we don't win every time, which we've been winning a lot now.
[01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:55.114]  We're almost getting sick of it.
[01:23:55.454 --> 01:23:56.054]  No, I'm joking.
[01:23:56.094 --> 01:23:57.695]  But it's the process.
[01:23:58.095 --> 01:23:58.596]  Right, right.
[01:23:59.036 --> 01:23:59.417]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:59.457 --> 01:24:02.980]  I think that the more we get exposed, the more positive things can happen.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.906]  And I think that, like you said, the tripling and doubling of places like this is giving us the advantage.
[01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:12.471]  And, you know, on the news stations, the mainstream media, they try to make it seem like they're winning.
[01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:13.171]  They're not winning.
[01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:13.692]  We're winning.
[01:24:13.972 --> 01:24:20.139]  You know, this mindset that we have, the people that follow the movement, the people that have common sense and good logic,
[01:24:20.379 --> 01:24:21.520]  I think it's the common sense movement.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.600]  It's not right-wing or left-wing.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.261]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:24.662]  I'm not a politician.
[01:24:25.142 --> 01:24:27.143]  You said you're not right-wing or left-wing, you're just common sense.
[01:24:27.283 --> 01:24:27.464]  Right.
[01:24:27.624 --> 01:24:35.208]  Common sense leads me down this road, and it happened to be closely related to a certain political view, but I don't want to hold to a political view.
[01:24:36.049 --> 01:24:40.133]  I don't want to say that I'm this way or that way, because there's a lot about both sides that I disagree with.
[01:24:40.153 --> 01:24:40.433]  Me too.
[01:24:40.973 --> 01:24:43.936]  And some of these people are hacks.
[01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.297]  They're not even being honest with us.
[01:24:45.537 --> 01:24:50.982]  So what I do is I say, I'm going to come to the conclusion by having common sense, and I don't care what other people tell me.
[01:24:51.202 --> 01:24:51.863]  I don't care what they say.
[01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:56.407]  I'm going to look at a person, evaluate whether they're telling the truth or not.
[01:24:56.507 --> 01:24:57.107]  I go with that.
[01:24:57.428 --> 01:24:59.369]  If they're not telling the truth, I don't care what party they're in.
[01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:00.390]  I don't listen to them.
[01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:02.152]  And that's the way I feel about it.
[01:25:02.692 --> 01:25:04.533]  That's exactly what's happening right now.
[01:25:04.613 --> 01:25:05.753]  We've got Colonel Schaefer coming up.
[01:25:05.793 --> 01:25:06.674]  He'll co-host with us.
[01:25:06.994 --> 01:25:08.915]  But just what is it like being a police officer?
[01:25:08.955 --> 01:25:12.656]  Because I don't want to even get into this because I have family and children.
[01:25:12.677 --> 01:25:17.098]  I don't like to hype it up because it's just something I don't even want to get into.
[01:25:17.138 --> 01:25:22.061]  But now when I go out, the left does yell at me, spit at me, throw coffee at me, try to hit me.
[01:25:22.881 --> 01:25:24.021]  They literally think I'm the devil.
[01:25:24.122 --> 01:25:29.064]  And then now I'm experiencing what police experience from the left, except you're getting shot in the back of the head.
[01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:29.984]  It's happening all the time.
[01:25:30.304 --> 01:25:31.345]  And then CNN goes, well,
[01:25:32.165 --> 01:25:50.841]  Cops better do a better job, that's why you're getting killed in Dallas and in Louisiana, and it's like, physically makes me mad, and it's not even some kinship with the police, and I do care about the police, but it's not some butt-kissing event, it's that understanding that the injustice of you think a cop did something bad to another state, so you go shoot five cops in the back, that is pure evil.
[01:25:51.562 --> 01:25:56.589]  Right it is, and I'm going to say this, I'll give people credit because I don't want to just stay on one side of it.
[01:25:56.749 --> 01:26:01.335]  I think that people have done an excellent job responding to the negative things that have been going on in law enforcement.
[01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:04.500]  Every time I go to like a convenience store, people are like, thank you for your service.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.641]  We love what you do.
[01:26:06.202 --> 01:26:07.464]  I hear more of that.
[01:26:07.984 --> 01:26:09.144]  Then I do of the negative.
[01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.866]  But, the negative is increasing.
[01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:14.446]  Now you go on a call for service and you're trying to help somebody.
[01:26:14.486 --> 01:26:16.927]  Cops are a lot nicer than they were 20 years ago or 10 years ago.
[01:26:17.207 --> 01:26:19.328]  The police, for me, just seem to be getting better and better.
[01:26:19.989 --> 01:26:20.829]  Is that that I'm older?
[01:26:20.869 --> 01:26:21.629]  Is it distorted?
[01:26:22.209 --> 01:26:26.391]  No, I think that they're just hiring... I don't want to say higher quality people.
[01:26:26.411 --> 01:26:27.451]  The expectation is different.
[01:26:27.511 --> 01:26:29.252]  You know, we have to be... Standards are higher.
[01:26:29.332 --> 01:26:30.153]  Yeah, standards are higher.
[01:26:30.193 --> 01:26:31.214]  We have to be counselors.
[01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:32.575]  We have to be able to enforce the law.
[01:26:32.615 --> 01:26:34.016]  We have to be mental health professionals.
[01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:36.418]  We have a whole bunch of different hats that we have to put on.
[01:26:36.638 --> 01:26:37.779]  The demand is greater now.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.361]  And I think that's what they're doing.
[01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:41.022]  And we're getting a lot of exposure.
[01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:43.985]  You know, we are doing more, I think, than we've ever done in history.
[01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:45.346]  So what's happening?
[01:26:45.386 --> 01:26:50.050]  Then why does the left literally hate police and celebrate their random killing?
[01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.971]  I don't know, man.
[01:26:50.991 --> 01:26:56.076]  I think we celebrate, I think the police department is an expression of America and all of core American values.
[01:26:56.416 --> 01:26:59.699]  The expression of... And so their hate of America translates and is projected on.
[01:27:00.039 --> 01:27:00.220]  Right.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:00.940]  And structure.
[01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:02.121]  I think it's structure.
[01:27:02.482 --> 01:27:03.903]  I think people on the left don't want structure.
[01:27:03.923 --> 01:27:05.305]  They want completely free society.
[01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:07.927]  We can do whatever you want that correlates with their safety.
[01:27:07.947 --> 01:27:09.048]  But none of the responsibility.
[01:27:09.348 --> 01:27:09.489]  Right.
[01:27:09.789 --> 01:27:09.949]  Right.
[01:27:10.309 --> 01:27:10.570]  Exactly.
[01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:11.370]  It's like a little kid.
[01:27:11.711 --> 01:27:14.934]  They want to do everything that they want to do, but they don't want the discipline.
[01:27:15.194 --> 01:27:17.556]  But in actuality, the discipline is what's best for them.
[01:27:17.596 --> 01:27:19.357]  You can't just roam free and do whatever you want.
[01:27:19.398 --> 01:27:20.679]  You have to have some kind of laws.
[01:27:21.019 --> 01:27:25.202]  You have to have those things in place to be a... And notice, they don't want any responsibility, but they want to run our lives.
[01:27:25.382 --> 01:27:25.983]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:26.163 --> 01:27:30.867]  Just like a teenager will be telling their parents what to do while they won't even carry the garbage out.
[01:27:31.107 --> 01:27:31.748]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:31.908 --> 01:27:36.192]  They expect the parent to allow them to do everything, but then receive everything.
[01:27:36.672 --> 01:27:42.618]  I was like 17 and a half, just got out of high school, or just turned 18, and I told my dad, I don't like that carpet you just put in.
[01:27:42.638 --> 01:27:44.720]  And my dad said, it's time for you to get the hell out of this house.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.341]  He goes, I'm going to put the carpet in.
[01:27:46.381 --> 01:27:48.683]  And he was always nice, but he said, it's time for you to have your own house.
[01:27:48.703 --> 01:27:49.444]  You go get an apartment.
[01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.545]  I'm going to go help you get one right now.
[01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:50.925]  You're out.
[01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:51.666]  You're out this weekend.
[01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.046]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.447 --> 01:27:54.428]  You're worried about the carpet, but I'm feeding you every day.
[01:27:54.468 --> 01:27:57.631]  So, I mean, obviously, that's... Literally, I said, Dad, I don't like that carpet.
[01:27:57.671 --> 01:27:59.392]  It's, like, got pink on it or something.
[01:27:59.412 --> 01:28:00.232]  Well, your mom likes it.
[01:28:00.533 --> 01:28:01.473]  It's time for you to go.
[01:28:01.594 --> 01:28:02.234]  Yeah.
[01:28:03.015 --> 01:28:03.515]  Interesting.
[01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:06.237]  But because he gets it, like, I didn't have my own life.
[01:28:06.297 --> 01:28:07.098]  I wanted to run his.
[01:28:07.498 --> 01:28:08.199]  Right, exactly.
[01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:24.277]  And I think, to be honest, I think that's how some of the people on the left, I don't want to characterize every single person that leans left, but I'm talking about these people on the far left, they have this child-like mentality where they don't want to be held accountable, they want everything to go their way, and if it contradicts their belief system, it's somehow wrong.
[01:28:26.219 --> 01:28:27.320]  You've just crystallized it.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.121]  Well, the left used to have more reasonable issues.
[01:28:29.341 --> 01:28:30.402]  They've gotten radicalized.
[01:28:30.442 --> 01:28:31.403]  That's why they're so crazy.
[01:28:31.863 --> 01:28:34.185]  There were times when I wasn't Republican or Democrat.
[01:28:34.445 --> 01:28:35.286]  I've seen your videos.
[01:28:35.606 --> 01:28:36.187]  You were the same way.
[01:28:36.207 --> 01:28:38.668]  I mean, I was neutral on McCain and Obama.
[01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:41.311]  And then, because McCain's so bad, too.
[01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:43.733]  We'll be right back with Brandon Tatum.
[01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:45.314]  I'm Alex Jones and Colonel Schaefer.
[01:28:45.594 --> 01:28:46.054]  Stay with us.
[01:28:46.094 --> 01:28:49.437]  This is Key Intel on the latest on Vegas, straight ahead.
[01:28:49.697 --> 01:28:51.138]  They want to hang this around America's neck?
[01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:52.139]  Not so fast.
[01:28:52.199 --> 01:28:52.940]  We know who's behind it.
[01:29:06.368 --> 01:29:07.229]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:09.930]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.

[01:30:14.274 --> 01:30:21.417]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:30:21.857 --> 01:30:31.881]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.

[01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:09.071]  We're good to go!
[01:32:37.233 --> 01:32:37.573]  I think so.
[01:33:15.645 --> 01:33:21.932]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:35.038]  It's shaping up to be a very deliberate act of terror that this is beyond dispute dispute the question becomes motive Everybody seems to be searching searching for a motive Martha.
[01:33:35.118 --> 01:33:46.470]  I would argue most of the clues of the motive is right in front of us first off this individual parallels in many ways by age and pride by predisposition of being unstable the shooter who
[01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:47.191]  I think?
[01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:03.828]  Let's look at the target as well.
[01:34:03.968 --> 01:34:05.569]  It was a politically selected target.
[01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:17.294]  I think the target being selected, and let me say this is the perception based on available information, the perception was there's going to be a lot of pro-gun folks there, Trump supporters at this concert.
[01:34:17.734 --> 01:34:27.778]  So therefore, I believe the perception was by the shooter, by the individual who did this by Paddock, that this was a legitimate target of
[01:34:28.018 --> 01:34:29.239]  of political expression.
[01:34:29.519 --> 01:34:43.385]  Martha, this may be something people don't like to understand, but the very reason that Hodgkinson did what he did, and I believe Paddock did what he did, is because the left has now encouraged the use of violence as an extension and use of political speech.
[01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:45.926]  And this is what we have to be very careful about.
[01:34:46.146 --> 01:34:46.947]  The slippery slope.
[01:34:47.247 --> 01:34:52.189]  The idea here that somehow violence can become part of someone expressing themselves.
[01:34:52.509 --> 01:34:54.150]  And I think that's the real danger here.
[01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:55.511]  Let me set something else out there.
[01:34:55.891 --> 01:35:01.857]  There was no violence perpetrated by, against Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton during the run-ups to this election.
[01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:05.240]  So this has become a feature of desensitization by the left.
[01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:09.124]  The Kathy Griffith beheading, fake beheading the president.
[01:35:09.164 --> 01:35:16.030]  Things like this, I think, are what's pushing a lot of folks to believe now that somehow violence is an acceptable piece of their- Is politically justified.
[01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:17.211]  Is politically justified, exactly.
[01:35:17.231 --> 01:35:17.812]  Well, we will see.
[01:35:17.972 --> 01:35:18.733]  I mean, it's an interesting-
[01:35:19.093 --> 01:35:38.182]  All right, joining us in this segment the next is Lieutenant Tony Schaefer, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer, who I just can't say enough about his bio, the work he did exposing 9-11, able danger, exposing criminal connections to radical Islam, exposing Benghazi, just always a trailblazer, giving us the best intel, LondonCenter.org.
[01:35:38.522 --> 01:35:45.145]  He's also a best-selling author and researcher and works in a lot of different clandestine areas today and advises Congress.
[01:35:45.746 --> 01:35:46.426]  I happen to know the
[01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:48.807]  President and a lot of other folks, but I'm not going to get into it.
[01:35:48.987 --> 01:35:53.488]  One of the most highly respected analysts out there, not just Army, but of course working with the CIA.
[01:35:53.868 --> 01:36:00.870]  Colonel Schaefer, I have Mr. Tatum here with us, Brandon Tatum, the police officer who's put out the viral video exposing the NFL and more.
[01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:02.911]  He's riding shotgun with us, but wow.
[01:36:03.331 --> 01:36:04.452]  That was two days ago.
[01:36:04.632 --> 01:36:05.673]  What do you know now?
[01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:17.444]  Our intel from White House sources is that they know there's an ISIS connection and they have the video of him pledging himself, but they don't want the ISIS cells to be triggered by it or to know what intel we have.
[01:36:17.765 --> 01:36:18.726]  Now, this is out now.
[01:36:18.786 --> 01:36:19.787]  Drudge is linked to our story.
[01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:22.189]  This comes from high-level connections in the White House.
[01:36:22.549 --> 01:36:32.579]  I know you can't get into anything classified, you know, but what is the latest with the Sheriff's Department now saying, indeed they believe he probably was radicalized and there's no way he acted alone, close quote.
[01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:35.662]  What are they signaling to us and what does the target tell us?
[01:36:35.722 --> 01:36:36.503]  Is that not the motive?
[01:36:37.528 --> 01:36:39.630]  Yeah, look, you're spot on Alex.
[01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:43.654]  Let me walk through kind of the piece of logic which I think have brought us to where we're at.
[01:36:44.235 --> 01:36:55.405]  And by the way, you and I spoke about this before, and I think you and I even predicted at some point that you would see emerge a link between ISIS and Antifa, the violent radical left, and I think this is where it's finally coming to.
[01:36:56.966 --> 01:37:03.070]  You know, enemies of a sort will work together for purposes of common interest, and I think that's where this is all going.
[01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:11.456]  So, I think the FBI was completely insane to dismiss, out of hand, within hours of the shooting, quote-unquote, no terror connection.
[01:37:11.496 --> 01:37:14.038]  I think that was just flat-out stupid.
[01:37:14.779 --> 01:37:24.526]  And since then, and I appreciate you playing back the audio, it's like, look, I believe that we are seeing now a merge of concepts.
[01:37:25.166 --> 01:37:25.807]  We're good.
[01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:45.726]  I think.
[01:37:57.321 --> 01:38:09.067]  And by the way, shouldn't we just inject to have the FBI, uncharacteristically, in the morning, when the bodies aren't even cold, say no ISIS connection, when ISIS took credit, and even AP said normally they tell the truth when they take credit.
[01:38:09.307 --> 01:38:12.669]  To have them do that shows me somebody told them, shut up.
[01:38:13.089 --> 01:38:16.071]  And we know Obama has these stay-behind networks in the FBI.
[01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:17.732]  They don't want this to be ISIS.
[01:38:17.972 --> 01:38:19.273]  They wanted this to be Tea Party.
[01:38:19.533 --> 01:38:21.494]  They wanted to put this around Trump's neck.
[01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:22.901]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:22.941 --> 01:38:28.364]  If you look at the messaging on the left, you've seen repeatedly that a white Christian man did this.
[01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:33.606]  It's kind of like, there's no evidence that he's Christian, no evidence of the act alone.
[01:38:33.786 --> 01:38:39.049]  The act is, as a matter of fact, again, we have to look at this at this point as a black hole, as a singularity.
[01:38:40.209 --> 01:38:56.324]  You don't know what's in the middle of that hole, but man, looking at the periphery, looking at the disclosure by the sheriff saying he was radicalized, looking at the fact the sheriff's come out and said there's now a global search, a global investigation going on, the FBI confirming that, and also then the sheriff going on to say that there's no way he could have acted alone.
[01:38:56.884 --> 01:39:01.010]  So, you know, being an intelligence officer, you know, I tend to try to follow the facts.
[01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:04.796]  You know, the law enforcement call them clues, we call them indicators.
[01:39:05.256 --> 01:39:08.280]  And the indicator here in this case is I've been, you know, tracking.
[01:39:09.362 --> 01:39:12.747]  This was a deliberate, well-planned, well-thought,
[01:39:13.928 --> 01:39:23.694]  Multiple facets, probably even had included at some point, had he escaped the room, or someone escaped the room with him, to employ an explosive device.
[01:39:24.334 --> 01:39:29.818]  Explosives similar to the explosives that were linked to the bombing a few weeks ago, a few months ago in New York City.
[01:39:30.738 --> 01:39:36.362]  So, you know, a pattern is emerging, Alex, and this is a factual pattern.
[01:39:36.422 --> 01:39:42.186]  This is not somehow an overreach by those of us who follow this as part of our professional work.
[01:39:42.846 --> 01:39:45.368]  And I think the American public needs to take two things from this.
[01:39:45.449 --> 01:39:55.817]  First, I'd be completely alarmed by the fact that we have not seen the end of people within the administration playing games behind the scenes, to your point.
[01:39:56.258 --> 01:40:03.944]  I think there's a lot of Obama stay-behinds still in positions of political influence who are essentially not telling the American people the truth.
[01:40:05.151 --> 01:40:16.354]  As long as those people are inside of government, you have the potential for continuation of really not only bad policies, but bad things like this being almost encouraged to happen.
[01:40:16.374 --> 01:40:18.634]  And I would argue that there are direct links.
[01:40:18.674 --> 01:40:21.275]  I was talking to a lawyer today who was involved in this sort of thing.
[01:40:21.775 --> 01:40:30.257]  I would argue there's direct links between the Democrat Party, the Obama folks, the Clinton folks, and the folks still in government.
[01:40:30.677 --> 01:40:34.678]  There's no reason to believe, Alex, that they're not communicating on a daily basis, trying to work.
[01:40:35.158 --> 01:40:42.565]  And we have top psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Weiner, and we've got a lot of other psychiatrists coming out.
[01:40:52.259 --> 01:41:03.305]  Wellner and others saying that clearly it's just like the Scalise attack, which researchers now believe was a coordinated, probably funded attack, trying to kill 15 members of Congress to force a special election.
[01:41:03.645 --> 01:41:05.866]  We know there's a behind-the-scenes investigation there.
[01:41:06.246 --> 01:41:08.867]  And I understand they come to Trump and they say, we're trying to catch the bad guys.
[01:41:08.907 --> 01:41:11.289]  We don't want to know what avenues we're going down.
[01:41:11.329 --> 01:41:15.991]  But clearly ISIS, Antifa, their merger, they said this big October 1st attack.
[01:41:16.351 --> 01:41:16.631]  Let's go.
[01:41:26.348 --> 01:41:51.277]  I mean, I know they came to the President and said, sir, it's too soon to put out any info, but now we know the White House has been briefed that indeed this guy is ISIS, and now it's being reported by major New York papers and the Las Vegas Review-Journal that explosive possessed by Steven Paddock may have been used in New York City bombing, and these ISIS networks that he was in to sell them weapons, which is where he got the money to then be able to gamble millions of dollars a year.
[01:41:51.317 --> 01:41:53.618]  I mean, this is really looking like Fast and Furious Part 2.
[01:41:54.918 --> 01:41:55.999]  Well, I don't know all those facts.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:59.344]  I mean, some of those things, you know, my sources have not gone that far.
[01:41:59.444 --> 01:42:07.374]  I do, I have been told, obviously there's reasons they're not telling the entire story, and I alluded to that both last night on the air on Fox and with you now.
[01:42:07.434 --> 01:42:09.917]  It's like, look, there are certain things that I know for a fact.
[01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.680]  Look, I support certain things being held back.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:12.340]  I think so.
[01:42:34.043 --> 01:42:42.670]  And you need to have investigators who are willing to not only follow where the facts lead, they need to actually think about what it means.
[01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:45.072]  Tony Schafer, stay there.
[01:42:45.112 --> 01:42:47.534]  I want to get big picture with you straight ahead.
[01:42:47.574 --> 01:42:49.836]  And we have Brandon Tatum, a police officer, here with us.
[01:42:49.856 --> 01:42:50.777]  We'll get his take as well.
[01:42:50.997 --> 01:42:51.838]  Thank you, Colonel Schafer.
[01:42:51.878 --> 01:42:52.458]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:52.518 --> 01:42:53.099]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.201]  Let's talk to Danny.
[01:45:07.221 --> 01:45:08.082]  Let's talk to Dr. Group.
[01:45:08.102 --> 01:45:08.783]  You're on the air, Danny.
[01:45:09.184 --> 01:45:09.424]  Hi.
[01:45:09.504 --> 01:45:14.490]  The nascent iodine, the B12, and the super male are incredible products.
[01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.831]  Thank you.
[01:45:14.851 --> 01:45:23.822]  I would like to ask Dr. Group, are there any supplements or products that help promote the growth of stem cells, and would you consider making one, if there is?
[01:45:23.922 --> 01:45:36.985]  Well, the DNA force is probably the biggest product that's designed to do that, but the fastest way to stimulate stem cells, and this was a study by USC, we were talking about it earlier, is water-only fasting.
[01:45:37.045 --> 01:45:46.328]  I haven't found anything in my over 20 years of research that can actually stimulate stem cell production as fast as water-only fasting can do it.
[01:45:46.728 --> 01:45:50.909]  And according to USC, in 72 hours you can regenerate your entire immune system.
[01:45:51.569 --> 01:45:53.370]  And it reboots itself.
[01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:55.531]  So, I mean, think about that.
[01:45:56.292 --> 01:46:07.758]  You can go overseas to Thailand and get a $120,000 stem cell treatment, or maybe a $50,000 stem cell treatment, or you can do it for $1.99 a day with spring water or distilled water.
[01:46:07.858 --> 01:46:08.539]  Let me be clear.
[01:46:08.659 --> 01:46:15.823]  There's hundreds and hundreds of studies just on BioPQQ alone that's in DNA Force that we're allowed to talk about because it's so powerful.
[01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:21.285]  It regenerates nerves in some cases, so an area that was dead, like your knee, your back, it may come back.
[01:46:21.325 --> 01:46:22.185]  It may hurt worse for a while.
[01:46:22.485 --> 01:46:25.726]  I had a finger that was chopped off and was still numb up on the front.
[01:46:26.066 --> 01:46:27.447]  I took DNA for a few months.
[01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:28.727]  It came back, sort of tingling.
[01:46:29.067 --> 01:46:30.068]  The feeling is back.
[01:46:30.228 --> 01:46:31.908]  So it doesn't grow telomeres.
[01:46:31.968 --> 01:46:33.529]  It keeps them from shrinking as fast, correct?
[01:46:33.809 --> 01:46:44.259]  Yes, and I mean the cleaner your body is, and the more you detoxify, and the healthier you become on a daily basis, the better your body is at producing stem cells.
[01:46:44.319 --> 01:46:46.561]  Danny, you've got to try DNA Force for yourself.
[01:46:46.621 --> 01:46:48.843]  As Dr. Group said, the fasting is amazing.
[01:46:48.883 --> 01:46:51.826]  Each person is different, so consult your physician or do your own research.
[01:46:51.886 --> 01:46:53.748]  But we're running the biggest specials.
[01:46:53.788 --> 01:46:58.232]  We run in like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:08.166 --> 01:47:10.507]  Operation Dark Hearts is one of his best-selling books.
[01:47:10.527 --> 01:47:12.469]  He's Colonel Schaeffer joining us live.
[01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.949]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:15.150]  It's a global transmission.
[01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:16.631]  And you are the resistance.
[01:47:23.075 --> 01:47:26.977]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:28.578 --> 01:47:33.281]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.738 --> 01:47:39.420]  Brandon Tatum's riding a shotgun with me, summoned to the next hour.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.981]  He's just here right now, just like I am.
[01:47:41.001 --> 01:47:41.882]  Listen to Colonel Schaefer.
[01:47:42.142 --> 01:47:43.183]  Jump at any time, my friend.
[01:47:43.903 --> 01:47:45.444]  Colonel Schaefer, we're talking a lot during the break.
[01:47:45.464 --> 01:47:46.865]  Some of it we can't get into, obviously, on air.
[01:47:46.925 --> 01:48:01.136]  But just in the nine, ten minutes we have left, give us your data dump, the dates, the left calling for revolution, all these ISIS connections being covered up, minute one, the Sheriff's Department basically sending out signals that we're on target.
[01:48:01.416 --> 01:48:05.519]  What do you make of this threat assessment and the future battle window?
[01:48:06.348 --> 01:48:24.344]  Yeah, so going back to the long-term history of what we've seen in the past, kind of looking at the past as prologue, look, we've seen ISIS continuing to desire, and it's been aspirational, but you know, as we talked about two years ago, that they were going to do this, they were going to, while it was aspirational then,
[01:48:25.044 --> 01:48:27.685]  ISIS is one of the network they could cooperate with.
[01:48:27.765 --> 01:48:37.108]  So, you know, we've seen... They said, we want liberals, we want white people that don't look Arabic that we can use to correct the attacks.
[01:48:37.668 --> 01:48:38.329]  Right.
[01:48:38.509 --> 01:48:39.469]  So we've seen parallels here.
[01:48:39.489 --> 01:48:44.431]  I mean, look, we've seen the Muslim Brotherhood penetrating serially our media.
[01:48:45.111 --> 01:48:51.753]  They've been working to penetrate basically criminal organizations for purposes of exploitation and access.
[01:48:51.793 --> 01:48:54.154]  So we've seen that over there with the Brotherhood.
[01:48:54.514 --> 01:48:59.578]  So, you know, ISIS is going, you know, taking a page out of their playbook doing the same thing.
[01:48:59.618 --> 01:49:01.460]  So we have to be very vigilant.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:05.963]  I think this is what we are seeing now, is this kind of merging.
[01:49:06.463 --> 01:49:14.570]  You know, we've seen organizations like Hamas partner with other organizations to do terror attacks, even if they don't necessarily agree on every fact.
[01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:16.491]  So this is what I think we're seeing here.
[01:49:16.551 --> 01:49:18.773]  We have to be very clear, very steely-eyed.
[01:49:19.193 --> 01:49:21.836]  And again, let's just follow the facts.
[01:49:22.276 --> 01:49:23.117]  The second point is,
[01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:35.764]  It's not, you know, as much as I'm hearing and you're hearing the same thing, a lot of the background motivation by Attic, by the reason he did it, is going to make people very uncomfortable.
[01:49:36.225 --> 01:49:37.906]  But you got to get it out there.
[01:49:37.946 --> 01:49:40.227]  You got to tell the American people the truth.
[01:49:40.247 --> 01:49:44.510]  You got to be straight with them, because they kind of already know why they're dragging their feet.
[01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:47.512]  And again, going to the point of
[01:49:48.794 --> 01:49:54.006]  The attack of Congressman Solis against him by Hodgkinson.
[01:49:54.978 --> 01:50:01.403]  Does parallel what the left has been pushing for from day one for the president's victory.
[01:50:01.463 --> 01:50:12.191]  The idea that they will use Antifa, they will use violence as a method of not only resistance, but then also creating a path back to some level of power.
[01:50:12.932 --> 01:50:15.654]  And so this is what they're laying out.
[01:50:15.714 --> 01:50:16.895]  This is what they're trying to do.
[01:50:17.335 --> 01:50:23.400]  So again, I don't want people to think somehow this is not substantiated by the facts.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.762]  Unfortunately Alex, as you know, over the years we've talked, I don't let go with what the facts show.
[01:50:28.902 --> 01:50:43.489]  I don't, I try to... Well sure, they're gonna attack you because before the bodies were culled, they said no ISIS, when ISIS, there were terror attacks all over the world that day by ISIS, and they weren't even taking credit for those, because those were lone wolves, they weren't even sure were their people.
[01:50:43.829 --> 01:50:45.110]  They were very proud of this guy.
[01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:46.610]  They were very proud of their execution.
[01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:48.131]  They had their literature ready.
[01:50:48.711 --> 01:51:06.738]  They said we have him months ago swearing allegiance, and now I've got it from White House sources that they're sitting on top, because much of ISIS is their own internal stuff, as many have said, streaming back to the ISIS folks, coordinating this, and he obviously had help, and it looks like he may have been the cutout.
[01:51:06.898 --> 01:51:08.558]  Have you gotten any intel along those lines?
[01:51:09.158 --> 01:51:12.360]  Well, look, that's one of the rumors I've heard that's a very strong possibility.
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:16.161]  You know, look, you and I both know, and the sheriff even said this.
[01:51:17.281 --> 01:51:19.403]  You know, this guy was videotaping everything.
[01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:20.243]  He had all these cameras.
[01:51:20.283 --> 01:51:21.384]  Do you really believe?
[01:51:21.684 --> 01:51:25.987]  Do you really believe he didn't have them turned on and using them for the purpose they were designed?
[01:51:26.007 --> 01:51:27.288]  This guy was very meticulous.
[01:51:27.728 --> 01:51:29.530]  This guy was hyper-meticulous.
[01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:31.651]  He worked for the IRS, which is a clue.
[01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:32.752]  He was an accountant.
[01:51:33.072 --> 01:51:34.653]  He's done all these different things.
[01:51:34.673 --> 01:51:35.273]  He drank Pepsi.
[01:51:36.034 --> 01:51:36.254]  Right.
[01:51:36.754 --> 01:51:41.117]  And so, liberals, I mean, literally, conservatives do not drink, especially in the Obama era.
[01:51:41.698 --> 01:51:43.079]  Conservatives drink Coca-Cola.
[01:51:43.099 --> 01:51:44.760]  If you drink soft drinks, liberals drink Pepsi.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.281]  And that's a big clue.
[01:51:46.961 --> 01:51:47.682]  That's a good clue.
[01:51:48.122 --> 01:51:52.126]  But my point being, Alex, is that this guy followed a certain pattern.
[01:51:52.487 --> 01:51:54.428]  He developed himself in a certain way.
[01:51:54.548 --> 01:51:56.891]  He had a modality of operation that's very detailed.
[01:51:57.731 --> 01:52:02.336]  What do you make of the big defense contractor he worked with?
[01:52:02.356 --> 01:52:09.503]  I mean, the whole thing, and the planes, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent per gambling trip, and he was a smart investor.
[01:52:09.783 --> 01:52:10.824]  Sounds like money laundering.
[01:52:11.727 --> 01:52:12.548]  Well, it's very possible.
[01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:13.309]  I mean, again, we don't know.
[01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:15.192]  But I will say this about him.
[01:52:16.013 --> 01:52:21.701]  He was brilliant in the fact that he was able to establish that money, those resources.
[01:52:22.442 --> 01:52:24.905]  I think he was just like Hodgkinson, except he was smarter.
[01:52:25.025 --> 01:52:26.768]  He actually had a better understanding of how to
[01:52:27.028 --> 01:52:28.169]  And that's my next question.
[01:52:28.989 --> 01:52:33.851]  It's later admitted that Hodgkin wanted to go in and have a special election, kill as many Republicans as possible.
[01:52:34.151 --> 01:52:36.232]  The Democrats are saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:52:36.673 --> 01:52:37.953]  They're hashtag hunt cops.
[01:52:38.533 --> 01:52:41.815]  CNN, when more cops get killed, go, well, you know, cops are bad.
[01:52:41.835 --> 01:52:45.717]  You need to reform yourselves, like, because some cop might have done something wrong five states away.
[01:52:46.577 --> 01:52:47.718]  Then you deserve to die.
[01:52:47.838 --> 01:52:49.058]  Turns out the cop didn't do something.
[01:52:49.379 --> 01:52:50.479]  I mean, this is craziness.
[01:52:50.579 --> 01:52:53.881]  Why is the left betting on this giant revolutionary
[01:52:54.958 --> 01:52:59.739]  Fervor, and saying starting October 1st, we're going to launch building up to November 4th.
[01:52:59.799 --> 01:53:04.381]  I mean, they're the ones saying it, and then none of the media is even focusing in on that.
[01:53:04.661 --> 01:53:14.964]  If you look at all this, are they just attempting, like many intel people I've talked to, to just hype things up and hope some other crazy person picks up on it so they can have clean hands?
[01:53:15.808 --> 01:53:21.971]  I think there's always an inevitability and encouragement of a kind of a parallel event, no doubt.
[01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:24.332]  And let's look at what they focused on, Alex.
[01:53:24.372 --> 01:53:28.133]  The first thing that was leaked off the crime scene was pictures of the guns.
[01:53:28.173 --> 01:53:29.114]  Oh, the guns are bad!
[01:53:29.214 --> 01:53:29.934]  Oh, you know.
[01:53:30.554 --> 01:53:34.776]  And I've seen, again, them ignoring the facts that you and I have just talked about.
[01:53:34.936 --> 01:53:44.120]  All the things which have been said in press conferences, through official sources, completely and summarily being ignored by every media outlet except for Fox.
[01:53:45.001 --> 01:53:50.527]  And to that point, the narrative they're trying to put forth is it's all about the guns.
[01:53:50.567 --> 01:53:51.267]  Guns are bad.
[01:53:51.307 --> 01:53:52.529]  People who have guns are bad.
[01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:55.212]  And think about the irony of this.
[01:53:55.332 --> 01:53:58.095]  Of course, at the same time, they're saying you can't trust the police.
[01:53:58.696 --> 01:54:00.718]  Don't trust the police, but we don't want you to be armed either.
[01:54:01.178 --> 01:54:04.362]  So there's really no cohesion to their argument.
[01:54:04.822 --> 01:54:11.809]  It's all about trying to upend via this feeling, via this fervor.
[01:54:11.869 --> 01:54:19.257]  They want to get people into a basically a fervor, an emotional fervor saying, oh my God, we have to do something.
[01:54:19.297 --> 01:54:20.158]  It's all about emotion.
[01:54:20.278 --> 01:54:20.798]  Exactly.
[01:54:20.858 --> 01:54:24.262]  It's like blow it all up, even though they don't have a blueprint for what they're going to build new.
[01:54:25.221 --> 01:54:25.642]  Exactly.
[01:54:25.662 --> 01:54:28.605]  So I think that the answer is that they don't have a plan.
[01:54:29.005 --> 01:54:29.946]  They lost access.
[01:54:30.227 --> 01:54:33.550]  Hillary's loss has completely left them, I think, adrift.
[01:54:34.071 --> 01:54:35.332]  So turn the chessboard over.
[01:54:35.372 --> 01:54:37.314]  Basically, we're looking for strategy.
[01:54:37.555 --> 01:54:38.656]  We're seeing a temper tantrum.
[01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:40.202]  Yeah.
[01:54:40.262 --> 01:54:56.652]  In official, all aspects, all levels, temper tantrum that is informed by hate, it is fueled by radicalization, and frankly, as I said on the tape you ran, this is becoming an accepted form of political speech on their side.
[01:54:56.712 --> 01:54:57.613]  It's just what it is.
[01:54:57.873 --> 01:55:01.736]  Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer, LondonCenter.org, best-selling author.
[01:55:02.016 --> 01:55:03.037]  Follow him on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:55:03.057 --> 01:55:08.921]  Brandon Tatum, police officer, patriot, very popular talk show host in his own right.
[01:55:08.941 --> 01:55:11.963]  Sitting here listening to Colonel Schaefer, I see you nodding your head.
[01:55:12.263 --> 01:55:13.905]  What's your comment or statement or question?
[01:55:14.744 --> 01:55:22.228]  Well, I think that it's, you know, if anyone was to have in their mind that this is not some type of assisted calculated thing, they have to be foolish.
[01:55:22.688 --> 01:55:25.770]  Because in law enforcement, just looking at the operation... Super sophisticated!
[01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:26.290]  Right, right.
[01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:33.094]  I mean, there's no way that an older gentleman with supposedly no tactical experience can pull this type of stuff off.
[01:55:33.394 --> 01:55:37.036]  If I brought 20 bags up to any hotel, they'd come see what I was doing.
[01:55:37.376 --> 01:55:37.597]  Right.
[01:55:37.717 --> 01:55:41.359]  I mean, how did he, you know, how can he physically get all of these guns up there?
[01:55:41.379 --> 01:55:42.720]  How could he physically carry all that?
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.921]  I can barely get my wife and all my kids in a hotel.
[01:55:45.621 --> 01:55:51.545]  This is so, so, and I'm the same way, you know, but, you know, I think that you have to look at, be logical about it.
[01:55:51.765 --> 01:55:52.766]  Have some common sense.
[01:55:53.166 --> 01:55:58.209]  You pull up with a bunch of Pelican cases, and the bellhops aren't going to be looking at this?
[01:56:00.138 --> 01:56:06.788]  Unless you put something in it and muffle the shells, I mean, you're gonna hear, you know, guns, I mean, bullets rattling and going up staircases.
[01:56:06.928 --> 01:56:08.090]  What about that, Colonel Schaefer?
[01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:11.415]  Just the whole getting it into the building and... Oh my goodness, yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[01:56:11.475 --> 01:56:14.679]  I mean, first off, I'm appalled that we've seen zero.
[01:56:15.658 --> 01:56:16.539]  We're good to go.
[01:56:37.498 --> 01:56:47.485]  For him both to move the equipment, and then during the shooting itself, for him to move past, just look at the diagrams, Alex, of the room, and those two windows.
[01:56:47.825 --> 01:56:58.992]  To physically move between those points at the same time, reloading, moving weapons around, for him to do that by himself is physically probably pretty darn impossible.
[01:56:59.392 --> 01:57:02.974]  Even some fit person would have a hard time going back and forth doing that.
[01:57:03.314 --> 01:57:05.396]  So again, I agree, common sense.
[01:57:06.116 --> 01:57:07.437]  Just think for yourself.
[01:57:08.237 --> 01:57:09.418]  You've got to look at the facts.
[01:57:09.458 --> 01:57:10.639]  You've got to look at the reality.
[01:57:10.659 --> 01:57:11.739]  You've got to look at the physics.
[01:57:12.079 --> 01:57:12.460]  That's right.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.760]  Londoncenter.org.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.101]  We've got a 70-second break.
[01:57:15.121 --> 01:57:17.683]  I've got a short little five-minute segment if Colonel Schaefer can do it.
[01:57:17.963 --> 01:57:25.027]  I want to specifically ask him separately about the NFL protests, the stuff we saw with Puerto Rico, just all the hoaxes.
[01:57:25.067 --> 01:57:25.727]  I've got to jump off.
[01:57:25.747 --> 01:57:26.287]  You've got to jump.
[01:57:26.367 --> 01:57:27.168]  Okay.
[01:57:27.188 --> 01:57:28.649]  Well, please come back soon with us then.
[01:57:28.689 --> 01:57:28.929]  I will.
[01:57:29.569 --> 01:57:30.130]  Hey, thanks.
[01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:30.431]  Take care.
[01:58:01.499 --> 01:58:01.985]  Just briefly.
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:05.241]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:58:05.261 --> 01:58:06.182]  He's about to retire.
[01:58:06.762 --> 01:58:13.227]  About 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:58:13.287 --> 01:58:16.249]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:17.270]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:18.871]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:58:19.411 --> 01:58:21.893]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[01:58:21.913 --> 01:58:22.693]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:58:23.113 --> 01:58:25.095]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:58:25.135 --> 01:58:31.019]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:58:31.619 --> 01:58:32.100]  Exactly.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:38.148]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:58:38.188 --> 01:58:41.993]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[01:58:43.355 --> 01:58:46.879]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:58:47.858 --> 01:58:48.278]  I don't
[01:59:04.639 --> 01:59:08.221]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:59:08.661 --> 01:59:09.881]  Why does it say nursery water?
[01:59:09.901 --> 01:59:11.122]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[01:59:11.182 --> 01:59:14.083]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:59:14.123 --> 01:59:16.104]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:59:16.284 --> 01:59:26.049]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[01:59:26.609 --> 01:59:27.849]  But you die without iodine.
[01:59:27.869 --> 01:59:29.410]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:31.211]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:59:31.251 --> 01:59:32.171]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:59:32.191 --> 01:59:33.592]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:59:34.032 --> 01:59:42.336]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:59:42.937 --> 01:59:46.298]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:56.803 --> 02:00:00.705]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.241 --> 02:00:09.103]  Here we are, Tuesday, November 21st, 2017.
[02:00:09.163 --> 02:00:17.185]  This year's come and almost gone like a whirlwind.
[02:00:18.926 --> 02:00:29.709]  It's been a little over a year since President Trump became president-elect, since we defeated the fake media, the controlled corporate press, since we began the process of restoring our republic.
[02:00:31.124 --> 02:00:36.006]  Because we began to rekindle our spirits again and not let the globalists break our will.
[02:00:37.427 --> 02:00:39.368]  But make no mistake, this is metaphysical.
[02:00:39.788 --> 02:00:40.549]  This is spiritual.
[02:00:41.809 --> 02:00:52.735]  The globalists are social engineers who lust after dominating and controlling people and breaking their will, breaking their cultures, and turning them into zombies.
[02:00:54.056 --> 02:00:56.497]  It is very exhilarating and very exciting
[02:00:58.359 --> 02:01:15.947]  But also paradoxical that when I see listeners of my television show, my radio show, the simulcast, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, they have light in their eyes, they're excited, they're involved, they are alive.
[02:01:17.068 --> 02:01:27.273]  And then when I see people that either aren't politically awake or aware or are political enemies, you cannot overestimate how slob-like, zombie-like,
[02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:29.742]  And enslaved they are.
[02:01:31.082 --> 02:01:42.608]  It truly is sad to see the majority of people under globalist control being shiftless, hateful, vicious, desperate, lost individuals.
[02:01:43.148 --> 02:01:58.176]  Now there's a small percentage of those that serve globalism that are totally conscious of it and are just very mercenary when it comes to following the central engineer's blueprint.
[02:01:59.685 --> 02:02:09.972]  That said, though, I don't get out in public a ton, but I recently, a few days ago, took my mother-in-law and my family to the shopping mall.
[02:02:10.012 --> 02:02:10.692]  It was a nice day.
[02:02:10.712 --> 02:02:15.556]  It was an open-air mall called The Domain here in Austin, Texas.
[02:02:15.576 --> 02:02:16.676]  We went to three stores.
[02:02:16.836 --> 02:02:17.957]  We were only there about an hour and a half.
[02:02:19.558 --> 02:02:21.179]  I guess one restaurant, so four places.
[02:02:21.479 --> 02:02:26.383]  So I guess counting the restaurant about, I don't know, three and a half hours.
[02:02:27.245 --> 02:02:29.906]  And I ran into so many listeners and so many fans.
[02:02:30.066 --> 02:02:33.668]  It was very, very humbling because they had so much electricity in their eyes.
[02:02:34.689 --> 02:02:45.094]  And in one of the shops I went in, both the women that owned the shop were fans and listeners, but they were taking action.
[02:02:45.494 --> 02:02:48.056]  They'd been visiting family and friends out in Oregon.
[02:02:49.508 --> 02:02:52.289]  During the election last year, they plastered the town.
[02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:54.610]  They said they had a few drinks to make it even more fun.
[02:02:55.171 --> 02:03:01.674]  Plastered the town at night with over 500 Hillary for Prison stickers that also have Infoworks.com on them.
[02:03:02.114 --> 02:03:03.474]  I thought, well that's amazing, thank you.
[02:03:04.095 --> 02:03:14.700]  So I bought a jacket vest that I was in there getting, and I went on down the street and ran into a really nice Hispanic couple who
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.541]  Also told me about how they put InfoWare stickers up in Austin.
[02:03:19.001 --> 02:03:19.801]  How much fun they had.
[02:03:20.201 --> 02:03:21.842]  Then I ran into another Hispanic couple.
[02:03:22.822 --> 02:03:28.204]  This guy's made an amazing app called the InfoWare that I just discovered again a few days ago.
[02:03:28.824 --> 02:03:29.444]  That's amazing.
[02:03:30.404 --> 02:03:31.945]  I might be working with him on some stuff.
[02:03:32.005 --> 02:03:42.268]  It was just it was just crazy how many of the people were so optimistic but were also taking action and knew that they were part of something historical.
[02:03:43.163 --> 02:03:44.163]  And look, Trump's not perfect.
[02:03:44.203 --> 02:03:44.723]  I'm not perfect.
[02:03:44.743 --> 02:03:45.284]  You're not perfect.
[02:03:45.304 --> 02:03:47.624]  But we've turned the corner on globalism.
[02:03:47.844 --> 02:03:51.545]  You know the New World Order's upset by the way they're behaving.
[02:03:51.926 --> 02:03:53.146]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[02:03:53.186 --> 02:03:54.506]  So it's Thanksgiving approaches.
[02:03:54.886 --> 02:03:56.507]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you out there.
[02:03:56.527 --> 02:03:59.968]  And I'm very, very thankful for all of our affiliates and our sponsors, everybody else.
[02:04:00.988 --> 02:04:12.934]  And just in closing here before we come back with the broadcast, I just wanted to say that we have Black Friday, Cyber Monday specials that are extended right into next week.
[02:04:13.354 --> 02:04:17.816]  But a lot of these sales are only one day only because we have limited supplies or while supplies last.
[02:04:18.236 --> 02:04:25.840]  So all the specials of yesterday, Brain Force 50% off and 25% off Pro Pure super high quality water filters, that is extending today.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:26.600]  I think so.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:48.743]  The Melatonin you name it that's knockout available.
[02:04:48.763 --> 02:04:52.106]  So there's just some of the specials Free shipping storewide.
[02:04:52.126 --> 02:04:54.789]  We've decided to extend but we're gonna have to end that soon.
[02:04:54.849 --> 02:05:00.294]  Obviously info war store.com Info wars life.com will be right back on the other side.
[02:05:00.314 --> 02:05:03.217]  But again, thank you all for being part of history Thanks for changing the world
[02:05:07.619 --> 02:05:08.359]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[02:05:08.739 --> 02:05:11.080]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:14.122]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[02:05:14.382 --> 02:05:20.184]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support, and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:20.484 --> 02:05:26.967]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide, and clearly, the biggest sales in our history.
[02:05:27.147 --> 02:05:29.248]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[02:05:29.468 --> 02:05:33.009]  We've got our new tropic, RainForce, 50% off.
[02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:35.170]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:35.670]  We're good.
[02:06:19.961 --> 02:06:23.903]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:24.963 --> 02:06:29.566]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.066 --> 02:06:32.867]  Robert Kiyosaki's coming up.
[02:06:32.967 --> 02:06:42.572]  Then we have the former Trump administration official, campaign official, who's given us good leaks before, getting into the fact that why they're sitting on top of the fact this guy had al-Qaeda.
[02:06:42.892 --> 02:06:44.293]  He did have al-Qaeda videos.
[02:06:45.487 --> 02:06:52.709]  I have other sources that I obviously can't get into details of with even more proof, but I can't give the information out at this time.
[02:06:54.369 --> 02:06:57.110]  But, that is the information coming out.
[02:06:57.750 --> 02:07:09.774]  So, Brandon Tatum, let me give out your information here, police officer, there in Southern Arizona, at the officer Tatum, Facebook.com forward slash Tatumbug34, YouTube.com, BTCruiser34.
[02:07:12.697 --> 02:07:20.764]  If you just joined us, you've had a lot to say about the NFL, the Vegas attack, you've had everything you say has been viral because folks really resonate with it.
[02:07:21.144 --> 02:07:22.365]  You've got the floor in this segment.
[02:07:22.385 --> 02:07:24.427]  You've been patiently sitting there while I had Colonel Schaefer on.
[02:07:24.947 --> 02:07:26.048]  Kind of repeat what you've been saying.
[02:07:26.088 --> 02:07:32.073]  You've been on fire during the breaks about what's really going on, why the police can't say what's going on at this point, and where you see this all going.
[02:07:32.093 --> 02:07:36.477]  And then into the gun control issues, the actual statistics of why this is a tragedy
[02:07:36.817 --> 02:07:41.681]  But to say it's the biggest thing in the world and then try to blame gun owners and say, ban the NRA.
[02:07:41.701 --> 02:07:42.862]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:07:42.922 --> 02:07:44.143]  They're the conspiracy theorists.
[02:07:44.344 --> 02:07:46.345]  They're covering up it's probably an Islamic attack.
[02:07:46.966 --> 02:07:49.068]  And then they're blaming it on us at the same time.
[02:07:50.034 --> 02:07:50.574]  Right, right, right.
[02:07:50.694 --> 02:07:57.899]  And when it comes to law enforcement, like, there's certain things that we can and cannot do, we will not do, to preserve our own tactical advantage.
[02:07:58.219 --> 02:08:04.162]  So, we may have information about certain things, we will never disclose those things because we have to have the advantage.
[02:08:04.503 --> 02:08:11.066]  Listen, when things happen, the citizens aren't the ones that have to do the takedowns, the citizens aren't the ones that got to get the search warrants and things like that.
[02:08:11.126 --> 02:08:18.551]  So, we have an advantage by having the upper hand, having information that nobody knows about, understanding how to do counter
[02:08:19.011 --> 02:08:21.593]  You know, I just get counter tactics on different things.
[02:08:21.653 --> 02:08:23.655]  So this is an advantage for law enforcement.
[02:08:23.715 --> 02:08:26.537]  So I'm not surprised that they're not disclosing everything.
[02:08:26.577 --> 02:08:35.144]  And I think that they're doing a good job at attempting to allude to certain things about radicalization and, you know, the fact that they believe that he's not acting alone.
[02:08:35.464 --> 02:08:45.232]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this person has so many guns, so many different tactical advantages that he could not have done it himself with his level of experience.
[02:08:45.933 --> 02:08:54.487]  So I think that's that's pretty much you know my take on a law enforcement perspective and as far as the the gun control this is the most
[02:08:55.896 --> 02:09:07.779]  The most ignorant, unreasonable thing I've heard coming out of the mouth of Democrats and the left is, I don't understand at what point do they make to try to ban guns or try to have some level of gun control.
[02:09:08.079 --> 02:09:10.660]  This person purchased firearms legally.
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:18.142]  So the laws that we have in place are almost some of the most strictest laws, and this guy was still able to take advantage of it.
[02:09:18.302 --> 02:09:22.463]  Barack Obama's administration pushed the bump stock.
[02:09:23.243 --> 02:09:25.344]  Um, a mechanism that they put on a rifle.
[02:09:25.644 --> 02:09:27.685]  I've never even heard of a crime being committed with that.
[02:09:28.025 --> 02:09:29.805]  And now suddenly it is, but I've talked to experts.
[02:09:29.825 --> 02:09:31.506]  They say, that's not a bump stop.
[02:09:31.546 --> 02:09:33.107]  That's clear chain fed.
[02:09:35.867 --> 02:09:38.568]  I'm not an expert on firearms, but I've had the experts on.
[02:09:38.829 --> 02:09:41.509]  It sound like it was possibly chain fed.
[02:09:41.610 --> 02:09:42.430]  I couldn't imagine.
[02:09:42.510 --> 02:09:44.531]  I mean, I had the former leader of SEAL Team Six on.
[02:09:44.751 --> 02:09:44.891]  Right.
[02:09:44.971 --> 02:09:46.491]  And he didn't let me say that, but it's true.
[02:09:46.551 --> 02:09:47.612]  And they go, look, it's belt.
[02:09:47.652 --> 02:09:48.392]  They even know the gun.
[02:09:48.863 --> 02:09:49.243]  Right, right.
[02:10:07.492 --> 02:10:07.952]  Right, right.
[02:10:08.012 --> 02:10:15.554]  And I can see why, if that was discovered, why they don't want to let the public know that this person has access to this and some certain different things.
[02:10:15.794 --> 02:10:17.174]  They don't want people to go crazy.
[02:10:17.454 --> 02:10:23.256]  Because what's going to happen if you give them information without giving them everything, without them understanding the totality of it?
[02:10:23.316 --> 02:10:28.957]  You can cause people to freak out and then they make, you know, false claims and do other stuff that's unreasonable and it's not helpful.
[02:10:30.384 --> 02:10:30.804]  That's right.
[02:10:31.185 --> 02:10:42.916]  By the way, this broke about an hour ago on InfoWars.com, another Paul Watson article, by the great investigative journalist Laura Loomer, who helped approve the receipts and the fact that he checked in days earlier, are moles inside.
[02:10:44.515 --> 02:10:45.896]  Uh, gave this to police on Monday.
[02:10:45.956 --> 02:10:47.358]  Nothing was done, so they've given it to us.
[02:10:47.918 --> 02:10:52.562]  Valet entries prove Paddock checked in three days before date given by authorities.
[02:10:52.582 --> 02:10:54.864]  The gunman was in the hotel on September 25th.
[02:10:55.104 --> 02:10:56.966]  That is now double confirmed.
[02:10:56.986 --> 02:10:59.068]  We need to send that to DrugsReport.com.
[02:10:59.088 --> 02:11:02.911]  We need to link that to the top of Paul's article that already deals with all this.
[02:11:02.951 --> 02:11:06.754]  So, valet entries from Mandalay Bay prove the gunman, Steven Paddock, checked into
[02:11:07.635 --> 02:11:13.116]  Uh, on September 25th, three days before the official date given by authorities for when he checked in September 28th.
[02:11:13.437 --> 02:11:20.999]  Reporter Laura Loomer obtained an image from inside Mandalay Valet Center, which shows Paddock's car was first logged on September 25th.
[02:11:21.319 --> 02:11:26.860]  Below the computer display, a handwritten note is available that states, Stephen Paddock, 925-1002.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:34.182]  According to Loomer's source, the note was written by an FBA agent when he asked Valet staff details on all in and out times for Paddock's vehicles.
[02:11:34.622 --> 02:11:38.223]  What do you make of this as a police officer, SWAT guy, all this?
[02:11:38.243 --> 02:11:40.904]  I mean I don't want to bash the FBI, the police, but
[02:11:58.371 --> 02:12:00.613]  And I understand they don't want people to know it's a terror attack, but why?
[02:12:00.633 --> 02:12:02.814]  Because we've confirmed all this.
[02:12:02.874 --> 02:12:04.275]  I mean, they're not telling us what went on here.
[02:12:04.736 --> 02:12:07.478]  So it's one thing to not tell folks what you know, it's another thing to lie.
[02:12:08.191 --> 02:12:10.751]  Right, I think the leverage should be put on the FBI.
[02:12:10.892 --> 02:12:13.352]  I think that law enforcement only have a certain capacity to even... No, I agree.
[02:12:13.372 --> 02:12:14.292]  It's the FBI doing this.
[02:12:14.352 --> 02:12:16.613]  It's the sheriff that keeps coming out and contradicting them.
[02:12:16.813 --> 02:12:16.973]  Right.
[02:12:17.013 --> 02:12:20.193]  The sheriff is trying to do the right thing and saying, look, we're not going to play the political games.
[02:12:20.213 --> 02:12:21.373]  We're not going to do that.
[02:12:21.393 --> 02:12:23.774]  We're going to give you information that we can at the best of our ability.
[02:12:24.094 --> 02:12:25.054]  But it's discouraging.
[02:12:25.094 --> 02:12:29.015]  And you know, the thing is, is that some people, they may not want to believe that the FBI does these things.
[02:12:29.035 --> 02:12:32.896]  And I'm not saying that the FBI is obvious, you know, they have obvious flaws.
[02:12:32.916 --> 02:12:34.936]  They have some good people, but they're famous for this.
[02:12:35.196 --> 02:12:35.416]  Exactly.
[02:12:35.516 --> 02:12:46.202]  I don't want to step on anybody's toes and say that, but what I'm saying is that, you know, even facts of the reason Hillary Clinton is not in prison right now is indications that they're not always truthful and they're not always doing what's right for the public.
[02:12:46.463 --> 02:12:47.883]  And I think that this is another example.
[02:12:47.903 --> 02:12:49.144]  They have some type of agenda.
[02:12:49.444 --> 02:12:50.265]  I don't know what it is.
[02:12:50.325 --> 02:12:53.587]  Maybe they don't want to be embarrassed, but there's no way that they should not be.
[02:12:53.607 --> 02:12:54.888]  I mean, this is the thing.
[02:12:54.988 --> 02:12:56.589]  If they weren't going to give information, that's fine.
[02:12:56.809 --> 02:12:58.570]  But don't give us fake information.
[02:12:58.590 --> 02:12:59.510]  Don't give us lies.
[02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:01.111]  Don't give us fraudulent stuff.
[02:13:01.131 --> 02:13:03.733]  If you're going to tell us when he checked in, at least tell us the true time.
[02:13:04.253 --> 02:13:08.236]  If you're not going to tell us the truth, Tommy, and you have a reason why, don't tell us anything at all.
[02:13:08.516 --> 02:13:13.140]  But what it does is it discredits their argument, and we don't even trust anything they say.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:21.706]  I was about to say, though, we've got the internal documents, we've got the receipts, we've got the valet info, and it keeps all checking out with the Sheriff's Department later.
[02:13:21.726 --> 02:13:23.247]  And then we've got the FBI.
[02:13:24.588 --> 02:13:28.793]  Doing this, Paul's headline, we'll put it back on screen, isn't even strong enough.
[02:13:29.273 --> 02:13:33.958]  The headline really should be, FBI caught lying about when the shooter checked in.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:40.626]  So, so this is, this is very, very, very, very serious.
[02:13:40.686 --> 02:13:44.330]  Valet entry proves Paddock checked in three days ago, then our reporter
[02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:53.009]  Ended up talking, we gotta get Laura Loomer on during the fourth hour with the great Mike Cernovich as well.
[02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:55.251]  Wow, this is just crazy.
[02:13:55.912 --> 02:13:56.312]  Right, right.
[02:13:56.372 --> 02:14:04.281]  Another thing that struck me was that why did they come out so soon and try to disconnect his motives, his tactics, his responsibility to ISIS?
[02:14:05.256 --> 02:14:06.217]  When they've taken credit.
[02:14:06.417 --> 02:14:10.359]  Right, when they've already taken credit, they come out and say, no, there's no evidence of it, no tracking.
[02:14:10.439 --> 02:14:12.921]  I mean, listen, this is a serious incident.
[02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:15.803]  It's going to take months to do a full, thorough investigation.
[02:14:15.823 --> 02:14:18.965]  Yeah, they're telling us don't jump to conclusions, but they jumped at minute one.
[02:14:19.065 --> 02:14:20.386]  Right, right.
[02:14:20.606 --> 02:14:21.847]  Obviously, it's for political gain.
[02:14:22.407 --> 02:14:30.092]  The common man knows that there's something suspicious, because in any other thing that benefits them, they'll say, no, take your time, do an investigation.
[02:14:30.112 --> 02:14:31.253]  Truth is, the Democrats are panicking.
[02:14:31.273 --> 02:14:32.374]  There's another one of their leftists.
[02:14:33.234 --> 02:14:38.900]  It's who we've got out there at Democrat rallies and everything else, just like Reality Winner and all the rest of them joined ISIS.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:39.300]  Right.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:40.482]  And it's super embarrassing.
[02:14:41.262 --> 02:14:42.283]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[02:14:42.323 --> 02:14:46.067]  Like, I mean, they act like ISIS is not pursuing the same motives.
[02:14:46.127 --> 02:14:49.251]  Like, it's not out of the question that they pursued him and that he'd been radicalized.
[02:14:49.271 --> 02:14:49.931]  They've done it before.
[02:14:50.051 --> 02:14:55.877]  They've got Linda Saucer leading the women's marches when she openly wants jihad and women with burqas on.
[02:14:57.239 --> 02:14:57.900]  They've done it before.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.620]  This is a tactic.
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.807]  This is an easy tactic for them because they don't have to pay or try to get people over here, and they may be suspicious.
[02:15:03.827 --> 02:15:09.373]  They're going to get people that are inconspicuous, and they're going to put them out there, and they're going to do crimes, and we catch them.
[02:15:10.094 --> 02:15:16.041]  But right now, they don't want us to know that because they don't want to be embarrassed that this person was probably a leftist doing a heinous crime.
[02:15:16.181 --> 02:15:20.584]  Brandon Tatum, you're going to be on for a full hour on The War Room, coming up at 3 o'clock.
[02:15:20.604 --> 02:15:21.545]  I'm going to let you get some lunch.
[02:15:21.565 --> 02:15:24.406]  You've done a great job hosting for the last hour plus with us.
[02:15:24.847 --> 02:15:30.931]  The Officer Tatum, facebook.com TatumBug34, youtube.com forward slash BTCruiser34.
[02:15:31.311 --> 02:15:33.332]  Incredible videos, incredible information.
[02:15:34.053 --> 02:15:35.013]  That's just his Twitter.
[02:15:35.213 --> 02:15:36.094]  Check out his Facebook.
[02:15:36.574 --> 02:15:37.575]  Last time I saw your Facebook was 100,000.
[02:15:37.635 --> 02:15:37.995]  What is it now?
[02:15:40.408 --> 02:15:46.953]  108.
[02:15:40.788 --> 02:15:46.953]  Well, you're doing awesome, and what's crazy is you can have 70 million views on one video, and just like us, the more folks don't follow us.
[02:15:47.273 --> 02:15:53.218]  It's important on our Facebooks, on our Twitters, on our YouTubes, to actually follow us so you get all the information.
[02:15:53.619 --> 02:15:59.083]  Get some lunch, get ready for the war room coming up live, and it's great to have you in town, sir.
[02:15:59.223 --> 02:15:59.524]  Thank you.
[02:15:59.544 --> 02:15:59.944]  Good to be here.
[02:15:59.964 --> 02:16:00.244]  Thank you.
[02:16:00.264 --> 02:16:02.426]  We're going to be right back with Robert Hewitt.
[02:16:02.526 --> 02:16:06.990]  I like to do things where I know I can at least take control of it myself, personally.
[02:16:08.328 --> 02:16:18.376]  And this isn't a pitch for water filtration, but we go out and find the very best gravity-fed water filters, where it takes out all the garbage, but doesn't take out the good minerals, and then I put my drinking water through that.
[02:16:19.497 --> 02:16:23.340]  And if I'm lazy, I've got reverse osmosis, which really cleans the water, but cuts out the minerals.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:27.403]  So over time, it's probably not too good for you to only drink reverse osmosis.
[02:16:27.443 --> 02:16:28.504]  That's in all the studies.
[02:16:29.064 --> 02:16:31.486]  But the other big area is the shampoo.
[02:16:33.101 --> 02:16:40.346]  And the sunscreens and the cosmetics and the body washes and the soap, which isn't really soap.
[02:16:41.006 --> 02:16:48.231]  So we had spent, and this is a plug, but it's really informational until the bottom of the hour when Sheriff Arpaio joins us.
[02:16:48.631 --> 02:16:56.576]  We spent years saying we want to get an organic, high quality line of toiletries and personal care products.
[02:16:57.625 --> 02:17:02.087]  So that I can use them in my own home and know from the manufacturer, it's really what they say.
[02:17:02.927 --> 02:17:14.032]  And folks, we got Mark Gonsalves, the owner of Nature's Brands, one of the biggest organic brands in the country, one of the top sellers at Whole Foods.
[02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:16.513]  Everybody recognizes our labeling because he's so nice.
[02:17:16.873 --> 02:17:20.815]  He even let us use basically his labeling, but changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:17:20.855 --> 02:17:25.357]  So whether you get it at Whole Foods under his name or from us, what's best about it is
[02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:33.272]  It's on the low end of cost, but better than a lot of the other so-called organic brands and is so respected.
[02:17:33.292 --> 02:17:35.453]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the expert.
[02:17:36.113 --> 02:17:43.276]  He's got a bunch of the brands there of what's in some of the other leading brands and some of the other supposed natural brands that really aren't organic.
[02:17:43.296 --> 02:17:45.657]  But Emmerich Essentials is nature's brand.
[02:17:45.857 --> 02:17:48.118]  We're under a chemical assault.
[02:17:48.478 --> 02:17:49.939]  It's unbelievable to me.
[02:17:50.746 --> 02:17:52.268]  What we've allowed to take place.
[02:17:52.468 --> 02:17:56.592]  We've got 84,000 chemicals now in play.
[02:17:57.052 --> 02:18:00.435]  13,000 of which are used in our cosmetics and personal care items.
[02:18:00.495 --> 02:18:02.277]  And we use these things every single day.
[02:18:03.337 --> 02:18:05.838]  Yet about 10% have ever been tested.
[02:18:06.278 --> 02:18:13.800]  So we always rely on the chemical company to be able to be considered innocent until we end up proving them guilty.
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:15.161]  Does that make any sense at all?
[02:18:15.661 --> 02:18:20.783]  So all these things that we put on our body, they're going into our bloodstream.
[02:18:21.063 --> 02:18:24.324]  Takes about 28 seconds to go into our bloodstream.
[02:18:24.524 --> 02:18:25.704]  So here's what we've got.
[02:18:25.944 --> 02:18:27.965]  We've got the FDA that says, hey, you know what?
[02:18:28.613 --> 02:18:30.094]  For external use only.
[02:18:30.375 --> 02:18:31.015]  Think about this.
[02:18:31.115 --> 02:18:31.676]  Think about this.
[02:18:31.696 --> 02:18:33.157]  They say it's for external use only.
[02:18:33.177 --> 02:18:34.758]  They're not stupid at the FDA.
[02:18:35.019 --> 02:18:37.160]  They know it goes into your bloodstream.
[02:18:37.801 --> 02:18:40.603]  What is the establishment going to do when all this comes out?
[02:18:40.843 --> 02:18:43.386]  It's already come out about bisphenol A and adrazine.
[02:18:43.646 --> 02:18:45.107]  And then they're still putting it in stuff.
[02:18:45.607 --> 02:18:46.848]  What's going to happen?
[02:18:47.149 --> 02:18:49.090]  Why are they doing it when I've looked it up?
[02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:53.314]  They've got chemicals that are even less expensive that they could be using that have less problems.
[02:18:53.514 --> 02:18:55.115]  It's like they go out of their way to do this.
[02:18:56.236 --> 02:19:00.301]  I think that companies today, are they purposely trying to kill us?
[02:19:00.321 --> 02:19:06.187]  I don't know if I'm going to go quite that far, but what I will say is, they don't seem to care if they do.
[02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:08.430]  They don't seem to care.
[02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.910]  Exactly.
[02:19:09.271 --> 02:19:17.279]  Just like Bayer with the hemophiliac factor 8, they knew it was in there, and they said, you know what, we'll lose money, go ahead and ship these millions of dosages.
[02:19:17.319 --> 02:19:17.860]  They just didn't care.
[02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:19.380]  Exactly.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.002]  Hey, as a young person, it was Ford with the Pintel, right?
[02:19:23.642 --> 02:19:26.003]  Oh yeah, well, we have 30 gas tanks that will blow up.
[02:19:26.023 --> 02:19:33.007]  Yeah, we'll get sued for millions and millions of dollars, but hey, at the end of the day, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than having to replace all those gas tanks in a recall.
[02:19:33.087 --> 02:19:35.348]  I mean, golly, we've got a business to protect.
[02:19:36.008 --> 02:19:39.530]  Again, when you place a person's well-being
[02:19:40.587 --> 02:19:48.173]  At the bottom rung of the ladder, and you place purely profit at the top, that is something seriously wrong.
[02:19:48.353 --> 02:19:49.314]  Well, we're really impressed.
[02:19:49.634 --> 02:19:50.535]  Mark, thank you so much.
[02:19:50.595 --> 02:19:51.596]  NaturesBrands.com.
[02:19:51.896 --> 02:19:57.941]  Folks can get their Enbricks Essentials, private label by you, God bless you, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[02:19:58.121 --> 02:19:59.282]  Mark Gonzales, thank you so much, sir.
[02:20:28.490 --> 02:20:31.771]  Well, we're about to go live to our guest, Robert Kiyosaki.
[02:20:31.871 --> 02:20:32.971]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.192]  He's with us for two segments.
[02:20:34.792 --> 02:20:42.034]  Then I have the former high-level Republican member of Trump's campaign, who has his sources in the White House.
[02:20:42.494 --> 02:20:43.654]  He's broken big stuff before.
[02:20:43.674 --> 02:20:53.557]  They have video of the shooter, Mr. Paddock, out in Vegas, pledging allegiance to ISIS, as ISIS said they have.
[02:20:54.827 --> 02:20:59.349]  And that they're sitting on it because law enforcement has asked Trump not to release it as part of the investigation.
[02:20:59.369 --> 02:21:04.932]  Well that's what the hostage rescue team told me on Monday as there was ISIS connections and Antifa connections.
[02:21:05.452 --> 02:21:09.995]  Well the left have been promising to launch this big revolution October 1st culminating November 4th.
[02:21:11.414 --> 02:21:13.455]  Maybe Robert Kiyosaki can comment.
[02:21:13.475 --> 02:21:14.236]  He's friends with Trump.
[02:21:14.296 --> 02:21:15.476]  Co-authored two books with him.
[02:21:15.736 --> 02:21:16.557]  The only guy that's done that.
[02:21:16.577 --> 02:21:19.238]  He's got a new book out we're going to tell you about as well.
[02:21:20.099 --> 02:21:27.203]  But obviously this is the big issue right now that is front and center as a former Marine Corps
[02:21:28.183 --> 02:21:32.730]  Cobra gunship pilot in Vietnam and looking at all the stuff that's going on.
[02:21:33.431 --> 02:21:37.256]  I can tell you right now, you see law enforcement saying, no he was radicalized, no he had help.
[02:21:37.537 --> 02:21:39.660]  Well that's what we told everybody on Monday because we have the sources.
[02:21:40.141 --> 02:21:42.805]  Why on earth would we let the left
[02:21:44.713 --> 02:21:51.094]  Blame conservatives and libertarians for this when they've got their hands all over it, because that's the intel we've got.
[02:21:51.134 --> 02:21:52.154]  And it's emerging.
[02:21:53.015 --> 02:21:55.095]  They covered up San Bernardino for three, four days.
[02:21:55.435 --> 02:21:57.095]  They've covered this up already five days.
[02:21:58.296 --> 02:22:00.656]  That's quite a limb out there against the mainstream media.
[02:22:00.696 --> 02:22:09.478]  But, I mean, Robert, what do you make of them blaming Christians, conservatives, libertarians with no proof, when we've got the kitchen sink and more with the Islamic connection?
[02:22:09.498 --> 02:22:10.138]  What do you make of this?
[02:22:11.206 --> 02:22:15.149]  Well, Alex, you know, I give you credit because you're the bravest man in the world.
[02:22:16.129 --> 02:22:18.971]  All of these years, you've been talking about fake news.
[02:22:20.613 --> 02:22:26.497]  And I think it behooves every one of us to really seek out what real news is.
[02:22:27.557 --> 02:22:30.079]  And I think that's why so many people tune into you.
[02:22:30.219 --> 02:22:31.620]  And I'm just like you.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:39.686]  I'm so disgusted because I don't even trust what I hear anymore or read or
[02:22:40.416 --> 02:22:41.496]  I don't trust the media.
[02:22:42.016 --> 02:22:49.058]  And I think that's a deeper issue right now when we can't trust our leaders and our media with fake news.
[02:22:49.118 --> 02:22:51.618]  So, I really have no comment.
[02:22:51.658 --> 02:22:52.638]  No, I mean, I agree.
[02:22:52.678 --> 02:22:53.959]  Who knows what the truth is?
[02:22:54.039 --> 02:22:55.719]  And then they can't, they don't even know what happened.
[02:22:55.939 --> 02:22:57.619]  But then if we question it, they say we're bad.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:22:58.720]  Right.
[02:22:58.860 --> 02:22:59.240]  Correct.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:02.960]  And then, you know, again, they're blaming guns and all this stuff.
[02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:04.261]  They want to take guns away.
[02:23:04.281 --> 02:23:05.881]  It's just a red herring.
[02:23:06.681 --> 02:23:08.623]  You've got the new book out.
[02:23:08.683 --> 02:23:10.144]  All your books are top best sellers.
[02:23:10.565 --> 02:23:11.846]  Why the rich are getting richer.
[02:23:11.926 --> 02:23:13.407]  What is financial education?
[02:23:13.807 --> 02:23:14.948]  Talking about solutions here.
[02:23:14.968 --> 02:23:16.910]  I want to get into the book and we're going to do that in a moment.
[02:23:17.411 --> 02:23:22.415]  But before we go any further, let me just ask you then, richdad.com is the big website.
[02:23:24.177 --> 02:23:27.500]  A lot of these are just secrets that once you know them, you're like, wow, that's so simple.
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:28.320]  Why didn't I know that before?
[02:23:28.641 --> 02:23:30.662]  Reading your books has helped me so much be independent.
[02:23:31.795 --> 02:23:36.297]  Looking at Trump, I mean, I don't want to involve myself in a butt-kissing deal here, but it's true.
[02:23:36.317 --> 02:23:43.360]  $4 trillion in the stock market, hundreds of billions in new jobs, 1.6 million new jobs, 3.1% growth rate they say they've ever had.
[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:48.422]  And this is just getting rid of a few regulations, trying to deliver tax cuts, doing everything else he said.
[02:23:48.882 --> 02:23:56.745]  Why are they so against him when everybody, including Goldman Sachs, has made record profits the last nine months under Trump?
[02:23:56.985 --> 02:23:57.866]  What's their problem?
[02:23:58.066 --> 02:24:00.607]  He's like shoveling success at them, and they're mad.
[02:24:02.421 --> 02:24:08.783]  Well, I think the biggest reason is because most people are not getting richer.
[02:24:09.344 --> 02:24:11.905]  That's why my book is called Why the Rich Are Getting Richer.
[02:24:12.865 --> 02:24:16.426]  And the average person is not getting richer.
[02:24:17.367 --> 02:24:22.569]  And so that's why the media is obviously a big part of that, because they lie to us.
[02:24:24.153 --> 02:24:28.956]  People are getting poorer, not richer, no matter how high that stock market goes.
[02:24:29.336 --> 02:24:30.197]  And that's the problem.
[02:24:30.457 --> 02:24:31.398]  Explain it to me then.
[02:24:31.438 --> 02:24:32.638]  I mean, I haven't read the new book yet.
[02:24:32.658 --> 02:24:34.360]  I probably read the first book I read of yours.
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:37.141]  I was like 16 years old, literally.
[02:24:37.361 --> 02:24:45.386]  So explain to me, explain to me what I'm... There's fake news.
[02:24:45.647 --> 02:24:49.309]  In 1971, when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:24:49.369 --> 02:24:50.790]  dollar became fake money.
[02:24:51.613 --> 02:24:55.656]  And I became and I was in Vietnam in 72 when that happened.
[02:24:56.537 --> 02:24:58.859]  And I started to realize that the U.S.
[02:24:58.939 --> 02:25:01.401]  dollar was not designed to make us rich.
[02:25:02.081 --> 02:25:02.642]  The U.S.
[02:25:02.722 --> 02:25:11.028]  dollar, once it became fake, you know, a fiat currency was intentionally designed to steal our wealth and our lives.
[02:25:11.709 --> 02:25:16.873]  So that's why if you read Rich Dad Poor Dad, which came out 20 years ago, I said the rich don't work for money.
[02:25:17.737 --> 02:25:23.239]  And the rich avoid taxes, because the more you work for money, actually, the poorer you get.
[02:25:24.059 --> 02:25:31.761]  Another example is I was at the bank yesterday, doing desperately, because I have so much cash coming in, to hide it in different banks.
[02:25:32.821 --> 02:25:35.342]  And the bank teller sat there, she says, Oh!
[02:25:36.903 --> 02:25:37.923]  We're gonna give you .011%!
[02:25:37.963 --> 02:25:38.683]  I went,
[02:25:42.617 --> 02:25:42.857]  What?
[02:25:43.418 --> 02:25:45.979]  I mean, I've been so out of doing my own banking.
[02:25:46.119 --> 02:25:53.524]  I said, how does somebody survive on 0.011 or 0.015 percent when inflation is running at 9 percent?
[02:25:54.505 --> 02:26:00.929]  You know, and so Americans are getting poorer just because they have no financial education in schools.
[02:26:01.409 --> 02:26:06.632]  And that's why Donald Trump and I became such good friends, is we want to teach people about money.
[02:26:08.313 --> 02:26:10.655]  People are going to want to read the book, and they should read them all.
[02:26:11.921 --> 02:26:12.281]  Thank you.
[02:26:12.702 --> 02:26:13.962]  What was the first book you wrote?
[02:26:13.982 --> 02:26:21.306]  Because, I mean, I'm 44, and I know from memory, I think I was in high school when I read your first book.
[02:26:22.407 --> 02:26:23.528]  When did you first publish a book?
[02:26:24.868 --> 02:26:25.509]  It was 1997.
[02:26:25.749 --> 02:26:29.591]  Okay, then my memory's wrong.
[02:26:30.011 --> 02:26:30.832]  It must have been after that.
[02:26:30.872 --> 02:26:33.833]  My dad was trying to get me to read books about investment and something else.
[02:26:33.853 --> 02:26:35.994]  But I know, I mean, I read your book very early on.
[02:26:36.715 --> 02:26:38.616]  It's just amazing, these common-sense secrets.
[02:26:40.359 --> 02:26:43.381]  Well, it's that, why is there no financial education in school?
[02:26:44.422 --> 02:26:55.151]  You know, and these teachers kind of teach, and you know, my poor dad was a school teacher, he was a good man, but he doesn't know anything about money, and he's teaching kids that the rich are evil.
[02:26:55.991 --> 02:26:58.613]  And I'm going, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know?
[02:26:59.094 --> 02:27:02.957]  Let me just say it again, our monetary system is fake money.
[02:27:03.815 --> 02:27:10.080]  And the people that work for it, you know, with that book White Working Class and all that, they're getting ripped off.
[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:12.722]  The harder they work for money, the more tax they pay.
[02:27:12.742 --> 02:27:16.484]  They put it in the bank and inflation eats it away.
[02:27:16.504 --> 02:27:22.869]  And if they're in the stock market, they don't know how to handle it if the stock market comes down.
[02:27:23.593 --> 02:27:26.335]  And that's all basic financial education.
[02:27:26.415 --> 02:27:32.420]  So that's why President Trump and I have become good friends as advocates of financial education for everybody.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:35.203]  How did he fundamentally know the same secrets you knew?
[02:27:35.223 --> 02:27:36.504]  I mean, how did you discover this stuff?
[02:27:37.585 --> 02:27:38.745]  Well, we both had rich dads.
[02:27:38.766 --> 02:27:41.728]  His dad was rich and my rich dad was a rich guy.
[02:27:43.283 --> 02:27:48.770]  So in my latest book, Why the Rich are Getting Richer, I explain how debt and taxes make the rich richer.
[02:27:49.290 --> 02:27:54.577]  In other words, it's ironic that, you know, in 1971, the dollar became debt, an I.O.U.
[02:27:54.677 --> 02:27:55.298]  from the U.S.
[02:27:55.358 --> 02:27:56.299]  Treasury and the Fed.
[02:27:57.865 --> 02:28:03.689]  And because it's debt, the more I use debt to buy assets, the less tax I pay.
[02:28:04.149 --> 02:28:09.853]  So the reason the rich are getting richer is they use debt and pay less in taxes, legally.
[02:28:10.134 --> 02:28:14.657]  Even before your book came out, my dad would explain, no, no, the rich are leveraging debt.
[02:28:14.677 --> 02:28:18.940]  It didn't make sense to me when I was like 14 years old, but that's what they're doing.
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:25.124]  But they teach us to go into debt just to them for nothing, instead of using the debt to build stuff.
[02:28:25.953 --> 02:28:26.173]  Yes.
[02:28:26.634 --> 02:28:27.574]  You should use debt.
[02:28:27.694 --> 02:28:30.897]  I mean, you have to have financial education to use debt because it's dangerous.
[02:28:30.937 --> 02:28:31.698]  Let's look at guns.
[02:28:31.818 --> 02:28:34.820]  Well, let's talk about it in a final segment with Robert Kiyosaki.
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:36.201]  RichDad.com.
[02:28:36.241 --> 02:28:38.663]  His new book is out, Why the Rich Are Getting Richer.
[02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:41.285]  What is financial education?
[02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:42.946]  Yeah, because exactly.
[02:28:42.966 --> 02:28:45.108]  You're not going to get it from a professor or some school teacher.
[02:28:45.368 --> 02:28:46.069]  Nothing against them.
[02:28:46.429 --> 02:28:48.491]  They just, they're making $40,000 a year.
[02:28:48.871 --> 02:28:51.353]  They're not who you learn how to get successful from.
[02:28:51.393 --> 02:28:52.994]  And we want to make everybody successful.
[02:28:53.034 --> 02:28:53.935]  That's what free market's about.
[02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:06.551]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:29:07.011 --> 02:29:12.072]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:29:12.592 --> 02:29:16.512]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:29:16.552 --> 02:29:19.853]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:29:20.513 --> 02:29:24.974]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:29:25.614 --> 02:29:28.855]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:29:29.555 --> 02:29:31.095]  I came in here an hour ago.
[02:29:31.855 --> 02:29:39.077]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[02:29:39.377 --> 02:29:43.179]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:29:43.779 --> 02:29:47.240]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:49.300]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[02:29:49.761 --> 02:29:56.083]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:29:56.123 --> 02:29:57.023]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:29:57.563 --> 02:29:59.084]  This is verified by our Mark.
[02:29:59.285 --> 02:30:02.227]  Five-star review for AnthroPlex for men and women.
[02:30:02.707 --> 02:30:03.748]  I take it as directed.
[02:30:03.768 --> 02:30:14.658]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[02:30:15.218 --> 02:30:15.899]  Easy does it.
[02:30:15.979 --> 02:30:17.000]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:17.981]  It's very, very serious.
[02:30:18.381 --> 02:30:18.781]  Not a game.
[02:30:18.821 --> 02:30:19.242]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:30:19.722 --> 02:30:21.023]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:30:21.163 --> 02:30:21.964]  Energy all day.
[02:30:22.404 --> 02:30:29.689]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:30:30.129 --> 02:30:30.830]  Another review.
[02:30:30.850 --> 02:30:31.850]  I love this one.
[02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:34.592]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:30:34.972 --> 02:30:38.495]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:30:38.775 --> 02:30:41.697]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:30:42.077 --> 02:30:43.598]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:43.999 --> 02:30:47.362]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:30:47.642 --> 02:30:50.825]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:30:50.885 --> 02:30:55.609]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:30:55.749 --> 02:30:56.730]  Amazing product.
[02:30:57.470 --> 02:30:59.531]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:30:59.951 --> 02:31:00.952]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:31:01.272 --> 02:31:03.353]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:31:03.473 --> 02:31:04.314]  Thank you all.
[02:31:04.714 --> 02:31:08.356]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:31:08.436 --> 02:31:10.657]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:31:11.037 --> 02:31:12.998]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:31:13.478 --> 02:31:16.940]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:17.841]  And I should add,
[02:31:18.641 --> 02:31:19.762]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:31:20.022 --> 02:31:21.843]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:31:21.863 --> 02:31:23.584]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:31:23.924 --> 02:31:25.245]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:31:25.325 --> 02:31:26.926]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:31:26.966 --> 02:31:27.526]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:31:27.786 --> 02:31:28.547]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:31:29.387 --> 02:31:30.208]  But back to the script.
[02:31:30.568 --> 02:31:32.449]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:31:32.489 --> 02:31:33.209]  I love that name too.
[02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:35.671]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:31:35.971 --> 02:31:40.173]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:31:40.213 --> 02:31:42.775]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:31:42.835 --> 02:31:44.275]  You make it literally possible.
[02:31:45.336 --> 02:31:50.141]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[02:31:50.661 --> 02:31:53.504]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:31:53.784 --> 02:31:57.348]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:31:57.868 --> 02:31:59.850]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be.
[02:32:01.071 --> 02:32:03.553]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:32:03.913 --> 02:32:06.015]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:32:06.355 --> 02:32:12.219]  Whenever I feel the first haze of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:32:12.639 --> 02:32:18.383]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015, and it's worked for everyone.
[02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:25.247]  It has become an expected gift for our family, and that's why we get you the best products, because we want to repeat customers.
[02:32:25.508 --> 02:32:26.328]  It's all a win-win.
[02:32:26.488 --> 02:32:27.389]  That's an awesome review.
[02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:30.691]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family as well.
[02:32:30.691 --> 02:32:32.691]  Well, we've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:32:32.751 --> 02:32:35.712]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:32:35.732 --> 02:32:36.912]  They're all five-star.
[02:32:37.172 --> 02:32:43.093]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:32:43.173 --> 02:32:46.454]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:32:46.734 --> 02:32:48.534]  Best post-workout ever is when Andrew says.
[02:32:48.834 --> 02:32:52.355]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:52.395 --> 02:32:57.516]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:18.742]  Folks, InfoWars is undoubtedly the leader of the pack.
[02:33:39.622 --> 02:33:41.904]  We get demonized, we get lied about, they misrepresent.
[02:33:42.505 --> 02:33:46.269]  They had articles out two days ago going, Jones says the Las Vegas shooting didn't happen.
[02:33:46.849 --> 02:33:47.470]  Ban him!
[02:33:48.962 --> 02:33:53.025]  And then YouTube and Google said, yes, we'll look at banning everyone we want.
[02:33:53.085 --> 02:33:56.048]  That's just the leftist wanting to set the precedent to ban people.
[02:33:56.769 --> 02:33:58.530]  They're already having to back off now.
[02:33:58.550 --> 02:34:00.672]  They're calling Rupert Murdoch the hero, and I agree.
[02:34:01.653 --> 02:34:07.457]  He's talking about antitrust suits for how they're trying to restrict conservatives and others and misrepresenting what we're saying and doing.
[02:34:07.878 --> 02:34:10.040]  Even Daily Beast has the big headline.
[02:34:11.272 --> 02:34:12.593]  That Rupert Murdoch's the hero.
[02:34:12.613 --> 02:34:17.478]  Because even the left gets these monopolies are very, very bad for business and for free speech.
[02:34:17.878 --> 02:34:19.440]  Robert Kiyosaki is our guest.
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:27.988]  Coming up in the next segment, leader of the PAC, former Trump campaign official reports Las Vegas shooter made ISIS tape.
[02:34:29.569 --> 02:34:35.075]  So that is a big, big deal that is coming up.
[02:34:36.397 --> 02:34:37.838]  Going back to Robert Kiyosaki.
[02:34:38.178 --> 02:34:42.502]  Robert, just in layman's terms, everybody should read your new book, Why the Rich Are Getting Richer.
[02:34:43.463 --> 02:34:50.088]  But if you go back in time, we had super ultra-rich, but maybe they had a third of the wealth, or 20%.
[02:34:50.148 --> 02:34:53.130]  Now, it's 70 plus percent is by less than 1%.
[02:34:53.331 --> 02:35:00.356]  Then that one-fifth of 1%, six, the giant underclass on the middle class that's the top 10%,
[02:35:02.452 --> 02:35:03.633]  Which is the engine of success.
[02:35:03.733 --> 02:35:15.483]  Why would the elites not just set up this consolidation of power and money and have vertical integration, but then try to kill the engine of free market like they're rising up the ladder so no one gets up?
[02:35:15.543 --> 02:35:18.325]  Are they really trying to form a cold-blooded monopoly?
[02:35:18.565 --> 02:35:19.526]  That's why I like what you do.
[02:35:19.566 --> 02:35:24.790]  You're exposing what they're up to so that the average person cannot be monopolized?
[02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:25.551]  What are you up to?
[02:35:26.755 --> 02:35:29.517]  Well, I hate to say this, you know, the story of Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
[02:35:29.737 --> 02:35:33.919]  My poor dad went to Stanford Northwestern University, University of Chicago.
[02:35:34.319 --> 02:35:35.180]  Very good man.
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:36.761]  And you would call him an elite.
[02:35:37.281 --> 02:35:42.424]  But they have no financial education and they're more socialist than capitalist.
[02:35:42.604 --> 02:35:43.644]  That's where it starts.
[02:35:44.905 --> 02:35:49.328]  My concern is without knowing it, the school system is complicit.
[02:35:49.528 --> 02:35:51.609]  They're part of the big part of the program.
[02:35:52.375 --> 02:35:53.875]  Because they teach you to be poor.
[02:35:54.095 --> 02:35:55.236]  Remember, the U.S.
[02:35:55.296 --> 02:36:05.699]  dollar after 1971 became fake money designed by the Fed and the Treasury and Wall Street to steal your life and your wealth from you.
[02:36:06.239 --> 02:36:09.820]  So that's why when you save money, you get nothing for it.
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:14.101]  The first thing you do when you get your paycheck, taxes are sucked out of it.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:22.526]  So why the rich are getting richer is about debt and taxes, how the rich, like President Trump and I, get richer.
[02:36:22.866 --> 02:36:28.571]  I'm not saying you should do it or that it's not without risk, but you should be aware of why.
[02:36:28.591 --> 02:36:34.495]  Sure, but how was the conscious decision made, 1913, and then, you know, you had other agreements later, Bretton Woods in the 40s.
[02:36:35.456 --> 02:36:41.980]  How do they decide, oh, let's dynamite a system that makes the general public wealthy and the elite even more wealthy.
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.863]  No, let's have a system where you're poor and the elite use austerity to control you.
[02:36:47.143 --> 02:36:48.984]  I mean, isn't that what the Trump revolution is?
[02:36:49.324 --> 02:36:52.486]  Is he's actually trying to deliver back a real level playing field?
[02:36:52.727 --> 02:36:54.207]  Because that makes the rich even richer.
[02:36:54.568 --> 02:36:56.129]  I mean, isn't that the essence of this?
[02:36:57.329 --> 02:36:59.491]  But that's why he's under attack so much.
[02:36:59.531 --> 02:37:01.672]  That's why you're under attack so much.
[02:37:01.692 --> 02:37:03.213]  That's why I come under attack.
[02:37:03.846 --> 02:37:08.689]  Because we go after the academic elites who are really parasitic.
[02:37:08.749 --> 02:37:11.250]  You know, they really don't know what they're doing.
[02:37:11.891 --> 02:37:13.251]  And they've led our country.
[02:37:13.271 --> 02:37:16.233]  You know, today we had Bernanke and we have Yellen.
[02:37:16.393 --> 02:37:22.697]  They're college professors running the most powerful central bank in history.
[02:37:23.337 --> 02:37:24.538]  And they need a paycheck.
[02:37:25.509 --> 02:37:38.632]  You know, we need somebody who knows how to- And they've just- Trump has forced them to come 10 degrees, not 180, towards what he wants, and it's already got the economy roaring, and they start going, oh, we'll never grow to- we don't want to overheat.
[02:37:38.972 --> 02:37:42.973]  Overheat means they don't get to turn you into renters, you become wealthy.
[02:37:43.013 --> 02:37:43.613]  They don't want that.
[02:37:44.854 --> 02:37:55.156]  Right, and the worst thing- I'm terrified right now is, as you know, all markets go up, and if the market goes down, President Trump will get the blame.
[02:37:55.951 --> 02:37:57.172]  And it's those guys.
[02:37:57.612 --> 02:37:59.794]  You see, the problem isn't in the stock market.
[02:37:59.874 --> 02:38:01.716]  The problem is in our bond markets.
[02:38:02.316 --> 02:38:06.320]  And the average person doesn't even know what a bond is because they don't have enough money.
[02:38:07.681 --> 02:38:11.024]  And we're being ripped off by the very people we trust our money to.
[02:38:12.565 --> 02:38:13.606]  Please elaborate on that.
[02:38:13.666 --> 02:38:22.733]  As a self-made Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam, a guy that's made hundreds of millions of dollars, number one New York Times bestseller, you don't usually talk like that.
[02:38:22.753 --> 02:38:24.515]  When you say you're horrified, I'm listening.
[02:38:26.539 --> 02:38:29.860]  Well, all markets go up and all markets come down.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:31.581]  It's like Lucy and the football.
[02:38:31.601 --> 02:38:33.422]  She's going to they're going to pull the football away.
[02:38:34.282 --> 02:38:37.224]  And they really don't want Trump to do what he does.
[02:38:38.504 --> 02:38:40.625]  And you have Buffett up there.
[02:38:40.685 --> 02:38:43.046]  You know, I mean, look at what Buffett's doing.
[02:38:43.106 --> 02:38:47.528]  He's taking his money from stocks and put it into a railroad.
[02:38:48.482 --> 02:38:51.423]  Everybody should not listen to what Buffett is saying.
[02:38:51.523 --> 02:38:52.423]  Watch what he does.
[02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:53.783]  You should get your money out.
[02:38:53.803 --> 02:38:57.224]  He says stay in stocks, stay in stocks while he's grabbing his money out as fast as he can.
[02:38:58.484 --> 02:38:58.864]  Amen!
[02:39:00.204 --> 02:39:02.785]  Watch what he does, not what he says.
[02:39:03.265 --> 02:39:07.386]  So get your money out of stocks and get into real gold.
[02:39:07.406 --> 02:39:10.186]  You know, silver, gold and silver coins.
[02:39:10.746 --> 02:39:12.507]  Because there's now fake gold out there.
[02:39:12.527 --> 02:39:13.367]  It's fake everything.
[02:39:13.996 --> 02:39:23.841]  But anyway, right now you better get real as quickly as possible and possibly start your own business because if the next crash comes, many people will lose their jobs.
[02:39:24.181 --> 02:39:31.124]  Well, I mean, if the robber baron kleptocrat monopoly men would have gotten behind Trump's recovery, could it have been bulletproof?
[02:39:31.404 --> 02:39:33.025]  I mean, I hope it just keeps going, but I agree.
[02:39:33.345 --> 02:39:35.686]  They're openly fighting against it with interest rates hikes.
[02:39:35.846 --> 02:39:37.307]  They can't get rid of Obamacare right now.
[02:39:37.607 --> 02:39:38.428]  That's a wet blanket.
[02:39:38.448 --> 02:39:42.830]  I mean, to watch them cheerlead and admit they want to plunge things to discredit Trump,
[02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:44.571]  That is sickening.
[02:39:45.513 --> 02:39:49.418]  Well, what's really sickening is that they're only doing it to get richer.
[02:39:49.918 --> 02:39:50.098]  Yeah.
[02:39:50.118 --> 02:39:51.781]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[02:39:52.181 --> 02:39:55.585]  The problem started in 2008 when that market came down.
[02:39:56.026 --> 02:39:57.328]  They could have fixed it then.
[02:39:58.274 --> 02:40:00.955]  But they were making too much money, so why fix it?
[02:40:01.355 --> 02:40:07.738]  So the biggest money printing in history went on, and now they don't know how to stop what's about to come.
[02:40:08.038 --> 02:40:16.321]  There's too much money, unfortunately, there's too much money in only a few people's hands, and that's why I wrote, Why The Rich Are Getting Richer.
[02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:19.242]  Everything is opposite of what they teach you in school.
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:29.525]  And their desperate rearguard reaction is to start a race war so we don't notice that they stole our entire future and know full well what they've done and given all the fiat money to themselves.
[02:40:29.845 --> 02:40:33.467]  It'd be one thing if they gave it to everybody, you'd just have inflation, which we do have.
[02:40:33.527 --> 02:40:44.713]  Instead, as you said, they've concentrated it in the hands of a few thousand jerks who are all fake liberal dirtbags and then Trump wades in and you wade in and try to fix it and then they call you the devil.
[02:40:46.234 --> 02:40:47.615]  Absolutely, the same as you.
[02:40:48.348 --> 02:40:54.111]  So remember, there's fake news, there's fake money, and there's fake assets.
[02:40:54.791 --> 02:40:59.034]  And right now, you've got to be very careful if you're in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs.
[02:40:59.454 --> 02:41:01.895]  You've got to know what's real and what's not real.
[02:41:01.935 --> 02:41:03.036]  And your book breaks it down.
[02:41:03.056 --> 02:41:07.058]  It's one thing to ride the bubble up to get out at the right time, but you folks never know when the thief comes at night.
[02:41:07.538 --> 02:41:10.980]  Your book breaks it down, but in a minute and a half, what are you doing with your money?
[02:41:12.532 --> 02:41:15.433]  Well, I'm in gold and real estate.
[02:41:15.973 --> 02:41:20.214]  And I love debt, and I minimize my taxes because I use debt.
[02:41:20.594 --> 02:41:23.514]  Remember, in 1971, money became debt.
[02:41:23.894 --> 02:41:24.975]  It's fake money.
[02:41:25.635 --> 02:41:29.676]  So when some people are saying, get out of debt, I'm getting into debt.
[02:41:30.136 --> 02:41:33.176]  And that's why debt and taxes make the rich richer.
[02:41:33.196 --> 02:41:34.677]  But there's a ratio to do it.
[02:41:34.717 --> 02:41:37.597]  You don't... I mean, if you're going to get into debt, you want to get in big.
[02:41:39.037 --> 02:41:41.418]  I'm 100% debt on most of my investments.
[02:41:42.873 --> 02:41:45.095]  But I've been trained to do it by my rich dad.
[02:41:45.715 --> 02:41:50.038]  So Trump- And again, you explain, I haven't read your book in 20 years, but you explain you had a rich dad and a poor dad.
[02:41:51.219 --> 02:41:55.742]  Well, my poor dad was my father, a Stanford University of Chicago guy.
[02:41:56.423 --> 02:41:58.944]  But he knew nothing- He's behind you right there in the photo.
[02:42:00.205 --> 02:42:02.227]  That's my poor dad.
[02:42:02.287 --> 02:42:03.848]  He was Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii.
[02:42:04.348 --> 02:42:04.548]  Yeah.
[02:42:04.608 --> 02:42:05.809]  Ban for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii.
[02:42:05.829 --> 02:42:06.570]  He's a Republican.
[02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.931]  He got crushed.
[02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:12.793]  Because he stood up to the most corrupt state government in the nation.
[02:42:12.813 --> 02:42:13.314]  That's a poor dad.
[02:42:13.334 --> 02:42:14.154]  Tell us about the rich dad.
[02:42:15.075 --> 02:42:22.861]  The rich dad, well, let me just say that he stood up to, as a Republican, to the corrupt Democratic government of Hawaii, and he lost his job.
[02:42:23.882 --> 02:42:31.247]  And then my rich dad was my best friend's father who never went to school, but he owned most of Waikiki, so I listened to him instead of my poor dad.
[02:42:32.228 --> 02:42:33.369]  So, that was smart of you.
[02:42:35.401 --> 02:42:38.624]  I like, I like, I like listening to smart people like you.
[02:42:39.365 --> 02:42:40.365]  I listen to you too.
[02:42:40.926 --> 02:42:44.488]  All right, Robert Kiyosaki, the new book, Why the Rich Are Getting Richer.
[02:42:44.869 --> 02:42:46.030]  What is Financial Education?
[02:42:46.330 --> 02:42:47.311]  Please join us again soon.
[02:42:47.331 --> 02:42:48.151]  It was hard to get you on.
[02:42:48.171 --> 02:42:48.892]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:42:49.833 --> 02:42:51.294]  Thanks for doing what you do, Alex.
[02:42:51.354 --> 02:42:51.914]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:52.174 --> 02:42:52.615]  Thank you, sir.
[02:43:03.959 --> 02:43:10.661]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[02:43:11.361 --> 02:43:13.501]  By studying what they fear.
[02:43:14.222 --> 02:43:16.022]  They fear families living together.
[02:43:16.062 --> 02:43:19.003]  They fear people loving God.
[02:43:19.083 --> 02:43:23.724]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[02:43:25.024 --> 02:43:32.266]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounty of a free market system.
[02:43:34.246 --> 02:43:40.690]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[02:43:42.251 --> 02:43:48.355]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[02:43:49.255 --> 02:44:02.344]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[02:44:03.345 --> 02:44:09.931]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:44:11.212 --> 02:44:18.999]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[02:44:20.721 --> 02:44:21.882]  And so many things will happen.
[02:44:23.103 --> 02:44:24.104]  We are the majority.
[02:44:25.014 --> 02:44:33.745]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[02:44:34.906 --> 02:44:39.913]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.801]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[02:44:44.641 --> 02:44:52.844]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[02:44:53.524 --> 02:44:59.887]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[02:45:01.747 --> 02:45:02.648]  So many people write me.
[02:45:03.482 --> 02:45:11.729]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:14.091]  We have to fly our flag.
[02:45:15.066 --> 02:45:16.527]  We have to wear our colors.
[02:45:16.828 --> 02:45:21.472]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:22.133 --> 02:45:24.995]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[02:45:25.216 --> 02:45:36.466]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[02:45:36.687 --> 02:45:38.729]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:45:39.289 --> 02:45:41.450]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:44.151]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[02:45:44.571 --> 02:45:51.214]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[02:45:51.715 --> 02:45:56.357]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[02:45:57.237 --> 02:46:04.242]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[02:46:04.562 --> 02:46:07.544]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[02:46:07.904 --> 02:46:24.915]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[02:46:25.695 --> 02:46:34.437]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[02:46:35.098 --> 02:46:39.759]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[02:46:39.799 --> 02:46:51.662]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[02:46:52.002 --> 02:46:55.483]  So please, from myself and my family and the amazing crew,
[02:46:55.723 --> 02:46:56.083]  We're good to go.
[02:46:56.103 --> 02:46:56.824]  We're good to go.
[02:46:56.844 --> 02:46:57.324]  We're good to go.
[02:46:57.505 --> 02:46:57.905]  We're good to go.
[02:46:57.925 --> 02:46:58.325]  We're good to go.
[02:46:58.385 --> 02:46:58.946]  We're good to go.
[02:46:58.966 --> 02:46:59.386]  We're good to go.
[02:46:59.406 --> 02:46:59.726]  We're good to go.
[02:46:59.746 --> 02:47:00.207]  We're good to go.
[02:47:00.227 --> 02:47:00.547]  We're good to go.
[02:47:00.567 --> 02:47:00.887]  We're good to go.
[02:47:00.907 --> 02:47:01.228]  We're good to go.
[02:47:01.248 --> 02:47:01.568]  We're good to go.
[02:47:01.588 --> 02:47:01.908]  We're good to go.
[02:47:01.928 --> 02:47:02.248]  We're good to go.
[02:47:02.268 --> 02:47:02.589]  We're good to go.
[02:47:02.609 --> 02:47:07.813]  We're good to go.
[02:47:07.833 --> 02:47:08.153]  We're good to go.
[02:47:08.173 --> 02:47:08.493]  We're good to go.
[02:47:08.513 --> 02:47:09.214]  We're good to go.
[02:47:09.734 --> 02:47:10.415]  We're good to go.
[02:47:10.435 --> 02:47:12.096]  We're good to go.
[02:47:12.216 --> 02:47:12.977]  We're good to go.
[02:47:13.257 --> 02:47:13.818]  We're good to go.
[02:47:13.958 --> 02:47:14.919]  We're good to go.
[02:47:15.379 --> 02:47:17.000]  We're good to go.
[02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:19.602]  We're good to go.
[02:47:19.622 --> 02:47:20.063]  We're good to go.
[02:47:20.183 --> 02:47:20.523]  We're good to go.
[02:47:20.543 --> 02:47:20.903]  We're good to go.
[02:47:20.923 --> 02:47:21.264]  We're good to go.
[02:47:21.364 --> 02:47:21.984]  We're good to go.
[02:47:22.064 --> 02:47:22.545]  We're good to go.
[02:47:22.565 --> 02:47:22.985]  We're good to go.
[02:47:23.005 --> 02:47:23.365]  We're good to go.
[02:47:23.385 --> 02:47:23.706]  We're good to go.
[02:47:23.726 --> 02:47:24.086]  We're good to go.
[02:47:24.106 --> 02:47:24.206]  We're
[02:47:35.519 --> 02:47:43.382]  America is a dream and we have to believe in it and execute the Open Free Society ideas to actually live in it.
[02:47:44.342 --> 02:47:46.583]  George Soros calls his operation the Open Society.
[02:47:46.663 --> 02:47:47.283]  It's the opposite.
[02:47:47.303 --> 02:47:50.685]  He's trying to hijack the West, hijack the Renaissance and kill it.
[02:47:51.105 --> 02:47:51.845]  We're fighting back.
[02:47:52.445 --> 02:47:53.906]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:47:54.366 --> 02:47:55.406]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:47:55.426 --> 02:48:01.649]  I'll be hosting with Mike Cernovich coming up into the fourth hour and we have some very important guests.
[02:48:02.799 --> 02:48:10.385]  They're going to be joining us, including one in-studio survivor who I've known for years, who was in Vegas, but doesn't want to be on camera.
[02:48:10.485 --> 02:48:13.928]  Just like when Drudge was here a few years ago, he's going to be over there in the dark with a mic.
[02:48:13.948 --> 02:48:18.051]  He's going to tell you some of the things he saw coming up.
[02:48:18.171 --> 02:48:20.312]  Clearly, two shooters the first two minutes.
[02:48:20.813 --> 02:48:22.014]  Just his video show.
[02:48:22.954 --> 02:48:24.115]  Off the distance, not an echo.
[02:48:24.456 --> 02:48:25.657]  Then huge shooting coming up.
[02:48:26.584 --> 02:48:36.153]  But in this segment and the next, we are joined by James Broder, and he is a former state assistant director for President Trump.
[02:48:36.694 --> 02:48:49.105]  He has, at jbro underscore 7076, he has released a lot of great info in the past with his White House connections, and I've got to tell you right now,
[02:48:50.066 --> 02:48:51.568]  I don't just have the hostage rescue team.
[02:48:52.128 --> 02:48:54.570]  We had Colonel Schaefer on earlier concurring with our analysis.
[02:48:55.031 --> 02:48:56.872]  He's got CIA connections, Army connections.
[02:48:57.313 --> 02:48:58.854]  I have other connections and they say yes.
[02:48:59.275 --> 02:49:00.376]  I just took responsibility.
[02:49:00.636 --> 02:49:02.558]  They've got him taking credit with this video.
[02:49:04.278 --> 02:49:04.818]  That's paddock.
[02:49:05.799 --> 02:49:07.340]  And they want to suppress it.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:09.361]  They're telling the President, well, it's for national security.
[02:49:09.781 --> 02:49:11.982]  We don't want to trigger ISIS with codes or something.
[02:49:12.643 --> 02:49:24.690]  That's stay-behind-networks Obama people, from our research, saying that so they don't get blamed for what they've done, so that Trump sits there while they blame gun owners, the Second Amendment, veterans, and patriots, which they've done.
[02:49:25.770 --> 02:49:29.475]  But James Brouwer joins us to go over this.
[02:49:29.515 --> 02:49:32.558]  Paul's article is linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:49:32.879 --> 02:49:37.284]  Former Trump campaign official reports Las Vegas shooter made ISIS tape.
[02:49:37.464 --> 02:49:42.790]  Now remember, within hours of this happening, ISIS took responsibility and the FBI said no, they didn't do it!
[02:49:43.942 --> 02:49:45.423]  We don't know what happened, but they didn't do it.
[02:49:45.943 --> 02:49:48.545]  That's the biggest tell you'll ever see right there.
[02:49:49.326 --> 02:50:09.879]  But again, we have these sources, but I wanted to specifically get James Brower to go into this for us, and as much as he can tell us from his White House source, because my sources are in the military, they're in the FBI, they're in the CIA, and they say absolutely, they say this guy was connected to other attacks, now you see it in the news today, the bombings in New York,
[02:50:10.659 --> 02:50:14.702]  So, James, tell us, you've put out some big leaks before that have been accurate.
[02:50:15.062 --> 02:50:18.805]  Tell us what your sources in the White House are specifically telling you.
[02:50:20.526 --> 02:50:22.227]  Yes, thanks for having me on again, Alex.
[02:50:22.307 --> 02:50:23.448]  I appreciate that.
[02:50:23.648 --> 02:50:24.668]  That's right, you've been on before.
[02:50:24.709 --> 02:50:25.389]  Good to have you back.
[02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:31.253]  Well, basically, the whole thing that's going on is, you know, like,
[02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:51.399]  That was sort of why I think this was sort of leaked because of how like the response was so quick to shoot it down and you know usually like you said it's always you always know that usually means that it was ISIS and the whole thing is that the tape and I know that's pretty much everybody wants the details on the tape and you know I'll share
[02:50:52.534 --> 02:50:52.754]  I think so.
[02:51:10.308 --> 02:51:24.853]  He's telling his little, he's like Romeo to Juliet up in the side of the building, how much he loves it, how he pledges himself, how he pledges things to blood.
[02:51:24.873 --> 02:51:28.895]  And we can put the article and the documents that are in the article, guys, up on screen.
[02:51:28.915 --> 02:51:29.755]  This is totally clear.
[02:51:29.995 --> 02:51:31.376]  They're covering up an ISIS attack.
[02:51:31.396 --> 02:51:31.736]  Continue.
[02:51:33.135 --> 02:51:49.659]  And, um, you know, and that's where a lot of, um, you know, obviously leaks happen for reasons, whether it's, you know, to get the word out there, because, you know, like I said to Paul is, you know, I don't think they'll ever really release the tape, mainly because they don't want to be wrong.
[02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:57.521]  They don't want to really been telling Americans for the last eight years that they have control on this and, you know, that terror cells don't exist in the country.
[02:51:58.494 --> 02:52:08.147]  It's becoming clearer and clearer that these cells do exist, and that's sort of the response to why they haven't really jumped on it or really said much at all.
[02:52:08.888 --> 02:52:11.911]  That's where all the leaks lead to.
[02:52:12.352 --> 02:52:13.734]  There's a lot more details, too.
[02:52:15.075 --> 02:52:20.318]  The whole second shooter thing, he had an accomplice, and you know, there's so much to this story.
[02:52:20.498 --> 02:52:24.441]  And by the way, we were told that by law enforcement day one, and we just reported our source.
[02:52:24.801 --> 02:52:27.963]  The media flipped out and said, you're crazy, there's no such thing, open and shut.
[02:52:28.263 --> 02:52:32.906]  They don't know what happened, but it wasn't Islamic, it wasn't Antifa, there wasn't another shooter.
[02:52:33.786 --> 02:52:35.568]  But meanwhile, that's what I got from law enforcement.
[02:52:35.588 --> 02:52:43.973]  Now we have the video of people a mile away saying they saw cops shooting people in hotels, people jumping on them, piles of shell casings, and then you can hear
[02:52:44.813 --> 02:52:51.922]  Yeah, you know, and that's sort of... That's why it's... I don't really understand why they didn't, uh...
[02:53:02.948 --> 02:53:06.870]  Well, usually Islamic attacks are pretty ham-fisted, even if he was able to pull this off.
[02:53:08.071 --> 02:53:15.936]  Specifics though, because I have sources, and I heard about this before I even saw you this morning, that's why I thought, wow, I'm glad the word's getting out.
[02:53:16.957 --> 02:53:20.199]  There was this pledge, they said on Monday he pledged himself to them.
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:23.962]  But now I was getting this from good intel, that's why the police are so angry.
[02:53:25.319 --> 02:53:26.100]  Why cover it up?
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.824]  I mean, Trump's got the power to have this released, or I guess his agencies are in open rebellion against him.
[02:53:31.384 --> 02:53:34.587]  Why let them use this against America when it's an Islamic attack?
[02:53:34.627 --> 02:53:37.349]  This would absolutely validate everything we're saying.
[02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:38.610]  Look at the target!
[02:53:38.650 --> 02:53:40.312]  I mean, they attacked a country music facility.
[02:53:41.966 --> 02:53:53.814]  I know, it's pretty, you would think that that would be enough to really be like, hey, you know, everything, this policy, this foreign policy, this travel ban, all these things we're trying to do, this is why.
[02:53:53.894 --> 02:54:07.183]  You know, and obviously he was an American, of course, but, you know, if you start bringing over people that potentially are radical, you know, eventually that rubs off on other people, and then you just have that... Well, ISIS has said that that was their mission.
[02:54:09.873 --> 02:54:10.334]  You know?
[02:54:26.414 --> 02:54:35.761]  Um, well, the whole, um, covering up thing, the FBI, you know, they were unaware of, say, profiles under his alias.
[02:54:35.961 --> 02:54:41.705]  But, um, they were given tips that he had some, you know, like, with the ISIS name.
[02:54:42.286 --> 02:54:44.507]  I can't even, I'm not even going to try to attempt to say it.
[02:54:44.687 --> 02:54:45.928]  I can never pronounce it right.
[02:54:46.409 --> 02:54:48.410]  Sure, the police said he was known to them.
[02:54:49.031 --> 02:54:51.552]  And also, we now have the valet entries.
[02:54:51.993 --> 02:54:53.474]  We first broke, Roger carried it.
[02:54:54.537 --> 02:55:01.483]  Was confirmed to be accurate that he was checked in two days before, that he had a woman there visiting him, these hotel food receipts.
[02:55:01.923 --> 02:55:04.886]  Now we have the Infowars.com story by Paul Watson.
[02:55:04.926 --> 02:55:06.447]  Valet entries prove paddock.
[02:55:06.847 --> 02:55:08.809]  Checked in three days before date, given by authorities.
[02:55:09.169 --> 02:55:12.252]  We even have the photo of it by the FBI who put a tag on it.
[02:55:12.672 --> 02:55:15.234]  So the FBI knew this and covered it up.
[02:55:15.274 --> 02:55:15.835]  What do you make of that?
[02:55:17.390 --> 02:55:22.492]  I definitely think that they have their way of covering up everything, especially when they're not ahead of it.
[02:55:22.532 --> 02:55:25.413]  You look at the Sinara brothers.
[02:55:25.533 --> 02:55:26.614]  They knew all about that.
[02:55:26.634 --> 02:55:28.535]  What did they really do?
[02:55:29.695 --> 02:55:31.816]  There's that six-month timeline with this.
[02:55:33.112 --> 02:55:33.853]  We're good to go.
[02:55:49.190 --> 02:56:00.835]  Initiate their their plan and you know people end up dead because you know a lot of times I don't really think that they want to win this war on terror because you know Exactly, that's the dirty side.
[02:56:00.995 --> 02:56:13.519]  Stay there James Brower Jay bro underscore 7076 on Twitter I want to come back and ask you what the next shoe to drop is and what other Intel you've got from inside the White House But this is the same stuff.
[02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:17.101]  I got Monday and Tuesday, and I got more Intel by a high level
[02:56:18.095 --> 02:56:22.578]  Intelligence source today that the crew is witnesses to as well.
[02:56:22.598 --> 02:56:26.140]  But I'm just going to stop right there and I'm not going to tell you what they told me because I'm not allowed to.
[02:56:26.820 --> 02:56:28.681]  But believe me, we're not blowing smoke here.
[02:56:29.061 --> 02:56:35.245]  Everybody knows that is what we keep telling you keeps happening because we're crazy enough to tell you what's really going on.
[02:56:35.725 --> 02:56:36.386]  At least we try.
[02:56:36.426 --> 02:56:37.326]  We don't always get it right.
[02:56:37.346 --> 02:56:39.768]  But we're we're dead on about 95 percent of the time.
[02:56:40.088 --> 02:56:40.868]  And I wish I wouldn't.
[02:56:41.008 --> 02:56:41.669]  I wish I was wrong.
[02:56:42.409 --> 02:56:45.171]  Before we end this hour, I didn't even plug last hour I get so focused.
[02:56:45.451 --> 02:56:51.915]  That's why it's important for you when we do plug to really take it into consideration to financially support the operation and get great products while you're doing it.
[02:56:52.215 --> 02:56:52.816]  A win-win.
[02:56:52.856 --> 02:56:54.497]  You owe it to yourself to support the broadcast.

[02:57:15.930 --> 02:57:17.370]  A bunch of specials are about to end.
[02:57:18.031 --> 02:57:19.872]  The Caveman Bone Broth's gotta end soon.
[02:57:20.172 --> 02:57:22.953]  The new specials, Brain Force, 50% off, great nootropic.
[02:57:23.334 --> 02:57:24.894]  Never done that before, 50% off.
[02:57:25.235 --> 02:57:26.956]  But I thought this would go for like a month or something.
[02:57:26.976 --> 02:57:30.638]  It's gonna end in like a week, because it's selling out so quick, because it's so close to cost.
[02:57:30.998 --> 02:57:32.358]  Brain Force Plus, now 20% more.

[02:57:35.522 --> 02:57:36.263]  Stay with us.
[02:57:36.564 --> 02:57:37.525]  Hour number 4 straight ahead.
[02:57:53.550 --> 02:57:53.930]  Carnivore.
[02:57:53.950 --> 02:57:55.591]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[02:57:56.052 --> 02:57:56.932]  All very affordable.
[02:57:57.853 --> 02:57:58.774]  33% off, out of the gates.
[02:57:58.894 --> 02:58:03.717]  The thing I am so ultra excited about, because I like a high protein diet and I love meat.
[02:58:03.737 --> 02:58:09.701]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[02:58:09.901 --> 02:58:14.564]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[02:58:14.585 --> 02:58:16.486]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and
[02:58:16.946 --> 02:58:22.250]  Stomach aches as you get older and can't eat rich foods you could eat before is because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[02:58:22.290 --> 02:58:24.232]  This is next level beyond probiotic.
[02:58:24.872 --> 02:58:26.053]  I've been taking this for two months.
[02:58:27.154 --> 02:58:30.856]  As it was getting prepared, it was getting ready and man, I'm telling you, it is incredible.
[02:58:31.137 --> 02:58:33.498]  Normally you eat a big steak for a day or two, you're tired.
[02:58:34.019 --> 02:58:35.340]  Doesn't happen anymore with this and
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:41.985]  Never have any issues, you know, eat that 20-ounce ribeye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[02:58:42.065 --> 02:58:45.088]  It's called Carnivore Digestive Enzymes.
[02:58:45.268 --> 02:58:49.632]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion and macronutrients absorption.
[02:58:49.992 --> 02:58:51.534]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[02:58:51.914 --> 02:58:56.378]  People that are on these ketosis diets and Atkins type diets and paleo diets.
[02:58:57.018 --> 02:58:57.979]  It's just amazing.

[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:22.381]  I eat one now, I get tired.
[02:59:22.401 --> 02:59:23.022]  I started taking this.
[02:59:23.582 --> 02:59:23.782]  Boom.
[02:59:23.842 --> 02:59:24.523]  Ate a big rib eye.
[02:59:24.563 --> 02:59:24.823]  Boom.
[02:59:24.863 --> 02:59:25.404]  Eat two of these.
[02:59:25.424 --> 02:59:25.904]  Eat one of these.
[02:59:26.485 --> 02:59:27.165]  It's incredible.
[02:59:27.205 --> 02:59:28.126]  Digest it better.
[02:59:28.286 --> 02:59:29.227]  Aren't tired the next day.
[02:59:29.287 --> 02:59:30.027]  Don't get heartburn.
[02:59:30.047 --> 02:59:30.548]  Don't get stomachache.
[02:59:30.828 --> 02:59:34.491]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive enzyme.
[02:59:34.531 --> 02:59:36.633]  So Carnivore is next level.
[02:59:36.733 --> 02:59:38.174]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:38.274 --> 02:59:39.155]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:39.175 --> 02:59:42.758]  It's the big umbrella site, but Infowarslife.com takes you right to it.
[02:59:43.058 --> 02:59:43.738]  Carnivore.
[02:59:43.899 --> 02:59:44.899]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:46.541]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:46.621 --> 02:59:46.761]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:56.255 --> 02:59:56.776]  Here we are.
[02:59:56.796 --> 02:59:58.137]  Tuesday, November 21st, 2017.
[02:59:58.217 --> 02:59:59.979]  This year's come and almost gone.
[03:00:00.840 --> 03:00:01.521]  It's like a whirlwind.
[03:00:18.160 --> 03:00:35.251]  It's been a little over a year since President Trump became president-elect, since we defeated the fake media, the controlled corporate press, since we began the process of restoring our republic, since we began to rekindle our spirits again and not let the globalists break our will.
[03:00:36.672 --> 03:00:38.614]  But make no mistake, this is metaphysical.
[03:00:39.034 --> 03:00:39.794]  This is spiritual.
[03:00:41.055 --> 03:00:43.357]  The globalists are social engineers who lust
[03:00:44.838 --> 03:00:51.961]  After dominating and controlling people and breaking their will, breaking their cultures, and turning them into zombies.
[03:00:53.282 --> 03:01:12.871]  It is very exhilarating and very exciting, but also paradoxical, that when I see listeners of my television show or my radio show, the simulcast, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, they have light in their eyes, they're excited, they're involved.
[03:01:14.312 --> 03:01:15.173]  They are alive.
[03:01:16.294 --> 03:01:29.009]  And then when I see people that either aren't politically awake or aware, or are political enemies, you cannot overestimate how slob-like, zombie-like, and enslaved they are.
[03:01:30.330 --> 03:01:34.274]  It truly is sad to see the majority of people under globalist control
[03:01:35.956 --> 03:01:41.821]  Being shiftless, hateful, vicious, desperate, lost individuals.
[03:01:42.381 --> 03:01:57.394]  Now there's a small percentage of those that serve globalism that are totally conscious of it and are just very mercenary when it comes to following the central engineer's blueprint.
[03:01:58.914 --> 03:02:09.285]  That said, though, I don't get out in public a ton, but I recently, a few days ago, took my mother-in-law and my family to the shopping mall.
[03:02:09.305 --> 03:02:10.025]  It was a nice day.
[03:02:10.045 --> 03:02:14.870]  It was an open-air mall called The Domain here in Austin, Texas.
[03:02:14.890 --> 03:02:15.972]  We went to three stores.
[03:02:16.152 --> 03:02:17.253]  We were only there about an hour and a half.
[03:02:18.875 --> 03:02:20.496]  I guess one restaurant, so four places.
[03:02:20.796 --> 03:02:21.898]  So I guess count in the restaurant about
[03:02:25.017 --> 03:02:25.698]  Three and a half hours.
[03:02:26.538 --> 03:02:29.200]  And I ran into so many listeners and so many fans.
[03:02:29.361 --> 03:02:32.984]  It was very, very humbling because they had so much electricity in their eyes.
[03:02:33.984 --> 03:02:44.413]  And in one of the shops I went in, both the women that owned the shop were fans and listeners, but they were taking action.
[03:02:44.813 --> 03:02:47.355]  They've been visiting family and friends out in Oregon.
[03:02:48.809 --> 03:03:00.978]  During the election last year, they plastered the town, they said they had a few drinks to make it even more fun, plastered the town at night with over 500 Hillary for Prison stickers that also have Infowars.com on them.
[03:03:01.439 --> 03:03:02.780]  I thought, well that's amazing, thank you.
[03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:14.008]  So I bought a jacket vest that I was in there getting, and I went on down the street and ran into a really nice Hispanic couple who
[03:03:15.229 --> 03:03:17.850]  Also told me about how they put InfoWare stickers up in Austin.
[03:03:18.291 --> 03:03:19.091]  How much fun they had.
[03:03:19.511 --> 03:03:21.152]  Then I ran into another Hispanic couple.
[03:03:22.132 --> 03:03:27.495]  This guy's made an amazing app called the InfoWare that I just discovered again a few days ago.
[03:03:28.115 --> 03:03:28.756]  That's amazing.
[03:03:29.736 --> 03:03:31.257]  I might be working with him on some stuff.
[03:03:31.297 --> 03:03:41.582]  It was just it was just crazy how many of the people were so optimistic but were also taking action and knew that they were part of something historical.
[03:03:42.443 --> 03:03:43.484]  And look, Trump's not perfect.
[03:03:43.504 --> 03:03:44.025]  I'm not perfect.
[03:03:44.045 --> 03:03:44.586]  You're not perfect.
[03:03:44.606 --> 03:03:46.928]  But we've turned the corner on globalism.
[03:03:47.148 --> 03:03:50.853]  You know the New World Order is upset by the way they're behaving.
[03:03:51.233 --> 03:03:52.454]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[03:03:52.494 --> 03:03:53.816]  So it's Thanksgiving approaches.
[03:03:54.196 --> 03:03:55.838]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you out there.
[03:03:55.858 --> 03:03:59.282]  I'm very, very thankful for all of our affiliates, our sponsors, everybody else.
[03:04:00.303 --> 03:04:12.251]  And just in closing here before we come back with the broadcast, I just wanted to say that we have Black Friday, Cyber Monday specials that are extended right into next week.
[03:04:12.651 --> 03:04:17.134]  But a lot of these sales are only one day only because we have limited supplies or while supplies last.
[03:04:17.535 --> 03:04:25.160]  So all the specials of yesterday, Brain Force 50% off and 25% off Pro Pure super high quality water filters, that is extending today.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:26.081]  I think so.
[03:04:45.061 --> 03:04:45.321]  I think?
[03:05:07.807 --> 03:05:08.688]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[03:05:09.048 --> 03:05:11.389]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[03:05:11.669 --> 03:05:14.451]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[03:05:14.691 --> 03:05:20.494]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:20.794 --> 03:05:27.298]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide and clearly the biggest sales in our history.
[03:05:27.458 --> 03:05:29.580]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.
[03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:33.322]  We've got our new troping, RainForce, 50% off.
[03:05:33.542 --> 03:05:35.483]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[03:05:35.723 --> 03:05:36.003]  We're good.
[03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:25.382]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:26.582 --> 03:06:31.304]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:32.265 --> 03:06:39.828]  And Mike Cernovich hosting this hour, and we've got a special guest in studio, but he's in the shadows over there, just like Drudge did two years ago.
[03:06:40.588 --> 03:06:42.369]  He's been a friend of the show for four or five years.
[03:06:43.850 --> 03:06:45.991]  And I've met him before.
[03:06:46.031 --> 03:06:47.332]  He's friends with some of the crew here.
[03:06:47.732 --> 03:06:48.813]  He's a fellow Austinite.
[03:06:48.853 --> 03:06:50.114]  His business is pretty close to here.
[03:06:50.134 --> 03:06:58.760]  And I've got a shot for TV viewers of where he was at the Country Music Festival right up towards the right-hand side of the stage.
[03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:00.561]  And so he is here.
[03:07:01.994 --> 03:07:30.881]  with us right now to break down some of the things he witnessed because the reports are there's two shooters and we already played video last night and there's countless videos of folks at other hotels saying there were shell casings people shot cops you can hear off the distance that up close bam bam bam bam at Mandalay Bay so I'm we're just gonna call this fellow David a friend of mine David please tell folks exactly what you witnessed and what you saw here and thanks for all you do thank you
[03:07:32.239 --> 03:07:34.520]  We were on the right side of the stage.
[03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:40.103]  We were in the, as close as you could get to the musician's area, in the VIP section.
[03:07:40.123 --> 03:07:41.263]  They call it the Neon Lounge.
[03:07:41.303 --> 03:07:44.905]  It was about a hundred yard section where there was an elevated VIP.
[03:07:44.925 --> 03:07:47.246]  It was that white tent that I think you've seen in some of the videos.
[03:07:47.927 --> 03:07:54.750]  And then closer to the musician's side were, you know, air-conditioned toilets, porta-potties that were on trailers.
[03:07:55.330 --> 03:07:57.832]  There's three on one side, one on the other, and then there was a bar.
[03:07:58.732 --> 03:07:59.253]  We're good to go.
[03:08:21.802 --> 03:08:29.804]  The musicians' trailers that went back towards the strip, they were lined up against that fence.
[03:08:31.564 --> 03:08:40.506]  We were as close as you can get in the general admission section, and it's just packed, wall-to-wall people from us to the stage, as far as you can see, all around there.
[03:08:42.106 --> 03:08:49.308]  We're watching, you know, it's halfway through Jason Aldean's show, and you hear a pop, pop, pop, pop.
[03:08:50.114 --> 03:08:52.917]  And it's that one that's in the distance, I believe.
[03:08:53.297 --> 03:08:56.120]  And somebody says, oh, there's fireworks.
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:01.645]  And I turn around and I'm looking and we're as close as you can get to the corner of Mandalay Bay Road and Flamingo.
[03:09:01.665 --> 03:09:07.891]  So we're as close as you can get to where the eventual shooter was from.
[03:09:08.553 --> 03:09:10.954]  But in the beginning, you hear that pop, pop, pop, and it's in the distance.
[03:09:11.334 --> 03:09:14.516]  And I've got to admit, I've never heard gunfire coming at me.
[03:09:14.596 --> 03:09:15.336]  I shoot a lot of guns.
[03:09:15.376 --> 03:09:15.976]  We have ARs.
[03:09:15.996 --> 03:09:16.877]  We have all kinds of guns.
[03:09:16.957 --> 03:09:18.357]  And my family, we shoot.
[03:09:18.457 --> 03:09:20.898]  And so I know what the guns sound like going away.
[03:09:20.958 --> 03:09:23.319]  But coming at you, it's a whole different world.
[03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:26.801]  But the first rounds were not coming at us.
[03:09:26.841 --> 03:09:27.982]  They were going in different directions.
[03:09:28.082 --> 03:09:33.064]  And I assume that when they were shooting, somebody was shooting over at the tanks at some point.
[03:09:33.124 --> 03:09:36.845]  And that was probably in the beginning, trying to blow those up, as they've come out and said.
[03:09:38.812 --> 03:09:42.456]  But my first reaction when I looked back was, OK, it stopped.
[03:09:42.476 --> 03:09:43.117]  There's nothing there.
[03:09:43.157 --> 03:09:45.440]  That was probably just something, some anomaly.
[03:09:45.780 --> 03:09:49.064]  I look back and Aldean plays for another 10 seconds and then I see.
[03:09:51.019 --> 03:09:55.841]  A spark come off the right screen where, uh, where we were is a weird angle.
[03:09:55.881 --> 03:09:57.021]  You couldn't always see the stage.
[03:09:57.061 --> 03:09:58.601]  So we're kind of looking at the screen.
[03:09:58.641 --> 03:10:05.564]  I see a spark come off top of the screen and the next round of volley comes through and it's a round of over 40, 50 rounds.
[03:10:05.624 --> 03:10:07.064]  It's probably close to 100 rounds.
[03:10:07.844 --> 03:10:13.806]  Uh, now as I listened to some of the sound, I mean some of the replays from people, but at the time you're just not cognizant of it.
[03:10:13.846 --> 03:10:15.447]  You're just like, wait, that's real.
[03:10:16.187 --> 03:10:16.307]  And
[03:10:17.299 --> 03:10:20.746]  Uh, my wife and our friends are, uh, you know, we're up against the gate.
[03:10:21.166 --> 03:10:25.875]  The divider, the metal divider, which is one of the dividers they ended up using for, to carry people out.
[03:10:26.876 --> 03:10:27.956]  We're up against that divider.
[03:10:28.116 --> 03:10:34.178]  We turn around, I turn around, I see somebody duck behind one of the porta-potties, and they're about 12 foot tall on top of those trailers.
[03:10:34.818 --> 03:10:44.101]  And I'm still hearing sounds, and my first reaction is, you know, there's a drug shootout, a gang shootout at the Mandalay Bay, because it sounds, there's overlapping fire.
[03:10:44.441 --> 03:10:47.722]  And when people say there was multiple shooters, it sounded like multiple shooters.
[03:10:48.182 --> 03:10:53.043]  Granted, there's echoes going off of a 45 degree angle off the Luxor and off the different
[03:10:56.296 --> 03:11:01.180]  Sure, but I mean, I've had the former head of SEAL Team 6, I've had them all on, they hear it, it's not echoes.
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:10.767]  And then you've got the cab videos and others where it's ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
[03:11:20.194 --> 03:11:25.084]  Yeah, after the first two or three minutes there's only one shooter and it's coming over our head into the area behind us.
[03:11:25.144 --> 03:11:26.166]  We're on that right side.
[03:11:26.186 --> 03:11:28.570]  Because you're up under the stage and he's got to shoot over you.
[03:11:29.372 --> 03:11:32.213]  No, we're on the right side, closest to Mandalay Bay.
[03:11:32.533 --> 03:11:33.753]  Sure, right here, so you're open.
[03:11:34.073 --> 03:11:41.014]  The people that were on the left-hand side of the stage, looking at the stage on the left-hand side, those are the ones who stayed longer and stayed down from what I've seen in the videos.
[03:11:41.034 --> 03:11:46.616]  But the people behind us, they're the ones... So you were here over on the right, and it's shooting down towards you this way?
[03:11:46.656 --> 03:11:48.816]  Yeah, we're the closest you can get to his field of fire.
[03:11:48.916 --> 03:11:50.496]  And then the other folks are over here?
[03:11:50.917 --> 03:11:51.737]  Yeah.
[03:11:51.777 --> 03:11:52.757]  So most of the dead were in here?
[03:11:53.467 --> 03:11:57.189]  Most of the dead were in that right side section, so there was a divider coming out of the middle of the stage.
[03:11:57.229 --> 03:12:10.196]  There's a catwalk for the musicians to run out through the middle, and then all of the power cords that ran to the sound guys and the light guys, they were probably 50 yards out into the middle of the field, and it was divided right side, left side.
[03:12:10.336 --> 03:12:11.697]  Well, we've played the video a lot.
[03:12:11.717 --> 03:12:14.238]  We've got Mike Cernovich co-hosting here, but stay with us some more.
[03:12:14.278 --> 03:12:15.538]  He's got a lot of other issues to cover.
[03:12:15.878 --> 03:12:18.920]  And Paul Watson, because we're not a cult here, he doesn't disagree with me.
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:22.821]  He just says multiple shooters is a distraction from the whole ISIS narrative.
[03:12:23.641 --> 03:12:30.024]  All I'm saying is, I've seen the videos where there's shots 45 seconds apart, clearly different firearms.
[03:12:30.304 --> 03:12:31.825]  Top experts have seen this.
[03:12:32.205 --> 03:12:34.766]  Mike Cernovich, what do you think about this whole situation?
[03:12:36.267 --> 03:12:39.308]  Yeah, I'm with... I know what you're doing.
[03:12:40.129 --> 03:12:44.513]  And what you're doing is you always analyze issues from every perspective.
[03:12:45.254 --> 03:12:47.896]  The thing now, though, is you are like the Yankees.
[03:12:48.097 --> 03:12:50.979]  You have hosted the President of the United States of America.
[03:12:51.660 --> 03:12:59.908]  So even when investigating stories, you have to be very, very careful now because you are at the level of the Washington Post, the New York Times.
[03:13:00.208 --> 03:13:00.548]  Sure, sure.
[03:13:19.046 --> 03:13:22.548]  What do you overall make, though, just of this whole situation?
[03:13:22.628 --> 03:13:31.033]  Clearly, when they come out day one and say, no Islamic connection, when they say they don't know what happened, but no Islamic connection, and he acted alone, then the Sheriff's Department contradicts all that.
[03:13:31.493 --> 03:13:32.814]  Sernovich, what are your sources saying?
[03:13:33.871 --> 03:13:40.077]  Well, the New York Times, the reporter for the New York Times had even said that you should not dismiss the ISIS connection, actually.
[03:13:40.497 --> 03:13:47.424]  A very well-respected reporter on terrorism did a lengthy Twitter essay on why you can't just dismiss the ISIS.
[03:13:47.444 --> 03:13:47.905]  Yeah, I saw that.
[03:13:47.945 --> 03:13:49.106]  That's because they know what's coming.
[03:13:50.290 --> 03:13:58.936]  So I think that anybody who's not looking into the ISIS connection, remember, ISIS doesn't take credits for attacks for any old random attack.
[03:13:59.296 --> 03:14:04.040]  They only take credit for attacks that they've actually done and that they've been responsible for.
[03:14:04.340 --> 03:14:08.583]  So when people are dismissing the ISIS angle right away, I'm thinking, no, no, no.
[03:14:08.763 --> 03:14:09.524]  You know, what are you doing?
[03:14:09.844 --> 03:14:11.165]  But here's what I want to know, Alex.
[03:14:12.025 --> 03:14:15.588]  Why is it if I'm with Las Vegas at a blackjack table,
[03:14:16.764 --> 03:14:19.866]  And I shake your hand, and you give me a nickel.
[03:14:20.406 --> 03:14:21.447]  That's caught on camera.
[03:14:22.347 --> 03:14:29.611]  So, why don't we have any footage of people helping him load the guns, the weapons, the people who came and saw?
[03:14:29.631 --> 03:14:30.071]  Exactly.
[03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:35.674]  If they know you're counting cards at a blackjack table, how on earth do they not know 23 guns, thousands of rounds of ammo?
[03:14:36.014 --> 03:14:37.195]  That really is the big issue.
[03:14:38.072 --> 03:14:41.656]  Yeah, I think now it's up to 40 guns, 23 long rifles.
[03:14:42.257 --> 03:14:49.064]  If you do the math, he had over 300 pounds of equipment, weapons, firearms and everything.
[03:14:49.385 --> 03:14:52.368]  So I want to know why is Mandalay Bay not released that footage?
[03:14:52.388 --> 03:14:55.832]  And it turns out they are a bunch of SJWs hooked in with the Islamicists.
[03:14:56.772 --> 03:15:06.675]  Well, if it were, that's the issue, is if there were an Islamic terrorist connection that would be buried by the Mandalay Bay, they wouldn't want that to get out there.
[03:15:06.775 --> 03:15:08.696]  Otherwise, you just release the footage, right?
[03:15:09.076 --> 03:15:09.916]  We're going to break.
[03:15:10.016 --> 03:15:10.456]  Stay there.
[03:15:10.476 --> 03:15:13.277]  Mike Cernovich, Ed Cernovich on Twitter, going to break.
[03:15:13.297 --> 03:15:18.719]  Just in 30 seconds, David, one of the survivors, you and your wife, what do you think of this first approximation?
[03:15:21.861 --> 03:15:24.004]  There definitely were multiple shooters.
[03:15:24.024 --> 03:15:24.765]  There had to be.
[03:15:24.845 --> 03:15:27.688]  There's no way that you had the overlapping shooting.
[03:15:28.109 --> 03:15:34.356]  I don't know about everything else that's come out, but what we heard and what we saw
[03:15:35.440 --> 03:15:38.122]  Uh, that first two or three minutes.
[03:15:38.342 --> 03:15:39.283]  A person knows an echo.
[03:15:39.443 --> 03:15:39.924]  Echo!
[03:15:40.284 --> 03:15:40.564]  Echo!
[03:15:40.664 --> 03:15:40.904]  Echo!
[03:15:40.964 --> 03:15:41.865]  Ricola!
[03:15:42.165 --> 03:15:42.946]  Ricola!
[03:15:43.046 --> 03:15:43.366]  Exactly.
[03:15:43.727 --> 03:15:51.532]  Uh, you know, uh, no, uh, call it... I mean, you can hear, you can hear a heavier belt gun.
[03:15:51.913 --> 03:15:53.874]  You hear some other guns that are firing 30-round mags.
[03:15:53.914 --> 03:15:54.495]  That's what I hear.
[03:15:54.855 --> 03:15:57.977]  And that's what the best soldiers in the world tell me.
[03:15:58.197 --> 03:15:59.578]  But I get what Cernovich is saying.
[03:16:00.139 --> 03:16:02.641]  That becomes a distraction of the overall ISIS...
[03:16:04.158 --> 03:16:10.863]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[03:16:11.644 --> 03:16:13.785]  By studying what they fear.
[03:16:14.486 --> 03:16:16.307]  They fear families living together.
[03:16:16.347 --> 03:16:19.269]  They fear people loving God.
[03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:23.993]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[03:16:25.294 --> 03:16:32.539]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[03:16:34.522 --> 03:16:40.947]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[03:16:42.528 --> 03:16:48.633]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[03:16:49.514 --> 03:17:02.624]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, and it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[03:17:03.621 --> 03:17:10.207]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[03:17:11.488 --> 03:17:19.255]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[03:17:20.997 --> 03:17:22.178]  And so many things will happen.
[03:17:23.379 --> 03:17:24.360]  We are the majority.
[03:17:25.270 --> 03:17:34.019]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:40.186]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[03:17:41.633 --> 03:17:44.075]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[03:17:44.915 --> 03:17:53.100]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[03:17:53.801 --> 03:18:00.165]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[03:18:02.026 --> 03:18:02.927]  So many people write me.
[03:18:03.755 --> 03:18:12.002]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[03:18:12.742 --> 03:18:14.344]  We have to fly our flag.
[03:18:15.339 --> 03:18:16.800]  We have to wear our colors.
[03:18:17.081 --> 03:18:21.745]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:22.406 --> 03:18:25.268]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[03:18:25.489 --> 03:18:36.739]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:39.002]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:18:39.542 --> 03:18:41.723]  And the Lock Her Up Hillary For Prison shirt.
[03:18:42.064 --> 03:18:44.425]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[03:18:44.825 --> 03:18:51.490]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:56.633]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[03:18:57.513 --> 03:19:04.497]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[03:19:04.837 --> 03:19:07.819]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[03:19:08.179 --> 03:19:25.188]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarStore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarStore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[03:19:25.948 --> 03:19:34.715]  I'm Alex Jones and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth and for justice.
[03:19:35.376 --> 03:19:40.039]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[03:19:40.079 --> 03:19:51.949]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:54.991]  So please, from myself and my family and the
[03:19:55.051 --> 03:19:56.772]  Amazing crew here at InfoWars.
[03:19:57.112 --> 03:19:58.533]  Thank you for all you've done.
[03:19:58.913 --> 03:20:00.474]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:20:06.998 --> 03:20:11.141]  You know I gotta say it as we send out this SOS, Alex Jones here back live.
[03:20:13.122 --> 03:20:15.204]  I'm sitting here with David who I've known four or five years.
[03:20:16.685 --> 03:20:19.546]  And he's a nice, smart, entrepreneur, patriot here in Austin.
[03:20:20.506 --> 03:20:24.847]  And he's not giving his full name or getting out there in the light because he didn't want any repercussions.
[03:20:25.587 --> 03:20:30.048]  But as conservatives or patriots, we don't make a big deal out of things.
[03:20:30.128 --> 03:20:32.528]  But he literally was in the main fire area.
[03:20:32.548 --> 03:20:34.288]  People getting shot all around him with his wife.
[03:20:35.108 --> 03:20:37.869]  And he was talking about just the sound of those bullets coming right by his head.
[03:20:37.909 --> 03:20:41.130]  Just hear them where you feel it come by.
[03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:42.870]  It has like a wave in front of it.
[03:20:44.144 --> 03:20:50.607]  The difference between seeing people, you know, in shootouts on television or movies and actually being in it, and the way he's just calm.
[03:20:50.627 --> 03:20:52.468]  It's not like Dr. Phil or Oprah.
[03:20:52.488 --> 03:20:55.090]  He's crying and we're going to him and his lips shaking.
[03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:57.491]  He's just a patriot in here telling you what went on.
[03:20:58.151 --> 03:21:02.874]  But regardless, this appears to be an ISIS attack and that's what our sources are telling us.
[03:21:03.634 --> 03:21:06.796]  That's what Mike Cernovich is saying the investigation is leading towards.
[03:21:07.096 --> 03:21:08.777]  We know the FBI covered it up.
[03:21:09.477 --> 03:21:20.548]  We know now it's coming out, it's on Infowars.com, that we have him checked in days before, we have the valet, we have the parking stubs, we have the food being bought.
[03:21:20.568 --> 03:21:21.569]  That's all confirmed now.
[03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:23.852]  So we've got him day one saying it's not Islamic.
[03:21:24.943 --> 03:21:27.986]  We've got him day one saying that he checked in a wrong day.
[03:21:28.286 --> 03:21:30.488]  There's clearly a cover up here, Mike Cernovich.
[03:21:31.009 --> 03:21:32.290]  What do you think's behind this?
[03:21:32.370 --> 03:21:35.894]  And why would they want to cover up if it is indeed an ISIS attack?
[03:21:35.914 --> 03:21:39.717]  Because the target, the motive, the history, the connections, ISIS taking credit.
[03:21:39.757 --> 03:21:40.818]  I mean, this is hiding in plain view.
[03:21:41.079 --> 03:21:46.444]  The left's already busy blaming conservatives, liberals, gun owners, America.
[03:21:46.804 --> 03:21:49.507]  But then we're not supposed to speculate when the facts are pretty clear.
[03:21:50.749 --> 03:21:57.816]  Oh, well, let me segue to a horrific story from the New Republic that I sent, you know, Nico and the great crew.
[03:21:58.216 --> 03:22:04.642]  The New Republic is claiming that Gavin McInnes and I celebrated the Las Vegas shooting.
[03:22:05.522 --> 03:22:07.724]  This is, I sent him the screen cap to link it.
[03:22:07.804 --> 03:22:08.665]  Let's put it on screen.
[03:22:08.705 --> 03:22:10.507]  But I mean, that's a fiction publication.
[03:22:10.967 --> 03:22:15.872]  When that publication is not calling for overthrowing the president, I guess they're putting this stuff out.
[03:22:16.912 --> 03:22:19.233]  Yeah, and that's how desperate the media is.
[03:22:19.253 --> 03:22:20.214]  What was the name of the headline?
[03:22:20.234 --> 03:22:22.254]  I'll get them to search it if they missed it.
[03:22:22.775 --> 03:22:29.918]  Okay, they say, um, Alt-Light Celebrating Las Vegas Shooting is the headline.
[03:22:29.938 --> 03:22:32.859]  But that's the CBS Vice President and all the Hollywood stars.
[03:22:33.199 --> 03:22:33.880]  That's not us.
[03:22:35.134 --> 03:22:38.576]  Yeah, why the alt-light celebrated the Las Vegas massacre.
[03:22:39.157 --> 03:22:52.066]  When I saw this, Alex, you know, I'm used to being lied about repeatedly and very rarely do I read something that makes my stomach churn where I think, how could they do this?
[03:22:52.546 --> 03:22:52.746]  Right?
[03:22:52.786 --> 03:22:58.050]  To show that any of us would celebrate this or to claim that Gavin McInnes supports this
[03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:59.651]  This is the New Republic.
[03:22:59.671 --> 03:23:01.913]  That used to be the publication for Bill Clinton.
[03:23:01.953 --> 03:23:02.494]  Remember that?
[03:23:02.934 --> 03:23:08.059]  That was the official publication that Bill Clinton would read on Air Force One was the New Republic.
[03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:10.382]  Celebrating... Where's the actual quote?
[03:23:10.442 --> 03:23:10.922]  I'm reading it.
[03:23:10.942 --> 03:23:12.103]  I don't see you guys saying that.
[03:23:12.964 --> 03:23:13.385]  Well, no.
[03:23:13.405 --> 03:23:15.847]  The idea that we would is, of course, appalling.
[03:23:16.556 --> 03:23:22.740]  But that is how desperate they are to distract from Islamic terrorism that now they're just outright fabricating.
[03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:24.241]  Oh, well, they celebrated.
[03:23:24.481 --> 03:23:27.703]  First of all, the alt-light is a term created by neo-Nazis.
[03:23:28.083 --> 03:23:31.345]  So anybody who actually uses the term alt-light... Yeah, you've always been critical.
[03:23:31.365 --> 03:23:33.586]  You've never been said you're part of it, and they say you are.
[03:23:33.886 --> 03:23:34.587]  That's a Hillary term.
[03:23:34.607 --> 03:23:36.488]  You're going to come back and host the rest of the show in a moment.
[03:23:37.288 --> 03:23:42.470]  I want to get your full breakdown on this, Mike Cernovich, but first off, just getting back to the loose ends.
[03:23:42.850 --> 03:23:47.892]  We have videos of people at other facilities saying the cops are there, bullets, people shot.
[03:23:48.212 --> 03:23:49.632]  I think this was a much larger attack.
[03:23:49.652 --> 03:23:52.753]  That's what I've got from my sources that are very, very high level.
[03:23:54.054 --> 03:23:55.174]  This is going to come out.
[03:23:55.314 --> 03:23:59.936]  What is the left going to do when it begins to come out, I believe, if it comes out as Islamic terror?
[03:23:59.976 --> 03:24:00.636]  David, what do you think?
[03:24:02.872 --> 03:24:08.335]  If it is, I mean, it's incredible if it comes out that it is, and they're holding that back.
[03:24:08.375 --> 03:24:09.216]  That's crazy.
[03:24:09.396 --> 03:24:17.440]  I mean, it's, you know, real quick, one thing I just want to say is, had that not been the crowd it was, there would have been far more deaths.
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:23.423]  And you really have to thank, and thank God, that the people that were there were, I'd say 20 or 30 percent of them were former active.
[03:24:24.079 --> 03:24:26.800]  We're active duty or, you know, veterans that were in there.
[03:24:26.900 --> 03:24:28.700]  And then you had a ton of first responders in there.
[03:24:29.260 --> 03:24:31.900]  And they, you know, they knew how to react in that situation.
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:32.701]  You know, I didn't.
[03:24:32.901 --> 03:24:33.241]  We didn't.
[03:24:34.601 --> 03:24:40.602]  And, you know, you would have seen a lot more deaths in that scenario if that wasn't the crowd that was there.
[03:24:40.902 --> 03:24:42.942]  I just, it's... What type of things did you see?
[03:24:42.962 --> 03:24:43.923]  Just the way they were rendering aid?
[03:24:43.943 --> 03:24:44.863]  The way they went to cover?
[03:24:44.883 --> 03:24:47.143]  A lot of folks started running towards the building, I know?
[03:24:47.323 --> 03:24:49.544]  We were there with friends who were first responders.
[03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:50.144]  And when we
[03:24:52.003 --> 03:24:57.927]  We went and took cover underneath the port-a-potty, the toilet trailer, and the bullets are coming over.
[03:24:57.967 --> 03:25:07.132]  It went on for seven minutes, and our friend said, look, people are going under the bleachers of the neon lounge, the VIP lounge area.
[03:25:07.733 --> 03:25:12.315]  So my wife and I ran across there while they were still shooting and made our way down that direction.
[03:25:12.435 --> 03:25:13.476]  Our friends were going to follow us.
[03:25:13.536 --> 03:25:13.916]  They didn't.
[03:25:14.417 --> 03:25:14.877]  They stayed.
[03:25:14.917 --> 03:25:21.081]  He carried multiple people out afterwards, he told us, and they used the fencing to carry people out.
[03:25:21.981 --> 03:25:26.844]  The first responders, the police on the ground, I mean, everybody was pretty amazing on how they dealt with it.
[03:25:26.864 --> 03:25:29.626]  And these are the people, you know, really doing this hard work.
[03:25:29.646 --> 03:25:33.348]  Meanwhile, the NFL takes a knee during the time to honor them.
[03:25:33.668 --> 03:25:35.529]  Yeah, I mean, it's a shame.
[03:25:35.749 --> 03:25:37.410]  You survived this with your family.
[03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:40.252]  Any other pieces of info you'd like to impart to folks?
[03:25:41.173 --> 03:25:42.834]  I've known you for a while.
[03:25:42.854 --> 03:25:45.035]  People would have told me five years ago when I first met you.
[03:25:45.335 --> 03:25:46.496]  You've done some work for us.
[03:25:46.516 --> 03:25:48.077]  You've done some nice things for the operation.
[03:25:48.297 --> 03:25:49.157]  Just out of the goodness of your heart.
[03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:54.240]  If I'd have thought we'd be having a discussion of you surviving a mass terror attack, it's just, it's Twilight Zone.
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:55.601]  Yeah, it is.
[03:25:55.681 --> 03:25:57.121]  I mean, it was surreal when it happened.
[03:25:57.141 --> 03:26:03.385]  Until you have a gun fired at you, you don't know how you respond and you don't know what it is.
[03:26:03.705 --> 03:26:05.406]  People were screaming and crying and everything.
[03:26:05.786 --> 03:26:07.107]  Just pray for all the victims.
[03:26:07.167 --> 03:26:07.607]  Pray for the
[03:26:08.177 --> 03:26:09.297]  For the families of the victims.
[03:26:09.358 --> 03:26:10.238]  I mean, those people.
[03:26:10.278 --> 03:26:10.698]  And donate.
[03:26:10.738 --> 03:26:11.558]  Donate to the victims.
[03:26:11.618 --> 03:26:12.999]  I mean, the funds that are out there.
[03:26:13.959 --> 03:26:20.422]  I think there's a GoFundMe site that... I notice none of them are out there saying take somebody else's rights out of this.
[03:26:20.442 --> 03:26:22.123]  They're just such good people.
[03:26:22.343 --> 03:26:22.603]  They are.
[03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:25.004]  You know, we've got the war room coming up.
[03:26:25.144 --> 03:26:28.926]  And if you've got more to say, I'd love to have them... I have one more thing.
[03:26:29.046 --> 03:26:35.408]  Real quick, I would like to say is, you know, one of the officers that were there were doing their best with what they had.
[03:26:35.428 --> 03:26:37.009]  Most of those guys were only carrying sidearms.
[03:26:37.769 --> 03:26:42.012]  And, you know, they're trying to defend people against somebody using long arms.
[03:26:42.072 --> 03:26:45.974]  Even if you had a rifle, I don't know if I'd have been shooting at the hotel because I might miss and shoot somebody else.
[03:26:46.414 --> 03:26:50.016]  I mean, what do you do when you're 600 yards away, even if you see the muzzle flash?
[03:26:50.056 --> 03:26:50.696]  I'm a good shot.
[03:26:50.737 --> 03:26:51.997]  I can shoot bullseye at 400 yards.
[03:26:52.377 --> 03:26:54.559]  But, I mean, I don't think I could make that shot at 600 yards.
[03:26:54.779 --> 03:27:02.963]  Where we were at that closest corner, if you saw the video where the policemen who were hunched down behind that mason wall, the block wall, we were 30 yards behind them.
[03:27:04.384 --> 03:27:08.326]  And at that point, I think you're about 250 to that window, and 250 yards.
[03:27:09.047 --> 03:27:10.367]  But nobody had a long gun over there.
[03:27:10.407 --> 03:27:13.469]  Long guns were on the back side in the trucks, on the back side of the venue.
[03:27:14.069 --> 03:27:21.613]  And the other thing is, MGM owns that ground underneath that concert, and MGM owns Mandalay Bay too, right?
[03:27:22.513 --> 03:27:24.795]  And there's all the weird Islamic connections.
[03:27:27.156 --> 03:27:29.057]  Yeah, it's a little too strange.
[03:27:29.602 --> 03:27:30.563]  Well, this is powerful.
[03:27:30.663 --> 03:27:32.344]  So we've got another three-hour show coming up.
[03:27:32.544 --> 03:27:34.486]  If we could, while you're here, I need you to go run your businesses.
[03:27:34.906 --> 03:27:40.531]  If you want to get with one of the folks and have them just audio record any other points you'd like to make, we'd like to air it on The War Room.
[03:27:40.551 --> 03:27:41.392]  Thank you so much, David.
[03:27:41.412 --> 03:27:42.232]  We're glad you survived.
[03:27:42.272 --> 03:27:42.653]  Thank God.
[03:27:42.673 --> 03:27:50.199]  All right, I'm going to turn this over to Mike Cernovich at Cernovich on Twitter, a great investigative journalist, filmmaker in his own right.
[03:27:50.219 --> 03:27:51.600]  Thanks for letting me crowd in on you today.
[03:27:51.620 --> 03:27:52.861]  It's hard to get you to host a show.
[03:27:52.881 --> 03:27:55.003]  You're a busy guy, but it's good to have you here.
[03:27:56.404 --> 03:27:58.766]  So tell us what's coming up in the next 30 minutes when you host.
[03:28:00.031 --> 03:28:05.737]  Well, very, very, very important for people to know that Alex Jones was right.
[03:28:06.177 --> 03:28:18.330]  And the Hollywood casting couch, the sex trafficking, the abuse of women, the sexual predators, Harvey Weinstein, nobody was more connected to Democrats than Harvey Weinstein.
[03:28:18.350 --> 03:28:20.232]  So before you go, I have a quick question for you.
[03:28:21.013 --> 03:28:29.983]  Why did Barack Obama, who took millions of dollars from Harvey Weinstein, send his own daughter to interview with Weinstein, knowing Weinstein is a sexual predator?
[03:28:31.265 --> 03:28:33.848]  I don't think those daughters are really his daughters from people we know.
[03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:34.989]  They're just cut out beards.
[03:28:35.370 --> 03:28:36.831]  I'm not against Obama that he's gay.
[03:28:37.472 --> 03:28:41.176]  It's just that him and his whole fake relationship is a fiction.
[03:28:41.196 --> 03:28:41.617]  What do you think?
[03:28:43.180 --> 03:28:54.385]  I'm very disturbed that he would send his own daughter in to intern with Harvey Weinstein, who everybody knew, but the media wouldn't cover it because they were afraid of- Hold on right there, most certainly was just taking over.
[03:29:02.568 --> 03:29:03.929]  Welcome to the War Room.

[03:29:36.556 --> 03:29:40.278]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[03:29:40.758 --> 03:29:43.440]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[03:29:43.980 --> 03:29:46.241]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:29:46.741 --> 03:29:48.402]  And we control the narrative now.
[03:29:49.783 --> 03:29:56.546]  This is the War Room.
[03:29:56.566 --> 03:30:00.368]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:30:03.393 --> 03:30:14.180]  Leanne Tweeden, a model, sports broadcaster, and TV host, has revealed the behind-the-scenes harassment she endured on a USO tour with Senator Al Franken emceeing.
[03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:17.602]  Al came up to me and he's like, well, we need to rehearse our kiss.
[03:30:17.623 --> 03:30:19.023]  And I'm like, yeah, okay.
[03:30:19.184 --> 03:30:20.144]  And I just blew him off.
[03:30:20.404 --> 03:30:23.266]  You know, because I'm thinking, we don't need to rehearse a kiss.
[03:30:23.306 --> 03:30:26.989]  I mean, we're doing a live, you know, 60-second skit in front of troops.
[03:30:27.009 --> 03:30:28.570]  We're not filming a movie, right?
[03:30:29.050 --> 03:30:31.152]  And so I blew him off because I didn't think he was serious.
[03:30:31.812 --> 03:30:32.973]  And then, uh,
[03:30:33.553 --> 03:30:35.275]  He kind of said it again.
[03:30:35.355 --> 03:30:37.437]  He's like, well, we need to rehearse the kiss, Leigh-Anne.
[03:30:37.597 --> 03:30:41.381]  And I'm like, okay, Al, okay, you turn your head to the right.
[03:30:41.482 --> 03:30:42.643]  I'll turn my head to the right.
[03:30:43.023 --> 03:30:43.804]  Okay, we got this.
[03:30:44.184 --> 03:30:45.085]  It was relentless.
[03:30:45.125 --> 03:30:47.508]  That's what I could hear in his voice, right?
[03:30:47.528 --> 03:30:48.569]  He started getting relentless.
[03:30:48.609 --> 03:30:51.953]  And I'm like, why is he insisting that we have to rehearse the damn kiss?
[03:30:51.993 --> 03:30:54.415]  I mean, it's just a, it's like a fake kiss, right?
[03:30:54.435 --> 03:30:55.496]  This is all I could think about.
[03:30:55.516 --> 03:30:55.736]  I'm like,
[03:30:56.317 --> 03:30:57.778]  Good God, Al!
[03:30:57.798 --> 03:31:01.020]  You know, it's not SNL, for goodness sakes, right?
[03:31:01.160 --> 03:31:11.486]  We rehearse the line, and I'm coming towards him, and he comes up and he grabs me, and he puts his hand behind my head, and he aggressively comes in, and he mashes his mouth up against mine, and he sticks his tongue in my mouth.
[03:31:11.646 --> 03:31:18.350]  Back in January, Franken went for the jugular on the GOP, championing sexual assault victims.
[03:31:18.911 --> 03:31:23.954]  25% of American women say they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.
[03:31:25.655 --> 03:31:46.787]  And recent high-profile revelations about abuse, for example, former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes' abuse of his employees, as well as the allegations of sex bias at Kay and Sterling Jewelers, demonstrate that we are far from addressing this issue on a broader scale.
[03:31:49.328 --> 03:31:51.810]  So I urge my Republican colleagues
[03:31:53.308 --> 03:32:03.690]  To reconsider their support for this resolution, I urge them not to force vulnerable women who have been wronged into the dark.
[03:32:04.331 --> 03:32:10.192]  Franken's hypocrisy even went so far as to silence dissent among American news media.
[03:32:10.412 --> 03:32:14.193]  And the power trip isn't just resonating from Franken's office.
[03:32:14.453 --> 03:32:19.894]  Two unnamed current members of Congress have engaged in sexual harassment.
[03:32:20.074 --> 03:32:23.475]  One of them allegedly exposing themselves to a staffer.
[03:32:23.635 --> 03:32:35.978]  Representative Jackie Speier also recently revealed that Congress has paid out 260 harassment settlements in the last 20 years to the tune of 15 million taxpayer dollars.
[03:32:36.238 --> 03:32:37.418]  Talk about hypocrisy.
[03:32:37.678 --> 03:32:40.699]  It's gotten so bad that congressional staffers
[03:32:40.999 --> 03:32:51.863]  Signed an open letter demanding mandatory harassment training for the hordes of perverted power-mad congressmen and congresswomen darkening the doorsteps of our nation's capital.
[03:32:52.083 --> 03:32:56.985]  Al Franken should resign today because he's simply the first domino to fall.
[03:32:57.125 --> 03:33:00.206]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[03:33:09.039 --> 03:33:22.153]  Will they disavow Weinstein, Hearnstein, Leipstein, Hollywoodstein, Globalstein, Meryl Streep?
[03:33:22.173 --> 03:33:22.654]  She likes it.
[03:33:38.973 --> 03:33:41.416]  That is another great Cernovich production.
[03:33:41.496 --> 03:33:45.180]  Ed Cernovich on Twitter, everything he does is 5-10 million views.
[03:33:45.681 --> 03:33:47.703]  Amazing to see the common sense of that.
[03:33:47.783 --> 03:33:54.210]  Will they disavow the sexual predator when the Clintons have their own house of skeletons?
[03:33:54.230 --> 03:33:56.453]  It's not a house of cards, it's a house of skeletons.
[03:33:58.856 --> 03:33:59.837]  Mike Cernovich, what do you think?
[03:34:01.072 --> 03:34:16.857]  Yeah, we have to demand that they disavow, and that's what I said earlier before the final segment is, you have been on the forefront of women's rights for decades by taking on the real predators, the real predators like Harvey Weinstein.
[03:34:17.577 --> 03:34:24.300]  John Travolta had claimed that he as a young boy was forced to fellate Hollywood directors and stuff like that.
[03:34:25.959 --> 03:34:40.767]  Everybody in the media and the Democrat Party were complicit and part of a conspiracy of silence to protect Harvey Weinstein, and this just shows once again that Alex Jones is right, but they're not going to give you the credit that you deserve.
[03:34:41.027 --> 03:34:44.248]  Why can't they just say Alex Jones is right about the Hollywood people?
[03:34:44.288 --> 03:34:45.609]  Why won't they just say that?
[03:34:46.169 --> 03:34:53.653]  Is this, well I mean a lot of folks are talking about it, not just me, but is the House of Skeletons, is the House of Pedophilia, is the House of Rape beginning to collapse?
[03:34:53.713 --> 03:34:54.734]  Why is this coming out now?
[03:34:56.621 --> 03:34:58.184]  Yeah, the door has been opened.
[03:34:58.905 --> 03:35:01.229]  And I think the pedophile stuff is gonna come out.
[03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:04.314]  I was actually approached by a world-famous childhood actor.
[03:35:05.123 --> 03:35:12.949]  Who wanted to come forward with the story and I was going to go forward and break the story, but then he told me he can't do it anymore.
[03:35:13.430 --> 03:35:14.010]  And I go, why?
[03:35:14.050 --> 03:35:15.211]  He goes, you don't understand.
[03:35:15.491 --> 03:35:17.253]  They're going to come for everybody's family.
[03:35:17.653 --> 03:35:19.595]  And he just kind of, you know, disappeared.
[03:35:19.615 --> 03:35:25.639]  I've talked to some of those same famous names and, uh, it's it's because the phones are tapped and yeah.
[03:35:25.719 --> 03:35:27.501]  In fact, I don't even know.
[03:35:27.801 --> 03:35:28.642]  It's quite a few folks.
[03:35:29.861 --> 03:35:37.579]  Yeah, and if you read that article, The Cut, there's a line in there which says that he beat up a woman, a young girl, he beat her up.
[03:35:38.231 --> 03:35:46.077]  Photographers were all there taking his pictures, but nobody would come forward because, and I quote, he had too many journalists on staff.
[03:35:46.297 --> 03:35:55.244]  I was about to say, but what about Meryl Streep getting up when they were trying to extradite Roman Polanski for kidnapping and raping an 11-year-old girl, anally, until she was bleeding everywhere?
[03:35:55.484 --> 03:35:59.987]  And I don't want to be gross, I'm not into that, but folks need to know, I've got daughters, everybody's got daughters, you've got a daughter.
[03:36:00.267 --> 03:36:07.473]  Makes me want to kill people, I'm not saying I am, but these are like old pig-like men raping little girls, and they're not even doing it...
[03:36:08.308 --> 03:36:09.769]  You know, it's hurting him even worse.
[03:36:09.829 --> 03:36:10.930]  It's like the worst thing you could do.
[03:36:11.350 --> 03:36:14.913]  And then, Meryl Streep gets up at the Oscars and praises him!
[03:36:15.313 --> 03:36:17.615]  It's like, what the hell's wrong with these people?
[03:36:18.896 --> 03:36:21.758]  Meryl Streep also called Harvey Weinstein a god.
[03:36:22.259 --> 03:36:23.640]  She goes, I would like to thank God.
[03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:25.081]  Oh, I mean Harvey Weinstein.
[03:36:25.341 --> 03:36:29.664]  So there's no doubt now that Meryl Streep is part of a conspiracy of sexual predators.
[03:36:29.684 --> 03:36:30.605]  And they can simply do what they want.
[03:36:30.625 --> 03:36:31.246]  There's no doubt.
[03:36:31.266 --> 03:36:32.346]  I mean, she's, who knows?
[03:36:32.387 --> 03:36:34.108]  They use women and children as procurers.
[03:36:34.488 --> 03:36:36.249]  Is she like what they drive by on the ice cream truck?
[03:36:36.269 --> 03:36:37.250]  Like, look, I've got a puppy.
[03:36:37.290 --> 03:36:37.971]  I've got ice cream.
[03:36:39.161 --> 03:36:40.222]  Yeah, that's what I told him.
[03:36:40.242 --> 03:36:42.563]  Harvey Weinstein... I mean, do people like Meryl Streep?
[03:36:43.524 --> 03:36:49.928]  Because we know, reportedly, a woman who lured the 13-year-old in for Polanski to go and rape her in the rear end.
[03:36:49.948 --> 03:36:50.988]  I mean, who knows?
[03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:59.033]  Yeah, well Jeffrey Epstein actually had a woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was allegedly his pedophile madam, and that's what she would do.
[03:36:59.053 --> 03:37:00.774]  She would say, oh, I'm a model recruiter.
[03:37:01.054 --> 03:37:08.599]  So I can imagine that Meryl Streep... Sure, just like Renfield recruited for Dracula, it's women and young people recruiting for these predators.
[03:37:09.642 --> 03:37:16.853]  Right and Meryl Streep and again that's why they all hate Trump because and that's why they hate General Flynn because they were investigating the pedophiles and the pedophilia.
[03:37:17.193 --> 03:37:24.985]  That's the real big story nobody wants to talk about is the real reason they went after General Mike Flynn is because he was really focusing on pedophilia
[03:37:25.765 --> 03:37:26.245]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:37:43.573 --> 03:37:47.495]  Keeps freaking out about us and trying to frame us for a story we had nothing to do with.
[03:37:47.516 --> 03:38:05.847]  By the way, not to make it about us, but I've got all these articles saying we're fake news, even though we didn't say there weren't shooters there, and myself and others, and then they say ban us, and then Google's now banning stuff, some of our stuff as well, but then claiming that I said no one was shot when I've been saying day one it was real.
[03:38:06.127 --> 03:38:09.549]  I mean, this is, like you said, it's next-level lying, Mike.
[03:38:11.089 --> 03:38:12.210]  Yeah, I actually had that.
[03:38:12.250 --> 03:38:13.751]  I'm going to be on HBO tonight.
[03:38:13.791 --> 03:38:15.752]  They're doing a big special on me.
[03:38:16.553 --> 03:38:22.017]  And they came out of my own house and lied about things that I had written and kept trying to checkmate me.
[03:38:22.277 --> 03:38:23.257]  That's what they try to do.
[03:38:23.638 --> 03:38:30.803]  But the way I look at it is, if HBO wants to spend $100,000 to put my handsome face on television,
[03:38:31.623 --> 03:38:32.484]  Well, they don't get it.
[03:38:32.524 --> 03:38:33.464]  It's just like Megyn Kelly.
[03:38:33.504 --> 03:38:38.948]  They made me look like an idiot and edited it, but people didn't care just because they hate them already.
[03:38:39.408 --> 03:38:47.213]  Even though I look terrible because of what they did, everybody still loved me because by the system attacking me, they make us the hero.
[03:38:47.473 --> 03:38:52.516]  They're so narcissistic, Cernovich, they don't get how much they're hated.
[03:38:53.854 --> 03:39:00.242]  Yeah, they don't understand that Conor McGregor, even though he lost the fight, it's not about if you win or lose.
[03:39:00.322 --> 03:39:07.610]  It is about what kind of people in America will stand up on behalf of the people who have been silenced and bullied and attacked.
[03:39:07.690 --> 03:39:08.932]  It's about who will get in the arena.
[03:39:09.721 --> 03:39:10.501]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:39:10.762 --> 03:39:14.584]  So they can come in and try to hit you and dig stuff up and take you out of context.
[03:39:15.124 --> 03:39:24.669]  All people know is that guy, that guy right there, is willing to stand up against the globalists, stand up against the pedophiles, stand up against the Hollywood people.
[03:39:24.930 --> 03:39:29.952]  I mean, the whole thing about Harvey Weinstein, I would have broken that story any day of the week.
[03:39:30.433 --> 03:39:33.054]  But everybody else in media covered it up for decades.
[03:39:33.334 --> 03:39:36.076]  I'm going to ask you again, why is it breaking now?
[03:39:37.608 --> 03:39:43.412]  Well, you know, there's a good question about maybe there were other things he was worried about.
[03:39:43.612 --> 03:39:45.514]  So Harvey Weinstein before the story fell.
[03:39:45.554 --> 03:39:50.977]  Yeah, so they detonated just like Red Adair would blow up an oil well with dynamite so it quit burning.
[03:39:51.338 --> 03:39:55.120]  You gotta go ahead and give him a story up front to make it about that and not the other stuff.
[03:39:55.941 --> 03:39:59.944]  Yeah, so he didn't just like oysters, he also likes snails.
[03:40:01.246 --> 03:40:07.314]  Yeah, that's exactly the issue, is that I think what was going to surface are things much more nefarious.
[03:40:07.694 --> 03:40:12.560]  So because of that, he just gave them the story and said, OK, I'll let you call me a sexual harasser.
[03:40:12.621 --> 03:40:16.626]  I'll let you say that I tried to get 19-year-old women to watch me shower.
[03:40:17.418 --> 03:40:21.784]  But let's not talk about anything else that there might be underneath there.
[03:40:21.824 --> 03:40:33.700]  And then, of course, the media, which covered up for decades as part of a conspiracy of silence, said, OK, so you'll give us this one story, but we just can't talk about the other stuff, which we don't want to talk about anyway, because it'll hurt Democrats.
[03:40:34.361 --> 03:40:36.102]  Okay, well, we'll run this one story instead.
[03:40:36.122 --> 03:40:38.103]  Well, let me ask you this.
[03:40:38.163 --> 03:40:39.304]  I'm sitting here shifting gears.
[03:40:39.344 --> 03:40:40.465]  I mean, you're taking over at the end.
[03:40:40.885 --> 03:40:41.805]  Hopefully, you'll come on the war room.
[03:40:41.825 --> 03:40:47.409]  I know you're a busy guy, but we've got... I've got the Las Vegas, Nevada Country Music Fest in my hand, Route 91.
[03:40:47.809 --> 03:40:50.971]  I got this from a friend of mine, a guy that I've known for four and a half, five years.
[03:40:51.631 --> 03:40:52.932]  A great patriot in the community.
[03:40:53.352 --> 03:40:54.973]  He and his wife barely survived the attack.
[03:40:55.133 --> 03:40:56.494]  They went with cops to the event.
[03:40:57.540 --> 03:40:58.220]  Who didn't even hide.
[03:40:58.261 --> 03:40:59.601]  We're like, I'm gonna make them heroes.
[03:40:59.681 --> 03:41:02.904]  It's true, there was dragon people bleeding, you know, to save you as they're getting shot at.
[03:41:02.944 --> 03:41:03.704]  That's just the training.
[03:41:03.744 --> 03:41:04.224]  Great people.
[03:41:05.105 --> 03:41:06.506]  And I'm sitting here looking at this.
[03:41:06.586 --> 03:41:08.027]  This really happened.
[03:41:08.707 --> 03:41:09.748]  This really unfolded.
[03:41:10.609 --> 03:41:15.692]  And why, if Trump has the intel that it's an ISIS attack, won't he release it?
[03:41:15.772 --> 03:41:19.174]  Well, I know they're telling him it's an investigation, sir, and there's coded messages.
[03:41:19.194 --> 03:41:21.216]  But I mean, listen, Mike, I really
[03:41:22.509 --> 03:41:24.350]  Got this from the hostage rescue team.
[03:41:24.390 --> 03:41:25.050]  These are real people.
[03:41:25.090 --> 03:41:25.651]  This really happened.
[03:41:26.111 --> 03:41:27.652]  So I think this is going to come out.
[03:41:27.712 --> 03:41:28.892]  What are they going to do when it comes out?
[03:41:28.912 --> 03:41:29.793]  Or can they spin it?
[03:41:31.413 --> 03:41:36.396]  Well, the same way they call for a hood shooting, workplace violence, right?
[03:41:36.436 --> 03:41:36.896]  Remember that?
[03:41:36.916 --> 03:41:40.298]  Major Hassan, for almost four years, they said it wasn't Islamic.
[03:41:41.238 --> 03:41:44.680]  Yeah, so an Islamic terrorist shot up a bunch of people, an army-based murder people.
[03:41:44.700 --> 03:41:48.122]  Hitler killing millions of people, that was workplace violence too, right?
[03:41:48.991 --> 03:41:51.573]  Well, you know, we're their moderate Nazis.
[03:41:51.673 --> 03:42:00.420]  You know, you must not let your hatred of Hitler allow you to tarnish the moderate Nazis out there, of course, who are peaceful, loving, right?
[03:42:00.500 --> 03:42:02.981]  And let's be clear, you're being sarcastic.
[03:42:03.002 --> 03:42:03.982]  They'll say you're saying that.
[03:42:04.623 --> 03:42:08.125]  We're saying like radical Islam, we need to criticize the whole thing.
[03:42:09.226 --> 03:42:10.307]  Right, right, right, exactly.
[03:42:10.387 --> 03:42:15.311]  I can see them trying to clip that and be like, oh, you know, but people... Cernovich makes light of Nazis!
[03:42:16.294 --> 03:42:17.034]  Yeah, but that's the thing.
[03:42:17.055 --> 03:42:22.678]  They fired Curt Schilling for making a meme about who actually has killed more people.
[03:42:22.698 --> 03:42:27.861]  The actually radical Islamic terrorist, Jihad, has killed more people.
[03:42:28.102 --> 03:42:36.427]  And then he gets fired from ESPN, but of course if you go on ESPN and you say white people deserve to be murdered and we should murder all white people, well then you're okay and ESPN will keep you.
[03:42:36.447 --> 03:42:39.549]  And if you support Martin Luther King and say that's racist, they say you're a white supremacist.
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:41.541]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:42:41.561 --> 03:42:43.182]  People are waking up, so that's the whole point.
[03:42:43.202 --> 03:42:46.564]  All right, Mike, I'm going to hear you in the final segment straight ahead.
[03:42:47.024 --> 03:42:51.928]  Mike Cernovich, hopefully he'll be on The War Room today as well, coming up in T-minus 18 minutes.
[03:42:52.388 --> 03:42:53.088]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:54.249]  This is The Info War.
[03:42:54.269 --> 03:42:55.130]  Spread those articles.
[03:43:02.654 --> 03:43:03.154]  I would not agree.
[03:43:03.234 --> 03:43:04.636]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:43:04.676 --> 03:43:05.756]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:43:05.997 --> 03:43:06.937]  Why is this so good?
[03:43:07.218 --> 03:43:12.462]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:43:12.542 --> 03:43:26.092]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:43:26.152 --> 03:43:27.534]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:43:28.434 --> 03:43:29.876]  Spreading disease around.
[03:43:29.956 --> 03:43:32.439]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:43:32.539 --> 03:43:33.801]  These are all parasites.
[03:43:33.861 --> 03:43:34.942]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:43:34.962 --> 03:43:35.983]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:43:36.304 --> 03:43:40.649]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:43:40.829 --> 03:43:44.033]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:43:44.053 --> 03:43:47.155]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:43:47.195 --> 03:43:48.196]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:43:48.256 --> 03:43:50.137]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:50.197 --> 03:43:51.217]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:43:51.237 --> 03:43:53.299]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:43:53.939 --> 03:43:56.961]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:57.221 --> 03:43:59.122]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:43:59.503 --> 03:44:01.464]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:07.621]  I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[03:44:08.001 --> 03:44:10.323]  InfoWars has changed the world because you've supported us.
[03:44:10.603 --> 03:44:13.405]  The globalists are on the run, but they're launching counter-offensives.
[03:44:13.645 --> 03:44:19.450]  And now more than ever, I am thankful for your support, and I'm asking you to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:26.255]  Running right through to next week on Cyber Monday, we've got free shipping storewide, and clearly, the biggest sales in our history.
[03:44:26.416 --> 03:44:28.517]  We just keep launching bigger and bigger sales.

[03:44:32.500 --> 03:44:34.442]  We've got so many other products there that are 50%
[03:44:34.662 --> 03:44:34.942]  We're good.
[03:45:04.355 --> 03:45:04.735]  Carnivore.
[03:45:04.775 --> 03:45:06.396]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[03:45:06.856 --> 03:45:07.737]  All very affordable.

[03:45:09.718 --> 03:45:12.479]  The thing I am so ultra excited about.
[03:45:12.519 --> 03:45:14.520]  Because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[03:45:14.540 --> 03:45:20.483]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[03:45:20.703 --> 03:45:25.286]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[03:45:25.306 --> 03:45:28.247]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and stomach aches.
[03:45:28.327 --> 03:45:30.769]  And as you get older, you can't eat rich foods you could eat before.
[03:45:31.109 --> 03:45:33.050]  It's because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[03:45:33.530 --> 03:45:35.012]  Next Level Beyond Probiotic.
[03:45:48.727 --> 03:45:52.791]  That 20-ounce ribeye taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[03:45:52.871 --> 03:45:55.873]  It's called Carnivorbe Digestive Enzymes.
[03:45:56.073 --> 03:46:00.437]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.
[03:46:00.797 --> 03:46:02.339]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[03:46:02.719 --> 03:46:07.183]  People that are on these ketosis diets and Atkins type diets and paleo diets.
[03:46:07.823 --> 03:46:08.804]  It's just amazing.
[03:46:08.824 --> 03:46:09.745]  Made in the USA.
[03:46:09.985 --> 03:46:10.886]  Non-GMO.
[03:46:11.086 --> 03:46:17.011]  It's delivered directly into the stomach where it's needed with the digestive enzymes that your body needs with the acids to do this.
[03:46:17.151 --> 03:46:21.834]  Please go to InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com and read about this.
[03:46:22.315 --> 03:46:23.556]  Introducing Carnivore.

[03:46:26.898 --> 03:46:30.241]  Free shipping and 33% off out of the gates.
[03:46:30.301 --> 03:46:31.462]  Man, I used to eat a big steak.
[03:46:31.502 --> 03:46:32.323]  I didn't feel tired.
[03:46:32.363 --> 03:46:33.183]  I eat one now, I get tired.
[03:46:33.203 --> 03:46:33.824]  I started taking this.
[03:46:34.384 --> 03:46:34.624]  Boom.
[03:46:34.644 --> 03:46:35.325]  Ate a big rib eye.
[03:46:35.385 --> 03:46:35.645]  Boom.
[03:46:35.665 --> 03:46:36.206]  Eat two of these.
[03:46:36.266 --> 03:46:36.726]  Eat one of these.
[03:46:37.287 --> 03:46:37.968]  It's incredible.
[03:46:38.008 --> 03:46:38.928]  Digest it better.
[03:46:39.109 --> 03:46:40.049]  Aren't tired the next day.
[03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.810]  Don't get heartburn.
[03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:41.351]  Don't get stomachache.
[03:46:41.631 --> 03:46:45.314]  And that's what the government even lets you say about this digestive insight.
[03:46:45.334 --> 03:46:47.436]  So Carnivore is next level.
[03:46:47.536 --> 03:46:48.978]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:46:49.078 --> 03:46:50.319]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:50.359 --> 03:46:53.562]  It's the big umbrella site, but InfoWarsLive.com takes you right to it.
[03:46:53.882 --> 03:46:54.563]  Carnivore.
[03:46:54.703 --> 03:46:56.024]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:56.124 --> 03:46:57.586]  InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:47:14.301 --> 03:47:18.922]  And we're back, Mike Cernovich, Cernovich.com, C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H dot com.
[03:47:19.522 --> 03:47:31.364]  We're going to talk about all Weinstein today because it validates a lot of things we've talked about and that we now have proof the media has covered up Harvey Weinstein's acts.
[03:47:31.665 --> 03:47:33.945]  Now, this isn't only about Hollywood.
[03:47:34.565 --> 03:47:38.626]  He has been a major backer of Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:39.401 --> 03:47:41.002]  Major backer of Barack Obama.
[03:47:41.442 --> 03:47:42.903]  Major backer of Charles Schumer.
[03:47:43.483 --> 03:47:44.964]  Major backer of the Democrats.
[03:47:45.424 --> 03:47:53.869]  According to an article in The Cut, he assaulted a young female journalist, threw her on the ground, smashed her head in.
[03:47:54.609 --> 03:47:57.471]  Photographers from the New York Times took the picture.
[03:47:58.447 --> 03:47:59.227]  And they never ran it.
[03:47:59.648 --> 03:48:11.214]  Photographers from every mainstream outlet in the world took the photographs and they never ran it because they have to protect the Hollywood predators, the Hollywood sexual predators at all costs.
[03:48:11.594 --> 03:48:21.019]  So even though Weinstein has been caught now, caught being a sexual predator, all you gotta do is take one look at the guy and nobody would ever let their child around him.
[03:48:21.039 --> 03:48:25.542]  And yet Barack Obama sent his young daughter to intern
[03:48:26.226 --> 03:48:27.506]  Don't worry Harvey, we got you all.
[03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:56.950]  You know what?
[03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:58.751]  How you doing Harvey?
[03:48:58.791 --> 03:49:00.912]  You guys have always been good to me.
[03:49:00.932 --> 03:49:01.753]  Definitely.
[03:49:01.833 --> 03:49:03.494]  And you know whatever I do, I respect you.
[03:49:04.094 --> 03:49:05.835]  And I know you have a job.
[03:49:08.157 --> 03:49:10.398]  Harvey, how's your wife taking everything with this?
[03:49:11.299 --> 03:49:12.640]  I'm not answering any questions.
[03:49:12.660 --> 03:49:13.280]  No comments guys.
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:14.881]  I know you have a job.
[03:49:14.921 --> 03:49:15.341]  No problem.
[03:49:15.381 --> 03:49:16.822]  How you doing though Harvey?
[03:49:16.882 --> 03:49:17.683]  How you doing?
[03:49:18.706 --> 03:49:20.307]  You ready to go back to work some more?
[03:49:20.568 --> 03:49:21.308]  I gotta go to work.
[03:49:21.328 --> 03:49:22.209]  Alright, Harvey.
[03:49:22.329 --> 03:49:22.890]  Thank you, guys.
[03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:23.690]  Good to see you, Harvey.
[03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:24.931]  I'm not rich like you guys.
[03:49:25.151 --> 03:49:33.018]  Alright, thank you, Harvey.
[03:49:41.425 --> 03:49:44.147]  You notice he says, you've always been good to me.
[03:49:45.168 --> 03:49:46.990]  That right there is the buried lead
[03:49:47.845 --> 03:49:51.107]  Harvey Weinstein is saying, you've all always been good to me.
[03:49:51.528 --> 03:49:55.430]  In other words, you have always covered up the sexual predator offenses.
[03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:59.473]  You've always covered up the casting couch in Hollywood.
[03:49:59.953 --> 03:50:07.078]  You've always tried to prevent anybody from investigating pedophilia in Hollywood, to the child molesters.
[03:50:07.418 --> 03:50:10.200]  There was, of course, an actor too in Glee caught with 40,000.
[03:50:12.301 --> 03:50:18.125]  Yeah, Harvey Weinstein said he could spin or suppress anything because there were so many journalists on his payroll.
[03:50:18.985 --> 03:50:27.751]  And that article is horrific because so-called reporters from the New York Times and the Washington Post were there and they took pictures and never ran it.
[03:50:28.492 --> 03:50:30.553]  So now you know why they call this fake news.
[03:50:31.053 --> 03:50:35.076]  Now you know why they call Infowars fake news and Alex fake news and Cernovich fake news.
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:37.761]  They don't want us looking into this stuff.
[03:50:38.161 --> 03:50:49.284]  They want to control the narrative, and they are willing to cover up sexual predators, casting couch practices, the, you know, the sacrifices that some people claim that they do.
[03:50:49.944 --> 03:50:55.186]  John Travolta claimed that he was forced to give a fellatio again to when he was underage.
[03:50:55.906 --> 03:50:59.287]  You don't have to look very hard, but that's what they do.
[03:50:59.507 --> 03:51:03.628]  And then, of course, there was a Hollywood actor, Glee.
[03:51:04.769 --> 03:51:05.229]  Big show.
[03:51:06.495 --> 03:51:09.937]  40,000 child pornography images.
[03:51:10.438 --> 03:51:13.400]  He was such a pedophile that he carried them around on a thumb drive.
[03:51:13.780 --> 03:51:14.620]  There were 4,000.
[03:51:14.680 --> 03:51:20.404]  He couldn't be away from, and this by the way, you know, because a lot of people go child pornography.
[03:51:20.704 --> 03:51:24.227]  We're not talking about a 17 year old, 364 day old girl who looks maybe 20, under 10.
[03:51:30.362 --> 03:51:34.064]  He had images of six-year-olds in sexual positions.
[03:51:34.484 --> 03:51:36.465]  Six-year-old children, sexual acts.
[03:51:37.405 --> 03:51:39.726]  And he was such a digit, he would carry it on a thumb drive.
[03:51:40.807 --> 03:51:43.988]  Was he sharing that thumb drive with other people in Hollywood?
[03:51:44.288 --> 03:51:46.249]  Were they swapping images around?
[03:51:46.889 --> 03:51:51.271]  Were they trading pornographic images, child pornography, like baseball cards?
[03:51:52.111 --> 03:51:53.252]  Nobody in the media wants to ask this.
[03:51:53.272 --> 03:51:54.793]  They'll go, oh, isolated incident.
[03:51:55.953 --> 03:51:57.894]  How many more isolated incidents do we need?
[03:51:58.743 --> 03:52:00.184]  Let's talk again about Jacob Short.
[03:52:00.204 --> 03:52:01.946]  Yeah, the Glee star, Mark Saling.
[03:52:02.886 --> 03:52:04.167]  Child pornography.
[03:52:05.508 --> 03:52:06.929]  Why is this not a bigger story?
[03:52:08.050 --> 03:52:14.595]  Why is the media afraid of us asking questions about pedophilia and pedophiles in Hollywood?
[03:52:14.856 --> 03:52:15.977]  They're terrified of it, right?
[03:52:15.997 --> 03:52:16.857]  They're terrified of it.
[03:52:17.217 --> 03:52:18.098]  The question is why?
[03:52:18.198 --> 03:52:19.559]  Why don't they want us to ask?
[03:52:20.040 --> 03:52:23.302]  Well, Harvey Weinstein has said, you've always been good to me, to the media.
[03:52:23.683 --> 03:52:24.203]  I love you guys.
[03:52:24.243 --> 03:52:25.324]  You've always been good to me.
[03:52:25.844 --> 03:52:27.926]  Thank you for covering up for me.
[03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:29.441]  For decades.
[03:52:30.341 --> 03:52:31.362]  What else are they covering up?
[03:52:32.003 --> 03:52:37.527]  And then, of course, you got to remember Anthony Weiner going to prison now for 21 months.
[03:52:38.128 --> 03:52:38.868]  Child pornography.
[03:52:40.089 --> 03:52:46.695]  The mayor of Seattle accused of multiple cases of pedophilia.
[03:52:47.696 --> 03:52:48.376]  There's so many.
[03:52:48.436 --> 03:52:54.381]  I was actually talking to my journalist, Karissa Ervich dot com, and I go, guys, I can't keep track of all.
[03:52:54.421 --> 03:52:57.644]  We have to do like a list of all the Democrats who've been caught up.
[03:52:58.177 --> 03:53:02.799]  We got Jacob Schwartz, who was an honored guest on CNN.
[03:53:02.879 --> 03:53:04.800]  You can find his picture with Brooke.
[03:53:05.660 --> 03:53:07.781]  There's a news anchor, Brooke something or other.
[03:53:07.982 --> 03:53:08.322]  I forget.
[03:53:08.362 --> 03:53:08.942]  I forget her name.
[03:53:09.222 --> 03:53:10.983]  That's the thing is people are so irrelevant to me.
[03:53:11.003 --> 03:53:11.963]  I don't even know.
[03:53:11.983 --> 03:53:13.304]  I don't even know their names or how to say it.
[03:53:14.184 --> 03:53:19.927]  But Brooke, who's a CNN anchor, was hanging out partying with Jacob Schwartz, who was caught with child pornography.
[03:53:20.787 --> 03:53:23.869]  At least 11 mayors accused of child sex related crimes since 2016.
[03:53:23.909 --> 03:53:24.469]  This is an epidemic.
[03:53:27.728 --> 03:53:32.532]  Everywhere you look, Dennis Hastert, by the way, there are Republicans doing it too.
[03:53:32.832 --> 03:53:42.018]  That's the whole reason Republicans and Congress hate Infowars and hate everyone listening as much as the Democrats do.
[03:53:42.679 --> 03:53:44.780]  So this is not a partisan issue, by the way.
[03:53:44.860 --> 03:53:52.005]  This is a very... Democrats do seem to get caught more than Republicans, but there's more than enough of this in the Republican world to go around.
[03:53:53.326 --> 03:53:55.448]  So my question is, why will Congress
[03:53:56.838 --> 03:54:01.900]  Not hold hearings into pedophilia in Hollywood.
[03:54:02.561 --> 03:54:02.941]  Why not?
[03:54:04.602 --> 03:54:06.002]  It's a federal crime.
[03:54:06.823 --> 03:54:09.904]  Child molestation, child pornography, these are all federal crimes.
[03:54:10.844 --> 03:54:14.546]  So why will they not hold investigations into pedophiles in Hollywood?
[03:54:15.146 --> 03:54:23.090]  Well, because just like Bill Clinton would travel with Jeffrey Epstein on the Lolita Express and have sex with underage girls,
[03:54:24.304 --> 03:54:39.474]  The people in the House of Representatives, the people in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, they're going on yacht parties with Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood people, and they are partying, and they are doing things that most people couldn't even imagine doing.
[03:54:40.415 --> 03:54:45.779]  So Congress will never see a vice writer accused of raping multiple women.
[03:54:46.039 --> 03:54:48.080]  You can't even keep track, by the way.
[03:54:48.420 --> 03:54:50.542]  That's why people go, why do you guys get so fired up?
[03:54:51.683 --> 03:54:52.043]  Because
[03:54:53.001 --> 03:54:54.963]  We can't even keep track of all this stuff.
[03:54:55.944 --> 03:55:02.149]  You have a vice writer, which is a social justice magazine, accused of raping multiple women.
[03:55:03.671 --> 03:55:08.535]  Jacob Schwartz, who partied with Robbie Mook, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign person.
[03:55:09.656 --> 03:55:11.778]  Brooke, whatever her name is from CNN.
[03:55:13.620 --> 03:55:16.322]  He was a guest on Chris Cuomo's show, right?
[03:55:16.602 --> 03:55:18.264]  So why is Chris Cuomo?
[03:55:19.304 --> 03:55:23.066]  Who said that 13-year-old girls should get used to looking at penises.
[03:55:23.106 --> 03:55:23.926]  This is all proven.
[03:55:23.946 --> 03:55:27.968]  A lot of times people, you know, we're not even in the realm of speculation right now.
[03:55:28.648 --> 03:55:32.090]  We're not even in the realm of, well, imagined or who knows what's going on.
[03:55:32.470 --> 03:55:35.611]  Chris Cuomo said on Twitter, this is how degenerate these people are.
[03:55:36.572 --> 03:55:41.714]  They are so degenerate that it doesn't even occur to them, hey, don't say this in public.
[03:55:42.589 --> 03:55:47.873]  If you think that 12 year old girls should look at penises, you need to keep that to yourself, bro.
[03:55:48.193 --> 03:55:50.094]  That's not the kind of, like, that's real sick.
[03:55:50.634 --> 03:55:58.500]  There's nobody in the CNN room who'll be like, hey, bro, that just like when Alex and I, when we talk, Alex, you go, oh, just make sure people know you're being sarcastic.
[03:55:58.940 --> 03:56:02.262]  Or I'll say, hey, Alex, make sure people know that you're only asking questions.
[03:56:02.882 --> 03:56:04.684]  You're not making a statement, right?
[03:56:04.984 --> 03:56:08.566]  Because we know how that could look to the outside world and how that could be used, right?
[03:56:09.287 --> 03:56:11.288]  So you have people, we don't live in a thought bubble.
[03:56:12.384 --> 03:56:24.669]  Now, at CNN, they live in such a degenerate pedophile thought bubble that Chris Cuomo has no problem in public saying, hey, if you don't want your 12-year-old daughter to see penises, that's your problem, buddy.
[03:56:24.909 --> 03:56:25.589]  You're the bigot.
[03:56:26.310 --> 03:56:28.971]  You're the bad, you're the, what is it, pedophobia.
[03:56:29.431 --> 03:56:34.993]  Yeah, if you don't want your 12-year-old daughter to see penises, that is because you're a pedophobe.
[03:56:35.033 --> 03:56:37.514]  That's going to be the left's next big move.
[03:56:38.419 --> 03:56:39.760]  Pedophobia.
[03:56:40.261 --> 03:56:43.304]  CNN did an article, Do Pedophiles Deserve Sympathy?
[03:56:44.084 --> 03:56:45.786]  Again, you can find this stuff.
[03:56:46.166 --> 03:56:50.370]  This isn't me thinking, well, what if these people said it?
[03:56:50.390 --> 03:56:51.031]  This is all said.
[03:56:51.051 --> 03:56:55.435]  So we know that CNN has argued that pedophiles deserve sympathy.
[03:56:55.996 --> 03:56:59.759]  Chris Cuomo believes that 12-year-old girls should see penises.
[03:56:59.879 --> 03:57:02.422]  And if you have a problem with that, you're a pedophobe.
[03:57:03.306 --> 03:57:06.508]  And Jacob Schwartz was a guest on Chris Cuomo's show.
[03:57:07.028 --> 03:57:14.392]  Jacob Schwartz worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio, friends with Robbie Mook, big hotshot Democrat, caught with child pornography.
[03:57:14.692 --> 03:57:16.273]  The media, they always want to bury that.
[03:57:17.717 --> 03:57:18.718]  But God help us.
[03:57:19.279 --> 03:57:25.644]  If somebody who follows us on Twitter posts an offensive meme, posts an offensive tweet, then suddenly there's a big problem.
[03:57:25.905 --> 03:57:26.865]  So there is a cover-up.
[03:57:27.286 --> 03:57:29.188]  Harvey Weinstein is a tip of the iceberg.
[03:57:29.588 --> 03:57:31.470]  Harvey Weinstein is just a creep.
[03:57:32.911 --> 03:57:34.092]  But now we gotta go find a pedophile.
[03:57:34.132 --> 03:57:35.654]  We're going after him.
[03:57:35.674 --> 03:57:36.935]  We can't be stopped.
[03:57:37.295 --> 03:57:38.196]  Thanks for listening.
[03:57:38.436 --> 03:57:40.018]  Mike Cernovich, Cernovich.com.
[03:57:54.284 --> 03:57:54.664]  Carnivore.
[03:57:54.704 --> 03:57:56.326]  We have a small bottle and a big bottle.
[03:57:56.786 --> 03:57:57.667]  All very affordable.
[03:57:58.328 --> 03:57:59.529]  33% off, out of the gates.
[03:57:59.629 --> 03:58:02.412]  The thing I am so ultra excited about.
[03:58:02.452 --> 03:58:04.454]  Because I like a high-protein diet and I love meat.
[03:58:04.474 --> 03:58:10.459]  Everybody knows, even if you chew well, it has problems in the lower GI tract, the colon, the upper and lower intestines.
[03:58:10.660 --> 03:58:15.324]  And if you get the right enzymes, as you get older, you have less and less natural digestive enzymes.
[03:58:15.344 --> 03:58:17.246]  That's why you get more and more heartburn and
[03:58:17.666 --> 03:58:18.146]  Stomachaches.
[03:58:18.246 --> 03:58:20.647]  As you get older, you can't eat rich foods you could eat before.
[03:58:21.007 --> 03:58:22.968]  It's because you don't produce the same amount of enzymes.
[03:58:23.028 --> 03:58:24.989]  This is next level beyond probiotic.
[03:58:25.609 --> 03:58:26.789]  I've been taking this for two months.
[03:58:27.890 --> 03:58:31.591]  As it was getting prepared, it was getting ready, and man, I'm telling you, it is incredible.
[03:58:31.871 --> 03:58:34.212]  Normally, you eat a big steak for a day or two, you're tired.
[03:58:34.232 --> 03:58:36.093]  Doesn't happen anymore with this, and
[03:58:36.793 --> 03:58:42.736]  Never have any issues, you know, eat that 20 ounce ribeye, taking family out, you know, once every couple weeks for a fancy dinner.
[03:58:42.816 --> 03:58:45.797]  It's called Carnivore Digestive Enzymes.
[03:58:45.998 --> 03:58:50.380]  Relieves occasional indigestion, supports normal digestion, and macronutrients absorption.
[03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:52.260]  Helps digest high-protein foods.
[03:58:52.641 --> 03:58:57.143]  People that are on these ketosis diets, adjunct type diets, and paleo diets.
[03:58:57.763 --> 03:58:58.724]  It's just amazing.
[03:58:58.764 --> 03:58:59.584]  Made in the USA.
