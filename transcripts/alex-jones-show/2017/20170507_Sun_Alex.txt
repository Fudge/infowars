[00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:17.354]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:18.976]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:20.618]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:22.841]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:24.263]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:29.470]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:37.317]  We're going to do things a little bit different on this live Sunday Global Transmission.
[00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:40.718]  I'm going to open the phones up very, very early.
[00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:44.239]  In fact, to the third segment of the broadcast here in about 20 minutes.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.921]  Macron, the youngest French president ever.
[00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.842]  Napoleon in makeup is what they're calling him.
[00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:54.443]  Just won by 65 to 35 percent, more than a 20 percent.
[00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.665]  Lead on Marie Le Pen.
[00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:01.505]  Now here's the deal.
[00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.825]  I looked at the scientific polls and I read the fine print on them.
[00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.966]  How they carry the polls out.
[00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:10.127]  The methodology as they call it.
[00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:18.869]  And she was dead heat behind or ahead of him in polls that were giving him 5, 10, 15, 20 points depending on the poll.
[00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.230]  So something is rotten in the state of the Parisian capital today.
[00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:32.988]  Now it's already basically midnight in Paris and they have announced that Macron has won the French presidency by an emphatic margin.
[00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:35.489]  Two things happened here.
[00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.430]  Either the French capitulated like they did to Hitler.
[00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.632]  Oh, you can search engine.
[00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:48.854]  Two weeks after the French lost to Hitler, their main military stood down on the Maginot Line.
[00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:52.095]  The British Expeditionary Force fled to the coast in Dunkirk.
[00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.951]  Most of the French military leadership just signed up as Nazis.
[00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:03.134]  They'd done it before the war even started, as covert agents, and became the Vichy French down in the south of France.
[00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.816]  That's how France was run by the Nazis so quickly.
[00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.358]  There wasn't a French resistance the last year or so of the war.
[00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:16.623]  So either France is just sold out to Germany again, as Le Pen said, you'll either be ruled by me as a woman or by Angela Merkel.
[00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.164]  She said that in last week's debate.
[00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:31.000]  Either they have just wanted to be trendy, they want their pension funds, they want to be ruled by the EU, they just believe the lie of going along with the system, and they're playing into the froggy penchant for surrender.
[00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:40.328]  Or, as the poll numbers show, there was massive election fraud up on Real Alex Jones on Twitter, also on our Prison Planet Live Twitter with Paul Watson.
[00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:46.293]  We have the news and the reports there where they were sending out ballots with no Marie LePen on them all over the country.
[00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.492]  So, this just got announced the last 45 minutes.
[00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:57.354]  I mean, when I started doing live feeds earlier on Facebook and YouTube, it was postulated that he was the winner with the landslide.
[00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:59.795]  Now he is the winner.
[00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:04.616]  Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Macron, he is now the winner.
[00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:07.357]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:24.769]  We've seen, I mean, there's photos, you can Google these, of him at the knees, worshipping, on his knees, to Angela Merkel, who's opened the borders up to the Islamicists, who is absolutely letting Europe be captured by Islam, who is merging the EU with the Muslim countries.
[00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.250]  This is incredible.
[00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:28.491]  So that's all coming up.
[00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:29.512]  I want to take your calls.
[00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:32.674]  Also, I have challenged Stephen Colbert to be a man.
[00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:41.321]  He's an actor, posing as a reporter, who poses as a satirist, who then puts out ridiculous lies about myself, President Trump, and others.
[00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.222]  And then says, oh, it's just satire!
[00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:58.413]  But he says he's not satirical now, as Stephen Colbert, hosting the CBS Late Show, that was, of course, the barony previously of an actual good comedy genius, with quite a bit of art to his brain, but still a liberal.
[00:03:59.194 --> 00:04:00.655]  And, of course, that was David Letterman.
[00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:09.517]  But you have a pure actor up there who then hides behind being an actor and hides behind his 100 plus writers, 19 of them full time, 17 of them men.
[00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.358]  Where's the glass ceiling there?
[00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.839]  And he won't debate me.
[00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.039]  It's not that I need to go on a show.
[00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.600]  He attacks me almost every night.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.742]  It's that they're such cowards, they would never stand against a real man who, because he's a real, real, real man, who doesn't have a teleprompter or writers.
[00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:28.983]  He just sits there in these skits
[00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:33.627]  Posing as if he's this big intellectual.
[00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:36.469]  But he's not as bad as Bill Maher.
[00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.451]  The weasel with that you-know-what eating grin on his face.
[00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:42.212]  The turd gobbler.
[00:04:42.692 --> 00:04:43.633]  The turd gobbler.
[00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:45.894]  Bill Maher.
[00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.831]  Well, I've talked to a lot of Hollywood folks at dinner.
[00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.713]  They say that at dinner, he just starts bringing me up.
[00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:52.414]  He's been obsessed with me for over a decade.
[00:04:52.494 --> 00:04:57.198]  And he can come out and accuse the president of incest, basically.
[00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:59.760]  What if I said Bill Maher has sex with his family?
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.341]  Of course, it's satire.
[00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.204]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:05:06.886 --> 00:05:12.570]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:15.413]  I was a total fitness nut.
[00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:17.162]  20 years ago.
[00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:20.324]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:05:20.404 --> 00:05:21.544]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:05:21.564 --> 00:05:24.805]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:26.106]  Or more.
[00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:28.147]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:30.108]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:33.149]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.009]  It's actually scary.
[00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:46.416]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:05:47.396 --> 00:06:00.184]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:17.385]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:19.611]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:24.937]  When I started out on air 20 years ago, you never heard the term information war.
[00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:27.079]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:34.042]  And InfoWars, with our amazing audience of activists, and myself and the great crew, is changing the world.
[00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:37.885]  We're shattering the cultural mores of the establishment.
[00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:40.106]  We're exposing their false paradigms.
[00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:43.388]  We're exposing their tyranny, their hypocrisy, and so much more.
[00:06:44.744 --> 00:06:51.607]  And so they are arrogantly following the path of tyrants throughout history, like elephants going to a boneyard to die.
[00:06:52.747 --> 00:07:01.531]  They are trying to censor us, trying to shut us down, and creating facsimiles with the Late Show, with
[00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:12.131]  Stephen Colbert and with Viacom and CBS and Showtime with shows like Homeland and Law and Order.
[00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:32.337]  There are five national shows I know of that every week admittedly have an Alex Jones character on them, who they admit is Alex Jones, who they then put words in the mouth of racism, of hate, of disinformation that I never said or never did.
[00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:45.754]  In their attempt to psychologically condition and inoculate with poison in the minds of the people before they ever get sent a link to one of our videos or one of our articles or one of our guests.
[00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:53.397]  The system is scared of us, showing not how powerful we are, but how incredibly pathetic they are.
[00:07:54.383 --> 00:08:10.833]  And that's why the teleprompter actors posing as satirists, religious political propagandists, the Bill Mahers and the Stephen Colberts of the world, attack me continually, and attack the Liberty Movement continually, because they know we're not reading off teleprompters.
[00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:15.796]  They know we're true classical constitutional, classical liberals, paleo-conservatives.
[00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:17.377]  The modern terms mean nothing.
[00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:20.039]  They know we hold the light in the dark of the night.
[00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:21.760]  And they're scared of that.
[00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:33.815]  Macron, the protégé of Hollande, in a landslide 65-35, has won the election with more than 20 points.
[00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:49.922]  The 39-year-old investment banker who works for the Rothschild family, can't make that up, who was trained in the most government elite school for politicians, who is the right-hand man of Hollande, ran as an anti-establishment guy in a 13-way race.
[00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.583]  In the runoff, he was dead heat.
[00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:58.828]  With Merkel, his master.
[00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:13.414]  He was, of course, in a dead heat with the head of the Nationalist Populist Party, Marie Le Pen, who said that you will either vote me in as your leader or you'll have a woman ruling you.
[00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:15.815]  A woman's going to be running this country, France, one way or another.
[00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:22.038]  She said last week, you're either going to be under me, elected-wise, or you're going to be under the EU dictatorship run by Angela Merkel.
[00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.650]  You can look at this two ways.
[00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.252]  Either massive peer pressure manipulated the French to go along with this and they're totally into style.
[00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.613]  They're crippled by being seen as insiders.
[00:09:36.713 --> 00:09:41.835]  After Napoleon's conditioning and Hitler's occupation which they gave into and actually welcomed and
[00:09:42.884 --> 00:09:46.066]  The French lined the highways, praising Hitler as he rolled into Paris.
[00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.089]  I mean, they've been learning for a while since Napoleon to roll over or get killed.
[00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:52.630]  Hell, the Romans conquered France.
[00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:54.632]  They called it Gaul.
[00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:57.794]  So I guess for a couple thousand years, they've been learning to grab their ankles.
[00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:02.497]  But the French have great culture and, you know, under military control, they've been great soldiers.
[00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:05.038]  But it's very, very sad to see their servile
[00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:06.720]  Feudal nature.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.080]  Continue on.
[00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:12.523]  But either they had their election stolen from them, and the polls show that's probably what happened.
[00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:17.046]  A lot of ballots went out without even having Marilla Penn on them, according to the news.
[00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:26.131]  Or, they were enslaved by propaganda and went along with it, but either way you slice it, they didn't go the way of Britain pulling out of the unelected EU they never voted to enter.
[00:10:27.652 --> 00:10:30.534]  Obama told England, you better vote to stay in the EU.
[00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:34.677]  That, of course, blew up in their face, and we call it the kiss of death, but Obama endorsed
[00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:41.298]  Emmanuel Macron, and it was the kiss of victory, I guess, from Obama.
[00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:44.279]  What do you think's really happening here?
[00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:46.040]  We've seen Iceland pull out of globalism.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.882]  We've seen Italy vote a few months ago, five months ago, to not be part of the EU expansion to give up their liberties.
[00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:54.303]  We've seen a lot of other countries pulling out of globalism.
[00:10:54.603 --> 00:10:56.023]  We've seen nationalism rising.
[00:10:56.324 --> 00:10:59.365]  The globalists have said we've got to defeat Trump or he will overthrow our whole system.
[00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.966]  It's not that Trump's perfect, but he's actually becoming our new president.
[00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:06.997]  He's actually becoming an American president.
[00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:09.479]  He's actually transferring power back to the country.
[00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:16.024]  He's actually acting like the president, not taking orders from the TPP or the IMF or the World Bank or the World Trade Organization.
[00:11:17.005 --> 00:11:27.833]  And Hollande said six months ago that his job was to use the power of the government under national security to make sure Marie Le Pen didn't win when she was in the polls leading men.
[00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:31.115]  They indicted her criminally for criticizing Islam.
[00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:31.676]  That's illegal.
[00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:36.992]  Saying it's the biggest threat to France since Hitler invaded in 1941.
[00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:46.581]  Along in a slide dig at Le Pen, says French President on a mission to fight rise of populism.
[00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:53.407]  Know this, we've come from nobody knowing the Federal Reserve was foreign owned and private 10 years ago to most people knowing it.
[00:11:54.768 --> 00:11:59.112]  We've come from people not knowing there's a private corporate global government called the New World Order to most people knowing it.
[00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.090]  And see nationalism grow.
[00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.492]  So as negative as a lot of this news is, a lot of very very positive things are happening.
[00:12:06.612 --> 00:12:10.954]  I want to take your calls on this subject and pick your brain in live time on that.
[00:12:10.994 --> 00:12:18.417]  But I also want to talk about actors posing as journalists who then fall back claiming they're actors involved in satire.
[00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:27.912]  With Bill Maher, Stephen Colbert, and people saying horrible lies about myself, about President Trump, you name it.
[00:12:27.932 --> 00:12:35.137]  And now Bill Maher has come out, we'll play the clip here in a moment, on his show Friday, on HBO, that's been parroted by the mainstream media everywhere.
[00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:37.398]  He's like the Vice President of the Democratic Party.
[00:12:37.818 --> 00:12:39.519]  He's the Vice President of the shadow government.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.161]  The President, Stephen Colbert.
[00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:42.381]  That's their hope!
[00:12:42.942 --> 00:12:47.985]  That's their God, is a fake, playing the part of another fake, who's a satirist who won't tell you it's satire.
[00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:59.261]  Saying that Ivanka Trump, probably it's more visual, gives sexual favors to her father, and sexually services him, and that she's their hope.
[00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.361]  And what's the big message here?
[00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:02.602]  Ivanka and Jared Kushner, Democrats.
[00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:07.144]  Jared Kushner's father, an indicted kingpin.
[00:13:07.785 --> 00:13:10.906]  His associates, convicted prison-time kingpins.
[00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:11.766]  Like his father.
[00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:18.569]  With his stupid 666 Fifth Avenue address, or whatever.
[00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.571]  In love with themselves.
[00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:24.532]  They go grovel to the left.
[00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:25.393]  They do all this.
[00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:26.353]  They go meet with Merkel.
[00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:28.415]  They call for open borders and Muslim invasions.
[00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:29.335]  And what do you get?
[00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.377]  You get the media trashing you everywhere.
[00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:34.819]  You get Bill Maher claiming you have sex with your father.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.661]  And Bill Maher can hide and say, oh, it's just satire.
[00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:40.883]  No, it's way to get him in the headlines and then say it's a joke later.
[00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:45.727]  Imagine if I said Barack Obama was having sex with his daughters.
[00:13:45.807 --> 00:13:46.587]  I'm not saying that.
[00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:48.509]  They'll probably run with it and say I did.
[00:13:48.729 --> 00:13:49.690]  That's how deceptive MSM is.
[00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:52.833]  But you think about that.
[00:13:55.194 --> 00:14:06.382]  You think about all the different ways Stephen Colbert and his Tuck Buckford character and other times he just attacks me openly and has said things I never said or never did.
[00:14:06.402 --> 00:14:09.804]  And then the audience says, oh, well, it's just comedy.
[00:14:13.126 --> 00:14:16.209]  But it's not comedy when Stephen Colbert edited a tape three months ago
[00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:20.248]  Where I said I'm not anti-gay, and you edited it out, I'm not.
[00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:21.988]  You had me say I'm anti-gay.
[00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:27.130]  And then, renting a house, the woman came and banged on the door the next night.
[00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.391]  Said, you work for Alex Jones, don't you?
[00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:31.251]  These guys are actually pretty liberal.
[00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:32.732]  One of them said, yeah.
[00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:34.512]  She said, well, this guy's name's on the lease.
[00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:35.252]  You're not welcome.
[00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:35.713]  Get out of here.
[00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:36.893]  I'm throwing the other guy out.
[00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:39.781]  Totally illegal what she did, but she didn't care.
[00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:41.422]  I didn't say it, but it didn't matter.
[00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:47.263]  She wanted to involve herself in aggressive behavior watching Stephen Gobert and have somebody thrown off the air.
[00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:51.884]  Have somebody thrown out of their house.
[00:14:52.984 --> 00:14:53.564]  And that's the thing.
[00:14:53.584 --> 00:15:01.926]  They always want conservatives or libertarians or people that just aren't globalist traitors to their country thrown out of their jobs, thrown out of the air, thrown off their shows.
[00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:05.367]  But when it comes to them, they just say, oh, it's just satire.
[00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:07.447]  Like if I said,
[00:15:09.088 --> 00:15:16.613]  Stephen Colbert robs banks, or Stephen Colbert is a child molester, or Stephen Colbert is a member of the KKK, but then later said, oh, it's satire.
[00:15:16.873 --> 00:15:19.915]  They don't even say it's satire when they say similar stuff about me.
[00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:23.337]  They just are a satire show, but their viewers don't know it.
[00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:29.541]  So when we come back, I'm going to play the attack on Ivanka Trump and President Trump.
[00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:34.312]  Saying, you know, our savior was supposed to be Ivanka Trump, but she's not going to save him.
[00:15:34.853 --> 00:15:38.054]  You know, belittling a woman like she has no power but sexual power.
[00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:45.997]  See, why is it the left can be the most misogynistic, vulgar, hateful groups they want, but then nobody else even has free speech?
[00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:48.418]  Because they're the anointed by Sumner Redstone.
[00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.379]  They're the anointed by the big media.
[00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:54.021]  They're the anointed by HBO to do whatever they want.
[00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:55.622]  Because they're God.
[00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:56.462]  We're the little people.
[00:15:56.882 --> 00:15:57.643]  They're the elites.
[00:15:57.663 --> 00:15:58.683]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:58.703 --> 00:15:59.844]  Spread the word about the transmission.
[00:15:59.884 --> 00:16:00.744]  You are unstoppable.
[00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:07.738]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.
[00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:13.101]  Introducing Caveman, where cutting-edge science meets ancient super nutrients.

[00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:09.793]  I don't feel good.
[00:19:09.853 --> 00:19:13.375]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:19:13.595 --> 00:19:16.257]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:19:16.317 --> 00:19:21.620]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.541]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:28.483]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[00:19:28.604 --> 00:19:30.785]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:31.205]  I love it.
[00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:33.969]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:35.130]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:40.638]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine.
[00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.561]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:08.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:21.460]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:23.844]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:27.950]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.894]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:33.598]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:46.447]  So, famous Hollywood stars can be caught having sex with little kids, like Roman Polanski.
[00:20:46.527 --> 00:20:52.511]  And top Democrats and top movie stars come out and say, let him come back to the U.S., get rid of his sentence.
[00:20:54.733 --> 00:21:02.358]  You can have Democrats involved in the wildest sex parties, the most illegal stuff you can imagine, pedophilia, it all comes out, nobody gets in trouble.
[00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:17.119]  But if conservatives say that the NFL is trying to push black quarterbacks and make them succeed no matter what, like Rush Limbaugh said, they say for two years boycott him, he's got to be taken off the air.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.580]  When it's clearly just his opinion.
[00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:25.262]  Then they say that the Patriots are racist because a third of their team or whatever is white.
[00:21:29.084 --> 00:21:30.644]  You know, it's white supremism or whatever.
[00:21:31.045 --> 00:21:31.845]  Totally insane.
[00:21:34.923 --> 00:21:44.229]  But then you can have Bill Maher, it's not as powerful on radio, it's on television, he simulates Ivanka Trump having sex with her father.
[00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:58.178]  And says, oh daddy, oh daddy, and it's super creepy, it's pedophilic, it's not just misogynistic in their own liberal terms, but it's very, very incestuous.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.242]  But that's okay, see?
[00:22:01.643 --> 00:22:15.563]  He can say, kill people, kill kids, clear up the highway, I want euthanasia, but then when he says, oh, Alex Jones is evil and bad, he doesn't believe the government's official story of Sandy Hook, he says kids didn't die, I'm not saying that, I'm saying I don't believe a word comes out of their mouths!
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.681]  Oh, but then they're the great guardians of everybody, and they care about the kids.
[00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:26.523]  And, oh, Obamacare is being repealed, and this new thing won't cover everybody.
[00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:27.924]  Obamacare didn't either.
[00:22:28.204 --> 00:22:29.244]  It's just bankrupting us.
[00:22:29.544 --> 00:22:32.785]  They admit it's meant to bankrupt our healthcare, so nobody gets good healthcare.
[00:22:34.246 --> 00:22:35.006]  It's meant to loot it!
[00:22:36.527 --> 00:22:37.467]  Ezekiel Emanuel!
[00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:42.369]  Jonathan Gruber said, thank God you're so dumb.
[00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:43.669]  Thank God you don't have attention spans.
[00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:46.030]  This is written by insurance companies to rob you!
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:23:03.253]  But it doesn't matter because Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel can all come out and cry and lie to you when they're the big corporate stooges with the best writers in the country reading off teleprompters with studio audiences of idiots told when to clap by big signs that flash up.
[00:23:03.353 --> 00:23:04.474]  Clap, clap, clap!
[00:23:08.174 --> 00:23:10.775]  Are we really just a bunch of occupied morons like the French?
[00:23:12.588 --> 00:23:15.030]  The Germans invade France, their whole military stands down.
[00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.973]  The French military joins the Nazis as the Vichy French.
[00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:23.917]  They set up a new capital outside Paris, in Vichy France, and are called Collaborators.
[00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:26.099]  And I wanted that for the next piece coming up.
[00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:28.981]  Can you guys just search engine, Hitler, Tours, Paris.
[00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:31.423]  There's photos, there's newsreels, it's on YouTube.
[00:23:31.904 --> 00:23:33.145]  You just read the Wikipedia about it.
[00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:34.926]  Paris stood down, France stood down.
[00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.548]  The British ran to Dernkirch.
[00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:39.130]  My movie's coming out about it.
[00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.471]  Escaped off the shore.
[00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:44.631]  Yeah, scroll down.
[00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:44.631]  1940.
[00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:46.692]  Hitler takes tour of Paris.
[00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:47.352]  Click images.
[00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:53.094]  Show people Hitler driving through Paris and the French waving at him and hailing him.
[00:23:53.674 --> 00:23:55.635]  Just like the new EU system.
[00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:59.816]  Just type in Hitler tours Paris, visits Napoleon's grave.
[00:24:00.556 --> 00:24:01.797]  You'll have thousands of photos.
[00:24:01.977 --> 00:24:02.817]  You'll have newsreels.
[00:24:02.857 --> 00:24:03.637]  You can go to YouTube.
[00:24:03.878 --> 00:24:04.598]  You can pull it up.
[00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:07.819]  And the French waving and saying, Heil Hitler!
[00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:11.181]  Because the French love to capitulate.
[00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:12.743]  They love to surrender.
[00:24:13.043 --> 00:24:13.884]  They love to give up.
[00:24:13.924 --> 00:24:15.005]  They learned under Napoleon.
[00:24:15.226 --> 00:24:16.627]  They learned under William the Conqueror.
[00:24:16.847 --> 00:24:17.408]  They learned.
[00:24:17.588 --> 00:24:18.109]  They learned.
[00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.789]  They're learned.
[00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:19.770]  For a thousand years.
[00:24:22.573 --> 00:24:24.716]  Yeah, just type in Hitler Tours France.
[00:24:25.877 --> 00:24:26.858]  Click newsreels.
[00:24:26.918 --> 00:24:29.661]  It's him driving through Paris and the French, the Parisians are out.
[00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:30.482]  Heil Hitler!
[00:24:30.522 --> 00:24:31.162]  Heil Hitler!
[00:24:31.202 --> 00:24:31.523]  Heil Hitler!
[00:24:32.697 --> 00:24:33.357]  Worshipping him!
[00:24:33.377 --> 00:24:35.298]  The media will probably take that clip out and say, I said that.
[00:24:35.598 --> 00:24:37.579]  Because they're evil, like Hitler, folks.
[00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:38.619]  They're deceptive.
[00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:39.479]  They think you're dumb.
[00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:40.859]  I don't think you're dumb.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.680]  Here it is!
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.920]  Yes, Hitler in Paris!
[00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:46.501]  And you can watch him once he gets to the big crowds.
[00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:48.762]  They're out there... ...hiling Hitler!
[00:24:50.242 --> 00:24:51.403]  And he goes and tours it all!
[00:24:51.683 --> 00:24:53.883]  Two weeks after the Germans invaded, they gave up!
[00:24:54.104 --> 00:24:55.724]  Because they'd already been sold out internally.
[00:24:55.984 --> 00:24:57.405]  Just like the EU and Merkel.
[00:24:57.485 --> 00:24:58.405]  Now rules.
[00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.792]  Le Pen said you'll be ruled by a woman, by me, or you'll be ruled by Merkel, another woman.
[00:25:04.092 --> 00:25:04.632]  And they are.
[00:25:05.693 --> 00:25:07.373]  The polls showed, though, that they were neck and neck.
[00:25:07.453 --> 00:25:08.654]  I think they stole the election.
[00:25:08.914 --> 00:25:12.896]  They wanted a big, strong showing that nationalism's in trouble, that it's gone.
[00:25:13.156 --> 00:25:15.077]  It's all part of the arrogance of these people.
[00:25:17.198 --> 00:25:18.498]  I'm going to shoot a special report on that.
[00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:19.919]  I've even got color footage.
[00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:21.960]  Color footage of Hitler in Paris.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.640]  You can type that in.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.641]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:25:24.061 --> 00:25:26.082]  And the French hailing Hitler.
[00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:30.006]  That's the Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:25:30.307 --> 00:25:31.567]  That's the mass submission.
[00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:42.311]  Now, let's go ahead though and go to Bill Maher.
[00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:46.892]  Bill Maher, again, you can say, oh, it's just a joke, oh, it's just comedy.
[00:25:47.693 --> 00:25:51.554]  Everybody else gets fired for saying one-tenth of this.
[00:25:51.594 --> 00:25:56.696]  Can you imagine if a conservative talk show host or libertarian or anybody else got up on TV and said,
[00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.684]  And Bill Maher acts like it's a talk show, not comedy.
[00:26:00.704 --> 00:26:02.526]  He has a comedy intro, but it's a serious show.
[00:26:02.866 --> 00:26:03.707]  But he hides behind that.
[00:26:04.868 --> 00:26:17.541]  Imagine if I or you or anybody else had a national show and then got up there and said, oh, looks like one of Obama's daughters comes in, the savior, and says, oh, daddy, let me have sex with you.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.260]  That person will be off the air in a day.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.941]  But it's okay, because it's... Oh, it's Bill Maher!
[00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:25.381]  Oh my gosh, it's him!
[00:26:25.661 --> 00:26:31.082]  He's allowed to, he's our enlightened one, he's our God, he's our Lord, he's our Savior.
[00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:32.762]  Here it is, purely sickening.
[00:26:35.283 --> 00:26:42.604]  A lot of us thought, oh, Ivanka's going to be our saving grace, you know, when he's about to fucking nuke Finland or something.
[00:26:43.664 --> 00:26:46.965]  She's going to walk into the bedroom and, you know, yeah, daddy.
[00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:48.915]  Daddy.
[00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:57.364]  Don't do it, Daddy.
[00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:05.810]  Is that how you see it, Ponca?
[00:27:07.071 --> 00:27:07.491]  No, I... Okay.
[00:27:08.652 --> 00:27:13.435]  But see, they're banning whiteboards at colleges everywhere because someone might write something bad.
[00:27:13.475 --> 00:27:16.157]  That's worse than banning books.
[00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:18.518]  That's banning writing.
[00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:31.207]  And everywhere they're saying, can't use this term, can't use that term, don't make jokes, it's inappropriate, where everybody's a bunch of stuck-up, neurotic, weird, arrested development, chip-on-the-shoulder twits who are ruined for life.
[00:27:32.745 --> 00:27:35.146]  Sensitivity training is basket case training now.
[00:27:35.666 --> 00:27:36.487]  Brokeback training.
[00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:44.891]  And they all want that, where you can't make jokes at college, you can't have Seinfeld come to your college, you can't have even liberal comics come because somebody's offended.
[00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:54.195]  But then the gods are still allowed, with the scripted teleprompter crap that's been written for them, to sit up there and to lie to everybody.
[00:27:56.036 --> 00:28:01.039]  And to sit up there and twist, and defame, and demonize, and it's okay.
[00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:03.199]  Because they're the anointed ones.
[00:28:03.239 --> 00:28:03.900]  They're the gods.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.020]  They're the Koberes.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.181]  They're the Mars.
[00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:07.341]  They're better than us.
[00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:08.081]  They have speech.
[00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:08.482]  We don't.
[00:28:08.542 --> 00:28:09.062]  They live.
[00:28:09.322 --> 00:28:09.782]  We sleep.
[00:28:10.682 --> 00:28:13.023]  I want to take your calls on Macron winning.
[00:28:13.784 --> 00:28:14.364]  It's official.
[00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:16.345]  By a huge landslide.
[00:28:16.365 --> 00:28:16.425]  65 to 35.
[00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:18.706]  20 plus percentage points.
[00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.627]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:24.568]  The Sunday number is different than the weekday number.
[00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:25.288]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:25.308 --> 00:28:25.348]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:36.674]  I've challenged on Twitter Stephen Colbert, when he attacked me more than 15 times in the last month, to, hey, why don't you actually have me on?
[00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:38.836]  Oh, but I get it.
[00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:41.118]  You've got to have a bunch of riders and a teleprompter.
[00:28:41.438 --> 00:28:42.439]  You're not a real person.
[00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:46.102]  You represent a whole group of people, like the mouth of Sorem.
[00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:47.223]  I get it.
[00:28:47.363 --> 00:28:48.164]  You're not your own man.
[00:28:49.448 --> 00:28:50.669]  But they're already attacking me every day.
[00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:53.191]  It's not like I need to be validated by being on their show.
[00:28:53.651 --> 00:28:56.514]  I became famous, affected world change, exposed the globalists.
[00:28:56.954 --> 00:28:57.915]  With you, the listeners.
[00:28:58.015 --> 00:28:59.176]  We are who is important.
[00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:00.397]  Not these teleprompter...
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:19.364]  France, specifically Paris, has been hit with six jihadist terror attacks in the last three years, yet just 5% of people in Paris voted for Marine Le Pen.
[00:29:19.384 --> 00:29:20.644]  38% voted for Macron.
[00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:26.306]  Are they happy just continuing to live with terrorism, you know, as Macron said before the vote?
[00:29:26.366 --> 00:29:28.667]  Are they just happy to continue with business as usual?
[00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:44.203]  It's insanity, and the worrying thing is, I hope the pen can do it this time, and I keep gauging that when it will happen is in four years' time, when we have the elections of Holland at the same time as Germany, now because of Theresa May, there'll be elections across Europe in four years' time.
[00:29:44.624 --> 00:29:48.946]  But the worrying thing is that the new generations, or the younger generations, think this is normal.
[00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:52.749]  Because as they're growing up in it, terrorism will become part of everyday life.
[00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:55.430]  Because that's all they've known and all they've seen.
[00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.792]  Because for the last four or five years, across Europe, it's just terror, terror, terror.
[00:29:59.892 --> 00:30:04.534]  The next four years, I think when you look at the arrest rate, they go up 60% a year across Europe.
[00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:08.696]  The attacks are intensifying, they're getting worse, they're getting bigger, they're getting badder.
[00:30:09.136 --> 00:30:13.819]  So it's worrying for the next... I think that the changing point will be the election in four years' time.
[00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:15.419]  But yeah, it's insanity.
[00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:16.600]  And for Paris,
[00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:19.401]  New mindset seems to be similar to London.
[00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:22.606]  The feminists in France yesterday, they're not upset about this.
[00:30:22.686 --> 00:30:27.854]  They're not... Well, the women are in France, the ones who don't go out and expose themselves, the actual women voters.
[00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:41.851]  Majority voted for Marine Le Pen in France because of the threats they face, because they don't feel safe.
[00:30:41.971 --> 00:30:45.434]  They've done polls where they tell pollsters that they don't feel safe.
[00:30:46.115 --> 00:30:54.802]  She got the most votes from women, yet we have feminists out trying to block people from voting from Marine Le Pen, who would be the first female president of France.
[00:30:55.482 --> 00:31:04.488]  Anti-Le Pen protesters have come here to protest against the fact that the National Front is due to hold a rally in the venue just behind me.
[00:31:04.628 --> 00:31:09.751]  They were saying that they're unhappy with the National Front holding this rally here in Paris.
[00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:15.355]  They call them fascists and they say that they don't want them here and they're calling on people to rise up on the streets.
[00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:15.795]  I think?
[00:31:30.572 --> 00:31:32.853]  What is the fundamental disconnect?
[00:31:33.273 --> 00:31:42.095]  I mean, I guess it's just Islamism, feminism, the far left, they all have the general same goal of destabilizing society, overturning everything.
[00:31:42.515 --> 00:31:52.697]  So they've formed this toxic alliance, even though on the surface it's completely contradictory to the ideals of original feminism to protect women and women's rights.
[00:31:54.297 --> 00:31:57.478]  It's like they use each other, because they see it as an ally who's getting their way.
[00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:10.815]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:10.915 --> 00:32:19.021]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:24.003]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:24.184 --> 00:32:30.907]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:30.967 --> 00:32:38.050]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:45.014]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:49.537]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:49.657 --> 00:32:52.919]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:59.182]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:59.343 --> 00:33:01.564]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:06.427 --> 00:33:09.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.664 --> 00:33:28.845]  Live from Austin, Texas, from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.066 --> 00:33:49.389]  So, France has voted 65 to 35, if you believe that, for Emmanuel Macron, who literally works for the Rothschild banking dynasty, was groomed by Hollande, the socialist, who's super unpopular, who's opened the borders up to Muslims even worse.
[00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.950]  He has landslided
[00:33:53.905 --> 00:33:59.027]  Marine Le Pen, if you believe that, even though polls showed her in most polls ahead of him or dead heat or slightly behind.
[00:33:59.648 --> 00:34:00.528]  I think there's fraud here.
[00:34:00.548 --> 00:34:02.069]  There's evidence that's in the French news.
[00:34:03.089 --> 00:34:06.591]  But what a resounding supposed defeat for nationalism.
[00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.393]  And I guess coming up in another six years in 2022,
[00:34:13.353 --> 00:34:17.614]  They'll just keep bringing more Muslims in, more burning cities, tourism down by 80%.
[00:34:18.134 --> 00:34:21.095]  They just are committing national suicide right now.
[00:34:21.615 --> 00:34:23.416]  Macron wins French presidency.
[00:34:23.476 --> 00:34:24.536]  I want to take your calls.
[00:34:25.076 --> 00:34:27.877]  The toll-free number is different on the weekend than it is weekdays.
[00:34:28.237 --> 00:34:29.357]  My weekday shows 11 a.m.
[00:34:29.377 --> 00:34:29.857]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:29.897 --> 00:34:30.237]  Central.
[00:34:31.538 --> 00:34:34.038]  This number is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:34:34.058 --> 00:34:40.960]  We're going to go to John, Abel, Sean, Robert, Jacob, and others here pretty quickly.
[00:34:43.404 --> 00:34:54.646]  And then later I'm going to do a little bit of a history lesson on the French standing down to the Nazis, their own military founding its own government in Vichy, and that's why we hear France lost in two weeks.
[00:34:55.106 --> 00:34:56.486]  They didn't lose, they rolled over.
[00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:01.327]  And the French are known as wimps since then.
[00:35:01.707 --> 00:35:06.128]  They beat the Germans in World War I. More than 10 million people died.
[00:35:06.148 --> 00:35:08.868]  You can read about Vichy France, all of it.
[00:35:09.888 --> 00:35:12.649]  But this is either a rolling over to the EU and Angela Merkel,
[00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:17.286]  Or it's a rolling over, just the government's so corrupt it stole the election.
[00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:32.171]  I find it hard to believe that in scientific polls, she was ahead many of them, or dead heat, or slightly behind, and now she loses 25 points or so.
[00:35:32.191 --> 00:35:32.251]  35 to 65.
[00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:35.331]  That's more than... I mean, that is amazing!
[00:35:36.152 --> 00:35:39.213]  Those stories are all up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:35:39.253 --> 00:35:39.693]  And by the way,
[00:35:40.928 --> 00:35:52.736]  It is an act of resistance to CNBC, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, all the major news channels lying about us every day, saying horrible things about me that aren't true, because they know we're the resistance.
[00:35:53.057 --> 00:35:55.198]  We're the Americans exposing the global takeover.
[00:35:55.458 --> 00:36:00.502]  The TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, that Trump in his first 100 plus days has done a good job battling.
[00:36:01.663 --> 00:36:02.804]  But now he's starting to falter.
[00:36:03.044 --> 00:36:05.245]  He can't get good people in DC.
[00:36:06.326 --> 00:36:07.207]  We'll talk some about that.
[00:36:07.647 --> 00:36:10.329]  But regardless, nationalism's rising all over the world.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.281]  So there's a great awakening happening.
[00:36:15.321 --> 00:36:17.023]  We should be very, very positive.
[00:36:17.663 --> 00:36:21.967]  The frustrating thing is that the fraud machine is just going up on high.
[00:36:22.067 --> 00:36:38.880]  So, last week, or early this week, Stephen Colbert said that Donald Trump is the Vienna sausage holster of the President of Russia.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.882]  That doesn't violate FCC rules.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:43.490]  But the FCC is investigating.
[00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:46.012]  So we have decided that there's no free speech.
[00:36:49.095 --> 00:36:51.917]  It's like, there's this famous British actor that's being investigated in Ireland.
[00:36:52.237 --> 00:36:53.598]  He's an Irish actor but lives in England.
[00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:56.601]  Because he came out and said, man, if God's real, he sure is a sadist.
[00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:58.422]  He's being investigated for blasphemy.
[00:36:58.662 --> 00:37:01.865]  We don't want to become the Islamist enforcers we're fighting, do we?
[00:37:03.936 --> 00:37:06.277]  But I said he shouldn't lose his job for that.
[00:37:06.577 --> 00:37:07.357]  He's a satirist.
[00:37:07.397 --> 00:37:08.177]  He's a comedian.
[00:37:08.938 --> 00:37:11.138]  He can say that Trump's the butt boy if he wants.
[00:37:11.478 --> 00:37:12.779]  That's not attacking anybody.
[00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:14.339]  That's not attacking some group.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.920]  But notice how we're already in the box.
[00:37:18.381 --> 00:37:21.562]  If we say that Stephen Colbert doesn't have the right to say what he wants,
[00:37:22.688 --> 00:37:23.728]  Well then we don't have the right.
[00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:26.990]  If you want to be anti-homosexual, that's your issue.
[00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.752]  If you want to be pro, or neutral, or tolerant, that's your issue.
[00:37:31.132 --> 00:37:34.494]  But we've now gotten to the point where, oh don't worry, what he said isn't homophobic.
[00:37:35.574 --> 00:37:42.417]  So it's okay that he says that the President's engaging in oral sex on a foreign leader.
[00:37:43.358 --> 00:37:46.940]  But what he meant by it clearly was saying he's an agent of Putin.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.220]  He's a brown noser.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.281]  He's a butt boy.
[00:37:50.123 --> 00:37:59.826]  It wasn't meant even in that, but they expand it where it can't have whiteboards, can't have brown bags, can't have Cinco de Mayo parties at your high school or your frat, because it's cultural appropriation.
[00:38:00.226 --> 00:38:05.347]  It's total racism being inculcated to make us all a bunch of basket cases at each other's throats.
[00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:07.228]  We're not learning reading, writing, arithmetic.
[00:38:07.448 --> 00:38:08.788]  We're learning political correctness.
[00:38:09.008 --> 00:38:10.349]  We're learning how to be paralyzed.
[00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:11.749]  We're learning how to not have speech.
[00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.350]  The colleges are the opposite of open, free societies.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.782]  So I said don't take his free speech, but see he's busy out saying he's glad Bill O'Reilly got fired.
[00:38:23.142 --> 00:38:25.282]  He's out busy saying let's police other people's speech.
[00:38:25.602 --> 00:38:28.803]  So that's what makes it so sick is that Bill Maher wants political correctness.
[00:38:29.043 --> 00:38:30.404]  He wants free speech restrictions.
[00:38:30.784 --> 00:38:31.864]  So does Stephen Colbert.
[00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:34.945]  Except they, they don't have to be under it.
[00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:40.727]  And they hide behind it being satire as they pose as news reporters and claim they're not being satirical.
[00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:47.812]  When they say that, I don't know the name of my children, or I'm a racist, or I'm a homophobe, or all these other lies.
[00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:49.933]  They hide behind that.
[00:38:51.294 --> 00:38:57.756]  But then when they do something that clearly could be construed as that, oh it's okay because they're liberal, they're allowed to have their free speech.
[00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:01.538]  They're above the law.
[00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:02.959]  They're the super class.
[00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:03.799]  They're the elite.
[00:39:06.078 --> 00:39:08.519]  I don't need to go on Colbert's show to get famous or popular.
[00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:10.120]  I'm already on it almost every night.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:16.863]  But it shows how there's teleprompters, how it's all prescripted, how scared they are on a Bill Maher.
[00:39:16.883 --> 00:39:18.924]  I mean, I turned down The View last week.
[00:39:18.964 --> 00:39:22.146]  I turned down Charlie Rose's show last week because they weren't live.
[00:39:22.186 --> 00:39:22.766]  They wanted to tape.
[00:39:23.772 --> 00:39:25.053]  The view's bigger than Colbert.
[00:39:25.593 --> 00:39:28.954]  But the point is, is that people, oh, you wish you were on Colbert.
[00:39:29.255 --> 00:39:30.075]  I'm on Colbert.
[00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:31.476]  A facsimile of me.
[00:39:31.996 --> 00:39:39.079]  When he attacks me by name, when he makes up what I've said is Stephen Colbert, which he claims isn't an actor, which is an actor, which is a persona.
[00:39:39.319 --> 00:39:41.440]  Then he says I'm fake and I say I'm an actor.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.981]  No video of me saying that.
[00:39:43.401 --> 00:39:44.942]  They'll play clips of me in the news.
[00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:53.853]  Where I'm saying outrageous things as a character, and they say, oh, he really means that, and I'm saying, no, I'm playing a character to illustrate things there, just like Stephen Colbert.
[00:39:54.274 --> 00:40:02.345]  But what I stand for at the end of the day is sovereignty, nationalism, free market, true capitalism, religious freedom, classical liberalism.
[00:40:04.656 --> 00:40:12.278]  Because those people that read off teleprompters and have a bunch of writers and who aren't real, of course they want to say the real man, Alex Jones.
[00:40:12.298 --> 00:40:15.379]  Let's turn the document cam on and scan this studio for folks.
[00:40:15.799 --> 00:40:17.540]  There's a TV I'm looking at.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.260]  There's a computer.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.621]  There's another computer with calls coming in.
[00:40:21.101 --> 00:40:21.841]  Right over here to the right.
[00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:26.722]  Right there you've got the TV screens.
[00:40:27.022 --> 00:40:30.683]  And you've got a call center here where I can take the calls.
[00:40:31.344 --> 00:40:32.564]  That's what I have in here.
[00:40:34.091 --> 00:40:40.236]  I don't have anything else in here, in this little pocket old radio studio I've been in 11 years.
[00:40:42.818 --> 00:40:43.259]  So there you go.
[00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:48.984]  In fact, let's try to, it's up so high, let's try to shoot to the window if we can.
[00:40:49.584 --> 00:40:55.729]  Now let's show people, there's like three guys in there, a totally tiny audience for a radio slash TV show that reaches millions of people.
[00:40:55.749 --> 00:40:56.370]  You guys wave at them.
[00:40:58.268 --> 00:40:58.628]  There you go.
[00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.729]  That's what's in there.
[00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:00.710]  There's no teleprompters.
[00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.511]  There's no riders.
[00:41:01.731 --> 00:41:02.352]  There's no nothing.
[00:41:02.372 --> 00:41:04.113]  It's just me, my intellect, and history.
[00:41:08.858 --> 00:41:11.660]  And then Colbert can do things that nobody else is allowed to.
[00:41:11.941 --> 00:41:15.404]  And so can Bill Maher.
[00:41:15.444 --> 00:41:17.085]  And all I'm saying is that's wrong.
[00:41:17.366 --> 00:41:19.508]  You guys shouldn't call for the end of free speech.
[00:41:19.748 --> 00:41:22.951]  You shouldn't call for censorship all day when you live by it!
[00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:34.300]  I'm being censored by Google, and I'm being blocked on Twitter and YouTube, and they're trying to strangle me while you misrepresent who I am and build a strawman doppelganger to defame me.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.183]  I can't even respond on my own platform.
[00:41:37.643 --> 00:41:43.849]  As radio stations were on, call me and say we're getting calls offering us a half million dollars to take you off by national sponsors.
[00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:49.233]  And a lot of them say, we're going to keep you on even though your show has good ratings but doesn't even bring in close to that money.
[00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:50.634]  We're keeping you on for America.
[00:41:51.114 --> 00:41:54.517]  If you're listening to us on local stations, you better send them $10, $50, $100.
[00:41:55.237 --> 00:41:56.218]  You better thank them.
[00:41:56.418 --> 00:42:00.941]  You better become a local sponsor because there's a total war trying to shut us down.
[00:42:01.162 --> 00:42:02.703]  This is a real fight for America.
[00:42:02.883 --> 00:42:04.824]  This is 21st century information war.
[00:42:05.124 --> 00:42:07.887]  And if they can shut us down, they can shut everybody down.
[00:42:08.607 --> 00:42:15.816]  Let's go out to break with Colbert making his Johnson holster comment that he's under investigation for hate speech by the FCC.
[00:42:16.116 --> 00:42:19.180]  When did the FCC have hate speech jurisdiction?
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:19.761]  Here it is.
[00:42:23.085 --> 00:42:25.928]  Mr. Trump, your presidency, I love your presidency.
[00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:27.811]  I call it disgrace the nation.
[00:42:30.046 --> 00:42:32.307]  You're not the POTUS, you're the BLOTUS.
[00:42:32.587 --> 00:42:33.907]  You're the glutton with a button.
[00:42:34.047 --> 00:42:35.988]  You're a regular gorge Washington.
[00:42:36.568 --> 00:42:37.688]  You're the president.
[00:42:38.009 --> 00:42:40.129]  But, you're turning into a real prick-tator.
[00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:43.530]  Not a dictator, he's elected.
[00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.111]  You attract more skinheads than free Rogaine.
[00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:47.372]  It goes back to the whole race thing.
[00:42:47.392 --> 00:42:49.692]  You have more people marching against you than cancer.
[00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:53.233]  You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head.
[00:42:53.374 --> 00:42:57.415]  In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's c*** holster.
[00:42:58.249 --> 00:42:58.792]  We'll be back.
[00:42:58.812 --> 00:43:00.018]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:00.722]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.142 --> 00:43:05.983]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:06.023 --> 00:43:07.884]  We are under constant attack.
[00:43:08.384 --> 00:43:10.585]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:43:10.765 --> 00:43:13.666]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[00:43:13.706 --> 00:43:28.030]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.352]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:43:30.732 --> 00:43:33.555]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:43:33.575 --> 00:43:34.556]  They don't have that power.
[00:43:35.037 --> 00:43:37.559]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.322]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:43:40.763 --> 00:43:43.606]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:43.626 --> 00:43:45.267]  This is by listener request.
[00:43:45.507 --> 00:43:50.753]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at InfoWarsStore.com in limited supply.
[00:43:50.773 --> 00:43:51.354]  Again,
[00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:57.819]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.564]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:06.988]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:44:09.009 --> 00:44:11.732]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[00:44:11.772 --> 00:44:30.093]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:33.235]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:35.317]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:44:35.677 --> 00:44:37.679]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:49.728]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:44:49.768 --> 00:44:53.270]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:02.193 --> 00:45:05.135]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:45:05.435 --> 00:45:15.041]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:20.524]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:45:20.624 --> 00:45:29.430]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:38.292]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:45:38.552 --> 00:45:45.454]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[00:45:45.594 --> 00:45:50.915]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[00:45:51.175 --> 00:45:56.696]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:56.856 --> 00:46:00.297]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:46:01.137 --> 00:46:09.719]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:09.939 --> 00:46:13.600]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.362]  Armored Piercing FN 5.7 Pistol Rounds.
[00:46:16.582 --> 00:46:18.504]  The secret to Defender body armor.
[00:46:18.724 --> 00:46:24.889]  It is proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:46:25.169 --> 00:46:27.971]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created.
[00:46:28.131 --> 00:46:30.974]  Called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:46:31.034 --> 00:46:33.896]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:46:34.136 --> 00:46:39.957]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:46:40.237 --> 00:46:40.738]  It works.
[00:46:41.018 --> 00:46:49.319]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:46:49.459 --> 00:46:58.862]  Defender Body Armor is now available through Infowarstore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:46:59.222 --> 00:46:59.702]  A total 360 win.
[00:47:05.891 --> 00:47:08.752]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.032 --> 00:47:16.914]  You want answers?
[00:47:16.994 --> 00:47:21.135]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:21.355 --> 00:47:22.976]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:22.996 --> 00:47:25.817]  So, Stephen Colbert has attacked me.
[00:47:25.857 --> 00:47:28.297]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:37.546]  More than 50 times that I know of.
[00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:45.672]  When he was Daily Show, when he was doing CBS, Late Night, taking over David Letterman.
[00:47:45.712 --> 00:47:47.633]  I mean, I don't even watch those shows very often.
[00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:50.235]  What I do, it's very well written, it's very funny.
[00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:53.437]  Even though I'm informed, I mean, I know most of it's complete lies.
[00:47:54.457 --> 00:47:56.859]  Still, I get why people like him.
[00:47:57.539 --> 00:47:59.421]  So in the last month, he's really been attacking me.
[00:48:00.592 --> 00:48:18.366]  I mean, we're talking almost every day, so I'm sending private messages to the character he created, he admits, is based on me, Tuck Buckford, and to his official CBS show, and then to his official Steven at Home site, and no responses.
[00:48:20.348 --> 00:48:21.829]  Obviously, because he's such a God creature.
[00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:25.812]  To me saying, have me on.
[00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:33.152]  I mean, normally, when he's attacking Trump, Trump's been on the show, or he's attacking Bill O'Reilly, Bill O'Reilly's been on a bunch.
[00:48:33.772 --> 00:48:37.554]  I'm this major part of the show, he has a character based on me, and I'm not on.
[00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:42.657]  I'm on with edited clips, which does the same thing.
[00:48:42.977 --> 00:48:44.177]  People go, God, who's Alex Jones?
[00:48:44.197 --> 00:48:45.178]  And then we get more listeners.
[00:48:45.618 --> 00:48:48.279]  I mean, our listeners have only gone up, because those are big shows.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.141]  Mainstream news, mainstream TV, mainstream stuff like that has no viewers.
[00:48:52.742 --> 00:48:55.143]  But Colbert has a big audience.
[00:48:56.684 --> 00:49:01.605]  Super Bowl has a giant audience, and that's where there's the anti-family ads, the anti-gun ads.
[00:49:01.665 --> 00:49:02.646]  I mean, you look at this.
[00:49:02.966 --> 00:49:04.566]  These people are out to get us.
[00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:06.307]  Hollywood is out to get us.
[00:49:07.087 --> 00:49:07.747]  It's incredible.
[00:49:09.607 --> 00:49:11.148]  And they can make whatever jokes they want.
[00:49:11.168 --> 00:49:12.488]  They can make up whatever they want.
[00:49:12.528 --> 00:49:14.849]  They can say that, you know, Trump's having sex with his kids.
[00:49:14.909 --> 00:49:15.649]  It's all okay.
[00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.810]  They can say I'm a racist.
[00:49:21.357 --> 00:49:23.959]  They can say, Trump's a racist, and none of it's true!
[00:49:24.299 --> 00:49:29.583]  And the message is to everybody else, you shut up and do what you're told, or we're going to call you racist!
[00:49:30.204 --> 00:49:34.226]  I remember MSNBC over and over again would say, Alex Jones is deeply racist.
[00:49:34.247 --> 00:49:35.107]  They never show a clip.
[00:49:35.768 --> 00:49:38.650]  It was because I was criticizing Obamacare, a giant screw job!
[00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:49.218]  And so now, can we pull up that article that was Friday, Clifford Cunningham, where the New Yorker magazine openly says they want to overthrow
[00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:51.500]  President Trump?
[00:49:53.061 --> 00:49:55.523]  I did some reports on that on Friday with David Knight.
[00:49:56.104 --> 00:50:03.170]  But here they are in the New Yorker magazine, one of the most elite publications out there, saying, we're secretly meeting to overthrow Trump.
[00:50:04.532 --> 00:50:05.693]  We might just have a coup d'etat.
[00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:09.076]  Well, that's also being prepared by the shadow government.
[00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:11.358]  I mean, forget Trump.
[00:50:11.398 --> 00:50:12.279]  Forget who he is.
[00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:24.812]  They're just calmly reporting on it when he's killing NAFTA, killing GATT, killed TPP, 3 trillion in the stock market, hundreds of billions of new jobs, 500,000 new jobs already here.
[00:50:24.872 --> 00:50:28.154]  I mean, he really is... The globalists have sold us out, folks.
[00:50:28.174 --> 00:50:29.195]  We were the richest country in the world.
[00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:29.995]  We had half the wealth.
[00:50:30.256 --> 00:50:31.797]  He's really turned us back on.
[00:50:33.858 --> 00:50:38.901]  So they have 200 psychologists and psychiatrists violating the Goldwater Rule from 1963.
[00:50:42.095 --> 00:50:44.176]  1964, 68.
[00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:44.176]  It went on three times.
[00:50:44.557 --> 00:50:51.162]  Going on TV saying he's mentally ill when they're not allowed to diagnose from a distance, plus their science is mainly a bunch of quack crap.
[00:50:51.783 --> 00:50:55.146]  It's just a made-up stuff in Germany 200 years ago to control populations.
[00:50:55.466 --> 00:50:57.387]  Sure, is there some labels you put on crazy people?
[00:50:57.628 --> 00:50:58.428]  Are there crazy people?
[00:50:58.468 --> 00:50:58.809]  Yeah!
[00:50:59.069 --> 00:51:03.853]  But psychiatrists and psychologists can't even agree with each other on the hundreds of new designations they've got.
[00:51:06.735 --> 00:51:11.858]  But Trump's crazy because he works his ass off and is a trailblazer and defeated the mainstream media.
[00:51:11.898 --> 00:51:14.059]  No, he's real and they can't stand him.
[00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:15.520]  Does that mean he's not making mistakes?
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.441]  Absolutely not.
[00:51:16.781 --> 00:51:21.183]  Saying Assange should be arrested when Assange put you in office and you said give us more stuff, Assange.
[00:51:21.784 --> 00:51:22.584]  That's dishonorable.
[00:51:25.186 --> 00:51:33.931]  Going with that clear false flag in Syria when the rebels have been caught repeatedly staging chemical attacks on themselves to launch a pretext for war.
[00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:39.132]  I get why you didn't look strong for China and the rest of it, but they're never going to stop saying you're a Russian agent.
[00:51:39.392 --> 00:51:42.675]  Trump tweeted today, Hillary's in bed with the Russians and the Chinese.
[00:51:42.976 --> 00:51:44.357]  Why are they still saying I'm a Russian agent?
[00:51:44.617 --> 00:51:50.603]  Because you're an American out for America and they're globalists, so they're going to say that you are what they are, sir.
[00:51:52.588 --> 00:51:56.469]  Trump's biggest mistake was getting in office, trying to be presidential, trying to bury the hatchet.
[00:51:56.629 --> 00:51:58.290]  They're not going to bury the hatchet with you.
[00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.750]  You can roll over to them, they'll never stop trying to destroy you.
[00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:07.292]  Look at Ivanka, kissing their ass, going over to Germany, saying open the borders up to Muslims, saying her daddy's wrong.
[00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:09.432]  That gets them attacking her more in MSM.
[00:52:09.472 --> 00:52:10.313]  They see weakness.
[00:52:11.033 --> 00:52:13.413]  That's got them saying you have sex with your daughter.
[00:52:13.534 --> 00:52:14.994]  Let's get Bill Maher ready one more time.
[00:52:15.274 --> 00:52:18.455]  For radio listeners, you just kind of hear him making jokes, but he physically, you know,
[00:52:19.355 --> 00:52:21.596]  Implies the act of her having sex with her father.
[00:52:22.176 --> 00:52:22.737]  Oh, daddy.
[00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:26.778]  And on top of her father, you're like, oh, this is a family show.
[00:52:27.038 --> 00:52:32.181]  That's what they're doing on their so-called new show that's politically incorrect, says his old name for it.
[00:52:32.921 --> 00:52:38.563]  Real time, real horseman-er with a little coward reading off a teleprompter with a hundred riders.
[00:52:38.824 --> 00:52:43.966]  Bill Maher, who wants to defame me and Trump and everybody else, but would never dare have us on his show!
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.841]  Why do they want to shut Infowars down?
[00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:48.582]  Because they know we've got a bigger audience than they do.
[00:52:48.863 --> 00:52:53.826]  I'm going to go to John, Abel, Sean, Robert, Jacob, Tony, Jared, Dakota, John and others here in a moment.
[00:52:54.147 --> 00:52:56.208]  Roger Stones on the last 30 minutes of breaking news.
[00:52:56.589 --> 00:53:00.732]  But before I go any further, I know you guys are printing me off that Clifford Cunningham article.
[00:53:01.232 --> 00:53:01.693]  Democrats,
[00:53:02.944 --> 00:53:03.705]  I just need it in here.
[00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:04.525]  I just physically want it.
[00:53:04.545 --> 00:53:04.806]  Thanks.
[00:53:05.646 --> 00:53:10.350]  Headline, Democrats meet in secret in Congress to discuss removal of Trump.
[00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:12.672]  And then the New Yorker magazine discusses the whole thing.
[00:53:12.993 --> 00:53:15.415]  I want you to understand, that's a big deal, folks.
[00:53:16.015 --> 00:53:19.398]  Because if they can remove a president you elected, they can take your pension fund.
[00:53:19.678 --> 00:53:21.980]  And they've already done it in Europe, and they're getting ready here.
[00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:30.007]  And once they've taken over much of your pension fund, once they've done things like that, they think you'll just roll over even more.
[00:53:32.247 --> 00:53:33.647]  They want full control over you.
[00:53:33.687 --> 00:53:34.327]  There it is, report.
[00:53:35.388 --> 00:53:38.008]  Congress holding secret conversations about removing Trump.
[00:53:38.408 --> 00:53:42.229]  Critics pushing impeachment or removal under the 25th Amendment, saying he's mentally ill.
[00:53:42.449 --> 00:53:44.970]  And in the article it says they've got members of his administration.
[00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.690]  Yeah, Jared Kusher, his own daughter.
[00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.910]  They're all scared to death that he actually won.
[00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:50.691]  They're all scared to death this is happening.
[00:53:50.711 --> 00:53:51.671]  They don't know what to do!
[00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:54.171]  The plans of their houses got leaked by the Secret Service!
[00:53:54.392 --> 00:53:55.752]  They better roll over real quick!
[00:53:55.972 --> 00:53:56.352]  Listen!
[00:53:57.551 --> 00:54:01.315]  Kushner and Ivanka, you're all in a man's world now.
[00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:04.678]  Grow a pair of huevos rancheros or be destroyed.
[00:54:04.718 --> 00:54:05.599]  Let me go to that clip again.
[00:54:05.879 --> 00:54:14.868]  Here is Bill Maher putting down the minion that's trying to capitulate and run up a white flag to him.
[00:54:15.209 --> 00:54:16.730]  And he tells her, listen, I'm not a liberal.
[00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.232]  I'm going to bitch slap you, Ivanka.
[00:54:18.632 --> 00:54:21.355]  I'm going to pimp you out, just like pimp game.
[00:54:22.694 --> 00:54:23.754]  Girl's run over by a car.
[00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:25.235]  She's been pimped out to 5,000 men.
[00:54:25.275 --> 00:54:26.055]  She's got diseases.
[00:54:26.356 --> 00:54:27.156]  Hair is all falling out.
[00:54:27.196 --> 00:54:27.836]  Cigarette burns.
[00:54:28.156 --> 00:54:28.977]  She gets hit by a car.
[00:54:29.017 --> 00:54:30.177]  Pimp walks in front of her mama.
[00:54:30.637 --> 00:54:32.918]  She says, baby, I'm gonna get back on that street next week.
[00:54:32.958 --> 00:54:33.939]  I'm gonna get you that money.
[00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:35.439]  He goes, you better, bitch.
[00:54:35.879 --> 00:54:36.640]  The mama says, hey.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.081]  And they ask the pimp, what do you give her?
[00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:41.142]  I give her nothing.
[00:54:42.042 --> 00:54:42.582]  None of the money.
[00:54:42.842 --> 00:54:44.703]  She's lucky I give her a bucket of chicken.
[00:54:45.183 --> 00:54:47.024]  The mama says, look what you did to my baby.
[00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:50.789]  ...punch up on my screen.
[00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:52.670]  1940, Hitler in France visiting Paris.
[00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.210]  Just type in Hitler Visits Paris.
[00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.751]  You can watch the French highling Hitler.
[00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:01.533]  Two weeks after he invaded, the whole French military rolled over to Hitler.
[00:55:01.553 --> 00:55:06.395]  They'd already made backroom deals to run things out of Vichy France, and it's hardly even in the history books now.
[00:55:06.415 --> 00:55:07.216]  It's the same thing.
[00:55:07.236 --> 00:55:11.277]  The French just rolled over to Macron, run by the Germans, run by the globalists.
[00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:12.758]  It's all a big, sick joke.
[00:55:15.191 --> 00:55:16.051]  This isn't even the good footage.
[00:55:16.091 --> 00:55:18.593]  I've seen documentaries with the French lining the roads, Hanlon Hitler.
[00:55:19.153 --> 00:55:19.813]  Look at this right here.
[00:55:19.873 --> 00:55:26.356]  Vichy France is the common name of the French state, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain during World War II.
[00:55:26.696 --> 00:55:31.398]  In particular, it represents the southern unoccupied green zone that governed the southern part of the country.
[00:55:31.818 --> 00:55:38.061]  From 40 to 42, while the Vichy regime was the normal government of France as a whole, Germany militarily occupied northern France.
[00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:41.643]  Thus, the Paris renamed du jour capital of France, Vichy.
[00:55:44.687 --> 00:55:45.447]  They rolled over!
[00:55:45.767 --> 00:55:47.088]  France wasn't in World War II!
[00:55:48.088 --> 00:55:51.069]  But that's not even taught in the kid's old... Oh yeah, let's go back to it.
[00:55:51.089 --> 00:55:53.730]  Here's Hitler visiting Notre Dame in the Capitol.
[00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:57.471]  And we got Hitler visiting Napoleon Bonaparte's grave.
[00:56:01.452 --> 00:56:02.552]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.153]  And that's what the French have done again.
[00:56:05.233 --> 00:56:07.274]  It's capitulated, just like they did during Hitler.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.340]  But see, I'm a weirdo.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.461]  I know facts and history.
[00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:14.242]  So then they teach the pseudo-intellectual fake left and stuff.
[00:56:14.322 --> 00:56:15.402]  Oh, don't be freaked out by him.
[00:56:15.643 --> 00:56:16.323]  He knows all this.
[00:56:16.543 --> 00:56:17.703]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:56:17.923 --> 00:56:19.104]  He made all that up.
[00:56:19.484 --> 00:56:22.245]  Like 15 chimpanzees tied up to typewriters.
[00:56:22.265 --> 00:56:24.746]  It's all just jibble-jabble.
[00:56:25.046 --> 00:56:26.067]  None of it's real.
[00:56:26.627 --> 00:56:28.668]  We're just doing everything we can to shut him down.
[00:56:30.472 --> 00:56:37.136]  Let's go to Bill Maher, the puppet, reading off his written script, saying that Donald Trump has sex with his daughter.
[00:56:37.176 --> 00:56:37.556]  Here it is.
[00:56:37.956 --> 00:56:45.220]  A lot of us thought, oh, Ivanka's going to be our saving grace, you know, when he's about to fucking nuke Finland or something.
[00:56:46.341 --> 00:56:51.564]  She's going to walk into the bedroom and, you know, yeah, daddy, daddy.
[00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:01.727]  Don't do it, Daddy.
[00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:07.494]  That was all done to be controversial.
[00:57:07.534 --> 00:57:08.375]  I had to dump the F word.
[00:57:08.435 --> 00:57:09.196]  I forgot that was in there.
[00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:11.619]  She walks to the bedroom.
[00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:12.741]  She performs sex on him.
[00:57:15.225 --> 00:57:16.446]  Anybody else does that, they're destroyed.
[00:57:16.746 --> 00:57:17.267]  I'm going to go to a break.
[00:57:17.287 --> 00:57:18.407]  I'm going to come right back to your calls.
[00:57:18.427 --> 00:57:19.808]  Give the Colbert Clubs a lot more.
[00:57:19.848 --> 00:57:21.390]  John, Abel, everybody get ready.
[00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:22.090]  Start your engines.
[00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.212]  Second Hour, hey, they're trying to censor us.
[00:57:24.232 --> 00:57:24.952]  They're trying to block us.

[00:58:44.518 --> 00:58:45.558]  I don't feel good.
[00:58:45.638 --> 00:58:49.160]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.042]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:58:52.082 --> 00:58:57.425]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:58:57.885 --> 00:59:00.306]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:04.268]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[00:59:04.389 --> 00:59:06.570]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.990]  I love it.
[00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:09.733]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:59:09.933 --> 00:59:10.914]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:10.954 --> 00:59:16.580]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.522]  It's got a five-star rating.

[00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:28.480]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.581]  Because it's already here.
[00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:30.621]  It's being announced.

[01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:09.117]  Humanity has the power!
[01:00:09.517 --> 01:00:10.698]  We have the power!
[01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:11.718]  You wanna fight?
[01:00:11.938 --> 01:00:13.579]  You better believe you got one!
[01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:20.765]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:21.365 --> 01:00:22.866]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.006 --> 01:00:26.967]  Yeah, a lot of people hear somebody yelling about the people having the power.
[01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:29.268]  That's what created the wealth, the industry, the ideas.
[01:00:29.328 --> 01:00:32.629]  If not, we have stagnant North Korea, our ancient feudalism.
[01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.030]  People hear that and think, oh, that's scary.
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:36.891]  Yeah, freedom is scary, isn't it?
[01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:39.272]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:41.453]  I pulled up more footage of Hitler returns to Germany.
[01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:45.773]  From France and just the French out parading, hailing Hitler.
[01:00:46.113 --> 01:00:49.573]  I found some of the footage I knew I'd seen before of them hailing him.
[01:00:49.593 --> 01:00:51.234]  And I guess they're doing it again for Macron.
[01:00:52.434 --> 01:00:57.035]  I mean, did they steal the election by 30 points against Le Pen?
[01:00:57.115 --> 01:01:01.436]  Or do they really just submit this bad, wanting to be domesticated, scared of freedom?
[01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:03.316]  I hate to run down the French.
[01:01:03.336 --> 01:01:04.356]  They helped us found our country.
[01:01:04.736 --> 01:01:07.957]  They used to be very smart, very warlike, very inventive, very strong people.
[01:01:10.285 --> 01:01:14.107]  But I guess Napoleon killed half their military age men and they just, all the fighters are dead.
[01:01:15.207 --> 01:01:16.628]  French used to be taller than Brits.
[01:01:17.288 --> 01:01:19.949]  Napoleon liked to put the tall guys in the front line to intimidate people.
[01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:21.570]  So I don't blame the French.
[01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:22.830]  They just learned to roll over.
[01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:25.451]  They don't want to have the Brexit.
[01:01:25.471 --> 01:01:26.712]  They want to be ruled by the EU.
[01:01:26.752 --> 01:01:27.512]  They want to be slaves.
[01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:30.473]  They want the socialist parties to be tax exempt and rule over them.
[01:01:31.494 --> 01:01:32.534]  Bondage is their god.
[01:01:32.554 --> 01:01:37.836]  We'll talk to John in Canada, Abel, Sean, Robert, Jacob, Tony, Jared, Dakota.
[01:01:38.276 --> 01:01:39.637]  John, who's up first here?
[01:01:40.523 --> 01:01:41.464]  Let me look at these calls.
[01:01:41.544 --> 01:01:46.667]  Up first, and let's talk to John in Canada about the election in France.
[01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:47.087]  Go ahead.
[01:01:47.968 --> 01:01:52.251]  Greetings from the former People's Republic of Canada with a K. How are you today there, Alex?
[01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:54.732]  You know, I'm just bummed out.
[01:01:55.493 --> 01:01:58.995]  Do you think it was rigged through media control and manipulation or rigged at the ballot box?
[01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:01.077]  I really don't know.
[01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:06.140]  I haven't been following it that close, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was rigged.
[01:02:09.346 --> 01:02:12.407]  It just seems like everything is just going so fast, so crazy.
[01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:15.447]  I really don't know what to say.
[01:02:16.047 --> 01:02:24.089]  They're bringing out nationalism as the big enemy, and they don't want to hook up socialism with that National Socialist ideal, right?
[01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:25.349]  No, they don't.
[01:02:26.189 --> 01:02:36.031]  But that's what's crazy, is that France is now under German control, not the German people, but the Germans are running the EU, and it's just crazy to see France again conquered by Germany.
[01:02:37.031 --> 01:02:37.851]  Yeah.
[01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:43.404]  Another thing is, I'm seeing it all through the media, how everything is nationalistic.
[01:02:43.925 --> 01:02:50.206]  Personally, being nationalistic is, I like my country, I think my leaders should stick up for their country before other countries.
[01:02:50.446 --> 01:02:53.707]  If you're not nationalistic, you're global, then your interests are sold out.
[01:02:53.767 --> 01:02:58.429]  You need the nation to stick up for the people's interests, or you get one-sided deals.
[01:02:58.469 --> 01:03:02.950]  But under globalism, it says don't look out for yourself, be a chump, be an idiot.
[01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:04.111]  Exactly, man.
[01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:12.092]  Even the movie about Einstein, or the series about Einstein, Genius, they're bringing nationalism into that, like, big time.
[01:03:12.453 --> 01:03:16.314]  And, yeah, it was there, but it wasn't socialist.
[01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:20.476]  They're not bringing out the whole socialistic issue of it, you know?
[01:03:20.836 --> 01:03:22.116]  They're vilifying anything.
[01:03:22.156 --> 01:03:27.098]  Like, even in Canada, we've got this series called The Handmaid's Tale, which is just disgusting.
[01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:28.799]  It's propaganda.
[01:03:29.835 --> 01:03:31.935]  You know, you don't see Christians hanging people with cranes.
[01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:34.416]  I was about to say, the Handmaid's Tale is coming back out.
[01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:39.217]  It was a 1980s film with Robert Duvall, where Christians basically act like Islam and enslave women.
[01:03:39.737 --> 01:03:50.479]  And then meanwhile, it's Christianity that empowered women and ended slavery, so they reverse it with new Hollywood movies coming out with interviews about how horrible Christians are putting hoods on women's heads when that's what Islam does.
[01:03:50.499 --> 01:03:51.019]  Don't you love it?
[01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:56.060]  Meanwhile, the feminists are putting on hijabs now, USA Today, in solidarity with Islam.
[01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.386]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:59.646 --> 01:04:03.087]  It's... I just see stuff just going so crazy.
[01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:09.388]  You know, I see people on online forums, like people showing up that haven't been there before, and they're guarding.
[01:04:09.489 --> 01:04:10.429]  They break forum rules.
[01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:12.729]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.650]  You know, all I gotta say is thanks for everything.
[01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:18.091]  You rock.
[01:04:19.031 --> 01:04:20.292]  And can I just add one more thing?
[01:04:20.312 --> 01:04:21.632]  Of course, you're live on air, brother.
[01:04:22.152 --> 01:04:22.532]  Okay, man.
[01:04:23.633 --> 01:04:24.433]  About ten years ago,
[01:04:25.089 --> 01:04:37.475]  You were on one of your famous rants about, you know, having kids and everything else, and you might be a little embarrassed by it, but thanks because I kind of listened to it, and my wife was pressing me to have kids, and I said, well, yeah, let's do it.
[01:04:37.655 --> 01:04:43.158]  Now I got two beautiful children, and you kind of had me take a second look at that, man.
[01:04:43.738 --> 01:04:44.959]  Aren't they the best thing in the world?
[01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:47.169]  Great.
[01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.332]  And they're funny, they're entertaining, they're hilarious.
[01:04:51.014 --> 01:04:53.277]  They're like my best friends, but I'm also their dad.
[01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:55.179]  All I want is a good world for them.
[01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:56.942]  And then you're investing in the future.
[01:04:56.982 --> 01:04:59.325]  By having children, you become humanity.
[01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:01.608]  You then literally merge with it all.
[01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:12.750]  We all know that when the Democratic Party blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever.
[01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:28.557]  But it seems now the Vice President of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group said that according to their analysis, two-thirds of the voters Obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Trump.
[01:05:28.697 --> 01:05:31.979]  So 70% of the reason Hillary Clinton lost
[01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:34.720]  I'm Millie Weaver, for more reports go to InfoWars.com.
[01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:16.629]  Big Brother.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.272]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:18.813 --> 01:06:19.894]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.158]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:22.418 --> 01:06:23.560]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:28.768]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:44.178]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:06:44.198 --> 01:06:46.238]  Hour number two, Roger Stone, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:46.278 --> 01:06:47.138]  We'll continue with your calls.
[01:06:47.158 --> 01:06:49.199]  I want to race through your calls right now.
[01:06:49.679 --> 01:07:00.182]  Macron, the Rothschild banking agent, the Hollande globalist, has won by 65% reportedly in France.
[01:07:00.222 --> 01:07:06.244]  They had their election started on Saturday in a runoff between, of course, Marine Le Pen and himself.
[01:07:07.445 --> 01:07:08.285]  And he's now won.
[01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.646]  Was it a victory of media propaganda?
[01:07:13.595 --> 01:07:15.736]  Because in polls, she was a dead heater ahead of him.
[01:07:17.017 --> 01:07:18.758]  Or have they engaged in massive election fraud?
[01:07:18.778 --> 01:07:19.579]  There's a lot of evidence.
[01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.420]  There's videos on Infowars.com.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:27.224]  There's videos on my Twitter, at RealAlexJones, of the ballots coming in without Marie LePen on them.
[01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:35.369]  Hollande, the outgoing socialist president, said he would use national security to stop LePen being elected.
[01:07:37.005 --> 01:07:42.647]  But think about how nationalists and patriots and populists are now either winning or almost winning everywhere in the world.
[01:07:43.027 --> 01:07:44.628]  We've come a long way.
[01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.048]  Globalism is in crisis.
[01:07:47.409 --> 01:07:48.189]  Alright, Abel.
[01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:49.930]  Let's go to California and talk to Abel.
[01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:50.990]  Abel, you're on the air.
[01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:51.591]  Thanks for calling.
[01:07:52.891 --> 01:07:54.412]  Dude, Alex, the man Jones.
[01:07:54.532 --> 01:07:55.332]  How you doing, man?
[01:07:55.512 --> 01:07:55.592]  Good.
[01:07:55.612 --> 01:07:57.333]  What do you think about the situation in France?
[01:07:58.615 --> 01:08:03.058]  Dude, before I get to that, I know you got a lot of people listening, I hope there are.
[01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:05.719]  So I'm going to tell you this right now, and I'll make it as quick as I can.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.022]  I've been supporting you now for a while now.
[01:08:10.943 --> 01:08:13.384]  I called last time and I'm still blessed to be able to call back.
[01:08:13.764 --> 01:08:15.666]  And I'm sorry about that, I just want to say I am a huge fan.
[01:08:15.686 --> 01:08:16.726]  We're not screening your calls.
[01:08:16.746 --> 01:08:18.848]  A lot of folks call, they want to be screened live on air.
[01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.829]  You're on air right now, go ahead and say what you want.
[01:08:21.906 --> 01:08:22.547]  Thank you, man.
[01:08:22.587 --> 01:08:23.007]  I love it.
[01:08:23.067 --> 01:08:24.990]  First off, you know, it's okay.
[01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:26.832]  I don't want to curse, but you know, it's BS, man.
[01:08:27.152 --> 01:08:27.372]  Okay?
[01:08:27.392 --> 01:08:28.173]  The people were robbed.
[01:08:28.353 --> 01:08:29.535]  The people were straight up robbed.
[01:08:29.555 --> 01:08:29.835]  You know what?
[01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:30.896]  People want to play patty cake.
[01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:31.657]  They want to go ahead and stay.
[01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:32.278]  No, no, no.
[01:08:32.538 --> 01:08:32.979]  You know what?
[01:08:33.019 --> 01:08:33.699]  Enough with that.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.563]  People, I don't know about you, but I am picked up.
[01:08:36.663 --> 01:08:37.704]  I'm tired of this crap.
[01:08:38.044 --> 01:08:40.146]  I'm tired of seeing people being screwed, okay?
[01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:41.527]  I heard you.
[01:08:41.547 --> 01:08:49.152]  I don't know how Le Pen was ahead in the polls, or a dead heat, or behind a little bit, and then she loses by 25 points magically.
[01:08:49.172 --> 01:08:50.753]  I mean, it sounds really suspicious.
[01:08:51.133 --> 01:08:56.037]  But the French have gone into Stockholm Syndrome, you know, before.
[01:08:56.097 --> 01:08:59.419]  They like to be cuckolded, you know, at least in some of their most recent pasts.
[01:08:59.499 --> 01:09:04.643]  But you're saying your gut tells you that the French government or the EU stole the election?
[01:09:06.074 --> 01:09:07.655]  You see, that's what it's always going to come down to.
[01:09:07.695 --> 01:09:11.236]  It's always going to come down to, oh, you know, unless you have the facts, unless you have this, unless you have that.
[01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:12.056]  You know what, man?
[01:09:12.076 --> 01:09:14.977]  We need to look past that little stuff already.
[01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:16.217]  We know what's going on.
[01:09:16.458 --> 01:09:17.558]  We see what's going on.
[01:09:17.798 --> 01:09:23.040]  And any time we go ahead and we play the little game of, oh, you don't have proof, guess what happens with us?
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:23.840]  You know what?
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.420]  No, I hear you.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.240]  We know they've lied.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.021]  We know they've been caught.
[01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:29.622]  We know they were saying that the Brexit was going to fail, but then they actually won.
[01:09:30.482 --> 01:09:31.342]  To pull out of the EU.
[01:09:31.362 --> 01:09:32.783]  The EU was unelected to tyranny.
[01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:33.763]  Thank you so much, Abel.
[01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:34.564]  Good points.
[01:09:35.044 --> 01:09:35.884]  He's super excited.
[01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:38.485]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Chicago.
[01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:39.346]  Sean, you're on the air.
[01:09:39.386 --> 01:09:39.706]  Go ahead.
[01:09:40.806 --> 01:09:41.286]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:41.867 --> 01:09:45.788]  First of all, I want to tell you, back in early March, I blew out my right knee.
[01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:49.430]  I dislocated my knee and I tore out the cartridge.
[01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:52.831]  And the reason I'm saying that is because I've been taking a double dose of the DNA force.
[01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:58.454]  I'm up walking around again, I'm not going to need surgery.
[01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.358]  It's been a lifesaver.
[01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.552]  And they make jokes about our sleep aid knockout.
[01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:19.014]  I invented knockout.
[01:10:19.634 --> 01:10:21.136]  I was buying melatonin for myself.
[01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:22.037]  Sometimes I can't sleep.
[01:10:22.437 --> 01:10:22.597]  It was 1995.
[01:10:22.717 --> 01:10:25.039]  I talked to my big producers.
[01:10:25.059 --> 01:10:27.522]  They said, melatonin is like three bucks for a bottle like that.
[01:10:28.082 --> 01:10:29.384]  And I said, wow, it's all markup.
[01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:30.445]  And they said, yeah.
[01:10:30.885 --> 01:10:34.549]  And I said, well, I noticed melatonin won't knock me out alone.
[01:10:34.589 --> 01:10:39.634]  But I said, if I take L-treptophan or if I take, that's in your meat, or if I take
[01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:43.237]  Valerian root with it when I'm not being able to sleep sometimes.
[01:10:43.577 --> 01:10:44.538]  It totally knocks me out.
[01:10:44.558 --> 01:10:54.485]  I said, can we add L-tryptophan, valerian root, and the same dose of melatonin with lemon balm, chamomile, and a key acid that accelerates together?
[01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:55.566]  And the scientist said, yes.
[01:10:55.966 --> 01:10:56.847]  So we produced a 1995 sleep aid.
[01:10:59.008 --> 01:11:00.649]  That is changing the world.
[01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:04.372]  In fact, I've got major folks wanting to put it in grocery stores right now.
[01:11:04.812 --> 01:11:06.853]  No one thought to put all this together.
[01:11:07.193 --> 01:11:10.976]  It's $15 right now discounted at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:11:10.996 --> 01:11:12.817]  So thank you for saying you like DNA Force.
[01:11:12.837 --> 01:11:14.018]  DNA Force is not $15.
[01:11:14.158 --> 01:11:17.880]  It's a lot more because there's like 50 bucks a product in just one thing in it.
[01:11:18.281 --> 01:11:21.283]  The Bio PQQ is from the Japanese Mishimishi America.
[01:11:21.563 --> 01:11:24.044]  It's the only one that's organically produced by Organic.
[01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:24.665]  It's actually
[01:11:25.305 --> 01:11:26.126]  I can't speak to
[01:11:54.241 --> 01:11:55.802]  I can't speak to what other people say.
[01:11:55.822 --> 01:11:56.822]  You're an actor and all that.
[01:11:56.862 --> 01:11:59.863]  I have a feeling that, um, that's part of their shtick.
[01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.924]  But, um... But it doesn't matter!
[01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:04.345]  I'm up here covering real issues, and I'm the Easter Bunny!
[01:12:04.585 --> 01:12:05.685]  Of course I'm not an actor!
[01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:07.926]  But here's what they do.
[01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:14.128]  I'll do some outrageous deal, you know, in a lizard suit or as the Joker, and they go, oh my God, do you really believe kids should die?
[01:12:14.508 --> 01:12:18.750]  And I go, no, I'm saying I'm the joker, take your vaccines, drink your fluoride, you're gonna die.
[01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:19.550]  I'm being an actor.
[01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:20.971]  Then they go, oh, you're an actor.
[01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:26.373]  And I go, yes, 10% of the time, 5% of the time, it's very clear when I'm doing a skit.
[01:12:26.473 --> 01:12:27.894]  Don't people understand satire?
[01:12:31.297 --> 01:12:33.218]  Before I get to my point... I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:33.778]  I apologize.
[01:12:33.798 --> 01:12:34.098]  Go ahead.
[01:12:34.398 --> 01:12:37.240]  Before I get to my point, I'll prove I'm not an actor.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.622]  I'm also a Prime membership subscriber.
[01:12:40.842 --> 01:12:42.123]  I think that could be improved.
[01:12:42.723 --> 01:12:44.164]  I think that could be greatly improved.
[01:12:44.284 --> 01:12:48.086]  But the TNA enforcement knockout, I just got that from your... No, no, you're right.
[01:12:48.106 --> 01:12:51.648]  We launched the paid app and I just haven't done a lot of the live feeds and stuff.
[01:12:51.928 --> 01:12:52.728]  We're gonna add to that.
[01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:53.449]  I apologize.
[01:12:54.858 --> 01:12:57.080]  Let me get to my point about Colbert and Kimball.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.041]  I know some of those guys from back in the day.
[01:12:59.061 --> 01:13:03.184]  I was involved in comedy and that was my hobby in college.
[01:13:06.327 --> 01:13:10.570]  My deal was you could submit jokes to these shows.
[01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.811]  I would do that and my friends would do that.
[01:13:12.831 --> 01:13:14.513]  I know people that were writers on the shows.
[01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:16.254]  I still know people that are writers now.
[01:13:19.073 --> 01:13:23.594]  You can submit jokes, and if you get a joke that got in, you get like $88 or something.
[01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:31.797]  So I would do that, but back in the 80s, and this is to get my point about Colbert and why he's been goofing on you so much.
[01:13:31.857 --> 01:13:35.458]  Back in the 80s, Johnny Carson had 20 million people watching.
[01:13:35.818 --> 01:13:42.960]  Then you had Leno and Letterman back in the 90s and 2000s, and it was like 8 and 10 million people watching those shows.
[01:13:43.829 --> 01:13:48.554]  Now you have two, two and a half million people watching I'm Calibera at night.
[01:13:48.894 --> 01:13:49.515]  That's nothing.
[01:13:49.575 --> 01:13:51.256]  It's like 10% of what Carson did.
[01:13:51.396 --> 01:13:55.160]  They're making $50,000 a spot, which is nothing.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.341]  The show's not profitable.
[01:13:57.282 --> 01:14:05.710]  And then on those late night shows, what you don't realize is every minute they have ratings, because every minute somebody's turned the show off to go to bed.
[01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:15.116]  And able to make it to that first commercial spot and that second commercial spot, what they have to do is get people to keep the televisions on and not turn it off.
[01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:25.341]  And what better way to do that than to goof on you and maybe get a half million people that listen to you out of the 40-50 million people to watch you every night?
[01:14:26.397 --> 01:14:29.699]  It's increasing their ad revenues, and it's getting people to watch.
[01:14:29.759 --> 01:14:30.800]  That's what they're doing.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.560]  You're absolutely right.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.381]  The whole corporate media is a shadow of its former self.
[01:14:34.702 --> 01:14:38.604]  But when they play the Colbert clips on every other news channel, then it becomes big.
[01:14:38.844 --> 01:14:42.686]  But they're only big when they're political, and then that doesn't even help their advertisers.
[01:14:42.726 --> 01:14:44.627]  It helps the other shows that are playing it.
[01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:45.768]  So that's my point, is that...
[01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:48.874]  I don't need Colbert, he needs me.
[01:14:48.914 --> 01:14:55.417]  We really do have 3 or 4 million people a day tuning in to the syndicated show weekdays, a couple million to the Sunday show.
[01:14:55.677 --> 01:14:57.598]  Then all the derivatives, it's huge.
[01:14:58.038 --> 01:15:10.684]  So there's this paradigm where his show isn't big, but when it goes on all the other shows it is big, but they only put him on the other shows when he says something horrible about myself or others to hurt me.
[01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:12.345]  So then how do I respond to that?
[01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:17.219]  To be honest, I just do it on him.
[01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:20.906]  I mean, Alex, you could do his comedy.
[01:15:20.946 --> 01:15:22.789]  You could do the same jokes funnier than he can.
[01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.252]  I don't think he's very funny.
[01:15:24.272 --> 01:15:25.574]  I never thought he was very funny.
[01:15:25.594 --> 01:15:26.155]  I saw him on the 9.
[01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:27.798]  He was kind of desperate and pathetic.
[01:15:29.131 --> 01:15:32.273]  Sure, I mean, I'm trying to sound nice when I say he comes off as a nice guy.
[01:15:32.293 --> 01:15:33.794]  The thing is, I don't hate him individually.
[01:15:34.295 --> 01:15:47.304]  I just, it's weird to be attacked constantly, and then they even say that they're you, and then you don't get a... It's like they're saying I'm a Russian spy in Congress, having Defense Department hearings in the House Armed Services Committee, and then no one calls me to the committee.
[01:15:47.344 --> 01:15:51.948]  It's like, you know, it's like I'm a Russian agent, but no proof, and I can't go to the committee?
[01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:53.249]  It's just like crazy.
[01:15:53.289 --> 01:15:53.949]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.071]  And yes, I need to update the new app.
[01:15:56.091 --> 01:15:56.951]  We're gonna do more on that.
[01:15:57.031 --> 01:15:57.732]  You're absolutely right.
[01:16:02.094 --> 01:16:05.957]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:05.997 --> 01:16:07.859]  We are under constant attack.
[01:16:08.339 --> 01:16:10.541]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[01:16:10.741 --> 01:16:13.624]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[01:16:13.664 --> 01:16:28.016]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[01:16:28.696 --> 01:16:30.318]  They can't get to us that way.
[01:16:30.698 --> 01:16:33.521]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:34.522]  They don't have that power.
[01:16:34.983 --> 01:16:37.525]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[01:16:37.886 --> 01:16:40.288]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:43.592]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.233]  This is by listener request.
[01:16:45.473 --> 01:16:50.719]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:51.320]  Again,
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:57.783]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[01:16:58.203 --> 01:17:02.504]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[01:17:03.105 --> 01:17:06.946]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[01:17:08.967 --> 01:17:11.689]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:30.124]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com, with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack, because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:17:30.464 --> 01:17:33.285]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[01:17:33.325 --> 01:17:35.347]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[01:17:35.707 --> 01:17:37.708]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[01:17:38.148 --> 01:17:49.774]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[01:17:49.794 --> 01:17:53.636]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:02.293 --> 01:18:11.684]  On Sunday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told the Daily News that he will let the fearless girl statue remain in place for the next year, proving that women can achieve great things, if a man allows it.
[01:18:12.625 --> 01:18:18.870]  The statue was installed in March of this year, a stark and challenging contrast to the charging bull statue that's long been the symbol of Wall Street.
[01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:24.554]  The defiant little girl quickly became a sensation, and perhaps unwittingly, the perfect symbol for modern feminism.
[01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:34.762]  For while the bull represents America's animalistic power, the force and energy of an untamed free market, it's now being challenged and defied by a self-important little girl who insists on being the center of attention.
[01:18:35.322 --> 01:18:48.127]  I don't want to sound like a misogynist, but I can't help but think that if a man had been involved in the statue's creation, he could have used his naturally superior reasoning and spatial awareness to suggest that the fearless girl be installed perhaps riding on top of the bull or leading the bull in a charge.
[01:18:48.487 --> 01:18:52.449]  You know, contributing to American prosperity rather than standing in opposition to it.
[01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:58.174]  But I digress, because whatever its symbolism, the installation depicting an imminent mauling is here to stay.
[01:18:58.654 --> 01:19:00.676]  And it's inspiring women all over New York.
[01:19:01.056 --> 01:19:04.479]  Not to create statues of their own, of course, but to insist that others do it for them.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:11.605]  According to the New York Post, quote, female elected officials on Monday called on the city to add more statues of women around the five boroughs.
[01:19:12.026 --> 01:19:15.269]  Because why do something yourself when you can just demand the city do it for you?
[01:19:15.969 --> 01:19:21.913]  Women don't see themselves represented in the streets of New York, said Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer.
[01:19:22.334 --> 01:19:25.976]  We have sculptures and art of a lot of men, and that needs to change.
[01:19:26.716 --> 01:19:27.797]  Well, I agree with Ms.
[01:19:27.837 --> 01:19:31.820]  Brewer, and I say it's a crying shame that there are no prominent statues of women in New York.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.643]  No enduring symbol of the city itself, as well as America as a whole.
[01:19:35.963 --> 01:19:40.407]  There's nothing that can be called the most famous, recognizable, and well-loved monument in the world.
[01:19:40.467 --> 01:19:43.049]  No masterpiece of artistry and engineering.
[01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:52.296]  A humble and stoic goddess, crafted in epic proportions, meant to not just embody our most highly cherished virtues, but to declare them to the world.
[01:19:53.196 --> 01:19:54.878]  I really think the city could use something like that.
[01:19:55.898 --> 01:19:56.859]  But only if it's a girl.
[01:19:57.199 --> 01:19:58.180]  That's the important part.
[01:19:59.281 --> 01:20:01.423]  This has been Harrison Smith for InfoWars.com.
[01:20:06.391 --> 01:20:10.852]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:21.336]  Big Brother.
[01:20:21.376 --> 01:20:23.236]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:23.336 --> 01:20:24.356]  You want answers?
[01:20:24.757 --> 01:20:25.857]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:28.310]  You want answers?
[01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:29.551]  So do we!
[01:20:29.611 --> 01:20:30.451]  So does he.
[01:20:31.211 --> 01:20:33.152]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:20:33.512 --> 01:20:35.293]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:36.013 --> 01:20:37.473]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.054 --> 01:20:41.895]  Alright, I'm gonna go right back to your phone calls.
[01:20:41.995 --> 01:20:42.715]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:20:42.735 --> 01:20:46.276]  To Tony, then Robert, then Jacob, then Dakota, John, and others.
[01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:48.037]  These callers are great, though.
[01:20:48.057 --> 01:20:49.197]  They're making a lot of really good points.
[01:20:51.258 --> 01:20:53.139]  I haven't talked a lot about Colbert and all the rest of it.
[01:20:53.159 --> 01:20:54.899]  It's just that they're constantly attacking me.
[01:20:55.319 --> 01:20:56.600]  They're constantly lying about me.
[01:20:58.155 --> 01:21:02.157]  They're constantly lying about you, and then they get away with stuff that nobody else would.
[01:21:02.177 --> 01:21:05.758]  They're the big liberal censors that want to censor everybody.
[01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:09.300]  But then they don't get censored, and I'm not calling for them to get censored.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.281]  It's just, he's all defiant.
[01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:14.942]  I'll call whoever I want, such and such.
[01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:20.064]  I call a congressman that, and they say, shut Alex Jones off the air for his homophobic slurs.
[01:21:20.824 --> 01:21:27.627]  When I meant it just like Colbert did, saying that Congressman Peter Schiff is the establishment's minion.
[01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:31.751]  When I called him a butt boy, that's what I meant.
[01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:36.433]  Everybody knows what butt boy or such and such sucker means.
[01:21:36.513 --> 01:21:38.575]  It means you're on the payroll.
[01:21:38.755 --> 01:21:39.675]  You're a patsy.
[01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:40.316]  You're a minion.
[01:21:40.336 --> 01:21:40.976]  You're a puppet.
[01:21:44.438 --> 01:21:50.742]  And if I can't use colorful language that everybody else uses on mainline television, then what planet are we on?
[01:21:50.982 --> 01:21:52.823]  But again, you don't want to compete with me.
[01:21:59.008 --> 01:22:01.409]  Let's go to Tony in Nevada.
[01:22:01.889 --> 01:22:02.750]  Thanks for holding, Tony.
[01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:03.230]  You're on the air.
[01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:03.590]  Go ahead.
[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:06.171]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:22:06.191 --> 01:22:13.795]  I've been a listener and supporter since 2003, and I think I have some exciting news despite the election results in France.
[01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:18.096]  On the truth or front, some exciting things happening, if I could share that with you real quickly.
[01:22:20.106 --> 01:22:27.049]  I have been led by the Lord to be a part of a coalition of programmers and designers of games.
[01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:29.890]  Many of them have worked on titles such as Call of Duty.
[01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:33.511]  Our artist and animator works with Scott Cawthon.
[01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:34.932]  He has Five Nights at Freddy's fame.
[01:22:36.432 --> 01:22:42.374]  We've pulled together a team of guys who are creating the first ever anti-Illuminati New World Order game.
[01:22:42.534 --> 01:22:46.276]  It'll be downloadable to Steam, Google Play, the iStore.
[01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:47.058]  Please!
[01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:52.527]  All right, thank you.
[01:22:52.547 --> 01:22:58.170]  These are Christian programmers, so we're headed up under the title Jesus is Lord Games.
[01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:00.572]  It's www.jilgames.com.
[01:23:00.592 --> 01:23:05.355]  You can go see a preview, a short preview video, and then click over to... Say that slowly.
[01:23:05.455 --> 01:23:06.116]  Jesus is Lord.
[01:23:06.136 --> 01:23:06.616]  I'm so sorry.
[01:23:06.896 --> 01:23:07.837]  Jesus is Lord.
[01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:09.138]  I love to say that anyways.
[01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:09.998]  It's so politically correct.
[01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:10.258]  I'm so sorry.
[01:23:10.599 --> 01:23:12.300]  Jesusislordgames.com.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:12.580]  Yes.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.383]  www.jilgames.com.
[01:23:17.423 --> 01:23:19.164]  Thank you, Alex, for even letting us mention it.
[01:23:19.184 --> 01:23:21.486]  Let's stop one thing.
[01:23:22.086 --> 01:23:23.207]  I'm honored to have you call.
[01:23:23.247 --> 01:23:23.788]  Let's just stop.
[01:23:24.228 --> 01:23:24.688]  I'm honored.
[01:23:24.788 --> 01:23:25.469]  You're the show.
[01:23:25.529 --> 01:23:27.330]  You put up with me, okay?
[01:23:28.051 --> 01:23:33.755]  And because look, nobody's perfect, but even a guy that's decent like me, you're on the air hours a day, you're gonna say some stuff that's really obnoxious.
[01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:34.896]  So here's the deal.
[01:23:36.451 --> 01:23:39.712]  We're going to change culture by radio, TV, art, literature.
[01:23:40.492 --> 01:23:50.375]  It's patriots with all the new liberty-based video games that are coming out and the truly Christian films that are coming out that are outgrossing Hollywood that are financially about to break their back.
[01:23:50.755 --> 01:23:52.135]  We have to build our culture.
[01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:53.876]  We have to vote with our dollars.
[01:23:53.916 --> 01:24:02.558]  We have to support the truth and build something greater out of that by building an economy, building an ark, building a remnant, building a future.
[01:24:02.598 --> 01:24:05.779]  So don't thank me for letting you plug a video game.
[01:24:06.159 --> 01:24:12.103]  I want to have video games I can play with my children that are dynamic, that are professional, but are also truth-based.
[01:24:12.163 --> 01:24:13.524]  So, I'm so excited.
[01:24:13.564 --> 01:24:18.468]  Tell me about JesusIsLord.com, J-I-L.com, this new video game.
[01:24:18.668 --> 01:24:19.428]  J-I-L Games.
[01:24:19.508 --> 01:24:20.149]  Yeah, I'm so sorry.
[01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:23.191]  J-I-L Games.com, but Alex, react please.
[01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:25.012]  So it's G-I-G?
[01:24:25.052 --> 01:24:26.813]  Sorry, I deeply apologize.
[01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:28.635]  Yeah, J-I-L as in Jesus.
[01:24:28.695 --> 01:24:31.737]  J-I-L Games, all one word, dot com.
[01:24:32.555 --> 01:24:35.298]  And we actually want this to bless InfoWars.
[01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:39.522]  Part of what we want to do is take a third, at least a third of the money made from this game, maybe more.
[01:24:39.883 --> 01:24:42.325]  We're seeking God on that and everyone else in the trade community.
[01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:44.127]  We've been wanting to get a hold of you desperately.
[01:24:45.088 --> 01:24:47.951]  We want this to benefit, we want to sting them back.
[01:24:48.091 --> 01:24:50.454]  One of our programmers said, let's poke the dragon in the eye.
[01:24:50.854 --> 01:24:56.399]  With what they're doing to you, Alex, at InfoWars, with trying to cut the advertising, they're going after drudge.
[01:24:56.479 --> 01:24:58.621]  It's obvious that we're in a fight for our lives.
[01:24:59.142 --> 01:25:00.643]  There's no doubt we're in a fight for our lives.
[01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:00.923]  That's right.
[01:25:00.943 --> 01:25:07.209]  The attack we're under in the last year is as much as I had in 22 years previous, all in just a few months.
[01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.830]  And it's exponential.
[01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:14.676]  But the great thing is, as bad as it gets, and it's hard, every time doors close, other doors open.
[01:25:14.716 --> 01:25:16.878]  And I've got faith in God, so don't worry about me.
[01:25:18.103 --> 01:25:19.644]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:23.727]  Our hope was, anyway, just a thought that we've been wanting to fight is to supplement.
[01:25:23.787 --> 01:25:24.428]  Well, that's exciting!
[01:25:24.468 --> 01:25:26.909]  Tell folks about Jesus' Lord Games and this new game.
[01:25:26.929 --> 01:25:32.333]  The game is called The Secret of Acadian Island, and we're right now trying to pull together funds.
[01:25:32.353 --> 01:25:39.798]  We've got the game about 20% done, and like I say, a lot of these guys have worked on Call of Duty, Five Nights at Freddy's before, you know, Scott Cawthon got huge.
[01:25:39.818 --> 01:25:45.722]  Our animator worked with him for years, because that's like a billion-dollar franchise right now, Five Nights at Freddy's.
[01:25:46.062 --> 01:25:49.583]  But anyway, our animation, our games are going to be powerful.
[01:25:49.843 --> 01:25:53.804]  The storyline God had given me a long time ago is a script I tried to get to Mel Gibson about 2000.
[01:25:53.884 --> 01:26:06.368]  We're using that as the base for the game, and in there we're wanting desperately to connect with individuals such as yourself and others, and we will literally take directly from the headlines as your character is going through the game.
[01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:08.449]  You're going to be dropped into an island.
[01:26:08.469 --> 01:26:12.030]  There's a secret underground that you're a part of, and this is based on reality right now.
[01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:16.576]  Because you've had Steve Quill and other people on and I've talked personally with some of the people you've had.
[01:26:16.596 --> 01:26:18.358]  Shows the whole breakaway civilization.
[01:26:18.859 --> 01:26:21.543]  Above ground, below ground, you name it.
[01:26:22.273 --> 01:26:26.874]  Yeah, there's a lot of military out there that love this country and that have stood up at the highest levels.
[01:26:26.994 --> 01:26:28.295]  And you've interviewed them, okay?
[01:26:28.335 --> 01:26:30.835]  You've interviewed them just as others have, right?
[01:26:31.216 --> 01:26:33.076]  And that's what this is based on.
[01:26:33.116 --> 01:26:34.156]  Listen, let's do this.
[01:26:34.597 --> 01:26:35.457]  Let me put you on hold.
[01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.218]  The main producer, Nico Acosta, is out there.
[01:26:38.698 --> 01:26:39.858]  He will get your information.
[01:26:39.898 --> 01:26:40.638]  We'll look at the game.
[01:26:40.978 --> 01:26:42.799]  This is the exact type of stuff I need.
[01:26:43.599 --> 01:26:43.799]  I don't
[01:27:05.922 --> 01:27:07.043]  Will this game save the world?
[01:27:07.123 --> 01:27:09.984]  No, but all of us together will, with God's help.
[01:27:10.284 --> 01:27:10.744]  Thank you, Tony.
[01:27:10.764 --> 01:27:11.745]  We'll put you on hold.
[01:27:12.145 --> 01:27:14.326]  Okay, let's go to Robert in California.
[01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:17.127]  He wants to talk about self-censoring culture.
[01:27:17.768 --> 01:27:18.568]  That's a great point.
[01:27:18.968 --> 01:27:19.308]  Go ahead.
[01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:21.810]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:27.592]  Listen, I think they are pushing our buttons to where we are self-censoring.
[01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:34.916]  When Colbert said President Trump is a Johnson holster, he's calling all of us who voted for President Trump one.
[01:27:35.538 --> 01:27:38.339]  In the movie, America... Yeah, you're saying we're all minions of Putin.
[01:27:38.819 --> 01:27:41.779]  They said French that don't want to be under EU control or Russian agents.
[01:27:42.199 --> 01:27:44.960]  Chris, when do the Russians become God and run everything?
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.720]  I don't want to be under George Soros.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.800]  Forget the Russians.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.161]  If the Russians were in my business, I'd be in their face.
[01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:57.522]  My God, if the Russians themselves were as popular as they say they are, they're already taking over the world.
[01:27:57.662 --> 01:27:58.342]  Exactly!
[01:27:58.362 --> 01:28:01.603]  Now, getting back to my statement here,
[01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:07.074]  In the movie American President, Dreyfuss' character attacks the President's girlfriend.
[01:28:07.135 --> 01:28:09.596]  I don't know if you're familiar with the movie or not.
[01:28:09.716 --> 01:28:09.956]  Yes.
[01:28:10.537 --> 01:28:15.700]  He comes up to the podium at the end of the movie and he starts rattling off this whole thing.
[01:28:16.201 --> 01:28:22.445]  President Trump needs to step up to the news podium and dot their I's on live TV.
[01:28:22.985 --> 01:28:24.887]  We need to rise to the challenge.
[01:28:25.527 --> 01:28:26.408]  CBS, right?
[01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:28.449]  Isn't that... Robert, Robert, stay there.
[01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.430]  I'm going to come back to you after the break.
[01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:30.330]  I want you, like, stay there.
[01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.991]  Don't hang up, okay?
[01:28:32.352 --> 01:28:32.692]  Promise?
[01:28:33.752 --> 01:28:34.052]  Promise.
[01:28:34.072 --> 01:28:36.613]  All right, we're coming back to Robert, then to Roger Stone and more calls.
[01:28:37.593 --> 01:28:41.214]  Buckley, my great cousin, he's been off and on in Fort Worth 22 years.
[01:28:41.574 --> 01:28:45.295]  He grabbed me by the shoulders before I went on air about 30 minutes before I went on air about two hours ago.
[01:28:45.315 --> 01:28:48.836]  And he said, Trump's problem is he isn't candidate Trump.
[01:28:49.136 --> 01:28:50.036]  He's trying to be presidential.
[01:28:50.156 --> 01:28:51.256]  He's got to go on the offense.
[01:28:51.556 --> 01:28:52.156]  They're his enemy.
[01:28:52.216 --> 01:28:52.977]  Get in there and tell them.
[01:28:53.797 --> 01:28:54.797]  And I said, you're absolutely right.
[01:28:54.917 --> 01:28:55.977]  And so let's talk about that.
[01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.138]  That's what Buckley's saying.
[01:28:57.158 --> 01:28:57.978]  That's what Robert's saying.
[01:28:57.998 --> 01:28:58.718]  That's what you're saying.
[01:29:12.142 --> 01:29:20.064]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:29:20.104 --> 01:29:22.065]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[01:29:22.825 --> 01:29:29.727]  We could easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[01:29:30.327 --> 01:29:36.109]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20 because we private label some, but we also develop
[01:29:37.012 --> 01:29:46.781]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:47.122]  Exactly.
[01:29:47.142 --> 01:29:48.944]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:29:48.964 --> 01:29:52.287]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[01:29:52.347 --> 01:29:53.608]  We've both talked to them.
[01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:59.794]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground, and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[01:30:00.154 --> 01:30:09.123]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:30:09.984 --> 01:30:11.105]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:30:11.445 --> 01:30:12.346]  We refuse to do that.
[01:30:12.726 --> 01:30:15.389]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:30:15.469 --> 01:30:17.451]  We're producing something we want to take.
[01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:17.911]  Exactly.
[01:30:18.031 --> 01:30:19.312]  We're looking for the best.
[01:30:19.373 --> 01:30:24.237]  We went out and searched for the best to private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[01:30:24.437 --> 01:30:28.100]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:34.105]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[01:30:34.205 --> 01:30:35.586]  It's everywhere.
[01:30:35.786 --> 01:30:36.447]  It's in nature.
[01:30:36.507 --> 01:30:38.529]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[01:30:38.989 --> 01:30:45.014]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[01:30:46.195 --> 01:30:51.457]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[01:30:51.477 --> 01:30:52.118]  This is insane.
[01:30:52.138 --> 01:30:58.760]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, OK, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000?
[01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:01.302]  And then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[01:31:01.342 --> 01:31:02.202]  People will buy more of it.
[01:31:02.222 --> 01:31:03.162]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[01:31:03.382 --> 01:31:04.803]  OK, compare that to this.
[01:31:05.023 --> 01:31:06.404]  This is a $50 product.
[01:31:06.524 --> 01:31:09.705]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[01:31:09.725 --> 01:31:09.945]  OK, we have 10,000.
[01:31:10.025 --> 01:31:10.445]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[01:31:14.087 --> 01:31:15.929]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[01:31:16.349 --> 01:31:21.594]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[01:31:21.614 --> 01:31:25.478]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:31.864]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[01:31:32.975 --> 01:31:34.596]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[01:31:34.676 --> 01:31:35.776]  It's changed my life.
[01:31:35.856 --> 01:31:38.097]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[01:31:38.438 --> 01:31:40.319]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[01:31:40.719 --> 01:31:42.179]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[01:31:42.219 --> 01:31:43.080]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:51.044]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[01:31:51.424 --> 01:31:52.204]  It's a win-win.
[01:31:52.684 --> 01:31:53.445]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:33:05.803 --> 01:33:08.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.891 --> 01:33:20.236]  Got a number 13 tattooed on my back.
[01:33:23.624 --> 01:33:28.789]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:31.612]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.414 --> 01:33:37.458]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[01:33:41.342 --> 01:33:45.626]  I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.
[01:33:49.525 --> 01:34:00.373]  We're going to Roger Stone.
[01:34:00.393 --> 01:34:11.041]  We're getting on the line right now, here in a moment.
[01:34:11.061 --> 01:34:14.103]  But I had already had him on about this topic, so I'm glad this caller called in.
[01:34:14.303 --> 01:34:15.804]  Robert, California.
[01:34:16.265 --> 01:34:17.706]  About what Trump needs to do.
[01:34:19.591 --> 01:34:26.357]  Talking to my crew earlier today, Trump, the candidate, was hardcore, brazen, politically incorrect.
[01:34:27.938 --> 01:34:35.725]  But he's taken that fire-breathing patriot and muzzled it about 90%.
[01:34:35.966 --> 01:34:39.669]  There's still rays of sunshine coming in.
[01:34:45.765 --> 01:34:49.828]  I see the media attacking him and his family, trying to bully his aides into submission.
[01:34:50.248 --> 01:34:55.092]  Trump won't give in, but he's like a rock out in the middle of the ocean with big waves hitting him.
[01:34:55.112 --> 01:34:59.195]  He's standing strong for thousands of years, and thousands more to come.
[01:34:59.935 --> 01:35:02.677]  If you looked at it as a metaphor, but the people around him are like sand.
[01:35:02.917 --> 01:35:03.858]  They're collapsing.
[01:35:04.138 --> 01:35:04.959]  They're flowing away.
[01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:11.003]  Jared Kushner's on the Communist Chinese payroll, his daughter Ivanka thinking she's the president.
[01:35:14.925 --> 01:35:18.007]  Bill Maher jokes a few days later that she's having sex with her dad.
[01:35:19.328 --> 01:35:20.209]  Think of the Democrats.
[01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:24.732]  I saw Republicans saying things like that.
[01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:29.396]  If I got up here and said Obama was having sex with his daughters, I'm not saying that.
[01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:32.579]  The media is so corrupt they'll probably edit that out and say I did.
[01:35:33.199 --> 01:35:40.445]  Just imagine that these weasels like Bill Maher reading off teleprompters with a huge writing staff and Stephen Colbert's a joke.
[01:35:41.172 --> 01:35:43.433]  Roger Stone will give us his take on what Trump should do.
[01:35:43.474 --> 01:35:44.714]  Another breaking news here in a few minutes.
[01:35:44.734 --> 01:35:46.515]  But finishing up with Robert in California.
[01:35:46.535 --> 01:35:47.996]  You were getting started before we went to break.
[01:35:48.597 --> 01:35:49.938]  What does Donald Trump need to do?
[01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:53.039]  He needs to take the gloves off and become the man we all loved again.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.141]  He's gotten so much done that's good.
[01:35:55.421 --> 01:35:56.542]  TPP killed.
[01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:58.123]  Killing Nafta and GATT.
[01:35:58.163 --> 01:35:59.163]  Being strong with China.
[01:35:59.523 --> 01:36:01.585]  Taking out ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:36:02.748 --> 01:36:04.149]  Three trillion in the stock market.
[01:36:04.449 --> 01:36:06.370]  Three hundred billion in new jobs.
[01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:07.951]  Half a million new jobs.
[01:36:08.651 --> 01:36:10.032]  I mean, he's an American president.
[01:36:10.072 --> 01:36:10.693]  That's why they hate him.
[01:36:10.713 --> 01:36:12.754]  He's not perfect, but he's an American.
[01:36:12.954 --> 01:36:14.135]  He's making the decisions.
[01:36:14.395 --> 01:36:15.155]  He's doing it.
[01:36:15.335 --> 01:36:20.598]  And all these enemies that thought we were broke back and who tried to stop him, they've been proven to be frauds.
[01:36:20.658 --> 01:36:22.419]  The media, all of them, and their fake polls.
[01:36:22.739 --> 01:36:23.980]  That's why I'm backing Trump.
[01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:26.722]  Because I know he's for real and they hate it.
[01:36:27.342 --> 01:36:28.923]  Think about how bad Hillary would be right now.
[01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:31.144]  But that said, we're loyal opposition.
[01:36:31.164 --> 01:36:32.145]  We're going to keep him true.
[01:36:32.958 --> 01:36:33.278]  And now...
[01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:57.132]  All of us eat on C-SPAN, talk radio, you name it.
[01:36:57.492 --> 01:36:59.852]  Not just when I rarely talk to him or Roger talks to him.
[01:37:00.172 --> 01:37:01.152]  Communicate to him.
[01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:02.793]  A man surrounded by hyenas.
[01:37:03.153 --> 01:37:05.033]  A lion under attack by the wolves.
[01:37:06.274 --> 01:37:08.554]  It's more, we should drain this Trump locally.
[01:37:08.934 --> 01:37:09.994]  What should Trump do?
[01:37:10.154 --> 01:37:11.315]  What should we do?
[01:37:11.615 --> 01:37:12.475]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:37:12.495 --> 01:37:16.816]  Like I was saying, Alex, we need to rise to the challenge.
[01:37:17.096 --> 01:37:21.237]  I tried to call in the other day and I missed it by just that much.
[01:37:21.761 --> 01:37:30.668]  Listen, you're saying, and I feel you, I really do, you're saying that if we're not getting involved, maybe we do want them to rule over us.
[01:37:31.168 --> 01:37:33.970]  Who's to say Trump isn't thinking the same thing?
[01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:41.376]  You know, we need to knock out their comms, take over their media.
[01:37:41.496 --> 01:37:43.918]  I mean, we need to just shout them down.
[01:37:44.492 --> 01:37:46.793]  And do whatever it is to get them.
[01:37:47.273 --> 01:37:48.034]  And petitions.
[01:37:48.514 --> 01:37:52.176]  You know, I knew how to beat the Clintons, because he has a history of rape and settling it.
[01:37:52.736 --> 01:38:00.940]  I knew if our listeners took action and went to every live event and screamed, Bill Clinton's a rapist, it would psychologically break their will, their whole claim that Trump was a predator when there was no evidence.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.040]  And I haven't thought of the slogans yet.
[01:38:03.741 --> 01:38:07.943]  Quite frankly, they already want to kill me, so I almost don't even want to make it about me, but who else is more prominent?
[01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:20.895]  I think people should get on live TV peacefully, not just call in the C-SPAN, get in front of cameras, get on at live events, go to Democratic events, go to these town halls where they're paying people to bust them in to shout down the Freedom Caucus and Trump.
[01:38:21.296 --> 01:38:29.464]  I think all of you, you're the answer, just get out there and say Infowars.com is forbidden, you'll never stop America, we know America's run by foreign banks.
[01:38:30.024 --> 01:38:31.205]  Infowars.com.
[01:38:31.566 --> 01:38:33.367]  Alex Jones is the forbidden information.
[01:38:33.628 --> 01:38:35.229]  Roger Stone is the forbidden information.
[01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:38.172]  Whatever you want to put out, we're in a total war.
[01:38:38.472 --> 01:38:42.876]  I, as a man, have no fear now and just am in bliss, quite frankly, even though stuff's bad for me.
[01:38:43.297 --> 01:38:45.799]  Because I'm doing what I'm supposed to, fighting for humanity.
[01:38:46.279 --> 01:38:49.563]  So as bad as stuff gets in my own personal life and things, you know what?
[01:38:50.183 --> 01:38:53.125]  I'm manning up and I'm not saying that in an arrogant way.
[01:38:53.165 --> 01:38:58.330]  I'm actually ashamed in a way that I'm not more wimpy and I don't take stuff more painfully.
[01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:05.175]  It's actually the worse it gets the better because I see how no matter what happens to this body or my name I'm winning.
[01:39:05.395 --> 01:39:06.316]  The world's changing.
[01:39:06.456 --> 01:39:07.297]  I've changed the world.
[01:39:07.577 --> 01:39:08.438]  You've changed the world.
[01:39:08.698 --> 01:39:09.759]  So no matter what they do to me,
[01:39:10.519 --> 01:39:13.943]  Let me tell you, at the end of the day, ain't none of the enemy done stuff I've done.
[01:39:13.963 --> 01:39:16.565]  And it's not that I'm trying to be some badass or have power.
[01:39:16.605 --> 01:39:18.688]  I don't want jets, airplanes, big mansions.
[01:39:19.068 --> 01:39:20.970]  I want to be a bonebreaker to evil.
[01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:26.636]  I want pedophiles and tyrants and scum and wannabe Eddie Haskells to know I broke them.
[01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:29.137]  Because I came from good people that were strong.
[01:39:29.357 --> 01:39:30.417]  We built America.
[01:39:30.617 --> 01:39:31.878]  We created the prosperity.
[01:39:32.118 --> 01:39:34.019]  And they want to feed on innocent people?
[01:39:34.359 --> 01:39:37.760]  There's going to be a sheepdog come out of those woods to those wolves.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.542]  It don't matter if ten wolves come down on me and I end up dying.
[01:39:40.722 --> 01:39:42.462]  I'm going to kill five of them in the process.
[01:39:42.642 --> 01:39:44.103]  And I've already taken out a bunch of them.
[01:39:44.323 --> 01:39:46.444]  And I'm not psyching myself up because I don't need to.
[01:39:46.704 --> 01:39:48.065]  The truth is this is all on the surface.
[01:39:48.345 --> 01:39:49.645]  I'm born for this war.
[01:39:49.965 --> 01:39:51.446]  I'm not some psycho parasite.
[01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:54.207]  My feelings are so big and so deep and so strong.
[01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:56.088]  I'm ready to lay it all down for everybody.
[01:39:56.388 --> 01:39:57.988]  My family, everything's on the line.
[01:39:58.228 --> 01:39:59.849]  My name, my treasure, my blood.
[01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:02.569]  I wrote John Hancock on that Declaration of Independence.
[01:40:02.789 --> 01:40:03.529]  And I mean it.
[01:40:03.789 --> 01:40:06.750]  And being pure is the greatest form of being alive.
[01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:08.010]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:09.050]  I'm Roger Stoneholding.
[01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.750]  Busy guy.
[01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:10.831]  Stonecoldtruth.com.
[01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.751]  Being demonized, being attacked, you name it.
[01:40:12.951 --> 01:40:14.211]  Former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:40:14.511 --> 01:40:16.352]  Roger, what does Donald Trump need to do right now?
[01:40:17.552 --> 01:40:20.432]  Well, he is indeed besieged by hyenas.
[01:40:20.452 --> 01:40:23.613]  He's a giant surrounded by midgets.
[01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:36.191]  Uh, and, uh, many, many of the people who work for him, Alex, still don't understand him, don't understand his genius, don't understand his, the idiosyncrasies of his leadership style.
[01:40:37.112 --> 01:40:48.814]  Uh, and of course, there are those who denigrate the way he goes about businesses in the way they denigrated Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, many of our other, uh, tougher, uh, and more combative presidents.
[01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:53.815]  They're the spectators, the lesser men that sit back and watch great men strive, fail, or succeed.
[01:40:54.758 --> 01:40:55.659]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:55.719 --> 01:41:03.245]  They sit at the edges of the arena pointing out where the strongman fell or where he could have done things better, but they're lily-livered.
[01:41:03.285 --> 01:41:07.849]  They don't have the cojones to jump in the arena themselves.
[01:41:08.489 --> 01:41:24.342]  I would say several things that are disturbing me, Alex, and that is I have uncovered Trump-Pence transition documents that indicate to me that virtually every person hired for second and third level
[01:41:25.154 --> 01:41:25.735]  So this is Bush 3?
[01:41:46.293 --> 01:41:58.223]  And that Tillerson seems to be under the sway of his deputy, also placed by Condoleezza, a never-trumper, I might add.
[01:41:58.303 --> 01:42:03.327]  Now, Condoleezza Rice is very, very close to Donna Brazile.
[01:42:03.387 --> 01:42:05.068]  They're like best friends.
[01:42:05.728 --> 01:42:08.851]  And you will recall that Donna Brazile was caught red-handed
[01:42:09.503 --> 01:42:10.224]  Good to see you.
[01:42:27.825 --> 01:42:33.568]  So, there's a network here, and of course, Condoleezza Rice is the EOCON most closely responsible.
[01:42:33.608 --> 01:42:34.369]  Well, I'll stay there.
[01:42:34.409 --> 01:42:35.329]  I'm going to give her the floor.
[01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:36.450]  We come back in three minutes.
[01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:39.112]  Roger Stone, stonesoldtruth.com.
[01:42:39.892 --> 01:42:43.034]  Wow, you always, these breaking documents become national news the next day.
[01:42:43.054 --> 01:42:44.735]  We're getting an exclusive right now.
[01:42:44.755 --> 01:42:46.076]  He has the documents.
[01:42:46.096 --> 01:42:47.657]  We're obviously going to come back tomorrow.
[01:42:48.137 --> 01:42:49.618]  We can't, but we'll show the documents.
[01:42:49.678 --> 01:42:50.939]  This is so huge.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.104]  Of how they've taken over the Trump administration through Treasury.
[01:42:54.445 --> 01:42:57.851]  He will break it all down in three minutes on the other side with Roger Stone on Alex Jones.
[01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.013]  This is big.
[01:43:02.582 --> 01:43:06.444]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:06.484 --> 01:43:08.345]  We are under constant attack.
[01:43:08.826 --> 01:43:11.027]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:14.109]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:28.479]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[01:43:29.179 --> 01:43:30.800]  They can't get to us that way.
[01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:34.002]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[01:43:34.023 --> 01:43:35.003]  They don't have that power.
[01:43:35.463 --> 01:43:38.005]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[01:43:38.365 --> 01:43:40.767]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:43:41.207 --> 01:43:44.049]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:44.069 --> 01:43:45.710]  This is by listener request.
[01:43:45.951 --> 01:43:51.194]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[01:43:51.214 --> 01:43:51.795]  Again,
[01:43:52.535 --> 01:43:58.278]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[01:43:58.678 --> 01:44:02.999]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:07.421]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[01:44:09.462 --> 01:44:12.185]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[01:44:12.205 --> 01:44:30.622]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:44:30.942 --> 01:44:33.763]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[01:44:33.803 --> 01:44:35.844]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[01:44:36.184 --> 01:44:38.185]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[01:44:38.645 --> 01:44:50.249]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[01:44:50.289 --> 01:44:54.131]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:03.766 --> 01:45:09.089]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:45:09.249 --> 01:45:09.829]  I take this.
[01:45:10.089 --> 01:45:11.130]  My family takes this.
[01:45:11.230 --> 01:45:15.452]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:45:15.512 --> 01:45:19.954]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:45:20.114 --> 01:45:24.677]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:45:24.757 --> 01:45:25.797]  I don't feel good.
[01:45:25.897 --> 01:45:29.399]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:45:29.639 --> 01:45:32.281]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:45:32.341 --> 01:45:37.644]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:40.545]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:45:41.106 --> 01:45:44.527]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[01:45:44.628 --> 01:45:46.809]  So obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:45:46.869 --> 01:45:47.229]  I love it.
[01:45:47.389 --> 01:45:49.992]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:45:50.173 --> 01:45:51.154]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:45:51.194 --> 01:45:57.121]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:45:57.141 --> 01:45:58.784]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:45:59.024 --> 01:46:01.247]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:46:03.402 --> 01:46:12.366]  We all know that when the Democratic Party blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, it was the biggest dog-ate-my-homework excuse ever.
[01:46:12.487 --> 01:46:27.514]  But it seems now the vice president of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group said that according to their analysis, two-thirds of the voters Obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the Democratic Party to vote
[01:46:27.634 --> 01:46:36.256]  For Trump, so 70% of the reason Hillary Clinton lost can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior Obama voters.
[01:46:36.436 --> 01:46:41.076]  She claims to be part of the resistance, but even Antifa doesn't want her.
[01:46:41.196 --> 01:46:45.677]  There have even been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020.
[01:46:46.997 --> 01:46:55.519]  Rob Schneider recently tweeted, At this point, I believe a judge should grant America a restraining order against Hillary Clinton
[01:46:55.799 --> 01:46:56.780]  We're stalking!
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:57.840]  I'm Millie Weaver.
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.962]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:47:06.284 --> 01:47:08.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.906 --> 01:47:30.990]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:33.252]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:34.814 --> 01:47:38.617]  Roger Jones, our guest, hopefully can join me tomorrow during the weekday show to flesh this out more.
[01:47:38.637 --> 01:47:40.860]  We only have about ten and a half minutes left right now.
[01:47:42.409 --> 01:47:43.950]  Former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:47:43.971 --> 01:47:45.872]  I got a big Netflix show.
[01:47:45.952 --> 01:47:47.894]  They're saying probably the highest rated ever for Netflix.
[01:47:48.935 --> 01:47:52.558]  The Real House of Cards as he exposes it coming out here in just a few days.
[01:47:52.919 --> 01:47:53.840]  I'm in it as well.
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:56.382]  Look forward to actually sitting down and watching something like that.
[01:47:56.402 --> 01:47:58.484]  It's actually based somewhat in reality.
[01:47:58.504 --> 01:48:01.306]  We'll see how they spin it, but Roger thinks it may be somewhat fair.
[01:48:01.346 --> 01:48:01.847]  Let's see.
[01:48:02.508 --> 01:48:03.829]  But that's a separate issue, Roger.
[01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:05.731]  All I know is
[01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:07.911]  Trump's for real.
[01:48:08.551 --> 01:48:10.673]  Even when he compromises, they only come after him more.
[01:48:11.213 --> 01:48:13.555]  He's got a better bill now in the House passed.
[01:48:14.096 --> 01:48:19.040]  He's delivering like no president I ever read about in history books in the first 106, 107 days.
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:20.762]  They're branding him as a failure.
[01:48:20.822 --> 01:48:22.123]  They're saying they want to remove him.
[01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:27.367]  In the New Yorker magazine, they're having secret meetings about a coup d'etat or a 25th Amendment move.
[01:48:27.768 --> 01:48:32.371]  And then members of his cabinet are talking to the newspapers saying, oh yeah, we're getting ready to remove him.
[01:48:33.512 --> 01:48:41.160]  As you always said, if he brings in people that he thinks can, quote, guide him through the goblin's nest, the big threat is, like Reagan, they'll try to remove him.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.242]  So in the ten minutes we have left, you have the floor.
[01:48:43.702 --> 01:48:52.391]  Lay out this amazing development, this exclusive, the documents you've gotten that the entire State Department, for a month they wouldn't put anybody in, it was a total blockage.
[01:48:52.751 --> 01:48:56.295]  Now they're putting their people in from Condoleezza Rice and Donna Brazile.
[01:48:56.315 --> 01:48:57.356]  What a nightmare scenario.
[01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:03.732]  Yeah, Alex, this is very, very much like the situation that I encountered around President Reagan.
[01:49:04.372 --> 01:49:12.496]  President Reagan, like Donald Trump, knew what he believed and could not be pushed beyond it, despite the very best efforts of the established Republicans around him.
[01:49:13.276 --> 01:49:17.838]  I mean, I watched Ronald Reagan bend James A. Baker III to his will, not the other way around.
[01:49:18.838 --> 01:49:20.939]  And Trump is sometimes brilliant in that sense.
[01:49:20.999 --> 01:49:22.420]  I'll give you a specific example.
[01:49:23.214 --> 01:49:28.697]  Dr. Henry Kissinger began courting President-elect Trump shortly after he was re-elected.
[01:49:29.337 --> 01:49:34.200]  Kissinger had actually sent Trump several private messages of encouragement during the campaign.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.323]  Kissinger considers himself a Republican and has a low regard for the Clintons.
[01:49:40.603 --> 01:49:43.665]  Shortly thereafter, this courtship kind of picked up steam.
[01:49:44.464 --> 01:49:54.187]  And surprisingly, I am told that Kissinger was among those who opposed troops to Syria, one of the handful of experts that took that position.
[01:49:55.088 --> 01:50:12.954]  And I am told that on a recent trip to China, from which Kissinger has just returned, that he was carrying a message for the Chinese, presumably an effective message, because evidently it played some role in the new cooperation of the North Koreans with
[01:50:13.593 --> 01:50:19.718]  President Trump's initiative to have the Chinese help us on the North Korean nuclear problem.
[01:50:20.398 --> 01:50:27.103]  So you have a classic case here of the president taking an establishment figure but putting him to work for Trump's agenda.
[01:50:27.603 --> 01:50:37.871]  And at the same time, I really fear that the decision last week to block Rick Grenell as NATO ambassador made at the State Department was orchestrated by
[01:50:39.111 --> 01:50:44.856]  Well, if you saw the President's remarks after the historic repeal of Obamacare, he said this has united the Republican Party like nothing before.
[01:51:02.719 --> 01:51:06.941]  Yes, but it also means you can see his advisors keep telling him that that's a priority.
[01:51:06.982 --> 01:51:09.183]  I don't think that is a priority.
[01:51:09.343 --> 01:51:18.148]  The established Republicans, the organization Republicans, they'll get on board if the president's policies are popular.
[01:51:18.408 --> 01:51:18.888]  They are.
[01:51:19.369 --> 01:51:23.551]  And if they're free market based, Trump has to be the leader.
[01:51:23.571 --> 01:51:25.512]  He can't sit there and try to court the Republicans.
[01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:27.553]  Well, we tried this before.
[01:51:27.573 --> 01:51:30.495]  The first Obamacare bill, which has spilled milk.
[01:51:30.555 --> 01:51:31.976]  The liberals still like to talk about it.
[01:51:32.495 --> 01:51:34.376]  Trump never loses when he tries and fails.
[01:51:34.757 --> 01:51:35.957]  You never lose by fighting.
[01:51:35.977 --> 01:51:37.638]  You only lose when you don't fight.
[01:51:37.999 --> 01:51:39.960]  You only lose when you step down.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.300]  That's right.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.043]  He's not a loser getting more done than any president in history just because some of what he did failed.
[01:51:45.083 --> 01:51:46.084]  He's hard-charging.
[01:51:46.144 --> 01:51:46.785]  It's why they hate him.
[01:51:47.045 --> 01:51:48.266]  You know a man by his enemies.
[01:51:48.306 --> 01:51:51.067]  But incredible intel you're giving folks right now.
[01:51:51.107 --> 01:51:52.468]  Huge exclusives here, Roger.
[01:51:52.929 --> 01:51:55.290]  Keep going.
[01:51:55.350 --> 01:52:02.075]  Tomorrow at 2, Eastern, we're going to name names in terms of who inside the State Department is doing Condi's bidding.
[01:52:02.955 --> 01:52:05.396]  So you're coming on the show tomorrow at 1 Central, 2 Eastern?
[01:52:06.237 --> 01:52:07.297]  That is correct.
[01:52:07.357 --> 01:52:10.919]  And I will have, you know, we're going to name names as they say.
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:26.126]  It's outrageous, but it's not unexpected to see that the entrenched political establishment, once they realized they could not defeat Donald Trump, then they figured out that they couldn't destabilize him and discredit him.
[01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:28.327]  Now they're seeking to co-opt him.
[01:52:29.387 --> 01:52:31.108]  And he, as I've said, he's not
[01:52:32.052 --> 01:52:35.373]  He is a career politician.
[01:52:35.393 --> 01:52:38.755]  He hasn't hung around Washington waiting for the main chance his whole career.
[01:52:38.795 --> 01:52:41.676]  He didn't run for president because he needed to be someone.
[01:52:42.736 --> 01:52:50.559]  And he is not yet as knowledgeable about the federal system and how the government works and how Washington works just generally.
[01:52:51.079 --> 01:52:58.722]  Although he is a master of the news cycle and he always manages to grab the initiative back from his critics, which I think is his great genius.
[01:52:59.733 --> 01:53:03.697]  The fact that they are grumbling about removing him is not at all surprising.
[01:53:04.237 --> 01:53:08.221]  They don't understand his idiosyncratic nature.
[01:53:08.241 --> 01:53:10.243]  I was about to say, he is winning.
[01:53:10.303 --> 01:53:11.104]  He's doing a great job.
[01:53:11.164 --> 01:53:12.045]  I'm proud to support him.
[01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:14.888]  If we expect perfectness for him and get everything done, we're crazy.
[01:53:14.928 --> 01:53:15.829]  He's got to compromise.
[01:53:16.169 --> 01:53:17.831]  They hate him because he is so successful.
[01:53:17.851 --> 01:53:21.374]  He's taken power back from unelected multinationals back to the people.
[01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:22.775]  That process is happening.
[01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:23.616]  It's why they're panicking.
[01:53:24.657 --> 01:53:31.162]  I sit there and I look at the wholesale demonization, the news saying we're allowed to remove him, trying to mainline a coup d'etat.
[01:53:31.182 --> 01:53:32.323]  That really concerns me.
[01:53:32.563 --> 01:53:34.605]  And again, that certifies how good he is.
[01:53:34.985 --> 01:53:36.466]  I think Trump's biggest threat is...
[01:53:37.521 --> 01:53:46.725]  Not being himself, but also us demanding he be Jesus Christ delivering perfect nirvana on a golden platter, you know, with a silver spoon.
[01:53:47.165 --> 01:53:50.046]  It's up to us to be the bulldogs here and to enforce this.
[01:53:50.426 --> 01:54:05.192]  His biggest Achilles heel is that we're not still enthusiastic enough backing the untold victories we've had, like a great Supreme Court justice, like a TPP dead, like a $3 trillion in the stock market, like 43% down in illegals coming in, on and on and on.
[01:54:06.818 --> 01:54:09.360]  Well, Alex, you know, let's put this in some perspective.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:15.885]  You had Bill Clinton, who was a serial rapist, who assaulted numerous women, yet we're saying Donald Trump is mentally unfit?
[01:54:16.526 --> 01:54:18.747]  But let's think about that for just a moment.
[01:54:19.308 --> 01:54:28.034]  This is classic, where they want to remove the president, not because of his actions or his manners, but because of his beliefs.
[01:54:28.114 --> 01:54:30.056]  He so threatens the new world order.
[01:54:30.849 --> 01:54:37.533]  He so threatens the fact that they now have to connive and scheme and plot to get anything done worse before.
[01:54:37.553 --> 01:54:43.857]  Under Obama, under Clinton, under the Bushes, they had their agenda at every step of the way.
[01:54:43.937 --> 01:54:45.518]  So the people who've run this country for 30 years,
[01:54:46.565 --> 01:54:46.625]  I'm
[01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:04.072]  And again, Trump understands that, right, Roger?
[01:55:04.092 --> 01:55:06.914]  I mean, I love his family, Ivanka and others, love them to death.
[01:55:07.154 --> 01:55:10.337]  Don't they get kissing the ass of this system is going to destroy them?
[01:55:10.997 --> 01:55:11.798]  That shows weakness?
[01:55:11.818 --> 01:55:15.741]  I mean, look at Bill Maher and all them turning on her as soon as she sells her dad out.
[01:55:16.021 --> 01:55:18.984]  Hasn't she figured out disloyalty is the kiss of death?
[01:55:20.359 --> 01:55:29.542]  Well, look, I'm going to defend both Ivanka and Jared only in the sense that the bad advice they keep giving the president attempts to moderate him, as she put it in the New York Times.
[01:55:30.942 --> 01:55:32.483]  The idea of coming to grips.
[01:55:32.523 --> 01:55:35.604]  Yeah, Ivanka, we didn't hire you to moderate your dad, sweetheart.
[01:55:36.644 --> 01:55:36.884]  Sorry.
[01:55:36.924 --> 01:55:39.225]  No, I don't want a moderated Donald Trump.
[01:55:39.305 --> 01:55:40.485]  I want the guy we elected.
[01:55:40.565 --> 01:55:42.986]  He doesn't need any moderation.
[01:55:43.066 --> 01:55:44.066]  We need the real Trump.
[01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:45.567]  I say let Trump be Trump.
[01:55:46.047 --> 01:55:47.227]  That's the success story.
[01:55:47.247 --> 01:55:49.588]  In fact, I want him to be more aggressive in the campaign.
[01:55:50.248 --> 01:55:55.891]  Well, it's only when he's talked into being timid or into calling back that, you know, they don't do well.
[01:55:55.952 --> 01:56:03.276]  The president was elected for a reason on a set of... Remember the first debate where he was nice to Hillary and lost it?
[01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:04.237]  Exactly right.
[01:56:04.397 --> 01:56:12.041]  So I think that we're now in a situation in which those who say, oh, Jared and Ivanka can never be displaced.
[01:56:12.141 --> 01:56:13.142]  I'm not sure that's right.
[01:56:13.746 --> 01:56:19.852]  Let's see how the results of their bad advice plays out when the president unfortunately takes it.
[01:56:20.192 --> 01:56:20.552]  Exactly.
[01:56:20.572 --> 01:56:26.958]  Let me stop you there because when you talk about you and I and us, we're all being censored, we're being blocked because we are effective, because they are scared of us.
[01:56:26.978 --> 01:56:27.839]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks.
[01:56:27.879 --> 01:56:29.000]  They're super scared of you and I.
[01:56:29.801 --> 01:56:34.264]  People need to follow you on Twitter, Facebook, Google, but your own website, because they can't censor that as easily.
[01:56:34.304 --> 01:56:35.425]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:56:35.845 --> 01:56:38.487]  You're going to be doing your own weekday show here soon, not just once a week.
[01:56:39.048 --> 01:56:41.009]  We're launching a larger operation in the next two months.
[01:56:41.029 --> 01:56:42.870]  People need to follow you on Twitter.
[01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:44.491]  They need to follow us at RealAlexJones.
[01:56:44.772 --> 01:56:45.852]  They need to buy our products.
[01:56:45.872 --> 01:56:48.194]  They need to buy the Bill Clinton rape shirt, the exercise of free speech.
[01:56:48.574 --> 01:56:50.276]  They need to get the new Paul Watson t-shirt.
[01:56:50.616 --> 01:56:51.717]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:51.737 --> 01:56:53.078]  A bunch of big specials in tomorrow.
[01:56:53.358 --> 01:56:54.799]  What are your other contact points, Roger?
[01:56:55.745 --> 01:57:02.370]  Well, Alex, you can go to stonezone.com, which we have now just completely redesigned, kind of archival.
[01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:11.076]  Rogerstone.com, if you want to get my epic line of books on Johnson, Nixon, Watergate, Donald Trump, the Clintons.
[01:57:11.976 --> 01:57:17.240]  Now out, by the way, finally, the Bush crime family out in paperback with two new chapters.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.541]  We're out of time.
[01:57:18.581 --> 01:57:21.323]  At promised tomorrow, he'll talk some about the big Netflix show.
[01:57:21.343 --> 01:57:22.624]  They're saying that's gonna be the big end of the year.
[01:57:24.301 --> 01:57:25.702]  Get me Roger Stone.
[01:57:25.822 --> 01:57:30.286]  Kick it around tomorrow at 2 o'clock Eastern, 1 o'clock Central at InfoWars.
[01:57:30.826 --> 01:57:32.027]  Can't wait for that big exclusive.
[01:57:32.087 --> 01:57:32.388]  Wow.
[01:57:32.748 --> 01:57:33.588]  That's why they hate us, folks.
[01:57:33.608 --> 01:57:35.170]  They know we're not scared to put these exclusives out.
[01:57:35.530 --> 01:57:36.110]  The big data.
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:38.532]  We got the big, big, big, big sources up at the top.
[01:57:38.773 --> 01:57:39.393]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:57:39.413 --> 01:57:39.974]  Talk to you soon.
[01:57:40.014 --> 01:57:40.594]  Amazing person.
[01:57:40.874 --> 01:57:41.755]  Great job to the crew.
[01:57:41.775 --> 01:57:42.416]  Sorry to the other callers.
[01:57:42.476 --> 01:57:42.956]  I didn't get to you.
[01:57:42.996 --> 01:57:44.597]  Dakota and John, go back to you tomorrow.
[01:57:44.617 --> 01:57:44.998]  Recall.
[01:57:45.018 --> 01:57:45.298]  I love you.
[01:57:45.778 --> 01:57:47.800]  InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:50.422]  We need financial support to maintain where we're at.
[01:57:50.682 --> 01:57:51.323]  We got great products.
[01:57:52.083 --> 01:57:59.846]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:00.066 --> 01:58:06.488]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:58:06.708 --> 01:58:14.991]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:24.019]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:30.045]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:58:30.365 --> 01:58:30.846]  It works.
[01:58:31.146 --> 01:58:39.394]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:58:39.594 --> 01:58:49.023]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.

[01:58:56.124 --> 01:58:57.626]  There is a crisis in America today.
[01:58:58.106 --> 01:59:00.489]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[01:59:00.809 --> 01:59:08.218]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[01:59:08.618 --> 01:59:12.222]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[01:59:12.563 --> 01:59:13.724]  I have the answer for you today.
[01:59:14.124 --> 01:59:15.286]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[01:59:16.021 --> 01:59:21.325]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[01:59:21.765 --> 01:59:27.529]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:30.811]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[01:59:31.011 --> 01:59:36.975]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[01:59:37.756 --> 01:59:39.397]  With a blocking pocket, this isn't possible.
[01:59:39.877 --> 01:59:42.559]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[01:59:42.879 --> 01:59:51.344]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocking pocket.
[01:59:55.326 --> 01:59:59.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
