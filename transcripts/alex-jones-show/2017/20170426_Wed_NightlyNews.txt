[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.542]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:21.282]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.183]  It's Wednesday, April 26, 2017.
[00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:25.586]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:37.997]  Tonight, President Trump appears to be ready to finally deliver on tax cuts, making big proposals for reform and overhauls in the tax code.
[00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:47.981]  Obamacare is back in the crosshairs, as the GOP moves forwards towards repeal, but gets slowed by centrists within.
[00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:49.062]  Meanwhile...
[00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:54.635]  The mainstream media is ignoring one of the biggest developing stories of the year.
[00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:57.538]  Pedophile and sex trafficking arrests.
[00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:03.162]  We report on the developments, as well as the lack of attention from the mainstream news.
[00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.605]  And then, they say vaccines are for our health.
[00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:13.050]  But new research suggests a certain vaccine will actually increase the risks of dying from other causes.
[00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:20.152]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.730]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.470]  I take this.
[00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.771]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:43.115]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:47.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.041]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.922]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:05.304]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.184]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.145]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.446]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:14.866]  I love it.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.629]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.810]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.778]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.420]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.882]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:17.142]  Well, as the artificial construct of the first 100 days that everybody wants to talk about with the presidency, and of course it's not all that important, but we do see some very important legislation being introduced as we approach that deadline.
[00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:23.205]  Things on taxes, movement on Obamacare, movement on the border as well as on trade.
[00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.646]  Let's start with taxes first.
[00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:32.810]  Today we had some dramatic tax cuts proposed by Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohen, economic advisors to Donald Trump.
[00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:44.334]  Where the White House has yet to spell out, according to Breitbart, the hole the tax cuts could create in the federal budget, maintaining that the resulting economic growth would reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of a soaring deficit.
[00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:45.474]  And that is a sticking point.
[00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:50.275]  We'll talk about why that really isn't a problem, but that's going to be the way that they attack this.
[00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.737]  Now Gary Cohen said, the President owns this plan, don't mistake it.
[00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:54.617]  And that's very important.
[00:03:55.157 --> 00:04:00.580]  Because the first big failure with Obamacare was because Trump didn't get ahead of this.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.080]  It was really Paul Ryan's plan.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.461]  It was very complicated.
[00:04:03.741 --> 00:04:09.183]  They kept changing this massive document right up to the last minute, but it really didn't do what Trump proposed.
[00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:15.228]  A tax cut proposal is very close to what Trump had campaigned on, and it's very good news.
[00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.792]  Hopefully he can get this through, hopefully he can get Paul Ryan online, but we'll talk about that.
[00:04:19.873 --> 00:04:26.418]  Paul Ryan is already making moves behind the scenes that may sabotage this, along the lines of saying that it won't pay for itself.
[00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.637]  This is the first massive rewrite of the U.S.
[00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:33.219]  tax code since 1986, if it goes through.
[00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.480]  And, of course, Gary Cohn said, we know this is going to be difficult.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.921]  We know we're asking for a big bite.
[00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:39.823]  Now, what is in the plan?
[00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:45.146]  Actually, it would reduce the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.
[00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.487]  So it would simplify the tax code in terms of brackets.
[00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:49.408]  It would simplify it in a lot of other ways.
[00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.030]  The rates, the new rates that they're proposing would be 10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.
[00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.756]  It would also double the standard deduction for married couples to $24,000.
[00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:05.404]  So in other words, if you were making $24,000 or less, you would not pay any taxes.
[00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:08.689]  Again, that's in line with what President Trump campaigned on.
[00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:14.155]  It would also retain deductions for charitable giving and for mortgage interest payments.
[00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:21.883]  The administration plans to provide tax relief for families with child care expenses as well, although they did not release the specifics of that.
[00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:30.091]  On the other hand, and this is where some of the opposition is going to come from, they would take away deductions for state and local taxes.
[00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:36.236]  And they say, of course, this is going to alienate support from places like California and New York, where they have high taxes.
[00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:44.421]  Those of us who live in states where there isn't an income tax, states like Texas and Florida, don't get those deductions.
[00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:48.864]  So in a sense, what you're doing is you're subsidizing the high-tax states of California and New York.
[00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:54.066]  Those people would see their true tax burden not subsidized by the federal government.
[00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.087]  And that's what Mnuchin said.
[00:05:55.127 --> 00:05:58.389]  It's not the federal government's job to be subsidizing the states.
[00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:02.511]  It would also repeal, and this is very important, the estate tax, the death tax.
[00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:12.357]  The catch-all alternative minimum tax, and it would repeal the 3.8% tax on investment income that Obama put in for the health care law.
[00:06:12.657 --> 00:06:16.240]  Understand that the health care plan is a tax.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.084]  It is also a gun to your head to force you to buy private corporations' products.
[00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:24.345]  That's an unusual aspect of it as well.
[00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:26.366]  But it is also socialism.
[00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.567]  So it's crony capitalism.
[00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:31.030]  It's socialism redistributing income to people.
[00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:35.732]  Crony Capitalism all rolled together in one.
[00:06:35.772 --> 00:06:42.996]  Now on the corporate side, the proposed changes to the tax law would drop the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent.
[00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:52.640]  Small businesses that account for their owners' personal incomes would see their top rate go from 39.6 percent to the proposed corporate tax rate of 15 percent.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.541]  That's very good news.
[00:06:54.246 --> 00:07:01.650]  Because it's an even bigger deduction or win, I should say, for small businesses than it is for the larger corporations.
[00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.151]  And we want to see that type of thing.
[00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:09.014]  Now, the liberals, their response to it was to call on Donald Trump to release his tax returns.
[00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.594]  As I've said many times, I don't care about Donald Trump's tax returns.
[00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:16.616]  I want to see his tax reforms.
[00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:17.457]  Today we saw them.
[00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:20.600]  They match what he campaigned on, and that's a good thing.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.724]  But what the liberals are doing is the usual politics of envy.
[00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:28.668]  Don't look at how your taxes are going to be reduced.
[00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.931]  You should only care if Donald Trump
[00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.220]  Didn't pay enough taxes.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.566]  And of course we see that in spades when we look at the analysis from the Washington Post and from NPR.
[00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:47.613]  Now Washington Post focuses on the fact that by cutting taxes that would increase the deficit.
[00:07:47.653 --> 00:07:49.535]  And they're saying you're not going to be able to do that.
[00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.916]  This is the way the Washington Post put it.
[00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:55.940]  Many budget experts say they believe the White House's plan would reduce federal revenue by so much
[00:07:56.621 --> 00:08:05.365]  That it would grow the debt by trillions of dollars in the next decade, growing interest charges and slowing the economy.
[00:08:06.065 --> 00:08:08.607]  They say that this is a proven fact.
[00:08:08.647 --> 00:08:10.047]  Well, we know that's not true.
[00:08:10.808 --> 00:08:11.928]  This is their crystal ball.
[00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:13.429]  This is their objection.
[00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.050]  And we have seen this over and over again.
[00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.692]  We'll go to that in just one moment, but I want to take a look at some of the other liberal reactions to this.
[00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:24.254]  Of course, NPR, when they look at it, they talk about
[00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:26.655]  The 15% business tax rate.
[00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:35.480]  They do say that small businesses would benefit the most by going from the highest tax rate for their corporations, if they're incorporated, to going down to 15%.
[00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:37.902]  So they go from nearly 40% to 50%.
[00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:45.427]  But then their third item is that Trump himself stands to gain tens of millions of dollars.
[00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:48.969]  Again, the politics of envy from the left put out by NPR.
[00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:52.251]  They say this plan will be a windfall for Trump because he pays taxes
[00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:56.374]  Through his business, and it would slash his own personal tax liability.
[00:08:56.414 --> 00:09:03.601]  So because he has a business, because he has income, because he's successful, then he's going to benefit from this.
[00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:04.662]  And he shouldn't.
[00:09:04.982 --> 00:09:08.966]  So we should punish everybody else who has a business, who has a job, who is successful.
[00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:10.768]  Just so we can get even with Trump.
[00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:13.210]  That's the politics of envy that they put out there.
[00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.174]  One of the other things that they did say was that Trump's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin
[00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:23.875]  ...said that he wanted to simplify the tax code allowing people to fill out their taxes on a large postcard.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.384]  They say that also, and this is not true, that it would mean doing away with popular deductions like the home mortgage deduction.
[00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:33.606]  No, that is simply more false liberal spin.
[00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:38.169]  As they pointed out, they would retain the mortgage deduction, they would retain the charitable deduction.
[00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:39.470]  They're not going to touch those things.
[00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.350]  It's too controversial.
[00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.932]  They say, how is this going to be paid for?
[00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:46.955]  And again, that's back to this issue, that it's going to increase the deficit.
[00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.577]  Well, they say in one word, growth.
[00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:55.064]  And Mnuchin said, we fundamentally believe that we can get to 3% sustained economic growth.
[00:09:55.604 --> 00:10:02.485]  They also say that they're not going to do any border adjustment taxes, which is a more complicated issue.
[00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:10.767]  This is something that Paul Ryan is saying they still may look at in the future, but it is something that they're not going to address at this point.
[00:10:10.807 --> 00:10:17.588]  And again, that would be a situation where there would be a tax on goods coming in, but they would remove taxes as they go out, which would put us
[00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:18.809]  We're good to go.
[00:10:41.052 --> 00:10:44.058]  Now how did the Republicans and the Democrats react?
[00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:51.433]  Well, Paul Ryan says we're in agreement on 80% of this and on the remaining 20% we're in the same ballpark.
[00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:54.347]  So we'll see what happens with this.
[00:10:54.547 --> 00:10:56.967]  And of course the Democrats call it trickle-down economics.
[00:10:57.528 --> 00:11:01.449]  Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Tax Committee, called it unprincipled.
[00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:07.971]  Unprincipled that we would do tax cuts, because that's the principles that they base their party on, is higher taxes.
[00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:14.153]  He says it would create crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people.
[00:11:14.213 --> 00:11:16.313]  Well, that would be more than the Democrats.
[00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:18.214]  The Democrats would not even give us crumbs.
[00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:22.938]  Is this a fatal flaw in the tax cut, as CNN says?
[00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:25.340]  They say this will not pass Senate rules.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.122]  And here's where Paul Ryan comes in.
[00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:37.932]  They said that he had created a joint committee on taxation, which did a private analysis requested by House Speaker Paul Ryan.
[00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:52.425]  Now, this special committee that did this private analysis for Paul Ryan found that a significant corporate tax rate cut for just three years would result in deficit increases after 10 years.
[00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:57.589]  So it looks like Paul Ryan is already poised to sabotage this tax cut.
[00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:02.673]  And of course, the details of that were leaked out to the press.
[00:12:03.433 --> 00:12:04.994]  Now this is not a fatal flaw.
[00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:24.341]  They're saying that because of this study then it is not going to muster reconciliation because they'll have to take this study and they'll have to do a budget reconciliation with the House and the Senate and they'll say look according to our projections it's going to increase the deficit significantly.
[00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:25.442]  Well that's just not true.
[00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:33.232]  What they're ignoring is the reality that tax cuts lead to increases in tax revenue.
[00:12:34.093 --> 00:12:34.433]  They do.
[00:12:34.493 --> 00:12:34.934]  We know that.
[00:12:34.974 --> 00:12:36.415]  We know that from the Reagan tax cuts.
[00:12:36.815 --> 00:12:39.897]  And more recently, we know it from North Carolina.
[00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:51.805]  In this article from CPRNC.org, Carolina Partnership for Reform, they talked about how there, over just the last two or three years, they had tax cuts boost revenue.
[00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:53.146]  This always happens.
[00:12:54.087 --> 00:12:55.408]  This is not a projection.
[00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.329]  This is historical fact.
[00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:59.491]  In other words, no brag, just fact.
[00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:01.162]  And this is what they said.
[00:13:01.462 --> 00:13:03.263]  Do tax cuts blow up the budget?
[00:13:03.643 --> 00:13:05.124]  History says no.
[00:13:05.844 --> 00:13:14.968]  In fiscal year 2014, fiscal research projected revenue collections in the future, and then the conservative majority cut their taxes.
[00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:22.471]  So what they did was, they did their budgetary projections, they said this is what we're looking to see, and then they did a tax cut.
[00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:28.882]  With the tax cuts, actual revenue still exceeded the projections made before the tax cuts were passed.
[00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:30.162]  And here's why.
[00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:36.125]  Faster economic growth generates government revenue and tax reduction helps the economy.
[00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:37.546]  We know that.
[00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:38.566]  We've seen it.
[00:13:38.846 --> 00:13:41.127]  We experienced it with the Reagan tax cuts.
[00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:42.668]  It's not a theory.
[00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:49.832]  And it's amazing to me that Paul Ryan and his private analysis and the Democrats are still trying to pass off this idea.
[00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:55.136]  That tax cuts are going to result in less tax revenue for the government.
[00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:57.518]  That it will create a deficit increase.
[00:13:57.678 --> 00:13:58.219]  It doesn't.
[00:13:58.619 --> 00:13:59.760]  Take a look at these numbers here.
[00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:02.471]  They projected in 2014 a $20.7 billion revenue.
[00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:04.193]  They got actually $21.45 billion.
[00:14:04.213 --> 00:14:05.874]  In other words, they got a 3.6% increase.
[00:14:05.894 --> 00:14:07.556]  The next year, in 2015, they got a 3.5% increase.
[00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:11.380]  And right now they haven't completed this last one, but so far they're $570 million above projection through March.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.101]  See, that's the reality.
[00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:24.935]  That's the reality.
[00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:30.540]  So we need to understand that cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code is a good thing.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.242]  I wish they would do it even farther, but we'll take what we can get, okay?
[00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:39.383]  And this is very close to what Trump campaigned on.
[00:14:39.423 --> 00:14:55.289]  So let's hope that by taking the lead, that he'll be able to force Paul Ryan to do the right thing, even though Paul Ryan has already laid the groundwork to oppose this and say, it's not me, it's this independent private analysis that I created, and my hands are tied.
[00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:59.711]  Once they project that we're going to have an increase in deficit, I can't pass your tax cut.
[00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:01.242]  That's where he's coming from.
[00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:02.484]  Let's take a look at Obamacare.
[00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:04.206]  There was some movement there as well today.
[00:15:04.827 --> 00:15:08.792]  The Freedom Caucus, remember they got a lot of criticism from Donald Trump.
[00:15:08.852 --> 00:15:10.053]  He said, who are these guys?
[00:15:10.254 --> 00:15:15.420]  And said, we need to take these guys out because they didn't go along with Paul Ryan's failed plan.
[00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:18.163]  The problem was that Trump bought into it.
[00:15:18.223 --> 00:15:20.425]  He was totally pwned by Paul Ryan.
[00:15:20.465 --> 00:15:26.350]  Paul Ryan has never wanted to repeal Obamacare, and certainly he didn't want to do it this time.
[00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:38.080]  And they put all the blame on the House Freedom Caucus because they stayed true to their promises, they fought for repeal, and they did not even bring it up to a vote.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.241]  But today we've had
[00:15:40.422 --> 00:15:52.310]  The chairman, Mark Meadows, who is from North Carolina, working with Tom MacArthur, who is supposedly part of a group of moderate Republicans, and they have come up with something of a compromise.
[00:15:52.610 --> 00:16:03.757]  The Freedom Caucus said in a statement, while the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower health care costs.
[00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:15.569]  Now, that's a move by them, and it's a move by an individual by Tom MacArthur, who is part of the so-called Moderate Tuesday group.
[00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:22.994]  But if you look at the next headline, you see, GOP takes a step forward on Obamacare replacement, but the centrists are elusive.
[00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:30.660]  The rest of these moderates and centrists are putting their foot down and saying, no, we're not going to have it, we're not going to budge on this, we're not going to move at all.
[00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:32.944]  Why is that not a problem?
[00:16:33.344 --> 00:16:41.686]  Why are they called moderates and centrists instead of hardline, instead of obstructionist, instead of radical statists?
[00:16:41.886 --> 00:16:48.488]  Why are the Republicans, who are opposing any change to Obamacare, why are they centrists and moderates?
[00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.849]  Well, it's because the press wants to see Obamacare remain.
[00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:53.990]  So this is the way the Hill reports it.
[00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.151]  Moderates remain elusive.
[00:16:56.591 --> 00:17:01.034]  Several centrist lawmakers said they could not say whether they would support the bill.
[00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:04.896]  So far, no moderates have moved from a no to a yes vote on the bill.
[00:17:05.476 --> 00:17:14.601]  And there are divisions within the moderate Tuesday group over MacArthur's decision to negotiate changes to the earlier bill with Meadows, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus.
[00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:20.684]  Many, here we go, centrist again, said privately that MacArthur was not negotiating on their behalf.
[00:17:21.747 --> 00:17:21.927]  Okay.
[00:17:22.487 --> 00:17:26.230]  Will these people be called out for criticism by Donald Trump like he called out Mark Meadows?
[00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.630]  You understand who moved on this.
[00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:30.352]  Unfortunately it was the House Freedom Caucus.
[00:17:30.412 --> 00:17:31.493]  I don't know that I would have moved.
[00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:32.994]  I think I would have stuck for repeal.
[00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:35.095]  But they're trying to get this moving.
[00:17:35.135 --> 00:17:37.296]  They're trying to make some changes in this.
[00:17:37.636 --> 00:17:40.598]  They're trying, they said, to reduce health care costs.
[00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:42.799]  And what is it that they're talking about doing?
[00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:47.082]  The proposed changes would let states get federal waivers to some coverage requirements
[00:17:47.762 --> 00:17:50.643]  that the Obama law imposed on insurers.
[00:17:50.923 --> 00:18:09.609]  They say after a nagging issue, another nagging issue, was a revelation that the legislation would allow members of Congress and their staff to continue to receive certain benefits under health law, even if the state opted out from the federal requirement to provide such services as maternity and newborn care, preventive care, wellness visits, prescription drug coverage.
[00:18:09.649 --> 00:18:11.570]  So even if their state opted out,
[00:18:12.935 --> 00:18:17.458]  These congressional representatives would still be able to get their Cadillac health care.
[00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:28.625]  They said, meanwhile, bipartisan talks on separate $1 trillion budget bill aimed at preventing a partial government shutdown on Saturday were jarred over the disagreement about payments made to insurers under Obamacare.
[00:18:28.665 --> 00:18:37.691]  Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi are wrestling over a Democrat demand that the must-pass spending bill keep money flowing under health care law that keeps
[00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.495]  Low earners pay out-of-pocket medical costs.
[00:18:41.575 --> 00:18:42.977]  Okay, so this is where they are.
[00:18:43.277 --> 00:18:44.699]  Are they going to stand hard on this?
[00:18:44.739 --> 00:18:45.480]  They're in the majority.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:53.749]  They have presumably Donald Trump with them, but they don't want to be seen as obstructionists unless they want to obstruct any reform of Obamacare.
[00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.011]  If you do, then you're a good guy.
[00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:55.612]  You're a moderate.
[00:18:55.672 --> 00:18:56.232]  You're a centrist.
[00:18:56.252 --> 00:18:56.713]  Stay with us.
[00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:57.334]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:09.360]  Info Wars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:15.986]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.397]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.519]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.344]  It works!
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:48.907]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:58.509]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.330]  A total 360 win!
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.192]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:04.252]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.438]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.119]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:21.699]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:28.943]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:36.767]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.289]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.915]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.038]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.740]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.321]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.522]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.542 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.934]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.238]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.462]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:28.143]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:33.345]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:37.106]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:44.908]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:49.970]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:56.867]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[00:21:56.888 --> 00:21:58.231]  No fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.462]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:08.843]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:20.105]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.405]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:27.546]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.047]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:33.287]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.389]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.750]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.631]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:53.132]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.682]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:05.287 --> 00:23:05.607]  It wasn't
[00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:30.464]  And it was mayors from 15 large American cities, including some from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.
[00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:41.414]  They met with Attorney General Sessions in Washington yesterday to discuss the Department of Justice's efforts to cut funding from cities that frustrate federal immigration enforcement.
[00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:44.036]  And when he got with them, what he said was this.
[00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:46.018]  He said, we're talking about sanctuary cities.
[00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:48.460]  Let me be very specific about what the law is.
[00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.662]  Just in case some activist judge needs to know what it is.
[00:23:52.682 --> 00:24:01.705]  He said, the Department of Justice will fulfill our responsibility to uphold and enforce our nation's immigration laws, including, and he cites a law, 8 U.S.C.
[00:24:02.285 --> 00:24:01.705]  1373.
[00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:13.128]  Under the Obama administration, he said, the Justice Department required certain guarantees to certify compliance with federal law, including 8 U.S.C.
[00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:18.390]  1373, quoted a second time, as a condition for receiving grant funding.
[00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:23.831]  And as Breitbart points out, that law 8 U.S.C.
[00:24:23.851 --> 00:24:34.636]  1373 prohibits local jurisdictions from preventing Immigration and Nationalization Service from getting immigration status information on people they detain.
[00:24:35.476 --> 00:24:38.659]  See, that's the essence of what the sanctuary cities want to do.
[00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:48.528]  And of course, we've seen in Maryland, not only do they have proud sanctuary cities, but Maryland wants to be the first sanctuary state and say, we're not going to cooperate with INS.
[00:24:48.808 --> 00:24:54.554]  We're going to hide information about people that are arrested for various crimes.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.721]  And we're not going to turn that information over.
[00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:05.985]  And what he said is, is that, look, quote the law, we have a law that says that a condition of you receiving funds is that you obey certain laws.
[00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:07.306]  And this is one of them.
[00:25:07.386 --> 00:25:09.747]  So we'll have to see what happens with that.
[00:25:10.507 --> 00:25:16.310]  Certainly, that activist judge in the Ninth Circuit Court is outside of his jurisdiction.
[00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:38.863]  Now, to double down on this, as we look at the sanctuary cities being shut down by activist judge, we've also had Paul Ryan moving the funding for the border wall out of this particular reconciliation that they're trying to do, rather than using the leverage of the fact they have to do reconciliation, and it's not a large amount of money.
[00:25:38.883 --> 00:25:41.804]  They're only looking at a little over a billion dollars.
[00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:43.586]  It's about a billion or a billion and a half dollars.
[00:25:44.332 --> 00:25:46.894]  But they have delayed it for at least another year.
[00:25:47.655 --> 00:25:48.496]  Not a good sign.
[00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:52.339]  And the Democrats are vowing that it will not be built.
[00:25:52.479 --> 00:26:07.032]  This is coming from House Democrat Caucus Chairman Crowley, Democrat New York, said the Democrats are pleased that Trump is allegedly backing off from building a border wall with Mexico, adding that even Republicans along the border don't want to see the wall ever built, quote-unquote.
[00:26:07.878 --> 00:26:17.124]  Crowley said that Democrats want to evaluate whether the continuing resolution contains any border enhancement measures such as moves to hire more U.S.
[00:26:17.164 --> 00:26:17.925]  Border Patrol agents.
[00:26:17.965 --> 00:26:20.286]  In other words, it's not just the wall.
[00:26:20.887 --> 00:26:23.749]  He doesn't want to do anything to protect the border.
[00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:36.057]  If there's anything in there that would even hire more agents, and we've talked about how there are large areas of the border that aren't even patrolled right now, so if you even put money in there for more Border Patrol agents, they're going to shut this down.
[00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:38.012]  It needs to go the other way.
[00:26:38.693 --> 00:26:44.141]  They need to use this continuing resolution issue as leverage to get what they want out of the Democrats.
[00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:45.844]  The Democrats are in the minority.
[00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.888]  He said that wall will not be built.
[00:26:49.188 --> 00:26:51.491]  He said it is not going to happen.
[00:26:52.745 --> 00:27:05.455]  Meanwhile, we had a claim from Laura Ingraham, who was on Sean Hannity's show yesterday, saying that sources told her that senior Republican lawmakers literally laughed out loud at the idea that a wall would be built.
[00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:06.636]  So it's not just the Democrats.
[00:27:07.295 --> 00:27:08.757]  It's also senior Republicans.
[00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:16.165]  Ingram said, one thing I know for sure, Sean, is that we have way too many people on Capitol Hill who are not on the President's side of this.
[00:27:16.225 --> 00:27:18.107]  And I'm talking Republicans.
[00:27:18.668 --> 00:27:21.571]  So I have no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump wants this wall to be built.
[00:27:21.671 --> 00:27:23.173]  Congress has to appropriate the money.
[00:27:23.673 --> 00:27:27.457]  I heard over two months ago that GOP leadership
[00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:38.284]  The most senior senators on Capitol Hill, and I heard it from someone who was in the room with them, they were laughing at an idea that a wall would ever get built.
[00:27:38.784 --> 00:27:40.345]  Out loud laughing, she said.
[00:27:40.505 --> 00:27:45.668]  They were recently telling that source of mine, don't worry, it's not going to happen.
[00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:49.571]  Trump himself stated yesterday that he's confident that the construction of the wall will begin soon.
[00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:58.353]  When repeatedly asked, when will the wall get built, by CBS reporter Major Garrett, Trump replied, it will start soon, very soon, so we shall see.
[00:27:58.373 --> 00:28:07.975]  And of course, CNS News today, via Drudge Report, asked the question, will the GOP fund Planned Parenthood, but not fund the wall?
[00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:09.536]  Is this what they intend to do?
[00:28:09.936 --> 00:28:11.256]  Is this what Donald Trump intends to do?
[00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.817]  Is this what Paul Ryan intends to do?
[00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:15.398]  And Mitch McConnell.
[00:28:15.998 --> 00:28:19.420]  And they recall the promises that you've heard from Donald Trump.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.301]  I'll build a great, great wall on our southern border.
[00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:22.802]  I'll have Mexico pay for the wall.
[00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:36.271]  He also said, I am committed to defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions and to reallocate their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women but don't perform abortions.
[00:28:36.311 --> 00:28:37.332]  That was candidate Trump.
[00:28:38.012 --> 00:28:52.600]  And of course, back in 2011, he points out in this editorial at CNS, he said the House passed an amendment that was presented by Pence, who was then a congressman, to stop funding for Planned Parenthood because of the abortions that they did.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:06.667]  But what happened was that House Speaker John Boehner, at the time, subsequently cut a spending deal with the Democrats in the Senate and the White House that did not include Pence's amendment to defund Planned Parenthood.
[00:29:07.694 --> 00:29:18.498]  And he points out that when principled conservatives, as we talked about earlier, Mark Meadows and others said no, we ran on repealing Obamacare, the Republican leadership wouldn't even bring that up for a vote.
[00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:25.881]  So the question is, there is no current talk about defunding Planned Parenthood in this reconciliation.
[00:29:26.441 --> 00:29:31.803]  And every time they have these emergency reconciliations, they don't use it to apply pressure to the other side.
[00:29:32.694 --> 00:29:37.755]  The Republican leadership always uses it to cave to fund what the other side wants.
[00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:42.897]  We saw that with the immediate funding of the climate treaty.
[00:29:43.237 --> 00:29:49.418]  As soon as they passed that in Paris, they had some Republicans bravely say, well, we'll see about that, whether that gets funded.
[00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:52.419]  Well, it took about three days for them to fund it with a continuing resolution.
[00:29:53.086 --> 00:30:02.148]  So the question is, are they not going to take out the funding for Planned Parenthood, but are they going to remove any funding for the border?
[00:30:03.048 --> 00:30:11.510]  And of course, as he says, you can either fulfill the campaign promises that got the president elected, or you can appease congressional Democrats and the liberal press.
[00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.591]  Which will it be?
[00:30:13.071 --> 00:30:20.313]  Meanwhile, all the talk about the border has led to a top Mexican official saying that maybe what they might do is
[00:30:22.173 --> 00:30:22.654]  We're good.
[00:30:39.363 --> 00:30:41.145]  We got an idea, and this is a great idea.
[00:30:41.165 --> 00:30:43.568]  This came from Senator Ted Cruz this morning.
[00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:47.752]  He went on Fox & Friends, and he said, how about getting El Chapo?
[00:30:48.453 --> 00:30:50.455]  The Sinaloa cartel.
[00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:51.757]  El Chapo, okay?
[00:30:52.337 --> 00:30:55.641]  He says it's estimated that his criminal fortune is worth $14 billion.
[00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:57.003]  We could have him pay for the wall.
[00:30:57.423 --> 00:31:02.447]  He said, coincidentally, the estimates for the cost to build a wall range from $14 to $20 billion.
[00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:12.414]  So my legislation provides if those assets are forfeited, those assets from El Chapo will go directly to building a wall and securing the border.
[00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:13.254]  How about that?
[00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:21.140]  You know, it was yesterday that I interviewed Ildefonso Ortiz, who's with Breitbart, Texas, covering the border issues.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.843]  And talking about the border being open, he said the border isn't open.
[00:31:25.697 --> 00:31:27.738]  The cartels control the border.
[00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:34.382]  If you want to pass across the border and you don't pay the cartels, they will come after you.
[00:31:34.502 --> 00:31:36.003]  They'll come after anyone who does that.
[00:31:36.884 --> 00:31:38.364]  So the reality is that there's already
[00:31:41.306 --> 00:31:41.446]  I think?
[00:32:00.163 --> 00:32:01.384]  We're good to go.
[00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:18.999]  We had rough parity between the U.S.
[00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:25.903]  and Mexico, but immediately they had a $14 billion trade surplus with us, and it has gone over $70 billion.
[00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.224]  Recent years it's been $60 billion.
[00:32:27.284 --> 00:32:38.592]  So the talk about possibly getting out of NAFTA caused the peso to drop precipitously, as well as stocks and currencies in both Mexico and Canada falling today.
[00:32:38.972 --> 00:32:44.997]  The White House is considering a draft executive order to withdraw the United States from NAFTA.
[00:32:45.777 --> 00:32:46.698]  I hope this happens.
[00:32:47.238 --> 00:32:55.285]  And of course, if you want to charge us just for talking about it, understand that talk can be very expensive for your economy as well.
[00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:55.725]  Stay with us.
[00:32:55.885 --> 00:32:56.526]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:03.971]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:04.992]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.132 --> 00:33:06.572]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.892 --> 00:33:07.692]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:08.612]  What has changed?
[00:33:08.992 --> 00:33:11.213]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.313 --> 00:33:13.133]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:16.754]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.974 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.999]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:58.801]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.883]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.683 --> 00:37:13.995]  Back before the 2016 elections caused the parasitic adulation of Hillary Clinton to shift into a higher gear, NBC News actually reported this.
[00:37:14.255 --> 00:37:23.966]  According to internal State Department memos, the agency might have called off or intervened an investigation into possibly illegal and inappropriate behavior within its ranks.
[00:37:24.546 --> 00:37:26.807]  Fast forward to April 2017, and by all accounts,
[00:37:45.051 --> 00:37:55.699]  The Trump administration has waged a silent war due to the lack of any mainstream media coverage of the underbelly of a human trafficking network of pedophiles.
[00:37:56.199 --> 00:38:04.386]  I want to make it clear today that my administration will focus on ending the absolutely horrific practice of human trafficking.
[00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:12.832]  And I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government to the federal and at the federal level.
[00:38:13.482 --> 00:38:16.444]  And the other highest levels that we can do.
[00:38:16.984 --> 00:38:23.828]  Already arresting 1,500 in three months, compared to 400 by the Obama administration in all of 2014.
[00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:35.236]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions holds no quarter in his efforts to undermine this pervasive horror, regardless of Nancy Pelosi and the deep state efforts to take him down.
[00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:37.637]  There you go.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.061]  Oh, Susan!
[00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:50.353]  I have for over a decade been working with a number of people on pedophilia as an elite privilege.
[00:38:50.773 --> 00:38:53.577]  For the Democrats, it's actually an acquired taste.
[00:38:54.349 --> 00:39:02.175]  The Republicans and the elite in banking are the ones who have really made this a big league thing.
[00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:11.462]  Now, I'm really pleased that Jeff Sessions and James Comey, who appears to have turned around somewhat, they're going after the pedophiles among the elite.
[00:39:11.962 --> 00:39:14.784]  A number of arrests are expected in the next week or two.
[00:39:14.804 --> 00:39:17.146]  And that's putting them on notice.
[00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:18.167]  That's putting them on notice, isn't it?
[00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:20.248]  Yes, it is putting them on notice.
[00:39:20.348 --> 00:39:21.969]  These people are extremely vulnerable.
[00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:28.913]  A doctor, policeman, a judge, and even a former military contractor with DynCorp International have been hauled in.
[00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:40.040]  The New York Daily News reports a retired army general who worked in the Pentagon has been hit with multiple rape charges for the alleged assault of at least one minor three decades ago.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.622]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[00:40:02.335 --> 00:40:10.658]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[00:40:11.598 --> 00:40:18.501]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines.
[00:40:19.221 --> 00:40:21.363]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[00:40:21.443 --> 00:40:24.906]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[00:40:25.086 --> 00:40:32.613]  Corporations can get out of the penalty box, if you will, and be permitted to engage in contracts with the government.
[00:40:32.653 --> 00:40:35.716]  They're generally not barred in perpetuity.
[00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:39.178]  This company was never in the penalty box.
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:44.603]  DynCorp especially did not want the American public to know what was going on.
[00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:57.712]  All of the publicity that took place, the majority of the publicity that took place in my case, took place in Europe and overseas because I had to sue DynCorp in the United Kingdom because my contract was governed under the laws of England.
[00:40:58.713 --> 00:41:11.244]  After I won my case, in addition to what DynCorp did with settling out of court with several other whistleblowers, they realized that, gee, maybe the United Kingdom's not the best place to be governing our contracts under since we lose cases here.
[00:41:11.904 --> 00:41:16.889]  So since that time, they now underwrite their contracts in places like Dubai and Singapore.
[00:41:17.577 --> 00:41:28.266]  Recently, Ronald Bernard, a Dutch banker who put in years of hard work to rise to the heights of the most exclusive elite financial network, shared his experiences.
[00:41:28.466 --> 00:41:33.931]  Nowadays, we still talk about 8,8500 people in the world who run the entire world.
[00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:38.454]  Let's put it this way, I was training to become a psychopath and I failed.
[00:41:38.774 --> 00:41:41.176]  These people, most of them, were Luciferians.
[00:41:42.037 --> 00:41:47.629]  But then at some point I was invited, which is why I'm telling you all this, to participate in sacrifices.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.841]  That was the breaking point.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:40.678]  That which hides in darkness is best known by being brought into the light.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.523]  Secret societies and mystical orders have existed since the dawn of time.
[00:42:55.283 --> 00:43:09.571]  Some orders, such as the Essenes of John the Baptist, existed for the selfless betterment of humanity, whereas other orders, such as the Solar Temple, existed for the selfish benefit of a few.
[00:43:10.794 --> 00:43:25.225]  As a metaphor, Jim Henson's classic, The Dark Crystal, captures the struggle between good and evil secret orders through the struggle for power between the Skeksis and the Mystics over the Dark Crystal.
[00:43:26.986 --> 00:43:38.155]  To quote Jeremy Preston, to rid ourselves of our shadows, who we are, we must step into either total light or total darkness.
[00:43:41.863 --> 00:43:50.626]  Los Angeles, California is home to a vast number of secret societies, New Age organizations, and satanic cults.
[00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:52.747]  There's even a bus tour!
[00:43:52.767 --> 00:44:02.731]  At the center of academic research into occult manuscripts, sacred rites, and rituals was the book collector Manly P. Hall.
[00:44:03.271 --> 00:44:19.484]  Friend to renowned academics, celebrities, and politicians, Hall amassed the largest collection of rare esoteric books and manuscripts in North America into what became the Philosophical Research Society and Library.
[00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:21.090]  It's
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:46.482]  These satanic manuscripts and stuff that dabbles in black magic, these are kept there for purposes of history, of records.
[00:44:46.782 --> 00:44:49.662]  It's so that people can know what it is when they see it.
[00:44:49.682 --> 00:44:53.063]  It's how to identify what it is.
[00:44:53.443 --> 00:45:04.145]  Paul kept files of what he referred to as con artists, people who used occult doctrines for profit, such as fortune tellers, seance performers,
[00:45:04.565 --> 00:45:05.586]  We're good to go.
[00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:30.705]  He would eventually play victim to what his widow referred to as a satanic murder.
[00:45:31.205 --> 00:45:47.658]  Con men looking to obtain possession of rare alchemy books alleged to contain the elixir of life took advantage of Hall in his later years and murdered him seeking the secret knowledge of immortality.
[00:45:48.379 --> 00:46:04.367]  Through nasty court battles and investigations into Hall's untimely death, his widow sold some of these sought-after alchemical manuscripts to the Getty Museum, where they were reposed as a private collection under lock and key.
[00:46:21.055 --> 00:46:30.861]  We have been able to obtain digital copies of these manuscripts and I must warn you, these are graphic and they are not for the faint of heart.
[00:46:31.482 --> 00:46:40.828]  Many of these manuscripts are hundreds of years old and they contain what elite believe to be the secret of immortality.
[00:46:41.428 --> 00:46:57.695]  We shall examine how evil is being used to dominate our culture through a subversive plan to change the cultural landscape of society, targeting children and young adults with sophisticated propaganda.
[00:47:02.998 --> 00:47:07.720]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:04.169]  I tried it.
[00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.310]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.434 --> 00:48:49.475]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.158]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.518 --> 00:48:59.067]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.087 --> 00:48:59.968]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.988 --> 00:49:00.028]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.944]  Today there were massive nuclear response drills in New York and elsewhere.
[00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:12.948]  Northern New Jersey, federal authorities were running nuclear response drills.
[00:49:13.129 --> 00:49:16.192]  They used MetLife Stadium as well as other places.
[00:49:16.232 --> 00:49:21.196]  Homeland Security and FEMA were conducting what they called Operation Gotham Shield.
[00:49:22.997 --> 00:49:29.861]  To practice how to assess, treat, and evacuate victims during a potential nuclear attack in the New York City area.
[00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:37.845]  The drill simulated a scenario in which a 10,000 ton improvised nuclear device goes off on the New Jersey side of the Lincoln Tunnel.
[00:49:38.365 --> 00:49:44.948]  And I gotta say that of course they would have this go off as part of a ship that was coming in or something like that.
[00:49:44.968 --> 00:49:46.069]  That would be the scenario because
[00:49:46.869 --> 00:49:51.654]  The ICBM scenario is nonsense coming out of North Korea.
[00:49:51.854 --> 00:49:55.978]  They can't get a missile off the launch pad, certainly not an intercontinental ballistic missile.
[00:49:56.479 --> 00:50:08.051]  So they have these types of drills going on, and you know when I look at this, and we understand that the Cold War has been restarted, that they want to get everybody concerned about this, of course they're not going to do any
[00:50:09.472 --> 00:50:13.375]  Civil defense, just like they didn't back in the 1950s and 1960s.
[00:50:13.435 --> 00:50:17.058]  Our country didn't really do any civil defense for its citizens.
[00:50:17.138 --> 00:50:21.522]  Instead, they created these kinds of little propaganda videos.
[00:50:21.982 --> 00:50:22.783]  Duck and cover.
[00:50:22.823 --> 00:50:23.404]  Remember this?
[00:50:23.964 --> 00:50:26.846]  I have a lot of nostalgia about this.
[00:50:27.247 --> 00:50:28.608]  Not good nostalgia.
[00:50:28.708 --> 00:50:29.849]  Let's take a look at this.
[00:50:29.909 --> 00:50:31.070]  Maybe you recall this.
[00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:34.713]  Maybe you're old enough to see this for what it was.
[00:50:35.373 --> 00:50:37.735]  It was something that I remember from my childhood.
[00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:40.058]  With the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:45.162]  He knew just what to do.
[00:50:45.262 --> 00:50:53.790]  He ducked and covered, and as they told us during the Cuban Missile Crisis when I lived in Florida, make sure that you stick your head in your desk.
[00:50:55.003 --> 00:50:58.888]  And even at a young age, I thought, what good is that going to do me?
[00:50:58.908 --> 00:51:09.621]  Of course, they did not create any kind of defense, but that is the propaganda that is part of this, the drills, the fear that they want to put into everybody.
[00:51:10.582 --> 00:51:13.663]  And we see this being hyped up on both sides.
[00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:20.466]  Yesterday, we had Kim Jong-un shooting off his guns in defiance to show what a big man he was.
[00:51:20.646 --> 00:51:26.948]  And today, the US and South Korea stage their military drills to show what big men they are.
[00:51:27.988 --> 00:51:30.891]  They stage a powerful military drill amid rising tensions.
[00:51:30.931 --> 00:51:31.612]  This is RT.
[00:51:31.632 --> 00:51:32.292]  They say the U.S.
[00:51:32.332 --> 00:51:40.860]  and South Korean militaries have taken part in a combined firing drill as part of joint exercises amid increased tensions with Pyongyang.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.923]  Comes just a day after the North launched its own military drill.
[00:51:43.943 --> 00:51:49.008]  There were more than 2,000 South Korean and American troops involved in Wednesday's drill in South Korea.
[00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:52.569]  They say the exercises lasted for 45 minutes.
[00:51:52.629 --> 00:51:58.031]  It came just a day after North Korea staged its own military drill to mark the founding of the country's army.
[00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:09.034]  North Korea called the drills the largest ever to be hosted by the country, while state media reported that leader Kim Jong-un personally observed the exercises, making it so much more valuable.
[00:52:10.655 --> 00:52:16.939]  President Trump continued to take a hardline stance against North Korea, sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean Peninsula.
[00:52:16.979 --> 00:52:23.064]  The Chinese government has called on all sides to show restraint, maintain stability and security in the region.
[00:52:23.124 --> 00:52:24.865]  Yes, please, can we act like adults?
[00:52:25.605 --> 00:52:28.728]  I don't want to revisit the fear, the paranoia,
[00:52:29.508 --> 00:52:31.008]  That we had during the Cold War.
[00:52:31.028 --> 00:52:32.209]  I don't want another Cold War.
[00:52:32.869 --> 00:52:34.229]  I don't want to see this all revived.
[00:52:34.249 --> 00:52:35.710]  I don't want another Korean War.
[00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.931]  Our first police-military action.
[00:52:39.691 --> 00:52:45.933]  This is clearly insanity and I hope that we can get these domestic issues passed so that Donald Trump can feel better.
[00:52:46.453 --> 00:52:52.515]  Feel better that he doesn't have to go start foreign wars in order to increase his prestige and popularity at home.
[00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:57.338]  I hope this doesn't happen, but there are some bad signs about this.
[00:52:57.398 --> 00:53:06.129]  We see in a story at Infowars.com, neocon Paul Wolfowitz has been speaking privately with McMaster and with Mattis.
[00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:08.372]  And this is reported from Politico.
[00:53:09.366 --> 00:53:14.573]  They say to liberals and other critics, Wolfowitz would be the last person that they want Trump to listen to.
[00:53:14.653 --> 00:53:26.888]  Long a lightning rod, because the havoc that he unleashed in the Iraq invasion, Wolfowitz has never apologized for advocating the war, although he has said and repeated in our conversation that it was not carried out as he would have wanted it to be.
[00:53:27.529 --> 00:53:37.462]  In recent days he's jumped right back into the public debate nudging President Trump from the pages of the Wall Street Journal to follow up his bombing strike in Syria with more aggressive action.
[00:53:38.042 --> 00:53:44.110]  And he tells me, privately emailing Trump Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R.
[00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:44.650]  McMaster,
[00:53:45.191 --> 00:54:02.348]  Both longtime contacts since his Bush days in hopes that they will pursue a US strategy of stepping up engagement in the Middle East, promoting more wars, deeper, broader wars, regime changes that will drive refugees from those countries
[00:54:03.097 --> 00:54:06.520]  Where they create war, chaos, and create terrorism.
[00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:14.967]  Driving those people into our countries as refugees so they can have war, chaos, and terrorism in our border.
[00:54:15.328 --> 00:54:16.909]  That will be the result of this policy.
[00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:18.390]  It will be further chaos.
[00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:20.412]  This is absolutely insanity.
[00:54:20.893 --> 00:54:24.195]  And the question is, do these people control Donald Trump?
[00:54:24.716 --> 00:54:28.859]  All these people who oppose Donald Trump so much, all these neocons like Wolfowitz,
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.780]  Now they love him.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.901]  Now they think they have an inside to him.
[00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:34.081]  And perhaps they do.
[00:54:34.882 --> 00:54:38.863]  As this article says, as I said before, there's been a deep state neocon coup.
[00:54:39.463 --> 00:54:42.204]  It's getting clearer by the day that Trump is no longer running the show.
[00:54:42.784 --> 00:54:49.046]  He wouldn't even play hardball with the Democrats to get a measly 1.4 billion dollars to build the wall.
[00:54:50.146 --> 00:54:57.229]  And the New American points out that it is a bizarre reversal that we saw Trump seeking to empower the UN.
[00:54:57.509 --> 00:55:01.571]  Remember on Monday he had the UN Security Council go to the White House.
[00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.791]  Today he had the Senate come in.
[00:55:03.831 --> 00:55:09.434]  There were buses of senators, all 100 senators coming in to hype the war with North Korea.
[00:55:10.574 --> 00:55:14.636]  But it's very troubling what is coming out as to what he said to the UN.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.801]  As The New American points out, despite regularly ridiculing the U.N.
[00:55:19.041 --> 00:55:21.681]  and repeatedly proposing a scaled-back U.S.
[00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:27.763]  role in it, President Trump struck a very different tone this week, calling for empowering the U.N.
[00:55:27.823 --> 00:55:33.324]  Dictators Club to somehow solve the North Korean issue with Syria and other problems.
[00:55:34.044 --> 00:55:36.004]  At this meeting on Monday, he demanded that the U.N.
[00:55:36.044 --> 00:55:41.685]  be ready to impose new sanctions if Communist Chinese-backed North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un does not cooperate.
[00:55:42.506 --> 00:55:43.626]  And here's what he had to say.
[00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:51.298]  He said the UN has been an underperformer, but it has a huge potential.
[00:55:52.182 --> 00:56:01.705]  He said, even though during the campaign he called them a globalist cabal with international bankers seeking what he called global government for humanity.
[00:56:01.905 --> 00:56:03.685]  He was right as candidate.
[00:56:04.306 --> 00:56:08.147]  But now he's saying that it has huge potential to solve the problem.
[00:56:08.727 --> 00:56:10.027]  And then it gets even more troubling.
[00:56:10.747 --> 00:56:15.469]  Trump, as they point out in New American, continued outlining his vision, his new vision now.
[00:56:16.363 --> 00:56:19.206]  for the UN, radically expanding it.
[00:56:19.927 --> 00:56:28.596]  And this is what he had to say, quote, I see a day when there's a conflict where the United Nations, you get together and you solve the conflict.
[00:56:29.813 --> 00:56:31.494]  I think that's going to start happening now.
[00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:32.415]  I can see it.
[00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:36.518]  And the United Nations will get together and solve conflicts.
[00:56:36.858 --> 00:56:37.979]  It won't be two countries.
[00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:42.101]  It'll be the United Nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries.
[00:56:42.522 --> 00:56:46.584]  Or maybe imposing their own globalist solution on countries.
[00:56:47.665 --> 00:56:52.788]  He said, so I see fantastic potential, fantastic things ahead for the United Nations.
[00:56:54.122 --> 00:56:57.765]  I see troubling times ahead for us if this were to happen.
[00:56:57.845 --> 00:56:59.187]  I'm very concerned that's going to happen.
[00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:08.034]  And of course today, as I said, after meeting first with the UN, today he met with senators and then later this week he's going to meet with the House of Representatives.
[00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:10.556]  So are we seeing a replay?
[00:57:11.721 --> 00:57:13.563]  of what we saw in previous administrations.
[00:57:13.603 --> 00:57:27.076]  Remember when then-Senator Jeff Sessions, now Attorney General Sessions, remember when he quizzed Leon Panetta, who at that time was Defense Secretary, and said, under what circumstances would you go to war?
[00:57:27.537 --> 00:57:31.661]  And he goes, well we would consult with our allies, we'd consult with NATO and the UN and so forth.
[00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.082]  And he goes, well I don't believe
[00:57:33.923 --> 00:57:35.183]  I'm hearing this correctly.
[00:57:35.203 --> 00:57:37.164]  You're a former congressman.
[00:57:37.184 --> 00:57:43.245]  You know the Constitution requires that Congress declare war, that the President consult with Congress.
[00:57:43.465 --> 00:57:47.626]  You can talk to these people afterwards, but you have to get permission from Congress.
[00:57:47.986 --> 00:57:54.747]  And he goes, we'd probably tell them what we have decided, but we would consult and make the decision with NATO and the UN and with our other allies.
[00:57:55.348 --> 00:57:56.808]  Is that what we're seeing this week?
[00:57:58.089 --> 00:57:58.769]  Is that what we're seeing?
[00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:03.252]  Did Trump already make this decision in consulting with the UN, with NATO?
[00:58:03.572 --> 00:58:14.018]  Is he now advising the Senate and the House as to what they are going to do, acting unilaterally, without congressional support, without a congressional declaration of war?
[00:58:14.298 --> 00:58:15.319]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:58:16.615 --> 00:58:21.342]  Senator Cruz today called it a long and detailed briefing according to ABC News.
[00:58:21.863 --> 00:58:29.536]  They say the senators were invited at the personal invitation of President Trump after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell requested a briefing.
[00:58:30.484 --> 00:58:32.746]  Maybe the American people should have a briefing.
[00:58:33.326 --> 00:58:38.070]  Maybe the American people should be asked if they want to revive the Cold War.
[00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:43.654]  If they want to revive the Korean War after 64 years of a ceasefire.
[00:58:44.014 --> 00:58:45.555]  Maybe we should have something to say.
[00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:50.159]  Maybe they should make the case to us and we can talk to our congressman.
[00:58:50.859 --> 00:58:51.901]  And keep the U.N.
[00:58:52.081 --> 00:58:52.382]  out of it.
[00:58:52.422 --> 00:58:53.464]  I don't believe that the U.N.
[00:58:53.484 --> 00:58:56.529]  and I don't think anybody who voted for Donald Trump wants to see the U.N.
[00:58:56.609 --> 00:58:57.411]  dictating these terms.
[00:58:57.671 --> 00:58:58.733]  That's it for tonight's news.
