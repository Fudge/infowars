[00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.676]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.257]  It's Monday, July 17th, 2017.
[00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:24.638]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:25.878]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.635]  It's the rise of the Clinton body count.
[00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:48.815]  Attorneys in the DNC fraud lawsuit grow nervous and they are demanding protection as bodies continue to pile up from the latest wave of mysterious deaths linked to the Clinton crime family.
[00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:57.250]  Then, the establishment wants you to believe that America's anti-Trumpers are grassroots.
[00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:07.056]  But a closer look reveals how big money liberals are bankrolling the strategic plan to take down the president.
[00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:12.239]  All that plus good news for those who prefer to buy American.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.242]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.206]  We're good to go.

[00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:02.883]  Oh, no.
[00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:23.314]  We are truly living in unprecedented times, and it just hits me in waves how unbelievable reality really is.
[00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:25.495]  It's like I can't even fully comprehend it.
[00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:34.060]  But here we are, hurtling through time and space on planet Earth together on this great, mysterious adventure known as life.
[00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:41.086]  And it's nice to be an American citizen and have a president that cares about you.
[00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:43.808]  To have a president that cares about America.
[00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:46.590]  To have an American president.
[00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:52.615]  And President Trump made that apparent today when he declared today, July 17th, 2017, as Made in America Day.
[00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:53.336]  So this is the inaugural
[00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:06.752]  Made in America InfoWars Nightly News broadcast because today is the inaugural Made in America Day.
[00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:15.180]  Yes, and as you can see this tweet from Sean Spicer, it was really quite a spectacle, quite a showcase in Washington today at the White House.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.242]  One, I'm not sure there's ever been anything the likes of before.
[00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.423]  If you were in Washington D.C.
[00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:26.906]  and you caught the showcase, you saw all kinds of American products, American engineering.
[00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:37.592]  There you see some helicopters, food, golf clubs, plates, silverware, tractors, helicopters, airplanes, fishing poles, telescopes.
[00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.153]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:43.970]  And this was all on display today in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.672]  as part of Made in America Day.
[00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:54.917]  Of course, this week, July 16th through July 22nd, will now be known as Made in America Week.
[00:04:55.278 --> 00:05:01.882]  And I just want to read this proclamation that Donald Trump made today, and then we'll go to some of the highlights from his speech.
[00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:05.445]  This was from President Trump, a proclamation today.
[00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:13.590]  Today, we mark the first Made in America Day and recognize the vital contributions of American workers and job creators to our nation's prosperity and strength.
[00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.572]  Boy, that's refreshing, instead of a, you didn't build that business, someone else did.
[00:05:17.973 --> 00:05:26.258]  America owes much of its success to the determination and ingenuity of its entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers who drive our economy and support our military strength.
[00:05:27.247 --> 00:05:36.592]  And you can see he's returning the power of the American worker back to the American worker where the American worker was disappearing before.
[00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:40.895]  America and work ethic and quality craftsmanship are at the heart and soul of our nation.
[00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:43.596]  We are a nation of innovators, builders and farmers.
[00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:48.299]  We construct architectural wonders like the Golden Gate Bridge and the New York skyline.
[00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.360]  We feed the nation and the world with
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.880]  We're good.
[00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:18.165]  Have hereunto set my hand this 17th day of July in the year of our Lord 2017 and of the independence of the United States of America, the 242nd Donald J. Trump.
[00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:21.067]  So today is officially Made in America Day.
[00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:29.912]  And after, or during the showcase of all these great American products today in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump, President Donald Trump gave a speech.
[00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:31.393]  Here are some of those highlights.
[00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:42.983]  We saw so many great companies, but the gentleman who was in charge of Omaha, beef, they do beef, he hugged me, he wanted to kiss me so badly.
[00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:51.888]  Because he said, our business is a whole different business now because you got China approved, the other administrations couldn't even come close.
[00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.234]  And I told him, you know how long it took?
[00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:55.475]  One sentence.
[00:06:56.236 --> 00:07:02.360]  I said, President Xi, we'd love to sell beef back in China again.
[00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:04.602]  He said, you can do that.
[00:07:05.022 --> 00:07:05.823]  That was the end of that.
[00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:07.304]  Made in the USA.
[00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:08.865]  We're going to start doing that again.
[00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:12.628]  We're going to put that brand on our product because it means it's the best.
[00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:22.015]  In just a few moments, I'll be signing a presidential proclamation to launch Made in America Week and to make today Made in America Day.
[00:07:22.847 --> 00:07:31.771]  We want to build, create, and grow more products in our country using American labor, American goods, and American grit.
[00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:46.179]  When we purchase products made in the USA, the profits stay here, the revenue stays here, and the jobs, maybe most importantly of all, they stay right here in the USA.
[00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.961]  We hope John McCain gets better very soon, because we miss him.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.864]  He's a crusty voice in Washington.
[00:07:55.404 --> 00:07:56.786]  Plus, we need his vote.
[00:07:58.408 --> 00:08:07.459]  Since the beginning of the year, we have already created over 50,000 brand new manufacturing jobs, and we're just getting started.
[00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:12.141]  We will lift our citizens from welfare to work.
[00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:18.446]  We will turn boarded up communities into new outposts of American commerce.
[00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:19.607]  That's almost every inner city.
[00:08:19.628 --> 00:08:24.612]  And we will once again rediscover our heritage as a manufacturing nation.
[00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:26.814]  We used to be a manufacturing nation.
[00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:30.838]  Reciprocity, my favorite word, reciprocity.
[00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:35.807]  Because we have countries that charge us 100% tax on a product.
[00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:41.389]  And when that product is sold by them to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing.
[00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.770]  And people say, oh, that's free trade.
[00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.330]  No, that's stupid trade.
[00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:49.192]  Oh, what happens in Washington, you just wouldn't believe the things.
[00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:51.412]  A-level playing field.
[00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:53.513]  I don't want to say any more than a level.
[00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.635]  But if the playing field were slanted, like, a little bit toward us, I'd accept that also.
[00:08:59.275 --> 00:08:59.635]  Okay?
[00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:08.102]  So once again, we will celebrate craftsmen, producers, innovators like the incredible men and women in this room today.
[00:09:08.993 --> 00:09:17.117]  We will protect our workers, promote our industry, and be proud of our history, because we will put America first.
[00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:20.439]  America will be first again.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.362]  And we'll meet in this same room in a year, and in two years, and you'll see what happens.
[00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:28.003]  Thank you all for being here.
[00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:30.625]  God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:31.385]  Thank you very much.
[00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:32.826]  That's an interesting benchmark there.
[00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:38.429]  President Trump saying we'll meet again in one year, two years on Made in America Day and we'll see the progress we've made.
[00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:43.412]  Wow, I look forward to July 17th, 2018 so we can actually see that.
[00:09:43.452 --> 00:09:44.232]  But it's refreshing.
[00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:48.555]  Again, not a president up there lecturing you about how you didn't build your business.
[00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:56.520]  Not a president up there lecturing you about how when you innovate, when you create, when you expand, you're just killing the climate, you're killing the earth with global warming.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.440]  None of that.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.382]  It's about America first, American ingenuity.
[00:10:00.962 --> 00:10:06.803]  Now Trump is going to have to answer these questions and I figured I might as well cover this just so people don't cry that we didn't.
[00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:12.105]  Washington Com post, Amazon post, Trump's made in America week is a hypocritical joke.
[00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:16.166]  Now of course the Washington Post completely misunderstands this.
[00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:20.527]  The Washington Post and liberal media can't even look at news without
[00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:25.390]  Looking at it through the lens of how can I angle this against President Trump?
[00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.792]  Yes, you are right, Washington Post.
[00:10:28.153 --> 00:10:31.675]  Most of Trump's products are made overseas.
[00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:33.117]  You are right about that.
[00:10:33.357 --> 00:10:36.119]  But that's not what this day is about.
[00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:40.022]  This is about not ripping on Donald Trump because his products are made overseas.
[00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:40.462]  This is about
[00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:52.773]  Promoting products to be made in America to make that pop culture again to make that how we make America great again But I have to say now President Trump can't be involved in any of these business dealings.
[00:10:52.813 --> 00:10:56.636]  I don't think anymore I think he's handed that over mostly in part to Don jr.
[00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:58.998]  But it would be a huge statement
[00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:12.069]  If next year you came back on Made in America Day and all Trump ties and Trump wines and Trump steaks, all of them, were made in America, that could be a huge statement that Don Jr.
[00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:12.649]  could make.
[00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.693]  Obviously, President Trump can't be involved in that stuff, I don't think, in any way, shape, or form now that he's president.
[00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:25.197]  But that would be a huge, great example to set and a way to continue to push the narrative that the pop culture is now made in America.
[00:11:26.098 --> 00:11:27.459]  Made in America Day, now official.
[00:11:27.499 --> 00:11:29.780]  We'll see you again in a year, President Trump.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.141]  See how that progress works out.
[00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.024]  Now, this is an interesting story from the Washington Examiner.
[00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:45.410]  Now, Carl Bernstein was on CNN talking to Brian Stelter, and he talked about a media cold civil war, and it's just amazing.
[00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.392]  Again, you see Hillary Clinton starting the resistance pack.
[00:11:48.612 --> 00:11:51.014]  You see Carl Bernstein saying cold civil war.
[00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.291]  This is InfoWars.
[00:11:54.991 --> 00:11:57.112]  This is the InfoWars culture.
[00:11:57.172 --> 00:11:58.813]  This is what we've been talking about.
[00:11:58.873 --> 00:12:00.734]  This is what we started from the grassroots.
[00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:04.216]  So it's funny to see the establishment trying to steer this towards themselves.
[00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:06.257]  Oh, we're in the information war.
[00:12:06.498 --> 00:12:07.878]  We're in the war for truth now.
[00:12:08.198 --> 00:12:09.539]  Oh, we're the resistance.
[00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:11.380]  No, we've been the resistance.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.181]  We've been in the information war.
[00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:21.586]  Now we're kicking your ass and controlling the narrative and you don't know what to do about it because you've been fake news since day one.
[00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.792]  Now this is an interesting story.
[00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:29.854]  China is censoring Winnie the Pooh, and it's because Winnie the Pooh has become a meme.
[00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:37.857]  And the reason I talk about this is because we need to realize that net neutrality is not what they're selling it as.
[00:12:38.277 --> 00:12:51.642]  Net neutrality is one step into more government control of the internet, one step closer to communist-style censorship, where you can't even make a joke on the internet about the president in China, President Xi Jinping,
[00:12:52.242 --> 00:12:52.583]  I don't know.
[00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:10.303]  Can you believe that?
[00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:16.267]  Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and he recently died in Chinese custody.
[00:13:16.487 --> 00:13:20.149]  They went out on the street and said, they were asking Chinese people, have you heard of Liu Xiaobo?
[00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:21.390]  Do you know who Liu Xiaobo is?
[00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.052]  Nobel Peace Prize winner, Chinese citizen?
[00:13:24.532 --> 00:13:30.697]  Nobody knows who he is because the internet censorship, the Chinese communist erased him from history.
[00:13:31.437 --> 00:13:32.638]  That's not what we can have.
[00:13:32.718 --> 00:13:34.980]  That's not what we can accept in our country.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.203]  And now this is something that I'm shocked more people aren't outcried over.
[00:13:39.243 --> 00:13:40.584]  We can't accept this anywhere.
[00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:45.628]  Fury at Fukushima, over 1 billion pounds of nuclear waste dumped into the sea.
[00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:47.130]  The decision's already been made.
[00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.273]  So you've got these local fishermen raising a huge fuss about this.
[00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:54.816]  A billion tons of tritium
[00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:59.275]  Are being dumped into Tritium.
[00:13:59.315 --> 00:13:59.736]  Thank you.
[00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:00.877]  I'm not a chemist.
[00:14:01.777 --> 00:14:04.679]  Tritium is being dumped into the ocean.
[00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:06.781]  You can see the results of this behind me.
[00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:11.785]  Nobody's freaking out about this, but now you're racist if you want to save the planet.
[00:14:12.005 --> 00:14:13.366]  Here's a report from Leanne McAdoo.
[00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.655]  Well, it's a new week and a new liberal predicament.
[00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:31.843]  This time, is it racist or is it a politically incorrect reality that we must face in order to stop the ravages of man-made climate change?
[00:14:32.283 --> 00:14:33.564]  Dun-dun-dun!
[00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:39.051]  This time, we find the French President Emmanuel Macron in the hot seat.
[00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:44.437]  He's immediately been deemed a racist for some remarks he made following the G20 summit.
[00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:52.347]  In a rather unguarded way, the French President dissed African fertility when he was asked about the development of Africa at the G20.
[00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:52.588]  He said,
[00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:58.014]  Seven to eight children African women are having is a civilizational problem.
[00:14:58.275 --> 00:14:59.436]  It demands a solution.
[00:14:59.717 --> 00:15:08.227]  He said we can spend billions of euros on them, but it won't stabilize anything when countries are still having seven or eight children per women.
[00:15:09.327 --> 00:15:10.387]  Racist!
[00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:12.108]  Wait a minute, I thought he was the good guy.
[00:15:12.148 --> 00:15:18.129]  I thought that French elected the good guy and not his racist, xenophobic, hateful opponent.
[00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:19.509]  I digress.
[00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:31.431]  Immediately after making these statements, Quartz Magazine, for instance, a left-wing online media site, said, yes, Macron's civilizational Africa statement is problematic, but it's also very French.
[00:15:31.912 --> 00:15:33.232]  Yes, of course it's racist.
[00:15:33.672 --> 00:15:38.653]  But it's colonialist, so he's right in step with the colonialists before him.
[00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:43.517]  Here the Guardian, brand new Macron, same old colonialism.
[00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:50.244]  But here's where they just can't seem to get their story straight, where they can't seem to get their stance straight, the party of science.
[00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:57.131]  Just two days after that opinion piece came out in the Guardian, they have another piece, want to fight climate change?
[00:15:57.511 --> 00:15:59.092]  Have fewer children.
[00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:01.795]  Now, why isn't this article racist?
[00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.016]  Where's the uproar here?
[00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:08.781]  Is it because there's a picture of white babies that they're using to push this theory?
[00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:10.682]  Or who are they talking to?
[00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:13.845]  As we know, birth rates in the West are on the decline.
[00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:14.445]  U.S.
[00:16:14.485 --> 00:16:17.748]  fertility rates 2016 saw record lows.
[00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:24.794]  Europe, The Telegraph, they say, Europe is slowly dying despite an increasing world population.
[00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:34.499]  So this should be seen as a positive for people who are trying to fight climate change, but it's really being pushed as a pending, a looming crisis.
[00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:39.642]  There isn't going to be anyone to pay into the pensions or into the welfare system, especially in Germany.
[00:16:40.062 --> 00:16:43.444]  So now they're saying, well, the population rate is so low.
[00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:53.069]  Now we have to welcome in a massive amount of migrants, millions of migrants, these people who are having seven, eight kids per household.
[00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.412]  We need them in order to continue our welfare state to prop us up.
[00:16:57.752 --> 00:17:05.997]  Yet they are still telling their populations, in order to save the planet, you have to stop having children.
[00:17:06.237 --> 00:17:09.980]  Someone actually points that out on Twitter in this article.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.281]  That most of the leaders of these nations don't have any kids.
[00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:21.143]  So, of course they don't care about the continuation of their culture because they don't even have any kids.
[00:17:21.183 --> 00:17:24.664]  They don't care that their entire nations are changing before their very eyes.
[00:17:24.724 --> 00:17:26.605]  The demographic of these countries are changing.
[00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.325]  Is this how the caliphate begins?
[00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:29.986]  You know, let's not forget.
[00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:35.907]  There was an imam who told Muslim migrants to breed children with Europeans in order to conquer their countries.
[00:17:36.367 --> 00:17:37.948]  We will trample them underfoot.
[00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:42.272]  Sheikh Mohammed Ayed gave this speech at a mosque in Jerusalem.
[00:17:42.472 --> 00:17:48.958]  So telling people to have fewer children is totally okay as long as you're speaking to Western Europeans or to white people.
[00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.763]  But you shan't dare say that politically incorrect thing to Africans.
[00:17:54.063 --> 00:18:00.029]  Although one liberal has said that Africa's rapid population growth will submerge Europe.
[00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:01.751]  That's right, the billionaire Bill Gates.
[00:18:02.231 --> 00:18:09.817]  And he actually said a solution to the crisis would be to close Europe's borders and give more in foreign aid to Africa to help stabilize the continent.
[00:18:10.197 --> 00:18:23.387]  But again, we are circling back around to Macron's racist comments where he said we can throw billions of euros at the countries, but this overpopulation problem is going to continue to be an issue that must be solved.
[00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:24.868]  So, liberals gotta decide.
[00:18:24.908 --> 00:18:28.070]  They can't just shriek racism at every single thing that's uttered.
[00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.993]  Do we need to stop having fewer children in order to save the planet and help stabilize nations?
[00:18:34.553 --> 00:18:39.396]  Or is that only okay to say to white people and Europeans?
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:05.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:05.199 --> 00:23:09.860]  The DNC fraud lawsuit continues to be ignored by the mainstream media.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.621]  Meanwhile, the Clinton body count continues to grow.
[00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:18.522]  Now, Jared Beck is representing the plaintiffs in the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[00:23:18.562 --> 00:23:19.722]  We spoke to him in the past.
[00:23:20.042 --> 00:23:25.043]  We are now joined by his wife, also an attorney in Miami, Florida, Elizabeth Lee Beck.
[00:23:25.343 --> 00:23:26.923]  Elizabeth, thank you for joining us today.
[00:23:28.484 --> 00:23:29.204]  Thank you for having me.
[00:23:30.353 --> 00:23:32.914]  Well, Elizabeth, I wanted to get you on for a couple reasons.
[00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:43.621]  One, I wanted to keep the DNC fraud lawsuit in the narrative, in the talk, especially here because there's been no coverage whatsoever on mainstream media, at least that I could see.
[00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:46.722]  No talk about even the Bernie Sanders lawsuit.
[00:23:47.083 --> 00:23:56.048]  Being on the other side of this, seeing the actual inner workings, you know, seeing what Jared's doing behind the scenes, does it shock you to see that the mainstream media is completely ignoring this?
[00:23:59.352 --> 00:24:00.632]  Yeah.
[00:24:00.852 --> 00:24:02.813]  Do you remember Mr. Branton Wiseman?
[00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:05.353]  I'm sorry, who is that?
[00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:07.414]  Mr. Branton Wiseman?
[00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:09.654]  He passed away very suddenly.
[00:24:09.674 --> 00:24:19.196]  And when he passed away, there was some speculation that he was quite possibly connected to the DNC lawsuit.
[00:24:19.956 --> 00:24:23.597]  And we were contacted by many members of the public who expressed concern.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.841]  But I want to go through a timeline, some connections, if I may, Owen.
[00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:32.461]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:34.582]  Again, that's Barrington Wisenant.
[00:24:34.922 --> 00:24:36.602]  He was a federal prosecutor in Florida.
[00:24:36.722 --> 00:24:42.163]  He wound up dead on the beach with head trauma, and now you're talking about possible connections there.
[00:24:43.463 --> 00:24:47.284]  So, it's very convoluted, so you have to follow very closely, okay?
[00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:48.764]  Okay, number one.
[00:24:49.764 --> 00:24:52.185]  There is a Barrington Wisenant
[00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:57.830]  Jay Plotkin Jacksonville Connection.
[00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.531]  So follow me here.
[00:25:00.731 --> 00:25:11.494]  Jay Plotkin was the Director of the State Attorney's Office in Jacksonville from 1993 to 2009.
[00:25:16.764 --> 00:25:27.307]  Until January of 2009, he supervised all aspects of an office of 100 attorneys and over 300 support staff.
[00:25:29.747 --> 00:25:40.990]  Mr. Branton Wisnant is actually not a Miami native, even though he worked here and passed away in Broward County, which is in South Florida.
[00:25:42.011 --> 00:25:48.957]  To the contrary, Mr. Branton Wisnant is a native of Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:25:50.738 --> 00:26:03.068]  He graduated from Bishop Kenny High School in 1997 and worked as an assistant state attorney with the Fourth Judicial Circuit from 2004 through 2007.
[00:26:03.148 --> 00:26:04.048]  In other words,
[00:26:09.284 --> 00:26:17.626]  Mr. Branton Wisnant and Mr. Jay Plotkin worked in the state attorney's office at the same time.
[00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:21.107]  That's the Wisnant.
[00:26:21.807 --> 00:26:23.648]  Where does Jay Plotkin come into this?
[00:26:23.668 --> 00:26:24.948]  Because this is a new name to me.
[00:26:25.728 --> 00:26:26.509]  Jay Plotkin?
[00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.409]  Yes.
[00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:28.369]  Just bear with me.
[00:26:29.009 --> 00:26:29.409]  Okay.
[00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.371]  Now, there's a Jacksonville Mayo Clinic connection.
[00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:39.341]  Mayo Clinic has a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:47.325]  There's a Mayo Clinic-Judge Harvey Schlesinger connection.
[00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:59.331]  A lawsuit was filed in 2015 in federal court in Jacksonville against the Mayo Clinic in connection with an organ transplant case.
[00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:07.020]  The judge presiding over that case was the Honorable Harvey Schlesinger.
[00:27:09.321 --> 00:27:15.083]  There is a Judge Schlesinger-Jay Plotkin-Branton-Wiseman connection.
[00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:21.485]  Jay Plotkin is Judge Harvey Schlesinger's son-in-law.
[00:27:25.407 --> 00:27:28.428]  Mr. Wiseman's body was recovered on May 24, 2017.
[00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:44.008]  On June 8, 2017, Judge Schlesinger threw out the case against Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville on summary judgment.
[00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.952]  There is a Mayo Clinic-Clinton Foundation connection.
[00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:56.147]  A number of hospitals, including Mayo Clinic and St.
[00:27:56.208 --> 00:28:05.891]  Vincent's, co-sponsored a launch event in Northeast Florida in connection with the Clinton Health Matters Initiative.
[00:28:07.872 --> 00:28:12.214]  There is a Mayo Clinic High Government Officials Connection.
[00:28:13.393 --> 00:28:36.364]  The Emeritus Public Trustees of the Mayo Clinic include a Thomas J. Brokaw, quite possibly Tom Brokaw, a Barbara P. Bush, a Richard B. Cheney, possibly Dick Cheney, Senator Thomas A. Daschle, and Paul A. Volker.
[00:28:37.694 --> 00:28:49.983]  The Mayo Clinic provides a full range of health services including organ transplants, bone marrow transplants, blood transfusions, and genetic medicine.
[00:28:50.823 --> 00:28:54.126]  There's a Clinton Foundation Haiti connection.
[00:28:56.487 --> 00:28:59.730]  There's a Klaus Eberwein Haiti connection.
[00:29:00.976 --> 00:29:11.221]  Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official, was found dead July 11th of this year with a gunshot wound to the head.
[00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:20.045]  He was found at 14501 South Dixie Highway, a quality inn.
[00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.566]  This quality inn is 7.5 miles from my office.
[00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:30.408]  There's a Peter Smith Mayo Clinic connection.
[00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:45.226]  Mr. Peter Smith purportedly took his own life May 14th in a hospital in Rochester, Minnesota near the Mayo Clinic called the Aspen Suites.
[00:29:46.587 --> 00:29:50.009]  Yaspin Sweets is across the street from the St.
[00:29:50.069 --> 00:29:56.514]  Mary's campus of Mayo Clinic and is almost exclusively used by patients of the hospital.
[00:29:57.935 --> 00:30:03.479]  He purportedly left a suicide note which stated that there was no foul play whatsoever.
[00:30:04.898 --> 00:30:05.358]  End quote.
[00:30:05.438 --> 00:30:21.285]  Recent bad turn in health since January 2017, end quote, was the reason that he was taking his own life, and the timing was related to, quote, to life insurance of five million expiring, end quote.
[00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:26.006]  He was purportedly searching for Clinton emails.
[00:30:29.128 --> 00:30:30.208]  That's my research, sir.
[00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:31.729]  Wow.
[00:30:31.989 --> 00:30:34.390]  Elizabeth, you have a... Go on.
[00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:42.801]  I'm not aware of any life insurance policy that would pay out if the person committed suicide.
[00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.624]  I believe they used to have a suicide exclusion.
[00:30:46.314 --> 00:30:49.695]  Yeah, that's pretty much commonplace in any insurance policy.
[00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:52.637]  Wow, Elizabeth, I'm not sure how often you do interviews like this.
[00:30:52.677 --> 00:30:53.557]  You did great research.
[00:30:53.577 --> 00:30:55.358]  You were reading from our notes, from your notes.
[00:30:55.378 --> 00:30:56.518]  Thank you so much for breaking that down.
[00:30:56.998 --> 00:31:01.560]  I don't even think, I don't even think you understand the bombshell that you just released here.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.101]  I mean, this is actually huge news.
[00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:10.584]  I contacted Jared because I wanted to get an update on the DNC fraud suit and I wanted to talk about, you know, we talked about
[00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:13.806]  Potential witnesses testifying against the Clintons.
[00:31:14.147 --> 00:31:15.268]  All of a sudden, Peter Smith.
[00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:16.469]  All of a sudden, Klaus.
[00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:17.790]  All of a sudden, these deaths.
[00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.751]  So I wanted to have him on.
[00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:20.953]  And then you were like, well, I've got some new breaking news here.
[00:31:20.993 --> 00:31:21.914]  I've made some connections.
[00:31:22.354 --> 00:31:22.614]  Wow.
[00:31:23.435 --> 00:31:26.257]  I'm just going to try to digest everything that you just said.
[00:31:26.337 --> 00:31:29.340]  It sounds to me... Everything I said to you is a fact.
[00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:32.183]  Everything I said to you is a fact.
[00:31:32.883 --> 00:31:34.965]  You clearly laid it out.
[00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:36.807]  No speculation.
[00:31:37.387 --> 00:31:37.988]  Just facts.
[00:31:39.892 --> 00:31:53.018]  So the interesting thing to me then, and allow me to speculate if you will, this is my speculation, why would, it seems to me the key here that I noticed was the organ transplant.
[00:31:53.819 --> 00:31:55.119]  An organ transplant.
[00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:56.980]  And that just makes me scratch my head.
[00:31:57.561 --> 00:32:00.362]  Why would there be a tie into an organ transplant?
[00:32:00.602 --> 00:32:03.103]  And is this stuff that goes on at the Mayo Clinic's down there?
[00:32:03.123 --> 00:32:08.286]  They have an organ transplant department at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, yes.
[00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.951]  I mean, you can imagine where my mind goes.
[00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:17.875]  You start talking about organ plants, organ donation, organ transplants, black market even, perhaps.
[00:32:17.995 --> 00:32:19.096]  Maybe there was something there.
[00:32:19.136 --> 00:32:23.379]  That's, again, my speculation as to why somebody might be trying to cover something up here.
[00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:24.860]  That's just my speculation.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:30.964]  But you've laid out all of the amazing connections, and then you started laying out Bush connections.
[00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:36.467]  You started laying out other connections down there in Florida that I didn't even think about until today.
[00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.889]  When you started doing this research,
[00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.084]  And turning up this dirt, were you as shocked as I am right now?
[00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.811]  Yes.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.153]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.112]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.708]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.028 --> 00:36:59.211]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:05.967 --> 00:37:07.748]  I'm now joined by David Seaman.
[00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:18.453]  He is the head of Fulcrum, and you probably have seen him on Twitter before, blasting out about PedoGate, blasting out about Podesta, and supporting Bitcoin, something he's really behind.
[00:37:18.773 --> 00:37:23.175]  But I want to talk to him today about why he has decided to get off of Twitter.
[00:37:23.395 --> 00:37:26.477]  If you've been following David, you may have realized, why isn't he on my Twitter anymore?
[00:37:26.517 --> 00:37:29.398]  Well, he's decided to remove himself from Twitter.
[00:37:29.658 --> 00:37:30.799]  I'm now joined by David.
[00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:33.420]  A big decision you made to get off Twitter.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.601]  You had a lot of followers there.
[00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:37.578]  Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:40.001]  This is an interesting conversation to have.
[00:37:40.602 --> 00:37:43.084]  Can't have it on Twitter since I deleted my Twitter account.
[00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:46.989]  So what was happening, and by the way, thanks for the intro.
[00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:50.873]  I'm a fan of both Bitcoin and its competitor, Ethereum.
[00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:55.338]  I kind of take the Steve Wozniak approach, which is like, why do we have to choose a winner?
[00:37:55.738 --> 00:37:58.319]  Why does it have to be Android or iPhone if you like both?
[00:37:58.779 --> 00:38:00.780]  You know, both do certain things that are good.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.561]  But anyway, Twitter, we looked through our YouTube stats.
[00:38:04.641 --> 00:38:05.502]  Fulcrum did this.
[00:38:06.142 --> 00:38:07.182]  We looked through the analytics.
[00:38:07.402 --> 00:38:12.464]  Less than 4% of our traffic is coming from Twitter, and yet I'm literally on there all day.
[00:38:13.065 --> 00:38:14.645]  And I was approaching 70,000 followers.
[00:38:16.966 --> 00:38:32.657]  And as pedogate disclosure widens, as people begin to realize this isn't fake news, it's not a publicity stunt, it's actually in John Podesta's emails, there's something wrong here that needs to be addressed by somebody, as that awareness increases,
[00:38:33.858 --> 00:38:40.782]  Kind of exponentially, a number of friends think that I could become more of a public personality or public figure as a result.
[00:38:41.183 --> 00:38:52.930]  And so I'm thinking if I'm going to go from 70,000 followers on Twitter to maybe 350,000 or even 700,000 in the near future, why give them that network effect and that traffic?
[00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.451]  They're not really giving me anything.
[00:38:54.911 --> 00:39:00.014]  You know, at least on YouTube, we're not 100% happy with YouTube, but you do get a network effect.
[00:39:00.134 --> 00:39:04.056]  The video takes off, a lot of new people see it and get exposed to you.
[00:39:04.577 --> 00:39:12.241]  The only reason why 70,000 people added me on Twitter is that I was always linking to my Twitter page from the description of our YouTube videos.
[00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:13.822]  We're just not going to do that anymore.
[00:39:13.842 --> 00:39:14.223]  F*** Twitter.
[00:39:14.263 --> 00:39:16.684]  I don't know if I can say that on here, but f*** Twitter.
[00:39:16.744 --> 00:39:24.869]  You know, it's CEOed by Jack Dorsey, who is wildly left, more left than most of your liberal friends that you know of.
[00:39:25.249 --> 00:39:31.391]  And why are we giving this one man and this one publicly traded company in San Francisco access to all of our assets?
[00:39:41.155 --> 00:39:48.959]  And one of the reasons you got off Twitter, we discussed this off air, was because of David Brock paid trolls, Hillary Clinton, Democrat super PAC paid trolls.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.360]  We know that they're doing this.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.202]  One of the things they tried to say is, you're just a publicity stunt.
[00:39:53.422 --> 00:39:54.803]  David Seaman is just a publicity stunt.
[00:39:54.823 --> 00:40:02.587]  They tried to twist things you've said in the past, and it was that harassment, it was having to deal with those trolls that also led to you wanting to remove yourself from the platform too, right?
[00:40:03.888 --> 00:40:05.248]  Yeah, that was a big part of it too.
[00:40:05.348 --> 00:40:11.830]  So we're looking at the traffic, and it's less than 4% of the outbound traffic is actually coming from Twitter.
[00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.752]  And yet I'm responding constantly because people are taking my words out of context.
[00:40:17.312 --> 00:40:19.812]  There's a 24-7 reputational attack.
[00:40:20.433 --> 00:40:21.893]  And stalemate, right?
[00:40:21.973 --> 00:40:23.313]  I don't want to play that game anymore.
[00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:24.634]  We know it's being directed.
[00:40:24.674 --> 00:40:28.955]  We know that there's not much organic support for pedophiles in the United States.
[00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:32.136]  Not much organic support for corruption in D.C.
[00:40:32.256 --> 00:40:32.556]  either.
[00:40:32.936 --> 00:40:38.999]  So where is this 24-7 firehose support for John Podesta coming from?
[00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:44.581]  Well, we know it's coming from David Brock, who runs Media Matters and related firms.
[00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:47.542]  We know that one of his funders is George Soros.
[00:40:47.962 --> 00:40:53.724]  And so I'd like to know, why is a billionaire like George Soros directly financing the character attacks
[00:40:54.284 --> 00:41:05.613]  And reputational attacks, not only on me, but others like Mike Cernovich, and Brittany Pettybone, and Jack Posobiec, and probably some of yourselves as well, who have gotten a little too close to the fire.
[00:41:05.973 --> 00:41:07.854]  It doesn't just stop with independent media.
[00:41:07.894 --> 00:41:08.995]  I mean, it reaches the top.
[00:41:09.055 --> 00:41:10.156]  It reaches Donald Trump.
[00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.938]  It's the same thing that President Trump is dealing with.
[00:41:11.998 --> 00:41:13.779]  Obviously, Alex Jones deals with it too.
[00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:20.264]  But it was amazing to me, because I was looking for some of your stuff on Twitter, just to get a little bit more background about what you've been talking about.
[00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:22.465]  You were completely gone, but it's true.
[00:41:22.585 --> 00:41:27.306]  I couldn't believe all the people I saw attacking you on Twitter, on YouTube, making things up about you.
[00:41:27.646 --> 00:41:33.428]  It's incredible, the infighting, and it is a good choice, I think, for you to kind of rise above that and just remove yourself from the platform.
[00:41:33.448 --> 00:41:35.248]  So that gets us to the other debate we're going to have.
[00:41:35.828 --> 00:41:37.049]  Do we stay on Twitter?
[00:41:37.469 --> 00:41:40.230]  Do we allow our creativity to be output on Twitter?
[00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.030]  I do.
[00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:41.910]  I'm on Twitter.
[00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.231]  I also have a Gab account, but I don't really get on Gab.
[00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:45.311]  Nobody's really on Gab.
[00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.651]  I don't get the response from Gab.
[00:41:46.992 --> 00:41:47.992]  But it's an interesting point.
[00:41:48.712 --> 00:41:50.396]  And you've decided to step away.
[00:41:50.697 --> 00:41:52.240]  So make your case right now.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.324]  Why should people step away from Twitter?
[00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:57.471]  Why should we get off of the mainstream platform that is Twitter?
[00:41:58.854 --> 00:42:02.015]  Yeah, the simple answer is you don't own your content there.
[00:42:02.055 --> 00:42:04.636]  You don't own your relationships.
[00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:08.858]  Those 70,000 people, why shouldn't that be portable, like a newsletter list?
[00:42:08.898 --> 00:42:22.583]  You know, I have a newsletter subscription, and if the newsletter service we use to send out those emails, if they start to piss us off, if they start to charge too much, I just say, thank you very much, let's pay up, and we'll go to another newsletter host, and then I still have the list.
[00:42:23.003 --> 00:42:27.405]  Why don't we have a list of our relationships on things like Twitter and Facebook?
[00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:27.885]  Well,
[00:42:28.705 --> 00:42:41.295]  You know, if you talk to the nerds, they think that there will be social networks eventually built on maybe Bitcoin or Ethereum or other blockchains, that the first of these will come around sometime next year.
[00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:43.657]  That's the most hopeful outlook.
[00:42:43.857 --> 00:42:46.239]  And when that happens, people will actually have portability.
[00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:51.723]  But for now, I'm just kind of buying into Jack Dorsey's game and building his empire.
[00:42:52.123 --> 00:42:53.544]  And it seems like a rigged game.
[00:42:53.584 --> 00:42:55.986]  You know, I've seen too many good personalities get nuked.
[00:42:56.386 --> 00:42:58.708]  And again, like, you know, you mentioned Donald Trump.
[00:42:59.029 --> 00:43:08.558]  He'll tweet something out and these nobodies with 2,000 followers and yet a verified blue checkmark, they're like the only ones that pop up in the response thread.
[00:43:08.818 --> 00:43:10.800]  So we know they're gaming the threads.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.762]  It's just the games community.
[00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:13.983]  I don't want to participate in that.
[00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:16.705]  It's the first time in my life where I've had like this real
[00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:19.287]  Audience that comes with me everywhere.
[00:43:19.647 --> 00:43:22.028]  Why participate in Jack Dorsey's sick game?
[00:43:22.368 --> 00:43:38.553]  Like, if I were to come back to Twitter and he would have to be out as CEO and they would have to release some kind of user bill of rights because of how many people they've nuked and censored, not just over Pedogate, but over simply supporting Trump and over simply attacking, you know, actresses who are not popular and stuff.
[00:43:38.613 --> 00:43:39.554]  It's pretty absurd.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:50.042]  Well, it's pretty obvious to me and from anybody who uses Twitter that looks at it from a general perspective to say, okay, they're clearly rigging the algorithms.
[00:43:50.362 --> 00:43:52.203]  They're clearly fixing the results.
[00:43:52.283 --> 00:43:59.044]  You know, if, like you said, you look at a tweet from Trump, the responses that get the most push to the top are usually hate responses.
[00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:06.886]  Some people even believe, and they've proven this in real time, that they're being shadow banned or they'll tweet something out and then their users won't see it.
[00:44:06.926 --> 00:44:09.227]  It just won't reach their timeline in some way, shape, or form.
[00:44:09.887 --> 00:44:12.590]  These are the real ways that they're censoring us.
[00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.294]  It's not necessarily just saying, you're off Twitter, you're not be allowed here.
[00:44:16.334 --> 00:44:20.499]  Well, you are on here, but we're kind of rigging the algorithm so nobody really sees what you're doing.
[00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:21.640]  So that's what you're talking about.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.701]  It's a rigged platform.
[00:44:22.902 --> 00:44:23.702]  It's a rigged game.
[00:44:24.003 --> 00:44:26.265]  You've decided to remove your creativity off of that.
[00:44:26.646 --> 00:44:31.111]  And I'm guessing you haven't really seen any negative results on your YouTube channel?
[00:44:32.062 --> 00:44:45.688]  Well, it's interesting, Owen, that you mentioned the shadow banning that occurs, because to me, part of the utility of the Twitter account was not that I can battle these David Brock trolls who are trying to slow down PedoGate reporting.
[00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:48.369]  That wasn't the primary utility of Twitter.
[00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:58.493]  It was that I could be, you know, stuck in an airport or on a subway platform, and I suddenly get a piece of information that I want to share with the world, I tap out a tweet like any reporter or journalist does,
[00:44:59.153 --> 00:45:03.718]  And especially when it's an unpopular view, you want that to go out to all your followers.
[00:45:04.358 --> 00:45:08.162]  And a number of my followers have told me they simply don't see my tweets at all in their feed.
[00:45:08.442 --> 00:45:12.786]  That's another reason I left, is why deal with something that is, again, that rigged and one-sided.
[00:45:13.007 --> 00:45:18.292]  You know, toward the end of my time on Twitter, I was saying some pretty unpopular things with my base.
[00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:23.477]  I was saying, you know, that I've heard that Cindy McCain has been hired by the Trump administration.
[00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:26.979]  Uh, to head up some of the anti-human trafficking stuff.
[00:45:27.379 --> 00:45:34.242]  And, you know, that's not from Trump's own mouth and it's not from his Twitter feed, but it is coming up on Google News that he's hired Cindy McCain.
[00:45:34.542 --> 00:45:39.225]  And I was saying I think that's inappropriate for somebody who is one of these swamp creature families.
[00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:48.675]  You know, the Clintons and the Bushes and the McCains, they're not going to help us get out of the swamp because they're the primary families that have, you know, swampified things.
[00:45:48.755 --> 00:45:50.157]  They are the swampocracy.
[00:45:50.477 --> 00:45:52.799]  So no McCains, no Clintons, and no Bushes.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.601]  I thought that was kind of part of the
[00:45:55.242 --> 00:45:57.923]  Real quick, 30 seconds, what would you say of Donald Trump's presidency so far?
[00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.211]  So far, mostly excellent.
[00:46:23.332 --> 00:46:30.437]  I think even his detractors have been blown away by the level of competency, you know, winning over Saudi Arabia.
[00:46:30.598 --> 00:46:34.981]  They're no friends of mine, the Saudi kingdom, but they still control a lot of the oil supply.
[00:46:35.282 --> 00:46:46.571]  So I think he's been very strategic and very competent, but he'll lose support if he doesn't take down John Podesta and some of these other creatures close to the Clintons because they're attacking him every single day.
[00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:48.533]  But mostly excellent job so far.
[00:46:49.301 --> 00:46:50.122]  No doubt about that.
[00:46:50.242 --> 00:46:51.943]  David Seaman, head of the Fulcrum Group.
[00:46:52.324 --> 00:46:56.607]  No doubt David Brock Trolls are trying to take down real media reporting real news.
[00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:04.167]  I tried it.
[00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:08.309]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.411]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:59.081]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.101 --> 00:48:59.962]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:00.022]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:15.612 --> 00:49:18.454]  Now we have the GOP pushing foreign workers.
[00:49:18.835 --> 00:49:22.057]  These are the same people who were always the Never Trumpers, the GOP establishment.
[00:49:22.417 --> 00:49:29.062]  And as we pointed out before the election, we said, with a President Trump, his biggest opposition is going to be within the GOP.
[00:49:29.122 --> 00:49:29.983]  And this is what we see.
[00:49:30.023 --> 00:49:34.627]  We see them opposing Trump's Buy American, Hire American agenda.
[00:49:34.947 --> 00:49:40.631]  It was last week that we had people in Maine complaining about how they couldn't find workers.
[00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:45.235]  And we talked about how Senator Tom Tillis from North Carolina, part of the GOP establishment,
[00:49:45.675 --> 00:49:47.175]  Was pushing on behalf of the U.S.
[00:49:47.215 --> 00:49:53.037]  Chamber of Commerce to raise those limits on foreign workers, the H-2B visa program.
[00:49:53.057 --> 00:50:03.860]  Remember, that was a program in Disneyland, Disney World, where they told the American workers, you're going to have to train your replacements from foreign countries or you're not going to get severance pay.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.201]  That's what we're talking about here, folks.
[00:50:06.261 --> 00:50:15.668]  Let's take a look at this story from four days ago, and then we're going to show you what happened today with Speaker Ryan raising the limits on foreign workers coming into America.
[00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:18.530]  This is a story from the Daily Caller four days ago.
[00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:23.214]  Shortage of foreign labor forces main businesses to hire local workers.
[00:50:23.414 --> 00:50:25.476]  Oh, gee, you had to hire Americans, you mean?
[00:50:26.196 --> 00:50:33.500]  Businesses in Bar Harbor, Maine are turning to locals to make up for a shortage of foreign guest workers that normally fill summer jobs in the seaside resort town.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:40.063]  They say because the H-2B visa program has already reached its annual quota, they're having to hire Americans.
[00:50:40.363 --> 00:50:48.166]  Like hundreds of similar coastal resort towns, Bar Harbor has for many years depended on H-2B visas for temporary workers, just like Disney World is doing.
[00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:49.427]  They say all types of businesses
[00:50:49.887 --> 00:50:55.977]  Retail, restaurants, tour boats, all the trips, everything, all types of workers are needed as they're telling the daily news.
[00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:57.600]  Now why is this happening?
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.909]  They say the annual limit on H-2B visas is set at 66,000, but that's not a real firm limit.
[00:51:03.703 --> 00:51:07.065]  Because they can not count toward that number.
[00:51:07.186 --> 00:51:12.069]  Anybody, once they come into the program, they can return for another two years and they're not counted towards that.
[00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:15.532]  So that's 66,000 new people each year.
[00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.494]  And we're talking about millions of workers who have come into the U.S.
[00:51:18.854 --> 00:51:20.195]  cumulatively over this.
[00:51:20.835 --> 00:51:21.556]  So it was 66,000.
[00:51:23.237 --> 00:51:32.123]  And Congress gave Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly the power to raise the limit by as many as 70,000 extra visas this summer.
[00:51:32.243 --> 00:51:34.764]  And this is something that they are going to rush through.
[00:51:34.804 --> 00:51:36.646]  Let's take a look at what happened today.
[00:51:36.706 --> 00:51:40.068]  This is Speaker Paul Ryan squeezing another 15,000.
[00:51:40.968 --> 00:51:45.311]  So first they give Homeland Security Secretary the capability to bring in 70,000.
[00:51:46.031 --> 00:51:48.633]  And then today it's like we're going to bring in 15,000.
[00:51:50.114 --> 00:51:51.934]  And this is Paul Ryan putting this out, saying, U.S.
[00:51:51.974 --> 00:52:06.577]  businesses in danger of suffering irreparable harm due to a lack of available temporary non-agricultural workers will be able to hire an additional 15,000 temporary non-agricultural workers under the H-2B visa program.
[00:52:07.278 --> 00:52:18.940]  And then Secretary Kelly said, Congress gave me the opportunity to provide temporary relief to American businesses in danger of suffering, and they keep using this phrase, suffering irreparable harm due to a lack of available temporary workers.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:24.227]  Say this decision was forced by GOP leaders and Congress, and they're very right.
[00:52:24.328 --> 00:52:29.536]  It's a betrayal of Trump's campaign promise to deliver blue collar jobs to Americans.
[00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:34.263]  That's one opponent of the wage-cutting visa program.
[00:52:34.964 --> 00:52:37.046]  And this is reported by Breitbart.
[00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:51.499]  He says, Kelly's decision to increase the foreign workers threatens to reverse the trend of reports emerging around the country, listen to this, of employers working harder and raising pay to successfully recruit more unemployed Americans for lower skilled jobs.
[00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:53.640]  That's the president of Numbers USA.
[00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:59.578]  Now of course, this is exactly what the GOP legislators want, the never-Trump people.
[00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:00.879]  They don't like his agenda.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.962]  It wasn't just that they didn't like Donald Trump.
[00:53:03.343 --> 00:53:05.365]  They didn't like his America First agenda.
[00:53:05.606 --> 00:53:08.890]  They didn't like his Buy American, Hire American agenda.
[00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:15.855]  All of this personal politics is really because they're trying to shut down his agenda because it opposes their globalism.
[00:53:16.275 --> 00:53:27.061]  They say nationwide companies already employ at least one and a half million wage-cutting foreign outsourcing workers, most of whom work in white-collar jobs that are taken away from American graduates.
[00:53:27.702 --> 00:53:30.423]  And of course they did this on an emergency basis.
[00:53:30.503 --> 00:53:32.345]  So they did this behind closed doors.
[00:53:32.825 --> 00:53:36.327]  They did not even allow a time for the public to provide comments.
[00:53:36.487 --> 00:53:37.608]  Why do you think that is?
[00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:43.150]  Well, because they have to help these struggling businesses like Disneyland, Disney World.
[00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:50.834]  And so Zero Hedge says, with all the growing number of companies complaining about the inability to find workers, why aren't wages growing?
[00:53:51.254 --> 00:53:52.594]  Well, wages are not growing.
[00:53:52.634 --> 00:53:58.097]  And they point out since 2010, the highest year-over-year wage increase in any month is near 2.6%.
[00:53:59.518 --> 00:54:03.499]  But they said for a two-year stretch between the summer of 2011 and the summer of 2013, wage increases were less than 2%.
[00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:09.542]  That I would call the Obamacare effect.
[00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:12.804]  People, companies knew that Obamacare was coming in.
[00:54:13.144 --> 00:54:14.064]  They were not hiring.
[00:54:14.104 --> 00:54:15.005]  That was the summer of 2011.
[00:54:15.965 --> 00:54:21.828]  They knew that that was on the books because whether Obama won or whether Romney won, they were going to have some kind of mandated insurance.
[00:54:22.448 --> 00:54:24.669]  And as they point out in Zero Hedge, it's not just salaries.
[00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:27.290]  Obamacare and other benefits are hurting companies.
[00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.791]  So they have to look at the total compensation package.
[00:54:30.112 --> 00:54:32.773]  And with the mandated coverage of Obamacare,
[00:54:33.809 --> 00:54:38.751]  And the other added on costs that they have put on from the federal government is not just salaries.
[00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:41.472]  Regulations actually cost you pay.
[00:54:41.893 --> 00:54:46.495]  They cost you jobs, especially when we have our government bringing in foreign workers.
[00:54:47.175 --> 00:54:53.458]  Well, let's move from foreign employment to foreign deployment of American workers who could be here in America.
[00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:58.950]  Filling these domestic jobs or creating new companies, but instead we're sending them to other countries.
[00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:01.311]  We're exporting our military workers overseas.
[00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:09.734]  We're exporting war and chaos in the name of regime change in places like Libya, now Syria, and of course we've already seen Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:19.516]  Ron Paul pointed out, because we just had on Friday the NDAA passing, he pointed out big military spending boosts are threatening our economy and our security.
[00:55:19.576 --> 00:55:20.837]  I want to put this in perspective.
[00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:26.453]  We had a $50 billion increase suggested by President Trump.
[00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:29.714]  The Congress said, no, we're going to do even more than that.
[00:55:29.795 --> 00:55:31.976]  We're going to give you another $30 billion.
[00:55:32.256 --> 00:55:34.657]  And of course, the Senate raised that even higher.
[00:55:35.017 --> 00:55:36.478]  They've got to still reconcile this.
[00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:44.263]  But when we look at these amounts, just adding Trump's $50 billion, plus the $30 billion that the House put on,
[00:55:45.183 --> 00:55:46.523]  That takes us to $80 billion.
[00:55:47.664 --> 00:55:52.725]  Now Russia's entire budget, we're supposed to be afraid of the Russians, their entire budget is $65 billion.
[00:55:52.985 --> 00:55:56.066]  We're going to increase our military budget by $80 billion.
[00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:57.187]  Okay?
[00:55:58.007 --> 00:55:59.067]  Does that tell you something?
[00:55:59.527 --> 00:56:06.630]  That we have right now, our budget is $597 billion versus their $65 billion budget.
[00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:09.350]  We are 9.2 times the Russian budget.
[00:56:09.531 --> 00:56:13.912]  As a matter of fact, if you add up all the military spending of Russia and China, everybody
[00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:17.032]  We are more than half of the world's military spending.
[00:56:17.072 --> 00:56:17.732]  But it's not enough.
[00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.714]  The House must do more.
[00:56:20.395 --> 00:56:25.419]  So they have actually gone over the sequestration limit of $72 billion.
[00:56:25.759 --> 00:56:27.000]  They've actually overspent that.
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.363]  But of course, the Democrats are not pushing back on this to try to shut this down.
[00:56:31.403 --> 00:56:38.049]  Instead, they're saying, well, you're spending so much on military spending, we should at least match that with domestic entitlement spending.
[00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:41.091]  This is looking like what we saw with Ronald Reagan.
[00:56:41.752 --> 00:56:47.017]  And as Ron Paul points out, he said, We're sending troops back to Afghanistan, the longest running war in U.S.
[00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:48.658]  history after nearly 16 years.
[00:56:48.698 --> 00:56:52.141]  The Taliban controls more territory than at any time since the initial U.S.
[00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:56.105]  invasion, and ISIS is seeping into the cracks created by U.S.
[00:56:56.125 --> 00:56:57.406]  military action in that country.
[00:56:57.786 --> 00:57:03.792]  The Pentagon and Defense Secretary James Mattis are already telling us that even when ISIS is finally defeated in Iraq,
[00:57:04.332 --> 00:57:04.652]  The U.S.
[00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:07.513]  military doesn't dare end its occupation of the country.
[00:57:07.913 --> 00:57:10.753]  Look for a very expensive array of permanent U.S.
[00:57:10.853 --> 00:57:12.954]  military bases throughout the country.
[00:57:13.734 --> 00:57:15.354]  That's precisely what is going to happen.
[00:57:15.834 --> 00:57:17.655]  And military bases are expensive.
[00:57:17.695 --> 00:57:20.835]  We can't even get rid of military bases here in the United States.
[00:57:20.955 --> 00:57:29.537]  We have the House, as part of this NDAA, blocking any attempts to close unused military bases, in defiance of Trump's White House wishes.
[00:57:30.017 --> 00:57:36.083]  The House turned down an amendment Thursday that would have made it possible to close unused military bases, reports the Daily Caller.
[00:57:36.463 --> 00:57:39.246]  It's called the Base Realignment and Closure Amendment, BRAC.
[00:57:39.586 --> 00:57:41.868]  It was introduced by Representative Tom McClintock.
[00:57:42.008 --> 00:57:43.790]  He's a GOP congressman.
[00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:49.215]  It would have removed language from the NDAA that prohibits shutting down unused military bases.
[00:57:49.235 --> 00:57:49.976]  That's all it would have done.
[00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:55.188]  It would have, right now in the NDAA, there's language that says you cannot shut down any base.
[00:57:55.808 --> 00:57:59.193]  And so what it would have done is just remove that, so people could take a look at it.
[00:57:59.653 --> 00:58:00.635]  That was struck down 175 to 248.
[00:58:00.735 --> 00:58:03.558]  So 248 people, it was a bipartisan effort, said we don't want to shut down any military bases.
[00:58:09.738 --> 00:58:10.919]  This is the insanity.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.123]  This is something that is going to destroy this country.
[00:58:14.163 --> 00:58:27.257]  We've had multiple defense secretaries, from Leon Panetta to current Secretary Mattis, tell us, as have other generals, that the military overspending is our greatest security threat.
[00:58:28.075 --> 00:58:33.240]  Our greatest advantage has always been our vibrant economy, our ability to arm ourselves.
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:45.051]  If we make ourselves indebted slaves to the Federal Reserve because we continue to build up this military spending, we are actually making ourselves less safe as we destroy our economy.
[00:58:45.714 --> 00:58:50.320]  And yet we have space cadets and sex changes all part of the defense budget.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.546]  Even though Trump and the White House don't want new space cadets, they get them.
[00:58:54.907 --> 00:58:56.188]  So this is what we're seeing.
[00:58:56.429 --> 00:58:58.531]  The insanity of the military budget.
[00:58:58.571 --> 00:58:59.613]  That's it for tonight's news.
