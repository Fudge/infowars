[00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.156]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's incredible!
[00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:19.365]  Here we are, another global transmission, and Hollywood's collapsing, the NFL's collapsing, the official cover-up of Vegas has basically collapsed.
[00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:20.366]  It's amazing!
[00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:23.890]  But they're going to fight back, and it's all coming up today.
[00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.432]  This transmission will be one for the record books.
[00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:32.178]  Let's kick it off with John Bowne exposing the satanic cesspool that is Southern California.
[00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.804]  Governor Jerry Brown is now pitching from left field.
[00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:53.215]  Fox News reports, California health care workers who willfully and repeatedly decline to use a senior transgender patient's preferred name or pronouns could face punishments ranging from a fine to jail time under a newly signed law.
[00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.176]  But that's just the appetizer.
[00:00:57.898 --> 00:01:04.042]  So far, the Hep A virus has killed 17 and infected nearly 500 in the county.
[00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:10.186]  Nearly two-thirds are homeless or drug users, but the rest are from the general population.
[00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:16.831]  The advice remains, if you have yet to get your vaccination for Hep A, you need to get it.
[00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:27.656]  is highly contagious and it is transmitted person to person by the fecal-oral route.
[00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:42.180]  The fact that while this is a broad concern, there is a targeted subgroup, a very focused subgroup in our community that is at high risk for which we have the greatest concern.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.061]  Include the homeless,
[00:01:45.348 --> 00:02:03.329]  IV and illicit drug users, men who have sex with men, individuals having sexual contact with someone who has the hepatitis A infection, people with chronic liver disease, and individuals who have clotting factor disorders.
[00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:21.519]  Now, the signing of carefree dangerous blood donation legislation during a massive hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego that could actually spur a larger statewide epidemic breaks all the standards of common sense, safety, and human rights.
[00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.402]  The people that treat blood and plasma as a global commodity as brokers
[00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:31.206]  Broker it as if it's gold or silver.
[00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:33.466]  These people need to be reined in.
[00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:42.969]  Some of my competitors resent this, but I used to define the United States as the OPEC of blood, because we supplied most of the rest of the world.
[00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.489]  Now they're going to use California as a vector for the attack.
[00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.670]  It's a bio-attack.
[00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.010]  They know what they're doing.
[00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.790]  Trey Brown's a Satanist.
[00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.795]  In a few years, we're still here, as a planet.
[00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:09.726]  Don't have nuclear war.
[00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:19.371]  I will go back to this show and say, here I am in 2017 saying, within three to five years, California will have a 200% increase in HIV.
[00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:25.814]  They will also complain and say we need single-payer, we need socialist health care, the reason we have HIV is because we don't have free health care.
[00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:34.978]  No, the reason we have HIV is because it is a culture now in the gay community, that I first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone, to give other people HIV.
[00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:37.936]  It's truly nihilistic.
[00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:38.880]  So here's the article.
[00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:40.386]  Progress!
[00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:40.888]  L.A.
[00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:41.189]  Times.
[00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:50.037]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV, no longer a felony in California, it's the same thing as a parking ticket.
[00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.158]  So it's essentially legalized.
[00:03:52.618 --> 00:04:01.201]  And here's the LA Times, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:02.481]  How about hepatitis?
[00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:03.241]  How about everything else?
[00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:07.803]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling blood bank they're HIV positive.
[00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:08.603]  Oh wow!
[00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:11.864]  Don't tell the blood bank you're HIV positive
[00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:13.565]  This is a religion.
[00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.925]  This is Satanism, folks.
[00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:16.966]  Because if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.187]  This is totally insane.
[00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:23.889]  Remember the Clintons for over a decade knew that all the blood coming out of their prisons was infected with HIV and hepatitis?
[00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:34.433]  Factoid is about how the state of Arkansas harvested bad blood from its inmate population and infected thousands of patients around the world with hepatitis C and HIV AIDS.
[00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.755]  Meanwhile, California is on fire.
[00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:43.240]  Massive earthquakes in Mexico signal a big one hitting California any day now.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:58.214]  Then there's the unreliable water supply, a mountain of debt, a stagnant economy are just a few of the issues facing this land of confusion that recently wanted to allow communists to hold state jobs.
[00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:01.577]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.558]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:08.139]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:25.907]  The reality is

[00:06:08.393 --> 00:06:13.697]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:21.763]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:26.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.731]  It's Thursday, October 12th, 2017.
[00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:36.811]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:44.975]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours and then when InfoWars Live with yours truly Alex Jones ends, Owen Schroer and the War Room's coming up.
[00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:48.216]  We're now syndicating 10 hours of transmission a day.
[00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:51.437]  By the middle of next year we intend to be 20 hours a day.
[00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:54.459]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:55.479]  Where to start?
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.961]  I think today I'll do what I do sometimes when the news is just so overwhelming.
[00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.122]  I think I'll just read you
[00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:05.469]  Headlines.
[00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.031]  And then get into the meat and potatoes on some of the big specifics.
[00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:16.413]  Report, FBI wiped phones and laptops of Las Vegas massacre eyewitnesses.
[00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:21.014]  Wonder why they did that, because of all the multiple shooter videos?
[00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:23.515]  Oh, now confirmed?
[00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:29.317]  Worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter opened fire on crowd.
[00:07:30.307 --> 00:07:35.491]  And folks were down in the crowd warning people, and mainstream media made fun of us and acted like that was fake.
[00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:37.352]  They knew it wasn't fake.
[00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:39.153]  They know they're the liars.
[00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:41.535]  We try to tell the truth.
[00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:44.997]  Doesn't mean we're right all the time, but we try to tell the truth.
[00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:45.858]  Big difference.
[00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:52.863]  Vegas hotel worker warned police of shooter before massacre happened, but nothing was done.
[00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:56.664]  45 minutes before.
[00:07:57.124 --> 00:07:58.245]  Not 6 minutes.
[00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:00.627]  See, notice it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger now.
[00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.908]  The entire story's not true.
[00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:05.670]  We were the first to tell you.
[00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:07.548]  All of it.
[00:08:07.568 --> 00:08:08.429]  He went to the Middle East.
[00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.931]  His girlfriend did.
[00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:11.372]  He had millions of dollars.
[00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:12.694]  He got shot.
[00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:13.955]  He didn't commit suicide.
[00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:15.777]  There were multiple shooters.
[00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.401]  On and on and on and on.
[00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.023]  It's all coming out.
[00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:24.085]  Oh, look, CBS News.
[00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:27.189]  Worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter opened fire on crowd.
[00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:28.810]  Associated Press as well.
[00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.391]  Here's Infowars from a day before.
[00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.452]  Mandalay Bay owner.
[00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:35.492]  What's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:39.033]  That's a nice way of telling you that the Sheriff's Department's been told a lie.
[00:08:39.813 --> 00:08:43.574]  Since the FBI took over, they stopped saying we think he was radicalized and had to have help.
[00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:47.035]  They now have been saying the opposite now that the FBI's in charge.
[00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:49.976]  Oh, and Newsweek's walked it back.
[00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:53.297]  They're saying, yeah, maybe ISIS is involved.
[00:08:53.317 --> 00:08:54.177]  We've got that report.
[00:08:55.017 --> 00:08:55.837]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:55.877 --> 00:08:57.918]  That's just, that's just one of the stacks.
[00:08:57.938 --> 00:08:58.778]  That's only part of it.
[00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:00.722]  But it's a big deal.
[00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:03.464]  And boy, they're just hoping everybody forgets about it right now.
[00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:12.490]  Oh, we're not hearing from Keith Olbermann and Hillary, and everybody's saying gun owners are to blame, and conservatives are to blame, and Christians are to blame, and white people are to blame.
[00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.533]  And aren't you all guilty, and aren't you all bad?
[00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:17.714]  Let's ban those bump stocks right now.
[00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:22.218]  Because they've already banned belt-fed machine guns back in the 30s.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.382]  And that's what was getting used, not bump stocks.
[00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:35.027]  So they're all kinda wanting you to forget about it now, because we blew their official story wide open.
[00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:40.371]  And we created a united front to make it okay for the real witnesses to come forward.
[00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:47.036]  And now CNN and CBS are having the victims on, and the people that saw the multiple shooters, and they're changing the subject.
[00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:52.180]  Wow, they've changed the timeline, showing their response time wasn't good, and we started 45 minutes before.
[00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:57.291]  Just changing the subject not to, wow, why'd they lie about it all?
[00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.312]  What really happened?
[00:09:58.332 --> 00:10:01.293]  It just becomes, they covered up for response time.
[00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:05.396]  No, they had shooters all over the city and took a bunch of them out.
[00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:10.559]  That were probably diversions for the main attack that came, an ISIS attack.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.622]  And we've got coming up as well the most ridiculous Eminem video.
[00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:28.225]  I saw this two days ago and it was so contrived, so cringeworthy, so fake, so middle schoolers trying to act like hip-hop people.
[00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:32.287]  So fake by a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:10:32.947 --> 00:10:35.348]  But he's authentic because he's got a couple black guys standing behind him.
[00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:37.682]  And some old cars.
[00:10:39.683 --> 00:10:42.105]  The guy flies around in helicopters in his brand new Ferraris.
[00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:46.848]  It's such bad hip-hop that I did never attack it.
[00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:51.992]  But Millie Weaver did and it's got millions of views on Facebook and YouTube since last night.
[00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:56.035]  Our reporter, her and her teammate Gavin Wentz did a great job.
[00:10:56.075 --> 00:10:56.875]  That's coming up.
[00:10:56.976 --> 00:11:00.058]  Eminem is a complete idiot is the name of the video.
[00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:05.594]  And Paul Joseph Watson has another big report.
[00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:06.895]  Eminem is a complete idiot.
[00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:08.515]  So both those are coming up.
[00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:13.118]  Because it gets even more hilarious with the unintentional comedy.
[00:11:14.538 --> 00:11:20.721]  With Keith Oberman, the failed TV host, coming out and saying, this is the best political statement ever.
[00:11:21.062 --> 00:11:23.063]  This is the best music ever produced.
[00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:25.844]  This is so incredibly wonderful.
[00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:37.939]  It is just the greatest unintentional comedy that you will ever see in your life.
[00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:40.342]  I mean, Eminem is so pathetic.
[00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:47.972]  And he is emblematic of the entire fake Hollywood, rock star, hip-hop,
[00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:49.977]  We're good to go.
[00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:18.476]  We have the NFL stars coming out and saying, we're going to still go to a knee, and we're going to rebel, and we're going to stand up, because we don't like America.
[00:12:18.817 --> 00:12:19.297]  And you know what?
[00:12:19.337 --> 00:12:24.799]  That's great, because that will extinct your pathetic, disgusting league even faster.
[00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:30.222]  It's now become an anti-American weapon by the globalists to destroy this country.
[00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:33.924]  So just squeeze even tighter, trying to force us
[00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:40.926]  And we're going to be exposing all of that in a big, big, big way.
[00:12:41.746 --> 00:12:55.709]  Also, ring of fire volcanoes remind Asia of seismic peril, as even the USGS says that the supervolcano of Yellowstone may go off sooner rather than later, sooner than they thought.
[00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.670]  Then the big news is coming up.
[00:12:58.871 --> 00:12:59.854]  World War 3.
[00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:04.385]  Korea claims Trump has lit the wick of war.
[00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:07.213]  Threatens hail of fire.
[00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:21.753]  Trump responds by coming out and pointing out on Hannity that his fire and fury comment and of course obviously his calm before the storm comment does reflect North Korea as U.S.
[00:13:21.793 --> 00:13:25.795]  bombers fly over Korean Peninsula in latest show of force and as a U.S.
[00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:30.937]  helicopter apparently may have been shot down on the DMZ just yesterday.
[00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:32.278]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:39.719]  Meanwhile, conservative leaders urge Mitch McConnell to resign because he's a neocon flathrag.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.804]  And we have a new study finds Democrats moving left driving growing partisan gap.
[00:13:45.844 --> 00:13:48.326]  Yes, they're getting more radical, more pathetic.
[00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:52.349]  No, they're just less disciplined, telling us what America haters they always were.
[00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:54.811]  And then, yesterday,
[00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:07.894]  Anderson Cooper told one of the biggest whoppers of a career filled with mega whoppers and faking locations with blue screens and green screens with chroma keys.
[00:14:08.754 --> 00:14:11.955]  He said, I am a liar and congressman is a liar.
[00:14:13.676 --> 00:14:18.637]  And Vice Magazine has this bizarre reporter that looks like she's been given a lobotomy.
[00:14:18.697 --> 00:14:19.678]  I mean, I'm not being mean.
[00:14:19.718 --> 00:14:22.059]  It's just, it's next level.
[00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:25.920]  The weird freak show stuff the left's into.
[00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.961]  Those went way beyond, you know, midgets and all the rest of it.
[00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:39.911]  But, now they're claiming, ladies and gentlemen, that we made up that Soros was ever connected to the Nazis.
[00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:52.163]  Now, they also say we made up that Hitler was associated with them, or Herman Goering, or Heinrich Himmler, or Zeb Dietrich, or Ernst Röhm, or Arnold Schwarzenegger's daddy.
[00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:55.605]  But this is next level.
[00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:59.508]  CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros ties.
[00:14:59.808 --> 00:15:02.369]  So there's a 12-13 minute interview.
[00:15:02.409 --> 00:15:03.510]  It's like 12 and a half minute long.
[00:15:04.651 --> 00:15:06.192]  Full 60 minutes interview.
[00:15:07.112 --> 00:15:09.474]  And Soros has fought tooth and nail to have it removed.
[00:15:09.514 --> 00:15:10.795]  They always claim copyright.
[00:15:10.995 --> 00:15:11.776]  No, it's fair use.
[00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:13.397]  You guys are saying it doesn't exist.
[00:15:13.857 --> 00:15:16.078]  Every time we try to put it up, they try to take it down.
[00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:16.999]  I'm Aaron.
[00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:18.240]  The whole thing.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.101]  And I'm gonna, Eric, serve seven, I'm gonna shove it down your dirty throats.
[00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:43.404]  You got a Nazi collaborator running around in front of everybody, doing whatever he wants, trying to destroy the country, trying to start a race war, and then he wants to have his spokespeople say, I'm a liar on CNN, when we've got him smiling and saying he's proud of working for the Nazis, and that if he didn't do it, quote, somebody else would have.
[00:15:43.784 --> 00:15:45.605]  You guys got a lot of nerve.
[00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:47.725]  You got a lot of nerve.
[00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:52.150]  So you just get ready to have that crammed down your dirty Nazi throat.
[00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:54.874]  By the way, that makes CNN-Nazi collaborators.
[00:15:55.294 --> 00:16:01.001]  They're protecting one of the oldest living Nazis that helped send thousands to their deaths after robbing them.
[00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:04.867]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:16:06.112 --> 00:16:11.455]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:16:11.695 --> 00:16:12.836]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:15.378]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:22.562]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:16:22.762 --> 00:16:26.104]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:28.226]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:37.290]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.271]  They know how great it is.
[00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:42.993]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.295]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:53.959]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:56.961]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:17:03.403 --> 00:17:05.823]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:10.004]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:13.565]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:17:15.746 --> 00:17:16.867]  It's a good deal at $39.

[00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:35.098]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen
[00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.737]  And more concentrate.
[00:18:37.757 --> 00:18:39.538]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:41.160]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.082]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:18:43.482 --> 00:18:44.363]  It's incredible.
[00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:46.745]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:48.887]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[00:18:48.968 --> 00:18:49.448]  Incredible.
[00:18:49.768 --> 00:18:50.649]  It is amazing.
[00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:52.291]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:53.832]  50% off Caveman.
[00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:55.394]  But only a few days left.
[00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:56.395]  It's about to end.
[00:18:56.975 --> 00:18:59.297]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:04.922]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:19:05.342 --> 00:19:06.743]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:19:06.984 --> 00:19:08.145]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:09.346]  I want to thank you.
[00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:10.707]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:10.727 --> 00:19:21.136]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:19:27.358 --> 00:19:37.282]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:42.885]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:19:56.653 --> 00:20:01.476]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:08.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.074]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:18.994]  A lie!
[00:20:19.435 --> 00:20:21.136]  No man is obsolete!
[00:20:21.436 --> 00:20:23.277]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:20:23.317 --> 00:20:26.199]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.644]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:20:32.004 --> 00:20:34.766]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect!
[00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:39.250]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.951]  I am a human being!
[00:20:41.352 --> 00:20:48.558]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:49.820]  I don't care!
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.281]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:53.383]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[00:20:53.483 --> 00:20:57.627]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[00:20:58.346 --> 00:21:00.167]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave?
[00:21:00.547 --> 00:21:03.268]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:11.130]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.792]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[00:21:18.452 --> 00:21:21.993]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:24.274]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:30.782 --> 00:21:35.068]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:36.750]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:39.033]  This is the broadcast the enemy hates.
[00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:42.617]  Hollywood, the globalists, the pedophiles, the elites.
[00:21:43.398 --> 00:21:44.980]  They all call for our defeat.
[00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:47.183]  They all call for our censorship.
[00:21:48.154 --> 00:21:56.461]  They all come against us with their lawsuits and their lies and their fraud and their operatives and their stalkers and their disinformation.
[00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:59.763]  But the worse it gets, the better it gets.
[00:22:00.584 --> 00:22:02.546]  It's the great animating contest of liberty.
[00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:05.368]  And we're all right in the middle of it.
[00:22:05.968 --> 00:22:07.009]  I'm honored to be here with you.
[00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.691]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:13.915]  I have two stacks of news that intersect together that I'm going to hit right now.
[00:22:15.285 --> 00:22:17.730]  Harvey Weinstein, the big news.
[00:22:18.532 --> 00:22:22.641]  Trump has dispatched the Justice Department to investigate him fleeing the country.
[00:22:23.464 --> 00:22:28.186]  He has fled the country for a sex addiction facility.
[00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.827]  I'm told they've got some nice brothels in Europe.
[00:22:30.847 --> 00:22:31.767]  They're actually called those.
[00:22:32.167 --> 00:22:33.048]  It's a sick joke.
[00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:36.949]  But they find out how to properly satisfy you.
[00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:38.610]  That's your real problem.
[00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.051]  We're going to get to the bottom of what you need.
[00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:46.593]  And so he's now fled to Europe, just like Roman Polanski did, who he was buddies with.
[00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:51.795]  And of course, Meryl Streep, who he thinks is God because she's such a nobody, talentless twit.
[00:22:53.218 --> 00:23:04.484]  Yes, she has said he's God, and she says that Roman Polanski should be let out of prison in Europe after getting away with what he did for decades, and that Harvey Weinstein's a great guy.
[00:23:04.504 --> 00:23:13.449]  Well, she's been forced to now say he's a bad guy, because Hollywood doesn't have the spell over America and over the world anymore.
[00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:21.313]  And so we've got all that happening, and we've got women that he's not denying that he sexually abused, raped, you name it.
[00:23:23.462 --> 00:23:25.606]  Coming out on Twitter.
[00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:27.509]  They're being blocked by Twitter.
[00:23:27.629 --> 00:23:28.851]  Famous movie stars.
[00:23:29.772 --> 00:23:32.316]  See, Twitter works for the big corporate chiefs.
[00:23:33.158 --> 00:23:37.805]  And they want to make sure that if one of these rape victims or somebody else tries to speak out, they can't.
[00:23:38.749 --> 00:23:42.190]  They want to virtue signal all day about, oh, we love women, oh, we love children.
[00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:44.791]  Let us be the guardians of culture.
[00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:47.232]  We'll protect your women and children.
[00:23:48.353 --> 00:23:50.074]  Oh, yes, we'll do well.
[00:23:50.974 --> 00:24:00.698]  Meanwhile, during Weinstein's years, Disney hired child molester who'd been convicted of brutally raping a 12-year-old boy and was known to be a savage pedophile.
[00:24:01.198 --> 00:24:04.081]  They hired him to direct movies with children in them.
[00:24:05.522 --> 00:24:07.084]  Kit Daniels wrote a story about that.
[00:24:07.564 --> 00:24:09.246]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:24:10.787 --> 00:24:16.352]  Ben Affleck asked TV host Exposure Breast, mocks disabled, in resurfaced video.
[00:24:16.613 --> 00:24:18.474]  He did it on live television.
[00:24:20.736 --> 00:24:22.738]  Isn't that just sweet and liberal?
[00:24:23.806 --> 00:24:24.927]  And it goes on and on.
[00:24:24.987 --> 00:24:37.298]  Now it's hurting the Batman star and hurting the image that Batman might just be a child prodigy pervert.
[00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:39.420]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:47.428]  But continuing, ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to shut this down as fast as they can.
[00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:56.857]  And here's some examples of what the huge Hollywood pervert combine is up to.
[00:24:58.258 --> 00:25:07.868]  New York Times and YouTube collude spawned fake news bastard child in the latest Project Veritas video part two of Pravda America.
[00:25:08.529 --> 00:25:12.633]  By the way, James O'Keefe joins us next hour live via video Skype.
[00:25:15.134 --> 00:25:20.758]  He has them admitting that, oh, don't worry, we force our videos to number one, even if they're not popular.
[00:25:20.818 --> 00:25:26.021]  YouTube suppresses conservatives and force feeds us to the public.
[00:25:26.521 --> 00:25:30.004]  Well, we already do that, but it's just good to understand.
[00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:32.825]  How the forced feeding works.
[00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:40.529]  Yeah, we can have a video that has a million views as of this morning on one Facebook, and that won't trend on Facebook.
[00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.150]  Able and Stuff with 100,000 do.
[00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.873]  And then we'll have videos with another million or so yesterday.
[00:25:47.153 --> 00:25:48.094]  And that's not on trending.
[00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:49.155]  And they've got videos with...
[00:25:49.955 --> 00:25:50.896]  200,000 trending.
[00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:52.577]  Because it's establishment.
[00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:53.958]  It's force-fed.
[00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:55.779]  They tell you it's winning the race.
[00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:59.301]  They tell you it's popular because you trust the wisdom of the crowd.
[00:25:59.561 --> 00:26:02.583]  You trust the five stars when it's half a star.
[00:26:03.904 --> 00:26:05.045]  This is how they operate.
[00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:06.225]  This is how they do it.
[00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:07.926]  So that's coming up.
[00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.688]  We'll discuss that next hour with James O'Keefe.
[00:26:09.728 --> 00:26:11.068]  New York Times and YouTube collude.
[00:26:11.148 --> 00:26:13.110]  Sparks fake news bastard child.
[00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.332]  MSN and Silicon Valley teaming up to push globalist lies.
[00:26:17.585 --> 00:26:18.626]  Of course you heard it here first.
[00:26:19.146 --> 00:26:24.550]  Mozilla gave 100,000 a secure email platform for Antifa to launch their criminal operations.
[00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.392]  That's all the examples of big corporate money daily going to them.
[00:26:28.133 --> 00:26:35.618]  Again, Twitter suspends Rose McGowan's account for criticizing Weinstein and saying that he sexually assaulted her.
[00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:47.027]  Because, listen, Twitter is here to protect rich billionaire sex assaulters, but Virtue signaled that men wearing pants, or dad being dad, or just having dads, exist as that.
[00:26:48.814 --> 00:26:49.835]  So we've got that censorship.
[00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:51.116]  Trump doubles down.
[00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:55.138]  Network licenses must be challenged like network licenses like CNN.
[00:26:55.439 --> 00:26:57.220]  They call that dictator behavior.
[00:26:58.353 --> 00:27:04.435]  But meanwhile, they're the ones trying to shut us down, saying there should be a national censor or a ministry of truth that controls us.
[00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:08.576]  MSNBC is calling for this show to be shut down completely.
[00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:16.979]  But when Trump says people calling for that that are un-American, who want to destroy the country and destroy the markets and lie continually, we should look at their licenses.
[00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:18.139]  They're like, oh my gosh!
[00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:20.440]  See, because they're total hypocrite scum.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.202]  Former ESPN reporter says she was told not to like conservative leading tweets or she'd be fired.
[00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:26.082]  Fox Business?
[00:27:27.282 --> 00:27:29.243]  NFL player says there's going to be an uproar.
[00:27:29.543 --> 00:27:30.843]  Players are forced to stand.
[00:27:30.863 --> 00:27:35.105]  Yeah, they're down just now 17 points the last month.
[00:27:35.765 --> 00:27:38.586]  Total, it's 35 plus points this year.
[00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:43.008]  And if you add it all together, they're down 55 points in the last four years.
[00:27:43.568 --> 00:27:47.029]  So it's just, oh, now they've got high school cheerleaders taking a knee on the anthem.
[00:27:47.089 --> 00:27:47.569]  Good.
[00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:48.229]  Good.
[00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.110]  Get rid of that, too.
[00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.171]  It's all unhealthy garbage.
[00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:53.612]  It all becomes, you know, the new royalty.
[00:27:53.912 --> 00:27:55.013]  It diverts everybody.
[00:27:55.313 --> 00:27:57.935]  It turns into, you know, the new national religion.
[00:27:58.295 --> 00:28:02.277]  Then they can piggyback on these things we worship, all their globalist propaganda.
[00:28:03.697 --> 00:28:04.698]  We're in a total war, folks.
[00:28:04.718 --> 00:28:06.179]  They're trying to censor us and shut us down.

[00:28:43.394 --> 00:28:45.635]  They got a tiger by the tail, I'm here to tell you.
[00:28:46.135 --> 00:28:52.637]  We've got a new super combo running and 50% off on Brain Force and a lot more at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:10.669]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:12.050]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.612]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:29:15.272 --> 00:29:21.777]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:29:21.997 --> 00:29:24.138]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:27.461]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:36.509]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:37.490]  They know how great it is.
[00:29:38.411 --> 00:29:42.194]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:44.456]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:29:45.297 --> 00:29:53.163]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:29:53.603 --> 00:30:02.089]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:05.071]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:09.254]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:30:09.654 --> 00:30:12.637]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:15.838]  It's a good deal at $39.

[00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.831]  And more.
[00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:36.952]  Concentrate.
[00:31:36.972 --> 00:31:38.774]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:31:39.014 --> 00:31:40.456]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:31:40.676 --> 00:31:42.298]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:31:42.698 --> 00:31:43.579]  It's incredible.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.982]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:31:46.162 --> 00:31:47.303]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:31:47.764 --> 00:31:48.665]  At 15, incredible.
[00:31:48.985 --> 00:31:49.886]  It is amazing.
[00:31:50.247 --> 00:31:51.508]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:51.949 --> 00:31:53.070]  50% off Caveman.
[00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.612]  But only a few days left.
[00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:55.613]  It's about to end.
[00:31:56.193 --> 00:31:58.534]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:31:58.974 --> 00:32:04.135]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:05.955]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:07.356]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:08.536]  I want to thank you.
[00:32:08.876 --> 00:32:09.936]  We're all in this together.
[00:32:10.456 --> 00:32:20.359]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.580]  But these specials have got to end.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:36.503]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:32:36.763 --> 00:32:42.104]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[00:32:42.584 --> 00:32:47.225]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:55.531]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:55.872 --> 00:33:00.695]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.835 --> 00:33:17.543]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours.
[00:33:17.824 --> 00:33:18.686]  Yes.
[00:33:19.207 --> 00:33:22.534]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:33:22.594 --> 00:33:23.175]  That's right.
[00:33:24.918 --> 00:33:25.619]  Was it difficult?
[00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:29.221]  Not at all.
[00:33:29.702 --> 00:33:30.322]  Not at all.
[00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:34.886]  Maybe as a child, you don't see the connection.
[00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:37.748]  It created no problem at all.
[00:33:37.808 --> 00:33:38.669]  No feeling of guilt?
[00:33:39.109 --> 00:33:39.249]  No.
[00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:50.398]  Well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[00:33:50.718 --> 00:33:53.901]  Whether I was there or not, the property was being taken away.
[00:33:55.365 --> 00:33:56.666]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[00:33:57.526 --> 00:34:01.689]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:03.870]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:11.355]  Rarely do we compare somebody to Hitler.
[00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:13.916]  Rarely do we compare somebody to the devil.
[00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:17.679]  But in the case of George Soros,
[00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:26.071]  A listener sent us a sculpture in the mail two weeks ago, very nice sculpture, of George Soros as the devil.
[00:34:26.591 --> 00:34:27.651]  So I've got it in my office.
[00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:30.392]  I think I'm gonna move it out of there though, it's a little bit creepy.
[00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:45.235]  Because he went on a 13-minute segment in 1998 of 60 Minutes and said that he was proud of being a Nazi collaborator, essentially.
[00:34:47.938 --> 00:34:53.059]  Now, starting about six, seven years ago, they would always ban the interview on YouTube.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:02.321]  We had copyright strikes, but I challenged YouTube, filed the paperwork and said, I will sue in court over this.
[00:35:03.221 --> 00:35:07.202]  So they withdrew the strike on our account, but would not let us upload it.
[00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:13.843]  They've got computer bots that can recognize it by keyword, but also just by the video and not let us do it.
[00:35:14.864 --> 00:35:22.009]  Now we've learned how to get around them by slowing the audio down, speeding it up, putting other video over it, and scrambling it.
[00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.651]  That's the only way you're able to actually get the video.
[00:35:25.732 --> 00:35:27.534]  And it's subtle when you're watching it.
[00:35:27.634 --> 00:35:32.637]  But we haven't edited it for content, we've just edited it so that we can get around the bots.
[00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:34.939]  That's what we do here.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.603]  Remember back when we had the Google bomb for a year and a half and we could have the keyword every day?
[00:35:39.623 --> 00:35:42.405]  They changed the whole algorithm to block that.
[00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:56.157]  We weren't gaming the system, we had enough listeners to go search a term, and back then they weren't gaming it as much, so you could actually have the top term if, you know, a million of our listeners would go and put in a keyword, we could do it any time we wanted to.
[00:35:58.359 --> 00:35:59.340]  Boy, that got their attention.
[00:36:00.722 --> 00:36:06.147]  But what's amazing is that CNN would have the nerve
[00:36:07.435 --> 00:36:11.117]  To come out yesterday and say that I am a liar.
[00:36:11.417 --> 00:36:12.857]  Rob Doud just brought in the sculpture, please.
[00:36:12.877 --> 00:36:13.177]  Thank you.
[00:36:14.018 --> 00:36:15.738]  Didn't ask for it, but it's perfect timing.
[00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:18.440]  Thank the listener that sent this to us.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.701]  It's Ellie Hasselman, Eli Hasselman.
[00:36:23.662 --> 00:36:32.405]  Now, that said, imagine CNN when it's known for 19 years
[00:36:34.144 --> 00:36:43.296]  That George Soros, from 14 when he started, to 17, would ferret in because the Jews would trust him, he was a young Jew.
[00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:50.363]  Just like child molesters use teenagers to lure kids, they'd think, oh, we can let him know our hidden place.
[00:36:50.983 --> 00:36:52.803]  If they gave him money and stuff, he'd bring them food.
[00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:56.304]  Then he'd find out what they had, he'd sell them out, they'd get rounded up.
[00:36:57.025 --> 00:37:02.666]  He was a Judas goat, Jew, they would send in to find the hidden Jews.
[00:37:03.106 --> 00:37:04.467]  To find folks like Anne Frank.
[00:37:05.728 --> 00:37:17.251]  That's why he's a hero of liberal Jews, and a hero of the ADL, they give him the highest award, and a hero of the left, because he's the greatest living Nazi collaborator that is still around.
[00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:18.791]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[00:37:19.331 --> 00:37:22.052]  These are really twisted, sick people, the left folks.
[00:37:22.292 --> 00:37:23.352]  They're really into evil.
[00:37:23.432 --> 00:37:24.252]  They think it's cool.
[00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:35.075]  And it's a better joke for them to know he's a Nazi and funds their main operations, and has overthrown all these other countries, and had nothing but an evil history after overthrowing Ukraine,
[00:37:38.271 --> 00:37:46.620]  Overthrowing many nations of the Middle East with the Arab Spring, putting the radical Muslims in that enslaved the women, throw the gays off buildings, blow up the churches.
[00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:52.085]  This is a very, very sick, ruthless guy, but he's their bad guy hero.
[00:37:52.646 --> 00:38:00.293]  That's why in the last James Bond movie, it's based on him and the Quantum Group as the main group funding Spectre, funding both sides of every major war.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.504]  British intelligence helped write the script, and they admit that's George Soros, and the Quantum Group is the name of his main fund.
[00:38:07.344 --> 00:38:17.791]  So he's a literal James Bond villain, and Anderson Cooper of the Central Intelligence Agency, that's admitted, went on television and said that we made all this up.
[00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:25.236]  And that we made it up, but some of the leadership of the so-called New Right turns out to actually work for the Democrats.
[00:38:26.357 --> 00:38:28.499]  So here is a clip from Anderson Cooper
[00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.712]  Going beyond any level of fake news ever seen before.
[00:38:32.732 --> 00:38:35.955]  I mean, he is going where no man has dared to go before.
[00:38:37.035 --> 00:38:37.336]  Here it is.
[00:38:39.124 --> 00:38:43.767]  As disgusting as both rallies were, there is something else that caught our eye when it posted this past Friday.
[00:38:44.248 --> 00:38:47.550]  It's the claim that the August protest, the one that killed Ms.
[00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.032]  Heyer, was some sort of left-wing plot.
[00:38:50.352 --> 00:38:53.634]  Now, who, you might ask, would say something so offensive and disgusting as that?
[00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:56.116]  Some shock-jock radio personality, maybe?
[00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:56.756]  No.
[00:38:57.016 --> 00:38:59.718]  An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S.
[00:38:59.758 --> 00:39:00.158]  Congress.
[00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:03.601]  Here he is, two-term Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar.
[00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:08.324]  Now, here's exactly what the Congressman said to Vice News correspondent Ellie Reeve.
[00:39:10.104 --> 00:39:12.605]  Let's look at the person that actually started the rally.
[00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:18.127]  It's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street that was an Obama sympathizer.
[00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:18.947]  So wait a minute.
[00:39:19.087 --> 00:39:21.648]  Be careful where you start taking these people to.
[00:39:22.328 --> 00:39:23.308]  And look at the background.
[00:39:23.548 --> 00:39:27.769]  George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals.
[00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:28.950]  Who is he?
[00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.951]  I think he's from Hungary.
[00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:32.012]  I think he was Jewish.
[00:39:32.052 --> 00:39:34.294]  And I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.
[00:39:35.274 --> 00:39:37.596]  We better be careful over where we go with those.
[00:39:37.936 --> 00:39:42.420]  Do you think George Soros funded the Neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville?
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.901]  Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[00:39:45.842 --> 00:39:48.684]  Again, that was Republican Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar.
[00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:51.747]  This man, keeping him honest, does he have proof?
[00:39:52.287 --> 00:39:53.008]  No, nothing.
[00:39:53.128 --> 00:39:54.709]  In other words, it's a false flag.
[00:39:54.749 --> 00:39:57.231]  He's spreading an insulting and disgusting conspiracy theory.
[00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:57.691]  And a pause.
[00:39:59.514 --> 00:40:14.603]  Cooper, it turns out all three leaders, we've had two of them on, of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, were Democrats just a year ago, and have all this financing.
[00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:19.506]  So you're saying it's a disgusting lie.
[00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:20.246]  No, it's not.
[00:40:20.566 --> 00:40:21.187]  It's a fact.
[00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:24.914]  But you don't even show any proof we're lying.
[00:40:24.935 --> 00:40:25.875]  You just say we're lying.
[00:40:26.216 --> 00:40:30.800]  But now he tells the Whopper that I made up that Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.281]  Here it is.
[00:40:32.176 --> 00:40:33.017]  We're good to go.
[00:41:01.337 --> 00:41:02.358]  He's certainly a charmer.
[00:41:02.618 --> 00:41:17.970]  As for billionaire investor George Soros, who does back liberal causes, a spokeswoman for his foundation issued a statement to Vice News that reads in part, quote, George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and he has spent his life supporting efforts to ensure that such terrifying authoritarianism never takes root again.
[00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.172]  He was 14 years old when the war ended.
[00:41:20.252 --> 00:41:21.913]  He did not collaborate with the Nazis.
[00:41:21.953 --> 00:41:23.354]  He did not help round up people.
[00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.536]  He did not confiscate anybody's property.
[00:41:26.176 --> 00:41:27.317]  Joining me now is Ellie Reeves.
[00:41:27.337 --> 00:41:34.985]  She's the Vice News reporter who did that interview with Congressman Gosar and who was also at the original rally in Charlottesville who did such amazing reporting.
[00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.289]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:42.073]  That's the type of garbage they engage in and they go on to blame me and the rest of it.
[00:41:42.493 --> 00:41:43.294]  So here's the headline.
[00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:47.158]  CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros Nazi ties.
[00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:57.135]  But then we have the whole 12 and a half minute interview from 60 Minutes posted in the article where he goes into how he helped round the people up.
[00:41:57.435 --> 00:41:59.657]  And I just played the clip earlier.
[00:42:00.617 --> 00:42:05.422]  Later in the transmission today, I'm going to air the entire 60 Minutes piece for you.
[00:42:05.442 --> 00:42:08.044]  So you can see it unedited for yourself.
[00:42:09.403 --> 00:42:11.163]  Until we upload it to YouTube or Facebook.
[00:42:11.864 --> 00:42:14.604]  I don't even think we're going to scramble it to get around the box.
[00:42:15.004 --> 00:42:16.565]  I think this is where I should follow suit.
[00:42:17.045 --> 00:42:28.228]  If they want to say I'm a liar, and he didn't do this interview, and it's clearly fair use to have a right to expose what this public figure did, and they try to claim that I don't have a right to show you what he said, but then say I'm a liar.
[00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:32.450]  Then I think under the First Amendment we've got a lawsuit we're going to win.
[00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.851]  And I don't want to sue people.
[00:42:34.332 --> 00:42:43.598]  But man, they're censoring us more and more so they can build a straw man and say things we never said and then not let us show you what we really said.
[00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:45.579]  And I'm getting tired of it.
[00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:47.360]  But again, it's not about InfoWars.
[00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.021]  It's about truth tellers.
[00:42:49.202 --> 00:42:52.584]  And if you're a truth teller, these people come after you.
[00:42:54.218 --> 00:42:56.282]  And they want to shut you up because they're a pack of liars.
[00:42:56.683 --> 00:43:01.111]  Shame on Anderson Cooper and all these people for being collaborators with a real Nazi.
[00:43:01.352 --> 00:43:01.592]  Wow.
[00:43:02.754 --> 00:43:04.297]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running...
[00:43:05.563 --> 00:43:10.887]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:43:11.147 --> 00:43:12.288]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:12.528 --> 00:43:14.830]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:22.015]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:43:22.216 --> 00:43:25.558]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:43:25.878 --> 00:43:27.680]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:36.749]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.731]  They know how great it is.
[00:43:38.652 --> 00:43:42.436]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:44.698]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:53.401]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:43:53.821 --> 00:44:02.323]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:44:02.863 --> 00:44:05.284]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:44:05.424 --> 00:44:09.465]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:44:09.885 --> 00:44:12.785]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:44:15.186 --> 00:44:16.307]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:27.935]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:45:02.929 --> 00:45:20.727]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[00:45:21.428 --> 00:45:26.773]  And we're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:45:27.113 --> 00:45:35.982]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[00:45:36.542 --> 00:45:37.182]  Concentrate.
[00:45:37.202 --> 00:45:38.983]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:45:39.243 --> 00:45:40.684]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:42.524]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:45:42.944 --> 00:45:43.805]  It's incredible.
[00:45:44.285 --> 00:45:46.185]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:45:46.386 --> 00:45:47.526]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:45:47.986 --> 00:45:48.886]  At 15, incredible.
[00:45:49.207 --> 00:45:50.087]  It is amazing.
[00:45:50.467 --> 00:45:52.168]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:52.488 --> 00:45:53.288]  50% off Caveman.
[00:45:53.508 --> 00:45:54.829]  But only a few days left.
[00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.829]  It's about to end.
[00:45:56.429 --> 00:45:58.771]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:45:59.212 --> 00:46:04.377]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:46:04.797 --> 00:46:06.178]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:46:06.439 --> 00:46:07.600]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.801]  I want to thank you.
[00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:10.182]  We're all in this together.
[00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:20.612]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:46:27.313 --> 00:46:36.716]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:46:36.976 --> 00:46:42.337]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:47:05.865 --> 00:47:08.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.443 --> 00:47:25.104]  Big Brother.
[00:47:25.584 --> 00:47:26.824]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:27.364 --> 00:47:28.505]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:29.245 --> 00:47:30.725]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:30.965 --> 00:47:32.086]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:32.626 --> 00:47:37.367]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.688 --> 00:47:40.608]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.191]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, step right up.
[00:47:50.332 --> 00:47:58.754]  You're about to see some of the most unintentionally ridiculous, hilarious, gut-busting comedy in the world.
[00:47:59.455 --> 00:48:08.578]  You're gonna see a man who made up the fact that he grew up hard in the slums of Detroit, who poses that he's this tough guy when he's the
[00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:12.821]  Creation of Hollywood and MTV producers.
[00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:20.204]  You're gonna see him in a parking garage with a bunch of black guys behind him because he's so authentic and so hard.
[00:48:21.104 --> 00:48:30.229]  Laying out these devastating, fierce as the CNN and ABC and NBC News all said, fierce Eminem.
[00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:41.534]  And then every old fossil Hollywood leftist globalist came out and said, hey daddy-o, radical man, wanna smoke some reefer?
[00:48:42.034 --> 00:48:44.135]  Wow, we're really cutting edge, kids!
[00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:46.615]  Look, Eminem doesn't like Trump!
[00:48:47.256 --> 00:48:48.036]  Wow!
[00:48:48.476 --> 00:48:53.938]  He drew a line in the sand like it was the Alamo and he's wearing a hoodie!
[00:48:54.318 --> 00:48:56.638]  And he's got some old cars back there!
[00:48:57.018 --> 00:48:58.679]  This dude's hard!
[00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:05.645]  I saw this two days ago, and it was so bad, so cringeworthy, that I could not play it on air.
[00:49:07.005 --> 00:49:12.426]  I mean, you talk about these snot-nosed Hollywood NFL people, all of it.
[00:49:12.807 --> 00:49:13.847]  Just keep it up!
[00:49:14.247 --> 00:49:16.187]  Eminem is off the charts bad.
[00:49:16.307 --> 00:49:17.028]  No one's listening.
[00:49:17.308 --> 00:49:18.308]  No one's buying his crap.
[00:49:18.448 --> 00:49:19.428]  Everyone hates him now.
[00:49:19.668 --> 00:49:21.609]  That's what all the reviews are saying in the real world.
[00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:24.842]  He is a failed puppet of the Globalist.
[00:49:25.082 --> 00:49:27.544]  The NFL players are threatened to take a knee again.
[00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:28.304]  Please!
[00:49:28.604 --> 00:49:29.705]  Keep digging that hole!
[00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:30.445]  It's over!
[00:49:31.025 --> 00:49:33.147]  You've already lost half your audience the last few years.
[00:49:33.947 --> 00:49:34.728]  Keep it up!
[00:49:35.788 --> 00:49:36.368]  Keep it up!
[00:49:36.449 --> 00:49:36.989]  We love it!
[00:49:38.237 --> 00:49:48.366]  The failed sports broadcaster who failed at news now works at the failed propped-up GQ, which means super uncool.
[00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:55.151]  Keith Oberman has come out and said after 27 years of doubts about rap, I am now an Eminem fan.
[00:49:55.491 --> 00:49:58.654]  Best political writing of the year, period.
[00:49:59.355 --> 00:49:59.595]  Woo!
[00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:09.735]  I mean, this is a bunch of, when I say old, I don't mean they're old people, I mean old establishment folks reading off teleprompters trying to act cutting edge.
[00:50:11.027 --> 00:50:12.988]  Burning down globalism is cutting edge.
[00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:15.370]  Americana has always been cutting edge.
[00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:24.037]  You are a bunch of globalists that took over Hollywood and our media trying to use it to force down political control on us and it ain't working.
[00:50:24.337 --> 00:50:25.638]  You are losers.
[00:50:25.958 --> 00:50:26.919]  You are jokes.
[00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:29.120]  You're losing every special election.
[00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:33.023]  The neocons, the Republican Party establishment, their days are numbered.
[00:50:33.423 --> 00:50:34.324]  It's all happening.
[00:50:34.724 --> 00:50:36.506]  You are so sick.
[00:50:38.187 --> 00:50:39.849]  And it's the rediscovering of America.
[00:50:40.429 --> 00:50:59.204]  Alexander de Tocqueville, the French historian, wrote shortly after the Revolutionary War, he traveled through the Americas, and he just talked, he traveled all over the known world, and he said, Americans hate establishment, they hate elitism, they hate posers, they hate people that were given what they had, they love individualism.
[00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:05.209]  Whether you be some rich guy that did what you did, or you be some poor guy that can fight hard, or somebody that can invent something,
[00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.451]  And they wanted people that were honorable and did what they said.
[00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:09.752]  That was America.
[00:51:09.812 --> 00:51:15.695]  Not that we were perfect, but we were about overthrowing the real class structure for freedom.
[00:51:16.336 --> 00:51:17.536]  Communism's the opposite.
[00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:23.740]  And that's why they hate this country so much, is because we are the sexiest thing.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.101]  We are the Renaissance.
[00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:25.961]  We are freedom.
[00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:34.526]  We are why all these people can come here and have such a creative thing that thousands of football players shouldn't be paid five, ten million dollars a year and bitch about it.
[00:51:34.986 --> 00:51:40.191]  But I have the right to walk and no longer watch you, and you'll see who the boss is.
[00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:46.857]  We the people, the average folks of every color and every creed that are of one race with red blood, the human race.
[00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:54.604]  And America isn't perfect, but we recognize an offshore globalist attempt to turn us against each other and make us hate our country so we can be conquered!
[00:51:55.245 --> 00:52:07.576]  And we recognize mercenaries trying to pimp us out like that little bitch Eminem and his little wannabe thug pansies behind him who aren't real men who wouldn't take on the globalists like Donald Trump or anybody else!
[00:52:07.596 --> 00:52:15.163]  Now they know all the anti-military stuff blew up in their face, so they say this pro-America thing at the end, but that's just to sucker you!
[00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:18.977]  So Eminem's up there doing the hand sign, he's gonna cut somebody's head off.
[00:52:19.257 --> 00:52:21.899]  Eminem, you're not gonna do nothing, you little wimp punk!
[00:52:22.199 --> 00:52:22.859]  You nobody!
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.421]  You little coward, owned by a bunch of people like Weinstein!
[00:52:26.721 --> 00:52:28.503]  You're riding on the tip of his, you know what?
[00:52:29.423 --> 00:52:30.344]  You're a little bitch!
[00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:32.265]  Excuse me, I'm gonna stop right now.
[00:52:32.285 --> 00:52:34.226]  I haven't violated any FCC rules.
[00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:34.966]  Now!
[00:52:35.707 --> 00:52:43.672]  Let's play Millie Weaver's piece, that is super powerful, going super viral, put it up on screen a million views just since last night when they put it up on Facebook.
[00:52:44.448 --> 00:52:45.189]  There it is right there.
[00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:46.930]  Million views on Facebook.
[00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:56.457]  It needs 50 million views to put this traitor who hates America completely finally in his dirty little cowardly thug place.
[00:52:57.818 --> 00:53:00.359]  You want to get in a man's world of politics now, big boy?
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.841]  You are, you thug piece of crap.
[00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:03.642]  Here he is.
[00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.640]  Well, the BET Hip Hop Awards air tonight.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.362]  Rapper Eminem used the opportunity to let the world know what he thinks about President Trump.
[00:53:21.402 --> 00:53:21.722]  Listen.
[00:53:22.162 --> 00:53:24.083]  Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
[00:53:24.923 --> 00:53:27.164]  Wait, what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again?
[00:53:27.224 --> 00:53:29.045]  Hey, Hip Hop, Millie did a great job.
[00:53:29.365 --> 00:53:30.246]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:53:30.966 --> 00:53:31.887]  I love the fake voice.
[00:53:32.187 --> 00:53:34.228]  Wait, what's that I was gonna say?
[00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:35.868]  Let me act like I'm black.
[00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:36.949]  What's going on?
[00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:38.109]  I'm Eminem.
[00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:41.031]  I mean, it's just, it's so... Just look at this clown.
[00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:44.046]  And he looks like he took a dump in his pants, too.
[00:53:44.106 --> 00:53:48.868]  I mean, just trying to act like he's hard and on the street, and look at all this stuff.
[00:53:48.908 --> 00:53:50.548]  I mean, just, this is a joke!
[00:53:50.988 --> 00:53:51.949]  Listen to this person!
[00:53:52.149 --> 00:53:53.249]  This is pathetic!
[00:53:53.409 --> 00:53:54.510]  Just look at this worm!
[00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:55.330]  Just look at him!
[00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.710]  Play it!
[00:53:56.451 --> 00:53:57.591]  Was I gonna start this off?
[00:53:58.451 --> 00:54:00.712]  Wait, what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again?
[00:54:00.892 --> 00:54:02.973]  That's an awfully hot coffee pot.
[00:54:02.993 --> 00:54:04.994]  Should I drop it on Donald Trump?
[00:54:06.074 --> 00:54:06.414]  See that?
[00:54:06.955 --> 00:54:07.555]  That's who they are.
[00:54:09.085 --> 00:54:11.066]  Probably not, but that's all I got.
[00:54:11.346 --> 00:54:13.368]  You're talking all this trash on Trump.
[00:54:13.768 --> 00:54:17.030]  Man, we all know you're just another Illuminati chump.
[00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:22.373]  Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it like a damn Apache with a tomahawk.
[00:54:22.613 --> 00:54:26.436]  Eminem, you think you're woke, but you're really just a joke.
[00:54:26.776 --> 00:54:30.178]  Your freestyle raps, man, they sound like crap.
[00:54:30.798 --> 00:54:35.600]  Yeah, and my raps, they don't sound that good, but at least I'm not pretending I'm from the hood.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:38.981]  Oh, so now you want to talk about prayer, Mr. Satanic Illuminati Jihadi?
[00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:54.015]  Well obviously Eminem didn't take his brain force today.
[00:54:54.035 --> 00:54:55.617]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:55.917 --> 00:54:57.699]  We better give Obama props.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.361]  Give Obama props?
[00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:00.062]  For what?
[00:55:00.222 --> 00:55:01.003]  Benghazi?
[00:55:01.304 --> 00:55:02.525]  Fast and Furious?
[00:55:03.026 --> 00:55:05.769]  And you can keep your doctor, you can keep your health care plan?
[00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:07.090]  Oh wait, not!
[00:55:07.748 --> 00:55:08.828]  Intensity's heightened.
[00:55:09.649 --> 00:55:10.669]  Tensions are rising.
[00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.991]  Trump, when it comes to giving a s***, you're stingy as I am.
[00:55:15.591 --> 00:55:22.334]  Yeah, you may be stingy, Eminem, but Trump gave over a million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey.
[00:55:22.774 --> 00:55:23.895]  Put up or shut up.
[00:55:24.535 --> 00:55:28.716]  It's like we take a step forwards than backwards, but this is his form of distraction.
[00:55:28.736 --> 00:55:29.057]  You know what?
[00:55:29.077 --> 00:55:30.597]  Stop right there.
[00:55:30.617 --> 00:55:31.298]  I went to this late.
[00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:32.658]  I'm going to come back to the next segment.
[00:55:32.678 --> 00:55:35.219]  I'm going to play it without my commentary.
[00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:37.120]  But let me just add this right now.
[00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:51.993]  Trump, with the basic policies of cutting regulations and bringing back cheap electricity, we've seen 4 trillion in the stock market, 400 plus billion in new jobs, 1.6 million new jobs, 3.1% growth rate they never said we'd see again in America's history.
[00:55:52.013 --> 00:55:52.754]  They told us we were over.
[00:55:52.774 --> 00:55:56.416]  69% reduction in illegals coming across the border.
[00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:59.137]  Thousands of new factories moving back to the United States.
[00:56:01.178 --> 00:56:07.042]  The highest numbers in new factories and wage increases in modern history.
[00:56:07.921 --> 00:56:09.263]  Just everything.
[00:56:09.383 --> 00:56:11.725]  And that's with them trying to raise interest rates to block it.
[00:56:12.466 --> 00:56:20.255]  So you're saying Trump's stingy when his hotels and his golf courses for the first time are hurting and they're coming after him and his whole family and he's giving up?
[00:56:21.627 --> 00:56:27.954]  Hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money and got his pageants cancelled and everything, and then you sit there and say he's stingy like you.
[00:56:27.974 --> 00:56:33.920]  Because I know in fake thug culture, it's cool to be hard and be stingy and not take care of people around you.
[00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:35.241]  I understand that.
[00:56:35.862 --> 00:56:39.165]  So again, to watch another fake gangster thug
[00:56:39.966 --> 00:56:51.551]  Pose as if he's political, read off the teleprompter, and do a terrible job, and then watch a bunch of political whores, from Overman to you name it, act like this is the greatest performance they've ever seen in their lives.
[00:56:52.172 --> 00:56:56.033]  It just shows you how hollow, and desperate, and empty these people are.
[00:56:56.434 --> 00:57:02.516]  And it is the greatest unintentional comedy you or I will probably ever see in our lives, to watch this scum fall on their face.
[00:57:02.937 --> 00:57:03.497]  We're gonna come back.
[00:57:03.917 --> 00:57:05.978]  Little five-minute no-man's-land play this whole report.
[00:57:06.458 --> 00:57:07.138]  But please share it.
[00:57:07.178 --> 00:57:08.959]  I just retweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:57:09.419 --> 00:57:11.800]  We cross your line in the sand, you little wannabe thug.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:12.820]  Eminem.
[00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:14.361]  So, get that straight.
[00:57:14.581 --> 00:57:16.462]  Great job to Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz on that.

[00:57:40.496 --> 00:57:46.081]  Go from listening to reaching out, meeting other people, and forming organizations to take back America peacefully through culture.
[00:57:46.401 --> 00:57:47.242]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:00:07.606 --> 01:00:09.166]  Eminem done fall down.
[01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:11.267]  Eminem dum-dum.
[01:00:12.047 --> 01:00:13.608]  Punk-ass Eminem.
[01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.568]  Well, the BET Hip-Hop Awards air tonight.
[01:00:16.608 --> 01:00:20.269]  Rapper Eminem used the opportunity to let the world know what he thinks about President Trump.
[01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.650]  Listen.
[01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.010]  Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
[01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.111]  Wait, what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again?
[01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:28.312]  That's an awfully hot coffee pot.
[01:00:28.352 --> 01:00:30.392]  Should I drop it on Donald Trump?
[01:00:31.472 --> 01:00:31.833]  See that?
[01:00:32.353 --> 01:00:32.953]  That's who they are.
[01:00:34.474 --> 01:00:36.476]  Probably not, but that's all I got.
[01:00:36.736 --> 01:00:38.777]  You're talking all this trash on Trump.
[01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:42.440]  Man, we all know you're just another Illuminati chump.
[01:00:43.261 --> 01:00:47.764]  Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it like a damn Apache with a tomahawk.
[01:00:48.024 --> 01:00:51.847]  Eminem, you think you're woke, but you're really just a joke.
[01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:55.590]  Your freestyle raps, man, they sound like crap.
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:01.154]  Yeah, and my raps, they don't sound that good, but at least I'm not pretending I'm from the hood.
[01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:04.457]  Oh, so now you want to talk about prayer, Mr. Satanic Illuminati Jihadi?
[01:01:16.147 --> 01:01:19.408]  Well obviously Eminem didn't take his brain force today.
[01:01:19.428 --> 01:01:21.028]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:01:21.328 --> 01:01:23.069]  We better give Obama props.
[01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:24.729]  Give Obama props?
[01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:25.449]  For what?
[01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:27.910]  Hey, I'm Alex Jones!
[01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:30.390]  This is me!
[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.131]  I'm Eminem!
[01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:33.091]  I'm real, man!
[01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:34.231]  Intensity's heightened.
[01:01:35.072 --> 01:01:36.052]  Tensions are rising.
[01:01:37.032 --> 01:01:40.375]  Trump, when it comes to giving a s***, you're stingy as I am.
[01:01:40.716 --> 01:01:41.016]  Liar.
[01:01:41.036 --> 01:01:47.742]  Yeah, you may be stingy, Eminem, but Trump gave over a million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey.
[01:01:48.183 --> 01:01:49.324]  Put up or shut up.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.682]  It's like we take a step forwards than backwards, but this is his form of distraction.
[01:01:55.382 --> 01:01:59.123]  Plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL.
[01:01:59.184 --> 01:02:00.664]  They're kneeling for our flag.
[01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:03.085]  Can you imagine how pathetic Eminem is?
[01:02:03.165 --> 01:02:08.567]  While they're benefiting from the lifestyles that these fallen soldiers never had.
[01:02:08.967 --> 01:02:11.948]  So we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico.
[01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:18.371]  Actually, Puerto Rico got caught withholding so that idiots like you could go out and scold him.
[01:02:18.951 --> 01:02:20.812]  Then says he wants to lower our taxes.
[01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:27.313]  Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
[01:02:28.034 --> 01:02:31.194]  Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered.
[01:02:31.475 --> 01:02:36.476]  Yeah, Trump called out the Clinton Foundation from stealing money from the Haiti nation.
[01:02:36.736 --> 01:02:39.637]  Bet you don't want to talk about that in your s***ty little rap.
[01:02:40.237 --> 01:02:45.082]  Then does it more from his endorsement of banning support for the Klansmen.
[01:02:45.582 --> 01:02:50.988]  The only KKK lover I've seen is Hillary Clinton kissing all up on Senator Byrd.
[01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:52.569]  She needs to get her mouth cleaned.
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:03:00.838]  Forking a dagger in his face, this 94-year-old grandpa who keeps ignoring our past historical deplorable factors.
[01:03:01.238 --> 01:03:01.799]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:16.191]  Eminem, you want to talk about racism and bigotry and all this holier-than-thou virtue-signaling crap coming from the guy who talks about murdering, raping, and killing women regularly in your music videos?
[01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:17.992]  Shut up!
[01:03:18.453 --> 01:03:19.434]  This is for Colin!
[01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:20.755]  Ball up a fist!
[01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:24.677]  And then he attacks Southerners.
[01:03:24.737 --> 01:03:25.197]  He's a bigot.
[01:03:48.066 --> 01:03:49.327]  Who's a supporter of his.
[01:03:50.267 --> 01:03:51.948]  I'm drawing in the sand a line.
[01:03:52.048 --> 01:03:52.528]  We see it.
[01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.169]  It's either for or against.
[01:03:54.649 --> 01:03:55.950]  Newsflash, Eminem.
[01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:58.911]  There's already been a line drawn in the sand.
[01:03:58.931 --> 01:03:59.992]  And you know what?
[01:04:00.352 --> 01:04:04.854]  You're standing on the side with all the globalists and rich celebrity elitists.
[01:04:05.014 --> 01:04:12.398]  And if you can't decide who you like more in your split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this.
[01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:22.260]  And by the looks of your album sales, it's apparent that the American people have already done this.
[01:04:30.889 --> 01:04:32.050]  We love our military.
[01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.311]  And we love our country.
[01:04:35.152 --> 01:04:36.273]  We love our Somalis.
[01:04:36.493 --> 01:04:37.573]  We love our Muslims.
[01:04:37.894 --> 01:04:38.914]  Oh, they're so good.
[01:04:39.215 --> 01:04:40.215]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[01:04:40.455 --> 01:04:42.117]  You sold out, sellout.
[01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:43.678]  So get the hell out.
[01:04:44.078 --> 01:04:49.902]  Americans don't care about another whining celebrity millionaire.
[01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:57.354]  All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put together little baby Eminem again.
[01:04:57.374 --> 01:05:01.317]  Another failed, disgusting loser trying to stay relevant.
[01:05:01.617 --> 01:05:02.118]  Bye-bye.

[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.804]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.106 --> 01:06:32.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes, he's with us.
[01:06:33.888 --> 01:06:40.452]  The model of a true on-the-ground, but also in the research, investigative journalist, James O'Keefe.
[01:06:41.192 --> 01:06:51.498]  The guy with his team that brought down the organized crime syndicate ACORN, that undoubtedly helped defeat Hillary in 2016, joins us.
[01:06:51.558 --> 01:06:55.180]  And I think it's just better if he leads us through this, because part one was powerful.
[01:06:56.317 --> 01:07:00.818]  But that's what got all the news yesterday on Drudge and hundreds of newspapers.
[01:07:01.698 --> 01:07:02.718]  And we're going to play part one.
[01:07:02.898 --> 01:07:03.639]  He's going to walk us through it.
[01:07:03.659 --> 01:07:05.499]  But part two is really powerful.
[01:07:06.199 --> 01:07:12.681]  In a cashless world, we're also going to get into some of those reports that are coming up, his view on what's happened in Puerto Rico and other areas.
[01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:18.962]  But we've got a big report out here, how the New York Times and YouTube collusion spawns fake news.
[01:07:19.422 --> 01:07:22.323]  Bastard child with his undercover journalist.
[01:07:23.183 --> 01:07:28.324]  There with these New York Times high-level operatives bragging, oh, it doesn't matter if folks don't want to see our stuff.
[01:07:28.664 --> 01:07:31.425]  We just force-feed it and then block all their stuff.
[01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:36.646]  That's why we can have videos every day that get a million views in one day.
[01:07:37.866 --> 01:07:43.267]  And then I go to the most viewed, there'll be something with 200,000 views in the trending or most viewed.
[01:07:43.487 --> 01:07:45.108]  And I'm like, it's three days old.
[01:07:45.188 --> 01:07:47.248]  It's because they're force-feeding it.
[01:07:47.948 --> 01:07:51.929]  During the campaign, you'd see a Hillary speech with 10,000 views and it'd say trending.
[01:07:52.912 --> 01:07:55.695]  But then you'd see some other video with 10 million views in two days.
[01:07:55.995 --> 01:07:56.535]  Wouldn't be there.
[01:07:56.576 --> 01:08:07.606]  So that's part two of what James O'Keefe has discovered to show the covert, massive discrimination and censorship that's going on, plus all the admissions that are now happening.
[01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:12.291]  Twitter is censoring women who Weinstein has apologized to, but who are saying he raped.
[01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:14.273]  So now women, movie stars.
[01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:16.594]  If they criticize Hollywood or being blocked.
[01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:20.457]  James O'Keefe, I tell you, I see this as a major sign of desperation.
[01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:23.459]  Aren't they jumping the shark here with the Streisand effect?
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.741]  Well, yeah, I think so, Alex.
[01:08:25.781 --> 01:08:37.350]  The YouTube platform says, quote, we believe everyone should have a chance to be discovered, to build a business and succeed on their own terms, and that people, not gatekeepers, decide what's popular.
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.690]  But!
[01:08:38.473 --> 01:08:51.720]  According to this New York Times editor we caught on tape, as well as his buddies at YouTube, we actually have an employee at YouTube on hidden camera admitting this the first time any journalist anywhere has taken hidden cameras inside these Silicon Valley bigwigs.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.783]  This YouTube guy says that they determine what's legitimate and illegitimate news and they specifically call out you.
[01:08:58.563 --> 01:09:05.965]  Alex, they say that, at the very least, in our news carousel at the top of YouTube, that they can determine which news partners are legitimate.
[01:09:06.385 --> 01:09:13.987]  And he says, if at that point, quote, somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well, they were looking for him to begin with anyway, unquote.
[01:09:14.007 --> 01:09:17.348]  Which directly violates YouTube's mission statement.
[01:09:18.509 --> 01:09:36.145]  Now we finally have proved that there's a sort of conspiracy, a sort of collusion between these mainstream media players and these Silicon Valley giants against the interests of truth, against the interests of the so-called non-human intervention algorithms, and obviously it's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:38.906]  So you've got New York Times, CNN, YouTube.
[01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:41.167]  I know you've got a lot more coming.
[01:09:41.187 --> 01:09:44.189]  And as you said on the show, you told me you were coming two years ago.
[01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:52.573]  You said we're working with former CIA on classic legal tactics to infiltrate them, aka good-looking women here, or I guess in some cases good-looking guys.
[01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:55.614]  But all I got to say is, buddy, you've reached a new milestone.
[01:09:56.014 --> 01:09:59.936]  Not even government agencies have done as good a job as the team you've assembled.
[01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:03.198]  So I know you don't want credit yourself, but listeners need to understand,
[01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:08.300]  Thank you so much for what you've done for freedom, not just America.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.862]  And thank you for what you've done for my four children, James O'Keefe.
[01:10:11.622 --> 01:10:12.903]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:13.784]  I appreciate that.
[01:10:13.804 --> 01:10:16.566]  I do think it's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:10:16.586 --> 01:10:20.069]  I think we have more videos coming, but we're going to roll them out slowly.
[01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:24.393]  This is a New York Times editor who's responsible for all their videos.
[01:10:24.673 --> 01:10:27.095]  It's called the Audience Strategy Editor at the New York Times.
[01:10:27.535 --> 01:10:28.696]  It wasn't just beautiful women.
[01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:29.657]  We had men
[01:10:30.168 --> 01:10:37.832]  Who had built relationships and when I say that I mean just building confidence with the people inside YouTube and over a series of meetings.
[01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:40.574]  They talk about the relationships on the platform.
[01:10:40.594 --> 01:10:46.978]  They talk about the gatekeepers and then they can arbitrarily determine what news people see.
[01:10:47.794 --> 01:10:55.578]  And there have been some reporting about this news carousel on YouTube, but no one knew that there was a human component.
[01:10:55.598 --> 01:10:59.260]  That there was a sort of arbitrary human component blocking it out.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:00.961]  It's funny that they call you out by name.
[01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:08.124]  This Ernie Petit guy at YouTube, his name is Ernie, and he says, and he's wearing a Black Lives Matter sweatshirt with Google on the sleeve.
[01:11:08.504 --> 01:11:13.387]  And he specifically says, this is one of the meetings you're seeing right here, but there's another meeting where he's wearing something else.
[01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:16.289]  He specifically says that he tries to help Black Lives Matter.
[01:11:16.589 --> 01:11:24.675]  Why there's someone at YouTube trying to promote one agenda but not some other news source is beyond me.
[01:11:24.695 --> 01:11:27.758]  And I hope, I mean, the New York Times has responded, Alex.
[01:11:27.778 --> 01:11:33.842]  This is the managing editor of the New York Times said that this reporter, quote, violated their ethical guidelines.
[01:11:35.323 --> 01:11:38.986]  We don't know whether that means they're going to fire this New York Times editor or they're going to promote him.
[01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:45.482]  But the main argument that everyone always says is that the New York Times does not have a political agenda.
[01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:48.606]  That's what they say the difference between people like us and them is.
[01:11:49.047 --> 01:11:54.475]  When the truth is that their agenda far exceeds the agenda of the citizen journalist.
[01:11:54.946 --> 01:12:01.311]  Well, look, when I get in my gym, in my garage, and turn on YouTube, it's all leftist, globalist crap.
[01:12:01.911 --> 01:12:04.113]  And then, your stuff, my stuff, it's nowhere there.
[01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:09.577]  Even though I'm actually watching that, used to, just a few years ago, it would put that in my top feed, knowing I wanted it.
[01:12:09.837 --> 01:12:10.798]  It now blocks that.
[01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:17.323]  When I turn on my iPhone, I get fed Huffington Post, CNN, used to maybe a little Fox News, no, zero.
[01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.125]  No Breitbart, no InfoWars, no Project Veritas, no Drudge Reports.
[01:12:22.026 --> 01:12:22.707]  It's everywhere.
[01:12:22.727 --> 01:12:24.288]  They're force-feeding their garbage.
[01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:28.952]  Since you mentioned this YouTube individual, tell us a little bit about him.
[01:12:28.972 --> 01:12:29.772]  We're going to play this clip.
[01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.415]  So this guy's name is Ernie Petty.
[01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.575]  He works at YouTube.
[01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:38.239]  He's responsible for, I guess, the brand and strategy.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.502]  He works with partners inside mainstream media companies.
[01:12:41.522 --> 01:12:43.924]  This is another thing that no one, I guess, has reported on.
[01:12:44.424 --> 01:12:48.408]  The Huffington Post, New York Times, are specifically mentioned by Petty.
[01:12:49.546 --> 01:12:58.632]  As mainstream partners that he collaborates with to make their content the ones that show up as legitimate news and to hurt people like you.
[01:12:58.992 --> 01:13:09.419]  He specifically talks about you and he says that in some cases we can make browsers have to manually go to this other news even if it's very successful.
[01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.600]  He also talks about changing the algorithms.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.222]  He says that there has to be some human intervention.
[01:13:14.662 --> 01:13:20.267]  To make up for, to compensate for things that they think should be trending, but are not.
[01:13:20.287 --> 01:13:21.608]  But notice what we're missing here.
[01:13:22.188 --> 01:13:30.855]  The total arrogance that politically, globally, freedom is exploding, censors are in trouble, the NFL, Hollywood, they're all imploding, the censorship isn't working.
[01:13:31.235 --> 01:13:33.796]  Here is the YouTube New York Times interface.
[01:13:34.096 --> 01:13:38.418]  Here he is laying out how they run the Ministry of Truth, a.k.a.
[01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:45.100]  Winston Smith 1984, for real, 2017, a la James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.181]  That's what that news carousel kind of does.
[01:13:49.361 --> 01:13:53.423]  It's above the search results.
[01:13:55.243 --> 01:13:56.644]  At the very least, we can say that
[01:13:59.799 --> 01:14:06.724]  This shelf of videos from news partners is legitimate news, because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[01:14:07.585 --> 01:14:15.210]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well, they were looking for him to begin with anyway.
[01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.192]  Algorithms control YouTube.
[01:14:17.672 --> 01:14:21.935]  But according to Petty, his team has the power to shape those algorithms.
[01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:26.779]  For Nick Dudik and the New York Times, this connection is invaluable.
[01:14:27.499 --> 01:14:40.791]  Nick is probably, like, one of the... He's one of the people, I think, who has more knowledge about YouTube as a platform than probably almost anyone else that I know.
[01:14:40.991 --> 01:14:44.574]  From what we've heard, Dudek has more than just knowledge of YouTube.
[01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.075]  He has access.
[01:14:46.696 --> 01:14:51.520]  We wondered, what exactly does a friendship with Petty buy the New York Times?
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:58.825]  There are things that exist in the product that, like, are definitely optimized for news.
[01:14:58.905 --> 01:15:05.049]  Like, we have a news channel page that features... We've got to stop right here.
[01:15:05.069 --> 01:15:05.590]  We're going to break.
[01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:11.334]  I'm coming back with James O'Keefe, but we're talking with James O'Keefe about this Project Veritas fame on the other side, but here's the key for me.
[01:15:11.914 --> 01:15:19.380]  Under classic racketeering laws of the Civil Rights Act, if Christians have to bake a cake for gay folks, which I do anyways, I'm a free market guy,
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:31.688]  Then they're telling us as libertarians or conservatives, they put a prior constraint on us to where we get discriminated against and can't use the bathroom or go to the soup kitchen or sit at the back of the bus.
[01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:35.430]  In fact, we can't even get on the YouTube bus is what he's saying.
[01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:40.314]  We're going to talk about this massive form of discrimination straight ahead and the groundbreaking
[01:15:40.894 --> 01:15:43.995]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen, the truth is striking back!
[01:15:44.015 --> 01:15:45.355]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:11.077]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:16:11.337 --> 01:16:12.458]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:16:12.718 --> 01:16:15.019]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:22.183]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:16:22.404 --> 01:16:25.745]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:16:26.066 --> 01:16:27.867]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:16:28.507 --> 01:16:36.916]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:16:36.957 --> 01:16:37.918]  They know how great it is.
[01:16:38.839 --> 01:16:42.623]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:16:43.444 --> 01:16:44.885]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:16:45.706 --> 01:16:53.591]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:16:54.031 --> 01:17:02.757]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:05.479]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:09.682]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:17:10.082 --> 01:17:12.984]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:16.246]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:17:16.346 --> 01:17:27.575]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:42.188]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get

[01:18:03.092 --> 01:18:20.902]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:18:21.622 --> 01:18:26.948]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:36.218]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:18:36.738 --> 01:18:37.359]  Concentrate.
[01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.160]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:40.862]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:18:41.082 --> 01:18:42.724]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:18:43.124 --> 01:18:43.985]  It's incredible.
[01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:46.387]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:18:46.568 --> 01:18:47.729]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:49.090]  At 15, incredible.
[01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:50.291]  It is amazing.
[01:18:50.652 --> 01:18:51.913]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.474]  50% off Caveman.
[01:18:53.694 --> 01:18:55.016]  But only a few days left.
[01:18:55.276 --> 01:18:56.017]  It's about to end.
[01:18:56.617 --> 01:18:58.939]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:04.565]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:19:04.985 --> 01:19:06.366]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:07.788]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:19:08.168 --> 01:19:08.969]  I want to thank you.
[01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:10.350]  We're all in this together.
[01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:20.779]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.942]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:19:25.163 --> 01:19:26.964]  But these specials have got to end.
[01:19:26.984 --> 01:19:36.911]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:19:37.171 --> 01:19:42.534]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:19:43.015 --> 01:19:47.658]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[01:19:48.298 --> 01:19:55.963]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:56.283 --> 01:20:01.106]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:20:05.789 --> 01:20:08.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.789 --> 01:20:25.512]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:46.223]  I want listeners to understand something in the nine minutes we have left with James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:20:59.019 --> 01:21:13.315]  We have the individual from the New York Times liaisoning with the YouTube executives, bragging how they censor conservative, pro-America, pro-military, pro-common sense, pro-Christian stuff that exposes radical Islam, that's all being censored.
[01:21:13.595 --> 01:21:16.459]  They expose Black Lives Matter, people saying kill cops, that gets blocked.
[01:21:16.819 --> 01:21:19.001]  I mean, this is the radicals they've hired
[01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:33.197]  To run this, and then Mozilla just today gave $100,000 to Antifa and let them have access to their main servers and their systems to set up this big rebellion group to start basically a civil war November 4th.
[01:21:34.518 --> 01:21:36.239]  You cannot make this up.
[01:21:36.899 --> 01:21:41.062]  So Google, last time I checked, just gave $10 million this year to Black Lives Matter alone.
[01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:51.058]  These are their brown shirt foot soldiers to not just beat us up on the street, but to also control things in cyberspace, which is illegal.
[01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:54.560]  It's racketeering, it's discriminatory, it violates so many laws.
[01:21:55.281 --> 01:21:58.264]  To have them, and we know they're doing it, but to then get them on tape.
[01:21:58.284 --> 01:22:00.585]  Because I've been looking at suing them, because I have to.
[01:22:01.206 --> 01:22:02.387]  Because they're blocking us everywhere.
[01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:05.972]  That's a way of fighting back that's non-physical.
[01:22:06.012 --> 01:22:07.454]  So it's one of the few things left to us.
[01:22:07.834 --> 01:22:10.277]  Having a video like this is invaluable.
[01:22:10.658 --> 01:22:12.160]  That's why I said I think I'm going to give a donation.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.081]  I think I am.
[01:22:13.121 --> 01:22:14.242]  I'm giving $20,000 to Project Veritas today.
[01:22:17.446 --> 01:22:18.306]  Get the accountant over here.
[01:22:18.326 --> 01:22:19.187]  I want to sign the check.
[01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:19.787]  He'll be gone.
[01:22:20.107 --> 01:22:21.368]  But I want to sign it on air.
[01:22:21.748 --> 01:22:23.408]  Because everybody needs to do this.
[01:22:23.468 --> 01:22:25.309]  We're in this together, folks.
[01:22:25.589 --> 01:22:26.670]  James O'Keefe, I'm not kidding.
[01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:28.930]  This is so valuable, what you're doing, just to freedom.
[01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:30.651]  These people are so authoritarian.
[01:22:30.851 --> 01:22:33.332]  They're so arrogant that they think they're going to beat us.
[01:22:33.472 --> 01:22:34.253]  I think we're going to win.
[01:22:34.493 --> 01:22:38.514]  So in the eight minutes we have left, or seven minutes, finish up the key points folks need to know.
[01:22:38.534 --> 01:22:40.335]  Because there's hours of these videos you have.
[01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:42.801]  Thank you, Alex, and I really appreciate that.
[01:22:42.821 --> 01:22:43.442]  It means a lot.
[01:22:43.742 --> 01:22:47.243]  That will hire another undercover journalist for a long time to help.
[01:22:47.483 --> 01:22:50.683]  Let me just go over what we've exposed here so that your audience knows what's happening.
[01:22:51.064 --> 01:22:55.825]  This is a guy at YouTube who's, quote, brand and diversity curation at YouTube.
[01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:57.325]  This is self-described.
[01:22:57.365 --> 01:22:58.385]  His name is Ernie Petit.
[01:22:58.445 --> 01:23:03.447]  He, quote, works on the team that provides human inputs into a lot of the machinery at YouTube.
[01:23:03.467 --> 01:23:04.327]  This is what he says.
[01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:06.449]  The so-called news carousel.
[01:23:06.469 --> 01:23:08.432]  These are the trending videos about news.
[01:23:08.893 --> 01:23:10.034]  Alex, you're a news provider.
[01:23:10.114 --> 01:23:10.615]  I'm a news provider.
[01:23:10.635 --> 01:23:11.035]  This isn't people.
[01:23:11.075 --> 01:23:12.177]  This isn't real voting.
[01:23:12.437 --> 01:23:13.719]  Basically, it's a fake election.
[01:23:13.759 --> 01:23:15.021]  Your vote doesn't matter now.
[01:23:15.321 --> 01:23:16.703]  This guy sits there and decides.
[01:23:17.384 --> 01:23:17.604]  Right.
[01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:22.511]  He's one of the few people at YouTube that actually is part of this so-called human
[01:23:23.338 --> 01:23:28.602]  Uh, human inputs he calls it, where he adjusts the way the videos are seen.
[01:23:28.662 --> 01:23:33.966]  And by the way, YouTube is one of the last places that people like me can actually go publish our information.
[01:23:34.027 --> 01:23:34.987]  It's owned by Google.
[01:23:35.408 --> 01:23:40.872]  This guy Ernie is sitting at the table wearing a Black Lives Matter sweater with Google emblazoned on the sleeve.
[01:23:41.312 --> 01:23:54.362]  And he's talking about the relationships he has with people at Huffington Post, New York Times, and Black Lives Matter, and how he gives preferential treatment to these news companies, as opposed to citizen journalists like you and I. This New York Times reporter he's referring to, his name is Nick Dudick.
[01:23:54.782 --> 01:23:56.624]  He's the subject of the first video that we did.
[01:23:56.664 --> 01:24:00.687]  There's the sweater that says Black Lives Matter on it, with Google on the sleeve.
[01:24:01.267 --> 01:24:05.450]  And he's talking about this relationship with Nick Dudick in the first video we released.
[01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.351]  This is an unbelievable video.
[01:24:07.731 --> 01:24:12.234]  The New York Times reporter says that he is targeting Trump's businesses.
[01:24:12.294 --> 01:24:14.256]  He's trying to boycott Trump's businesses.
[01:24:14.636 --> 01:24:20.880]  He brings information to the front of the New York Times' pages that are more negative when it comes to videos.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.602]  That is classic racketeering, classic stalking.
[01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:40.676]  Right, and while the New York Times is publicly, the videos are so serious that the managing editor, the deputy managing editor, a guy named Clifford Levy, who works in the New York Times, said, quote, the employee violated our ethical standards and, quote, we are reviewing the situation.
[01:24:40.736 --> 01:24:46.720]  Now, this video is so big that the New York Times is condemning the activities of the employee.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.703]  We're wondering whether that means they're going to give him a promotion or whether they're going to fire him.
[01:24:50.943 --> 01:24:52.584]  We can tell you that there's more videos coming.
[01:24:53.245 --> 01:24:58.472]  And the New York Times has an ethical policy that says you can't do anything to compromise your neutrality.
[01:24:59.033 --> 01:25:01.336]  So, of course, the New York Times does have a political agenda.
[01:25:01.356 --> 01:25:02.577]  That doesn't surprise you.
[01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.300]  It doesn't surprise the people watching this program.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.682]  But you've caught them red-handed.
[01:25:05.862 --> 01:25:07.464]  But getting it on video is one thing.
[01:25:07.665 --> 01:25:08.506]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:09.386 --> 01:25:09.967]  Keep going.
[01:25:10.547 --> 01:25:25.485]  So what I need you guys to do, I do have an action item, this Clifford Levy guy, his Twitter is Clifford Levy, that's Clifford L-E-V-Y, and he has already responded, but we don't know the status of this employee at the New York Times, his editor is
[01:25:25.825 --> 01:25:27.905]  We don't know whether he's been suspended, whether he's been fired.
[01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:43.248]  We need you to tweet at Clifford Levy and ask him, there's the comment, we need to ask him, what is the status of these people working with YouTube employees to ban people they don't like, to ban ideas they don't like?
[01:25:43.288 --> 01:25:45.708]  That's obviously not, that's a violation of YouTube.
[01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.489]  And then to terrorize Trump's businesses and brag about it.
[01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:50.669]  Right, and brag about doing so.
[01:25:50.849 --> 01:25:55.170]  And also, what is the status of this YouTube employee who's on tape, Alex?
[01:25:55.799 --> 01:25:57.660]  He's specifically calling you out.
[01:25:58.081 --> 01:26:02.423]  He says that we determine what's legitimate and what's illegitimate, and that's dangerous.
[01:26:02.504 --> 01:26:05.325]  That's not YouTube's job to determine what is legitimate.
[01:26:05.345 --> 01:26:05.746]  Let me ask you this.
[01:26:05.826 --> 01:26:07.427]  Don't they get the Streisand effect?
[01:26:07.907 --> 01:26:11.790]  Like they've been caught at the White House when it was Obama talking about you and shutting you down.
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:13.311]  That shot you up there even more.
[01:26:13.691 --> 01:26:14.672]  Or trying to shut me down.
[01:26:14.952 --> 01:26:22.277]  Don't they get that, yes, we're getting hit by the censorship, but we're still growing despite it because people go, wow, this must be really important.
[01:26:23.243 --> 01:26:25.024]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think they understand that.
[01:26:25.044 --> 01:26:30.086]  I don't think they realize they're not going to change their behavior because it's the virtuous thing to do.
[01:26:30.146 --> 01:26:34.669]  They're not going to stop doing this immoral... Don't take my word for it.
[01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:36.349]  He says it's a violation of their own ethics.
[01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:38.430]  The managing editor of the New York Times has responded to us.
[01:26:38.791 --> 01:26:45.014]  He said that they are violating their ethical policies, but they're not going to clean up their act because they're doing wrong things.
[01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.955]  They're only going to clean up their act if we shine a light.
[01:26:48.195 --> 01:26:49.016]  On the cockroaches.
[01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:51.098]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg, Alex.
[01:26:51.158 --> 01:26:53.159]  We want them to say it's an isolated incident.
[01:26:53.199 --> 01:26:55.782]  They said it was just a junior position doing this.
[01:26:56.122 --> 01:27:05.350]  We hope that they say these things because, Alex, what's coming next is a much higher level editor who's also admitting to a political agenda.
[01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:07.611]  And it's a very systemic thing.
[01:27:07.672 --> 01:27:12.335]  The difference between us and them, they say, is that we have a political agenda and they don't.
[01:27:12.696 --> 01:27:15.058]  But we are exposing that lie for what it is.
[01:27:15.518 --> 01:27:23.346]  Well, I mean, we got documents months ago that Google admitted were real, where they hired a company for over a million dollars to go around with real people voting us down.
[01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:29.612]  So they didn't do it in the algorithm, they hired outside PR companies to have thousands of people go vote us down.
[01:27:29.632 --> 01:27:31.855]  I mean, this is just insane!
[01:27:32.335 --> 01:27:33.136]  It's over the top!
[01:27:34.039 --> 01:27:37.805]  Yeah, I mean, it's insane, but that's the power of... Every time I go on your show, I say this.
[01:27:38.305 --> 01:27:40.489]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[01:27:40.529 --> 01:27:46.738]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:27:47.159 --> 01:27:49.823]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:27:50.283 --> 01:27:51.864]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[01:27:51.904 --> 01:27:53.705]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[01:27:53.745 --> 01:28:01.388]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him, and manually have to find that video.
[01:28:01.408 --> 01:28:06.751]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:10.313]  And we work with the Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter and the New York Times.
[01:28:10.693 --> 01:28:23.001]  These people, Nick Dudick is either a serial liar or he has one of the biggest conflicts of interest in the history of the world because he says in this video these James Comey's godson and that nobody knows that.
[01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:26.263]  He's either lying about it or he's under some type of psychosis.
[01:28:26.463 --> 01:28:30.005]  These are the types of people that YouTube's working with.
[01:28:30.285 --> 01:28:30.826]  Exactly.
[01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:36.252]  Listen, James, you're a hard guy to get on, but when I said I'm doing the $20,000, that's not me doing you a favor.
[01:28:36.272 --> 01:28:37.153]  You've done me a favor.
[01:28:37.173 --> 01:28:38.334]  This is what we need.
[01:28:38.374 --> 01:28:41.557]  I'm looking at spending millions on real suits to go after them.
[01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:42.538]  That's what a real suit would take.
[01:28:42.779 --> 01:28:44.781]  Three-year battle with Google.
[01:28:44.961 --> 01:28:45.361]  So, $20,000 to you.
[01:28:45.401 --> 01:28:46.943]  This is going to help our suits hugely.
[01:28:47.243 --> 01:28:51.848]  So, please, I know you're really busy, but come back in the next few days to give us an update as more comes out.
[01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:52.149]  Please?
[01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:53.170]  We'll do.
[01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:53.551]  We'll do.
[01:28:53.671 --> 01:28:54.171]  Absolutely.
[01:28:54.332 --> 01:28:54.632]  Okay.
[01:28:54.652 --> 01:28:55.313]  Well, I gotta go.
[01:28:55.353 --> 01:28:56.794]  James O'Keefe, ProzacVeritas.com.
[01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:57.855]  I am making that donation.
[01:28:58.216 --> 01:28:59.878]  Because he's done all of us a favor.
[01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:00.178]  No, no.
[01:29:00.238 --> 01:29:00.758]  Everybody should.
[01:29:01.019 --> 01:29:02.220]  Well, we'll be back to talk about the aftermath.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:02.580]  Thank you.
[01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:04.603]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:29:05.874 --> 01:29:11.198]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:29:11.458 --> 01:29:12.579]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:12.839 --> 01:29:15.141]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:29:15.801 --> 01:29:22.326]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:29:22.526 --> 01:29:25.868]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:29:26.188 --> 01:29:27.990]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:37.040]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.041]  They know how great it is.
[01:29:38.962 --> 01:29:42.686]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:29:43.627 --> 01:29:45.048]  Tropic means for the brain.
[01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:53.690]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:29:54.130 --> 01:29:59.792]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:30:05.174 --> 01:30:05.594]  That comes to $50.03.
[01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:09.775]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:30:10.175 --> 01:30:13.336]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:30:13.376 --> 01:30:14.317]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:16.217]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:22.819 --> 01:30:27.422]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:30:27.562 --> 01:30:42.291]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus, or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get...

[01:31:02.408 --> 01:31:21.018]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:31:21.738 --> 01:31:27.065]  And we're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:31:27.426 --> 01:31:36.297]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:31:36.838 --> 01:31:37.478]  Concentrate.
[01:31:37.498 --> 01:31:39.280]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.961]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:31:40.981 --> 01:31:42.822]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:31:43.242 --> 01:31:44.102]  It's incredible.
[01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:46.504]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:31:46.684 --> 01:31:48.625]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[01:31:48.705 --> 01:31:49.185]  Incredible.
[01:31:49.506 --> 01:31:50.406]  It is amazing.
[01:31:50.746 --> 01:31:52.027]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:55.129]  50% off Caveman, but only a few days left.
[01:31:55.389 --> 01:31:56.169]  It's about to end.
[01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:59.051]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:31:59.511 --> 01:32:00.432]  We're the tip of the spear
[01:32:00.632 --> 01:32:01.552]  Because we're fearless.
[01:32:01.832 --> 01:32:02.553]  We're bold.
[01:32:03.073 --> 01:32:04.673]  Because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:32:05.093 --> 01:32:05.753]  The globalists win.
[01:32:05.773 --> 01:32:06.493]  We're all slaves.
[01:32:06.734 --> 01:32:07.894]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:32:08.274 --> 01:32:09.074]  I want to thank you.
[01:32:09.414 --> 01:32:10.474]  We're all in this together.
[01:32:10.995 --> 01:32:20.877]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:32:21.617 --> 01:32:25.059]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:32:25.279 --> 01:32:27.101]  But these specials have got to end.
[01:32:27.121 --> 01:32:37.027]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:32:37.307 --> 01:32:42.651]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:32:43.131 --> 01:32:47.774]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[01:32:48.414 --> 01:32:56.060]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:32:56.401 --> 01:33:01.224]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:33:05.768 --> 01:33:08.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.118 --> 01:33:37.219]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:37.619 --> 01:33:39.159]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.379 --> 01:33:50.441]  When I tell you, after President Trump, we are the number one target of the globalists, it's not bragging.
[01:33:52.282 --> 01:33:54.162]  In many respects, I'm whistling past the graveyard.
[01:33:55.382 --> 01:33:56.502]  But I wouldn't have it any other way.
[01:33:58.583 --> 01:33:59.703]  In fact, my greatest
[01:34:02.213 --> 01:34:03.293]  Possession in my life.
[01:34:03.533 --> 01:34:04.734]  It's my children I don't possess.
[01:34:04.774 --> 01:34:05.554]  They're free souls.
[01:34:05.994 --> 01:34:07.254]  They're the most important thing in my life.
[01:34:08.215 --> 01:34:09.235]  My greatest laurel.
[01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:10.715]  It's not a red carpet.
[01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:14.156]  It's not stupid Hollywood glitter bugs thinking I'm cool.
[01:34:14.556 --> 01:34:15.376]  God, I'd hate that.
[01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:17.917]  It's who my enemies are.
[01:34:17.937 --> 01:34:20.658]  I like it.
[01:34:22.218 --> 01:34:22.638]  I like it.
[01:34:24.599 --> 01:34:25.659]  So I'm gonna ram heads with them.
[01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:31.328]  I know there are a bunch of pot-bellied, pedophile, devil worshippers come, and I'm not scared of them.
[01:34:31.348 --> 01:34:35.211]  I'm not scared of what they do to me or anybody else, because I'm going to run them over.
[01:34:35.951 --> 01:34:38.373]  And if I get destroyed in the process, it's the way it is.
[01:34:38.854 --> 01:34:39.974]  I get off work early that way.
[01:34:39.994 --> 01:34:41.996]  I'm not afraid to die.
[01:34:43.297 --> 01:34:43.997]  I don't want to die.
[01:34:45.118 --> 01:34:45.719]  I got flesh.
[01:34:45.939 --> 01:34:46.459]  I like living.
[01:34:46.999 --> 01:34:47.500]  I like eating.
[01:34:48.741 --> 01:34:49.601]  I like having a normal life.
[01:34:50.782 --> 01:34:52.644]  But I'm not going to let a bunch of devil worshippers run my life.
[01:34:53.844 --> 01:34:54.405]  They want to kill me.
[01:34:56.852 --> 01:34:57.412]  Feel their hand.
[01:34:58.313 --> 01:35:00.114]  That's what they can't stand, is I'm not afraid to die.
[01:35:01.414 --> 01:35:02.935]  It's not some macho expression.
[01:35:03.495 --> 01:35:04.216]  It's the opposite.
[01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:06.597]  It's knowing how bad they are.
[01:35:06.617 --> 01:35:07.517]  I don't want to be with them.
[01:35:08.298 --> 01:35:12.000]  In fact, I'm fearless because I fear being with them.
[01:35:14.101 --> 01:35:17.722]  Fear drives me into fearlessness.
[01:35:20.684 --> 01:35:24.466]  Can you imagine groveling at the feet of a big fat pedophile in Hollywood?
[01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.449]  You know, it's coming out, the British Prime Minister, 10 years after we told you.
[01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:33.471]  Slit little girls' throats.
[01:35:35.191 --> 01:35:37.392]  You think I'm just gonna say that if we don't have the sources?
[01:35:41.054 --> 01:35:54.180]  You think I could get up here on air, in this universe, and speak things that evil people can barely get away with, and say them publicly and not be destroyed if it was a lie?
[01:35:56.215 --> 01:35:57.936]  I've not been destroyed because it's the truth.
[01:36:00.997 --> 01:36:01.898]  And I'm willing to die.
[01:36:01.918 --> 01:36:05.560]  It's a key alchemy there.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.220]  You've got to have the truth.
[01:36:08.281 --> 01:36:11.282]  You've got to be willing to die and lose everything you've got.
[01:36:12.783 --> 01:36:14.704]  And only then can you go through the fire.
[01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:21.847]  And believe me, if this amount of pressure had been put on me 22 years ago, when I first went on air, I couldn't have handled it.
[01:36:22.308 --> 01:36:24.809]  Now, I have seen God's design.
[01:36:29.508 --> 01:36:35.829]  Through not just me, but countless other people preparing everybody incrementally for the weight that's going to be put on us.
[01:36:37.150 --> 01:36:43.351]  So that when we get to that point of real face-to-face contest with the enemy, which we've now reached, we're ready.
[01:36:45.551 --> 01:36:49.132]  No longer the learner, but now the master.
[01:36:52.093 --> 01:36:54.613]  And of course the master knows that he's a learner.
[01:36:56.534 --> 01:36:58.154]  The learner believes he's already the master.
[01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:22.739]  That's why you see Project Veritas there with the New York Times main liaison to YouTube and you know I had private agreements with YouTube and I don't violate private agreements but I've talked about this before as far as I can go.
[01:37:23.499 --> 01:37:27.321]  YouTube told me leave us alone and we'll make you number one.
[01:37:29.422 --> 01:37:31.383]  Did you just think that was me trying to sound big on here?
[01:37:32.984 --> 01:37:33.424]  Facebook!
[01:37:36.943 --> 01:37:50.354]  Told me, three years ago, you leave us alone, we'll let you have access to the 35 million real people that have liked your page.
[01:37:51.636 --> 01:37:52.536]  Not the million and a half.
[01:37:54.358 --> 01:38:01.264]  Ted Nugent, just on the air going, I used to have 20-something million, now it's 2 million, but I know that sometimes 20-something million people like my thing.
[01:38:01.484 --> 01:38:02.465]  Yeah, Ted, I remember.
[01:38:05.230 --> 01:38:06.091]  You talk on the phone sometimes.
[01:38:06.111 --> 01:38:08.413]  I said, Ted, I remember seeing 22 million on there.
[01:38:10.475 --> 01:38:12.417]  The point is, of course people like Ted Nugent.
[01:38:13.278 --> 01:38:14.218]  Of course we're winning.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.462]  They're not going to let us have the brass ring.
[01:38:18.683 --> 01:38:21.025]  It's like Joe Rogan.
[01:38:21.065 --> 01:38:26.110]  I go on his show and he calls me the next day and he goes, yeah, they always upload and they put the name up.
[01:38:27.411 --> 01:38:29.092]  It's usually in the top 20 podcasts of the day.
[01:38:29.773 --> 01:38:30.354]  The numbers.
[01:38:31.764 --> 01:38:35.065]  Show, it's number one on these other platforms, but they're not letting it go up.
[01:38:36.326 --> 01:38:38.887]  It says uploaded, but somebody held it.
[01:38:41.308 --> 01:38:45.129]  And then there was an uproar, so they put it out, but hid it where nobody else could see it.
[01:38:45.729 --> 01:38:54.933]  Only people that looked, and then it was still the number one podcast, long form, it's something, you know, five minutes long, they'd have more, that they've ever had.
[01:38:55.193 --> 01:38:58.114]  All total, it's like 40-something million last time I checked.
[01:39:06.348 --> 01:39:08.108]  And then, of course, people get the word.
[01:39:08.168 --> 01:39:10.509]  It's like, I can't have you back on right now, Alex.
[01:39:10.809 --> 01:39:11.309]  Which is fine.
[01:39:11.329 --> 01:39:12.149]  I've got my own platform.
[01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:15.870]  But see, you'd think, oh, you'd want the biggest podcast again, right?
[01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:17.270]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:21.591]  You don't win the Indy 500 in this world and get put back on.
[01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:23.372]  They go, oh, I'm sorry, you can't race again.
[01:39:24.172 --> 01:39:26.312]  You don't score the touchdown in the Super Bowl.
[01:39:26.652 --> 01:39:27.852]  You get fired for that.
[01:39:29.893 --> 01:39:34.774]  You don't win and dominate and get put forward in America under the globalist control.
[01:39:37.495 --> 01:39:39.977]  If you're not going along with their whole game, of course that's true.
[01:39:41.719 --> 01:39:47.504]  But it's invaluable because in court, I can get into stuff that I told YouTube I wouldn't talk about publicly.
[01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:52.589]  And you don't just think I recorded Megyn Kelly.
[01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.851]  And by recorded, I just have the emails.
[01:39:56.052 --> 01:40:02.919]  They put us in touch with the vice president of YouTube, all this stuff, work with us, but just be nice, Alex.
[01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:06.930]  And then when I wasn't nice, they said, well, you saw what you could do.
[01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:08.191]  We unleashed you for a while.
[01:40:08.491 --> 01:40:09.511]  We're gonna put you back on a leash.
[01:40:09.771 --> 01:40:10.432]  It's the same thing.
[01:40:10.452 --> 01:40:12.873]  People like, hey, you be nice to Facebook.
[01:40:15.974 --> 01:40:18.975]  And we're gonna let you actually have access to your fans.
[01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.897]  And it's gonna be big and you're gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars, Alex.
[01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:30.012]  But I don't want to have access to them posing as a fake conservative like Fox News.
[01:40:31.213 --> 01:40:40.417]  I don't want the biggest jet on the tarmac and the best trophy wife and walking around like, oh yeah, the private island with a bunch of other mummies.
[01:40:41.737 --> 01:40:43.098]  And when half of them are pedophiles.
[01:40:43.858 --> 01:40:46.439]  No, I don't want to have sex with ten-year-old girls.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.041]  No, I don't want to devil worship and decide I'm a god.
[01:40:50.521 --> 01:40:52.722]  I do not want what you're offering.
[01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:54.763]  I want
[01:40:56.442 --> 01:40:58.343]  To squeeze your neck until your eyeballs pop out.
[01:40:58.923 --> 01:40:59.463]  Metaphysically.
[01:41:00.203 --> 01:41:01.123]  I want to destroy you.
[01:41:01.544 --> 01:41:02.044]  That's what I want.
[01:41:02.964 --> 01:41:05.725]  The globalists always ask, in the past, what do you want?
[01:41:05.745 --> 01:41:07.465]  I want to destroy you.
[01:41:09.206 --> 01:41:10.186]  Because you want to destroy me.
[01:41:11.326 --> 01:41:24.010]  You want to overthrow everything good, you want to hurt children, you want to brain damage people, you want to force fetus GMO, and all the rest of the garbage, and you know the fluoride and the vaccines, lower IQ, 30 plus points, together, and you're the enemy!
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:26.071]  How would I not oppose that?
[01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:35.612]  It'd be like if I was a mouse, and they said, help us feed all the other mice into a meat grinder, and then we'll throw you into the meat grinder after.
[01:41:35.652 --> 01:41:36.613]  I'd say, I'm a mouse.
[01:41:37.073 --> 01:41:39.854]  I'm not going to throw my other mice.
[01:41:39.874 --> 01:41:41.994]  And the reason I use that example, I'm not a mouse.
[01:41:42.094 --> 01:41:42.795]  I'm a man.
[01:41:44.095 --> 01:41:45.355]  Mice would run from this.
[01:41:46.596 --> 01:41:48.356]  People say, boy, you're sure fighting.
[01:41:48.376 --> 01:41:49.137]  You sure got courage.
[01:41:49.877 --> 01:41:52.378]  Folks, in this, running is fighting.
[01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.414]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:41:55.114 --> 01:41:55.754]  We're cornered.
[01:41:56.735 --> 01:41:58.676]  There's no getting out of this alive unless we fight them.
[01:41:58.856 --> 01:41:59.697]  You figure that out yet?
[01:42:01.197 --> 01:42:04.019]  And it's that basic human instinct that they hate.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.900]  That I'm not scared.
[01:42:06.861 --> 01:42:08.081]  I'm only scared of them winning.
[01:42:08.982 --> 01:42:10.243]  I'm only scared of rolling over.
[01:42:11.103 --> 01:42:14.085]  I'm only scared of them standing in the way of what our species can do together.
[01:42:16.058 --> 01:42:18.561]  So don't ever call this show and thank me for what I've done.
[01:42:19.302 --> 01:42:19.802]  Thank me?
[01:42:20.663 --> 01:42:22.946]  For not wanting to see all of us fed into a meat grinder?
[01:42:24.188 --> 01:42:26.510]  It's not special to want to fight these people.
[01:42:27.111 --> 01:42:27.892]  It's default.
[01:42:30.615 --> 01:42:33.519]  It's not something you get an award for.
[01:42:33.899 --> 01:42:36.222]  The reward is the future for your children.
[01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:47.875]  I just have to cool my afterburners and not exude all of my energy now against the enemy.
[01:42:48.915 --> 01:42:52.037]  I've got to slowly lean up against them and strangle them.
[01:42:53.438 --> 01:42:55.419]  And to do that, I need your prayers and support.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.663]  But make no mistake, just as you just heard on that secret tape, InfoWars is the enemy.
[01:43:02.464 --> 01:43:04.025]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:43:05.273 --> 01:43:10.616]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:43:10.876 --> 01:43:11.997]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:12.257 --> 01:43:14.559]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:15.219 --> 01:43:21.723]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:21.943 --> 01:43:25.265]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:43:25.586 --> 01:43:27.387]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:43:28.047 --> 01:43:36.456]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:43:36.497 --> 01:43:37.438]  They know how great it is.
[01:43:38.359 --> 01:43:42.163]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:43:42.984 --> 01:43:44.425]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:43:45.246 --> 01:43:53.112]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:53.552 --> 01:44:02.038]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:44:02.598 --> 01:44:05.020]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:09.203]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:44:09.623 --> 01:44:12.586]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:44:14.927 --> 01:44:15.787]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:44:16.127 --> 01:44:27.651]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:44:27.891 --> 01:44:41.716]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get
[01:44:42.970 --> 01:44:47.416]  To support the information war and get really high quality products.
[01:44:47.436 --> 01:44:50.500]  When you sign up for AutoShip, you always get 10% off.
[01:44:50.761 --> 01:44:55.727]  And there's free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLive.com.

[01:44:59.412 --> 01:45:02.395]  Again, that's infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:02.655 --> 01:45:20.430]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:45:21.150 --> 01:45:26.498]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:45:26.859 --> 01:45:35.711]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:45:36.252 --> 01:45:36.892]  Concentrate.
[01:45:36.932 --> 01:45:38.713]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:45:38.973 --> 01:45:40.394]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:45:40.614 --> 01:45:42.254]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:45:42.654 --> 01:45:43.515]  It's incredible.
[01:45:43.995 --> 01:45:45.915]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:45:46.096 --> 01:45:47.256]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:45:47.696 --> 01:45:48.616]  At 15, incredible.
[01:45:48.937 --> 01:45:49.817]  It is amazing.
[01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.437]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:52.998]  50% off Caveman.
[01:45:53.218 --> 01:45:54.539]  But only a few days left.
[01:45:54.799 --> 01:45:55.539]  It's about to end.
[01:45:56.139 --> 01:45:58.480]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:04.082]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:46:04.502 --> 01:46:05.903]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:46:06.143 --> 01:46:07.303]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:46:07.703 --> 01:46:08.504]  I want to thank you.
[01:46:08.824 --> 01:46:09.884]  We're all in this together.
[01:46:10.404 --> 01:46:20.288]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:46:21.028 --> 01:46:24.471]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:26.513]  But these specials have got to end.
[01:46:26.533 --> 01:46:36.441]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:46:36.722 --> 01:46:42.066]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:46:42.547 --> 01:46:47.191]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[01:46:47.831 --> 01:46:55.479]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:55.819 --> 01:47:00.644]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:47:05.288 --> 01:47:07.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.361 --> 01:47:21.369]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:23.955 --> 01:47:27.863]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:47:35.456 --> 01:47:44.298]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:45.438 --> 01:47:51.679]  Again, America and the world was sleeping under the parasite of the satanic globalist pedophile system.
[01:47:53.479 --> 01:47:56.500]  Once you awaken, you'll see everything I've seen and more.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.520]  That's why the enemy's so scared.
[01:48:01.881 --> 01:48:03.841]  Their entire house of cards is falling,
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:10.621]  We are now gaining on them every day, even though we were way behind.
[01:48:12.021 --> 01:48:18.343]  The enemy is throwing out every technique they can to try to drive you back into submission, but it's not working.
[01:48:20.243 --> 01:48:26.725]  All I can tell you is, as good as The Awakening is, the enemy is going to strike back in a very bloody way.
[01:48:26.885 --> 01:48:32.746]  And I haven't gotten into this yet, but I'm going to get into it more later in the next hour and open the phones up as well.
[01:48:37.523 --> 01:48:44.726]  You have to understand they can compartmentalize people in the military or in law enforcement just as much as they can compartmentalize you in the company you work in.
[01:48:45.506 --> 01:48:46.866]  Do you know what's going on in accounting?
[01:48:47.407 --> 01:48:49.207]  Do they know what's going on in maintenance?
[01:48:49.247 --> 01:48:54.169]  Do they know what's going on in lawn care, whatever it is your main business is?
[01:48:55.150 --> 01:48:57.570]  Pool care, radio, TV, I mean whatever it is.
[01:48:58.191 --> 01:49:01.132]  Think of the compartmentalization in your life with your husband or your wife.
[01:49:02.008 --> 01:49:05.616]  You're not hiding stuff from the other one, it's just that somebody handles this, somebody handles that.
[01:49:05.997 --> 01:49:08.482]  You try to know everything they're doing, you'd spend all your time.
[01:49:10.424 --> 01:49:22.450]  So, when we look at Vegas, I'm not defending the Sheriff's Department, or the police, or FBI, but it's the FBI and local police that have given us the truth, before anybody else did, that there was a lie.
[01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:29.953]  Now, mainstream media's spinning it, the Sheriff's Department lied, and it was police response time, that's why they lied.
[01:49:30.513 --> 01:49:32.574]  There were shootouts all over the city.
[01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:35.356]  There were multiple terrorist teams.
[01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:37.497]  The police got several of them.
[01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:39.692]  Now it's under national security.
[01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:40.833]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[01:49:41.193 --> 01:49:42.834]  The people involved are trying to figure it out.
[01:49:45.816 --> 01:49:52.801]  But, again, when I get in here in an exercise of saying it's not all the police, I'm not doing that as some virtue signaling thing.
[01:49:53.842 --> 01:49:55.763]  It's that they're compartmentalized just like we are.
[01:49:56.163 --> 01:49:57.724]  We knew what really happened.
[01:49:58.405 --> 01:50:03.829]  We knew the first questions because of local police, local citizens, and the FBI.
[01:50:05.725 --> 01:50:08.926]  They go, wait a minute Alex, you're sending the FBI guy over, it's a bad guy.
[01:50:09.226 --> 01:50:11.907]  We have that from multiple federal sources, some on air.
[01:50:12.428 --> 01:50:13.728]  I'm surprised Craig Sawyer said it on air.
[01:50:14.008 --> 01:50:15.229]  I heard the same stuff from other people.
[01:50:15.749 --> 01:50:17.870]  But he named the guy that's an Obama creature.
[01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:21.971]  Back from the Clinton days, but under Obama, really got nasty.
[01:50:22.871 --> 01:50:25.692]  So, they don't know everything.
[01:50:26.373 --> 01:50:28.353]  They just know he had Islamic material.
[01:50:29.114 --> 01:50:30.334]  They just know he had anti-feminist material.
[01:50:30.614 --> 01:50:32.775]  They said, no Alex, and I kept saying, she?
[01:50:33.095 --> 01:50:34.876]  They said there was Islamic notes in the house.
[01:50:36.075 --> 01:50:39.996]  Or in the hotel room, and she'd traveled there.
[01:50:40.016 --> 01:50:42.397]  He's like, no, Alan, she's traveled there, him too.
[01:50:42.997 --> 01:50:45.238]  Came out later, a week later, he'd traveled there.
[01:50:46.138 --> 01:50:50.099]  So, it doesn't mean we have all the answers, or I have them all.
[01:50:50.379 --> 01:50:53.700]  It means we're being lied to about what happened here.
[01:50:58.141 --> 01:51:03.263]  So, the casino is acting very, very suspicious right now and trying to blame the police.
[01:51:04.375 --> 01:51:13.123]  And if you look at the background of the casino and the leftist garbage, the George Soros connections, the Islamic connections, it's not the casino that was giving us tips about there being a cover-up.
[01:51:14.103 --> 01:51:14.964]  It was law enforcement.
[01:51:15.004 --> 01:51:16.285]  So, think about that.
[01:51:16.686 --> 01:51:19.708]  And they're the ones telling us there's a cover-up going on above it.
[01:51:20.509 --> 01:51:22.290]  Below Trump, but above them.
[01:51:22.791 --> 01:51:26.314]  It's at that high-level management level, right below the top people.
[01:51:26.834 --> 01:51:28.155]  And Trump's trying to clean it out, man.
[01:51:28.195 --> 01:51:28.876]  He's fired 13,000 people.
[01:51:30.794 --> 01:51:36.236]  But the lie to his face, the lie to his manager's face, it's an infiltration.
[01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:38.457]  This is an infiltration war.
[01:51:40.778 --> 01:51:44.439]  Now, he's been there for almost a week.
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:45.720]  He just got back last night.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.401]  And he's dutifully, without me telling him to, in here at his desk, working hard.
[01:51:49.882 --> 01:51:54.424]  One of our most intrepid in-the-field reporters and investigative journalists, videographers.
[01:51:54.524 --> 01:51:59.285]  Michael Zimmerman's going to be in the studio riding shotgun the whole next hour when we take your calls and get into other subjects.
[01:51:59.305 --> 01:52:00.326]  But he went to Puerto Rico.
[01:52:01.926 --> 01:52:07.389]  They landed there and they flew to other sub areas and they've been there and it's exactly what Trump said.
[01:52:07.409 --> 01:52:12.532]  The island was always infrastructure low.
[01:52:13.113 --> 01:52:14.314]  It always had a lot of corruption.
[01:52:14.334 --> 01:52:16.255]  You got 90 plus mayors that tell you things.
[01:52:16.275 --> 01:52:17.756]  They used to have like for three million people.
[01:52:19.738 --> 01:52:20.798]  Most Puerto Ricans live here.
[01:52:20.838 --> 01:52:21.378]  What's that tell you?
[01:52:21.679 --> 01:52:28.060]  Beautiful island, great culture, but, you know, it's like areas of East Texas or something, or podunk places.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:31.941]  I mean, they just, it's, because it gets hit by hurricanes all the time.
[01:52:32.221 --> 01:52:34.522]  Why should you put in a big expensive house or infrastructure?
[01:52:35.282 --> 01:52:37.343]  They get flattened every five years by a hurricane.
[01:52:39.643 --> 01:52:45.605]  The Caribbean's awesome, folks, but if you're riding those hurricane paths, it's, you know, it's got some issues.
[01:52:46.685 --> 01:52:48.886]  So, he's been there.
[01:52:50.376 --> 01:52:52.799]  The Democrats are 100% sitting on their hands.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:52.799]  100%.
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.842]  He's got all the video and more.
[01:52:55.143 --> 01:52:56.284]  Let's start the next hour.
[01:52:56.304 --> 01:52:59.068]  I've got a lot of the clubs I want to get to.
[01:52:59.208 --> 01:53:07.300]  I've got all the cover up by the mainstream media and all these nasty... Notice I singled out Matt Damon, Ben Affleck,
[01:53:08.686 --> 01:53:11.187]  George Clooney as the slimiest of the slimers.
[01:53:11.767 --> 01:53:15.608]  Because I know folks that know him, and I've been around them a few times.
[01:53:16.568 --> 01:53:17.768]  And I'm not proud of that, by the way.
[01:53:17.788 --> 01:53:18.769]  It's not like, oh, I've been around them.
[01:53:18.829 --> 01:53:21.449]  I mean, yeah, I've been around Hollywood, and I got out of it real quick.
[01:53:22.050 --> 01:53:25.090]  I sure went and checked it out for a few years, just off and on.
[01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:27.271]  And it rolled out the red carpet, by the way.
[01:53:28.459 --> 01:53:30.701]  But it was not a carpet that I wanted to follow.
[01:53:30.721 --> 01:53:36.946]  Kind of like the old Tom and Jerry cartoons where the tongue goes out and it looks like a hotel or a nightclub, but it's really the cat's mouth.
[01:53:37.446 --> 01:53:38.427]  And the mouse is walking in.
[01:53:38.447 --> 01:53:41.269]  I was like, yeah, this looks like a mouth.
[01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:43.831]  I think I'll go back to Texas.
[01:53:44.531 --> 01:53:46.573]  My little Spidey sense is like pegged.
[01:53:46.673 --> 01:53:48.755]  Like, what are you doing?
[01:53:49.475 --> 01:53:50.376]  It wasn't even fear.
[01:53:50.416 --> 01:53:51.377]  It was like weakness.
[01:53:53.297 --> 01:53:55.218]  It was, and I thought, well maybe that's just Hollywood.
[01:53:55.778 --> 01:53:57.559]  Then I'd be a few other places around the country.
[01:53:57.939 --> 01:54:00.760]  Feel great till I went into a room with them.
[01:54:01.661 --> 01:54:04.242]  And then I felt again like, whoa!
[01:54:04.262 --> 01:54:07.123]  This is like being in hell, man.
[01:54:07.223 --> 01:54:11.085]  My spirit is like punishing me.
[01:54:11.905 --> 01:54:13.506]  Get away from these people.
[01:54:16.027 --> 01:54:21.850]  But I can be in the middle of some little poor town in Georgia.
[01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:26.619]  Fishing with some old blind man on the edge of a river.
[01:54:27.519 --> 01:54:28.760]  My soul feels real good.
[01:54:31.022 --> 01:54:35.966]  But if I'm in Hollywood or anywhere around it, man, my spirit tells me, man, this is empty.
[01:54:36.007 --> 01:54:39.610]  This isn't like power that wants to control you or dominate you.
[01:54:40.851 --> 01:54:44.574]  Kind of like barbaric male energy that has a hint of Satanism, but it really isn't.
[01:54:45.134 --> 01:54:45.755]  It's just twisted.
[01:54:46.135 --> 01:54:49.438]  That's the energy that gets me excited and angry, and that's the one that really tempts me.
[01:54:51.004 --> 01:54:56.348]  The conquest, resistance, war, domination against worthy opponents.
[01:54:59.250 --> 01:55:00.851]  Hollywood, it's like soullessness.
[01:55:00.911 --> 01:55:01.671]  It's emptiness.
[01:55:01.771 --> 01:55:05.394]  It's like a betrayal.
[01:55:06.434 --> 01:55:07.715]  It's pure Satanism.
[01:55:09.076 --> 01:55:09.857]  So that's coming up.
[01:55:11.438 --> 01:55:12.699]  But before I go any further,
[01:55:13.866 --> 01:55:22.253]  As you know, you built InfoWars, and they're trying to censor us on every platform out there, but we have found ways around it.
[01:55:22.493 --> 01:55:23.554]  I'm not going to get into how we do it.
[01:55:24.134 --> 01:55:25.315]  I've talked about some of it already today.
[01:55:27.177 --> 01:55:35.123]  They want to censor us out of existence so they can say, Alex Jones is a liar, George Soros fought the Nazis at the Battle of the Bulls with General Patton.
[01:55:35.844 --> 01:55:37.025]  CNN said that last night.
[01:55:37.045 --> 01:55:40.607]  They said, Soros was a victim and battled Nazis valiantly.
[01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:44.312]  He stood beside Captain America in the front lines.
[01:55:44.372 --> 01:55:46.053]  I mean, they almost went that far.
[01:55:46.594 --> 01:55:50.497]  When we had the videos of him admitting the whole deal, and I'm going to try to play more of that next hour.
[01:55:51.237 --> 01:55:53.459]  CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros Nazi ties.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:56:00.004]  That's the article where you can see the full 12 and a half minute, 60 minutes, where he says, I'm quite proud of what I've done.
[01:56:00.304 --> 01:56:02.065]  It's just total Count Dracula stuff.
[01:56:03.346 --> 01:56:05.228]  But if you financially support us,
[01:56:06.542 --> 01:56:29.250]  Symbiotically getting water filters, air filters, shirts that spread the word, Molon Labe, CNN's fake news, to meet like-minded folks, the nutraceuticals, the supplements, our high-quality essential oils from Nature's brand that's now Emmerich's Essentials, so that you can get that at a discount of 25 to 50% off leading brands that aren't even as strong or good as ours.
[01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:30.131]  I mean, it really is the best.
[01:56:31.331 --> 01:56:32.872]  50% off Brain Force Plus right now.
[01:56:32.892 --> 01:56:36.753]  40% off Biotru Selenium and Survival Shield X2.
[01:56:37.213 --> 01:56:39.274]  True atomic nascent iodine.
[01:56:40.274 --> 01:56:42.375]  That's why ours turns blue on paper with water, not red.
[01:56:42.975 --> 01:56:44.696]  Because it really is pure iodine.
[01:56:45.136 --> 01:56:46.556]  Real iodine is a purple-blue crystal.
[01:56:46.916 --> 01:56:52.218]  It turns red in oxygen, but then when it's put in a little bit of water and in oxygen, it turns blue.
[01:56:53.198 --> 01:56:55.039]  Because the gas starts coming out of it.
[01:56:55.419 --> 01:56:56.499]  And that's the good halogen.
[01:56:56.519 --> 01:56:57.800]  They bombard you with the bad halogens.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.560]  Experience it for yourself.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.741]  Consult a physician, obviously, because X2 is the real deal.

[01:57:07.342 --> 01:57:09.342]  Thousands of reviews, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:57:13.744 --> 01:57:14.384]  Blow that back up.

[01:58:19.775 --> 01:58:27.357]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[01:58:27.537 --> 01:58:34.459]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.

[01:59:32.372 --> 01:59:38.797]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.

[01:59:54.270 --> 02:00:00.155]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.442 --> 02:00:10.906]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood is crumbling.
[02:00:10.986 --> 02:00:12.068]  Babylon is falling.
[02:00:12.128 --> 02:00:12.588]  Rejoice!
[02:00:13.547 --> 02:00:28.973]  The hypocrisy of Hollywood is on full display as the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues to grow, as more victims continue to come forward, and as more clips of Hollywood stars continue to surface, showing them engaging in, well, shall we say, similar behavior.
[02:00:29.253 --> 02:00:38.316]  CNN calls Jimmy Kimmel America's conscience, and here's America's conscience enticing young girls into groping his crotch for a chance to be on television.
[02:00:38.516 --> 02:00:41.478]  This game show is called Guess What's In My Pants.
[02:00:41.618 --> 02:00:47.543]  Now, I've stuffed something in my pants, and you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants.
[02:00:47.583 --> 02:00:52.186]  You have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants.
[02:00:52.807 --> 02:00:53.287]  You ready?
[02:00:53.307 --> 02:00:54.488]  Set.
[02:00:55.029 --> 02:00:55.189]  Go.
[02:00:57.433 --> 02:00:58.614]  You should use two hands.
[02:00:58.794 --> 02:00:59.195]  Two hands.
[02:00:59.255 --> 02:01:02.797]  I thought it was like a Red Bull or something.
[02:01:03.338 --> 02:01:05.199]  You think it's... Is that your final answer?
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:06.300]  Wow.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:07.701]  Jesus.
[02:01:07.981 --> 02:01:10.944]  You're gonna make a fine wife.
[02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:23.156]  He continues the skit with a variety of different fame whores who are all willing to humiliate themselves for a chance to be on television, which in Los Angeles come in an almost unlimited supply.
[02:01:23.176 --> 02:01:26.819]  One of which is so young-looking that he's concerned that he may be breaking the law.
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.681]  You work on a farm, haven't you?
[02:01:28.701 --> 02:01:31.084]  How old are you?
[02:01:31.104 --> 02:01:31.084]  18.
[02:01:31.244 --> 02:01:32.425]  Okay, you sure of that?
[02:01:32.645 --> 02:01:35.969]  Because Uncle Jimmy doesn't need to do time.
[02:01:37.907 --> 02:01:38.968]  It's not gonna bite you!
[02:01:39.128 --> 02:01:40.469]  Well, nothing unusual there, I guess.
[02:01:40.509 --> 02:01:46.795]  Just another late-night Hollywood talk show host who regularly uses his show to promote Hollywood propaganda and poison the minds of millions.
[02:01:46.995 --> 02:01:54.101]  Here's Ben Affleck, who's worked very closely with Harvey Weinstein over the course of his career on a variety of different films, and apparently he's learned quite a bit from him.
[02:01:54.362 --> 02:02:00.367]  Because here he is, groping and apparently sexually harassing this woman who's trying to interview him about one of his films.
[02:02:00.667 --> 02:02:02.349]  Well, you usually show a lot more cleavage than this.
[02:02:02.389 --> 02:02:03.550]  What's the secret to the story?
[02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:04.991]  Why are you covering it up today?
[02:02:05.191 --> 02:02:06.391]  Well, it's Sunday morning.
[02:02:06.492 --> 02:02:07.612]  It's Sunday morning?
[02:02:07.732 --> 02:02:08.892]  I've never slept before.
[02:02:08.912 --> 02:02:10.133]  I'm getting the titties out.
[02:02:10.573 --> 02:02:12.774]  I don't think you're trying to pull Sunday morning.
[02:02:13.234 --> 02:02:15.095]  By the way, this is when he was dating Jennifer Lopez.
[02:02:15.295 --> 02:02:17.636]  This is how Hollywood people roll when they're in a relationship.
[02:02:17.796 --> 02:02:19.476]  No wonder Hollywood marriages never last.
[02:02:19.736 --> 02:02:21.137]  And then there's this guy, Ed Asner.
[02:02:21.397 --> 02:02:29.263]  Who was on a show in the 1970s called The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which was about a woman who decided not to get married and not have kids, but instead pursue her career.
[02:02:29.643 --> 02:02:33.506]  A show which was celebrated by all the liberals and the feminists as groundbreaking.
[02:02:33.826 --> 02:02:43.713]  And here he is on MSNBC yesterday, talking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and sexism in Hollywood, when he started the interview off by saying this!
[02:02:44.193 --> 02:02:46.655]  Ed Asner, wow, it's great to have you here.
[02:02:46.715 --> 02:02:47.976]  Thank you so much for coming in.
[02:02:48.136 --> 02:02:49.918]  Thank you, and not even a kiss.
[02:02:50.856 --> 02:02:51.697]  No, nothing, right?
[02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.737]  Oh my god.
[02:02:53.378 --> 02:02:56.479]  This is, this is... Okay, this is totally bizarre!
[02:02:56.679 --> 02:03:02.483]  You're on the show talking about sexism in Hollywood, and here you're pestering the interviewer to give you a kiss?!
[02:03:02.723 --> 02:03:03.844]  That wasn't the end of the weirdness.
[02:03:03.884 --> 02:03:14.430]  They went on to talk about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and then he blamed President Trump for creating a climate in the country that enables people like him, and then when they wrapped up the interview, he said this!
[02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:17.791]  Ed Asner, the book is The Grouchy Historian.
[02:03:18.631 --> 02:03:19.451]  Long time fan.
[02:03:19.511 --> 02:03:21.272]  Thank you so much for coming on the program.
[02:03:21.612 --> 02:03:22.352]  Good luck with the book.
[02:03:22.392 --> 02:03:23.452]  You still owe me a kiss.
[02:03:24.853 --> 02:03:26.633]  Okay, you're gonna get yourself in trouble.
[02:03:27.353 --> 02:03:28.213]  And with good reason.
[02:03:28.233 --> 02:03:29.514]  No, no, no.
[02:03:29.914 --> 02:03:31.034]  I'm not the job, huh?
[02:03:31.494 --> 02:03:33.075]  I'm not a job procurer.
[02:03:33.875 --> 02:03:34.315]  Thank you.
[02:03:34.455 --> 02:03:35.495]  What an absolute creep!
[02:03:35.695 --> 02:03:37.356]  This guy even looks like Harvey Weinstein.
[02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:39.976]  Look at that, he's got that same one squinty eye.
[02:03:39.996 --> 02:03:42.357]  Maybe they're just both possessed by similar demons.
[02:03:42.677 --> 02:03:49.779]  While there are more people denouncing Harvey Weinstein every day, from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama, not everybody is ready to write him off just yet.
[02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:58.342]  Lindsay Lohan, who is apparently not dead from a drug overdose, posted this video on her Instagram telling everybody to leave Harvey alone.
[02:03:58.362 --> 02:04:00.203]  Hi, this is Lindsay Lohan.
[02:04:00.383 --> 02:04:03.083]  Hi, I'm in Dubai.
[02:04:03.644 --> 02:04:04.044]  I'm home.
[02:04:05.410 --> 02:04:07.271]  I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.
[02:04:07.291 --> 02:04:08.472]  I don't think it's right what's going on.
[02:04:08.512 --> 02:04:10.133]  It's not right what's going on, she says.
[02:04:10.273 --> 02:04:11.894]  To him, he's the victim here.
[02:04:12.334 --> 02:04:14.155]  I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.
[02:04:14.175 --> 02:04:15.436]  I don't think it's right what's going on.
[02:04:17.437 --> 02:04:19.958]  I think Georgina needs to take a stand and be a good husband.
[02:04:19.978 --> 02:04:21.119]  She lives in Dubai, of course.
[02:04:21.199 --> 02:04:22.880]  And she's never harmed me in anything.
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.241]  Eminem is like, yeah, well you Trump, I love Islam.
[02:04:26.082 --> 02:04:27.502]  And so I think everyone needs to stop.
[02:04:27.863 --> 02:04:28.503]  I think it's wrong.
[02:04:29.443 --> 02:04:30.064]  So stand up.
[02:04:31.701 --> 02:04:32.461]  That really is her.
[02:04:32.541 --> 02:04:35.242]  I know it sounds like she has an accent there, but that is Lindsay Lohan.
[02:04:35.622 --> 02:04:40.583]  Apparently she's just stuck in character, unable to differentiate from reality at this point.
[02:04:40.883 --> 02:04:43.423]  It gets so much more disgusting, I don't even like talking about it.
[02:04:43.683 --> 02:04:50.205]  Check my previous video yesterday to see Hollywood A-listers, including Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, literally giving a standing ovation.
[02:04:50.245 --> 02:04:53.065]  Yeah, and the idiocracy president, the pariahs that grabbed his leeway.
[02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:54.065]  They'll be back, folks.
[02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:58.623]  We'll be back.
[02:04:58.663 --> 02:04:59.163]  Yeah, there's plants.
[02:04:59.183 --> 02:05:00.144]  He likes to rape little girls.
[02:05:00.184 --> 02:05:01.604]  That's okay, because the label says it's cool.
[02:05:03.605 --> 02:05:05.066]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:17.262]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:06:17.362 --> 02:06:19.123]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:06:21.288 --> 02:06:22.171]  You're not getting it.
[02:06:22.191 --> 02:06:26.647]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:35.913]  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Zimmerman just spent five, six days in Puerto Rico.
[02:06:36.233 --> 02:06:40.176]  And it wasn't at some armed resort where they got, you know, security guards protecting it.
[02:06:40.196 --> 02:06:41.397]  It was some rich neighborhood.
[02:06:41.437 --> 02:06:49.043]  It was in the poorest areas, riding with the 18-wheelers, going in, witnessing the unions ordering a stand down.
[02:06:49.544 --> 02:06:55.589]  But still, despite that, the 20% of the truck drivers working around the clock, many amazing hours a day, have gotten
[02:06:56.489 --> 02:07:09.681]  80% of the stores and gas stations open, power on in many areas, and our media just keeps lying, even though we've given more aid per capita than we've given to Houston, that's 10 million people metro, to Puerto Rico that's 3 million.
[02:07:09.701 --> 02:07:10.982]  And I'm all for helping Puerto Rico.
[02:07:11.002 --> 02:07:13.284]  In fact, I've talked to folks that go on vacation there.
[02:07:13.304 --> 02:07:15.586]  It's very low cost, very beautiful, they tell me.
[02:07:15.606 --> 02:07:17.647]  Don't want to go downtown at night, you'll get mugged.
[02:07:17.668 --> 02:07:19.189]  But other than that, it's a really nice country.
[02:07:20.110 --> 02:07:22.251]  And a lot of Puerto Ricans are listeners of the show.
[02:07:22.972 --> 02:07:30.617]  But we're going to get into the reality of what Michael Zimmerman with the great Gary Haven documented as part of the aid relief that we supported.
[02:07:31.578 --> 02:07:41.484]  Meanwhile, Hillary robbed the Philippines and, you know, robbed, you know, so many other countries like what happened in Haiti and robbed other countless other nations during disasters they, quote, oversaw.
[02:07:41.504 --> 02:07:44.406]  And she shakes her fish at Trump.
[02:07:44.666 --> 02:07:46.027]  It's not that I'm even defending Trump.
[02:07:46.127 --> 02:07:47.428]  I'm defending reality.
[02:07:47.848 --> 02:07:50.010]  So let's go ahead and go to Michael Zimmerman's report.
[02:07:51.374 --> 02:07:53.995]  This is Michael Zimmerman reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:07:54.575 --> 02:07:57.837]  On September 20th, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico.
[02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:02.519]  Now, 20 days later, the effects of the storm are still being felt by most of the island.
[02:08:03.382 --> 02:08:10.384]  This week, I traveled to Puerto Rico with Gary Haven and his wife Diane, who I had previously traveled with to Haiti to cover the damage after Hurricane Matthew.
[02:08:10.724 --> 02:08:13.345]  We're off to Puerto Rico right now.
[02:08:13.385 --> 02:08:18.667]  We're picking up a group of missionaries that need to assess the situation.
[02:08:18.687 --> 02:08:20.807]  They're working with over 2,000 churches there.
[02:08:21.087 --> 02:08:22.808]  And incidentally, they're working for the White House.
[02:08:23.428 --> 02:08:29.413]  And so we should have a really interesting day going to the island of Vieques, which is kind of isolated.
[02:08:29.914 --> 02:08:33.757]  They say the airport's closed, but we're going there anyway, so we'll find out.
[02:08:34.137 --> 02:08:37.360]  So let's have a great adventure and see if we can do some good out there.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:44.947]  We traveled to San Juan, where we picked up a pastor that is working with a network of over 2,000 churches across Puerto Rico and a former U.S.
[02:08:44.987 --> 02:08:48.409]  ambassador who led recovery efforts after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
[02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:56.494]  From San Juan, we flew to the remote island of Vieques, home to 9,000 people, in order to survey the damage and see where aid could best be used.
[02:08:57.334 --> 02:09:00.316]  What we saw in Vieques was similar to what we saw in the rest of Puerto Rico.
[02:09:01.216 --> 02:09:05.058]  There is lots of damage across the island, but residents, for the most part, have food and water.
[02:09:05.659 --> 02:09:11.462]  At this point, access to electricity is the main need, but not something that aid groups or individuals are able to help with.
[02:09:12.523 --> 02:09:19.952]  The mainstream media has spent the past 20 days attacking President Trump over his response to the disaster, blaming him for the current crisis on the island.
[02:09:21.013 --> 02:09:25.639]  But as InfoWars previously reported, the problem really lies with the distribution of aid across the island.
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:30.545]  Here's what Colonel Michael Valle, Commander of the Federal Relief Effort in Puerto Rico, had to say.
[02:09:32.426 --> 02:09:33.887]  The aid is getting to Puerto Rico.
[02:09:34.007 --> 02:09:35.267]  The problem is distribution.
[02:09:35.827 --> 02:09:37.668]  The federal government has sent us a lot of help.
[02:09:37.988 --> 02:09:41.469]  Moving these supplies, in particular fuel, is the issue right now.
[02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:45.131]  It's the lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18-wheelers.
[02:09:45.831 --> 02:09:46.651]  Supplies we have.
[02:09:47.252 --> 02:09:47.912]  Trucks we have.
[02:09:48.372 --> 02:09:51.453]  However, only 20% of the drivers show up to work.
[02:09:52.214 --> 02:09:55.395]  As a Puerto Rican, what happens here for the people is personal to me.
[02:09:56.395 --> 02:10:00.017]  To say we are not provided all of the help and resources needed is just not true.
[02:10:00.777 --> 02:10:03.898]  Distribution is the key, and we are working day and night on it.
[02:10:05.139 --> 02:10:07.380]  This matches what we observed while in Puerto Rico.
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:11.061]  The containers of aid are backed up at the ports and not making it to the people.
[02:10:11.942 --> 02:10:17.584]  Here's what InfoWare's contributor and Puerto Rican Ruben Obed had to say, who lives just 30 minutes from San Juan.
[02:10:18.934 --> 02:10:22.257]  I'm going to be really honest with you, and this you might not hear in the mainstream media.
[02:10:22.297 --> 02:10:25.399]  Here in Puerto Rico, there has always been an issue with truckers.
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:31.124]  You know, sometimes they paralyze the whole country because they want raises, because they want this and that.
[02:10:31.685 --> 02:10:40.412]  I don't know if that is what's going on, or maybe they're thinking, you know, let's put pressure and capitalize on this hurricane.
[02:10:40.692 --> 02:10:41.613]  That might be the case.
[02:10:41.813 --> 02:10:46.437]  I personally, I'm a Trump supporter, and I know for a fact that Trump has sent the help
[02:10:47.077 --> 02:10:53.523]  In a series of tweets, President Trump said they want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.
[02:10:53.543 --> 02:10:56.466]  10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job.
[02:10:57.247 --> 02:11:01.031]  Despite the many issues with FEMA, as we see with every disaster, Trump was right.
[02:11:01.611 --> 02:11:04.774]  Puerto Rico depends upon the community coming together to distribute aid.
[02:11:05.695 --> 02:11:10.240]  While traveling around the island, we saw cars on all major freeways and stores open everywhere.
[02:11:11.485 --> 02:11:22.808]  Democrats will continue to blame Trump for the problems in Puerto Rico, but thousands of men and women in the National Guard, FEMA, and other government agencies will continue to work around the clock to help with recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.
[02:11:23.869 --> 02:11:26.529]  This has been Michael Zimmerman for InfoWars.com.
[02:11:27.630 --> 02:11:30.891]  You know, CNN wonders why their average show has about 300,000 viewers an hour nationwide.
[02:11:33.587 --> 02:11:35.749]  And about that internationally, so 600,000 viewers.
[02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:45.157]  If they put something on like you just put on, three and a half minutes long, super HD video, all the experts, the truth of what's happening, that would have five million viewers in a show.
[02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:47.959]  But they just have to lie about everything.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:51.802]  And then they even have the teamsters on video bragging, oh, we're holding it all up.
[02:11:52.203 --> 02:11:54.625]  But despite that, everybody just went around them.
[02:11:55.005 --> 02:11:56.346]  Trump signed the order to bring in
[02:11:57.347 --> 02:11:57.688]  Absolutely.
[02:11:57.748 --> 02:11:59.370]  And they're not reporting the truth.
[02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:01.092]  They've spent the past three weeks
[02:12:16.570 --> 02:12:19.232]  They're demonizing Trump, saying that he's doing nothing for these people.
[02:12:19.532 --> 02:12:25.215]  They'll play the clip of, you know, he went there, he threw some paper towels into a crowd, and they're like, oh, that's all the relief Trump did.
[02:12:25.395 --> 02:12:25.996]  That's not true.
[02:12:26.416 --> 02:12:28.577]  They were yelling, give it, exactly.
[02:12:28.617 --> 02:12:30.778]  And it was like a football game or a Rockstar deal.
[02:12:30.798 --> 02:12:31.779]  He was just being personal.
[02:12:31.799 --> 02:12:32.419]  He was having fun.
[02:12:32.439 --> 02:12:32.719]  Exactly.
[02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:34.200]  And everyone was laughing and smiling.
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.701]  People like him because he does that.
[02:12:35.921 --> 02:12:36.121]  Right.
[02:12:36.282 --> 02:12:38.203]  We don't want some stuck-up president that, you know.
[02:12:38.843 --> 02:12:42.084]  Yeah, and they're trying to make it out to be that's the only relief that he gave to the island.
[02:12:42.444 --> 02:12:44.365]  But they're actually sending powerline trucks.
[02:12:44.405 --> 02:12:46.145]  CNN's Stelter said, look at the relief.
[02:12:46.165 --> 02:12:47.425]  This is all he did was paper towels.
[02:12:47.906 --> 02:12:48.766]  They have, you were there.
[02:12:49.066 --> 02:12:54.467]  It's stacked up to the... Well, I showed in that footage all those containers that are at the porch.
[02:12:54.507 --> 02:12:55.228]  The docks are full.
[02:12:55.248 --> 02:13:01.409]  There's nowhere to unload new containers because despite, you know, it's full of goods, it's full of relief.
[02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:02.930]  And that was two weeks ago.
[02:13:03.783 --> 02:13:06.524]  In fact, I was reading it's like 15, 20 ships lined up, too.
[02:13:06.865 --> 02:13:07.025]  Yep.
[02:13:07.305 --> 02:13:08.325]  I mean, they can't even dump it.
[02:13:08.805 --> 02:13:14.748]  Yeah, we saw a couple ships out in the harbor there in San Juan, but all the ports that are federally controlled are open on the island.
[02:13:15.169 --> 02:13:16.229]  All the airports are open.
[02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:18.850]  Let's show that map you mentioned.
[02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:22.072]  Tell folks for themselves on radio, because we always think we're just visual.
[02:13:22.312 --> 02:13:23.192]  We're mainly radio.
[02:13:23.893 --> 02:13:29.556]  Tell folks how to go to the official nation of Puerto Rico, island of Puerto Rico's own site to see what's really going on.
[02:13:29.716 --> 02:13:29.856]  Right.
[02:13:29.896 --> 02:13:31.196]  There's this website called status.pr.
[02:13:32.597 --> 02:13:33.598]  Let's put that on screen, guys.
[02:13:33.618 --> 02:13:34.999]  Status.pr.
[02:13:35.359 --> 02:13:38.922]  On this website, they show all the up-to-date statistics as of today.
[02:13:39.823 --> 02:13:42.065]  So, 79% of gas stations are open today.
[02:13:42.085 --> 02:13:44.367]  86% of supermarkets.
[02:13:44.567 --> 02:13:45.608]  55% of telecoms back.
[02:13:45.888 --> 02:13:48.490]  Of course, the big power issue is power and electricity.
[02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:49.771]  That's at 17% today.
[02:13:50.192 --> 02:13:53.575]  But the power company was bankrupt there months before the storm even hit.
[02:13:54.035 --> 02:13:57.338]  So they don't have... It's been bankrupt for two years, though, overall.
[02:13:57.638 --> 02:13:59.039]  But their power... That's what Trump's saying.
[02:13:59.059 --> 02:13:59.660]  He's saying, listen,
[02:14:00.666 --> 02:14:04.429]  Like Houston, the citizens helped, everybody worked with the military, everybody.
[02:14:04.929 --> 02:14:13.096]  You've gotta, and it's not the citizens fault there, they're controlled by these liberal mafias, like mayors are like the mafias of each little street.
[02:14:13.556 --> 02:14:13.996]  Exactly.
[02:14:14.016 --> 02:14:14.877]  They have 93 mayors.
[02:14:15.497 --> 02:14:26.346]  And we saw young people driving around in pickup trucks, and I'm thinking the whole time we're there, if there's people in need, if there's old people who are going without food or water, why are you not driving to these points where they're distributing the aid with your pickup truck?
[02:14:26.806 --> 02:14:30.249]  And here's the deal, it's not because of their color, it's cultural.
[02:14:30.710 --> 02:14:34.434]  You had Hispanics and whites and blacks all helping each other in Texas, that's how we do it.
[02:14:34.734 --> 02:14:35.655]  Just get out of the way.
[02:14:35.955 --> 02:14:41.020]  There's this attitude in the third world and Latin America of just wait and go through a bureaucracy.
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:45.785]  Well, we went to some of these areas and right down the street there's a whole mall open, there's grocery stores open.
[02:14:46.025 --> 02:14:47.386]  People are like, where's their food, where's their water?
[02:14:47.406 --> 02:14:49.889]  It's like, well, if you don't have a car you might have to go walk to get some.
[02:14:50.009 --> 02:14:54.992]  But it's very different than what we saw in Haiti, where if these people didn't have food delivered to them, they would die.
[02:14:55.052 --> 02:14:57.773]  How many, what, hundreds of thousands, 200,000 died in Haiti?
[02:14:58.074 --> 02:15:00.535]  We got maybe 50-something deaths?
[02:15:00.555 --> 02:15:01.235]  50, 60, around that.
[02:15:01.536 --> 02:15:06.218]  Yeah, I checked last night, 57 deaths versus 200,000 from the earthquake in Haiti.
[02:15:06.639 --> 02:15:10.581]  Right, and Katrina was over 1,000 people died right here in Louisiana.
[02:15:11.494 --> 02:15:14.275]  See, that's all teleprompter-free, because we actually have a passion to care.
[02:15:14.855 --> 02:15:18.276]  Because, think about, you love a cashless society.
[02:15:18.296 --> 02:15:22.698]  There was an article out today from Mises.org, it's on Infoworks.com.
[02:15:23.258 --> 02:15:26.179]  In a cashless world, you better pray the power never goes out.
[02:15:26.379 --> 02:15:27.640]  And they're in big trouble because of that.
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:37.163]  The banks are not open, and a lot of people like Ruben Obed, who we spoke to, who's been on the show before, he said, well, we've got money on our debit cards, but we can't go to the bank and get cash.
[02:15:37.263 --> 02:15:38.824]  And the card readers are down at the stores.
[02:15:39.901 --> 02:15:43.324]  I mean, I don't want to sit here and just defend Trump, but that's like defending reality.
[02:15:44.024 --> 02:15:47.146]  It's like somebody called and said, Jews invented devil worship!
[02:15:47.907 --> 02:15:50.449]  And I go, actually, Jews were the first group to ban human sacrifice.
[02:15:51.349 --> 02:15:51.690]  Abraham.
[02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:54.211]  And it's not just defending Jews, it's defending reality.
[02:15:54.752 --> 02:15:55.933]  It's the same thing here.
[02:15:56.173 --> 02:15:57.934]  It's just that Trump did not do this.
[02:15:58.174 --> 02:15:59.175]  He's done a great job.
[02:15:59.435 --> 02:16:01.257]  So is our military and FEMA and everybody else.
[02:16:02.638 --> 02:16:04.179]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:16:05.444 --> 02:16:10.789]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:16:11.049 --> 02:16:12.170]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.732]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:16:15.392 --> 02:16:21.898]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:16:22.118 --> 02:16:25.441]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:16:25.761 --> 02:16:27.563]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:16:28.203 --> 02:16:36.634]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:16:36.654 --> 02:16:37.616]  They know how great it is.
[02:16:38.537 --> 02:16:42.282]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:16:43.223 --> 02:16:44.623]  Tropic means for the brain.
[02:16:45.424 --> 02:16:53.285]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:16:53.725 --> 02:16:59.527]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:17:04.748 --> 02:17:05.169]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:17:05.329 --> 02:17:09.353]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:17:09.774 --> 02:17:12.917]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:17:12.957 --> 02:17:13.898]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:17:15.099 --> 02:17:15.800]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.

[02:18:27.018 --> 02:18:34.429]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen.
[02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:35.950]  And more.
[02:18:36.431 --> 02:18:37.071]  Concentrate.
[02:18:37.091 --> 02:18:38.873]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:18:39.133 --> 02:18:40.494]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:18:40.514 --> 02:18:42.416]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:18:42.816 --> 02:18:43.697]  It's incredible.
[02:18:44.177 --> 02:18:46.079]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:18:46.259 --> 02:18:48.221]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[02:18:48.301 --> 02:18:48.781]  Incredible.
[02:18:49.101 --> 02:18:49.982]  It is amazing.
[02:18:50.342 --> 02:18:52.064]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:18:52.384 --> 02:18:53.185]  50% off Caveman.
[02:18:53.405 --> 02:18:54.726]  But only a few days left.
[02:18:54.966 --> 02:18:55.727]  It's about to end.
[02:18:56.307 --> 02:18:58.648]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:18:59.088 --> 02:19:04.250]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:19:04.670 --> 02:19:06.071]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:19:06.311 --> 02:19:07.471]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:19:07.871 --> 02:19:08.672]  I want to thank you.
[02:19:08.992 --> 02:19:10.052]  We're all in this together.
[02:19:10.572 --> 02:19:20.476]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[02:19:27.197 --> 02:19:36.620]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.241]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[02:19:55.988 --> 02:20:00.812]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[02:20:05.716 --> 02:20:08.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.354 --> 02:20:31.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:45.849]  You know, about three weeks ago, I made the decision, we're gonna get back into Puerto Rico in a minute, it's bigger than Puerto Rico, it's about media response, control, manipulation, you understand Puerto Rico, you understand it all, it's a great case point example, and it's very important.
[02:20:47.466 --> 02:20:51.270]  But I decided, and I told the crew, I said, listen, I don't tell you what to cover, I don't tell you what to do.
[02:20:51.610 --> 02:20:54.793]  Because I hire people that I know are competent, care about freedom, I want to have their perspective.
[02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:58.857]  The media always says, look, Paul Watson disagrees with Alex on this.
[02:20:59.698 --> 02:21:01.179]  Alex can't control his reporters.
[02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:05.203]  No, no, I don't work at the Huffington Post or Newsweek where it's a cult.
[02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:07.885]  I don't tell folks to agree with me.
[02:21:08.306 --> 02:21:09.427]  They don't get in trouble for disagreeing.
[02:21:10.539 --> 02:21:15.200]  They have a general history of being smart, of know what's going on, and I respect it.
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:17.081]  I want that college of ideas.
[02:21:17.121 --> 02:21:22.982]  I don't want to be addled or hobbled by people being yes-men.
[02:21:24.103 --> 02:21:37.606]  That said, I said, look, I don't want to, and I've told Roger Stone this too, I said, I don't want to follow White House intrigue and power struggles, because I said, we get rid of Spicer, and we get rid of Priebus, and then we get Kelly.
[02:21:37.906 --> 02:21:39.587]  And then Kelly's even worse, supposedly.
[02:21:41.565 --> 02:21:43.306]  And I said, I don't know what the truth is about Kelly.
[02:21:43.746 --> 02:21:45.867]  His son died in Iraq, he sounds like a committed guy.
[02:21:46.467 --> 02:21:50.089]  But then I hear, I can't help it, you know, that Trump's very close to firing Kelly.
[02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:54.651]  And suddenly Kelly is doing a live press briefing right now, talking about how much he loves Trump.
[02:21:55.351 --> 02:21:56.972]  Which is the one way to not get fired by Trump.
[02:21:57.852 --> 02:22:05.756]  So, so, I just, all I know is Kelly admits in the news, our main job is keeping info wars from the President.
[02:22:07.457 --> 02:22:07.657]  Well,
[02:22:08.627 --> 02:22:10.428]  What did Google and the New York Times say?
[02:22:10.468 --> 02:22:11.849]  We want to stop Alex Jones.
[02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:18.994]  Because it's not Kelly out there when they're saying that Trump's killing everybody in Puerto Rico, exposing it.
[02:22:19.414 --> 02:22:20.135]  It's our operation.
[02:22:20.415 --> 02:22:23.617]  It's our audience that then helps us get the info and carries the ball.
[02:22:23.657 --> 02:22:25.559]  We're all... Folks, you're InfoWars.
[02:22:25.979 --> 02:22:27.320]  I don't just say that to pat you on the head.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:28.240]  Without you, we're done.
[02:22:28.941 --> 02:22:29.721]  With you, we win.
[02:22:30.222 --> 02:22:30.602]  Together.
[02:22:31.102 --> 02:22:31.483]  You win.
[02:22:33.084 --> 02:22:33.264]  So...
[02:22:36.786 --> 02:22:39.126]  But I think it's healthy to not focus on the White House centric.
[02:22:39.166 --> 02:22:40.507]  And I don't tell Roger what to do.
[02:22:41.847 --> 02:22:42.827]  I'm just giving examples.
[02:22:42.907 --> 02:22:43.367]  I told everybody.
[02:22:43.427 --> 02:22:45.028]  I said, listen, I get caught up in this too.
[02:22:45.448 --> 02:22:46.468]  We're not in D.C.
[02:22:46.488 --> 02:22:48.568]  We're not scrabbling to be part of the power.
[02:22:48.828 --> 02:22:50.749]  We're not all these losers up there in D.C.
[02:22:51.269 --> 02:22:53.129]  that need to be part of that power.
[02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:54.289]  We built this.
[02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:55.150]  We're America.
[02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:57.630]  We don't want to be part of Hollywood or D.C.
[02:22:57.690 --> 02:22:59.711]  or New York or the power structure.
[02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:01.691]  We want to be separate and independent.
[02:23:02.912 --> 02:23:07.035]  That said, I don't mean never cover it, but what's your view on that, Michael?
[02:23:07.095 --> 02:23:07.596]  Right, I agree.
[02:23:07.656 --> 02:23:09.197]  We shouldn't make that the main focus.
[02:23:09.577 --> 02:23:17.904]  They're trying to distract us right now from all these things happening in Las Vegas, the cover-up with that, with this news about IQ tests and Kelly and Trump having some sort of feud.
[02:23:18.364 --> 02:23:19.545]  That's not the main story going on.
[02:23:19.565 --> 02:23:24.729]  The main story is that 60 people were murdered in Las Vegas, and the story they're giving us is a bunch of lies.
[02:23:24.949 --> 02:23:30.794]  What do you make of the info we got 12 days ago, all of it proven right, from the HRT?
[02:23:32.435 --> 02:23:35.119]  The first time I got info from the HRT, I was like, okay, and then it happened.
[02:23:35.439 --> 02:23:36.340]  Second time, I'm like, wow.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:44.570]  Third time, they're giving us... What does it say about America that the FBI, in the actual tactical level, communicates to us?
[02:23:47.267 --> 02:23:51.009]  I was skeptical about some of this when I left town a week ago last Tuesday.
[02:23:51.610 --> 02:23:55.932]  You know, I was questioning the main story, but I wasn't really sure, you know, were there multiple shooters?
[02:23:56.933 --> 02:23:58.574]  What of the story they're giving us is true?
[02:23:59.014 --> 02:24:03.717]  And then when I got back in town and had internet again, I was just reading article after article last night.
[02:24:03.777 --> 02:24:07.619]  And they admit the whole story is a fraud, multiple shooters, shooting 45 minutes before.
[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:10.801]  Notice I said two days ago, but notice it's six minutes before I said watch.
[02:24:11.161 --> 02:24:12.943]  They're going to expand it because what we had was
[02:24:13.763 --> 02:24:15.404]  There was at least four shooters.
[02:24:16.045 --> 02:24:17.486]  And cops took them out in other areas.
[02:24:17.706 --> 02:24:18.607]  And we have the witnesses!
[02:24:19.428 --> 02:24:20.809]  There was a major ISIS attack.
[02:24:20.829 --> 02:24:22.870]  They said there was guys with beards running around.
[02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:26.133]  I'm not supposed to get into this, but... I mean, they just covered up an ISIS attack.
[02:24:26.413 --> 02:24:27.714]  Then you gotta ask, why are they doing it?
[02:24:27.794 --> 02:24:29.516]  And the hotel knew six minutes before.
[02:24:29.736 --> 02:24:29.936]  Yeah.
[02:24:29.956 --> 02:24:30.797]  This guard's getting shot.
[02:24:30.817 --> 02:24:32.438]  Their policy is not to do anything about it.
[02:24:32.698 --> 02:24:35.641]  So they don't even tell the police we've got someone raining gunfire out of the window.
[02:24:37.182 --> 02:24:40.804]  And then this whole thing saying it was these bump fire stocks, they finally put those pictures out.
[02:24:41.324 --> 02:24:41.945]  That's all lies.
[02:24:41.965 --> 02:24:42.785]  There's videos out there.
[02:24:43.085 --> 02:24:49.549]  Everybody we've talked to, Navy SEALs, Delta Force, Special Forces, Green Beret, they even know the names of the guns.
[02:24:49.569 --> 02:24:50.629]  We even hired an acoustic guy.
[02:24:50.649 --> 02:24:51.450]  It's coming out tomorrow.
[02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:53.151]  They have signatures.
[02:24:53.491 --> 02:24:54.832]  They know the guns, bro.
[02:24:55.132 --> 02:24:55.292]  Right.
[02:24:55.432 --> 02:24:56.453]  And it's not what they're telling us.
[02:24:57.389 --> 02:24:58.270]  So where are these guns?
[02:24:58.410 --> 02:24:59.170]  Where are the other shooters?
[02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:01.091]  Just like there's voice print analysis for 20 years?
[02:25:01.312 --> 02:25:01.492]  Right.
[02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:02.752]  They got gun analysis.
[02:25:03.313 --> 02:25:07.556]  They know the report, how long it is, even what load they're shooting.
[02:25:07.576 --> 02:25:14.560]  When you can measure the distances with the, you know, sound, the actual gunshot and then the sound of the bullet hitting, knowing... Velocity.
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:16.441]  Yeah, it's like 250 meters or something.
[02:25:17.042 --> 02:25:21.164]  Gary was actually showing me a video while we were in the Dominican Republic.
[02:25:21.204 --> 02:25:23.246]  He found one that was analyzing all of this.
[02:25:23.386 --> 02:25:24.526]  How cool is Gary Haven?
[02:25:25.527 --> 02:25:26.528]  Coolest person I've ever met.
[02:25:27.563 --> 02:25:28.204]  Cooler than me?
[02:25:28.284 --> 02:25:29.264]  I'm joking.
[02:25:29.585 --> 02:25:33.147]  I never get to fly around with you guys on all those jets and stuff, but he's always like helping.
[02:25:33.167 --> 02:25:34.268]  He doesn't just do it for publicity.
[02:25:34.548 --> 02:25:35.289]  He never even wanted to.
[02:25:35.309 --> 02:25:36.590]  I said, hey, let us go on your aid missions.
[02:25:36.930 --> 02:25:39.372]  He literally just flies around helping people.
[02:25:39.492 --> 02:25:45.897]  The first day we went into Puerto Rico, we flew over the island and we're trying to find out where could aid best be used.
[02:25:46.297 --> 02:25:53.042]  But if the ports are open and the freeways are open, it doesn't make sense for him when his money could be used for aid in other countries.
[02:25:53.883 --> 02:26:02.071]  To fly things in, you know, on an airplane when the ports and roads are open, all the storage... Sure, and it's stacked up, you know, 10 boxes deep, 10 containers deep, literally.
[02:26:02.131 --> 02:26:04.473]  But you guys did go give the real aid, showing the truth.
[02:26:04.793 --> 02:26:05.194]  Exactly.
[02:26:05.254 --> 02:26:13.261]  So we distributed aid to a town right outside of San Juan, and then Ruben Obed has then gone and distributed that to a bunch of people in his community.
[02:26:13.442 --> 02:26:15.283]  We gave him some money since the stores are open too.
[02:26:16.084 --> 02:26:17.885]  But he's making good use of that.
[02:26:17.965 --> 02:26:21.966]  Because when we left the break, in a cashless world, you better pray the power never goes out.
[02:26:22.286 --> 02:26:22.966]  He's got money.
[02:26:23.006 --> 02:26:23.686]  He's got a business.
[02:26:23.727 --> 02:26:24.507]  He's a successful guy.
[02:26:24.547 --> 02:26:25.367]  He can't spend it.
[02:26:25.707 --> 02:26:25.887]  Right.
[02:26:26.327 --> 02:26:27.268]  Everyone has their money on them.
[02:26:27.288 --> 02:26:28.628]  Because the cell phone, the banks are down.
[02:26:29.328 --> 02:26:30.749]  The store may be open, but sorry.
[02:26:31.109 --> 02:26:33.870]  Yeah, if you don't have cash on hand, you're not going to be able to spend any money.
[02:26:34.170 --> 02:26:35.730]  So 80% of the stores are open.
[02:26:35.770 --> 02:26:37.071]  If you don't have any cash, you're out of luck.
[02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:41.131]  Because the stores don't have power, they can't run your car.
[02:26:41.151 --> 02:26:42.912]  And they always act like we're against technology.
[02:26:42.952 --> 02:26:45.873]  That we've got food, or we've got solar, or we've got a garden.
[02:26:46.274 --> 02:26:47.934]  It's a normal human activity.
[02:26:48.514 --> 02:26:49.675]  Ants save food.
[02:26:50.395 --> 02:26:51.316]  Grasshoppers don't.
[02:26:51.356 --> 02:26:51.736]  They die.
[02:26:51.816 --> 02:26:53.657]  I mean, it's like normal instinct.
[02:26:55.182 --> 02:27:10.339]  You know, I had a new great baby, total angel, five months ago, and I told my wonderful wife, I said, listen, I want you to buy, even though you've got breast milk, in case that stopped, in case it was a problem, in case anything goes on, if there was a major war, I want you to buy a year of formula.
[02:27:11.509 --> 02:27:13.430]  And she said, my milk's fine, blah, blah, blah.
[02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:14.671]  And, you know, we got, I said, do it.
[02:27:15.311 --> 02:27:17.192]  Well, four months in, her milk stopped.
[02:27:17.252 --> 02:27:18.012]  No effect on her.
[02:27:18.172 --> 02:27:18.592]  Great lady.
[02:27:19.773 --> 02:27:23.254]  And, you know, and it's just examples like, wow, yeah, now we got a year of formula right here.
[02:27:23.274 --> 02:27:23.855]  I said, exactly.
[02:27:24.215 --> 02:27:25.716]  It's insurance we can eat.
[02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:28.517]  It's like, I want the bases covered that I can cover.
[02:27:28.757 --> 02:27:34.720]  And worst case, if it gets towards the end of life of the storable food, which is 20 plus years on most of the stuff, the stuff we sell is 25 years.
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:35.840]  Right?
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:36.761]  Yeah.
[02:27:36.841 --> 02:27:39.442]  So it's getting close to the end of their life, you know, 22, 23 years in.
[02:27:39.462 --> 02:27:41.083]  You can donate all that food to a food bank.
[02:27:41.103 --> 02:27:41.983]  Well, I mean, exactly.
[02:27:42.023 --> 02:27:49.588]  But if I'm sitting there rocking a baby who's a month old and watching my wife, you know, nurse her, I'm thinking, what if there's a nuclear war with Korea?
[02:27:50.028 --> 02:27:51.128]  I got food for everybody else.
[02:27:51.288 --> 02:27:53.670]  I don't have stuff for the baby.
[02:27:53.850 --> 02:27:55.651]  And then I think, well, she's got milk.
[02:27:55.711 --> 02:27:57.372]  I'm not going to just count on her having milk.
[02:27:57.952 --> 02:27:59.253]  And then sure enough, it ran out.
[02:27:59.734 --> 02:28:04.018]  It happened before with three other kids, another wife, but it's just, it has no effect on her.
[02:28:04.058 --> 02:28:04.779]  I can't produce milk.
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:06.741]  The point is that you just look at it at every angle.
[02:28:07.142 --> 02:28:07.342]  Right.
[02:28:07.662 --> 02:28:08.984]  Well, and you've got to provide for people.
[02:28:09.004 --> 02:28:11.386]  You have to provide for your family and make sure they're taken care of.
[02:28:11.727 --> 02:28:12.648]  And your community, too.
[02:28:12.748 --> 02:28:15.050]  So right now, those roads are open in Puerto Rico.
[02:28:15.330 --> 02:28:18.153]  People need to go to the stores, buy food, help their neighbors.
[02:28:18.193 --> 02:28:19.154]  If your neighbors don't have food,
[02:28:19.835 --> 02:28:20.515]  It's up for you to help.
[02:28:20.595 --> 02:28:21.276]  And that's my point.
[02:28:21.316 --> 02:28:22.436]  It's not being a superhero.
[02:28:22.496 --> 02:28:26.658]  As a father, you're analyzing at night, are the lights on outside?
[02:28:26.778 --> 02:28:27.699]  Are the doors locked?
[02:28:28.379 --> 02:28:30.240]  Do I have a firearm and an instant-access pistol?
[02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:31.280]  It's not that I'm living in fear.
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:32.221]  I'm living in charge.
[02:28:32.721 --> 02:28:33.842]  When I lay down, I feel good.
[02:28:33.862 --> 02:28:33.922]  Yep.
[02:28:34.922 --> 02:28:36.283]  You're not losing any sleep at night.
[02:28:36.323 --> 02:28:37.323]  Your family's taken care of.
[02:28:37.643 --> 02:28:38.524]  You've got food for them.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:39.720]  All that.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:40.601]  And I'm ready.
[02:28:41.461 --> 02:28:43.062]  And I'm politically fighting for the future.
[02:28:43.462 --> 02:28:46.844]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I'm not an enemy of my family.
[02:28:47.705 --> 02:28:49.426]  It's a default to be involved, folks.
[02:28:49.806 --> 02:28:50.707]  And it's empowering.
[02:28:50.807 --> 02:28:51.907]  It's the real ballgame.
[02:28:52.148 --> 02:28:57.371]  Not watching a bunch of drug addict steroid heads out there pissing on the flag.
[02:28:57.631 --> 02:28:59.032]  We'll be back with more breaking news.
[02:28:59.112 --> 02:29:00.432]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:02.814 --> 02:29:04.355]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:29:05.615 --> 02:29:10.959]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:29:11.219 --> 02:29:12.340]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:14.902]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:29:15.562 --> 02:29:22.067]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:29:22.287 --> 02:29:25.609]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:29:25.929 --> 02:29:27.731]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:29:28.371 --> 02:29:36.801]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:29:36.821 --> 02:29:37.782]  They know how great it is.
[02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:42.507]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:29:43.308 --> 02:29:44.749]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:53.457]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[02:30:01.403 --> 02:30:05.366]  That comes to 50.03.
[02:30:05.486 --> 02:30:09.550]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:12.852]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:30:15.254 --> 02:30:16.575]  It's a good deal at $39.

[02:31:02.165 --> 02:31:20.782]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[02:31:21.503 --> 02:31:26.828]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[02:31:27.188 --> 02:31:36.036]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[02:31:36.596 --> 02:31:37.237]  Concentrate.
[02:31:37.257 --> 02:31:39.038]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:31:39.318 --> 02:31:40.739]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:42.581]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:31:43.001 --> 02:31:43.862]  It's incredible.
[02:31:44.342 --> 02:31:46.263]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:31:46.444 --> 02:31:47.584]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:31:48.045 --> 02:31:48.945]  At 15, incredible.
[02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:50.146]  It is amazing.
[02:31:50.527 --> 02:31:51.788]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:52.228 --> 02:31:53.349]  50% off Caveman.
[02:31:53.569 --> 02:31:54.890]  But only a few days left.
[02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:55.931]  It's about to end.
[02:31:56.491 --> 02:31:58.753]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:31:59.253 --> 02:32:04.417]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:32:04.857 --> 02:32:06.238]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:32:06.498 --> 02:32:07.639]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:08.840]  I want to thank you.
[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:10.221]  We're all in this together.

[02:32:27.354 --> 02:32:36.781]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:32:37.042 --> 02:32:42.406]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[02:33:05.248 --> 02:33:07.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:48.642]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:49.062 --> 02:33:51.383]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:53.584 --> 02:33:55.125]  Defending reality.
[02:33:56.391 --> 02:34:00.053]  Defending the innocents, not because we're heroes, but because we aren't pedophiles.
[02:34:00.773 --> 02:34:01.373]  We're not evil.
[02:34:01.914 --> 02:34:02.954]  We're not trying to be evil.
[02:34:04.575 --> 02:34:07.816]  We have a big story, and Zimmerman's been looking into this.
[02:34:07.896 --> 02:34:11.878]  It's a Kit Daniels article on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:34:12.378 --> 02:34:17.120]  How did they, a few years ago, get hundreds of photos of all these top models?
[02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:23.863]  I remember when I heard it in Top Stars, I thought, how'd they get into all of their cloud computers at once?
[02:34:23.923 --> 02:34:24.944]  That just doesn't make sense.
[02:34:26.004 --> 02:34:37.748]  Turns out it was the database people, or 4chan, the autistic army as they call themselves, not an insult, the plus, has found the trail that it appears to be a Weinstein cache.
[02:34:38.488 --> 02:34:39.728]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:34:39.748 --> 02:34:40.688]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:34:41.189 --> 02:34:52.452]  Speaking of that, before we get back into this with Michael Zimmerman riding shotgun with me, fresh back from our aid trip and our investigation of Puerto Rico, the island nation, hit by three hurricanes this year.
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:35:03.594]  Before we go any further, I just want to point out that the Justice Department, Trump, started a criminal investigation today.
[02:35:03.634 --> 02:35:04.915]  How sensational is that?
[02:35:06.272 --> 02:35:19.760]  Of him fleeing, like we and others pointed out yesterday, I and others, the whole office did, is this Polanski, too, where he rapes a 13-year-old girl after kidnapping her, brutally, and then flees to France for years, not getting in trouble?
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:24.923]  Then there's pressure, they grab him for other sex abuse, put him in prison, and Meryl Streep wants him out of prison.
[02:35:24.963 --> 02:35:29.546]  The arrogance of publicly defending convicted child molesters
[02:35:31.024 --> 02:35:34.928]  Why would Meryl Streep now come out and say she's against Weinstein?
[02:35:34.948 --> 02:35:36.450]  Because their power's gone.
[02:35:37.051 --> 02:35:37.952]  The numbers show it.
[02:35:37.972 --> 02:35:38.812]  The facts are in.
[02:35:38.833 --> 02:35:46.200]  The NFL, mainstream news, CNN, The Daily Show, Comedy Central, Colbert, all of it.
[02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:49.972]  I never got up here in my 20-plus years and said, they've fallen, they're done.
[02:35:49.992 --> 02:35:52.014]  I was like, they're on top of us, dominating us.
[02:35:52.314 --> 02:35:53.355]  They're scum, they're filth.
[02:35:53.696 --> 02:35:54.376]  Here's the alternative.
[02:35:54.396 --> 02:35:55.537]  What I'm telling you, they're done.
[02:35:56.077 --> 02:35:57.038]  They know they're done.
[02:35:57.058 --> 02:36:05.365]  That's why they're trying to blow the country up, trying to cause a race war, trying to ship AIDS-infected blood all over the country from California, as they've legalized.
[02:36:05.746 --> 02:36:07.007]  They are in full panic mode.
[02:36:07.547 --> 02:36:09.268]  They've reached this point where they're eating their own now.
[02:36:10.197 --> 02:36:11.899]  Everyone is going to save themselves.
[02:36:11.919 --> 02:36:13.060]  They're going to turn on the others.
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:18.664]  The whole system they've built there with all these pedophiles, all these sex offenders, abusers.
[02:36:18.864 --> 02:36:21.206]  How luscious is it going to be to watch it in blood?
[02:36:21.907 --> 02:36:23.268]  Oh, Harvey Weinstein's the beginning.
[02:36:23.548 --> 02:36:24.289]  It's going to be wonderful.
[02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:26.731]  Over the next week or two, we're going to see a lot more people.
[02:36:26.751 --> 02:36:27.892]  They're talking about Ben Affleck now.
[02:36:28.332 --> 02:36:33.056]  Because I'm not a sadist, unless it's a child molestator, devil worshiper, or killer.
[02:36:33.097 --> 02:36:34.298]  And I kind of want to watch him.
[02:36:35.211 --> 02:36:36.333]  Yeah.
[02:36:37.694 --> 02:36:38.735]  Those are people I wish death on.
[02:36:38.756 --> 02:36:41.839]  If you're going to harm a child in that way, there's no excuse.
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:43.141]  There's no forgiveness either.
[02:36:45.203 --> 02:36:46.065]  Well it's happening now.
[02:36:46.145 --> 02:36:48.207]  Here's a piece that the crew put together.
[02:36:49.190 --> 02:37:04.866]  Of them sickeningly, including the star of one of the biggest films that's been out lately, based on the whole books that were put out, kind of showing us a near future world that they could create, The Hunger Games.
[02:37:05.546 --> 02:37:12.814]  We've got the quote star of that, literally on camera groveling to Weinstein, and we've got her in the data dump
[02:37:14.238 --> 02:37:16.059]  Uh, of this, uh, whole situation.
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.783]  I mean, this, this whole implosion is incredible because we all know, uh, these guys are not really into women.
[02:37:22.023 --> 02:37:22.864]  They're not into men either.
[02:37:22.884 --> 02:37:27.427]  The, the, the, the main hors d'oeuvre, uh, is small children.
[02:37:27.887 --> 02:37:29.848]  And so get ready for the whole house of cards to come down.
[02:37:29.889 --> 02:37:30.929]  They're scared folks.
[02:37:31.470 --> 02:37:36.293]  And I'm just honored with you because believe me, all of you listening are the battering ram knocking down the gates of hell.
[02:37:36.933 --> 02:37:38.434]  Thank our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[02:37:38.854 --> 02:37:42.697]  Now here is Hollywood defending, uh, the man that it's not denying.
[02:37:42.717 --> 02:37:43.618]  He raped a bunch of women.
[02:37:43.638 --> 02:37:43.958]  Here it is.
[02:37:45.099 --> 02:37:45.920]  Don't do it, J-Mo.
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.921]  You don't want to mess with Weird Al.
[02:37:48.101 --> 02:37:48.842]  Oh, please.
[02:37:49.262 --> 02:37:51.104]  I'm not afraid of anyone in show business.
[02:37:51.604 --> 02:37:55.488]  I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions.
[02:37:55.508 --> 02:37:56.489]  Out of five.
[02:38:07.842 --> 02:38:08.742]  I'm going to take a shower.
[02:38:08.802 --> 02:38:10.003]  You sit there and have a drink.
[02:38:10.023 --> 02:38:10.143]  Why?
[02:38:10.603 --> 02:38:11.323]  I don't drink.
[02:38:11.643 --> 02:38:13.064]  Can I stay in the bar?
[02:38:13.164 --> 02:38:13.384]  No.
[02:38:13.504 --> 02:38:14.564]  You must come here now.
[02:38:14.724 --> 02:38:15.024]  No.
[02:38:15.044 --> 02:38:16.144]  Please.
[02:38:16.164 --> 02:38:17.205]  No, I don't want to.
[02:38:17.225 --> 02:38:19.125]  I'm not doing anything with you.
[02:38:19.145 --> 02:38:19.865]  Come to me.
[02:38:19.885 --> 02:38:20.886]  Come to me.
[02:38:21.166 --> 02:38:21.886]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:21.946 --> 02:38:24.327]  No, yesterday was kind of aggressive for me.
[02:38:24.367 --> 02:38:25.247]  I'm uncomfortable.
[02:38:29.246 --> 02:38:29.666]  Oh, dear.
[02:38:29.686 --> 02:38:33.930]  Just stick your arm in the drainage pipe.
[02:38:54.921 --> 02:39:09.491]  By thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day.
[02:39:09.531 --> 02:39:16.796]  Harvey is a wonderful human being, a good friend, and just a powerhouse.
[02:39:16.976 --> 02:39:18.257]  I just want to thank God.
[02:39:18.657 --> 02:39:21.419]  So that's the joke, is to have a tranny as the beard for Obama.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:23.881]  Obama should just be public about how he's a gay man.
[02:39:25.987 --> 02:39:26.707]  The Punisher.
[02:39:26.727 --> 02:39:28.989]  Old Testament, I guess.
[02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:35.632]  I just want to congratulate Harvey and his wife Georgina on the birth of their new baby boy.
[02:39:37.233 --> 02:39:38.394]  What's that card's name?
[02:39:38.414 --> 02:39:39.574]  Jennifer Lawrence.
[02:39:39.614 --> 02:39:41.015]  Yeah, I mean, she looks really gross.
[02:39:41.035 --> 02:39:41.515]  Think about her.
[02:39:41.535 --> 02:39:42.155]  She's been with him.
[02:39:42.576 --> 02:39:43.236]  Now she's gross.
[02:39:43.736 --> 02:39:46.678]  She was a major person whose photos were leaked.
[02:39:46.738 --> 02:39:50.960]  Is Jennifer Lawrence Harvey Weinstein's right mate?
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.660]  She thanked him at every award show.
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:55.602]  He was on set of movies that he didn't even produce that she was in.
[02:39:55.682 --> 02:39:59.964]  Let's just do what we're here to do.
[02:40:00.684 --> 02:40:01.785]  Oh yeah, she's in deep with him.
[02:40:02.643 --> 02:40:03.583]  Awkward.
[02:40:04.043 --> 02:40:05.244]  Are we asking for it?
[02:40:05.764 --> 02:40:08.525]  You know, by... Oh, I love the feminists now.
[02:40:08.585 --> 02:40:13.966]  Now women are asking for it, like the feminist mayor of Cologne said, Don't wave mini-skirts, the Muslims are gonna rape you.
[02:40:14.006 --> 02:40:16.247]  ...performance by an actress in a supporting role.
[02:40:16.267 --> 02:40:17.207]  Wear Don't Rape Me bracelets.
[02:40:17.227 --> 02:40:21.668]  Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.
[02:40:28.692 --> 02:40:29.793]  Oh my gosh, called you God.
[02:40:29.813 --> 02:40:30.174]  How embarrassing.
[02:40:30.194 --> 02:40:30.835]  A rapist interviews a rapist.
[02:40:30.855 --> 02:40:31.876]  Who is this woman?
[02:40:31.916 --> 02:40:32.476]  Crip keeper?
[02:40:50.165 --> 02:40:50.745]  Donna Karan.
[02:40:51.266 --> 02:40:52.927]  I think we're looking at a world much deeper.
[02:40:53.447 --> 02:41:03.054]  You know, they tried to have the Huffington Post come out and claim that I was defending Weinstein when I said, a lot of women know they're getting into this and it's really evil, but a lot of young women don't.
[02:41:03.815 --> 02:41:07.398]  And so watch out, young women, you may end up in snuff films, which has happened in Hollywood.
[02:41:08.138 --> 02:41:09.079]  I mean, look at Sharon Tate.
[02:41:09.879 --> 02:41:10.560]  Oh, that was filmed.
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:11.281]  Oh, I'm good, we'll see.
[02:41:11.301 --> 02:41:12.321]  I'm sorry, I don't want them to know that.
[02:41:12.642 --> 02:41:15.243]  The point is, is that, that's an FBI file.
[02:41:16.324 --> 02:41:18.166]  They're going to call today and say, how do you know that, Jones?
[02:41:18.945 --> 02:41:20.528]  This is all going on.
[02:41:20.608 --> 02:41:21.750]  This is all happening.
[02:41:22.992 --> 02:41:28.661]  And the truth is, a lot of women, like Meryl Streep reportedly,
[02:41:33.072 --> 02:41:42.099]  This is what people are talking about when they talk about selling your soul for fame.
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:44.682]  When you're selling your soul to make it in Hollywood.
[02:41:44.902 --> 02:41:46.123]  They're talking about this kind of stuff.
[02:41:46.423 --> 02:41:48.325]  Getting just passed around by these studio creeps.
[02:41:48.725 --> 02:41:52.768]  Like Corey Feldman and others have said, they're children when this stuff starts happening to them.
[02:41:56.243 --> 02:41:58.844]  You know, Mark Dice told this story and it has happened to me too.
[02:41:59.224 --> 02:42:00.784]  He's in a big, major TV studio.
[02:42:00.804 --> 02:42:05.266]  They're offering me a TV show with one of the Motley Crue people.
[02:42:05.586 --> 02:42:06.566]  I separately confirmed this.
[02:42:07.867 --> 02:42:08.987]  Should I just say the name right now?
[02:42:09.207 --> 02:42:10.588]  The Motley Crue guy wasn't into it either.
[02:42:11.568 --> 02:42:13.609]  They show the pentagrams and stuff so you don't look radical.
[02:42:14.549 --> 02:42:17.530]  But they're pitching them both this show.
[02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:19.490]  Mark Dice and a member of Motley Crue.
[02:42:19.731 --> 02:42:20.691]  It's about five years ago.
[02:42:22.278 --> 02:42:25.499]  Then they tell Mark Dice when he's out of the room, they go, listen, this pledge leads us to Satan.
[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:28.801]  Let's pray to lose for right now, we're going to give you the show.
[02:42:28.861 --> 02:42:33.883]  And Mark said, you know, I'm a Christian, but, and the guy's like, listen, we just want you to not push that Christian stuff.
[02:42:33.923 --> 02:42:35.503]  Just say it and we'll let you go.
[02:42:36.303 --> 02:42:40.225]  Well, later it came out that that's what they do to quote, make sure you're not a Christian or right wingers.
[02:42:40.745 --> 02:42:42.646]  No, that's not what they're not just seeing.
[02:42:43.246 --> 02:42:44.647]  That's what they're into.
[02:42:45.267 --> 02:42:49.749]  And I've had them say that to me like, hey, Alex, you really shouldn't be at this party unless you want to screw little kids.
[02:42:50.669 --> 02:42:53.153]  And I realized they were messing with me, but they weren't.
[02:42:53.173 --> 02:42:54.856]  I was like, you know what?
[02:42:54.956 --> 02:42:55.998]  Actually, I don't want to do that.
[02:42:56.278 --> 02:42:58.161]  So I'm not going to be part of this.
[02:42:58.722 --> 02:42:59.803]  So that's what it is, folks.
[02:43:00.805 --> 02:43:01.186]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.087 --> 02:43:03.629]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running.
[02:43:04.901 --> 02:43:10.224]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:43:10.484 --> 02:43:11.625]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:11.865 --> 02:43:14.166]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:43:14.847 --> 02:43:21.350]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:24.892]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:43:25.213 --> 02:43:27.014]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:43:27.654 --> 02:43:36.084]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:43:36.104 --> 02:43:37.065]  They know how great it is.
[02:43:37.986 --> 02:43:41.770]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:43:42.591 --> 02:43:44.032]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[02:43:44.853 --> 02:43:52.737]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:43:53.178 --> 02:44:01.662]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:44:02.202 --> 02:44:04.624]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:44:04.764 --> 02:44:08.826]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:44:09.226 --> 02:44:12.148]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:44:14.529 --> 02:44:15.409]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:44:15.749 --> 02:44:26.732]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:44:27.512 --> 02:44:41.315]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get

[02:44:59.026 --> 02:45:02.009]  Again, that's infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:02.269 --> 02:45:20.043]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.

[02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:35.319]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[02:45:35.879 --> 02:45:36.519]  Concentrate.
[02:45:36.539 --> 02:45:38.320]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:40.001]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:45:40.021 --> 02:45:41.861]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:43.142]  It's incredible.
[02:45:43.622 --> 02:45:45.522]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:45:45.703 --> 02:45:46.863]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:45:47.323 --> 02:45:48.223]  At 15, incredible.
[02:45:48.544 --> 02:45:49.424]  It is amazing.

[02:45:55.766 --> 02:45:58.088]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:45:58.528 --> 02:46:03.713]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:46:04.133 --> 02:46:05.534]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:46:05.774 --> 02:46:06.935]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:46:07.315 --> 02:46:08.136]  I want to thank you.
[02:46:08.456 --> 02:46:09.497]  We're all in this together.

[02:47:05.711 --> 02:47:08.332]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.967 --> 02:47:23.254]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:47:24.857 --> 02:47:31.285]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[02:47:33.746 --> 02:47:36.488]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:37.669 --> 02:47:41.332]  And I hope I can get my heart right with God and not be part of this collapse into hell.
[02:47:41.352 --> 02:47:43.854]  But clearly the world is degenerating quickly.
[02:47:43.874 --> 02:47:45.815]  A lot of good developments as well.
[02:47:46.075 --> 02:47:47.356]  It's a paradox.
[02:47:47.376 --> 02:47:52.100]  A lot of key stories up on newswars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:47:53.755 --> 02:48:00.581]  You just got back last night, but have you seen where CNN says that George Soros fought the Nazis like Captain America?
[02:48:00.601 --> 02:48:06.005]  I mean, he said he helped the Nazis and worked with them on 60 Minutes.
[02:48:06.066 --> 02:48:08.227]  In 1998, now they say that's a lie that I told.
[02:48:08.247 --> 02:48:08.788]  What do you make of that?
[02:48:09.068 --> 02:48:10.649]  It couldn't be more clear what Soros said.
[02:48:10.789 --> 02:48:14.192]  We've played that clip hundreds, if not thousands, of times here at InfoWars.
[02:48:14.893 --> 02:48:17.294]  Soros says that those were some of the best days of his life.
[02:48:18.055 --> 02:48:21.057]  And then, of course, everyone knows CNN is fake news at this point.
[02:48:21.338 --> 02:48:26.322]  It's only these same people who get their news from John Oliver and Jimmy Kimmel who believe this stuff.
[02:48:26.482 --> 02:48:26.922]  That's right.
[02:48:27.062 --> 02:48:28.904]  They just know they're disruptive now.
[02:48:29.484 --> 02:48:32.726]  Their job is just to get us debating with them when they say the sky's
[02:48:33.487 --> 02:48:36.089]  You know, orange instead of blue at noon.
[02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:37.931]  They just want to get us debating.
[02:48:37.971 --> 02:48:38.832]  That's their only job.
[02:48:38.852 --> 02:48:40.553]  Trump only gave people paper towels.
[02:48:40.773 --> 02:48:41.254]  Yeah, sure.
[02:48:42.415 --> 02:48:49.421]  I know, I saw John, what's his, Stelter or whatever, little Humpty Dumpty guy, like, on there saying that with all this weird confidence act.
[02:48:49.781 --> 02:48:58.668]  I can't even do the look he does where he just goes like, he tries to act confident, he goes, I can't even do it, he's such a ridiculous person.
[02:49:00.798 --> 02:49:02.719]  And this is the best weapon they've got?
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:03.460]  Yeah.
[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:13.666]  These mainstream media jokers and the comedy shows that come on at night, they think late-night hosts are people's source of news now because a lot of morons out there believe it.
[02:49:13.747 --> 02:49:14.467]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:49:14.487 --> 02:49:16.368]  We built a high-tech civilization.
[02:49:16.829 --> 02:49:21.371]  The average folks worked in factories or were doctors or were teachers or were farmers.
[02:49:21.932 --> 02:49:23.393]  And we built this high-tech civilization.
[02:49:23.413 --> 02:49:26.255]  A bunch of crazy psychopaths thought, we'll be God if we get into this.
[02:49:26.695 --> 02:49:27.535]  They sought power.
[02:49:27.575 --> 02:49:28.536]  They got into positions.
[02:49:28.596 --> 02:49:29.437]  Hollywood government.
[02:49:30.117 --> 02:49:33.441]  Now, because of internet, we've all become savvy, generationally.
[02:49:33.461 --> 02:49:35.744]  And we're like, who is this creepy pervert?
[02:49:36.204 --> 02:49:37.966]  Wanting to be... saying he's God?
[02:49:37.986 --> 02:49:41.110]  I mean, anybody who's confident knows you're not God.
[02:49:41.170 --> 02:49:42.391]  You're confident you're just you.
[02:49:42.952 --> 02:49:43.953]  You have a connection to God.
[02:49:43.993 --> 02:49:45.996]  That's your... He doesn't even have the connection.
[02:49:46.276 --> 02:49:48.619]  He thinks he's God and doesn't have the connection.
[02:49:49.399 --> 02:49:49.540]  Right.
[02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:52.343]  It's like, dude, you're not even, don't even have a connection to God.
[02:49:52.683 --> 02:49:57.789]  And their audience, too, is small compared to that guy you had on the other week who shoots the Fatum videos.
[02:49:58.049 --> 02:49:58.250]  Yeah.
[02:49:58.770 --> 02:50:00.072]  He's getting 30, 40 million views.
[02:50:00.292 --> 02:50:01.353]  A lot of these students don't.
[02:50:01.393 --> 02:50:02.474]  He had 70 million on one.
[02:50:02.795 --> 02:50:07.120]  He's just a black cop that's articulate and... Saying what people are all... Boom!
[02:50:07.260 --> 02:50:07.680]  Right there!
[02:50:09.369 --> 02:50:10.290]  Yeah, he's telling the truth.
[02:50:10.330 --> 02:50:11.812]  He's going out there and people want the truth.
[02:50:12.132 --> 02:50:21.181]  So instead of these movie execs who spend hundreds of millions of dollars making a film, and a lot of them are flops, this guy gets his cell phone and reaches 70 million people.
[02:50:21.341 --> 02:50:22.242]  They wish they could do that.
[02:50:22.322 --> 02:50:23.644]  CNN wishes they could do that.
[02:50:24.611 --> 02:50:29.553]  Because of the internet, like you're saying, people now have the power to go straight to the rest of the country.
[02:50:29.753 --> 02:50:32.835]  By the way, we should make a bigger deal out of this, because I'm a humble person.
[02:50:33.275 --> 02:50:34.215]  I mean, that's my strength.
[02:50:34.255 --> 02:50:34.975]  I mean, I am humble.
[02:50:35.676 --> 02:50:40.898]  Because I realize it's all finite, which makes me feel pathetic that if I'm doing a good job, who are these people I'm beating?
[02:50:40.938 --> 02:50:42.359]  I mean, it's the opposite of a power trip.
[02:50:42.379 --> 02:50:44.399]  It's like, are we actually that good a species?
[02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:45.460]  It's like the opposite.
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:49.742]  But Project Veritas goes undercover with the New York Times and top YouTube executives are like,
[02:50:50.583 --> 02:50:52.205]  Our main job is to stop Alex Jones.
[02:50:52.826 --> 02:50:55.769]  And Veritas is like, wow, what are you doing that's got him this upset?
[02:50:56.130 --> 02:50:59.173]  And that just shows how weak they are, not how strong I am.
[02:50:59.554 --> 02:51:02.056]  But we should make some promos and stuff for the audience.
[02:51:03.226 --> 02:51:06.847]  Me included gets the fact, hey, we're what they're scared of.
[02:51:07.427 --> 02:51:09.368]  So behind the curtain, they're scared of this.
[02:51:09.668 --> 02:51:10.488]  What are they scared of?
[02:51:10.868 --> 02:51:12.449]  They're scared of Americana.
[02:51:12.729 --> 02:51:14.369]  They're scared of God.
[02:51:14.429 --> 02:51:15.349]  They're scared of Christ.
[02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:25.452]  They're scared of God-fearing Texas Americana prosperity, where people aren't such needle, you know what, that they want to suppress people so they feel powerful.
[02:51:25.872 --> 02:51:27.173]  I want to see you rise.
[02:51:27.193 --> 02:51:28.273]  I want to see you successful.
[02:51:28.593 --> 02:51:29.293]  That's what they hate.
[02:51:29.734 --> 02:51:30.474]  That's that spirit.
[02:51:32.096 --> 02:51:34.317]  I'm ready to kill people that attack me.
[02:51:34.517 --> 02:51:35.078]  I'm not scared.
[02:51:35.098 --> 02:51:38.920]  And so they're also scared of that because they want to be killers.
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.121]  They want to be the mystique-filled killers.
[02:51:41.561 --> 02:51:44.523]  And killing for me is like another thing in my Swiss Army Knife.
[02:51:44.763 --> 02:51:47.004]  Not that I'm some tough guy, but if I need to, it's easy.
[02:51:47.384 --> 02:51:49.005]  It's like taking a piss.
[02:51:49.365 --> 02:51:50.266]  And they don't understand that.
[02:51:51.613 --> 02:51:57.836]  Well, and they have to interfere with their algorithms that they've developed to, you know, put us in these internet ghettos, like Dredge said.
[02:51:58.576 --> 02:52:02.717]  They have to manually interfere with the algorithms because people want to watch InfoWars.
[02:52:03.138 --> 02:52:09.400]  The growth that, you know, InfoWars and other alternative media outlets are having, they cannot control unless they manually step in.
[02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:12.702]  And they've been doing it and it's still not working?
[02:52:13.142 --> 02:52:13.262]  No.
[02:52:14.181 --> 02:52:17.845]  No, they fail no matter what, because, you know, they come after InfoWars, you launch NewsWars.
[02:52:18.285 --> 02:52:20.727]  They come after our YouTube channel, we launch another YouTube channel.
[02:52:20.747 --> 02:52:26.773]  But what we really launch is the talking points, and everybody else realizing they're really the secret, and it's all them.
[02:52:27.074 --> 02:52:31.017]  When I see people getting 70 million views and dwarfing us, I love it.
[02:52:31.638 --> 02:52:35.261]  It's... people get... Satanism is envy.
[02:52:36.408 --> 02:52:40.009]  Satanism is jealousy of something that's only helping you.
[02:52:40.789 --> 02:52:43.530]  It's one thing if somebody takes your wife away for no reason and ruins your life.
[02:52:43.770 --> 02:52:44.571]  You should be mad at them.
[02:52:44.851 --> 02:52:55.134]  But if somebody's better than you and smarter than you, in many respects, of just saying something I try to say in a whole hour in six minutes like Tatum, because the media's like, Jones is praising a black guy saying he's articulate.
[02:52:55.434 --> 02:52:58.015]  Yeah, like I'm saying Trump is, or anybody else.
[02:52:58.035 --> 02:53:00.095]  The point is, the guy's better than me in many ways.
[02:53:00.555 --> 02:53:02.856]  That's a strength we all have as a community.
[02:53:03.156 --> 02:53:05.217]  That doesn't make me weaker, that makes me stronger.
[02:53:05.777 --> 02:53:08.059]  Well, reaching people with the truth is what intimidates them.
[02:53:08.639 --> 02:53:13.223]  Like I said, they spend all this money trying to push lies on the public, and it's not working anymore.
[02:53:13.283 --> 02:53:17.746]  The point is, is they've tried to already threaten us all and threaten to do stuff to us, and we like it.
[02:53:18.567 --> 02:53:22.510]  They haven't figured it out that we're... I don't want to explain it to them, but...
[02:53:23.934 --> 02:53:25.635]  Good people have a big good side.
[02:53:25.655 --> 02:53:26.516]  They have an evil side.
[02:53:27.036 --> 02:53:28.718]  The evil people only have their evil side.
[02:53:28.738 --> 02:53:30.739]  They cultivate that all day and think it's their power.
[02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:34.302]  But if they actually measure their evil next to ours, ours is much bigger.
[02:53:34.542 --> 02:53:35.343]  We're not proud of that.
[02:53:35.363 --> 02:53:36.564]  We're trying to get rid of our evil.
[02:53:36.904 --> 02:53:40.787]  They just think because we don't use the evil that we're like chumps.
[02:53:40.807 --> 02:53:44.570]  They don't understand we've transcended the evil because of Christ a little bit.
[02:53:46.021 --> 02:53:46.501]  That make sense?
[02:53:46.761 --> 02:53:46.921]  Yeah.
[02:53:47.762 --> 02:53:48.382]  Explain it to them then.
[02:53:48.963 --> 02:53:57.587]  Well, they are so obsessed with this evil and they, it shows, you know, they're obsessed with Satanism, they're obsessed with pedophilia, they're obsessed with abortion.
[02:53:58.027 --> 02:54:03.410]  If you look at their, they're obsessed with radical Islam, which is the worst system out there.
[02:54:03.850 --> 02:54:06.411]  It's just totally suppressive dirtbaggery.
[02:54:07.012 --> 02:54:09.793]  And they call themselves progressives while they're pushing all of these things.
[02:54:09.813 --> 02:54:10.654]  They're pushing death.
[02:54:10.954 --> 02:54:13.175]  They're pushing, you know, just evil and darkness.
[02:54:13.875 --> 02:54:14.976]  And they're obsessed with it.
[02:54:16.701 --> 02:54:17.462]  And it's so pathetic.
[02:54:17.502 --> 02:54:20.083]  Who wants to kidnap a little kid and ruin their dreams?
[02:54:20.324 --> 02:54:29.170]  Because you've got the will to take them in a basement and rape them for a month while they beg for mommy and then when they finally pass out and turn into catatonic mental illness, you kill them.
[02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:30.731]  Oh, I mean, what?
[02:54:30.751 --> 02:54:32.012]  That's not power.
[02:54:32.492 --> 02:54:33.313]  That's not power?
[02:54:33.413 --> 02:54:35.034]  No.
[02:54:35.134 --> 02:54:36.035]  As much as they would like to.
[02:54:36.075 --> 02:54:42.179]  Power is getting up as a single mother and busting your ass and taking care of those kids even though your husband ran off and seeing them successful.
[02:54:42.379 --> 02:54:42.920]  That's power.
[02:54:43.865 --> 02:54:44.005]  Yep.
[02:54:44.265 --> 02:54:45.126]  It's building a family.
[02:54:45.246 --> 02:54:47.127]  It's providing for them, like you were talking about earlier.
[02:54:47.387 --> 02:54:48.707]  Making sure your children have food.
[02:54:48.787 --> 02:54:52.369]  Making sure their home is protected when you lock everything up at night.
[02:54:52.769 --> 02:54:53.290]  That's power.
[02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:55.671]  You know, faith in Christ.
[02:54:55.851 --> 02:54:56.391]  Helping others.
[02:54:56.431 --> 02:54:57.492]  I'll make an admission, though.
[02:54:58.432 --> 02:54:59.493]  I really do hate the Globals.
[02:55:00.093 --> 02:55:01.154]  Mike, you've been here a couple years.
[02:55:01.194 --> 02:55:02.734]  What is it like studying them every day?
[02:55:03.175 --> 02:55:03.755]  Watching them?
[02:55:03.795 --> 02:55:06.136]  I mean, I gotta be honest.
[02:55:07.097 --> 02:55:09.538]  I'm guilty in the fact that I lust after hurting them.
[02:55:10.503 --> 02:55:11.183]  Yeah, I know you do.
[02:55:11.724 --> 02:55:13.965]  We've had a lot of conversations, traveled a lot together.
[02:55:14.545 --> 02:55:18.227]  We went to Hawaii and Seattle this summer, and it's the truth.
[02:55:18.287 --> 02:55:19.208]  You hate these people.
[02:55:19.688 --> 02:55:26.111]  I mean, these people, until you finally defeat them, you're going to keep fighting every single day towards that.
[02:55:28.092 --> 02:55:29.333]  But I think you hate them too, right?
[02:55:29.513 --> 02:55:30.354]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:30.674 --> 02:55:36.257]  But just your drive and passion, you have this focus that you've turned this into
[02:55:37.723 --> 02:55:39.907]  The biggest, you know, the tip of the spear, as you put it.
[02:55:40.028 --> 02:55:42.833]  But it's not just... I don't want to hate them.
[02:55:42.953 --> 02:55:44.035]  I hate what they do to people.
[02:55:44.756 --> 02:55:44.916]  Right.
[02:55:45.077 --> 02:55:46.018]  And if they want to fight...
[02:55:47.261 --> 02:55:51.684]  And they want to grow in this big free country and then piss all over and try to bring it down for everybody else.
[02:55:52.225 --> 02:55:53.566]  I just want them to get what they want.
[02:55:54.166 --> 02:55:57.929]  I want to accelerate where they want to take us, but I want it to happen to them, not us, Mike.
[02:55:58.589 --> 02:55:58.789]  Right.
[02:55:59.010 --> 02:56:00.030]  They want to destroy everything.
[02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.791]  Not our children.
[02:56:00.811 --> 02:56:01.511]  Not their children.
[02:56:02.192 --> 02:56:05.434]  If they want to fight, if they want to bang heads, let's give it to them.
[02:56:05.935 --> 02:56:10.918]  Yeah, you'd be happy with saving them too, but no, if they want to destroy everything, if they want to tear everything... Well, the Bible talks about it.
[02:56:10.938 --> 02:56:12.499]  I used to think I could wake them up.
[02:56:12.940 --> 02:56:13.420]  You can't.
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:14.461]  They're turned over to it.
[02:56:16.271 --> 02:56:18.412]  They've put everything they have into evil.
[02:56:21.914 --> 02:56:23.515]  What do you make of them being so panicked now?
[02:56:24.676 --> 02:56:26.477]  They know their days are numbered when it comes to this.
[02:56:26.757 --> 02:56:28.218]  They know that their systems are falling apart.
[02:56:28.238 --> 02:56:28.659]  They see it.
[02:56:29.379 --> 02:56:30.600]  They expected Hillary to win.
[02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:35.903]  They expected to be able to continue all of this, the plots that they're engaged in.
[02:56:36.263 --> 02:56:38.485]  But then Trump won and they're panicking now.
[02:56:39.389 --> 02:56:41.832]  They're using every weapon they have against the president.
[02:56:41.852 --> 02:56:50.803]  Yeah, and I'm sorry pedophiles, you can't openly legalize the schools to sexualize kids, and if you can't rape them in the back room, you're gonna convince seven-year-olds to have their genitals cut off.
[02:56:51.103 --> 02:56:54.648]  I'm sorry perverts, your satanism isn't gonna be out in the open anymore.
[02:56:54.968 --> 02:56:56.190]  Make it legal to give people AIDS.
[02:56:57.366 --> 02:57:05.012]  Yeah, California legalizes giving blood of HIV or giving it to somebody and they spin it like it's cute, like it's a right.
[02:57:05.152 --> 02:57:13.458]  I mean, Jerry Brown is a dying cockroach who's just trying to disease as many people as he can.
[02:57:13.879 --> 02:57:17.041]  And then of course the advocate came out and claimed I was anti-gay people.
[02:57:17.141 --> 02:57:23.766]  Yeah, because I don't want gay men cutting holes in their condoms and giving other gay men AIDS or HIV so I'm anti-gay.
[02:57:24.027 --> 02:57:25.147]  It's proving they're scum!
[02:57:25.908 --> 02:57:28.569]  The people running that want to prey on men and kill them.
[02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:32.550]  They're really Satanist vampire spiders that want to kill gay men.
[02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:33.090]  That's what they are.
[02:57:33.230 --> 02:57:37.071]  Yeah, the loving thing would be to make sure these people don't get AIDS, which is a death sentence.
[02:57:37.551 --> 02:57:38.952]  The truth is it's a targeted group.
[02:57:38.972 --> 02:57:45.894]  They first put the AIDS in vaccines, HIV, and that's their control group they want to have their way with.
[02:57:45.954 --> 02:57:46.494]  That's what it is.
[02:57:46.514 --> 02:57:48.495]  It's another attack on men.
[02:57:48.515 --> 02:57:49.595]  We'll be right back.

[03:00:19.107 --> 03:00:25.293]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:26.454 --> 03:00:27.835]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.128 --> 03:00:30.369]  Anthony Comey is coming up.
[03:00:31.129 --> 03:00:34.011]  Final segment here with Michael Zimmerman who just got back from Puerto Rico.
[03:00:34.831 --> 03:00:38.974]  Matt, one of the crew members, who I try to make good on air all the time.
[03:00:39.934 --> 03:00:41.875]  This guy is like a super talk show host behind the scenes.
[03:00:42.175 --> 03:00:43.356]  He gets on air, he gets a little bit nervous.
[03:00:43.776 --> 03:00:44.357]  So does Zach.
[03:00:44.737 --> 03:00:50.520]  Zach doesn't stumble over his words, he just slows down real slow to make sure he's saying it right.
[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:51.381]  And then
[03:00:52.841 --> 03:01:09.175]  Matt kind of stumbles over it but behind the scenes he's a better talk show host than I am and just as smart as we are smarter he's like hey Alex make the point but then I want to plagiarize it he wants me to make these points but I'm teleprompter free so this is not my brain saying this he said this he's like Alex notice we played it earlier
[03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:21.642]  Governor Brown will give you prison time if you're a healthcare provider and you don't use the word GZ, whatever the new thing is for... Facebook says there's 50 new sexes.
[03:01:21.682 --> 03:01:24.983]  I mean, we don't learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, but we learn all this.
[03:01:26.284 --> 03:01:30.425]  He'll give you more jail time for not using a tranny's proper name.
[03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:33.843]  Or transsexuals, proper name.
[03:01:34.624 --> 03:01:37.447]  Then they will if you give somebody HIV knowingly.
[03:01:37.748 --> 03:01:38.989]  And they go, but it's liberal!
[03:01:39.029 --> 03:01:41.212]  We're gonna try to kill you, or give blood!
[03:01:42.975 --> 03:01:44.577]  So I said to Matt, just come on out here and say it.
[03:01:44.597 --> 03:01:45.959]  He goes, no, no, no, you do it.
[03:01:46.419 --> 03:01:47.941]  But, that's a great point, Zimmerman.
[03:01:48.649 --> 03:01:54.431]  Yeah, people's feelings are more important to the California government than giving someone AIDS and possibly killing them.
[03:01:54.931 --> 03:01:57.992]  And that is the key to the entire situation.
[03:01:58.452 --> 03:02:04.735]  They take your real rights to privacy, to money, to property, to your own world, and they give you feelings.
[03:02:05.215 --> 03:02:06.635]  They give you lingo.
[03:02:06.695 --> 03:02:08.436]  They give you a new language.
[03:02:09.821 --> 03:02:10.201]  Exactly.
[03:02:10.342 --> 03:02:11.843]  Yeah, here's the words you're allowed to use.
[03:02:11.903 --> 03:02:13.285]  Here's the preferred pronouns.
[03:02:14.166 --> 03:02:16.909]  But no, when it comes to actual things that matter, they don't care.
[03:02:17.129 --> 03:02:18.891]  They've already destroyed the family in California.
[03:02:18.911 --> 03:02:22.475]  They've already banned guns, essentially, in California.
[03:02:22.515 --> 03:02:23.275]  I mean, I've said this.
[03:02:23.316 --> 03:02:27.200]  The only hypothesis that makes sense is there's some interdimensional alien breakthrough.
[03:02:28.985 --> 03:02:29.185]  This is
[03:02:50.714 --> 03:03:05.283]  And I'm not saying that's what's happening, I just, hypothesis-wise, you look at the Bible and every other of the ancient Vedic texts of the Indians, they talked about sometimes whole cities would go crazy and just start killing each other, and it's like, is this like beamed in from Saturn?
[03:03:05.664 --> 03:03:06.504]  It's the slow kill.
[03:03:07.004 --> 03:03:08.145]  The stuff they're putting in the water.
[03:03:08.165 --> 03:03:12.348]  You know, it's one thing after another, and cumulatively, they will destroy us.
[03:03:14.312 --> 03:03:25.964]  But I mean, Jerry Brown is literally spreading HIV and hepatitis everywhere, and literally waging war on California, and trying to bankrupt it, and trying to play- I mean, what is he?
[03:03:27.625 --> 03:03:27.946]  Demon.
[03:03:28.506 --> 03:03:29.728]  I mean, like the rest of these people.
[03:03:30.328 --> 03:03:31.970]  They worship and celebrate evil.
[03:03:34.403 --> 03:03:35.665]  And it's like Avatar.
[03:03:35.745 --> 03:03:38.388]  It's like you're walking down the street in Seattle and somebody looks totally normal.
[03:03:38.588 --> 03:03:46.618]  And it's like Agent Smith jumps in and they go... They're walking along and they go... And start hopping around and go... And you go to the next street and some woman does it.
[03:03:46.858 --> 03:03:48.480]  And you're like, dude, something's going on.
[03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:51.223]  It's like something jacks in and that's what it does.
[03:03:51.243 --> 03:03:52.585]  It like hops around like a lizard.
[03:03:53.286 --> 03:03:54.266]  These people look different.
[03:03:54.306 --> 03:03:55.828]  The ones that have been totally brainwashed.
[03:03:56.128 --> 03:03:57.049]  You can see it in their face.
[03:03:57.069 --> 03:03:57.930]  You can see it in their eyes.
[03:03:58.170 --> 03:03:59.011]  They have no life to them.
[03:03:59.051 --> 03:04:04.315]  The one who threw coffee on you, a homeless guy right after, was like, oh man, Alex, you know, I'm sorry.
[03:04:04.495 --> 03:04:05.436]  That guy had a life in him.
[03:04:05.636 --> 03:04:06.657]  He even confessed to us.
[03:04:07.418 --> 03:04:09.920]  He walked to breakfast with us and got breakfast with us that morning.
[03:04:10.260 --> 03:04:11.702]  This guy was addicted to heroin.
[03:04:12.122 --> 03:04:12.723]  He's homeless.
[03:04:12.843 --> 03:04:18.307]  But he said, I realize Seattle is all a giant temple to suck souls.
[03:04:19.127 --> 03:04:29.412]  Yeah, that guy had more soul in him, even though he was suffering with drug addiction and things like that, than this pot-bellied goblin creature, who's just... How can I be evil?
[03:04:29.493 --> 03:04:31.934]  He actually went... And he was making those noises.
[03:04:31.954 --> 03:04:33.034]  Yeah, I'm bumping up against you.
[03:04:33.054 --> 03:04:38.617]  And they'll tell you, I'm ugly, humanity's failed, and they'll go, you'll never defeat us.
[03:04:39.498 --> 03:04:41.599]  And you're like, what the... That's right, planet's ours!
[03:04:45.928 --> 03:04:46.929]  I couldn't put it any better.
[03:04:47.089 --> 03:04:47.329]  Yeah.
[03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:49.790]  And you're like, okay, a planet's yours, huh?
[03:04:50.571 --> 03:04:52.492]  And another guy walks by and goes, exactly, you're all dead.
[03:04:53.393 --> 03:04:54.493]  You're like, what happened here?
[03:04:54.753 --> 03:04:56.655]  Hey, we don't know what's going on.
[03:04:56.675 --> 03:04:57.815]  We're trying to figure it out with everyone.
[03:04:57.855 --> 03:04:58.856]  We want to save these people.

[03:06:15.267 --> 03:06:15.787]  Hello!
[03:06:15.827 --> 03:06:16.808]  Yes, I'm back.
[03:06:16.828 --> 03:06:18.729]  Anthony Comia in at Infowars.com.
[03:06:32.666 --> 03:06:33.807]  I was just watching Alex.

[03:06:53.036 --> 03:06:59.279]  Hollywood, you know, that wonderful place that gives us the gifts of entertainment.
[03:07:00.159 --> 03:07:01.600]  We spend
[03:07:02.583 --> 03:07:12.171]  How much time do you think we spend watching the product that comes out of that town?
[03:07:12.852 --> 03:07:13.672]  Think about this.
[03:07:14.633 --> 03:07:29.886]  We like to think, we would love to think that sitting down and watching the product, movies, television shows, even advertising to some extent, that comes out of that world,
[03:07:30.658 --> 03:07:33.580]  And we would love to think it's there for our entertainment.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:34.741]  That's it, right?
[03:07:35.541 --> 03:07:48.530]  These amazing people put together these amazing movies and fantasy scenarios and we get to escape from our drab little lives for a little while, don't we?
[03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:49.711]  Isn't it fun?
[03:07:51.372 --> 03:07:55.835]  And we spend a hell of a lot of time absorbing
[03:07:56.624 --> 03:07:57.705]  What they're putting out.
[03:07:58.265 --> 03:08:00.987]  And I don't use that word accidentally.
[03:08:01.628 --> 03:08:04.270]  We absorb what they put out.
[03:08:05.490 --> 03:08:15.958]  And boy, I might sound like a giant hypocrite with what I'm going to say, because I probably spend more time watching their product
[03:08:17.489 --> 03:08:18.910]  Than most people I know.
[03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.910]  I love it.
[03:08:20.290 --> 03:08:27.634]  I sit my ass in front of a television set, or in front of a movie screen, and I love it!
[03:08:28.574 --> 03:08:29.275]  So much fun.
[03:08:31.716 --> 03:08:42.761]  But look, look at the community of people, I use that term loosely, that are putting this stuff together, and putting it out there.
[03:08:44.424 --> 03:08:49.008]  Every year, I guess, we could look at it that way.
[03:08:50.169 --> 03:09:04.339]  We see what degenerates these people are, that are putting out the stuff, this product of theirs, that we cannot get enough of.
[03:09:05.020 --> 03:09:12.946]  We sit down, eyes and ears open, absorbing, absorbing everything they're putting out there.
[03:09:13.835 --> 03:09:16.396]  And again, entertainment isn't?
[03:09:16.496 --> 03:09:17.616]  Sure, it's entertaining.
[03:09:18.356 --> 03:09:38.782]  But if you don't think that there is some type of agenda that is being thrown into your face on a daily basis from this hive of scum and villainy that is, and I use that from a movie, hive of scum and villainy that is Hollywood, you're out of your mind.
[03:09:39.422 --> 03:09:41.623]  You're out of your mind if you don't think
[03:09:42.341 --> 03:09:55.204]  That this sick, perverse town is pumping out propaganda on a daily basis because they know you are locked into it and can be influenced by it.
[03:09:55.704 --> 03:09:56.545]  You're out of your mind.
[03:09:57.845 --> 03:10:03.526]  This town for years, for years, has been known to be what it is.
[03:10:05.127 --> 03:10:09.308]  It's a collection of extremely disturbed people
[03:10:10.382 --> 03:10:24.206]  With this sick ideology and this want and need for some reason to deconstruct everything that has made this country great over the course of history.
[03:10:24.986 --> 03:10:38.750]  Every institution that we have that has any type of moral value to it has to be destroyed and deconstructed by this town.
[03:10:39.611 --> 03:10:46.316]  This Hollywood town, it's been glamorized over the course of probably a century, right?
[03:10:47.116 --> 03:10:47.657]  I would guess.
[03:10:48.918 --> 03:10:54.201]  Glamorized as a place that, you know, regular people aren't allowed in.
[03:10:54.682 --> 03:10:55.542]  You're not allowed in.
[03:10:56.543 --> 03:10:58.724]  We watch all their award shows on television.
[03:10:58.764 --> 03:11:04.909]  We hear about their personal lives and we see where they live and where they're entertained.
[03:11:05.129 --> 03:11:06.430]  We're not allowed there.
[03:11:07.153 --> 03:11:24.338]  This is a private little club, such a small little enclave of these people that have the ability to influence everyone else with their agenda-driven propaganda.
[03:11:25.578 --> 03:11:31.700]  And if you look at the history of this, it's been the same for many years.
[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:34.461]  Deconstruct and break down
[03:11:35.367 --> 03:11:38.608]  The value system that has made this country great.
[03:11:38.928 --> 03:11:41.648]  And there are so many reasons why this would happen.
[03:11:42.609 --> 03:11:44.829]  An endgame, I guess you'd call it.
[03:11:46.189 --> 03:11:48.790]  And I honestly don't know what that endgame is.
[03:11:48.810 --> 03:11:50.370]  I have some ideas.
[03:11:50.390 --> 03:11:52.391]  I have some ideas.
[03:11:52.511 --> 03:11:55.711]  I think American exceptionalism is one thing.
[03:11:55.731 --> 03:11:56.591]  They don't like that.
[03:11:57.172 --> 03:12:00.292]  They want a more global society.
[03:12:01.693 --> 03:12:03.833]  But I honestly have to believe
[03:12:04.850 --> 03:12:24.271]  That there are just some sick people, there are some sick, perverse people that have figured out how to operate in relative safety, in numbers, by giving us something that we
[03:12:25.243 --> 03:12:29.327]  Somehow cannot live without this escapism and fantasy.
[03:12:29.728 --> 03:12:30.909]  So they all get together.
[03:12:31.249 --> 03:12:34.893]  They live these pretty perverse lifestyles.
[03:12:36.034 --> 03:12:40.018]  They have a hatred for what has made this country great.
[03:12:40.598 --> 03:12:45.102]  And they do things with relative impunity.
[03:12:46.063 --> 03:12:48.566]  And of course, I talk about Harvey Weinstein.
[03:12:49.890 --> 03:12:55.014]  The latest in this collection of degenerates that has been exposed.
[03:12:55.694 --> 03:12:56.355]  And that's it.
[03:12:56.575 --> 03:12:57.756]  He's been exposed.
[03:12:59.517 --> 03:13:03.801]  This has been going on for decades with this guy.
[03:13:05.242 --> 03:13:07.524]  Hollywood knew this was going on.
[03:13:07.964 --> 03:13:11.807]  So when you hear all of these people all of a sudden coming out.
[03:13:12.968 --> 03:13:18.993]  Kate Beckinsale, I aborted Harvey Weinstein come ons when I was 17 by saying I had school in the morning.
[03:13:20.643 --> 03:13:26.706]  I mean, and this is one story of just literally hundreds that are coming out about Harvey Weinstein.
[03:13:27.387 --> 03:13:34.230]  But if you think for a second these stories are coming out because people all of a sudden found out, again, stop.
[03:13:35.071 --> 03:13:35.791]  Open your eyes.
[03:13:36.412 --> 03:13:42.035]  Open your eyes and ears like you do when you're sucking in that propaganda that they put on movie and TV screens.
[03:13:43.155 --> 03:13:50.179]  Open wide, because if you think for a second they didn't know everything that was going on with this guy, you're out of your mind.
[03:13:51.198 --> 03:13:58.502]  Our own President, Barack Obama, the last one, not the good one.
[03:13:59.463 --> 03:14:18.034]  Barack Obama sent his own daughter to work at the Weinstein Corporation there, the Weinstein Company, knowing, you're not going to tell me, that the President of the United States did not know that Harvey Weinstein
[03:14:19.173 --> 03:14:22.676]  Was a complete serial predator and degenerate.
[03:14:23.697 --> 03:14:24.798]  Disgusted!
[03:14:25.579 --> 03:14:31.565]  Barack and Michelle Obama are disgusted by what they read about Harvey Weinstein.
[03:14:31.985 --> 03:14:43.235]  You mean to tell me Hollywood knew, everyone knew, popular culture, their own industry made jokes about it on award shows, on 30 Rock,
[03:14:44.779 --> 03:14:45.879]  On Family Guy.
[03:14:45.899 --> 03:14:48.800]  It was the scuttlebutt of the town.
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:50.481]  Because they're all like this.
[03:14:51.281 --> 03:15:13.128]  But you mean to tell me that when the Secret Service went to check out the Weinstein Company, when Obama's daughter was going to work over there, that they never heard a story that this degenerate was serial harassing, sexually harassing women?
[03:15:14.412 --> 03:15:15.213]  No, they never knew.
[03:15:15.994 --> 03:15:22.560]  Hillary Clinton, again, disgusted, never knew that this was happening.
[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:25.743]  They are all liars.
[03:15:26.604 --> 03:15:34.211]  The hypocrisy that comes out of Hollywood could only rival the hypocrisy that comes out of Washington.
[03:15:36.318 --> 03:15:41.502]  And we, I don't know why we have this, we give them the benefit of the doubt.
[03:15:41.843 --> 03:15:54.873]  We give them any bit of plausible deniability to run with because they are all like that and everyone in that town knew exactly what was going on and now they're just running for cover.
[03:15:56.074 --> 03:15:58.997]  We'll be back, of course, in a couple of seconds.
[03:15:59.357 --> 03:16:02.480]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:03.881]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[03:16:05.140 --> 03:16:10.463]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:16:10.723 --> 03:16:11.844]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:16:12.104 --> 03:16:14.405]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:16:15.086 --> 03:16:21.589]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:16:21.790 --> 03:16:25.131]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:16:25.452 --> 03:16:27.253]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:16:27.893 --> 03:16:36.302]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:16:36.343 --> 03:16:37.304]  They know how great it is.
[03:16:38.225 --> 03:16:42.029]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:44.271]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:16:45.092 --> 03:16:52.974]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[03:16:53.414 --> 03:17:01.897]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[03:17:02.437 --> 03:17:04.857]  That comes to 50.03.
[03:17:04.997 --> 03:17:09.039]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:17:09.459 --> 03:17:12.359]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:17:14.760 --> 03:17:15.641]  It's a good deal at $39.
[03:17:15.981 --> 03:17:27.231]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[03:18:02.505 --> 03:18:20.281]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[03:18:21.002 --> 03:18:26.350]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:35.603]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[03:18:36.104 --> 03:18:36.745]  Concentrate.
[03:18:36.785 --> 03:18:38.546]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:18:38.826 --> 03:18:40.227]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:18:40.247 --> 03:18:42.089]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:18:42.509 --> 03:18:43.370]  It's incredible.
[03:18:43.850 --> 03:18:45.771]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:18:45.952 --> 03:18:47.112]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:18:47.553 --> 03:18:48.473]  At 15, incredible.
[03:18:48.794 --> 03:18:49.674]  It is amazing.
[03:18:50.035 --> 03:18:51.296]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:18:51.736 --> 03:18:52.857]  50% off Caveman.
[03:18:53.077 --> 03:18:54.418]  But only a few days left.
[03:18:54.658 --> 03:18:55.419]  It's about to end.
[03:18:55.999 --> 03:18:58.320]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:18:58.781 --> 03:19:03.943]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:04.364 --> 03:19:05.764]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:19:06.004 --> 03:19:07.165]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:19:07.545 --> 03:19:08.366]  I want to thank you.
[03:19:08.686 --> 03:19:09.746]  We're all in this together.

[03:21:42.711 --> 03:21:43.512]  Hi everyone.
[03:21:44.853 --> 03:21:50.538]  I want to still deal with the sickness that is going on in this country.
[03:21:52.180 --> 03:21:54.081]  And the focus right now, Hollywood.
[03:21:54.642 --> 03:21:58.085]  Hollywood is just a giant tumor.
[03:21:58.974 --> 03:21:59.635]  On this country.
[03:21:59.655 --> 03:22:07.681]  Uh, it is, it does go, uh, it makes perfect sense that it resides in the, uh, sick state of California, by the way.
[03:22:07.701 --> 03:22:10.804]  Uh, as Alex was, uh, talking about just before.
[03:22:11.344 --> 03:22:21.672]  The fact that you could go to jail for, uh, uh, using an improper, um, uh, what, what do they call it?
[03:22:21.972 --> 03:22:23.734]  An improper, uh, uh, label?
[03:22:23.754 --> 03:22:25.035]  Uh, pronoun?
[03:22:25.135 --> 03:22:26.036]  Pronoun, that's it.
[03:22:26.736 --> 03:22:27.317]  Pronoun.
[03:22:28.217 --> 03:22:30.538]  For LGBT.
[03:22:31.538 --> 03:22:36.339]  X, Y, Z. You could actually go to jail for that, in certain circumstances.
[03:22:36.739 --> 03:22:48.642]  Yet, yet, if you give somebody AIDS, if you know that you have AIDS, and then you transmit that through sexual contact, that's fine.
[03:22:49.022 --> 03:22:50.783]  California says, nah, that's fine.
[03:22:51.343 --> 03:22:55.824]  You knowingly exposed others to HIV, it's no longer a felony in California.
[03:22:56.425 --> 03:23:06.653]  To give someone a death sentence is no longer a felony, but perish the thought you say him or her when somebody feels like a her or a him.
[03:23:06.673 --> 03:23:08.255]  Oh boy, that's trouble.
[03:23:08.535 --> 03:23:09.596]  It makes perfect sense.
[03:23:10.016 --> 03:23:22.686]  Please, please, San Andreas Fault, if you're listening, if the San Andreas Fault is listening, could you please shake, rattle and roll that state right into the Pacific?
[03:23:23.307 --> 03:23:24.928]  Could you do us a favor here?
[03:23:26.645 --> 03:23:36.267]  Hollywood is just a glamour central, glitter city, tinsel town, and it is one of the sickest places on the face of the earth.
[03:23:37.247 --> 03:23:53.011]  And if you don't see the fear also, we talk about the sickness, the depravity, the propaganda that is being pumped out of Hollywood, but we rarely talk about the utter and complete fear.
[03:23:53.996 --> 03:23:56.938]  That, uh, it just envelops Hollywood.
[03:23:57.018 --> 03:24:04.223]  People are petrified to speak out about, um, what's going on in that town.
[03:24:05.063 --> 03:24:07.045]  Uh, I guess Rose McGowan.
[03:24:07.605 --> 03:24:08.345]  Rose McGowan.
[03:24:08.385 --> 03:24:09.326]  You might have seen her.
[03:24:09.346 --> 03:24:12.928]  Uh, she, uh, she was in, um, Charmed.
[03:24:13.689 --> 03:24:14.389]  I guess Charmed.
[03:24:15.010 --> 03:24:17.552]  She went out for a little while with Marilyn Manson.
[03:24:19.153 --> 03:24:20.894]  Uh, and she's been in a few things.
[03:24:20.934 --> 03:24:22.655]  A few movies from Tarantino.
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:31.043]  Who, by the way, Miramax did his movies, by the way, was run by the Weinsteins at the time.
[03:24:31.323 --> 03:24:32.823]  It all comes together.
[03:24:33.284 --> 03:24:42.147]  It's the biggest, incestuous, sick stew that has been on the stove brewing for decades.
[03:24:42.867 --> 03:24:52.151]  So, Rose McGowan has been tweeting a lot about Weinstein, about Weinstein's cronies, about the
[03:24:54.114 --> 03:25:05.157]  This whole thing that goes on in Hollywood with sexual abuse and powerful people perpetrating crimes against other people.
[03:25:06.097 --> 03:25:08.518]  Using their dreams, I guess, against them.
[03:25:08.978 --> 03:25:10.358]  Everyone has a dream of being a star.
[03:25:11.458 --> 03:25:22.101]  So Rose McGowan has come out and calling out people like Matt Damon, like Casey and Ben Affleck, who of course worked with Weinstein, but again,
[03:25:22.737 --> 03:25:23.857]  They never knew.
[03:25:24.718 --> 03:25:29.619]  Everyone knew, but no one knew what was going on in Hollywood.
[03:25:29.659 --> 03:25:30.439]  Isn't it amazing?
[03:25:31.019 --> 03:25:31.679]  Isn't it amazing?
[03:25:32.140 --> 03:25:38.061]  So now they all come out, they're apologizing left and right, but they're doing it publicly.
[03:25:38.781 --> 03:25:41.582]  If you really wanted to apologize for someone, wouldn't you just do it privately?
[03:25:41.782 --> 03:25:44.023]  Well, it doesn't help if you do it privately.
[03:25:44.603 --> 03:25:48.524]  Yeah, there's... Which, look, I'm not in Rose McGowan's camp either.
[03:25:48.924 --> 03:25:50.705]  She's a tad bit of a hypocrite.
[03:25:50.945 --> 03:25:51.925]  You dress like that,
[03:25:52.896 --> 03:25:58.080]  And I gotta tell you, there's gonna be some issues with guys maybe, maybe getting the wrong idea.
[03:25:58.880 --> 03:25:59.821]  Wrong idea!
[03:26:00.181 --> 03:26:00.701]  Perhaps!
[03:26:01.182 --> 03:26:03.383]  But of course, you'd call me, you know, victim-blaming.
[03:26:04.144 --> 03:26:11.349]  If, uh, you look at a woman out in public like that and go, ah, maybe a guy's gonna say something to ya that you might not appreciate.
[03:26:12.089 --> 03:26:14.050]  But again, that's the sickness that goes on.
[03:26:14.711 --> 03:26:16.512]  Uh, I really fear for her life.
[03:26:16.952 --> 03:26:20.815]  She's calling out a lot of people, a lot of powerful people,
[03:26:21.885 --> 03:26:23.485]  Others are petrified to do it.
[03:26:23.886 --> 03:26:24.186]  Why?
[03:26:24.606 --> 03:26:25.726]  Just because they won't get work?
[03:26:26.046 --> 03:26:27.026]  That's probably part of it.
[03:26:27.466 --> 03:26:35.868]  But I wouldn't put it past these sick individuals, especially those in very high places in Hollywood, to get rid of people.
[03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:38.609]  To literally dispose of people.
[03:26:39.829 --> 03:26:44.490]  Twitter figuratively killed off Rose McGowan.
[03:26:45.191 --> 03:26:50.932]  I guess they didn't like what she was saying about some powerful people and Ben Affleck.
[03:26:51.681 --> 03:26:56.803]  She dropped the F-bomb in one of her tweets about Ben Affleck and her Twitter account has been frozen.
[03:26:56.903 --> 03:26:57.683]  I know what this is like.
[03:26:58.403 --> 03:27:03.745]  Twitter, YouTube, a lot of these places just cannot take the truth.
[03:27:04.365 --> 03:27:13.768]  They do not like the truth when it reflects poorly on all of the different industries that weave together and the powerful people that run them.
[03:27:15.749 --> 03:27:21.091]  Yeah, Rose McGowan Twitter account locked after a post about Weinstein and Affleck.
[03:27:21.937 --> 03:27:22.758]  And Matt Damon.
[03:27:23.058 --> 03:27:24.098]  And then we have another thing.
[03:27:24.358 --> 03:27:31.483]  Corey Feldman, a couple of years back, was talking about Elijah Wood and the Hollywood pedophilia controversy.
[03:27:31.983 --> 03:27:37.846]  There's apparently a huge pedophilia problem in Hollywood.
[03:27:38.747 --> 03:27:45.971]  And, of course, Corey Feldman, he was teamed up for many years with Corey Haim when they were youngsters in Hollywood.
[03:27:46.251 --> 03:27:49.413]  And the stories of pedophilia
[03:27:51.113 --> 03:27:52.713]  Running rampant in Hollywood.
[03:27:52.953 --> 03:28:07.156]  These powerful men, stories of parties, and these young boys just being thrown in to these sick men to have their way with them.
[03:28:07.816 --> 03:28:11.497]  And Corey Feldman will not mention names.
[03:28:13.797 --> 03:28:18.978]  If you see something like this going on, that literally led to the death of one of his friends, Corey Haim.
[03:28:19.682 --> 03:28:21.623]  Who had a problem with drug abuse.
[03:28:22.504 --> 03:28:24.966]  Wound up dying at a very early age.
[03:28:26.447 --> 03:28:34.052]  And he has said that it's a direct result of the assaults that happened to him in his youth.
[03:28:34.672 --> 03:28:36.473]  But he won't even say who.
[03:28:36.974 --> 03:28:39.115]  The who's what's and when's because he's petrified.
[03:28:39.435 --> 03:28:40.176]  Think about that.
[03:28:40.656 --> 03:28:42.157]  Why would you be that scared?
[03:28:42.177 --> 03:28:43.338]  Especially if you're Corey Feldman.
[03:28:43.478 --> 03:28:44.619]  It's not like you're missing work.
[03:28:45.099 --> 03:28:46.720]  It's not like somebody's not going to give you a gig.
[03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:47.761]  You haven't worked in years.
[03:28:48.658 --> 03:28:50.339]  But he's scared of something.
[03:28:50.779 --> 03:28:51.439]  What is that?
[03:28:51.679 --> 03:28:57.242]  These are powerful, dangerous, sick people that run that town.
[03:28:57.302 --> 03:28:58.762]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:28:58.783 --> 03:29:00.403]  Please stay with us.
[03:29:02.464 --> 03:29:04.005]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[03:29:05.276 --> 03:29:10.600]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:29:10.860 --> 03:29:11.981]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:29:12.241 --> 03:29:14.543]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:29:15.203 --> 03:29:21.728]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:29:21.928 --> 03:29:25.270]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:27.392]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:29:28.032 --> 03:29:36.442]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:29:36.482 --> 03:29:37.423]  They know how great it is.
[03:29:38.345 --> 03:29:42.089]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:29:43.050 --> 03:29:44.451]  Tropic means for the brain.
[03:29:45.232 --> 03:29:53.097]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[03:29:59.381 --> 03:29:59.741]  That comes to $50.99.
[03:30:06.005 --> 03:30:06.625]  Zero three.
[03:30:06.645 --> 03:30:09.166]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:30:09.586 --> 03:30:12.727]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:30:12.767 --> 03:30:13.728]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:31:35.279 --> 03:31:35.779]  And more.
[03:31:36.260 --> 03:31:36.880]  Concentrate.
[03:31:36.900 --> 03:31:38.702]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:31:38.962 --> 03:31:40.363]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:31:40.383 --> 03:31:42.225]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:31:42.645 --> 03:31:43.526]  It's incredible.
[03:31:43.986 --> 03:31:45.908]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:31:46.088 --> 03:31:48.050]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.590]  Incredible.
[03:31:48.930 --> 03:31:49.811]  It is amazing.
[03:31:50.171 --> 03:31:51.432]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:52.213 --> 03:31:52.994]  50% off Caveman.
[03:31:53.214 --> 03:31:54.535]  But only a few days left.
[03:31:54.795 --> 03:31:55.536]  It's about to end.
[03:31:56.136 --> 03:31:58.477]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:31:58.897 --> 03:32:04.079]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:32:04.499 --> 03:32:05.880]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:32:06.140 --> 03:32:07.300]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:08.501]  I want to thank you.
[03:32:08.821 --> 03:32:09.881]  We're all in this together.

[03:33:05.592 --> 03:33:08.195]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.773 --> 03:33:23.039]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.585 --> 03:33:31.246]  Welcome back.
[03:33:31.746 --> 03:33:32.366]  How are you doing?
[03:33:32.807 --> 03:33:34.749]  Anthony Comea in at Infowars.com.
[03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:43.256]  Yeah, there's a connection, too, between Hollywood and Washington.
[03:33:44.817 --> 03:33:49.780]  Man, do politicians love celebrities, don't they?
[03:33:50.641 --> 03:33:54.803]  How many pictures have we seen of politicians with Harvey Weinstein?
[03:33:55.704 --> 03:34:02.008]  And they seem to go hand-in-hand.
[03:34:02.028 --> 03:34:09.874]  You watch these award shows and all you see are celebrities getting up there and giving their political views.
[03:34:10.569 --> 03:34:13.931]  Which I think, I could go out on a limb and say, a little left-leaning.
[03:34:14.472 --> 03:34:16.353]  Just a little left-leaning.
[03:34:17.234 --> 03:34:19.776]  We saw Eminem the other day.
[03:34:19.796 --> 03:34:23.378]  Oh my God, was this embarrassing.
[03:34:24.199 --> 03:34:28.662]  I'm on Twitter and I see, oh Eminem, really?
[03:34:28.782 --> 03:34:31.844]  Wow, did he just tear up Donald Trump.
[03:34:32.445 --> 03:34:33.986]  Oh my God, look out.
[03:34:34.486 --> 03:34:35.207]  He's back.
[03:34:36.027 --> 03:34:36.988]  Shady's back.
[03:34:39.086 --> 03:34:40.687]  And he's tearing up Donald Trump.
[03:34:41.007 --> 03:34:43.048]  So I'm like, alright, I'll watch this.
[03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:47.311]  Right from the get-go, it was so embarrassing.
[03:34:47.871 --> 03:34:50.833]  First of all, he's what, mid-40s now?
[03:34:51.033 --> 03:34:52.474]  He's like 44 or something like that?
[03:34:53.314 --> 03:34:57.357]  And there he is, he's in a parking garage.
[03:34:58.061 --> 03:35:02.062]  With some, uh, like, thuggish dudes behind him and stuff.
[03:35:02.382 --> 03:35:06.043]  Like, this might work if you're in your... your twenties still.
[03:35:06.643 --> 03:35:09.124]  It just kinda looks silly at this point.
[03:35:09.584 --> 03:35:14.645]  That this guy in his mid-forties... It's like when you see, uh, guys in their mid-forties, like, skateboarding.
[03:35:14.665 --> 03:35:18.026]  Like, alright, if you enjoy it and everything, that's one thing.
[03:35:18.046 --> 03:35:18.626]  That's fine.
[03:35:19.126 --> 03:35:22.347]  But, uh... Ehhh... Don't make that your thing.
[03:35:23.217 --> 03:35:27.139]  Don't go out into public and make it your thing, because you're kind of going to look silly.
[03:35:27.379 --> 03:35:36.403]  So when you get Eminem up there and he's spitting some rhymes, yo, it comes off looking very silly.
[03:35:36.803 --> 03:35:44.066]  And the whole gist of this thing was how awful and terrible Donald Trump is.
[03:35:44.707 --> 03:35:51.950]  The bravery, the bravery of Eminem to come out against Donald Trump at a time like this.
[03:35:53.550 --> 03:36:04.021]  It could be the hackiest thing people do in the entertainment industry now is to do any material about Donald Trump.
[03:36:05.396 --> 03:36:06.796]  I personally don't get it.
[03:36:07.096 --> 03:36:33.862]  Whether you like or don't like Donald Trump's policies, whether you think he's not that smart or not a good speaker or anything, you could have all these opinions about him, but I've yet to get a rational answer from anyone on the left what he's done so wrong and what his motivations are for becoming the president.
[03:36:34.964 --> 03:36:37.206]  And doing the job of the president.
[03:36:37.486 --> 03:36:38.666]  Because I see this.
[03:36:39.907 --> 03:36:50.214]  I see a man who got very wealthy and successful utilizing the opportunities that are given everyone in this country.
[03:36:50.654 --> 03:36:52.815]  Did he have a father that gave him money?
[03:36:52.875 --> 03:36:54.196]  I know that's a big issue.
[03:36:54.636 --> 03:36:54.957]  Sure.
[03:36:56.598 --> 03:36:58.619]  Do some people start out
[03:36:59.934 --> 03:37:03.515]  With a little more than others on their road to success?
[03:37:03.915 --> 03:37:04.955]  Indeed they do.
[03:37:05.496 --> 03:37:08.896]  That's part of the freedoms of this country.
[03:37:09.557 --> 03:37:11.517]  Not everyone starts out the same.
[03:37:12.177 --> 03:37:13.718]  Not everyone ends up the same.
[03:37:14.178 --> 03:37:16.678]  Some people use more skill than luck.
[03:37:17.178 --> 03:37:18.639]  With others it's the other way around.
[03:37:18.879 --> 03:37:21.219]  That's the amazing thing about this country.
[03:37:21.740 --> 03:37:27.041]  Is that there is the possibility for anyone to do well.
[03:37:27.782 --> 03:37:40.433]  You're not just born and thrust into a rice paddy or soldering together iPhones, knowing that that's going to be your life.
[03:37:41.613 --> 03:37:45.176]  And wherever you are, that's what you're going to continue doing till you drop dead.
[03:37:46.377 --> 03:37:49.520]  No, we have the opportunity in this country to do great things.
[03:37:50.121 --> 03:37:55.425]  And all I see in our president, Donald Trump, is the want
[03:37:58.464 --> 03:38:00.665]  To give that opportunity to everybody.
[03:38:02.525 --> 03:38:04.126]  Of course, he's called racist all the time.
[03:38:06.106 --> 03:38:09.087]  And I ask, and I want a rational answer, but I can never get it.
[03:38:09.507 --> 03:38:14.989]  What has he done that shows what a racist he is?
[03:38:15.869 --> 03:38:23.172]  For some reason, for 35, 40 years in the public eye, he was never called a racist.
[03:38:24.172 --> 03:38:27.393]  I mean, this guy's been on TV, he's been
[03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:34.252]  A contractor, a builder, for decades, no one ever called him a racist.
[03:38:34.492 --> 03:38:36.592]  All of a sudden, he's a racist.
[03:38:37.092 --> 03:38:41.433]  And of course, Eminem slams Trump and calls him a racist.
[03:38:42.394 --> 03:38:43.834]  He's a sexist.
[03:38:44.654 --> 03:38:45.735]  Always sexist.
[03:38:45.835 --> 03:38:46.575]  It's terrible.
[03:38:47.135 --> 03:38:51.396]  He's a man who enjoys the company of pretty women.
[03:38:51.416 --> 03:38:53.797]  You know what that makes him?
[03:38:54.277 --> 03:38:54.757]  A man.
[03:38:55.931 --> 03:38:57.012]  That makes him a man.
[03:38:57.352 --> 03:38:59.273]  Or what a man used to be, I believe.
[03:38:59.553 --> 03:39:01.194]  You're not even allowed to do that anymore.
[03:39:01.534 --> 03:39:13.782]  But the accusations that I see from the left coming out about Donald Trump, they never have a rational discussion with me about why he's labeled these things.
[03:39:14.742 --> 03:39:16.303]  Did he say some inappropriate stuff?
[03:39:16.924 --> 03:39:17.424]  Sure.
[03:39:18.104 --> 03:39:24.248]  If you look at what men talk about as inappropriate stuff, because that's all he was doing,
[03:39:24.947 --> 03:39:27.189]  Anyone that says different, again, is lying.
[03:39:28.349 --> 03:39:33.813]  Many men talk this way about women and their sexploits over the years.
[03:39:33.853 --> 03:39:35.994]  Guys will discuss things like that.
[03:39:36.475 --> 03:39:41.258]  But I see a president in Donald Trump that just wants to make things better for this country.
[03:39:41.878 --> 03:39:42.359]  And he is.
[03:39:43.259 --> 03:39:44.360]  He's doing just that.
[03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:46.121]  But the left can't take it.
[03:39:46.161 --> 03:39:53.186]  So the likes of Eminem and a lot of these actors and actresses that are crying.
[03:39:53.686 --> 03:39:54.387]  I've seen
[03:39:55.294 --> 03:40:01.377]  Genuine tears come out of people's eyes when they just talk about Donald Trump.
[03:40:01.397 --> 03:40:03.438]  I was watching a clip the other day, it was hilarious.
[03:40:03.718 --> 03:40:16.985]  I guess it was some Antifa people and some gentleman from Infowars was questioning some of these people, asking about Donald Trump and what these people were even protesting.
[03:40:17.525 --> 03:40:24.709]  A woman ran away, ran away from the microphone, from this gentleman's inquiry.
[03:40:25.612 --> 03:40:26.433]  In tears!
[03:40:27.613 --> 03:40:35.297]  And I'm just laughing my ass off at this point because that really epitomizes what they're all about.
[03:40:35.918 --> 03:40:37.479]  They give you no answers.
[03:40:38.319 --> 03:40:40.060]  You cannot get a straight answer.
[03:40:40.140 --> 03:40:43.062]  Yeah, this is so... Look at this girl right here.
[03:40:44.242 --> 03:40:45.543]  Look at the one in the back.
[03:40:46.003 --> 03:40:47.684]  She's already choking up.
[03:40:49.305 --> 03:40:51.266]  And she runs off crying.
[03:40:53.924 --> 03:40:55.045]  It's astounding!
[03:40:55.486 --> 03:41:06.334]  But that epitomizes what we see when the left is addressing politics and Donald Trump and what they want.
[03:41:07.175 --> 03:41:08.916]  They scream about impeachment.
[03:41:09.597 --> 03:41:13.740]  We see Maxine Waters constantly now screaming about impeachment.
[03:41:14.101 --> 03:41:17.503]  This woman is out of her mind!
[03:41:18.864 --> 03:41:19.465]  Out of her mind!
[03:41:20.806 --> 03:41:28.888]  And she's screaming about impeachment when there's nothing that indicates that this president can legally be impeached.
[03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:31.349]  Yet it's her mantra now.
[03:41:31.709 --> 03:41:35.710]  It's her battle cry that we need to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:41:35.970 --> 03:41:38.291]  And then again, you ask these people why?
[03:41:38.851 --> 03:41:39.391]  For what?
[03:41:40.092 --> 03:41:45.693]  And they have no reason whatsoever, aside from my feels.
[03:41:46.514 --> 03:41:48.074]  My emos are hurt.
[03:41:48.985 --> 03:41:50.366]  And then you dig a little deeper.
[03:41:50.426 --> 03:41:53.329]  Well, can you give me an example?
[03:41:53.749 --> 03:41:55.671]  And they run off in tears.
[03:41:57.012 --> 03:41:58.113]  You have to laugh.
[03:41:58.494 --> 03:41:59.455]  You have to laugh.
[03:42:00.756 --> 03:42:06.942]  I'm wondering if after a few more years, I'll start actually feeling sorry for them.
[03:42:07.642 --> 03:42:10.044]  We're almost at a year, people.
[03:42:10.645 --> 03:42:12.787]  We are almost at the one year mark.
[03:42:13.627 --> 03:42:19.548]  Where, uh, we recall the first real tears of the left in the Javits Center.
[03:42:20.208 --> 03:42:28.650]  When Hillary Rodham Clinton, uh, did not show up to console her people, uh, after the election.
[03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:31.550]  Uh, I can't believe it's almost been a year.
[03:42:31.610 --> 03:42:33.251]  Next month, the beginning of next month is a year.
[03:42:33.791 --> 03:42:36.811]  And, um, the tears have not stopped!
[03:42:38.051 --> 03:42:40.812]  It's been a year-long cry fest!
[03:42:41.798 --> 03:42:45.020]  You ever see a child having a temper tantrum in a store?
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:48.061]  They don't want to be there with mommy or something, and they cry?
[03:42:49.262 --> 03:42:53.804]  Imagine that kid kicking and screaming and crying on the floor for a year!
[03:42:53.824 --> 03:42:55.385]  And it's not gonna end.
[03:42:55.405 --> 03:43:01.368]  We're gonna see this temper tantrum for at least three more years, perhaps even longer, I hope.
[03:43:01.388 --> 03:43:01.909]  We'll be back.
[03:43:02.829 --> 03:43:04.370]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[03:43:05.632 --> 03:43:10.955]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:43:11.235 --> 03:43:14.917]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:43:15.578 --> 03:43:22.081]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States, we've been able to get it for less.
[03:43:22.302 --> 03:43:25.623]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[03:43:25.944 --> 03:43:27.745]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:43:28.385 --> 03:43:36.816]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:43:36.836 --> 03:43:37.797]  They know how great it is.
[03:43:38.718 --> 03:43:42.523]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:43:43.324 --> 03:43:44.766]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:43:45.607 --> 03:43:53.469]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[03:44:02.931 --> 03:44:05.352]  That comes to $50.03.
[03:44:05.492 --> 03:44:09.553]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:44:09.953 --> 03:44:12.853]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:44:15.274 --> 03:44:16.135]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:45:27.194 --> 03:45:36.039]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[03:45:36.619 --> 03:45:37.239]  Concentrate.
[03:45:37.279 --> 03:45:39.061]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:45:39.321 --> 03:45:40.742]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:45:41.002 --> 03:45:42.603]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:45:43.003 --> 03:45:43.883]  It's incredible.
[03:45:44.364 --> 03:45:46.265]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:45:46.445 --> 03:45:47.606]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:45:48.066 --> 03:45:48.967]  At 15, incredible.
[03:45:49.287 --> 03:45:50.167]  It is amazing.
[03:45:50.528 --> 03:45:52.249]  Infowarslife.com.

[03:45:56.491 --> 03:45:58.832]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:45:59.272 --> 03:46:04.435]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:46:04.855 --> 03:46:06.256]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:46:06.516 --> 03:46:07.656]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:46:08.057 --> 03:46:08.857]  I want to thank you.
[03:46:09.197 --> 03:46:10.238]  We're all in this together.

[03:48:30.658 --> 03:48:46.764]  I am very skeptical.
[03:48:47.204 --> 03:48:49.365]  I'm just a natural born skeptic.
[03:48:49.765 --> 03:48:51.986]  I'm from that, what is that, Occam's Razor?
[03:48:52.086 --> 03:48:52.847]  Is that what they call it?
[03:48:53.147 --> 03:48:55.948]  If something seems like this is what happened,
[03:48:56.602 --> 03:48:57.943]  That's probably what happened.
[03:48:58.523 --> 03:48:59.524]  I'm kind of one of those guys.
[03:49:00.224 --> 03:49:10.469]  It's very tough to convince me that something is different than what obviously could have happened.
[03:49:12.330 --> 03:49:16.252]  I do not feel this way about the Las Vegas shooting.
[03:49:18.053 --> 03:49:22.895]  Something is amiss with this entire story.
[03:49:24.525 --> 03:49:25.326]  Uh, of course.
[03:49:26.207 --> 03:49:28.771]  Uh, we, we, we know Steven, uh, Steven Paddock.
[03:49:29.813 --> 03:49:30.294]  Uh, there it is.
[03:49:30.454 --> 03:49:31.235]  Occam's Razor.
[03:49:31.896 --> 03:49:37.305]  Yeah, it's just, uh, it's, it's whatever the obvious explanation is.
[03:49:38.572 --> 03:49:39.934]  Is pretty much what it is.
[03:49:39.974 --> 03:49:44.397]  In other words, yeah, the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation is.
[03:49:44.978 --> 03:49:47.199]  And I believe in this.
[03:49:47.380 --> 03:49:49.441]  I think I adhere to this more than not.
[03:49:50.222 --> 03:49:55.386]  But again, this situation in Las Vegas is bizarre.
[03:49:56.087 --> 03:50:00.710]  I don't know why more people aren't talking about this.
[03:50:01.791 --> 03:50:07.496]  And I honestly think when you have something like we do with social media these days, you would think
[03:50:08.365 --> 03:50:20.869]  That the ability to exchange ideas and evidence and explanations would make us look into these things more, question more things.
[03:50:21.810 --> 03:50:32.833]  But for some reason, our ability to concentrate on any one thing for any longer than maybe a few days has screwed us up.
[03:50:33.594 --> 03:50:34.834]  We're on to the next thing.
[03:50:35.433 --> 03:50:40.655]  Well, I'm kind of hanging out on this one because nothing makes sense.
[03:50:41.976 --> 03:50:45.957]  There are so many loose ends with this story.
[03:50:46.918 --> 03:51:02.965]  Of course, the official story is that Steven Paddock went up into his room and started shooting out the window at a concert, killed a bunch of people, wounded a bunch of others, shot himself.
[03:51:03.145 --> 03:51:03.765]  End of story.
[03:51:06.045 --> 03:51:08.886]  Nothing is making sense on this one.
[03:51:08.926 --> 03:51:10.347]  The timeline is now different.
[03:51:10.907 --> 03:51:17.909]  He supposedly shot a security guard after he shot a bunch of the concert goers.
[03:51:19.570 --> 03:51:25.692]  And that tipped off the police, who then came in, breached the door.
[03:51:26.412 --> 03:51:27.352]  He had killed himself.
[03:51:27.612 --> 03:51:28.313]  That's the story.
[03:51:28.533 --> 03:51:35.255]  Well, now they're saying that Steven Paddock shot the security guard before he unloaded on the crowd.
[03:51:37.298 --> 03:51:38.899]  How do you make that mistake?
[03:51:39.199 --> 03:51:45.483]  And how does that go unexplained or unresolved for days?
[03:51:46.204 --> 03:51:47.624]  For days and days on end.
[03:51:48.025 --> 03:51:51.967]  All of a sudden the story changes and is completely different.
[03:51:54.408 --> 03:52:00.472]  How is it that Steven Paddock's house gets broken into the other day?
[03:52:02.073 --> 03:52:03.534]  Someone broke into his house.
[03:52:04.178 --> 03:52:05.118]  Through the front door.
[03:52:05.498 --> 03:52:06.159]  They don't know who.
[03:52:06.399 --> 03:52:07.239]  They didn't catch anyone.
[03:52:08.439 --> 03:52:09.240]  They got no leads.
[03:52:10.500 --> 03:52:12.461]  It completely contaminates his house.
[03:52:12.861 --> 03:52:15.802]  And you might think, well, the FBI obviously searched his house.
[03:52:16.342 --> 03:52:25.985]  Well, hypothetically, what if another piece of evidence leads them to need to look a little closer inside this guy's house?
[03:52:26.986 --> 03:52:33.668]  All of a sudden, anything you find or don't find is possibly tainted.
[03:52:35.060 --> 03:52:35.981]  How did that happen?
[03:52:36.301 --> 03:52:36.841]  And why?
[03:52:37.822 --> 03:52:40.824]  There are so many loose ends to this story.
[03:52:41.605 --> 03:52:43.326]  Reports of multiple gunmen.
[03:52:44.347 --> 03:52:48.610]  Sound analysis of the shots that imply that there were multiple gunmen.
[03:52:50.512 --> 03:52:52.233]  Why so many guns in the room?
[03:52:53.114 --> 03:52:54.174]  And the biggest thing.
[03:52:55.655 --> 03:52:57.096]  I've been to Las Vegas.
[03:52:57.377 --> 03:52:58.878]  I've been to Atlantic City.
[03:52:58.918 --> 03:53:01.520]  I've been to other places where there are casinos.
[03:53:03.104 --> 03:53:10.271]  Could possibly be the most surveilled place, places on the face of the Earth.
[03:53:11.071 --> 03:53:16.557]  There is, is, I have yet to see one frame of this guy.
[03:53:17.317 --> 03:53:19.459]  I've seen maybe two pictures.
[03:53:20.220 --> 03:53:23.743]  One where he looks pretty goofy, and another one where he's in a bar, I think.
[03:53:24.804 --> 03:53:26.666]  But these were pictures that people took of him.
[03:53:27.166 --> 03:53:28.788]  I've yet to see one frame.
[03:53:30.268 --> 03:53:34.370]  Of surveillance footage of this gentleman.
[03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:51.077]  Yet, in 2001, we saw the next day after 9-11, we saw Mohammed Atta going through security at Logan Airport.
[03:53:51.537 --> 03:53:53.798]  And in 2017, at a casino?
[03:53:53.818 --> 03:53:57.179]  I have yet to see one frame of this guy?
[03:53:58.860 --> 03:53:59.140]  Again,
[03:53:59.924 --> 03:54:03.125]  I don't know what that means, but it sure means something.
[03:54:05.366 --> 03:54:16.309]  I don't understand why we're not getting more information from the police, from the FBI.
[03:54:17.049 --> 03:54:18.589]  Who is this guy?
[03:54:19.209 --> 03:54:20.630]  What was the motivation?
[03:54:21.890 --> 03:54:24.931]  Why does he have this Philippines connection?
[03:54:26.368 --> 03:54:28.229]  We don't hear any more about the money, he said.
[03:54:28.629 --> 03:54:32.051]  We hear this insanity from his brother.
[03:54:33.651 --> 03:54:39.934]  And all of it just gets swept away and then we're all, you know, hashtag Harvey Weinstein.
[03:54:41.215 --> 03:54:45.257]  And hashtag Vegas shooting gets thrown in the bin with Kony 2012.
[03:54:48.559 --> 03:54:55.722]  We really need people like Alex Jones and InfoWars to stick to this story.
[03:54:56.873 --> 03:54:59.314]  And try to get some kind of answers.
[03:55:00.615 --> 03:55:03.437]  It doesn't, it's not making sense.
[03:55:04.157 --> 03:55:19.805]  We've, I'm certain we've seen instances of actual lunatics, for no reason then they're insane, that have gone and murdered people and taken their own life or what have you.
[03:55:20.546 --> 03:55:22.607]  This does not look like that.
[03:55:23.570 --> 03:55:29.112]  There's way too much going on here that we're not getting an explanation for.
[03:55:29.972 --> 03:55:36.554]  You know, the things we know and don't know, what happened in the six minutes after the hotel security guard was shot?
[03:55:37.774 --> 03:55:45.056]  Well, the police have their theory, but it doesn't jibe with other timelines of the shooting.
[03:55:46.377 --> 03:55:50.898]  Why weren't there the number of shell casings there should have been?
[03:55:52.336 --> 03:55:59.362]  Why did this guy take his life apparently before the police were even alerted to where he was?
[03:56:02.324 --> 03:56:03.985]  Was he the only one in the room?
[03:56:05.707 --> 03:56:06.907]  How did he get all those guns up?
[03:56:07.048 --> 03:56:08.208]  Why take so many guns?
[03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:09.830]  He didn't use every gun.
[03:56:10.650 --> 03:56:12.312]  Why have so many guns in that room?
[03:56:13.593 --> 03:56:17.296]  Was he supposed to meet somebody or some other group of people?
[03:56:18.476 --> 03:56:20.238]  Was it an arms deal gone bad?
[03:56:21.764 --> 03:56:29.612]  Did he get converted to something, alright, Islam, over the course of some of his travels?
[03:56:30.353 --> 03:56:34.957]  His airplane at a government site?
[03:56:36.379 --> 03:56:44.687]  Like, none of this is your run-of-the-mill, if I could say that, shooting by just some lunatic.
[03:56:45.532 --> 03:56:47.293]  They actually checked his brain out, too.
[03:56:47.313 --> 03:56:47.874]  Isn't that sick?
[03:56:48.354 --> 03:56:49.355]  They cut him open, you know.
[03:56:49.515 --> 03:57:00.342]  They checked his brain out, and apparently nothing in there that indicated he had any medical problems that would have led him to just snap and do that.
[03:57:01.443 --> 03:57:12.951]  So, again, I strongly suggest we pay attention to this and keep tabs on what is, and sometimes more importantly, what isn't
[03:57:13.692 --> 03:57:18.358]  Being said by law enforcement to the people.
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:29.013]  And when you see something pop up like the Weinstein thing that distracts us, don't be so distracted.
[03:57:29.864 --> 03:57:32.267]  Keep your eyes and ears open all the time.
[03:57:32.968 --> 03:57:41.959]  Anthony Comea, you can catch me on compoundmedia.com, the Artie Lange and Anthony Comea Show on Compound Media, Monday through Thursday, 4 p.m.
