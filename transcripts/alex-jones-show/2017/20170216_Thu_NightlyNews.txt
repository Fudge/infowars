[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.817]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.518]  It's Thursday, February 16th.
[00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:23.659]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:24.900]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:27.883]  Tonight.
[00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:35.569]  Is the Oroville Dam deliberately neglected so they can make a case for removing not only the dam, but the farmers?
[00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:42.855]  A California cattle rancher and editorial writer makes the case that this negligence was a deliberate push for Agenda 21.
[00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:47.038]  It says right in the bill that
[00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.978]  Fish barriers must be removed.
[00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:51.321]  Guys, what's a fish barrier?
[00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:53.597]  I think?
[00:00:54.257 --> 00:01:03.500]  And Trump takes the fight against globalism to the people again, with a press conference today, a rally coming to Florida, and perhaps even a charity rally in the UK.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.301]  And in Fukushima, six years after the initial event, radiation levels are rising in so high that even the robot malfunctioned.
[00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:14.482]  But what it saw before it died is even scarier.
[00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:14.962]  Warning!
[00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.243]  Biophysical experiments extremely dangerous to Earth people.
[00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:21.164]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:10.939]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you've been living in reality, you know that life is like a science fiction novel.
[00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:18.224]  But for some of the snowflakes on the left, well, it's been a little tough to accept some of the realities that have come to the forefront here recently.
[00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:20.446]  In fact, they're even trying to deny them.
[00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:23.848]  But Bloomberg has the answer for you.
[00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:25.569]  This is a story from Bloomberg today.
[00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.733]  How to stay sane in a world of crazy news.
[00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:31.294]  That's right.
[00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:32.795]  Reality is crazy.
[00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:33.915]  Not you.
[00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:36.697]  Another day, another firestorm.
[00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:40.640]  Nine experts on ways to keep up and keep your head from exploding.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.180]  I love this.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.981]  Nine experts.
[00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.864]  These are the same experts that told you Hillary Clinton was going to win.
[00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:48.445]  I wonder what they're really experts at.
[00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:49.545]  Probably fake news.
[00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.027]  They say life comes at you fast.
[00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:54.889]  Really, reality comes at you fast these days.
[00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.630]  It seems at the speed of light.
[00:03:57.762 --> 00:04:02.966]  But this first month alone has been a blizzard of executive orders, presidential tweets, they can't stand those.
[00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:05.909]  See, the executive orders Obama did too, so they can't complain too much.
[00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.335]  And momentous events, among them an immigration order that created havoc at airports before being blocked in court.
[00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:18.939]  Dozens of large protest marches, anarchists in the streets of Berkeley.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.821]  So, but here's the thing about this, folks.
[00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:23.635]  They say that this is an immigration order.
[00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:29.240]  They always do this little play on words, and we're going to have other stories covering this too, especially out of time.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.561]  The fake news does us the best.
[00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:40.049]  But the reason why there's these protests, the reason why there's these anarchists in the streets, the reason why there's all this civil unrest is because of your fake news!
[00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.033]  So what they want to do here is first they tell you that it's crazy how all this news is coming at you because they haven't lived in reality their whole lives.
[00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:51.314]  So then they try to say it's okay, it's all Trump's fault.
[00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.635]  Trump is the reason why you're marching in the streets.
[00:04:53.915 --> 00:04:56.256]  Trump is the reason why all this news is so crazy.
[00:04:57.236 --> 00:05:01.319]  No, that's just reality, Bloomberg, but they don't want to tell it to you like that.
[00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.903]  Before we get to time, though, it's very important that we inject this into the conversation.
[00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:13.068]  Daily presidential tracking polls has Donald Trump moving up again on his approval rating.
[00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.370]  Now, 55% of likely U.S.
[00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.173]  voters approve of Donald Trump's job so far.
[00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:23.817]  This is a sharp rise for the middle of February, so I guess, Bloomberg,
[00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:30.939]  People really can handle these insane news that you're telling your audience how to handle.
[00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.599]  So I'm just not sure.
[00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.940]  The news was crazy before Donald Trump was president.
[00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:38.141]  It's going to continue to be crazy.
[00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:43.143]  The difference is the mainstream media and the liberal media didn't report it.
[00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:44.723]  Now they have to.
[00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:47.104]  Now let's take a look at Time Magazine, folks.
[00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.825]  Time Magazine came out with a new cover.
[00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:50.825]  They debuted it today.
[00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:54.887]  Time's new cover, Inside Donald Trump's White House Chaos.
[00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:59.649]  And they made this little GIF and the cover, it looks like Donald Trump is in a storm.
[00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:00.569]  You can see it there.
[00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.570]  Nothing to see here.
[00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:11.475]  Of course, the most ironic thing, as they've been covering for the presidential administrations of the past, saying nothing to see here.
[00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:14.297]  Nothing to see here with the Obama fake birth certificate.
[00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:19.441]  Nothing to see here with the creation of ISIS under the Obama regime and the Clinton State Department.
[00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:20.582]  Nothing to see here.
[00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:26.346]  Just Donald Trump, who by the way, is the most transparent president you've ever seen in your life.
[00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:29.969]  He doesn't sign an executive order without putting it in front of all the media.
[00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:32.743]  He had a two-hour press conference today.
[00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:33.624]  We'll talk about that later.
[00:06:33.804 --> 00:06:35.626]  But here's the hit piece from Time.
[00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:38.228]  Inside Donald Trump's White House, chaos!
[00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:39.269]  It's chaos!
[00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:42.773]  Donald Trump mastered the art of disruption!
[00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:43.574]  Oh!
[00:06:43.894 --> 00:06:46.456]  They're saying Donald Trump is the master of the art of disruption.
[00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:46.957]  You're right!
[00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:50.120]  He's disrupting the Washington, D.C.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.981]  establishment.
[00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:52.242]  That's what he's disrupting.
[00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:53.864]  That's the truth that needs to be reported.
[00:06:53.924 --> 00:06:54.825]  Time isn't going to tell you.
[00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:56.826]  But disruption in government?
[00:06:57.246 --> 00:06:59.547]  The rule maker breaking the rules!
[00:07:00.068 --> 00:07:04.870]  Actually, no, it turned out that the executive order you're referencing on the travel ban is completely legal.
[00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.031]  Okay, nice try.
[00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.533]  But it turns out to be more costly.
[00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:12.975]  Toppling the temple can be painful if you try it from inside.
[00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:19.579]  So here they are admitting that there's corruption inside of the temple or the White House.
[00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.300]  That's what they're referring to here.
[00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:23.306]  And it's what Chuck Summers said.
[00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.087]  Oh well, you better watch out.
[00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.348]  The intelligence agency can get back at you.
[00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:36.192]  So here's Donald Trump trying to disrupt the Washington establishment and then time is like, oh well, you know, this is not good.
[00:07:36.252 --> 00:07:38.313]  You can't disrupt the establishment from inside.
[00:07:38.373 --> 00:07:39.574]  It's going to crumble down on you.
[00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:47.039]  As it's actually happening with resignations like Mike Flynn, and then Chuck Schumer saying the intelligence agencies can get back at you.
[00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:52.202]  So, Time is basically admitting it here out of the side of their mouth how corrupt Washington, D.C.
[00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:55.725]  is, but Trump is the bad guy somehow in this, even though he just got in.
[00:07:56.585 --> 00:08:12.181]  Judges in four courts froze a hastily, I love how they always have to interject these little verbs to make it seem like it's something it's not, hastily issued an executive order barring certain immigrants, wrong, totally wrong, that is fake news, from entering the country.
[00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.183]  It's not whether you're an immigrant or not an immigrant.
[00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:19.028]  It's a travel ban from seven countries to try to vet people from coming here so that they're not terrorists.
[00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:21.108]  It has nothing to do with stopping Muslims.
[00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:22.689]  It has nothing to do with stopping immigrants.
[00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:28.010]  It's a travel ban to try to vet people so that they're not terrorists coming into this country.
[00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:28.970]  It's that simple.
[00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:37.652]  But, the propaganda from Time goes on, and we've actually, pun fully intended, we've got a timeline of their propaganda.
[00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:40.913]  Let's go ahead and look at how Time has covered Donald Trump.
[00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:44.673]  This goes back, the first story here on the cover.
[00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:45.914]  Bully, check.
[00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:47.234]  Showman, check.
[00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:49.477]  Party Crasher, check.
[00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:50.638]  Demagogue, check.
[00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:52.880]  President of the United States, oh.
[00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.383]  Oh, they didn't want to check that one, but you can go ahead and check that.
[00:08:56.423 --> 00:08:59.385]  But that was the first article they tried to hit Donald on.
[00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.166]  Then they went to the next one.
[00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:01.507]  Meltdown!
[00:09:01.787 --> 00:09:02.288]  You remember this one?
[00:09:02.568 --> 00:09:02.928]  Meltdown!
[00:09:02.948 --> 00:09:04.390]  Donald Trump is in a meltdown!
[00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.371]  No, you're melting down.
[00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:06.331]  No, wait, I'm wrong!
[00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:07.853]  It's a total meltdown!
[00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.235]  Oh, Donald Trump is in a total meltdown!
[00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:11.496]  No, Times, you're in a total meltdown.
[00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:11.996]  The Mainstream News.
[00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:13.457]  And then what did Times have to do?
[00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:15.858]  Person of the Year.
[00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:18.519]  Aww, Little Time Magazine.
[00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:19.619]  But that's okay.
[00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.180]  They weren't done with the propaganda yet.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.880]  They wanted to push the pussy hats.
[00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:25.861]  The resistance rises.
[00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:27.241]  How a march became a movement.
[00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:28.001]  Not.
[00:09:28.241 --> 00:09:28.962]  What movement?
[00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:29.862]  There's been nothing.
[00:09:30.142 --> 00:09:32.282]  Oh, and by the way, Time, your fake news.
[00:09:32.703 --> 00:09:37.284]  You tweeted that an Olympic athlete was detained because of Trump's travel ban.
[00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:38.984]  Fake news.
[00:09:39.004 --> 00:09:39.604]  100% fake news.
[00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:43.786]  And here's the truth of the matter, folks.
[00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:53.832]  The reason why Trump implemented this travel ban is so we don't end up like Paris, France, where riots are now reaching the Capitol Center, buildings on fire, police being attacked, riots in the streets.
[00:09:53.932 --> 00:09:56.254]  It's a widespread thing happening now.
[00:09:56.514 --> 00:10:00.837]  They're trying to scapegoat this whole thing and say it's a riot over the police alleged rape of a
[00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:02.638]  Young black man named Theo.
[00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:06.579]  That's kind of all hearsay right now and it looks like that's going to be the cover-up.
[00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:16.884]  But really this is just civil unrest because of migrants being forced into the area and the socio-economic unrest that's been coming down from their government.
[00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:19.105]  Here's a report from Ashley Beckford.
[00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.706]  Now they don't want to cover this news, but they also don't want to have Donald Trump on Twitter.
[00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:23.747]  They're trying to censor him.
[00:10:24.027 --> 00:10:24.547]  Here's Ashley.
[00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:28.686]  Right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:33.552]  Is Twitter censoring positive replies to Donald Trump's tweets?
[00:10:34.253 --> 00:10:38.358]  Social network ensures only negative responses are seen.
[00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:43.725]  This is breaking news from Paul Joseph Watson on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:45.066]  That's right, folks.
[00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:54.209]  It seems to be that Twitter is actually censoring positive replies to Donald Trump's tweets, and only showing negative responses.
[00:10:54.709 --> 00:11:05.472]  Twitter announced earlier this month that it would be collapsing tweets deemed, quote, low quality, which is a completely subjective definition that is wide to interpretation.
[00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:11.694]  These tweets are now being buried, and the most relevant conversations are being brought forward.
[00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:12.635]  Yeah, right.
[00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:26.867]  This has had the impact of pushing negative replies to the top of the thread after every tweet sent out by Trump, ensuring that the entire conversation is dominated by anti-Trump zealots.
[00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:37.620]  Given that Trump has the support of around half of Americans, you would expect to see at least some of the support for him in the responses to his tweets.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.002]  However, Paul Joseph Watson cites tons of evidence to the contrary.
[00:11:43.082 --> 00:11:54.428]  Twitter continues to move towards becoming a leftist echo chamber, having already banned Milo Yiannopoulos and numerous other conservative commentators and bloggers.
[00:11:55.268 --> 00:12:06.627]  The social network even suggested that it would be ready to ban Trump, the president himself, if he violated Twitter's increasingly stringent rules on hate speech.
[00:12:08.015 --> 00:12:20.307]  These new censorship rules also suspend people from using their accounts if they tweet politically incorrect words like retard or if they insult politicians like John McCain.
[00:12:20.748 --> 00:12:29.477]  Facebook was also forced to admit that it manually censored conservative-friendly topics from appearing in the social network's trending list.
[00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:46.753]  At this point, Twitter and Facebook are the absolute models for how the left wants the entire internet to operate, where any dissenting opinions are labeled hate speech, harassment or abuse, and such thought crimes are purged from existence.
[00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:51.776]  The whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought.
[00:12:53.557 --> 00:12:54.697]  To narrow the range of thought.
[00:12:54.837 --> 00:12:59.140]  In the end, we'll make thought crime literally impossible because there'll be no words to express it.
[00:13:00.253 --> 00:13:06.298]  This is Orwellian to a T. They are literally shoving your tweets down the memory hole.
[00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:09.761]  Are you going to accept the loss of your First Amendment?
[00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:16.367]  If you lose that, folks, the rest of the Bill of Rights and Constitution will fall in line like dominoes.
[00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:22.010]  The press, journalism, it's the only occupation enshrined in the Constitution.
[00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.913]  Because information protects people from a descent into tyranny.
[00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.074]  That's why I'm in the Infowar.
[00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:32.936]  As Alex Jones always says, you are the resistance.
[00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:34.517]  You are the new media.
[00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:45.163]  Reach out to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, at Jack, to voice your concerns about this public forum being manipulated to promote a false narrative.
[00:13:45.464 --> 00:13:48.826]  I'm Ashley Beckford, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:13:50.077 --> 00:13:50.798]  Thank you Ashley.
[00:13:50.938 --> 00:13:53.680]  Here's another story that they're going to want to censor off social media.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.804]  Feds investigating Manchester Alderman Thomas Castantonis.
[00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:05.490]  Now this is a guy who is, his story is going over social media and Leanne McAdoo is going to tell us why.
[00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.191]  Here's Leanne.
[00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:12.190]  Democratic Alderman Thomas Katsintonas of New Hampshire has been served.
[00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:20.895]  Now, federal and state investigators searched the Ward 8 Alderman's home and businesses Tuesday following a months-long criminal financial investigation.
[00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:31.541]  This is according to authorities who executed warrants at four locations, including his home and three businesses, Zoe's Pizza, Grand Slam Pizza, and Tommy K's.
[00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:34.883]  The latter two pizza shops are owned by Katsintonas.
[00:14:35.623 --> 00:14:44.887]  Now, Associate New Hampshire Attorney General Jane Young said that this is just the beginning of the investigation and it will likely take months to analyze all of the information that they are gathering.
[00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:56.853]  She would not say what sparked this investigation or whether Kat Santonis was indeed the target, only that the warrants were executed mid-morning and the search warrants were completed by late afternoon.
[00:14:57.413 --> 00:15:02.336]  No one has been arrested and the search warrants are sealed and not available for public view.
[00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:17.263]  So that's all we know for sure right now, but considering the fact that Katz and Tonis has been pictured with Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, people are already beginning to ask if this is the actual start of real arrests regarding Pizzagate.
[00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:27.990]  Now Leanna's going to talk more about Fukushima later, but what's going on is it's getting worse, and now the robot they sent in, the Scorpion robot mission inside Fukushima reactor, was aborted.
[00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.094]  They sent in this robot to try to get measurements, figured out what was going on.
[00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:35.877]  This is in response to the radiation levels reaching record highs now.
[00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:42.321]  But it's not clear why the robot couldn't get through, whether it be the radiation or the obstacles, but it was aborted.
[00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:58.111]  Now, the $189 billion that they are guessing this was going to take to the expense to clean this up, it looks like it's going to take decades, and I'm not sure if they can even properly estimate how much damage the cost is going to take to actually clean this up.
[00:15:58.131 --> 00:15:59.572]  But Leanne will have more on that later.
[00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:03.355]  We'll also have more on the Oroville Dam later with Millie.
[00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:05.056]  But this is interesting, folks.
[00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:06.216]  It looks like it's getting worse.
[00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:14.839]  There are more rainstorms, more moisture headed into that area, and crews are already working through the night to try to shore up the spillway.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:21.122]  And they're trying to fortify the structure before the next series of storms, which they're forecasting to hit before tomorrow.
[00:16:21.662 --> 00:16:23.743]  And the dam is not looking good right now.
[00:16:23.803 --> 00:16:31.586]  If these storms come and they're strong, the three storm systems will move into Northern California during the next six days, according to the National Weather Service.
[00:16:31.946 --> 00:16:33.087]  Forecasters, however,
[00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:34.108]  All right.
[00:16:48.564 --> 00:16:52.687]  That is taking aim, and they have a graphic here on this one story that kind of explains it.
[00:16:52.787 --> 00:16:55.948]  It shows the moisture heading into Northern California.
[00:16:56.389 --> 00:17:04.694]  Of course, that's where the water will end up, and then flowing down towards Lake Oroville, which is where the dam was spilled over.
[00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:12.559]  And again, they're trying to fix it, but right now, the state of that dam is not good, and Millie Weaver is going to have more on that later.
[00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.122]  Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in the area of California that is impacted
[00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:19.644]  I don't think so.
[00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:42.750]  President to bypass politicians, raise money for British veterans instead.
[00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:55.346]  Reports are swirling that President Donald Trump may hold one of his signature Titanic rallies during his trip to England, using the opportunity to raise money for British veterans and Nigel Farage is fully on board.
[00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:56.567]  And this is amazing because
[00:17:57.248 --> 00:18:08.300]  If Donald Trump does this, it would probably get massive exposure, massive turnouts in England, and it will just be huge to show how Donald Trump is actually uniting the world, not dividing it.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.762]  And of course, Farage supports this.
[00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:16.028]  Now, the UK Parliament doesn't want anything to do with Trump, so he would basically be bypassing them by doing this.
[00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:18.094]  We're good to go.
[00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:05.802]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:07.805]  All four branches of the military.
[00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:09.347]  Combat One.
[00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:20.540]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else but the military?
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:22.994]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.195]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:30.496]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.857]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:47.719]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:01.988]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:08.954]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:18.803]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.265]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.387]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:31.195]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.396]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.557]  That's the key buffer.
[00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:39.500]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.460]  They lower your fertility.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.021]  It's all admitted.
[00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.883]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:46.264]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.064]  It's super secret.
[00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.326]  Twelve years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:55.352]  This is something every M4 Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:01.078]  Whether it's cleaning your guns, or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:06.224]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warriorstore.com.
[00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:10.545]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:13.427]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[00:21:14.188 --> 00:21:18.591]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.673]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:23.335]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:24.536]  How well it works.
[00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.698]  This wound has been open for about five days now.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.000]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.362]  So just to better, safe than sorry.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.189]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, field dress, and nice and clean again.
[00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.775]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.257]  Born in America.
[00:21:50.718 --> 00:21:51.619]  Made in America.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.466]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.401]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.206]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:53.367]  We are here in Austin, Texas, where this march is the Day Without Immigrants March going on right now.
[00:22:53.427 --> 00:22:56.208]  As you can see, there are a lot of people out here holding up signs.
[00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:22.653]  They are protesting Trump's immigration policies.
[00:23:24.334 --> 00:23:30.117]  Are you saying that you want illegal immigrants to be able to stay here in America?
[00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:30.737]  Yes.
[00:23:31.557 --> 00:23:31.757]  Yes.
[00:23:32.418 --> 00:23:42.682]  Or do you think that maybe they should file the proper paperwork to become a legal citizen so they have protected rights?
[00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:44.543]  I really don't have an answer for that.
[00:23:45.283 --> 00:23:47.305]  What do you think the solution should be?
[00:23:47.585 --> 00:23:50.667]  What do you think is the solution you want?
[00:23:51.488 --> 00:23:55.791]  I mean, clearly protest is the only way to go.
[00:23:55.811 --> 00:24:00.514]  Do you know what solution you want, though?
[00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:01.875]  What solution do you want?
[00:24:02.736 --> 00:24:03.977]  I'm protesting.
[00:24:04.998 --> 00:24:08.140]  So the solution he said he wants is just protest.
[00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.042]  No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!
[00:24:12.943 --> 00:24:22.585]  So ma'am, is this a protest to stand in solidarity with immigrants or is it to stand in solidarity with illegal immigrants?
[00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:24.365]  I'm sorry, what was the question?
[00:24:25.006 --> 00:24:32.427]  Is this a protest to stand in solidarity with immigrants as a general, like legal immigrants or illegal immigrants?
[00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:35.928]  I think it's to all immigrants because all of us are immigrants.
[00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:38.368]  Born here or not, we're all immigrants.
[00:24:38.468 --> 00:24:41.889]  This country was created for immigrants by immigrants.
[00:24:42.489 --> 00:25:00.862]  Do you think that there should be more easy access to properly immigrating here so that, you know, immigrants can make sure that they have the same protected bill of rights, constitutional rights, and so that they have protected rights that make sure that they're going to get paid at least a minimum wage?
[00:25:01.262 --> 00:25:10.328]  Do you think that the answer is maybe more ways of legal immigration rather than just letting people illegally immigrate here?
[00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:14.030]  Yes, we should totally make it more easier for them.
[00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:23.372]  So would you agree at least that there should be closed borders to people that are cartel members or that commit crimes or have a history of terrorism?
[00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.152]  Yes, I do.
[00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:27.533]  Ma'am, what brings you out here today?
[00:25:27.553 --> 00:25:30.093]  I am not going to talk to you.
[00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:30.974]  Why not?
[00:25:30.994 --> 00:25:32.854]  The organization is disgusting.
[00:25:33.394 --> 00:25:35.295]  What makes us disgusting, ma'am?
[00:25:36.295 --> 00:25:37.055]  Not talking to you.
[00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.304]  She doesn't know, I guess.
[00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:41.565]  What brings you out here today?
[00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:46.427]  Um, cause I have family that are immigrants and cause I love them.
[00:25:46.707 --> 00:25:47.647]  I support them.
[00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.068]  We all came here equal.
[00:25:50.428 --> 00:25:51.568]  That's what America's for.
[00:25:52.088 --> 00:26:01.512]  Do you think that, you know, they should work through the legal means to become legal so that they can have protected rights, you know, and be protected by the constitution?
[00:26:01.832 --> 00:26:02.332]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:26:02.592 --> 00:26:03.372]  I do believe that.
[00:26:03.692 --> 00:26:07.774]  We are good people and we're just trying to means and just make better for our children.
[00:26:08.394 --> 00:26:13.137]  And I think focusing on just certain races is racist and it's not fair.
[00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:25.183]  After talking to a lot of these Hispanic immigrants and children of immigrants, they actually did agree with a lot of Trump's policies unknowingly when I talked to them about this.
[00:26:25.544 --> 00:26:36.850]  And it just seemed like there were a lot of, you know, white liberal Democrats out here that were deliberately kind of misinforming them on the subject matter because they didn't really seem to have a clear picture of
[00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.931]  I'll see you guys.
[00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:10.394]  Are you embarrassed of Planned Parenthood?
[00:27:10.434 --> 00:27:11.535]  Is that why you're taking the shirt off?
[00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:13.397]  I'm a fundraiser.
[00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:19.725]  We have people who are supposed to speak and it's my job to come out and raise funds so I'm gonna go continue doing my job now.
[00:27:20.185 --> 00:27:23.749]  So you raise funds for Planned Parenthood so that people can have abortions?
[00:27:25.131 --> 00:27:25.732]  That's all I'm gonna say.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:46.315]  Well I'm noticing there's a little bit of an irony and oddity that Planned Parenthood actually has sent people out here to try and sign up people for their services at this immigration march where we have all these Hispanics that are either children of illegals or they themselves might even be illegal.
[00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:52.380]  So I do find that a little bit ironic and that just went over the entire radar of all the people here that were
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.621]  Yelling that Trump is a racist.
[00:27:55.042 --> 00:28:01.246]  Meanwhile, they're not noticing that Planned Parenthood seems to have sent someone out here to sign people up for abortions.
[00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:11.472]  If anything, it seems like that's kind of racist that the Democrats in Planned Parenthood sent people out here during this Immigration Day march to sign people up for abortions.
[00:28:12.873 --> 00:28:15.535]  This is Mellie Weaver signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:18.637]  What is this?
[00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:21.078]  You know, it's supposed to be that they're only supposed to be...
[00:28:23.358 --> 00:28:29.332]  In one case, ICE even lay in wait for undocumented immigrants outside a church hypothermia.
[00:28:29.827 --> 00:28:38.953]  Here they come, the Corporocratic Congress, with a Hail Mary to save the game in the final moments for their owners overseas, the Global Banking Cartel.
[00:28:39.073 --> 00:28:44.616]  The same group that threatened using the Logan Act to bully General Flynn into vacating his job.
[00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:52.561]  The very same Logan Act that would have long ago ensnared their handlers if it had been used at Bilderberg and Davos.
[00:28:53.422 --> 00:28:56.065]  Of course, the Logan Act, Hillary Clinton was fined under it.
[00:28:56.445 --> 00:29:10.864]  And this year, as we reported earlier, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is in attendance here at Bilderberg, which of course is an act of treason against the United States of America because he's still an official in a position of high authority.
[00:29:11.204 --> 00:29:25.552]  Now those Keystone Cop Democrats are even threatening a full-scale investigation of the phone transcripts and emails involved in Flynn's supposed breach of national security involving the discussion of Russian sanctions.
[00:29:25.892 --> 00:29:35.537]  He wants to hide the truth from the American people so he's focusing on the leaks rather than addressing the challenge to our democracy and our security.
[00:29:36.414 --> 00:29:37.195]  It's a deflection.
[00:29:37.455 --> 00:29:40.099]  Deflector-in-chief strikes again.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:54.078]  Ranking member Adam Schiff and I have written to the acting DNI calling for a comprehensive intelligence briefing on Russia, including the unredacted transcripts of Michael Flynn's intercepted conversations with Russian officials.
[00:29:54.505 --> 00:29:58.126]  Have we ever gotten to the bottom of Hillary Clinton's email scandal?
[00:29:58.227 --> 00:30:03.769]  Not to mention Hillary's ignored dealings with the Russians over the American uranium supply?
[00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:04.569]  Well, no.
[00:30:04.889 --> 00:30:21.556]  Ann Coulter boldly describes the Corporacratic Congress' pitiful display of wet feet, as she writes, In the past three weeks, Trump has staffed the White House, sent a dozen cabinet nominees to the Senate, browbeat Boeing into cutting its price on government contracts,
[00:30:21.656 --> 00:30:33.623]  Harangued American CEOs into keeping their plants in the United States, imposed a terrorist travel ban, met with foreign leaders, and nominated a Supreme Court Justice, among many other things.
[00:30:33.823 --> 00:30:36.585]  What have Congressional Republicans been doing?
[00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:41.467]  More than 90% of Congressional Republicans kept their jobs after the 2016 election.
[00:30:42.748 --> 00:30:46.589]  So you can cross staffing an entire branch of government off the list.
[00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.311]  Only the Senate confirms nominees, which they've been doing at a snail's pace.
[00:30:51.591 --> 00:30:56.413]  So they've got loads of free time, and the House has no excuse at all.
[00:30:56.573 --> 00:31:02.615]  President Donald Trump unleashed his growing dismay with the soft coup at the White House today.
[00:31:02.995 --> 00:31:10.618]  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people.
[00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:18.999]  But for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.662]  Russia is fake news.
[00:31:21.722 --> 00:31:23.945]  This is fake news put out by the media.
[00:31:24.846 --> 00:31:26.988]  I can handle a bad story better than anybody.
[00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:29.039]  As long as it's true.
[00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:34.184]  And, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly, and I'm okay with that.
[00:31:34.485 --> 00:31:37.608]  But I'm not okay when it is fake.
[00:31:37.668 --> 00:31:42.012]  I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred.
[00:31:42.673 --> 00:31:50.340]  Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that, I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall
[00:31:51.181 --> 00:31:58.285]  And I feel that it's inappropriate and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.
[00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:01.426]  It's so important to the public to get an honest press.
[00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:04.247]  The press, the public doesn't believe you people anymore.
[00:32:04.828 --> 00:32:06.529]  As an example, you're CNN.
[00:32:07.189 --> 00:32:11.431]  I mean, it's story after story after story is bad.
[00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:12.611]  I won.
[00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:13.752]  I won.
[00:32:14.092 --> 00:32:15.273]  I didn't do anything for Russia.
[00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:16.814]  I've done nothing for Russia.
[00:32:17.574 --> 00:32:19.655]  Hillary Clinton gave him 20% of our uranium.
[00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:21.734]  Hillary Clinton did a reset.
[00:32:21.774 --> 00:32:25.758]  Remember with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?
[00:32:25.798 --> 00:32:26.479]  Here, take a look.
[00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:32.004]  He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?
[00:32:33.605 --> 00:32:34.927]  Hillary, that was a reset.
[00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:36.008]  Remember it said reset?
[00:32:37.145 --> 00:32:39.047]  Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:05.497]  Thank you for joining us, Debbie.
[00:37:05.979 --> 00:37:12.075]  Given your knowledge on the California dam system, what's your take on the Oroville spill?
[00:37:13.223 --> 00:37:40.928]  Well, I think that after 12 years of getting warnings from people that there was great concern about the Oroville Dam just being destroyed naturally and that eventually the spillway would give way and possibly flood over hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes and farms and ranches and communities.
[00:37:41.508 --> 00:37:56.491]  I think it's absolutely absurd, Millie, that my governor, Jerry Brown, has been so complicit, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger before Jerry Brown, so complicit to the warnings that people have been, you know, sharing.
[00:37:56.651 --> 00:38:04.312]  Even environmental groups who are in disfavor of dams, especially in the 21st century, they'd like to see all dams destroyed.
[00:38:04.992 --> 00:38:10.073]  Even the environmental groups were forewarning, obviously cared enough about people,
[00:38:11.282 --> 00:38:15.683]  Including the environment to say, hey, you need to start looking at this dam.
[00:38:15.983 --> 00:38:17.163]  But they didn't, Millie.
[00:38:17.683 --> 00:38:26.465]  And now you're looking at people who, moving forward, are going to be concerned about their health and safety living below these dams.
[00:38:26.865 --> 00:38:35.587]  All the way down to Sacramento, there's potential, you know, harm that could be done if these dams, if this dam, Orville Dam, isn't taken care of.
[00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:50.112]  So do you think that, you know, this dam failure is being used as sort of a Hegelian dialectic, a problem-reaction solution, to get Californians to then demand the removal of all of these dams?
[00:38:50.913 --> 00:38:54.374]  Well, I do think that there... I absolutely know, not I think.
[00:38:54.574 --> 00:38:59.596]  I know that in the 21st century, under the United Nations Sustainable Development Act,
[00:38:59.972 --> 00:39:05.536]  The agenda is 100% to remove dams or destroy them.
[00:39:05.736 --> 00:39:20.426]  And we, where my parents' cattle ranch in Siskiyou County is, we have been fighting for the last 15 years just solidly to try and preserve four clean, green, renewable energy dams that
[00:39:20.826 --> 00:39:29.593]  Jerry Brown, California's governor, who obviously did not take care of the Oroville Dam to the point where people had to evacuate by hundreds of thousands.
[00:39:30.094 --> 00:39:43.705]  Jerry Brown said personally in a meeting last year about the Klamath River Dams, that it's about time that we start undoing what the mistakes that man had done in the past, and he's referring to destroying dams.
[00:39:44.145 --> 00:39:47.868]  So we in Siskiyou County have been fighting mad, fighting hard,
[00:39:48.749 --> 00:39:51.851]  To preserve our dam system because you know what, Millie?
[00:39:52.111 --> 00:39:53.231]  People need water.
[00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.732]  We need stored water.
[00:39:54.992 --> 00:40:03.296]  We need storage lakes and hydroelectric dams for inexpensive energy, for reliable water.
[00:40:03.732 --> 00:40:21.161]  For recreation, for irrigation, for flood control, drought control, fire suppression, all these benefits that dams and hydroelectric dams provide, especially to a state that is known throughout the world to be the breadbasket of the nation.
[00:40:21.482 --> 00:40:25.744]  This is why California's economy was so extraordinary at one point.
[00:40:26.084 --> 00:40:29.826]  To the point where we were the fifth largest economy in the world.
[00:40:30.006 --> 00:40:30.347]  Why?
[00:40:30.747 --> 00:40:51.680]  Because we were able to take water from the north part of the state and divert it through a series of water systems, including hydroelectric dams, including storage lakes, all the way down to, you know, into the San Joaquin Valley, which is where we get enormous amounts of food to feed enormous amounts of people in the United States.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:41:05.515]  But you're seeing the destruction, in my opinion, of rural America because we have a government that not only mismanages our natural resources, but is abusing the people.
[00:41:06.056 --> 00:41:08.859]  Wow, so would you say that these government officials are...
[00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:14.761]  Purposefully neglecting these dams so that they can just justify removing them.
[00:41:14.841 --> 00:41:17.282]  And does this play into Agenda 21?
[00:41:17.503 --> 00:41:24.125]  Because I know you speaked on that a little bit about how they're trying to get people out of these cattle ranching areas.
[00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:34.750]  And can you tell a little bit of the personal experience that you have experienced being a cattle rancher in California, one of the most like liberal democratic states out there?
[00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:41.733]  Well, we didn't used to be all, you know, so liberal and environmental, but we always took care of our land here.
[00:41:41.873 --> 00:41:52.058]  And, you know, that's one of the neat things about being in the farming and ranching industry is, if we don't take care of our land, if we don't have clean water and clean air,
[00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:55.496]  Why would we destroy our own livelihood?
[00:41:55.516 --> 00:42:06.782]  Why would we destroy the land that we love to go out and take care of, and all the animals on that land, and the wildlife that ranches and farms attract?
[00:42:07.202 --> 00:42:08.463]  If we were so bad,
[00:42:09.008 --> 00:42:12.069]  We would have, you know, quit a long time ago.
[00:42:12.409 --> 00:42:18.512]  But yes, Millie, in fact, all this radical environmentalism and to remove dams.
[00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:27.055]  You know, Bruce Babbitt, who was under Clinton, the Department of Interior Secretary, said in 2012, so five years ago,
[00:42:29.076 --> 00:42:40.198]  That under the Obama administration they had finally gotten the funding, the finances that they had needed for years and years and years to destroy the Elwha dams.
[00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:44.579]  The Elwha dams are in the state of Washington in Olympic Park.
[00:42:44.879 --> 00:42:49.500]  There has been an agenda for a long time to re-wild Olympic Park.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.480]  Those are their terms, re-wild.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.640]  So who's theirs?
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.361]  People, radical environmentalists.
[00:42:56.721 --> 00:43:10.854]  People who believe that human beings are just so bad to planet Earth that we should be forced into stack-and-pack housing mega-cities like the One Bay Area Plan in San Francisco.
[00:43:11.294 --> 00:43:17.340]  So what Bruce Babbitt had said about the Elwha dams, that they got the funding to destroy them.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.904]  By the way, behind those dams, just like behind the Klamath River dams and the Oroville dam,
[00:43:22.364 --> 00:43:31.306]  It's just this ecosystem where birds and fish and people and all these things come together to enjoy the water, to live, to survive from that water.
[00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:38.747]  Well, the Elwha dams, when they were destroyed, sent, you know, I don't know how many cubic feet of pollutants and sediments out to the ocean.
[00:43:39.207 --> 00:43:50.609]  But behind that destruction were these lakes, where thousands of birds and different species and, you know, this whole biodiversity existed until they destroyed those dams.
[00:43:51.349 --> 00:44:09.913]  That's the same thing that's going to happen on the Klamath River dams that Jerry Brown, the federal government under the Obama administration, Arnold Schwarzenegger, my former governor who was supposedly a conservative, people in Portland, environmental groups in Portland, all the way to Washington, D.C.
[00:44:10.293 --> 00:44:10.573]  I don't
[00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:36.980]  forcefully push, break down those dams and send pollutants all the way out to sea.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.882]  In this case, in the Klamath River, which is also in Northern California.
[00:44:41.282 --> 00:44:55.008]  So not only do you have the Oroville Dam situation going on, farmland, rural America, same thing up in Siskiyou County with these Klamath River dams, which is, once these dams are breached, Millie,
[00:44:56.349 --> 00:45:05.537]  20 million cubic yards of pollutants will sludge its way for 60 plus some odd years out to the ocean.
[00:45:06.157 --> 00:45:08.499]  So why do they want to destroy these dams?
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:14.885]  Because they say a coho salmon is more important, more valuable,
[00:45:15.515 --> 00:45:33.426]  Then having water 365 days a year, irrigation, flood control, drought control, fire suppression, they'd rather save and spend millions on a coho salmon that I could go right down to my Whole Foods right now and buy for $8.99 a pound.
[00:45:35.307 --> 00:45:41.652]  So this agenda is about nature first, environment first, fish and frogs first over people.
[00:45:42.092 --> 00:45:52.320]  Well that's a great point you made, Debbie, in how you're talking about how they are, you know, selling these salmon and yet these are supposed to be endangered species or protected species.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.641]  Yet they're selling them yourself.
[00:45:54.861 --> 00:46:01.986]  And these are environmentalists that are talking about how, you know, they're going to try and save the environment by bursting these dams.
[00:46:02.026 --> 00:46:04.127]  But what other damage is it going to do?
[00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:11.632]  I know you said it's going to spill pollutants, but, you know, what other damage to animals and their natural living environment will happen?
[00:46:12.152 --> 00:46:12.872]  Right, right.
[00:46:12.912 --> 00:46:20.497]  So the same very fish that they claim that they're going to save is the very same fish that, you know, could be destroyed for the next 60 years as these
[00:46:20.997 --> 00:46:28.321]  Toxins and pollutants, you know, make their way 187 miles plus out to the ocean.
[00:46:28.341 --> 00:46:29.242]  Wow, Debbie.
[00:46:29.282 --> 00:46:31.923]  Well, thank you so much for joining us in studio.
[00:46:32.043 --> 00:46:42.549]  I know that you have so much information and research on this, and we definitely are going to want to have you back again to tell us more about Agenda 21 and Agenda 30.
[00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:45.310]  So thank you so much for joining us in studio, Debbie.
[00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:46.691]  We really appreciate it.
[00:46:47.492 --> 00:46:49.813]  Is there any last things you'd like to share for a second?
[00:46:50.373 --> 00:46:57.057]  Yeah, Bruce Babbitt said over 75,000 dams he'd like to consider for destruction.
[00:46:57.437 --> 00:47:01.239]  That there are 75,000 more dams to consider for destruction.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.723]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.056]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:48:59.956]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.016]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.366 --> 00:49:09.672]  Well, Humana, one of the largest insurance companies in the United States, has said they're going to exit Obamacare.
[00:49:09.692 --> 00:49:13.297]  And of course, this is part of the death spiral of Obamacare.
[00:49:13.797 --> 00:49:18.343]  Whether or not the GOP wants to repeal it, reality is repealing Obamacare.
[00:49:18.363 --> 00:49:19.684]  And this is a very serious issue.
[00:49:20.325 --> 00:49:24.987]  This is 20% of the economy that is tied up in the healthcare economy.
[00:49:25.148 --> 00:49:26.428]  That's one-fifth of our economy.
[00:49:26.828 --> 00:49:32.992]  And understand that it was Obamacare and it was immigration that got the GOP elected to Congress.
[00:49:33.032 --> 00:49:36.774]  That's where the Democrats lost a thousand plus seats on those two issues.
[00:49:37.114 --> 00:49:39.535]  And of course they were the two key issues for Donald Trump.
[00:49:39.555 --> 00:49:41.176]  So what is being done about this?
[00:49:41.769 --> 00:49:49.257]  We understand that the mandated levels of care are so high that it's not working for end users and it's certainly not working for insurance companies.
[00:49:49.277 --> 00:50:02.430]  We're going to talk about what's going on with these failed mergers of insurance companies and the regulations that have come out, the executive orders from Donald Trump as well as the first executive orders from Tom Price, the health secretary that just took office.
[00:50:03.051 --> 00:50:05.033]  But understand that in order to get this to work,
[00:50:05.293 --> 00:50:10.395]  They've mandated such high levels of health care that they have to hold a gun to our head to make us get it.
[00:50:10.535 --> 00:50:13.316]  And so that's part of what the IRS mandates are about.
[00:50:14.117 --> 00:50:17.518]  And because people can't afford this, they start to game the system.
[00:50:18.138 --> 00:50:20.579]  So they get in and out whenever they have a need.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.381]  They get in and when they don't have a need, they try to get out as soon as possible.
[00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:35.366]  Now the first thing that Donald Trump did was an executive order that quote said we're going to provide relief from Obamacare to individuals and insurers within the boundary of the law because of course Obamacare hasn't been repealed yet.
[00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:44.090]  So what they did, and we just saw this happen yesterday, we saw that the IRS said that they're not going to reject silent returns.
[00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:53.194]  In other words, if you file an income tax return and you don't check the box and give them the information about whether or not you're enrolled in Obamacare, they're not going to immediately reject your return.
[00:50:53.874 --> 00:50:56.036]  Now this is not something that's new.
[00:50:56.096 --> 00:50:59.938]  What was going to be new was that beginning this year they were going to reject the return.
[00:50:59.998 --> 00:51:03.100]  So it's essentially enforcing the status quo.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:09.725]  The IRS is going to step up the regulations and say we're not even going to take your tax return if you don't give us this information to start with.
[00:51:09.925 --> 00:51:11.846]  And now they're saying well we're not going to do that.
[00:51:12.327 --> 00:51:16.449]  It's pretty mild at the most here because they can still come after you.
[00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:21.173]  Now yesterday we had Tom Price put out his first proposals as health secretary.
[00:51:21.773 --> 00:51:23.955]  And under this proposed rule, let me read you what's happening here.
[00:51:23.995 --> 00:51:30.699]  People who do not receive health insurance from an employer would have six weeks instead of three months to sign up for coverage during open enrollment.
[00:51:30.719 --> 00:51:32.180]  So they've tightened that up.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.561]  That's what the insurance companies wanted.
[00:51:33.902 --> 00:51:45.830]  They also said they're going to put in place stronger vetting practices to make sure those who buy plans outside of open enrollment submit evidence to show that they did so because of major life changes such as a divorce, a move, or getting a new job.
[00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:50.413]  See, this is the kind of stuff that comes along with the idea that we have to have universal health insurance.
[00:51:50.713 --> 00:51:52.374]  And we're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[00:51:52.855 --> 00:52:02.541]  Whenever we buy into the idea that we've got to mandate this stuff, now all of a sudden you've got an anti-government, you've got to come to them with permission to even buy health insurance outside of these enrollment periods.
[00:52:02.561 --> 00:52:06.344]  So, you've got to prove that something major has happened in your life before you can even get in.
[00:52:06.864 --> 00:52:15.946]  They say it would also require that people who drop out of coverage before the year is over would pay premiums they would have accrued for the full year before they can enroll for the following year.
[00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:28.169]  So this is something that has been put in by Tom Price to try to help insurance companies who are going bankrupt just as Donald Trump came out with an executive order said let's try to ease up on these new rules from the IRS.
[00:52:28.269 --> 00:52:30.570]  But that's not really getting to the root of the problem.
[00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:40.037]  Now not only is Humana dropping out of Obamacare next year, but we also saw that a merger that was going to happen between Humana and Aetna has now been shut down.
[00:52:40.637 --> 00:52:42.399]  That would have created something that was too big to fail.
[00:52:42.439 --> 00:52:46.802]  And also there's another merger between Cigna and Anthem that looks like that's not going to happen either.
[00:52:46.842 --> 00:52:47.703]  That's very good news.
[00:52:48.303 --> 00:52:52.965]  Because understand that when we got into this mortgage situation, it wasn't just the Federal Reserve manipulating interest rates.
[00:52:53.305 --> 00:53:01.109]  It was the Clinton administration that created the first big merger between Nations Bank and Bank of America that created this too-big-to-fail rush.
[00:53:01.669 --> 00:53:07.732]  Everybody said at the time that all the banks were going to rush to compete with that and we wound up with about a half dozen banks that were too big to fail.
[00:53:08.092 --> 00:53:10.814]  That plus Glass-Steagall gave us the catastrophe.
[00:53:11.374 --> 00:53:21.519]  Now on the insurance side, if you start to have a few too-big-to-fail insurance companies plus Obamacare with its mandates, that is going to be a prescription for disaster.
[00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:27.983]  We have to understand there's a difference between health care and insurance, just like there's a difference between education and schools.
[00:53:28.743 --> 00:53:34.825]  We have to understand that we have to separate from these institutions the services that we want to get.
[00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:42.988]  And when we actually don't do that, we wind up driving costs sky-high, both in education and in health care, and our services go down.
[00:53:43.208 --> 00:53:44.708]  We have to think out of that box.
[00:53:44.728 --> 00:53:50.830]  That's why it's very important for Donald Trump to move away from the statement that he said, we're going to get insurance for everybody.
[00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:51.050]  No!
[00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:54.212]  We need affordable health insurance for everybody.
[00:53:54.252 --> 00:53:55.232]  We need to make it affordable.
[00:53:55.712 --> 00:54:02.456]  And if you're going to stick mindlessly to these institutions, these boxes that we have created, that isn't going to happen for us.
[00:54:02.736 --> 00:54:10.300]  He needs to go back to his original proposals and he had a market system that was going to replace mandates, was going to give us information and choice.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.000]  That's what we need.
[00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:22.538]  Nearly six years ago, Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant suffered a triple meltdown, and now it appears as if radiation levels there are on the rise.
[00:54:23.039 --> 00:54:31.945]  Now, at an estimated 530 sieverts per hour, the radiation level inside the plant now far exceeds the previous high of 73 sieverts per hour.
[00:54:33.806 --> 00:54:37.691]  This is recorded soon after that triple meltdown took place in March of 2011.
[00:54:38.252 --> 00:54:45.901]  Now, Gizmodo reports that officials with TEPCO aren't entirely sure why radiation levels are on a dramatic upward trend.
[00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:52.469]  Either the previous readings were insufficient or incorrect, or conditions inside the plant are changing.
[00:54:52.990 --> 00:55:02.954]  The problem is the interior condition of the plant is still a big mystery because all of the robotics being sent in to investigate are destroyed within hours.
[00:55:03.435 --> 00:55:17.261]  Now a remotely operated machine that was designed to withstand exposure of up to 1,000 total sieverts was sent into the Unit 2 reactor for the first time since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
[00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:21.943]  So at the previous peak of 73 sieverts per hour they were thinking this is going to be
[00:55:22.543 --> 00:55:22.763]  This is
[00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:58.367]  Underneath the pressure vessel in the reactor's primary containment vessel, a huge hole that officials say they suspect that this gash was created by nuclear fuel that melted and then pierced through the vessel after the tsunami knocked out Fukushima's backup cooling system.
[00:55:59.068 --> 00:56:07.692]  Who knows what else is going on in there because the robot quickly malfunctioned or possibly they shut it down because they said, oh, okay, we've seen enough.
[00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:12.094]  Things are pretty bad inside of Unit 2's reactor.
[00:56:12.775 --> 00:56:18.678]  So it's difficult to say for sure because it has been nearly impossible to assess the conditions inside.
[00:56:19.358 --> 00:56:26.141]  Radiation levels there are so high, it's been impossible to use any existing technology to explore this area.
[00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.561]  It's highly radioactive.
[00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:37.825]  And now, just to give you a little context, one sievert of cumulative radiation exposure is the maximum lifetime limit for NASA astronauts.
[00:56:38.285 --> 00:56:44.608]  A short duration exposure of just four to five sieverts pretty much guarantees that you're going to die within 30 days.
[00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:49.350]  And, you know, probably very gruesome death at that.
[00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:51.311]  Higher doses will kill you much faster.
[00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:59.936]  But they were able to create this robot, the Scorpion, that they thought would achieve at least a thousand sieverts total.
[00:57:00.516 --> 00:57:04.438]  And, of course, it wasn't able to withstand the high amount there of only 530.
[00:57:05.779 --> 00:57:08.941]  But the international outlet, the News Lens, wants you to
[00:57:09.241 --> 00:57:16.967]  You know, don't concern yourself with the fact that these radiation levels are much higher than expected and why they're on this massive upward trend.
[00:57:17.408 --> 00:57:21.751]  They want you to know the news is not entirely accurate.
[00:57:21.792 --> 00:57:22.752]  It's taken out of context.
[00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:30.459]  So they explain that a sensor was briefly inserted into the Unit 2 containment vessel in 2012 that detected those 73 sieverts.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:44.708]  But the radiation levels quickly disabled the electronics of any robotic device that was sent in to investigate, so it's taken TEPCO since 2012 to develop new technologies that could withstand this radiation.
[00:57:44.768 --> 00:57:46.409]  But of course, they clearly could not.
[00:57:47.169 --> 00:57:57.355]  The writer is arguing that the latest radiation levels are taken out of context because this is the first time that technology has been able to accurately measure radiation in that area of Unit 2.
[00:57:59.416 --> 00:58:03.658]  530 Sieverts is the highest that's been measured at Fukushima so far.
[00:58:04.098 --> 00:58:13.243]  It doesn't mean necessarily that levels are on the rise, but that a previously unmeasurable high radiation area has finally been measured.
[00:58:13.763 --> 00:58:17.325]  And it's extremely worrying and worse than was expected.
[00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:18.986]  With that gaping hole.
[00:58:19.586 --> 00:58:27.129]  So regardless of the hashtag alternative facts, plans to remove spent nuclear fuel have been delayed again.
[00:58:27.149 --> 00:58:29.910]  2018 is the earliest estimate there.
[00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:32.371]  New fuel leaks continue to be discovered.
[00:58:32.671 --> 00:58:37.373]  Cleanup costs are estimated to continue to rise by billions of dollars each year.
