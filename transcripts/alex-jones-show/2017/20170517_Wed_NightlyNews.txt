[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.242]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.163]  I'm Millie Weaver.
[00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:26.126]  It is Wednesday, May 17th, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:29.268]  Tonight!
[00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:34.484]  Public enemy number one, George Soros.
[00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:39.506]  You know, the rich old white guy who funds Black Lives Matter.
[00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:51.612]  Well, he is now funding a black versus blue war where everyone gets bruised as the globalist push to divide and conquer America continues.
[00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:52.513]  Then,
[00:00:53.633 --> 00:01:03.380]  A Christian video game maker is about to launch a new gaming experience to fight the shadow government in real time.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.166]  Owen Schroyer talks to game designer Tony Martin about this new concept to expose the New World Order.
[00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:17.490]  All that plus more evidence surfaces about DNC staffer Seth Rich.
[00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.573]  That's coming up next on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.749]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.489]  I take this.
[00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.790]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.113]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:47.616]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.340]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.461]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.064]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.947]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:05.371]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.194]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.177]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.479]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.900]  I love it.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.644]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:18.805]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:24.794]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.436]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.899]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:12.603]  President Donald Trump is now the target of a coup d'etat against the deep state and intelligence agencies as well as the mainstream media.
[00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:24.288]  Now they are using Nazi Germany styles of propaganda in order to accomplish their goal of successfully character assassinating President Trump.
[00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.389]  Now what's interesting to note is
[00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:35.392]  Their methods that they use, it's basically telling a lie over and over and over again and the masses will believe the lie.
[00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:43.576]  It becomes a hundredth monkey syndrome to where everyone just starts believing it, therefore it becomes true in the public's opinion.
[00:03:43.976 --> 00:04:05.384]  Now the problem with this is it's very hard to refute these propaganda memes out there circulating such as this Russian collusion myth that's been going around that President Trump has been colluding with the Russians and that the Russians hacked the DNC and were responsible for the DNC leaks, which we all know went to WikiLeaks.
[00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:12.871]  Well it's hard to disprove this when they're going around saying this based on no evidence at all whatsoever.
[00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:19.894]  There has not been any evidence that has come out suggesting that Trump has been colluding with the Russians.
[00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:22.575]  Now this is actually really interesting here.
[00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:27.237]  This reporter, she is an Emmy award-winning reporter, her name is
[00:04:28.337 --> 00:04:35.581]  Cheryl Atkinson, she actually had some insight into this that was actually really mesmerizing.
[00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:37.302]  It completely blew my mind.
[00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.563]  She posed this question.
[00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:54.151]  She said, if the Democratic National Committee or DNC claimed its email system was hacked by Russia, why didn't it let the FBI examine its email server?
[00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.412]  Well, that should be
[00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:58.054]  That's basic common sense right there.
[00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:15.108]  The FBI, you would think, would seize this server of the DNC's and look into it, do some forensics, and trace this hacker, or even verify that in fact there was a hacker that had hacked the DNC's server.
[00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:17.370]  So why didn't the FBI do this?
[00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:27.478]  That really poises the question and why has the DNC been sitting on this server and not been wanting it to be analyzed or investigated?
[00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:44.292]  Well, that would destroy their ability to continue this propaganda meme that's going around that Trump is colluding with the Russians and that the Russians are, you know, they hacked the DNC leaks and it was all to conspire against Hillary Clinton and that's why Hillary Clinton lost.
[00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:58.599]  It's just a further, you know, push this agenda to character assassinate Trump so that when they do actually go and try to assassinate him, people will not be enraged.
[00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:03.322]  People will not stand up because they will have already destroyed his character.
[00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:16.655]  Now, Russia has come out saying that they are prepared to release transcripts of the Trump Lavrov meeting to debunk the witch hunt that's been going on.
[00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:19.839]  Well, if you don't know what has happened here,
[00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:24.610]  Putin has come out speaking against this meeting.
[00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:35.998]  Trump met with Lavrov and it was simply to discuss ISIS and, you know, getting Russia to go down and crack down on ISIS in the Middle East.
[00:06:36.618 --> 00:06:45.544]  They were talking about some humanitarian issues and, you know, the risk of terrorism and airline flight safety.
[00:06:46.244 --> 00:07:00.691]  Well, of course the mainstream media decides to go out there and start saying that Trump had leaked classified information to the Russians and it's some huge Russian conspiracy that's been whirling around.
[00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:06.154]  And so Putin came out and he, you know, this is kind of funny what he said here.
[00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:07.314]  It had me laughing.
[00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:08.555]  He said,
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.301]  We see that the United States has been developing political schizophrenia.
[00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.362]  That's right, he says, political schizophrenia.
[00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:28.605]  And that right there, it's kind of true because we are seeing some of the most crazy political battlegrounds that's been going on in this country right now.
[00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:30.285]  We've never seen anything like it.
[00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:38.407]  He says, this is the only thing I can think of when I hear allegations saying that the president has revealed some secrets to Lavrov.
[00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:52.275]  He added jokingly, I will have to reprimand him because he shared these secrets neither with me nor with the Russian secret services, which is very inappropriate on his part.
[00:07:52.955 --> 00:08:01.701]  So Putin's basically saying, well, I guess I'm going to have to punish Lavrov for not sharing these secrets that Trump supposedly shared with him.
[00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:18.521]  And Putin has said that he is more than willing to release the video recording of the meeting to the United States Congress if the Trump administration approves it, to basically debunk their witch hunt against President Trump.
[00:08:19.747 --> 00:08:20.767]  Another interesting story.
[00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:23.508]  Man, they are just on the attack for President Trump.
[00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:29.189]  CNN's Bash admits Comey memo is a deep state revenge against Trump.
[00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:35.351]  So this CNN reporter pretty much admitted that it's just an attack.
[00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:37.052]  It's revenge for firing Comey.
[00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:37.912]  These
[00:08:38.892 --> 00:08:49.003]  Comey, this Comey memo, if you don't know what it was, the New York Times had reported that Trump had sold former FBI Director James Comey.
[00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:54.930]  I hope you can see your way clear to getting this go, to letting Flynn go.
[00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.911]  He's a good guy.
[00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:57.232]  I hope you can let this go.
[00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:05.376]  So they put out this memo, which was from an anonymous source, and nobody has ever even seen this memo, okay?
[00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:15.079]  It has as much credibility as that urine, crazy golden shower gate story that had gone around with Trump not too long ago.
[00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.000]  So nobody's seen this at all whatsoever.
[00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.062]  I mean, what do you do with this?
[00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:29.230]  And you have mainstream media pundits out there just saying, oh, well, this is what happens when you pick a fight with the intelligence community.
[00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.253]  You pick a fight with Deep State and they come and they get back at you.
[00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:38.698]  And they're almost gloating about how powerful Deep State is and you shouldn't cross them.
[00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:42.822]  Well, that's how you know we got a major problem and we do need to drain the swamp in this country.
[00:09:43.843 --> 00:09:50.088]  Another interesting story here is that, you know, the... Actually, okay, this is very interesting.
[00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:55.546]  First, Republicans talk about President Trump's impeachment.
[00:09:55.566 --> 00:10:03.269]  They start saying they want to see impeachment of President Trump, and then next thing you know, the stock market dips down.
[00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:12.991]  It shed 300 points and the Dow, and they are experts in the stock market, are attributing this directly to Washington.
[00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.712]  They say this is Washington-driven, and they haven't seen something like it since 1998.
[00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:24.514]  Or 99 when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke with Bill Clinton.
[00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:26.974]  So this is a direct correlation.
[00:10:27.455 --> 00:10:43.577]  When people's hopes disappear and their hopes get crushed, that President Trump is going to be left alone by these cronies, these crony capitalists, and do his best to fulfill his campaign promises to bring back jobs, the stock markets go up.
[00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.738]  Right after the election, the stock markets went up.
[00:10:47.618 --> 00:10:55.563]  Now, as Republicans are starting to backstab Trump and say they want to talk about impeachment, the stock markets go down.
[00:10:56.544 --> 00:10:58.445]  Well, another interesting story.
[00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:04.849]  Whistleblower Chelsea Manning has just been released today.
[00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:10.993]  Chelsea Manning is now free after seven years in a military prison.
[00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:15.772]  After Obama commuted her sentence.
[00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:34.588]  Well, many of you know that Chelsea Manning was originally going by Bradley Manning when these allegations came forth after she, now she, leaked classified information to Wikileaks.
[00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:37.070]  Julian Assange at Wikileaks.
[00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.934]  And this was huge information.
[00:11:40.014 --> 00:11:43.379]  It actually had video evidence showing U.S.
[00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:48.826]  helicopter crews indiscriminately killing Iraqi civilians.
[00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:50.549]  It was pretty brutal.
[00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:52.271]  The video footage went viral.
[00:11:53.152 --> 00:11:56.694]  And it was, you know, these murders were just dubbed collateral damage.
[00:11:56.914 --> 00:11:58.996]  It was just collateral murders.
[00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:07.981]  And so people have actually set up a GoFundMe for Chelsea Manning and, you know, now that she's released, $150,000 has been raised to cover
[00:12:13.124 --> 00:12:16.390]  Living expenses, utilities, and so on and so forth.
[00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:20.197]  So it should be pretty interesting to hear some of the stories that come out.
[00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:25.306]  What it was like being in prison as a whistleblower because we all know that...
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:38.843]  That very well could have been the destiny for Snowden after he had leaked, and I doubt Snowden would have been given the same pardon by President Obama.
[00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:45.885]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com for stories that the mainstream media won't tell you about.
[00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:06.279]  President Donald Trump will soon decide who he will appoint as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.620]  This is a crucial appointment.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.482]  It's essential that the American people have confidence and trust in the next Director of the FBI.
[00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:19.684]  It's equally important that President Trump have confidence in the person that he chooses.
[00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:24.347]  The list coming from the White House is some cause for concern.
[00:13:24.948 --> 00:13:41.702]  As we have seen in other deliberations for key positions in the government, the list is overloaded with establishment insiders who neither supported President Trump's candidacy nor support his current agenda to make America great again.
[00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:58.358]  Former Congressman Mike Rogers, who served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, openly scoffed at the idea that the president, as candidate Trump, had been under surveillance at Trump Tower, although we now know that that is a certainty.
[00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:03.962]  Former Deputy Attorney General Alice Fisher is on the list.
[00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:07.185]  Paul Abati, an FBI veteran.
[00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:12.048]  Judge Mike Garcia of New York, who served as a former U.S.
[00:14:12.148 --> 00:14:12.568]  attorney.
[00:14:13.249 --> 00:14:14.230]  Larry Thompson,
[00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:20.774]  Deputy Attorney General under George W. Bush and Andrew McCabe.
[00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:25.237]  That one is the acting director who stepped into Mr. Comey's shoes.
[00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:39.206]  This is particularly concerning because it was Mr. McCabe who wanted to use taxpayer money to pay for the phony dossier that claimed that Donald Trump had dallied with prostitutes in Russia.
[00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:42.108]  A total, complete forgery.
[00:14:42.408 --> 00:14:44.330]  An embarrassment to the FBI.
[00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:51.172]  And then, of course, there are the names who aren't on the list or who are not, who have taken themselves off.
[00:14:51.612 --> 00:14:58.574]  Former Congressman Trey Gowdy, an outsider who would have been an excellent appointee, has eliminated himself.
[00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:03.036]  My recommendation to President Trump is quite simple.
[00:15:03.616 --> 00:15:07.978]  I think he should appoint former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
[00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:18.963]  Kelly did a superb job as the Police Commissioner in New York, transforming that city from a crime capital to one of the safest cities in the United States.
[00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:29.969]  And because Senator Chuck Schumer supported the Police Commissioner Kelly for FBI Director under Barack Obama, a position he did not receive,
[00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:35.833]  I think that Schumer would be hard-pressed to oppose Kelly's appointment.
[00:15:36.293 --> 00:15:42.038]  More importantly, Kelly is a New Yorker with a long relationship with President Donald Trump.
[00:15:42.438 --> 00:15:44.920]  He is clearly the best man for the job.
[00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:02.863]  You have an investigation going on where the president is implicated.
[00:16:03.384 --> 00:16:04.868]  Does intelligence exist?
[00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:29.266]  We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say our, that's NSA, FBI, and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians.
[00:16:29.306 --> 00:16:32.328]  There was no evidence of that included in our report.
[00:16:32.368 --> 00:16:33.469]  I understand that, but does it exist?
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.290]  Not to my knowledge.
[00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:38.852]  And this is a serious investigation.
[00:16:39.192 --> 00:16:44.735]  I've been trying to get people to focus on this connection with the Kremlin and with Putin.
[00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:52.799]  Do you have evidence that there was in fact collusion between Trump associates and Russia during the campaign?
[00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.500]  Not at this time.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:02.324]  I think there's enough there that we know about the Kremlin and about Putin to be concerned about whether or not there was collusion.
[00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:07.453]  Well, as I stated, I don't know of any evidence of that.
[00:17:07.774 --> 00:17:09.739]  Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?
[00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:16.307]  I think he's right about characterizing the report which you all have read.
[00:17:16.928 --> 00:17:26.175]  I believe there was and I believe that they should have to connect the dots and get the facts because I think it will lead to the impeachment of this president.
[00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:29.337]  Can you say definitively that there was collusion?
[00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:34.120]  There were people affiliated with the Trump campaign who were working with Russians?
[00:17:35.161 --> 00:17:37.964]  I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point.
[00:17:38.004 --> 00:17:39.405]  You keep saying there's a lot more smoke.
[00:17:39.845 --> 00:17:40.766]  There's a lot more smoke.
[00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:41.627]  You think the fire's there?
[00:17:41.947 --> 00:17:43.429]  Listen, time will tell.
[00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:50.915]  Everybody go at this investigation until we get to the facts and to the bottom line, which was their conclusion.
[00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.416]  I believe that there was.
[00:17:52.717 --> 00:17:57.301]  I had no evidence of, it was presented to me, of collusion.
[00:17:57.401 --> 00:18:00.323]  Now, have you seen anything
[00:18:01.124 --> 00:18:08.970]  Either intelligence briefings, through intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you've made.
[00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.250]  Sure.
[00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.493]  They have the documentation that they did the hacking.
[00:18:12.513 --> 00:18:13.033]  The hacking.
[00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:14.094]  On the DNC.
[00:18:14.214 --> 00:18:14.414]  Right.
[00:18:14.554 --> 00:18:15.795]  And on some of us, you know.
[00:18:15.915 --> 00:18:17.036]  But the collusion, though.
[00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:18.277]  No, we have not.
[00:18:18.817 --> 00:18:19.918]  Was there a conclusion?
[00:18:20.198 --> 00:18:21.319]  I believe that there was.
[00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:22.460]  But the collusion, though.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.601]  No, we have not.
[00:18:23.681 --> 00:18:30.086]  We've got to have the will to accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:34.861]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.390]  This is the Info War.
[00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:09.358]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:16.004]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:33.540]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.364]  It works.
[00:19:40.645 --> 00:19:48.930]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:58.517]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[00:19:58.857 --> 00:19:59.477]  A total 360 win.
[00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.209]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:05.290]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.751]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.193]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:12.793]  I'm 42.
[00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.715]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.356]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:20.437]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:21.117]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:21.718]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:28.961]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:36.785]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:40.286]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:46.933]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:50.056]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.738]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:53.320]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.541]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.561 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.090]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:10.054]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:10.074 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.258]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.382]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:33.349]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:37.133]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:44.920]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.343]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my own thing.
[00:21:48.363 --> 00:21:50.125]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:58.484]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action, no fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:06.486]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.848]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:20.117]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:21.418]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.478 --> 00:22:27.562]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.065]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:33.307]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.413]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:44.776]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:47.658]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.758 --> 00:22:53.163]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.844 --> 00:23:00.706]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:11.348]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:11.508 --> 00:23:20.114]  Recent revelations regarding Seth Rich, the former DNC staffer that was found murdered in Washington D.C.
[00:23:20.174 --> 00:23:24.657]  have come out after his family hired a private investigator.
[00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:36.044]  Now this private investigator is saying that there's correspondence between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks during this time period in which the DNC leaks occurred.
[00:23:36.364 --> 00:23:38.066]  It's interesting to note here that a
[00:23:38.766 --> 00:23:39.507]  A D.C.
[00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:45.452]  police officer had said to this private investigator that they were ordered to stand down.
[00:23:45.712 --> 00:23:52.097]  That's very unusual to have a police department standing down on a murder investigation.
[00:23:53.098 --> 00:24:01.925]  New information from the family's private investigator suggests there is tangible evidence on Seth Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating
[00:24:02.405 --> 00:24:10.713]  With WikiLeaks prior to his death, the Rich family hired Rod Wheeler, a former MPD homicide detective, to run a parallel investigation into their son's death.
[00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:19.182]  Wheeler says he believes there's a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.
[00:24:20.703 --> 00:24:27.228]  So, that would put Seth Rich as the potential DNC leaker and not the Russians.
[00:24:27.728 --> 00:24:41.438]  This would essentially destroy the fake news narrative that the mainstream media and Democrats had been pushing, saying that Trump was colluding with the Russians and that the Russians interfered with the election.
[00:24:41.738 --> 00:24:53.365]  Well, this presumes that the DNC leaks actually had a major effect on the outcome of the presidential election, which all of the polls tend to say otherwise.
[00:24:53.725 --> 00:25:00.469]  It doesn't actually show that the DNC leaks played a major role into whether or not people were going to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:10.438]  In fact, the reason Hillary Clinton lost is because two-thirds of prior Obama voters actually chose to then vote for President Trump.
[00:25:10.538 --> 00:25:23.471]  It's also interesting to note that less than an hour after this Seth Rich murder case, Washington Post posted an article claiming that Trump was leaking top-secret
[00:25:26.854 --> 00:25:33.199]  So was that article just an attempt to continue to cover up the Seth Rich murder case?
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:47.872]  Let's go see just how effective the mainstream media and Democratic Party has been at swaying the public's opinion away from the Seth Rich story and into this Russian fake news narrative storyline.
[00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:49.654]  Let's go see what they have to say.
[00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:56.300]  What do you think about the narrative that's been going around that the Russians interfered in the presidential election?
[00:25:57.121 --> 00:25:57.821]  It's true.
[00:25:58.302 --> 00:25:58.883]  You think so?
[00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:00.284]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:26:00.624 --> 00:26:01.365]  Trump's a liar.
[00:26:02.066 --> 00:26:02.726]  I don't believe it.
[00:26:03.067 --> 00:26:03.507]  God.
[00:26:04.028 --> 00:26:04.728]  I think it's media hype.
[00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:06.470]  She's a lot more political than I am.
[00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.891]  I don't watch any of that.
[00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:08.692]  I get really depressed.
[00:26:09.092 --> 00:26:11.875]  Did you hear about the DNC leaks or the WikiLeaks?
[00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:14.478]  A little bit, but I don't know much about it to be honest.
[00:26:15.168 --> 00:26:20.954]  Did you hear about this story that's kind of been going around that the Russians interfered in the presidential election?
[00:26:20.974 --> 00:26:21.935]  This I heard about.
[00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:23.416]  Everyone's heard about it.
[00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:26.879]  Uh, maybe a little bit here and there, but nothing I know in depth.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:27.520]  No.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.842]  I mean, I've heard about that, like, vaguely on the news.
[00:26:31.143 --> 00:26:32.483]  I don't know what to think about it.
[00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:33.804]  I don't have enough information.
[00:26:33.824 --> 00:26:38.164]  I don't keep up with the news very much anymore.
[00:26:38.724 --> 00:26:45.106]  Do you remember seeing any, like, evidence of the Russians hacking the election out there?
[00:26:45.966 --> 00:26:46.226]  No.
[00:26:47.086 --> 00:26:49.106]  Just a lot of talk, as usual.
[00:26:49.126 --> 00:26:54.427]  I think there's enough evidence to probably think that there's some truth to it.
[00:26:55.187 --> 00:26:56.928]  What do you think some of the evidence is?
[00:26:56.968 --> 00:26:58.408]  Like, do you know any of it specifically?
[00:26:59.676 --> 00:27:00.376]  No, not really.
[00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:05.579]  Just from, I mean, I can't bring up anything specifically, but stuff that I've read, stuff that I've seen.
[00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:09.181]  Do you think that the Russians stole the election from Hillary Clinton?
[00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:10.401]  Yeah, I do.
[00:27:11.382 --> 00:27:24.449]  During the primaries, I believe it was, where he seemed to, out of nowhere, just really get a lot of, a lot of support, compared to, seems like a lot of folks are on the side of, like, Bernie and Hillary.
[00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:29.151]  How do you think that the Russians has anything to do with people supporting Trump?
[00:27:30.836 --> 00:27:31.156]  Hmm.
[00:27:31.657 --> 00:27:33.918]  That's a very difficult question to ask.
[00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:43.966]  Do you think that it could be possible that maybe Hillary Clinton didn't win the election because she didn't capture those former Obama voters?
[00:27:46.127 --> 00:27:46.388]  No.
[00:27:47.568 --> 00:27:47.749]  Nope.
[00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.930]  I don't think so.
[00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.313]  Honestly, at this point, everything I read and see, I take with a grain of salt.
[00:27:53.973 --> 00:27:54.714]  Do you think it's true?
[00:27:56.215 --> 00:28:00.279]  I don't know if it's true, but it's kind of concerning that there's talks about it at all.
[00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:04.682]  Have you heard about Seth Rich, the former DNC staff?
[00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:05.964]  I cannot say I have, ma'am.
[00:28:06.364 --> 00:28:07.425]  Did you hear about him at all?
[00:28:07.465 --> 00:28:10.147]  He was a DNC staffer with the Democratic Party?
[00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:11.909]  Um, I don't think so.
[00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:13.610]  I'm not too familiar.
[00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.670]  No.
[00:28:15.609 --> 00:28:16.669]  Have you heard about him at all?
[00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.030]  No.
[00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.130]  No.
[00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.510]  Who is it?
[00:28:18.851 --> 00:28:23.993]  He was murdered back in July, and his body was found in Washington.
[00:28:24.013 --> 00:28:24.653]  Did you hear about him?
[00:28:24.993 --> 00:28:26.714]  Yeah, but I don't know anything about it.
[00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:28.155]  I have not.
[00:28:28.775 --> 00:28:28.995]  No.
[00:28:29.315 --> 00:28:30.176]  Have you heard about him?
[00:28:30.496 --> 00:28:30.776]  No.
[00:28:30.796 --> 00:28:32.737]  Did not.
[00:28:33.557 --> 00:28:34.098]  I have not.
[00:28:34.858 --> 00:28:35.458]  Not at all?
[00:28:35.718 --> 00:28:36.779]  No, I haven't, sorry.
[00:28:37.139 --> 00:28:37.519]  I haven't.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.000]  No, we have not.
[00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:41.341]  Uh, no, I haven't.
[00:28:42.711 --> 00:28:46.118]  I have a peripheral memory of that piece, but nothing specific.
[00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:48.122]  He was probably an asshole or something.
[00:28:48.683 --> 00:28:51.229]  You think that they murdered him just because he was an asshole?
[00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:52.050]  Yeah, probably.
[00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.774]  You know.
[00:28:54.244 --> 00:28:57.906]  You don't think that it would be because he might have leaked stuff?
[00:28:58.627 --> 00:29:15.037]  You know, he was a Democratic Party person that was working in IT and he had the ability to leak stuff and we're having evidence coming out by private investigators hired by his family that, you know, he was in correspondence with WikiLeaks.
[00:29:15.998 --> 00:29:19.220]  So do you think that... So WikiLeaks doesn't have anything to do with the Russians?
[00:29:20.273 --> 00:29:23.934]  Wikileaks was the site that all the information was leaked to.
[00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:26.575]  They're just a platform for leaked information.
[00:29:27.276 --> 00:29:31.117]  No, Wikileaks was put on by a guy named Julian Assange.
[00:29:31.597 --> 00:29:35.299]  According to MSNBC, I believe they had some kind of connection there.
[00:29:36.408 --> 00:29:38.490]  Assange doesn't have any connection to the Russians.
[00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.616]  What they're trying to say is that the Russians hacked the DNC emails and leaked them.
[00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.158]  That was the original storyline.
[00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:54.948]  And now evidence is coming out that Seth Rich, who was found murdered after the DNC leaks, his laptop showed correspondence with WikiLeaks.
[00:29:55.309 --> 00:29:56.370]  Yeah, stuff can happen.
[00:29:56.778 --> 00:29:57.558]  Sounds plausible.
[00:29:58.339 --> 00:29:58.959]  And now he's dead.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.440]  Yikes.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.480]  Yikes.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:10.405]  It's suspicious, but not surprising, because that kind of thing happens quite often, actually, and just goes, you know, almost unnoticed a lot of times.
[00:30:10.785 --> 00:30:13.546]  Under this administration, everyone's a potential leaker.
[00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:19.569]  Do you think that watching the mainstream media at all has affected your opinion on all of this?
[00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:29.718]  It's definitely shown that there's definitely a lot of sensationalism out there and that it definitely does very good for the American people to do research on their own.
[00:30:30.239 --> 00:30:42.829]  It's very unfortunate that we have to tune into something like the BBC or NPR to really get the full story compared to mainstream media which is more obsessed with sensationalism than the real deal.
[00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.574]  Do you think it's possible that even NPR and BBC could be not telling the truth?
[00:30:49.025 --> 00:30:50.726]  That's a very, very good possibility.
[00:30:51.007 --> 00:30:52.168]  You raised a really good point there.
[00:30:53.088 --> 00:30:53.989]  Not surprising.
[00:30:54.069 --> 00:31:01.915]  Most of the people I talked to had no idea who Seth Rich was and what were the stories surrounding his mysterious murder.
[00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:09.541]  However, most people did know about the mainstream media claim that the Russians interfered in the presidential election.
[00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:17.367]  This just goes to show that they have been very successful at getting people... Nice one, dude!
[00:31:20.213 --> 00:31:23.554]  We got a Bill Clinton and Ravens shout-out heckler right there.
[00:31:23.574 --> 00:31:24.355]  That's pretty awesome.
[00:31:24.395 --> 00:31:37.339]  But it just goes to show that the mainstream media has been very successful in getting everybody caught up in this Russian claim, or this mainstream media claim that the Russians hacked the election.
[00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:50.436]  Whereas they've gotten everybody diverted away from the true story with Seth Rich who was found mysteriously murdered after many people believe he leaked the DNC leaks.
[00:31:50.897 --> 00:31:53.720]  This is Millie Weaver signing off for InfoWars.com
[00:31:55.037 --> 00:32:04.604]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:06.786]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:07.527]  Think about it.
[00:32:07.727 --> 00:32:13.511]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:32:13.771 --> 00:32:19.336]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:32:19.716 --> 00:32:31.484]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:32:31.744 --> 00:32:34.505]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:32:34.706 --> 00:32:37.187]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:41.950]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:32:42.391 --> 00:32:42.951]  Think about it.
[00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:54.348]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.987]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.047 --> 00:33:05.008]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.148 --> 00:33:06.590]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.711]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:08.632]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.032 --> 00:33:11.235]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:13.157]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.177 --> 00:33:16.781]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately, your clinics.
[00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:17.462]  MycoCX.
[00:33:18.183 --> 00:33:18.803]  We're good to go.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.044]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:49.644]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:53.827]  So, we've been doing research just like you have on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.088 --> 00:34:01.453]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... And we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:04.656]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:13.203]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:16.145]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.185 --> 00:34:18.607]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.627 --> 00:34:20.329]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:27.912]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:37.197]  I've had nobody, here's the thing Alex, when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.757 --> 00:34:40.679]  It's going to show, you're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:45.402]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:45.883]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:46.843]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:48.124]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:48.705]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:49.866]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:51.887]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.689]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:56.230]  Yeast overgrowth.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.933]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:05.597]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:07.218]  What doctor?
[00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.380]  By the way, folks, look, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:11.162]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:12.724]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:14.606]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.726 --> 00:35:15.728]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:17.930]  Listen, this is religious for me.
[00:35:19.432 --> 00:35:21.975]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe it.
[00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:26.761]  If we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:28.763]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:29.904]  I'm ready to give my life.
[00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.085]  Everybody knows that against the enemy.
[00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.066]  Please.
[00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:34.328]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:35.469]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.290]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.210]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:42.235]  MycoZX antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.295 --> 00:35:43.035]  Get it today.
[00:35:43.136 --> 00:35:43.596]  Limited run.
[00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:44.617]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.759]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:48.901]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.921 --> 00:35:50.863]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great!
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:14.889]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:24.135]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swirl, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:24.895]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:27.497]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:29.138]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[00:36:29.378 --> 00:36:32.720]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.220]  That's amazing.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.900]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.162]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.182 --> 00:36:38.423]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:40.123]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.183 --> 00:36:41.284]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.304 --> 00:36:42.885]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:50.308]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:51.289]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:53.310]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.019]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.059 --> 00:36:58.801]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.941 --> 00:36:59.903]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.683 --> 00:37:05.524]  We are now joined by Tony Martin.
[00:37:05.564 --> 00:37:11.647]  He is the co-founder of the first Christian video game site on the internet, JillGames.com.
[00:37:12.087 --> 00:37:24.132]  And Tony actually came to our attention when we found out he wanted to create a series of video games that actually reveals the New World Order plans to undermine our national sovereignty in America.
[00:37:24.452 --> 00:37:25.633]  Thank you for joining me, Tony.
[00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:28.546]  Hey, it's an honor to be here with you and thank you so much.
[00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:32.911]  So this is an interesting project that you guys are working on at JillGames.com.
[00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.973]  I imagine it's a pretty original thing.
[00:37:34.993 --> 00:37:46.885]  You've had some experience making interactive games based on Bible verses and stuff in the past, but now you're upping it and you're making a New World Order revealing, a globalist revealing video game.
[00:37:47.205 --> 00:37:49.908]  Tell me about how you came upon thinking up this project.
[00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.231]  Thank you, Owen.
[00:37:51.391 --> 00:37:56.337]  Again, this is actually inspired by, I believe, God and Alex.
[00:37:56.717 --> 00:38:09.191]  Alex had been a fan and supporter, discovered him all the way back in 2003 on Coast to Coast, never heard of Bohemian Grove, and from that point on just became attached to InfoWars and a fan, and just God used him.
[00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:14.355]  As just a, you know, a bulldozer to open up a lot of what's really going on in the world.
[00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:21.921]  In the process of that, because he inspired it, he would say, you know, he'd get callers all the time that would say, hey Alex, you need to do this different, and you need to do that.
[00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:25.144]  And Alex would say, hey, I'm doing everything I can, how about you guys doing it?
[00:38:25.264 --> 00:38:28.367]  And let's make this a movement, not just a one-person thing.
[00:38:28.427 --> 00:38:34.212]  I mean, this is back in like 04 or 05, and God sort of gave me a vision at that point to pull together some programmers.
[00:38:34.592 --> 00:38:36.674]  It's taken a lot of years to see it actually happen.
[00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:46.202]  And put in a video game format exposing what's actually happening around us in the prison planet, that grid that's being put into place.
[00:38:46.442 --> 00:38:48.104]  And so it's our hope and prayer.
[00:38:48.184 --> 00:38:58.653]  And in that process, I work for a company called Kingsgate Media, where literally four of our top programmers from another company have said, yes, we want to come over.
[00:38:58.713 --> 00:38:59.734]  We want to help with this.
[00:38:59.774 --> 00:39:01.796]  These guys have worked on things like Call of Duty.
[00:39:02.156 --> 00:39:02.997]  We're good to go!
[00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:25.975]  Which is the most recent use for like Final Fantasy 7 and numerous games are shifting to that.
[00:39:26.556 --> 00:39:27.957]  So they're well-versed in that.
[00:39:28.898 --> 00:39:33.523]  We want to put out a top-line game that'll originally be launched on Steam platform.
[00:39:33.543 --> 00:39:35.705]  It used to be Greenlight, I guess it's Steam Direct now.
[00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:39.749]  And we hope to move that to Google Play, to the iStore, make it downloadable.
[00:39:40.229 --> 00:39:41.250]  And we're having a fundraiser.
[00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:49.333]  If you go to our website and you happen to want to help us, anybody that gets behind this on Kickstarter, all we need is about four or five hundred InfoWars to make this game happen.
[00:39:49.874 --> 00:39:52.355]  And it'll take us about seven months to a year to get it concluded.
[00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:59.478]  But in that next year, we're hoping to send beta versions to InfoWars and let Alex mention wanting to play it.
[00:39:59.918 --> 00:40:11.342]  So we would love to do that, but in there we want to reveal several layers in the storyline of what's actually going on in the New World Order and Illuminati and from a Christian perspective in times scenarios.
[00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:12.394]  Well, I love it.
[00:40:12.514 --> 00:40:15.576]  You know, you're saying, hey, this is a call to action.
[00:40:16.116 --> 00:40:17.578]  I can't expect somebody else to do it.
[00:40:17.678 --> 00:40:19.019]  I'm going to get out there and do it myself.
[00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:20.280]  Now you're putting in the legwork.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.781]  You're trying to get this game out there to the public.
[00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:23.622]  You know, that's amazing.
[00:40:23.642 --> 00:40:31.548]  You talk about these other big game, you know, companies, you know, producers coming in here and saying, hey, you know, maybe we don't want our name associated with this.
[00:40:31.568 --> 00:40:32.249]  They're a little afraid.
[00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:34.891]  I think that tells you kind of a sign of the political correct times.
[00:40:35.131 --> 00:40:37.032]  I still salute them for wanting to be involved.
[00:40:37.373 --> 00:40:38.553]  But just give me a little more detail.
[00:40:38.573 --> 00:40:39.995]  Let's talk about the details of the games.
[00:40:40.635 --> 00:40:40.955]  Sure.
[00:40:41.055 --> 00:40:42.896]  Oh man, great questions on all of them.
[00:40:42.916 --> 00:40:49.998]  Okay, so we were hoping in the storyline, if I can give that real quickly, it's based on a script that I'd written I'd hoped to see made into a movie.
[00:40:50.018 --> 00:40:50.799]  Obviously it didn't happen.
[00:40:58.101 --> 00:40:59.002]  But we're going to use it.
[00:40:59.102 --> 00:41:00.864]  We've transported it over into the game.
[00:41:00.904 --> 00:41:04.568]  And what will happen is it's set several years in the future, hypothetically, right?
[00:41:04.889 --> 00:41:11.997]  And the globalists are seizing more and more control, not because the nations want it, but because, just like what's happening today, it's being forced down our throats.
[00:41:12.477 --> 00:41:15.761]  And so, as evil always rises, and underground rises,
[00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:19.983]  So there's an underground in this game, and you're part of the underground, and there are elements within the U.S.
[00:41:20.023 --> 00:41:24.745]  military, as Alex has covered, you know, that are still loyal, and I think by and large.
[00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:26.486]  So these elements within the U.S.
[00:41:26.506 --> 00:41:28.527]  military, they're loyally got in the Constitution.
[00:41:28.988 --> 00:41:37.632]  They are funneling information equipment to the underground, and the underground is going to thwart and stall the installment of a one-world global
[00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:41.175]  You know, government, financial system, all of those things.
[00:41:41.555 --> 00:41:42.716]  And so you're part of the underground.
[00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:48.561]  Your character's dropped on an island that's called Acadian Island, and that ties into their whole Babylonian roots and everything.
[00:41:49.122 --> 00:41:56.749]  And I know we have a brief time here, but one of the things, a lot of things are going to be covered during the video vignettes, just as every movie, every game has that.
[00:41:56.769 --> 00:41:57.890]  You're going to have a storyline.
[00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.391]  We've got video actors.
[00:41:59.471 --> 00:42:00.572]  I mean, you know, all of that.
[00:42:00.612 --> 00:42:02.474]  You're going to have video vignettes that move the storyline along.
[00:42:02.494 --> 00:42:03.955]  You're going to learn about Jekyll Island.
[00:42:04.395 --> 00:42:08.878]  You're going to learn about the creation of the Federal Reserve, the reason why there are central banks.
[00:42:09.418 --> 00:42:28.869]  And excuse me for cutting you off here for a second, but from what I saw that you had helped make in the past, which was more targeted towards kids and youth, it appears to me that this is more of a role-playing game that would be targeted to an older audience, perhaps teenagers, even older, that's more flashy, more exciting, more explosive.
[00:42:29.249 --> 00:42:35.471]  Where they're not just getting in, getting the action-packed game, but there's also a plot that can kind of make them think, perhaps.
[00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:36.511]  Absolutely.
[00:42:36.551 --> 00:42:38.492]  This is teens to adults, to be honest.
[00:42:38.712 --> 00:42:39.392]  Absolutely.
[00:42:40.353 --> 00:42:41.513]  It's going to have action.
[00:42:41.533 --> 00:42:42.693]  It's going to have adventure.
[00:42:42.733 --> 00:42:46.174]  It's going to be, again, you know, like three of our four programmers have come over.
[00:42:46.214 --> 00:42:47.615]  Their credentials are incredible.
[00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:52.078]  They don't, again, want their names out in front right now because they're afraid of getting blacklisted.
[00:42:52.118 --> 00:42:52.879]  We understand that.
[00:42:52.919 --> 00:42:54.540]  We're just thankful they want to be a part of this.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:02.326]  But this would be a game that, when you get it, it would be on the level, you know, God willing, we've got to get the funding, but it'll be on the level of anything you've played out there.
[00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:08.211]  And in fact, our lead programmer, Justin Elms, is gifted at virtual reality, at 3D animations.
[00:43:08.911 --> 00:43:13.435]  He said, we're going to have a point at which, because there will be a CERN Hadron Collider, we're going to cover
[00:43:13.855 --> 00:43:14.636]  We're good to go!
[00:43:32.928 --> 00:43:33.449]  We're good to go.
[00:43:51.187 --> 00:43:52.588]  Throughout the game or in the credits, 100%.
[00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:57.511]  Everything you're seeing in this game is fact, and it's being built around you right now.
[00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:08.497]  And if ever there was a time to wake up, it's now, because I believe, I'm very optimistic, and I believe in God, and I believe there's biblical precedent for God for stalling in time events because people repented or woke up.
[00:44:08.957 --> 00:44:09.698]  I think it's happened.
[00:44:09.778 --> 00:44:10.838]  Alex has been a key part of it.
[00:44:10.878 --> 00:44:16.882]  I think it's happened many times the last 30, 40, 50 years where they wanted it to be now, and it didn't work out for them.
[00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:19.785]  And so we're hoping to actually get a lot of programmers.
[00:44:19.845 --> 00:44:23.309]  Ultimately, we want, like Alex said, we don't want this to be a one man band.
[00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:27.675]  We want this once you have one hit, you have other people want to copy it.
[00:44:27.775 --> 00:44:36.265]  So we're hoping this leads to an entire movement and a bunch of programmers stop being afraid and they get out there and start because, you know, programmers, just like any techie, they see what's happening.
[00:44:36.305 --> 00:44:38.808]  Yeah, and I was actually, that's kind of where I was going to go next.
[00:44:38.828 --> 00:44:42.973]  You know, you guys obviously, Jill Games being in control of this, you can control your own destiny.
[00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:44.395]  You can put whatever you want in there.
[00:44:44.675 --> 00:44:47.238]  You've obviously already got your narrative, your script written, ready to go.
[00:44:47.298 --> 00:44:49.901]  It sounds really exciting, like the perfect kind of app for flying.
[00:44:49.941 --> 00:44:50.522]  I fly a lot.
[00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:52.905]  That'd be something I'm excited to do on your phone or your tablet.
[00:44:53.485 --> 00:44:53.906]  Uh huh.
[00:45:11.065 --> 00:45:24.217]  Is it the people, and you're saying these people are coming in, they want to work with you, obviously they don't want to get blacklisted from their companies, but you're saying that just the kind of concept and the notion that this video game is coming out is kind of starting to draw some attention from within the industry.
[00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:37.355]  Absolutely, and again, it's just all credit in the world to even have a couple of these guys decide, hey, well, you know, because they have their own company names, and they said, you know what, we're going to quietly come in on this, we'll work with you.
[00:45:37.595 --> 00:45:43.198]  Again, it takes funding, so please, again, just about four to five hundred InfoWars will make this game happen if they want to.
[00:45:43.218 --> 00:45:47.501]  We have some of the best perks I've ever seen on Kickstarter, if you guys would go to that and check it out.
[00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:49.482]  That being said, absolutely.
[00:45:49.523 --> 00:46:02.295]  They know, they can see, they're in the tech world, they can see how we're being built into this 1984 quote-unquote prison planet, and the guys that are dealing with us are specifically Christians, so they know about the End Times, Book of Revelation, Daniel, that type of stuff.
[00:46:02.695 --> 00:46:07.480]  But nevertheless, there's even the techies that aren't, and we believe this is going to be a secular crossover game.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.264]  We're aligning it so that it could hit all markets, to the patriot and to the truther.
[00:46:11.724 --> 00:46:14.306]  But that being said, yeah, the techies aren't stupid.
[00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:19.249]  They know what's happening out there, and I think it emboldens them, just like Alex has done.
[00:46:19.529 --> 00:46:20.090]  It emboldens.
[00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:30.157]  When you see somebody getting successful at it, waking up millions of people, if we could even just have that one hit, by the grace of God, it's going to wake up a lot of other techies, and they're going to embolden.
[00:46:30.177 --> 00:46:31.878]  They're going to get emboldened to say, you know what?
[00:46:31.918 --> 00:46:33.299]  We're not going to roll over here, man.
[00:46:33.339 --> 00:46:34.400]  We are fighting for freedom.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:34.900]  Let's do it.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.782]  And there are other games out there like Assassin's Creed where I have a lot of people say, well, that's exposing the Templars.
[00:46:39.842 --> 00:46:42.484]  I'm like, but it's another false paradigm behind that one.
[00:46:42.884 --> 00:46:43.764]  It's just a trap.
[00:46:43.824 --> 00:46:50.027]  This is going to be a game that really, really, really exposes the globalists, all their powers, all their agendas.
[00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:53.269]  And we're only beholden to God for the truth if we have the money.
[00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.669]  That's all.
[00:46:53.709 --> 00:46:54.670]  We have the talent now.
[00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.971]  As in the last year, it's all come together.
[00:46:57.111 --> 00:46:59.472]  That's Tony Martin from JillGames.com.
[00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:00.492]  Thank you for joining us, Tony.
[00:47:00.753 --> 00:47:01.333]  Thank you, Owen.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:07.775]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.435 --> 00:47:10.016]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:15.419]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.759 --> 00:47:21.223]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.603 --> 00:47:28.207]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:29.988]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.790]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.072]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.492 --> 00:47:40.115]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.877]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.487 --> 00:48:00.611]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.233]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:03.334]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:08.338]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:13.462]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:18.847]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.068]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:22.830]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.230]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.434]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.454 --> 00:48:49.475]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:50.516]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.556 --> 00:48:51.176]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.537 --> 00:48:59.084]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.104 --> 00:48:59.965]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:00.025]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.132]  We're going to talk to Lee Stranahan, and of course we've talked to him before.
[00:49:07.152 --> 00:49:12.495]  He's been a reporter from a wide variety of news outlets, from Breitbart to Huffington Post.
[00:49:12.535 --> 00:49:16.517]  You can find him at thepopulist.us, also on Twitter, at Stranahan.
[00:49:16.557 --> 00:49:20.959]  I know you wanted to talk about what's happening with George Soros and his war on law enforcement in Florida.
[00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:24.201]  You've got a whole series on that at thepopulist.us.
[00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:27.243]  I think this is especially important, David, because it's Police Week.
[00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.977]  And we've already had two cops shot and one killed this week.
[00:49:31.997 --> 00:49:33.079]  This is when we honor police.
[00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:35.523]  George Soros has been engaged last year.
[00:49:35.543 --> 00:49:38.147]  He spent millions of dollars in local races.
[00:49:38.728 --> 00:49:40.531]  And he's had an effect in Florida.
[00:49:41.147 --> 00:49:49.192]  An attorney, a state's attorney, he helped elect, said she's not going to file the death penalty on any cases, including that of an alleged cop killer.
[00:49:49.532 --> 00:49:50.973]  I have it at thepopulist.us.
[00:49:51.013 --> 00:49:53.034]  We're going to have more coming on this.
[00:49:53.334 --> 00:50:01.719]  This is how Soros doesn't just affect things internationally and nationally, but he's now working on a local level, David, and it's very dangerous, especially in law enforcement.
[00:50:01.879 --> 00:50:06.842]  The way I like to work is, and what we're doing at The Populist, is I give people enough material
[00:50:07.782 --> 00:50:09.843]  Completely vetted research material.
[00:50:10.123 --> 00:50:16.907]  There's no conjecture here, so people can look into it themselves, because I've noticed people who like news like digging into stuff, right?
[00:50:16.987 --> 00:50:29.153]  And so, George Soros last year launched an initiative where in 11 different states, he began putting money into municipal and state attorneys races.
[00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:30.634]  Now, this is really smart.
[00:50:30.674 --> 00:50:34.536]  Don't forget, George Soros, I don't like the guy, but he's a genius, okay?
[00:50:34.556 --> 00:50:36.037]  He's an economic genius.
[00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:44.509]  And he realized, simple economics, most of these local district attorney races, people spend like a thousand bucks.
[00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:45.930]  Does that, you see what I'm saying?
[00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.691]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:50:46.891 --> 00:50:52.255]  It's the old slogan, you know, think globally and act locally, and that's exactly what he's doing.
[00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.736]  He's working at the grassroots level.
[00:50:53.756 --> 00:50:57.900]  That's why it's so difficult to get people to act at the local level.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:04.365]  They only want to look at politics at the highest level, at the national level, usually only at the presidential level do they get interested.
[00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:08.520]  That's right, and Soros saw an opportunity here.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:17.804]  And so what he did was, and again, this is verified by Wall Street Journal, Politico, this is no conjecture here, okay?
[00:51:19.745 --> 00:51:21.705]  He put money into 11 different races.
[00:51:21.765 --> 00:51:24.727]  He helped knock Sheriff Joe out of Maricopa County, for instance.
[00:51:24.767 --> 00:51:25.527]  Yes, yes.
[00:51:25.967 --> 00:51:27.168]  Spent a lot of money there, yeah.
[00:51:27.708 --> 00:51:29.149]  The way he did it, it's real simple.
[00:51:29.189 --> 00:51:31.950]  In most of these races, he could put $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 into a race.
[00:51:35.706 --> 00:51:46.711]  In the case, for instance, in New Mexico, in Bernalino County, the Republican opponent literally had to withdraw because he was being outspent so badly.
[00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:49.092]  He literally just said, I quit, okay?
[00:51:49.252 --> 00:51:54.854]  Now, this was very effective, and because it's happening on a state and municipal level,
[00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:57.756]  It sort of rolled under the radar.
[00:51:57.817 --> 00:52:13.160]  There were a few, like I say, Politico wrote about it, Wall Street Journal wrote about it, Daily Signal wrote about it, but there were some national stories, and I wrote about a little bit too, because you have to remember, of course, David, George Soros was also a big funder of the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:13.600]  Oh yeah.
[00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:22.003]  And one of the things I detail in that populist story, I did a big three-part series, because people often ask me, they'll say, what's Soros after?
[00:52:22.883 --> 00:52:23.023]  Right?
[00:52:23.063 --> 00:52:23.663]  What's his goal?
[00:52:24.739 --> 00:52:26.580]  And I know what his goal is.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:32.402]  The Black Lives Matter movement, one of their goals is literally prison abolition.
[00:52:33.343 --> 00:52:33.703]  Okay?
[00:52:34.743 --> 00:52:37.224]  And that's because they're spiritual.
[00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:38.825]  They're not just spiritual.
[00:52:40.305 --> 00:52:46.968]  The grandfather of the Black Lives Matter is founded by three women, Patrice Cullors, Elisa Garza, and Opal Tometi.
[00:52:47.808 --> 00:52:49.129]  Patrice Cullors' mentor,
[00:52:49.741 --> 00:52:51.102]  was a guy named Eric Mann.
[00:52:51.262 --> 00:52:55.966]  Eric Mann was a Weather Underground Radical, an associate of Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dorns.
[00:52:56.906 --> 00:53:01.770]  And what they believed in was what the Black Panther Party believed in in 1966.
[00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.772]  It's in their program.
[00:53:04.232 --> 00:53:06.934]  They want to release every black person from prison.
[00:53:07.014 --> 00:53:08.375]  That's their explicit goal.
[00:53:08.875 --> 00:53:15.721]  Their argument is that no black person has ever received a fair trial in the United States because it's a racist country.
[00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:16.601]  That's their argument.
[00:53:17.382 --> 00:53:17.522]  So
[00:53:18.502 --> 00:53:21.183]  Eric Mann wrote a book about this guy, George Jackson.
[00:53:21.263 --> 00:53:23.444]  His girlfriend was Angela Davis.
[00:53:23.464 --> 00:53:24.565]  You've heard about Angela?
[00:53:24.665 --> 00:53:24.925]  Oh yeah.
[00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:26.646]  Free Angela, with the hair.
[00:53:28.266 --> 00:53:31.848]  Angela Davis is the inspiration for Michelle Alexander.
[00:53:31.888 --> 00:53:34.369]  Michelle Alexander wrote the book, The New Jim Crow.
[00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.691]  And Angela Davis is a prison abolitionist.
[00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:40.972]  She's written major works on this.
[00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:45.214]  Michelle Alexander, there's a video of her up on, just Google on YouTube.
[00:53:45.894 --> 00:53:47.795]  Angela Davis, Michelle Alexander.
[00:53:48.257 --> 00:53:54.365]  And you'll find Michelle Alexander sitting next to Angela Davis saying, this is my inspiration.
[00:53:54.926 --> 00:54:02.335]  So what they talk about is, and here's the way they sell it, David, and it appeals to libertarians, so it's interesting.
[00:54:03.537 --> 00:54:04.078]  They'll say,
[00:54:04.853 --> 00:54:08.815]  Mandatory minimum sentences, well you end up with non-violent drug offenders.
[00:54:09.175 --> 00:54:13.177]  And we need to ease up on non-violent drug offenders.
[00:54:13.537 --> 00:54:17.279]  Now that's an argument that I think for people like you and I is probably pretty compelling.
[00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:19.740]  We'd go... Yeah, as a matter of fact, I covered that yesterday.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.622]  I talked about Senator Rand Paul saying you don't know what the real Jim Crow laws are.
[00:54:24.262 --> 00:54:51.999]  It's the mandatory minimums, because that's what's locking up people, and we see, we know that black people are not using drugs at a higher rate than white people are, but they're going to prison at a much higher rate, but the mandatory minimum thing is, just drug prohibition, the drug war in general, is something that is very troubling, and I think that Sessions, Attorney General Sessions' movement to restore this mandatory minimum stuff, I think that is really going to backfire on them politically, and I think it's going to feed this whole Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:54:52.917 --> 00:54:59.361]  I've said the same thing, and I've got to point out that I'm sympathetic to that argument, but I want to point out the danger here, because there is one.
[00:55:00.141 --> 00:55:07.044]  I could show you video of the leaders of this movement, including a former Symbionese Liberation Army.
[00:55:07.064 --> 00:55:09.126]  Remember the SLA, Patty Hearst?
[00:55:09.766 --> 00:55:10.946]  Former SLA guy.
[00:55:11.427 --> 00:55:16.749]  They admit that they use the non-violent drug offenders.
[00:55:16.769 --> 00:55:17.690]  They say, look, there's only
[00:55:18.834 --> 00:55:21.095]  A few hundred thousand of those non-violent drug offenders.
[00:55:21.456 --> 00:55:24.457]  Our actual goal is to release 11 million people from prison.
[00:55:24.798 --> 00:55:28.140]  By the way, 11 million people from prison is the entire prison population.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.401]  I could show you a video where they admit that.
[00:55:30.801 --> 00:55:34.444]  So the danger is, they're very smart, you see?
[00:55:35.564 --> 00:55:38.466]  They understand they need to get a little bit of a coalition going.
[00:55:38.926 --> 00:55:42.869]  And so they understand libertarians like Rand Paul, like the Koch brothers, okay?
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.542]  We'll come out and they're in favor of that.
[00:55:45.562 --> 00:55:47.685]  And again, I'm sympathetic to that argument.
[00:55:47.705 --> 00:55:56.476]  I think, especially when it comes to, I agree with you, Jeff, nobody who voted for Donald Trump wanted Jeff Sessions to go after marijuana users.
[00:55:56.776 --> 00:55:57.237]  Nobody.
[00:55:57.757 --> 00:55:58.058]  Okay.
[00:55:58.979 --> 00:55:59.980]  That being said.
[00:56:02.565 --> 00:56:08.588]  I think we need to be a little careful of what the end goal is, and you can keep both of those things in mind, right?
[00:56:08.628 --> 00:56:09.188]  Sure, sure.
[00:56:09.529 --> 00:56:22.495]  And I think if we look at George Soros, the bigger picture, the final endgame, I believe, is something like we've seen in the color revolutions that he's funded throughout Europe, in terms of creating a... and he has to have a good cause here.
[00:56:22.915 --> 00:56:30.419]  And what they have done throughout Europe is basically they create revolutions, I think, based on political... based on economic classes.
[00:56:30.939 --> 00:56:35.920]  Here we have the sense of upward mobility except for racial classes.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:40.621]  So what they try to do is they try to create and build on this racial division.
[00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:45.262]  That's what Bill Ayers and the rest of them have historically done to sell their communist movement when they brought it here.
[00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:51.063]  They brought it here based on a racial movement rather than economic classes like they did in Europe.
[00:56:51.103 --> 00:56:53.023]  And I think that's really where this is headed.
[00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:53.543]  Would you agree?
[00:56:54.263 --> 00:56:54.984]  I 100% agree.
[00:56:55.064 --> 00:56:57.124]  And not only that, let me prove your point.
[00:56:57.896 --> 00:56:58.837]  We talked about this.
[00:56:58.897 --> 00:57:03.601]  I was in a film called Occupy Unmasked with my friend Andrew Breitbart, directed by Steve Bannon.
[00:57:04.842 --> 00:57:16.271]  In Occupy Unmasked, which is about the Occupy Wall Street movement, Anita Moncrieff, one of the people in the film, she says at the end, the next step in this is going to be moving it to race.
[00:57:16.932 --> 00:57:20.895]  Because if you look at Occupy Wall Street, it was about class.
[00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:21.576]  1% versus 99%.
[00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:25.643]  And it didn't really kick in.
[00:57:25.663 --> 00:57:28.726]  It doesn't work in America, but race does work in America.
[00:57:29.207 --> 00:57:39.077]  Exactly right, which is why the next iteration of it was Black Lives Matter, which directly connects to Occupy Wall Street, but they've changed the tactics.
[00:57:39.117 --> 00:57:42.600]  Now, by the way, where's Black Lives Matter move now?
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.242]  What's the current state of the movement?
[00:57:45.063 --> 00:57:45.723]  Antifa.
[00:57:46.244 --> 00:57:46.424]  Yes.
[00:57:46.994 --> 00:58:01.942]  The current state, we went from Occupy Wall Street, I see a line between Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and by the way, if you trace the line back, you go to the WTO battle for Seattle in the 90s, and if you keep tracing it back, you get to the weather underground.
[00:58:02.302 --> 00:58:08.586]  I mean, when I say this, literally, Eric Mann is the mentor of Patrisse Cullors from Black Lives Matter.
[00:58:09.126 --> 00:58:14.429]  He recruited her, his word, when she was 17 and a half years old.
[00:58:14.749 --> 00:58:16.530]  She spent the next 12 years with him.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:30.315]  learning revolutionary organizing she started black lives matter when i say a direct line i mean literally she learned at the feet of eric man whose hero was
[00:58:31.297 --> 00:58:34.818]  George Jackson, who was connected to Angela Davis directly.
[00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.979]  I mean, not just connected, they were lovers.
[00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:50.303]  If you look at Bill Ayers and you look at the fact that it was Weather Underground that created white skin privilege, they've now shortened it to white privilege, and then he stopped bombing buildings and started educating kids in his propaganda, his racialism.
