[00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:14.344]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:16.125]  It is Thursday, March 9th, 2017.
[00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:19.387]  I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:31.593]  Tonight, pressure moving in the other direction as the Vault 7 leaks and other intel moves the discussion to the Obama White House on alleged wiretapping.
[00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:40.218]  Also, will the establishment use the recent revelation of big data to scare the people of planet Earth into a world government?
[00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:51.599]  Plus, do the deep state and CIA digital hacking grid structure pose a threat to the citizens of the United States in the form of foreign hacking into their personal devices?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.145]  And then, the ultimate cringe fest, as we take a look at the ultimate compilation of social justice warrior Trump protesters.
[00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.927]  You couldn't help interrupting, could you?
[00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:07.370]  I have heart failure, I don't have children, I f***ing lost faith!
[00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.331]  You added nothing to that conversation.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.912]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:13.764]  When it comes to the latest data dump by WikiLeaks, former Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich says that Vault 7 reveals America is sliding towards totalitarianism.
[00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:16.987]  He said that this demonstrates the U.S.
[00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:19.209]  is sliding down a slippery slope.
[00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.493]  And the former congressman suggests the wholesale gathering of the nation's haystack of information by the government has eroded the concept of a right to privacy.
[00:03:28.873 --> 00:03:32.414]  Now take note all of you wild Antifa people out there.
[00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:37.536]  This all happened and it was empowered by the Obama administration.
[00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:45.219]  Now no doubt this deep state has been growing in power throughout the decades but President Obama really ramped up
[00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.879]  I think so.
[00:04:08.132 --> 00:04:08.592]  We're good to go.
[00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:42.040]  To having their information hacked by hackers because the CIA utilized these backdoors.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.021]  And this is very true.
[00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:53.445]  It's so important that Alphabet's Eric Schmidt is saying that big data is so powerful, nation-states will fight over it.
[00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:57.506]  And he says he who has the data can do the analytics and the algorithms.
[00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:01.708]  The scale that we talk about will provide huge nation-state benefits.
[00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:06.290]  In terms of global companies and benefits for their citizens and so on.
[00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:21.416]  So he knows that's why they are just going out of their way to collect all of the private data they can on all these citizens with Google, with now Alphabet, these other companies because they know that big data is extremely powerful and they want to own as much of it as possible.
[00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:25.698]  Not just your little status updates but your biometric information as well.
[00:05:26.098 --> 00:05:31.745]  They know that that is going to be so invaluable to many countries that they will actually fight over it.
[00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:34.027]  They're saying that data is the new oil.
[00:05:34.488 --> 00:05:45.380]  So that's just to kind of let you understand the extent of danger that the CIA has left the American people in with leaving these technologies susceptible to hacking.
[00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:52.343]  If hackers have access to this information, then who knows what dangers are out there, if the nation states are willing to fight over it.
[00:05:52.823 --> 00:06:04.426]  And then so James Comey, kind of on the heels of this Vault 7 information, he doesn't say, you know, we're really sorry for doing it, you know, we try our hardest to abide by the Constitution.
[00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:05.426]  He just says,
[00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:06.746]  You know what?
[00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:10.088]  Your memories are open to government scrutiny.
[00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:14.030]  He said there's no such thing as privacy in America.
[00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.331]  And he was speaking at a conference.
[00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:23.756]  Comey states that all Americans should now accept that their conversations and communications may not remain private.
[00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.877]  And listen to how casually he says this.
[00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:30.094]  Even our memories are not absolutely private in America.
[00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:36.958]  Any of us can be compelled, in appropriate circumstances, to say what we remember, what we saw.
[00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:44.723]  Even our communications with our spouses, with our clergy members, with our attorneys, are not absolutely private in America.
[00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:47.905]  There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America.
[00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:54.109]  To achieve the very, very important goal of privacy, and to achieve the very important goal of security.
[00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:03.261]  So now that the cat's out of the bag, WikiLeaks has revealed, and they said that this is just 1% of the information that they have to reveal from Vault 7.
[00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:05.741]  I mean, we have just gotten a huge explosion.
[00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:12.103]  It's like the tip of the iceberg of the information that WikiLeaks has a hold of, according to WikiLeaks.
[00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:19.044]  So Comey and the FBI, these intelligence agencies, they know what's coming, and so they're not even apologizing for it.
[00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.825]  They're not even going to allow the American people to get upset about it.
[00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:28.171]  They're just going to get out ahead of it and normalize this kind of surveillance that the government is engaged in.
[00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:35.378]  They're telling us that we have to do this in order to protect you from terrorism, to stop terrorist nations from getting into America.
[00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:43.545]  So Comey is going on to say that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy in our homes, in our cars, in our devices.
[00:07:45.107 --> 00:08:00.837]  Right, and this is even after we've all learned that the CIA has backdoored the devices, these smart devices that are going to be in our homes, so even there we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy because they don't even need to compel a judge to
[00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:02.358]  We're good to go.
[00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:28.592]  He said, you know, we tried to break into a lot of other devices, too.
[00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:30.072]  We weren't successful there.
[00:08:30.172 --> 00:08:31.512]  So, you know, this is OK.
[00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:39.975]  It's a good balance between the civil liberties is that they still, at this point at least, at least to what we're being told, don't have the capabilities to hack into all devices.
[00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:42.535]  But believe you me, they will soon enough.
[00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:52.218]  But I can't believe that that's what he's using to justify the fact that they are maintaining a good balance between civil liberties and protecting security, that it's still intact.
[00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:53.038]  It's ridiculous.
[00:08:53.718 --> 00:09:06.007]  And now, going back to the DNC hack, an ex-Intel officer said that it's ex-NSA officials who carried out the DNC hack to expose Hillary.
[00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:07.708]  And now Alex Jones has been saying this.
[00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:10.170]  People have come on the show to say this as well.
[00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.992]  This is former intelligence officer Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaffer.
[00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:18.856]  He was on Sean Hannity's show last night, and he told Hannity, Sean, we did it!
[00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:27.401]  Not me, but our guys, former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers, use these tools to break in there and get the information out.
[00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:32.204]  That's what the Democrats don't want to talk about because it doesn't fit their narrative.
[00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:42.210]  So Hannity said, OK, wait a minute, are you saying that they carried it out using these malware techniques that were exposed in Vault 7 and they put the Russians' fingerprints on it?
[00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:52.173]  So the whole Russian story that the media has been running with for months and months and months is that our people, they did it and they just put the fingerprints of the Russians on it.
[00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:54.834]  He says, yes, of course, which is exactly what we've been saying.
[00:09:55.474 --> 00:09:57.455]  The evidence is not that the Russians did it.
[00:09:57.835 --> 00:10:01.036]  The evidence is that a Russian tool was used.
[00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:08.961]  Concerned Americans fed up with the Clintons doing things, I think, were the ones who actually got in there, broke the information out and gave it to WikiLeaks.
[00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:11.922]  That's exactly what WikiLeaks and Julian Assange said as well.
[00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:23.229]  People inside the DNC most likely fed up with the Clintons, fed up with the fact that they totally rigged the entire process against Bernie Sanders in her favor.
[00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:30.134]  They were just fed up with the corruption of the Clintons and they did not want to see the Clinton regime get put back in power.
[00:10:30.974 --> 00:10:38.982]  And again, here's your daily reminder that the FBI Russia probe failed to find any evidence against Trump.
[00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:39.402]  U.S.
[00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:46.830]  officials say a months-long FBI counterintelligence investigation into Russian attempts to manipulate the U.S.
[00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.713]  election did not bring up enough evidence to charge anyone criminally.
[00:10:51.434 --> 00:11:07.645]  Agents who investigated claims of computer server activity tied to Russia and then-president-elect Trump's businesses in Trump Tower came to the conclusion that no disreputable contacts, financial transactions, or encrypted communications occurred with the Russians.
[00:11:08.185 --> 00:11:09.966]  Nothing there folks.
[00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:13.009]  It's a big nothing burger as they've been saying over and over again.
[00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:21.094]  The Russia narrative is collapsing and that is why pressure is building on the Obama administration and specifically
[00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:22.875]  We're good to go.
[00:11:45.464 --> 00:11:47.085]  They've been waiting since 2015.
[00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:57.450]  Another representative, Mike Turner, who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has been waiting to see the unclassified version of this CIA report that was presented to the White House.
[00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.513]  So again, no evidence presented to show any ties to Russia.
[00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:10.778]  All the evidence is showing that Obama used his power to spy on his political opponents, and that is why they are absolutely scrambling.
[00:12:10.818 --> 00:12:11.278]  The thing that's
[00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:17.403]  Interesting is that this opponent now happens to be the President of the United States of America.
[00:12:17.423 --> 00:12:19.345]  So there could be some big time trouble here.
[00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:27.012]  And it's so interesting that they really try to throw this to oust Trump, to tie him to Russia, say he was a Russian agent so they could impeach him.
[00:12:27.352 --> 00:12:35.260]  And now it's all coming back on President Obama saying, wait a minute, if you are engaged in a coup here, then you're the one that should be in trouble.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.763]  And so this is a great article by Andrew C. McCarthy at the National Review.
[00:12:40.203 --> 00:12:42.285]  Definitely check out the thing in full if you can.
[00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:47.988]  But he gets in to how there's a FISA gate.
[00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:50.690]  The Times is actually revising its history in real time.
[00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.332]  We're seeing stories being memory hold.
[00:12:53.692 --> 00:13:01.718]  A lot of people are tweeting out the article where the New York Times was calling it a wiretap and then about a couple months later they're saying there was no wiretap.
[00:13:02.618 --> 00:13:10.100]  He says this media Democrat complex has been caught in its own web, and now there is serious skullduggery underway.
[00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:12.661]  It's revisionist history, Soviet style.
[00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:15.662]  You know, the kind where the bad stuff gets disappeared?
[00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:17.863]  And that's exactly what is happening.
[00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:22.424]  New York Times is disappearing its claim that Obama investigated Trump.
[00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:29.066]  Now, for months they have been telling us, the mainstream media has been telling us, that there was an investigation underway.
[00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:31.007]  They were encouraging us to believe it.
[00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:37.032]  Because they were saying there was a vigorous national security investigation of the Trump presidential campaign.
[00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:37.833]  It was ongoing.
[00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:41.936]  New York Times called it a counterintelligence investigation.
[00:13:42.617 --> 00:13:49.083]  So they're really trying to push this because, of course, that makes it look like President Trump is a Russian agent and he needs to be impeached.
[00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:50.704]  So they're just hammering this down.
[00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:54.928]  But when this election hacking narrative went on for too long, there was no proof.
[00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:57.791]  The risk that the Democrats were running became clear.
[00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:14.931]  And that is, if the FBI had been investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded in purported Russian hacking of the election, that meant the incumbent Obama administration must have been investigating the campaign of the opposition party's presidential candidate.
[00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:16.312]  Can't do that.
[00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:21.954]  The investigation of the Trump campaign could actually be a much bigger scandal.
[00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:31.138]  That President Obama and his Justice Department may have used its legal authorities to investigate the Democrats' top political adversary.
[00:14:31.498 --> 00:14:40.621]  And of course, this would have been done at the very same time the same Obama Justice Department was bending over backwards to whitewash
[00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:41.661]  We're good to go.
[00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:01.433]  Obama was never investigating Trump.
[00:15:01.453 --> 00:15:02.113]  You're silly.
[00:15:02.213 --> 00:15:04.496]  Obama is just furious over these claims.
[00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:05.897]  How dare Trump tweet that out?
[00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:09.221]  Even though this is a thing they've been pumping out for months.
[00:15:09.682 --> 00:15:18.551]  So on January 20th, when the New York Times was trying to promote this, they had the headline, wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.
[00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:30.938]  But now, if you go, it's been updated and the new headline, readers are told, intercepted Russian communications, part of inquiry into Trump associates.
[00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:34.000]  So they've completely changed the headline.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.241]  The story has been memory hold.
[00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:38.282]  And now they're trying to tell all of us.
[00:15:38.962 --> 00:15:49.326]  That President Obama wasn't wiretapping Trump, even though the New York Times based its entire story on the wiretap data that was used in the inquiry of the Trump aide.
[00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:51.587]  So that's how stupid they think we all are.
[00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:53.507]  Nothing to see here, folks.
[00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:54.828]  Move right along.
[00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:00.060]  Right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.060]  Kim.com.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.320]  Trump is in danger.
[00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:05.762]  Mega upload founder warns president in series of tweets.
[00:16:06.162 --> 00:16:13.324]  The man who predicted that WikiLeaks release of John Podesta's emails would bring down Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is now warning that President Trump
[00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:13.804]  Yes.
[00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:44.525]  What spurred this?
[00:16:44.885 --> 00:16:55.415]  Following WikiLeaks Vault 7 release of CIA files and the intensification of what Donald Trump's battle with the deep state has been, Kim warned in a tweet today that Trump is in danger.
[00:16:56.056 --> 00:17:05.885]  He tweeted, Rogue group of Obama loyalists at CIA used powerful cyber warfare tools to illegally spy on Trump and fabricated Russia narrative.
[00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:07.306]  Big danger.
[00:17:08.314 --> 00:17:17.341]  So is he only referring to the Vault 7 releases and what we know the CIA and government cyber officials have the ability to do?
[00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:20.363]  Or does he know exactly what they're trying to do?
[00:17:20.423 --> 00:17:23.025]  Does he have some other intelligence that's going on here?
[00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:31.672]  Because now the general public is well aware, or should be, with the Vault 7 release, that the CIA can do everything you thought they could.
[00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:33.453]  Well, that would be amazing if that were true.
[00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:34.634]  One domino falls, game over.
[00:17:34.674 --> 00:17:36.375]  Let's hope we can get to that point.
[00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:39.937]  But, let's remember, James Comey just said, you're stuck with me for another six and a half years.
[00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:43.079]  So now James Comey is a huge obstacle for Donald Trump to seek justice.
[00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:11.234]  The deep state in alliance with Barack Obama is attempting to sabotage Trump's embryonic administration with a series of leaks that they hope will lead to his impeachment or resignation.
[00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:18.656]  So right, they're trying to set up a narrative, they're trying to put evidence, they're trying to stage a false flag, do whatever it takes to bring Donald Trump down.
[00:18:18.856 --> 00:18:22.497]  Whether that means getting blackmail, listening to his phone calls, setting up
[00:18:22.517 --> 00:18:22.837]  I don't
[00:18:38.544 --> 00:18:40.566]  They're gonna act like Vault 7 doesn't exist!
[00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:42.127]  I couldn't believe the TV!
[00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:50.275]  They're still saying that Trump is crazy for thinking that anybody would be spying on him when we know for a fact they can spy on everybody!
[00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:59.584]  So it'll be interesting to see if Kim.com has anything more to say or if Donald Trump comes out and even attacks the deep state harder.
[00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:02.687]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.360]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.528]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.828 --> 00:23:00.752]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.492 --> 00:23:07.694]  What have we really been seeing?
[00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:14.040]  And how can we look at what we've really been seeing to know where it is going?
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:21.666]  Emotional outbursts, panic, tantrums, frustration, fear, intolerance, violence.
[00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:26.230]  Could we be witnessing a case of mass hysteria?
[00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:40.791]  A phenomena that transmits collective illusions of threats, whether real or imaginary, through a population in society as a result of rumors and fear.
[00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:45.956]  Or could we be seeing the dangerous results of indoctrination?
[00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:54.698]  Indoctrination, the process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically.
[00:23:55.498 --> 00:23:59.499]  Or is it that we may be seeing a mixture of both?
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.001]  And if so, what could be causing this epidemic?
[00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:10.684]  Well, I'm going to be taking you on an investigative adventure to unmask this phenomena.
[00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:15.207]  So what are social justice warriors exactly?
[00:24:16.008 --> 00:24:35.005]  Social justice warriors could be described as volatile, ultra-progressive, left-leaning advocates of safe spaces, feminism, gender identity, political correctness, and multiculturalism that desire to create a totalitarian system that attempts to censor speech,
[00:24:35.525 --> 00:24:42.309]  And promote fringe lifestyles while actively discriminating against men, particularly white men.
[00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:45.931]  Now, let's define what anti-fascists are.
[00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:58.310]  Anti-fascists, a network of independent and grassroots groups working together against the rise of racism and fascism in our communities.
[00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:10.974]  Or, what most people know them as, a group of communist-leaning social justice warriors that riot and enact violence in order to stomp out perceived fascists.
[00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:17.747]  So let's start where I started.
[00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:24.192]  The local anti-fascist group, Revolutionary Student Front's Facebook page.
[00:25:24.972 --> 00:25:40.805]  The first post I noticed was that which discussed the recent March for Trump in Austin, where a group of anti-fascists went to in an attempt to shut it down, which resulted in an anti-fascist journalist, Kit O'Connell's, arrest.
[00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:47.148]  They had a fundraiser page where they were asking for donations for their arrested comrade.
[00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:57.674]  The money will go to support Kit's hospital bill, replacement glasses, missed work and other medical expenses, as well as legal fees, said the post.
[00:25:58.034 --> 00:25:59.295]  They even raised $2,000.
[00:26:00.075 --> 00:26:07.279]  So my next question was, who were these donors funding the anti-fascists?
[00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:12.689]  The donor page had names of the donors and their contributions.
[00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:18.455]  So the next question to answer was, who exactly were these people?
[00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:26.464]  Many were fellow college students, but the most shocking finding of all was that some were professors.
[00:26:26.904 --> 00:26:29.587]  Yes, university professors.
[00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:46.307]  So why would a university professor be donating money to an arrested individual that's a member of the extremist group, Anti-Fascists, that is known for rioting, vandalism, and attacking Donald Trump supporters?
[00:26:47.328 --> 00:26:50.189]  Now, the trail led me to the universities.
[00:26:50.789 --> 00:27:10.955]  In this article, it talked about how students that took specific social justice studies received $2,800 in scholarships, and they even gained special privileges, which gained them access to use a special computer lab, cameras, and radio equipment.
[00:27:11.895 --> 00:27:20.600]  Why would universities be giving scholarships and special privileges to students that took social justice studies programs?
[00:27:21.441 --> 00:27:30.887]  So the next logical thought was to look into these social justice programs and I decided the University of Texas would be a good start.
[00:27:31.707 --> 00:27:35.569]  I found the Human Rights and Social Justice Program.
[00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:42.333]  Upon reading the program summary, it seemed pretty mild, although one sentence stuck out.
[00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:59.343]  Finally, through the Connecting Experience component of the program, students will have the opportunity to complement their coursework with hands-on experience in an organization working on human rights and social justice concerns.
[00:28:00.003 --> 00:28:04.984]  Then I found the link to the Human Rights and Social Justice Faculty Panel.
[00:28:05.604 --> 00:28:11.466]  It had a long list of professors that each had a summary of their coursework expertise.
[00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:22.869]  What began to become apparent upon simply reading their own description of what they taught is that these professors shared some pretty extreme left ideologies.
[00:28:23.729 --> 00:28:35.879]  And with a simple YouTube search, you could find these professors giving lectures where you could hear their leftist extremist ideologies, some even verging on Marxism.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.484]  Here, I want to ask what may seem like a simple and even obvious question.
[00:28:41.504 --> 00:28:42.805]  Where does racism come from?
[00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:46.652]  From what roots does racism arise?
[00:28:47.273 --> 00:28:49.534]  And I think that question also is a simple answer.
[00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:51.815]  It comes from white supremacy.
[00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:59.478]  The idea that non-white people are inherently inferior in intellectual or moral terms from white folks.
[00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:05.962]  Let me start with a clear statement on my own position on these two cults I'm speaking of.
[00:29:06.502 --> 00:29:10.804]  First of all, I am anti-capitalist without hesitation.
[00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:18.736]  The sense of the way I'm using this term, cult, what I'm really arguing is that capitalism can never be anything but a cult.
[00:29:19.537 --> 00:29:26.526]  Capitalism is not only a cult, but essentially at this point, quite clearly, a kind of death cult.
[00:29:27.657 --> 00:29:45.489]  The conclusions you would draw on crucial issues, if you consulted God's Word, if you consulted the design of nature, and what your senses and understanding of the world empirically could convey to you, or if you stepped back and looked, as our founding fathers did, at what kind of republican principles the basic opinions of mankind demanded.
[00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:54.496]  That the law of God, the law of nature, and the laws of republican government, the authority of republican government, were all aligned.
[00:29:54.836 --> 00:29:55.977]  This all comes apart.
[00:29:58.437 --> 00:30:07.164]  In the debate over slavery, the convergence of them collapsed and even the sources of authority themselves became inherently incoherent.
[00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:26.841]  I think you as teachers, when you're teaching especially the expository literature of the Civil War period, can use these three sources of authority to sort of get your students inside some of these texts to ask them, what are these writers basing their arguments on?
[00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:40.289]  Then I looked at KVRX, the Austin UT College radio station, and lo and behold, the students running the radio were affiliating with outspoken Antifa members.
[00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.456]  I even came across a UC Berkeley college radio interview
[00:30:45.796 --> 00:31:01.048]  With the professor, it's important to note that the interview is about a book that this professor published about fascism just before the UC Berkeley riots broke out where anti-fascists shut down a Milo Yiannopoulos event.
[00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:27.374]  Trump became sort of leader of the wingnut Tea Party branch of birthers and from there he gained a significant right-wing reactionary following which he was able to parlay into his presidential bid and through that campaign he became kind of a figurehead for
[00:31:28.388 --> 00:31:36.170]  A lot of Nazis and traditionalists and old school southern neo-confederates.
[00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:47.854]  And so it was through that coalition, if you will, of fascists that Trump was able to really compete for presidency and eventually win.
[00:31:48.894 --> 00:31:52.095]  More recently, warnings of a creeping fascism have returned.
[00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:53.515]  I don't know who's doing that.
[00:31:55.115 --> 00:32:02.637]  If we consider the left's embrace of equality as its defining characteristic, fascism remains decisively on the right.
[00:32:03.197 --> 00:32:11.558]  Obviously, he needs to be opposed on every level, and obviously he's not only benefiting from the rise of fascism, he's facilitating it.
[00:32:11.778 --> 00:32:14.099]  Can we make the call that the alt-right is fascist?
[00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:19.742]  Yeah, absolutely, that is a fascist movement and it has to be opposed physically and ideologically.
[00:32:20.923 --> 00:32:30.468]  And this professor talked about Alex Jones and in so misrepresented Alex's political beliefs in order to create a false dichotomy.
[00:32:32.026 --> 00:32:41.872]  What they did, along with like Alex Jones and people like that, is create this alt-universe where globalization was a creation of the left.
[00:32:42.553 --> 00:32:57.882]  Globalization was the economic expression of an ideology that they referred to as globalism, which is created by cultural Marxists and Jews who are trying to deracinate the people of Europe and white people in the United States.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.962 --> 00:37:14.112]  Someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:37:14.554 --> 00:37:21.720]  This young generation who scream words like fascist have actually themselves become the fascists.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.542]  You guys are the fascists!
[00:37:23.702 --> 00:37:25.183]  You're all the fascists!
[00:37:25.383 --> 00:37:26.644]  You're a white male!
[00:37:26.784 --> 00:37:34.171]  I just wish that somebody would create like some kind of a safe space where we could all just go and f***ing hate!
[00:37:34.551 --> 00:37:39.515]  You're a f***ing white man who gets to do whatever he wants to in this space, right?
[00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:40.836]  You need to get out.
[00:37:40.896 --> 00:37:42.037]  I actually don't.
[00:37:42.117 --> 00:37:42.658]  Alright.
[00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:52.716]  So the question is, are social justice warriors mentally ill, or are they just stupid?
[00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:54.537]  When your emotions control your actions,
[00:38:11.812 --> 00:38:18.973]  It affects not only yourself, but the people around you.
[00:38:19.714 --> 00:38:24.915]  There are over 7 million mentally ill and emotionally disturbed children in America.
[00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.155]  This has to be a joke!
[00:38:26.275 --> 00:38:27.895]  I cannot believe this is happening!
[00:38:28.195 --> 00:38:31.336]  I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself and I'm not kidding!
[00:38:31.536 --> 00:38:34.176]  You better f***ing fix this right now!
[00:38:34.196 --> 00:38:35.477]  Get the f*** out of here!
[00:38:35.517 --> 00:38:37.337]  He's just losing control of himself.
[00:38:37.517 --> 00:38:38.338]  Get your phone away!
[00:38:38.358 --> 00:38:38.418]  Why?
[00:38:38.558 --> 00:38:39.679]  Quit recording!
[00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:42.141]  The madder he gets, the worse it becomes.
[00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:46.504]  Get the f**k away!
[00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:48.466]  You couldn't help interrupting, could you?
[00:38:48.606 --> 00:38:49.907]  I have heart failure!
[00:38:50.047 --> 00:38:51.268]  I don't have children!
[00:38:51.428 --> 00:38:52.709]  I f**king love faith!
[00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:54.971]  You added nothing to that conversation.
[00:38:54.991 --> 00:38:58.074]  These are some of Tommy's drawings that the school sent over.
[00:38:58.094 --> 00:39:03.498]  There's an awful lot of hate in them.
[00:39:03.738 --> 00:39:07.081]  I am a nasty woman.
[00:39:13.363 --> 00:39:17.467]  Like your wet dreams infused with your own genes.
[00:39:17.527 --> 00:39:21.810]  But yeah, I'm a nasty woman.
[00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:28.176]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:39:28.296 --> 00:39:30.198]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[00:39:43.347 --> 00:40:01.591]  The public is being dumbed down.
[00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:03.912]  We're being chemically drugged in the food and water and air.
[00:40:04.232 --> 00:40:05.412]  That's now on record.
[00:40:05.432 --> 00:40:11.974]  90% of children in this country are getting
[00:40:12.779 --> 00:40:14.701]  This huge number of vaccinations.
[00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:28.052]  And despite the fact that we have this compelling evidence that it is harmful to the developing brain, we have health care officials who are totally ignoring this.
[00:40:28.152 --> 00:40:30.314]  Once again, once again they have ignored it.
[00:40:30.334 --> 00:40:32.376]  See look, see now this is the whistling thing.
[00:40:32.416 --> 00:40:36.960]  Death to the fascist insect who preys upon the blood of the people!
[00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:50.851]  The Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace were, with tax-exempt dollars, funding leftist propaganda operations aimed at changing America through the brain, not the battlefield.
[00:40:51.331 --> 00:40:53.511]  I didn't realize this was live, but f**k all you people.
[00:40:53.652 --> 00:41:00.173]  If only they put as much energy into having an actual argument as they did smashing Starbucks windows.
[00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:05.095]  If you follow him through, you're going to see him looking more and more miserable.
[00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:09.903]  And then you're going to see him at the end.
[00:41:10.643 --> 00:41:17.666]  He's holding his left arm out, up like this, clenched fist, little hair, very unhappy.
[00:41:18.047 --> 00:41:23.769]  And his t-shirt says, Our Lady of the Benevolent Dictatorship One World Global Training Corps.
[00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:24.389]  Yes!
[00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.132]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:43.213]  When we look at vaccinations, this country vaccinates children at a rate higher than anywhere in the entire world.
[00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:49.996]  They get something like 46 different antigen exposures before they start school.
[00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:54.618]  When you over-vaccinate, it interferes with the development of the brain.
[00:41:55.558 --> 00:41:57.719]  And then the child has difficulty learning.
[00:41:57.919 --> 00:42:03.141]  Every white person in the United States of America was socialized in a country that is racist.
[00:42:03.281 --> 00:42:04.842]  They become behavioral problems.
[00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:12.675]  And their brain cannot develop normally.
[00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:35.680]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:42:47.277 --> 00:42:49.139]  Listen, do you hear?
[00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:51.821]  That is the sound of communist suffering.
[00:42:52.561 --> 00:43:02.969]  It has to be a joke!
[00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:06.211]  I cannot believe this is happening!
[00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:14.552]  I'm a professor!
[00:43:14.713 --> 00:43:17.577]  And get past the fact that she is a woman!
[00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.217]  We have to get out of here!
[00:43:27.657 --> 00:43:32.400]  What role does the tech industry have to increase civil engagement?
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.584]  Technology has a role in that we communicate, we provide communication platforms to the rest of the f***ing country.
[00:43:39.245 --> 00:43:43.408]  And we are allowing s*** to happen, just like the cable news networks, just like talk radio.
[00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:54.575]  It's a propaganda medium, and if people aren't aware of the s*** that they're being told, if they're being told a story of fear, if they're being told a story of other, if they're not understanding that people are trying to use them to get to the f***ing office.
[00:43:54.995 --> 00:43:58.357]  I am so sad, and I am so angry.
[00:43:58.797 --> 00:44:00.158]  Yeah, you're an idiot.
[00:44:00.258 --> 00:44:03.100]  You're an idiot, okay?
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.762]  I am a nasty woman.
[00:44:06.802 --> 00:44:07.383]  Be silent!
[00:44:07.723 --> 00:44:10.565]  This will not stand, and you're going to fight for your rights.
[00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:11.125]  Stand up!
[00:44:11.145 --> 00:44:15.167]  Stand the f*** up right now!
[00:44:15.528 --> 00:44:16.748]  Stand up!
[00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:22.372]  I'm just encouraging people, right now, it's okay to operate on your raw energy and emotion.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.446]  Use your aggressive feelings, boy.
[00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:30.472]  Let the heat flow through you.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:37.044]  The results of the election were a stark reminder that we still live in a white supremacist, patriarchal nation.
[00:44:37.204 --> 00:44:39.826]  I would like to say to him, Miet!
[00:44:40.206 --> 00:44:40.766]  Miet!
[00:44:41.747 --> 00:44:42.307]  Miet!
[00:44:43.048 --> 00:44:43.788]  Miet!
[00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:46.410]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.852]  There will be casualties on both sides.
[00:44:49.232 --> 00:44:52.755]  There will be because people have to die to make a change in this world.
[00:44:53.395 --> 00:44:56.738]  Change that will require sacrifice, people.
[00:45:00.908 --> 00:45:06.733]  Change that will require many of us to make different choices in our lives.
[00:45:06.753 --> 00:45:09.315]  My question to you today is, are you ready?
[00:45:09.335 --> 00:45:10.076]  I said, are you ready?
[00:45:37.055 --> 00:45:43.318]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:54.444]  That's what basically, like for me, it's just about everyone being united together and like having the same opinions.
[00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:58.756]  Have you ever seen anything like this before?
[00:45:58.776 --> 00:46:00.158]  Nobody's seen this for a hundred years.
[00:46:00.578 --> 00:46:02.840]  Political f***ing message right here.
[00:46:03.881 --> 00:46:04.561]  Look at that.
[00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:10.026]  That's just beautiful, isn't it?
[00:46:10.126 --> 00:46:11.187]  F***ing beautiful.
[00:46:11.247 --> 00:46:15.631]  We reject the President-Elect!
[00:46:15.791 --> 00:46:18.953]  We reject the President-Elect!
[00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:20.815]  He's not in line to find us.
[00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:24.331]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:24.351 --> 00:46:24.771]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:25.252]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:25.272 --> 00:46:25.752]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:25.772 --> 00:46:26.272]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:26.712]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:26.732 --> 00:46:27.153]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:27.173 --> 00:46:27.693]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:27.713 --> 00:46:28.193]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:28.213 --> 00:46:28.633]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:29.153]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:29.174 --> 00:46:29.634]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:30.254]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:30.274 --> 00:46:30.694]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:30.714 --> 00:46:31.234]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:31.254 --> 00:46:31.795]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:31.815 --> 00:46:32.275]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:32.295 --> 00:46:32.815]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:32.835 --> 00:46:33.375]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:34.396]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:34.456 --> 00:46:34.936]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:34.956 --> 00:46:35.617]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:35.637 --> 00:46:36.057]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:36.077 --> 00:46:36.497]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:36.517 --> 00:46:36.937]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:36.957 --> 00:46:37.457]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:37.477 --> 00:46:37.958]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:40.699 --> 00:46:42.540]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.422]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:46.442 --> 00:46:47.242]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:47.722]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:48.322 --> 00:46:48.783]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:48.803 --> 00:46:49.503]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:49.943]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:49.963 --> 00:46:50.463]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:50.484 --> 00:46:50.904]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:50.924 --> 00:46:51.364]  He will not divide us!
[00:46:51.384 --> 00:46:51.544]  He will
[00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:07.754]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:10.015]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:15.399]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:21.204]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.604 --> 00:47:28.189]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.990]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.848]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.328]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:04.169]  I tried it.
[00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.309]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.430]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.811]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:20.051]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:22.792]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.952 --> 00:48:23.172]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.494]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.060]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.960]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.020]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.613 --> 00:49:16.445]  Well, with the latest WikiLeaks data dump, Vault 7 has really brought to the forefront how we are absolutely under constant surveillance.
[00:49:16.645 --> 00:49:26.236]  FBI Director James Comey is actually trying to normalize the absurd amount of surveillance that's happening with the American people and the world at large, saying
[00:49:27.077 --> 00:49:30.359]  All Americans, that's right, where we have the Constitution here to protect us.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.280]  Nah, forget it.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.665]  All Americans should now accept that their conversations and communications may not remain private.
[00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:42.408]  In fact, they might even turn your television on without your knowledge and spy on you.
[00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:44.089]  Owen Schroer joins me now.
[00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:55.257]  This is just insane because they're not even giving the public the time to get frustrated about this or to stop and say, well, wait a minute, isn't this violating the first, fourth, fifth,
[00:49:56.318 --> 00:49:58.842]  I'm not kidding, that's literally in my notes.
[00:49:58.923 --> 00:50:00.826]  We should be pissed, this is a violation.
[00:50:01.467 --> 00:50:02.068]  Like, that's it.
[00:50:02.088 --> 00:50:03.350]  I mean, really?
[00:50:04.192 --> 00:50:04.392]  Right.
[00:50:04.692 --> 00:50:10.075]  And they're trying to get out in front of this because, frankly, more is coming from Vault 7.
[00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:12.316]  WikiLeaks says that this is just the beginning.
[00:50:12.336 --> 00:50:27.704]  They're trying to figure out how they can work with tech companies, which to me is insane because we can see in some of these upcoming stories just the amount of, you know, don't be evil that Google is engaged in when it comes to storing and collecting our data.
[00:50:28.284 --> 00:50:29.245]  This is very frightening.
[00:50:29.545 --> 00:50:35.447]  Well, and what, you know, obviously we've seen the stories, you know, Facebook wants to predict the future, Amazon wants to predict the future.
[00:50:35.627 --> 00:50:47.090]  Ultimately, I guess they think that with all of this intelligence gathering and data gathering online, that essentially they can just predict human behavior and then essentially, I guess, manipulate it with their
[00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:48.551]  We're good.
[00:51:06.994 --> 00:51:16.017]  The media isn't providing the accurate attention to this, or reporting it in the right way, so that the American people can respond correctly.
[00:51:16.057 --> 00:51:22.000]  Because this is just flat out, 100% a violation of our rights to privacy, folks.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.901]  And here's the thing, we already assumed that this was going on, so this is nothing new.
[00:51:25.921 --> 00:51:30.243]  So of course James Comey can come up here and say, oh yeah, Americans should just accept that this is going on.
[00:51:30.643 --> 00:51:31.864]  I've already accepted that.
[00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:33.124]  I already know that is going on.
[00:51:33.144 --> 00:51:35.645]  That's why I've been complaining about it for the last, you know, five years.
[00:51:35.665 --> 00:51:35.765]  Right.
[00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:36.526]  Trying to do something about it.
[00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:37.306]  Draw attention to it.
[00:51:37.566 --> 00:51:38.446]  And that's just it.
[00:51:38.486 --> 00:51:39.787]  The media is not going to talk about it.
[00:51:39.827 --> 00:51:50.052]  And they're going to say it's because they're taking the high road and they don't want to endanger American citizens by putting out the techniques that the CIA is using to keep us all safe.
[00:51:50.492 --> 00:51:52.192]  We need this to give up our freedom and security.
[00:51:52.213 --> 00:52:00.016]  And they had the other story where the FBI didn't want to put out their means of how they located all the people that were distributing the child porn on the dark web.
[00:52:00.236 --> 00:52:02.116]  So they actually let someone go.
[00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:04.517]  They had over 200 prosecutions ready to go.
[00:52:04.797 --> 00:52:07.458]  And the FBI would not divulge how they got the intel.
[00:52:07.618 --> 00:52:08.458]  So they let them go.
[00:52:08.738 --> 00:52:10.738]  Vault 7 divulged that intel.
[00:52:10.959 --> 00:52:11.179]  Right.
[00:52:11.239 --> 00:52:15.500]  But you know, it is wild, Leigh-Anne, because like I said, we've all known that this is going.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.461]  Now we just say, oh, now we know for a fact, so let's just let it keep going.
[00:52:19.481 --> 00:52:21.281]  I guess that's what James Comey is insinuating.
[00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:32.398]  Absolutely, and just wants to normalize this so that the rest of Americans, when you try to have this conversation on Facebook with your friends, they can all just poo-poo it and tell you, you know, we need this, it keeps us safe.
[00:52:32.879 --> 00:52:37.363]  But the thing that is just really so frustrating to me is that people like
[00:52:38.064 --> 00:52:44.528]  Eric Schmidt, okay, formerly known just from Google and Don't Be Evil, but it's Alphabet's Eric Schmidt.
[00:52:44.548 --> 00:52:52.473]  So now it's this even more overarching technology company that's even bigger than Google that we don't even know what they're involved in yet.
[00:52:52.533 --> 00:52:53.974]  This is like super secret, deep-sea stuff.
[00:52:54.014 --> 00:52:55.475]  Yeah, most people probably don't even know about Alphabet.
[00:52:55.635 --> 00:52:56.035]  Exactly!
[00:52:56.095 --> 00:53:01.479]  It's like they had to rebrand themselves off something Google, which is... Everyone knows Google.
[00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:02.480]  It's become a verb.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.181]  Just Google it.
[00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:10.186]  They've rebranded themselves to Alphabet, which means they've got even bigger things in the works, and he is there bragging to...
[00:53:11.647 --> 00:53:12.067]  Absolutely.
[00:53:41.947 --> 00:53:46.291]  Just immediately, as fast as you can, upload that information to the cloud.
[00:53:46.391 --> 00:53:54.518]  Don't build your own data centers where you have control over this very valuable gold of people's information.
[00:53:54.578 --> 00:53:55.839]  Give it all to Google.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.121]  Put it all in the cloud.
[00:53:57.141 --> 00:53:57.821]  Yes, trust us.
[00:53:57.881 --> 00:53:59.142]  Yeah, we'll take it all.
[00:53:59.162 --> 00:54:00.263]  We'll take care of that for you.
[00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:00.544]  Yes.
[00:54:01.064 --> 00:54:05.208]  And all your biometric information in addition to... Meanwhile their stocks soar.
[00:54:05.548 --> 00:54:16.357]  Yeah, in addition to all of your personal information, your health history, all your financial information, and then his ex-wife owns the 23andMe where they get all of your DNA.
[00:54:16.478 --> 00:54:18.439]  So, I mean, they want it all.
[00:54:18.479 --> 00:54:21.082]  They want all your biometric, all your facial recognition.
[00:54:21.722 --> 00:54:26.446]  And these are the people that want to be in control of everything, where in the future,
[00:54:27.487 --> 00:54:29.409]  This is going to be the president.
[00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:40.899]  We're not even going to have the opportunity to elect him because he is just going to control us, which is why when Stephen Hawking comes out and says, without a world government, technology will destroy us.
[00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:44.943]  So here Stephen Hawking is pushing for a world government because we need it.
[00:54:45.623 --> 00:54:54.687]  In order to be able to fight against the future AI, which is going to be very good at accomplishing its own goals.
[00:54:55.027 --> 00:54:57.928]  And if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble.
[00:54:58.368 --> 00:55:04.110]  But that's not going to stop them from moving ahead and building this AI that is going to destroy civilization.
[00:55:04.991 --> 00:55:09.092]  But in order to stop it from, you know, annihilating us... Yeah, they're going to do it anyway.
[00:55:09.132 --> 00:55:13.034]  We need to let people like Eric Schmidt and George Soros... Yeah, so we should just kowtow because he's going to do it anyway.
[00:55:13.054 --> 00:55:14.315]  Yeah, I saw that with...
[00:55:15.925 --> 00:55:16.405]  I don't know.
[00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:31.952]  Nation states.
[00:55:32.232 --> 00:55:33.453]  This is going to be the new push.
[00:55:33.473 --> 00:55:41.639]  They're going to say, look, we've got this huge hub of data and right now it's centralized in a private faction.
[00:55:41.699 --> 00:55:42.960]  We need to make this global.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.421]  We need to make it public.
[00:55:44.721 --> 00:55:45.582]  It's too powerful.
[00:55:45.622 --> 00:55:47.123]  We can't just have this for now.
[00:55:47.163 --> 00:55:48.144]  People are going to try to fight.
[00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:48.784]  They're going to spy.
[00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:54.429]  They're going to probably blame the Russians, you know, and they're going to say, this is why we need to have one world government so we can all have this data.
[00:55:54.689 --> 00:56:00.233]  So while we're spying and manipulating and controlling the whole world, you're just letting us do it because we're the government.
[00:56:00.593 --> 00:56:03.537]  So that's why I think this is so key when he says nation states.
[00:56:03.677 --> 00:56:03.777]  Right.
[00:56:03.897 --> 00:56:04.818]  I think he's making...
[00:56:06.316 --> 00:56:13.162]  The first initiative in the rhetoric that's going to say, globalism to save us, essentially, from big data.
[00:56:13.863 --> 00:56:15.284]  I don't know, that's kind of how I feel about this.
[00:56:15.304 --> 00:56:18.006]  That's when I saw nation states that really stuck out for me.
[00:56:18.186 --> 00:56:19.707]  Right, well that's a very good point.
[00:56:19.787 --> 00:56:22.990]  And it's just interesting how they're already trying to normalize this.
[00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.554]  You see young kids today, they don't have any concept of privacy, what that would even mean.
[00:56:27.934 --> 00:56:29.876]  Why would you want privacy in your own home?
[00:56:30.196 --> 00:56:34.319]  I'm going to Snapchat every single thing that's going on around me, with or without your permission, and then
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.461]  Upload it to YouTube and hope it becomes a viral sensation.
[00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:58.564]  I mean, we're living in a totally different world now, which sure, that's fine, but the fact is, is that we have people in control of this future burgeoning world government who don't necessarily have the entirety of the planet's best wants, desires, needs in mind.
[00:56:58.604 --> 00:56:59.984]  They have their own sort of control.
[00:57:00.344 --> 00:57:02.165]  Now, I know we only have a couple minutes left here, so
[00:57:03.465 --> 00:57:15.892]  We need to just switch gears here and just go hard left so that you can continue on your role of calling out the idiot of the day.
[00:57:15.912 --> 00:57:19.014]  Today's idiot, I guess, is going to be Samantha Bee.
[00:57:19.034 --> 00:57:21.776]  Her episode, Full Frontal, with Samantha Bee.
[00:57:22.677 --> 00:57:31.922]  So this is pretty pathetic, but Samantha Bee is trying to make fun of conservatives at CPAC, and she's going around and pointing out people's haircuts.
[00:57:31.962 --> 00:57:35.684]  Of course, people that don't like judging you by your appearance will judge you by your appearance.
[00:57:36.404 --> 00:57:46.409]  And it turns out that one of the people at CPAC that she was making fun of, Kyle Coddington, actually was a victim of stage 4 brain cancer.
[00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:49.311]  Yeah, if you scroll you can get a picture of his haircut.
[00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:51.172]  And so he had to have the haircut.
[00:57:51.232 --> 00:57:56.513]  And she's like, oh, look, he's got his Nazi hair and this guy is so funny.
[00:57:56.773 --> 00:58:00.234]  And then he and his sister actually tweeting out like, oh, get this.
[00:58:00.334 --> 00:58:01.835]  Of course, you know, the sister calls her out.
[00:58:01.855 --> 00:58:05.376]  But then Kyle himself actually makes light of it.
[00:58:05.756 --> 00:58:06.296]  So what do you know?
[00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.037]  The conservative with brain cancer.
[00:58:08.437 --> 00:58:13.318]  Who's getting made fun of because of his haircut, because of his brain cancer, by the intolerant left.
[00:58:13.458 --> 00:58:14.418]  I mean, Samantha Bee.
[00:58:14.438 --> 00:58:16.099]  What do you think Bee stands for?
[00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.059]  I got an itch over here.
[00:58:18.259 --> 00:58:19.259]  And then he laughs about it.
[00:58:19.299 --> 00:58:20.019]  He makes a joke of it.
[00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:21.780]  So who's the real tolerant side here?
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:22.680]  But there you go.
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.900]  There's the left failing again.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.880]  Samantha Bee.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.401]  I have an itch over here.
[00:58:26.421 --> 00:58:28.921]  She doesn't even apologize for calling him a Nazi.
[00:58:29.061 --> 00:58:30.622]  Oh yeah, then she just apologizes.
[00:58:30.802 --> 00:58:32.302]  We're sorry you got offended.
[00:58:32.862 --> 00:58:33.982]  We're sorry you got offended.
[00:58:34.002 --> 00:58:35.342]  We didn't know you had brain cancer.
[00:58:35.402 --> 00:58:37.823]  You're still a Nazi, but you know.
[00:58:38.163 --> 00:58:41.205]  Sorry for defaming you and hoping it goes viral on the internet.
[00:58:41.625 --> 00:58:42.566]  Ridiculous!
[00:58:42.606 --> 00:58:45.188]  Well, thank you very much for calling out the intolerant left.
[00:58:45.568 --> 00:58:48.390]  And thank you all for tuning in to the show tonight.
[00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:51.532]  We will see you here again tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[00:58:51.572 --> 00:58:51.953]  Central.
[00:58:52.253 --> 00:58:56.216]  Catch Owen Schroer and I. We will be hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show tomorrow.
[00:58:56.236 --> 00:58:57.517]  That starts at 11 a.m.
[00:58:57.577 --> 00:58:57.877]  Central.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.122]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.723]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:47.610]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
