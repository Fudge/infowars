[00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.291]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.191]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:22.313]  It's Monday, July 3rd, 2017.
[00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:23.253]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:42.982]  Anti-Trump protesters showcased their ignorance yesterday as hundreds marched on the streets of Austin, Texas to demand the impeachment of the president.
[00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:53.344]  Owen Schroer reports from the belly of the beast where the liberal mental disorder was on full display at the Capitol.
[00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:57.084]  You have no logical case for what you're f***ing saying.
[00:00:57.184 --> 00:00:57.905]  Oh, okay.
[00:00:57.985 --> 00:00:59.145]  Well, I think he's a traitor.
[00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:02.099]  Why is he a traitor?
[00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.962]  Plus, the state of Nevada legalizes marijuana.
[00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:08.563]  It's a trap!
[00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:09.984]  But wait a minute.
[00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:13.646]  They left in laws to entrap tourists.
[00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:15.107]  And that can't be good.
[00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:20.131]  All that plus much more, up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.880]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.461]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:58.945]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.206]  We're good to go.

[00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.874]  Well, tomorrow is July 4th, the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:22.101]  And we need to remember that it's not only a Declaration of Independence, it's a Declaration of the Principles of Individual Liberty.
[00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.525]  It's also a Declaration of Secession.
[00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:32.331]  And today we have the Drudge Report with a Daily Mail article talking about the disunited states.
[00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:42.635]  And so we're going to talk about the institutions that people trust, the institutions that they don't trust, and surprisingly it's the intelligence communities and the courts that they're telling us that they trust.
[00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:52.659]  We'll question that, but we're also going to take a look at the state of disunion in terms of calls for secession, particularly in Texas and in California as we go back and forth.
[00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:59.402]  We're also going to look at some issues of individual freedom that are centered around moves to get rid of drug prohibition.
[00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:00.122]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:07.705]  Let's take a look first at this story from the Daily Mail saying that 6 in 10 Americans say they don't trust the Trump administration.
[00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:08.445]  That's the way they title it.
[00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:11.647]  But they also point out they don't trust Congress and the media.
[00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:16.689]  They have even worse numbers than the Trump administration and said hardly anyone trusts opinion polls.
[00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.370]  So then why are we talking about this?
[00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.394]  That's a good question, especially because this is a Marist NPR poll.
[00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:26.857]  NPR, people you can always trust to tell the truth, right?
[00:04:27.698 --> 00:04:30.060]  Let's look at what they're pushing on us.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.942]  I think it's very important to understand this.
[00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:40.370]  What they're telling us is that, and here's the numbers, they're saying 60% of the people support the intelligence community, 60% support the courts.
[00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:41.791]  Seriously?
[00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:52.593]  And we just broke the story yesterday about how this massive lie about 17 intelligence agencies show that there's a Trump-Russia connection.
[00:04:53.547 --> 00:05:01.154]  We look at it, we had a retraction from the New York Times, we had a retraction from Reuters after having pushed this since October.
[00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:04.897]  Because it was Hillary Clinton that came up with that in one of the debates.
[00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:09.001]  And Julian Assange immediately said, this is one of the most absurd lies we've ever seen in our lives.
[00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:15.706]  You realize, of course, that these 17 intelligence agencies include things like the Coast Guard, Air Force reconnaissance and so forth.
[00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:16.767]  They're not involved in this.
[00:05:16.787 --> 00:05:18.128]  They're not saying that this is the case.
[00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:19.810]  And so they retracted it.
[00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.113]  The New York Times said, no, it was only four agencies.
[00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:23.435]  And it wasn't four agencies.
[00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:25.397]  Reuters says, no, it was three agencies.
[00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:26.879]  No, they were wrong as well.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.206]  It wasn't that the DNI, the Department of National Intelligence, is not an agency.
[00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:37.172]  The agencies that they said had authorized this were the CIA, the NSA, and the FBI.
[00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.533]  Nevertheless, it wasn't really those agencies.
[00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:53.750]  As we learned in May, and it was WorldNetDaily that pointed this out, in testimony from Clapper, former DNI Director, he said that, actually that's redundant, the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, when Clapper was testifying,
[00:05:54.631 --> 00:06:02.113]  He said that they presented this information to a panel of select hand-picked individuals from those three agencies.
[00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:07.275]  In other words, sycophants that could be relied on to tow the party line.
[00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:08.696]  And he said nobody objected.
[00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:09.656]  Therefore...
[00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:13.309]  That was the consent of those three agencies, according to him.
[00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:22.298]  And then he put this out, and since he was the head of the 17 agencies, he continued to push this lie from Hillary Clinton that it was 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.443]  This, folks, is what's called a violation of the Hatch Act.
[00:06:27.043 --> 00:06:29.626]  Somebody who is sitting in this position of authority,
[00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:31.848]  interfering in our elections.
[00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:34.510]  They were quick to call FBI Director Comey on it.
[00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.692]  They should be calling these other people on it.
[00:06:36.732 --> 00:06:47.440]  We should have some prosecutions of the Hatch Act, and we should also have some prosecutions of violations of the Constitution, violations of even the Patriot Act and the FISA Act that extended their powers.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.901]  They've ignored all these.
[00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.242]  The FISA court has told us that.
[00:06:50.262 --> 00:06:53.965]  This is not an anonymous source in the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:55.066]  No, it is
[00:06:55.806 --> 00:07:02.231]  It's FISA court that is telling us this, and it is Clapper who has exposed that lie in his own testimony.
[00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:06.695]  But these are the people that we supposedly trust, according to NPR.
[00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:14.361]  I mean, is this Operation Mockingbird, the CIA operation to control the media, to get them to tell us what the CIA wants to hear?
[00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:18.985]  How else could we explain this in a post-Snowden world?
[00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.092]  People trusting the intelligence community more than anything else?
[00:07:23.352 --> 00:07:24.472]  That's patently absurd.
[00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:27.174]  And we'll take a look at the courts as well when we come up here.
[00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.775]  But then they come, look at the other numbers they've got.
[00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:32.496]  Public opinion polls, they say 35% of the people trust public opinion polls.
[00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:33.617]  I think that's a bit high.
[00:07:34.017 --> 00:07:35.198]  The Trump administration, they say 37%.
[00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:39.360]  That also does not jive with the numbers that we've seen.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.742]  We've seen much higher approval of the Trump administration in other polls.
[00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:44.162]  For Congress, they say it's 29%.
[00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:47.466]  That's ridiculously high.
[00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:56.030]  Most of the polls that we've been seeing in the last years have had Congress with single-digit approval ratings, and then they say the media at 30%.
[00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.772]  Okay, we'll just leave it at that.
[00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:00.373]  This is NPR.
[00:08:00.673 --> 00:08:05.936]  This is a poll, which nobody trusts, but let's take a look at some other news about the intelligence community.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.746]  And this is, I guess you could call this the intelligence community, this is the DEA, it's federal law enforcement, with a single wiretap order.
[00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:14.907]  The U.S.
[00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:19.050]  authorities listened in on 3.3 million phone calls.
[00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.411]  This is from ZDNet.
[00:08:21.012 --> 00:08:26.036]  They say the order was carried out in 2016 as part of a federal narcotics investigation.
[00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:34.283]  Again, folks, the war on drugs is a war on the Constitution, a war on the rule of law, a war on our individual liberties.
[00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:34.663]  U.S.
[00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:39.804]  authorities intercepted and recorded millions of phone calls last year under a single wiretap order.
[00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.005]  You know, as Rand Paul points out, you know, Mr. and Mrs. Verizon.
[00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:47.985]  How do you give probable cause for 3.3 million people with one order?
[00:08:48.185 --> 00:08:48.686]  Well, you don't.
[00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:50.006]  You just ignore the law.
[00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.886]  You ignore the Constitution.
[00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:55.367]  3.29 million cell phone conversations over just a two-month period.
[00:08:55.807 --> 00:09:01.448]  The authorities noted that the surveillance effort led to no incriminating intercepts.
[00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:06.956]  None of the handful of those arrested have been brought to trial or convicted.
[00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:09.761]  Yet, they violated the law.
[00:09:10.442 --> 00:09:10.963]  What do you do?
[00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:15.287]  When the law enforcement officers regularly violate the law.
[00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.428]  Who watches the Watchers?
[00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:17.989]  Has always been the question, right?
[00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:21.591]  What do we do when our government becomes the biggest criminal?
[00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.532]  And of course, that is always the issue.
[00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:30.896]  Whether we talk about illegal torture programs or whatever, we need to understand that we cannot allow our government to become lawless.
[00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:36.079]  We give them a tremendous amount of power and they have to be constrained by the law.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.082]  Or they will become the criminals that are the worst criminals.
[00:09:40.102 --> 00:09:42.464]  They will become the terrorists that are the worst terrorists.
[00:09:42.885 --> 00:09:49.650]  There is no worse criminal or terrorization than you can find with the government coming after the individual citizens.
[00:09:49.710 --> 00:10:03.781]  And as one person who is with Stanford's Law School Center for Internet and Society said, they spent a fortune tracking 26 people and recording 3 million conversations and apparently got nothing.
[00:10:04.322 --> 00:10:05.683]  Now I would say he's wrong about that.
[00:10:06.263 --> 00:10:09.905]  What they got were new illegal powers.
[00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:11.826]  New powers in their minds.
[00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:13.487]  Things that they're going to do again.
[00:10:13.507 --> 00:10:14.307]  They set a precedent.
[00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:23.552]  He said, I'd love to see the probable cause affidavit for that one and wonder what the court thought on its first 10-day reviews when Zip came in.
[00:10:23.612 --> 00:10:24.273]  Nothing came in.
[00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:35.179]  Now in a related story, we see from Miami Herald, the latest attorney-client privacy issue at Guantanamo is called unintentional listening.
[00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.514]  You realize how they do this all the time?
[00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:41.299]  Oh, we unintentionally got information on Donald Trump.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:48.970]  We unintentionally got information on the Trump transition team, especially Michael Flynn, and we revealed that in violation of the law.
[00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:54.137]  They also did it to senators, to congressmen, to journalists, to pastors.
[00:10:54.177 --> 00:10:57.700]  Remember the times that we played, many times we played the Michael Hayden quote for you?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.882]  We don't listen to bad people, he says.
[00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:03.765]  We listen to interesting people.
[00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.388]  People that we can get something from, get something out of.
[00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:12.132]  And of course, Senator Lindsey Graham is saying, how can I find out if you got my conversation?
[00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:13.413]  Well, we can't tell you, Senator.
[00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.575]  If we told you, we'd have to destroy your privacy.
[00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:20.557]  That's the circular logic that they use.
[00:11:20.977 --> 00:11:34.866]  A Navy prosecutor has said that unauthorized, unidentified people unintentionally overheard detainees consulting with their attorneys at a special irregular meeting site to stir the latest controversy over attorney-client privacy at the wartime prison.
[00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:41.570]  Any characterization, however, said Commander Douglas Short, any characterization regarding an intrusion into the attorney-client
[00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.931]  Relationship is misleading.
[00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:45.272]  He's the lead prosecutor.
[00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:49.014]  But look at this June 14th letter by the Chief Defense Counsel.
[00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:53.237]  This is Marine Brigadier General John Baker.
[00:11:53.777 --> 00:12:08.866]  In it, Brigadier General Baker says, there is a loss of confidence in the integrity of all potential client-attorney meeting locations after learning that some meetings were the victim of intrusive monitoring.
[00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:10.287]  See, that's the key, folks.
[00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:12.869]  We have to have a rule of law.
[00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.771]  We have to have a system of rules.
[00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:20.857]  And it is far more important for the government to do that, to follow those procedures, than it is
[00:12:21.952 --> 00:12:22.192]  I think?
[00:12:52.312 --> 00:12:58.054]  But they retweeted it, and I got a snapshot of it before Colonel Morris Davis deleted this, and here's what he had to say.
[00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:00.615]  He said, drone strike was a bad hypo.
[00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:04.876]  Let's substitute a 7.62 round on Assange's forehead instead.
[00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:09.437]  Would Article 51 permit it, assuming no collateral damage?
[00:13:10.337 --> 00:13:11.638]  Okay, that's now deleted.
[00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:15.099]  That's the guy that used to be the Guantanamo chief.
[00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:17.447]  This is the problem, folks.
[00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:20.529]  When they ignore the law, they can do anything.
[00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:22.689]  Like Obama's NDAA.
[00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:24.230]  Indefinite detention without trial.
[00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.691]  Rendition to a foreign location.
[00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:28.671]  Torture at Guantanamo.
[00:13:29.272 --> 00:13:31.252]  Violating attorney-client privileges.
[00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.833]  Taking away trial by jury.
[00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:35.094]  Now we're starting to sound like the Declaration of Independence.
[00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:37.194]  They had seen all of this before.
[00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:38.835]  This was nothing new.
[00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:43.951]  The people who created this country, that founded this country, knew history.
[00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:45.853]  They knew about star chambers.
[00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.394]  They knew how dangerous it was.
[00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:51.738]  That's why they put in the safeguards that we no longer care about.
[00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:54.420]  Americans don't care about liberty.
[00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:58.204]  They simply want to be comfortable and safe.
[00:13:58.384 --> 00:14:00.586]  Well, you're not going to be safe if you're a slave.
[00:14:01.387 --> 00:14:03.729]  And to the extent that you give up your liberty, you become a slave.
[00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:05.411]  Let's take a look now at the courts.
[00:14:05.967 --> 00:14:09.209]  The people that NPR tells us in their opinion poll are so trusted.
[00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:16.935]  We have Justice Kennedy now telling the October 2018 clerkship applicants that he's considering retirement.
[00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.081]  Right before the 2018 midterms.
[00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:38.814]  Now this is something that came up on Election Law blog, it was on the Drudge Report, and the interesting thing that they noticed when they were looking at this, this is a report from again NPR, Nina Totenberg, she did a story that was essentially on Justice Gorsuch voting 100% with Justice Thomas, and that's really good news folks.
[00:14:39.474 --> 00:14:45.457]  Clarence Thomas is probably the, without a doubt, he's been the best justice that we've got.
[00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:51.680]  He was somebody, when he was coming up for confirmation hearings, and they did all kinds of things to try to take him down.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:58.804]  I remember it was Joe Biden, and this was in the days before he had his hair transplants, his plastic surgery, his facelifts, and his Botox.
[00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:08.509]  Joe Biden was coming after Clarence Thomas, and he was furious that Clarence Thomas had written articles supporting the idea of natural rights.
[00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.110]  That's the Declaration of Independence, folks.
[00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:18.434]  Joe Biden despised Clarence Thomas, did everything he could to take him down, because he supported natural rights.
[00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:22.336]  The idea that our liberties are given to us by God.
[00:15:22.897 --> 00:15:23.977]  They don't come from government.
[00:15:24.297 --> 00:15:26.879]  We create government to protect those liberties.
[00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:33.743]  And when the government becomes destructive of those liberties, it is our right to abolish or alter that government.
[00:15:34.443 --> 00:15:35.444]  He had a problem with that.
[00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:43.752]  Joe Biden despises, as does Barack Obama, he despises the principles on which this country was organized.
[00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:49.256]  But the good thing is, is that so far we've seen Justice Gorsuch voting along with Clarence Thomas.
[00:15:49.276 --> 00:16:00.025]  They point out, with every passing day, it's become more clear that President Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is probably even more conservative than the justice he replaced, Antonin Scalia.
[00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:00.766]  Well that's great.
[00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:04.008]  You know, Antonin Scalia was a good justice.
[00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:05.830]  He was put in by Ronald Reagan.
[00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:16.458]  Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan also put in Sandra Day O'Connor, who was awful, absolutely awful in terms of individual liberty, and also put in Justice Kennedy.
[00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.380]  Justice Kennedy has been the swing justice.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.841]  He's been very unpredictable.
[00:16:19.901 --> 00:16:20.141]  Why?
[00:16:20.962 --> 00:16:26.305]  Because Justice Kennedy rejects the founding principles of this country, just as Joe Biden does.
[00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:27.865]  He rejects the Constitution.
[00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:30.427]  He constantly refers to foreign law.
[00:16:30.807 --> 00:16:33.268]  That's why he is absolutely unpredictable.
[00:16:34.228 --> 00:16:41.292]  And it highlights, I think, an issue that many of us always hope for the best when we look for a Supreme Court Justice picks.
[00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:47.814]  And certainly if we had had Hillary Clinton, she would have picked very liberal status judges.
[00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.835]  They always pick status judges.
[00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:56.036]  But when it comes to conservatives, it's been a real mixed bag, just as we can see with Ronald Reagan's three picks.
[00:16:56.056 --> 00:17:02.398]  So we hope that if he steps down, that we'll get a conservative judge as Gorsuch appears to be.
[00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.739]  Now, why do we think that he may be retiring?
[00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:10.942]  She said also in this report, it is unlikely that Kennedy will remain on the court for the full four years of the Trump presidency.
[00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:19.007]  While he long ago hired his law clerks for the coming term, he has not done so for the following term that will begin in October 2018.
[00:17:19.527 --> 00:17:25.871]  And he has let applicants for those positions know that he is considering retirement.
[00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:27.787]  Well, that would be very good.
[00:17:28.007 --> 00:17:32.232]  We would love to see him replaced and we hope that we get a wise replacement.
[00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:36.037]  As I said, so far it looks like Gorsuch is a good guy.
[00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.180]  Now let's talk about the idea of secession.
[00:17:39.963 --> 00:17:42.084]  Because Fourth of July was all about secession.
[00:17:42.684 --> 00:18:03.496]  It was about saying that, again, as I just said, if we create a government to protect our rights that we have, that are natural rights, that come from God, they're not granted by government, and when that government becomes destructive of that, or I would say in the case of contemporary America, the disunited America, as Drudge put on his headlines,
[00:18:04.096 --> 00:18:11.498]  We have a big split, and that is characterized no better than if we look at Texas versus California.
[00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:19.940]  There's an article that came out on The Guardian today, Your Place or Mine, Texas liberals and California conservatives want to swap states.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.260]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:33.323]  We're going to talk about the fact that the Texas Boys State, which is an organization that was created by the American Legion back in the 1930s, voted for the first time in history
[00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:34.463]  To secede.
[00:18:35.163 --> 00:18:38.845]  Both houses of the Texas boy state voted to secede.
[00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:41.885]  So we have this issue coming back and forth.
[00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:46.787]  It doesn't have to be violent, but we definitely have a disunited states.
[00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:52.769]  Today with us, we'll be right back and we'll talk about secession and we'll talk about Obamacare.
[00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.290]  One of the worst abuses we've seen since King George.
[00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.950]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:14.658]  This weekend in Austin, there was an impeach Trump rally.
[00:23:14.678 --> 00:23:20.743]  We had Owen Schroeder cover that for Infowars.com and we're going to be having highlights of that coming up later in the program.
[00:23:21.263 --> 00:23:27.088]  Again, it illustrates the disunited states as Matt Drudge had at the top of his report.
[00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:31.231]  But I want to pick up with this article I was talking about at the end of the last segment from The Guardian.
[00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:37.555]  Your place or mine, Texas liberals and California conservatives swap states.
[00:23:38.933 --> 00:23:41.695]  They kind of focus on Paul Chabot.
[00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:44.636]  He's a native Californian who stood for Congress last year as a Republican.
[00:23:45.176 --> 00:23:47.918]  He decided when he lost near L.A.
[00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:50.679]  that the only option was to move to Texas.
[00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:56.562]  In other words, he's kind of on the same line as Davy Crockett where he says, gone to Texas.
[00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:59.223]  He writes that on the wall in Tennessee and he heads out to Texas.
[00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:01.764]  He said, California has become a lost cause.
[00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:04.586]  I was born and raised there when it was a Republican state.
[00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:06.126]  Ronald Reagan was from there.
[00:24:06.506 --> 00:24:07.367]  Nixon was from there.
[00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:10.067]  We had great schools back in the 70s and 80s.
[00:24:10.107 --> 00:24:12.248]  We had low crime, great paying jobs.
[00:24:12.308 --> 00:24:13.968]  Now it's a 180.
[00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:16.369]  A complete opposite of all those things.
[00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:28.632]  He says a new law, they point out this new law that was passed in Texas that's been interpreted as anti-LGBTQ prompted California to ban state-funded trips to Texas.
[00:24:29.273 --> 00:24:34.274]  They've got to travel the ban on people leaving California and going to America.
[00:24:34.574 --> 00:24:35.615]  Okay, that's really what this is.
[00:24:35.715 --> 00:24:38.218]  It's kind of the reverse of Trump's travel ban.
[00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:41.502]  You can't leave California and come to the real America.
[00:24:41.783 --> 00:24:43.945]  His strategy has been just the opposite, he said.
[00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:46.428]  In May, he launched Conservative Move.
[00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:47.309]  Their slogan?
[00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.732]  Helping families move right.
[00:24:50.453 --> 00:24:58.780]  A company to help fellow sufferers in California flee their liberal hellscapes and find asylum in the warm red glow of suburban North Texas.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.623]  A 43-year-old said the response has been fast and furious.
[00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:07.046]  About a thousand expressions of interest, three-quarters of them from California.
[00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:11.529]  And they pointed out here that there's been a half a million people older than 25, 502,978
[00:25:15.312 --> 00:25:20.475]  Over 25 that have moved from California to Texas between 2005 and 2015.
[00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:23.176]  About 290,000 have gone the other way.
[00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:27.818]  Texas was a top destination for Californians and vice versa.
[00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:31.600]  So it kind of sets up an interesting juxtaposition here.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.322]  And of course the people in California want to be ruled by Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:36.382 --> 00:25:37.003]  We do not.
[00:25:37.823 --> 00:25:39.424]  And they don't want to be ruled by Trump.
[00:25:40.084 --> 00:25:43.006]  We see people in California coming up with CalExit.
[00:25:43.826 --> 00:25:51.069]  And we see in Texas, for the first time, the Texas Boys State, which is an organization that was created back in the 1930s.
[00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:53.730]  It was an event done by the American Legion.
[00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.872]  It's essentially young men who come together and they have a legislative practice.
[00:25:59.912 --> 00:26:05.374]  Now what they did for the very first time this time was to vote to secede from the Union.
[00:26:06.377 --> 00:26:17.622]  Now the way the Washington Post reports this, they say the Texas Secession Movement, in which separatists advocate, sometimes violently, that the Lone Star State become an independent country.
[00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.603]  They always want to put that violence in there.
[00:26:19.623 --> 00:26:25.026]  They never talk about violence when it comes to the left calling for secession.
[00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:26.727]  It's only when they talk about the right.
[00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:29.008]  And of course, secession doesn't have to be violent.
[00:26:29.741 --> 00:26:33.162]  We have seen Scandinavian countries go their own way without violence.
[00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:41.284]  We've seen Norway, Sweden, Denmark, others have been together in one political institution and then decided to go their separate ways.
[00:26:41.845 --> 00:26:42.385]  No wars.
[00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:43.185]  No violence.
[00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:44.065]  It's not necessary.
[00:26:44.705 --> 00:26:47.026]  Also, same thing happened with Czechoslovakia.
[00:26:47.046 --> 00:26:49.387]  They split in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
[00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:53.249]  It doesn't have to be violent, but of course it has been in the past.
[00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:56.692]  That's what people remember if they remember anything about the Civil War.
[00:26:56.712 --> 00:27:00.894]  If they think they know anything about the Civil War, that's what they think they know, is that secession is always violent.
[00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:09.200]  But it was reported by the New American, this is their headline, Texas Boys State Passes Secession Bill with Cheering and Celebration.
[00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.442]  And this happened June the 15th.
[00:27:11.942 --> 00:27:19.628]  Secession Bill won overwhelming support from the mock legislature in Texas Boys State, the American Legion's summer program where youth leaders create and run their own government
[00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:35.852]  As the county messenger reported on Saturday, the vote that was held June 15 marked the first time in the 80 years since the program's inception in Texas that both chambers of the Texas Boys State Legislature voted in favor of seceding from the union.
[00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:40.607]  And as I pointed out, how ignorant are we in terms of history?
[00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:43.729]  We have a story from Kit Daniels today that was picked up on the Drudge Report.
[00:27:44.189 --> 00:27:48.573]  History Channel tweets George Washington's fighting at Gettysburg.
[00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:55.898]  They were correct in getting the date of the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg was July the 3rd, 1863, but then of course they show
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.921]  George Washington as the leader.
[00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:11.629]  That is the insanity, the ignorance about our founding as well as, I would say, the disillusion of our government that happened with the Civil War.
[00:28:11.649 --> 00:28:15.271]  We no longer have the republic that was given to us by the founders.
[00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:16.672]  That only lasted about 80 years.
[00:28:16.692 --> 00:28:20.635]  What we have now bears no resemblance to what you will see in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:30.344]  Now some people in Nevada are not going to be lighting fireworks, they're going to be lighting Roman candles and sparklers are going to be lighting up with weed.
[00:28:30.544 --> 00:28:33.707]  That's because Nevada has legalized marijuana.
[00:28:33.727 --> 00:28:42.656]  This was done back in the election that we had when we didn't pay too much attention to it because we were all looking at the Trump versus Hillary election.
[00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:45.419]  But at the time we had four states
[00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:47.700]  Vote to legalize marijuana.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.563]  That would be California, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts.
[00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.446]  Only Nevada has implemented that so far.
[00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:59.330]  Also, three more states joined medical marijuana legalization.
[00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.052]  That would be North Dakota, Arkansas, and Florida.
[00:29:03.213 --> 00:29:04.574]  That was during this last election.
[00:29:05.795 --> 00:29:12.260]  The problem is, when you look at the Nevada law, there is a big entrapment involved here.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.702]  They're expecting two-thirds of the people
[00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:19.765]  Who are going to buy pot to be pot tourists in Nevada.
[00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:23.747]  But people can only use the drug in private homes.
[00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:28.928]  Setting up a legal entrapment for the tourists who come in and buy the pot.
[00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:34.470]  And of course, I'm sure they're going to be trying to entrap them as they leave the state in multiple ways.
[00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.692]  They're going to have the TSA as well as highway patrols at the border trying to entrap people.
[00:29:40.032 --> 00:29:42.893]  People can only use the drug in a private home
[00:29:43.453 --> 00:29:49.819]  As it remains illegal to consume it in public, including the Las Vegas Strip, hotels and casino floors.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.341]  And what are they going to do?
[00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:53.143]  They're going to fine violators $600.
[00:29:53.603 --> 00:29:59.349]  So you need to understand, again, this is an attack on the rule of law.
[00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:03.673]  Just as we saw earlier, the 3 million people who had their phones tapped.
[00:30:03.713 --> 00:30:03.953]  Why?
[00:30:04.474 --> 00:30:05.494]  Because of the war on drugs.
[00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:11.841]  We have people who have their property confiscated without conviction, without even a trial.
[00:30:12.441 --> 00:30:14.383]  They call it civil asset forfeiture.
[00:30:14.483 --> 00:30:16.445]  It is nothing but theft.
[00:30:17.126 --> 00:30:22.151]  That theft is one of the major sources of revenue for our law enforcement now.
[00:30:22.471 --> 00:30:24.113]  What would the founders do?
[00:30:24.813 --> 00:30:25.854]  Well, we know what they would do.
[00:30:26.355 --> 00:30:30.198]  They would shut that down no matter what they had to do, and we have the American public
[00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:33.772]  That is basically ignorant of this for the most part.
[00:30:34.393 --> 00:30:35.254]  Nobody reports on it.
[00:30:35.674 --> 00:30:38.798]  When Megyn Kelly was here, I mentioned that to her and it was a blank stare.
[00:30:39.018 --> 00:30:39.959]  Civil Asset Forfeiture?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.460]  What is that?
[00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:42.122]  Not even on their radar.
[00:30:42.202 --> 00:30:44.585]  Mainstream media will not cover anything like this.
[00:30:45.066 --> 00:30:47.468]  I do not want to see... I don't use marijuana.
[00:30:48.129 --> 00:30:49.329]  It is not something I care about.
[00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:51.710]  If I had a health condition I would want to be able to use that.
[00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:58.312]  But I don't want to rob people and I don't want to throw them in cages and have the government send me the bill.
[00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:02.874]  Because the worst thing that is happening is we're losing the rule of law here.
[00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:08.676]  And I think a good example of this, when we take this to the next level, is Obamacare.
[00:31:08.936 --> 00:31:19.099]  A government that can tell you what you cannot put in your body can also mandate things like vaccines, mandate that you put those drugs into your body.
[00:31:19.139 --> 00:31:20.860]  They can also, if they give you health care,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.682]  They can also take it away.
[00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:41.442]  I think one of the best examples of this is this poor young infant, Charlie Gard, in the UK, suffering under the status system of government that, and listen to this headline from the Washington Post, this terminally ill infant will be allowed to die.
[00:31:42.478 --> 00:31:47.900]  No, he is being taken off of life support by the single-payer system that doesn't want to keep him on there.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:55.242]  And he is being prevented, his parents are, from coming to America and trying an experimental treatment.
[00:31:55.862 --> 00:31:56.902]  They won't let him do that.
[00:31:56.942 --> 00:32:00.103]  They won't even, as they say that they're going to take him off of life support,
[00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:10.992]  They're even telling his parents that they're not going to have the opportunity to decide whether he can go to a hospice or, and the parents' wishes, to go home to die.
[00:32:11.032 --> 00:32:16.677]  They say, no, he will die in the hospital on the day that we decide.
[00:32:17.358 --> 00:32:18.579]  This is the British court system.
[00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:22.280]  This is the European Union court system that has put this in.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.841]  This, folks, is what death panels look like.
[00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:26.282]  We told you it would happen.
[00:32:26.582 --> 00:32:27.742]  You can see it happening here.
[00:32:28.342 --> 00:32:31.043]  And this is a horrendous example of this.
[00:32:31.103 --> 00:32:36.986]  And we have Donald Trump tweeting out today saying, if there's any way that I can help, I will be glad to.
[00:32:37.566 --> 00:32:42.928]  Well, we can start by making sure this type of atrocity never comes to the United States.
[00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:44.668]  Let's repeal Obamacare.
[00:32:44.968 --> 00:32:46.989]  Donald Trump has started us down that path.
[00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:53.151]  We have now had other White House advisers come out with it and senators saying it's too complicated to do repeal and replace.
[00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.432]  Let's just end this tyranny right now.
[00:32:55.512 --> 00:32:55.872]  Stay with us.
[00:32:55.892 --> 00:33:01.674]  We'll be right back with Owen Shorter's report about the disillusion here in Austin.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:04.593]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.153]  It's like lightning in a bottle!

[00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:23.037]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.112]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.847]  We fight the Globals!
[00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:54.728]  We fight the New World Order!
[00:36:55.008 --> 00:37:01.310]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:09.874]  I know a little bit about the CIA because as a marine pilot I was recruited by them to fly trucks.
[00:37:15.814 --> 00:37:22.917]  I'm Millie Weaver and we are going to be speaking with Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad.
[00:37:23.197 --> 00:37:33.081]  Now, I had the opportunity to sit down and do an interview with Robert Kiyosaki at the Red Pill Expo in Montana, and Robert said something that stunned many people.
[00:37:33.281 --> 00:37:36.302]  Well, he said that he had actually
[00:37:36.822 --> 00:37:41.567]  You've been offered to be recruited by the CIA to run drugs.
[00:37:41.627 --> 00:37:45.811]  Now, everybody is wondering what exactly happened, Robert.
[00:37:45.851 --> 00:37:47.312]  Can you explain that to us?
[00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:50.615]  Yeah, thanks, Mellie, for giving me a chance to clear that up.
[00:37:51.676 --> 00:37:54.819]  First of all, in 1973, I was a Marine lieutenant.
[00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:00.184]  I was a pilot flying helicopter gunships in Vietnam and I was about to rotate home.
[00:38:01.127 --> 00:38:06.712]  And an organization called Air America approached me and wanted to know if I would fly for them.
[00:38:07.312 --> 00:38:08.613]  And the offer was pretty good.
[00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:15.719]  I think, I believe, that was a long time ago, but it was $85,000 a year, which was a lot of money back then for a 25-year-old kid.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.622]  And I didn't know what Air America was.
[00:38:19.242 --> 00:38:26.609]  And then I just got the nod, nod, wink, wink that you could make a lot more money if you ran special packages.
[00:38:27.665 --> 00:38:33.608]  And I didn't know what they were talking about and my friends were, you know, just hitting me saying, you idiot, don't you know what they're talking about?
[00:38:33.648 --> 00:38:34.448]  And I said, no, I don't.
[00:38:35.468 --> 00:38:43.972]  And later on, I discovered it was to run intoxicants out of Laos and the Golden Triangle out there.
[00:38:45.012 --> 00:38:46.153]  And I don't do drugs.
[00:38:46.213 --> 00:38:52.896]  I mean, I've tried marijuana and I've tried cocaine, but I don't do drugs and I don't care how much money I make.
[00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:54.983]  I won't run drugs.
[00:38:55.063 --> 00:38:56.744]  I'm glad I didn't take up the offer.
[00:38:57.285 --> 00:39:01.168]  And Air America denies that ever happened.
[00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:05.051]  But as if you trust our government, of course you believe them.
[00:39:05.812 --> 00:39:15.420]  But as you know, back in 1985, the Iran Contra blew up and it was the arms and drugs to finance covert operations in Iran and Nicaragua.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.762]  So that's my story.
[00:39:17.862 --> 00:39:20.644]  I never ran drugs, and I'm glad I didn't.
[00:39:21.264 --> 00:39:22.906]  And I went on to become an entrepreneur.
[00:39:23.717 --> 00:39:25.184]  When I returned from Vietnam in 1973.
[00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:33.711]  Well you know it's very noble of you to have turned that down and the scary part is that a lot of people wouldn't.
[00:39:33.831 --> 00:39:50.581]  A lot of people would take the money and they would go do the drug trafficking or running drugs for the CIA but it just speaks to the fact that there is so much corruption that's going on inside our government especially inside the intelligence agencies with little oversight.
[00:39:50.842 --> 00:39:54.324]  Now I notice that that's what you were kind of getting at but have you ever
[00:39:54.804 --> 00:39:58.647]  Have you ever heard of or experienced anything inside with the corruption in the government?
[00:40:00.389 --> 00:40:05.434]  Well, not really, but if you watch the news, which you guys do a great job covering, there was Iran-Contra 1985.
[00:40:05.534 --> 00:40:06.635]  It was fast and furious.
[00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:12.640]  They killed our own guys.
[00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:15.384]  They sent guns to Mexico to kill our own people.
[00:40:15.404 --> 00:40:16.105]  I mean, why did that?
[00:40:16.185 --> 00:40:17.446]  I don't understand that.
[00:40:18.107 --> 00:40:26.677]  And then you have the $150 billion we, Obama sent to Iran, and Iran is one of the biggest exporter of terrorism.
[00:40:26.998 --> 00:40:28.359]  But nobody asked this question.
[00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:31.694]  Where did that $150 billion come from?
[00:40:32.515 --> 00:40:36.797]  And I interviewed the banker who gave Obama the money.
[00:40:37.458 --> 00:40:38.558]  It came out of Switzerland.
[00:40:39.158 --> 00:40:46.322]  So the question is, there's so many things that you and I do not know about, and it's really disappointing.
[00:40:46.422 --> 00:40:49.584]  You know, I went to war for the U.S.
[00:40:49.624 --> 00:40:55.247]  Marine Corps thinking we were the red, white, and blue, but then I don't even trust my own government at times.
[00:40:55.888 --> 00:40:58.149]  And you saw what happened at the Red Pill in Montana.
[00:40:59.124 --> 00:41:03.800]  I mean, the press showed up and they called us a bunch of white supremacists.
[00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:05.064]  I'm not even white!
[00:41:08.078 --> 00:41:10.179]  That was so ridiculous, I couldn't believe that.
[00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:11.720]  I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.720]  Are you serious?
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.761]  Do they not see?
[00:41:14.001 --> 00:41:26.566]  I mean, if they took the time to actually come in and see the wide variety of people from different walks of life, people of different ethnicities, different backgrounds, people from different countries, they would know that that's just complete lies.
[00:41:26.606 --> 00:41:32.929]  But, you know, we've seen stuff coming out now in the mainstream media, even the controversies with CNN and James O'Keefe interviews.
[00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:36.311]  So it's really no surprise when we're seeing those types of things.
[00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:38.633]  But you know, Robert, it's pretty amazing.
[00:41:38.773 --> 00:41:49.800]  Nobody would actually think that an author, a well-known author such as yourself, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, that you would have actually had these stories and these experiences.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:56.925]  Well, I ran into the CIA twice and any adult knows that CIA stands for
[00:41:57.659 --> 00:42:00.021]  Capitalism's invisible army.
[00:42:00.781 --> 00:42:04.945]  Or there was a song that went, dirty deeds done dirt cheap.
[00:42:05.905 --> 00:42:07.526]  And that's how we get things done.
[00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:11.710]  I'm not saying it's right or wrong because I don't want to get into that stupid discussion.
[00:42:12.931 --> 00:42:16.934]  But when people naively, you know, the red pill was about
[00:42:18.027 --> 00:42:18.727]  Seeing the truth.
[00:42:19.248 --> 00:42:20.088]  That's all it was.
[00:42:20.108 --> 00:42:23.230]  And there were 600 very educated people there.
[00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.650]  Of course, most were white.
[00:42:25.171 --> 00:42:27.672]  But they really were disturbed and upset.
[00:42:27.732 --> 00:42:30.453]  You know, stories of people are shot by our own government.
[00:42:31.273 --> 00:42:33.094]  So what the heck is going on?
[00:42:33.194 --> 00:42:34.315]  That is the question.
[00:42:34.355 --> 00:42:38.777]  And that's why I commend you guys for just kind of keeping them honest.
[00:42:39.217 --> 00:42:42.039]  But when they called me a white supremacist and an anarchist,
[00:42:43.038 --> 00:42:45.299]  And I'm going, what the heck's wrong with you guys?
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:51.643]  Don't you know that we're just concerned citizens and we're not the deplorables that Hillary thinks we are?
[00:42:52.164 --> 00:42:55.386]  And I serve my country and she serves her country in different ways.
[00:42:55.966 --> 00:42:56.707]  So did Obama.
[00:42:58.648 --> 00:43:06.293]  Well, so have you had any other run-ins with the CIA or any intelligence agencies other than the event that you just told us about?
[00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:14.667]  No, when I was 19 years old, I first ran into the CIA in Thailand, you know, and I didn't know who they were.
[00:43:14.747 --> 00:43:16.629]  They were just guys who were about 30 years old.
[00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.031]  And I was a 19 year old kid.
[00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:22.095]  I was a midshipman from the Academy, really naive.
[00:43:22.515 --> 00:43:23.216]  And then my
[00:43:24.275 --> 00:43:29.519]  This older gentleman who was on the ship with me said, you know, idiot, don't you know the CIA when you see them?
[00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:31.721]  And I went, no, I don't even know what they are.
[00:43:31.741 --> 00:43:34.563]  So again, this capitalism's invisible army.
[00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:39.267]  And I said, what are the, what's the CIA doing in Thailand in 66?
[00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:40.948]  He says, they're starting a war.
[00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:44.831]  And being such a dummy, I said, well, how do you start a war?
[00:43:45.472 --> 00:43:47.233]  And he says, what do you think our ship's carrying?
[00:43:48.314 --> 00:43:49.755]  And our ship was carrying.
[00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.774]  500, 750 and 1000 pound bombs to be stored in Thailand for the start of the war.
[00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:57.835]  And that was kind of my start.
[00:43:57.875 --> 00:43:59.637]  And I said, I want nothing to do with this.
[00:44:00.677 --> 00:44:02.038]  I kind of stayed clear.
[00:44:02.118 --> 00:44:12.786]  I got out of the Marine Corps and had other challenges, but I don't do drugs and I don't want to take on the US government.
[00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:15.572]  Yes, that's very understandable.
[00:44:15.932 --> 00:44:25.056]  Well, you know, you keep saying that it's capitalism's invisible army, but you were talking about how you are pro-capitalism, isn't that correct?
[00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:28.277]  Legal pro-capitalism.
[00:44:28.617 --> 00:44:29.058]  Legal.
[00:44:29.078 --> 00:44:40.703]  You know, like, as you and I were talking at the Red Pill Expo, I mean, they attacked Trump for saying covfefe or something on his tweet, and I don't agree with what he says, you know, or tweets.
[00:44:41.727 --> 00:44:46.390]  But the guy goes to Europe and tells NATO to pay up!
[00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:47.531]  Pay our bills!
[00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:51.353]  And he goes to talk to Saudi Arabia and says, take on Qatar.
[00:44:52.034 --> 00:44:53.535]  I mean, the guy is doing work.
[00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:58.918]  Unfortunately, when he tweets, he shoots himself in his own foot, is my opinion.
[00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:00.419]  But I love the guy.
[00:45:00.439 --> 00:45:01.320]  I support him.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.902]  And I wish he wouldn't tweet stupid things.
[00:45:05.963 --> 00:45:08.665]  Well, how did you first get to know President Trump?
[00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.166]  I'm sure everybody's dying to know.
[00:45:11.872 --> 00:45:23.819]  Well, before the real estate crash around 2004, 2005, he and I used to speak at these mega events, like we did at the Javits Center in New York and the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
[00:45:24.299 --> 00:45:29.002]  And he and I would travel as far as Australia and all this to speak to people about financial education.
[00:45:29.462 --> 00:45:33.685]  So I know Donald Trump as a financial educator, and that's how I know him.
[00:45:33.705 --> 00:45:40.729]  So we joined forces to write two books because I always ask the question, what does school teach you about money?
[00:45:42.011 --> 00:45:43.031]  And the answer is nothing.
[00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:44.792]  Is that a mistake?
[00:45:45.092 --> 00:45:45.852]  I don't think so.
[00:45:46.712 --> 00:45:48.992]  And so that's why he and I became very good friends.
[00:45:49.072 --> 00:45:51.673]  His sons and I are close, much better friends.
[00:45:51.953 --> 00:45:52.953]  They're great young men.
[00:45:52.973 --> 00:45:58.474]  I have tremendous respect for the guy, except when he tweets stupid things.
[00:45:59.435 --> 00:46:02.975]  Because it makes it harder for him to get his job done.
[00:46:02.995 --> 00:46:04.155]  You know, that's my point of view.
[00:46:04.716 --> 00:46:05.496]  And I support him.
[00:46:05.676 --> 00:46:06.296]  I love him dearly.
[00:46:07.176 --> 00:46:11.537]  Do you think that he has honest intentions in trying to do the best he can for America?
[00:46:12.982 --> 00:46:13.742]  I know that.
[00:46:14.503 --> 00:46:15.043]  I know that.
[00:46:15.343 --> 00:46:28.126]  He is really shaking up this elite, you know, the college elite, the guys that went to Harvard, Stanford, University of Chicago and all this, and they think they're better than everybody else.
[00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:35.187]  You know, most of them are just professional managers who think they're smarter than everybody else.
[00:46:36.088 --> 00:46:37.288]  And we all have to deal with them.
[00:46:38.305 --> 00:46:41.646]  Well, thank you so much for coming on and telling us your story, Robert.
[00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:43.007]  It takes a lot of courage.
[00:46:43.087 --> 00:46:43.607]  Thank you.
[00:46:43.947 --> 00:46:48.109]  And thank you for covering what you guys do and keep people honest.
[00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:49.089]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:49.189 --> 00:46:49.870]  We appreciate it.
[00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:50.750]  The country needs you.
[00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.851]  This is Millie Weaver signing off for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.409]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:49.469]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.809 --> 00:48:50.510]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.150]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:59.073]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.093 --> 00:48:59.953]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.973 --> 00:49:00.013]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:14.254]  God bless America, my home, sweet home.
[00:49:14.274 --> 00:49:15.495]  I won't take you any higher.
[00:49:15.656 --> 00:49:17.397]  Let's hear it for the United States of America.
[00:49:17.417 --> 00:49:18.038]  God bless you.
[00:49:18.759 --> 00:49:20.760]  And God bless President Donald Trump.
[00:49:21.721 --> 00:49:22.782]  God bless Donald Trump.
[00:49:23.443 --> 00:49:25.024]  Wait, what brings you here today, man?
[00:49:25.044 --> 00:49:26.866]  What brings you here today?
[00:49:37.239 --> 00:49:38.720]  Owen Shroyer here for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.921]  We're in front of the State Building.
[00:49:40.941 --> 00:49:43.963]  And there's an anti-Trump, I think it's the Impeach Trump march.
[00:49:44.363 --> 00:49:47.665]  They had some speeches up here on top of the Capitol Hill.
[00:49:48.326 --> 00:49:51.007]  And now they are marching downtown Austin.
[00:49:51.087 --> 00:49:52.128]  So we're going to follow them.
[00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:53.208]  Stay tuned for more.
[00:49:53.229 --> 00:49:54.629]  Woo!
[00:49:54.689 --> 00:49:57.171]  Let's get ready to rumble!
[00:49:57.231 --> 00:49:58.292]  But peacefully.
[00:49:58.932 --> 00:50:00.833]  Oh, encouraging violence, but not really.
[00:50:00.913 --> 00:50:03.234]  Thank you everyone for coming out.
[00:50:03.314 --> 00:50:05.796]  Hey, we want you to be violent, but we're peaceful people.
[00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:09.323]  We want to resist and persist and hate Donald Trump.
[00:50:09.343 --> 00:50:09.883]  Over, people, people.
[00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:12.045]  We really, really hate all of you Trump supporters.
[00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:12.645]  Over, people.
[00:50:12.725 --> 00:50:14.927]  Love Trump's hate, but we hate him.
[00:50:23.876 --> 00:50:31.364]  The Republicans haven't lost a special election because you got people out here wearing pussy hats.
[00:50:31.404 --> 00:50:32.485]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:32.545 --> 00:50:33.906]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:34.227 --> 00:50:35.228]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:35.328 --> 00:50:36.489]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:36.529 --> 00:50:37.550]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.831]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:39.752]  Donald Trump!
[00:50:40.013 --> 00:50:46.199]  For all you out here calling for Trump's impeachment, you're wasting your time!
[00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:49.959]  You are wasting your time and energy!
[00:50:49.979 --> 00:50:50.880]  Go get a workout!
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.561]  Go start a family!
[00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.901]  Go get a job!
[00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:56.362]  You are wasting your time!
[00:50:56.902 --> 00:51:02.645]  The Democrats have not won an election since Trump got elected!
[00:51:02.765 --> 00:51:04.746]  You wonder why?
[00:51:05.206 --> 00:51:07.627]  Everything you're hearing about Donald Trump is fake news.
[00:51:07.927 --> 00:51:09.628]  Just look at what's come out about CNN.
[00:51:09.648 --> 00:51:11.029]  It's all fake news.
[00:51:11.049 --> 00:51:15.951]  The Russia investigation is an upping burger to quote Dan Jones.
[00:51:16.994 --> 00:51:20.495]  You guys are still out here thinking that Trump- Look at this woman has a Russian sign!
[00:51:20.875 --> 00:51:26.836]  This woman made a sign this morning about Trump being colluded with Russia, even though she knows it's not true!
[00:51:27.156 --> 00:51:27.976]  What do you call that?
[00:51:28.256 --> 00:51:29.277]  That is insanity!
[00:51:29.637 --> 00:51:32.837]  If you follow that path, you're following the path of insanity!
[00:51:33.217 --> 00:51:36.858]  If you follow Representative Al Green, you're following a loser!
[00:51:38.118 --> 00:51:39.159]  Would want a border?
[00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:42.739]  I mean, I've never heard of such madness.
[00:51:43.279 --> 00:51:43.819]  A border?
[00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.580]  I don't even lock my doors at night!
[00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:48.370]  I don't even have doors, actually.
[00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.833]  I have a wide open hole in my house so anybody can just walk in.
[00:51:51.853 --> 00:51:53.634]  It's racist if you don't.
[00:51:55.136 --> 00:51:57.978]  If you have a door on your house, you're a racist.
[00:51:57.998 --> 00:52:03.142]  They're gonna create 100,000 refugees, and then they're gonna hate our country, so we're gonna bring them to America!
[00:52:04.426 --> 00:52:06.687]  That's the new left policy of the Democrats!
[00:52:07.067 --> 00:52:12.630]  Bomb every country in the world, create 100,000 refugees, and then let's bring them back to America!
[00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.732]  And then when they create acts of terror, let's act like there's nothing to it!
[00:52:16.992 --> 00:52:18.173]  It's just a lone wolf!
[00:52:19.593 --> 00:52:26.517]  Can you believe we have a president that would want to ban travel from countries that we have bombed for the last eight years?
[00:52:27.057 --> 00:52:31.159]  I think we should bomb every country, and then bring the refugees here to kill us!
[00:52:31.699 --> 00:52:32.500]  That's what I think!
[00:52:34.423 --> 00:52:40.987]  And I also think we need to have an open border, so if they want to just walk right across the border and kill us, they can do that too!
[00:52:41.007 --> 00:52:44.850]  I mean, after all, we hate ourselves, don't we?
[00:52:46.211 --> 00:52:48.792]  Can you guys believe we have a president that wants a border?
[00:52:50.513 --> 00:52:51.334]  That is absurd.
[00:52:52.054 --> 00:52:55.136]  I want a borderless country where criminals can come in here free of charge.
[00:52:55.897 --> 00:52:56.998]  I don't even want a country.
[00:52:57.658 --> 00:52:58.779]  Borders are fake news.
[00:52:59.964 --> 00:53:00.985]  America first.
[00:53:01.005 --> 00:53:02.406]  Give me a break.
[00:53:02.606 --> 00:53:06.950]  And making Texas a leader in the green energy revolution.
[00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.732]  Let's put a solar wall at the border.
[00:53:11.834 --> 00:53:13.595]  We want a solar wall at the border.
[00:53:14.876 --> 00:53:19.080]  I've got to be honest, I wasn't expecting this many choice supporters out here in Raleigh.
[00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:27.342]  I'm not interrupting anything.
[00:53:27.442 --> 00:53:29.163]  We had to get a permit for our amplification.
[00:53:29.183 --> 00:53:31.303]  You guys interrupt Trump rallies all the time!
[00:53:31.383 --> 00:53:32.944]  I have never interrupted a Trump rally.
[00:53:32.964 --> 00:53:34.104]  I don't know who you think you're talking to.
[00:53:34.124 --> 00:53:37.445]  Okay, so Trump rallies never get interrupted by people who don't like President Trump.
[00:53:37.605 --> 00:53:39.566]  I'm talking to you right now.
[00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:42.667]  Wait, what brings you here today, man?
[00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:44.027]  What brings you here today?
[00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:50.185]  You realize Trumpcare isn't even the law yet.
[00:53:50.686 --> 00:53:53.247]  Everything you're complaining about is because of Obamacare.
[00:53:53.727 --> 00:53:58.410]  And I say he's the strongest person in this nation, but I think we can all see for ourselves that he's actually an idiot.
[00:53:58.930 --> 00:53:59.150]  Really?
[00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:00.631]  Is that why he's president?
[00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:01.892]  And you're a nobody?
[00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:05.242]  Who are you anyway?
[00:54:05.322 --> 00:54:07.163]  Yeah, you're gonna lose.
[00:54:07.183 --> 00:54:07.723]  You're gonna lose.
[00:54:07.763 --> 00:54:09.124]  Quit wasting Democrat money.
[00:54:09.144 --> 00:54:12.266]  The Democrat Party is being sued right now for fraud.
[00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:15.187]  Bernie Sanders is sued for bank fraud.
[00:54:15.207 --> 00:54:17.529]  Why don't you support President Trump?
[00:54:23.152 --> 00:54:23.872]  Hey, he's okay.
[00:54:23.892 --> 00:54:25.433]  Hey, why won't you let him talk, man?
[00:54:25.853 --> 00:54:27.374]  The left always censors their own.
[00:54:27.574 --> 00:54:31.655]  See, this man probably is a smart individual who has a brain and can think on his own, honestly.
[00:54:31.675 --> 00:54:34.096]  This guy right here, he's... Hey, you're a good guy.
[00:54:34.336 --> 00:54:35.637]  You're willing to have a conversation.
[00:54:35.657 --> 00:54:39.658]  You see this nutbag is trying to censor you because she doesn't want your free speech.
[00:54:40.098 --> 00:54:44.140]  You're probably a lot smarter than she is, and she doesn't want you to talk.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.200]  Drain the swamp!
[00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:47.601]  Drain the swamp!
[00:54:48.802 --> 00:54:55.484]  How long has Trump been a politician, sir?
[00:54:56.184 --> 00:55:00.446]  What has Trump done that you don't like, sir?
[00:55:00.566 --> 00:55:01.366]  I'm still waiting.
[00:55:01.426 --> 00:55:06.727]  I've talked to 20 people and I'm yet to hear one protester tell me what they don't like about Trump.
[00:55:07.127 --> 00:55:10.288]  I have not heard one protester tell me what they don't like about Trump.
[00:55:10.308 --> 00:55:11.829]  You, sir, will you be the first?
[00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:13.050]  Hey, wait!
[00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.332]  You got a leftist over here censoring your free speech!
[00:55:15.532 --> 00:55:16.392]  Oh, go talk to him!
[00:55:16.453 --> 00:55:17.393]  He's smarter than you!
[00:55:17.553 --> 00:55:18.735]  He's gonna make you look bad!
[00:55:19.635 --> 00:55:20.996]  Hey, not everyone's as dumb as you are.
[00:55:21.077 --> 00:55:23.779]  He's for $1,000!
[00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:24.419]  Come here, sir!
[00:55:24.479 --> 00:55:25.280]  I'll give you $1,000!
[00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:27.642]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[00:55:27.982 --> 00:55:30.104]  I hope you have a really wonderful afternoon.
[00:55:30.505 --> 00:55:31.225]  I'm glad you're here!
[00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:33.607]  I'll give you $1,000 if you can tell me why Trump should be impeached.
[00:55:35.163 --> 00:55:35.403]  So?
[00:55:36.044 --> 00:55:36.645]  A thousand dollars.
[00:55:36.665 --> 00:55:37.626]  I'd like to see it first.
[00:55:38.246 --> 00:55:39.007]  Come on, show it to me.
[00:55:39.047 --> 00:55:39.768]  Show me the money.
[00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:41.830]  Show me the thousand dollars.
[00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.311]  Come on!
[00:55:42.831 --> 00:55:43.912]  Show me the impeachment terms.
[00:55:43.992 --> 00:55:44.913]  My, my.
[00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:47.676]  We're dictating terms now, are we?
[00:55:48.317 --> 00:55:48.938]  Have a nice day.
[00:55:50.074 --> 00:55:51.996]  Hey, you looked really good in that video.
[00:55:52.016 --> 00:55:52.336]  $1,000, sir.
[00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:52.336]  $1,000.
[00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:55.039]  Tell me why Trump should be impeached for $1,000.
[00:55:55.079 --> 00:55:56.160]  He's a weenie, I guess.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.582]  No, but I'm saying why should he be impeached?
[00:55:57.602 --> 00:55:58.042]  He's a weenie.
[00:55:58.142 --> 00:55:59.864]  But why should he be impeached?
[00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:01.005]  That's a court case.
[00:56:01.045 --> 00:56:01.946]  Why should he be impeached?
[00:56:01.966 --> 00:56:04.249]  $1,000 if you can tell me why he should be impeached.
[00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:14.219]  What now?
[00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:16.322]  The Russians got this microphone wired.
[00:56:16.342 --> 00:56:22.230]  The Russians are... So another person... So hey, hey, I want everybody recording this to take this into... Look at this.
[00:56:23.252 --> 00:56:25.355]  I just offered every one of those people $1,000!
[00:56:25.395 --> 00:56:29.060]  $1,000 to tell me why President Trump should be impeached!
[00:56:30.562 --> 00:56:37.967]  Hundreds of people, hundreds of people just walked by me and did not answer the question for $1,000.
[00:56:38.387 --> 00:56:40.068]  Why should President Trump be impeached?
[00:56:40.388 --> 00:56:43.170]  You're 0 for 200 because you have no reasons.
[00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:44.350]  We have one taker.
[00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:45.371]  Here we go.
[00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:47.172]  Why should President Trump be impeached?
[00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:52.115]  Because he has committed crime of treason against our country.
[00:56:52.195 --> 00:56:52.915]  What crime?
[00:56:52.955 --> 00:56:54.556]  He has obstructed justice.
[00:56:54.656 --> 00:56:56.938]  He has sold the soul of this country.
[00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:58.559]  What justice did he obstruct?
[00:56:59.235 --> 00:57:03.056]  He obstructed the justice by firing James Comey, who is investigating.
[00:57:03.096 --> 00:57:05.557]  You know that Democrats called for his firing before he got fired?
[00:57:06.017 --> 00:57:09.478]  He is obstructing justice.
[00:57:09.518 --> 00:57:12.858]  You know that even the news networks admitted that it's a nothing burger in fake news?
[00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:15.099]  It is not a nothing burger.
[00:57:15.159 --> 00:57:15.959]  It is not fake news.
[00:57:15.979 --> 00:57:17.760]  So why haven't we found anything for seven months?
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.540]  We have found stuff, but... What?
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.541]  It is still being investigated.
[00:57:21.561 --> 00:57:22.281]  What have we found?
[00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:28.724]  We have found that his minions have sold their souls to foreign countries like Russia and Turkey.
[00:57:28.744 --> 00:57:30.745]  You mean like John Podesta's stock deals?
[00:57:31.146 --> 00:57:36.048]  General Flynn, Flynn, Manafort, Carter Page.
[00:57:36.148 --> 00:57:37.609]  All those investigations have been dropped.
[00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:39.230]  They have not been dropped.
[00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:44.393]  You are deluding yourselves and I want my thousand dollars now.
[00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:45.874]  You didn't tell me why Trump should be impeached.
[00:57:46.034 --> 00:57:47.075]  I certainly did.
[00:57:47.495 --> 00:57:49.276]  Obstructing justice of a state case.
[00:57:50.436 --> 00:57:52.377]  Does anyone think she deserves a thousand dollars?
[00:57:53.957 --> 00:57:54.898]  So you have nothing.
[00:57:55.198 --> 00:57:55.938]  Hey, I'll give you credit.
[00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:56.398]  You tried.
[00:57:56.438 --> 00:57:57.039]  You tried.
[00:57:57.239 --> 00:57:57.819]  So there you go.
[00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:58.699]  Here's the news, folks.
[00:57:59.379 --> 00:58:15.665]  These people are out here protesting Donald Trump because they think he colluded with Russia, even though we have inside undercover video of the very news networks that tell you that Donald Trump colluded with Russia, that it's fake news and it doesn't exist.
[00:58:16.065 --> 00:58:19.548]  And all you can do is wave your hand and walk away.
[00:58:19.988 --> 00:58:24.152]  And if you guys could just learn the truth, you wouldn't be out here marching against Trump.
[00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:25.693]  Trump is not your enemy.
[00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:27.534]  In fact, this woman... You are!
[00:58:27.895 --> 00:58:28.535]  I'm not your enemy.
[00:58:28.555 --> 00:58:29.216]  What have I done to you?
[00:58:29.236 --> 00:58:32.759]  To be honest, ma'am, I look at you, and you're your own worst enemy.
[00:58:32.979 --> 00:58:37.442]  You've been your own worst enemy your entire life, and that's why you're out here blaming Trump for your misery.
[00:58:37.523 --> 00:58:39.244]  Keep canning peace, though.
[00:58:39.504 --> 00:58:41.406]  I'm sure that that will deliver you to glory.
[00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:43.936]  That's it for tonight's news.
