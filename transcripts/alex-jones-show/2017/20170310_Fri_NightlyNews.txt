[00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:19.477]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:21.318]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:22.278]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:31.662]  Today is Friday, March 10th, 2017, and here's a quick look at what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:40.094]  The pressure on Obama to answer the Vault 7 leaks and Trump's wiretapping claims is building, yet silence from the Obama bunker.
[00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:48.041]  Meanwhile, Malik Obama tweets out what he claims is Barack Obama's real birth certificate, showing Kenya as the birthplace.
[00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.143]  Is it real or fake news?
[00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:58.170]  Plus, Dr. Ed Group sits down with Millie Weaver to discuss the latest breaking products from the InfoWars Health line.
[00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.891]  And then,
[00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:07.045]  Despite all the positives coming from the Trump presidency, the Democrats and never-Trumpers cannot get on board the Trump train.
[00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:17.931]  Muslims, Putin, Kremlin, Korea, the bombs, and yeah, and Aleppo.
[00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:23.013]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:36.967]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:44.708]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:29.497]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:09.528]  Infowars DC Bureau Chief Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us now and it's good to have you with us.
[00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:17.574]  I want to talk about the Freedom of Information Act request to investigate the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:25.180]  It's time for them to put up or shut up to see if the Russians were involved in the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.341]  Can you tell us more about that?
[00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:31.033]  I think the FOIA request is coming from Judicial Watch.
[00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:33.596]  I've worked with Judicial Watch for a long time.
[00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:34.277]  Tom Fitton.
[00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:38.904]  It's a really credible and important group in Washington.
[00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:40.827]  They did a lot to break
[00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:50.200]  The issue on Hillary's server and now Judicial Watch has filed FOIA requests to get the documents from inside the government.
[00:03:51.001 --> 00:04:03.884]  Importantly, from the Department of Justice and from others in terms of all this supposed Russian involvement throwing the election for Donald Trump, which so far everyone has looked at it of any credibility.
[00:04:03.984 --> 00:04:09.686]  All the intelligence committees in Congress have said there's no evidence for.
[00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:10.955]  No, they've got nothing.
[00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:11.637]  They've got nothing.
[00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:21.474]  But do I also understand there's also separate FOIA requests to investigate whether or not General Michael Flynn, for example, whether he was talking to the Russians.
[00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:21.974]  Is that true?
[00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:32.931]  See, when Judicial Watch does this, they're going to want all the records they can find that pertain to anything of these Russian allegations interfering in the election.
[00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:39.133]  And I think what you're going to find is that this was a witch hunt that the Obama administration went on.
[00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.094]  I believe the original goal was to wiretap Trump.
[00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.299]  Thank you.
[00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.660]  They knew they would get some of the Trump people captured in that, and they pass that information on to the Clinton campaign.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.933]  Because we have documents, even even Robbie Mook, who is the campaign manager for Clinton this week on Fox and Friends, said that the campaign was getting information from wiretaps.
[00:05:20.513 --> 00:05:22.034]  No, is that illegal?
[00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:25.157]  Because I don't understand because Hillary would not be president yet.
[00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:31.361]  And I could see if they're spying on the Russians to see if they're going to launch a cyber attack or whatever.
[00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:34.164]  I could see as far as national security how that would go.
[00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:41.369]  But I don't see, is there any proof that they deliberately targeted Donald Trump or any of his staff?
[00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:48.955]  Or was this just a matter of spying on the Russians and then lo and behold, oh shock and surprise, Donald Trump's on the phone with the Russians.
[00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.676]  What is really going on?
[00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:53.297]  Well, I think it's all big wink wink.
[00:05:53.377 --> 00:06:02.281]  I mean, I think first of all, the Department of Justice under Loretta Lynch knew they couldn't target Trump, because then you're targeting... Oh, I get you, I get you.
[00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:02.741]  Okay.
[00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:18.289]  So they target the Russians, knowing they're going to get Trump, and they pass that information on to Hillary's campaign, which is politically utilizing information from supposedly a FISA search on national security, which would be completely illegal.
[00:06:19.205 --> 00:06:24.828]  And I think the whole thing was done by Obama, who's been surveilling everyone.
[00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:26.348]  That's right.
[00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.651]  James Rosen, the Fox reporter, journalist.
[00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:38.494]  Obama, I think, is going to turn out to have been more insane with electronic surveillance than even Richard Nixon.
[00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:42.896]  And Richard Nixon say, of course, he didn't have the capabilities Barack Obama has.
[00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:54.101]  And when we get finished with this investigation, I think it's going to backfire on the Democrats because I don't think there was any possibility the Russians ever colluded with Donald Trump to throw the election.
[00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:54.982]  It's nonsense.
[00:06:55.962 --> 00:07:01.145]  If Podesta's emails were detrimental, Podesta shouldn't have written what he wrote.
[00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.585]  What was detrimental was that the public finally got to see how corrupt the Democrats were.
[00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:10.209]  That's the real fault here that the Democrats are trying to cover up.
[00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.871]  Well, look, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:13.913]  What would we do without WikiLeaks, right?
[00:07:13.993 --> 00:07:19.057]  Although a lot of the surveillance, you know, the surveillance grid and the surveillance society
[00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:22.340]  We've been talking about this at InfoWars along with you yourself.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.462]  We've been talking about that for a very very long time.
[00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:27.104]  Now with this WikiLeaks release we're being vindicated.
[00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:44.540]  But I want to get back to the the Pfizer request because former National Director of Intelligence James Clapper was on Meet the Press and he said that if there was a Pfizer request he would have definitely seen it but it never came his way.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.661]  Let's check out that clip.
[00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:50.286]  The FBI, for instance, had a FISA court order of some sort for a surveillance.
[00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.588]  Would that be information you would know or not know?
[00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:52.888]  Yes.
[00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:54.450]  You would be told this?
[00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.150]  I would know that.
[00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.412]  If there was a FISA court order on something like this?
[00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.714]  Something like this, absolutely.
[00:07:59.755 --> 00:08:02.117]  And at this point you can't confirm or deny whether that exists?
[00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:03.498]  I can deny it.
[00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:06.341]  There is no FISA court order?
[00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:07.222]  Not to my knowledge.
[00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:08.543]  Of anything at Trump Tower?
[00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:09.404]  No.
[00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:16.203]  So there you go, the former Director of National Security, you know, James Clapper, just flat out denying it.
[00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.764]  Where did it come from if he didn't see it?
[00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:23.746]  Well, see, you've got to understand, listen to very precisely what Clapper said.
[00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:27.507]  And you've got to parse these guys in the Obama administration.
[00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:32.989]  He said he didn't know the FISA request on Trump or Trump Towers.
[00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.350]  That's not how they did it.
[00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.152]  They put the FISA request on the Russians and caught Trump.
[00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:46.000]  Now if he'd asked him, was there a Pfizer request on surveillance of the Russians, Clapper would have had to say yes.
[00:08:46.761 --> 00:09:00.496]  So he was not lying, but he was, you know, diverting the truth, let's say, by narrowly answering a question, you know, saying he didn't have sex with that woman because the particular act involved was not according to Bill Clinton's facts.
[00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:06.440]  Alright, so it was a setup and you know, I have to laugh at the mainstream media.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:13.404]  They're basically regurgitating the talking point that it was, this is unsubstantiated claims.
[00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:16.086]  You've probably heard that over and over again by Donald Trump.
[00:09:16.406 --> 00:09:18.108]  But do you think he's got a case here?
[00:09:18.248 --> 00:09:20.929]  And do you think, because you know, there's going to be more WikiLeaks coming out.
[00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:27.394]  This is just the beginning by the way, because Julian Assange announced that this Vault 7 information, for example,
[00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:29.676]  Was just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:31.637]  There's going to be more to follow.
[00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:34.139]  Any suspicion on what we could expect next?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.803]  Well, he said we if Assange said he's only released 1% of this vault set.
[00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:40.564]  That's amazing because that was a lot too.
[00:09:40.584 --> 00:09:41.185]  That was a big 1%.
[00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:43.126]  That's huge.
[00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.167]  That's 1%.
[00:09:44.547 --> 00:09:48.110]  He's already taken up the entire intelligence agencies.
[00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:51.073]  Look, there's obvious that it was that
[00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:56.075]  Trump was caught in the wiretaps because there were reports on this during the campaign.
[00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:58.936]  Hillary was out there saying it and so was Mook.
[00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:06.299]  They were all talking about Trump colluding with the Russians and they had to get that information from inside the Obama administration.
[00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:09.020]  It was reported in the New York Times and other papers.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.743]  The New York Times just has amnesia when they're trying to develop a meme or a narrative
[00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:27.110]  That Trump doesn't know what he's talking about because Trump is regurgitating what the New York Times reported during the campaign, namely that Hillary was told that he, Trump, was colluding with the Russians.
[00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.171]  And it wasn't the case.
[00:10:28.191 --> 00:10:28.791]  It wasn't true.
[00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:33.954]  Remember, it was Putin who was paying Hillary and Podesta.
[00:10:34.474 --> 00:10:35.675]  And we've documented that.
[00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.535]  I've documented that.
[00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:37.216]  That's right.
[00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:37.596]  We sure have.
[00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:46.238]  The Trump campaign put out a memorandum about it during the campaign, and that's the real collusion.
[00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:52.561]  It was the Democrats who were in bed with Russia, and if Hillary had won, Putin would have been set up to blackmail her.
[00:10:53.956 --> 00:11:03.204]  Well, I think we could learn a lot from how Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, how he was treated when he announced this press conference.
[00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:09.209]  And let me know if I got this straight, because he claimed as soon as he went out there that he was hacked.
[00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:12.031]  They tried everything they could to stop this from Periscope.
[00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.412]  I think Periscope got hacked.
[00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:15.914]  His Facebook page was hacked.
[00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:19.837]  They were unable to basically have this press conference go live.
[00:11:20.338 --> 00:11:21.719]  I mean, that says a lot.
[00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:22.880]  Who do you think was hacking
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.861]  WikiLeaks when they're trying to release all this information?
[00:11:26.321 --> 00:11:30.662]  Well, suspect number one is the CIA.
[00:11:30.702 --> 00:11:33.522]  They did interfere with the press conference.
[00:11:33.563 --> 00:11:35.083]  It was interrupted several times.
[00:11:35.943 --> 00:11:43.265]  Assange is very clever, though, in terms of his ability to use internet media, and he was able to fight back and keep the press conference going.
[00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:47.646]  And he probably expected this to happen, because it's not the first time he's had to deal with this kind of stuff.
[00:11:48.382 --> 00:11:48.683]  Sure.
[00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:50.967]  He anticipated it.
[00:11:50.987 --> 00:12:00.005]  What astrology has revealed so far is that not only has the CIA gone rogue and developed this trove of
[00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:09.028]  You know, malware that can be used to basically take control of your iPad and your television and your cell phone.
[00:12:09.388 --> 00:12:12.869]  But additionally, they were using these techniques against American citizens.
[00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:16.090]  That's really the astounding part to me.
[00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:24.672]  There were 22,000 IP addresses that traced back to the United States, and Assange said he was sure some of those were targets of the investigation.
[00:12:24.992 --> 00:12:27.653]  And targeted towards journalists and whistleblowers.
[00:12:28.053 --> 00:12:41.038]  And we've been called crazy for years here at InfoWars, and I'm sure you've heard the same thing when we tell people that, look, your cell phone is listening to you, your television could watch what you're doing, even your Xbox.
[00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:47.860]  And now it looks like through these releases from WikiLeaks, the CIA, like you said, is a rogue agency.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.542]  And I tell you what, their surveillance system is basically rivals even that of the NSA.
[00:12:54.929 --> 00:13:01.754]  Well, yes, it's also astounding that the CIA built internally a capability that rivaled the NSA's and no one knew about it.
[00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:06.017]  No congressional oversight and certainly the public had no idea.
[00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.678]  Most of the public.
[00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:08.696]  We're good to go.
[00:13:26.188 --> 00:13:35.111]  You know, Assange said it was a devastating breach on the part of the CIA of their own security.
[00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:42.414]  I mean, it's mind-boggling that the CIA was this stupid not to protect those malware techniques that they developed.
[00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:45.215]  They got out, they had been circulated by U.S.
[00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:50.296]  intelligence, Assange got a hold of them, and now Assange is blasting them to the world.
[00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:51.537]  It's just the beginning.
[00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:56.681]  Yeah, and they're saying that now all this information could potentially end up in the wrong hands.
[00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:00.744]  Well, I'd say it was in the wrong hands to begin with, in the hands of the CIA.
[00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:17.518]  And you know what folks, I just want to point out, and you can look for this on the internet, maybe you guys can find it, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, he is seen in pictures where he covers up his webcam on his computers and he covers up the microphone too.
[00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:18.920]  I wonder why he does that.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.910]  Hey, let's talk about, because we only have a couple minutes, and I want to talk about Good Night, Obama.
[00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.197]  This is a brand new book you have coming out, and we're going to show the trailer here in a couple minutes.
[00:14:29.658 --> 00:14:32.022]  Tell us about the book and where people can find it.
[00:14:32.694 --> 00:14:33.754]  Well, it's on InfoWars.
[00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:34.895]  You can get it at InfoWars.
[00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:35.355]  All right.
[00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:40.117]  In bookstores around the country and Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com.
[00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:41.737]  It's a parody book.
[00:14:41.777 --> 00:14:42.718]  It's a cartoon book.
[00:14:42.818 --> 00:14:45.939]  I wrote it to say, you know, like, good night, moon.
[00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.880]  Good night, Obama, for all the disastrous things he brought to us.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.301]  And if you show the trailer, you'll see the humor in it.
[00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:58.984]  It's, you know, good night, Obama, for the birth certificate, for open borders, and all the other crises you've created.
[00:15:00.603 --> 00:15:03.284]  I decided to have a good time with it.
[00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:04.125]  Obama's leaving.
[00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.125]  Might as well say goodbye in fashion.
[00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:07.326]  Absolutely.
[00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:08.586]  Yeah, good riddance, right?
[00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:12.148]  Well, Dr. Jerome Corsi, it is so good to have you on our side.
[00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.048]  Thanks for being here.
[00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:14.949]  We're going to play that clip right now.
[00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:22.132]  And folks, you can go to goodnightobama.com or go to InfoWarsStore and check out Goodnight Obama.
[00:15:22.532 --> 00:15:24.253]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, thanks for being here.
[00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:25.493]  Great pleasure.
[00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:25.894]  Thank you.
[00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:26.594]  All right, take care.
[00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:38.379]  Good night, Obama.
[00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:44.022]  In the Great Oval Room, there are many memories.
[00:15:44.462 --> 00:15:48.423]  Leaving a leftist legacy, binding America with charisma.
[00:15:49.664 --> 00:15:53.105]  Forcing government-run healthcare upon the greatest nation.
[00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:57.267]  And websites crash on implementation.
[00:15:59.908 --> 00:16:04.030]  The evil ISIS, once called a JV team,
[00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:09.257]  And Hillary's classified emails printed by The Ring.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.003]  Good night Gitmo detainees, exchanged for AWOL crybabies.
[00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:23.307]  Crocodile tears over gun restrictions.
[00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:28.050]  And the IRS targeting conservatism.
[00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:31.673]  Good night safety, let's open the borders.
[00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:37.145]  Good night, Constitution, by executive order.
[00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:41.987]  Good night, brave men in uniform, with half-hearted salute.
[00:16:45.868 --> 00:16:49.149]  Good night, Israel, whom we deeply offended.
[00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:55.091]  Farewell, betrayed voters, campaign promises rescinded.
[00:16:55.111 --> 00:16:58.612]  Good night, talk shows.
[00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.733]  Celebrity horray, now done.
[00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:08.585]  And goodnight to all those clinging to their Bibles and their guns.
[00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:14.410]  Goodnight birth certificate of unknown source.
[00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:19.754]  Goodnight jobs without any remorse.
[00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:24.718]  Goodnight Benghazi and the valiant lives there claimed.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.243]  Goodnight online video, the scapegoat to blame.
[00:17:33.902 --> 00:17:34.823]  Good night Putin.
[00:17:35.904 --> 00:17:37.905]  Good night Kim Jong Un.
[00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.267]  Good night Rose Garden.
[00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:44.430]  Good night winnings East and West.
[00:17:46.652 --> 00:17:49.214]  Good night rainbow victories.
[00:17:51.816 --> 00:17:56.260]  Good night ten trillion in new record-breaking debt.
[00:17:57.441 --> 00:18:01.244]  Good night eight years of fundamental change.
[00:18:03.527 --> 00:18:07.329]  Good night, voters, twice believing what I've said.
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.911]  Hello, Hawaii, where I'll now rest my head.
[00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:19.114]  Good night, America.
[00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:22.035]  Good night, Obama.
[00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:50.261]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.715 --> 00:19:04.376]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:32.435]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:38.738]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:41.460]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.701]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:44.742]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.762 --> 00:19:45.302]  They're unhappy.
[00:19:45.882 --> 00:19:46.863]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.144 --> 00:19:51.966]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.223 --> 00:19:55.744]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.164 --> 00:20:05.089]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:13.633]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.545]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.946 --> 00:20:25.351]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.473]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.226]  To cover yourself with for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:48.574]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:50.155]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:56.179]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.219]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.203]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:15.947]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.228 --> 00:21:20.770]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.811]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:25.632]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.932 --> 00:21:32.015]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:42.059]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:46.621]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:49.742]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:53.747]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.552]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:04.399]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.499 --> 00:22:06.760]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:15.324]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.564 --> 00:22:18.905]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.066 --> 00:22:27.109]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.532]  Super Male Vitality Formula.
[00:22:29.712 --> 00:22:32.055]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:22:32.215 --> 00:22:33.817]  Harvested around the planet.
[00:22:33.957 --> 00:22:36.981]  And then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.201 --> 00:22:39.104]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:44.851]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes.
[00:22:45.111 --> 00:22:47.094]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:53.564]  Super Mill Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.844 --> 00:23:00.775]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mill Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.582]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:05.723 --> 00:23:21.411]  I'm here with Dr. Group, a longtime associate of InfoWars, and he's going to be talking to us about the growing fungal epidemic here, and we're going to be talking about a product that he helped InfoWars create, the MycoZX.
[00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:27.334]  Now, this was designed by you, and can you tell us more about this and more about this fungal epidemic?
[00:23:27.995 --> 00:23:30.097]  Yeah, Millie, thanks for asking me about that.
[00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:34.062]  It really is a problem that most people are not familiar with.
[00:23:34.202 --> 00:23:42.532]  As a matter of fact, most doctors and hospitals really do not take the time and effort to check people for fungal infections.
[00:23:43.533 --> 00:23:53.476]  Over the last 15 years and working with some of the hardest cases, I've come to the conclusion that many people are suffering from chronic fungus infections.
[00:23:53.997 --> 00:23:59.919]  Now, the definition of a fungus is actually a mold, a fungus, or a yeast.
[00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:05.560]  Most people just think that a mold is separate from a fungus or yeast is separate from a fungus.
[00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:12.463]  But because of the standard American diet, because people are consuming so much sugar,
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:19.985]  They're exposed to these organisms and what happens is they get overgrowth of these organisms in the body.
[00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:23.293]  As a matter of fact, I have some research here that I wanted to share with everybody.
[00:24:24.494 --> 00:24:37.643]  According to Jacob Tietelbaum, who's an MD at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Centers in Dallas, Texas, yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32.5 pounds.
[00:24:38.563 --> 00:24:44.647]  What's more, at least 15 million American women suffer from candidiasis, a fungal overgrowth in the intestines.
[00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:51.632]  When you combine all of the chemicals and all the toxins in the food supply and in the toxic beverages that people eat and
[00:24:52.032 --> 00:25:04.886]  Even children these days are coming down with fungal infections and we're seeing different fungus organisms that are being sprayed in the air, that are being found in the water, that are being found on cell phones now.
[00:25:05.366 --> 00:25:12.734]  So what I've been trying to let people know is there really is this epidemic and the sad thing about it is when you're dealing with these fungal
[00:25:13.735 --> 00:25:15.056]  Thank you for having me.
[00:25:33.823 --> 00:25:38.645]  That are all attributed to some form of yeast, fungus, or mold.
[00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:44.088]  And it's really sad because you go to the doctor and I hear this story over and over again.
[00:25:44.228 --> 00:25:46.149]  I've been to the doctor for five years.
[00:25:46.209 --> 00:25:47.590]  I've been to multiple doctors.
[00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.410]  Nobody can tell me what's wrong with me.
[00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.091]  They think that I have allergies.
[00:25:51.611 --> 00:25:56.154]  As a matter of fact, there was a recent study that just came out that shows
[00:25:57.054 --> 00:25:58.556]  Chronic sinusitis.
[00:25:58.596 --> 00:26:03.921]  How many people do you know right now that are having problems with chronic sinus problems?
[00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:05.883]  Runny noses, congestion.
[00:26:06.303 --> 00:26:08.205]  Now they're linking that to a fungus.
[00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:19.216]  So more and more we're able to determine that people are suffering from more and more fungus, yeast, and mold.
[00:26:19.256 --> 00:26:20.297]  And that's the reason why
[00:26:21.118 --> 00:26:33.693]  We've spent years developing a formula to attack that, which is the new formula MycoZX, specifically designed as a yeast and fungus cleansing product.
[00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:35.618]  Wow, that's pretty amazing.
[00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:43.000]  And I'm sure a lot of people are wondering right now, do I have this candida overgrowth or this fungal overgrowth?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.401]  And so you did go over some of the symptoms, which is pretty good.
[00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:56.964]  I mean, but could you touch more into that and more into what are the long-term ill effects of having a prolonged case of a candida or fungal overgrowth in your body?
[00:26:57.918 --> 00:27:07.870]  Well the thing is it's slow death really because fungus and microorganisms are not technically designed to kill you right away.
[00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:15.619]  They're designed to incapacitate you and it can take three to six months before you even start developing symptoms.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.485]  So it's really one of those hidden organisms that has a detrimental effect on your health over a period of time.
[00:27:24.305 --> 00:27:30.129]  And those are all the precursors to heart disease, precursors to cancer, precursors to diabetes.
[00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.672]  So ultimately, you're at risk from these harmful organisms.
[00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:44.859]  And I've been saying for a long time, you know, there's even traced back to biological bioweapon production in the early 1900s.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:28:10.381]  So when you combine multitudes of all these factors, the mold and the yeast and the fungus in the body, these are debilitating organisms that are going to slowly affect you over a period of time that are precursors to digestive health problems, hormone imbalance problems, heart disease problems, liver problems.
[00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:13.744]  All of these organisms as well secrete toxins
[00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:14.804]  I don't
[00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:45.359]  And then push out, they go to the bathroom and push out all these harmful chemical toxins, usually acidic toxins that can burn holes in the gut tissue as well as circulate in the bloodstream and cause toxemia within the system.
[00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:54.165]  And that's why I recommend everybody goes through at least a yeast and fungus cleanse about every three months.
[00:28:55.017 --> 00:29:05.321]  Wow, so can those toxins lead to things like anxiety or panic attacks or things like that for people since it's, you know, the toxins are affecting their whole body system?
[00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:15.185]  So, most of the yeast and the mold organisms that are out there have been linked to anxiety and there's a gut-brain connection anyway.
[00:29:15.305 --> 00:29:21.327]  So, anytime you have problems with your gut, you're most likely going to have problems with those
[00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:25.338]  Mental illnesses, which they label them.
[00:29:25.478 --> 00:29:40.564]  I personally say there is no such thing as mental illnesses because you can track it all back to a chemical toxicity through artificial sweeteners that you're consuming, artificial sugars, MSG, genetically modified foods, pesticide and herbicide residue.
[00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:41.945]  The list goes on and on and on.
[00:29:41.985 --> 00:29:44.086]  Toxic water, toxic beverages, toxic food.
[00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:45.247]  We're good to go!
[00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:17.715]  And in your bathrooms, the same stuff you find in your shower can actually have detrimental effects on your health over time too, especially living in the southern United States or where the humidity levels are really high.
[00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:32.364]  Wow, so yeah, I mean, I've heard about black mold causing people cancer and all kinds of problems, and so it does make sense that a candida overgrowth in your body, a fungal overgrowth in your body, could be very detrimental.
[00:30:32.404 --> 00:30:47.075]  And I know that you talked a little bit on sugars being something that this candida fungus feeds off of, so I'm just curious, can you go more into how MycoZx is going to be able to help people in this modern day where we literally have
[00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:53.372]  Is sugar so much in our food supply, in our diets, that we can't avoid it?
[00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:55.113]  We're feeding this fungus in our body.
[00:30:55.813 --> 00:30:56.093]  Yes.
[00:30:56.153 --> 00:31:08.620]  Well, MycoZx was specifically developed to, and what I did was search the whole globe to find what herbs and what compounds in herbs are going to be the most efficient at
[00:31:10.484 --> 00:31:18.206]  Addressing what the organisms are and actually become toxic to those organisms.
[00:31:18.246 --> 00:31:21.887]  For example, the MycoZx contains two enzymes.
[00:31:22.007 --> 00:31:26.108]  One of them is beta-glucanase and the other one is hemicellulase.
[00:31:26.428 --> 00:31:33.350]  Now these enzymes are specifically designed to help break down the exterior coating of the organisms.
[00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:39.372]  Because a lot of times when you're dealing with harmful organisms, whether it's mold or yeast or candida or any type of fungus,
[00:31:39.972 --> 00:31:40.553]  They're going to
[00:31:59.995 --> 00:32:06.399]  Can actually penetrate in and help the body adjust and adapt to the killing of those organisms.
[00:32:06.439 --> 00:32:24.910]  Now we use things like jatoba, and we use licorice, and we use specific herbs that have concentrations of certain chemicals in there, all natural by the way, that are specifically designed to attack those type of organisms in the body.
[00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.672]  And you mentioned earlier about the sugar consumption.
[00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:34.559]  We have a huge sugar epidemic as well with the high fructose corn syrup and we have all the carbohydrates.
[00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:41.225]  So we basically have everybody living right now with a high percentage of their diets
[00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:59.041]  Consuming refined carbohydrates or cooked carbohydrates like rice and a lot of potato and a lot of corn based products and all of those convert into glucose in the body and that sugar just wreaks havoc on the system.
[00:33:06.528 --> 00:33:16.057]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.980]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.042]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsTore.com?
[00:33:23.402 --> 00:33:25.643]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.123 --> 00:33:26.743]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.384 --> 00:33:32.466]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.946 --> 00:33:33.947]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:36.788]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.749]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:44.792]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.612 --> 00:33:52.350]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.689 --> 00:33:55.910]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:03.694]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.434 --> 00:34:07.215]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.255 --> 00:34:09.656]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.696 --> 00:34:13.698]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.939]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:18.695]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.295 --> 00:34:30.323]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.363 --> 00:34:31.965]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:34.126]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:41.792]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.552 --> 00:34:44.894]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:47.676]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:54.180]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:07.750]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:08.890]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:10.151]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:13.032]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.112 --> 00:35:13.893]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.953 --> 00:35:14.873]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.253 --> 00:35:16.594]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:17.254]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.274 --> 00:35:17.734]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.774 --> 00:35:18.335]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:19.215]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.235 --> 00:35:21.556]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:22.016 --> 00:35:29.620]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.981]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:40.722]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:42.082]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.102 --> 00:35:43.223]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.383 --> 00:35:46.183]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.983 --> 00:35:54.925]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.445 --> 00:36:00.448]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.549 --> 00:36:07.953]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a case of a crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.993 --> 00:36:09.254]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.675 --> 00:36:10.795]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.855 --> 00:36:14.058]  So, they can wear this, and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.318 --> 00:36:20.342]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.522 --> 00:36:24.504]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.365 --> 00:36:28.710]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.471]  People didn't believe in it.
[00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:30.813]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.873 --> 00:36:32.635]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.957 --> 00:36:36.060]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.981 --> 00:36:41.207]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:48.374]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.854 --> 00:36:51.256]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:51.256]  $200.
[00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:54.419]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:54.499 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:04.278 --> 00:37:06.039]  Here we are, I'm going to cut this layer.
[00:37:30.182 --> 00:37:30.402]  Boom.
[00:37:30.823 --> 00:37:34.606]  And now we're going to add it to a different layer on top of that other layer.
[00:37:34.966 --> 00:37:41.591]  And now you can see, this is a completely different layer and there is even a missing number on this when you bring this back in.
[00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:46.475]  Yeah, so this one was here originally, but then they added these numbers it looks like.
[00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:48.557]  Watch the signature here.
[00:37:49.678 --> 00:37:51.700]  Part of the signature's there and part of it's not.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.281]  They add the numbers 1 here.
[00:37:54.742 --> 00:37:56.683]  And over here there's a three and a one added.
[00:37:56.703 --> 00:38:03.588]  You can just see by turning it on and off, you know, there's different letters all over this that have been added into it.
[00:38:03.628 --> 00:38:05.770]  But Hawaiian officials have addressed that also.
[00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:17.337]  They have said what is on the birth certificate that has been produced, which is a computer-generated birth certificate, that that is real and that indeed he was born in Hawaii.
[00:38:17.938 --> 00:38:24.322]  Hawaiian officials have said that what is in their files, that certificate of live birth,
[00:38:24.962 --> 00:38:25.623]  First of all,
[00:38:45.133 --> 00:38:47.034]  Chris, we'll get to the proposal in a minute.
[00:38:47.174 --> 00:38:48.635]  The proposal is not crazy.
[00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:50.175]  Show me his birth certificate.
[00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.856]  That's the way to deal with this.
[00:38:52.216 --> 00:38:58.238]  Mail this birth certificate to the wacko wing of your party so they see it and say, I agree with this.
[00:38:58.378 --> 00:38:58.999]  It's over.
[00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:04.161]  What is the motive behind Malik Obama's unveiling of his half-brother's fraud?
[00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:06.462]  Tell me about your relationship with your brother.
[00:39:06.702 --> 00:39:07.122]  How is it?
[00:39:07.142 --> 00:39:11.984]  He used to be good, but I think since he's become the president, you know,
[00:39:12.907 --> 00:39:13.548]  He's changed.
[00:39:14.388 --> 00:39:15.889]  You think the office has changed him?
[00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.251]  It's changed him.
[00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:19.232]  I think he's been sucked into that matrix.
[00:39:19.612 --> 00:39:20.693]  Yeah.
[00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:22.395]  And mesmerized by the power.
[00:39:23.092 --> 00:39:30.115]  This could also be yet another carefully constructed landmine for President Trump, as the Russian collusion has proven false.
[00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:40.639]  This distraction could hinder the remarkable job President Trump has already done in just 50 days to improve consumer confidence and decrease unemployment.
[00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:51.643]  But, if the Kenyan birth certificate is miraculously verified, as his Hawaiian birth certificate has already been verified as a fraud by two document experts,
[00:39:51.903 --> 00:40:13.757]  Reid Hayes, a man with 40 years, since 1974, 40 plus years of experience in examining forensics, document, handwriting, a man who's well respected in his expertise, a court recognized expert, a document examiner.
[00:40:13.817 --> 00:40:19.300]  Mr. Hayes told me right off the bat, I'm an Obama supporter.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.641]  I voted for him twice.
[00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:25.256]  He goes, and I will never do anything to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:31.138]  What I had said to him was, Reid, I am not asking you to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:40:32.078 --> 00:40:36.820]  I'm asking you to take a look at this document and clear it and tell me there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:38.941]  Would you at least do that?
[00:40:40.682 --> 00:40:41.542]  And he took a look at it.
[00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:47.904]  And when he called me back, he told me, Mike, I can't clear this.
[00:40:47.944 --> 00:40:49.085]  There's something wrong with it.
[00:40:49.105 --> 00:40:49.885]  Both Reid Hayes
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.443]  President Barack Obama's impersonation of a United States citizen in order to run for president
[00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:10.134]  We're good to go.
[00:41:39.694 --> 00:41:52.597]  If the Kenyan document is verified as real, Obama and his hordes of anti-American leftist social justice warrior communist sympathizers would be the laughingstock of the globe for years to come.
[00:41:53.117 --> 00:41:54.277]  Oh wait, too late.
[00:41:54.597 --> 00:41:56.538]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:14.716]  The internet is not as safe as we'd like to believe, with government hacking, surveillance, and identity theft lurking around every single corner.
[00:42:15.914 --> 00:42:18.796]  Now, if you're an InfoWars regular, you probably already know about that.
[00:42:19.597 --> 00:42:23.360]  But, last night, chilling new CIA WikiLeaks were dropped.
[00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:32.227]  Now, you can say what you want about WikiLeaks, but the fact of the matter is they've alerted us to thousands of vicious schemes in the past by threats both foreign and domestic.
[00:42:32.927 --> 00:42:40.634]  Now, what's so chilling about this new CIA reveal is that we find out their tendrils stretch even farther than we thought they did in the past.
[00:42:41.374 --> 00:42:48.621]  They can even hack into any recently made cars using the computer components and shut off brakes or tell it to drive off a cliff.
[00:42:48.701 --> 00:42:50.182]  This is really frightening stuff, folks.
[00:42:50.683 --> 00:42:53.545]  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:42:53.845 --> 00:43:01.232]  We haven't even begun to talk about how they can shut down your phone, they can shut down your computer, they can track you, they can hack you on any of the devices.
[00:43:01.773 --> 00:43:02.573]  It's totally crazy.
[00:43:03.434 --> 00:43:08.998]  On WhatsApp and Telegram, apps that millions of people in America use because they think it's undetected.
[00:43:09.498 --> 00:43:10.018]  It's not.
[00:43:10.259 --> 00:43:11.459]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks.
[00:43:11.479 --> 00:43:14.942]  The CIA can look at that stuff, interpret it however they want.
[00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:19.625]  So, there's not really any real internet privacy anymore.
[00:43:20.185 --> 00:43:24.608]  But, we don't blame the CIA for this and say, hey, this is wrong, this needs to stop.
[00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:25.409]  We go, no.
[00:43:26.823 --> 00:43:27.864]  We're going to blame the messenger.
[00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:30.046]  That's what the mainstream media really does.
[00:43:30.547 --> 00:43:36.072]  We go after WikiLeaks, and sure, there are a few problems that need to be addressed with them in the future.
[00:43:36.492 --> 00:43:39.095]  But for now, we're being alerted to all these schemes.
[00:43:39.695 --> 00:43:42.658]  But the fact of the matter is, we don't care enough as a society.
[00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:45.942]  So what we need to do is get out there and get awake.
[00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:47.303]  Tell your friends.
[00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:48.224]  Tell your family.
[00:43:48.564 --> 00:43:49.245]  Alert them to this.
[00:43:49.345 --> 00:43:50.927]  Tell them to visit InfoWars.com.
[00:43:50.947 --> 00:43:52.268]  Tell them to go to our YouTube page.
[00:43:52.689 --> 00:43:54.531]  Because the word needs to go out there.
[00:43:55.111 --> 00:44:02.679]  We need to alert people about this because this is far more serious than any little petty problem that you're worrying about.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.181]  The Netflix password not working?
[00:44:04.602 --> 00:44:04.982]  Sorry.
[00:44:05.362 --> 00:44:08.065]  This is 10,000 times bigger than that.
[00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:11.007]  And folks, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:44:11.307 --> 00:44:13.948]  These new Wikileaks goes on and on and on.
[00:44:14.248 --> 00:44:16.888]  But luckily, you don't have to sit through a 23-hour video.
[00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:21.530]  You can go to InfoWars.com or get the free InfoWars Live mobile app today.
[00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.611]  I'm Rex Jones, and you're fighting the InfoWar.
[00:44:29.692 --> 00:44:31.433]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:44:31.653 --> 00:44:32.953]  Canada is a good example.
[00:44:33.473 --> 00:44:35.194]  The UK is a good example.
[00:44:35.254 --> 00:44:35.494]  Why?
[00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.591]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:44.253]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:44:45.033 --> 00:44:47.574]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:49.114]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:44:49.174 --> 00:44:50.915]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:44:51.035 --> 00:45:03.599]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:45:09.096 --> 00:45:09.596]  Go ahead.
[00:45:10.677 --> 00:45:11.617]  Make my day.
[00:45:12.158 --> 00:45:16.100]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.963]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:45:22.363 --> 00:45:30.807]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:45:31.168 --> 00:45:31.648]  We'll make it.
[00:45:32.885 --> 00:45:35.767]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:43.393]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:45:43.733 --> 00:45:50.719]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:45:50.879 --> 00:45:54.321]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:45:55.362 --> 00:45:56.826]  Bodyguards.
[00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:58.990]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:45:59.331 --> 00:46:01.376]  The average American does not have that.
[00:46:01.716 --> 00:46:05.585]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:07.525]  The majority of Americans.
[00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:09.646]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got!
[00:46:10.086 --> 00:46:12.427]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:46:12.907 --> 00:46:18.768]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:46:18.808 --> 00:46:25.670]  We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.673]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:46:30.013 --> 00:46:37.578]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school calls it a terrorist threat.
[00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:41.081]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:45.984]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:46:46.464 --> 00:46:48.466]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:54.045]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:46:54.325 --> 00:46:56.107]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:57.147]  would you see that happening?
[00:46:57.207 --> 00:47:01.251]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:07.736]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.444 --> 00:47:10.006]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.406 --> 00:47:15.412]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.772 --> 00:47:21.218]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.618 --> 00:47:28.205]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.007]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.790]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.072]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.492 --> 00:47:40.115]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.877]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.487 --> 00:48:00.611]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.233]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:03.334]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:08.338]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:13.462]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:18.847]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.068]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:22.830]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.230]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.433]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.453 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.515]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.175]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:59.082]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.693]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, some people would consider me a troll in the street.
[00:49:11.013 --> 00:49:15.256]  But now, it looks like there's a troll in the publishing industry.
[00:49:15.817 --> 00:49:23.782]  The top-rated Amazon bestseller list features the book, Reason to Vote for Democrats, a comprehensive guide.
[00:49:24.303 --> 00:49:26.124]  Ben Shapiro called it thorough.
[00:49:26.504 --> 00:49:27.245]  What's the twist?
[00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:28.066]  The book?
[00:49:28.951 --> 00:49:29.091]  Is it?
[00:49:48.897 --> 00:49:53.921]  Us that voted Trump are finding that there's a lot of reasons why we did vote Trump, and they're starting to pan out.
[00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:56.263]  Look at all the jobs numbers that we have right here.
[00:49:56.483 --> 00:49:57.323]  Right, exactly.
[00:49:57.344 --> 00:50:01.166]  28,000 jobs in manufacturing, 8,000 in the government.
[00:50:01.186 --> 00:50:04.749]  Well, 8,000 in government, we maybe could cut into those, but he did cut from the IRS.
[00:50:05.129 --> 00:50:06.831]  You got over 152,528, a record number.
[00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:06.911]  No, 152,500.
[00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:08.032]  Thank you for correcting me.
[00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:08.812]  You said this wrong earlier.
[00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:15.598]  Millions!
[00:50:15.718 --> 00:50:16.219]  Millions!
[00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:20.404]  Their numbers are so big, the job growth is so good that you can't even get it right.
[00:50:20.444 --> 00:50:20.845]  It's unbelievable.
[00:50:20.865 --> 00:50:21.345]  It's staggering.
[00:50:22.182 --> 00:50:26.745]  Yes, and actually, since the inauguration, here's something else you probably have never heard.
[00:50:27.205 --> 00:50:28.006]  The U.S.
[00:50:28.186 --> 00:50:33.029]  debt has been reduced by more than $60 billion.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:35.771]  $60 billion in U.S.
[00:50:35.951 --> 00:50:38.313]  debt reduction since Trump's inauguration.
[00:50:38.673 --> 00:50:39.373]  So there you go.
[00:50:39.474 --> 00:50:46.618]  No reasons to vote Democrat, but I think that we can all say that we're pretty thankful that the majority of America voted for Trump.
[00:50:46.959 --> 00:50:49.400]  He's accomplished a lot in his first 50 days.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.862]  And the amazing thing about it is he's getting
[00:50:53.062 --> 00:51:01.587]  So much strife, you know, throughout the first month of his presidency, going on two months here soon.
[00:51:02.067 --> 00:51:03.768]  It's amazing what he's been able to do.
[00:51:04.408 --> 00:51:08.250]  And all the Democrats that are never Trumpers that want to stand up there, they want him impeached.
[00:51:08.551 --> 00:51:09.491]  I mean, they want him impeached.
[00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:12.613]  They've been crying about Russian meddling for three months.
[00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:21.417]  They've completely ignored the fact that Donald Trump has created economic growth in the form of jobs that we haven't seen in 10 years.
[00:51:21.637 --> 00:51:21.837]  Right.
[00:51:22.057 --> 00:51:29.021]  He wasn't running on a campaign of social justice warrior activism like Hillary Clinton was trying to kowtow to that group.
[00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:37.125]  There in the tail end, he campaigned on being the jobs president when asked, you know, how would you fix race relations in this country?
[00:51:37.445 --> 00:51:38.705]  He said jobs.
[00:51:38.906 --> 00:51:41.627]  And now he is beginning to fulfill his promise.
[00:51:41.667 --> 00:51:43.708]  And we're seeing that in these staggering numbers.
[00:51:44.388 --> 00:51:45.669]  So this is really good news.
[00:51:45.709 --> 00:51:58.375]  And people, of course, aren't going to focus on all of the good news that's out there because they think it's more interesting to talk about the fact that Kellyanne Conway put her feet on the couch rather than the fact that all of those black leaders were there
[00:51:58.875 --> 00:52:03.677]  Meeting with Donald Trump because he was giving them, what, $25 billion to black colleges?
[00:52:04.197 --> 00:52:06.138]  That's not the news that they want you to know about, though.
[00:52:06.178 --> 00:52:12.621]  They don't want you to think out there to say, wow, he really is fulfilling his campaign promises and he's going to help our community.
[00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:18.564]  They just want you to go on black Twitter, as they call it, and make fun of Kelly and Conway's feet on the couch.
[00:52:18.584 --> 00:52:23.346]  So, I mean, we can definitely see how Trump has been fulfilling his campaign promises.
[00:52:23.426 --> 00:52:25.607]  But something I wanted to bring to your attention
[00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:34.190]  Earlier this week, they ran a poll, a Rasmussen poll, to just kind of test the waters and see if people are still with her.
[00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:35.750]  And guess what?
[00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:36.971]  They are not with her.
[00:52:37.391 --> 00:52:40.272]  Just like we resisted... Excuse me, with it.
[00:52:40.552 --> 00:52:40.972]  With it.
[00:52:41.092 --> 00:52:41.653]  Not with it.
[00:52:44.213 --> 00:52:49.375]  Just as we resisted her there on the election day, people are still resisting Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:49.855 --> 00:53:00.078]  So 58% of people who would be likely voters in the city of New York, where she's, you know, thinking about becoming, throwing herself into the mayor's race there, they don't want her to run.
[00:53:00.838 --> 00:53:04.001]  They're saying no, absolutely not.
[00:53:04.121 --> 00:53:05.242]  So they are not with her.
[00:53:05.262 --> 00:53:07.124]  She's not even going to win the mayoral race.
[00:53:07.404 --> 00:53:12.168]  We actually kind of joked about that, like how sad would that be if she ran and lost there?
[00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:14.270]  You know it's funny because since the election,
[00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:20.332]  A lot of the Hillary bots out there, they kind of fell silent.
[00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:23.893]  I mean, you know, you don't really see too much support for Hillary Clinton anymore, honestly.
[00:53:23.953 --> 00:53:28.695]  I see more support for Bernie Sanders than I see for Hillary Clinton.
[00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:34.918]  Well, there's this weird phenomenon going on right now, Leigh-Anne, at least this is kind of what I feel like is happening, where
[00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:45.083]  Now that the presidential race is over and Trump is already in, they've given up the whole Trump versus Hillary fight and it's just all a Trump fight now.
[00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:45.423]  Right.
[00:53:45.523 --> 00:54:01.791]  But there's this weird thing behind it where they kind of have accepted, there's this weird acceptance, there's this weird realization or just something they just continued to deny during the presidential race that now they are accepting that Hillary Clinton is a scumbag criminal witch.
[00:54:02.051 --> 00:54:03.672]  And no one's protecting her now.
[00:54:04.092 --> 00:54:07.794]  And when I try to talk to these people, you'll notice they don't want to talk about Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:08.014 --> 00:54:09.375]  They don't want to bring up Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:09.395 --> 00:54:10.476]  It's just anti-Trump, anti-Trump.
[00:54:10.496 --> 00:54:12.157]  And it's like, well, that's what you would have gotten.
[00:54:12.957 --> 00:54:16.539]  And that's why, you know, to me, sometimes I go there in a debate.
[00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:20.582]  I say, hey, look, you know, you may not like the fact that Trump is going to put you back to work.
[00:54:20.642 --> 00:54:21.102]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:21.162 --> 00:54:24.744]  I know that you're dreading the fact that Trump is going to get you a job and a future in America.
[00:54:25.084 --> 00:54:25.825]  But you know what?
[00:54:26.885 --> 00:54:27.986]  What was Hillary going to do for you?
[00:54:28.006 --> 00:54:29.407]  And then you see they back off.
[00:54:29.487 --> 00:54:31.068]  Oh, you know, there's no support for Hillary anymore.
[00:54:31.448 --> 00:54:43.364]  Because I think they all realize now, once everything kind of settled, once the dust settled and we're moving forward, they kind of knew it the whole time, but now they have to accept it like, yeah, you know, man, Hillary Clinton, she really was wicked.
[00:54:43.384 --> 00:54:49.752]  And, you know, even though Trump's president, and I obviously hate him, I can't stand up for Hillary because she was really wicked too.
[00:54:49.912 --> 00:55:12.141]  And then now, as they're really kind of full steam ahead attacking Trump and trying to tie him with Russian collusion and all of that, that we learn that it was Obama's Department of Justice who allegedly granted the order to do the wiretapping at the same time that the Obama Department of Justice was going out of their way to protect Hillary Clinton and to divert any attention
[00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:28.904]  From the fact that she and her foundation were under active FBI investigation, and so at the same time they're kind of protecting her, they are engaging in this clandestine operation, counterintelligence operation against their political operative.
[00:55:28.944 --> 00:55:38.446]  So there Obama had his thumb on the scale, and that's why we have the mainstream media and others absolutely freaking out and trying to say, well, no, no, there was never any wiretapping.
[00:55:38.486 --> 00:55:41.507]  It was just some surveillance of some Russian characters.
[00:55:41.627 --> 00:55:46.849]  And you just saw that video that I did, Maxine Water admits that Obama wiretapped Trump.
[00:55:47.229 --> 00:55:47.909]  Yeah, of course!
[00:55:48.089 --> 00:55:48.749]  See, that's the thing!
[00:55:49.389 --> 00:55:50.890]  It's this crazy double thing!
[00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.510]  Look at this, Leigh-Anne, look at this.
[00:55:52.850 --> 00:56:01.853]  Obama says elections are rigged when he's campaigning, okay, then he wins, and then Trump says that they're rigged, and now Obama says, oh, I've never heard of rigged elections.
[00:56:02.213 --> 00:56:04.494]  Then Trump wins, he says Russia rigged the elections.
[00:56:04.554 --> 00:56:07.715]  Okay, whatever, that's just absolutely insane, that has to be the most insane thing I've ever heard.
[00:56:07.995 --> 00:56:08.815]  Oh wait, hold on.
[00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:10.156]  It does get more insane.
[00:56:10.516 --> 00:56:13.378]  Obama says, well, we're worried that Russia meddled in the elections.
[00:56:13.578 --> 00:56:14.438]  We're going to investigate.
[00:56:14.518 --> 00:56:15.459]  We're going to investigate this.
[00:56:15.479 --> 00:56:16.219]  We're going to look into this.
[00:56:16.299 --> 00:56:27.705]  Maxine Waters admits it, says, yeah, the Obama administration did everything possible, which would mean wiretapping phones, checking phone records to look for Russian meddling with Trump, but then comes out again.
[00:56:28.505 --> 00:56:29.825]  Oh, there was no wiretapping.
[00:56:29.905 --> 00:56:30.086]  Right.
[00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:33.126]  We were wiretapping to look for Russian ties, but there was no wiretapping.
[00:56:33.407 --> 00:56:40.109]  And then, this is a news story that broke today, GOP Rep Obama stayed in Capitol to run shadow government.
[00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:40.409]  Yep.
[00:56:40.449 --> 00:56:47.031]  A Pennsylvania congressman has accused former President Barack Obama of staying in Washington solely to run a shadow government to undermine the GOP agenda.
[00:56:47.251 --> 00:56:47.651]  That's U.S.
[00:56:47.691 --> 00:56:48.751]  Representative Mike Kelly.
[00:56:49.051 --> 00:56:51.812]  And there's been other members of the government that have come out and said the same thing.
[00:56:52.052 --> 00:56:54.633]  Maxine Waters, the big mouth bass, she couldn't help
[00:56:55.214 --> 00:56:57.616]  She loves going on camera and doing anything to bring down Trump.
[00:56:57.636 --> 00:56:58.617]  Talk about Russian ties.
[00:56:58.678 --> 00:56:59.919]  Right, and this is so incredible.
[00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:01.901]  We said, why is he staying in D.C.?
[00:57:01.921 --> 00:57:04.644]  Didn't he want to go be an ESPN sportscaster or something?
[00:57:04.845 --> 00:57:07.307]  It's like he couldn't wait to go play golf at the end of the day.
[00:57:07.347 --> 00:57:11.432]  I'm pretty sure he clocked out at like 6 o'clock every day from being the president.
[00:57:11.752 --> 00:57:13.094]  So why is he sticking around D.C.? ?
[00:57:14.275 --> 00:57:15.755]  Yeah, and so here's the thing.
[00:57:15.815 --> 00:57:34.480]  He thought he would run this coup and keep all of his policies in play with this unelected shadow government that's there, and now it's all coming back to bite him because if indeed he did use his political power and his position to wiretap and spy on the Democrats' political opponent, that is way worse.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:35.501]  And here's what I would say.
[00:57:35.841 --> 00:57:36.461]  You know, I wish
[00:57:37.506 --> 00:57:40.507]  You know, sometimes I actually wish that I could debate the Young Turks.
[00:57:40.647 --> 00:57:41.887]  Like, I wish that they would actually come.
[00:57:41.927 --> 00:57:44.428]  I don't even want to speak their names because that's how irrelevant they are.
[00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:45.428]  Because here's the funny thing.
[00:57:45.488 --> 00:57:50.930]  I would say, okay, you really think, and it goes for all of them, they're just like the leaders of the alt-left or whatever, the Young Turks.
[00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.771]  I'd say, okay, you really think...
[00:57:54.750 --> 00:58:01.114]  That Donald Trump is under Russian influence, whether it be through blackmail or this, that, or another thing working with Putin.
[00:58:01.354 --> 00:58:02.295]  You really believe that?
[00:58:02.856 --> 00:58:06.838]  So that's a serious threat and even you're suggesting treason.
[00:58:07.278 --> 00:58:12.882]  So then you would say, we have to wiretap, we have to check phone records, we have to do everything.
[00:58:13.222 --> 00:58:15.504]  All the people that said, oh yes, Obama's doing everything.
[00:58:15.824 --> 00:58:16.305]  But now...
[00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:19.566]  When Trump says that this is going on, you have to deny it.
[00:58:19.966 --> 00:58:21.547]  This is the brainwashing.
[00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:30.351]  This is the epitome of your brainwashing, where it doesn't matter even if you admit a fact, as soon as Trump wants to say that that's a fact, all of a sudden it becomes a falsity to you.
[00:58:30.971 --> 00:58:32.212]  That's what Donald Trump is doing.
[00:58:32.412 --> 00:58:37.434]  He's saying the facts that they've already said, and then showing how they're brainwashed, and they deny those facts.
[00:58:37.782 --> 00:58:40.205]  Right, I mean we're seeing this liberal hypocrisy again and again.
[00:58:40.225 --> 00:58:45.851]  Just like they're attacking the First Lady for calling for more nature and outdoors time, now all of a sudden they hate nature.
[00:58:46.532 --> 00:58:46.893]  Insane.
[00:58:47.573 --> 00:58:53.680]  And I think that Trump should continue to do this, to troll them so that they have to admit their own double standards.
[00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:55.402]  Thanks to everybody who tuned in tonight.
