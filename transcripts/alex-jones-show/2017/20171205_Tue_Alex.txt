[00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.368]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.273]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.413]  My friends, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:53.855]  It's already Tuesday, the fifth day of December 2017.
[00:00:54.515 --> 00:01:03.382]  I'm going to be live here the next four hours, as we are, every single weekday from 11 a.m.
[00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:04.523]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:05.023]  Central.
[00:01:05.143 --> 00:01:07.225]  And of course, we have the other live broadcasts.
[00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:18.193]  You can find all the details on from the Real News with David Knight to the War Room with Owen Schroer at Infowars.com forward slash show and radio stations and TV stations, a growing list across the country.
[00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.155]  I feel like I am in heaven right now.
[00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:35.379]  I've just gotten so busy over the years that slowly ND filters got turned up on the cameras in here, where we were like in the blazing noon sun in the Sahara Desert.
[00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.900]  And then I, about a year and a half ago, I said, let's order some of these lights that aren't in the blue spectrum.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.381]  And then those got on back order, never came, and we ordered another place.
[00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.562]  It's weird trying to get equipment, especially specialty equipment.
[00:01:49.653 --> 00:02:03.522]  But then finally, yesterday, some of the crew spent hours up here last night turning the cameras way down and turning the irises up and turning the lights way down.
[00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:06.144]  And I feel like I am on vacation right now.
[00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:11.968]  Because sometimes it's so bright in here that I feel like I'm hung up.
[00:02:13.547 --> 00:02:15.448]  By my wrist, you know, being interrogated.
[00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:18.709]  So this is going to be great.
[00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.130]  Really, really excited about the changes they've made in the studio.
[00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.873]  It's also fun to have some footage from downtown Austin, the city I come to you from, of the Christmas tree.
[00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:40.416]  And I tweeted out some photos of myself decorating the Christmas tree last night with my children and my parents.
[00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.936]  And with my sister, who came over visiting with her fiancÃ©.
[00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:52.023]  And the leftists went, oh, we're not trying to get rid of Christmas.
[00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:54.825]  We're not attacking Christians, Jones.
[00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.508]  Quit acting like you own Christmas.
[00:02:57.588 --> 00:03:00.050]  Quit acting like there's a war on it.
[00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:02.413]  Went all over the country.
[00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:13.489]  They're not saying Merry Christmas and they're attacking Christianity and demonizing Western civilization and saying that whiteness is inherently evil and that Islam is good.
[00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.773]  I mean, quit pretending like you're not foaming at the mouth extremists.
[00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:21.675]  That's what it really comes down to.
[00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:23.597]  Quit pretending like that.
[00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:31.563]  Listen, that said, ladies and gentlemen, we have just unbelievable developments here today with
[00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:36.984]  Anti-Trump FBI agent saved Hillary from prison.
[00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:42.007]  I don't think that the headline on Infowars.com and Newswars.com is even strong enough.
[00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:56.137]  The FBI agents that have been removed off of the probe because they were such minions of Hillary are the ones that let her make false statements to them and are the ones that covered it up.
[00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:02.499]  So that's a big story at newswars.com, but the mainstream media is foaming at the mouth.
[00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:07.821]  They're behaving like this is all imminent and it's gonna happen.
[00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:15.303]  The daughter of the war criminal, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was on Morning Joe with creepy Joe Scarborough.
[00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:22.305]  Morning Joe, Trump team going to jail for the rest of their lives and the nooses around their neck.
[00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.212]  So, that's all coming up after the break.
[00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:33.077]  And the GOP preps contempt resolution for top FBI DOJ officials after missed Monday deadline.
[00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:34.678]  And Hannity gets it right.
[00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:36.279]  He says the GOP is a dead party.
[00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:39.901]  Morally corrupt, weak, ineffective, visionless, with no identity.
[00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:44.144]  But then the big brother news today is really important.
[00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:45.545]  I got a big stack of that.
[00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:50.267]  People keep finding hidden cameras in Airbnbs.
[00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:55.512]  How does that tie in to Google, Facebook, the surveillance state, and more?
[00:04:56.373 --> 00:04:57.214]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.857]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.712]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:15.359]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.104]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:05:21.844 --> 00:05:29.210]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.477]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:05:38.117 --> 00:05:42.881]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.723]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:58.328]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:02.709]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:14.894]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:26.145]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is a paragon.
[00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:27.366]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:27.946]  Scum!
[00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.668]  Russian scum!
[00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:32.028]  The Dolores comes to mind.
[00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:46.862]  Your reputation is amazing.
[00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:48.662]  I will not let you down.
[00:06:48.822 --> 00:06:51.664]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:06:56.586 --> 00:06:59.327]  It's Tuesday, the 5th day of December 2017.
[00:06:59.427 --> 00:07:01.988]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:08.591]  We're going to be here for the next four hours coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:07:10.407 --> 00:07:15.150]  Let me just control myself and just read the headlines to you.
[00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.575]  I'm going to do it in this first segment and then I'm going to burrow back into it in great detail coming up in the next segment.
[00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:29.979]  GOP preps contempt resolution for top FBI DOJ officials after missed Monday deadline.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.242]  More anti-Trump messages reportedly sent by members of Mueller's team.
[00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:37.724]  A lot more is going to come out.
[00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:39.325]  That's Congress.
[00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:45.229]  Anti-Trump FBI agent saved Hillary from prison.
[00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:46.950]  That's on newswars.com.
[00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:57.355]  Calls grow for Russian collusion investigation to be shut down by high-level members of Congress and even liberal media.
[00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:02.878]  Headline, magazine, dim obsession with impeachment dangerous to their own party.
[00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:07.260]  Oh yeah, they are really playing with thermal nuclear political fire here.
[00:08:13.114 --> 00:08:13.534]  It's happening.
[00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:29.902]  Mueller subpoenas Trump's Deutsche Bank records from more than 10 years ago on $300 million he borrowed to build a hotel in DC, one in Chicago,
[00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:35.036]  It's just crazy.
[00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:39.339]  Talk about widening the scope way beyond anything they were ever supposed to do.
[00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.581]  And of course, the Germans have signaled, sure, we'll give you the records.
[00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:43.282]  There's nothing there.
[00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:45.103]  They're just looking for anything.
[00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:51.007]  But it's known that the Russians do invest some in Deutsche Bank, so do every other major country.
[00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:55.291]  But again, they know the public isn't aware of that or that financially savvy on average.
[00:08:56.611 --> 00:09:02.136]  I mean, every Fortune 500 company out there, most of them have Russian investment, but they're just trying to find something.
[00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:11.466]  Top Clinton aides face no charges after making false statements to the FBI, the very FBI agents that have now been kicked out of the investigation.
[00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:15.827]  The whole house of cards is coming down.
[00:09:16.927 --> 00:09:26.309]  Again, dismissed FBI agent is the one who changed Hillary Clinton's scandal language from grossly negligent, which is a criminal term, to extremely careless.
[00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.830]  That is not a legal term.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.123]  Gross negligence is the legal term and is criminal.
[00:09:34.864 --> 00:09:39.588]  So that's obstruction of justice right there by the good old FBI.
[00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:44.431]  Bunch of political hacks that protected Loretta Lynch, the Clintons, the TARMAC meetings.
[00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:45.272]  We have them.
[00:09:46.332 --> 00:09:50.175]  Last week the FBI released on themselves to expose it without anybody asking for it.
[00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:55.539]  The TARMAC documents with senior FBI covering up the illegal meeting.
[00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:05.702]  Exclusive FBI supervisor booted from Mueller probe interviewed Mike Flynn.
[00:10:07.123 --> 00:10:11.486]  See, this is the key FBI agent who was over everything.
[00:10:12.147 --> 00:10:18.732]  All the key statements now saying that Flynn made different statements according to his notes than what they've now got in an NSA transcript.
[00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.393]  Who knows if that's even true?
[00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:25.818]  And they admit Flynn did nothing wrong in what they have a transcript of.
[00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:29.580]  But the FBI agent's notes say something different.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.201]  And this Clinton operative, why?
[00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:32.962]  They're God.
[00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:35.564]  Mueller's credibility problem.
[00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:39.707]  The Wall Street Journal gets into that and how they need to end this fake investigation.
[00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:44.270]  But that doesn't stop Morning Show.
[00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.753]  And we have that video coming up.
[00:10:53.177 --> 00:10:53.897]  That's coming up.
[00:10:55.298 --> 00:10:56.319]  Start of the next segment.
[00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:06.932]  Morning Joe, Trump team going to jail for the rest of their lives and the nooses around their neck.
[00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:18.095]  Boy, when Trump tweeted about Psycho Joe and the strange death of the lovely young intern in his offices before he left Congress and how they said she had blunt force trauma, her brains beat out.
[00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:19.996]  They said it was totally natural.
[00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.037]  She must have fallen and hit her head.
[00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:24.319]  Trump said, investigate.
[00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:26.840]  Maybe somebody else knew something.
[00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:35.926]  Their response is, you've got dementia, you're insane, you're a loser, and you're all going to jail for the rest of your lives and the nooses around your neck.
[00:11:37.047 --> 00:11:37.727]  From Mika.
[00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.269]  So, that's coming up.
[00:11:41.363 --> 00:11:48.430]  At the start of the next segment, we're also going to play a very powerful report from Breitbart Radio, where Hannity lays out the truth.
[00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:57.820]  Again, if everybody gets this fact and this talking point, we will remove the Republican establishment, not just the Democrats, and save the country for the next 50 years.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:05.067]  The GOP is a dead party, morally corrupt, weak, ineffective, visionless, with no identity.
[00:12:07.148 --> 00:12:11.893]  Continuing, more anti-Trump messages reportedly sent by members of Mueller's team.
[00:12:13.354 --> 00:12:16.757]  Pence pleads ignorance on Russia probe as it deepens.
[00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:23.864]  Is President Trump's legal team preparing for an imminent obstruction of justice charge?
[00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.005]  Well, absolutely.
[00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:26.166]  That's what the Democrats say.
[00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:31.031]  They've got ready out of their swamp grand jury that would indict a ham sandwich.
[00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:34.712]  Trump's lawyers mount new defense.
[00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:36.572]  A president cannot obstruct justice.
[00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:37.312]  Is that true?
[00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.954]  Well, the courts can't find that.
[00:12:41.454 --> 00:12:48.096]  Congress has to find that with an impeachment in the Congress.
[00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:53.858]  But yes, the president cannot obstruct justice according to a lone court or grand jury.
[00:12:54.218 --> 00:12:58.239]  Or you'd always have rogue courts and rogue grand juries, like what you've got in the swamp.
[00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:02.808]  Shutting the entire nation down.
[00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:08.770]  So you have checks and balances in the co-equal three branches of government, and that's completely clear.
[00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.471]  Alan Dershowitz lays it out, but I don't just believe Alan Dershowitz.
[00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:14.573]  I've gone back to the founding, the Constitution, what's there?
[00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:20.175]  It's up to the voters, and it's up to the Congress, and the states could have a
[00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:32.716]  Emergency Con Con, or the states could recall their Senators previously, if they didn't like how the President was behaving, and order the Senators to find the President guilty.
[00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:42.799]  But with the 17th Amendment in 1913, the same year we got the Federal Reserve Act and the Income Tax, when the real globalist coup began, when they got their beachhead in 1913, 115, 16 years ago, I mean 103, 4 years ago,
[00:13:50.469 --> 00:14:02.292]  They also got the 17th Amendment, where senators were no longer from the state, where the legislature, you elect the legislature, but then the legislature votes on the two U.S.
[00:14:02.332 --> 00:14:08.554]  senators they're going to send, giving the states true veto power over the Congress, and thus the president!
[00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:16.537]  Because if you've got all the senators at the state level, the president goes sideways on you, you can remove him.
[00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:22.527]  The 50 states, back then the 13 original states.
[00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:25.089]  Then as it grew from then on.
[00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:27.590]  You see how beautiful all those checks and balances are?
[00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:34.195]  But you've got to get a majority of those senators to say bye-bye to the president.
[00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:36.712]  But let me tell you, the President does something we don't like.
[00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:38.292]  But he's our President!
[00:14:38.532 --> 00:14:49.176]  If we don't decide to remove him, vote him out, or have the Senate remove him via impeachment, they make the indictment in the House, but then have the trial in the Senate, and they're still due process there.
[00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:53.077]  But that's how you remove the President.
[00:14:53.097 --> 00:14:58.579]  You don't just have some swamp jury created by Mueller, these little babies.
[00:14:59.997 --> 00:15:02.258]  Come out and say the president's this Russian agent.
[00:15:02.598 --> 00:15:04.579]  By the way, you also, as voters, can choose.
[00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.740]  Wow, if he wants to work with the Russians, he can.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.280]  We're not.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.481]  We should be more.
[00:15:10.861 --> 00:15:13.782]  But is the president delivering on jobs?
[00:15:14.202 --> 00:15:14.683]  On the border?
[00:15:15.563 --> 00:15:16.243]  On so many issues?
[00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:16.963]  The answer is yes.
[00:15:17.344 --> 00:15:18.044]  On tax cuts?
[00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:21.022]  Incredible accomplishments.
[00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:23.144]  We're in a revolutionary time.
[00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:26.107]  And we're removing the globalists that have hijacked our country.
[00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:27.428]  That's the revolution.
[00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:34.475]  Just getting the country back is what we are doing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:41.962]  And it's an exciting time to be alive, but the swamp creatures are arrogant and petulant and believe they own you and your family.
[00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:45.085]  And they believe they've broken your will, and they believe you're going to go back to sleep.
[00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:48.453]  The question is, are you going to let them do that?
[00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:52.899]  We're going to break all this down and more in the incredible Big Brother news.
[00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:58.148]  Massive persecution of medical marijuana users are having their guns confiscated.
[00:15:58.168 --> 00:16:01.333]  It's not Trump doing it, it's the 9th Circuit and the Democrats.
[00:16:04.582 --> 00:16:13.912]  In a massive victory for President Trump, the Supreme Court has ruled that the White House's travel ban on individuals from terror-linked countries will go into full effect.
[00:16:14.192 --> 00:16:21.139]  The court granted the administration's request to lift two injunctions imposed by lower courts that had partially blocked the ban.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:27.186]  This decision overrules those lower courts, who many have accused of playing politics by blocking the ban.
[00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:29.948]  This means people seeking to enter the U.S.
[00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:35.612]  from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Chad will now be barred from doing so.
[00:16:36.092 --> 00:16:40.856]  It's a good start, but it remains to be seen if more terror-linked countries will be added to the list.
[00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:43.478]  The travel ban is not a Muslim ban.
[00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:47.561]  Most of the countries with the highest Muslim population are not even on the list.
[00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:52.546]  Seven of the nine Supreme Court justices agreed with President Trump's travel ban.
[00:16:52.786 --> 00:16:59.132]  With the economy soaring and tax cuts on the way, President Trump can now check the travel ban off his Christmas wish list.
[00:16:59.513 --> 00:17:01.295]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[00:17:03.894 --> 00:17:04.635]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:14.241]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:20.025]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:23.147]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:23.347 --> 00:17:32.113]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:39.015]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:42.296]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:53.319]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.099]  It is amazing!
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.481]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:04.675]  Clean, pure drinking water.

[00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:07.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:34.097]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:46.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.723]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.271]  Bottom line, we are witnessing the second American revolution.
[00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:06.073]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect or you're perfect or Trump's perfect or Matt Drudge is perfect.
[00:21:06.173 --> 00:21:18.457]  It means we're trying to restore our republic and get sovereignty of our nation back under our governing control and bring back in the American system of the three branches of government.
[00:21:20.455 --> 00:21:40.267]  But meanwhile, we have powerful, dug-in forces who've been above the law for decades, who've run this country into the ground, who are trying to block the American recovery, and trying to block the return of transferred power that was illegally transferred to multinational corporations and combines back to our country.
[00:21:41.148 --> 00:21:45.971]  On its face, Trump and this revolution of populism
[00:21:48.729 --> 00:21:55.757]  Is the return of our nation's sovereignty and is the very opposite of treason.
[00:21:56.437 --> 00:22:00.942]  It is our duty and it's an amazing action that we're all part of.
[00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:09.191]  Some weak minds out there buy into the Democrats propaganda but not many but the claim that Trump's doing what he's doing for a foreign power
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:30.718]  It's ridiculous when globalism is about foreign multinational corporate and governmental combines of internationalist globalists setting up a new planetary form of government which they now admit they've set up and is authoritarian and they can't believe we finally woke up to it and said no!
[00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:38.821]  They've had the mainstream media since the days of Barry Goldwater, 50 years ago, saying none of this exists, we're not building it, it's not happening.
[00:22:39.482 --> 00:22:40.302]  While they built it.
[00:22:40.882 --> 00:22:51.806]  Now it's here, and all over the world, people are pulling out of the unelected UN, the unelected EU, the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO.
[00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:55.787]  Which is all chaired by a couple hundred of the same people.
[00:22:57.448 --> 00:22:58.868]  Pushing corporate world government.
[00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:03.515]  The New World Order is dead on arrival.
[00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:14.683]  But that doesn't stop Mika Brzezinski, whose father openly wrote multiple books about how he wanted to get rid of American sovereignty and establish a world government.
[00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:26.212]  And then she's up there with Joe Scarborough, who mysteriously left Congress after a young intern was found with her brains beat out in his office.
[00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:29.195]  They claimed she just fell over and hit her head.
[00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:29.655]  Whatever.
[00:23:29.995 --> 00:23:33.717]  Trump has said there should be an investigation of that.
[00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:38.778]  We've got a new accuser against John Conyers said hand up her thigh in church.
[00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:41.099]  Word is that's the end of him.
[00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:50.143]  But the point is Trump simply calling for an investigation of individuals that may be compromised and may be blackmailed for things in their background.
[00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:53.084]  But we have Mika Brzezinski
[00:23:54.625 --> 00:24:08.160]  And we have Joe Scarborough first claiming the president only wants money, when he's lost massive amounts of money in his businesses, in his systems, in his golf courses, in his hotels, since he ran for office three years ago.
[00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.243]  And he spent hundreds of millions of his own money.
[00:24:11.043 --> 00:24:15.548]  Then they claim there's all this Russian evidence, and the noose is closing, and they're all going to jail.
[00:24:16.544 --> 00:24:18.486]  For a very, very long time.
[00:24:19.227 --> 00:24:32.061]  So again, the full video is up on InfoWars.com right now, and it's total fiction from the same swamp monsters that told us that
[00:24:34.565 --> 00:24:39.167]  President Trump had ordered Flynn, when he was a candidate, to go meet with the Russians, which they knew was fake as well.
[00:24:39.488 --> 00:24:50.593]  But they just keep this confidence game going, and going, and going, when they're the ones that are in bed with the Russians on every front, the Democrats, because it's all they've got.
[00:24:51.274 --> 00:24:57.737]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, here is the beginning of the clip where they're breaking all this garbage down.
[00:24:58.867 --> 00:25:04.853]  You know, the campaign, Trump didn't think he was going to win, even on election day.
[00:25:05.453 --> 00:25:07.175]  But it was all about money.
[00:25:07.295 --> 00:25:09.017]  It was all about making contacts.
[00:25:09.037 --> 00:25:12.880]  We've said this before, but I think the most remarkable thing about it is,
[00:25:14.324 --> 00:25:18.485]  That even now that he's president, it's still all about money.
[00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:26.367]  Like, he's not sitting there thinking what Barack Obama or George W. Bush or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan thought.
[00:25:26.387 --> 00:25:28.088]  Like, what is my legacy going to be?
[00:25:28.468 --> 00:25:34.890]  He's thinking every day, how can I leverage this so when I get out of the White House, I can make even more money?
[00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:39.830]  Knowing them, I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:49.178]  Because I don't know if they were arrogant or just incredibly un-self-aware and really dumb about, like, what the job was about.
[00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:53.442]  This is just like all the very same people, including these two clowns.
[00:25:55.402 --> 00:26:09.536]  On television, hundreds of times apiece, saying Trump will never win, he's not really running to win, he's a fraud, Hillary's 15, 20, 30 points ahead, Donald Trump's not going to be the president, just hammering that lie.
[00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:15.762]  Yeah, if he wasn't going to be president, why was he making 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 campaign stops a day?
[00:26:16.687 --> 00:26:21.353]  Why was he screaming and yelling at the crew to work harder and to win, win, win?
[00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:26.218]  Why was he so incredibly committed and not backing down, even when they put out all those lies about him?
[00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:27.640]  He is the president.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.021]  You're a fraud.
[00:26:30.666 --> 00:26:37.331]  And you're the people that have hijacked this country, and Trump's delivered, bringing back the prosperity almost instantly.
[00:26:37.592 --> 00:26:39.954]  So, he's a winner, you're a loser.
[00:26:40.214 --> 00:26:42.476]  He told the truth, you're discredited liars.
[00:26:42.756 --> 00:26:44.457]  Get that through your head, scum.
[00:26:44.677 --> 00:26:45.278]  Let's continue.
[00:26:52.964 --> 00:26:53.745]  There is nothing.
[00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:54.925]  There is no collusion.
[00:26:55.185 --> 00:27:06.712]  They've charged people for stuff they did 10 years ago that wasn't even illegal, or what an FBI agent that worked for Hillary Clinton and covered up for Hillary Clinton said happened in a conversation versus NSA intercept recordings.
[00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:13.877]  On the word of some Clinton FBI agent that he just said something a little different, but they admit it wasn't collusion!
[00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:19.624]  Was talking to the Russians about crushing ISIS, which the National Security Advisor better be doing!
[00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:21.285]  You are lying scum!
[00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:22.246]  Sorry, go back to her.
[00:27:29.795 --> 00:27:30.675]  You're exactly right.
[00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:31.516]  For the rest of their lives.
[00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.638]  This is just like Joy Behar, who we're gonna play again when we come back.
[00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:35.878]  Celebrating.
[00:27:35.918 --> 00:27:36.639]  Yay!
[00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:37.519]  He lied!
[00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:38.580]  Trump's going to jail!
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.480]  He worked with the Russians!
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.441]  They stole the election!
[00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:41.341]  The proof's out!
[00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:42.302]  Flynn admits it!
[00:27:42.542 --> 00:27:43.362]  Fake news!
[00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:44.223]  Con game!
[00:27:44.423 --> 00:27:45.623]  Confidence game, liar!
[00:27:45.883 --> 00:27:46.604]  Trump won!
[00:27:46.684 --> 00:27:47.324]  You lost!
[00:27:47.564 --> 00:27:48.325]  You're scum!
[00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:50.166]  The economy's coming back, scum!
[00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:53.908]  You're not gonna get to ride on our backs anymore and piss on us anymore, Brzezinski!
[00:27:54.128 --> 00:27:55.628]  You and your bloodthirsty father!
[00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:56.529]  Let's go back to her.
[00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:14.548]  What's gotten them where they are right now, Josh, is a gross misunderstanding of the rules of Washington, the laws surrounding public service.
[00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.791]  Oh, the intelligence agencies have seven ways this Sunday to get back at you?
[00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:26.473]  What's happened to them is they waddled into a group of you guys that have hijacked the country and think it's going to go on forever?
[00:28:26.953 --> 00:28:30.074]  Nothing you do will ever put mainstream media back on top.
[00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:33.335]  Nothing you do, Scarborough, no one likes you, everyone hates you.
[00:28:33.475 --> 00:28:38.116]  You got that stupid former RNC head up there on screen with you.
[00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:41.630]  He got caught in a bunch of corruption, that's why he's up there with you.
[00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.332]  The Republican establishment, the Democrat establishment, here's your eviction notice.
[00:28:46.472 --> 00:28:48.453]  Get out of our lives, scum!
[00:28:49.093 --> 00:28:51.515]  I'm gonna come back and finish up with this on the other side.
[00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:52.635]  It makes me so angry.
[00:28:52.895 --> 00:28:53.976]  Oh, the noose is tightening.
[00:28:54.156 --> 00:28:56.337]  You're all going to jail for a very, very long time.
[00:28:56.557 --> 00:28:58.298]  You didn't know the rules of Washington.
[00:28:58.318 --> 00:29:00.879]  You don't know the rules of history, you little cockroach!
[00:29:02.665 --> 00:29:12.107]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[00:29:12.727 --> 00:29:17.368]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[00:29:18.008 --> 00:29:29.351]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:43.643]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[00:29:44.443 --> 00:29:49.588]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[00:29:50.068 --> 00:29:51.529]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat
[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.211]  A lot of protein.
[00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:54.653]  You don't chew it properly.
[00:29:54.714 --> 00:29:55.755]  Sometimes there's buildup.
[00:29:55.775 --> 00:30:00.161]  You can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis, you name it.
[00:30:00.722 --> 00:30:03.085]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[00:30:04.178 --> 00:30:11.663]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[00:30:12.184 --> 00:30:24.152]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:27.014]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[00:30:27.634 --> 00:30:31.617]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[00:30:32.037 --> 00:30:33.879]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:48.169]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:52.192]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:54.614]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[00:30:54.974 --> 00:30:59.777]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[00:31:00.117 --> 00:31:02.999]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.221]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:05.721 --> 00:31:16.028]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:19.351]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[00:31:20.476 --> 00:31:33.260]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[00:31:33.861 --> 00:31:43.044]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[00:31:44.594 --> 00:31:46.336]  This is the total win-win.
[00:31:46.836 --> 00:31:52.541]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[00:31:53.102 --> 00:31:57.506]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[00:31:57.826 --> 00:32:03.331]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[00:32:03.852 --> 00:32:06.935]  Many probiotics out there don't even have
[00:32:07.495 --> 00:32:07.855]  Thank you.
[00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:29.071]  But this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:35.112]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[00:32:35.572 --> 00:32:40.233]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:49.875]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[00:32:50.976 --> 00:32:54.700]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[00:32:54.881 --> 00:33:02.710]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:07.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.555 --> 00:33:21.315]  Big Brother.
[00:33:22.676 --> 00:33:23.936]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:25.177 --> 00:33:26.557]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:28.058 --> 00:33:28.998]  You want answers?
[00:33:29.979 --> 00:33:31.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.859 --> 00:33:38.162]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.248 --> 00:33:46.429]  It is so hard for me to play this clip and not get angry.
[00:33:47.289 --> 00:33:49.950]  Because I know how bad Mika Brzezinski is.
[00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.671]  I know how bad Joe Scarborough are.
[00:33:51.731 --> 00:33:52.891]  I know what liars they are.
[00:33:53.291 --> 00:33:55.212]  What fake news kingpins they are.
[00:33:55.732 --> 00:33:57.713]  What con men and women they are.
[00:33:58.093 --> 00:34:01.794]  Same folks telling you Trump would never win and putting out the fake polls.
[00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:03.335]  I mean they're just such trash.
[00:34:03.895 --> 00:34:11.658]  And now to have them salivating over a noose around Trump's neck and they're all going to prison for the rest of their lives and this whole con game
[00:34:12.498 --> 00:34:26.506]  With a bunch of washed up politicos from both parties all nodding their heads like telling a three-year-old Santa Claus is real and Trump's going to prison because he really did something and he got caught because he didn't know how Washington worked.
[00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:34.311]  He didn't know how to kiss everybody's butt with all these arrogant mummies up there and he just wants money and he's a fake person and he's evil.
[00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:49.201]  While the economy's coming back, while all these good things are happening, we're getting our sovereignty back, so many good things, and here are these sick establishment people that ran the country in the ground, shaking their finger at us, telling us how our champion's evil.
[00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:53.064]  You are gonna lose, filth, and you are enemies of this country.
[00:34:54.906 --> 00:34:58.688]  Now let's go back to the disgusting clip from the beginning, since I interrupted it a bunch.
[00:34:59.048 --> 00:35:07.173]  I'm going to try to give limited interruptions here, because we need to just, for posterity, look at what true sociopathic pieces of trash are.
[00:35:07.513 --> 00:35:12.156]  This is, as Trump calls him, Psycho Joe, and her dad was a famous criminal.
[00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:31.369]  I mean, he talked about how he helped put the Khmer Rouge in that killed millions, and how he, just all the evil things they did, and wrote books about how the elite controls the criminal operations of the planet, and he wants a one-world government, and these are just parasitic filth, and I pray to God today these people are finally completely out of our lives.
[00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.411]  I pray for justice against them.
[00:35:35.693 --> 00:35:37.274]  And I pray for investigations.
[00:35:38.587 --> 00:35:39.947]  I pray for justice.
[00:35:39.967 --> 00:35:42.568]  Now let's play enemies of our family.
[00:35:42.608 --> 00:35:42.988]  Here they are.
[00:35:44.048 --> 00:35:49.810]  You know, the campaign, Trump didn't think he was going to win even on election day.
[00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.310]  But it was all about money.
[00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.171]  It was all about making contacts.
[00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:58.232]  We've said this before, but I think the most remarkable thing about it is
[00:35:59.474 --> 00:36:03.636]  That even now that he's president, it's still all about money.
[00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:11.019]  He's not sitting there thinking what Barack Obama or George W. Bush or Bill Clinton.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:18.923]  Trump went to office at 70, the oldest president ever elected, and spent his own money.
[00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:22.425]  That's never happened before except for George Washington.
[00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:24.799]  We all know what he did.
[00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:25.480]  He was a good guy.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.480]  The founder of the country.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.122]  These people all went into government, then got rich after.
[00:36:30.142 --> 00:36:34.224]  The Clintons, Joe Scarborough, all of them.
[00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:38.266]  And they're sitting there saying about Trump what they've done.
[00:36:39.527 --> 00:36:45.269]  Trump's the American model of the successful person that goes to Washington to fix things, and then leaves.
[00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.250]  Not career swamp creatures.
[00:36:47.451 --> 00:36:50.152]  But here's swamp creatures telling you Trump's a swamp creature.
[00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.271]  He thought, like, what is my legacy going to be?
[00:36:54.652 --> 00:37:01.096]  He's thinking every day, how can I leverage this so I get, when I get out of the White House, I can make even more money?
[00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:01.896]  It's possible.
[00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:02.477]  Knowing that.
[00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:11.383]  He's leveraging this thinking, hey, when I, you know, there's a dead intern in my office and I gotta leave Congress or whatever, how do I leverage this now for 15 years on television spouting disinformation?
[00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:13.964]  Again, everything he's saying is about him.
[00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:17.086]  Everything he's talking about is about him.
[00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:18.567]  Let's continue.
[00:37:20.126 --> 00:37:22.508]  I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:37:22.648 --> 00:37:28.013]  Because I don't know if they were arrogant or just... Actually, Trump thinks it's all a big giant joke and keeps saying collusion.
[00:37:28.374 --> 00:37:29.455]  What collusion is there?
[00:37:29.835 --> 00:37:31.977]  We worked with Russia to crush ISIS, that was all public.
[00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:34.019]  We asked them not to put sanctions on Israel.
[00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:34.659]  Oh, we're so evil.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.401]  And it's all completely transparent.
[00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:37.882]  That's what national security advisors do.
[00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:43.648]  Oh, they are shocked that the entire Clinton apparatus could have
[00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:56.847]  Mueller literally up its rear end with Comey as doing a proctology exam, and they all worship each other, and they're all involved in incredible corruption and collusion with Russia, China, you name it, selling the country out.
[00:37:57.087 --> 00:38:03.514]  They're the globalists trying to kill the recovery, and they turn around and say, those of us that are retaking the country, we're the foreign power?
[00:38:03.754 --> 00:38:04.335]  Yeah, right!
[00:38:04.835 --> 00:38:07.498]  Everything you say about us is what you are!
[00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.759]  You are the enemy!
[00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:11.520]  You are indicted in the public!
[00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:13.522]  You are indicted in front of God!
[00:38:13.902 --> 00:38:16.023]  And nothing you're ever going to do is going to change that trash.
[00:38:16.283 --> 00:38:16.824]  Let's continue.
[00:38:16.864 --> 00:38:18.064]  I'm sorry, I just can't shut up during it.
[00:38:18.565 --> 00:38:25.809]  Incredibly un-self-aware and really dumb about, like, what the job is about.
[00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:29.492]  Incredibly un-self-aware.
[00:38:30.592 --> 00:38:31.212]  Boy, you said it.
[00:38:31.232 --> 00:38:32.193]  Have you seen your ratings?
[00:38:32.754 --> 00:38:34.455]  Have you seen how you have no credibility?
[00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:36.216]  Have you seen how you're known to be fake news?
[00:38:36.456 --> 00:38:39.158]  How you're a laughing stock joke going bankrupt?
[00:38:40.779 --> 00:38:43.941]  Yes, you are incredibly, uh, unselfaware.
[00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:44.442]  Let's continue.
[00:38:44.902 --> 00:38:49.865]  It was, and how under the microscope every move you made would be.
[00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:54.609]  I think they just... I'm gonna start over at the beginning, but I just have to keep doing this because... Start over at the beginning.
[00:38:55.149 --> 00:38:56.150]  This is the anatomy of fraud.
[00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:07.615]  They are in shock that every person that ever had a golf membership or every person that ever bought a condo is being harassed going back down 25 years and they're going back and nothing to do with Russia.
[00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:11.677]  Nothing to do with Russia on anything and they want to put Flynn in jail for working with Turkey.
[00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:13.858]  I mean that's all they've got.
[00:39:15.168 --> 00:39:29.458]  So yes, the incredible witch hunt microscope, and you're so powerful with your little Mueller, who's like your king, your swamp god, your unelected creature that you bet everything on, where he waddles around in public acting powerful.
[00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:31.100]  We're so impressed with you.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.221]  No, America hates the swamp.
[00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:34.542]  They hate the Democrats.
[00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:35.323]  They hate you.
[00:39:35.563 --> 00:39:36.964]  They hate the Republican leadership.
[00:39:37.144 --> 00:39:39.726]  They know you're a fraud, and you're just waking them up.
[00:39:39.886 --> 00:39:42.508]  So keep doing what you're doing, you arrogant tart.
[00:39:43.168 --> 00:39:43.709]  Let's continue.
[00:39:44.709 --> 00:39:50.473]  You know, the campaign, Trump didn't think he was going to win, even on election day.
[00:39:51.314 --> 00:39:53.035]  But it was all about money.
[00:39:53.155 --> 00:39:58.819]  That intern didn't know she was going to go to that office that night and get her brains knocked out.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.642]  I bet she never knew she was going to your offices that day to die, that night.
[00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:09.278]  And if she's looking down from heaven, she probably didn't know how she just fell over and killed herself.
[00:40:09.318 --> 00:40:11.762]  And when the cops were like, she fell over and hit her head and died.
[00:40:11.782 --> 00:40:14.966]  Okay, so she probably didn't know she was going to die either.
[00:40:15.266 --> 00:40:15.646]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:16.888]  Let's start it over.
[00:40:17.028 --> 00:40:18.270]  Well, let's go back to election day.
[00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:25.592]  You know, the campaign... Trump didn't think he was going to win, even on election day.
[00:40:26.193 --> 00:40:27.896]  But it was all about money.
[00:40:28.036 --> 00:40:29.758]  It was all about making contacts.
[00:40:29.778 --> 00:40:33.723]  We've said this before, but the most remarkable thing about it is...
[00:40:34.969 --> 00:40:39.171]  That even now that he's president, it's still all about money.
[00:40:39.751 --> 00:40:47.035]  He's not sitting there thinking what Barack Obama, or George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, or Ronald Reagan thought.
[00:40:47.055 --> 00:40:48.756]  Like, what is my legacy going to be?
[00:40:49.136 --> 00:40:52.197]  He's thinking every day, how can I leverage this?
[00:40:53.498 --> 00:41:00.781]  You know, if there was an intern here, a young female intern who got her brains bashed out one night, you think there'd just be no investigation about it?
[00:41:00.841 --> 00:41:02.942]  Just, oh, she knocked her brains out.
[00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:03.743]  I'm just asking.
[00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:09.135]  Why doesn't Joe even respond to the president bringing that up about him and say, hey, this is a bunch of bull?
[00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:09.856]  I'm sure it is.
[00:41:09.876 --> 00:41:12.359]  I mean, why not talk about the intern?
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.561]  Tell us her name.
[00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:15.503]  Tell her what she had her head on.
[00:41:17.085 --> 00:41:17.365]  Please.
[00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:20.329]  Let's go back to Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Joe.
[00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:21.871]  Here he is.
[00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:23.633]  I can make even more money.
[00:41:24.406 --> 00:41:28.549]  Knowing them, I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:38.518]  Because I don't know if they were arrogant or just incredibly un-self-aware and really dumb about, like, what the job was about and how important it was.
[00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:42.961]  And how, under the microscope, every move you made would be.
[00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:46.884]  I think they just thought they'd go in there and flim-flam and riff through it.
[00:41:46.944 --> 00:41:47.225]  You know?
[00:41:47.245 --> 00:41:49.406]  And I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:41:49.426 --> 00:41:50.868]  They're shocked how the economy wore back and everything.
[00:41:51.648 --> 00:41:52.509]  You're exactly right.
[00:41:52.529 --> 00:41:53.329]  For the rest of their lives.
[00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:54.570]  Well, this is flimflam.
[00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:55.471]  I want some more of it.
[00:41:55.511 --> 00:42:02.175]  What's gotten them where they are right now, Josh, is a gross misunderstanding.
[00:42:02.195 --> 00:42:04.317]  They have a slug creature in league with Russia climbing up their rear-ends.
[00:42:06.036 --> 00:42:24.769]  of the rules of Washington, the laws surrounding public service, and constitutional norms, coupled with the arrogance of New York developers thinking, and I know, I talked to them,
[00:42:26.636 --> 00:42:31.200]  Thinking people in Washington were just dumb local yokels.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:31.620]  Yeah.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.842]  And they just get out of our way.
[00:42:33.882 --> 00:42:35.063]  They don't know how to do that.
[00:42:35.163 --> 00:42:35.443]  Don't wait.
[00:42:35.463 --> 00:42:35.884]  No, no, no.
[00:42:35.924 --> 00:42:36.805]  Listen, listen.
[00:42:37.045 --> 00:42:39.006]  You guys have had your opportunity.
[00:42:39.147 --> 00:42:40.047]  And you guys, come on.
[00:42:40.087 --> 00:42:42.910]  You're just a bunch of hicks in Washington, D.C.
[00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.952]  Let the big city developers come in.
[00:42:46.012 --> 00:42:46.873]  We're going to show you.
[00:42:47.193 --> 00:42:48.695]  They wouldn't listen to anybody.
[00:42:49.535 --> 00:42:56.500]  And they stumbled into one possible crime after another possible crime, and then Donald Trump goes into his mode.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.464]  He thinks taking on Bob Mueller is the same as taking on Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:43:07.987 --> 00:43:09.648]  It's called Pregnanolone.
[00:43:10.749 --> 00:43:16.213]  And I learned about it five years ago, getting a checkup at the doctor, and I noticed they were selling it.
[00:43:17.964 --> 00:43:41.893]  And then I learned, though, that if you take it with multivitamins and the right amino acids and the right minerals in a compound together, and soup it up with beetroot concentrate, that the leading science showed that all of that together gave your body the complete building blocks to produce not just key hormones, but other compounds that come out of your glands.
[00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:44.551]  And it's so game-changing.
[00:43:45.552 --> 00:43:52.294]  I've been taking the Red Pill the last few months, and the amount of energy it gives me, the amount of stamina, the amount of focus.
[00:43:52.694 --> 00:43:57.255]  You can even make claims about what it does for your cardiovascular system, what it does for your brain.
[00:43:57.315 --> 00:44:01.797]  But there's no classic stimulants in the real Red Pill.
[00:44:01.837 --> 00:44:05.378]  So, the real Red Pill, vitamin, minerals, and pregnenolone,
[00:44:06.118 --> 00:44:06.999]  As well as beetroot.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.781]  He is so powerful.
[00:44:08.801 --> 00:44:10.342]  Supports optimal brain function.
[00:44:10.803 --> 00:44:12.024]  Supports hormonal balance.
[00:44:12.084 --> 00:44:13.405]  Supports healthy aging.
[00:44:13.806 --> 00:44:14.246]  By age 20...
[00:44:15.689 --> 00:44:22.354]  Our body stops producing as much pregnant antelope, which again is a neurosteroid precursor.
[00:44:22.394 --> 00:44:24.075]  That's why the Olympic team lets you take it.
[00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:33.502]  That's why all the sporting teams and other organizations let you take it because it's in a steroid class, but it's naturally occurring and is a precursor.
[00:44:33.803 --> 00:44:37.465]  So it's reportedly, you can do your own research, totally and completely safe.
[00:44:38.046 --> 00:44:43.090]  It's the building block that your body has to have to then make all the other hormones.
[00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:53.273]  But then they've got to have the vitamins, they've got to have the minerals, they've got to have the amino acids, and then it's all right there together in the real red pill.
[00:44:53.874 --> 00:44:58.695]  You know, this had another name six months ago when we were having the first samples come in that I began to take.
[00:44:58.715 --> 00:45:03.537]  And I noticed that the pills... Let me open a bottle of this and just show you.
[00:45:06.707 --> 00:45:10.490]  The pills were, depending on the batch, pink or red.
[00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.213]  This particular batch of the beetroot's not that dark, which is barely pink.
[00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.894]  And I thought, a pink pill?
[00:45:15.914 --> 00:45:17.555]  And I go, ooh, Matrix, red pill.
[00:45:18.136 --> 00:45:20.938]  Call it the Real Red Pill.
[00:45:21.338 --> 00:45:24.741]  Now, again, we have a product that is our bestseller.
[00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:28.403]  This doesn't compete with Brain Force that has the green tea extract.
[00:45:29.284 --> 00:45:29.884]  A little bit of it.
[00:45:29.904 --> 00:45:31.706]  And has some of the Aromante in it.
[00:45:32.246 --> 00:45:34.707]  And gives you good, clean, strong pick-me-up.
[00:45:34.747 --> 00:45:36.128]  But that's not even the main reason.
[00:45:36.689 --> 00:45:38.169]  It's got the L-theanine.
[00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:43.353]  It's got a whole bunch of other... Alpha-GPC and other things in it.
[00:45:44.553 --> 00:45:45.294]  Black pepper.
[00:45:46.154 --> 00:45:47.055]  Fruit extract.
[00:45:47.355 --> 00:45:51.377]  And a bunch of other things that are known to give you good, clean energy.
[00:45:51.738 --> 00:45:53.819]  But this does have some healthy stimulants in it.
[00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:56.862]  The Real Red Pill doesn't.
[00:45:57.522 --> 00:46:02.405]  It just has all the building blocks for you to have the hormones and the other things that your body needs.
[00:46:02.665 --> 00:46:07.408]  That's why I'm so excited about Brain Force Plus, which is still 50% off.
[00:46:08.189 --> 00:46:10.770]  That special's about to end because the supplies are about to sell out.
[00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:18.895]  And the Red Pill, the Real Red Pill, out of the gates, ladies and gentlemen, is 50% off.
[00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.676]  It's a powerful multivitamin.
[00:46:20.836 --> 00:46:23.778]  It is a powerful mineral spectrum vitamin.
[00:46:24.378 --> 00:46:30.966]  But what it's really powerful for is that it has the pregnenolone in it and the beetroot and more and all of it together.
[00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:33.850]  Dramatic response is what I personally experienced.
[00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.092]  That's why out of the gates I'm offering 50% off on this.
[00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:46.984]  The reason we're doing that is I want you to try it and see how amazing it is and give us your reviews before it goes back to the regular price.
[00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:48.924]  120 capsules in a nice glass bottle.
[00:46:49.344 --> 00:46:50.645]  Super high quality in your purchase.
[00:46:50.925 --> 00:46:51.965]  Helps fund the operation.
[00:46:52.005 --> 00:46:55.206]  But I'm really impressed with the real red pill.
[00:46:55.586 --> 00:46:58.106]  So I hope you'll get your bottle today and tell us what you think there as well.
[00:47:05.028 --> 00:47:06.728]  To the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:14.662 --> 00:47:19.743]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.406 --> 00:47:41.207]  Well, if there's a queen of fake news,
[00:47:43.482 --> 00:47:56.874]  If there's a collection of harpies, like something out of a Greek tragedy, fighting over the all-seeing eye, then it's got to be The View, and it's got to be led by Joy Behar.
[00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:04.140]  So, coming up, Joy Behar gives a fake apology for the fake news she put out.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.500]  Last week.
[00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:08.323]  So you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:48:08.703 --> 00:48:09.824]  That is coming up in a moment.
[00:48:09.884 --> 00:48:14.288]  But just briefly getting back to what I spent two segments on the morning.
[00:48:14.328 --> 00:48:19.972]  Joe salivating about nooses around Trump's neck and they're all going to jail for the rest of their lives.
[00:48:20.032 --> 00:48:22.654]  And the last part of them time to get to is the break.
[00:48:22.675 --> 00:48:24.516]  They're like the Constitution.
[00:48:24.556 --> 00:48:27.659]  You know, we've got constitutional rules in D.C.
[00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:32.703]  These are the people that sold us out to foreign secret multinational combines.
[00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:44.611]  These are the people that de-industrialized the country, that gave the Panama Canal to the Chi-Coms, flooded open borders, said they wanted to get rid of our sovereignty.
[00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:49.094]  I mean, these people are the plague when it comes to sovereignty and prosperity.
[00:48:49.494 --> 00:49:04.345]  And then they sit there, the daughter of a famous evil wizard, Zbigniew Brzezinski, literally, a political demon who engineered much of the modern New World Order, and then you've got
[00:49:06.024 --> 00:49:13.097]  Morning Joe up there with all his skeletons in his closet and all his bull and all his no ratings and the joke that he is.
[00:49:15.046 --> 00:49:21.151]  Telling us that Trump was arrogant and Trump didn't care about the little people and Trump came into D.C.
[00:49:21.392 --> 00:49:22.813]  like it was flyover country.
[00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:25.395]  See, they know Trump went to flyover country.
[00:49:25.615 --> 00:49:26.917]  He loves flyover country.
[00:49:27.137 --> 00:49:28.578]  He empowered flyover country.
[00:49:28.798 --> 00:49:32.181]  So everything is scientifically, like, say he's against flyover country.
[00:49:32.642 --> 00:49:33.563]  Compare D.C.
[00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:37.866]  to grassroots common people and this big out-of-towner.
[00:49:38.772 --> 00:49:39.512]  That came in.
[00:49:39.792 --> 00:49:41.053]  Big fancy New Yorker.
[00:49:41.533 --> 00:49:44.935]  Trump's family came into New York and kicked butt.
[00:49:45.435 --> 00:49:47.836]  Just like they came into DC and kicked butt.
[00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:52.858]  But again, they take all of Trump's strengths and turn them around into weaknesses.
[00:49:53.158 --> 00:49:57.260]  That's why it takes me so long to go over a collection of garbage like that.
[00:49:58.376 --> 00:50:08.700]  Nika Brzezinski and Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough, are, to take a term from Lord Trump, they are a pile of garbage!
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.501]  You are garbage!
[00:50:12.181 --> 00:50:22.865]  You've had your foot on our neck forever, and now Trump's halfway removed the foot, and we're getting oxygen again, and life's coming back into us, and a bunch of gremlins are running around on the deck of the ship trying to make sure we go under!
[00:50:24.053 --> 00:50:32.439]  So make sure you arrogant narcissists and your con game garbage realize you have failed, you're going to continue to fail, and you will fail!
[00:50:33.039 --> 00:50:33.960]  You are filth!
[00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:42.106]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough are the epitome of the arrogant Washington trash.
[00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:49.633]  That literally hates this country and gets off on it with all the other scum that have hijacked the nation.
[00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:52.155]  You've got to hate a country to want to run it to the ground.
[00:50:52.735 --> 00:50:55.037]  That's why they put people that hate us in charge.
[00:50:55.337 --> 00:50:57.799]  It's not like there's that many people that hate America in the U.S.
[00:50:58.039 --> 00:51:01.782]  You've just got to be one of these people to be in the power structure.
[00:51:02.823 --> 00:51:03.243]  Well, guess what?
[00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:04.424]  We don't want a power structure.
[00:51:04.444 --> 00:51:09.088]  We want the country to be strong and the planet to be strong and you parasites will be removed.
[00:51:10.094 --> 00:51:12.776]  They're both like horrible foot-long tapeworms, man.
[00:51:12.816 --> 00:51:13.257]  I'm telling you.
[00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:19.983]  Tapeworms that we've vomited out and crapped out and they're just trying to force-feed themselves back into our lives.
[00:51:21.784 --> 00:51:23.726]  They're like gonorrhea or syphilis.
[00:51:23.806 --> 00:51:26.709]  I mean, they are just... They're like HIV.
[00:51:26.729 --> 00:51:27.649]  They're like cancer.
[00:51:27.689 --> 00:51:33.134]  They are just... I mean, you have to understand, folks, they literally want to destroy you.
[00:51:33.695 --> 00:51:33.895]  Okay?
[00:51:37.662 --> 00:51:38.583]  God, they're evil!
[00:51:38.803 --> 00:51:41.587]  I mean, do you realize how evil these people are?
[00:51:42.268 --> 00:51:43.049]  How committed?
[00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:45.712]  I know folks going behind the scenes, man.
[00:51:45.752 --> 00:51:46.112]  They are.
[00:51:46.212 --> 00:51:47.294]  She is so rude.
[00:51:47.654 --> 00:51:50.618]  And I've talked to four different people that have been guests on the show.
[00:51:52.455 --> 00:52:02.600]  And they tell me, rock stars, you name it, that behind the scenes, she treats her employees like, they're just like, she just tells the people, this coffee didn't have what I wanted, I'll have you fired, you moron, idiot.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.241]  And then Scarborough shakes at her, she goes, get over there!
[00:52:05.502 --> 00:52:07.523]  Yes ma'am, I mean, I mean, you know what?
[00:52:07.603 --> 00:52:10.644]  I think I'm gonna make contact with some of those folks and get the full dope on you guys.
[00:52:11.004 --> 00:52:13.586]  I know people that have been at dinner parties with them, and it's the same.
[00:52:13.666 --> 00:52:17.828]  She is just so evil, and so into herself, like her evil father, that she just sits there and just goes,
[00:52:20.369 --> 00:52:26.073]  I mean, she just... And that's the spirit!
[00:52:27.154 --> 00:52:28.855]  They're like from Upside Down World, folks.
[00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:30.956]  You understand, they've broken into this dimension.
[00:52:31.156 --> 00:52:32.157]  They want to destroy us.
[00:52:33.077 --> 00:52:34.538]  She thinks she's better than everybody.
[00:52:34.838 --> 00:52:39.821]  She's so hyper-mentally ill-dominant that she's just completely cuckoo.
[00:52:40.962 --> 00:52:41.282]  Alright.
[00:52:42.623 --> 00:52:45.265]  Coming up, though, the Harpy Joy Behar
[00:52:47.105 --> 00:52:50.207]  This is a fake apology for the fake news she put out last week.
[00:52:50.227 --> 00:52:55.109]  But first, if you want to wage war against the globalist, Infowarstore.com.
[00:52:55.509 --> 00:53:04.614]  They can't stand the fact that you fund us, they can't stand the fact that they've tried to destroy us, but you've supported us and gotten great products in exchange, a total 360 win-win-win-win-win.
[00:53:05.194 --> 00:53:08.856]  And so, we've got 33% off our flagship product, DNA Force.
[00:53:08.896 --> 00:53:09.876]  Read all the studies, the facts.
[00:53:10.236 --> 00:53:13.478]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, great for adults, even better for children with the amino acids.
[00:53:13.838 --> 00:53:15.099]  All the key minerals and key
[00:53:16.124 --> 00:53:17.424]  Vitamins absorbed.
[00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:25.886]  50% off on all of the Super Blue fluoride-free fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[00:53:26.707 --> 00:53:27.887]  We have it for children and adults.
[00:53:28.087 --> 00:53:31.348]  And the Super Blue mouthwash as well as the Emrix.
[00:53:32.128 --> 00:53:32.408]  50% off.
[00:53:32.448 --> 00:53:33.568]  Those are the new specials.
[00:53:33.868 --> 00:53:35.429]  And they're going to have to end very soon.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.002]  Because the supplies of Vitamin Mineral Fusion are running low.
[00:53:41.022 --> 00:53:42.942]  We've got plenty of the toothpaste.
[00:53:43.183 --> 00:53:45.203]  We have the new Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[00:53:45.503 --> 00:53:46.884]  We're getting our first reviews there.
[00:53:46.964 --> 00:53:48.124]  Five star reviews.
[00:53:48.164 --> 00:53:48.845]  Super high quality.
[00:53:48.865 --> 00:53:53.166]  The amazing bioavailability is just key.
[00:53:53.467 --> 00:53:55.427]  Emrix Essential Oils and so much more.
[00:53:55.808 --> 00:53:59.089]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:06.411]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I sound extreme because I am extreme.
[00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:11.192]  The globalists are literally out to destroy us and I'm not going quietly into the night.
[00:54:11.232 --> 00:54:11.832]  What about you?
[00:54:12.132 --> 00:54:17.594]  By the way, former congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us coming up for the first 20 minutes of the next hour.
[00:54:18.094 --> 00:54:22.835]  Then I intend to get back into the news and open the phones up and take your phone calls.
[00:54:23.236 --> 00:54:31.218]  Ahead of the former technical director of the National Security Agency, William Binney will be joining us to talk about all the illegal spying on Trump.
[00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:34.666]  Which they tried to deny they'd done, but now they're using in court.
[00:54:35.466 --> 00:54:37.026]  Which, there's no crimes there.
[00:54:37.867 --> 00:54:42.428]  They just have transcripts saying they're not exactly how you answered this FBI agent who wrote notes.
[00:54:42.808 --> 00:54:55.212]  They're acting like the notes from an FBI agent, who just got removed for covering up for Hillary, is the Word of God, given on Mount Sinai to Moses, as the fiery finger of the Lord wrote into the stone.
[00:54:56.212 --> 00:54:57.173]  Marbled tablets.
[00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:01.929]  Marble tablets of Mueller.
[00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.331]  Mueller.
[00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:05.251]  Mueller.
[00:55:05.792 --> 00:55:15.760]  What a disgusting group of insane swamp creatures who thought you'd steal the election, and thought you'd steal the nomination, and thought you did steal it from Bernie, and think you'll steal everything.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:28.190]  You've been stealing our future, and siphoning our money off, and screwing us over, and brainwashing us, and trying to demoralize us, and attacking our families, and trying to disease us with all your vaccines and GMOs, but finally we're awake!
[00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:36.112]  And those stunned, and in some cases, crawling on our knees, we're still mountains above you with our consciousness.
[00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:41.694]  So, Joy Behar's coming up, and then I'm gonna get to Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:55:42.275 --> 00:55:46.236]  He'll be joining us from his studios in Houston.
[00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:53.439]  You can always watch at InfoWars.com forward slash show, but whatever you do, spread the word about the local affiliate that you're listening to.
[00:55:53.459 --> 00:55:56.961]  And we have a new thing, too, that is the highest level of rewards points
[00:55:58.237 --> 00:56:02.978]  You get 5% for every dollar you spend with Patriot Points at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:56:03.218 --> 00:56:05.539]  This has been wildly popular since we launched it a week ago.
[00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:06.659]  I haven't even plugged it.
[00:56:07.479 --> 00:56:12.061]  And you've got Patriot Points that are right there in your account at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:56:12.361 --> 00:56:20.163]  And by the way, we've launched a new, big, massive website that's been, oh, a year in the making, filled with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:56:21.414 --> 00:56:33.283]  of products that are not sold on the other site, and that's FortifiedSupply.com, a survival and camping store, an exclusive InfoWars life reseller.
[00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:43.611]  And just like I carry storable foods and then have the lowest price because I'm a reseller of those, it lets me contractually get around map agreements, and I'm not doing it unscrupulously, they know I'm doing it.
[00:56:44.707 --> 00:56:55.856]  Same thing here, setting up a subsidiary to be able to sell you camping supplies and survival gear and things through a subsidiary of another company so we can give you even lower prices.
[00:56:56.557 --> 00:57:03.262]  And we've still got some of the sales that were last week on InfoWareStore.com exclusively at FortifiedSupply.com.
[00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:06.545]  Brain Force is still 50% off there.
[00:57:06.565 --> 00:57:09.668]  Colloidal Silver is still 67% off there.
[00:57:09.688 --> 00:57:14.413]  So you've got those sales, amongst many others, at FortifySupply.com.
[00:57:15.274 --> 00:57:17.676]  Again, a division of our overall operations.
[00:57:18.357 --> 00:57:25.343]  And then we've separately, but a separate deal, and then we've got also again at MForceLife.com and MForceStore.com.
[00:57:25.644 --> 00:57:26.324]  DNA Force 33% off.
[00:57:27.245 --> 00:57:36.511]  And we have the toothpaste 50% off, and the vitamin refuser 50% off, and the funding absolutely makes the Bubbles pull their stinking, degenerate, murdering vampire hair out.
[00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:38.492]  Hey, psychic vampires, get ready!
[00:57:38.512 --> 00:57:43.336]  Because we're coming for you, and we don't get weaker when we take you out, we get stronger.

[00:57:52.369 --> 00:58:01.811]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?

[00:58:21.954 --> 00:58:22.114]  Woo!
[00:58:22.174 --> 00:58:23.075]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:58:23.195 --> 00:58:31.800]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:41.166]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:59:54.609 --> 01:00:00.513]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:13.947]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:00:14.328 --> 01:00:18.294]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.842]  And I'll take you live, my friends.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:34.366]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:37.728]  And I know we've got foreign multinationals that have hijacked our country.
[01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:41.230]  I know they want to bankrupt us, to make us poor, to politically control us.
[01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:42.171]  It's in all their documents.
[01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:51.317]  And I'm aware they've got a bunch of hired mercenaries that have a shared hatred of this republic, and especially Christians in a flyover country that want to use divide and conquer to hurt us.
[01:00:52.057 --> 01:01:03.607]  Now, the queen of fake news, Joy Behar, harped the lies that General Flynn had been ordered to meet illegally and secretly with the Russians when candidate Trump was only a candidate.
[01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:12.796]  Again, saying that Trump was a liar and then it was all over, the gotcha Perry Mason moment where they catch, you know, the criminal with the kids tied up in the basement.
[01:01:13.567 --> 01:01:18.608]  It was all a hoax from the hoax factory, that is ABC News and the rest of these people.
[01:01:19.269 --> 01:01:28.231]  But boy, she celebrated, but it took her until this morning to finally come out and do a retraction, but that was a fake retraction and wasn't wholehearted.
[01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:34.733]  But let's go back into the memory hole of time and see her on Friday having a disgusting celebration.
[01:01:35.033 --> 01:01:35.353]  Woo!
[01:01:35.413 --> 01:01:35.873]  Come on!
[01:01:36.633 --> 01:01:37.053]  Woo!
[01:01:37.413 --> 01:01:37.974]  Yeah!
[01:01:38.754 --> 01:01:39.334]  Alright!
[01:01:39.414 --> 01:01:41.695]  Yeah, that's quite a celebration Joy Behar's having.
[01:01:41.715 --> 01:01:42.615]  Let's go ahead and roll that tape.
[01:01:43.607 --> 01:01:44.327]  He said that to himself.
[01:01:44.387 --> 01:01:44.907]  Breaking news.
[01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:45.828]  Oh my god.
[01:01:46.428 --> 01:01:47.308]  Oh, breaking news.
[01:01:47.488 --> 01:02:00.071]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:00.271]  Yes!
[01:02:05.712 --> 01:02:06.233]  You were right, yeah!
[01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.914]  We're going to screw this company over.
[01:02:09.954 --> 01:02:11.734]  We're going to blow up their recovery.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.362]  Go teach style, Rick Hendry!
[01:02:19.585 --> 01:02:19.986]  Yeah!
[01:02:20.146 --> 01:02:20.787]  Ha ha!
[01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:24.473]  Now, here is her half-ass retraction.
[01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:27.898]  Also from the same fake news program.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.320]  Here she is.
[01:02:30.154 --> 01:02:34.037]  So on Friday's show, apparently I was guilty of premature evaluation.
[01:02:34.057 --> 01:02:37.320]  I hear they have a pill for that now.
[01:02:37.701 --> 01:02:38.962]  Here's what happened.
[01:02:39.082 --> 01:02:46.548]  ABC News reporter Brian Ross released a story claiming that when Trump was a candidate, he told Michael Flynn to contact the Russians.
[01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:50.872]  Ross later corrected himself, saying it was actually when Trump was president-elect.
[01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:53.694]  Now, Brian has been suspended for a month.
[01:02:54.475 --> 01:02:56.717]  And Sunny, you have a statement from ABC News.
[01:02:56.757 --> 01:02:57.358]  Let's hear that.
[01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:58.679]  Yes, ABC News says,
[01:03:13.472 --> 01:03:17.955]  Ultimately, we determined the information was wrong and we corrected the mistake on air and online.
[01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:22.518]  It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience.
[01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.659]  These are our core principles.
[01:03:25.159 --> 01:03:27.080]  We fell far short of that yesterday.
[01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:31.083]  Effective immediately, Brian Ross will be suspended for four weeks without pay.
[01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:33.984]  Okay, that's ABC's statement.
[01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:37.645]  Brian Ross has released a statement also on Sunday.
[01:03:37.685 --> 01:03:43.906]  He said, my job is to hold people accountable, and that's what I agree with, being held accountable myself.
[01:03:43.946 --> 01:03:47.527]  And that's why I agree with being held accountable myself.
[01:03:47.647 --> 01:03:54.449]  So he has basically, I mean, I would say that this is a, people are slamming this as fake news, but to me it's a mistake.
[01:03:54.529 --> 01:03:58.410]  It's not, it's not, he didn't deliberately put out a false piece of information.
[01:03:58.590 --> 01:03:59.430]  He made an error.
[01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:06.644]  It was a significant error, though, and I think journalists have to be, given the climate, very, very careful with their reporting.
[01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:12.396]  So that blew up in their face really, really nicely, didn't it?
[01:04:12.496 --> 01:04:17.620]  But now you've got all these other politicians coming out and saying that it's very dangerous.
[01:04:18.161 --> 01:04:20.063]  Trump is being very, very mean to the press.
[01:04:20.964 --> 01:04:23.326]  Tom Hanks, it concerns me how much Trump attacks the press.
[01:04:23.646 --> 01:04:31.894]  They attack him ten times more viciously, saying kill him, kill his family, he's a fraud, he's mentally ill, he's retarded, on and on and on.
[01:04:33.055 --> 01:04:35.257]  And I'm sick of it, so I'm going to be aggressive.
[01:04:35.877 --> 01:04:39.580]  You can say what you want about the president, he's not perfect, but he's trying to be the American president.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.041]  He's trying to restore the republic.
[01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:49.767]  We're going to talk to former congressman and medical doctor Ron Paul, coming up to get his take on the state of the world, North Korea, and so much more, straight ahead.
[01:04:49.867 --> 01:04:55.291]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:04:55.712 --> 01:04:58.274]  Come on, come on, come on up, baby!
[01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:13.906]  Peter Sturzik was the top FBI official assigned to Mueller's special counsel.
[01:05:13.966 --> 01:05:22.011]  For nearly four months, it's been kept secret that the FBI agent exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary Clinton text messages with his mistress.
[01:05:33.899 --> 01:05:34.459]  I think so.
[01:06:20.669 --> 01:06:29.776]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go to former Congressman Ron Paul to look at North Korea and the biggest military drills in history ahead of a possible strike.
[01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:30.916]  I hope that's not the case.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.521]  I hope everything can be peaches and cream.
[01:06:38.882 --> 01:06:39.863]  That's what Ron Paul wants.
[01:06:39.903 --> 01:06:43.566]  Get back to our republic, be peaceful, trade with people, work with people.
[01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:46.306]  And turn this world around.
[01:06:46.686 --> 01:06:50.828]  Go away from authoritarianism and collectivism to individualism.
[01:06:50.888 --> 01:06:56.710]  So, the omnibudsman of the global movement to awaken humanity is Ron Paul.
[01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:59.671]  And he doesn't like to be complimented, but it's important to see where we've come.
[01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:04.033]  Running for president twice in the last decade or so.
[01:07:04.373 --> 01:07:06.114]  Very successfully waking people up.
[01:07:07.114 --> 01:07:09.115]  Challenging the cultural Marxism on the colleges.
[01:07:09.855 --> 01:07:14.961]  Building the modern Tea Party movement that the Republicans thought they hijacked, but really they brought in our Trojan horse.
[01:07:15.842 --> 01:07:17.203]  We've now gotten Trump elected.
[01:07:17.403 --> 01:07:22.449]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, but he's trying to be the American president, getting us out of the TPP, doing other things.
[01:07:22.529 --> 01:07:26.193]  I want to get, as a historian, Dr. Ron Paul's take on
[01:07:27.816 --> 01:07:36.262]  Where we are and where he thinks we're going, what he thinks is going to happen with the Russia investigation and the fact that the Democrats are in bed with the Russians saying Trump is.
[01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:42.286]  But I also want to first get into critical things he wants to say about Trump, which I know is the whole North Korea situation.
[01:07:42.306 --> 01:07:52.212]  A lot of people have noticed that, you know, we publish Ron Paul's articles on Infowars.com and put links to his different TV, radio shows and Ron Paul Institute.
[01:07:52.492 --> 01:07:55.094]  And then we also have some articles that are more hawkish about North Korea.
[01:07:55.374 --> 01:07:57.296]  We're just showing both perspectives.
[01:07:58.156 --> 01:07:58.717]  I don't think so.
[01:08:19.831 --> 01:08:26.173]  I think it could cause serious civil unrest and really a culture war that's already been cold could get hot.
[01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:30.735]  And we got about a two second delay for some reason always with our system and his, but that's okay.
[01:08:30.775 --> 01:08:32.176]  That's why you'll hear a pause.
[01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:38.798]  So Dr. Paul, thank you so much for joining us from the Liberty Report Studios.
[01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:44.363]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:45.304]  Nice to be with you.
[01:08:45.324 --> 01:08:47.805]  Well, please just go ahead and jump right in.
[01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:50.046]  You heard me throw up that cornucopia in the last two minutes.
[01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:51.147]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:57.591]  Well, there's so many.
[01:08:58.211 --> 01:09:10.578]  I think the country is in a big mess, and though I'm optimistic on the long run because I think the philosophy of liberty and libertarianism is on the move and making great strides, but more
[01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:12.619]  Intellectually than politically.
[01:09:13.159 --> 01:09:19.084]  The politics of this country is a mess and it's epitomized by what's going on between Republicans and Democrats.
[01:09:19.704 --> 01:09:23.327]  And quite frankly I don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.
[01:09:23.387 --> 01:09:26.989]  They fight and argue who has the power and who can control things.
[01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:34.695]  But they're really in bed together when it comes to big government spending and the Federal Reserve and the foreign policy of policing the world.
[01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:36.236]  So they're all the same.
[01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:37.877]  But I think the big thing
[01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:45.125]  That we have to face up to, and why they can't get tax bills passed very easily, and if they do, they don't do much, and the spending bills.
[01:09:45.445 --> 01:09:49.009]  It's because we're flat-out broke, and we have too much debt, and they don't deal with it.
[01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:57.821]  The seriousness of our problems, I don't think there's a way out, but we have to change the philosophy of the country.
[01:09:58.181 --> 01:10:00.725]  And that's what my goal is, to change people's attitudes.
[01:10:00.785 --> 01:10:09.376]  Right now, there's a large number of people who would like to see the changes, a lot of frustration out there, but there's still a lot of people.
[01:10:09.696 --> 01:10:18.420]  Totally dependent on the welfare system and on the warfare and this policing of the world and the military industrial complex and they are very powerful.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.722]  They are the deep state and they have a lot to say about what's going on.
[01:10:25.123 --> 01:10:30.985]  So even though we hear this noise in Washington, unfortunately the deep state is our biggest enemy.
[01:10:32.986 --> 01:10:34.747]  Let's get into Trump.
[01:10:35.595 --> 01:10:38.997]  He's working really well with Senator Paul, your son, right now.
[01:10:39.317 --> 01:10:40.558]  He's trying to get the tax cuts.
[01:10:40.738 --> 01:10:42.679]  He's trying to stabilize the country.
[01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:46.522]  I understand it's a bubble, but it's an American bubble to get us out of the globalist bubble.
[01:10:47.002 --> 01:10:50.424]  They want it to implode so they can derail our nationalistic moves.
[01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:51.845]  I know Trump's not perfect, but
[01:10:52.265 --> 01:10:55.646]  Compared to Hillary Clinton, he's trying to return sovereignty.
[01:10:55.926 --> 01:10:57.226]  The globalists hate his guts.
[01:10:57.346 --> 01:11:00.647]  All over the world, there are movements for countries to self-determine.
[01:11:00.867 --> 01:11:09.950]  Whether I totally agree with leaders in Italy, or leaders in Austria, or leaders in the UK like Nigel Farage, at least they're trying to bring home rule back to the nation-state.
[01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:13.310]  And that's why, existentially, I'm supporting Trump so hard.
[01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:18.892]  I mean, what's it like for you to be exposing world government for 40 years, sir, and now to see it being admitted
[01:11:19.232 --> 01:11:21.175]  And the Federal Reserve being a problem being admitted.
[01:11:21.336 --> 01:11:29.029]  There's got to be some satisfaction there, but separately can you speak then just the overall battle we're seeing between nationalism and globalism?
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.241]  Well, I'd feel better if our policies really did change.
[01:11:36.321 --> 01:11:39.242]  I mean, the appointments to the Federal Reserve, that won't help us.
[01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:43.324]  I don't think that the foreign policy has changed.
[01:11:43.364 --> 01:11:46.005]  We're still sending more troops overseas.
[01:11:46.525 --> 01:11:51.947]  And right now, you know, they're talking about major changes in the Middle East, which is going to
[01:11:52.327 --> 01:11:52.927]  I think so.
[01:12:12.658 --> 01:12:13.679]  And we don't need that.
[01:12:13.719 --> 01:12:14.780]  It's been going on for too long.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.900]  We need to stay out of that.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.841]  We can't afford it.
[01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:22.705]  And besides, I think if you want to compare things, Saudi Arabia is a mess.
[01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:31.992]  Why we get on the moral high ground of supporting them and then think that we have to go to war against Iran, that's a serious thing.
[01:12:32.052 --> 01:12:39.337]  So I haven't seen a reversal in our involvement overseas and a lot of noise is going on on why we have to
[01:12:39.697 --> 01:12:42.498]  Be prepared, next week we may invade North Korea.
[01:12:42.678 --> 01:12:43.978]  I think that's very dangerous.
[01:12:44.518 --> 01:12:46.238]  Well yeah, North Korea certainly.
[01:12:46.598 --> 01:12:49.539]  That could trigger a larger nuclear war with China and Russia.
[01:12:49.559 --> 01:12:51.860]  And I'm not pushing for a war.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.821]  I mean, you've broken down ways to de-escalate North Korea.
[01:12:56.861 --> 01:13:02.342]  But at the same time, North Korea and their communist regime, they certainly bear some of the responsibility as well.
[01:13:03.502 --> 01:13:03.782]  Don't they?
[01:13:07.226 --> 01:13:09.268]  Of course they do, but they're nothing.
[01:13:09.308 --> 01:13:09.989]  They're zero.
[01:13:10.029 --> 01:13:15.453]  You know that whole thing about that missile they shot the other day and the news media carried it like crazy.
[01:13:15.853 --> 01:13:18.535]  Now they can reach the United States with a nuclear weapon.
[01:13:18.756 --> 01:13:19.636]  Well that was a fizzle.
[01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:20.337]  It went up there.
[01:13:20.377 --> 01:13:21.218]  It didn't re-entry.
[01:13:21.258 --> 01:13:25.921]  They don't have an ability for those weapons to re-enter the atmosphere and it blew up up there.
[01:13:26.162 --> 01:13:27.763]  But you never heard anything about that.
[01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:33.407]  So I think it's way blown out of proportion to what North Korea can do.
[01:13:33.768 --> 01:13:35.930]  South Korea is a lot less
[01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:36.810]  Yes.
[01:13:53.507 --> 01:13:53.827]  Yes.
[01:14:11.294 --> 01:14:13.796]  You know, under Truman, going in, who started it?
[01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:14.837]  The U.N.
[01:14:15.098 --> 01:14:16.339]  We listen to the U.N.
[01:14:16.639 --> 01:14:19.181]  And now we still go to them for resolutions and all.
[01:14:19.482 --> 01:14:22.604]  If we were working in our own self-interest, I'll tell you what we would do.
[01:14:22.945 --> 01:14:26.368]  We'd have an explanation to South Korea and say, you go talk to them.
[01:14:26.388 --> 01:14:27.169]  They're your neighbors.
[01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:28.650]  Let Japan help you if necessary.
[01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:29.831]  But we're coming home.
[01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:32.734]  Now that would be an American first policy.
[01:14:33.254 --> 01:14:40.600]  Well, I know Jimmy Carter tried to do a peace deal, but then the Clintons transferred weapon systems, the ability for them to create the uranium.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:48.467]  So, I mean, I would all be about trying to help the North Korean people, but I wonder why the globalist interests in the last 25 years have helped arm North Korea.
[01:14:48.787 --> 01:14:54.092]  I mean, the word is they want to use it as a strategic tension in the peninsula, an excuse for U.S.
[01:14:54.132 --> 01:14:55.153]  forces to stay in the area.
[01:14:59.915 --> 01:15:12.747]  Yeah, you know, when they deal with Carter and Clinton, you know, there's a difference between intervention and then helping them.
[01:15:13.047 --> 01:15:15.729]  I've argued that we offer only two types of intervention.
[01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.272]  We'll intervene and they do what we tell them, which some of them don't like.
[01:15:20.013 --> 01:15:21.114]  North Koreans don't like it.
[01:15:21.635 --> 01:15:25.138]  Or if not, we're going to threaten you with violence or we're going to drop bombs on you.
[01:15:25.498 --> 01:15:30.982]  Why don't we just say, non-interventionism, neither give them help, nor bomb them.
[01:15:31.182 --> 01:15:34.925]  And this whole thing, these sanctions, they don't work.
[01:15:35.085 --> 01:15:38.847]  Look at the foolishness on how we dealt with Cuba.
[01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:47.193]  And now we're still, I mean, right now this administration wants to undo a little more open policy with the Cuban people.
[01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:53.438]  And they're no more close to the Marxist philosophy, now they're much closer to the way they used to be.
[01:15:54.278 --> 01:15:55.899]  Former Congressman Ron Paul, we've got to go to break.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.081]  We'll come right back and I'll ask you more about that.
[01:15:58.161 --> 01:16:01.484]  Would you be an envoy if Trump wanted you to go to North Korea?
[01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:06.328]  But here's an article from The Sun, Warehouse of Horrors.
[01:16:06.368 --> 01:16:11.853]  Now, do you ever wonder when you get a package from Amazon, say you order a pen and it comes in a box this big?
[01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:13.935]  Why do they do that?
[01:16:13.975 --> 01:16:15.376]  They're wasting trees, you say that.
[01:16:15.396 --> 01:16:16.196]  They're wasting trees.
[01:16:17.197 --> 01:16:19.960]  These poor... Hey, at least they have a job, though.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:27.382]  These staff at these processing plants for Amazon have to process 300 packages an hour.
[01:16:27.822 --> 01:16:31.563]  So a young man went in and did a sting operation on them, saw people sleeping on their feet.
[01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.964]  One worker had to be taken to a hospital by an ambulance.
[01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:40.165]  They show all these images, staff have to walk 10 miles a day.
[01:16:41.872 --> 01:16:45.097]  One staff member asked bosses, why are we not allowed to sit when it is quiet and not busy?
[01:16:45.277 --> 01:16:47.661]  We are human beings, not slaves and animals.
[01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:49.583]  Why am I talking about that?
[01:16:49.864 --> 01:16:53.089]  Because when you order from Amazon, you continue this process.
[01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.091]  Let's go to Venice from Chicago.
[01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:58.420]  I'm not trying to soak up a lot of your time.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.361]  I understand y'all doing this broadcast.
[01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:01.722]  I watch all of it.
[01:17:01.762 --> 01:17:02.423]  Me and my wife.
[01:17:02.843 --> 01:17:06.746]  I love the fact that y'all have that toothpaste.
[01:17:06.786 --> 01:17:08.047]  We buy it in bulk.
[01:17:08.507 --> 01:17:12.710]  I really wish that y'all would like really throw in like a family pack type deal.
[01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:13.871]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:15.672]  With the mouthwash and whatnot.
[01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:16.593]  So you know what I'm saying?
[01:17:16.613 --> 01:17:18.895]  We can just buy the whole bulk item.
[01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:20.536]  And we had the fire pack up right now.
[01:17:21.943 --> 01:17:28.387]  Yeah, and I just want y'all to, the kids love bubble gum.
[01:17:29.168 --> 01:17:30.488]  I prefer the peppermint.
[01:17:30.568 --> 01:17:33.170]  Yeah, so do I. The mouthwash is incredible.
[01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:35.311]  It's incredible.
[01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:38.633]  I hate that it's, I'm not gonna lie, I hate that it's in a small amount.
[01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:39.254]  Yeah.
[01:17:39.274 --> 01:17:42.596]  You only get about, you know, you only get a couple of flushes.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.121]  Couple flushes, let's keep it all the way neat.
[01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:46.682]  You know, let's keep it all the way neat.
[01:17:47.242 --> 01:17:52.924]  Everybody knows what it is, you know, but at the same token, you have great products.
[01:17:53.385 --> 01:17:54.025]  You have it.
[01:17:54.945 --> 01:18:05.990]  And I know that I can't go anywhere else to get these products because I can look on your labels versus anybody else's labels and I can know and read the ingredients that's on them.
[01:18:07.211 --> 01:18:11.413]  And if you want to take it a step further, thank you for your Patriot Seed
[01:18:12.549 --> 01:18:13.410]  Oh my god.
[01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.072]  I have started an indoor garden.
[01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:16.552]  Nice.
[01:18:16.813 --> 01:18:18.154]  Everybody must know this.
[01:18:18.254 --> 01:18:18.494]  Yeah.
[01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:24.599]  You can start an indoor garden in your house with Alex Jones seeds from InfoWard.
[01:18:24.619 --> 01:18:24.859]  Yep.
[01:18:25.099 --> 01:18:25.960]  And it'll be organic.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:26.981]  These are good seeds.
[01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:27.801]  They're heirloom seeds.
[01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:29.322]  It's the way to go.
[01:18:30.359 --> 01:18:33.381]  You know, I appreciate your call, Vinny.
[01:18:33.421 --> 01:18:34.942]  I appreciate your support.
[01:18:35.202 --> 01:18:36.823]  And I'm glad you guys are using the toothpaste.
[01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:37.403]  It's great stuff.
[01:18:37.784 --> 01:18:42.146]  I also use Silver Bullet as a mouthwash if I'm traveling.
[01:18:42.687 --> 01:18:45.508]  I'll just swish a little bit of that all through.
[01:18:46.529 --> 01:18:49.631]  And I've been using Silver as a mouthwash like that.
[01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:57.801]  Since 2003, when I bought my first colloidal silver generator, which no longer works.
[01:18:57.941 --> 01:19:02.183]  But yeah, that's the silver bullet to me is one of our best, one of our best products.
[01:19:02.203 --> 01:19:02.484]  4.9 stars.
[01:19:02.564 --> 01:19:03.144]  That's amazing.
[01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:10.571]  That's amazing, and you can check that over and over again on our products.
[01:19:11.272 --> 01:19:10.571]  4.9, 4.8.
[01:19:11.652 --> 01:19:21.162]  I mean, people like our stuff, and they continue to buy it, and it funds what we do, and we're building more studios, we're gonna hire more people, we're gonna keep expanding.
[01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:23.544]  And we did it all because of you.
[01:19:23.604 --> 01:19:24.784]  That's the only way we're able to do it.
[01:19:24.824 --> 01:19:28.645]  We got two new studios that are freaking amazing.
[01:19:28.705 --> 01:19:32.587]  This new podcast studio is gonna give Joe Rogan a run for his money.
[01:19:33.347 --> 01:19:34.987]  It looks fantastic.
[01:19:35.347 --> 01:19:40.409]  And then we have an even bigger, if you thought this studio was big, we've got one twice the size right over there.
[01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.130]  Right over there.
[01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.150]  And it's all because of you.
[01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.291]  It's all because you spread the links.
[01:19:46.209 --> 01:19:50.533]  You get the products, you use the products, you give great reviews for them.
[01:19:51.313 --> 01:19:52.094]  Thank you for your support.
[01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.255]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:05.025 --> 01:20:07.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:31.143]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:38.726]  And coming to us live from Houston, the studios of Phonoscope, former Congressman
[01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:40.559]  Medical doctor.
[01:20:40.819 --> 01:20:41.539]  Great patriot.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:42.520]  Ron Paul.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.981]  You've got the Ron Paul Institute.
[01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:45.723]  Great place to visit as well.
[01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:47.765]  There's the Liberty Report and so much more.
[01:20:47.805 --> 01:20:50.387]  Well, in the nine minutes we have left, I want to cut right to the chase.
[01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.348]  Finishing up on North Korea.
[01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:59.895]  If Donald Trump wanted to send you as an envoy, a peace envoy instead of Jimmy Carter, to North Korea, would you go A, B,
[01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.757]  Any other points on that escalation?
[01:21:03.777 --> 01:21:07.659]  You've been writing a lot about how you think we should de-escalate this.
[01:21:07.699 --> 01:21:11.901]  And then separately, I want to then get into the Russian witch hunt.
[01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:14.162]  The Clintons in bed with the Russians.
[01:21:14.362 --> 01:21:17.803]  Mueller investigating back 20 years now on Trump.
[01:21:19.024 --> 01:21:19.664]  Just the...
[01:21:21.596 --> 01:21:28.460]  The establishment so desperate right now to try to defeat this political realignment towards populism.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.303]  Can you first speak to North Korea and then what you think about the whole Russia gate?
[01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:41.948]  I mean, I've seen John McCain on the Senate floor say that Senator Rand Paul is a Russian agent, that Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent, that I'm a Russian agent.
[01:21:41.968 --> 01:21:43.089]  They're having hearings, sir.
[01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:51.955]  Saying I need to be censored because I'm a Russian with zero proof, no due process, and then Google, Facebook, and Twitter are beginning to censor, sir.
[01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:57.459]  So, so, again, North Korea and then just the whole Russiagate situation at Ron Paul.
[01:22:01.937 --> 01:22:08.444]  Well, as far as going to North Korea and if he asked me to do that, first thing is that the odds of that happening are pretty slim.
[01:22:08.825 --> 01:22:19.957]  The second reaction would be if there's an honest attempt to try to have better relations and work out some problems with North Korea, yeah, I'd be delighted to participate.
[01:22:20.598 --> 01:22:29.087]  But the big problem would be that my ideas about North Korea contradict how we're treating North Korea now.
[01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:32.931]  Actually, I think the treatment with North Korea has gotten much worse.
[01:22:33.352 --> 01:22:34.753]  It's been bad all along.
[01:22:34.893 --> 01:22:39.178]  I mean, we've always had this conflict and nothing ever gets approved.
[01:22:39.198 --> 01:22:41.420]  Sure, but you could be the carrot.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.561]  What I would prefer...
[01:22:43.675 --> 01:22:57.185]  What I would prefer is if he were serious about me going to do that, let me write a one-page memo and tell him what I think needs to be done and it wouldn't involve the United States as much as the people around them.
[01:22:57.225 --> 01:23:03.230]  South Korea being involved, Japan being involved, Russia being involved, China being involved.
[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:11.676]  Maybe they ought to get together and talk about this and get over it and that we're backing off because that's in much greater interest than in ours.
[01:23:12.717 --> 01:23:13.337]  Thank you.
[01:23:28.405 --> 01:23:29.405]  Stranger things have happened.
[01:23:29.425 --> 01:23:30.727]  I think you'd be better than Jimmy Carter.
[01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:34.350]  He's offered, you could bring up from a libertarian perspective, the carrot.
[01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:39.474]  So I'm just throwing it out there and I know that Senator Paul and of course the President talk all the time.
[01:23:39.675 --> 01:23:42.978]  We could send Senator Rand Paul.
[01:23:43.178 --> 01:23:44.699]  I think he'd be a great envoy.
[01:23:50.004 --> 01:23:51.025]  I wouldn't argue with that.
[01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:55.299]  We've got about a two-second delay here with Ron Paul.
[01:23:55.439 --> 01:23:59.602]  It's great to visit his main site, RonPaulInstitute.org.
[01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:03.845]  In the five minutes we have left, sir, let's get into Russiagate.
[01:24:04.286 --> 01:24:10.190]  Let's get into that situation because, I mean, I've been looking at it and there's just nothing there.
[01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:16.636]  And now they've indicted Flynn off some FBI agent's notes, who it turns out worked for Hillary and exonerated that.
[01:24:17.256 --> 01:24:20.379]  And it just gets crazier and crazier to see an unelected group
[01:24:20.999 --> 01:24:24.482]  Running mad dog, trying to overthrow an elected president.
[01:24:24.502 --> 01:24:28.745]  I don't think the nation could survive it if they actually try to indict him and impeach him.
[01:24:29.045 --> 01:24:30.726]  Trump's just too popular with the base.
[01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:34.649]  What is your overall take on Russiagate and all the rest of this?
[01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:42.051]  I agree with your frustration, because it doesn't make any sense.
[01:24:42.412 --> 01:24:47.819]  But I'm frustrated because our Justice Department doesn't do anything.
[01:24:47.839 --> 01:24:51.043]  The Republicans are in charge.
[01:24:51.403 --> 01:24:52.264]  They have the office.
[01:24:54.046 --> 01:24:56.049]  What happened to this investigation of Hillary?
[01:24:56.289 --> 01:25:00.055]  You hear bits and pieces of it, but all you hear is about the investigation of Trump.
[01:25:00.415 --> 01:25:07.205]  He's supposed to be the president and how did we ever allow a guy like Mueller get in charge of this?
[01:25:10.569 --> 01:25:15.972]  Justice Department is not doing the job and it's just totally out of control.
[01:25:16.313 --> 01:25:25.498]  So I don't know who really is in charge, but right now I don't think this administration has prevented this from happening because it can't be.
[01:25:25.518 --> 01:25:26.819]  I think it's all
[01:25:27.599 --> 01:25:28.500]  Uh, build up.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.502]  It's all fiction on what they're accusing.
[01:25:31.522 --> 01:25:37.885]  And I've been on receiving this, and too, because I've been on RT, and they think that this is just horrible.
[01:25:38.185 --> 01:25:50.533]  But quite frankly, RT has treated libertarians a little bit more respectful than our own television companies because, you know, they don't want to hear libertarianism and non-interventionism.
[01:25:51.493 --> 01:25:52.153]  Well, exactly.
[01:25:52.193 --> 01:25:54.794]  I mean, if you were an ombud in North Korea, it doesn't mean you're a North Korean.
[01:25:54.814 --> 01:25:57.336]  If you go on Japanese TV, you're not in league with the Japanese.
[01:25:57.356 --> 01:26:01.557]  If you go on British television, now you've been on British, I've been on British hundreds of times.
[01:26:01.577 --> 01:26:02.678]  It doesn't mean I work for the Brits.
[01:26:02.978 --> 01:26:04.179]  It's the same craziness.
[01:26:04.199 --> 01:26:06.319]  And again, back to the censorship.
[01:26:06.339 --> 01:26:08.440]  I mean, they admit massive censorship now.
[01:26:08.861 --> 01:26:10.361]  The telecoms are engaged in it.
[01:26:10.881 --> 01:26:16.104]  The big internet companies are doing it, mainly on libertarians and conservatives and yours truly.
[01:26:16.564 --> 01:26:18.425]  And they're using the Russia excuse
[01:26:19.085 --> 01:26:23.826]  With no evidence, saying we can censor InfoWars because they work with the Russians.
[01:26:23.866 --> 01:26:25.047]  And of course, they've talked about you.
[01:26:25.087 --> 01:26:29.988]  They said, oh, look at the Russian stooge, Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:31.988]  I mean, this is a real witch hunt.
[01:26:32.468 --> 01:26:33.249]  A real witch hunt, sir.
[01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:42.031]  We had some break up there in the video.
[01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:46.672]  Ron Paul, what do we do about this witch hunt, the massive censorship?
[01:26:50.899 --> 01:26:54.041]  All right, that happens even with satellite, but this is an internet feed we've got.
[01:26:54.061 --> 01:26:55.402]  They've got their own internet feed.
[01:26:55.442 --> 01:26:59.225]  We're going to try to work on that and see if his internet comes back here in a moment.
[01:26:59.265 --> 01:27:04.769]  But that's pretty big info that Ron Paul would travel over there as an envoy, or he thinks Rand Paul would be a great idea.
[01:27:04.789 --> 01:27:05.510]  I mean, I want peace.
[01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:07.271]  I don't want nuclear war.
[01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:10.233]  And also the censorship, the massive censorship.
[01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:11.914]  We have the former congressman back.
[01:27:11.934 --> 01:27:13.295]  Just in the minute and a half we have left, sir.
[01:27:13.315 --> 01:27:19.800]  What about all the massive censorship we're seeing against pro-American voices claiming we're Russian agents?
[01:27:21.715 --> 01:27:22.715]  What's your view on that, please?
[01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:25.397]  Okay, we did lose him.
[01:27:25.457 --> 01:27:32.840]  Well, we're going to get him back on soon and work on those problems that are ongoing and they're not on our end.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.202]  But I'm just glad he's doing a daily radio and TV show and very, very exciting.
[01:27:37.242 --> 01:27:38.003]  You know, the Internet's weird.
[01:27:38.963 --> 01:27:42.185]  Feeds will work from one connection to another, but sometimes we try to connect to somebody else.
[01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:43.956]  Just doesn't work.
[01:27:43.977 --> 01:27:47.379]  But boy, that was some really, really important news and information.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:53.985]  And we just love the modern science of being able to digitally connect to somebody and be able to do.
[01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:55.542]  I don't know.
[01:28:15.797 --> 01:28:28.980]  And then we've got a bunch of Middle East news that ties into the globalist invasion of Europe using Islam that is absolutely critical that we're going to be breaking down in great detail on the other side of this quick break as well.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:36.362]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the main sites.
[01:28:36.902 --> 01:28:43.464]  Again, it is an act of resistance against the censors when you spread the articles and the videos to everyone you know.
[01:28:44.204 --> 01:28:53.087]  And so please know that you're more powerful, have a much bigger effect than you know when you spread the videos, the articles, and the information from InfoWars.com.
[01:28:53.447 --> 01:28:59.969]  Okay, get ready, because I've got a ton to cover on the other side as the Second American Revolution rolls forward!
[01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:06.711]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:29:31.462 --> 01:29:41.606]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:29:41.766 --> 01:29:48.269]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:51.251]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:54.812]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[01:29:55.113 --> 01:30:00.035]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.115 --> 01:30:02.016]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:02.256 --> 01:30:11.285]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:19.592]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:19.773 --> 01:30:24.437]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:24.617 --> 01:30:31.339]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:31.419 --> 01:30:38.500]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.462]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:45.622 --> 01:30:49.963]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:50.103 --> 01:30:53.324]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:30:53.484 --> 01:30:59.648]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:30:59.768 --> 01:31:01.469]  Available at Infowarslive.com.
[01:31:02.269 --> 01:31:05.791]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:12.295]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:31:12.535 --> 01:31:15.497]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:15.877 --> 01:31:18.859]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:31:19.079 --> 01:31:22.522]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:31:22.863 --> 01:31:24.604]  The left controls culture.
[01:31:24.644 --> 01:31:25.605]  They control arts.
[01:31:25.685 --> 01:31:26.907]  They control entertainment.
[01:31:27.207 --> 01:31:34.294]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:31:34.354 --> 01:31:36.756]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:31:37.237 --> 01:31:41.100]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.222]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:31:43.843 --> 01:31:49.204]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:31:49.465 --> 01:31:55.726]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:31:55.786 --> 01:31:57.487]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:31:57.647 --> 01:31:58.827]  It's available right now.
[01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:01.348]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:08.043]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:32:08.844 --> 01:32:11.786]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:32:12.446 --> 01:32:15.248]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:32:15.869 --> 01:32:20.752]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:32:21.112 --> 01:32:27.416]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:32.940]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:37.021]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:45.423]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:32:46.003 --> 01:32:50.324]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:32:50.684 --> 01:32:54.605]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[01:32:54.905 --> 01:32:58.726]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[01:32:58.966 --> 01:33:00.847]  Available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:33:04.508 --> 01:33:18.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:29.563]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:42.072]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.132 --> 01:33:45.015]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:48.878 --> 01:33:52.501]  Trump informs Israel of intention to move U.S.
[01:33:52.581 --> 01:33:57.485]  Embassy to Jerusalem, something he promised to do throughout the campaign.
[01:33:57.525 --> 01:34:07.534]  Now whether you agree with that or disagree with that or have concerns about that, as many people on all sides do, that's Trump again doing exactly what he said he would do or trying to do it.
[01:34:10.805 --> 01:34:22.851]  And so, right now, we have got just absolutely massive examples of Trump delivering on his promises, and we're going to get to that coming up.
[01:34:23.731 --> 01:34:29.774]  And it ties in with the whole Islamic invasion of Europe as well, and the whole coddling of radical Islam.
[01:34:31.237 --> 01:34:38.823]  But the first thing I'm going to get to here is UK acid attacks on the rise, but the media won't say it's Islamic.
[01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:48.751]  Just like truck attacks or anything, they call it fake news to say it's Islamic because they play this Obama-era game where they say Islam doesn't stand for that.
[01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:55.576]  And so if you're saying that, or you're doing that, it must not be true.
[01:34:57.421 --> 01:35:01.364]  So again, it's semantical games that they're playing.
[01:35:01.384 --> 01:35:07.510]  So we'll get into the situation with Israel and its capital and so much more.
[01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:10.492]  And then a whole slew of stories that tie to that in a moment.
[01:35:10.512 --> 01:35:11.173]  But here's the report.
[01:35:13.081 --> 01:35:13.281]  I'm good.
[01:35:29.929 --> 01:35:33.833]  But Parliament MPs are far more outraged that a U.S.
[01:35:33.933 --> 01:35:45.585]  President would bring attention to the plight of the United Kingdom, deeming Trump's tweets highlighting the Britain First videos that documented abuses by Islamic extremists as racist.
[01:35:46.025 --> 01:36:00.378]  When I think of Muslim children in Newcastle waking up to find themselves being attacked by the president of the most powerful nation on earth, because that is how it will appear to them, then my heart bleeds.
[01:36:00.978 --> 01:36:05.302]  However, the 45th president is not accountable to the children of Newcastle.
[01:36:05.322 --> 01:36:08.665]  It's hard to see to whom he does hold himself accountable.
[01:36:09.145 --> 01:36:10.907]  But the social media giants are.
[01:36:11.187 --> 01:36:18.871]  I don't even know where to start at the idea of the President of the United States retweeting the videos of this despicable organisation that seeks to promote hatred.
[01:36:31.258 --> 01:36:32.218]  I don't know where to start.
[01:36:32.399 --> 01:36:34.821]  But, you know, for Theresa May, she's done quite well so far.
[01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:39.965]  But, you know, she needs to learn the lesson from this, which is you cannot be friends with this man.
[01:36:40.526 --> 01:36:42.808]  And his views and his values are not ours.
[01:36:43.228 --> 01:36:50.315]  Yes, we work around him and we work with other Americans because, of course, we don't leave America behind because, of course, they're our valued ally.
[01:36:50.755 --> 01:36:51.316]  But not him.
[01:36:51.816 --> 01:36:52.097]  Not him.
[01:36:53.476 --> 01:37:16.505]  We would also call on the government to make clear that in no way and at no time does it give any support whatsoever to the distasteful views of the 45th President on race and migration and our Muslim communities internationally.
[01:37:17.105 --> 01:37:19.346]  Because to do anything else
[01:37:22.148 --> 01:37:45.406]  The most important action that we can take to stop the promulgation of the type of hate crime that has been promoted by Britain First and is promoted by other extreme right-wing groups is to make sure that we work with the major internet companies to get more action taken.
[01:37:45.747 --> 01:37:47.908]  On the issue of radical Islam,
[01:37:49.409 --> 01:37:58.633]  British Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding people who have themselves been the subject of acts and the victims of acts of terror by the far right.
[01:37:59.053 --> 01:38:08.437]  I think the United States have got it wrong and to be very clear with them and I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain first was the wrong thing to do.
[01:38:08.717 --> 01:38:11.639]  British Prime Minister Theresa May added to the outrage.
[01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:22.605]  As PBS reported, May's spokesman James Slack said Britain First seeks to divide communities through its use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions.
[01:38:22.785 --> 01:38:25.807]  He said, it is wrong for the president to have done this.
[01:38:25.947 --> 01:38:33.472]  This begs the question, how can a video documenting the actual event in reality be spun to the masses as a lie?
[01:38:33.672 --> 01:38:38.955]  President Trump has now postponed his scheduled trip in early 2018 to open the new U.S.
[01:38:39.075 --> 01:38:39.936]  Embassy in England.
[01:38:40.176 --> 01:38:48.661]  It's no secret that England is losing its identity, and the English plan to handle mass immigration has been a total disaster.
[01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:51.843]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:38:53.324 --> 01:38:55.806]  And that is Veritas, as they say, the truth.
[01:38:57.031 --> 01:39:01.633]  Now, Trump has informed Israel, he's informed the Palestinian leaders, Abbas, Jordans, Abdullah.
[01:39:02.213 --> 01:39:03.213]  He intends to move the U.S.
[01:39:03.293 --> 01:39:08.896]  Embassy to Jerusalem sometime in the next six months, but they haven't given the supposed date.
[01:39:09.616 --> 01:39:12.137]  And here's the entire giant Islamic world.
[01:39:13.996 --> 01:39:26.942]  All the way from Indonesia to Central Africa, invading country after country, flooding Europe, not assimilating in many cases, bullying other Muslims to be radical, or claiming that they're heretics.
[01:39:27.963 --> 01:39:41.529]  I mean, if you had Christians running around in 10th century garb ordering me not to read books on mathematics or I'm a witch, I'd say you're a cult and you're crazy, get away from me.
[01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:44.721]  And we need the reforation of Islam.
[01:39:44.781 --> 01:39:45.582]  It has to happen.
[01:39:45.902 --> 01:39:48.202]  There's a billion, five hundred million Muslims.
[01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.843]  They're about to go to three billion by the end of the next decade.
[01:39:53.583 --> 01:39:55.184]  We're not going to give up our identity.
[01:39:55.224 --> 01:39:56.604]  We're not going to give up our Christianity.
[01:39:56.724 --> 01:40:00.885]  A large enough minority of us aren't going to do it, globalist UN.
[01:40:02.425 --> 01:40:10.727]  And you've got churches all over the US, all over Europe, all over, you name it, pulling down crosses, pulling down images of Christ,
[01:40:14.332 --> 01:40:16.234]  The Red Cross is doing it across Europe.
[01:40:17.895 --> 01:40:18.756]  The Methodist Church.
[01:40:19.456 --> 01:40:20.677]  Aaron Austin's pulled it down.
[01:40:22.619 --> 01:40:32.007]  Because we're supposed to conform to this new global system and accept everybody else's religion, and they think Christians are so compliant, we'll do it first.
[01:40:33.548 --> 01:40:36.130]  This is admitted formulaic targeting.
[01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:41.955]  Then they play this intellectual game where they go, nobody's trying to take your free speech when that's all they're doing.
[01:40:43.615 --> 01:40:45.256]  I have a stack of news on it here today.
[01:40:46.376 --> 01:40:50.057]  Belgian Red Cross orders crucifix removed from its buildings.
[01:40:51.318 --> 01:40:52.458]  Paid for by Christians.
[01:40:54.879 --> 01:40:57.740]  Going back 1,600 years ago.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.141]  Officially established with the Hospitallers, what?
[01:41:01.161 --> 01:41:02.582]  700, 800 years ago.
[01:41:05.265 --> 01:41:09.706]  In Jerusalem, strangely enough, is where the Red Cross and all of it comes from.
[01:41:10.166 --> 01:41:13.567]  Belgian Red Cross orders crucifixes removed from its buildings.
[01:41:15.228 --> 01:41:18.009]  Saying that it's not culturally sensitive to be Christian.
[01:41:18.129 --> 01:41:19.809]  So Christians pay for it, they build it.
[01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:22.250]  All the groups get taken over.
[01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:23.630]  The seminaries get taken over.
[01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:25.191]  All the groups get taken over.
[01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:29.352]  The EU is saying you can't have nationalistic names for your football teams.
[01:41:29.592 --> 01:41:30.812]  They're saying they've got to change those.
[01:41:31.172 --> 01:41:33.173]  You've got to give up all of your culture.
[01:41:36.013 --> 01:41:42.656]  Swedish government to ban websites that list ethnic origin of criminal suspects and arrest people.
[01:41:42.676 --> 01:41:50.519]  This is the government announcing this that talk about the Muslim rape gangs.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.081]  This is out of Fox News.
[01:41:55.281 --> 01:42:01.343]  Ergun, that's the dictator of Turkey, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a red line for Muslims.
[01:42:01.604 --> 01:42:04.445]  Hey, we know everybody who isn't a Muslim is a red line for you.
[01:42:04.505 --> 01:42:04.925]  We got it.
[01:42:05.762 --> 01:42:06.503]  We got it, okay?
[01:42:06.703 --> 01:42:09.906]  And then you're all blowing each other up constantly, fighting over who's in charge.
[01:42:10.086 --> 01:42:13.249]  You can't build a civilization now because you're always in power struggles.
[01:42:13.269 --> 01:42:13.669]  We got it.
[01:42:17.493 --> 01:42:22.457]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.522]  I can't move to Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:32.166]  I can't move to most of these Muslim countries.
[01:42:35.236 --> 01:42:37.517]  Now, Conyers has announced he is retiring.
[01:42:38.578 --> 01:42:40.659]  They were saying he was this morning, now it's been announced.
[01:42:41.159 --> 01:42:44.941]  So we have that clip coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:45.001 --> 01:42:47.002]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:42:47.062 --> 01:42:54.066]  But the globalists have looked at the demographics of Islam, 3 billion people soon, and they've made the decision to sell us out to it.
[01:42:54.466 --> 01:42:56.127]  Do you understand?
[01:42:56.787 --> 01:42:57.148]  Period.
[01:42:57.608 --> 01:43:01.330]  That's why I'm harping on Muslims all the time, because they have now been the chosen weapon.
[01:43:07.788 --> 01:43:09.429]  It's called Pregnanolone.
[01:43:10.529 --> 01:43:15.991]  And I learned about it five years ago, getting a checkup at the doctor, and I noticed that they were selling it.
[01:43:17.771 --> 01:43:36.338]  And then I learned, though, that if you take it with multivitamins and the right amino acids and the right minerals in a compound together, and soup it up with beetroot concentrate, that the leading science showed that all of that together gave your body the complete building blocks to produce
[01:43:37.935 --> 01:43:41.717]  Not just key hormones, but other compounds that come out of your glands.
[01:43:43.038 --> 01:43:44.359]  And it's so game-changing.
[01:43:45.359 --> 01:43:52.103]  I've been taking the Red Pill the last few months, and the amount of energy it gives me, the amount of stamina, the amount of focus.
[01:43:52.503 --> 01:43:57.066]  You can even make claims about what it does for your cardiovascular system, what it does for your brain.
[01:43:57.126 --> 01:44:01.609]  But there's no classic stimulants in the real Red Pill.
[01:44:01.649 --> 01:44:05.191]  So, the real Red Pill, vitamin, minerals, and pregnenolone,
[01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:06.813]  As well as beetroot.
[01:44:07.414 --> 01:44:13.227]  He is so powerful, supports optimal brain function, supports hormonal balance, supports healthy aging.
[01:44:13.628 --> 01:44:14.069]  By age 20...
[01:44:15.501 --> 01:44:22.146]  Our body stops producing as much pregnenolone, which again is a neurosteroid precursor.
[01:44:22.186 --> 01:44:23.827]  That's why the Olympic team lets you take it.
[01:44:23.847 --> 01:44:33.294]  That's why all the sporting teams and other organizations let you take it because it's in a steroid class, but it's naturally occurring and is a precursor.
[01:44:33.615 --> 01:44:37.257]  So it's reportedly, you can do your own research, totally and completely safe.
[01:44:37.858 --> 01:44:42.882]  It's the building block that your body has to have to then make all the other hormones.
[01:44:43.382 --> 01:44:53.094]  But then they've got to have the vitamins, they've got to have the minerals, they've got to have the amino acids, and then it's all right there together in the real red pill.
[01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:58.500]  You know, this had another name six months ago when we were having the first samples come in that I began to take.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.366]  And I noticed that the pills... Let me open a bottle of this to show you.
[01:45:06.508 --> 01:45:10.311]  The pills were, depending on the batch, pink or red.
[01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:14.014]  This particular batch of the beetroot's not that dark, which is barely pink.
[01:45:14.034 --> 01:45:15.715]  And I thought, a pink pill?
[01:45:15.775 --> 01:45:17.356]  I go, ooh, Matrix, red pill.
[01:45:17.957 --> 01:45:20.739]  Call it the Real Red Pill.
[01:45:21.139 --> 01:45:24.522]  Now, again, we have a product that is our best seller.
[01:45:24.582 --> 01:45:28.205]  This doesn't compete with Brain Force that has the green tea extract.
[01:45:29.102 --> 01:45:29.722]  A little bit of it.
[01:45:29.822 --> 01:45:31.523]  And has some of the Aromante in it.
[01:45:32.063 --> 01:45:34.505]  And gives you good, clean, strong pick-me-up.
[01:45:34.545 --> 01:45:35.925]  But that's not even the main reason.
[01:45:36.486 --> 01:45:37.966]  It's got the L-theanine.
[01:45:38.106 --> 01:45:43.149]  It's got a whole bunch of other... Alpha-GPC and other things in it.
[01:45:44.349 --> 01:45:45.090]  Black pepper.
[01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:46.871]  Fruit extract.
[01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:51.173]  And a bunch of other things that are known to give you good, clean energy.
[01:45:51.533 --> 01:45:53.614]  But this does have some healthy stimulants in it.
[01:45:55.233 --> 01:45:56.654]  The Real Red Pill doesn't.
[01:45:57.334 --> 01:46:02.197]  It just has all the building blocks for you to have the hormones and the other things that your body needs.
[01:46:02.477 --> 01:46:07.200]  That's why I'm so excited about Brain Force Plus, which is still 50% off.
[01:46:07.981 --> 01:46:10.562]  The special's about to end because the supplies are about to sell out.
[01:46:11.042 --> 01:46:18.687]  And the Red Pill, the Real Red Pill, out of the gates, ladies and gentlemen, is 50% off.
[01:46:19.027 --> 01:46:20.488]  It's a powerful multivitamin.
[01:46:20.648 --> 01:46:23.570]  It is a powerful mineral spectrum vitamin.
[01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:30.781]  But what it's really powerful for is that it has the pregnenolone in it, and the beetroot, and more, and all of it together.
[01:46:30.981 --> 01:46:33.666]  Dramatic response is what I've personally experienced.
[01:46:33.946 --> 01:46:35.910]  And that's why out of the gates I'm offering 50% off on this.
[01:46:38.154 --> 01:46:46.260]  The reason we're doing that is I want you to try it and see how amazing it is and give us your reviews before it goes back to the regular price.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.741]  120 capsules in a nice glass bottle.
[01:46:49.142 --> 01:46:50.443]  Super high quality in your purchase.
[01:46:50.723 --> 01:46:51.784]  Helps fund the operation.
[01:46:51.804 --> 01:46:55.026]  But I'm really impressed with the real red pill.
[01:46:55.386 --> 01:46:57.888]  So I hope you'll get your bottle today and tell us what you think there as well.
[01:47:04.991 --> 01:47:07.622]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.222 --> 01:47:31.186]  Well, my friends, John Conyers just last week said he'd never resign.
[01:47:31.666 --> 01:47:33.528]  Nancy Pelosi called him an icon.
[01:47:34.208 --> 01:47:44.917]  Yeah, he's an icon of arrogance, an icon of sleazy establishment scum, and the mummies that infest Congress.
[01:47:45.862 --> 01:47:46.402]  I am retiring today.
[01:48:16.295 --> 01:48:21.797]  And I want everyone to know how much I appreciate the support.
[01:48:22.677 --> 01:48:29.060]  And I want you to know that my legacy will continue through my children.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:41.945]  I have a great family here, and especially in my oldest boy, John Conyers III.
[01:48:43.615 --> 01:48:49.543]  Who, incidentally, I endorse to replace me in my seat in Congress.
[01:48:52.367 --> 01:48:54.730]  What a disgusting, disgusting establishment.
[01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:59.857]  Remember George Herbert Walker Bush reportedly grabbing the actress's rear end, too, during a photo shoot?
[01:49:01.317 --> 01:49:02.517]  It just goes on and on.
[01:49:02.898 --> 01:49:04.418]  It's total entitlement.
[01:49:04.798 --> 01:49:14.502]  These are sociopathic, psychopathic, narcissistic, just power trip people that just think they're God and think they're invincible and think they can do whatever they want.
[01:49:15.022 --> 01:49:17.383]  And then they lie and lie and lie and lie and lie.
[01:49:17.703 --> 01:49:25.785]  And it turns out almost all the people paid out in Congress for sexual harassment have been Democrats because only they can get away with it.
[01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:29.047]  Republicans doing that stuff get removed from office and they should be.
[01:49:29.727 --> 01:49:30.067]  But again,
[01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:43.661]  The media keeps conflating somebody hitting on someone they work with, or a woman just in the street, as tantamount to Kevin Spacey grabbing men's genitals and trying to rape people.
[01:49:44.422 --> 01:49:50.927]  Or men raping women, or Harvey Weinstein raping women in front of his chauffeur with the car doors locked.
[01:49:52.448 --> 01:49:59.194]  Notice all that rape stuff, and the pedophile stuff that we told you was coming, and it did come, that's out of the news now.
[01:50:00.717 --> 01:50:15.023]  And everything instead is all about just men in general being pigs and toxic masculinity and, you know, all the white people are racist and all the men are pigs and, you know, pretty soon there's nobody that's good.
[01:50:15.103 --> 01:50:24.248]  Oh, and now Google and Facebook and others are banning women calling men pigs or scum.
[01:50:24.548 --> 01:50:25.588]  That's in the news today.
[01:50:26.909 --> 01:50:29.310]  Facebook's banning women for calling men scum.
[01:50:30.345 --> 01:50:43.348]  See, first you take the Nazis' free speech, and then suddenly you take the radical Muslims' free speech, then you take the Libertarians' free speech, and then you take the men's free speech, and then you take the white people's free speech, and then you take the women's speech, and soon no one has any speech.
[01:50:43.848 --> 01:50:44.969]  They maneuver you.
[01:50:45.009 --> 01:50:51.130]  Authoritarians always maneuver you into, let's just censor one little group over here.
[01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:58.312]  And everybody agrees, yeah, that's a minority group we don't like, you know, Nazis or whoever they are.
[01:50:59.409 --> 01:51:03.151]  And then, pretty soon, it's everybody.
[01:51:04.692 --> 01:51:07.794]  But that's how they get you to go after one group, and then another group.
[01:51:07.834 --> 01:51:11.917]  And first they came for the trade unionists, and I wasn't a trade unionist, so I didn't stand out.
[01:51:11.937 --> 01:51:22.544]  And they came for the communists, and I wasn't a communist, so... And then I wasn't at Lutheran, so they didn't... And then pretty soon they'd come for me, but there was nobody left when they finally came for me.
[01:51:24.258 --> 01:51:31.321]  And that's why when they were celebrating Dinesh D'Souza arrested for making a film against Hillary, I said, this is dangerous whether I agree with him or not.
[01:51:31.681 --> 01:51:46.568]  I wouldn't want Michael Moore to be arrested for his speech, even though I disagree with Michael Moore, but that's the dangerous road we're going down where you can't call Harvey Weinstein scum.
[01:51:49.053 --> 01:51:54.140]  Remember some of the women that it's now been confirmed he sexually abused and sexually assaulted and pretty much raped?
[01:51:55.461 --> 01:51:56.763]  Women he's made settlements with?
[01:51:57.003 --> 01:51:58.345]  They come out and talk about it online?
[01:51:59.707 --> 01:52:00.708]  They ban him on Twitter?
[01:52:01.409 --> 01:52:02.450]  Harvey Weinstein raped me!
[01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.731]  Boom!
[01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:03.231]  You're banned!
[01:52:03.652 --> 01:52:05.855]  Even though it's admitted he settled with that woman!
[01:52:08.584 --> 01:52:25.151]  And Weinstein's got an army of lawyers and intelligence agents and P.I.s out harassing the women and just hoping now the whole thing goes away as they smokescreen off into all these other men that ask women out.
[01:52:27.352 --> 01:52:29.293]  So in battle, John Conyers.
[01:52:30.053 --> 01:52:30.534]  Step down.
[01:52:31.554 --> 01:52:37.737]  I've told you a lot about microwave-directed energy weapons and particle beams and things like that.
[01:52:38.991 --> 01:52:45.213]  Well now, Raquel Thelen, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, very important article, folks, to get out to people.
[01:52:45.553 --> 01:52:53.054]  White House briefed on microwave weapons during a meeting on North Korea, and these are non-invasive systems.
[01:52:53.074 --> 01:52:59.696]  That is, they don't physically pierce any of the mechanisms and break them, they just jam them.
[01:53:00.136 --> 01:53:07.078]  And what they're really letting everybody know is, he's got better avionics, he's got better telemetry systems now, North Korea does.
[01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:12.103]  The reason these missiles keep falling out of the sky is they're getting hit with microwaves.
[01:53:12.603 --> 01:53:19.328]  These high-powered microwave signals are very efficient at disturbing and possibly disabling electronic circuits.
[01:53:19.348 --> 01:53:23.330]  We're going to tell you about that after William Binney leaves us, and we're going to tell you about this.
[01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:24.731]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:53:26.348 --> 01:53:32.635]  I've been very critical of our police being given bad training and bad policies and getting outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:53:33.055 --> 01:53:37.660]  The Ninth Circuit last week ruled that anyone that's ever had medical marijuana can have their guns taken.
[01:53:38.101 --> 01:53:42.365]  In multiple states, SWAT teams are confiscating legal, law-abiding citizens' guns.
[01:53:43.366 --> 01:53:43.747]  That's wrong.
[01:53:44.167 --> 01:53:46.450]  That's the Democrats, of course, doing that to their own people.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:56.666]  You have some departments where the police are taught they're God and where they then think that they're a drill sergeant and you're a cadet in the Marine Corps.
[01:53:57.567 --> 01:54:00.449]  And there's footage coming up next hour that Don Salazar wrote about.
[01:54:00.769 --> 01:54:02.691]  I'm going to retweet this right now at Real Alex Jones.
[01:54:02.991 --> 01:54:04.612]  This was posted last night on InfoWars.
[01:54:04.973 --> 01:54:07.515]  I'm going to have it reposted at the top of InfoWars right now.
[01:54:09.048 --> 01:54:12.650]  Shock video, police shoot dog, force owner to cut off its head.
[01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:16.891]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's no proof this dog even bit anybody.
[01:54:17.532 --> 01:54:17.872]  There's not.
[01:54:17.912 --> 01:54:22.274]  The cops just show up, no warrant, and say, cut its head off for rabies testing.
[01:54:22.794 --> 01:54:25.275]  The police are supposed to call animal control.
[01:54:27.543 --> 01:54:30.245]  And then the person refuses, they have to get a judge to order it.
[01:54:30.345 --> 01:54:37.269]  The dog is taken, it's head cut off, it's then sent to the state lab, and they see if it has rabies.
[01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:38.449]  They didn't even do that.
[01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:39.570]  There was no sign of rabies.
[01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:41.031]  Total color of law.
[01:54:42.412 --> 01:54:43.693]  You want to see bizarreness.
[01:54:44.713 --> 01:54:49.076]  And you want to see a black guy that has a reason to be upset and who is being persecuted.
[01:54:50.397 --> 01:54:52.578]  They make this guy cut his dog's head off.
[01:54:53.939 --> 01:54:55.321]  You talk about indentured servitude.
[01:54:55.341 --> 01:54:57.384]  I mean, what if the cop showed up and said, shine my shoes?
[01:54:58.165 --> 01:54:59.086]  Or wipe my butt?
[01:54:59.186 --> 01:55:00.127]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:04.613]  They shoot his dog and then say, chop its head off.
[01:55:04.633 --> 01:55:08.619]  Why don't they just say, come mow my lawn?
[01:55:09.497 --> 01:55:16.102]  That's not what, you know, this cop has not been trained, is out of control, and didn't even follow standard health department regulations.
[01:55:16.462 --> 01:55:18.403]  You call the dog catcher, bro.
[01:55:19.124 --> 01:55:22.426]  You don't tell the guy, I can't believe the guy held it together and did it.
[01:55:22.987 --> 01:55:28.190]  Because let me tell you something, you just shot my dog, and then you want me to, I'd be like, cut its head off?
[01:55:29.772 --> 01:55:32.193]  I butchered a lot of deer and wild hogs, man.
[01:55:32.754 --> 01:55:35.656]  You gotta have a hacksaw to really cut their heads off good.
[01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:42.828]  He sits there with a knife, and it's a good-sized dog, and chops its head.
[01:55:42.868 --> 01:55:44.609]  You talk about cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:55:44.809 --> 01:55:45.870]  You talk about torture.
[01:55:46.190 --> 01:55:48.692]  You talk about deranged abuse.
[01:55:54.295 --> 01:55:55.096]  It's just crazy.
[01:55:58.558 --> 01:56:01.620]  And they're arguing that, I guess, in Georgia, it doesn't have their laws written clear.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.042]  It just says the head should be chopped off, so the cop used that to say he should do it.
[01:56:06.633 --> 01:56:08.714]  Well, and it goes on, local veterinarians are trained.
[01:56:09.354 --> 01:56:11.495]  Animal control personnel can assist in the removal.
[01:56:11.535 --> 01:56:11.715]  See?
[01:56:11.975 --> 01:56:12.235]  Boom.
[01:56:12.615 --> 01:56:13.316]  I mean, I know the law.
[01:56:13.336 --> 01:56:15.816]  I used to work for a small animal vet and a large animal vet.
[01:56:16.137 --> 01:56:17.977]  A total of four years off and on.
[01:56:19.378 --> 01:56:20.338]  So I know the procedure.
[01:56:20.358 --> 01:56:20.798]  There you go.
[01:56:20.818 --> 01:56:23.879]  The cop tells him you're going to chop your dog's head off.
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.540]  That's out of control government.
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.781]  That's how the cops act in authoritarian regimes.
[01:56:28.241 --> 01:56:31.182]  And these cops are out of their minds.
[01:56:31.222 --> 01:56:33.903]  I mean, cut your dog's head.
[01:56:33.963 --> 01:56:35.764]  No, you cut its head off.
[01:56:38.396 --> 01:56:41.717]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, we need your support.
[01:56:41.757 --> 01:56:45.277]  The globalists are trying to shut us down, as you know, but we've got great products you need.
[01:56:45.617 --> 01:56:47.558]  And we've got the two big new specials this week.
[01:56:47.598 --> 01:56:48.478]  The other specials ended.
[01:56:48.918 --> 01:56:57.520]  We've got all the great non-fluoride, colloidal silver, empowered, emboldened, fortified is the word, with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.800]  I think it's the best toothpaste out there.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:56:59.980]  It's concentrate.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:00.521]  People love it.
[01:57:00.721 --> 01:57:01.541]  They're the concentrate.
[01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:04.342]  Super blue mouthwash as well.
[01:57:04.782 --> 01:57:06.883]  All of it is 50% off.
[01:57:06.983 --> 01:57:07.924]  It makes a great gift.
[01:57:08.204 --> 01:57:09.265]  Why battle the traffic?
[01:57:09.345 --> 01:57:10.325]  Why battle the crowds?
[01:57:10.625 --> 01:57:13.467]  Takes me 30 minutes longer to get home now during the Christmas rush.
[01:57:13.807 --> 01:57:16.089]  Why not just order everything at Infowarsstore.com?
[01:57:16.309 --> 01:57:24.914]  Support free speech, support the country, support the fight for justice, and give friends and family healthy toothpaste and explain it to them when they use it.
[01:57:25.414 --> 01:57:28.756]  DNA Force, 33% off now back in stock, but gonna sell out soon.
[01:57:30.478 --> 01:57:33.240]  And another great gift, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:57:34.542 --> 01:57:37.804]  Oh man, the fruit punch drink with all the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids and more.
[01:57:38.205 --> 01:57:39.826]  And the new, the real red pill.
[01:57:39.906 --> 01:57:40.447]  It's incredible.
[01:57:40.487 --> 01:57:41.107]  Find out about that.
[01:57:41.447 --> 01:57:42.008]  It's all there.
[01:57:42.108 --> 01:57:43.429]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:48.574]  Please do your Christmas shopping with us and it helps fund the operation.
[01:57:48.654 --> 01:57:49.274]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:54.273 --> 01:58:03.596]  In a massive victory for President Trump, the Supreme Court has ruled that the White House's travel ban on individuals from terror-linked countries will go into full effect.
[01:58:03.856 --> 01:58:10.819]  The court granted the administration's request to lift two injunctions imposed by lower courts that had partially blocked the ban.
[01:58:11.139 --> 01:58:16.861]  This decision overrules those lower courts, who many have accused of playing politics by blocking the ban.
[01:58:17.341 --> 01:58:19.643]  This means people seeking to enter the U.S.
[01:58:19.723 --> 01:58:25.306]  from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Chad will now be barred from doing so.
[01:58:25.786 --> 01:58:30.549]  It's a good start, but it remains to be seen if more terror-linked countries will be added to the list.
[01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:33.171]  The travel ban is not a Muslim ban.
[01:58:33.431 --> 01:58:37.254]  Most of the countries with the highest Muslim population are not even on the list.
[01:58:37.734 --> 01:58:42.241]  Seven of the nine Supreme Court justices agreed with President Trump's travel ban.
[01:58:42.481 --> 01:58:48.790]  With the economy soaring and tax cuts on the way, President Trump can now check the travel ban off his Christmas wish list.
[01:58:49.211 --> 01:58:50.993]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:54.311]  I'm so excited.
[01:58:54.371 --> 01:59:03.937]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:59:04.517 --> 01:59:12.823]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:59:13.043 --> 01:59:21.789]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:43.027]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:59:43.527 --> 01:59:44.808]  It is amazing!
[01:59:46.210 --> 01:59:51.174]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:59:56.696 --> 01:59:57.817]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.857 --> 01:59:58.778]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.798 --> 02:00:01.940]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:37.804]  Folks, I have plugged maybe two hours, I mean two minutes in the last two hours, and I need to fund the operation, plus we got some great products.
[02:00:38.284 --> 02:00:51.872]  So ahead of William Benny joining us, former head of the NSA, with some bombshell news on the whole Russia investigation, I'm going to talk about some of the unbelievable sales and exciting things that are going on right now at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:00:57.536 --> 02:00:57.996]  My friends,
[02:00:59.605 --> 02:01:02.227]  We're in the middle of the Second American Revolution.
[02:01:03.368 --> 02:01:08.491]  The globalist social engineers are trying to play us off against each other in a big way.
[02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:17.217]  They're trying to play us off according to race, according to region, according to ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, male, female.
[02:01:17.778 --> 02:01:24.402]  And again, it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the Facebook documents, it's in their own admissions that they're cold-bloodedly doing this.
[02:01:25.203 --> 02:01:26.184]  And it's up to us
[02:01:27.452 --> 02:01:34.355]  To understand they're doing that, and to transcend it, and to educate others about what's happening and what is unfolding.
[02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:40.117]  The divide and conquer we're witnessing is a desperate last ditch attempt.
[02:01:43.218 --> 02:01:56.383]  To have this country forget that we were under globalist control, forget that the social compact had been broken, forget that we had been de-industrialized, and to basically grab
[02:01:58.755 --> 02:02:01.677]  Victory from the jaws of defeat.
[02:02:02.458 --> 02:02:03.999]  We've beaten the globalists.
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:14.088]  The fact that we're aware of their multi-national operation, the fact that we're aware of their private federal reserve, the fact that the public is becoming more and more informed, that's the end of their operation.
[02:02:14.748 --> 02:02:25.937]  So if we can beat their censorship, if we can reach out to other folks that aren't awake yet, and if we can elect good people to public office, but also rebuild our industrial and cultural base,
[02:02:26.738 --> 02:02:29.779]  America's best days are ahead of us, not behind us.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:36.462]  To quote Merle Haggard, the late great, we don't have to keep rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[02:02:37.203 --> 02:02:39.404]  With no chance for freedom or the Liberty Bell.
[02:02:39.784 --> 02:02:40.124]  It's here.
[02:02:42.708 --> 02:02:53.276]  But at the same time, the globalists are trying to cut off the funding of organizations and institutions and operations that are telling the truth and that are exposing their narrative in real time.
[02:02:53.856 --> 02:03:07.467]  That's why this Christmas, it is more important than ever to support InfoWars because you're supporting yourself and you can beat the crowds, beat the traffic, beat the high prices, beat the garbage, beat the additives,
[02:03:08.757 --> 02:03:18.837]  And get, from the biggest budget to the lowest budget, high quality products that you, your family, your friends, your loved ones, that those that you're giving gifts need.

[02:03:36.514 --> 02:03:39.817]  High-quality water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO.
[02:03:40.678 --> 02:03:42.540]  Air Loom Seeds and so much more.

[02:03:59.554 --> 02:04:01.075]  Don't shop with the globalists.
[02:04:01.435 --> 02:04:02.616]  Don't trade with the enemy.
[02:04:02.716 --> 02:04:08.281]  As much as you can, and none of us are perfect, support independent media that stands up for what's right.

[02:04:17.008 --> 02:04:20.929]  You can also give InfoWarsStore gift cards to friends and family.
[02:04:21.249 --> 02:04:27.671]  That's a great way to get them to visit the site and find out about the political message while they're getting high quality products at the same time.
[02:04:28.491 --> 02:04:31.312]  And we also now have Patriot Points where you get
[02:04:32.801 --> 02:04:38.982]  5% off of every purchase added to your account for future purchases.
[02:04:39.042 --> 02:04:44.403]  That is a high-end system at 5% compared to most rewards cards.
[02:04:44.583 --> 02:04:48.244]  That is on the very high end of the spectrum for the level of 5%.
[02:04:49.344 --> 02:04:53.965]  So please, do your Christmas shopping at InfoWorksStore.com and help fund the tip of the spear against the globalists.
[02:04:54.165 --> 02:04:58.146]  We've got a lot of huge sales, 50% off on some of our best-selling products.
[02:04:58.686 --> 02:05:00.366]  So, Merry Christmas and thanks for the support.
[02:05:03.146 --> 02:05:06.030]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:15.143]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:05:15.263 --> 02:05:16.464]  So what do we do about it?
[02:05:16.645 --> 02:05:19.769]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:05:19.949 --> 02:05:27.551]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[02:05:27.691 --> 02:05:33.832]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.

[02:05:42.714 --> 02:05:55.018]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[02:05:55.438 --> 02:05:56.538]  It's the real deal.

[02:06:12.113 --> 02:06:18.657]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.058 --> 02:06:24.201]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way.
[02:06:25.122 --> 02:06:29.745]  Tell your children not to hear my words, what they mean, what they say.
[02:06:30.205 --> 02:06:30.606]  Mother,
[02:06:34.796 --> 02:06:37.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, into the third hour.
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:48.034]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're joined by really an American hero, William Binney, former technical director of the National Security Agency, one of the most famous codebreakers in U.S.
[02:06:48.054 --> 02:06:48.375]  history.
[02:06:49.055 --> 02:06:53.698]  And the equivalent of a multi-star general when he was heading up that agency.
[02:06:54.078 --> 02:07:03.944]  He's also been a whistleblower to Congress, been SWAT teamed, been targeted, been persecuted, but never charged with anything because it was all intimidation.
[02:07:04.344 --> 02:07:09.968]  ExposedFacts.org, AGoodAmerican.org is the award-winning film he's in.
[02:07:10.288 --> 02:07:16.192]  He was also the main technical director and fact director for Oliver Stone's incredible film, Snowden.
[02:07:17.173 --> 02:07:26.256]  So much of what we now know about the illegal spy grid being used against us for the political class is thanks to him, Mr. Drake, Sybil Edmonds, and many others.
[02:07:26.296 --> 02:07:29.777]  But he is the chief whistleblower out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:30.017 --> 02:07:35.238]  He's going to be talking about PGknowledge.eu today and some of the important work he's doing.
[02:07:35.278 --> 02:07:40.560]  But first off, he hasn't talked a lot about this, but today he said he's ready to talk about it.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:50.667]  In light of the whole Russiagate investigation, he wants to get into that and his meeting with the CIA director, Mr. Pompeo, a few weeks ago.
[02:07:50.687 --> 02:07:57.333]  So we're going to talk about how that meeting took place and as much as he can now reveal to this audience today.
[02:07:58.153 --> 02:08:01.796]  So thank you so much, William Binney, for joining us to discuss this.
[02:08:02.877 --> 02:08:03.898]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:08:04.538 --> 02:08:05.439]  Well, you've got the floor.
[02:08:05.839 --> 02:08:06.700]  Where would you like to start?
[02:08:08.363 --> 02:08:19.368]  Well, I think we should start with the research we've been doing on the data allegedly coming from a hack by the Russians to the DNC server.
[02:08:20.988 --> 02:08:32.353]  This was the data that was made available from Guccifer 2 that talked about the leak or the hack that he called a hack on the 5th of July of 2016.
[02:08:33.273 --> 02:08:37.655]  That data he made available for us to look at, so we started looking at it.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:46.011]  And the first thing we found was the speeds were rather high for a transfer across the web to Europe from the U.S.
[02:08:46.701 --> 02:09:00.711]  In fact, the speed, I was here in Europe with Duncan Campbell reviewing all this data again, and we found that the highest speed that that data ran from was taken down off the server, supposedly.
[02:09:00.731 --> 02:09:03.413]  This is also, this is all alleged now.
[02:09:03.974 --> 02:09:05.135]  So it was 49.1 megabytes per second.
[02:09:08.843 --> 02:09:15.031]  Which is roughly a little over four times the rate that we could get by a transfer.
[02:09:15.051 --> 02:09:22.420]  We also attempted to transfer data across the Atlantic to Europe, to various places in Amsterdam, the UK.
[02:09:23.528 --> 02:09:32.395]  One of the fellows even looked at transferring it to Belgrade and also Albania, but it was pointless to even try because the network couldn't even handle it anywhere near it there.
[02:09:32.936 --> 02:09:42.303]  So the highest we got was roughly one-fourth the speed necessary to transfer the data, which meant it was impossible to go across the net.
[02:09:43.064 --> 02:09:48.028]  But it is, however, compatible with a download to a thumb drive.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:52.663]  So, if you had a USB thumb drive, you could download it at those speeds.
[02:09:52.884 --> 02:10:08.057]  So what you're saying, as a technical expert who tested it, this was an inside job, just like Snowden doing on a thumb drive, at point-blank range, that's the speeds, that this was basically impossible to be an outside hack, which is what we know from British ambassadors, from spies, from other leaks.
[02:10:08.077 --> 02:10:13.002]  Can you then quantify why Trump wanted you to meet with Pompeo to explain this to him?
[02:10:14.195 --> 02:10:23.800]  Well, he, Director Pompeo said to me when I first sat down, he said, the president said I should talk to you if I wanted to get facts about the Russia gig.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:36.826]  That was really a shocking statement to me, because what that really says to me is the intelligence agencies aren't even telling the president or the head of the CIA the facts in the case.
[02:10:37.686 --> 02:10:40.488]  I mean, if he has to ask me what the facts are,
[02:10:41.812 --> 02:10:52.740]  Why aren't the intelligence agencies, the FBI, NSA, CIA, the members of the CIA telling even their president or the chief of the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency?
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.223]  And I know it's all classified, you can't get into it, but a lot of this is public now.
[02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:59.324]  The president has the code keys.
[02:11:01.004 --> 02:11:02.025]  He's got authorization.
[02:11:02.285 --> 02:11:03.685]  He could go in and see all this.
[02:11:04.105 --> 02:11:12.569]  But of course it was the Obama holdovers, we know, up until Trump got into office that were still there with the keys, spying on the president-elect.
[02:11:12.809 --> 02:11:13.429]  We now know that.
[02:11:14.881 --> 02:11:15.101]  Yes.
[02:11:15.461 --> 02:11:29.349]  For example, early on when the conversation between the President Trump and the President of Mexico and Australia were released, I mean, that's a clear indication that that kind of information to me came from NSA.
[02:11:29.829 --> 02:11:34.352]  Because any communications of the President leaving the White House are encrypted.
[02:11:35.132 --> 02:11:40.996]  So that the agency that has the keys and provides the equipment and the keys for the President to communicate is NSA.
[02:11:42.136 --> 02:11:46.560]  So they would be able to decrypt and translate all those conversations.
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:50.103]  So they certainly are a prime suspect for releasing that.
[02:11:50.703 --> 02:11:56.628]  But let me get back to that hack in July of 2016.
[02:11:57.348 --> 02:11:59.450]  There's more to it than just that.
[02:12:00.571 --> 02:12:03.373]  When we looked at the data, there were two batches of releases.
[02:12:03.393 --> 02:12:07.277]  The main one was dated the 5th of July.
[02:12:07.637 --> 02:12:10.099]  There was a later one dated the 1st of September.
[02:12:10.896 --> 02:12:12.077]  Also from Guccifer 2.
[02:12:12.737 --> 02:12:23.462]  But when you looked at them and you if you only looked at minutes, seconds and milliseconds, those two data sets merge.
[02:12:25.102 --> 02:12:28.264]  They merge fit right together like a glove and on a hand.
[02:12:29.164 --> 02:12:32.986]  So that you basically would have one continuous set of information.
[02:12:33.982 --> 02:12:38.446]  So it means to us that Guccifer 2 is playing games, and that this wasn't even a hack.
[02:12:38.466 --> 02:12:44.932]  You don't even know if it was a hack of the DNC, or if it was something downloaded, transferred somewhere else, and then downloaded again.
[02:12:44.972 --> 02:12:47.975]  And sir, I know this is simple for you as a top expert, but just explain.
[02:12:48.315 --> 02:12:59.866]  Not only transfer rates showed how to be done point-blank at the computer, at the server itself, but also the data, the way it was taken down and put down together, was all done together, congruent at one time.
[02:13:00.683 --> 02:13:03.724]  Yeah, and it basically says that Goose for Two is playing a game with us.
[02:13:04.464 --> 02:13:04.704]  Right?
[02:13:04.964 --> 02:13:07.125]  They're playing a game with us and everybody else.
[02:13:08.225 --> 02:13:12.506]  Because it's not the Russians that can be inside these secret facilities, obviously, getting the info.
[02:13:13.747 --> 02:13:20.529]  Yeah, well, that plus all of the indications are that it wasn't even a hack at all in any way, shape, or form.
[02:13:21.509 --> 02:13:23.289]  Wow, so you explain this to Pompeo.
[02:13:23.329 --> 02:13:23.950]  Please continue.
[02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:28.211]  Yes, and also I said that
[02:13:29.838 --> 02:13:38.508]  If members of Congress are going to call this an act of war, then they ought to do like President John F. Kennedy did and President Reagan.
[02:13:38.588 --> 02:13:45.716]  Kennedy released the photographs of the missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis because it was something that was very serious.
[02:13:46.596 --> 02:14:01.986]  And also, when the Russians shot down the Korean South Korean airline over Sakhalin Island, he released the ground to air control of the fighters, giving where the ground control ordered the shoot down of the plane.
[02:14:02.606 --> 02:14:15.915]  So those were serious situations and they basically declassified classified information so that they could show how serious the situation was and prove it to the American public and everyone else.
[02:14:17.873 --> 02:14:18.573]  Incredible!
[02:14:18.894 --> 02:14:29.960]  Now, I know you're a scientist, a computer scientist, so you just go off the facts, but just big picture, looking at this with William Binney, who's blown all this wide open, and the President wanted you to go talk to the head of the CIA.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:32.481]  He doesn't even have the keys to the NSA!
[02:14:32.921 --> 02:14:33.902]  He can get into all this.
[02:14:34.242 --> 02:14:41.846]  They've got him sequestered, but he's getting enough info to know he needs to talk to you, showing, again, the whole rush of things made up.
[02:14:42.146 --> 02:14:47.029]  It was an inside job of people trying to expose the criminality of Hillary and what was going on.
[02:14:48.641 --> 02:15:00.083]  Yeah, there's really no guarantee that even if he asks for all the information about Russiagate that's held by NSA or the FBI, that they'll even give it to him.
[02:15:00.663 --> 02:15:07.204]  Because they don't, you know, if they don't want to give away information to anybody, they can keep it and hide it internally.
[02:15:07.344 --> 02:15:08.845]  They don't have to share it with anyone.
[02:15:10.725 --> 02:15:16.666]  Couldn't the President appoint you as a special investigator and you've got the clearances to go in there and investigate for him?
[02:15:18.791 --> 02:15:20.493]  Well, I don't have any clearances anymore.
[02:15:20.753 --> 02:15:22.595]  But the President could get those for you.
[02:15:23.476 --> 02:15:24.897]  Yes, yes he could, yes.
[02:15:26.098 --> 02:15:26.879]  That's true.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.602]  Would you take that job if the President authorized you to?
[02:15:32.299 --> 02:15:34.320]  Uh, if he wanted me to do that, I would do that.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:35.581]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:15:35.701 --> 02:15:36.942]  And that'd be their worst nightmare.
[02:15:36.982 --> 02:15:38.983]  I mean, we can't trust the former head of the NSA.
[02:15:39.023 --> 02:15:39.623]  Who can we trust?
[02:15:39.703 --> 02:15:42.945]  I mean, it's just a bunch of politicos in there with the code keys.
[02:15:43.566 --> 02:15:48.469]  Samantha Powers, all of them in there, meeting with the former CIA director and everybody to set up Trump.
[02:15:48.489 --> 02:15:51.591]  I mean, these people are just, have committed incredible crimes, in my view.
[02:15:51.891 --> 02:15:54.392]  We'll be back with William Benning, a true American hero.
[02:15:54.893 --> 02:15:57.134]  There's John Wayne the actor, then there's the real John Waynes.
[02:15:57.534 --> 02:15:58.595]  William Benning's one of those.
[02:15:58.875 --> 02:15:59.915]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:15:59.936 --> 02:16:00.436]  Stay with us.
[02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:10.373]  You can learn a lot about the weaknesses of our enemies by studying what they attack.
[02:16:11.134 --> 02:16:13.295]  By studying what they fear.
[02:16:13.996 --> 02:16:15.797]  They fear families living together.
[02:16:15.837 --> 02:16:18.779]  They fear people loving God.
[02:16:18.859 --> 02:16:23.502]  They fear individuals being independent and successful and empowered.
[02:16:24.802 --> 02:16:32.047]  They fear communities really coming together and sharing in the bounding of a free market system.
[02:16:34.011 --> 02:16:40.453]  And they fear individuals openly exercising their First Amendment.
[02:16:42.014 --> 02:16:48.116]  That's why it is essential on every front to support InfoWars.
[02:16:49.016 --> 02:17:02.101]  When you get a t-shirt like this new shirt that is my all-time favorite, it's brand new, super nice fabric, it's designer-made, won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake right in the middle of the chest,
[02:17:03.129 --> 02:17:09.694]  A Dayglo, Infowars.com on the right shoulder, with an American flag, Infowars.com on the back.
[02:17:10.975 --> 02:17:18.761]  When you wear it, it telegraphs to friends and to foe where you stand and what you believe.
[02:17:20.482 --> 02:17:21.663]  And so many things will happen.
[02:17:22.864 --> 02:17:23.865]  We are the majority.
[02:17:24.775 --> 02:17:33.524]  And it lets the minions of the bullies that are out there trying to intimidate us know and understand that we're not backing down and we're aware of what's happening.
[02:17:34.665 --> 02:17:39.691]  But just as importantly, it will allow you to meet like-minded people.
[02:17:41.121 --> 02:17:43.562]  Who could become some of the best friends in your life?
[02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:52.606]  So many people stop me on the streets, all over the country, and shake my hand and say, here's my husband, here's my wife, or here's a photo of my husband and my children.
[02:17:53.306 --> 02:17:59.649]  I was wearing one of your t-shirts at the park, or at church, or at the mall, and met my spouse.
[02:18:01.529 --> 02:18:02.410]  So many people write me.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:11.491]  And also told me on the street that they met like-minded people wearing these t-shirts that then became their new employer or their new business partner.
[02:18:12.252 --> 02:18:13.834]  We have to fly our flag.
[02:18:14.844 --> 02:18:16.284]  We have to wear our colors.
[02:18:16.585 --> 02:18:21.246]  So, won't tread on me, the new shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:21.906 --> 02:18:24.767]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing can stop you.
[02:18:24.967 --> 02:18:36.230]  And I want to see seas of this iconic shirt out there at big events, and at Trump rallies, and at land rights rallies, and at Second Amendment rallies, and on C-SPAN, and on national television.
[02:18:36.450 --> 02:18:38.491]  We changed the world with the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:18:39.051 --> 02:18:41.232]  And the lock her up Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:18:41.552 --> 02:18:43.913]  We've changed the world because you took action.
[02:18:44.333 --> 02:18:50.976]  Now let's take it to the next level and also support InfoWars and our operation financially when you get the shirt.
[02:18:51.476 --> 02:18:56.138]  So promote free speech, stand up to bullies, get a high quality shirt, meet like-minded people.
[02:18:57.018 --> 02:19:04.003]  Again, and fund InfoWars and the expanding operation we've got in the face of the globalists trying to shut us down.
[02:19:04.323 --> 02:19:07.325]  It is a total complete 360 win.
[02:19:07.685 --> 02:19:24.676]  Please commit today to visit InfoWarsTore.com and look at all the amazing Patriot apparel from ball caps to sweatshirts to high quality t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and we will continue to change the world together for the better, for our children, for righteousness and for justice.
[02:19:25.456 --> 02:19:34.203]  I'm Alex Jones, and we will continue to change the world together for our children, for our communities, for ourselves, and for truth, and for justice.
[02:19:34.863 --> 02:19:39.547]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support, and I salute you all for what you've done in the InfoWar.
[02:19:39.567 --> 02:19:51.456]  Whether it's spreading links to articles and videos, or spreading the word on the ground, or telling folks about local radio stations, or supporting our local sponsors, all of it has changed the world, especially your prayers.
[02:19:51.756 --> 02:19:52.237]  So please,
[02:19:52.697 --> 02:19:58.025]  From myself and my family and the amazing crew here at InfoWars, thank you for all you've done.
[02:19:58.426 --> 02:19:59.968]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:20:05.076 --> 02:20:07.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.551 --> 02:20:22.807]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:50.097 --> 02:21:03.809]  Ladies and gentlemen, William Binney, the former head of technical, actual operations of the National Security Agency, the man behind the movie Snowden, the main expert on that, is our guest this segment and next.
[02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:06.351]  He is on the road in Europe.
[02:21:07.512 --> 02:21:11.856]  His computer battery will probably last about 45 after or so, but if it cuts out he'll be gone.
[02:21:12.256 --> 02:21:14.098]  This is so huge, okay?
[02:21:14.398 --> 02:21:16.420]  He's one of the leading experts in the world.
[02:21:16.801 --> 02:21:21.585]  The president wanted him to meet with the CIA director because they're trying to understand what's going on.
[02:21:22.346 --> 02:21:26.590]  Because this is so complex and the agencies don't tell each other a lot of information.
[02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:31.392]  And so here is William Binney looking at the supposed Russian hack they're saying.
[02:21:31.692 --> 02:21:33.833]  They've never proven Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian.
[02:21:34.113 --> 02:21:37.435]  But now we know what British ambassadors and others have said they've been told.
[02:21:37.835 --> 02:21:45.419]  They've said they've met with the supposed Guccifer and that it was a group of US intelligence operatives and people that were upset about what was happening.
[02:21:46.499 --> 02:21:50.501]  I have had high-level contacts confirm that to me back during the election.
[02:21:50.962 --> 02:21:59.146]  And I know that people like Eric Prince got information that I had separately had but not released about it and that Eric Prince knows.
[02:21:59.486 --> 02:22:01.567]  So all I'm saying is this is not a secret.
[02:22:01.807 --> 02:22:05.389]  This has been in British and German newspapers but not really in our news.
[02:22:05.689 --> 02:22:06.810]  It's a huge scandal.
[02:22:07.170 --> 02:22:12.552]  It's the key to understanding Russiagate and how they're trying to remove our president with zero evidence.
[02:22:12.873 --> 02:22:15.394]  They've got NSA transcripts of General Flynn.
[02:22:15.774 --> 02:22:26.164]  Not doing anything wrong, but then an FBI agent who worked for Hillary, who's disgraced, is the one that wrote up the forms claiming what he told them didn't match the NSA spying.
[02:22:26.545 --> 02:22:31.169]  So this is huge, huge news and blows the whole Russia narrative wide open.
[02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:35.554]  William Benny, please, break this down and get into other angles, because again, you're the expert.
[02:22:37.348 --> 02:22:46.013]  Well, we're looking at other evidence also, technical evidence, that looks like even earlier claims might be a total sham also.
[02:22:46.653 --> 02:22:51.836]  So in other words, it looks like virtually all of this data has been a fabrication.
[02:22:52.922 --> 02:22:57.566]  That's been created as a diversion, basically, so that we can pay attention.
[02:22:57.706 --> 02:22:59.728]  It's like we're playing the Wizard of Oz game.
[02:22:59.768 --> 02:23:00.368]  Pay attention.
[02:23:00.388 --> 02:23:02.490]  Don't pay any attention to the man behind the curtain.
[02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:07.054]  Look at all the side show that's going on.
[02:23:07.514 --> 02:23:08.475]  Pay attention over here.
[02:23:09.496 --> 02:23:10.056]  Don't look at me.
[02:23:12.132 --> 02:23:25.156]  I just think that this whole thing has been a setup from the beginning and it's being right now the technical evidence is starting to show that and prove that and we'll be publishing information about that hopefully very soon.
[02:23:26.636 --> 02:23:26.936]  Wow!
[02:23:28.617 --> 02:23:36.259]  Was your whole meeting with Pompeo, I mean did he say it was off record or what else can you tell us about this amazing meeting requested by the president?
[02:23:37.242 --> 02:23:39.703]  No, he didn't say it was off the record or anything.
[02:23:39.743 --> 02:23:45.785]  He just said he wanted to talk to me about getting, the President asked him to talk to me about getting facts about Russkade.
[02:23:46.225 --> 02:23:54.587]  So I just told him everything I knew at the time, and we're getting more and more information that kind of corroborates everything we've been saying about it being a fabrication.
[02:23:56.088 --> 02:23:59.689]  And we'll be adding that publicly shortly, I hope.
[02:24:01.293 --> 02:24:03.274]  It's a matter of verifying everything we've done.
[02:24:03.314 --> 02:24:06.154]  We don't want to say something that we can't actually show and prove.
[02:24:06.654 --> 02:24:06.974]  Wow.
[02:24:08.195 --> 02:24:11.095]  Well, I know that you've received classified awards.
[02:24:11.795 --> 02:24:16.276]  You can't talk about those, but it's been reported that you've gotten some of the biggest awards in the country you can get.
[02:24:16.336 --> 02:24:22.918]  I mean, you were running operations against the Russians, and so you'd be the expert to investigate the Russians.
[02:24:23.778 --> 02:24:39.586]  From your, you know, spy chief gravitas, when you say it looks like it's a setup beyond just an inside job, without getting into, you know, statecraft and things, as an expert, what are you seeing?
[02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:50.972]  Well, there are people in other countries involved, like in the UK, with the
[02:24:52.515 --> 02:24:56.599]  Suppose a report from the British intelligence, you know, that kind of thing.
[02:24:56.739 --> 02:25:06.989]  And also, internally, if you believe Cy Hirsch, what he's saying is people in the FBI know exactly who leaked the data, and they're not talking about that.
[02:25:08.050 --> 02:25:15.977]  And so there are people in the FBI, people in lower ranks in the CIA, also people in NSA who are involved in all of this.
[02:25:17.499 --> 02:25:26.408]  Those are the three agencies are the main ones who made up the, you know, the Intelligence Community Assessment, where they claimed 17 intelligence agencies.
[02:25:26.428 --> 02:25:27.549]  Well, it was really only three.
[02:25:27.569 --> 02:25:34.135]  And it was hand-picked people from those three to come up with a predetermined outcome, which is what they did.
[02:25:34.255 --> 02:25:39.200]  And they wrote a 14-page ICA Intelligence Community Assessment paper
[02:25:39.838 --> 02:25:48.690]  That started out by saying we have high confidence that and it's our judgment that we have high confidence that this uh that the Russians did the hack but then on the very bottom page 13 it says
[02:25:49.938 --> 02:25:54.843]  Please don't interpret our judgment to mean that we have absolute facts to prove that this is absolutely true.
[02:25:55.283 --> 02:26:07.355]  So what they're saying is, you know, this whole report was a big sham, and they had no evidence whatsoever, nothing to back up any claim they were making, and it was just, you know, another fabrication.
[02:26:07.395 --> 02:26:11.179]  So it just shows you the extent of the organization behind this charade.
[02:26:12.352 --> 02:26:15.053]  Well, I know where to look out of these 17 agencies.
[02:26:15.113 --> 02:26:24.938]  It's that handful of people that put out the hoax that all 17 agencies all concurred, and then who put out these scurrilous fake reports.
[02:26:24.959 --> 02:26:30.181]  I mean, I think you start with them in your investigation of who really cooked all this garbage up.
[02:26:30.541 --> 02:26:37.265]  If you were speaking to the president, and he obviously listens to what you have to say and what you write, what would you say he needs to do next?
[02:26:38.912 --> 02:26:40.393]  I would say he needs to clean house.
[02:26:40.433 --> 02:26:46.055]  He's got to start firing people who are in charge of these agencies and replace them with people who do a proper job.
[02:26:47.655 --> 02:26:55.718]  And that means cleaning out the internal, internally, cleaning out the agencies and making sure they start to obey the Constitution, which they're not doing now.
[02:26:56.259 --> 02:26:58.840]  And that includes the Department of Justice.
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:00.760]  I'm not excluding them either.
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:03.821]  They're a part of this charade, too, in one form or another.
[02:27:03.841 --> 02:27:07.763]  They're covering up for the people who are involved in this.
[02:27:08.422 --> 02:27:12.004]  Because if the FBI knows who did it, they also know, at least some of them.
[02:27:12.085 --> 02:27:14.326]  Now whether they're telling anybody, that's another story.
[02:27:17.268 --> 02:27:25.654]  I wonder how they think they're gonna get away with it when it's the Clintons that have this huge history with the Russians and Uranium One and their foundation, and then you've got Trump surveilled.
[02:27:26.584 --> 02:27:28.906]  We learned by Obama when he first got into office.
[02:27:28.946 --> 02:27:29.867]  I was also on the list.
[02:27:30.187 --> 02:27:32.409]  That was a whole data leak that came out of federal law enforcement.
[02:27:32.729 --> 02:27:36.192]  And there were hundreds of thousands of names and phone numbers of mine that were private.
[02:27:36.493 --> 02:27:37.854]  And I even had some of Trump's private numbers.
[02:27:37.894 --> 02:27:42.238]  Those were his numbers at Mar-a-Lago and also one of his private numbers at Trump Tower.
[02:27:42.618 --> 02:27:44.800]  I never even had the nerve to use, but we got the list.
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:46.802]  I was like, wow, that's the number I got for him at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:27:47.342 --> 02:27:53.873]  So they were illegally surveilling him all these years and intensified during the campaign and then they can't even find anything.
[02:27:53.933 --> 02:27:58.380]  That shows he's got a pretty good record if they're illegally spying on him and nothing's there.
[02:28:00.293 --> 02:28:17.185]  Yeah, but it also shows all the illegality that they've been involved in, including violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, trying to use his communications without warrants against him in terms of, you know, charging him with something.
[02:28:17.625 --> 02:28:25.571]  That is a clear violation of the founding principles of our nation, and this is fundamentally treason at the highest levels, in my view.
[02:28:27.523 --> 02:28:29.144]  You're right, William Benny's our guest.
[02:28:29.545 --> 02:28:31.867]  I think it's fair to say that the House of Cards is coming down.
[02:28:31.907 --> 02:28:32.607]  I mean, it's coming out.
[02:28:32.647 --> 02:28:33.268]  They surveilled them.
[02:28:33.568 --> 02:28:34.849]  It's in the Flynn documents.
[02:28:34.869 --> 02:28:35.710]  They got caught lying.
[02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:45.618]  So what do we do legally now to make sure that they end up getting in trouble before they launch the next part of their fiction, as Ron Paul called it last week, as you called it, a charade.
[02:28:46.558 --> 02:28:50.339]  Uh, where they're planning to indict the President for obstruction of justice.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:52.180]  The word is, as early as Christmas.
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:53.861]  And I reported that Friday.
[02:28:53.901 --> 02:28:56.922]  They now, NBC News yesterday, said that that is the word.
[02:28:56.962 --> 02:28:58.522]  They're looking to indict the President.
[02:28:58.782 --> 02:29:00.143]  We'll be back with William Binney.
[02:29:02.443 --> 02:29:07.727]  Bombshell information revealed this week could undermine the integrity of the Russia collusion investigation.
[02:29:07.947 --> 02:29:12.410]  Peter Sturzik was the top FBI official assigned to Mueller's special counsel.
[02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:20.555]  For nearly four months, it's been kept secret that the FBI agent exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary Clinton text messages with his mistress.
[02:29:20.715 --> 02:29:24.138]  The reported text messages show a bias that cannot be ignored.
[02:29:24.278 --> 02:29:32.343]  Sturzik also led the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, and he played a direct role in the statement that ultimately cleared Clinton of criminal responsibility.
[02:29:32.403 --> 02:29:32.963]  I think so.
[02:30:02.745 --> 02:30:06.969]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[02:31:04.075 --> 02:31:05.156]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:05.416 --> 02:31:06.337]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:06.617 --> 02:31:11.862]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:31:11.942 --> 02:31:25.515]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:31:25.555 --> 02:31:26.956]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:31:27.717 --> 02:31:29.258]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:31:29.358 --> 02:31:31.840]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:33.201]  These are all parasites.
[02:31:33.261 --> 02:31:34.342]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:31:34.362 --> 02:31:35.423]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:31:35.734 --> 02:31:40.036]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:31:40.236 --> 02:31:43.377]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:31:43.397 --> 02:31:46.598]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:31:46.618 --> 02:31:47.599]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:31:47.659 --> 02:31:49.539]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:49.599 --> 02:31:50.620]  And folks, you can't lose.

[02:33:04.329 --> 02:33:08.853]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:25.648]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:33:26.228 --> 02:33:28.911]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.446 --> 02:33:39.034]  And that doesn't mean I have all the answers, but the amazing guests we have like William Benny and Dr. Ron Paul and others, they do have the answers.
[02:33:40.279 --> 02:33:50.450]  And I was just on the website pgknowledge.eu and the Good American and a bunch of others and they've got the documents and the breakdowns of the fraud, that it was an internal deal, there was no Russian hacking.
[02:33:51.210 --> 02:33:52.832]  They're just involved in a giant hoax.
[02:33:53.413 --> 02:33:58.077]  And they want to basically have it where any surveillance of their illegal activity is supposedly Russian.
[02:33:58.498 --> 02:33:59.959]  Because they're committing all these crimes.
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.503]  But, again, William Binning is our guest.
[02:34:03.963 --> 02:34:05.865]  pgknowledge.eu.
[02:34:06.245 --> 02:34:08.147]  The film, A Good American.
[02:34:08.587 --> 02:34:12.891]  In the nine minutes we have left, sir, please break down the great work you're doing in Europe.
[02:34:14.432 --> 02:34:15.914]  Again, that's so important.
[02:34:15.934 --> 02:34:21.859]  The president asked you to meet with the CIA director and just other key facts that folks should be made aware of.
[02:34:24.183 --> 02:34:28.987]  First of all, I would recommend that they take a look at A Good American, the movie.
[02:34:29.027 --> 02:34:35.793]  It's only something like $4 to look at Netflix and so on, on web, and you can access it there.
[02:34:37.054 --> 02:34:38.655]  It really gives you the background.
[02:34:39.796 --> 02:34:51.225]  My career in NSA gives you the idea how intelligence works, but also it leads you into understanding how they're doing this mass surveillance and what it means and how it can all be pulled together.
[02:34:52.274 --> 02:35:00.237]  And then, of course, it also gives you the idea of how they're violating the Constitution and everybody's rights, even though they don't know it.
[02:35:01.397 --> 02:35:13.941]  But they shouldn't go around saying things like, I'm not doing anything wrong, so I have nothing to fear, simply because, you know, they're not really free to have free thoughts and be creative and innovative without having the government watch you.
[02:35:14.441 --> 02:35:20.303]  Because if you start doing something that is not compatible with their thinking, they'll come after you, just like they did us.
[02:35:21.207 --> 02:35:37.096]  And so they made it impossible fundamentally for us to do the kind of analytic job that we had developed inside NSA and do a similar job outside commercially or even with other departments of government they wouldn't let us do it.
[02:35:37.457 --> 02:35:49.383]  They got us fired and contracts terminated and it was all a series of things they did first at the NGO and then at the INSCOM, then at Customs and Border Protection and
[02:35:50.624 --> 02:35:56.466]  So, everywhere we went, they made sure that we couldn't succeed at that job.
[02:35:57.006 --> 02:36:15.392]  So, eventually, and then the Department of Justice started coming after us, trying to put us in jail with fabricated evidence, and we stopped all that by telling them that we had exculpatory data and evidence, then that they were doing, their effort was malicious prosecution, and then they finally left us alone.
[02:36:16.212 --> 02:36:25.115]  So in the end, you know, after so many years of that, we basically found an opportunity over here in Europe where they value privacy more.
[02:36:26.436 --> 02:36:36.279]  And we decided to come over here and do this job over here, put together a system that will allow us to analyze massive amounts of data and pull out only what's necessary and what's relevant.
[02:36:37.023 --> 02:36:43.911]  And make sense of massive data, which we could have done in the US 20 years ago, but they denied it and kept us from doing it.
[02:36:44.232 --> 02:36:45.654]  So we're over here now doing that.
[02:36:46.695 --> 02:36:55.045]  And we're looking at commercial applications, insurance and banking and all kinds of applications on massive data around Europe.
[02:36:56.590 --> 02:37:12.354]  So basically the trailblazing research you did that could actually target real terrorists, real criminals, and not violate everybody's privacy, at the same time really stopping disasters, you've run into folks in Europe that are actually looking at allowing you to actually try to build that?
[02:37:13.594 --> 02:37:20.636]  Yeah, and they're actually helping us by, you know, they're organizing and we're forming a company and they're backing us and financing it.
[02:37:20.696 --> 02:37:22.657]  So yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:22.937 --> 02:37:23.597]  That's amazing.
[02:37:26.149 --> 02:37:27.670]  A good American is amazing.
[02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:29.790]  I had to come over here to do it, you know?
[02:37:31.311 --> 02:37:32.511]  What's the matter with America?
[02:37:33.492 --> 02:37:39.674]  Well, as you warned previously as a whistleblower, and then in interviews, and here, and then of course the movie Snowden,
[02:37:41.004 --> 02:37:53.397]  The political class is making hundreds of billions of dollars off this giant super spy grid that spies on everything, but then it's so massively over-targeted it then does nothing to actually stop real problems.
[02:37:53.457 --> 02:37:58.863]  It violates everybody's rights and then lets the political class use it in political campaigns
[02:37:59.864 --> 02:38:18.369]  Not just against Republicans, but the Democrats and the CIA have used it against Dianne Feinstein and others, and it's all admitted they've illegally done it, and it's now this nightmare with a new superclass, with godlike omnipresent surveillance powers, dragnetting their political opposition.
[02:38:19.049 --> 02:38:20.150]  It's just astounding.
[02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:28.592]  Yeah, and they're acting like they have no respect for the law, and they're above the law, and nobody's going to do anything about it.
[02:38:29.142 --> 02:38:33.104]  I mean, here you have these people lying directly in the Congress and everybody knows it.
[02:38:33.165 --> 02:38:35.346]  They got caught at it and still nothing happens.
[02:38:35.966 --> 02:38:37.987]  Now what is the matter with the Department of Justice?
[02:38:38.088 --> 02:38:39.769]  Why aren't they holding these people accountable?
[02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:45.212]  I mean, they certainly do that with whistleblowers who are exposing the problems and the crimes.
[02:38:45.894 --> 02:38:51.678]  So, anybody who exposes something, you step on them, and everybody else who commits them, you give them retroactively.
[02:38:51.698 --> 02:38:57.902]  I was about to say, Loretta Lynch, first they lied about the tarmac meeting, then when it came out, it was totally illegal.
[02:38:57.982 --> 02:38:59.663]  He was under criminal investigation by her.
[02:39:00.804 --> 02:39:03.165]  The FBI documents have now been released by the FBI.
[02:39:03.446 --> 02:39:06.448]  They're trying to find out if it was a cop or whoever to get them fired.
[02:39:06.988 --> 02:39:08.849]  Right, and you can also don't forget that Mueller and Comey
[02:39:34.815 --> 02:39:52.912]  We're the two of the main players back in as early as 2001 and 2004 in the Department of Justice and the FBI who actually were using the Stellar Wind program, the illegally acquired data, against individuals inside the United States for common criminal activity.
[02:39:54.133 --> 02:39:57.396]  And of course then they did the parallel construction of the DEA and the rest of it.
[02:39:58.556 --> 02:40:04.121]  And then, so, they were in charge, I guess, later when you got SWAT teamed, too, right?
[02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:05.883]  I mean, these are monsters.
[02:40:06.863 --> 02:40:07.284]  That's right.
[02:40:07.524 --> 02:40:08.925]  They're basic criminals.
[02:40:10.046 --> 02:40:10.447]  That's all.
[02:40:10.887 --> 02:40:11.307]  Gosh!
[02:40:12.248 --> 02:40:14.630]  And they know it's criminal what they did, and it's all come out!
[02:40:15.551 --> 02:40:15.891]  Wow!
[02:40:16.612 --> 02:40:24.299]  Well, I tell you, if we could just get rid of these guys... That's why I'm calling our Department of Justice now our Department of Just Us.
[02:40:26.089 --> 02:40:26.349]  Wow.
[02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:33.774]  Well, sir, I'm just blown away by your courage and Mr. Drake's courage and all the others and what you've gone through and how they tried to put you guys in prison.
[02:40:33.794 --> 02:40:34.594]  That's a whole other story.
[02:40:34.634 --> 02:40:38.496]  But then patriots inside justice would leak that you'd been set up.
[02:40:39.537 --> 02:40:40.417]  So there is a God.
[02:40:40.718 --> 02:40:41.478]  There is justice.
[02:40:41.518 --> 02:40:44.420]  But good men and women have to stand up and have to tell the truth.
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:47.642]  I hope this whole Clinton globalist Bush
[02:40:48.382 --> 02:40:51.745]  Yeah, I think they're really afraid of him and what he'll be able to achieve.
[02:41:07.871 --> 02:41:14.536]  They're also afraid of him because he might see through them, which I think he does, and start to break up their game.
[02:41:15.096 --> 02:41:16.937]  That's one of the things they don't want to happen.
[02:41:16.997 --> 02:41:22.201]  I mean, the thing that they fear most is sunlight on the activities they've been performing.
[02:41:22.819 --> 02:41:33.163]  And they want to keep it that's why the mainstream media is one of their main targets so they can't they won't broadcast any other any other opinions or views other than the ones they want shared.
[02:41:33.624 --> 02:41:40.967]  So you know I think the basic problem with what they why they hate Trump so much is because they fear him so much.
[02:41:41.957 --> 02:42:05.007]  That's right, and as you've said, now Google, Facebook, Twitter, they're using NSA style tools to spy on liberal, conservative, you name it, outside speech, and then censor us in real time, not just keep you off mainstream news, not just keep me off, but then censor us in real time, not because we're fake news, but because we're researched real news.
[02:42:06.519 --> 02:42:07.179]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.101]  And you can't have that in a controlled environment.
[02:42:10.121 --> 02:42:17.266]  That's also what one of the reasons, one of the things I said about the bulk surveillance is that one of the main objectives is population control.
[02:42:17.766 --> 02:42:23.530]  Now, also to make that happen, you have to control the narrative that's fed to the larger population of the country.
[02:42:24.011 --> 02:42:26.272]  And that takes the mainstream media.
[02:42:26.292 --> 02:42:27.573]  And that's basically what's happening.
[02:42:28.214 --> 02:42:35.038]  They are, in fact, controlled by the government, the shadow government, and those who want to control the narrative.
[02:42:35.578 --> 02:42:38.739]  And now they admit they want to sew it up in free speech, have authoritarianism.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:40.821]  Now they have their spy grid in place.
[02:42:40.841 --> 02:42:43.382]  This is really happening, like history shows it would.
[02:42:43.682 --> 02:42:44.582]  Well, you're really a hero.
[02:42:44.602 --> 02:42:47.524]  I know you don't want to hear that, but you really are a hero, and you've been vindicated and everything.
[02:42:47.844 --> 02:42:49.565]  You're a real class act, William Benny.
[02:42:49.885 --> 02:42:51.426]  Thank you for your time, and Godspeed.
[02:42:52.266 --> 02:42:52.907]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:42:53.703 --> 02:42:56.806]  Folks, learn more at goodamerican.org or pgnowledge.eu.
[02:42:57.367 --> 02:42:59.168]  It's up to us now to spread the word.
[02:42:59.188 --> 02:42:59.629]  Thank you, Doctor.
[02:43:03.115 --> 02:43:12.560]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:17.803]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[02:43:18.463 --> 02:43:29.809]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[02:43:30.683 --> 02:43:44.076]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[02:43:44.877 --> 02:43:49.962]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[02:43:50.443 --> 02:43:51.884]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[02:43:52.745 --> 02:44:00.539]  And a lot of protein, and you don't chew it properly sometimes, there's buildup, you can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis, you name it.
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:03.404]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[02:44:04.554 --> 02:44:12.019]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[02:44:12.539 --> 02:44:24.508]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[02:44:24.828 --> 02:44:27.370]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[02:44:27.990 --> 02:44:31.993]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[02:44:32.393 --> 02:44:34.255]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[02:44:34.675 --> 02:44:48.545]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[02:44:48.765 --> 02:44:54.990]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits from proven high-quality probiotics
[02:44:55.330 --> 02:45:00.155]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[02:45:00.495 --> 02:45:03.357]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[02:45:03.818 --> 02:45:05.579]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:16.389]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:19.672]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[02:45:20.828 --> 02:45:33.640]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:43.429]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[02:45:44.952 --> 02:45:46.673]  This is the total win-win.
[02:45:47.213 --> 02:45:52.897]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[02:45:53.457 --> 02:45:57.880]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:02.283]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[02:46:02.743 --> 02:46:03.724]  At the lowest price.
[02:46:04.204 --> 02:46:13.631]  Many probiotics out there don't even have caplets that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[02:46:14.191 --> 02:46:20.996]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[02:46:21.856 --> 02:46:29.441]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[02:46:29.782 --> 02:46:35.486]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[02:46:35.946 --> 02:46:40.609]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[02:46:41.209 --> 02:46:50.256]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[02:46:51.331 --> 02:46:55.057]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[02:46:55.257 --> 02:47:03.089]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:47:04.270 --> 02:47:06.914]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.286 --> 02:47:27.448]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:47:28.168 --> 02:47:30.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.350 --> 02:47:45.316]  It's coming out that these FBI agents that are having to leave the whole fake Mueller investigation didn't just exonerate Hillary and cover up for her when her and her aides lied, but they praised DOJ official after defying Trump travel ban.
[02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:56.606]  The Supreme Court has now again completely authorized, and of course we knew that would happen, it's clear in law, but I've got a bunch of news on that front right now.
[02:48:01.708 --> 02:48:09.530]  The first thing I want to get at here though is that this Mueller thing is completely transparent.
[02:48:10.987 --> 02:48:21.063]  And that's why the media now goes into this whole hoax mode of fake news that Trump got caught working with the Russians during the campaign and Flynn's going to testify to it because it's all they've got and they did that on purpose.
[02:48:21.604 --> 02:48:22.525]  So you've got to know.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:33.342]  They did that on purpose to test it, to see if folks bought it, and then to suspend their head investigator, who's famous for doing that stuff, for four weeks, to gauge it.
[02:48:33.883 --> 02:48:35.023]  They're testing right now.
[02:48:35.963 --> 02:48:50.787]  And so, get ready for some other whoppers, because a lot of psychological studies show, you put big enough lies like that out, it just creates the perception, even if people find out it's not true, it still gives those that want to buy into it a subconscious hope.
[02:48:52.110 --> 02:48:53.791]  It's very, very delusional behavior.
[02:48:55.492 --> 02:49:00.976]  But they're getting ready with the indictment for obstruction, so they need to kind of have that background out there.
[02:49:02.257 --> 02:49:05.940]  Now, I didn't cover this a few days ago when they attacked me, because there's a new attack every day.
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:10.203]  But Newsweek and everything else put out lies about yours truly.
[02:49:12.270 --> 02:49:20.315]  Because Media Matters, run by George Soros, put out a story attacking me, so when they do that, all the other minions go, oh, our boss said do this, let's follow it.
[02:49:21.095 --> 02:49:28.699]  And they said that I put out a vile anti-lesbian rant, where I said lesbians want to eat people's brains.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:30.100]  Uh, no.
[02:49:30.380 --> 02:49:39.325]  I said, then you've got the rich executive types, like Fifty Shades of Grey, that want to torture you, they trick you into a bondage setting, and then they torture you.
[02:49:39.625 --> 02:49:40.306]  I was talking about
[02:49:41.636 --> 02:49:46.499]  The whole bondage situation where people end up getting in bad situations when they get tied up.
[02:49:46.799 --> 02:49:48.601]  So I was mixing the two things together.
[02:49:49.161 --> 02:49:51.222]  I don't hate anybody that's gay or lesbian or any of that.
[02:49:51.462 --> 02:50:01.269]  But it's a fact that in the gay or straight bondage movement, if you study criminology, not just here but in Europe, it's really bad in England and really bad in Germany.
[02:50:01.629 --> 02:50:07.052]  Like one of the main guys in the Scorpions said, no, I've been to parties and clubs where they kill people.
[02:50:07.312 --> 02:50:08.393]  And folks, they do.
[02:50:08.693 --> 02:50:09.314]  And it's coming out.
[02:50:10.177 --> 02:50:11.138]  Gay, straight, you name it.
[02:50:11.218 --> 02:50:12.499]  I'm just saying bad stuff.
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:17.224]  So the media then edits that together to make it sound like I'm saying lesbians are eating brains.
[02:50:17.564 --> 02:50:20.286]  No, I said globalist devil worshippers do stuff like that.
[02:50:21.788 --> 02:50:25.031]  And there's been cases of psychopaths that do eat people's brains while they're alive.
[02:50:25.291 --> 02:50:29.194]  Like... Who was the guy up in Milwaukee?
[02:50:29.255 --> 02:50:29.895]  Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:50:30.195 --> 02:50:30.335]  So...
[02:50:31.553 --> 02:50:32.974]  That's how desperate fake news is.
[02:50:33.374 --> 02:50:36.256]  InfoWars host Jones' vile anti-lesbian rant.
[02:50:36.677 --> 02:50:40.279]  Jones impersonates a liberal lesbian eating brains.
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:43.301]  Well, they got a problem.
[02:50:43.481 --> 02:50:49.465]  Somebody else put out fake news about it, about when I talked about it, and they got it right but also wrong.
[02:50:49.946 --> 02:50:59.172]  Alex Jones' Harvey Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief, where I talk about how they train you to get tied up like Fifty Shades of Grey, but then you end up getting tortured and killed.
[02:50:59.986 --> 02:51:09.455]  You go to California, you're there, you're gonna be a crack whore, and they're done using you, they're gonna put you in a snuff film for European consumption, and they're gonna torture you to death.
[02:51:09.515 --> 02:51:11.177]  I'm talking about general evil.
[02:51:11.417 --> 02:51:13.239]  Heterosexual, homosexual, you name it.
[02:51:14.591 --> 02:51:15.172]  And then here it is.
[02:51:15.192 --> 02:51:18.835]  Studies that prove domestic violence is LGBT issue.
[02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:23.979]  The part about lesbians was about most studies show they have the highest levels of domestic abuse.
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:25.501]  It's just what it's in the news.
[02:51:25.801 --> 02:51:28.664]  So it's not just like men hurt women or vice versa.
[02:51:29.004 --> 02:51:31.306]  It's that this goes on with women too.
[02:51:31.606 --> 02:51:32.467]  Women aren't perfect.
[02:51:32.707 --> 02:51:35.130]  Let's all stop bashing each other and just realize the facts.
[02:51:36.050 --> 02:51:37.592]  Now, the reason I raise all that
[02:51:38.638 --> 02:51:42.980]  And here it is, Soros Fund Manager Rape Beat Playboy Models, $27 million lawsuit.
[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:45.221]  Soros Fund Manager, blah, blah, blah.
[02:51:45.241 --> 02:51:48.842]  You have this other group, branding women, using women to recruit them.
[02:51:49.282 --> 02:51:57.306]  And you had Hollywood star females that were second in command, former Smithville actress second in command in sex cult, torture cult.
[02:51:58.186 --> 02:51:59.967]  I mean, I'm just reading the stuff.
[02:51:59.987 --> 02:52:02.928]  Hollywood actresses, sex slavery, enslaving other women.
[02:52:02.948 --> 02:52:07.330]  I'm just telling you, this is what's at the bottom of the barrel, is men and women torturing people.
[02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:09.451]  Lesbian women, straight women.
[02:52:09.971 --> 02:52:11.132]  Gay men, straight men.
[02:52:11.332 --> 02:52:12.173]  It's going on.
[02:52:12.493 --> 02:52:13.213]  It's happening.
[02:52:13.954 --> 02:52:14.674]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:52:15.715 --> 02:52:18.616]  And then it'll be, Jones went back to attacking the lesbians again!
[02:52:19.197 --> 02:52:20.918]  Yes, there are lesbians that do bad things.
[02:52:21.498 --> 02:52:23.279]  There are straight people that do bad things.
[02:52:23.599 --> 02:52:24.360]  I'm sick of it.
[02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:28.442]  Everybody knows I'm not on some kick against lesbians or anybody else.
[02:52:29.483 --> 02:52:31.424]  I'd be a big hypocrite if I was, because I like women.
[02:52:31.484 --> 02:52:32.204]  I get it.
[02:52:33.125 --> 02:52:35.967]  So the point is, is that now there's this story.
[02:52:37.165 --> 02:52:40.828]  On Infowars.com and Newswars.com that just broke.
[02:52:41.989 --> 02:52:42.930]  Hashtag Me Too.
[02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:46.233]  Female singer accused of rape by former colleague.
[02:52:47.213 --> 02:52:50.917]  It's moment of reckoning coming for female predators.
[02:52:51.817 --> 02:53:03.047]  And folks, I see the police reports the news, but it's always back of the paper, or I know folks it happens to, where you get the butch chick, and then she beats up the non-butch chick.
[02:53:04.245 --> 02:53:05.908]  And, you know, smacks her around or rapes her.
[02:53:06.069 --> 02:53:07.571]  And that's what's being reported here.
[02:53:07.732 --> 02:53:15.125]  Singer Melanie Martinez has been accused, again that's allegedly going on here, of rape by a former colleague.
[02:53:16.109 --> 02:53:21.533]  Suggesting that Me Too reckoning is also coming for female predators in the entertainment industry.
[02:53:22.033 --> 02:53:33.201]  Musician Timothy Heller accused Martinez of raping a tweet on Tuesday morning in which included a detailed story, and it's a woman that goes by Timothy Heller, about how the abuse began and the unspecified date.
[02:53:33.941 --> 02:53:37.644]  And kept hitting on her, kept grabbing on her, and then finally raped her, reportedly.
[02:53:38.442 --> 02:53:39.763]  Now, who knows if that's true or not.
[02:53:39.783 --> 02:53:41.765]  You know, if I question it, now I condone rape.
[02:53:41.825 --> 02:53:45.268]  No, I mean, about half the rape allegations you hear out there end up to be fake.
[02:53:45.468 --> 02:53:46.869]  That's well known in criminology as well.
[02:53:48.071 --> 02:53:49.111]  Does it lessen the real rape?
[02:53:49.172 --> 02:53:52.995]  No, but it turned out the whole lacrosse thing, raping the black lady, was fake.
[02:53:54.776 --> 02:53:57.018]  It's just, this is how people get attention.
[02:53:57.159 --> 02:53:58.520]  I'm not saying this isn't real.
[02:53:59.701 --> 02:54:01.181]  Because it kind of fits the whole MO.
[02:54:01.642 --> 02:54:02.442]  But we don't know.
[02:54:03.382 --> 02:54:18.026]  I'm just getting at the fact that that story is up on Infowars.com, and the Huffington Post got it right that I talked about people like Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood end up getting women into bondage, and a lot of times when they finally get them tied up the fourth or fifth time, sometimes they never come back.
[02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:21.267]  And I told you that back before it had come out, he'd raped women, reportedly.
[02:54:21.807 --> 02:54:24.448]  I'm not saying he's doing it, I'm saying that type of stuff goes on.
[02:54:24.688 --> 02:54:26.228]  So that was the same thing I broke down.
[02:54:26.728 --> 02:54:29.009]  They say, oh, he said a horrible thing about Harvey Weinstein.
[02:54:30.592 --> 02:54:38.554]  Which wasn't even true, but at least they got the quote that it was about men, 50 Shades of Grey stuff, being training for kidnapping women, and for getting women in bad positions.
[02:54:38.594 --> 02:54:46.656]  So look out, men or women, don't go into dungeons with people you think you know, even four or five times, and then get chained up on the fifth time.
[02:54:47.256 --> 02:54:58.039]  That's what psychopaths do, and a lot of people come up missing because of that, and movies like 50 Shades of Grey and the accompanying books have popularized a whole new launch of this, and many women are going on Craigslist
[02:54:58.459 --> 02:55:03.241]  And on these other hookup sites, and are going and meeting men they don't even know to get tied up!
[02:55:03.741 --> 02:55:05.302]  That's not a good idea!
[02:55:06.883 --> 02:55:10.324]  And yes, it's mainly men doing it to women.
[02:55:11.284 --> 02:55:13.445]  It's also butch women doing it to men.
[02:55:13.745 --> 02:55:14.906]  I'm just giving you the MO.
[02:55:15.286 --> 02:55:16.807]  And it's gay men doing it to gay men.
[02:55:17.587 --> 02:55:21.149]  But the point is, you're crazy if you go into one of these dungeons.
[02:55:21.209 --> 02:55:22.229]  You're nuts.
[02:55:22.689 --> 02:55:24.230]  Because it's all about, like, pedophilia.
[02:55:25.612 --> 02:55:36.155]  First, they want to make contact with your kid, then they want to test him and touch him a little, so if the kid reports that they can deny it, it's a feeder into a very dark, evil, twisted underworld.
[02:55:37.196 --> 02:55:43.958]  It's very, very satanic, and you don't want to get involved in it, young people or anybody else, okay?
[02:55:46.206 --> 02:55:52.132]  I mean, I remember like 15 years ago, my family has a long time gay friend that I've known since I was a kid.
[02:55:52.773 --> 02:56:07.087]  He died a few years ago, and he was a newspaper reporter, stuff like that, and I heard, you know, when he got into a bunch of stuff before he died, you know, this whole wild scene or whatever, and he was an older guy, that he was going to stuff like this and got hurt.
[02:56:08.468 --> 02:56:17.198]  So, the point is, ladies and gentlemen, this is real stuff, and this whole bondage thing isn't cute, it isn't funny, and Hollywood sells you it's sexy and it's cool.
[02:56:17.419 --> 02:56:22.244]  You got 13-year-old girls reading stuff like, uh, Fifty Shades of Grey.
[02:56:22.424 --> 02:56:24.367]  It's a load of garbage.
[02:56:26.135 --> 02:56:30.578]  All of it is hateful and bad and leads into a very, very evil place.
[02:56:31.198 --> 02:56:35.340]  Anything beyond... If your wife likes you, slap her on the rear end a couple times.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.942]  I think anything beyond that is evil.
[02:56:38.582 --> 02:56:39.162]  And it's bad.
[02:56:40.043 --> 02:56:41.684]  And... I'm just warning you.
[02:56:41.764 --> 02:56:42.144]  And I'm done.
[02:56:42.284 --> 02:56:45.406]  They'll say that's an anti-lesbian thing, because they want you to stay in it.
[02:56:45.586 --> 02:56:46.446]  They want fresh meat.
[02:56:46.506 --> 02:56:47.267]  They want to hurt you.
[02:56:47.867 --> 02:56:49.448]  The whole globalist satanic combine.
[02:56:49.628 --> 02:56:50.268]  So you've been warned.
[02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:51.329]  You've been warned.
[02:56:51.569 --> 02:56:52.790]  Now, I'm gonna stop right there.
[02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.751]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:56:55.822 --> 02:56:57.023]  We need financial support.

[02:57:01.887 --> 02:57:02.588]  It was a setup.

[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:25.386]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.446 --> 03:00:30.490]  Man, Paul Joseph Watson's coming up to quarterback this hour in the next segment, just six minutes away.
[03:00:31.611 --> 03:00:36.654]  You got Owen Schroer who's on fire, along with David Knight and others coming up today, three o'clock central.
[03:00:36.674 --> 03:00:42.178]  You can see Paul Watson there scanning the news, very wolf-like.
[03:00:44.449 --> 03:00:44.549]  Ah!
[03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:47.671]  Him there with the gun, me with the belt, feeding him, right Jack?
[03:00:49.032 --> 03:00:50.513]  So there's Paul Watson.
[03:00:50.853 --> 03:00:54.135]  We'll talk to Paul here in just a minute when he kicks off the transmission.
[03:00:54.615 --> 03:00:57.317]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen...
[03:00:59.636 --> 03:01:03.798]  Christmas is almost here, 2017, and it's hard to believe, isn't it?
[03:01:04.518 --> 03:01:11.501]  Hard to believe there's an open public war on Christmas, and there's a war on free speech, and there's a war on Western values, and there's a war on Christianity.
[03:01:11.521 --> 03:01:17.284]  They're taking down Christian symbols all over Europe, taking them out of churches here, taking the Red Cross off the Red Cross in Europe.
[03:01:18.248 --> 03:01:18.768]  It's amazing.
[03:01:19.109 --> 03:01:20.590]  And they're trying to shut down our free speech.
[03:01:20.610 --> 03:01:28.575]  But I tell you, folks are funding independent organizations like InfoWars by buying products directly from us, not just giving us donations.
[03:01:28.615 --> 03:01:34.519]  That way, you know you're getting a high-quality product that helps you, it's symbiotic, and you help us get the word out.
[03:01:34.559 --> 03:01:40.843]  And I've got something big I want to announce right now for the few weeks leading up to Christmas.
[03:01:41.464 --> 03:01:44.886]  If you order by the 19th, you've got guaranteed delivery by Christmas.

[03:04:22.778 --> 03:04:25.821]  You sign up for an account on the store by having an account.

[03:05:04.344 --> 03:05:13.673]  In a massive victory for President Trump, the Supreme Court has ruled that the White House's travel ban on individuals from terror-linked countries will go into full effect.
[03:05:13.933 --> 03:05:20.900]  The court granted the administration's request to lift two injunctions imposed by lower courts that have partially blocked the ban.
[03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:26.926]  This decision overrules those lower courts, who many have accused of playing politics by blocking the ban.
[03:05:27.406 --> 03:05:29.708]  This means people seeking to enter the U.S.
[03:05:29.808 --> 03:05:35.372]  from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Chad will now be barred from doing so.
[03:05:35.853 --> 03:05:40.616]  It's a good start, but it remains to be seen if more terror-linked countries will be added to the list.
[03:05:40.997 --> 03:05:43.238]  The travel ban is not a Muslim ban.
[03:05:43.499 --> 03:05:47.322]  Most of the countries with the highest Muslim population are not even on the list.
[03:05:47.802 --> 03:05:52.307]  Seven of the nine Supreme Court justices agreed with President Trump's travel ban.
[03:05:52.548 --> 03:05:58.835]  With the economy soaring and tax cuts on the way, President Trump can now check the travel ban off his Christmas wish list.
[03:06:16.428 --> 03:06:21.150]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.553 --> 03:06:27.433]  Oh my gosh!
[03:06:30.114 --> 03:06:31.135]  Ladies and gentlemen!
[03:06:32.936 --> 03:06:33.336]  Man!
[03:06:35.557 --> 03:06:38.138]  People talk about being overwhelmed or dizzy.
[03:06:40.339 --> 03:06:43.681]  I am literally just looking at all this news during the break
[03:06:44.918 --> 03:06:46.299]  I got dizzy for a minute.
[03:06:47.820 --> 03:06:58.706]  I mean, you've got Conyers leaving, you've got the fake Russia investigation, you've got all these Democrat FBI agents getting caught covering up for Hillary or the very ones lying about Flynn and Trump.
[03:06:59.426 --> 03:07:01.087]  You've got them just foaming at the mouth.
[03:07:01.147 --> 03:07:04.349]  You've got fake polls out saying Trump has horrible approval ratings.
[03:07:04.369 --> 03:07:13.074]  But if you go check with the big tech companies and the bots and the corporate numbers like we had during the election, Trump's even more popular and he's gotten the tax cuts almost through.
[03:07:14.295 --> 03:07:16.336]  You've got all this other craziness going on.
[03:07:17.116 --> 03:07:21.057]  The Supreme Court rules Trump travel ban to go into full effect.
[03:07:21.377 --> 03:07:22.437]  Totally constitutional.
[03:07:22.477 --> 03:07:23.938]  Another major victory.
[03:07:23.958 --> 03:07:30.659]  And then you've got them beating the drum that Trump's a total failure, his neck's going in the noose, and him and his whole operation are going to prison for life.
[03:07:31.220 --> 03:07:36.501]  This from the creepy, evil Mika Brzezinski and psycho Joe Scarborough.
[03:07:37.261 --> 03:07:39.642]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[03:07:39.682 --> 03:07:43.243]  And then we have former head of the NSA operations.
[03:07:44.571 --> 03:07:53.240]  The actual guy that ran it, head of technical, behind Snowden, movie, everything, laying out how they've totally tested it, it's all fake, it was from inside the U.S.
[03:07:53.280 --> 03:08:01.228]  government, there is no Russian involvement, the whole hack, WikiLeaks, all of it, we already knew that, but it's William Binney said he's about, what'd he say, next week?
[03:08:01.508 --> 03:08:02.750]  To publish the findings!
[03:08:03.050 --> 03:08:07.154]  You got the exclusive today about his meeting with Pompeo, the head of the CIA!
[03:08:09.127 --> 03:08:12.892]  I can't believe it when Benny was here having steaks and talking and all the stuff behind the scenes.
[03:08:12.952 --> 03:08:14.954]  I mean, this is a real James Bond movie, folks.
[03:08:15.455 --> 03:08:16.997]  And Paul Watson's really from England!
[03:08:17.598 --> 03:08:19.039]  He's our real Kingsman over there.
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:22.864]  Paul, stuff is just getting... This is so real, though.
[03:08:22.904 --> 03:08:23.946]  This isn't a simulation.
[03:08:24.246 --> 03:08:25.327]  We're in the real world.
[03:08:26.633 --> 03:08:31.955]  This is really happening, and the globalists are getting their butts kicked, but they are striking back.
[03:08:32.315 --> 03:08:33.316]  They are fighting back.
[03:08:33.716 --> 03:08:37.898]  What do you make of just this insanity on every front?
[03:08:37.958 --> 03:08:40.399]  And what do you think is really going on here, Paul?
[03:08:40.979 --> 03:08:42.680]  And where do you think this is going to go with Mueller?
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:50.303]  Well, it's what Mark Pantano pointed out this morning, and he's a former prosecutor.
[03:08:50.914 --> 03:08:54.415]  He thinks it's going and this matches up to what we've reported before.
[03:08:54.756 --> 03:09:00.038]  They're deliberately now going after Trump's financial transactions with Deutsche Bank from two decades ago.
[03:09:00.058 --> 03:09:06.680]  Okay, they were already investigating Russians who had rented and bought his apartment years and years ago.
[03:09:07.061 --> 03:09:12.843]  They're deliberately trying to trigger Trump to fire Mueller so then they can set off the impeachment
[03:09:13.243 --> 03:09:15.224]  And by the way, that's why the harassment is just gonna get...
[03:09:32.635 --> 03:09:33.296]  I totally agree.
[03:09:33.796 --> 03:09:35.898]  The harassment, this is harassment, this is stalking.
[03:09:36.239 --> 03:09:38.140]  The illegal, even CNN admits it's stalking.
[03:09:38.461 --> 03:09:41.624]  The total stalking is just going to intensify.
[03:09:41.644 --> 03:09:45.787]  And this weekend on Saturday Night Live, they look at the camera and they go, fire Mueller, Trump.
[03:09:46.108 --> 03:09:47.289]  I mean, that's what they want.
[03:09:47.329 --> 03:09:51.713]  They want, because they have nothing, there is nothing, and so they want him to fire Mueller.
[03:09:51.873 --> 03:09:55.596]  I don't think Trump's going to do it, because I've talked to folks behind the scenes that talked to the President.
[03:09:56.397 --> 03:09:57.798]  He's going for being mad about this?
[03:09:58.158 --> 03:09:59.419]  He's just saying, I don't care.
[03:09:59.660 --> 03:10:00.360]  There's nothing.
[03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:01.921]  They make something up, I don't care.
[03:10:01.981 --> 03:10:02.882]  Try to impeach me.
[03:10:03.222 --> 03:10:04.803]  Bring me into Congress, I'm ready.
[03:10:05.064 --> 03:10:06.385]  I mean, he just is sick of it.
[03:10:06.645 --> 03:10:07.986]  While the economy comes back.
[03:10:08.206 --> 03:10:10.067]  While our sovereignty comes back.
[03:10:10.548 --> 03:10:12.029]  I mean, it's just crazy, Paul.
[03:10:13.584 --> 03:10:15.925]  Well yeah, that's exactly what Trump should do.
[03:10:15.965 --> 03:10:17.305]  He should just let it fizzle out.
[03:10:17.365 --> 03:10:19.206]  Because that's where they want to bait the trap.
[03:10:19.246 --> 03:10:20.606]  They want to bait him into that.
[03:10:21.046 --> 03:10:25.727]  When the real thing that should be happening is that Mueller should be stepping down, as many prominent people are now saying.
[03:10:26.168 --> 03:10:29.609]  There's another big story just come out in the recent hour.
[03:10:30.069 --> 03:10:34.530]  A Mueller deputy praised DOJ official after she defied Trump travel ban order.
[03:10:35.010 --> 03:10:36.711]  Quote, I am so proud.
[03:10:37.131 --> 03:10:50.138]  So not only have they got this anti-Trump zealot leading the Russia investigation, at least close to the head of it, investigating Hillary Clinton's emails, watering down that charge against Hillary Clinton so she could avoid prison,
[03:10:50.698 --> 03:10:55.682]  It's completely littered with anti-Trump zealots and now another one's come out.
[03:10:56.062 --> 03:11:03.427]  It's what Trump said from the very beginning, this is a political witch hunt, all based around them wanting revenge for losing the election.
[03:11:03.787 --> 03:11:04.388]  That's it.
[03:11:04.888 --> 03:11:12.894]  Now tons of these individuals are coming out proving what we said all along, this is a political witch hunt, it's got nothing to do with Russian collusion.
[03:11:12.934 --> 03:11:14.535]  Now there's another one that's just come out.
[03:11:15.271 --> 03:11:17.153]  And they're literally- Mueller needs to go.
[03:11:17.313 --> 03:11:19.034]  They're anti-America globalists.
[03:11:19.074 --> 03:11:25.740]  They use illegal spying on Trump that just proves Trump did nothing wrong, but then still use that to indict Flynn.
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:28.002]  I mean, do they not know what this looks like?
[03:11:28.363 --> 03:11:31.045]  Or is it just like the election where they still think they're in power?
[03:11:31.325 --> 03:11:34.068]  Because, I mean, let me tell you, they've got to get in trouble now.
[03:11:34.848 --> 03:11:41.130]  And I understand Trump now more and more doesn't need to fire Mueller because it's blowing up in their face, but what about the rest of the Department of Justice?
[03:11:41.190 --> 03:11:51.174]  It's full of these Obama-Clinton era criminals that are just foaming at the mouth criminals, covering up Russia, selling us out, hating America.
[03:11:51.294 --> 03:11:53.035]  I mean, this is... I want them arrested.
[03:11:53.995 --> 03:11:56.416]  They're completely caught red-handed, man!
[03:11:56.996 --> 03:11:59.877]  And I'm calling for long prison sentences, man.
[03:11:59.897 --> 03:12:01.278]  I mean, these people are sick.
[03:12:02.967 --> 03:12:07.310]  Well, they spied on American citizens when they wiretapped Trump's campaign.
[03:12:07.350 --> 03:12:08.070]  That's criminal.
[03:12:08.170 --> 03:12:10.031]  People have got to go to prison for this.
[03:12:10.511 --> 03:12:16.155]  From the very beginning, immediately after the inauguration, we know they set up war rooms near the White House.
[03:12:16.175 --> 03:12:18.876]  They actually wanted Obama to lead the resistance.
[03:12:18.916 --> 03:12:20.717]  He wasn't really interested in doing that.
[03:12:20.757 --> 03:12:23.019]  That's why he's kind of disappeared into the background.
[03:12:23.059 --> 03:12:26.361]  He'll come back, give speeches during the midterms and in 2020.
[03:12:26.661 --> 03:12:30.263]  Yeah, he's smartly sitting on the sidelines waiting to come in as an opportunist.
[03:12:31.192 --> 03:12:40.014]  Yeah, but they set this up from the very beginning, so it's no surprise this was about delegitimising President Trump, derailing his agenda.
[03:12:40.334 --> 03:12:49.316]  It hasn't worked to a large extent, of course, because yesterday even Michael Moore came out and said, listen, don't be naive in thinking that this is stopping Trump's agenda.
[03:12:49.556 --> 03:12:51.336]  He's getting a lot of his agenda done.
[03:12:51.796 --> 03:13:01.098]  No greater endorsement than that coming from Michael Moore, who's literally tried to get Democrats to invoke national emergencies to install Hillary as a dictator.
[03:13:01.118 --> 03:13:01.879]  That's another question I have.
[03:13:01.899 --> 03:13:05.721]  Now even he's losing a bit of faith and saying, no actually, Trump's getting stuff done.
[03:13:05.741 --> 03:13:06.782]  The economy's roaring.
[03:13:07.102 --> 03:13:08.643]  We got the travel ban back in.
[03:13:08.963 --> 03:13:10.765]  We got the tax cuts coming down the line.
[03:13:11.205 --> 03:13:25.915]  And it's looking a lot better for him going into the new year, which is why they need to ramp up this, again, hysteria, which will get the never-Trumpers and some of those establishment Republicans back on board for this impeachment push if they bait him into filing Mueller, which he shouldn't do.
[03:13:26.235 --> 03:13:34.698]  And I agree with you, and Roger Stone's always giving me good info and he's a smart guy, but he keeps thinking Fire Mueller because he thinks the fake indictment is going to hurt Trump.
[03:13:34.818 --> 03:13:39.179]  Let them have a fake indictment by the kangaroo court out of the DC swamp.
[03:13:39.259 --> 03:13:43.060]  Let the swamp monsters, you know, sit there and make up some crud.
[03:13:43.220 --> 03:13:44.701]  Make it up about me, it's a total joke!
[03:13:45.021 --> 03:13:53.065]  Because they're still not going to get the impeachment in the House, and then just let how they're all working for Hillary, and how they're the ones with Russian collusion, just let them do it.
[03:13:53.425 --> 03:13:57.667]  It'd be like having Hitler at the Nuremberg trial, sentencing other Nazis to death.
[03:13:57.768 --> 03:14:00.309]  I mean, I think, let them just have their big fiasco.
[03:14:02.102 --> 03:14:04.243]  No, precisely, because they've got no legal precedent.
[03:14:04.283 --> 03:14:06.764]  It wasn't obstruction of justice to fire Comey.
[03:14:06.784 --> 03:14:09.025]  It was perfectly within Trump's remit.
[03:14:09.345 --> 03:14:11.886]  There's no precedent for that whatsoever matching up.
[03:14:12.226 --> 03:14:16.908]  So the law, the legal precedent's on Trump's side, but they need to create this hysteria.
[03:14:17.149 --> 03:14:20.150]  But now the Wall Street Journal editorial board has come out
[03:14:20.450 --> 03:14:20.811]  I think so.
[03:14:42.034 --> 03:14:43.216]  Going into the new year.
[03:14:43.236 --> 03:14:43.556]  I agree.
[03:14:43.576 --> 03:14:51.785]  And the weight of that pressure looks like it could derail this entire investigation, which is going nowhere because they've got no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:14:52.205 --> 03:14:59.714]  They pulled a fake news stunt that got Brian Ross fired, claiming that they were in contact with the Russians before the election.
[03:15:00.275 --> 03:15:01.477]  Absolute chaos.
[03:15:01.537 --> 03:15:02.900]  It's blown up in their face.
[03:15:03.381 --> 03:15:06.968]  It's discredited their own investigation and they need to wind it down.
[03:15:07.188 --> 03:15:12.117]  We need to investigate the real criminals who spied on Flynn and all the others against the law.
[03:15:12.745 --> 03:15:13.606]  Paul, you're taking over.
[03:15:13.646 --> 03:15:14.627]  It's amazing hearing you on air.
[03:15:14.647 --> 03:15:16.289]  I wish I could get you to host more than a few hours a week.
[03:15:16.609 --> 03:15:18.231]  It's an incredible breakdown.
[03:15:18.811 --> 03:15:26.360]  And look, a lot of Nebra Trumpers are now having to go ahead and just join with Prosperity and Americana and realizing, why scuttle a recovery?
[03:15:26.420 --> 03:15:27.621]  Why do this to their kids?
[03:15:28.081 --> 03:15:28.402]  Why?
[03:15:28.782 --> 03:15:33.047]  And plus, it's going to cause a political civil war that destroys all of them.
[03:15:35.038 --> 03:15:36.459]  Politically, maybe even more.
[03:15:36.519 --> 03:15:39.462]  I mean, they can look at the tea leaves and a few levels ahead.
[03:15:39.942 --> 03:15:40.583]  Don't do this!
[03:15:40.683 --> 03:15:41.143]  Give up!
[03:15:41.263 --> 03:15:41.644]  Stop!
[03:15:41.964 --> 03:15:43.565]  Globalism's burning down everywhere!
[03:15:43.625 --> 03:15:44.666]  The New World Order's in trouble!
[03:15:45.167 --> 03:15:45.607]  Sorry!
[03:15:45.867 --> 03:15:46.688]  We're kicking your butt!
[03:15:47.428 --> 03:15:48.329]  You want to keep getting it?
[03:15:48.369 --> 03:15:53.193]  Looks like the, you know, the knight that says, he's got his arms and legs cut off, and he says, stop fighting me!
[03:15:53.213 --> 03:15:54.895]  And he says, it's merely a flesh wound!
[03:15:55.235 --> 03:15:56.356]  No, it's not a flesh wound!
[03:15:56.576 --> 03:15:57.837]  We have laid your ass out!
[03:15:58.157 --> 03:15:59.318]  Paul Watson takes over!
[03:15:59.358 --> 03:15:59.779]  Stay with us!
[03:16:03.214 --> 03:16:13.044]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[03:16:13.864 --> 03:16:23.233]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[03:16:23.654 --> 03:16:26.617]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[03:16:27.197 --> 03:16:36.891]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[03:16:37.352 --> 03:16:42.539]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[03:16:43.620 --> 03:16:45.341]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[03:16:45.401 --> 03:16:46.341]  It's a limited edition.
[03:16:46.901 --> 03:16:48.881]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[03:16:49.102 --> 03:16:55.843]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[03:16:56.183 --> 03:17:00.384]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[03:17:00.604 --> 03:17:02.105]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[03:17:02.845 --> 03:17:08.187]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[03:17:08.487 --> 03:17:17.291]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[03:17:17.711 --> 03:17:21.873]  And on the back, Infowars.com is the standard of real news.
[03:17:22.373 --> 03:17:23.474]  And of course, this classic?
[03:17:24.174 --> 03:17:24.774]  Says it all.
[03:17:24.874 --> 03:17:25.755]  Need I say more?
[03:17:26.255 --> 03:17:27.855]  You want to have a political message out there?
[03:17:27.915 --> 03:17:33.677]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[03:17:33.937 --> 03:17:37.078]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[03:17:37.538 --> 03:17:43.100]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:46.163]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[03:17:46.484 --> 03:17:54.875]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[03:17:55.156 --> 03:17:58.720]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[03:17:59.541 --> 03:18:09.010]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[03:18:09.150 --> 03:18:11.653]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[03:18:12.013 --> 03:18:13.114]  InfoWars.com.
[03:18:13.134 --> 03:18:13.635]  Spread the word.
[03:18:14.375 --> 03:18:15.496]  I designed this baby.
[03:18:15.556 --> 03:18:17.997]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[03:18:18.378 --> 03:18:22.620]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:18:23.020 --> 03:18:26.843]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[03:18:27.283 --> 03:18:29.965]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[03:18:29.985 --> 03:18:31.385]  It's been around about 19 years.
[03:18:32.006 --> 03:18:35.608]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[03:18:35.888 --> 03:18:43.433]  And of course, we've seen the NFL taking a knee during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[03:18:44.193 --> 03:18:45.094]  That's disrespectful.
[03:18:45.114 --> 03:18:49.120]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:56.631]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[03:18:57.051 --> 03:18:58.493]  Our republic is in distress.
[03:18:58.974 --> 03:18:59.434]  Ask me why.
[03:19:00.095 --> 03:19:02.016]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[03:19:02.176 --> 03:19:07.658]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[03:19:08.159 --> 03:19:09.639]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[03:19:09.699 --> 03:19:12.700]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[03:19:13.141 --> 03:19:15.282]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[03:19:15.922 --> 03:19:18.163]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[03:19:18.863 --> 03:19:19.645]  It's all about freedom.
[03:19:19.685 --> 03:19:21.027]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[03:19:21.568 --> 03:19:22.469]  Resist Tyranny.
[03:19:23.130 --> 03:19:24.112]  Made in America.
[03:19:24.132 --> 03:19:24.112]  1776.
[03:19:24.753 --> 03:19:27.838]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[03:19:28.058 --> 03:19:29.019]  The backs are really cool.
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:30.061]  Look at that back.
[03:19:30.101 --> 03:19:31.023]  That is pure Americana.
[03:19:32.242 --> 03:19:37.385]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited-edition ball caps available.
[03:19:37.505 --> 03:19:38.205]  The Dayglo.
[03:19:38.686 --> 03:19:42.828]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[03:19:42.948 --> 03:19:44.569]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[03:19:44.949 --> 03:19:46.270]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[03:19:46.290 --> 03:19:47.530]  It's got the nice patch.
[03:19:47.891 --> 03:19:48.931]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:49.171 --> 03:19:50.052]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[03:19:50.312 --> 03:19:53.754]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[03:19:54.154 --> 03:19:55.735]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[03:19:55.975 --> 03:20:00.478]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:20:04.938 --> 03:20:11.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.862 --> 03:20:19.043]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.563 --> 03:20:24.685]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:20:28.723 --> 03:20:29.183]  We're live.
[03:20:29.223 --> 03:20:32.484]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday edition.
[03:20:32.564 --> 03:20:34.044]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:34.084 --> 03:20:47.027]  We were talking with Alex before the break about the latest developments in the Russian collusion investigation, which has discovered exactly zero evidence of Russian collusion over the course of the past, what, almost year it's been going.
[03:20:47.547 --> 03:20:50.047]  Now we have this headline out of Fox News again.
[03:20:50.407 --> 03:20:53.108]  Another anti-Trump zealot involved
[03:20:53.568 --> 03:20:57.469]  Near the head of this investigation, this has been completely compromised.
[03:20:57.549 --> 03:20:58.510]  It needs to be shut down.
[03:20:58.930 --> 03:21:00.250]  Mueller needs to step down.
[03:21:00.770 --> 03:21:01.471]  Now we have this.
[03:21:01.531 --> 03:21:05.972]  Mueller deputy praised DOJ official after she defied Trump travel ban order.
[03:21:06.372 --> 03:21:08.693]  Well, I am so proud!
[03:21:09.477 --> 03:21:22.421]  Top prosecutor who is now a deputy for special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe praised then acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she was fired in January by President Trump for refusing to defend his controversial travel ban.
[03:21:22.861 --> 03:21:28.003]  The email obtained by Judicial Watch through a federal lawsuit shows that on the night of January 30th,
[03:21:29.036 --> 03:21:30.397]  Which is when the ban got shot down.
[03:21:30.857 --> 03:21:40.502]  Andrew Wiseman wrote to Yates under the subject line, I am so proud, he continued, and in awe, thank you so much, all my deepest respects.
[03:21:41.002 --> 03:21:53.728]  The disclosure follows confirmation that another Mueller investigator, FBI official Peter Strzok, was fired over the summer after allegedly sending anti-Trump texts to an FBI lawyer with whom he was romantically involved.
[03:21:54.332 --> 03:21:57.516]  Well, he was actually married and having an extramarital affair with her.
[03:21:58.017 --> 03:21:59.239]  But yet another one!
[03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:04.305]  Proving that this investigation has been compromised.
[03:22:04.346 --> 03:22:08.992]  It is exactly what President Trump said it was right from the very beginning.
[03:22:09.599 --> 03:22:10.559]  That's all it was about.
[03:22:10.579 --> 03:22:15.460]  Now it's gone way beyond even the question of Russian collusion, given that they've got no evidence of it.
[03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:22.042]  Tried to claim that Flynn was told to contact the Russians before the election even took place, because that turned out to be completely fake news.
[03:22:39.881 --> 03:22:40.662]  They've got nothing.
[03:22:41.182 --> 03:22:48.270]  They're now going back through Trump's two-decade-old transactions with mortgages with Deutsche Bank to try and dig something up.
[03:22:48.350 --> 03:22:52.515]  Again, it's not about finding Russian collusion because there isn't any.
[03:22:52.915 --> 03:22:57.320]  It's about finding anything on which to hang Trump and his administration.
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:58.181]  Anything.
[03:22:58.601 --> 03:23:00.303]  Remember, months ago they were going through
[03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:05.650]  Apartments that Trump had rented out to Russians ten years ago.
[03:23:06.090 --> 03:23:07.890]  Like, that was evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:23:08.170 --> 03:23:14.491]  So if I rent a flat off some Russian here in London, that must mean I'm colluding with the Russians, right?
[03:23:15.051 --> 03:23:18.752]  If I go on RT network or whatever, I'm colluding with them.
[03:23:18.772 --> 03:23:19.972]  Just talking to a Russian.
[03:23:20.232 --> 03:23:21.413]  Knowing a Russian now.
[03:23:22.593 --> 03:23:24.553]  Having known a Russian in the past, maybe.
[03:23:25.113 --> 03:23:29.734]  You know, you go into a shop and buy a cup of coffee from a Russian, you're colluding with the Russians.
[03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:32.362]  That's basically how ridiculous it is.
[03:23:32.762 --> 03:23:39.489]  How on earth can you link meddling in the election, hacking the election, which is, remember, what they started off with.
[03:23:39.949 --> 03:23:41.230]  How can you compare that?
[03:23:41.611 --> 03:23:42.772]  That's what they started off with.
[03:23:42.832 --> 03:23:47.536]  Now at the end of it, they've come out with, oh, Trump may have rented out an apartment to a Russian.
[03:23:47.977 --> 03:23:49.318]  Bombshell evidence.
[03:23:50.619 --> 03:23:51.821]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:23:51.861 --> 03:23:55.184]  And that is why, as we have up on Infowars.com right now,
[03:23:55.982 --> 03:24:07.068]  Many are calling for the Russian collusion investigation to be shut down, amongst them Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton, who said that it's been compromised basically beyond reproach.
[03:24:07.108 --> 03:24:17.534]  We've also got, let me read the article here, we got Fitton of Judicial Watch obviously went on with Tucker Carlson last night, said it's been compromised, you can't rescue it now.
[03:24:17.775 --> 03:24:19.996]  We had Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt
[03:24:20.566 --> 03:24:33.376]  He wrote an article for the Washington Post in which he called the Strzok bombshell a blockbuster revelation carrying the possibility of shattering public confidence in a number of long-held assumptions about the criminal justice system.
[03:24:33.916 --> 03:24:40.221]  He said the Justice Department should quote, appoint a special counsel to investigate Strzok's actions as soon as possible.
[03:24:41.095 --> 03:24:52.163]  Ben Shapiro said, quote, so the same anti-Trump agent signed the opening of the Russia investigation, changed the language on Comey's Hillary investigation to avoid her criminality.
[03:24:52.723 --> 03:24:54.224]  Remember, he watered it down.
[03:24:55.145 --> 03:25:08.034]  So it was just carelessness, not actual covering up of the fact that she was leaking all this sensitive information through her emails with Anthony Weiner having access to them, the paedophile.
[03:25:08.928 --> 03:25:17.770]  So he was involved in that, he was involved in setting up the Russia investigation to begin with, and of course he was involved, he was the guy who interviewed Michael Flynn.
[03:25:18.010 --> 03:25:22.050]  He also interviewed, was it, Huma Abedin and other Clinton officials.
[03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:24.711]  They lied to the FBI, but that doesn't count.
[03:25:24.731 --> 03:25:26.531]  Just forget about that, that doesn't count.
[03:25:27.111 --> 03:25:30.192]  Because again, all the people heading it up are Clintonites.
[03:25:30.612 --> 03:25:33.672]  This is completely biased, they're anti-Trump zealots.
[03:25:34.132 --> 03:25:36.193]  This is why it needs to be shut down.
[03:25:36.713 --> 03:25:38.233]  Again, as I mentioned earlier to Alex,
[03:25:39.184 --> 03:25:44.209]  Former prosecutor Mark Pantano now believes that Neiller is trying to get fired.
[03:25:44.810 --> 03:25:50.196]  He's trying to get fired by being so invasive going into Trump's financial history.
[03:25:50.596 --> 03:25:55.982]  Because remember, that's the one thing that Trump at the very beginning said, told them not to do.
[03:25:56.002 --> 03:25:57.784]  So they're literally trying to get
[03:25:58.436 --> 03:26:06.884]  Trump triggered to the point where he fires Mueller and sparks this constitutional crisis, which leads to the attempt to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:26:07.265 --> 03:26:08.846]  They're trying to make him angry.
[03:26:09.207 --> 03:26:11.129]  They're trying to pot prod the bear.
[03:26:11.669 --> 03:26:13.451]  So he lashes out and fires Mueller.
[03:26:13.491 --> 03:26:18.256]  That's exactly what Mueller wants, according to former prosecutor Mark Pantano.
[03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:28.597]  He says, quote, having obviously found no evidence of Trump colluding with Russia to illegally influence the vote, it appears that Mueller is now investigating other aspects of Trump's life.
[03:26:29.538 --> 03:26:38.404]  Again, they want to get anything on him, anything to hang him with, anything to keep him under this cloud because they've got no actual evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:26:38.924 --> 03:26:46.510]  He continues, completely outside the bounds of his mandate in order to find anything which can be used as the basis for impeaching the president.
[03:26:47.515 --> 03:26:58.759]  Having found no crimes related to Russia, might it be that Mueller is attempting to get President Trump to fire him in hopes that Congress will impeach Trump for obstruction of justice?
[03:26:59.359 --> 03:27:04.121]  Now, of course, it doesn't mean that they're going to make it successful, but at least it gives them an in to try that.
[03:27:04.141 --> 03:27:12.044]  Of course, Dershowitz was on Fox News yesterday, the Harvard law professor, saying that nothing Trump has done amounts to obstruction of justice.
[03:27:12.064 --> 03:27:13.785]  There's no historical precedent
[03:27:14.645 --> 03:27:22.291]  For any of his actions representing obstruction of justice, he was perfectly within his constitutional right to fire Comey.
[03:27:23.067 --> 03:27:31.211]  Of course, that was related to the fact that Comey refused to publicly state that Trump himself personally was not under investigation.
[03:27:31.271 --> 03:27:35.252]  It wasn't to do with the fact of Flynn lying to the FBI.
[03:27:35.292 --> 03:27:36.633]  So there's no evidence of that.
[03:27:37.073 --> 03:27:45.517]  But again, they want to create this crisis atmosphere to try and convince some of those never Trump Republicans and other Republicans in the GOP establishment
[03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:55.087]  To drop the hammer and to go along with the impeachment after the 2018 midterms when the Democrats of course hope to win back some of those seats.
[03:27:55.687 --> 03:28:08.998]  Not that they're probably going to do so because again they have no actual policy platform apart from relentless hysteria about Donald Trump and Russia, about Donald Trump and racism, about Donald Trump and misogyny.
[03:28:09.662 --> 03:28:16.348]  But again, if they can whip up enough of an atmosphere of chaos and crisis and hysteria, who knows?
[03:28:16.808 --> 03:28:34.323]  They might have a chance of at least attempting to impeach Donald Trump, put his administration on the back foot and use that as a bulwark to stop him advancing with his policy agenda, which he has started to make accomplishments with, of course, in the recent few months, especially with the tax cuts coming up.
[03:28:35.284 --> 03:28:36.365]  So that's what they want to do.
[03:28:36.525 --> 03:28:37.886]  They're trying to get
[03:28:38.732 --> 03:28:40.853]  Into a position where Trump fires Mueller.
[03:28:40.893 --> 03:28:42.093]  Mueller wants to be fired.
[03:28:42.934 --> 03:28:46.775]  That's the direction they're heading in this Russian investigation.
[03:28:47.515 --> 03:28:48.656]  Most people don't know about it.
[03:28:48.696 --> 03:28:51.096]  They need to know about it because this is serious business.
[03:28:51.397 --> 03:28:57.579]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show to talk about Meryl Streep's rampant hypocrisy.
[03:28:57.679 --> 03:28:58.239]  Don't go away.
[03:29:03.806 --> 03:29:07.229]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:29:07.589 --> 03:29:14.714]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:29:15.314 --> 03:29:23.720]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:30.565]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[03:29:30.725 --> 03:29:31.085]  We're good to go.

[03:31:23.197 --> 03:31:30.462]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:31:30.762 --> 03:31:30.962]  Woo!
[03:31:31.002 --> 03:31:31.922]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:32.043 --> 03:31:40.646]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:40.786 --> 03:31:50.010]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:50.370 --> 03:31:53.711]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:53.831 --> 03:31:57.773]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:31:57.933 --> 03:31:58.833]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:31:59.014 --> 03:31:59.854]  Check it out right now.
[03:32:00.094 --> 03:32:01.215]  We're good to go.
[03:32:31.075 --> 03:32:34.758]  And that's a key thing in terms of natural death, in terms of life expectancy.
[03:32:35.558 --> 03:32:41.964]  I take DNA Force every day, and it's 33% off right now at InfoWars Store.
[03:32:42.104 --> 03:32:53.253]  Of course, we are live for 10 hours every weekday, starting with David Knight in the morning, all the way through the conclusion of the War Room, with the Alex Jones Show sandwiched in between there, four hours of it.

[03:33:04.713 --> 03:33:09.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.019 --> 03:33:22.802]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.042 --> 03:33:26.744]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:29.215 --> 03:33:29.715]  We're live!
[03:33:29.795 --> 03:33:32.176]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.216 --> 03:33:41.159]  Before we get back into the news, talking about Meryl Streep's rampant hypocrisy, I want to tell you about some of the great specials at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:41.579 --> 03:33:49.982]  Because of course, as I was talking about with the Russia investigation, basically the past year has been the left viciously striking back in revenge
[03:33:50.382 --> 03:33:52.223]  Against the fact that they lost the election.
[03:33:52.603 --> 03:34:00.627]  Now, much of that has taken the form of vitriolic character assassinations, but it's also taken the form of financial attacks.
[03:34:01.068 --> 03:34:02.288]  You've seen the boycotts.
[03:34:02.688 --> 03:34:09.452]  You've seen the hedge funds pulling out as a result of these witch hunt mobs that go after people's foundation source of income.
[03:34:09.472 --> 03:34:11.213]  You've seen them go after the advertisers.
[03:34:11.953 --> 03:34:18.278]  On Sean Hannity's show and other shows, you've seen them go after people with giant, frivolous lawsuits.
[03:34:18.358 --> 03:34:19.679]  The attack is constant.
[03:34:20.039 --> 03:34:20.979]  It's intensive.
[03:34:21.740 --> 03:34:35.049]  They don't play by the rules, which is why we need your support to fend off these kind of attacks, to survive and thrive by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com, which are on special offer, including DNA Force, which is 33% off.

[03:35:53.235 --> 03:35:55.436]  You normally buy them tat that they don't even want.
[03:35:56.156 --> 03:35:58.016]  Sometimes it goes in the bin the next day.
[03:35:58.377 --> 03:35:59.317]  What's the point in that?
[03:35:59.952 --> 03:36:04.633]  While thousands of people storm the malls and stampede into department stores, we have the perfect choice for you.
[03:36:05.234 --> 03:36:10.735]  I've decided to buy our in-flow store digital gift cards on sale for 10% off with a coupon code BONUS.
[03:36:11.255 --> 03:36:11.916]  That's BONUS.
[03:36:12.496 --> 03:36:16.017]  So that you can get your friends and family the gifted choice with hundreds of incredible products.
[03:36:17.350 --> 03:36:21.274]  There you can select the different amounts.
[03:36:21.835 --> 03:36:23.336]  $25, $50, $100, $150, whatever you want.

[03:36:26.159 --> 03:36:26.860]  It looks great.
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:27.540]  It's a great gift.
[03:36:27.580 --> 03:36:36.770]  And then people can buy what they actually want for themselves rather than getting something they don't want that they either get rid of or they just hand off to somebody else.
[03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:40.013]  So that is the InfoWars Store e-gift card again.
[03:36:40.632 --> 03:36:41.652]  That's a new introduction.
[03:36:41.712 --> 03:36:42.713]  It's got seven reviews.
[03:36:42.733 --> 03:36:46.954]  They're all five-star by the looks of it, so people are very happy with that service.
[03:36:47.474 --> 03:36:51.775]  Infowars Store e-gift card at infowarsstore.com.
[03:36:51.795 --> 03:36:54.216]  There you see the seven five-star reviews.
[03:36:54.376 --> 03:36:55.736]  We don't make them up, folks.
[03:36:55.876 --> 03:36:57.837]  It's an independent review system.
[03:36:58.117 --> 03:36:59.537]  They come in independently.
[03:36:59.897 --> 03:37:01.158]  We throw them up on the website.
[03:37:01.198 --> 03:37:04.899]  People are happy with that product, as they are with all the others, given the
[03:37:05.339 --> 03:37:20.958]  Routinely high reviews that all these products receive, even in the face of the mainstream media, which again goes back to how I introduced this, trying to undermine, trying to sabotage the financial basis of our entire operation.
[03:37:21.536 --> 03:37:28.278]  See, they can't do it by threatening our advertisers because we don't really have any outside advertisers, at least not for InfoWars.
[03:37:28.638 --> 03:37:30.619]  It's all in-house.
[03:37:30.679 --> 03:37:33.600]  So they can't get us that way and they really hate that.
[03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:42.263]  So instead, they have to attack the products themselves by claiming either they're a rip-off or they contain ingredients that shouldn't be in there.
[03:37:42.283 --> 03:37:43.003]  It hasn't worked.
[03:37:43.423 --> 03:37:47.804]  BuzzFeed did a huge investigation and found that it was all completely clean.
[03:37:47.824 --> 03:37:49.165]  It actually helped us.
[03:37:49.873 --> 03:37:52.174]  That's why we've got all those five-star reviews.
[03:37:52.494 --> 03:37:55.715]  Happy customers at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:37:57.475 --> 03:37:58.595]  Now let's get back to the news.
[03:37:58.635 --> 03:38:02.176]  This is probably going to bleed into the next segment because I want to cover this in depth.
[03:38:03.296 --> 03:38:09.118]  There was a Hollywood Reporter article up today and it was a top story on DrudgeReport.com for a while earlier today.
[03:38:09.138 --> 03:38:13.099]  And in this Hollywood Reporter article, which is about, there you see the picture,
[03:38:13.863 --> 03:38:15.464]  It's her and Steven Spielberg.
[03:38:15.484 --> 03:38:20.388]  They're doing a movie about Katherine Graham, the former, I think it was the owner of the Washington Post.
[03:38:21.069 --> 03:38:24.031]  And of course, it's all dressed in this feminist rhetoric.
[03:38:24.071 --> 03:38:30.056]  If you scroll down there, they say it's Spielberg's post-feminism in the tweet I sent out earlier.
[03:38:30.660 --> 03:38:37.325]  They say in this article that, you know, amidst all the sexual attacks on women, this is what we need to be talking about.
[03:38:37.345 --> 03:38:43.169]  This is the kind of feminist movie, with Meryl Streep fronting it, that we really want to see be a success.
[03:38:43.690 --> 03:38:58.000]  Well, there's an article up on Infowars.com which went up about an hour ago, by yours truly, it's called, does feminist, feminist in quotation marks, Meryl Streep still support child rapist and sex abuser Roman Polanski?
[03:38:59.068 --> 03:39:07.793]  Meryl Streep tells The Hollywood Reporter in this article, that's their cover article for December, quote, Now let's not forget, Roman Polanski admitted raping a 13-year-old girl.
[03:39:27.682 --> 03:39:28.782]  Back in 1977.
[03:39:29.123 --> 03:39:36.565]  That isn't the only accusation by any means against Roman Polanski, and in fact I go through them in this article.
[03:39:37.686 --> 03:39:42.988]  There's seven new accusations today on top of four that already existed.
[03:39:43.048 --> 03:39:48.610]  So you had Polanski, of course a famous director, drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.
[03:39:49.370 --> 03:39:53.372]  You had German actress RenÃ©e Langer come out recently
[03:39:54.241 --> 03:39:57.582]  And accusing Polanski of raping her twice when she was 15.
[03:39:58.703 --> 03:40:05.165]  Another woman came out called Robin M and she accused the director of sexually assaulting her when she was 16.
[03:40:05.706 --> 03:40:09.907]  Actress Charlotte Lewis also said Polanski sexually abused her when she was 16.
[03:40:10.007 --> 03:40:17.751]  So these were the accusations bearing in mind one he's admitted to and that's why he's a fugitive because he admitted to raping a 13 year old girl.
[03:40:17.991 --> 03:40:20.912]  That's why he can't come back into the United States or he'd be arrested.
[03:40:21.532 --> 03:40:24.333]  Those were the existing accusations on top of the admission.
[03:40:25.053 --> 03:40:29.115]  Now, Polanski has been accused of sexually abusing a string of women and children.
[03:40:29.175 --> 03:40:30.816]  These are new accusations.
[03:40:31.236 --> 03:40:35.457]  Seven new accusations in total, bringing the total number of claims against him to eleven.
[03:40:36.198 --> 03:40:43.661]  One of the new accusers, Marion Bernard, claims that Polanski molested her on a beach in Malibu when she was just ten years old.
[03:40:44.021 --> 03:40:44.461]  Ten!
[03:40:45.541 --> 03:40:48.622]  Mallory Millett says Polanski attempted to rape her in 1970 when she was 29.
[03:40:50.555 --> 03:40:54.678]  So Roman Polanski has admittedly raped children.
[03:40:55.079 --> 03:40:57.400]  Now women are accusing him of raping them.
[03:40:57.901 --> 03:41:03.165]  Other women have come out and said that he raped them when they were basically children, in one case 15 years old.
[03:41:03.725 --> 03:41:08.289]  Roman Polanski is a fugitive, paedophile, child molester.
[03:41:08.929 --> 03:41:13.873]  What does Hollywood and what does Meryl Streep have to say about Roman Polanski?
[03:41:14.213 --> 03:41:19.637]  Bearing in mind they haven't walked any of this back over the past 15 years.
[03:41:20.038 --> 03:41:22.940]  In fact, every time they're asked they only double down on it.
[03:41:23.540 --> 03:41:25.642]  Let's go back and we have a video here.
[03:41:26.619 --> 03:41:27.420]  I don't think so.
[03:41:43.786 --> 03:41:45.267]  Oh, we didn't really know about anything.
[03:41:45.987 --> 03:41:46.868]  We would have blown the whistle.
[03:41:46.888 --> 03:41:47.869]  We didn't really know about it.
[03:41:48.269 --> 03:41:55.894]  In 2003, they all knew Roman Polanski had raped a child because he admitted to it decades earlier.
[03:41:56.214 --> 03:41:57.235]  They all knew.
[03:41:57.755 --> 03:42:06.661]  In 2003, they gave him an Oscar and a standing ovation, including Meryl Streep at the Academy Awards in 2003.
[03:42:06.701 --> 03:42:07.361]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:42:10.345 --> 03:42:20.492]  From the very beginning, when all the arts and sciences of motion pictures bring movies to life, it is the director who gives them their pulse.
[03:42:21.853 --> 03:42:25.655]  And here are the nominees for the 75th achievement in directing.
[03:42:29.698 --> 03:42:33.520]  Awarding Roman Polanski a known child molester with an Oscar.
[03:42:35.603 --> 03:42:38.565]  For Gangs of New York, Martin Scorsese.
[03:42:38.585 --> 03:42:43.467]  Wait for it, he's coming up.
[03:42:43.507 --> 03:42:45.208]  For the pianist, Roman Polanski.
[03:42:46.529 --> 03:42:46.669]  Oh!
[03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:51.191]  Admitted child rapist, nominated for the Oscar.
[03:42:51.231 --> 03:42:52.752]  Who do you think is going to win the Oscar?
[03:42:55.293 --> 03:42:55.954]  Who's going to win it?
[03:42:55.974 --> 03:42:59.435]  We'll find out after the break.
[03:42:59.455 --> 03:43:01.757]  Stay tuned to find out who wins the Oscar.
[03:43:01.797 --> 03:43:02.297]  We'll be back.
[03:43:03.797 --> 03:43:13.605]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[03:43:14.446 --> 03:43:23.814]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[03:43:24.234 --> 03:43:27.197]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[03:43:27.777 --> 03:43:37.461]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[03:43:37.941 --> 03:43:43.123]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[03:43:44.203 --> 03:43:45.924]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[03:43:45.984 --> 03:43:46.924]  It's a limited edition.
[03:43:47.484 --> 03:43:49.464]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[03:43:49.705 --> 03:43:56.426]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[03:43:56.766 --> 03:44:00.947]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[03:44:01.187 --> 03:44:03.108]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows are
[03:44:03.428 --> 03:44:08.790]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:17.894]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[03:44:18.294 --> 03:44:22.456]  And on the back, Infowars.com is the standard of real news.
[03:44:22.956 --> 03:44:24.057]  And of course, this classic?
[03:44:24.617 --> 03:44:25.358]  It says it all.
[03:44:25.458 --> 03:44:26.339]  Need I say more?
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:28.461]  You want to have a political message out there?
[03:44:28.501 --> 03:44:34.267]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[03:44:34.608 --> 03:44:37.651]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[03:44:38.132 --> 03:44:43.697]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[03:44:44.418 --> 03:44:46.760]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:55.467]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[03:44:55.727 --> 03:44:59.290]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[03:45:00.131 --> 03:45:09.605]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe, or Come and Take It, in good old-fashioned English, t-shirts.
[03:45:09.745 --> 03:45:12.229]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[03:45:12.610 --> 03:45:13.711]  InfoWars.com.
[03:45:13.731 --> 03:45:14.232]  Spread the word.
[03:45:14.973 --> 03:45:16.074]  I designed this baby.
[03:45:16.154 --> 03:45:18.575]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[03:45:18.955 --> 03:45:23.217]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:45:23.618 --> 03:45:27.400]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[03:45:27.860 --> 03:45:30.581]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[03:45:30.601 --> 03:45:31.982]  It's been around about 19 years.
[03:45:32.602 --> 03:45:36.184]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[03:45:36.464 --> 03:45:39.566]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee
[03:45:40.467 --> 03:45:44.070]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[03:45:44.791 --> 03:45:45.672]  That's disrespectful.
[03:45:45.692 --> 03:45:49.716]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[03:45:49.776 --> 03:45:57.223]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[03:45:57.643 --> 03:45:59.105]  Our republic is in distress.
[03:45:59.565 --> 03:46:00.026]  Ask me why.
[03:46:00.686 --> 03:46:02.608]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[03:46:02.769 --> 03:46:08.235]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[03:46:08.735 --> 03:46:10.237]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[03:46:10.297 --> 03:46:13.260]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[03:46:13.721 --> 03:46:15.863]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[03:46:16.524 --> 03:46:18.767]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[03:46:19.454 --> 03:46:20.236]  It's all about freedom.
[03:46:20.276 --> 03:46:21.618]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[03:46:22.139 --> 03:46:23.061]  Resist Tyranny.
[03:46:23.702 --> 03:46:24.704]  Made in America.
[03:46:24.724 --> 03:46:24.704]  1776.
[03:46:25.325 --> 03:46:28.431]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[03:46:28.651 --> 03:46:29.613]  The backs are really cool.
[03:46:29.974 --> 03:46:30.635]  Look at that back.
[03:46:30.695 --> 03:46:31.597]  That is pure Americana.
[03:46:32.833 --> 03:46:37.977]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[03:46:38.097 --> 03:46:38.758]  The Dayglo.
[03:46:39.278 --> 03:46:43.361]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[03:46:43.541 --> 03:46:45.162]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[03:46:45.543 --> 03:46:46.884]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[03:46:47.004 --> 03:46:48.145]  It's got the nice patch.
[03:46:48.465 --> 03:46:49.526]  Infowars.com.
[03:46:49.766 --> 03:46:50.627]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[03:46:50.887 --> 03:46:54.329]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[03:46:54.750 --> 03:46:56.331]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[03:46:56.571 --> 03:47:01.054]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:47:04.318 --> 03:47:07.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.781 --> 03:47:15.345]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:15.505 --> 03:47:16.786]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.906 --> 03:47:19.567]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:19.607 --> 03:47:19.948]  We're back.
[03:47:32.848 --> 03:47:40.992]  On the Alex Jones Show Live, we'd like to talk about the Robert Mueller investigation into Trump's Deutsche Bank financial details.
[03:47:41.652 --> 03:47:48.796]  The White House is currently claiming that Robert Mueller has not issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank to look into Donald Trump and his family's financial dealings.
[03:47:49.548 --> 03:47:51.449]  While the mainstream media claimed he did!
[03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:59.412]  Now I hadn't checked into that fully, that's just a tweet that I've seen pop up in the last couple of minutes, so we'll be sure to follow up on that story.
[03:47:59.452 --> 03:48:04.294]  So it looks like even that might have been fake news, so we'll give you an update on that when we get it.
[03:48:05.214 --> 03:48:06.094]  Meryl Streep!
[03:48:06.875 --> 03:48:17.559]  She set herself up as a self-proclaimed feminist, she's now talking about all the victims of sexual assault coming out of Hollywood, how terrible it is, decrying the sexual assault of women,
[03:48:18.570 --> 03:48:28.878]  While still supporting and not disavowing an admitted child rapist and multiple time accused sex abuser Roman Polanski.
[03:48:28.898 --> 03:48:35.262]  There's been an entire industry within an industry of denial of what Roman Polanski did.
[03:48:36.163 --> 03:48:45.750]  Amongst Hollywood elite for the past 15 plus years, in 2009, 100 leading industry figures signed a free Polanski petition
[03:48:46.443 --> 03:48:53.704]  Lobbying for his release when he was arrested in Switzerland, because he gets arrested everywhere he tries to go, basically, because they try to extradite him.
[03:48:54.044 --> 03:48:58.505]  That's why he can't get back into the United States, because he's an admitted child rapist.
[03:48:59.385 --> 03:49:07.747]  And Hollywood, and Meryl Streep, the big feminist, the big representative of female victims of sexual assault, they all support him!
[03:49:08.107 --> 03:49:10.287]  They're all rampant hypocrites.
[03:49:10.307 --> 03:49:11.347]  Let's go back to that clip.
[03:49:11.367 --> 03:49:12.288]  2003 Academy Awards, remember?
[03:49:14.808 --> 03:49:17.289]  No plausible deniability.
[03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:18.910]  This is a Weinstein situation.
[03:49:18.930 --> 03:49:22.291]  They can't deny that they knew, even though they did in the case of Weinstein.
[03:49:22.651 --> 03:49:23.772]  But they can't even deny it.
[03:49:24.212 --> 03:49:28.374]  His public knowledge admitted he raped a 13-year-old girl after drugging her.
[03:49:28.754 --> 03:49:29.474]  And what did they do?
[03:49:29.634 --> 03:49:30.915]  They gave him an Oscar.
[03:49:31.155 --> 03:49:32.235]  Let's go to the clip again.
[03:49:32.255 --> 03:49:37.517]  Goes for Roman Polanski.
[03:49:40.578 --> 03:49:41.859]  That's salvation!
[03:49:42.771 --> 03:49:43.932]  Whoops and hollers!
[03:49:44.372 --> 03:49:48.454]  And if we keep this clip running, you see it cuts back to the audience just in a second here.
[03:49:48.974 --> 03:49:55.117]  They're all going absolutely insane with joy that they've just awarded a child rapist an Oscar!
[03:49:56.437 --> 03:49:57.658]  Look, they're all happy about it.
[03:49:57.698 --> 03:49:58.458]  Some are standing up.
[03:49:58.478 --> 03:49:59.338]  Who's that in the background?
[03:49:59.379 --> 03:50:00.679]  Oh, it's Meryl Streep!
[03:50:00.759 --> 03:50:01.139]  Look!
[03:50:02.260 --> 03:50:03.160]  Roll it back a bit.
[03:50:03.861 --> 03:50:06.942]  Roll it back a bit and pause on Meryl Streep in the background there.
[03:50:07.566 --> 03:50:14.670]  Because she is now setting herself up as a representative of women abused in Hollywood.
[03:50:15.130 --> 03:50:15.751]  There she is.
[03:50:16.091 --> 03:50:24.556]  There's Meryl Streep, right there, standing and applauding an admitted child rapist being given an Oscar.
[03:50:25.116 --> 03:50:36.523]  Somebody who now faces accusations from seven more women, several of whom say that Polanski raped them when they were children, including one who said she was raped on a beach in Malibu when she was 10 years old.
[03:50:37.853 --> 03:50:45.297]  By the man who Meryl Streep is applauding, knowing that he was an admitted child rapist in 2003.
[03:50:45.737 --> 03:50:46.377]  Knowing it.
[03:50:47.778 --> 03:50:52.641]  And there's even a Snopes article about this, because it's such a controversial thing.
[03:50:52.661 --> 03:50:57.723]  You know, did Meryl Streep give Roman Polanski a standing ovation?
[03:50:57.783 --> 03:51:05.127]  And even Snopes, which basically denies anything that makes the left look bad, even Snopes admits it's true, because we've got the video and we just showed it.
[03:51:06.491 --> 03:51:09.914]  And you saw an article, you know, why does Hollywood keep defending Roman Polanski?
[03:51:09.934 --> 03:51:12.636]  This is an institution now within Hollywood.
[03:51:12.656 --> 03:51:16.999]  Who has disavowed Roman Polanski as a result of this sex abuse scandal?
[03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:25.266]  This deluge of accusations and admissions from all these people, the vast majority of whom were left-wing supporting Hillary Clintonites.
[03:51:26.485 --> 03:51:34.333]  They were all male feminists, they all celebrated International Women's Day, they relentlessly virtue signalled on Twitter about how much they loved women.
[03:51:34.373 --> 03:51:37.837]  I mean, Russell Simmons, I went through his entire Twitter history.
[03:51:38.257 --> 03:51:42.382]  It was just relentless about how much he loved women, how Donald Trump was bad.
[03:51:42.922 --> 03:51:44.043]  For demeaning women.
[03:51:44.083 --> 03:51:45.324]  For his attacks on women.
[03:51:45.784 --> 03:51:46.945]  He's a rapist!
[03:51:46.985 --> 03:51:48.806]  He's admitted rapist now!
[03:51:49.306 --> 03:51:50.307]  Russell Simmons!
[03:51:50.747 --> 03:51:51.728]  They're all the same.
[03:51:51.768 --> 03:51:53.209]  They're all rampant hypocrites.
[03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:56.951]  So 2003, they award Roman Polanski.
[03:51:57.671 --> 03:52:00.533]  Oh yeah, let's not even get into the whole Sharon Tate thing.
[03:52:00.873 --> 03:52:06.397]  How he went to the scene of the crime and took all these weird pictures with her blood smeared behind him.
[03:52:06.857 --> 03:52:07.878]  It's completely normal.
[03:52:07.898 --> 03:52:09.419]  We don't even need to get into that.
[03:52:09.999 --> 03:52:11.060]  But Roman Polanski.
[03:52:12.580 --> 03:52:13.861]  2003, they give him an Oscar.
[03:52:14.042 --> 03:52:16.243]  Knowing he raped a child, they give him an Oscar.
[03:52:16.363 --> 03:52:17.044]  They award him.
[03:52:17.324 --> 03:52:21.127]  They literally award him after they know he raped a child.
[03:52:21.187 --> 03:52:22.468]  No plausible deniability.
[03:52:22.508 --> 03:52:26.771]  Meryl Streep stands up, gives him a standing ovation.
[03:52:26.791 --> 03:52:30.834]  2009, they ask Meryl Streep again about Roman Polanski.
[03:52:30.874 --> 03:52:33.996]  This is six years later, and she defends him again.
[03:52:34.056 --> 03:52:36.157]  Let's go to that second clip from 2009.
[03:52:36.237 --> 03:52:36.638]  Here it is.
[03:52:38.672 --> 03:52:42.753]  Yes, Roman Polanski, I'm very sorry that he's in jail.
[03:52:45.273 --> 03:52:48.554]  There you have it, very sorry that Roman Polanski's in jail.
[03:52:48.654 --> 03:52:51.115]  He's in and out of jail.
[03:52:51.715 --> 03:52:56.036]  He raped a 13 year old girl after drugging her and she's very sorry that he's in jail.
[03:52:56.956 --> 03:53:02.137]  That's Meryl Streep, the big feminist, the big defender of women and young girls, victims of sexual assault.
[03:53:02.557 --> 03:53:06.178]  Has not disavowed Roman Polanski, when will she do it?
[03:53:07.138 --> 03:53:07.618]  Now of course,
[03:53:08.542 --> 03:53:12.245]  Rumours and reports, some of which have proven to be true, about Harvey Weinstein.
[03:53:13.005 --> 03:53:20.311]  Numerous A-level actors, they see the latest accusations against Polanski, seven new accusations from seven new women.
[03:53:22.152 --> 03:53:26.415]  But we had with the Weinstein situation, they all knew it was going on, they all covered up for him.
[03:53:26.796 --> 03:53:31.159]  The New York Times killed the investigation into Weinstein back in 2004.
[03:53:31.579 --> 03:53:35.462]  It could have come out then, could have saved a lot of women being abused.
[03:53:36.263 --> 03:53:36.563]  Of course,
[03:53:37.347 --> 03:53:38.948]  Big actors knew about it.
[03:53:39.008 --> 03:53:40.908]  They've since come out and had to admit that.
[03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:45.229]  Meryl Streep got up in a 2012 speech.
[03:53:45.430 --> 03:53:48.911]  Given all these rumours were circulating, loads of people knew about it.
[03:53:48.931 --> 03:53:50.751]  Of course, they've still got plausible deniability.
[03:53:50.771 --> 03:53:53.752]  They can claim they didn't, but the reports are in they did.
[03:53:54.152 --> 03:54:04.695]  She gets up in a 2012 speech, calls Harvey Weinstein the serial abuser of women a, quote, God, and then labels him the Punisher.
[03:54:04.855 --> 03:54:05.856]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:54:05.876 --> 03:54:06.256]  Here it is.
[03:54:07.476 --> 03:54:14.124]  I just want to thank my agent Kevin Uvaine and God, Harvey Weinstein.
[03:54:14.144 --> 03:54:21.453]  The Punisher.
[03:54:22.153 --> 03:54:23.114]  Old Testament, I guess.
[03:54:23.999 --> 03:54:25.541]  And then she calls him the Punisher.
[03:54:25.721 --> 03:54:30.606]  When it's known his reputation's been... You had the Courtney Love clip, remember that one?
[03:54:31.187 --> 03:54:34.090]  She's like, don't go in a hotel room with Harvey Weinstein.
[03:54:34.390 --> 03:54:35.692]  That was years before that.
[03:54:36.192 --> 03:54:37.554]  Everybody knew about it.
[03:54:37.994 --> 03:54:39.556]  She's calling him God in 2012.
[03:54:40.497 --> 03:54:42.319]  She's supporting Roman Polanski.
[03:54:42.719 --> 03:54:46.103]  Compare it to Lena Dunham, who I'm no fan of, obviously.
[03:54:46.730 --> 03:54:51.953]  But Lena Dunham, and the headline is Lena Dunham sorry for publicly supporting friend accused of rape.
[03:54:52.473 --> 03:54:56.756]  Lena Dunham came out because, you know, we've been told you have to believe the accuser.
[03:54:57.076 --> 03:54:58.937]  So, OK, well, we'll play by your rules then.
[03:54:59.057 --> 03:55:06.521]  Now we have to believe every accuser without evidence, even though it's going to ensnare the vast majority of people who are ensnared by that are going to be on the left.
[03:55:07.133 --> 03:55:09.455]  Because they're all perverts coming out of DC and Hollywood.
[03:55:09.955 --> 03:55:11.276]  But okay, let's go by your rules.
[03:55:11.316 --> 03:55:12.477]  Let's just believe the accuser.
[03:55:12.617 --> 03:55:14.818]  All women who claim they were raped were raped.
[03:55:15.278 --> 03:55:16.960]  There's no due process, nothing.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:17.740]  We have to believe them.
[03:55:18.361 --> 03:55:21.483]  Like Hillary Clinton said, apart from when it's victims of Bill Clinton.
[03:55:21.503 --> 03:55:22.643]  Obviously, that's a different story.
[03:55:23.164 --> 03:55:23.984]  But Lena Dunham.
[03:55:25.165 --> 03:55:26.606]  This was quite recently.
[03:55:26.646 --> 03:55:27.407]  Let's look at the date.
[03:55:27.427 --> 03:55:29.388]  This was Sunday 19th of November.
[03:55:30.023 --> 03:55:37.728]  Couple of weeks ago, two or three weeks ago, Lena Dunham has issued an apology after coming out in support of a friend and a former colleague accused of rape.
[03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:47.014]  He was Murray Miller, a writer for Dunham's hit TV drama Girls, who was accused of raping actress Aurora Perrineau when she was 17 years old.
[03:55:47.034 --> 03:55:47.855]  So he was accused.
[03:55:48.695 --> 03:55:49.515]  Of raping a girl.
[03:55:49.935 --> 03:55:57.238]  Lena Dunham, his friend, the top feminist, Lena Dunham, again another feminist, she defended the man.
[03:55:57.278 --> 03:56:01.699]  She said, this didn't happen, he didn't rape her, but no, we have to believe the accuser.
[03:56:02.300 --> 03:56:04.400]  Lena Dunham had to walk that back.
[03:56:05.140 --> 03:56:07.901]  She had to come out because she got vilified and attacked.
[03:56:07.941 --> 03:56:15.744]  In fact, I defended her at the time and said, well, no, actually, if the man denies being a rapist, you at least have to give him due process.
[03:56:16.696 --> 03:56:21.778]  Like all these cases we're talking about, whether it be Weinstein or Polanski or whoever, they're admitted.
[03:56:21.858 --> 03:56:22.538]  They're admitted.
[03:56:22.598 --> 03:56:25.859]  So there's no mystery around it.
[03:56:26.300 --> 03:56:35.963]  But Lena Dunham got absolutely vilified and attacked for defending her friend for saying that this woman was basically lying in accusing this guy of raping her.
[03:56:36.524 --> 03:56:37.664]  She got vilified!
[03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:43.778]  Meryl Streep has not disavowed an admitted child rapist.
[03:56:44.138 --> 03:56:45.440]  She's getting away with it.
[03:56:45.841 --> 03:56:46.862]  It's a free pass.
[03:56:47.242 --> 03:56:49.506]  Why are we not asking questions of Meryl Streep?
[03:56:49.526 --> 03:56:51.629]  Well, because if she gets brought down...
[03:56:52.324 --> 03:56:57.687]  The whole thing could come tumbling down because of course she's the queen of virtue signalling.
[03:56:57.807 --> 03:57:07.392]  Remember what was the Golden Globes back in January or whatever when she gave up and gave the big anti-Trump speech saying he was attacking immigrants, he was attacking women.
[03:57:07.972 --> 03:57:16.677]  She's now set herself up as the big defender, the big moral guardian of victims of sexual abuse, women coming out of Hollywood.
[03:57:17.532 --> 03:57:37.193]  While defending, refusing to disavow, Roman Polanski, an admitted child rapist and someone who now has a further seven sexual assault accusations against him, including the rape of a 10-year-old girl, even younger than the 13-year-old girl he raped in 1977.
[03:57:39.315 --> 03:57:44.340]  And Meryl Streep is still standing behind him, refusing to disavow.
[03:57:44.601 --> 03:57:46.743]  She is the ultimate hypocrite.
[03:57:46.783 --> 03:57:48.665]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live.

[03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:57.074]  My friends, we're in the middle of the second American Revolution.
[03:57:58.215 --> 03:58:01.739]  The globalist social engineers are trying to play us off against each other.
[03:58:02.702 --> 03:58:03.303]  In a big way.
[03:58:03.323 --> 03:58:12.029]  They're trying to play us off according to race, according to region, according to ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, male, female.
