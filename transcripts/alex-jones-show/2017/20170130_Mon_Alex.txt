[00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:12.650]  It's Monday, the final day of January 2017 is here in front of us.
[00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.471]  We're only nine days into the new Trump administration.
[00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:24.893]  It is just a historic time to be alive, but the Democratic Party and others are openly trying to start a civil war and lying about President Trump's travel ban.
[00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:31.694]  This is going to be another incredibly important transmission straight ahead, and we're going to kick it off with a report from John Bowne.
[00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.364]  My dream was to go to America because it's the strongest country in the world.
[00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.306]  We feel that it's safe.
[00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:40.949]  It's the safest country.
[00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.152]  It has the strongest human rights.
[00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:47.618]  But with one signature, that vision of America shattered.
[00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:52.102]  I suppose it's what has explained so much of Donald Trump's political career.
[00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:54.564]  The exploitation of fear.
[00:00:55.404 --> 00:01:02.050]  From the Bertha campaign to the talk of Mexican racism, Trump has always trafficked in fear mongering.
[00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.774]  Let the left-wing Marxist media's disinformation campaign begin.
[00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:11.919]  Prepare to be bombarded with the talking point that Saudi Arabia, Egypt,
[00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.142]  and Pakistan were left out of the seven countries banned from entering the U.S.
[00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:20.724]  because of supposed favoritism by President Trump.
[00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:34.951]  Truth be told, President Trump is merely enforcing former President Obama's 2015 law restricting visas from those seven countries of concern, already passed by Congress two years ago.
[00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.774]  Will the conniving globalist media set the record straight?
[00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:49.082]  Why was Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt not included on this list if you are so concerned about this issue?
[00:01:49.503 --> 00:02:03.314]  We are concerned about the issue, Chuck, and that's why we put these seven countries initially into the executive order that were identified previously by Congress, by both the House and the Senate, and the Obama administration as being the seven most
[00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:08.419]  Watched countries in regard to harboring terrorists, but you bring up a good point.
[00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.984]  Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward.
[00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:23.415]  A federal judge is putting a temporary stop to some of the most important parts of President Donald Trump's executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.
[00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:33.685]  This after a federal judge in New York grants an emergency stay halting deportations of people with valid visas who were caught in the confusion of the president's immigration order.
[00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:37.469]  Well, one of the things in the order apparently is to include green card holders.
[00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.653]  As far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn't affect them.
[00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:42.134]  What Donald Trump wants to do
[00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:49.677]  What Homeland Security wants to do unto him is focus on the criminal illegal aliens and get them out of the United States.
[00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:52.698]  Who possibly could object to that?
[00:02:53.318 --> 00:03:02.380]  Another falsehood talking point is that the ban is targeting Muslims exclusively as the Left's fear campaign continues unabated.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.322]  There is an exception made, a potential for the exception made for anyone who is not Muslim.
[00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.683]  There are no exceptions allowed for someone who is Muslim.
[00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:12.704]  Hang on a second.
[00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:16.389]  The order also says persecuted Muslims have priority as well.
[00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:23.517]  So, I mean, that's a piece that's just getting totally either, however you want to call it, misreported or not fully reported.
[00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.200]  It doesn't just say Christians.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.002]  It also says persecuted Muslims.
[00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:29.323]  The executive order signed by President Trump
[00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:59.982]  Is discriminatory, discriminatory on religion, and frankly quite disgusting.
[00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:12.212]  It's not based on religion, it's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.
[00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:19.556]  It is the left that is setting itself up for a seditious fall into the abyss of American history.
[00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:23.978]  The left simply still assuming that they are in charge.
[00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:26.979]  Do you think the president should be banned from coming to the United Kingdom?
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.283]  I think a state visit when there is this sort of ban in place is wrong.
[00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:39.386]  I don't want us to run out the red carpet for a president who has a shameful ban like he has.
[00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.252]  So he should be banned from coming to the UK?
[00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:47.778]  I don't think there should be a state visit while this ban is in place.
[00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:55.588]  But this is a brand new day and the Constitution and our immigration laws will no longer be ignored.
[00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:57.570]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:21.056]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:23.037]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:30.701]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:37.085]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:47.750]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.110]  Exactly.
[00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.911]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:53.254]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:05:53.314 --> 00:05:54.475]  We've both talked to them.
[00:05:54.896 --> 00:06:00.781]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground, and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:10.109]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.070]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:13.391]  We refuse to do that.
[00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.813]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:18.436]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:18.936]  Exactly.
[00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.357]  We're looking for the best.
[00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:25.278]  We went out and searched for the best to private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.140]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.142]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:36.643]  It's everywhere.
[00:06:36.823 --> 00:06:37.503]  It's in nature.
[00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.664]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:46.067]  Just this bottle of silica, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:52.491]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:53.171]  This is insane.
[00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:59.816]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, OK, I get that you guys want to do high-power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000?
[00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:02.338]  And then you could sell multiple bottles of it.
[00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.259]  People will buy more of it.
[00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.520]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.841]  Compare that to this.
[00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:08.803]  This is a $50 product, one of the leaders in the industry.
[00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:10.765]  It has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:11.005]  We have 10,000.
[00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:11.645]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:16.969]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.633]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[00:07:22.653 --> 00:07:26.535]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:35.661]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:36.822]  It's changed my life.
[00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:39.163]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.385]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:44.107]  I was jogging, lifting weights, I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:52.096]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:53.258]  It's a win-win.
[00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:54.499]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.936]  We are on the march.
[00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:13.957]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:22.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.141]  Well, we gambled on Donald Trump, didn't we?
[00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:28.922]  Or at least we thought we did two years ago.
[00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:30.922]  And he came up royal flush.
[00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:36.264]  With another handful of spades.
[00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:38.716]  In his other fist.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.442]  Overt delivery.
[00:08:44.284 --> 00:08:44.845]  Shocking.
[00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:46.387]  Truthfulness.
[00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.631]  Unbelievable.
[00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.537]  Donald Trump, the real deal.
[00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:53.479]  The return of the republic.
[00:08:54.179 --> 00:09:00.746]  He's even now reversed himself on torture, which was the only thing that he was promoting that I thought was wrong.
[00:09:01.327 --> 00:09:02.448]  But he's being honest about it.
[00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:07.754]  The fact that our enemies use it against us and the fact that it does sometimes get good information.
[00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:11.206]  Still, we can't lower ourselves to their level.
[00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:20.509]  But he's now come out and said he will follow what the Secretary of Defense says, Mattis, and Mattis is against torture, so he is now against torture.
[00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:21.449]  Done.
[00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:22.449]  Boom.
[00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:31.211]  Not a flip-flop, but a change of course from almost perfect to basically perfect.
[00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:40.149]  The enemy is going to continue to misrepresent who Trump is and who we are and what we're standing for and what we're doing here.
[00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:55.941]  But it hit me like a thunderbolt this morning that I needed to muster every bit of my focus, my will, my oratory skills to simply and succinctly boil it down and encapsulate it.
[00:09:57.983 --> 00:10:00.725]  The listeners and viewers of this transmission.
[00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:08.348]  We say it a lot, but I want it to sink into your bones real good.
[00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:13.089]  This country is in a fight for its life.
[00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:22.212]  This planet is in a fight for its life against the technocrats that are a very wicked, evil group of mad scientists, basically.
[00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:24.912]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:30.994]  And Donald Trump is the instinctive, ancestral archetype
[00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:52.139]  of a man not caring what the enemy thinks, not caring about PR, not caring about propaganda, but knowing the truth and risking his life, his name, his treasure, along with all the rest of us on the front line, to try to truly save humanity's future from a very, very wicked group of people.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:01.261]  Make no mistake, everybody, I don't care what color you are, I don't care where you came from, I don't care
[00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:03.979]  Whether you're a man or a woman.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:11.282]  If you're fighting the globalists, you're on the front lines in defense of this species.
[00:11:12.303 --> 00:11:15.004]  Against a very alien, satanic evil.
[00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:19.445]  And I want to just shoot the viewer straight, right now.
[00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:26.768]  I mean every single word of what I say on this broadcast.
[00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:31.790]  In fact, we're facing a situation far worse than I can even articulate here.
[00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:50.930]  But if we face the enemy and if we admit how serious the stakes are, we have the will, the history, the destiny to defeat this enemy and through this great trial, come out on the other side at the next level for our species.
[00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.233]  This is the great test we're now entering into.
[00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:57.175]  This is the great battle.
[00:11:58.476 --> 00:11:59.137]  This is the war.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:12.047]  And make no mistake, Donald Trump is delivering with a great group of men and women around him and the supporters of this broadcast and others in a true attempt to defeat the globalist program.
[00:12:13.468 --> 00:12:17.411]  He is delivering on every front with military precision and speed.
[00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:26.577]  He understands that he is in an incredibly epic historical moment.
[00:12:28.277 --> 00:12:34.981]  And that is why the enemy is pulling out every stop they've got because they're losing and they're desperate and they're scared.
[00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:40.985]  In nine days, he did more for this country and its sovereignty than Ronald Reagan ever did.
[00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:47.764]  It's a false statement when people say, oh, he's done more in a week than Obama did in eight years.
[00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:50.346]  Obama was trying to hurt the country.
[00:12:50.846 --> 00:12:53.307]  Obama was trying to impoverish the population.
[00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:59.230]  Obama was trying to break our will in his own public statements and in their own white papers and books.
[00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.692]  But not just America, the world, telling Latin Americans communism's good.
[00:13:07.994 --> 00:13:10.255]  Telling Cubans that Fidel Castro was great.
[00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:14.474]  Telling Africans they can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:26.900]  These are selfish, arrogant, monstrous, spiritually blind people that we're up against, who have turned themselves over to an interdimensional sickness.
[00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.481]  This is a spiritual battle.
[00:13:30.302 --> 00:13:39.506]  President Trump knows that, and has invoked the true God of the universe, the true God of creation, the God of life,
[00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:45.445]  The true all-powerful in our quest to be free.
[00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.768]  And our long march into the heavens.
[00:13:54.774 --> 00:13:58.517]  And that's why all of us have to rededicate ourselves even stronger and work harder.
[00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:00.159]  And we have to be focused.
[00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:04.863]  And we have to realize that that's our destiny and that it's not tiring or exhausting, but that it's fulfilling.
[00:14:07.557 --> 00:14:10.860]  And that's why we have to be very serious and very focused.
[00:14:14.003 --> 00:14:15.304]  Because the stakes are so high.
[00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:22.311]  And we're not being given this short reprieve just out of the blue.
[00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:28.737]  This is because of prayer and action and people being persecuted and working hard so that we have a basic platform to fight the enemy.
[00:14:29.177 --> 00:14:32.661]  But if we squander this platform, if we squander this chance,
[00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:48.229]  Humanity's gonna go into long, long, long, hundreds of years in my gut analysis of serious, serious hardcore dehumanization and enslavement that is unimaginable.
[00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.251]  We're already gonna go through some incredible tribulations in the future.
[00:14:55.231 --> 00:15:01.193]  The AI wars, bio-attacks, system breakdowns,
[00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:05.738]  We're already facing a lot, even if we have good leaders.
[00:15:07.018 --> 00:15:14.420]  With evil leaders, we are insured horrific humiliation and bondage.
[00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:27.843]  So, at an animal level, I disdain our enemies and their minions, but their minions are soul-sucked victims and zombies who we should cry for, not hate.
[00:15:29.718 --> 00:15:31.740]  The upside-down world of D.C.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:48.114]  and Austin, Texas and Berlin, Germany, with women with their tops off screaming Allah Akbar and calling for open borders for Islamists that will literally put them in slave pits.
[00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:52.377]  That is desperate, hysterical,
[00:15:53.755 --> 00:16:00.538]  Self-hate and loathing and projecting onto all of us that want to save them and empower them.
[00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:03.379]  They're projecting onto us their own hatred.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.580]  For themselves.
[00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:13.963]  And we just have to figure out ways to reach out to these people.
[00:16:14.503 --> 00:16:15.844]  That's just one example.
[00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:20.620]  And we have to remember that if you go to Iran, they've got big studies out.
[00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:26.184]  Poles, upwards of 80% of the population doesn't want to be under the mullahs, but they are under a spiritual dictatorship.
[00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:30.067]  In Saudi Arabia, the vast majority of the people don't like what they're under.
[00:16:30.087 --> 00:16:35.351]  So you have to understand, I didn't want these wars with the Muslims, because most of them actually don't want to be part of it.
[00:16:36.572 --> 00:16:41.515]  I didn't want to start the whole trigger that would destabilize the Middle East and cause this flood into Europe.
[00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:46.198]  But now that we're at that point, it is anti-war.
[00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:57.601]  What Donald Trump is doing, trying to stem the tide of ISIS and Al Qaeda, and trying to block those borders into historical Istanbul, formerly Constantinople.
[00:16:59.962 --> 00:17:09.507]  So of course Islamic State supporters react angrily to Trump's temporary refugee halt, which of course is a carbon copy of the law passed in 2013 by President Obama.
[00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:20.797]  The UN vets the refugees and certifies them with fake passports and fake visas and ships them in.
[00:17:20.837 --> 00:17:24.398]  And we see weekly attacks in Europe and in North America.
[00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:28.599]  We saw another attack that killed six people and injured dozens in Canada.
[00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:33.741]  With the men screaming Allah Akbar, one Islamic sect attacking the other.
[00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:38.162]  And the headline was, oh a terror attack on the poor Muslims.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.483]  They were attacking because they thought that the Muslims in the mosque were heretical.
[00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:46.804]  A liberal mosque.
[00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:49.145]  They're not going to put up with that.
[00:17:50.566 --> 00:17:54.028]  But only in this upside-down 1984 world.
[00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:10.119]  Would you have ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC saying, look, I saw it this morning, right after the Muslim ban, which isn't a ban, 87% can still come in, a mosque got hit by terror.
[00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:13.357]  What type of craziness is this?
[00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:18.382]  Canadian Prime Minister says, Moss shooting a terror attack on Muslims, Reuters.
[00:18:18.762 --> 00:18:19.103]  Yes!
[00:18:19.803 --> 00:18:20.784]  By Islam!
[00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:25.368]  The biggest victims of Islam are those living under Islam.
[00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:30.633]  The more extreme the country, the more debt, the more carnage.
[00:18:30.673 --> 00:18:35.098]  There is no peace within the House of Islam or without the House of Islam.
[00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:38.879]  The House of Islam is everything Islam dominates.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.681]  And everything outside the House of Islam translates to the House of War.
[00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:51.765]  Truly, truly, in modern times, undebatably, a satanic religion.
[00:18:53.387 --> 00:19:08.510]  That enslaves women, that pulls down art, that destroys open free societies, and is worshipped by the twisted, manless, hateful women who at all these marches the men brag, we have it on video, I walk behind my wife.
[00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.070]  Really, how about right beside them?
[00:19:12.131 --> 00:19:13.751]  Or in front of them, to open the door.
[00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:15.292]  Oh no, don't patronize me.
[00:19:15.452 --> 00:19:16.872]  That's right, make me a slave.
[00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:20.082]  These women are crazed demons.
[00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:23.665]  Jezebel spirits turned over to the enemy.
[00:19:25.046 --> 00:19:26.447]  It's a wavelength, the spirit.
[00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:28.348]  They're crazed, they're in charge.
[00:19:28.528 --> 00:19:32.231]  They feel the satanic power of orthodox Islam behind them.
[00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:36.054]  The gates of hell opening to vomit out the jihad.
[00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:46.061]  And they lust to have their jaws broken and their noses broken and their genitals cut off and to be kept in closets and slave pens.
[00:19:47.216 --> 00:19:48.258]  They hate their father.
[00:19:48.818 --> 00:19:49.740]  They hate Christ.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.042]  They hate the West.
[00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:55.829]  And so hell will be their abode and their homeland.
[00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:57.131]  But they are not with us.
[00:19:57.772 --> 00:20:02.398]  Let them go forth from here into their hell prepared for them by their father.
[00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:08.911]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:16.156]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:18.778]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:20.780]  And I started to try to eat healthy.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.641]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:20:23.042 --> 00:20:24.864]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:20:25.384 --> 00:20:35.734]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:36.195]  Boom!
[00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:38.037]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:40.039]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:41.680]  Then, by early 2016,
[00:20:43.722 --> 00:20:47.084]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:20:47.104 --> 00:20:48.165]  But the election heated up.
[00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:50.606]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:20:50.706 --> 00:20:59.951]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:01.132]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:21:01.312 --> 00:21:04.994]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:11.860]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.221]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:16.825]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:21:18.703 --> 00:21:25.485]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:32.327]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:21:32.707 --> 00:21:33.227]  It's amazing.
[00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:35.908]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:21:36.188 --> 00:21:38.829]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:43.209]  Well, here we are.
[00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:44.330]  Another week has passed.
[00:21:44.931 --> 00:21:57.024]  If memory serves, I lost five pounds the first week, three pounds the next, and only one pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[00:21:57.064 --> 00:21:59.006]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[00:21:59.466 --> 00:22:02.410]  I've lost a pound, so we're now up to nine pounds.
[00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:07.620]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.222]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:11.324]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[00:22:12.185 --> 00:22:16.869]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.872]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:21.514]  Let's see what happens next week.
[00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:27.690]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.573]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[00:22:33.313 --> 00:22:37.795]  I did have better and more intense workouts because of Supermail and just what it does to my mental picture.
[00:22:37.855 --> 00:22:46.440]  But taking the entire family of InfoWars live products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids,
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.561]  Taking it all religiously, every day, but once or twice.
[00:22:49.581 --> 00:22:52.623]  So I started in like, I don't know, December 3rd, 4th or so.
[00:22:52.803 --> 00:22:57.125]  Finished, what was it, about January 4th was the last day of the final photos I took just a few days ago.
[00:22:57.325 --> 00:22:59.546]  Then I left town for a few days, that's why this is a voice memo.
[00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.827]  I didn't shoot the final, final video.
[00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:04.508]  But what I'm getting at is, it really does work.
[00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:09.891]  Despite the fact that the day after Christmas, I ate almost an entire pie that my mother had brought over.
[00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:13.632]  Pumpkin pie and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[00:23:14.253 --> 00:23:16.914]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge.
[00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.234]  Well, you know how it is folks.
[00:23:19.375 --> 00:23:20.035]  Hot cocoa.
[00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:21.515]  It's just it's since I was a kid.
[00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:27.478]  Only time I tend to eat a lot of sweets is is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas and I just picked out this year.
[00:23:27.998 --> 00:23:29.558]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[00:23:29.578 --> 00:23:30.759]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:33.260]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.062]  This isn't gonna happen, but we went ahead and did the experiment and I still lost some weight.
[00:23:38.723 --> 00:23:55.151]  It wasn't as much as I wanted to, but to me it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other, you know, things that are in the products in me helped me just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:56.332]  It's hard to believe.
[00:23:56.692 --> 00:23:59.073]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:02.035]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:58.030]  But what's happening with Trump is that he used cult of personality to a certain extent with some of the uninformed voters, but he simply saw the global movement against globalism taking place and saw the nation states were awakening, something he'd been promoting for 40 years in words and in deeds and in money he spent, and he rode that wave to victory and he sees the historic time we're in and seeks to actually create so much wealth and so much prosperity and so much innovation
[00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:05.613]  And so much equal distribution of opportunity, not redistribution of wealth, forcibly.
[00:25:06.373 --> 00:25:08.094]  He sees that opportunity and he has taken it.
[00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:28.318]  It's in the famous play written by William Shakespeare, titled William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, where he codified from historical writings a bit of a verbal or literary flourish when he said, there is a tide
[00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:36.771]  In the affairs of men, when taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
[00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:44.301]  And fortune passes before us every day, so seize the day.
[00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:47.505]  I would add to that quote, but what is our fortune?
[00:25:50.145 --> 00:25:54.169]  Brutus, there is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
[00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:56.070]  Omit it!
[00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.155]  All the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in the miseries.
[00:26:01.956 --> 00:26:04.538]  On such a full sea are we now afloat.
[00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:15.368]  The magic time, the electric time, the time of destiny, the time of decision, the great crossroad fulcrums,
[00:26:16.377 --> 00:26:29.544]  That run down through the ages, this the biggest, the greatest, the largest, the most magic, the deepest, the widest, the greatest sea of opportunity and destiny that our species has ever floated upon.
[00:26:30.404 --> 00:26:32.305]  Or dive deep into the mysteries.
[00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:41.910]  We cross this sea, and on the other side, is the promise of the Republic.
[00:26:46.044 --> 00:26:49.807]  United States in the destiny of the world in our hands.
[00:26:50.247 --> 00:26:59.555]  The enemy believed to steal it and to pull us down and still may succeed because in the affairs of men God gives us free will.
[00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.437]  Free creatures we are.
[00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:10.624]  The enemy tells us all day long that we don't have free will and we can be programmed and we can be controlled and we're just like a clock.
[00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:13.530]  Because they know that's not the truth.
[00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.351]  We can choose to be unconscious.
[00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:18.672]  We can choose under free will to turn over our will.
[00:27:19.733 --> 00:27:21.114]  It's called being suggestible.
[00:27:22.934 --> 00:27:25.916]  And most people I know are unconscious.
[00:27:25.976 --> 00:27:26.896]  They are suggestible.
[00:27:26.956 --> 00:27:28.417]  They are in a trance state.
[00:27:28.677 --> 00:27:31.619]  A twilight between consciousness and unconsciousness.
[00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:36.241]  I seek to awaken the sleeper.
[00:27:37.372 --> 00:28:04.038]  We must break the public out of the trance and not just debate them on the false facts they've been fed, but with the energy of the secret place of the Most High that Psalms talks about, transcend their petty brainwashing, circumvent it, and somehow unlock their minds to see that they are indeed in Plato's allegory of the cave.
[00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:11.597]  It's in those concepts that we're going to break the chains.
[00:28:12.578 --> 00:28:13.540]  More and more I realize that.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.583]  Not debating them on their fake facts.
[00:28:15.644 --> 00:28:20.712]  Not going, okay, yes, the whole Pennsylvania Avenue was empty.
[00:28:20.772 --> 00:28:21.533]  No one was there.
[00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:30.293]  Even though we have all the photos and videos and I was there and it was totally jam-packed and record viewage, you know, everywhere.
[00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:40.058]  And then we debate them and stoop down to their level when we know they're a pack of liars and we shouldn't laugh at someone that says, haha, Trump didn't have an audience.
[00:28:40.958 --> 00:28:42.859]  Just say, oh you poor thing, and I mean that.
[00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:44.820]  Gosh, you really believe that?
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.341]  Is that why he got elected?
[00:28:47.001 --> 00:28:48.102]  What are you so scared of?
[00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:54.205]  You know, I'm against the establishment and they were all against Trump.
[00:28:55.729 --> 00:29:04.838]  Oh yeah, he put in Goldman Sachs people who have a history of fighting globalism and who've been on the inside and who are fighting it because they've been on the inside.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:13.266]  Everybody just wants to sit here like losers and believe that we have a destiny to fail and that we can't affect change or that we couldn't take over.
[00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.428]  That's what's happening right now.
[00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.992]  We're taking over the government.
[00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:24.810]  And we've got an idea that's a trillion times more superior to their ideas.
[00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:27.072]  We have a culture superior to what they're pushing.
[00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:29.673]  And we're going to crush them.
[00:29:30.474 --> 00:29:32.735]  And not out of some pleasure to crush them.
[00:29:32.995 --> 00:29:35.417]  They need to be crushed, as an example.
[00:29:35.477 --> 00:29:37.778]  And they will be crushed, because they're not going to get out of our way.
[00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:45.068]  Lace up your boots, because we're gonna have to run these people down.
[00:29:45.629 --> 00:29:47.951]  And they're going to attack us, and they're going to get physical.
[00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:53.798]  And whoever fires first loses, but when they start pulling the trigger... We're on the march.
[00:29:54.258 --> 00:29:55.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:59.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.872 --> 00:30:05.853]  New video on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:06.073 --> 00:30:11.475]  Leftist mob chases down Trump supporters, beat and taunt them inside of Portland International Airport.
[00:30:11.715 --> 00:30:16.317]  Again, the anti-Trump people are proven to be the most wicked and violent citizens in our country.
[00:30:16.657 --> 00:30:18.218]  I went to the Women's March in D.C.
[00:30:18.298 --> 00:30:29.162]  wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I was assaulted, spit on, yelled at, cursed at, had my family insulted, dry humped in the street, and overall viewed as a foul person whose opinion should be silent.
[00:30:29.322 --> 00:30:33.304]  And when I asked for their opinions or why they were protesting, I got nothing productive.
[00:30:33.504 --> 00:30:42.189]  I went to the March for Life in Austin wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I experienced zero negativity for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male.
[00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:49.773]  When I put the marchers and their signs on camera, they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language.
[00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:56.838]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones, I challenge you to take to the streets with Make America Great Again gear on.
[00:30:57.038 --> 00:30:59.879]  You will experience more hate than you ever have in your life.
[00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:02.401]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.584 --> 00:31:07.969]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:19.001]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:24.085]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:26.728]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:31:26.788 --> 00:31:28.269]  It helps detoxify.
[00:31:28.489 --> 00:31:31.312]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:31:31.392 --> 00:31:36.136]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:40.280]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:47.727]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:31:47.827 --> 00:31:49.268]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:31:49.448 --> 00:31:50.189]  This is so key.
[00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:54.753]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:31:54.773 --> 00:31:56.855]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:31:56.995 --> 00:32:00.459]  Exclusively available at M4WarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:03.854 --> 00:32:10.002]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:32:10.022 --> 00:32:11.984]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:14.761]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:32:15.381 --> 00:32:20.942]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:29.924]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:32:29.944 --> 00:32:31.985]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:33.465]  This is the best system out there.
[00:32:33.725 --> 00:32:36.485]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:37.486]  This is how it works.
[00:32:37.786 --> 00:32:38.306]  You order.
[00:32:38.426 --> 00:32:39.226]  Customized or
[00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.787]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:32:42.268 --> 00:32:45.430]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.793]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:32:49.993 --> 00:32:50.774]  You cannot lose.
[00:32:50.814 --> 00:32:51.915]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:32:52.215 --> 00:32:58.960]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.223]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:22.292]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.032 --> 00:33:25.732]  We are in quite the paradox right now.
[00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:29.493]  The corporate-controlled globalist media
[00:33:31.516 --> 00:33:35.960]  He's running around twisting and lying and spinning at levels never before seen.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.322]  They've sunk to new lows if that's possible.
[00:33:41.444 --> 00:33:43.947]  President Trump is overperforming in my view.
[00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:51.153]  I came out Friday and I came out Sunday and I said Trump's got to back off this torture thing.
[00:33:51.193 --> 00:33:52.774]  It's the only thing messing up his perfect record.
[00:33:53.435 --> 00:33:55.977]  Came out today and said that he's not for torture now.
[00:33:57.327 --> 00:34:02.150]  And I'm not taking the credit for that, I'd give the British Prime Minister credit for that, and the American people, and all of us credit.
[00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.891]  That's the thing, he listens.
[00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:07.613]  And he does the right thing, and he just gets better with time.
[00:34:09.994 --> 00:34:16.778]  This broadcast is not a Donald Trump butt-kissing event.
[00:34:17.959 --> 00:34:25.263]  But let me tell you something, when you see something this good, and all the good things that are happening, and every form of evil attacking Trump,
[00:34:27.194 --> 00:34:31.596]  And this broadcast, and you the listeners, understand it's because we're having a big effect.
[00:34:31.876 --> 00:34:34.537]  And we should be very, very thankful to God that this is even happening.
[00:34:36.238 --> 00:34:39.799]  I want to run through literally dozens of articles right now that are super important.
[00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:43.441]  First off, how many days has Benny's been in office?
[00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:46.002]  Nine days.
[00:34:47.742 --> 00:34:48.503]  Nine days.
[00:34:49.163 --> 00:34:50.223]  We're in day number nine.
[00:34:50.243 --> 00:34:54.305]  If you count even that half day on that Friday.
[00:34:56.698 --> 00:35:03.981]  And already you've signed an executive order that for every new regulation that's created, two have to be removed.
[00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:09.503]  People always said, there ought to be a law for every new regulation, you gotta get rid of one.
[00:35:10.043 --> 00:35:14.565]  Well, see, everything you always heard granddaddy say is now happening, isn't it?
[00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:17.526]  Oh, and the real estate industry.
[00:35:19.007 --> 00:35:21.508]  They had all sorts of incentives and
[00:35:24.198 --> 00:35:30.443]  Sweetheart deals where they would get money that smaller investors wouldn't get.
[00:35:30.823 --> 00:35:31.564]  He's getting rid of that.
[00:35:33.145 --> 00:35:33.986]  What's the right word?
[00:35:34.046 --> 00:35:34.867]  It's not even incentives.
[00:35:34.927 --> 00:35:35.767]  Incentives are fine.
[00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:38.510]  It's not even perks.
[00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.952]  It's just deals where they get paid taxpayer money.
[00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:43.634]  Trump's been getting rid of that.
[00:35:43.694 --> 00:35:46.796]  I mean, it's just everything is about a level playing field.
[00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:48.478]  A level playing field.
[00:35:48.798 --> 00:35:50.019]  A level playing field.
[00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:54.295]  It's amazing.
[00:35:55.115 --> 00:35:56.876]  And then he signs the executive order.
[00:35:57.936 --> 00:36:00.276]  Trump signs executive order to slash regulations.
[00:36:00.316 --> 00:36:00.636]  Reuters.
[00:36:00.956 --> 00:36:10.738]  President Donald Trump signed an order on Monday that will seek to drastically pare back federal regulations by requiring agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced.
[00:36:13.758 --> 00:36:14.399]  Here's the president.
[00:36:15.379 --> 00:36:22.000]  In terms of regulation, these folks are small business owners and they're great people.
[00:36:23.112 --> 00:36:26.361]  They've been representative of the community, the small business community.
[00:36:27.624 --> 00:36:30.652]  If you have a regulation you want,
[00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:36.405]  Number one, we're not going to approve it because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms.
[00:36:37.185 --> 00:36:43.288]  But if we do, the only way you have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation.
[00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:46.230]  So if there's a new regulation, they have to knock out two.
[00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.271]  But it goes far beyond that.
[00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:54.915]  We're cutting regulations massively for small business and for large businesses, but they're different, but for small business.
[00:36:55.635 --> 00:36:57.136]  And that's what this is about today.
[00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:04.444]  That's what our country has been all about.
[00:37:04.464 --> 00:37:08.068]  Now let's see the response of small business owners to what the president is now doing.
[00:37:26.271 --> 00:37:38.315]  The mere fact that he cares about what our challenges are and what we deal with on a regular basis, on a daily basis, trying to grow our small businesses is really extraordinary.
[00:37:38.735 --> 00:37:46.337]  He really cares about what our problems are and how to come up with some solutions to rectify those issues.
[00:37:50.532 --> 00:37:53.133]  Yes, Joy Weatherpanthus, upstate New York.
[00:37:53.894 --> 00:37:56.735]  Irma Aguirre, restaurant owner from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:37:56.996 --> 00:37:59.057]  Hit pause for a minute.
[00:38:07.543 --> 00:38:12.186]  It's about you, it's about the people, it's about devolving power back to the people, back to the states.
[00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:20.170]  He didn't take over TPP as some giant carrot he could hold over the elites and make them do what he wanted to if he wanted power or wanted money.
[00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.831]  He could have made hundreds of billions out of that.
[00:38:23.552 --> 00:38:25.073]  The way the laws are written, the president can do it.
[00:38:27.234 --> 00:38:29.595]  But no, he just said, nope, the whole thing's crap, it's gone.
[00:38:30.015 --> 00:38:32.217]  Back to Congress, back to the people, bye bye TPP.
[00:38:32.437 --> 00:38:34.798]  That big nightmare the globals tried to ram through for 10 years.
[00:38:35.098 --> 00:38:36.199]  Let's go back to the small business owners.
[00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:47.861]  I'd like to add that the president has been our president for the past week and starting on his second week.
[00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:53.324]  And what he's doing is a terrific job in trying to listen to all walks of life.
[00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:57.407]  Listening not just to large businesses, but small businesses like us.
[00:38:58.047 --> 00:39:02.150]  And really being resilient in the things that he wants to do to move business forward.
[00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.191]  Not just large businesses, but also small businesses.
[00:39:05.772 --> 00:39:07.433]  And that gives me a lot of hope.
[00:39:09.542 --> 00:39:15.344]  So my name is Natalia Luis and I'm Chairman and CEO of M. Luis Construction and M. Luis Products.
[00:39:15.804 --> 00:39:23.527]  We manufacture asphalt material, recycle material, and perform construction services for the public sector.
[00:39:23.547 --> 00:39:36.932]  I am grateful today for the opportunity to have a candid conversation on some of the over-regulation that impedes our ability to be efficient and as effective as we can be.
[00:39:37.552 --> 00:39:41.433]  I think this is a huge step forward, and we're looking forward to more to come.
[00:39:41.473 --> 00:39:41.733]  Thank you.
[00:39:41.773 --> 00:39:43.033]  All right.
[00:39:44.733 --> 00:39:55.915]  Again, these are all really important, but I need to move on to the whole Muslim man that never was, that the media is basically deceiving on here in just a second, because here he is trying to jumpstart the economy, and then, of course, he's got to secure the borders.
[00:39:56.475 --> 00:40:04.617]  You understand that out of the 180-plus countries out there, the United States is about, depending on which show you look at, the third easiest to come to.
[00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:06.740]  And I have another clip.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.802]  In fact, it's in my stack, but I can't find it.
[00:40:09.703 --> 00:40:19.532]  Will you give me that clip again, Matt, or the actual news article from the federal government, where they admit that we get globally two-thirds of the refugees in the program?
[00:40:20.553 --> 00:40:28.161]  In years past, they were about to flood us with even more Islamists, and that the UN actually runs the program.
[00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:29.182]  And, you know, I knew that.
[00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:45.199]  But to actually see the video clips, and actually see it on the federal government's own website, admitting that the UN is who decides who can come here, and then we just accept it, is absolutely incredible.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:56.247]  And to see the latest terror attack that killed at least six people, injured dozens, at a mosque, where one group of Islamists come in and kill the other Islamists, rest their soul,
[00:40:58.194 --> 00:41:00.075]  One group of Muslims come attack the other group of Muslims.
[00:41:00.756 --> 00:41:02.097]  This is what goes on in the Middle East.
[00:41:02.457 --> 00:41:08.121]  But the media preys on the public's ignorance and goes, there was a terror attack on the poor Muslims, see?
[00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:09.702]  All this Muslim bashing?
[00:41:10.022 --> 00:41:14.885]  Yeah, by guys that are admittedly Islamicists.
[00:41:16.606 --> 00:41:19.168]  That's the level of upside-down
[00:41:21.047 --> 00:41:23.289]  Bizarro world deception we're dealing with.
[00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:31.558]  But before I get to all of that and set the record straight with the facts that are incontrovertible, we're ending a special that we started running on Friday.
[00:41:31.578 --> 00:41:37.745]  I can only run it through the end of the week because of contractual reasons.
[00:41:38.405 --> 00:41:39.947]  We only run this a few times a year.
[00:41:40.988 --> 00:41:50.992]  You can get 25% off all Alexa Pure Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Water Filter Systems that are amazing, that sit on your countertop and cut out all the garbage, all the trash.
[00:41:52.472 --> 00:42:00.655]  Again, ending soon, get 25% off Alexa Pure Pro Water Filter Systems and Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:42:00.735 --> 00:42:02.856]  And everybody must have these.
[00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:05.897]  These are the best gravity-fed systems.
[00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:09.518]  We've got four or five different brands that all have very, very high standards.
[00:42:10.018 --> 00:42:16.019]  Some are better at this than at that, but the point is, Alexa Pure is up there in the top two or three, probably even the best.
[00:42:16.459 --> 00:42:17.419]  It's what I use in my home.
[00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:20.540]  I also use some other systems, but they've got travel sizes.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.480]  They've got bigger ones.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.041]  It sits there in your kitchen.
[00:42:23.081 --> 00:42:23.981]  You put the water in it.
[00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:24.901]  It goes through.
[00:42:24.941 --> 00:42:31.523]  It cuts out the glyphosates, the fluoride, the arsenic, the lead, the chemicals, the herbicides, the pesticides, the M... I mean, there's so much stuff.
[00:42:33.393 --> 00:42:40.641]  The fuel additives that are in all 50 states water supply, whether you're getting municipal water or groundwater, well water, everybody needs this.
[00:42:40.661 --> 00:42:42.643]  We have fixed shower heads as well.
[00:42:42.683 --> 00:42:44.105]  You breathe that in, you absorb it there.
[00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.507]  We have them for your bathtubs.
[00:42:45.547 --> 00:42:47.008]  We have other tabletop units.
[00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:48.069]  We have some of the best...
[00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.772]  Systems out there for survival as well.
[00:42:51.792 --> 00:42:54.094]  We have some of the best reverse osmosis systems.
[00:42:54.575 --> 00:43:00.180]  You can't go to a Home Depot, because I know years ago I'd go and buy a new one if I moved houses.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.582]  It'd be 300 bucks for the systems we're selling.
[00:43:02.902 --> 00:43:03.823]  Reverse osmosis for 150.
[00:43:05.407 --> 00:43:07.967]  I mean, it's incredible the type of deals we've got, is what I'm saying.
[00:43:08.248 --> 00:43:10.908]  Whether it's gravity, federal reverse osmosis, we've got it all.
[00:43:11.028 --> 00:43:16.969]  It's a giant water purification area, because we know that one of the number one causes of cancer is poisons in the water.
[00:43:17.409 --> 00:43:29.271]  So for yourself, your children, and everybody, if you just drink filtered water, and the stuff out of bottles is questionable, I mean, I drink some sparkling water myself that I like from Italy, but that's more of a treat, instead of Coca-Cola.
[00:43:30.932 --> 00:43:32.452]  Or sometimes I drink Tapachico.
[00:43:32.492 --> 00:43:33.292]  The point is, that's a treat.
[00:43:34.451 --> 00:43:38.333]  This is what you use to cook your vegetables, to make your iced tea with.
[00:43:38.714 --> 00:43:39.334]  It's all there.
[00:43:39.374 --> 00:43:43.197]  And the air system, I bought comparable systems for $800 five years ago.
[00:43:43.717 --> 00:43:49.601]  Now, costs have dropped because of technology getting cheaper, but the leading competitor is $500 that has basically the exact same specs.
[00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:52.202]  It's 100, and what is it right now?
[00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:59.207]  It's normally 225, but with 25% off, it's just some insane deal right now up on the site.
[00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:00.495]  There it is, $149.96.
[00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:02.878]  So that's an amazing deal right there.
[00:44:03.258 --> 00:44:05.722]  At $225, folks, it's a great deal.
[00:44:05.902 --> 00:44:07.064]  Right now, it's $149.
[00:44:13.308 --> 00:44:19.173]  Right now it is 149 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:19.673 --> 00:44:21.935]  Also, we're about to sell out of Super Metal Vitality.
[00:44:22.015 --> 00:44:22.636]  It's amazing.
[00:44:23.116 --> 00:44:25.678]  Secret 12, Vitamin B12 is now back in stock.
[00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:30.462]  Get 10% off on that as well at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.404]  I'm going to say this real simply.
[00:44:36.112 --> 00:44:43.796]  I want to thank you all for your support, but you're getting really good top-of-the-line nutraceuticals, supplements, Hillary for Prison shirts.
[00:44:44.196 --> 00:44:45.877]  Everything we do affects change.
[00:44:45.937 --> 00:44:50.839]  Everything we do either stands up for freedom or supports your body and your family.
[00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:54.721]  The very best non-GMO, heirloom-pollinated seeds, open-pollinated seeds.
[00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:57.382]  Giant selection, one of the biggest out there.
[00:44:58.908 --> 00:45:02.589]  The best air filters, the best water filters, the best gun parts.
[00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:03.650]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:16.015]  And when you shop with us, you are literally putting money into an organization that is savage, committed, and completely crazed to 110% running over the globalists.
[00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:18.096]  We're committed.
[00:45:19.756 --> 00:45:22.577]  And we're very, very thirsty to take down the enemy.
[00:45:23.418 --> 00:45:25.899]  We've got a lot of new preparedness products that have been added to the store.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:34.764]  It hasn't even been reviewed yet, but I've gone out personally and found out the top reviews, whether it's backpacks or solar tents or shortwave radios, the very best at the very lowest prices.
[00:45:36.524 --> 00:45:40.746]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:40.766 --> 00:45:52.331]  And I got to tell you, people that were buying products from us, films and books and water filters 20 years ago, 21 years ago, I know a lot of people are original listeners.
[00:45:53.072 --> 00:45:53.852]  And thank you.
[00:45:54.512 --> 00:45:55.493]  Please don't thank me.
[00:45:56.547 --> 00:46:01.110]  When you call in, one of the few things that annoys me is thanking me because I want to thank you.
[00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.671]  You're the people that got ridiculed and made fun of.
[00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:04.892]  I did too, but we're together.
[00:46:04.912 --> 00:46:08.854]  I mean, we're fellow fighters in this Great Awakening.
[00:46:09.535 --> 00:46:12.737]  So you humble me by your support and your prayers.
[00:46:12.777 --> 00:46:14.097]  So let's just get out of the way.
[00:46:14.237 --> 00:46:15.398]  I thank you, you thank me.
[00:46:15.858 --> 00:46:18.400]  Let's move forward against the New World Order, but really.
[00:46:20.117 --> 00:46:22.319]  If you want to thank us, help yourself and filter your water.
[00:46:22.399 --> 00:46:27.403]  If you want to help us, help yourself and go get our probiotic, Biome Defense.
[00:46:27.483 --> 00:46:28.904]  I mean, it's the best out there.
[00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:29.384]  It's amazing.
[00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:34.388]  If you want to help yourself, introduce yourself to the true halogen, X2, that your body needs, not the bad halogen.
[00:46:35.369 --> 00:46:36.030]  Or Brain Force.
[00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:38.712]  Or Bio-True Selenium.
[00:46:38.832 --> 00:46:40.353]  Or the Sleep Aid Knockout.
[00:46:41.154 --> 00:46:42.035]  Or Oxy-Powder.
[00:46:42.055 --> 00:46:42.615]  Or Liver Shield.
[00:46:42.635 --> 00:46:43.256]  Or Living Defense.
[00:46:43.316 --> 00:46:44.316]  Or Winter Sun.
[00:46:44.356 --> 00:46:45.437]  Or Super Female Vitality.
[00:46:46.098 --> 00:46:47.119]  Or Bio-PCA.
[00:46:47.479 --> 00:46:48.119]  Or Deep Cleanse.
[00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.110]  Or Vitamineral Fusion.
[00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:51.531]  Or Anthroplex.
[00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:53.591]  Or Lung Cleanse.
[00:46:53.651 --> 00:46:54.392]  Or Prostagard.
[00:46:56.152 --> 00:46:57.793]  Bone and Joint Formula Support.
[00:46:58.393 --> 00:46:58.893]  It's all there.
[00:47:01.254 --> 00:47:01.434]  Now.
[00:47:06.335 --> 00:47:06.835]  Here it is.
[00:47:07.215 --> 00:47:07.556]  U.S.
[00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:10.256]  Department of State Diplomacy in Action.
[00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:15.158]  And if you read here, we can put it on screen and highlight it for TV viewers.
[00:47:17.185 --> 00:47:24.031]  They say that 70 plus percent of worldwide refugees through the UN are resettled here.
[00:47:24.852 --> 00:47:28.436]  The change was they've now flooded Europe with Muslims, more than they have here.
[00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:34.001]  But we get 70 plus percent and the United Nations, if you go read this page, this fax page,
[00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:38.422]  Are the ones that vet it and set it all up.
[00:47:38.482 --> 00:47:39.103]  Go read U.S.
[00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:47.027]  Department of State Refugee Admissions and you scroll down and it says right there that the United Nations is in charge of it and tells us what to do.
[00:47:47.347 --> 00:47:48.308]  And who's in charge of that?
[00:47:48.568 --> 00:47:56.913]  Peter Sutherland who created the Euro and who openly says we're going to get rid of the United States and Europe by flooding them with people that aren't compatible like Muslims.
[00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:06.267]  While the UNHCR reports that less than 1% of all refugees are eventually resettled in third countries, the United States welcome almost two-thirds.
[00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:12.658]  Remember, I have 75% of these refugees, more than all other resettlement countries combined.
[00:48:14.042 --> 00:48:16.223]  I saw a number of 75%, but that's close to it.
[00:48:16.243 --> 00:48:20.606]  The point is, no teleprompter here, folks, so you just got me in an exaggeration.
[00:48:20.626 --> 00:48:24.188]  It's usually the other way around, but almost two-thirds, so the lion's share.
[00:48:24.488 --> 00:48:27.630]  It's like we pay for half the UN, and then we get lectured all day.
[00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:34.614]  And all Trump's doing when he says, with this new legislation, to begin pulling us out of the UN is negotiation power.
[00:48:35.055 --> 00:48:42.299]  You're not going to have Saudi Arabia and Qatar heading up the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Board.
[00:48:43.484 --> 00:48:44.445]  Again, this is a joke.
[00:48:45.085 --> 00:48:51.851]  Women are the property of their husbands in Saudi Arabia, and they treat them like dogs.
[00:48:52.792 --> 00:48:53.533]  Worse than dogs.
[00:48:54.734 --> 00:49:11.728]  And so, again, the weirdo, crazy feminists run around worshipping them, and then, like, actually, a lot of liberal women I know actually go out and marry some Islamist's little boss and slap them upside the head, I guess because they're so pissed that, you know, Western men won't treat them bad.
[00:49:13.959 --> 00:49:25.622]  So, I've just personally had enough and he signed these three executive orders that only enforce what Obama passed in 2013.
[00:49:27.842 --> 00:49:30.883]  Obama bombed five of seven countries Trump banned.
[00:49:31.243 --> 00:49:32.323]  Media doesn't care.
[00:49:32.623 --> 00:49:36.724]  That's up on Infowars.com with all the graphs and all the facts.
[00:49:37.204 --> 00:49:38.304]  Surprise, surprise!
[00:49:39.505 --> 00:49:40.505]  Soros funded group
[00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:44.091]  Behind effort to stop Trump's border plan.
[00:49:45.252 --> 00:49:45.853]  Oh, of course.
[00:49:45.953 --> 00:49:47.614]  That's really hard to believe, isn't it?
[00:49:50.457 --> 00:49:53.239]  Canadian terrorists shout, Allah Akbar!
[00:49:53.279 --> 00:49:54.701]  Can we cue the feminists up when we come back?
[00:49:55.982 --> 00:49:57.964]  Chanting Allah Akbar with their breasts hanging out?
[00:49:58.864 --> 00:50:00.266]  Try that in Saudi Arabia, sweetheart.
[00:50:01.487 --> 00:50:04.289]  I love how the feminists always say it's not about objectification.
[00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:06.952]  When you go to one of their rallies, it's like triple X, man.
[00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:12.734]  Women, they're naked, hanging out, screaming, yelling, screaming, you know, the name of their genitals.
[00:50:13.735 --> 00:50:15.095]  And it's like, okay, whatever.
[00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:17.335]  You know, like, we're liberal, aren't we shocking?
[00:50:17.395 --> 00:50:21.336]  It's like, no, you just never, I guess, had a good experience in your life.
[00:50:21.376 --> 00:50:27.098]  So you, people usually show off their sexuality in public, don't really have a lot of it, is my personal experience.
[00:50:30.307 --> 00:50:39.416]  Now, mild-mannered folks is what you gotta look out for, but, I mean, it really is just a bunch of Arrested Development idiots that, like, are looking for somebody to set them straight.
[00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:41.678]  So they're just like, Oh, Akbar, I loved you hard.
[00:50:41.698 --> 00:50:42.839]  Screw you, America!
[00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:44.961]  Well, go over there, you dumbasses.
[00:50:45.281 --> 00:50:47.663]  I mean, that brings a new meaning to love it or leave it.
[00:50:48.084 --> 00:50:50.246]  Merle Haggard, fight inside of me.
[00:50:52.077 --> 00:50:59.190]  Hey, I don't mind you switching sides, standing up for stuff you believe in, but you want to sit here and have our milk and honey, but then try to overthrow it?
[00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:02.476]  I have a free speech right to say you're a dirty scumbag.
[00:51:03.914 --> 00:51:10.999]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:24.589]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:36.783]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:51:37.444 --> 00:51:43.390]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:52.540]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:51:53.161 --> 00:52:01.370]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:52:04.179 --> 00:52:06.101]  Boy, did the travel ban get him going or what?
[00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:08.723]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[00:52:08.923 --> 00:52:10.304]  But why are they really protesting?
[00:52:10.424 --> 00:52:25.355]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees, or in 2015 when he signed the Visa Waiver Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of his 2015 Christmas gift, Omnibus Spending Bill, which also created the list of countries that Donald Trump chose.
[00:52:25.596 --> 00:52:28.318]  So why no protest then over Obama, but now over Trump?
[00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:29.899]  Coverage and transparency.
[00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:33.902]  See, Trump is transparent with the moves he is making, and the media is always in attack mode against him.
[00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:41.287]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them, the CNNs of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[00:52:41.427 --> 00:52:46.151]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic and Trump's travel ban will increase risk of Islamic terror.
[00:52:46.291 --> 00:52:54.797]  Yes, I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's fatal drones and bombs, which if we get to the bottom of that, would clear a lot of this up.
[00:52:54.937 --> 00:52:57.979]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[00:52:58.199 --> 00:52:58.480]  Why?
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.221]  Coverage and transparency.
[00:53:00.441 --> 00:53:02.703]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:53:03.922 --> 00:53:05.303]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.864]  You can't survive without it.
[00:53:07.064 --> 00:53:07.965]  But where do you get it?
[00:53:08.265 --> 00:53:14.030]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:19.994]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:53:20.174 --> 00:53:37.021]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:53:37.421 --> 00:53:39.541]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:53:39.922 --> 00:53:41.102]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:53:41.382 --> 00:53:42.142]  Easy assembly.
[00:53:42.402 --> 00:53:43.042]  Low maintenance.
[00:53:43.322 --> 00:53:45.142]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:19.802]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[00:54:21.663 --> 00:54:28.805]  Harping on the wars we fight, griping about the way things ought to be.
[00:54:28.945 --> 00:54:34.626]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[00:54:35.687 --> 00:54:36.427]  But when they're
[00:54:38.652 --> 00:54:41.394]  That's Merle Haggard live!
[00:54:41.794 --> 00:54:47.658]  You know, here's the deal.
[00:54:47.859 --> 00:54:52.182]  They got a New York Times writer on a show TV viewers a photo of this woman.
[00:54:53.425 --> 00:54:58.728]  Another crazy, ditzy, out of control, wannabe alpha that's not an alpha, she's a beta.
[00:54:59.248 --> 00:55:00.369]  There are a lot of women that are alphas.
[00:55:01.009 --> 00:55:03.871]  They normally are pretty calm and happy about their lives.
[00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:17.638]  Not like the betas that wannabe alphas, in this soft, unsavage world, they run around cozying up to Islam because it pats them on the head and says, sure, sweetheart, I'm a big feminist.
[00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:21.140]  Under Sharia law, baby, you're going to get lots of empowerment.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.521]  When we cut your genitals off,
[00:55:24.329 --> 00:55:26.751]  Times journalist calls for assassination of Trump.
[00:55:27.372 --> 00:55:29.113]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:29.734 --> 00:55:30.494]  Hard for the course?
[00:55:31.555 --> 00:55:32.176]  Just look at that.
[00:55:32.256 --> 00:55:35.139]  Look at the crazy Jezebel eyes on that loon.
[00:55:35.879 --> 00:55:37.741]  You talk about hell living with her, boy.
[00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:38.602]  Woo!
[00:55:39.983 --> 00:55:41.064]  You talk about a nut.
[00:55:42.925 --> 00:55:45.548]  She's now in a man's world wanting to kill people.
[00:55:46.738 --> 00:55:48.399]  You guys try your little coup d'etat.
[00:55:48.419 --> 00:55:50.419]  What's Vice pushing along with everybody else right now?
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.121]  What would happen in the minutes and hours after the coup in America?
[00:55:54.621 --> 00:55:59.863]  Then they basically salivate, Mike Pearl does, talking about normalizing the overthrow of Trump.
[00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:12.047]  They got all these TV shows about him getting assassinated and how they're going to take over and, oh boy, going to have that Bill Ayers moment where you march 50 million of us off to re-education camps and then got to kill 25 million of us.
[00:56:12.348 --> 00:56:15.409]  Good luck you actually take the gloves off, you dumb bastards.
[00:56:16.269 --> 00:56:18.190]  We're really trying to fix this peacefully.
[00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:20.431]  But you want to get in a fight?
[00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:22.352]  You go ahead and start it, we'll finish it.
[00:56:23.172 --> 00:56:23.772]  But know this.
[00:56:24.573 --> 00:56:25.893]  You're not gonna get any quarter.
[00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:29.875]  You're not gonna get any quarter.
[00:56:30.295 --> 00:56:32.196]  Because you're now walking on the fighting side of me.
[00:56:33.417 --> 00:56:34.217]  And a lot of other people.
[00:56:36.298 --> 00:56:37.078]  Understand, Haas?
[00:56:38.899 --> 00:56:45.022]  I love how the weaker these people are, the more cowardly they are, the more they shoot their mouths off about how they're gonna do some killing.
[00:56:46.271 --> 00:56:47.312]  How are they going to do some hanging?
[00:56:47.332 --> 00:56:49.674]  How are they going to do some murdering?
[00:56:51.035 --> 00:57:00.703]  And that ties into Trump joining with Russia to start bombing hundreds of targets all over... Well, I guess that hadn't been announced, the hundreds of targets that have been hit, but hundreds have been hit.
[00:57:01.424 --> 00:57:06.528]  All over Syria, command and control bases that were being run by John McCain and Lindsey Graham.
[00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:12.253]  No, they went over there and met with them, they were running them, and that's why they're suddenly totally pissed, and that Wahhabist Brennan,
[00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:16.785]  Who admittedly converted to Islam is running around calling Trump a traitor.
[00:57:17.105 --> 00:57:26.349]  When have you ever seen a CIA director or now former one running his mouth in the news calling the president a scumbag and despicable and all these horrible things.
[00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:32.132]  Oh and now Chuckie Schumer's crying because we're not letting people in from six terror countries until the vetting starts.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.922]  Chuckie Schumer who supports Israel being able to have a wall.
[00:57:38.603 --> 00:57:42.085]  He supports Israel's wall and extreme vetting for people who get to go to their country.
[00:57:42.286 --> 00:57:44.247]  But not for America, right, Chuckie Schumer?
[00:57:44.507 --> 00:57:47.669]  Chuckie Schumer looks like a caricature of Emperor Palpatine.
[00:57:47.709 --> 00:57:49.851]  He looks palpably evil.
[00:57:52.953 --> 00:57:53.973]  So that's all coming up.
[00:57:53.993 --> 00:58:01.876]  We got a big story where it's up on DrudgeReport.com where they're openly, another Michael Snyder article, they're openly calling for civil war and pushing it in America.
[00:58:02.196 --> 00:58:06.257]  George Soros didn't double all that funding because he wants to play TiddlyWinks.
[00:58:10.378 --> 00:58:11.998]  Just a little point for everybody.
[00:58:12.038 --> 00:58:18.060]  My old friend Joe Rogan, who's got something like 18 million viewers a week to his podcast.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.401]  I think it's more than that sometimes.
[00:58:21.741 --> 00:58:23.562]  It's also on XM last time I checked.
[00:58:23.722 --> 00:58:25.243]  It's one of the biggest things out there.
[00:58:26.484 --> 00:58:27.665]  The Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:58:28.945 --> 00:58:31.627]  It'll be streamed live on Joe's YouTube channel.
[00:58:32.147 --> 00:58:33.008]  YouTube.com.
[00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:36.290]  Powerful J-R-E.
[00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.011]  And later uploaded to YouTube, iTunes, and various other platforms.
[00:58:39.031 --> 00:58:41.453]  I'm gonna be on it next Wednesday.
[00:58:43.834 --> 00:58:45.135]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.295 --> 00:58:48.437]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.442 --> 00:59:01.585]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:59:02.565 --> 00:59:11.369]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:59:11.769 --> 00:59:15.690]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:18.691]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:20.232]  We now have George Soros
[00:59:21.312 --> 00:59:28.535]  As a goblin, on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:59:29.276 --> 00:59:33.638]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:59:35.879 --> 00:59:42.962]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:59:43.322 --> 00:59:47.004]  It's powerful, I hope you get out to everybody you know, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:58.784]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.284 --> 01:00:00.624]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:20.252]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:20.732 --> 01:00:23.453]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:40.177 --> 01:00:44.880]  It really is crazy to see how they take everything Trump does and lie about it.
[01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:50.944]  There was this article, maybe you guys can pull it up, I forgot to tell you, from Salon attacking us truly today.
[01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:52.705]  And it says,
[01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:58.398]  Hates a police state, but he loves it when Trump has one.
[01:01:00.999 --> 01:01:04.420]  And they point out that I wrote a book about the police state, and I'm one of the leading experts on it.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.220]  They don't deny that.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.001]  And I've gotten all sorts of awards from the left about it.
[01:01:09.481 --> 01:01:11.161]  But it wasn't because I hated the police.
[01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:16.423]  I didn't want an authoritarian government in control of an oppressive police force.
[01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:19.944]  The left thinks it's like disarmed police and stuff like that.
[01:01:19.984 --> 01:01:20.764]  I never supported that.
[01:01:22.543 --> 01:01:26.745]  I don't like the direction they're going in just revenue generation and then protecting all these other criminal classes.
[01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:28.886]  Trump is actually saying, oh guess what?
[01:01:29.306 --> 01:01:38.770]  Drunk drivers, whether they're illegal or legal, in Austin, Texas, he actually uses this example, so does the governor, that's up on Drudge too, will be arrested.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.811]  You're not above the law anymore.
[01:01:40.779 --> 01:01:41.940]  Yeah, so scroll down for TV viewers.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.182]  It's got my mouth inside of Trump's mouth, my head inside his mouth.
[01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:58.451]  Like, they're really trying to sell the idea, because they know Trump's psychology, that he gets everything from me, because they cannot stand his policies, so they think they can manipulate him into Trump thinking that people think that he gets all his info from InfoWars.
[01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:02.914]  He gets it from Americana and common sense.
[01:02:04.415 --> 01:02:06.476]  You can't go into these six countries.
[01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:08.738]  Those six Muslim countries don't let most people in.
[01:02:08.998 --> 01:02:10.319]  If you have an Israeli passport,
[01:02:11.468 --> 01:02:13.530]  In almost all those countries, they arrest you on the spot.
[01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:17.452]  If you are wearing Christian paraphernalia, they kick you out.
[01:02:18.413 --> 01:02:26.119]  Canada almost didn't let me in, famously, to go cover Bilderberg, saying, I didn't have political free speech, but the Canadian Prime Minister says, oh, refugees all come here.
[01:02:26.639 --> 01:02:31.643]  When I know for a fact, I've seen it in the news, Canada bars people who aren't vetted from those countries.
[01:02:32.203 --> 01:02:36.366]  Folks, Sudan, Somalia aren't even countries.
[01:02:36.827 --> 01:02:39.208]  They are veritable hellholes
[01:02:40.313 --> 01:02:46.657]  In Sudan, there's a civil war going on for 20 years, 20 plus years, and they've killed hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:54.282]  The Christians didn't start any of it, and they've got bombers, modern bombers, strafing and bombing villages every day.
[01:02:56.463 --> 01:02:58.664]  But oh, Sudan in the north's got an airport.
[01:02:59.085 --> 01:03:04.268]  Let's just take people, unvetted, from the literal Islamic hellhole.
[01:03:07.506 --> 01:03:27.520]  Do you understand that if you land in Sudan in an airport, and you don't have an Islamic last name, and they come up to you and they'll tell you at the border checkpoint, this is on record, they will say, quote to me this from the Quran, they'll give you a random verse, and if you don't know it, they go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and they send you over to another area where you get interrogated.
[01:03:28.322 --> 01:03:31.024]  And they're like, we ought to be nice to these poor people.
[01:03:31.765 --> 01:03:33.406]  Look at what Trump's doing!
[01:03:33.987 --> 01:03:35.448]  He's so mean!
[01:03:35.808 --> 01:03:41.933]  There's a civil war in Sudan and Somalia, and you can't just go to the airport.
[01:03:41.973 --> 01:03:44.255]  These places barely have airports!
[01:03:46.337 --> 01:03:49.320]  They're military airports in Sudan.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.801]  Somalia doesn't even have them.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.484]  To speak of, they're bombed out cratered landing fields, but in Sudan it's military bases.
[01:03:56.884 --> 01:04:07.772]  You land at a military base with hundreds of planes lined up, some of them World War II vintage, that they used to bomb the unarmed defenseless Christians.
[01:04:10.554 --> 01:04:15.098]  And Obama's been aiding Sudan in what they've been doing, has been helping Sudan invade Kenya.
[01:04:16.246 --> 01:04:19.128]  And murder Christians in mass, you know, at their shopping malls.
[01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:20.949]  You cannot make this up.
[01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:25.512]  Millions of Christians are being killed every few years, the UN admits it now, by Muslims.
[01:04:25.812 --> 01:04:27.153]  And it's like we don't exist.
[01:04:27.173 --> 01:04:30.014]  It's like we don't exist, and it's okay to do this to us.
[01:04:30.335 --> 01:04:30.875]  No, it's not!
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.001]  And they've just got hundreds of aircraft just strafing and murdering and killing.
[01:04:38.181 --> 01:04:41.122]  Just ongoing, year after year, decade after decade.
[01:04:42.042 --> 01:04:47.864]  Oh yeah, let's have people with their little fake passports just show up saying, who are you?
[01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.485]  I'm Habib Ahmed.
[01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:51.866]  Okay, let me let you ride in.
[01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:54.266]  And then a week later he gets a truck and runs over a hundred people.
[01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:57.307]  And the media goes, one person in the crowd was Muslim.
[01:04:57.347 --> 01:04:58.608]  It was an attack on Muslims.
[01:04:59.288 --> 01:05:01.349]  A poor mosque got attacked last night by
[01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:05.031]  New video on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:05.271 --> 01:05:10.653]  Leftist mob chases down Trump supporters, beat and taunt them inside a Portland International Airport.
[01:05:10.893 --> 01:05:15.495]  Again, the anti-Trump people are proven to be the most wicked and violent citizens in our country.
[01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:17.416]  I went to the Women's March in D.C.
[01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:28.340]  wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I was assaulted, spit on, yelled at, cursed at, had my family insulted, dry humped in the street, and overall viewed as a foul person whose opinion should be silent.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.502]  And when I asked for their opinions or why they were protesting, I got nothing productive.
[01:05:32.702 --> 01:05:41.365]  I went to the March for Life in Austin wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I experienced zero negativity for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male.
[01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:48.948]  When I put the marchers and their signs on camera, they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language.
[01:05:49.128 --> 01:05:56.010]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones, I challenge you to take to the streets with Make America Great Again gear on.
[01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:59.071]  You will experience more hate than you ever have in your life.
[01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:01.572]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:03.052 --> 01:06:09.204]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.168]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:06:12.082 --> 01:06:13.963]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:06:14.563 --> 01:06:20.124]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:06:20.704 --> 01:06:28.686]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:06:28.706 --> 01:06:31.167]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:06:31.467 --> 01:06:32.667]  This is the best system out there.
[01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:35.688]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:36.688]  This is how it works.
[01:06:36.968 --> 01:06:37.489]  You order.
[01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:38.429]  Customized or
[01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:40.974]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[01:06:41.454 --> 01:06:44.615]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[01:06:44.915 --> 01:06:48.976]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:49.956]  You cannot lose.
[01:06:49.996 --> 01:06:51.097]  You're funding the Infowar.
[01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:58.138]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:02.439]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.020]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:07:06.813 --> 01:07:12.496]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:17.179]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.261]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:21.522]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:26.084]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:07:26.164 --> 01:07:28.045]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:33.529]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:07:33.629 --> 01:07:35.390]  It's actually scary.
[01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:46.375]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:07:47.355 --> 01:08:00.142]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:09.522]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:08:10.103 --> 01:08:14.307]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.288 --> 01:08:26.759]  It was about four months ago that best-selling author, researcher, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert Matt Bracken said that the media has gone full Soviet from the old Soviet era pure lies.
[01:08:28.385 --> 01:08:39.973]  Now they've gone into every day, from the New York Times to Vice, which is HBO, to you name it, ABC, with plots about killing the president and coups.
[01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:41.314]  And coups really aren't a big deal.
[01:08:41.374 --> 01:08:42.615]  And coups aren't a problem.
[01:08:42.635 --> 01:08:43.756]  We should have civil unrest.
[01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:52.342]  And George Soros, a known globalist, doubling the amount of money he gave in the year previous, right after the election of Donald Trump.
[01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:59.434]  And the Fortune 100 lining up to give the lowest gifts were $2 million up to $50 million apiece.
[01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:01.355]  Kellogg's famously gave $3 million.
[01:09:01.735 --> 01:09:03.696]  You know, pulled their advertising off of Breitbart.
[01:09:04.196 --> 01:09:04.676]  Well, good.
[01:09:04.736 --> 01:09:05.496]  I don't buy Kellogg's.
[01:09:06.257 --> 01:09:07.577]  This is an economic war.
[01:09:08.217 --> 01:09:09.318]  This is a culture war.
[01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:17.261]  And when Trump enforces a law that Obama signed in 2013, the media lies and says it's a Muslim ban.
[01:09:17.281 --> 01:09:19.322]  87% can still come in.
[01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.543]  These are countries like Sudan, again, that only have military airports.
[01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:25.937]  That are launching wars in the south, killing Christians.
[01:09:26.277 --> 01:09:30.640]  How would anybody take unvetted people with their fake passports from Sudan?
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.141]  You can't go to Sudan.
[01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:34.543]  I mean, you've got a good chance of being kidnapped and killed.
[01:09:34.843 --> 01:09:36.404]  You definitely can't go to Somalia.
[01:09:36.484 --> 01:09:39.966]  I know high-level journalists that say it's basically a death wish.
[01:09:40.127 --> 01:09:40.907]  No one gets in now.
[01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:41.568]  No one.
[01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:42.688]  No one.
[01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:45.730]  You've got to have armored vehicles, helicopter support to go into there.
[01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:50.554]  Oh, let's just let someone fly here from Somalia.
[01:09:52.008 --> 01:09:59.256]  So again, they take a normal response, because the last three years Obama ordered the borders open, ordered basically no vetting, the border patrols are on record.
[01:09:59.276 --> 01:10:00.157]  People have TB!
[01:10:00.818 --> 01:10:02.140]  People have leprosy!
[01:10:04.318 --> 01:10:04.999]  And they let them in.
[01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:07.981]  I remember, I was told three years ago by Border Patrol, we're being told to let leprosy in.
[01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:09.783]  It's now in Texas and Florida.
[01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:12.365]  I said, no, it's my dad's like, that's incredible.
[01:10:12.545 --> 01:10:14.506]  He made some calls to medical folks.
[01:10:14.526 --> 01:10:15.487]  They go, yeah, how do you know that?
[01:10:16.188 --> 01:10:17.209]  It's under Homeland Security.
[01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:18.610]  We've got patients in Dallas.
[01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.171]  We got patients in Miami.
[01:10:20.191 --> 01:10:22.713]  We got patients in LA with leprosy.
[01:10:22.733 --> 01:10:25.215]  Then they put them in school with kids and spread all over LA.
[01:10:26.016 --> 01:10:27.177]  Kids will have leprosy for life.
[01:10:27.317 --> 01:10:27.998]  Untreatable folks.
[01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:33.260]  You cannot make up the magnitude and Trump goes, whoa, we're going to have borders.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.841]  This is what globalism is pushing is the end of our borders.
[01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:36.681]  And they freak out.
[01:10:36.721 --> 01:10:38.922]  Then there's an Islamic attack killing six people.
[01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:42.823]  And the Prime Minister comes out and says, we want more refugees.
[01:10:42.843 --> 01:10:45.024]  This was an attack on Muslims by terrorists.
[01:10:45.464 --> 01:10:47.685]  It was one sect attacking another sect.
[01:10:47.945 --> 01:10:50.006]  The biggest victim of Islam are Muslims.
[01:10:51.086 --> 01:10:54.208]  So here's Paul Watson's report on what really happened with this.
[01:10:54.248 --> 01:10:57.649]  We're going to get Matt Bracken's breakdown on this, but I now have no doubt.
[01:10:58.592 --> 01:11:03.198]  They're not going to capitulate to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the electoral process, our elected president.
[01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:07.183]  They're not going to give in to somebody that wants to cut their taxes and make the country great again and bring us together.
[01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.307]  They're going to go into high gear now, as you saw with that Women's March.
[01:11:10.327 --> 01:11:11.028]  It was about a million.
[01:11:11.588 --> 01:11:13.471]  They're going to lie on every front.
[01:11:13.931 --> 01:11:17.554]  To make the debate about their lies so we can't get our agenda done.
[01:11:17.814 --> 01:11:21.117]  So how do you balance exposing their lies while moving forward with our agenda?
[01:11:21.317 --> 01:11:23.499]  You hit them, you expose their lies, you move on.
[01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:24.760]  Because they're already discredited.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.782]  I keep wondering, why do they keep getting more discredited?
[01:11:26.802 --> 01:11:31.165]  Because all they can do is pick an argument to divert us as a smokescreen.
[01:11:32.426 --> 01:11:33.627]  But again, how do you balance that?
[01:11:33.647 --> 01:11:36.650]  Because new listeners and people don't know about the lies.
[01:11:38.171 --> 01:11:40.673]  People still say he threw Martin Luther King's bus in the trash can.
[01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.342]  And Trump couldn't even believe they'd lie that bad.
[01:11:44.382 --> 01:11:45.764]  He called up and he said, who did that?
[01:11:45.804 --> 01:11:47.687]  When he was out at an event.
[01:11:47.727 --> 01:11:48.709]  They said, sir, we didn't.
[01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.730]  It's right here.
[01:11:50.972 --> 01:11:53.897]  And they went back to the actual videos of when they said it and there it was.
[01:11:53.957 --> 01:11:54.798]  It was never taken out.
[01:11:55.882 --> 01:11:58.643]  But see, Trump even got hit by the lie and bought it.
[01:11:58.723 --> 01:11:59.583]  Where is the bust?
[01:11:59.823 --> 01:12:00.464]  Sure, it's right here.
[01:12:01.604 --> 01:12:03.865]  Again, normal people don't lie like this.
[01:12:04.645 --> 01:12:09.427]  You see, they lie even when it would serve them better not to because they know they have no credibility.
[01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:10.647]  We'll talk to Matt Bracken in a moment.
[01:12:10.847 --> 01:12:12.008]  But here's Paul Watson's report.
[01:12:12.088 --> 01:12:12.648]  It's important.
[01:12:12.968 --> 01:12:14.128]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:12:14.508 --> 01:12:16.009]  Please get it out to everyone you know.
[01:12:16.809 --> 01:12:18.590]  It's the truth about Trump's Muslim ban.
[01:12:19.315 --> 01:12:22.316]  Donald Trump in doing what he said he would do.
[01:12:22.556 --> 01:12:23.096]  Shocker!
[01:12:23.196 --> 01:12:25.797]  That All Lives Matter crowd real quiet today on the Muslim ban.
[01:12:25.857 --> 01:12:29.278]  Here are the top five countries with the largest Muslim population.
[01:12:29.298 --> 01:12:35.259]  You'll notice that not a single Muslim from these countries is banned from entering the United States.
[01:12:35.359 --> 01:12:37.180]  Because it's not a Muslim ban.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.241]  It's a ban based on a list of terror-linked countries that was created by...
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.561]  The Obama administration.
[01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:45.921]  Oh, you didn't know that.
[01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:51.684]  You just swallowed the frothing hysteria generated by the mainstream media yet again.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:52.624]  Where were the protests?
[01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:57.946]  Where was the outrage when Obama banned all Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S.
[01:12:57.986 --> 01:12:59.667]  for six months back in 2011?
[01:12:59.727 --> 01:13:04.189]  Twice the amount of time they're banned for under this Trump executive order.
[01:13:04.329 --> 01:13:10.213]  Six times Obama banned migrants from mostly Muslim countries, and you were completely silent.
[01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:17.458]  Obama spent eight years dropping tens of thousands of bombs on Muslim countries, and you said absolutely nothing.
[01:13:17.678 --> 01:13:27.084]  He armed the jihadists who were responsible for creating the civil war in Syria that led to the refugee crisis, and most of you supported that.
[01:13:27.124 --> 01:13:32.468]  But Trump stops a handful of them from entering the U.S., and he's the dangerous racist Islamophobe.
[01:13:32.628 --> 01:13:42.516]  Despite the fact that refugee admissions under Trump over the course of 2017, around 50,000, will be in line with those admitted under previous administrations.
[01:13:42.596 --> 01:13:51.724]  You said nothing about Obama arming Saudi Arabia to slaughter Yemenis, yet now you're suddenly all concerned over Yemeni refugees.
[01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:52.985]  Give me a break.
[01:13:53.085 --> 01:13:56.428]  But Chuck Schumer's crying over Muslim migrants.
[01:13:56.588 --> 01:13:57.689]  This executive order
[01:14:05.187 --> 01:14:08.709]  ...was mean-spirited and un-American.
[01:14:08.769 --> 01:14:09.309]  Mommy!
[01:14:09.349 --> 01:14:14.952]  ...supported the attack on Libya that led directly to the deaths of thousands of Muslim migrants.
[01:14:15.092 --> 01:14:21.975]  And how many of you virtue-signalling celebrity twats have actually read the executive order?
[01:14:22.015 --> 01:14:24.196]  President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.
[01:14:24.277 --> 01:14:33.141]  No, the executive order contains an exemption for individuals like you, athletes or politicians, for example, to be allowed to enter the country.
[01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:33.401]  Again,
[01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:42.323]  Read the frigging text before amplifying the hysterical backlash that is based on media manipulation and total delusion.
[01:14:42.423 --> 01:14:43.264]  Statistics.
[01:14:43.584 --> 01:14:46.705]  Just two Americans killed annually by Islamic Jihadist immigrants.
[01:14:46.865 --> 01:14:58.528]  Okay, so one you've conveniently only included up until 2014, leaving out the 2015 San Bernardino attack where 14 Americans were killed by Tashfeen Malik.
[01:14:59.068 --> 01:15:00.949]  An Islamic Jihadist immigrant.
[01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:06.871]  And here's another 20 vetted refugees who turned to terrorism after being allowed to enter America.
[01:15:06.951 --> 01:15:19.715]  And two, the reason why less Americans than Europeans have been killed by Islamic Jihadist immigrants is because unlike Europe, America hasn't welcomed in millions of potential Islamic Jihadist immigrants.
[01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.796]  President Trump's ban on refugees and immigrants from certain countries is shameful and cruel.
[01:15:23.877 --> 01:15:31.139]  Yeah, you're the guy who shared a stage with an ISIS supporter nine times and said that people in the West will have to live with terrorism.
[01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.720]  Go screw yourself!
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.821]  To those fleeing persecution, terror and war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.
[01:15:37.061 --> 01:15:38.462]  Diversity is our strength.
[01:15:38.682 --> 01:15:42.103]  Unless you're a single male, in which case, you're not welcome.
[01:15:42.143 --> 01:15:43.144]  How to make terrorists 1.
[01:15:43.684 --> 01:15:45.725]  Ban everybody from a certain group from entering the country. 2.
[01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:46.825]  Wait.
[01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:51.168]  So you're saying that Muslims will become terrorists because Trump offended them?
[01:15:51.228 --> 01:15:54.249]  Wait, I thought that terrorism had nothing to do with Islam.
[01:15:54.289 --> 01:15:56.931]  Yeah, that sounds pretty Islamophobic if you ask me.
[01:15:57.051 --> 01:16:05.335]  And why would it be a good idea anyway to let in so many people who so easily resort to terrorism as you admitted in your tweet?
[01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:06.836]  You utter moron.
[01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.378]  This group of people will turn crazy violent if they don't get what they want.
[01:16:10.818 --> 01:16:11.859]  So you should let them in.
[01:16:12.379 --> 01:16:14.120]  The assassination is taking
[01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:26.644]  Right, so Trump's the bigot because he's persecuting refugees under the false pretext of preventing terrorism, and yet you want him to be assassinated by a terrorist.
[01:16:26.724 --> 01:16:28.405]  There are a billion and a half Muslims in the world.
[01:16:28.565 --> 01:16:31.466]  If we were all dangerous, you wouldn't be around to sign a Muslim ban.
[01:16:31.626 --> 01:16:35.147]  Is Trump supposed to be thankful to you for not assassinating him?
[01:16:35.287 --> 01:16:37.309]  Trump order begins by invoking 9-11 three times.
[01:16:37.329 --> 01:16:40.432]  9-11 hijackers were from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon.
[01:16:40.712 --> 01:16:41.953]  None of those countries banned.
[01:16:42.033 --> 01:16:53.724]  Well, A, they're considering adding more countries to the list, and B, you're saying that Trump's an unhinged dictator for banning Muslims, then asking him why he hasn't banned a hundred million more Muslims.
[01:16:53.884 --> 01:16:56.807]  Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US.
[01:16:56.847 --> 01:16:59.169]  They've done right, not wrong, and don't deserve to be rejected.
[01:16:59.369 --> 01:17:03.871]  Yeah, and 21% of Syrian refugees support ISIS.
[01:17:03.991 --> 01:17:08.713]  But let's just let them all in because a few Iraqi translators got held up at the airport.
[01:17:08.933 --> 01:17:10.734]  But despite everything I've said...
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.380]  I agree.
[01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:17.923]  Banning people from countries because of their religion is horrible, right?
[01:17:18.663 --> 01:17:20.324]  I mean, who would do such a thing?
[01:17:20.604 --> 01:17:21.084]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:17:21.124 --> 01:17:26.126]  How about the 16 Islamic countries that ban Israelis because of their religion?
[01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:30.068]  And where was the outcry when one of those countries, Saudi Arabia, left 300,000
[01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:38.994]  This is what it comes down to.
[01:17:39.235 --> 01:17:49.022]  The left and the mainstream media would rather see innocent Americans die at the hands of Islamic terrorists than allow Trump to be successful.
[01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:54.106]  The regressive left is a thousand times more outraged about this temporary travel ban
[01:17:54.426 --> 01:18:01.470]  Created by the Obama administration in the first place, and they are about actual Islamic terror attacks.
[01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:08.053]  And they are about the mangled bodies of dead children on the streets, be they Westerners or Muslims.
[01:18:08.113 --> 01:18:15.737]  They're more outraged at this than all the Muslim acid attacks, honor killings, throwing gays off buildings, stoning female rape victims to death.
[01:18:16.297 --> 01:18:17.117]  Put together.
[01:18:17.177 --> 01:18:21.978]  And they're all posing again, pretending to have the moral high ground because there were some protests.
[01:18:22.078 --> 01:18:29.340]  Protests that were bankrolled once again by George Soros, the guy who helped turn in Jewish refugees to the Nazis.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.861]  Yeah, there's your moral frigging high ground.
[01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:34.401]  And that's the truth about the Muslim ban.
[01:18:35.062 --> 01:18:36.282]  That isn't a Muslim ban.
[01:18:38.283 --> 01:18:43.067]  That report's on InfoWars.com, and listen, his reports are getting 3, 4, 5 million views apiece.
[01:18:43.467 --> 01:18:45.469]  Let's make them 10, 15, 20 million views.
[01:18:45.489 --> 01:18:47.130]  I mean, this is really important.
[01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:50.393]  Understand, one of his videos on average is bigger than Bill O'Reilly's show.
[01:18:50.954 --> 01:18:58.140]  That's why I keep pointing out that Trump still hasn't completely gotten the fact that the dinosaur media is over.
[01:18:59.181 --> 01:19:04.024]  Unless he just wants to sit there and obsess over the elderly viewers at nursing homes watching Fox News.
[01:19:05.005 --> 01:19:05.585]  I just want to throw that.
[01:19:05.605 --> 01:19:06.545]  I'm not attacking Fox News.
[01:19:06.586 --> 01:19:11.869]  It's just that they're attacking Trump so much, underhandedly, that it makes me sick.
[01:19:11.909 --> 01:19:15.191]  They go, oh, Trump's lying about this and that.
[01:19:15.211 --> 01:19:16.411]  He's a liar.
[01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.033]  He's a liar about 3 million illegals voting.
[01:19:19.053 --> 01:19:21.835]  And then the so-called Republican goes, no, he's just mistaken.
[01:19:22.455 --> 01:19:24.857]  Let's not call him a liar when it's way more than 3 million.
[01:19:25.977 --> 01:19:27.018]  We've gone over all that.
[01:19:28.424 --> 01:19:29.885]  So let's play this clip and then go to our guests.
[01:19:29.925 --> 01:19:38.951]  This is the German feminist march a weekend and a half ago, the day after the inauguration, and we have similar things that I witnessed and videotaped.
[01:19:38.971 --> 01:19:48.277]  We're going to put a larger video together soon of just them handing out American flag hajibs that women were putting on in solidarity with weird Islamic men handing it out, really getting off on it.
[01:19:48.377 --> 01:19:56.983]  I mean, this is the craziest crap, but it's a definite alliance between the Soros-controlled left and the Islamists, and it's just despicable.
[01:19:57.583 --> 01:20:06.946]  And their attack on reality is even more despicable when all Trump's doing is signing executive orders to implement the law that Obama signed in to law three years ago.
[01:20:07.506 --> 01:20:09.626]  But let's go ahead and go to the Allah Akbar.
[01:20:09.646 --> 01:20:19.969]  They don't even let women do call to prayer in Islamic countries.
[01:20:20.089 --> 01:20:22.330]  It's just a total cultural mutants.
[01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.050]  Let's go back to these women.
[01:20:25.931 --> 01:20:27.132]  I'm not trying to be mean to these women.
[01:20:27.892 --> 01:20:29.673]  But notice, they're all the women that are in charge.
[01:20:29.693 --> 01:20:30.513]  They all got short hair.
[01:20:30.773 --> 01:20:31.553]  They look like men.
[01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:33.894]  So they see in Islam that men are in charge.
[01:20:33.914 --> 01:20:37.936]  So you've got the butch women that are in charge and the little lipstick pretty girls.
[01:20:38.316 --> 01:20:40.577]  They're down below looking at their man up on the stage.
[01:20:40.657 --> 01:20:41.538]  And again, I've been at...
[01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:47.801]  I mean, I've been in a pool hall slash bowling alley with one of my friends who's a super good-looking wife.
[01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:48.521]  She's a beauty queen.
[01:20:48.902 --> 01:20:59.367]  And we literally had women with cigarettes rolled up like James Dean, wearing white t-shirts, walk over with duck's ass haircuts, literally like they were in a 50s movie, and try to muscle in on this woman.
[01:20:59.547 --> 01:21:00.528]  She was laughing at them.
[01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:09.533]  I mean, it's like they walked up to... I mean, this guy is my buddy, and he can bench press 400 pounds, like something like 30 times in a row, okay?
[01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:10.794]  Okay?
[01:21:11.721 --> 01:21:20.310]  I mean, but imagine literal, like, 120-pound women, like, muscling in like they're James Dean with little skinny arms, with tattoos, with a cigarette pack.
[01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:21.731]  It's like, is this a frickin' joke?
[01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:25.755]  Drinkin' beer and, like, cussin' at us and makin' comments.
[01:21:26.035 --> 01:21:27.377]  It was like super entertainment.
[01:21:27.597 --> 01:21:29.859]  These are crazy people, folks.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.963]  And now they don't just roll cigarettes up out of their arm like they're greasers from the 50s.
[01:21:36.298 --> 01:21:39.480]  Now they are going to become jihadis.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.101]  I mean, these are the most leaderless, idiotic people in the galaxy.
[01:21:43.301 --> 01:21:44.222]  He'll be with us the rest of the hour.
[01:21:44.262 --> 01:21:45.983]  Matt Bracken is our guest.
[01:21:46.743 --> 01:21:47.863]  And again, he's a best-selling author.
[01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:49.604]  We'll tell you his website here in a moment.
[01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.645]  But you've heard me the last 15 minutes.
[01:21:51.705 --> 01:21:53.086]  EnemiesFarnerDomestic.com.
[01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:55.687]  You've heard me here kind of breaking down the current insanity.
[01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:57.308]  You cannot make this up.
[01:21:57.348 --> 01:21:59.149]  They're so crazy.
[01:21:59.769 --> 01:22:03.931]  I know Soros is funding them, but this is over the top, and now we have
[01:22:04.875 --> 01:22:10.158]  Every day, the New York Times writer today, Vice Magazine saying, what a coup looks like.
[01:22:10.238 --> 01:22:11.179]  Time to coup Trump.
[01:22:11.479 --> 01:22:12.379]  Time to kill Trump.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]  And then nothing's being done.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.042]  I think they're really organizing and still planning this.
[01:22:16.062 --> 01:22:19.464]  So you haven't been on since he was inaugurated.
[01:22:19.744 --> 01:22:21.785]  Your predictions have pretty much come true so far.
[01:22:22.786 --> 01:22:27.088]  Now that we're post, you know, Trump being in nine days, he's totally delivering.
[01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.429]  What do you expect next from the enemy?
[01:22:29.977 --> 01:22:39.563]  Well, the media and their fellow travelers are completely in the blogosphere, are 100% virtually signaling for the assassination of Trump.
[01:22:40.104 --> 01:22:40.944]  That's what it's about.
[01:22:41.024 --> 01:22:42.505]  That's what Madonna said.
[01:22:42.565 --> 01:22:45.987]  That's what Ashley Judd basically, that's what they're all saying.
[01:22:46.007 --> 01:22:48.549]  You know, why hasn't he been assassinated yet?
[01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:51.231]  So they're sending the message out.
[01:22:51.846 --> 01:23:01.672]  You know, they're sending the frequency out to the emotionally unstable that they can be a hero to the left if they just go ahead and kill Trump.
[01:23:01.752 --> 01:23:08.055]  Like we've said before, like fire ants or honeybees, the pheromones being released by Madonna blow up the White House already.
[01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:08.976]  Right.
[01:23:09.036 --> 01:23:18.461]  And even during the campaign, I mean, just as a wild example, an English person, a Brit, traveled all the way to, I believe, California, tried to jump the
[01:23:20.564 --> 01:23:21.225]  The barricade.
[01:23:21.285 --> 01:23:21.885]  It was Nevada.
[01:23:21.925 --> 01:23:22.325]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.046]  He came to kill Trump.
[01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:23.886]  He said he was coming to kill him.
[01:23:24.527 --> 01:23:35.273]  But he was somebody who was, you know, the psychologists tend to separate killers into the organized and disorganized.
[01:23:35.713 --> 01:23:40.556]  You have to be somewhat organized to get yourself organized all the way from the UK to a Trump rally.
[01:23:40.756 --> 01:23:42.718]  It's not like he's, you know, a slobbering idiot.
[01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:48.161]  But imagine how many people a little bit more organized than that are ready to go off.
[01:23:48.821 --> 01:23:49.582]  And with the
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:24:00.267]  You know, I think that what I'm calling for next, what I'm, I call this the SDS to Weather Underground movement, just like in 1968.
[01:24:00.427 --> 01:24:01.708]  I agree.
[01:24:01.728 --> 01:24:03.489]  This is Weather Underground Part 2.
[01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:05.211]  Right.
[01:24:05.971 --> 01:24:16.319]  When it looked like Hubert Humphrey might come after Lyndon Baines Johnson, this meant that the Democrats would still be in charge of the federal government.
[01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:21.021]  That's when Bill Ayers was a leader of the Students for the Democratic Society.
[01:24:21.741 --> 01:24:33.092]  But when Nixon came in and, you know, the State Department and other federal agencies were revamped by Republicans, they went paranoid, they went underground, they split into cells.
[01:24:33.712 --> 01:24:37.616]  And what happens when these guys split into cells and go underground?
[01:24:38.216 --> 01:24:41.319]  Because they're afraid that, you know, Jeff Sessions is going to have them all rounded up.
[01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:44.626]  When they go underground, they become paranoid.
[01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:47.947]  You know, they're looking out through the blinds, you know, for the surveillance cameras.
[01:24:47.967 --> 01:24:53.529]  Well, by the way, I mean, they should be paranoid, but right now they're really arrogant, openly calling for murder in a crazed mode.
[01:24:54.209 --> 01:25:02.072]  And we can see what happened with the so-called, and I'm using the mainstream media hysteria, the so-called Muslim ban.
[01:25:02.879 --> 01:25:07.241]  They can get thousands of people out to airports immediately.
[01:25:07.261 --> 01:25:08.842]  I mean, like, within hours.
[01:25:09.102 --> 01:25:11.203]  Oh no, they've got a list of over 20 million people.
[01:25:11.243 --> 01:25:14.625]  Soros has a database of 20 million through MoveOn, and they hit the button now.
[01:25:14.665 --> 01:25:17.807]  And what I've noticed in all these demonstrations is they're led by Muslims.
[01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:21.649]  Muslims are leading in this country on insurrection.
[01:25:21.729 --> 01:25:22.269]  It's incredible.
[01:25:23.092 --> 01:25:41.060]  Right, and I saw in, I forget if it was in, it might have been in Dallas, Fort Worth, but they were doing the call to prayer, you know, the lined up like magnetic filings, you know, towards their, their cult object over there in Mecca, you know, with the butts in the air, right in American airports.
[01:25:41.661 --> 01:25:44.442]  So at any point, they could shut airports down.
[01:25:44.522 --> 01:25:50.565]  I mean, so if there's something bigger, and which is where I'd like to, I'd like to kind of talk about Quebec.
[01:25:51.121 --> 01:25:53.663]  Because I think people are not seeing what really happened in Quebec.
[01:25:53.683 --> 01:25:55.044]  Oh, you mean the attack on the Muslims?
[01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:57.146]  They've spun this that this is a terror attack on Muslims.
[01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.168]  Some outlets are even saying because of Trump.
[01:25:59.228 --> 01:26:01.150]  No, it's jihadis killing other Muslims.
[01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:01.610]  Break it down.
[01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.930]  Right.
[01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:03.592]  But there's another layer to this.
[01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:09.156]  Now, the Daily Beast, you can see what the frequency they're on is, you know, they're totally on receive mode.
[01:26:09.617 --> 01:26:15.602]  The Daily Beast actually ran a fake news story showing, you know, two white guys like at a rifle range.
[01:26:16.377 --> 01:26:19.098]  With their names as the shooters.
[01:26:19.198 --> 01:26:20.959]  They had to take it down after a couple of hours.
[01:26:21.019 --> 01:26:27.062]  So some fake news site puts up, you know, two French white guys, French-Canadian white guys with guns.
[01:26:27.622 --> 01:26:29.883]  Daily Beast has got it running immediately.
[01:26:30.243 --> 01:26:33.805]  Soros could have activated, had millions of people on the street.
[01:26:34.785 --> 01:26:36.126]  The burndown of the cities begins.
[01:26:36.886 --> 01:26:43.909]  I think that what happened in Quebec was an abortive, false, you know, in Quebec City was a FUBAR
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.329]  False flag operation.
[01:26:47.944 --> 01:26:53.406]  Typically, suicide jihadists don't do these kind of things like a commando.
[01:26:54.226 --> 01:26:57.627]  Omar Mateen didn't wear a black mask and have a getaway plan.
[01:26:58.328 --> 01:27:02.249]  The San Bernardino killers didn't wear black masks and have a getaway plan.
[01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:02.909]  No, I get it.
[01:27:02.929 --> 01:27:07.731]  If you're going to run a false flag against Muslims, you obviously have Muslims do it, but then they get caught.
[01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:10.272]  I noticed they were in tactical gear and covered and ran.
[01:27:10.512 --> 01:27:12.793]  They usually kill themselves when it's a real Islamic attack.
[01:27:12.993 --> 01:27:14.133]  Well, you're onto something big here.
[01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:14.733]  Break this down.
[01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:15.714]  Start over.
[01:27:15.754 --> 01:27:16.734]  Take your time to break this down.
[01:27:17.785 --> 01:27:28.253]  Yeah, some of the initial reports were that they were using AK-47s, yet there are only, I believe, six killed, eight wounded, something like that.
[01:27:28.734 --> 01:27:32.277]  My numbers might be changing as people die in the hospital.
[01:27:33.077 --> 01:27:39.302]  An AK-47 loaded with 30 rounds fired into a crowd of people is going to kill and injure a lot more people than that.
[01:27:39.863 --> 01:27:41.524]  I put this down to reporters
[01:27:43.269 --> 01:27:47.651]  Reflexively calling any kind of a semi-automatic rifle an AK-47.
[01:27:48.372 --> 01:27:50.973]  I saw somewhere, I couldn't find it again.
[01:27:51.013 --> 01:27:52.494]  I should have been taking notes this morning.
[01:27:52.994 --> 01:28:02.299]  It might have been actually an SKS or a pair of SKS rifles they were using, which are loaded from a stripper clip with 10 rounds apiece.
[01:28:02.839 --> 01:28:08.202]  Several of the reports that I read said that the shooters had to stop and reload frequently.
[01:28:08.702 --> 01:28:10.363]  One of the reports that I read
[01:28:10.803 --> 01:28:20.162]  He said that one of the mosque congregants tried to, you know, assault the ambush, counterattack during a reload and got shot for it.
[01:28:21.495 --> 01:28:25.898]  No matter what your religion is, if you attack a shooter like that, you are a hero in my book, period.
[01:28:26.798 --> 01:28:40.126]  So, their plan for a mass attack, like on the level of San Bernardino or Orlando, might have gone off the rails due to their lack of familiarity with the weapons, inability to reload correctly.
[01:28:40.146 --> 01:28:43.268]  There are reports they went in and out trying to reload.
[01:28:43.748 --> 01:28:44.769]  Finally, they fled.
[01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:52.078]  The Alexander Bissonnette, the blue-eyed French-Canadian possible convert to Islam.
[01:28:52.698 --> 01:29:07.229]  I'm thinking that the other guy, Mohammed Qadir, the Moroccan, he might have been planning to use this little kind of like dweeby looking, the guy with the chess club looking dude, you know, with his Facebook picture with the chess pieces.
[01:29:08.112 --> 01:29:11.194]  He might have been planned to be the Patsy.
[01:29:11.674 --> 01:29:13.915]  You know, the white guy found at the scene.
[01:29:14.296 --> 01:29:18.418]  Not sure if he's, you know, already on the radar as a convert or not.
[01:29:18.778 --> 01:29:24.041]  So he might have been a secret convert that Mohammed Qadir was going to use as the Patsy.
[01:29:24.522 --> 01:29:26.423]  You know, the white French-Canadian.
[01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:30.045]  Then they get away and the whole world goes crazy.
[01:29:30.325 --> 01:29:31.365]  We gotta go to break, Matt Bracken.
[01:29:31.385 --> 01:29:33.446]  We're gonna come back and talk more about this straight ahead.
[01:29:33.466 --> 01:29:37.567]  Then we're gonna look at more of this article's coming out saying, kill Trump.
[01:29:37.907 --> 01:29:40.328]  We need a, you know, major event.
[01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:43.409]  We've gotta take action, you know, now.
[01:29:43.489 --> 01:29:44.469]  We need to have a coup.
[01:29:45.529 --> 01:29:46.609]  What are they gonna do next?
[01:29:46.649 --> 01:29:48.130]  Because clearly, they're arrogant.
[01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:50.631]  Look at how Brennan outgoing attacked Trump.
[01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:51.791]  They're very arrogant.
[01:29:51.811 --> 01:29:52.591]  They're planning something.
[01:29:52.731 --> 01:29:53.611]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.111 --> 01:29:55.712]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.632 --> 01:29:59.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:08.073]  Now I want to go back to Darren McBrain and Margaret Howell.
[01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:17.438]  You had actually one of these precious snowflakes was telling us a very personal clip about how he felt about this and what he was going to do.
[01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:19.899]  Let's go back to Darren and Margaret.
[01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:24.021]  This is an urgent message from a liberal in distress.
[01:30:25.242 --> 01:30:31.605]  So we take you now to an underground bunker deep in the heart of the land of idiocracy.
[01:30:34.673 --> 01:30:37.295]  Well, here we are, folks, at the end of everything.
[01:30:37.315 --> 01:30:41.278]  Human civilization, as we know it, is coming crashing down.
[01:30:42.639 --> 01:30:43.460]  The world is over.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.761]  Donald Trump will be sworn in this week.
[01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:47.883]  And then it's all over.
[01:30:47.903 --> 01:30:48.944]  It's all over, guys.
[01:30:49.664 --> 01:30:50.385]  I'm so scared.
[01:30:50.605 --> 01:30:52.987]  I'm so alone and so scared.
[01:30:53.507 --> 01:30:54.948]  This can't be real.
[01:30:54.968 --> 01:30:56.189]  Please don't even ask.
[01:30:56.209 --> 01:31:00.272]  We elected for the first time someone who is selfish, dishonest, egotistical.
[01:31:00.733 --> 01:31:01.293]  For the first time.
[01:31:01.313 --> 01:31:02.734]  And we could have had Hillary Clinton instead.
[01:31:03.996 --> 01:31:05.278]  And now we're going to pay the price.
[01:31:06.539 --> 01:31:08.541]  We can survive this, okay?
[01:31:08.662 --> 01:31:11.205]  We can survive it, but you have to get underground.
[01:31:12.146 --> 01:31:17.672]  And I am at my mom's house where I've been temporarily rooming for the last 31 years.
[01:31:18.293 --> 01:31:21.397]  And I'm down in the basement, as you can see.
[01:31:21.597 --> 01:31:24.240]  I've made kind of a bunker for myself here in the basement.
[01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:28.976]  You've got to get underground now because we don't have a lot of time.
[01:31:28.996 --> 01:31:35.945]  Look, based on everything that I've read on Facebook, right after the inauguration, Donald Trump is going to drop.
[01:31:36.733 --> 01:31:37.493]  Gender non-conforming.
[01:31:57.141 --> 01:32:02.403]  100 billion gallons of oil into the ocean in order to kill all of the dolphins.
[01:32:03.323 --> 01:32:11.705]  And then, based on what I've heard from people like Keith Olbermann, he is going to blow up Jupiter with a death ray.
[01:32:12.946 --> 01:32:20.408]  And finally, the last act of cruelty and sadism, the last straw for all mankind will be when he blocks
[01:32:21.485 --> 01:32:23.685]  CNN reporters on Twitter.
[01:32:24.286 --> 01:32:31.767]  This is all going to unfold very quickly, so you need to prepare yourself now, and if you have not been stocking supplies and foods, you gotta do that.
[01:32:32.767 --> 01:32:39.208]  I have all of the supplies I'm going to need to survive the apocalypse right here, and I wanted to show you a few of the things I have on sale right now.
[01:32:39.228 --> 01:32:48.710]  You're obviously going to need a lot of non-perishable food items, including yogurt, vegan, plant-based of course, other survival foods, pita chips,
[01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:50.591]  Gluten-free, obviously.
[01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:53.894]  That's a great parody piece, but let's talk about what you really do eat.
[01:32:53.954 --> 01:32:56.456]  Agreed, I don't think that's gonna stop you from that death ray.
[01:32:56.496 --> 01:32:56.836]  Oh, damn.
[01:32:57.116 --> 01:32:58.177]  Okay.
[01:33:07.684 --> 01:33:13.008]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:14.304 --> 01:33:21.027]  The truth is humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:33:21.067 --> 01:33:26.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:44.859 --> 01:33:49.968]  I've got to say it, to see the throngs of human trash.
[01:33:51.813 --> 01:33:59.298]  The Globalists have organized into these mobs of weird feminists with the men all walking behind them.
[01:33:59.779 --> 01:34:01.480]  And they announce, I walk behind my woman.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.161]  It's the opposite of equality.
[01:34:03.481 --> 01:34:08.645]  And then the women take their orders from weird Islamist men of the most radical Wahhabi of sex.
[01:34:09.305 --> 01:34:11.226]  And I saw it on the ground in D.C.
[01:34:11.246 --> 01:34:14.449]  when I was there, not this Saturday, but last Saturday, nine days ago, eight days ago.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.002]  I was doing live Facebook mentions and I'm like, these people are walking by saying, F you white male.
[01:34:19.022 --> 01:34:20.002]  They're almost all white women.
[01:34:20.602 --> 01:34:21.803]  They're putting on hijabs.
[01:34:21.843 --> 01:34:25.545]  They have hijab signs saying solidarity, you know, with Islam.
[01:34:26.605 --> 01:34:29.326]  And the men are all walking behind the women, very proud of it.
[01:34:29.366 --> 01:34:30.647]  And then we caught it on video.
[01:34:33.548 --> 01:34:35.810]  It's just, it's, it's so crazy.
[01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:38.231]  And I said, it's like Muslims are running it.
[01:34:38.311 --> 01:34:40.552]  And then it turns out the main organizers,
[01:34:41.784 --> 01:34:49.090]  Is a woman who supports Sharia law and calls that the empowerment for women and the other main organizer is a guy who's tied into Hamas and all this stuff.
[01:34:49.991 --> 01:34:50.851]  And you're like, really?
[01:34:50.872 --> 01:35:08.446]  In what alternate dimension do spoiled rotten Western women bitch about the cradle of them being spoiled and then want to not join Islam but like bring it in because it's anti-America or it's anti-Western?
[01:35:10.327 --> 01:35:12.328]  I mean, it is just mind-blowing.
[01:35:12.348 --> 01:35:14.369]  And again, if you're a radio listener, you hear me saying all this.
[01:35:14.389 --> 01:35:20.432]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can see the live video feeds.
[01:35:20.452 --> 01:35:21.593]  We're actually showing you all of this.
[01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:22.573]  And you look at the women.
[01:35:22.793 --> 01:35:24.134]  They kind of have two casts, I've noticed.
[01:35:24.154 --> 01:35:25.315]  Jim Bracken's an expert on Islam.
[01:35:25.675 --> 01:35:28.296]  I just noticed it as a layperson who studies this.
[01:35:29.036 --> 01:35:30.177]  Most women are like total slaves.
[01:35:30.197 --> 01:35:32.698]  There's always kind of like a house slave woman who's kind of the boss.
[01:35:33.058 --> 01:35:34.499]  You'll even see them kind of commanding
[01:35:37.972 --> 01:35:38.693]  Other women around.
[01:35:38.753 --> 01:35:43.898]  When I was there in D.C., I saw this lady at the airport commanding a bunch of men.
[01:35:43.918 --> 01:35:44.839]  Let's put her back on screen.
[01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:47.241]  It's funny The Daily Caller talks about how she runs the whole show.
[01:35:47.582 --> 01:35:49.103]  I saw her ordering people around.
[01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:51.486]  And man, she looks evil.
[01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:54.749]  It's like there's a commitment to domination and enslavement.
[01:35:55.805 --> 01:35:57.186]  It's just so creepy.
[01:35:57.246 --> 01:36:02.611]  It's like watching that husband and wife in Syria getting their little seven-year-old ready to blow herself up.
[01:36:02.671 --> 01:36:03.992]  She looks so sad, but they make her do it.
[01:36:04.452 --> 01:36:07.494]  I mean, it's just my gut says I want to fight that lady.
[01:36:08.595 --> 01:36:10.237]  My gut says that's an enemy right there.
[01:36:11.855 --> 01:36:15.198]  And it's just so twisted.
[01:36:16.018 --> 01:36:17.119]  It's so twisted.
[01:36:17.459 --> 01:36:18.220]  And they bully.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.181]  They got studies in Iran.
[01:36:20.201 --> 01:36:21.582]  80% of the people don't want to be under it.
[01:36:21.983 --> 01:36:25.145]  Most Muslims actually don't want to be under the radical Islam or orthodox Islam.
[01:36:25.485 --> 01:36:27.487]  But the point is they're run by really bad people.
[01:36:27.727 --> 01:36:34.572]  So Islam itself from the head towards the tail just gets more rotten as you get towards the head.
[01:36:35.663 --> 01:36:37.485]  Now I'm going to go back to Richard Bracken here in a moment.
[01:36:37.826 --> 01:36:41.710]  Be sure to check out his website, EnemiesForeignToDomestic.com.
[01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:44.233]  Check out his books there, where he breaks all this down.
[01:36:44.614 --> 01:36:47.918]  I'm going to get on an airplane tomorrow and fly out to be on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[01:36:48.619 --> 01:36:52.163]  Probably the biggest podcast out there, where the show is just a podcast.
[01:36:54.466 --> 01:36:56.768]  Words something like 20 million people downloaded a week or watch it.
[01:36:56.808 --> 01:36:58.009]  So I'm excited to be on that.
[01:36:58.290 --> 01:37:00.051]  They talk about me basically every week on the deal.
[01:37:00.071 --> 01:37:06.056]  I've been friends with Joe since 1998 and it's just never happened because he wants people in studio.
[01:37:06.076 --> 01:37:07.137]  He's been on our show many times.
[01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:09.279]  So I'll obviously interview him too while I'm out there.
[01:37:09.319 --> 01:37:10.540]  So that's gonna happen.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.426]  Reach out to all his great listeners and viewers with what's happening in the world because Joe's gone from you know
[01:37:18.057 --> 01:37:21.139]  17, 18 years ago, kind of laughing at me, and now just going, man, this is scary.
[01:37:21.619 --> 01:37:22.600]  It's not coming true.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.681]  It was already true.
[01:37:24.061 --> 01:37:26.222]  Now it's just being openly distributed.
[01:37:27.023 --> 01:37:28.303]  But globalism was always there.
[01:37:28.364 --> 01:37:31.545]  Now it's just going global and really taking over.
[01:37:31.926 --> 01:37:34.467]  We're going to end a big special this week.
[01:37:34.487 --> 01:37:39.150]  That's 25% off our amazing Alexa Pure Gravity Fed Stainless Steel Water Filtration System.
[01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:40.151]  It's the very best out there.
[01:37:40.571 --> 01:37:44.974]  Already a great price, the normal price, but 25% off, depending on the unit, $130, $140,
[01:37:47.835 --> 01:37:49.096]  $19, $200-something.
[01:37:49.397 --> 01:37:50.798]  We've got big units, small units.
[01:37:50.818 --> 01:37:51.338]  They're amazing.
[01:37:51.378 --> 01:37:53.320]  And the Alexa Pure Breeze, again, $149.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.101]  Normally, $220-something.
[01:37:54.241 --> 01:37:55.722]  Our regular discount's $199.
[01:37:55.762 --> 01:37:56.443]  It's $149.96 right now.
[01:37:56.463 --> 01:37:57.344]  Comparable units are $400, $500.
[01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:58.985]  So, definitely check it out today.
[01:37:59.005 --> 01:37:59.385]  InfoWarsTore.
[01:38:10.372 --> 01:38:13.593]  All of our nutraceuticals are about to sell out, like Supramel Vitality.
[01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:17.235]  We got 10% off on Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12.
[01:38:17.555 --> 01:38:19.956]  Now back in stock, taken sublingually under the tongue.
[01:38:19.996 --> 01:38:20.496]  It's amazing.
[01:38:20.916 --> 01:38:21.476]  Check that out.
[01:38:21.516 --> 01:38:22.637]  But here's what I'm gonna tell you.
[01:38:23.437 --> 01:38:24.057]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:38:24.737 --> 01:38:25.798]  No one can deny.
[01:38:27.372 --> 01:38:33.156]  That InfoWars is the most effective right now against the New World Order other than President Trump and Drudge.
[01:38:33.176 --> 01:38:35.437]  So it's like President Trump, Drudge, then InfoWars.
[01:38:36.078 --> 01:38:37.079]  And our great team here.
[01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:38.580]  We need your prayer.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:39.780]  We need your support.
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:47.906]  We need for all of you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the great items you need like water filtration, Patriot t-shirts.
[01:38:48.266 --> 01:38:55.311]  I cannot stress enough to you if you wear a Trump is my President shirt out in public, how many like-minded folks you're going to meet.
[01:38:55.451 --> 01:38:56.612]  You'll also meet people yelling at you.
[01:38:57.523 --> 01:38:59.143]  You got to go out and exercise your free speech or lose it.
[01:38:59.643 --> 01:39:03.004]  I cannot stress enough to you how important it is.
[01:39:03.044 --> 01:39:05.225]  So it's all a win-win when you get the products.
[01:39:05.825 --> 01:39:19.788]  So I want to commend you all for your support and ask you again to realize how far we've already come together in this fight and to think about shopping with the good guys when you get high quality storable foods or shortwave radios or tents.
[01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:25.977]  Or thermal gear, or lowers for ARs, or Molon Lab and Koozies.
[01:39:26.257 --> 01:39:28.981]  You know, stuff that costs $3 to stuff that costs $1,000.
[01:39:29.662 --> 01:39:31.805]  We've got solar generator systems, you name it.
[01:39:32.816 --> 01:39:35.798]  Made in America, classic woven flags.
[01:39:36.779 --> 01:39:40.441]  We've got citizen press t-shirts and so much more.
[01:39:40.461 --> 01:39:46.325]  A lot of new t-shirts at Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:39:46.585 --> 01:39:47.966]  But look at how far we've come.
[01:39:48.386 --> 01:39:52.089]  Look, I only plan to hire three or four more camera people and editors and maybe a few more reporters.
[01:39:52.509 --> 01:39:55.211]  I'm going to open a Washington bureau because it's the right thing to do in D.C.
[01:39:55.551 --> 01:39:58.453]  Now that we're retaking the country, we need to be at that key beachhead battle.
[01:39:58.773 --> 01:40:00.134]  I'm going to be up there at least once a month now.
[01:40:00.154 --> 01:40:01.415]  I'm just going to let you know that point blank.
[01:40:03.577 --> 01:40:12.043]  I'm going to create a larger bureau here in Austin, one in London, because history's happening and we're so effective.
[01:40:12.544 --> 01:40:15.886]  I meant to just wake people up and see other people pop up that would be more effective than us.
[01:40:16.267 --> 01:40:17.508]  I don't like having to organize stuff.
[01:40:17.528 --> 01:40:18.709]  I don't like having to do all this.
[01:40:19.269 --> 01:40:21.231]  But I'm not complaining at the same time.
[01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:22.932]  I just know it's my destiny.
[01:40:23.012 --> 01:40:23.473]  I'm doing it.
[01:40:23.533 --> 01:40:24.274]  I'm an all out.
[01:40:24.814 --> 01:40:28.057]  We quite frankly don't have the money to launch all these expansions.
[01:40:28.417 --> 01:40:31.940]  But every time I expand on faith, and I don't mean to be cheesy, it's true.
[01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:33.762]  My gut knows we're going to build it.
[01:40:34.263 --> 01:40:35.183]  It's going to be successful.
[01:40:35.203 --> 01:40:37.666]  I'm going to pour our reserves, our backups.
[01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:39.914]  If I have to, I'll sell my house.
[01:40:40.474 --> 01:40:40.775]  Okay?
[01:40:41.015 --> 01:40:45.240]  I'm going to do this because people give their lives for the basic freedoms.
[01:40:45.501 --> 01:40:50.227]  We're now facing a naked enemy that openly admits it wants to enslave us and kill our president.
[01:40:51.148 --> 01:40:53.030]  They tried to kill Nigel Farage three times, folks.
[01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:54.012]  That's why he got out of politics.
[01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:56.077]  I don't know.
[01:41:17.874 --> 01:41:26.227]  Today in Vice Magazine saying what would happen within minutes and hours of a coup in America and and all these Jezebels calling for Trump's death.
[01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:28.991]  They wouldn't be doing this if they hadn't been given a green light.
[01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:29.993]  You wouldn't have
[01:41:31.016 --> 01:41:35.980]  People like McCain calling for Trump's removal, and the former CIA director saying he's despicable, remove him.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.322]  But they didn't have some powerful people behind them.
[01:41:38.702 --> 01:41:43.586]  They've gotten in some rooms, they're all hyped up, the word's gone out, we're taking over, we're gonna kill.
[01:41:44.246 --> 01:41:45.007]  And you know what?
[01:41:45.087 --> 01:41:46.508]  I'm not looking for trouble, but here's the deal.
[01:41:46.608 --> 01:41:47.669]  I'm 100% committed.
[01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:51.692]  And we're doing everything we can to affect the battle space and informational.
[01:41:54.093 --> 01:41:57.155]  The problem is, I know we're going to wipe these people out if a shooting war starts.
[01:41:57.916 --> 01:42:01.199]  I just, they're such crap, it's not even worth losing our patriots in a fight.
[01:42:01.219 --> 01:42:01.679]  But you know what?
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:03.280]  That's what waters the tree.
[01:42:03.921 --> 01:42:07.344]  So I don't sit up here and shoot my mouth off about violence all day like you people do, but just understand.
[01:42:07.844 --> 01:42:09.465]  People are making a list, they're marking it twice.
[01:42:09.585 --> 01:42:09.986]  I'm not.
[01:42:10.226 --> 01:42:11.307]  The guys that know how to do it are.
[01:42:11.747 --> 01:42:14.589]  And all of you are in for a big surprise within
[01:42:15.570 --> 01:42:17.651]  Hours of you killing Trump or pulling something.
[01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:20.113]  You just signed your own you-know-what warrant.
[01:42:20.613 --> 01:42:22.074]  Matt Bracken, take over for the rest of the hour.
[01:42:22.094 --> 01:42:25.996]  I've said my pieces, but I want you to talk about that and just all these other angles.
[01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:26.336]  Go ahead.
[01:42:27.317 --> 01:42:31.319]  Yeah, I was going back to Quebec City.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:41.365]  I think it's really important for people to understand something because we just dodged a bullet up there because I'm convinced this was meant to be a major, major false flag operation.
[01:42:41.405 --> 01:42:43.206]  While they had their people in the streets?
[01:42:43.446 --> 01:42:44.487]  While they were activating them?
[01:42:45.276 --> 01:42:50.699]  Yeah, I need to use an analogy, and I'm not, I don't mean to use this analogy for anything to do with explosives.
[01:42:50.759 --> 01:42:53.240]  It's just to understand how this works.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:03.645]  If you're setting off a fertilizer bomb, which is, you know, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, ANFO, you can't throw a match in it, the match will go out.
[01:43:04.385 --> 01:43:08.607]  You can't even throw a blasting cap in it, the blasting cap will just blow some ANFO around.
[01:43:09.207 --> 01:43:10.708]  You need to have a progression.
[01:43:11.408 --> 01:43:14.630]  The match lights the blast, the fuse lights the blasting cap,
[01:43:15.362 --> 01:43:15.842]  It was a misfire.
[01:43:36.454 --> 01:43:37.735]  Yeah, it was a misfire.
[01:43:37.995 --> 01:43:38.455]  Exactly.
[01:43:38.495 --> 01:43:46.738]  That's why they went from Daily Beast at the crack of dawn this morning showing two white French guys with rifles to having to retract it.
[01:43:46.758 --> 01:43:47.879]  They were already primed.
[01:43:48.599 --> 01:43:48.819]  Right.
[01:43:49.319 --> 01:43:50.260]  They were primed.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.741]  And the people were already at the airports.
[01:43:52.801 --> 01:43:58.683]  Imagine how easy it would be to shut this country down with people just acting a little bit more hysterical at the airports.
[01:43:58.863 --> 01:44:00.604]  The country would come to a halt.
[01:44:01.144 --> 01:44:04.846]  So if, imagine, and this is what we have to, the reason I'm talking about this is
[01:44:05.755 --> 01:44:14.281]  Next hour or next week, this can happen and we need people to be tuned in for the likelihood that this will be a false flag operation.
[01:44:14.682 --> 01:44:25.290]  And unlike Quebec City, it might be a very successful false flag operation where there's a white patsy, you know, with a smoking AK-47 dead outside the mosque.
[01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:29.413]  By the way, you were saying this from memory, we've got to find the tape, six months ago.
[01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:34.683]  Yeah, it's going to happen where it'll be, you know, somebody shooting it from an overpass.
[01:44:34.703 --> 01:44:35.363]  You're right, you're right.
[01:44:35.403 --> 01:44:37.784]  Their only move is to make themselves the victim.
[01:44:38.364 --> 01:44:39.385]  You're absolutely right, Matt.
[01:44:39.425 --> 01:44:40.565]  It's not a question of if but when.
[01:44:41.265 --> 01:44:58.753]  Well, they're already on in the streets because then it'll go from in the streets to doing something that is extremely disruptive, such as, you know, storming through airport security, which would absolutely just stop air traffic around
[01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:00.894]  Which they mean to plunge the stock market with.
[01:45:01.214 --> 01:45:06.435]  Soros made moves against the stock market today in conjunction with demonizing Trump, so they're already trying that.
[01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:15.759]  In fact, it appears they had it all set with this false flag, you're probably right, and the riots they already had primed for a stock market plunge to blame Trump, but it failed.
[01:45:16.599 --> 01:45:19.680]  Right, and the moment is lost because
[01:45:20.726 --> 01:45:29.815]  You know, gradually the new media gets the word out that these six countries were just Obama's terror, failed terror states.
[01:45:30.276 --> 01:45:38.624]  These are nations like Libya and Sudan and Yemen that we don't, or Somalia, nobody that's useful to our country comes out of there.
[01:45:38.684 --> 01:45:40.466]  Well they don't even really have real airports, right?
[01:45:40.546 --> 01:45:41.828]  I mean, places like Somalia.
[01:45:42.631 --> 01:45:45.733]  You can't go there and stay alive if you're a white Christian.
[01:45:45.773 --> 01:45:47.514]  You'd be dead or kidnapped in a week.
[01:45:47.954 --> 01:46:07.807]  But if this attack in Quebec City had worked, God help us, right now the country would be in a... If, let's say, 50 Muslims had been killed and there was a blue-eyed Quebecois outside dead, which I think is one of the ways that this scenario was intended to play out,
[01:46:08.413 --> 01:46:13.797]  Yeah, I think that Mohammed Qadir, he's not, I don't think, I don't see him as the mastermind, it's possible.
[01:46:14.318 --> 01:46:18.681]  I see him as, you know, Patsy 1 and Patsy 2, Bissonnette and Qadir.
[01:46:19.562 --> 01:46:22.564]  But somebody, there's some Dr. Raul X out there,
[01:46:23.191 --> 01:46:26.354]  You know, that's organizing these, and it won't be the last.
[01:46:26.434 --> 01:46:27.855]  Believe me, this will not be the last.
[01:46:27.955 --> 01:46:31.318]  Oh, I'm so glad I got you on, because I knew something was fishy.
[01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:38.864]  But no, you add how they tried to plunge the stock market this morning, how they put out the fake news, and the site you mentioned is synced with Soros.
[01:46:39.825 --> 01:46:43.248]  Yeah, oh, they got caught in a dry run, or it misfired.
[01:46:44.122 --> 01:46:45.383]  I think it was a misfire.
[01:46:45.903 --> 01:46:48.264]  And the left will try to just bury the story.
[01:46:48.344 --> 01:46:49.625]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:46:50.105 --> 01:46:56.169]  At 10 o'clock, I was just, right at the top of the hour, 10 o'clock this morning Eastern, I was flipping between what the fire was like.
[01:46:56.189 --> 01:47:00.531]  That's your other big tell, the fact that they jump on it immediately and then it evaporates, show it didn't go where they wanted.
[01:47:00.651 --> 01:47:01.272]  It's gone.
[01:47:01.292 --> 01:47:03.973]  It just didn't, it's like an un-story, a non-story.
[01:47:04.493 --> 01:47:10.817]  If this had been a white guy with an AK-47 dead outside of a mosque with 50 dead Muslims inside,
[01:47:11.817 --> 01:47:15.759]  The people that are at the airports now would be shutting the airports down.
[01:47:15.819 --> 01:47:17.700]  And it would legitimize all them out there.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:21.202]  Oh look, Trump supporter goes and does this, but he lived.
[01:47:21.522 --> 01:47:24.644]  The dumb mind control or easily influenced idiot lived.
[01:47:25.084 --> 01:47:27.045]  And so now it's not, you can see it now.
[01:47:27.505 --> 01:47:28.366]  Matt, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:29.006 --> 01:47:30.607]  They absolutely had the whole thing set up.
[01:47:31.087 --> 01:47:34.430]  A lot of times these guys go off at the wrong time.
[01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:41.417]  Going back to the weather underground, you know, the bomb meant for the Fort Dix Officers Club dance goes off in the townhouse.
[01:47:42.438 --> 01:47:43.059]  In this case,
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.581]  I'm not sure because there are the reports of the Al-Akbar.
[01:47:48.141 --> 01:47:53.422]  I'm not sure if Mohammed Qadir had one idea and Bissonnette had another about how it was going to play out.
[01:47:53.962 --> 01:48:03.624]  But if you go on Gates of Vienna or Vlad Tepes blog, Rebel Media, which is a Canadian YouTube channel, I'm sure will be all over this.
[01:48:04.424 --> 01:48:06.964]  We need to look carefully into the Canadian connections.
[01:48:07.004 --> 01:48:10.085]  There were apparently two competing mosques up there.
[01:48:10.645 --> 01:48:12.045]  There's a more radical mosque.
[01:48:12.714 --> 01:48:14.374]  And a more moderate mosque.
[01:48:14.434 --> 01:48:16.775]  The moderate mosque is the one that was attacked.
[01:48:17.035 --> 01:48:19.055]  Sure, that's the way it always is.
[01:48:19.355 --> 01:48:21.596]  This is a classic profile of a false flag.
[01:48:22.356 --> 01:48:27.977]  You know, the Bolsheviks set off a bomb at the Mensheviks and blame it on the Russian cadets.
[01:48:28.377 --> 01:48:28.998]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:48:29.378 --> 01:48:31.358]  Sure, they ran false flags against the white Russians.
[01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:32.218]  Right.
[01:48:32.258 --> 01:48:34.719]  You don't run a false flag against your own mosque.
[01:48:35.539 --> 01:48:38.140]  You run a false flag against the moderate mosque.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.580]  Yeah, you kill two birds with one stone.
[01:48:40.788 --> 01:48:42.169]  Right, you kill two birds with one stone.
[01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:45.710]  Plus it makes it more sympathetic that it's a liberal mosque.
[01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:51.132]  Right, and you wear a mask because they might have recognized you at that mosque.
[01:48:51.172 --> 01:48:53.033]  Survivors might have recognized you.
[01:48:53.573 --> 01:48:57.295]  So bottom line, Trump doesn't do the stuff like other people to scare people.
[01:48:57.555 --> 01:49:01.196]  We should be on maximum terror alert right now, but watching for false flags.
[01:49:01.897 --> 01:49:07.479]  Yes, and any knuckleheads on our sides, please don't do anything stupid.
[01:49:08.155 --> 01:49:10.056]  If it's a false flag, that's one thing.
[01:49:10.116 --> 01:49:11.216]  We'll get to the bottom of it.
[01:49:11.677 --> 01:49:30.045]  I'm guessing, just like within our own FBI, regarding the Hillary emails and all of that, up right now in the Canadian Royal Mounted Police, that there is probably a lot of pressure to bury this thing if it looks like it was a false flag, and there will be honest investigators and detectives
[01:49:30.903 --> 01:49:36.467]  Uh, interrogating this, I think it's the Bissonnette who was, uh, that called himself in.
[01:49:36.607 --> 01:49:41.670]  Oh yeah, wait, it's gonna come out he's being handled by Trudeau, uh, you know, and the federal police.
[01:49:41.710 --> 01:49:44.491]  It's gonna come out that he's being handled by some foundation group.
[01:49:44.832 --> 01:49:46.272]  Bet money we'll hear about him tomorrow.
[01:49:46.653 --> 01:49:50.515]  It was known a year ago that he was in whatever radical group, but nothing was done.
[01:49:51.315 --> 01:49:58.540]  Or if he was not in a radical group, if he was secretly radicalized so that he could be used as a throwaway patsy,
[01:49:59.483 --> 01:50:14.054]  If he was not a mosque-goer, but he just came under the orbit, say, of Mohammed Qadir... Sure, well, that's the problem with a pure false flag like this, is the wind-up toys lose faith, they get cold feet, or things don't go as well, because, you know, these patsies are not the sharpest knives.
[01:50:14.754 --> 01:50:25.523]  Right, and the patsy might have even been told, we're just going to go into the backsliding moderate mosque, the apostate mosque, and we're just going to shoot some guns and scare them.
[01:50:26.163 --> 01:50:28.725]  He might not have even been prepared to see people killed.
[01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:34.291]  But, in any event, I would be looking for him to commit suicide in jail.
[01:50:34.411 --> 01:50:36.872]  I'd look for him to hang himself from the vent duct.
[01:50:37.432 --> 01:50:50.116]  Because if he's got a lot of knowledge about his handlers, or any knowledge about handlers above Mohammed Qadir, I would look for him to have a very short life in captivity.
[01:50:51.286 --> 01:50:53.950]  Yeah, he's got that delicate genius look where they think they're so smart.
[01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:55.793]  Looks like a classic idiot Patsy to me.
[01:50:56.274 --> 01:50:57.395]  Why do they all look the same?
[01:50:57.956 --> 01:50:59.098]  They got that dumbass look.
[01:50:59.138 --> 01:51:00.420]  We'll be right back with Matt Braggins.
[01:51:03.633 --> 01:51:05.555]  Boy, did the travel ban get him going or what?
[01:51:05.715 --> 01:51:08.198]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[01:51:08.398 --> 01:51:09.759]  But why are they really protesting?
[01:51:09.879 --> 01:51:24.794]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees, or in 2015 when he signed the Visa Waiver Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of his 2015 Christmas gift, Omnibus Spending Bill, which also created the list of countries that Donald Trump chose.
[01:51:25.034 --> 01:51:27.776]  So why no protest then over Obama but now over Trump?
[01:51:27.937 --> 01:51:29.318]  Coverage and transparency.
[01:51:29.518 --> 01:51:33.361]  See, Trump is transparent with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack mode against him.
[01:51:33.522 --> 01:51:36.624]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them.
[01:51:36.744 --> 01:51:40.688]  The CNNs of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[01:51:40.888 --> 01:51:45.592]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic, and Trump's travel ban will increase risk of Islamic terror.
[01:51:45.752 --> 01:51:54.259]  Yes, I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's fatal drones and bombs, which if we get to the bottom of that, would clear a lot of this up.
[01:51:54.399 --> 01:51:57.422]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[01:51:57.662 --> 01:51:57.942]  Why?
[01:51:58.162 --> 01:51:59.644]  Coverage and transparency.
[01:51:59.884 --> 01:52:02.146]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:52:03.308 --> 01:52:09.472]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:12.735]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:52:13.095 --> 01:52:18.279]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:52:18.699 --> 01:52:24.663]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:52:24.824 --> 01:52:27.946]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:52:28.106 --> 01:52:29.547]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:52:29.747 --> 01:52:33.891]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:52:34.071 --> 01:52:36.954]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:52:37.014 --> 01:52:38.595]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:52:38.695 --> 01:52:41.858]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:52:42.158 --> 01:52:44.481]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:45.722]  It's in powder form.
[01:52:45.822 --> 01:52:48.524]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:52:48.704 --> 01:52:49.705]  I take this.
[01:52:49.845 --> 01:52:51.107]  This is the product that I take.
[01:52:51.227 --> 01:52:53.189]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:52:54.010 --> 01:52:54.791]  We fight the Globals.

[01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:29.292]  That's some real rock and roll right there.
[01:54:29.312 --> 01:54:32.933]  That's the founder of rock and roll right there.
[01:54:33.073 --> 01:54:33.893]  You know,
[01:54:55.616 --> 01:55:05.122]  The incredible stuff going on is so bizarre and so amazing and everything Trump is doing is just delivering, delivering on everything he said he'd do.
[01:55:05.582 --> 01:55:15.269]  Really trying to restore the Republic and just to be coming out of all this premeditated political evil and scheming and Machiavellian crap and just his straight shooting.
[01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:18.991]  With McCain, others want to start a war with Russia.
[01:55:19.351 --> 01:55:24.474]  He goes, let's worry about Islamic terror and China and other stuff, not your obsession with World War III.
[01:55:25.295 --> 01:55:27.456]  It's so refreshing how real Trump is.
[01:55:28.357 --> 01:55:31.639]  And I'm a pessimist, folks, but I got to tell you, Trump's a treasure.
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.701]  But I'm very, very sad.
[01:55:34.741 --> 01:55:44.967]  The radicalization of the general public against him, maybe 30% of the public, that 25% that is frothing, is really ready to go to war.
[01:55:46.015 --> 01:55:47.517]  And then I look at the people they've got.
[01:55:47.797 --> 01:55:49.038]  It's a pathetic crew.
[01:55:49.699 --> 01:55:52.141]  Matt, you've gotten into this whole false flag and where this is going.
[01:55:52.161 --> 01:55:52.782]  I mean, I agree with you.
[01:55:52.822 --> 01:55:54.003]  It's got all the telltale signs.
[01:55:54.964 --> 01:55:55.945]  Doesn't make any sense.
[01:55:56.566 --> 01:55:57.807]  They had their stories all primed.
[01:55:57.847 --> 01:55:58.748]  Now it's gone away.
[01:55:59.669 --> 01:56:07.457]  You can see that what they're trying with the stock market, with all the demonstrations going on, this is clearly a move to, you know, to try to tug on heartstrings.
[01:56:08.138 --> 01:56:10.999]  I don't see anything they can do succeeding if they don't kill Trump.
[01:56:11.319 --> 01:56:12.640]  He's got good generals around him.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.280]  I know they know what they're up to.
[01:56:14.621 --> 01:56:15.661]  They're ready for a coup.
[01:56:16.221 --> 01:56:18.342]  They're ready for paramilitary action against him.
[01:56:18.382 --> 01:56:19.863]  I'll just obviously leave it at that.
[01:56:19.903 --> 01:56:20.703]  The enemy knows that.
[01:56:21.603 --> 01:56:22.644]  But Trump's got plans.
[01:56:23.764 --> 01:56:25.465]  Boy, they should have got him before he got in.
[01:56:26.425 --> 01:56:32.132]  At the same time, I don't want the President to go into a fortress mentality, but this next few months is critical.
[01:56:32.172 --> 01:56:34.134]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[01:56:34.174 --> 01:56:39.460]  Because as you said, they're putting out the narrative, the cause celeb, that Trump needs to be killed.
[01:56:40.421 --> 01:56:42.203]  That way it's plausibly deniable.
[01:56:42.223 --> 01:56:44.847]  But I just want people to know, everybody's been calling for his death.
[01:56:45.407 --> 01:56:46.848]  We're going to hold you responsible.
[01:56:46.868 --> 01:56:57.152]  I'm not a vengeful person, but it's not fair in the universe that all these chicken necks and cowards and scum run around calling for violence all day, and then not being on the receiving end of it if they start it.
[01:56:57.212 --> 01:57:02.354]  So, that's all I'm saying, is that people are going to get their necks broken here if they pull something.
[01:57:02.534 --> 01:57:12.218]  When you look at the so-called Women's March on Washington, and you see the timid little manginas that are basically going along,
[01:57:13.783 --> 01:57:16.004]  I just think brainwashing really works.
[01:57:16.084 --> 01:57:26.588]  You can brainwash people into hating their European ancestry, like that lady from Idaho at the Democratic retreat that was, you know, saying, I'm here to shut other white people down.
[01:57:27.308 --> 01:57:42.013]  You can brainwash men into hating their masculinity, and you can brainwash women into calling themselves a feminist but putting on a hijab in solidarity with people that would sell them in a slave market if they were in charge.
[01:57:42.904 --> 01:57:44.464]  The brainwashing really works.
[01:57:44.804 --> 01:58:03.228]  And when you have a vertical stovepipe information delivery system, even in a free society, you can get a really insulated mindset, where even though... Right, it's a feedback loop, it's a feedback loop, and they're all being fed this foundation garbage, so they're the susceptible ones.
[01:58:03.528 --> 01:58:07.088]  We should feel sorry for them, like they're the ones that were susceptible to the Spanish flu.
[01:58:07.308 --> 01:58:09.629]  But then what do we do then to counteract the brainwashing?
[01:58:12.089 --> 01:58:16.436]  Our advantage is that we see their propaganda.
[01:58:16.476 --> 01:58:18.039]  We read their organs.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:19.722]  We can't help it.
[01:58:19.762 --> 01:58:20.904]  It's the mainstream media.
[01:58:21.565 --> 01:58:31.328]  So, the more that we can get out the new media, videos like Paul Joseph Watson's makes are absolutely phenomenal.
[01:58:31.348 --> 01:58:32.368]  So it is the info war.
[01:58:32.388 --> 01:58:33.189]  The hope is the info war.
[01:58:33.209 --> 01:58:35.309]  I want to come back and do five more minutes with you.
[01:58:35.369 --> 01:58:36.930]  Milo, people like that.
[01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:43.832]  When I talk to millennials, they have no idea what's on CNN, but they know who Milo is and they know who Paul Joseph Watson are.
[01:58:44.012 --> 01:58:44.792]  Oh, they're rock stars.
[01:58:45.392 --> 01:58:45.873]  We'll be back.
[01:58:45.893 --> 01:58:48.253]  Stay with us.
[01:58:48.273 --> 01:58:50.314]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:53.354 --> 01:58:55.295]  Boy, did the travel ban get him going or what?
[01:58:55.436 --> 01:58:57.917]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[01:58:58.117 --> 01:58:59.498]  But why are they really protesting?
[01:58:59.598 --> 01:59:14.548]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees, or in 2015 when he signed the Visa Waiver Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of his 2015 Christmas gift, Omnibus Spending Bill, which also created the list of countries that Donald Trump chose.
[01:59:14.768 --> 01:59:17.510]  So why no protest then over Obama, but now over Trump?
[01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:19.071]  Coverage and transparency.
[01:59:19.251 --> 01:59:23.094]  See, Trump is transparent with the moves he is making, and the media is always in attack mode against him.
[01:59:23.234 --> 01:59:26.336]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them.
[01:59:26.456 --> 01:59:30.439]  The CNN's of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[01:59:30.619 --> 01:59:35.322]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic and Trump's travel ban will increase risk of Islamic terror.
[01:59:35.482 --> 01:59:41.206]  Yes I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's fatal drones and bombs.
[01:59:41.406 --> 01:59:43.968]  Which if we get to the bottom of that would clear a lot of this up.
[01:59:44.128 --> 01:59:47.150]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:47.670]  Why?
[01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:49.371]  Coverage and transparency.
[01:59:49.611 --> 01:59:51.873]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com
[01:59:54.304 --> 02:00:00.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:08.218 --> 02:00:17.627]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:20.389 --> 02:00:22.190]  I was always brought up you didn't brag.
[02:00:23.511 --> 02:00:25.891]  But in Information War, people need to know we're winning.
[02:00:26.632 --> 02:00:31.834]  They need to know that we're hitting 41 million people on average.
[02:00:32.194 --> 02:00:32.954]  That's our new low.
[02:00:33.554 --> 02:00:35.895]  We hit about 60 million the week of the inauguration.
[02:00:36.095 --> 02:00:37.976]  It looks like it's going to be 50 plus million this week.
[02:00:39.116 --> 02:00:40.557]  Our graph is just going straight up.
[02:00:40.597 --> 02:00:42.397]  That's why the enemy is attacking us daily.
[02:00:43.318 --> 02:00:46.459]  That's why they're doing a lot of other things behind the scenes that I really am not in the liberty to get into.
[02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:51.248]  It doesn't scare me to live in a James Bond movie, I'll put it to you that way.
[02:00:52.461 --> 02:00:54.422]  And there's a lot of friends of freedom as well.
[02:00:54.462 --> 02:00:55.703]  There's not just evil in this world.
[02:00:56.243 --> 02:00:58.185]  And I will tell the enemies of freedom something.
[02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:01.266]  Metaphysically, you've released your titans.
[02:01:01.406 --> 02:01:03.788]  Our doors are opening and our titans are coming out as well.
[02:01:04.148 --> 02:01:07.550]  And a lot of people that have been waiting now knows the time to move.
[02:01:07.630 --> 02:01:08.551]  So this isn't a threat.
[02:01:09.031 --> 02:01:13.134]  It's a warning to people that want to stage false flags or kill Trump or come after us.
[02:01:14.074 --> 02:01:16.315]  I'm not a wishful thinker.
[02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:17.977]  I'm a pessimist.
[02:01:18.017 --> 02:01:18.457]  But let me tell you.
[02:01:18.897 --> 02:01:21.959]  We're pretty much assured of victory if you go into a physical conflict.
[02:01:22.199 --> 02:01:23.200]  We've got four minutes left.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:27.383]  Matt Brackenman of EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com, your great political brain.
[02:01:28.083 --> 02:01:33.707]  The salivating, the calls for killing Trump, putting it out into the pheromone ether, kill him, kill him, kill him, blow up the White House.
[02:01:34.267 --> 02:01:36.348]  It's getting into a frenzy and it's only intensifying.
[02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:41.251]  These just look like people that want to get knocked down and hurt real bad.
[02:01:42.232 --> 02:01:46.295]  Yeah, sometimes these communist revolutions lose big time.
[02:01:47.115 --> 02:01:48.116]  It happened in Finland.
[02:01:49.015 --> 02:01:50.176]  It's happened in other places.
[02:01:50.256 --> 02:01:51.157]  Indonesia.
[02:01:52.038 --> 02:02:03.426]  And you need to, the people that think that the government is the solution and that the federal law enforcement agents are their hammer and their fist, well that's over now that Trump is in.
[02:02:03.446 --> 02:02:16.336]  And people that think that dressing up like a vagina, you know, is a way to secure political victory, they need to consider how many people go out in the woods, you know, with high-powered rifles
[02:02:17.117 --> 02:02:20.239]  And their hobby is shooting 200 pound mammals and skinning them.
[02:02:21.781 --> 02:02:27.745]  They mistake, what's happening is the left mistakes our forbearance and our tolerance.
[02:02:28.366 --> 02:02:30.227]  A very deep abiding forbearance.
[02:02:30.247 --> 02:02:35.791]  They take our kindness for weakness and I never know why weak people take your kindness for weakness.
[02:02:35.811 --> 02:02:36.672]  They just, they don't get it.
[02:02:37.574 --> 02:02:38.234]  They don't get it.
[02:02:38.754 --> 02:02:53.778]  And they don't get that, you know, going out in freezing cold weather and, you know, sitting up in a tree for half the night, waiting for a 200-pound mammal to walk along so you can shoot it, turn it into meat and stick it in the freezer.
[02:02:54.838 --> 02:02:58.799]  These are not the kind of people you want to absolutely have lose it.
[02:02:59.359 --> 02:03:05.821]  And if Trump was assassinated, millions of people, like I just described, would absolutely lose it.
[02:03:06.428 --> 02:03:11.692]  And, you know, there's the old adage, you know, think globally, act locally.
[02:03:11.712 --> 02:03:17.316]  You know, within your own... Oh, they start a civil war, you know people are going to be acting locally really bad.
[02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:18.577]  Right.
[02:03:18.697 --> 02:03:26.463]  And we know from the last 10 or 15 years that there's nobody on earth that can stop lone actors.
[02:03:27.084 --> 02:03:32.888]  There used to be an army... By the way, within 48 hours all the police are going to evacuate and not support these globalists.
[02:03:32.908 --> 02:03:33.489]  They should know that.
[02:03:34.392 --> 02:03:39.977]  Especially if the people that are pulling triggers don't even tell their families or anybody.
[02:03:40.477 --> 02:03:41.258]  They just go out.
[02:03:41.638 --> 02:03:45.841]  I have this kind of scenario in my first novel, Enemies Foreign and Domestic.
[02:03:46.362 --> 02:03:53.747]  If you've just got a target list that if this ever happened, this is what I would do, and the next thing you know,
[02:03:55.208 --> 02:03:56.609]  People are starting to get shot.
[02:03:56.769 --> 02:03:58.170]  I hope that this doesn't happen.
[02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:05.135]  I mean, it's unfortunate, but if they want to have a George Soros takeover and lock us up and kill us and stuff, if they ask for it, I mean, they just don't know.
[02:04:05.415 --> 02:04:06.576]  People have been ready for 20 years.
[02:04:07.397 --> 02:04:08.998]  I mean, we're hoping for peace.
[02:04:09.038 --> 02:04:09.999]  We elected Trump.
[02:04:10.039 --> 02:04:10.959]  We want to fix things.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:13.341]  But I mean, you know, and I'm not planning anything myself.
[02:04:13.401 --> 02:04:14.242]  I just know what's going on.
[02:04:14.622 --> 02:04:15.963]  I'm really sorry for him, quite frankly.
[02:04:16.755 --> 02:04:19.917]  They can control, they can shut down traffic in cities.
[02:04:19.977 --> 02:04:22.018]  They can blockade a highway.
[02:04:22.878 --> 02:04:24.739]  They can cause mayhem at airports.
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.561]  Maybe they can crash the stock market.
[02:04:28.301 --> 02:04:33.504]  But in the end, it's the red county states where the food comes from.
[02:04:33.524 --> 02:04:34.404]  It's where the energy is located.
[02:04:34.444 --> 02:04:36.385]  We've already occupied and conquered the country.
[02:04:36.805 --> 02:04:37.606]  We've already occupied.
[02:04:38.611 --> 02:04:43.252]  I often say, you know, to liberals, how much food do they grow inside the beltway?
[02:04:43.793 --> 02:04:48.814]  Because if that food conveyor is ever shut off, it'll be hard times for everybody.
[02:04:48.834 --> 02:04:51.835]  Matt, I want to get you back this week to talk about the worst case scenarios.
[02:04:51.855 --> 02:04:58.157]  Maybe Friday for two hours, if they do pull a coup and try to come arrest the patriots as they had planned under Obama's mentor.
[02:04:58.737 --> 02:04:59.657]  What do people do?
[02:05:00.017 --> 02:05:01.498]  We've got to talk about emergency plans.
[02:05:01.538 --> 02:05:01.958]  Thank you, sir.
[02:05:07.887 --> 02:05:09.388]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:05:09.849 --> 02:05:12.251]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:19.977]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:05:20.357 --> 02:05:23.960]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:25.461]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:05:25.882 --> 02:05:27.043]  It's called the Blocky Pocket.

[02:05:49.462 --> 02:05:51.163]  With the Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[02:05:51.624 --> 02:05:54.325]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.

[02:07:03.476 --> 02:07:05.457]  New video on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:05.697 --> 02:07:11.080]  Leftist mob chases down Trump supporters, beat and taunt them inside of Portland International Airport.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:15.943]  Again, the anti-Trump people are proven to be the most wicked and violent citizens in our country.
[02:07:16.263 --> 02:07:17.844]  I went to the Women's March in D.C.
[02:07:17.924 --> 02:07:28.770]  wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I was assaulted, spit on, yelled at, cursed at, had my family insulted, dry humped in the street, and overall viewed as a foul person whose opinion should be silent.
[02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:32.932]  And when I asked for their opinions or why they were protesting, I got nothing productive.
[02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:41.817]  I went to the March for Life in Austin wearing my Make America Great Again gear, and I experienced zero negativity for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male.
[02:07:41.937 --> 02:07:49.381]  When I put the marchers and their signs on camera, they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language.
[02:07:49.542 --> 02:07:56.446]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones, I challenge you to take to the streets with Make America Great Again gear on.
[02:07:56.646 --> 02:07:59.487]  You will experience more hate than you ever have in your life.
[02:07:59.687 --> 02:08:02.009]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[02:08:04.997 --> 02:08:07.559]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[02:08:07.939 --> 02:08:11.781]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[02:08:12.562 --> 02:08:15.624]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[02:08:17.014 --> 02:08:22.278]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[02:08:22.598 --> 02:08:26.361]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[02:08:26.841 --> 02:08:28.463]  We have to be good.
[02:08:29.123 --> 02:08:29.944]  We have to be pure.
[02:08:29.984 --> 02:08:30.824]  We have to be strong.
[02:08:31.145 --> 02:08:32.586]  We have to build prosperity.
[02:08:32.966 --> 02:08:35.468]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[02:08:36.946 --> 02:08:42.430]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[02:08:43.271 --> 02:08:50.896]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[02:08:51.357 --> 02:08:57.902]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[02:09:16.291 --> 02:09:20.735]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:09:21.576 --> 02:09:22.477]  Move bitch!
[02:09:22.777 --> 02:09:23.678]  Get out the way!
[02:09:25.658 --> 02:09:31.643]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[02:09:31.823 --> 02:09:36.206]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:09:36.367 --> 02:09:39.829]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:09:39.909 --> 02:09:41.150]  I will not let you down.
[02:09:41.210 --> 02:09:46.014]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:09:46.034 --> 02:09:47.976]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:09:48.056 --> 02:09:52.159]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:10:02.701]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:10:02.721 --> 02:10:07.382]  We're now well into the third hour, one of the final days of this historic month.
[02:10:08.362 --> 02:10:15.724]  President Trump said that January 20th, 2017 would be known as the day that America was finally reborn.
[02:10:17.654 --> 02:10:20.056]  And Trump is basically over-delivering.
[02:10:20.536 --> 02:10:21.377]  He is doing so much.
[02:10:21.437 --> 02:10:25.680]  Executive orders for every regulation that they pass, too, have to be rescinded.
[02:10:27.582 --> 02:10:34.547]  Defending our borders, enforcing the law Obama passed with failed countries like Somalia didn't even have an airport.
[02:10:34.587 --> 02:10:36.989]  Of course you can have people confined and unvetted from Somalia.
[02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:42.513]  I mean, it's just crazy to watch the media in all of this deception.
[02:10:44.645 --> 02:10:47.788]  I've been wanting to get her on for a while because I've read articles about her book.
[02:10:47.868 --> 02:10:50.330]  I'm so busy I got a stack of books I want to read, but I've got the book.
[02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:53.533]  A Wall Street Bailout for Main Street.
[02:10:55.234 --> 02:11:00.299]  And Dr. Iris Max, a really interesting lady, you know, she'd been a Democrat as soon as she saw Obama get elected.
[02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:01.800]  I'm paraphrasing from an article I read.
[02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:06.244]  She went to Independent because she could just see by who he was appointing what he was going to do.
[02:11:06.264 --> 02:11:07.345]  I want to get her take on
[02:11:08.433 --> 02:11:10.874]  Trump and what she thinks he's going to do.
[02:11:10.894 --> 02:11:18.195]  I'm going to go over her whole bio, but she's got a PhD, EMBA, earned a doctorate in applied mathematics from Harvard University.
[02:11:18.595 --> 02:11:27.917]  Dr. Mack worked at various energy and financial institutions, acted as a deputy member of MIT, and worked at NASA and AT&T Bell Labs, where she obtained a patent for research on optical fibers.
[02:11:28.357 --> 02:11:37.639]  Dr. Mack currently lectures in energy trading and risk management for the Fitch Learning Certificate and Qualitative Financial Finance Program on Wall Street and the Tulane University.
[02:11:38.419 --> 02:11:39.660]  I'm not going to go over all her stuff.
[02:11:40.241 --> 02:11:48.889]  A Wall Street bailout for Main Street is her third financially focused and published book, including her energy trading book and financial literacy book for teens and adults.
[02:11:48.949 --> 02:11:52.393]  She becomes highly recommended by some really smart folks, who I respect.
[02:11:53.233 --> 02:12:00.540]  In addition, Dr. Mack founded the Global Energy Post and MathQED, a homework help site for K-12 college students.
[02:12:01.481 --> 02:12:03.283]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:12:03.383 --> 02:12:08.126]  Such accolades illustrate Dr. Mack's ability to clearly inform the masses.
[02:12:08.146 --> 02:12:13.150]  You can learn about Dr. Iris Mack by visiting her author's page at Amazon.com.
[02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:16.673]  MainStreetBailout.com is the main site.
[02:12:17.793 --> 02:12:21.777]  But she joins us now to just look at the world we're in.
[02:12:21.938 --> 02:12:30.707]  I mean, it's like we're living in a comic book with classic villains and classic tyrants but different sides see villains and tyrants in different shapes.
[02:12:31.428 --> 02:12:32.669]  All I see Trump doing is
[02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:41.613]  Finally doing what a statesman or politician says they do and trying to deliver on free market capitalism and what made this country great.
[02:12:42.153 --> 02:12:45.374]  I've been such a pessimist so long that my head's spinning.
[02:12:45.394 --> 02:12:48.415]  And then I'm somebody who used to support the Democrats on many issues.
[02:12:48.455 --> 02:12:49.115]  I was independent.
[02:12:49.135 --> 02:12:50.335]  I was never a Democrat.
[02:12:50.355 --> 02:12:51.496]  I've been more, quote, conservative.
[02:12:51.516 --> 02:12:52.676]  I've been pro-gun and pro-life.
[02:12:52.696 --> 02:12:55.057]  But I hate the Republican Party establishment.
[02:12:55.077 --> 02:12:55.577]  They're terrible.
[02:12:55.777 --> 02:12:56.597]  Look what they've done to Trump.
[02:12:56.637 --> 02:12:58.598]  But the Democrats now, they have just
[02:12:59.537 --> 02:13:02.278]  Gone insane, and I don't even know what to say at this point.
[02:13:02.599 --> 02:13:04.019]  I used to laugh at him.
[02:13:04.059 --> 02:13:05.000]  I cry for him now.
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:05.840]  I mean, I'm scared.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.281]  I got three kids.
[02:13:07.841 --> 02:13:10.502]  I'm kind of ranting here, Dr. Mack, but where should we start?
[02:13:11.583 --> 02:13:13.564]  Well, first of all, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:13:13.904 --> 02:13:14.144]  Thank you.
[02:13:14.164 --> 02:13:17.646]  I've been listening to you for years, and it's nice to finally talk to you in person.
[02:13:17.706 --> 02:13:21.608]  Well, not in person, but... Well, we're talking in person right now over the phone, so thank you for joining us.
[02:13:22.148 --> 02:13:22.669]  You're welcome.
[02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:24.890]  So where do we start?
[02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:25.610]  Wherever you'd like.
[02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:27.231]  I mean, you're the expert on so much.
[02:13:28.356 --> 02:13:34.758]  Well, as I was telling Nico, I mean, there's been so much going on in only the first week that it's actually pretty amazing to me.
[02:13:34.798 --> 02:13:43.101]  I've been following politics and financial markets for a while, and I've never seen a president move this fast and so decisively.
[02:13:43.161 --> 02:13:46.742]  And I think even more importantly, he's doing what he said he was going to do.
[02:13:47.922 --> 02:13:56.885]  I actually, to dismay of many of my friends, would listen to most of Trump's rally speeches, and he's literally doing what he said he was going to do, which is
[02:13:57.688 --> 02:13:59.049]  I think shocking to a lot of people.
[02:13:59.249 --> 02:14:00.250]  Well, the elite knew that.
[02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:01.410]  That's why they were so scared.
[02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:06.093]  Trump is, I don't want to say OCD, but the thing is, he's so straight shooting.
[02:14:06.553 --> 02:14:08.935]  That's why in negotiations they say he's rude and mean.
[02:14:09.275 --> 02:14:10.175]  He just straight shoots.
[02:14:10.255 --> 02:14:14.478]  So, I'd like to say Texas has a monopoly on that, but it looks like New York just brought it back big time.
[02:14:14.498 --> 02:14:21.222]  Well, I lived in both New York and Texas, and I think they both were straight shooters, but in slightly different styles.
[02:14:22.435 --> 02:14:27.756]  Wow, well just break down your book and Trump and just your whole worldview and where you think things are going.
[02:14:28.777 --> 02:14:32.017]  Okay, well as far as Trump goes, I've been following Trump for years.
[02:14:32.137 --> 02:14:39.399]  You know, even before I knew about him as a reality TV show star or whatever, because I used to read his books.
[02:14:39.979 --> 02:14:46.381]  I mean, I read The Art of the Deal and when I did my MBA, we had a few case studies that, you know, his name came up.
[02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:51.122]  So, I thought when he first said he was going to run, that was the best thing that we could have.
[02:14:52.165 --> 02:14:55.666]  When I mentioned it to some of my friends, I mean, I lost a few of them along the way.
[02:14:55.726 --> 02:14:56.366]  Sure, me too.
[02:14:57.426 --> 02:15:03.387]  And even some of my family members, now they're coming around because they see, you know, he's a man of action.
[02:15:04.447 --> 02:15:15.890]  And so, I mean, if we can get through some of the hysteria that we've seen over the past week or so, hopefully if things can settle down, people can appreciate some of the things he's trying to do.
[02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:18.090]  I know he's not, as you say, you know,
[02:15:19.412 --> 02:15:23.315]  He's a little bit maybe rough around the edges sometimes, but I'm kind of like that too.
[02:15:23.455 --> 02:15:26.757]  I'm from New Orleans and we're pretty straight shooters down here as well.
[02:15:28.378 --> 02:15:34.242]  So I have high hopes for what he's going to do, but I can see that it's not going to be easy.
[02:15:34.602 --> 02:15:40.906]  I have friends even from Europe and Asia, partly because of what they're hearing in the mainstream media, as you call it, fake news.
[02:15:41.487 --> 02:15:43.208]  They're calling me and asking me, what's going on?
[02:15:43.248 --> 02:15:43.848]  Are you scared?
[02:15:43.868 --> 02:15:45.169]  Or what are you guys doing over there?
[02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.970]  And I said, come on.
[02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:49.212]  And they were referring to the Muslim ban and I pointed out to them, look,
[02:15:49.738 --> 02:15:51.502]  This is done by Obama administration.
[02:15:52.003 --> 02:15:54.809]  Trump didn't even list the names of the companies in his executive order.
[02:15:55.169 --> 02:15:58.176]  I mean, it's amazing to me you have to tell it to people because it's right there on the internet.
[02:15:59.113 --> 02:16:00.073]  That's what's crazy.
[02:16:00.113 --> 02:16:04.435]  He literally just copied Obama's law, knowing he'd be attacked.
[02:16:04.895 --> 02:16:05.716]  It's crazy.
[02:16:05.756 --> 02:16:09.477]  And then, I'm sure you've seen, they're everywhere saying kill him in the newspapers.
[02:16:09.497 --> 02:16:17.660]  Listen, I never said kill Hillary or Obama, because I don't turn them into martyrs, but if I talk like that, Dr. Mack, I'd be arrested very quickly, and I should be.
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.481]  Madonna says blow up the White House.
[02:16:19.981 --> 02:16:21.241]  She's got a powerful voice.
[02:16:21.802 --> 02:16:22.342]  Yeah, you would be.
[02:16:22.362 --> 02:16:27.684]  I have a sister who's a former FBI agent, and you would be in jail, you know, pretty quickly.
[02:16:28.806 --> 02:16:36.140]  So yeah, in terms of Trump, I think he's capable of getting a lot done if he doesn't have too many roadblocks put in the way.
[02:16:36.841 --> 02:16:37.382]  So we'll see.
[02:16:37.423 --> 02:16:39.547]  It's only been one week, but I'm impressed with the first week.
[02:16:40.399 --> 02:16:46.143]  Sure, the reason I say that is I've read a synopsis of your book, and you know how it is, you get busy and older and kids.
[02:16:47.164 --> 02:16:48.385]  I'm going to read it some weekend.
[02:16:48.885 --> 02:16:54.970]  But I mean, I love your idea about we need the bailout for Main Street, like we've done for these big foreign megabanks.
[02:16:55.010 --> 02:16:58.412]  If we do that, it will build an economy that will help empower the world.
[02:16:58.452 --> 02:17:04.857]  So I've read the synopsis of your book, but I mean, let's get into your plan and then how you tie it into Trump's plan.
[02:17:05.871 --> 02:17:09.213]  Okay, well my plan has basically been my plan way before I knew Trump.
[02:17:09.253 --> 02:17:10.054]  I mean, I grew up... Sure, sure.
[02:17:10.094 --> 02:17:12.015]  I mean, that's why I think it's interesting because I've read the synopsis.
[02:17:12.335 --> 02:17:14.377]  It sounds like what Trump's saying, but it's just common sense.
[02:17:14.637 --> 02:17:21.502]  People think Trump's... Yeah, and that's why I think I was always attracted to what he had to say, because I grew up in a housing project in New Orleans, so we had to have common sense.
[02:17:21.902 --> 02:17:24.163]  My parents didn't play with, you know, anything else.
[02:17:24.704 --> 02:17:27.786]  So I've always been the kind of person, look, yeah, you get mad for a minute.
[02:17:28.471 --> 02:17:29.492]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.109 --> 02:17:46.569]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:07.185 --> 02:18:08.066]  We're good to go.
[02:18:25.818 --> 02:18:27.019]  Get the blank out of here, you know?
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.023]  Yeah, because what Trump is sort of like, I mean I'm not to the same level, but
[02:18:42.856 --> 02:18:43.877]  He was an insider.
[02:18:43.897 --> 02:18:45.517]  Now he's showing you what's going on.
[02:18:46.158 --> 02:18:49.599]  And as one of my brothers said, he used to work for a major oil company.
[02:18:49.979 --> 02:18:52.200]  He has a lot more money in his stock portfolio than I do.
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:55.642]  And when he came to visit me, he said, look, my broker never told me this.
[02:18:56.302 --> 02:19:04.786]  And before I got into explaining it to them, what I do in a book, I said, go to my bookshelves and pull off the books that say options or derivatives and open it up.
[02:19:05.206 --> 02:19:07.187]  And he'd open it up and he goes, this is like Greek.
[02:19:07.347 --> 02:19:08.728]  I said, well, that's all I'm doing.
[02:19:09.168 --> 02:19:11.609]  I'm translating the Greek to the people on the street.
[02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:25.340]  Because all you do when you do certain derivative deals, even though it has a lot of fancy math, a lot of fancy financial market terminology, but I break it down to somebody basically on a street corner.
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.203]  I say, look, when we do a cover call option trade where you have a stock,
[02:19:29.992 --> 02:19:35.440]  And in Wall Street terminology, what you do is, you own the stock, you short a call option.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:37.303]  Hold on, I want to cut this off, Dr. Iris.
[02:19:37.583 --> 02:19:38.465]  Max, stay right there.
[02:19:38.825 --> 02:19:39.967]  MainStreetBailout.com.
[02:19:40.007 --> 02:19:42.150]  I want to come back and start over, so we have some time.
[02:19:44.798 --> 02:19:49.182]  Like learning what the establishment, what the elites do to get rich themselves that I want the public to know about.
[02:19:49.202 --> 02:19:54.527]  And then I want to ask you, as a mathematician, looking at Trump's economic plans, do you think they're viable?
[02:19:54.808 --> 02:19:58.972]  I mean, obviously growth's the answer, but how big do the cuts need to be to get out of this hole?
[02:19:59.552 --> 02:20:01.054]  Or do we just bubble our way out of it?
[02:20:01.094 --> 02:20:02.095]  We'll talk to her straight ahead.
[02:20:07.398 --> 02:20:12.999]  Roger Stone cutting the bureaucracy 75% that they admit is not to keep the earth clean.
[02:20:13.039 --> 02:20:15.860]  It's meant to hurt our industry and shut us down.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.140]  He's just delivering on every front.
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:19.140]  He said it.
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:20.640]  He's not, he got his hair cut.
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:21.541]  He's not wearing makeup.
[02:20:21.581 --> 02:20:22.661]  Looks even better today.
[02:20:23.061 --> 02:20:25.841]  I mean, it just gets better and better and better.
[02:20:25.901 --> 02:20:27.542]  He's a tough negotiator.
[02:20:28.022 --> 02:20:33.963]  We need some tough negotiations with Vladimir Putin and the Russians so that we might have
[02:20:34.503 --> 02:20:34.863]  Peace.
[02:20:35.444 --> 02:20:36.905]  Peace is the objective.
[02:20:36.965 --> 02:20:39.167]  This isn't about how you get along with Putin.
[02:20:39.567 --> 02:20:41.569]  It's about peace.
[02:20:41.869 --> 02:20:54.500]  And what you're seeing, both in the demonstrations, Alex, and in the constant campaign to undermine Trump, is that the deep state just cannot accept his election.
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:55.561]  You talk about the atomic fever.
[02:20:56.041 --> 02:20:57.222]  I saw the arrogance of these people.
[02:20:57.483 --> 02:20:58.704]  Why are they so mentally ill?
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:02.882]  Well, because they've been running things for 30 years.
[02:21:03.362 --> 02:21:05.603]  Everything has been done the neocon way.
[02:21:06.164 --> 02:21:13.448]  The Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama combine has run the country into the ditch, but they are used to having their way.
[02:21:13.908 --> 02:21:21.233]  Now, along comes this upstart, this reformer, Donald Trump, with his own ideas, and you can't bully him.
[02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:23.274]  And you can't buy him.
[02:21:23.334 --> 02:21:26.076]  See, the Saudis are very adept at buying people.
[02:21:26.776 --> 02:21:29.098]  They buy their way through Washington.
[02:21:29.158 --> 02:21:32.420]  All the special interests buy their way through Washington.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:35.002]  And Trump just doesn't play that game.
[02:21:35.462 --> 02:21:37.103]  So, there is a panic.
[02:21:37.423 --> 02:21:41.206]  What do you make of coming in and delivering 75% cut in regulations?
[02:21:41.806 --> 02:21:46.069]  Well, meanwhile, Trump is working the phones with some of these big companies like LBJ.
[02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:53.814]  He is wheedling, and coddling, and coaxing, and talking, negotiating, and pushing, and probably threatening people.
[02:21:55.155 --> 02:21:57.416]  Well, he threatened him on air.
[02:21:57.436 --> 02:21:59.317]  He said, you're not bringing your crap back in here if you leave.
[02:21:59.337 --> 02:22:00.718]  Total delivery!
[02:22:15.305 --> 02:22:19.649]  Hillary Clinton promised the neocons an expansion of the proxy war.
[02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:22.312]  They were prepared to do a no-fly zone.
[02:22:22.772 --> 02:22:25.915]  This is an open invitation for World War III.
[02:22:25.995 --> 02:22:27.417]  And by the way, I want to say something to Ron Paul.
[02:22:27.517 --> 02:22:28.118]  I love Ron Paul.
[02:22:28.138 --> 02:22:28.758]  He's on Wednesday.
[02:22:28.778 --> 02:22:29.799]  He has an article out.
[02:22:29.819 --> 02:22:30.860]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:22:32.179 --> 02:22:38.922]  Trump's foreign policy and unwise inconsistency, you know, and he's basically saying we can't be for war to take out ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[02:22:39.182 --> 02:22:42.004]  That's the globalist proxy war meant to start war with Russia.
[02:22:42.264 --> 02:22:45.565]  We have to go clean it up or it'll start a war with Russia, Congressman.
[02:22:45.786 --> 02:22:52.629]  And I understand Paul, again, just sticks to it from an absolute blind point of view in that he does what he says he'll do.
[02:22:52.989 --> 02:22:54.049]  No war at any time.
[02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:58.752]  Well, this isn't war if it's cleaning up the neocons and the Democrats trying to start World War III.
[02:23:03.223 --> 02:23:04.665]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:23:04.825 --> 02:23:07.227]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.

[02:23:52.461 --> 02:23:53.561]  That means it's clean.
[02:23:53.901 --> 02:23:54.802]  That means it's pure.

[02:23:57.903 --> 02:24:00.643]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:24:00.703 --> 02:24:02.344]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:24:15.509 --> 02:24:28.415]  Dr. Iris Max Book, a Wall Street bailout for Main Street, gets into the tricks the bigwigs use to dominate the markets that the general public, including people like her brother who's successful in business, didn't know about.
[02:24:28.435 --> 02:24:36.378]  So we're talking about some of these tricks, and then we're going to also, in the next segment, get a little bit into her view on the economy and what she thinks should be done.
[02:24:37.339 --> 02:24:42.001]  But first off, what do you make of Trump saying for every new regulation you've got to repeal two?
[02:24:43.729 --> 02:24:59.274]  Well I think that's a good idea because I also have a small business and I've had it for over 10 years and you can see over the period of that time how paperwork for things that you think just shouldn't even be necessary are just, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:00.455 --> 02:25:04.696]  And you can't compete like that if you're small compared to say IBM or Google or whatever.
[02:25:04.736 --> 02:25:10.678]  So even I've been in academia, I've always as a kid wanted to be an entrepreneur so I understand exactly what he's saying.
[02:25:11.118 --> 02:25:11.919]  I think that's the problem.
[02:25:11.939 --> 02:25:12.519]  A lot of people
[02:25:13.368 --> 02:25:22.554]  As I jokingly tell my friends sometimes, you know, they have pretty good jobs, and I say, look, I think there should be a law that says everybody should be an entrepreneur for at least six months.
[02:25:24.256 --> 02:25:25.657]  And then people will appreciate stuff.
[02:25:26.657 --> 02:25:30.180]  Because they go to work, they collect a check, they don't know where the money comes from, and they don't care.
[02:25:31.229 --> 02:25:31.970]  I agree with Trump.
[02:25:32.530 --> 02:25:33.130]  Exactly.
[02:25:33.210 --> 02:25:43.357]  I mean, some of the zoners and government people here in Austin, I know Texas supposedly is a free state, it's not in many areas, they act like if you've got an operation or a business, you're hiring people, you're somehow a criminal.
[02:25:45.319 --> 02:25:46.459]  I mean, they are on your butt.
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:50.982]  Now, Doc, let's start getting into the key though, your book, What It Breaks Down.
[02:25:51.002 --> 02:25:53.064]  Let's talk about some of these tricks that the establishment knows.
[02:25:53.084 --> 02:25:54.204]  Okay, let me give you a simple analogy.
[02:25:54.665 --> 02:25:58.948]  If you own a house or an apartment and you're not living in it, what do you normally do with it?
[02:26:00.393 --> 02:26:08.499]  Yeah, so what I tell people is if you own stock, most times people buy stock, they put it in their portfolio, and they hope and pray to God it's going to go up.
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:11.742]  But while you're praying, you could rent it back to the exchange.
[02:26:11.822 --> 02:26:12.402]  That's what it is.
[02:26:12.743 --> 02:26:13.363]  That's all I'm doing.
[02:26:13.903 --> 02:26:23.671]  But you have to learn a technical terminology for it, but basically when you own stock, you can buy a call, sell a call option on the stock.
[02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:29.135]  That's basically a legal contract that allows you to turn around and rent that stock back to the exchange.
[02:26:29.575 --> 02:26:30.136]  And they pay you.
[02:26:30.914 --> 02:26:31.335]  Right away.
[02:26:31.575 --> 02:26:37.421]  I mean, I show my brothers and friends when they come to my house, because I have a trading platform set up at home, and they can see the credit.
[02:26:37.481 --> 02:26:38.422]  It goes right into your account.
[02:26:38.602 --> 02:26:39.263]  You collect money.
[02:26:39.684 --> 02:26:40.845]  That's how rich people get richer.
[02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:47.212]  And sometimes, I mean, how many times do they leverage the derivatives?
[02:26:48.874 --> 02:26:51.116]  Well, this is a derivative.
[02:26:51.156 --> 02:26:52.758]  So I do explain in the book, look.
[02:26:54.102 --> 02:26:58.684]  We have a 1.5, 1.6, how much derivative, quadrillion derivative market.
[02:26:58.984 --> 02:27:02.946]  And I explained it in detail at Show to Peru, how it's comparing to the global GDP.
[02:27:03.386 --> 02:27:04.687]  It's gonna blow up eventually.
[02:27:04.887 --> 02:27:05.627]  No, no, I get it.
[02:27:05.667 --> 02:27:09.629]  The elite have created it to consolidate power and to shave money off the top.
[02:27:10.069 --> 02:27:11.110]  Why shouldn't we do it?
[02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:12.410]  I mean, I totally get what you're saying.
[02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:12.950]  I agree with you.
[02:27:12.970 --> 02:27:13.491]  Yeah, it's still legal.
[02:27:13.511 --> 02:27:13.871]  That's what I said.
[02:27:13.891 --> 02:27:14.271]  It's legal.
[02:27:14.331 --> 02:27:16.772]  So, while the market is still, you know, alive.
[02:27:16.792 --> 02:27:18.453]  Sure, I'm saying how many times can you keep...
[02:27:19.378 --> 02:27:20.901]  Leveraging derivatives you've got.
[02:27:20.981 --> 02:27:22.603]  Oh, you can do it forever!
[02:27:22.683 --> 02:27:27.812]  Because basically, if I own the stock, and I sell a call option on it,
[02:27:28.923 --> 02:27:37.808]  I can choose the parameters of the contract, and that's what I explain to people in the book with a lot of illustrations, because you have a lot of things that influence a derivatives contract, not like a stock.
[02:27:38.188 --> 02:27:43.971]  You have the interest rate, you have the volatility, you have the price of the stock, you have a few other things.
[02:27:44.011 --> 02:27:47.033]  So I show you how to predict, you have the date of expiration.
[02:27:47.573 --> 02:27:55.417]  So you can rent your stock weekly, monthly, quarterly, whatever, and... And again, the elites are doing this themselves, but don't want us to know about it.
[02:27:55.777 --> 02:27:56.157]  Yeah!
[02:27:56.337 --> 02:28:10.061]  What's big is that, as I told my brother, when he was kind of mad, because he has a lot more stock and money than I do, and he saw my books all over my, you know, apartment, and I say, well, just pull off the books that say Options and Derivatives, and open them up.
[02:28:10.761 --> 02:28:12.802]  And it's, every one, he goes, this looks like Greek.
[02:28:12.942 --> 02:28:13.682]  This looks like Greek.
[02:28:13.962 --> 02:28:17.863]  Sure, so, I mean, ballpark here, let's say somebody's got a million dollars in stocks.
[02:28:18.243 --> 02:28:20.324]  You could be collecting tens of thousands of dollars a month.
[02:28:20.724 --> 02:28:21.104]  Easily.
[02:28:21.304 --> 02:28:21.444]  Wow.
[02:28:22.816 --> 02:28:27.879]  And I've shown people like... Because a lot of stocks don't grow that much, but if you're renting them out, then you would make money.
[02:28:27.899 --> 02:28:29.760]  That's crazy.
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.160]  Yeah!
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:32.881]  If you put that in the bank, would you get half a percent interest?
[02:28:33.442 --> 02:28:33.642]  No!
[02:28:33.682 --> 02:28:37.264]  I'm talking about collecting, you know, thousands of dollars.
[02:28:37.564 --> 02:28:38.244]  See, that's what's crazy.
[02:28:38.264 --> 02:28:48.390]  They've gotten rid of with zero percent interest, regular folks getting interest, so the general public doesn't know what to do, but of course the elite created something for themselves, and that's what you've basically exposed and covered.
[02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:50.211]  I mean, I knew about this, but I'm...
[02:28:50.871 --> 02:28:52.192]  I'm glad you wrote a book about it.
[02:28:52.293 --> 02:28:53.033]  I'm glad you exposed it.
[02:28:53.193 --> 02:28:53.514]  It's amazing.
[02:28:53.534 --> 02:28:54.455]  There's only one type.
[02:28:54.715 --> 02:29:03.764]  Well, the reason why it's not... I wouldn't say it's not exposed, but most of these books were written for people or by people like me, PhDs in mathematics.
[02:29:04.711 --> 02:29:05.691]  No, I got it.
[02:29:05.751 --> 02:29:07.492]  You take it and put it into plain English.
[02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:09.912]  Yeah, I come from the hood, so I'm explaining to people.
[02:29:10.252 --> 02:29:10.832]  No, I hear you.
[02:29:10.892 --> 02:29:16.134]  I'm just so busy fighting the New World Order that I haven't had time to go out and get any stock or do that to try to fund the operation.
[02:29:16.154 --> 02:29:19.575]  But I sure wish I had, because I tell you, with what you're doing, it's amazing.
[02:29:19.595 --> 02:29:23.315]  Because there's nowhere you get real returns anymore except for select stocks.
[02:29:23.335 --> 02:29:25.596]  But if you rent the stocks, it's a whole other thing.
[02:29:25.636 --> 02:29:26.156]  That's crazy.
[02:29:26.716 --> 02:29:33.038]  Yeah, I mean, if you rent, say, 100 shares of Alibaba or maybe 500 shares of IBM,
[02:29:35.291 --> 02:29:46.519]  You can actually, if you understand, as I walk you through the book of how to choose the four or five parameters you need to choose for the options contract, which is not that hard, but you have to understand the terminology, and we explain it.
[02:29:46.639 --> 02:29:50.222]  Nugget, it's all language, and then poor people wonder why they're not successful.
[02:29:50.242 --> 02:29:53.064]  It's because they don't know these tricks, and there's so many in life.
[02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:53.844]  We'll be back.
[02:29:53.864 --> 02:29:55.525]  Stay with us.
[02:29:56.426 --> 02:29:59.128]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.806 --> 02:30:05.167]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.387 --> 02:30:10.210]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:10.651 --> 02:30:13.573]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:13.853 --> 02:30:19.216]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:19.657 --> 02:30:28.262]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:28.503 --> 02:30:33.586]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:33.846 --> 02:30:40.531]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:40.831 --> 02:30:45.414]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:30:45.574 --> 02:30:48.716]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[02:30:48.857 --> 02:30:50.758]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:50.958 --> 02:30:56.282]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[02:30:56.562 --> 02:30:58.543]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:58.844 --> 02:31:00.545]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:05.101]  Boy, did the travel ban get him going or what?
[02:31:05.241 --> 02:31:07.703]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[02:31:07.923 --> 02:31:09.284]  But why are they really protesting?
[02:31:09.404 --> 02:31:24.333]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees, or in 2015 when he signed the Visa Waiver Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of his 2015 Christmas gift, Omnibus Spending Bill, which also created the list of countries that Donald Trump chose.
[02:31:24.573 --> 02:31:27.315]  So why no protest then over Obama, but now over Trump?
[02:31:27.475 --> 02:31:28.856]  Coverage and transparency.
[02:31:29.056 --> 02:31:32.878]  See, Trump is transparent with the moves he is making, and the media is always in attack mode against him.
[02:31:33.038 --> 02:31:40.263]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them, the CNNs of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[02:31:40.423 --> 02:31:45.126]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic and Trump's travel ban will increase risk of Islamic terror.
[02:31:45.286 --> 02:31:53.771]  Yes, I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's fatal drones and bombs, which if we get to the bottom of that, would clear a lot of this up.
[02:31:53.911 --> 02:31:56.953]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[02:31:57.173 --> 02:31:57.453]  Why?
[02:31:57.673 --> 02:31:59.154]  Coverage and transparency.
[02:31:59.414 --> 02:32:01.676]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:02.887 --> 02:32:11.912]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:11.972 --> 02:32:20.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:20.376 --> 02:32:25.078]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:25.259 --> 02:32:31.982]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:32.042 --> 02:32:39.125]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:39.226 --> 02:32:46.089]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:46.249 --> 02:32:50.611]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:53.993]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:54.113 --> 02:33:00.237]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:33:00.417 --> 02:33:02.098]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:33:19.642 --> 02:33:23.544]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.505 --> 02:33:29.566]  All right, I'm going to jump into other news here in a few minutes, but right now we're talking to Dr. Iris Mack.
[02:33:30.727 --> 02:33:35.729]  MainStreetBailout.com is her website, her book, A Wall Street Bailout for Main Street.
[02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:38.210]  Again, quantify that for folks.
[02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:45.653]  Are you saying Main Street, the average person, can basically use these tricks that the insiders use to, like, buoy their financial standing?
[02:33:46.653 --> 02:33:47.554]  Yeah, it's not a trick.
[02:33:47.614 --> 02:34:00.642]  It's basically a legal contract that you can enter into with the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or whatever, where if you own stock, you can rent the stock back to the exchange and they pay you money.
[02:34:00.662 --> 02:34:01.122]  Wow.
[02:34:01.142 --> 02:34:02.103]  It's like renting an apartment.
[02:34:02.823 --> 02:34:03.384]  It's not a trick.
[02:34:03.624 --> 02:34:04.084]  It's illegal.
[02:34:04.785 --> 02:34:05.125]  It's legal.
[02:34:05.165 --> 02:34:05.585]  No, I know.
[02:34:05.605 --> 02:34:06.646]  I mean, I've seen it in the newspapers.
[02:34:06.726 --> 02:34:08.387]  I've seen it talked about and mentioned.
[02:34:08.407 --> 02:34:11.349]  Do you have any statistics on how many people actually use this?
[02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:13.270]  Well, I do.
[02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:14.470]  I break some of that down in a book.
[02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:18.772]  But if you go to Amazon, you'll see tons of books on options and derivatives.
[02:34:19.152 --> 02:34:22.233]  Only thing is, they're not written for the person on Main Street.
[02:34:22.853 --> 02:34:24.993]  Because I have a lot of those books on my bookshelves.
[02:34:25.254 --> 02:34:31.755]  I've used them when I worked in different financial energy firms or when I was a grad student or now that I teach.
[02:34:31.775 --> 02:34:33.456]  So there are a lot of books out there.
[02:34:33.476 --> 02:34:34.296]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:34:34.316 --> 02:34:35.436]  It's not like I'm doing something new.
[02:34:35.857 --> 02:34:36.637]  I just break it down.
[02:34:37.157 --> 02:34:37.277]  Wow.
[02:34:39.281 --> 02:34:43.424]  What do you make, just about the whole state of the country right now, the atmosphere, Dr. Mack?
[02:34:44.705 --> 02:34:54.693]  Well, I try to avoid having a lot of conversations with people I don't really know, because people look like they're on edge, and I'm like, I don't know, I got things to do, first of all, and second of all, I don't want to get hurt.
[02:34:54.853 --> 02:34:56.474]  No, I hear what you're saying.
[02:34:56.494 --> 02:34:58.055]  I mean, I've never seen an election like this.
[02:34:58.175 --> 02:35:01.898]  Usually people decide who they're going to vote for, and they do it, and that's the end of it.
[02:35:01.918 --> 02:35:05.561]  But now, you can't even talk about who you voted for or what you think.
[02:35:06.141 --> 02:35:07.042]  I've never seen this before.
[02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:10.652]  And I've noticed it, you know, getting worse over the years.
[02:35:11.132 --> 02:35:15.255]  And I've lived in different countries, and every time I come back, I see it looks like it's gotten worse.
[02:35:16.156 --> 02:35:16.636]  No, I agree.
[02:35:16.656 --> 02:35:27.003]  We've got a story up on DrugsReport.com dealing with the fact that the United States is basically on the verge of civil war with the usual suspects like George Soros trying to finance it.
[02:35:27.023 --> 02:35:29.184]  I just wonder, why are these people above the law?
[02:35:29.905 --> 02:35:32.507]  As we said earlier, if you or I were doing things like this, we'd be arrested.
[02:35:32.547 --> 02:35:32.967]  We should.
[02:35:32.987 --> 02:35:35.869]  I'm not an authoritarian, but
[02:35:37.312 --> 02:35:39.013]  They're not trying to yell fire in the theater.
[02:35:39.794 --> 02:35:41.335]  They're trying to burn down the theater.
[02:35:42.356 --> 02:35:45.178]  And I see all this with Trump really trying to bring Americans together.
[02:35:45.198 --> 02:35:46.879]  It's just very, very sad.
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:51.823]  Well, Dr. Iris Mack, we look forward to speaking to you again in the future at MainStreetBailout.com.
[02:35:51.843 --> 02:35:52.884]  Folks can find your book there.
[02:35:52.924 --> 02:35:53.564]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:54.185 --> 02:35:54.905]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:35:56.527 --> 02:35:57.668]  Yeah, I mean, I know about derivatives.
[02:35:58.857 --> 02:36:02.520]  If you just tuned in, we've shown some mainstream news articles talking about what she's talking about.
[02:36:02.841 --> 02:36:03.922]  She codifies it in the book.
[02:36:04.362 --> 02:36:05.123]  She's not a sponsor.
[02:36:05.143 --> 02:36:08.706]  I'm not plugging her book, you know, just to make money.
[02:36:08.746 --> 02:36:09.566]  I'm not selling the book.
[02:36:10.527 --> 02:36:16.553]  But I think it's important for people to think about the systems that globalists are using to consolidate control and have power.
[02:36:16.953 --> 02:36:24.359]  If we learn about those systems and use it for ourselves, they'll generally end up shutting it down because they don't want us having access to it.
[02:36:25.268 --> 02:36:33.853]  And if we're going to have all this fiat system and all these derivatives and all these extra trillions of dollars, it should actually go to the people and not to a bunch of elites.
[02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:42.838]  And that's what Trump's been doing, is he's been trying to create a level playing field for the people and delivering on everything he said he would do.
[02:36:42.898 --> 02:36:52.783]  And even if I disagree with some of what Trump's doing, and I disagree with very little, it's so refreshing, it's almost cliche to say, boy, I wish a politician would do what they said they'd do.
[02:36:54.386 --> 02:36:56.487]  In fact, I never thought in my life I'd see something like this.
[02:36:57.607 --> 02:37:01.249]  I thought he'd have to play politics with some people and water some stuff down.
[02:37:01.329 --> 02:37:01.509]  No.
[02:37:02.289 --> 02:37:06.931]  Because he's got the trifecta of the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[02:37:08.011 --> 02:37:08.912]  He's running over them.
[02:37:08.972 --> 02:37:13.413]  Now you've got the opposition party, as Spicer has properly said, that is MSM.
[02:37:13.933 --> 02:37:14.734]  That's the opposition.
[02:37:15.194 --> 02:37:20.456]  MSM and big megabanks and big corporations that don't want prosperity, they want a monopoly.
[02:37:21.425 --> 02:37:24.466]  Because something weird happened on the way to success the last 50, 60 years.
[02:37:25.046 --> 02:37:31.168]  All these rich bankers, all these rich guys that made all this money off our free system, they don't like lines.
[02:37:31.388 --> 02:37:32.609]  They don't like traffic.
[02:37:33.649 --> 02:37:41.712]  They like their golf courses and their, you know, Hawaiian botanical garden retreats.
[02:37:42.332 --> 02:37:47.074]  And they're really upset about civilization and other people doing well.
[02:37:48.385 --> 02:37:50.686]  Okay, so the population's a plague.
[02:37:50.746 --> 02:37:51.687]  Kill yourselves first.
[02:37:52.788 --> 02:37:56.990]  Don't live like kings with a huge footprint and then tell us we can't exist.
[02:37:58.471 --> 02:38:16.061]  And so this is the giant mass of humanity saying, we want prosperity and we're not going to be lectured by people that have 15 mistresses and jumbo jets and 20 mansions apiece and who are all obsessed with their privacy but we can't have privacy because you say we're not human but you are.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:19.844]  Zuckerberg, you made money off the human system.
[02:38:20.145 --> 02:38:22.247]  Humans are what empowers you, dumbass.
[02:38:22.628 --> 02:38:26.934]  You're not gonna just take all this energy and stuff, and then leave and set up your own thing in Kauai.
[02:38:28.135 --> 02:38:33.342]  If there ever is a new world order and extermination of the people, you're not gonna be safe anywhere, boy!
[02:38:34.833 --> 02:38:36.194]  I don't say that threatening you.
[02:38:36.254 --> 02:38:37.134]  I know you're a spook.
[02:38:37.734 --> 02:38:39.675]  I know you're a front man for a larger operation.
[02:38:40.095 --> 02:38:42.416]  The point is you're threatening my life and my family's life.
[02:38:42.496 --> 02:38:46.977]  And as your own admissions now have come out, the Globalists admit they're in a death battle.
[02:38:47.598 --> 02:38:49.718]  Well, I knew this was a death battle a long time ago.
[02:38:50.779 --> 02:38:53.400]  I get threats sometimes from people and I make a joke back at them.
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:56.221]  I say, you don't think I hadn't been threatened before?
[02:38:57.691 --> 02:38:59.553]  What I don't want to be around is dishonor.
[02:39:00.373 --> 02:39:03.636]  What I don't want to be around is snakes and infiltrators.
[02:39:03.716 --> 02:39:05.177]  I fear that more than death itself.
[02:39:05.517 --> 02:39:07.019]  Because I'm sick of scum.
[02:39:07.719 --> 02:39:08.840]  I'm sick of cowards.
[02:39:10.421 --> 02:39:21.490]  And I'm sick of people that curl up like snakes next to the power structure and think because they've sold out to evil somehow they're winners.
[02:39:22.291 --> 02:39:22.991]  It's a delusion.
[02:39:23.051 --> 02:39:26.034]  It's like imagining you're Captain America when you're not.
[02:39:27.466 --> 02:39:32.449]  And we're just not gonna build a good world with people like this at the helm.
[02:39:32.509 --> 02:39:36.232]  So I'm just here to put my energy into defeating these people.
[02:39:37.252 --> 02:39:41.815]  I personally am so self-centered that I'm not self-centered.
[02:39:43.176 --> 02:39:43.676]  Understand?
[02:39:44.477 --> 02:39:48.059]  I'm so committed to the individual that I'm willing to give my life for the individual.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:55.724]  I'm so committed to the species because I'm part of it and I love it so much that it's not even a discussion.
[02:39:56.986 --> 02:40:00.048]  Of fear of being killed or demonized or attacked or lied about.
[02:40:00.069 --> 02:40:04.152]  People all the time, I get calls every day like from cousins and family and neighbors.
[02:40:04.192 --> 02:40:08.916]  God, I saw you get attacked on two different news channels tonight, local and national.
[02:40:09.296 --> 02:40:11.618]  They were saying horrible things about you this morning on the local radio.
[02:40:12.438 --> 02:40:13.319]  How are you doing?
[02:40:13.359 --> 02:40:13.699]  How are you?
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:16.602]  Well, I don't judge myself off somebody else.
[02:40:17.699 --> 02:40:20.480]  I judge myself off what I'm doing, and that's why I've changed the world.
[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:25.522]  What other people say to me, when I know it's a template of BS, means nothing.
[02:40:25.862 --> 02:40:29.244]  Now people I trust and love and care about, what they say means a lot to me.
[02:40:31.084 --> 02:40:32.225]  But people I know are scum?
[02:40:36.667 --> 02:40:41.509]  I basically soar like a condor on the winds on their attacks.
[02:40:42.169 --> 02:40:44.210]  Because that's what guides me towards my target.
[02:40:45.342 --> 02:40:52.947]  Now I've got probably, they probably brought in 30 articles since I've been on air, I've probably got 200 articles here in front of me, and I've got 20 minutes left before David Knight takes over.
[02:40:53.387 --> 02:40:54.507]  I want to just read headlines.
[02:40:54.788 --> 02:40:56.649]  Some of this I've already covered, some of this I haven't.
[02:40:59.410 --> 02:41:01.632]  But let me just start just randomly wherever.
[02:41:02.552 --> 02:41:03.173]  Flashback!
[02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:06.415]  Anti-Trump Dems oppose Vietnamese refugees.
[02:41:07.055 --> 02:41:08.936]  CliffordCunninghamInfoWars.com.
[02:41:09.556 --> 02:41:13.619]  And of course they tried to block Vietnamese because they were anti-communist, just like Trump
[02:41:14.705 --> 02:41:16.507]  is battling people that are incompatible.
[02:41:16.867 --> 02:41:18.108]  Well, that's because he's a patriot.
[02:41:18.148 --> 02:41:19.249]  He doesn't want to bring Islamists in.
[02:41:19.669 --> 02:41:23.952]  Well, Biden doesn't want Vietnamese refugees because they're anti-communist.
[02:41:24.233 --> 02:41:25.934]  They fought his loving Viet Cong.
[02:41:26.454 --> 02:41:28.976]  And Obama doesn't want Cubans in because they're anti-communist.
[02:41:29.036 --> 02:41:33.760]  See how all the other refugees are great as long as they're not compatible.
[02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:36.903]  But if they are compatible with a free society, they don't want them in.
[02:41:37.639 --> 02:41:39.681]  That's one article, I just spent two minutes on it, but there's hundreds.
[02:41:40.281 --> 02:41:45.485]  Doctors told not to say expectant mothers to avoid offending trannies.
[02:41:46.426 --> 02:41:56.973]  Because if you're at an O-G-B-Y-N facility, don't say to a pregnant woman, hey, expectant mothers, that might hurt a tranny that's in the birthing facility.
[02:41:57.374 --> 02:42:00.316]  See, the whole world has to be about not offending some group.
[02:42:00.616 --> 02:42:02.718]  This is just sabotage of civilization.
[02:42:02.998 --> 02:42:04.279]  It has nothing to do with trannies.
[02:42:06.138 --> 02:42:11.202]  That's like some type of Grand Falloon Kurt Vonnegut novel from 50 years ago about an insane society.
[02:42:12.402 --> 02:42:22.429]  Pregnant people is the preferred nomenclature because you can't have women and men because that's sexist.
[02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:24.051]  To have sexist.
[02:42:24.931 --> 02:42:26.172]  That's all at fullwords.com.
[02:42:26.472 --> 02:42:29.234]  Trump signs executive order to slash regulations by two-thirds.
[02:42:29.855 --> 02:42:32.296]  Iran tests ballistic missile in defiance of U.N.
[02:42:32.336 --> 02:42:32.877]  resolution.
[02:42:33.417 --> 02:42:33.537]  U.S.
[02:42:33.577 --> 02:42:34.158]  officials say
[02:42:35.529 --> 02:42:37.571]  Why Hollywood as we know it is already over.
[02:42:37.651 --> 02:42:38.111]  That's right.
[02:42:38.472 --> 02:42:40.353]  Vanity Fair admits Hollywood's collapsing.
[02:42:40.513 --> 02:42:41.274]  That's something we told you.
[02:42:41.774 --> 02:42:46.438]  Oh look, NBC wants to be the next Fox News insider say with a turn towards the right.
[02:42:46.839 --> 02:42:52.183]  No, it'll be the Glenn Beck model where you say you're a conservative and you attack it all day like Megyn Kelly and him.
[02:42:52.584 --> 02:42:55.526]  So, NBC wants to be the Judas goat of conservatives.
[02:42:56.027 --> 02:43:00.190]  Because they can trick you better if they give you a few conservative stories that manipulate you.
[02:43:00.471 --> 02:43:02.612]  That's the New York Post translation by Alex Jones.
[02:43:03.493 --> 02:43:06.356]  With the old Sea Hag, Megyn Kelly.
[02:43:07.497 --> 02:43:09.999]  Buck County authorities make arrest in fetish theme.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.681]  Child predators ring.
[02:43:12.701 --> 02:43:15.704]  There were raping little kids dressed up in teddy bear outfits.
[02:43:15.724 --> 02:43:18.126]  You know, you see that in the movie The Shining.
[02:43:19.527 --> 02:43:24.391]  He walks into a hallway and he sees like a ghost of a little girl being raped by guys dressed like teddy bears.
[02:43:24.411 --> 02:43:25.232]  That's what the elite do.
[02:43:27.133 --> 02:43:27.754]  They're the elite.
[02:43:28.214 --> 02:43:28.494]  Scum.
[02:43:30.785 --> 02:43:32.146]  Hell has been prepared for them.
[02:43:32.947 --> 02:43:34.969]  California's secession is a bad idea.
[02:43:35.169 --> 02:43:35.569]  I agree.
[02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:37.471]  Division in the two states are better.
[02:43:37.491 --> 02:43:39.293]  Yeah, make the North libertarian.
[02:43:39.313 --> 02:43:40.934]  It'll be totally prosperous.
[02:43:40.954 --> 02:43:43.096]  Let the South be a den of failure.
[02:43:44.057 --> 02:43:46.239]  Texas mocks destroyed an early morning blaze.
[02:43:46.299 --> 02:43:48.962]  I bet it comes out later that it was an insurance fire.
[02:43:49.682 --> 02:43:50.363]  Always are.
[02:43:50.964 --> 02:43:52.105]  Always false flags.
[02:43:52.645 --> 02:43:56.048]  Security camera shows latest vandal damaging Greenlawn Cemetery.
[02:43:57.045 --> 02:44:00.467]  Canadian PM says Moss shooting a terrorist attack on Muslims.
[02:44:01.087 --> 02:44:03.048]  Now they're trying to go back to that narrative as we speak.
[02:44:03.068 --> 02:44:04.949]  Earlier saying al-Akbar, now they're not.
[02:44:05.609 --> 02:44:07.090]  Yeah, it looks like a false flag, doesn't it?
[02:44:07.130 --> 02:44:08.071]  We'll research it more.
[02:44:11.332 --> 02:44:13.934]  Freed Pakistani bloggers go abroad for safety.
[02:44:14.434 --> 02:44:19.737]  Oh, because you don't even have free speech in Pakistan, but we're supposed to bring anybody in who wants to come in, even though they have an Islamic background.
[02:44:20.037 --> 02:44:23.419]  And Trump is letting them all in, so he's more of a bigot for doing that.
[02:44:24.292 --> 02:44:25.734]  Because there's no such thing as common sense.
[02:44:26.194 --> 02:44:31.380]  Thousands protest Trump's immigration order after George Soros sends out the activation over their email.
[02:44:32.521 --> 02:44:34.964]  So fun to have a Nazi collaborator give you orders.
[02:44:34.984 --> 02:44:36.806]  Of course, the Nazis collaborated with Islamists.
[02:44:37.287 --> 02:44:39.649]  So that makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
[02:44:41.111 --> 02:44:43.193]  Expect more conflict between cities and states.
[02:44:44.418 --> 02:44:51.246]  Pew is reporting, the globalists are funding cities to battle against states that actually have elected governments that are battling globalism.
[02:44:51.486 --> 02:44:55.411]  That's the Schwarzenegger model to get carbon taxes in on a city-by-city basis.
[02:44:55.771 --> 02:44:57.573]  Austin is a pathetic example of that.
[02:44:59.035 --> 02:45:01.938]  Unions and Border Patrol and ICE agents cheer Trump's actions.
[02:45:02.419 --> 02:45:03.620]  Here's the powerful letter.
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:05.042]  I want to read part of it.
[02:45:07.449 --> 02:45:20.523]  As representatives of the nation's frontline immigration officers and agents responsible for enforcing our laws, protecting our borders, we fully support and appreciate President Trump's swift and decisive action to keep the American people safe and allow law enforcement to do its job.
[02:45:20.984 --> 02:45:26.230]  We applaud the three executive orders he has signed to date and are confident they will make America safe and more prosperous.
[02:45:27.523 --> 02:45:32.187]  Morale amongst our agents and officers has increased exponentially since the signing of the orders.
[02:45:32.227 --> 02:45:41.054]  The men and women of ICE and Border Patrol will work tirelessly to keep criminals, terrorists, and public safety threats out of this country, which remains the number one target in the world.
[02:45:41.514 --> 02:45:49.981]  And President Trump's actions now empower us to fulfill his life-saving mission, and it will indeed save thousands of lives and billions of dollars.
[02:45:50.701 --> 02:45:51.282]  From the Union.
[02:45:52.771 --> 02:45:55.673]  Okay, I just had about 20 articles, got about 250 left.
[02:45:56.194 --> 02:45:59.256]  Trump's next immigration move to hit closer to home for tech.
[02:46:00.056 --> 02:46:05.300]  He wants to see if there's jobs for American engineers and people that have been laid off before we bring in folks to replace them.
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:06.481]  I think that's reasonable.
[02:46:06.501 --> 02:46:11.365]  A lot of folks with engineering degrees of every color that can't get a job because they've been undercut.
[02:46:11.385 --> 02:46:13.546]  Doesn't help India and China when we undercut.
[02:46:13.967 --> 02:46:14.887]  Only helps the globalists.
[02:46:15.188 --> 02:46:18.030]  Then they jack up their crap products to even prices that are too high.
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:23.181]  Violent leftist knocked Trump supporter unconscious at Portland Airport.
[02:46:23.741 --> 02:46:24.501]  Man, I tell ya.
[02:46:27.762 --> 02:46:29.122]  You punch me, I punch you back.
[02:46:29.462 --> 02:46:30.782]  And then I slam your head in the concrete.
[02:46:30.802 --> 02:46:35.303]  I'm not bragging, but I mean, you get in a fight with me, you're really gambling with your life.
[02:46:36.203 --> 02:46:40.964]  And I just want to tell all these people, they're really lucky they haven't run into somebody yet like me.
[02:46:40.984 --> 02:46:45.205]  Because I run into a lot of guys that tie me up and rip, you know, tie me up in a bow.
[02:46:46.477 --> 02:46:49.658]  I mean, you know, it wasn't that easy, but I've had my ass kicked pretty bad.
[02:46:50.358 --> 02:46:58.501]  And I just wonder, like, if I'm in, say, the 90th percentile, where is the 10% up there that I know are badder than I am who put up with this crap?
[02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.942]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:47:01.182 --> 02:47:07.604]  Let's roll this 30-second video of, if you dare have free speech for America, some masked little thug anarchist.
[02:47:09.785 --> 02:47:10.505]  We're showing video.
[02:47:11.445 --> 02:47:12.146]  Yeah, that's swear words.
[02:47:12.206 --> 02:47:13.386]  Okay, I knew there was audio, so I was warning.
[02:47:13.786 --> 02:47:15.427]  And then they're just allowed to attack whoever they want.
[02:47:16.223 --> 02:47:21.945]  Just a bunch of little punk thugs all celebrating as wimps, as betas, that they just knocked somebody out.
[02:47:22.985 --> 02:47:26.767]  And Garren, I mean, I just... I just want one of them to do that to me.
[02:47:26.927 --> 02:47:28.928]  Because, I don't want them to, but you know what I mean.
[02:47:29.008 --> 02:47:33.029]  I mean, if I just get a cl... Every time they're about to attack me, the police show up and stop them.
[02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:37.051]  And I just want to connect one time with their nose or jaw.
[02:47:37.631 --> 02:47:41.192]  And they're... And I... And... And... And... I mean, it's... It's... It's what they deserve.
[02:47:42.273 --> 02:47:43.033]  Anyway, side issue.
[02:47:44.522 --> 02:47:48.184]  Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley.
[02:47:49.886 --> 02:47:51.166]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[02:47:51.186 --> 02:47:52.167]  Here's some really big news.
[02:47:53.388 --> 02:47:54.128]  Shock poll!
[02:47:54.188 --> 02:47:57.611]  Marie Le Pen to lead French presidential race in first round of voting.
[02:47:57.871 --> 02:47:59.832]  I told you she's been ahead in the polls for a year.
[02:48:00.213 --> 02:48:03.375]  Now they're getting ready to move into the election and she's already way ahead.
[02:48:03.795 --> 02:48:04.535]  They are panicking.
[02:48:04.575 --> 02:48:05.636]  The Trump effect continues.
[02:48:05.936 --> 02:48:06.837]  She's a nationalist.
[02:48:06.877 --> 02:48:07.998]  It's basically like Ron Paul.
[02:48:08.298 --> 02:48:09.178]  So they call her a Nazi.
[02:48:09.198 --> 02:48:12.601]  Even though her father fought the Nazis as a paratrooper.
[02:48:13.081 --> 02:48:16.263]  Trump's snub for the Green Prince, another beautiful thing happening.
[02:48:16.543 --> 02:48:24.506]  Prince Charles, that arrogant, lazy, stupid, Transylvanian fop, will not be meeting with the 45th President.
[02:48:24.887 --> 02:48:30.249]  He goes, President Trump will avoid Charles on state visits to the UK because he wants to escape a lecture on climate change.
[02:48:30.969 --> 02:48:38.573]  Yeah, where it's always in public at the Prince, it's his third lectures about how he wants to shut down industry in the West because he owns Chinese factories.
[02:48:40.143 --> 02:48:40.383]  U.S.
[02:48:40.423 --> 02:48:42.864]  trial restrictions put Saudi Arabia in a bind.
[02:48:42.884 --> 02:48:49.466]  Well, if you're a Christian, you can't preach the gospel there, so I don't want to hear it from unfree societies that won't let us fly in about what we've got to do with them.
[02:48:49.486 --> 02:48:55.168]  Puerto Rico governor signs financial emergency law.
[02:48:55.188 --> 02:48:58.068]  A bunch of economic tyranny taking place there.
[02:48:58.088 --> 02:49:00.449]  Okay, that's about 40 articles I got to.
[02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:01.609]  I've got about 200 left here.
[02:49:01.689 --> 02:49:02.930]  Seriously, probably 200 left here.
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:06.421]  Let's continue here in the News Blitz.
[02:49:07.221 --> 02:49:12.203]  Dems clueless on Trump's SCOTUS pick, Supreme Court pick, but they'll block anyways.
[02:49:12.663 --> 02:49:14.264]  Jamie White, Infowars.com.
[02:49:14.784 --> 02:49:20.146]  A little birdie told me it had been Napolitano, but the decision was made to go off the original list because Trump doesn't want to break one promise.
[02:49:21.007 --> 02:49:24.328]  Even though he loves Napolitano and this has met with him like six times.
[02:49:25.188 --> 02:49:28.730]  There you go, a Quebec Moss shooting, a devastating blow to leftist narrative.
[02:49:30.475 --> 02:49:33.716]  What would happen in minutes and hours after a coup in America?
[02:49:33.776 --> 02:49:35.497]  Vice promotes basically assassination.
[02:49:36.057 --> 02:49:38.678]  Times journalist calls for President Trump to be assassinated.
[02:49:39.279 --> 02:49:41.720]  Looks like she couldn't assassinate washing her own ass.
[02:49:42.140 --> 02:49:42.540]  Excuse me.
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.782]  Trump gives Pentagon 30 days to develop strategy to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
[02:49:48.302 --> 02:49:54.605]  And how does the little globalist neocon Saudi Arabian minion, he cleaned out Brennan but he hadn't got rid of
[02:49:55.365 --> 02:49:59.850]  Lindsey Graham and the other Al-Qaeda operative, I'm serious, John McCain.
[02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:02.152]  Focus on ISIS not starting World War III.
[02:50:02.192 --> 02:50:08.278]  Trump blasts Senators McCain and Graham in a tweet, powerful article, up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:17.348]  Supreme Court nomination will come tomorrow as Trump strains to shift national conversation away from Friday's travel ban order.
[02:50:18.254 --> 02:50:19.255]  I'm not trying to shift away.
[02:50:19.275 --> 02:50:20.577]  He's just doing what he said he'd do.
[02:50:20.597 --> 02:50:21.218]  It's very popular.
[02:50:33.052 --> 02:50:34.653]  Trump signs the order, flashing.
[02:50:34.953 --> 02:50:35.893]  Schumer tears up.
[02:50:35.993 --> 02:50:36.813]  Totally ridiculous.
[02:50:38.174 --> 02:50:39.734]  I've covered some of this, haven't covered some of it.
[02:50:39.754 --> 02:50:40.735]  I've got a bunch of other news.
[02:50:41.275 --> 02:50:43.676]  Mount Vesuvius may blow up in a super volcano.
[02:50:44.056 --> 02:50:45.696]  Killed hundreds of thousands of Romans before.
[02:50:45.776 --> 02:50:46.657]  Will it do it again?
[02:50:46.677 --> 02:50:49.458]  We've got that news story and a lot more straight ahead.
[02:50:49.478 --> 02:50:50.258]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:50.578 --> 02:50:51.658]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:50:51.758 --> 02:50:53.179]  InfoWars.com.
[02:50:53.459 --> 02:50:54.179]  Spread that link.
[02:50:54.219 --> 02:50:55.440]  The enemy absolutely hates it.
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:56.420]  They're censoring it.
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.701]  Are you helping us?
[02:50:57.841 --> 02:51:01.522]  I know we're fighting as hard as we can, so keep spreading the links and the videos and the articles.
[02:51:07.330 --> 02:51:15.034]  He's the main progenitor of reversing decades of free speech being shut down in this country.
[02:51:15.274 --> 02:51:16.835]  So where are the other men doing this?
[02:51:16.895 --> 02:51:22.498]  Well, people like Trump are fighting to crush the establishment media just by simply allowing competition.
[02:51:23.098 --> 02:51:27.820]  And this time, it isn't even about the broadcast spectrum, it's about mainstream media discrediting themselves.
[02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:37.343]  It's surreal to watch how truly authoritarian these people are, but they're having their victory jerked away from them at the last moment, so they're going into conniption fits.
[02:51:37.723 --> 02:51:47.166]  I mean, the great worry is, you could get companies like Facebook, and they've already given some indication that they'll yank what they decide is so-called fake news.
[02:51:47.766 --> 02:51:49.907]  That you'll have private censorship.
[02:51:51.508 --> 02:51:56.870]  Maybe Twitter would do the same thing, because they are clearly in the liberal camp.
[02:51:57.631 --> 02:52:01.292]  They're the ones who were close to Obama and Hillary.
[02:52:01.372 --> 02:52:14.939]  The statute basically has the federal government involved in monitoring all of cyberspace, including broadcasters, to determine whether there's so-called fake news, whatever.
[02:52:15.339 --> 02:52:16.920]  The government decides it's fake news.
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:17.300]  I think so.
[02:52:38.655 --> 02:52:40.656]  Sure, I'm trying to cipher this new FCC head.
[02:52:41.156 --> 02:52:53.059]  So just, you heard my breakdown of what I've read from his position, and the fact that it looks like he is trying to keep a free internet, they're spinning it, that he's trying to take over a free internet, and wants to shut down Drudge.
[02:52:53.460 --> 02:52:54.680]  I believe he's saying the opposite.
[02:52:55.512 --> 02:52:57.414]  You know, I believe that's certainly true.
[02:52:57.434 --> 02:53:18.932]  I think that the large amount of political momentum against them will be those who want so-called net neutrality, that is, to enable the super-huge people like Google to be able to not pay their way in the Internet or in the cyberspace.
[02:53:19.352 --> 02:53:22.253]  The net neutrality is like this, Alex.
[02:53:22.274 --> 02:53:26.376]  It would be like saying the airlines couldn't offer first-class tickets.
[02:53:26.916 --> 02:53:33.619]  That they had to treat all passengers the same, even though some would be willing to pay more for superior service.
[02:53:34.179 --> 02:53:37.681]  I mean, which is satisfactory to everyone.
[02:53:38.001 --> 02:53:41.583]  If you don't want to pay more, then you would have a different kind of service.
[02:53:42.123 --> 02:53:43.404]  I mean, and that would be absurd.
[02:53:43.464 --> 02:53:51.447]  It would be like saying, you know, you can't have FedEx anymore because, you know, you're paying to get your packages delivered faster than the post office.
[02:53:51.767 --> 02:53:52.188]  Really?
[02:53:54.469 --> 02:53:57.910]  If we always had to live, we can't even survive today without FedEx.
[02:54:28.326 --> 02:54:34.633]  Escape from the prison planet by building a new free planet.
[02:54:34.653 --> 02:54:37.857]  1776 Worldwide.
[02:54:37.897 --> 02:54:38.838]  David Knight's taking off.
[02:54:39.815 --> 02:54:41.596]  Taking over the operation here in about 10 minutes.
[02:54:41.616 --> 02:54:57.983]  I'm gonna do the next segment, but you know, I sit here looking at how historic things are, how important they are, how critical, how pivotal, how crossroads, how amazing, how exciting, how over-the-top, how unreal, how surreal, how magic, how compelling.
[02:54:58.925 --> 02:55:12.246]  And I'm just drawn to resist and drawn to stand up for what's good when the enemy is so obviously snot-nosed and evil and just pissed that it's not beautiful like our free society is compared to what they're building.
[02:55:14.537 --> 02:55:28.981]  And so that's why I said to the viewers and listeners, it's essential that you understand you are critical and key and the heart and the blood and the oxygen and the lungs and the brain and the eyes and the skin and the muscle and the bones and the organs of everything we're doing.
[02:55:30.421 --> 02:55:32.962]  That's why it's an abomination when you call up and thank me.
[02:55:33.542 --> 02:55:36.583]  I'm just a focal point in this.
[02:55:37.943 --> 02:55:44.005]  We're individuals, but we're a colony organism that is the species against the new world order.
[02:55:44.994 --> 02:55:46.755]  That is a parasitic system, a cancer.
[02:55:48.336 --> 02:55:54.941]  And so when you spread the videos, the articles, when you buy the products, when you pray for us, whatever it is you do, it's all just as important.
[02:55:56.482 --> 02:56:05.889]  But I want to encourage you to go to InfoWarsStore.com, 25% off on water filters, 25% off on air filter systems at the house that are already super low price, super high quality.
[02:56:06.610 --> 02:56:08.331]  A lot of different specials on nutraceuticals.
[02:56:08.351 --> 02:56:10.993]  InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:56:14.861 --> 02:56:16.543]  I'm going to be making some big announcements tomorrow.
[02:56:17.864 --> 02:56:20.786]  We are going to be launching a bureau in D.C.
[02:56:21.287 --> 02:56:30.875]  and I've got a lot of big journalists with big names that want to work with us that have been contacting us, especially when the media made that big thing about how we want White House press credentials.
[02:56:30.895 --> 02:56:32.376]  I mean, I've got people that have had them before.
[02:56:32.777 --> 02:56:33.557]  It's a non-issue.
[02:56:34.827 --> 02:56:37.208]  Media makes a big thing like, oh you're not media, you don't get them.
[02:56:37.409 --> 02:56:40.030]  It's just all about how they label and control reality.
[02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.811]  It's all a big joke.
[02:56:41.231 --> 02:56:44.313]  It isn't about being in the press conferences is so important, though we will be obviously.
[02:56:45.113 --> 02:56:54.279]  It's that we're going to be there as investigative journalists like Veritas and we're going to be there covering the retake of America.
[02:56:54.319 --> 02:56:55.399]  Before there was a reason to be there.
[02:56:55.739 --> 02:56:57.060]  It was also fake both parties.
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:58.421]  This is history happening.
[02:57:00.353 --> 02:57:04.294]  And it'll take capital to do it, but man, we got great products that everybody needs.
[02:57:04.914 --> 02:57:07.975]  And buying them from us, I'm already competitive in the pricing.
[02:57:08.255 --> 02:57:09.515]  A lot of our stuff's proprietary.
[02:57:10.115 --> 02:57:22.138]  You're really screwing yourself over if you don't get DNA Force, or Biome Defense Probiotic, or X2, or Knockout, or Super Mill Vitality, or 10% off right now on our vitamin B12 that's totally organic.
[02:57:22.938 --> 02:57:23.679]  Take it out of the tongue.
[02:57:23.699 --> 02:57:24.960]  Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:26.661]  This is stuff that's game-changing.
[02:57:27.301 --> 02:57:30.924]  I know people personally that have all sorts of bowel problems and I tell them, take a good probiotic.
[02:57:31.024 --> 02:57:31.424]  They won't do it.
[02:57:31.444 --> 02:57:34.647]  And I hear, oh, I'm gonna have to have surgery because of my guts.
[02:57:35.147 --> 02:57:36.008]  Well, yeah, because all the...
[02:57:37.659 --> 02:57:40.880]  Herbicides and stuff in the food has killed all the bacteria in your gut, man.
[02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:42.220]  Take the real stuff.
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:43.121]  People just can't do it.
[02:57:43.741 --> 02:57:47.042]  This stuff, look how much, I don't look great, okay, but I mean, I gained 100 pounds.
[02:57:47.082 --> 02:57:48.022]  I've lost 60-something.
[02:57:48.502 --> 02:57:49.322]  I'm super healthy.
[02:57:49.342 --> 02:57:50.023]  I have more energy.
[02:57:50.063 --> 02:57:50.863]  My skin glows.
[02:57:51.283 --> 02:57:52.383]  It's because I take these products.
[02:57:53.284 --> 02:57:55.404]  Infowarslife.com, infowarshore.com.
[02:57:55.424 --> 02:57:59.245]  But listen, let's just say the products are mediocre and they're not.
[02:57:59.866 --> 02:58:00.866]  You need to fund us.
[02:58:02.113 --> 02:58:04.055]  We need the money to really get aggressive.
[02:58:04.255 --> 02:58:06.858]  And quite frankly, I don't want to launch all this stuff.
[02:58:06.898 --> 02:58:11.944]  I don't want to do it, but I have a duty to do it, and I'm going to do it with pleasure, and with glee, and with very aggressive tendencies.
[02:58:12.505 --> 02:58:14.187]  And truth is our weapon and our guiding light.
[02:58:16.209 --> 02:58:16.790]  And gods are...
[02:58:24.476 --> 02:58:27.318]  I got more stories I want to hit.
[02:58:27.398 --> 02:58:28.799]  I'm gonna go into David Nye a little bit.
[02:58:28.819 --> 02:58:30.000]  I got a bunch of meetings to do.
[02:58:30.441 --> 02:58:32.542]  But David Nye always doing a great job in the fourth hour.
[02:58:32.583 --> 02:58:34.324]  He's coming up, one of our great investigative journalists.
[02:58:34.864 --> 02:58:36.586]  I'm Alex Jones and you built it!
[02:58:37.066 --> 02:58:40.669]  You are the InfoWar and you're seeing the effects right now.
[02:58:41.249 --> 02:58:41.990]  Globalism is
[02:58:43.311 --> 02:58:47.974]  Crippled, on fire, failing, but launching counter offensive.
[02:58:47.994 --> 02:58:49.114]  Stay with us.
[02:58:53.944 --> 02:58:55.845]  New video on InfoWars.com
[02:59:23.563 --> 02:59:32.250]  I went to the March for Life in Austin wearing my Make America Great Again gear and I experienced zero negativity for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male.
[02:59:32.370 --> 02:59:39.816]  When I put the marchers and their signs on camera, they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language.
[02:59:39.997 --> 02:59:46.902]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones, I challenge you to take to the streets with Make America Great Again gear on.
[02:59:47.102 --> 02:59:49.945]  You will experience more hate than you ever have in your life.
[02:59:50.145 --> 02:59:52.447]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com
[02:59:54.969 --> 03:00:00.933]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.897 --> 03:00:09.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.999 --> 03:00:15.803]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
[03:00:21.104 --> 03:00:22.285]  His name's Donald Trump.
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:05.763]  I want to host a little bit of this segment next with David, then I'm going to get out of here.
[03:01:05.823 --> 03:01:09.004]  But David, tell us what you got coming up in a minute.
[03:01:09.024 --> 03:01:10.945]  But first, David Knight, I want to ask you this question.
[03:01:12.864 --> 03:01:21.491]  Man, they really are all over the news calling for Trump to die and like salivating and having orgasms and dreams about how a coup is totally normal and really cool.
[03:01:21.571 --> 03:01:29.818]  And I look like this army of like really weak chicken neck people who've never actually even studied war calling for it, but they've got Soros backing it.
[03:01:31.179 --> 03:01:37.465]  I mean, I'm not somebody that's calling for them to all be arrested, but if we were all organizing insurrection and overthrow and killing, I mean, we should be.
[03:01:37.565 --> 03:01:39.967]  I mean, I don't want to have a fight with these people.
[03:01:40.007 --> 03:01:40.667]  I don't want to touch them.
[03:01:41.610 --> 03:01:49.452]  But at the same time, I mean, they really are pushing for criminal activity, and I don't get their sense of confidence.
[03:01:50.438 --> 03:01:55.601]  Yeah, Alex, you know, it's like the difference between protests and riots, and we have to draw that distinction.
[03:01:56.282 --> 03:02:03.567]  And there was a back and forth going last week with Sean Spicer saying, don't call the people with the pro-life march, don't call them demonstrators.
[03:02:03.587 --> 03:02:05.088]  Well, it's okay to call them demonstrators.
[03:02:05.108 --> 03:02:07.229]  I mean, that's, they call themselves demonstrators.
[03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:10.091]  The problem is, is when we call rioters demonstrators.
[03:02:10.532 --> 03:02:12.473]  And they always play with the language that way.
[03:02:12.553 --> 03:02:18.077]  So when you go out and you start criticizing somebody, it's never been accepted to call for their murder.
[03:02:18.857 --> 03:02:21.759]  And we're very careful not to do that when we disagree with people.
[03:02:22.359 --> 03:02:30.623]  If the liberals would look at this, they would understand that they've already gotten more from Donald Trump than we got from Barack Obama in eight years.
[03:02:30.843 --> 03:02:32.144]  That only scares them more.
[03:02:32.964 --> 03:02:34.105]  They want misery.
[03:02:34.145 --> 03:02:42.089]  They don't want free market to deliver because they're just all, they have this weird reflected glory off a big government.
[03:02:42.169 --> 03:02:45.911]  Even though they're losers and don't get any of it, they get off on it.
[03:02:46.533 --> 03:02:48.574]  Well, it's simply partisan politics.
[03:02:48.654 --> 03:02:51.495]  It's simply trying to make Trump look bad so they can make themselves look good.
[03:02:51.515 --> 03:02:53.016]  Look, they don't want the TPP.
[03:02:53.096 --> 03:02:56.257]  One of the first things he did was to take down the TPP.
[03:02:56.758 --> 03:02:59.519]  Barack Obama never did anything I agreed with in eight years.
[03:02:59.999 --> 03:03:07.662]  And these people will not work with him on the issues like taking down NAFTA, taking down TPP that they say that they wanted to deliver on.
[03:03:07.702 --> 03:03:08.383]  We're day nine now.
[03:03:08.443 --> 03:03:09.343]  What do you make of Trump?
[03:03:09.403 --> 03:03:10.604]  I mean, he's just doing everything he said he'd do.
[03:03:11.504 --> 03:03:21.947]  It's pretty amazing, Alex, because, you know, he's coming through with this stuff so quickly that it's difficult for both the people who support him and the people who oppose him to get down to all the details of what he's done.
[03:03:21.987 --> 03:03:24.528]  We're going to try to do a little bit more of that in this next hour.
[03:03:24.908 --> 03:03:34.951]  But it is absolutely amazing the rapid pace that he's doing, to the extent that some people have said, maybe this is a tactic, maybe he's doing this so quickly that they can't really hit him on one thing before he goes to another one.
[03:03:34.991 --> 03:03:36.592]  Sure, but I mean, he's doing things really smart.
[03:03:37.392 --> 03:03:50.364]  Like, you know, they've been pre-planning, like, oh, Obama passed a law in 2013 and had another order in 2010 doing exactly this, so knowing he's only doing what's already been done, I mean, it's just really smart.
[03:03:50.484 --> 03:03:51.025]  I'm impressed.
[03:03:51.604 --> 03:04:07.574]  Well, also, when we look at some of the other issues, as this is starting to break, and over the weekend I think you talked to somebody and they said, hey, what he needs to do is do something about this H-1B visa program and really cut the legs out from underneath some of these people who are opposing him.
[03:04:08.315 --> 03:04:10.937]  And, of course, that's one of the next things that he's going to be doing.
[03:04:11.017 --> 03:04:12.618]  I mean, he knows what he's doing.
[03:04:13.338 --> 03:04:15.139]  We don't necessarily have to tell him what to do.
[03:04:15.179 --> 03:04:20.203]  I mean, it's great for everybody to get together and have a big grassroots push, but he knows what he's doing.
[03:04:20.723 --> 03:04:20.903]  Yeah.
[03:04:21.043 --> 03:04:22.885]  We're calling for stuff and then Trump does it.
[03:04:22.925 --> 03:04:23.906]  We're on the same page.
[03:04:24.106 --> 03:04:24.906]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:24.926 --> 03:04:25.607]  So Trump gets it.
[03:04:26.267 --> 03:04:27.809]  That's why they're really freaked out.
[03:04:28.289 --> 03:04:29.250]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:32.112]  It's good to have a big grassroots push to support him.
[03:04:32.733 --> 03:04:38.397]  And he has the capability and he's using capability to talk directly to the public instead of going through the media and having them filter it.
[03:04:38.797 --> 03:04:40.659]  And so that's been a great thing this last week.
[03:04:40.759 --> 03:04:43.762]  But let's talk about, when we come back, how they're going to counter-strike.
[03:04:44.263 --> 03:04:49.288]  Because they seem crazed, and they've got weird confidence in their eyes.
[03:04:49.308 --> 03:04:51.530]  They're planning some really crazy bad stuff.
[03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:59.919]  And, you know, I just hope they don't push it too far and start a shooting war, because I've never seen such giant sacks of weak puss.
[03:05:07.651 --> 03:05:21.899]  Filmmaker, conservative activist, musician, Bob Dylan expert, who often plays with one of the greatest Dylan tribute bands in the country, Joel Gilbert joins us from Hollywood.
[03:05:21.939 --> 03:05:24.081]  Joel, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:05:24.841 --> 03:05:25.642]  Great to be here, Roger.
[03:05:25.662 --> 03:05:26.302]  You're looking good.
[03:05:26.823 --> 03:05:27.763]  Feeling much better.
[03:05:27.783 --> 03:05:38.171]  Now, having studied this man so carefully, what is your take on Obama, and what is your take on his legacy, and what do you think he's planning to do going forward?
[03:05:38.551 --> 03:05:40.973]  Obama was trained as a professional agitator.
[03:05:41.613 --> 03:05:48.078]  His job was officially community organizer, but that was the official name for community agitator.
[03:05:48.598 --> 03:05:53.702]  And as I showed in my film, the job was, and I'm quoting from their literature, the job was
[03:05:54.202 --> 03:05:59.146]  To rub salt in the wounds of minorities and then use their discontent to take power.
[03:05:59.687 --> 03:06:00.387]  Unquote.
[03:06:00.487 --> 03:06:03.770]  For Marxists like Obama, America is hell.
[03:06:04.691 --> 03:06:09.314]  Because they compare America to the perfect socialist utopia that's unattainable.
[03:06:09.855 --> 03:06:15.419]  So their conclusion is America is therefore evil and must be torn down and rebuilt to make the perfect world.
[03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:18.242]  Conservatives have a different view of the world.
[03:06:18.262 --> 03:06:23.065]  We look at other countries and compare them to America and say, well, America is a society that has
[03:06:23.946 --> 03:06:28.210]  Individual rights, individual liberty, and we can pursue happiness.
[03:06:28.570 --> 03:06:31.533]  So we're happy in America, as opposed to the left who are miserable.
[03:06:32.534 --> 03:06:37.358]  With Hillary out of the way, Joel, Obama is the titular head of the Democratic Party.
[03:06:37.958 --> 03:06:41.181]  Michelle is certainly young enough to run for public office.
[03:06:42.002 --> 03:06:44.864]  Are they secretly planning a comeback?
[03:06:45.185 --> 03:06:47.186]  A restoration, as it were?
[03:06:48.307 --> 03:06:50.968]  Uh, I think we have to be very concerned.
[03:06:51.028 --> 03:06:53.709]  I think Obama remains dangerous.
[03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:58.552]  He was a professional agitator, trained for 10 years.
[03:06:58.592 --> 03:06:59.972]  He was a trainer for Acorn.
[03:07:00.392 --> 03:07:15.439]  I think he was never interested in being president or the presidency, and that's why he went on all these golf vacations, never attended his security briefings, put his feet up on the desk, because he wanted to use the presidency to agitate, not to be president or governor.
[03:07:15.979 --> 03:07:19.660]  And that's what he's done all these years in office, is agitate and divide the country.
[03:07:20.140 --> 03:07:22.441]  So I expect Obama to go back to being who he is.
[03:07:23.341 --> 03:07:29.563]  And his Bonnie and Clyde partner in crime is Michelle Obama, who herself was a radical activist.
[03:07:30.103 --> 03:07:34.725]  A lot of people don't know she grew up in Jesse Jackson's household, good friend of Santita Jackson.
[03:07:35.545 --> 03:07:37.146]  And she was also radicalized.
[03:07:37.186 --> 03:07:48.191]  This is why these two together represent a formidable, stealth, radical couple that pretend to wave the flag and love America.
[03:07:48.231 --> 03:07:50.292]  As I show in my film, there's no place like Utopia.
[03:07:50.712 --> 03:07:59.036]  But they do have a hidden radical agenda that they learned from, you know, Bill Ayers and the Marxist terrorist gang that taught them.
[03:08:25.339 --> 03:08:27.419]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:32.801]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:32.821 --> 03:08:52.165]  You know, it's really become a joke that they want to have open airplane flights from Sudan and from Somalia when within hours of people being on the ground in those countries, especially Somalia, you get kidnapped.
[03:08:53.305 --> 03:08:54.385]  Even if you're a white Muslim.
[03:08:57.389 --> 03:09:00.971]  And Obama already had these in place, he just wasn't enforcing them, which is insane.
[03:09:00.991 --> 03:09:05.293]  Which is why we keep having Somali stab people, shoot people, run them over.
[03:09:06.514 --> 03:09:11.496]  And then the media just has this big, giant pity party, acting like Trump's done all this horrible crap.
[03:09:11.556 --> 03:09:12.577]  I mean, it's crazy.
[03:09:12.617 --> 03:09:13.957]  And then, can we show it?
[03:09:14.978 --> 03:09:15.518]  Let's queue it up.
[03:09:15.558 --> 03:09:16.659]  Chuckie Schumer crying?
[03:09:18.140 --> 03:09:20.381]  Chuck Schumer supports Israel having a big wall.
[03:09:21.417 --> 03:09:27.041]  And he supported Israelis being armed, which is fine with me, but Israel has all sorts of travel restrictions.
[03:09:27.722 --> 03:09:28.803]  And so do most other countries.
[03:09:28.963 --> 03:09:33.746]  Again, they play on Americans' ignorance, and Schumer starts crying.
[03:09:36.248 --> 03:09:39.270]  I mean, this has got to be the most pathetic clip of all time.
[03:09:39.871 --> 03:09:42.893]  The guy is a horrible person.
[03:09:43.894 --> 03:09:50.659]  Involved covering up the Clintons' crimes, involved in globalism, he wants your guns, he wants Obamacare, he's such a horrible person.
[03:09:52.356 --> 03:09:56.858]  And Trump has come out and said that, you know, he needs a better acting coach, that it's totally fake.
[03:09:57.859 --> 03:10:03.242]  Yeah, let's go ahead and show first Schumer, and then we'll show Trump.
[03:10:03.282 --> 03:10:03.662]  Here it is.
[03:10:04.683 --> 03:10:16.649]  This executive order was mean-spirited, un-American.
[03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:18.920]  Man, this is really bad acting.
[03:10:35.043 --> 03:10:41.085]  So, so they hold us hostage just like Khan's dad went on scene this week and I shot a video and he goes, You will cause attacks!
[03:10:41.385 --> 03:10:42.245]  You have done it!
[03:10:42.545 --> 03:10:43.626]  You do not!
[03:10:44.306 --> 03:10:47.307]  Totally intolerant, totally out of control, threatening us.
[03:10:47.907 --> 03:10:48.507]  So what?
[03:10:48.627 --> 03:10:49.348]  Do whatever you're gonna do.
[03:10:49.388 --> 03:10:50.348]  Feel your damn hand.
[03:10:50.428 --> 03:10:52.389]  I am sick of being threatened by people.
[03:10:52.809 --> 03:10:54.029]  Watch your freaking mouth though.
[03:10:54.729 --> 03:10:57.870]  Cause you shoot your mouth off and threaten people, bad stuff's gonna happen.
[03:10:58.771 --> 03:10:59.291]  I mean really.
[03:11:00.311 --> 03:11:02.592]  I don't think you idiots realize the situation you're in.
[03:11:03.683 --> 03:11:05.125]  You take our kindness for weakness.
[03:11:05.145 --> 03:11:08.468]  You have no idea what you're messing around with.
[03:11:08.488 --> 03:11:09.850]  I mean, just look at the West.
[03:11:09.910 --> 03:11:10.771]  Look at everything we've done.
[03:11:11.331 --> 03:11:12.532]  We're ready to go crazy.
[03:11:13.814 --> 03:11:16.437]  I've tried to oppose all these wars because they were setting us up.
[03:11:16.797 --> 03:11:18.979]  Now you think Islam's going to have its way with me and my family?
[03:11:18.999 --> 03:11:19.400]  Never.
[03:11:19.420 --> 03:11:19.720]  Never.
[03:11:22.651 --> 03:11:24.031]  Ally with that creature?
[03:11:24.652 --> 03:11:25.252]  George Soros?
[03:11:25.272 --> 03:11:26.792]  Now here's Trump responding to Schumer.
[03:11:26.832 --> 03:11:29.553]  I mean, Schumer is a fricking joke.
[03:11:29.913 --> 03:11:33.434]  Why is Trump even nice to him when Schumer says he's not a real president and all this crap?
[03:11:33.815 --> 03:11:34.215]  Here it is.
[03:11:35.255 --> 03:11:37.396]  Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears.
[03:11:38.296 --> 03:11:40.076]  I'm going to ask him who is his acting coach.
[03:11:41.177 --> 03:11:42.477]  Because I know him very well.
[03:11:43.538 --> 03:11:44.758]  I don't see him as a crier.
[03:11:46.018 --> 03:11:47.299]  If he is, he's a different man.
[03:11:47.559 --> 03:11:50.940]  There's about a 5% chance that it was real, but I think they were fake tears.
[03:11:52.281 --> 03:11:56.225]  Let me ask you this night, and I've got a few other stories I swore to get to, that's why I'm cutting into your time here.
[03:11:58.187 --> 03:11:58.968]  This is surreal.
[03:11:59.028 --> 03:12:03.152]  I keep using the word surreal, Twilight Zone, Ultra Dimension, Matrix.
[03:12:03.272 --> 03:12:05.635]  I mean, the great things that are happening next to the bad things.
[03:12:06.616 --> 03:12:08.878]  Women with their tops off yelling Allah Akbar.
[03:12:08.998 --> 03:12:10.040]  I mean, it's just...
[03:12:11.403 --> 03:12:12.824]  I guess it's just mental illness.
[03:12:12.904 --> 03:12:24.950]  It's people that have had freedom so long that in some type of mass Stockholm Syndrome, like a toddler throwing a fit, they're begging for an alpha female or male to put them in their place.
[03:12:25.490 --> 03:12:34.395]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I tweeted about Chuckie Schumer crying, and when I started typing it on my phone, it came up, instead of Chuckie, it came up Chickie, and I thought, well, that fits.
[03:12:34.955 --> 03:12:39.258]  I left that there, and I said, keep on crying, and then you really need to show us how sensitive you are.
[03:12:39.878 --> 03:12:47.565]  And make Keith Ellison the new head of the DNC, the guy who was the congressman who refused to take the oath to office on a Bible, said, I'm going to only do it on the Quran.
[03:12:47.605 --> 03:12:49.426]  He is a radical Islamicist.
[03:12:49.587 --> 03:12:56.473]  And go ahead and do that, and we'll watch you lose another 1,000 seats in just the next four years instead of the last eight years.
[03:12:56.893 --> 03:12:58.635]  And I hope they keep going down this path, Alex.
[03:12:59.690 --> 03:13:00.971]  But it's like a mental illness.
[03:13:00.991 --> 03:13:03.433]  Yeah, they lost almost 1,000 seats in legislature.
[03:13:03.453 --> 03:13:04.153]  A little over, yeah.
[03:13:04.393 --> 03:13:05.314]  Which is the real, yeah, almost 1,000.
[03:13:05.354 --> 03:13:06.595]  Which, oh, it was over 1,000.
[03:13:06.875 --> 03:13:07.896]  I saw 900 and something.
[03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:09.457]  And whatever it is, that's great.
[03:13:09.477 --> 03:13:11.338]  So, in fact, I hope you're usually right.
[03:13:11.618 --> 03:13:15.561]  Guys, Google how many House seats or how many legislative seats were lost.
[03:13:16.221 --> 03:13:20.665]  I think it was like 1,030, including gubernatorial seats and that sort of thing.
[03:13:20.725 --> 03:13:21.125]  Oh, sure, sure.
[03:13:21.165 --> 03:13:21.985]  At state level, yeah.
[03:13:22.005 --> 03:13:23.647]  I'm talking about legislator seats.
[03:13:23.727 --> 03:13:23.927]  Right.
[03:13:24.167 --> 03:13:25.348]  And then, yeah, they lost like
[03:13:26.523 --> 03:13:29.627]  Fourteen governors and a bunch of Senate seats and a bunch of House seats.
[03:13:29.647 --> 03:13:30.948]  You're right, it was over a thousand total.
[03:13:31.108 --> 03:13:34.011]  And the governors are way bigger than losing some House seats.
[03:13:34.211 --> 03:13:36.153]  They are just on the ropes.
[03:13:36.173 --> 03:13:39.697]  They've never had less of a presence than they do now.
[03:13:39.797 --> 03:13:42.160]  And it's going to continue to go down that road because you see what they're doing.
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:43.621]  Sure, and they totally bet on race-based politics.
[03:13:43.721 --> 03:13:44.102]  Absolutely.
[03:13:44.162 --> 03:13:45.283]  But what's killing them is...
[03:13:46.224 --> 03:13:51.128]  Minorities that want prosperity who fled tyranny are going, no, I'm not buying this.
[03:13:51.208 --> 03:13:54.570]  It's blacks and Hispanics voting in record numbers that trumped all this.
[03:13:54.971 --> 03:13:58.773]  That's why we've got to deliver and anybody qualified has got to be hired.
[03:13:58.814 --> 03:14:01.135]  We've got to just go out and get dinner together.
[03:14:01.195 --> 03:14:03.197]  We've got to go, you know, go play basketball together.
[03:14:03.217 --> 03:14:04.258]  We've got to go hiking together.
[03:14:04.658 --> 03:14:09.702]  We've got to just really come together like Martin Luther King said and reject all this race-based garbage, David.
[03:14:10.402 --> 03:14:13.786]  Well, you know, Alex, a good example of this, of course, is Starbucks.
[03:14:13.866 --> 03:14:18.891]  The CEO has come out now and said, I'm going to react against this unprecedented move.
[03:14:18.911 --> 03:14:22.014]  And of course, we've been saying all day today, this is not unprecedented.
[03:14:22.314 --> 03:14:23.255]  Jimmy Carter did it.
[03:14:23.335 --> 03:14:24.616]  We had Obama do it.
[03:14:24.676 --> 03:14:25.357]  We had Joe Biden.
[03:14:25.377 --> 03:14:25.697]  That's right.
[03:14:25.757 --> 03:14:27.399]  Jimmy Carter did a total ban.
[03:14:27.739 --> 03:14:28.099]  That's right.
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:29.240]  Let me add this.
[03:14:29.681 --> 03:14:33.244]  What about how Biden wanted Vietnamese banned because they were conservatives?
[03:14:33.264 --> 03:14:34.585]  That's right, that's on Infowars.
[03:14:35.025 --> 03:14:40.430]  Yeah, and then now the Cubans have been totally banned by Obama, so they're having to go to Mexico who deports them.
[03:14:40.450 --> 03:14:46.655]  See, I don't care what color somebody is, a right-wing Vietnamese is a super hard-working, statistically great person you can trust.
[03:14:46.955 --> 03:14:48.096]  Same thing with a right-wing Cuban.
[03:14:48.537 --> 03:14:50.078]  It's not about skin color, is it, David?
[03:14:50.118 --> 03:14:51.199]  It's about their ideology.
[03:14:51.599 --> 03:15:15.348]  It is ideological, Alex, and as I was pointing out on Friday when I talked about these Mexican government officials, last Tuesday, before any of this back and forth happened between the Mexican president and Donald Trump, they were talking about, and this is a former ambassador to the United States, a foreign former minister of Mexico, they were saying, hey, we're going to see if that wall that Donald Trump puts up keeps out the terrorists and the drug cartels, because we won't.
[03:15:15.848 --> 03:15:20.214]  And they said, you know, quoting Rahm Emanuel, say, we're not going to let a crisis go to waste.
[03:15:20.595 --> 03:15:25.402]  The title of the article from the New York Times, because they were working with these globalists, that's the issue there.
[03:15:25.422 --> 03:15:29.668]  It's not Americans versus Mexicans or Anglos versus Mexicans.
[03:15:29.688 --> 03:15:31.490]  It's a globalist versus a nationalist.
[03:15:32.091 --> 03:15:34.372]  And that's what these Mexican officials are.
[03:15:34.412 --> 03:15:40.115]  And they were saying, what weapons can we use against Donald Trump if he goes to war with us over NAFTA?
[03:15:40.155 --> 03:15:46.758]  So if you get out of this globalist structure here, we're going to use weapons like sending terrorists across the border.
[03:15:46.778 --> 03:15:47.439]  We're going to aid them.
[03:15:47.459 --> 03:15:48.960]  And of course, they are doing that already.
[03:15:49.340 --> 03:15:52.381]  They're doing that already with the immigrants who are coming in with... No, they are.
[03:15:52.461 --> 03:15:57.504]  I don't care where you come from, if you're pro-gun, pro-family, they're being brainwashed against that.
[03:15:57.524 --> 03:16:01.246]  In fact, speaking of Jimmy Carter, since you mentioned it, here's Jimmy Carter banning people.
[03:16:01.286 --> 03:16:01.526]  Go ahead.
[03:16:02.316 --> 03:16:04.197]  The President ordered four steps immediately.
[03:16:04.677 --> 03:16:06.498]  A complete break in diplomatic relations.
[03:16:06.718 --> 03:16:09.620]  Iranian diplomats must leave the United States by tomorrow midnight.
[03:16:10.220 --> 03:16:12.661]  Official sanctions prohibiting exports to Iran.
[03:16:13.042 --> 03:16:16.704]  The exporting of even food and medicine is expected to be minimal or non-existent.
[03:16:17.344 --> 03:16:24.848]  An inventory of frozen Iranian assets of over eight billion dollars in this country and steps toward using the money to pay claims of Americans against Iran.
[03:16:25.564 --> 03:16:31.329]  And a virtual shutting off of all Iranian immigration into this country by refusing new visas to Iranian citizens.
[03:16:31.949 --> 03:16:35.692]  Moreover, the President warned these four steps may be just the beginning.
[03:16:36.493 --> 03:16:40.696]  The steps I have ordered today are those that are necessary now.
[03:16:42.017 --> 03:16:51.444]  Other action may become necessary if these steps do not produce the prompt release of the hostages.
[03:16:53.476 --> 03:16:54.497]  We got Obama bombed.
[03:16:54.557 --> 03:16:56.198]  Five of seven countries Trump banned.
[03:16:56.738 --> 03:16:58.179]  Obama banned the same countries.
[03:16:58.539 --> 03:17:01.481]  And the law that was passed, Soros is funding all of this.
[03:17:01.501 --> 03:17:03.442]  David, I'm going to turn this over to you here.
[03:17:05.416 --> 03:17:07.958]  Again, clearly they're trying to stir up insurrection.
[03:17:07.999 --> 03:17:08.979]  They bring in people.
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:10.761]  They don't get them to join the melting pot.
[03:17:10.781 --> 03:17:12.283]  They try to turn them into an outside group.
[03:17:12.823 --> 03:17:20.450]  Listeners and viewers, InfoWars has proven itself to be steadfast and committed and good stewards of your support.
[03:17:20.951 --> 03:17:22.252]  And you've supported us massively.
[03:17:22.292 --> 03:17:25.755]  This is unprecedented, the victories we've had, what we've been able to do.
[03:17:25.835 --> 03:17:27.037]  But we have to go next level.
[03:17:27.697 --> 03:17:30.140]  I must set up bureaus in other major cities.
[03:17:30.180 --> 03:17:32.001]  We must get more reporters and crew members.
[03:17:32.382 --> 03:17:34.063]  We must add more shows.
[03:17:34.604 --> 03:17:37.487]  We must move towards at least 14 hours a day.
[03:17:37.507 --> 03:17:38.888]  I don't want to say 24 hours.
[03:17:39.909 --> 03:17:41.470]  We've got to do this in the face.
[03:17:41.531 --> 03:17:44.614]  We're already hour by hour dominating Fox News.
[03:17:44.694 --> 03:17:47.476]  This show is bigger than Fox News hour by hour.
[03:17:47.777 --> 03:17:48.357]  It's a fact.
[03:17:48.497 --> 03:17:49.578]  Drudge is bigger than them as well.
[03:17:49.939 --> 03:17:51.901]  But we have to recognize that and fulfill it.
[03:17:52.853 --> 03:17:57.187]  If Fox was better than us, I would just not be fighting as hard.
[03:17:57.247 --> 03:17:58.150]  I don't want to do this.
[03:17:59.025 --> 03:18:00.766]  I mean, I was up here Saturday and Sunday.
[03:18:00.846 --> 03:18:03.669]  I mean, I'm up here because wild horses can't drag me away.
[03:18:03.789 --> 03:18:14.537]  We need the financial backing to take care of our great crew who's proven themselves as veterans of the infant war, but to just as importantly hire more people and organize the next phase.
[03:18:14.557 --> 03:18:22.443]  We've learned, we've trained, we understand, we've had victory, we've had defeats, we've had setbacks, we've had leaps forward, we've done it all.
[03:18:23.223 --> 03:18:25.985]  And so we're running specials at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[03:18:26.705 --> 03:18:34.170]  Like 10% off on our great Vitamin B12, 25% off on air purifier systems, Alexa Pure and water filter systems are so key.
[03:18:34.711 --> 03:18:35.551]  And a lot of other specials.
[03:18:35.571 --> 03:18:36.872]  Super Mel Vitality is about to sell out.
[03:18:36.892 --> 03:18:41.175]  We've got Combat One disinfectant spray that's a new development.
[03:18:41.375 --> 03:18:42.356]  Only the Pentagon has it.
[03:18:42.776 --> 03:18:44.457]  Only we have it outside the Pentagon right now.
[03:18:44.918 --> 03:18:48.740]  InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.722]  I want to say that plan more for the show today.
[03:18:51.742 --> 03:18:52.483]  I think I'll give us an A+.
[03:18:53.163 --> 03:18:54.284]  I'm going to hand it over to David now.
[03:18:54.944 --> 03:18:55.925]  Cruz did a great job.
[03:18:55.945 --> 03:18:57.386]  You've done a great job, listeners and viewers.
[03:18:57.726 --> 03:18:59.507]  There's about 40 minutes left here with David Knight.
[03:19:00.568 --> 03:19:03.450]  But I got to over 150 articles today.
[03:19:03.570 --> 03:19:04.831]  I didn't get to another 100 or so.
[03:19:05.311 --> 03:19:09.414]  But I'm going to try to do that on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central with the other co-host.
[03:19:09.774 --> 03:19:12.516]  So David Knight, go over and take over the situation.
[03:19:12.796 --> 03:19:17.419]  But I want to thank the viewers and listeners for their prayers, their support, and just spread the links in the articles.
[03:19:17.759 --> 03:19:19.581]  Because the enemy wants to block us.
[03:19:19.601 --> 03:19:22.363]  They're trying a lot of stuff, but it's not working thanks to you.
[03:19:22.543 --> 03:19:22.903]  David Knight.
[03:19:23.403 --> 03:19:23.984]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:19:24.024 --> 03:19:35.271]  And when we look at this situation and the fact that the liberals are trying to sell this to us as unprecedented, we just played for you the clip of Jimmy Carter saying they were going to freeze assets, they were going to ban Iranians.
[03:19:35.311 --> 03:19:42.136]  And of course, that's what we just saw recently unfrozen, some of those assets that they froze at that time.
[03:19:42.657 --> 03:19:51.343]  When we come back, I'm going to play for you a clip of Bill Clinton, who is talking about doing exactly the same thing.
[03:19:52.433 --> 03:19:58.582]  On and on we see them coming after Donald Trump as if it were the end of the world, and yet it isn't.
[03:19:59.043 --> 03:19:59.964]  It isn't the end of the world.
[03:19:59.984 --> 03:20:01.326]  We're going to talk about the good things he did, too.
[03:20:01.346 --> 03:20:02.127]  He's going to save $600 million, F-35.
[03:20:11.917 --> 03:20:16.720]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[03:20:17.380 --> 03:20:18.961]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[03:20:19.361 --> 03:20:24.344]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[03:20:24.704 --> 03:20:30.148]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[03:20:30.548 --> 03:20:37.152]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[03:20:37.792 --> 03:20:38.933]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[03:20:39.773 --> 03:20:41.734]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[03:20:42.055 --> 03:20:44.996]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[03:20:45.437 --> 03:20:49.059]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[03:20:49.259 --> 03:20:51.821]  It is the base to so many things.
[03:20:51.881 --> 03:21:04.209]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:09.531]  Other iodine comes from the ocean, or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[03:21:09.651 --> 03:21:10.992]  It's bound.
[03:21:11.052 --> 03:21:12.272]  It's not absorbable.
[03:21:12.692 --> 03:21:13.112]  I tried it.
[03:21:13.713 --> 03:21:17.254]  And I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[03:21:17.474 --> 03:21:22.376]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[03:21:22.736 --> 03:21:26.458]  It's such a game changer, if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[03:21:26.638 --> 03:21:29.199]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest, back in the 20s,
[03:21:29.739 --> 03:21:38.724]  mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[03:21:38.884 --> 03:21:42.546]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[03:21:42.706 --> 03:21:56.154]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[03:21:56.354 --> 03:22:07.903]  That's why, for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[03:22:08.144 --> 03:22:10.766]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:22:11.006 --> 03:22:13.948]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[03:22:14.369 --> 03:22:19.253]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[03:22:19.353 --> 03:22:20.494]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[03:22:20.674 --> 03:22:23.236]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[03:22:23.376 --> 03:22:24.556]  I don't think so.
[03:22:46.223 --> 03:22:48.865]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[03:22:48.885 --> 03:22:49.906]  You've got to have water to live.
[03:22:50.246 --> 03:22:50.967]  Iodine is key.
[03:22:50.987 --> 03:22:51.587]  You must have it.
[03:22:51.948 --> 03:22:59.514]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.

[03:23:01.996 --> 03:23:09.402]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:23:11.803 --> 03:23:18.227]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:23:18.627 --> 03:23:24.610]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:23:24.750 --> 03:23:27.892]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:23:28.032 --> 03:23:29.493]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:23:29.693 --> 03:23:33.837]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:23:34.037 --> 03:23:36.900]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:38.541]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:23:38.641 --> 03:23:41.824]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:23:42.104 --> 03:23:44.427]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:23:44.707 --> 03:23:45.668]  It's in powder form.
[03:23:45.768 --> 03:23:48.470]  We have so many five-star reviews.

[03:24:18.783 --> 03:24:20.045]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:20.085 --> 03:24:33.624]  I'm David Knight and we're going to talk a little bit about the hypocrisy that we see of these Silicon Valley billionaires and others, and I would include Starbucks as part of that because they really do market towards, they're not Silicon Valley, but
[03:24:34.605 --> 03:24:39.686]  The same type of mindset that we see from these multinational corporations.
[03:24:40.226 --> 03:24:45.688]  And remember that it was Angela Merkel who this last weekend called out Starbucks over their unfair practices.
[03:24:46.168 --> 03:24:52.429]  She said unfair tax advantages for multinational corporations are the things she was talking to the German people about.
[03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:54.890]  And she singled out Starbucks as the example.
[03:24:54.930 --> 03:24:58.611]  She said many companies have managed to pay taxes nowhere in the world.
[03:24:58.991 --> 03:25:02.692]  She said coffee house operators in Germany have to pay their taxes
[03:25:03.112 --> 03:25:07.258]  Well, it's not at all clear with Starbucks whether they pay taxes anywhere.
[03:25:07.878 --> 03:25:08.419]  Anywhere.
[03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:09.380]  See?
[03:25:09.741 --> 03:25:10.522]  It's a shell game.
[03:25:11.363 --> 03:25:11.904]  That's what they do.
[03:25:11.944 --> 03:25:14.006]  That's what these multinational corporations do.
[03:25:14.046 --> 03:25:16.169]  That's why I include them in with Silicon Valley.
[03:25:16.470 --> 03:25:20.074]  And yet, at the same time, we have the CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz.
[03:25:21.161 --> 03:25:27.325]  Sending a letter to his employees and say, I write to you today with deep concern, with a heavy heart, with a resolute promise.
[03:25:27.966 --> 03:25:30.268]  Let me begin with the news that is immediately in front of us.
[03:25:30.448 --> 03:25:35.932]  We've all been witness to the confusion, the surprise and the opposition to the executive order from President Trump and so forth.
[03:25:36.072 --> 03:25:36.352]  Okay.
[03:25:36.712 --> 03:25:44.438]  And he says we're living in an unprecedented time where we're witness to the conscience of our country and the promise of the American dream being called into question.
[03:25:45.179 --> 03:25:45.579]  Well, you know what?
[03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:52.324]  People like Starbucks' CEO have been calling into question the American Dream for a long time.
[03:25:52.344 --> 03:25:55.766]  And let me tell you that part of the American Dream has always been what?
[03:25:55.986 --> 03:25:56.847]  Owning your own home!
[03:25:56.887 --> 03:25:59.189]  That was the core part of the American Dream.
[03:26:00.289 --> 03:26:00.950]  Owning your own home.
[03:26:01.370 --> 03:26:02.271]  Starting your own business.
[03:26:02.731 --> 03:26:07.074]  Well, Washington has regulated the starting your own business aspect of it pretty much to death.
[03:26:07.795 --> 03:26:10.076]  And that's what Donald Trump pushed back against today.
[03:26:10.096 --> 03:26:11.257]  We're going to talk about that a little bit.
[03:26:11.757 --> 03:26:13.719]  But I want to talk about the American Dream of owning a home.
[03:26:14.813 --> 03:26:26.884]  If people can come here, at will, from anywhere in the world, and we have to educate their children for free, at our expense, paid for by our property taxes, in the language of their choice,
[03:26:27.861 --> 03:26:28.942]  Do you think you can own your home?
[03:26:29.542 --> 03:26:35.225]  Do you think that you're going to lose that American dream because of dreamers coming here demanding benefits from you?
[03:26:36.105 --> 03:26:41.728]  And of course there's a back and forth, there's a vision going on right now, a debate within the Trump administration.
[03:26:42.688 --> 03:26:47.011]  There's an article from Reuters saying Trump aides are divided over the policies of shielding dreamer
[03:26:47.791 --> 03:26:48.251]  Immigrants.
[03:26:48.992 --> 03:27:07.247]  And I have to say, I hope that the people who are saying we're not going to shield them went out, because I'm quite frankly sick and tired of seeing the American dream only being a dream that people who are foreign citizens in other countries, who decide that they would rather live in our country, that's the only dream that matters.
[03:27:07.627 --> 03:27:15.673]  People who live here, people whose families have created this country, people who have paid taxes all their life, our dreams don't matter.
[03:27:16.533 --> 03:27:20.154]  We need to take a back seat in the bus to these people that they're bringing in here.
[03:27:20.414 --> 03:27:21.714]  You understand what this is.
[03:27:22.634 --> 03:27:25.055]  This is a people replacement program.
[03:27:25.455 --> 03:27:31.016]  It is ideologically based, and we understand exactly what this is, and we ought to shut this down.
[03:27:31.076 --> 03:27:35.157]  These people who are dreamers, of course, that are getting preferred treatment, that's up to the age of 31. 31.
[03:27:38.118 --> 03:27:40.179]  So, let's understand what's going to happen with that.
[03:27:40.700 --> 03:27:48.824]  So, you've got this guy who pays taxes nowhere, and now he says he's going to bring in and hire 10,000 refugees for Starbucks over the next five years.
[03:27:48.844 --> 03:27:49.184]  You know what?
[03:27:49.285 --> 03:27:49.745]  I'm done.
[03:27:49.765 --> 03:27:54.167]  I'm not going to buy anything from Starbucks, not even the little stuff that they sell in the grocery store.
[03:27:54.608 --> 03:27:59.791]  That's been my only involvement with them for quite some time because of other things that corporations have done.
[03:28:00.231 --> 03:28:05.154]  When I saw this article, I called my wife and I said, don't ever buy any of that stuff from the grocery store again.
[03:28:06.134 --> 03:28:08.815]  We're not going to send a penny to Starbucks.
[03:28:09.555 --> 03:28:12.236]  And I think people need to start supporting local businesses.
[03:28:12.256 --> 03:28:12.597]  You know what?
[03:28:12.917 --> 03:28:17.918]  We don't need multinational corporations and we don't need multinational workforces either shoved down our throats.
[03:28:18.279 --> 03:28:20.499]  We can do just fine here in America.
[03:28:20.940 --> 03:28:25.901]  One of the things that Donald Trump did today, of course, was he announced the savings of $600 million.
[03:28:27.922 --> 03:28:34.248]  From the F-35 program, that's over the next lot of 90 Joint Strike Fighter planes.
[03:28:34.849 --> 03:28:38.593]  See, that's the kind of stuff that you ought to see the Democrats applauding him for, right?
[03:28:39.233 --> 03:28:44.959]  Look at this, he saved some money on these Pentagon programs that they're always complaining about, and they should!
[03:28:46.049 --> 03:28:54.011]  But they don't give him credit, just like they don't give him credit for shutting down NAFTA, for shutting down the TPP, even though their base wants that.
[03:28:54.211 --> 03:28:55.671]  And of course, that's all politics.
[03:28:56.412 --> 03:28:58.912]  They don't want to lose their base to Donald Trump, but guess what?
[03:28:59.472 --> 03:29:03.013]  They've already lost their base to Donald Trump and they're going further into it.
[03:29:03.073 --> 03:29:05.594]  They absolutely have nothing but contempt
[03:29:06.354 --> 03:29:09.555]  For the working class Americans, and you can see it in West Virginia.
[03:29:09.595 --> 03:29:16.218]  It's interesting to watch on CNN how Joe Manchin, the senator from West Virginia, dances around when he gets on CNN.
[03:29:16.258 --> 03:29:19.639]  They try to get him to criticize Donald Trump, and he walks on eggshells.
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:20.500]  Why?
[03:29:21.516 --> 03:29:32.601]  Because the West Virginians have been at the forefront of the globalist shills like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama promising to bankrupt them, promising to take their jobs, and making good on that promise.
[03:29:32.641 --> 03:29:35.162]  That's one promise that they did make good on.
[03:29:35.202 --> 03:29:37.623]  But Donald Trump is making good on a lot of promises.
[03:29:37.883 --> 03:29:38.704]  We're going to take a look.
[03:29:39.344 --> 03:29:45.548]  At Bill Clinton and his speech saying that he was going to do exactly what Donald Trump did this last week.
[03:29:45.568 --> 03:29:47.169]  They want to talk about this being unprecedented?
[03:29:47.229 --> 03:29:47.710]  No it's not.
[03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:49.551]  And we're also going to talk about what's coming up.
[03:29:49.631 --> 03:29:53.333]  Tomorrow is going to be a Supreme Court pick from Donald Trump.
[03:29:53.833 --> 03:29:55.434]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.375 --> 03:29:59.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.112 --> 03:30:05.694]  New video on InfoWars.com!
[03:30:33.392 --> 03:30:42.078]  I went to the March for Life in Austin wearing my Make America Great Again gear and I experienced zero negativity for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male.
[03:30:42.218 --> 03:30:49.663]  When I put the marchers and their signs on camera, they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language.
[03:30:49.823 --> 03:30:56.747]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones, I challenge you to take to the streets with Make America Great Again gear on.
[03:30:56.927 --> 03:30:59.769]  You will experience more hate than you ever have in your life.
[03:30:59.969 --> 03:31:02.291]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:03.752 --> 03:31:09.899]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:31:10.460 --> 03:31:11.881]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:31:12.782 --> 03:31:14.643]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:31:15.264 --> 03:31:20.828]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:31:21.409 --> 03:31:29.395]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:31:29.415 --> 03:31:31.877]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:31:32.177 --> 03:31:33.378]  This is the best system out there.
[03:31:33.638 --> 03:31:36.400]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:31:36.660 --> 03:31:37.401]  This is how it works.
[03:31:37.701 --> 03:31:38.202]  You order.
[03:31:38.342 --> 03:31:39.122]  Customized or
[03:31:40.203 --> 03:31:41.684]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:31:42.164 --> 03:31:45.306]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:31:45.627 --> 03:31:49.669]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:31:49.889 --> 03:31:50.670]  You cannot lose.
[03:31:50.690 --> 03:31:51.811]  You're funding the Infowar.

[03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:25.594]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.834 --> 03:33:32.717]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:32.817 --> 03:33:38.819]  We're going to take a look at something that's really going to get the left and Silicon Valley upset that's coming up.
[03:33:39.540 --> 03:33:44.382]  That's going to be Trump's move against the H-1B visa program and the abuses within that.
[03:33:45.421 --> 03:33:51.045]  We understand that we need to have people like Einstein be able to come into the country.
[03:33:51.585 --> 03:33:52.846]  We need people like Albert Einstein.
[03:33:52.866 --> 03:33:53.286]  But you know what?
[03:33:53.306 --> 03:33:56.068]  There's not that many Albert Einsteins that need to come into the country.
[03:33:57.031 --> 03:34:01.955]  And of course, you remember how the H-1B visa program has been abused, or programs like it.
[03:34:02.715 --> 03:34:06.218]  There's a slight variation on that for the service industry.
[03:34:06.238 --> 03:34:20.108]  And we've all seen that story about what Walt Disney World did to the information workers there, telling them that they're going to have to train their replacements who are coming in from India, going to work at a fraction of the price, and then they're going to be let go.
[03:34:21.044 --> 03:34:22.004]  That needs to stop.
[03:34:22.684 --> 03:34:23.625]  That really needs to stop.
[03:34:24.125 --> 03:34:33.127]  And I have to say that even when it comes to engineering, when it comes to STEM, you don't have to have as many people as we've got coming in.
[03:34:33.347 --> 03:34:34.627]  There's people in this country that can do it.
[03:34:34.647 --> 03:34:39.028]  Especially if you want to get more American engineers, get rid of Common Core in the school.
[03:34:39.348 --> 03:34:39.929]  How about that?
[03:34:40.829 --> 03:34:43.389]  That's the thing that's turning people off from math.
[03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:49.751]  I almost didn't get into engineering myself because I hated the new math and it wasn't nearly as bad as Common Core is today.
[03:34:51.165 --> 03:34:53.867]  It's designed to make people blithering idiots.
[03:34:54.087 --> 03:34:56.589]  Not only illiterate, but innumerate as well.
[03:34:56.649 --> 03:34:58.030]  That's what Common Core is designed to do.
[03:34:58.190 --> 03:35:03.353]  You know the way I got through engineering when I didn't take these classes early on?
[03:35:04.114 --> 03:35:09.517]  I found a trig book from the Naval Academy in the 1950s.
[03:35:11.482 --> 03:35:14.505]  And it was loaded with very interesting problems to solve.
[03:35:15.206 --> 03:35:18.550]  And using real trigonometry, spherical trigonometry, that's how I got through.
[03:35:19.210 --> 03:35:21.953]  That got me started on calculus and everything.
[03:35:22.094 --> 03:35:26.298]  I absolutely did not want to go near a math book until I found that.
[03:35:27.319 --> 03:35:31.520]  And so parents, if you're teaching your kids, pay attention to their curriculum.
[03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:34.120]  Get some stuff that's real for them.
[03:35:34.601 --> 03:35:35.501]  That makes it all real.
[03:35:35.681 --> 03:35:36.561]  That brings it to home.
[03:35:37.181 --> 03:35:37.901]  That's the key thing.
[03:35:38.101 --> 03:35:44.703]  We don't need to bring people in from other countries if we don't turn them off from education in our own country.
[03:35:45.503 --> 03:35:48.703]  Remember that education is not filling a bucket, but it's lighting a fire.
[03:35:48.723 --> 03:35:51.264]  And the way that you do that is to make this stuff relevant to people.
[03:35:52.003 --> 03:35:53.643]  And that's the biggest problem that we've got here.
[03:35:53.683 --> 03:35:58.625]  But of course, we've seen a lot of abuses with H-1B visas.
[03:35:58.885 --> 03:36:01.165]  And Trump is going to be moving on that.
[03:36:01.185 --> 03:36:05.826]  They've already drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the work visa program.
[03:36:06.566 --> 03:36:18.109]  And of course, they come in and say, as part of this article from Bloomberg, they say, the top recipients of the H-1B visas are outsourcers primarily from India who run the technology departments of large corporations with largely imported staff.
[03:36:18.897 --> 03:36:20.839]  And we've seen how that works at Disney, haven't we?
[03:36:21.460 --> 03:36:23.001]  So, we don't need to have more of that.
[03:36:23.061 --> 03:36:27.085]  We don't need to have 10,000 refugees hired by Starbucks in the next five years.
[03:36:27.105 --> 03:36:34.152]  There's plenty of people who would be willing to work who are Americans, who would work at Starbucks, who would work at Disney.
[03:36:34.972 --> 03:36:36.794]  It isn't like Americans don't want jobs.
[03:36:36.994 --> 03:36:42.499]  We've seen that our younger generation, the Millennials, have gone
[03:36:43.956 --> 03:36:47.599]  through a situation where they don't know what it's like to have early work experience.
[03:36:47.619 --> 03:36:50.582]  There's a lot to be learned from menial jobs.
[03:36:50.602 --> 03:36:53.585]  You weren't meant to stay in low-wage jobs all your life.
[03:36:53.625 --> 03:36:55.266]  So I don't want to belabor that.
[03:36:55.306 --> 03:36:56.748]  I want to get to the Clinton
[03:36:58.002 --> 03:37:06.350]  I'm going to play that in just one second, but before I do that, I want to remind you that we're going to be running out very soon out of Supermail Vitality at Infowarslife.com.
[03:37:06.931 --> 03:37:10.014]  We've had specials on these and our stock is getting low on it.
[03:37:10.034 --> 03:37:13.818]  Of course, if you want to make sure that you don't run out of something, you can always sign up for AutoShip.
[03:37:14.378 --> 03:37:17.962]  You can get 10% off of everything that you order on AutoShip.
[03:37:18.102 --> 03:37:21.165]  If you order $50 or more, you will get free shipping.
[03:37:21.185 --> 03:37:25.490]  You pick the interval, and we'll make sure that you get the product that it never runs out.
[03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:27.732]  But right now, Supermail Vitality is about to be sold out.
[03:37:28.173 --> 03:37:29.614]  Also ending soon is our 25% off sale.
[03:37:31.576 --> 03:37:32.236]  We're good to go.
[03:37:54.065 --> 03:37:56.867]  This is a great way to take B12.
[03:37:57.127 --> 03:37:58.548]  You don't have to take an injection.
[03:37:58.688 --> 03:38:00.449]  You just put it right under your tongue and swallow.
[03:38:00.489 --> 03:38:01.270]  It's great tasting.
[03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:02.650]  It boosts your energy.
[03:38:03.191 --> 03:38:04.371]  And this stuff really works.
[03:38:04.492 --> 03:38:06.873]  I take it on a daily basis myself.
[03:38:06.973 --> 03:38:10.895]  So again, you can get that at 10% off at Secret 12 or Vitamin B12.
[03:38:11.436 --> 03:38:11.996]  Let's play.
[03:38:12.056 --> 03:38:14.378]  We played earlier when Alex was still on.
[03:38:14.418 --> 03:38:19.181]  We played the clip from Jimmy Carter banning Iranians freezing their assets.
[03:38:20.339 --> 03:38:27.341]  Let's play this clip from Bill Clinton talking about his plan to deport illegals.
[03:38:27.521 --> 03:38:28.282]  Here's Bill Clinton.
[03:38:28.982 --> 03:38:39.825]  All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[03:38:40.826 --> 03:38:44.107]  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.
[03:38:44.367 --> 03:38:44.927]  What were you just saying?
[03:38:44.967 --> 03:38:47.768]  The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers.
[03:38:48.308 --> 03:38:48.528]  Yeah.
[03:38:48.789 --> 03:39:04.086]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
[03:39:04.767 --> 03:39:07.510]  In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more.
[03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:18.918]  To speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the work place, as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
[03:39:19.679 --> 03:39:23.922]  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.
[03:39:24.602 --> 03:39:36.071]  It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
[03:39:37.589 --> 03:39:39.691]  And the Democrats applaud.
[03:39:40.772 --> 03:39:41.893]  Because he's a Democrat.
[03:39:41.933 --> 03:39:43.115]  Because it's who said that.
[03:39:43.135 --> 03:39:43.695]  Did you hear that?
[03:39:44.516 --> 03:39:51.443]  He said, we have a nation of law... They can't even bring themselves to call foreign citizens who are here in defiance of our laws.
[03:39:51.843 --> 03:39:55.227]  They can't even bring themselves to say that they're here illegally anymore.
[03:39:55.387 --> 03:39:57.028]  They're just simply undocumented.
[03:39:57.048 --> 03:40:00.252]  And we're going to work on those documentations to make sure that they're going to stay.
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:02.120]  That was Bill Clinton.
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:04.261]  And of course we played Jimmy Carter.
[03:40:04.701 --> 03:40:14.563]  And of course we've talked today about how Barack Obama in December 2015 signed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act.
[03:40:15.063 --> 03:40:17.524]  The Terrorist Travel Prevention Act.
[03:40:18.384 --> 03:40:28.326]  You see, if you bring in a million immigrants from an area where there's a lot of terrorist activity, Somalia is a good example.
[03:40:29.721 --> 03:40:29.941]  We're good
[03:40:51.971 --> 03:40:53.032]  To have a terrorist event.
[03:40:53.312 --> 03:41:01.117]  You know, one of the things that I tweeted out over the weekend when this was going on was I said, oh, okay, seven nations is equivalent to a Muslim ban?
[03:41:01.137 --> 03:41:02.717]  No, not at all.
[03:41:02.738 --> 03:41:06.860]  But let's point out, let's take a look at a few cities here, okay?
[03:41:06.880 --> 03:41:09.542]  Let's look at seven cities in just the last year.
[03:41:10.262 --> 03:41:10.902]  In just Europe.
[03:41:11.362 --> 03:41:13.864]  Predominantly Germany and France.
[03:41:14.564 --> 03:41:16.004]  You had a Brussels bombing.
[03:41:16.685 --> 03:41:19.626]  You had a truck attack in Nice.
[03:41:20.246 --> 03:41:21.807]  You had a stabbing in Munich.
[03:41:22.167 --> 03:41:25.048]  You had another truck attack in Berlin, the Christmas market.
[03:41:25.508 --> 03:41:27.109]  You had another bombing in Ansbach.
[03:41:27.149 --> 03:41:28.870]  You had another stabbing in Normandy.
[03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:33.932]  And that's not even counting the two big shootings in Paris that happened a little over a year ago.
[03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:37.250]  We can't take a look at that?
[03:41:37.290 --> 03:41:40.791]  See, they talk about this as... I've heard this liberal meme.
[03:41:41.512 --> 03:41:44.912]  How many people... This is statistically insignificant.
[03:41:45.793 --> 03:41:54.615]  Well, it is not insignificant if you're one of the 80-some-odd people who's run down by a truck and niece.
[03:41:55.275 --> 03:41:56.215]  Or if you're their family.
[03:41:56.296 --> 03:42:02.757]  It is not statistically insignificant for those families, for those victims of those terrorist attacks.
[03:42:04.058 --> 03:42:05.238]  And what are we doing to vet it?
[03:42:06.124 --> 03:42:12.589]  As I pointed out on Friday, as Alex pointed out earlier today, the United Nations is doing the vetting and sending these people in.
[03:42:13.369 --> 03:42:19.974]  On Friday, I talked about the fact that there was just under 2,000 people had been sent in by the United Nations.
[03:42:20.134 --> 03:42:23.416]  They declared they were refugees and they sent them into our country.
[03:42:23.436 --> 03:42:25.198]  They determined who was going to come into our country.
[03:42:26.098 --> 03:42:33.844]  During the one week that Donald Trump had been president, just under 2,000 came in before he enacted this order.
[03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:37.602]  People were saying, we've got to stop this, right?
[03:42:37.942 --> 03:42:38.922]  Why doesn't he do something?
[03:42:38.942 --> 03:42:41.784]  And he did something about that later that day, later on Friday.
[03:42:41.804 --> 03:42:46.187]  And then, of course, they freak out as if this is something that had never happened before.
[03:42:46.247 --> 03:42:54.172]  The story that we have on Infowars.com where they talk about the South Vietnamese refugees that were pushed back, that were opposed by Joe Biden, they were opposed by Jerry Brown.
[03:42:54.972 --> 03:43:05.316]  And of course, what Jerry Brown said at the time, he said, there's something strange about saying, let's bring in 500,000 when we can't take care of 1 million unemployed in California.
[03:43:05.336 --> 03:43:07.257]  That's what Jerry Brown said at the time.
[03:43:08.437 --> 03:43:13.019]  But if we say that, we're racist, we're xenophobic.
[03:43:14.974 --> 03:43:15.755]  But he can say that.
[03:43:16.475 --> 03:43:17.636]  And they opposed it at the time.
[03:43:17.716 --> 03:43:21.240]  And again, as Alex pointed out, it is largely political.
[03:43:21.300 --> 03:43:23.562]  They don't want the conservative Vietnamese coming in.
[03:43:23.582 --> 03:43:25.584]  They don't want the conservative Cubans coming in.
[03:43:26.383 --> 03:43:30.126]  They want people that are going to come in that are going to be Democrat voters.
[03:43:30.286 --> 03:43:31.367]  And so that's a big part of it.
[03:43:32.068 --> 03:43:35.150]  But remember that it was not once but twice that Obama did this.
[03:43:35.251 --> 03:43:39.254]  He signed the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act in December of 2015.
[03:43:39.294 --> 03:43:41.135]  He restricted access to citizens from 38 countries.
[03:43:46.246 --> 03:43:51.253]  And then they also enacted restrictions on Iran, Syria, Sudan, Iraq.
[03:43:51.693 --> 03:43:54.557]  Then in February of 2016, not even a year ago.
[03:43:54.697 --> 03:43:56.359]  What a short memory these people have.
[03:43:56.994 --> 03:44:05.902]  The Obama administration added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen to the list of countries one could not have visited, but still allowed dual citizens of those countries to come in.
[03:44:05.942 --> 03:44:10.126]  But dual citizens of Syria, Sudan, Iraq, Iran were still ineligible.
[03:44:10.726 --> 03:44:15.030]  Trump was barring immigration from that same list of countries.
[03:44:15.871 --> 03:44:17.132]  And then in a separate incident,
[03:44:18.112 --> 03:44:24.756]  Obama and the Clinton State Department took a six-month hiatus from processing Iraqi refugees in 2011.
[03:44:25.257 --> 03:44:26.618]  Do you understand that?
[03:44:27.178 --> 03:44:28.599]  Twice from Obama.
[03:44:29.139 --> 03:44:40.147]  December of 2015, then he increased the list in February of 2016, and then Obama and Hillary, back in 2011, blocked people coming in from Iraqi.
[03:44:40.187 --> 03:44:44.710]  Did anybody say that they were racist, xenophobic,
[03:44:45.450 --> 03:44:46.611]  That it was a Muslim ban?
[03:44:46.871 --> 03:44:47.852]  No, they didn't do that.
[03:44:49.013 --> 03:45:04.706]  And I gotta say, when we talk about Somalia, I have a personal anecdote here of a missionary that I knew, who had told me at the time that he was in Somalia, just before the events that are recorded in Blackhawk Down, and he said it was unbelievably violent.
[03:45:05.346 --> 03:45:10.570]  He said, even as a missionary, you never went anywhere without an AK-47.
[03:45:11.932 --> 03:45:14.594]  And he was not there to wage war on anybody.
[03:45:15.325 --> 03:45:19.847]  He was there to try to protect other people and of course protect himself so he could protect other people.
[03:45:21.028 --> 03:45:24.530]  But you didn't go anywhere in that country without an AK-47.
[03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:25.270]  So what do we do?
[03:45:25.290 --> 03:45:27.892]  We bring in people from the most violent areas.
[03:45:29.613 --> 03:45:43.200]  And again, before I get off of this and get on to some other news, when I look at this, and we have these nations that Barack Obama is bombing, but then he wants to bring the people in at the same time.
[03:45:43.260 --> 03:45:44.241]  And so you have to say, well,
[03:45:45.259 --> 03:45:52.685]  If these nations have so many bad people in them that we need to bomb them, why are we bringing the people in?
[03:45:52.705 --> 03:45:57.609]  Do you see that conflict, that cognitive dissonance there?
[03:45:58.330 --> 03:46:06.797]  That at the same time we're supposed to embrace all these people and bring as many of them in as wish to come and we have no way to vet them.
[03:46:07.618 --> 03:46:09.359]  They're dangerous enough that we need to bomb them.
[03:46:09.419 --> 03:46:12.202]  And I have to say that you need to stop one or the other.
[03:46:12.242 --> 03:46:13.403]  Maybe we just stop both of them.
[03:46:13.743 --> 03:46:21.450]  Maybe we stop the bombing and we let the people live their lives in their countries and send them some aid to help them for what we did.
[03:46:21.470 --> 03:46:23.492]  I think we bear some responsibility for that.
[03:46:23.512 --> 03:46:28.617]  I'm not in general supportive of foreign aid because I believe that it makes dependents.
[03:46:29.678 --> 03:46:31.239]  It makes people dependent upon us.
[03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:34.862]  Just like I don't support a universal basic income from Americans.
[03:46:35.122 --> 03:46:38.724]  I don't support that type of... Welfare always destroys people.
[03:46:38.764 --> 03:46:55.634]  But in a situation where you go in and you, because you wanted regime change, start bombing and destroying people's lives and unleashing drone attacks on them, creating a civil war using ISIS and Al-Qaeda as your surrogates, I think that you do owe something to those people.
[03:46:55.834 --> 03:46:57.895]  The first thing you owe them is to stop doing it.
[03:46:58.415 --> 03:47:00.737]  Why don't the liberals focus on that?
[03:47:01.977 --> 03:47:11.104]  Why don't the people who are screaming about Donald Trump, not bringing in refugees from the places at war, why don't they focus on stopping the war?
[03:47:11.945 --> 03:47:13.346]  What is the matter with you people?
[03:47:14.066 --> 03:47:15.728]  It used to be the left didn't like war.
[03:47:16.448 --> 03:47:17.549]  Now they embrace it.
[03:47:17.989 --> 03:47:18.890]  Now they cheer it.
[03:47:19.431 --> 03:47:21.052]  Now they want a Cold War with Russia.
[03:47:21.452 --> 03:47:23.354]  Now they want regime change in Syria.
[03:47:23.714 --> 03:47:28.838]  Now they criticize people like Tulsi Gabbard who goes to Syria and meets with the other side.
[03:47:30.051 --> 03:47:32.592]  She comes back and she says there's no moderate rebels over there.
[03:47:32.632 --> 03:47:33.232]  Absolutely!
[03:47:33.772 --> 03:47:34.592]  She's telling the truth.
[03:47:35.192 --> 03:47:37.052]  And the liberals are furious at her.
[03:47:37.893 --> 03:47:38.453]  Don't say that.
[03:47:38.493 --> 03:47:39.093]  We want a war.
[03:47:40.453 --> 03:47:43.634]  And of course, if you don't want a war, you're a Russian agent.
[03:47:44.974 --> 03:47:47.195]  This is the insanity that has become the left.
[03:47:47.795 --> 03:47:52.176]  The very first thing that all of these liberals ought to be talking about is stopping the war.
[03:47:52.496 --> 03:47:53.596]  Stopping the killing.
[03:47:53.856 --> 03:47:58.137]  I am so sick and tired of liberals posting the picture of the Aleppo boy.
[03:47:59.028 --> 03:48:01.510]  You realize who started the war?
[03:48:01.710 --> 03:48:02.051]  It's us!
[03:48:02.431 --> 03:48:08.577]  Why don't you focus on stopping the war instead of bringing all of these surviving children into the United States?
[03:48:08.597 --> 03:48:09.598]  Why don't you just stop it?
[03:48:10.298 --> 03:48:11.199]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:48:11.239 --> 03:48:14.822]  And when Alex said, you know, what is going to come with this?
[03:48:15.203 --> 03:48:16.464]  What is the real concern?
[03:48:17.024 --> 03:48:20.007]  Of course, the real concern, and Donald Trump said it, it really outraged him.
[03:48:20.047 --> 03:48:23.870]  He said, I think John McCain and Lindsey Graham are trying to start World War III.
[03:48:24.271 --> 03:48:25.272]  Yes, of course they are!
[03:48:26.271 --> 03:48:27.872]  We've been telling you that for a long time.
[03:48:28.472 --> 03:48:33.875]  We've been telling you that they are aiding, abetting, creating funding, training, everything else.
[03:48:34.175 --> 03:48:39.738]  ISIS and Al Qaeda, they called them the Mujahideen back when it was done by Ronald Reagan.
[03:48:39.778 --> 03:48:40.798]  We understand what this is.
[03:48:40.858 --> 03:48:42.359]  It's been going on for decades.
[03:48:42.419 --> 03:48:43.380]  It's not anything new.
[03:48:44.260 --> 03:48:47.822]  They were trying to get us to act as Al Qaeda's air force in Syria and we wouldn't have it.
[03:48:48.302 --> 03:48:48.942]  We stopped that.
[03:48:49.943 --> 03:48:51.284]  InfoWars is a big part of that.
[03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:55.646]  And so when we look at what they're trying to do, even Mikhail Gorbachev,
[03:48:56.380 --> 03:49:24.190]  has said it looks like we're gearing up for world war courses solution was to have the united nations come in and impose a peace on people know that's not the solution and of course he's a a big government status but he doesn't want to see this happen because it's a russian people who know what it's like to be at war more so than american people american people have become very soft uh... very distant they haven't had a war on their soil for a very long time uh... we fortunately did not have
[03:49:25.503 --> 03:49:32.868]  During World War II, much bloodshed on American soil outside of Pearl Harbor, but the Russians had it in spades.
[03:49:33.708 --> 03:49:38.971]  That's why they are so excited about the fact that we could have a de-escalation of tensions.
[03:49:40.212 --> 03:49:50.599]  And I just, quite frankly, don't understand why the liberals, and it just goes to show how dishonest they are and how controlled they are by George Soros.
[03:49:51.279 --> 03:49:53.801]  That's the true issue here.
[03:49:54.827 --> 03:49:59.869]  They've become mindless puppets of George Soros who wants to set the world on fire.
[03:50:00.989 --> 03:50:03.570]  So it doesn't even occur to them to try to stop the wars.
[03:50:04.010 --> 03:50:07.291]  No, we just need to keep bombing them and bringing the refugees into America.
[03:50:07.991 --> 03:50:09.432]  How do you get past that?
[03:50:09.472 --> 03:50:16.234]  Meanwhile, in more hypocrisy, we see this story, it just keeps escalating, with Mark Zuckerberg and the Hawaiians.
[03:50:16.694 --> 03:50:23.056]  He goes and he buys, spends $100 million to get 700 acres of beachfront land in Hawaii.
[03:50:23.740 --> 03:50:31.743]  And then he decides that he's going to lock out the Hawaiians who have a legacy of land there.
[03:50:31.783 --> 03:50:36.324]  They have an act going back to 1850 which allows native people to own the land they once lived on.
[03:50:36.384 --> 03:50:43.987]  And so they've got not only a wall, but he's using his armed guards and security people to intimidate them.
[03:50:44.867 --> 03:50:47.969]  They said, they told me I was on private property, threatening to take my picture.
[03:50:48.009 --> 03:50:49.090]  They were threatening to arrest me.
[03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.750]  They were aggressive.
[03:50:49.770 --> 03:50:50.191]  They were rude.
[03:50:50.211 --> 03:50:51.211]  They were disrespectful.
[03:50:52.152 --> 03:50:59.076]  These are the multinational globalists who want to own everything just like he wants to own all the Hawaiian beaches.
[03:50:59.116 --> 03:50:59.537]  Stay with us.
[03:50:59.797 --> 03:51:00.417]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:11.832 --> 03:51:16.615]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[03:51:17.275 --> 03:51:18.856]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[03:51:19.256 --> 03:51:24.259]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[03:51:24.619 --> 03:51:30.063]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[03:51:30.463 --> 03:51:37.047]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[03:51:37.707 --> 03:51:38.828]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[03:51:39.688 --> 03:51:41.629]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[03:51:41.949 --> 03:51:44.911]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[03:51:45.351 --> 03:51:48.973]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[03:51:49.153 --> 03:51:51.714]  It is the base to so many things.
[03:51:51.774 --> 03:52:04.121]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[03:52:04.341 --> 03:52:09.443]  Other iodine comes from the ocean, or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[03:52:09.563 --> 03:52:10.904]  It's bound.
[03:52:11.184 --> 03:52:12.184]  It's not absorbable.
[03:52:12.604 --> 03:52:13.024]  I tried it.
[03:52:13.625 --> 03:52:17.166]  And I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[03:52:17.386 --> 03:52:22.288]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[03:52:22.648 --> 03:52:26.370]  It's such a game changer, if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[03:52:26.530 --> 03:52:29.111]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest, back in the 20s,
[03:52:29.651 --> 03:52:38.637]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[03:52:38.797 --> 03:52:42.460]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[03:52:42.620 --> 03:52:56.069]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[03:52:56.269 --> 03:53:05.111]  That's why, for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research.
[03:53:05.291 --> 03:53:07.811]  Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[03:53:08.031 --> 03:53:10.672]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:53:10.912 --> 03:53:13.872]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[03:53:14.252 --> 03:53:19.153]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[03:53:19.253 --> 03:53:20.393]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[03:53:20.554 --> 03:53:23.134]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[03:53:23.234 --> 03:53:23.474]  I don't know.
[03:53:46.138 --> 03:53:48.781]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[03:53:48.801 --> 03:53:49.822]  You've got to have water to live.
[03:53:50.142 --> 03:53:50.863]  Iodine is key.
[03:53:50.903 --> 03:53:51.504]  You must have it.
[03:53:51.864 --> 03:53:59.412]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[03:53:59.432 --> 03:54:00.313]  We can answer your questions.
[03:54:00.333 --> 03:54:00.373]  888-253-3139.
[03:54:23.544 --> 03:54:24.745]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:24.765 --> 03:54:25.326]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:25.987 --> 03:54:28.669]  Tonight we're going to take a look at the first 10 days of Donald Trump.
[03:54:28.689 --> 03:54:32.994]  We're also going to take a look at some of the actions that are going to be coming up in the next couple of days.
[03:54:33.034 --> 03:54:36.798]  Of course, tomorrow we're going to find out Trump's Supreme Court nominee.
[03:54:38.012 --> 03:54:42.255]  And the Democrats have already announced that they're going to oppose whoever it is, regardless.
[03:54:43.096 --> 03:54:55.006]  They don't even know who it is, but they're just going to oppose him because, just as we've seen them oppose Donald Trump, even though he does exactly what they would like to have happen on TPP, on reducing Pentagon spending and so forth.
[03:54:55.086 --> 03:54:59.269]  Now today, what he did was he came out and he did announce regulatory cuts.
[03:54:59.289 --> 03:55:04.773]  And this is something that he had said he was going to do, but he signed it into law here today with executive order.
[03:55:05.434 --> 03:55:05.854]  He has
[03:55:06.949 --> 03:55:16.272]  Put restrictions on the amount of new regulations is one of the first things that he did, but today he said he's going to continue to try to cut regulations by 75%.
[03:55:16.633 --> 03:55:18.373]  He said the American dream is back.
[03:55:18.433 --> 03:55:20.114]  This isn't a knock on President Obama.
[03:55:20.134 --> 03:55:22.535]  This is a knock on many presidents preceding me.
[03:55:23.035 --> 03:55:28.157]  He said regulation has been horrible for big business, but it has been worse for small business.
[03:55:28.877 --> 03:55:33.322]  He's especially been critical of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, calling it a disaster.
[03:55:33.402 --> 03:55:36.566]  He said we're going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank.
[03:55:37.527 --> 03:55:38.207]  And of course it is.
[03:55:39.332 --> 03:55:42.473]  Dodd-Frank is a good example of a lot of this regulation.
[03:55:43.074 --> 03:55:45.435]  It's very cumbersome, very expensive to comply with.
[03:55:45.575 --> 03:55:48.916]  Nobody can really afford to comply with it except the largest companies.
[03:55:48.956 --> 03:55:51.397]  And even for them, it's a big hit on their bottom line.
[03:55:52.078 --> 03:55:53.078]  But they're willing to take it.
[03:55:53.798 --> 03:55:56.640]  And in most cases, they're the ones who are pushing for it.
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:05.924]  It's big business who pushes for these regulations because what Dodd-Frank does is it drives small and medium-sized banks out of certain markets.
[03:56:07.253 --> 03:56:09.554]  Causes in many cases causes them to shut down.
[03:56:10.114 --> 03:56:21.577]  So the big business can take the hit on the regulations for a while until their competition is driven out of business and then they move in and then they get the Congress to take those regulations off of them.
[03:56:22.037 --> 03:56:26.498]  That has been a recurring MO of these usual suspects.
[03:56:26.538 --> 03:56:28.119]  We see this happening all the time.
[03:56:28.679 --> 03:56:29.899]  Donald Trump is on to that game.
[03:56:29.939 --> 03:56:30.680]  He's seen it played.
[03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:32.940]  I mean, you don't have to be a big businessman to see that.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:35.101]  Any small businessman can see that, quite frankly.
[03:56:35.681 --> 03:56:38.383]  When you look at the way these regulations are set up, it's not just banks.
[03:56:39.123 --> 03:56:40.504]  They do the same thing with restaurants.
[03:56:40.524 --> 03:56:43.185]  They do the same thing with pretty much every business.
[03:56:43.225 --> 03:56:48.788]  You have the large players come in, put in onerous regulations saying, we want to protect the market.
[03:56:48.848 --> 03:57:00.955]  We want to make sure that we don't have people coming in and destroying this market because they don't do a good job of regulating themselves, when really what they're doing is just sawing off the bottom rungs of the ladder.
[03:57:02.031 --> 03:57:07.853]  But of course, one of the big organizations that is on the chopping block is the EPA.
[03:57:07.913 --> 03:57:15.475]  As I mentioned on Friday, Trump wants to slash the EPA's $8 billion budget and its 15,000-strong workforce.
[03:57:16.136 --> 03:57:22.938]  One of the people who is in charge of the transition force for Donald Trump said that he would like to see this cut in half.
[03:57:22.998 --> 03:57:28.980]  And you know, when we look at this, what it reminds me of is the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson.
[03:57:29.721 --> 03:57:38.467]  We said the King had created swarms of officers to harass our people and to eat out their substance, and that is what this bureaucracy is.
[03:57:38.527 --> 03:57:46.913]  And the EPA is a perfect example of an organization that went way beyond their brief and has become nothing but an empire builder.
[03:57:47.993 --> 03:57:56.759]  And so you see Democrats coming out, people like Bernie Sanders and 11 others, saying there is a culture of fear being created in the Washington, D.C.
[03:57:56.779 --> 03:57:58.401]  bureaucracy, to which I say, great!
[03:57:59.679 --> 03:57:59.939]  Great.
[03:58:00.480 --> 03:58:03.122]  Because when the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[03:58:03.142 --> 03:58:06.185]  When the government fears the people, there is freedom.
[03:58:06.466 --> 03:58:07.046]  There's liberty.
[03:58:07.447 --> 03:58:09.769]  And of course, it goes back to what Donald Trump said on the very first day.
[03:58:10.329 --> 03:58:13.192]  Their victories, their successes have not been yours.
[03:58:13.292 --> 03:58:18.457]  And we've had a predatory bureaucracy that has fed off of us long enough, and now we're seeing
[03:58:19.358 --> 03:58:21.401]  Massive moves made in that direction by Donald Trump.
[03:58:21.421 --> 03:58:22.683]  We're going to talk more about this tonight.
[03:58:23.184 --> 03:58:27.791]  We're also going to talk about something else we haven't talked about, and that is the Spy Act.
[03:58:28.211 --> 03:58:29.013]  What is that about?
[03:58:29.413 --> 03:58:32.878]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:32.938 --> 03:58:33.179]  Eastern.
[03:58:45.618 --> 03:58:49.620]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.581 --> 03:58:55.522]  Boy, did the travel ban get him going or what?
[03:58:55.662 --> 03:58:58.143]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[03:58:58.323 --> 03:58:59.703]  But why are they really protesting?
[03:58:59.823 --> 03:59:14.729]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees, or in 2015 when he signed the Visa Waiver Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of his 2015 Christmas gift, Omnibus Spending Bill, which also created the list of countries that Donald Trump chose.
[03:59:14.989 --> 03:59:17.710]  So why no protest then over Obama but now over Trump?
[03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:19.270]  Coverage and transparency.
[03:59:19.470 --> 03:59:23.312]  See, Trump is transparent with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack mode against him.
[03:59:23.452 --> 03:59:26.553]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them.
[03:59:26.693 --> 03:59:30.634]  The CNN's of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[03:59:30.834 --> 03:59:35.536]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic, and Trump's travel ban will increase risk of Islamic terror.
[03:59:35.696 --> 03:59:44.200]  Yes, I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's fatal drones and bombs, which if we get to the bottom of that, would clear a lot of this up.
[03:59:44.340 --> 03:59:47.381]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[03:59:47.602 --> 03:59:47.882]  Why?
[03:59:48.102 --> 03:59:49.642]  Coverage and transparency.
[03:59:49.823 --> 03:59:52.164]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[03:59:54.545 --> 03:59:59.767]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex
